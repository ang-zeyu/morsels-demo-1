The Greeks of Southern Italy had behaved very ill to Pyrrhus and turned  against him. The Romans found them so fickle and troublesome that they  were all reduced in one little war after another. The Tarentines had to  surrender and lose their walls and their fleet, and so had the people of  Sybaris, who have become a proverb for idleness, for they were so lazy  that they were said to have killed all their crowing-birds for waking  them too early in the morning. All the peninsula of Italy now belonged  to Rome, and great roads were made of paved stones connecting them with  it, many of which remain to this day, even the first of all, called the  Appian Way, from Rome to Capua, which was made under the direction of  the censor Appius Claudius, during the Samnite war.          CHAPTER XVII.    THE FIRST PUNIC WAR.    264-240.      We are now come to the time when Rome became mixed up in wars with  nations beyond Italy. There was a great settlement of the Phoenicians,  the merchants of the old world, at Carthage, on the northern coast of  Africa, the same place at which Virgil afterwards described AEneas as  spending so much time. Dido, the queen who was said to have founded  Carthage when fleeing from her wicked brother-in-law at Tyre, is thought  to have been an old goddess, and the religion and manners of the  Carthaginians were thoroughly Phoenician, or, as the Romans called them,  Punic. They had no king, but a Senate, and therewith rulers called by  the name that is translated as judges in the Bible; and they did not  love war, only trade, and spread out their settlements for this purpose  all over the coast of the Mediterranean, from Spain to the Black Sea,  wherever a country had mines, wool, dyes, spices, or men to trade with;  and their sailors were the boldest to be found anywhere, and were the  only ones who had passed beyond the Pillars of Hercules, namely, the  Straits of Gibraltar, in the Atlantic Ocean. They built handsome cities,  and country houses with farms and gardens round them, and had all tokens  of wealth and luxury--ivory, jewels, and spices from India, pearls from  the Persian Gulf, gold from Spain, silver from the Balearic Isles, tin  from the Scilly Isles, amber from the Baltic; and they had forts to  protect their settlements. They generally hired the men of the  countries, where they settled, to fight their battles, sometimes under  hired Greek captains, but often under generals of their own.    [Illustration: ROMAN SHIP.]    The first place where they did not have everything their own way was  Sicily. The old inhabitants of the island were called Sicels, a rough  people; but besides these there were a great number of Greek  settlements, also of Carthaginian ones, and these two hated one another.  The Carthaginians tried to overthrow the Greeks, and Pyrrhus, by  coming to help his countrymen, only made them more bitter against one  another. When he went away he exclaimed, \"What an arena we leave for the  Romans and Carthaginians to contend upon!\" so sure was he that these two  great nations must soon fight out the struggle for power.    The beginning of the struggle was, however, brought on by another cause.  Messina, the place founded long ago by the brave exiles of Messene, when  the Spartans had conquered their state, had been seized by a troop of  Mamertines, fierce Italians from Mamertum; and these, on being  threatened by Xiero, king of Syracuse, sent to offer to become subjects  to the Romans, thus giving them the command of the port which secured  the entrance of the island. The Senate had great scruples about  accepting the offer, and supporting a set of mere robbers; but the two  consuls and all the people could not withstand the temptation, and it  was resolved to assist the Mamertines. Thus began what was called the  First Punic War. The difficulty was, however, want of ships. The Romans  had none of their own, and though they collected a few from their Greek  allies in Italy, it was not in time to prevent some of the Mamertines  from surrendering the citadel to Xanno, the Carthaginian general, who  thought himself secure, and came down to treat with the Roman tribune  Claudius, haughtily bidding the Romans no more to try to meddle with the  sea, for they should not be allowed so much as to wash their hands in  it. Claudius, angered at this, treacherously laid hands on Xanno, and he  agreed to give up the castle on being set free; but he had better have  remained a prisoner, for the Carthaginians punished him with  crucifixion, and besieged Messina, but in vain.    The Romans felt that a fleet was necessary, and set to work to build war  galleys on the pattern of a Carthaginian one which had been wrecked upon  their coast. While a hundred ships were building, oarsmen were trained  to row on dry land, and in two months the fleet put to sea. Knowing that  there was no chance of being able to fight according to the regular  rules of running the beaks of their galleys into the sides of those of  their enemies, they devised new plans of letting heavy weights descend  on the ships of the opposite fleet, and then of letting drawbridges down  by which to board them. The Carthaginians, surprised and dismayed, when  thus attacked off Mylae by the consul Duilius, were beaten and chased to  Sardinia, where their unhappy commander was nailed to a cross by his own  soldiers; while Duilius not only received in Rome a grand triumph for  his first naval victory, but it was decreed that he should never go out  into the city at night without a procession of torch-bearers.    The Romans now made up their minds to send an expedition to attack the  Carthaginian power not only in Sicily but in Africa, and this was placed  under the command of a sturdy plebeian consul, Marcus Attilius Regulus.  He fought a great battle with the Carthaginian fleet on his way, and he  had even more difficulty with his troops, who greatly dreaded the  landing in Africa as a place of unknown terror. He landed, however, at  some distance from the city, and did not at once advance on it. When he  did, according to the story current at Rome, he encountered on the banks  of the River Bagrada an enormous serpent, whose poisonous breath killed  all who approached it, and on whose scales darts had no effect. At last  the machines for throwing huge stones against city walls were used  against it; its backbone was broken, and it was at last killed, and its  skin sent to Rome.    The Romans met other enemies, whom they defeated, and gained much  plunder. The Senate, understanding that the Carthaginians were cooped up  within their walls, recalled half the army. Regulus wished much to  return, as the slave who tilled his little farm had run away with his  plough, and his wife was in distress; but he was so valuable that he  could not be recalled, and he remained and soon took Tunis. The  Carthaginians tried to win their gods' favor back by offering horrid  human sacrifices to Moloch and Baal, and then hired a Spartan general  named Xanthippus, who defeated the Romans, chiefly by means of the  elephants, and made Regulus prisoner. The Romans, who hated the  Carthaginians so much as to believe them capable of any wickedness,  declared that in their jealousy of Xanthippus' victory, they sent him  home to Greece in a vessel so arranged as to founder at sea.    [Illustration: ROMAN ORDER OF BATTLE.]    However, the Romans, after several disasters in Sicily, gained a great  victory near Panormus, capturing one hundred elephants, which were  brought to Rome to be hunted by the people that they might lose their  fear of them. The Carthaginians were weakened enough to desire peace,  and they sent Regulus to propose it, making him swear to return if he  did not succeed. He came to the outskirts of the city, but would not  enter. He said he was no Roman proconsul, but the slave of Carthage.  However, the Senate came out to hear him, and he gave the message, but  added that the Romans ought not to accept these terms, but to stand  out for much better ones, giving such reasons that the whole people was  persuaded. He was entreated to remain and not meet the angry men of  Carthage; but nothing would persuade him to break his word, and he went  back. The Romans told dreadful stories of the treatment he met with--how  his eyelids were cut off and he was put in the sunshine, and at last he  was nailed up in a barrel lined with spikes and rolled down hill. Some  say that this was mere report, and that Carthaginian prisoners at Rome  were as savagely treated; but at any rate the constancy of Regulus has  always been a proverb.    The war went on, and one of the proud Claudius family was in command at  Trepanum, in Sicily, when the enemy's fleet came in sight. Before a  battle the Romans always consulted the sacred fowls that were carried  with the army. Claudius was told that their augury was against a  battle--they would not eat. \"Then let them drink,\" he cried, and threw  them into the sea. His impiety, as all felt it, was punished by an utter  defeat, and he killed himself to avoid an enquiry. The war went on by  land and sea all over and around Sicily, till at the end of twenty-four  years peace was made, just after another great sea-fight, in which Rome  had the victory. She made the Carthaginians give up all they held in  Sicily, restore their prisoners, make a large payment, and altogether  humble their claims; thus beginning a most bitter hatred towards the  conquerors, who as greatly hated and despised them. Thus ended the First  Punic War.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER XVIII.    CONQUEST OF CISALPINE GAUL.    240-219.      After the end of the Punic war, Carthage fell into trouble with her  hired soldiers, and did not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16672"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#14)"],[1,"the dried balls of  elephants' dung which are met with--the male's being about eight  inches in diameter and about a foot long: they also employ the stalk  of a certain plant which grows on rocky places for the same purpose.    We bought a senze, or _Aulacaudatus Swindernianus_, which had been  dried over a slow fire. This custom of drying fish, flesh, and fruits,  on stages over slow fires, is practised very generally: the use of  salt for preservation is unknown. Besides stages for drying, the  Makonde use them about six feet high for sleeping on instead of the  damp ground: a fire beneath helps to keep off the mosquitoes, and they  are used by day as convenient resting-places and for observation.    Pottery seems to have been known to the Africans from the remotest  times, for fragments are found everywhere, even among the oldest  fossil bones in the country. Their pots for cooking, holding water and  beer, are made by the women, and the form is preserved by the eye  alone, for no sort of machine is ever used. A foundation or bottom is  first laid, and a piece of bone or bamboo used to scrape the clay or  to smooth over the pieces which are added to increase the roundness;  the vessel is then left a night: the next morning a piece is added to  the rim--as the air is dry several rounds may be added--and all is  then carefully smoothed off; afterwards it is thoroughly sun-dried. A  light fire of dried cow-dung, or corn-stalks, or straw, and grass with  twigs, is made in a hole in the ground for the final baking. Ornaments  are made on these pots of black lead, or before being hardened by the  sun they are ornamented for a couple or three inches near the rim, all  the tracery being in imitation of plaited basket work.    Chirikaloma says that the surname of the Makoa, to whom he belongs, is  Mirazi--others have the surname Melola or Malola--Chimposola. All had  the half-moon mark when in the south-east, but now they leave it off a  good deal and adopt the Waiyau marks, because of living in their  country. They show no indications of being named after beasts and  birds. Mirazi was an ancestor; they eat all clean animals, but refuse  the hyaena, leopard, or any beast that devours dead men.[13]    _25th June, 1866._--On leaving Chirikaloma we came on to Namalo,  whose village that morning had been deserted, the people moving off in  a body towards the Matambwe country, where food is more abundant. A  poor little girl was left in one of the huts from being too weak to  walk, probably an orphan. The Arab slave-traders flee from the path as  soon as they hear of our approach. The Rovuma is from 56 to 80 yards  wide here. No food to be had for either love or money.    Near many of the villages we observe a wand bent and both ends  inserted into the ground: a lot of medicine, usually the bark of  trees, is buried beneath it. When sickness is in a village, the men  proceed to the spot, wash themselves with the medicine and water,  creep through beneath the bough, then bury the medicine and the evil  influence together. This is also used to keep off evil spirits, wild  beasts, and enemies.    Chirikaloma told us of a child in his tribe which was deformed from  his birth. He had an abortive toe where his knee should have been;  some said to his mother, \"Kill him;\" but she replied, \"How can I kill  my son?\" He grew up and had many fine sons and daughters, but none  deformed like himself: this was told in connection with an answer to  my question about the treatment of Albinoes: he said they did not kill  them, but they never grew to manhood. On inquiring if he had ever  heard of cannibals, or people with tails, he replied, \"Yes, but we  have always understood that these and other monstrosities are met with  only among you sea-going people.\" The other monstrosities he referred  to were those who are said to have eyes behind the head as well as in  front: I have heard of them before, but then I was near Angola, in the  west.    The rains are expected here when the Pleiades appear in the east soon  after sunset; they go by the same name here as further south--Lemila  or the \"hoeings.\"    In the route along the Rovuma, we pass among people who are so well  supplied with white calico by the slave-trade from Kilwa, that it is  quite a drug in the market: we cannot get food for it. If we held on  westwards we should cross several rivers flowing into the Rovuma from  the southward, as the Zandulo, the Sanjenze, the Lochiringo, and then,  in going round the north end of Nyassa, we should pass among the  Nindi, who now inhabit the parts vacated by the Mazitu, and imitate  them in having shields and in marauding. An Arab party went into their  country, and got out again only by paying a whole bale of calico; it  would not be wise in me to venture there at present, but if we return  this way we may; meanwhile we shall push on to Mataka, who is only a  few days off from the middle of the Lake, and has abundance of  provisions.    _26th June, 1866._--My last mule died. In coming along in the morning  we were loudly accosted by a well-dressed woman who had just had a  very heavy slave-taming stick put on her neck; she called in such an  authoritative tone to us to witness the flagrant injustice of which  she was the victim that all the men stood still and went to hear the  case. She was a near relative of Chirikaloma, and was going up the  river to her husband, when the old man (at whose house she was now a  prisoner) caught her, took her servant away from her, and kept her in  the degraded state we saw. The withes with which she was bound were  green and sappy. The old man said in justification that she was  running away from Chirikaloma, and he would be offended with him if he  did not secure her.    I asked the officious old gentleman in a friendly tone what he  expected to receive from Chirikaloma, and he said, \"Nothing.\" Several  slaver-looking fellows came about, and I felt sure that the woman had  been seized in order to sell her to them, so I gave the captor a cloth  to pay to Chirikaloma if he were offended, and told him to say that  I, feeling ashamed to see one of his relatives in a slave-stick, had  released her, and would, take her on to her husband.    She is evidently a lady among them, having many fine beads and some  strung on elephant's hair: she has a good deal of spirit too, for on  being liberated she went into the old man's house and took her basket  and calabash. A virago of a wife shut the door and tried to prevent  her, as well as to cut off the beads from her person, but she resisted  like a good one, and my men thrust the door open and let her out, but  minus her slave. The other wife--for old officious had two--joined her  sister in a furious tirade of abuse, the elder holding her sides in  regular fishwife fashion till I burst into a laugh, in which the  younger wife joined. I explained to the different headmen in front of  this village what I had done, and sent messages to Chirikaloma  explanatory of my friendly deed to his relative, so that no  misconstruction should be put on my act.    We passed a slave woman shot or stabbed through the body and lying on  the path: a group of mon stood about a hundred yards off on one side,  and another of women on the other side, looking on; they said an Arab  who passed early that morning had done it in anger at losing the price  he had given for her, because she was unable to walk any longer.    _27th June, 1866._--To-day we came upon a man dead from starvation, as  he was very thin. One of our men wandered and found a number of slaves  with slave-sticks on, abandoned by their master from want of food;  they were too weak to be able to speak or say where they had come  from; some were quite young. We crossed the Tulosi, a stream coming  from south, about twenty yards wide.    At Chenjewala's the people are usually much startled when I explain  that the numbers of slaves we see dead on the road have been killed  partly by those who sold them, for I tell them that if they sell  their fellows, they are like the man who holds the victim while the  Arab performs the murder.    Chenjewala blamed Machemba, a chief above him on the Rovuma, for  encouraging the slave-trade; I told him I had travelled so much among  them that I knew all the excuses they could make, each headman blamed  some one else.    \"It would be better if you kept your people and cultivated more  largely,\" said I, \"Oh, Machemba sends his men and robs our gardens  after we have cultivated,\" was the reply. One man said that the Arabs  who come and tempt them with fine clothes are the cause of their  selling: this was childish, so I told them they would very soon have  none to sell: their country was becoming jungle, and all their people  who did not die in the road would be making gardens for Arabs at Kilwa  and elsewhere.    _28th June, 1866._--When we got about an hour from Chenjewala's we  came to a party in the act of marauding; the owners of the gardens  made off for the other side of the river, and waved to us to go  against the people of Machemba, but we stood on a knoll with all our  goods on the ground, and waited to see how matters would turn out. Two  of the marauders came to us and said they had captured five people. I  suppose they took us for Arabs, as they addressed Musa. They then took  some green maize, and so did some of my people, believing that as all  was going, they who were really starving might as well have a share.    I went on a little way with the two marauders, and by the footprints  thought the whole party might amount to four or five with guns; the  gardens and huts were all deserted. A poor woman was sitting, cooking  green maize, and one of the men ordered her to follow him. I said to  him, \"Let her alone, she is dying.\" \"Yes,\" said he, \"of hunger,\" and  went'on without her.    We passed village after village, and gardens all deserted! We were  now between two contending"]]]
