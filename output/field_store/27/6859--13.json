Thus have We  set forth and made clear unto you that which ye are bidden to observe,  that ye may follow the commandments of God and be united in that which the  Almighty, the All-Wise, hath appointed unto you. He Who is your Lord, the  All-Merciful, cherisheth in His heart the desire of beholding the entire  human race as one soul and one body. Haste ye to win your share of God's  good grace and mercy in this Day that eclipseth all other created Days.  How great the felicity that awaiteth the man that forsaketh all he hath in  a desire to obtain the things of God! Such a man, We testify, is among  God's blessed ones.    155 O King! Bear thou witness unto that which God hath Himself and for  Himself borne witness ere the creation of earth and heaven, that there is  none other God but Me, the One, the Single, the Most Exalted, the  Incomparable, the Inaccessible. Arise with the utmost steadfastness in the  Cause of thy Lord, the All-Glorious. Thus hast thou been instructed in  this wondrous Tablet. We, verily, have desired naught for thee save that  which is better for thee than all that is on earth. Unto this testify all  created things and beyond them this perspicuous Book.    156 Meditate on the world and the state of its people. He, for Whose sake  the world was called into being, hath been imprisoned in the most desolate  of cities,(20) by reason of that which the hands of the wayward have  wrought. From the horizon of His prison-city He summoneth mankind unto the  Dayspring of God, the Exalted, the Great. Exultest thou over the treasures  thou dost possess, knowing they shall perish? Rejoicest thou in that thou  rulest a span of earth, when the whole world, in the estimation of the  people of Baha, is worth as much as the black in the eye of a dead ant?  Abandon it unto such as have set their affections upon it, and turn thou  unto Him Who is the Desire of the world. Whither are gone the proud and  their palaces? Gaze thou into their tombs, that thou mayest profit by this  example, inasmuch as We made it a lesson unto every beholder. Were the  breezes of Revelation to seize thee, thou wouldst flee the world, and turn  unto the Kingdom, and wouldst expend all thou possessest, that thou mayest  draw nigh unto this sublime Vision.    157 We behold the generality of mankind worshipping names and exposing  themselves, as thou dost witness, to dire perils in the mere hope of  perpetuating their names, whilst every perceiving soul testifieth that  after death one's name shall avail him nothing except insofar as it  beareth a relationship unto God, the Almighty, the All-Praised. Thus have  their vain imaginings taken hold of them in requital for that which their  hands have wrought. Consider the pettiness of men's minds. They seek with  utmost exertion that which profiteth them not, and yet wert thou to ask of  them: \"Is there any advantage in that which ye desire?\", thou wouldst find  them sorely perplexed. Were a fair-minded soul to be found, he would  reply: \"Nay, by the Lord of the worlds!\" Such is the condition of the  people and of that which they possess. Leave them in their folly and turn  thy sight unto God. This is in truth that which beseemeth thee. Hearken  then unto the counsel of thy Lord, and say: Lauded art Thou, O God of all  who are in heaven and on earth!          Czar Alexander II      158 O Czar of Russia! Incline thine ear unto the voice of God, the King,  the Holy, and turn thou unto Paradise, the Spot wherein abideth He Who,  among the Concourse on high, beareth the most excellent titles, and Who,  in the kingdom of creation, is called by the name of God, the Effulgent,  the All-Glorious. Beware lest thy desire deter thee from turning towards  the face of thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Most Merciful. We, verily,  have heard the thing for which thou didst supplicate thy Lord, whilst  secretly communing with Him. Wherefore, the breeze of My loving-kindness  wafted forth, and the sea of My mercy surged, and We answered thee in  truth. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Whilst I lay  chained and fettered in the prison, one of thy ministers extended Me his  aid. Wherefore hath God ordained for thee a station which the knowledge of  none can comprehend except His knowledge. Beware lest thou barter away  this sublime station. Thy Lord, verily, doeth what He willeth. What He  pleaseth will God abrogate or confirm, and with Him is the knowledge of  all things in a Guarded Tablet.    159 Beware lest thy sovereignty withhold thee from Him Who is the Supreme  Sovereign. He, verily, is come with His Kingdom, and all the atoms cry  aloud: \"Lo! The Lord is come in His great majesty!\" He Who is the Father  is come, and the Son, in the holy vale, crieth out: \"Here am I, here am I,  O Lord, My God!\", whilst Sinai circleth round the House, and the Burning  Bush calleth aloud: \"The All-Bounteous is come mounted upon the clouds!  Blessed is he that draweth nigh unto Him, and woe betide them that are far  away.\"    160 Arise thou amongst men in the name of this all-compelling Cause, and  summon, then, the nations unto God, the Exalted, the Great. Be thou not of  them who called upon God by one of His names, but who, when He Who is the  Object of all names appeared, denied Him and turned aside from Him, and,  in the end, pronounced sentence against Him with manifest injustice.  Consider and call thou to mind the days whereon the Spirit of God  appeared, and Herod gave judgement against Him. God, however, aided Him  with the hosts of the unseen, and protected Him with truth, and sent Him  down unto another land, according to His promise. He, verily, ordaineth  what He pleaseth. Thy Lord truly preserveth whom He willeth, be he in the  midst of the seas, or in the maw of the serpent, or beneath the sword of  the oppressor.    161 Blessed be the king whom the veils of glory have not deterred from  turning unto the Dayspring of beauty and who hath forsaken his all in his  desire to obtain the things of God. He, indeed, is accounted in the sight  of God as the most excellent of men, and is extolled by the inmates of  paradise and them that circle morn and eve round the Throne on high.    162 Again I say: Hearken unto My voice that calleth from My prison, that  it may acquaint thee with the things that have befallen My Beauty, at the  hands of them that are the manifestations of My glory, and that thou  mayest perceive how great hath been My patience, notwithstanding My might,  and how immense My forbearance, notwithstanding My power. By My life!  Couldst thou but know the things sent down by My Pen, and discover the  treasures of My Cause, and the pearls of My mysteries which lie hid in the  seas of My names and in the goblets of My words, thou wouldst, in thy love  for My name, and in thy longing for My glorious and sublime Kingdom, lay  down thy life in My path. Know thou that though My body be beneath the  swords of My foes, and My limbs be beset with incalculable afflictions,  yet My spirit is filled with a gladness with which all the joys of the  earth can never compare.    163 Set thine heart towards Him Who is the Point of adoration for the  world, and say: \"O peoples of the earth! Have ye denied the One in Whose  path He Who came with the truth, bearing the announcement of your Lord,  the Exalted, the Great, suffered martyrdom?\" Say: This is an Announcement  whereat the hearts of the Prophets and Messengers have rejoiced. This is  the One Whom the heart of the world remembereth, and is promised in the  Books of God, the Mighty, the All-Wise. The hands of the Messengers were,  in their desire to meet Me, upraised towards God, the Mighty, the  Glorified. Unto this testifieth that which hath been sent down in the  sacred Scriptures by Him Who is the Lord of might and power.    164 Some lamented in their separation from Me, others endured hardships in  My path, and still others laid down their lives for the sake of My Beauty,  could ye but know it. Say: I, verily, have not sought to extol Mine own  Self, but rather God Himself, were ye to judge fairly. Naught can be seen  in Me except God and His Cause, could ye but perceive it. I am the One  Whom the tongue of Isaiah hath extolled, the One with Whose name both the  Torah and the Evangel were adorned. Thus hath it been decreed in the  Scriptures of thy Lord, the Most Merciful. He, verily, hath borne witness  unto Me, as I bear witness unto Him. And God testifieth to the truth of My  words.    165 Say: The Books have been sent down for naught but My remembrance.  Whosoever is receptive to their call shall perceive therefrom the sweet  fragrances of My name and My praise; and he who hath unstopped the ear of  his inmost heart shall hear from every word thereof: \"The True One is  come! He indeed is the beloved of the worlds!\"    166 It is for the sake of God alone that My tongue counselleth you and  that My pen moveth to make mention of you, for neither can the malice and  denial of all who dwell on earth harm Me, nor the allegiance of the entire  creation profit Me. We, verily, exhort you unto that which We were  commanded, and desire naught from you except that ye draw nigh unto what  shall profit you in both this world and the world to come. Say: Will ye  slay Him Who summoneth you unto life everlasting? Fear ye God, and follow  not every contumacious oppressor.    167 O proud ones of the earth! Do ye believe yourselves to be abiding in  palaces whilst He Who is the King of Revelation resideth in the most  desolate of abodes? Nay, by My life! In tombs do ye dwell, could ye but  perceive it. Verily, he who faileth, in these days, to be stirred by the  breeze of God is accounted among the dead in the sight of Him Who is the  Lord of all names and attributes. Arise, then, from the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17310"],[0,"Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas (#14)"],[1,"God! Righteous men of learning who dedicate themselves to the  guidance of others and are freed and well guarded from the promptings of a  base and covetous nature are, in the sight of Him Who is the Desire of the  world, stars of the heaven of true knowledge. It is essential to treat  them with deference. They are indeed fountains of soft-flowing water,  stars that shine resplendent, fruits of the blessed Tree, exponents of  celestial power, and oceans of heavenly wisdom. Happy is he that followeth  them. Verily such a soul is numbered in the Book of God, the Lord of the  mighty Throne, among those with whom it shall be well.    The glory which proceedeth from God, the Lord of the Throne on High and of  the earth below, rest upon you, O people of Baha, O ye the companions of  the Crimson Ark, and upon such as have inclined their ears to your sweet  voices and have observed that whereunto they are bidden in this mighty and  wondrous Tablet.                                      ISHRAQAT (SPLENDOURS)      This is the Epistle of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting    He is God, exalted is He, the Lord of wisdom and utterance.    PRAISE be unto God, incomparable in majesty, power and beauty, peerless in  glory, might and grandeur; too high is He for human imaginations to  comprehend Him or for any peer or equal to be ascribed unto Him. He hath  clearly set forth His straight Path in words and utterances of highest  eloquence. Verily He is the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted. When He  purposed to call the new creation into being, He sent forth the Manifest  and Luminous Point from the horizon of His Will; it passed through every  sign and manifested itself in every form until it reached the zenith, as  bidden by God, the Lord of all men.    This Point is the focal centre of the circle of Names and marketh the  culmination of the manifestations of Letters in the world of creation.  Through it have appeared indications of the impenetrable Mystery, the  adorned Symbol, He Who standeth revealed in the Most Great Name--a Name  which is recorded in the luminous Tablet and is inscribed in the holy, the  blessed, the snow-white Scroll. And when the Point was joined to the  second Letter(25) which appeareth in the beginning of the Mathani,(26) it  traversed the heavens of exposition and utterance. Then the eternal Light  of God shed its radiance, flared up in the midmost heart of the firmament  of testimony and produced two Luminaries. Glorified be the Merciful One,  unto Whom no allusion can be made, Whom no expression can define, nor any  assertion reveal, nor any evidence describe. He is in truth the Ordainer,  the All-Bountiful, both in the beginning and in the end. And He provided  for them protectors and defenders from among the hosts of power and might.  Verily, He is the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Unconstrained.    The preamble of this Epistle is being revealed twice, even as was the  Mathani(27)    Praise be unto God Who hath manifested the Point, hath unfolded therefrom  the knowledge of all things, whether of the past or of the future--a Point  He hath chosen to be the Herald of His Name and the Harbinger of His Great  Revelation which hath caused the limbs of all mankind to quake and the  splendour of His light to shine forth above the horizon of the world.  Verily, this is the Point which God hath ordained to be an ocean of light  for the sincere among His servants and a flame of fire to the froward  amidst His creatures and the impious among His people--they who bartered  away the gift of God for unbelief, and the celestial food for hypocrisy,  and led their associates to a wretched abode. These are the people who  have manifested sedition throughout the world and have violated His  Covenant on the Day when the immortal Being mounted His throne and the  Crier raised His Voice from the haven of security and peace in the holy  Vale.    O followers of the Bayan! Fear ye the All-Merciful. This is the One Who  hath been glorified by Muhammad, the Apostle of God, and before Him by the  Spirit(28) and yet before Him by the One Who discoursed with God.(29) This  is the Point of the Bayan calling aloud before the Throne, saying: 'By the  righteousness of God, ye have been created to glorify this Most Great  Announcement, this Perfect Way which lay hid within the souls of the  Prophets, which was treasured in the hearts of the chosen ones of God and  was written down by the glorious Pen of your Lord, the Possessor of  Names.'    Say: Die in your wrath, O malicious ones! Verily He Whose knowledge  nothing escapeth hath appeared. He Who hath caused the countenance of  divine knowledge to be wreathed in smiles is come. Through Him the kingdom  of utterance is embellished, every receptive soul hath set his face  towards the Lord of Revelations, everyone resting on his knees hath stood  up, and every indolent one hath rushed forth to attain the Sinai of  assurance. This is the Day that God hath ordained to be a blessing unto  the righteous, a retribution for the wicked, a bounty for the faithful and  a fury of His wrath for the faithless and the froward. Verily He hath been  made manifest, invested by God with invincible sovereignty. He hath  revealed that wherewith naught on the earth or in the heavens can compare.    Fear ye the All-Merciful, O people of the Bayan, and commit not that which  the followers of the Qur'an have committed--they who in the daytime and in  the night season professed belief in the Faith of God, yet when the Lord  of all men did appear, turned aside from Him and pronounced so cruel a  sentence against Him that, on the Day of Return, the Mother Book sorely  bewailed His plight. Call ye to mind and ponder upon their deeds and  words, their stations and merits and the things they brought to pass when  He Who conversed on Sinai unloosed His tongue, when there was a blast on  the Trumpet, whereupon all that are in heaven and on earth swooned away  except such as are reckoned among the letters of affirmation.    O people of the Bayan! Abandon your idle fancies and vain imaginings, then  with the eye of fairness look at the Dayspring of His Revelation and  consider the things He hath manifested, the words He hath divinely  revealed and the sufferings that have befallen Him at the hands of His  enemies. He is the One Who hath willingly accepted every manner of  tribulation for the proclamation of His Cause and the exaltation of His  Word. At one time He suffered imprisonment in the land of Ta (Tihran), at  another in the land of Mim (Mazindaran), then once again in the former  land, for the sake of the Cause of God, the Maker of the heavens. In His  love for the Cause of God, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful, He was  subjected there to chains and fetters.    O people of the Bayan! Have ye forgotten My exhortations, which My Pen  hath revealed and My tongue hath uttered? Have ye bartered away My  certitude in exchange for your idle fancies and My Way for your selfish  desires? Have ye cast away the precepts of God and His remembrance and  have ye forsaken His laws and ordinances? Fear ye God and abandon vain  imaginings to the begetters thereof and leave superstitions to the  devisers thereof and misgivings to the breeders thereof. Advance ye then  with radiant faces and stainless hearts towards the horizon above which  the Day-Star of certitude shineth resplendent at the bidding of God, the  Lord of Revelations.    Praise be unto God Who hath made the Most Great Infallibility the shield  for the temple of His Cause in the realm of creation, and hath assigned  unto no one a share of this lofty and sublime station--a station which is a  vesture which the fingers of transcendent power have woven for His august  Self. It befitteth no one except Him Who is seated upon the mighty throne  of 'He doeth what He pleaseth'. Whoso accepteth and recognizeth that which  is written down at this moment by the Pen of Glory is indeed reckoned in  the Book of God, the Lord of the beginning and the end, among the  exponents of divine unity, they that uphold the concept of the oneness of  God.    When the stream of words reached this stage, the sweet savours of true  knowledge were shed abroad and the day-star of divine unity shone forth  above the horizon of His holy utterance. Blessed is he whom His Call hath  attracted to the summit of glory, who hath drawn nigh to the ultimate  Purpose, and who hath recognized through the shrill voice of My Pen of  Glory that which the Lord of this world and of the next hath willed. Whoso  faileth to quaff the choice wine which We have unsealed through the  potency of Our Name, the All-Compelling, shall be unable to discern the  splendours of the light of divine unity or to grasp the essential purpose  underlying the Scriptures of God, the Lord of heaven and earth, the  sovereign Ruler of this world and of the world to come. Such a man shall  be accounted among the faithless in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the  All-Informed.    O thou honoured enquirer!(30) We bear witness that thou didst firmly  adhere unto seemly patience during the days when the Pen was held back  from movement and the Tongue hesitated to set forth an explanation  regarding the wondrous sign, the Most Great Infallibility. Thou hast asked  this Wronged One to remove for thee its veils and coverings, to elucidate  its mystery and character, its state and position, its excellence,  sublimity and exaltation. By the life of God! Were We to unveil the pearls  of testimony which lie hid within the shells of the ocean of knowledge and  assurance or to let the beauties of divine mystery which are hidden within  the chambers of utterance in the Paradise of true understanding, step out  of their habitation, then from every direction violent commotion would  arise among the leaders of religion and thou wouldst witness the people of  God held fast in the teeth of such wolves as have denied God both in the"]]]
