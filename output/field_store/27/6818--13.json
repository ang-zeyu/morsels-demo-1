(#14)"],[1,"supplied with painted scenes, which were by  him introduced at least, if not invented, which afforded certainly an  additional beauty to the theatre, tho' some have insinuated, that fine  scenes proved the ruin of acting; but as we are persuaded it will be  an entertaining circumstance to our Readers, to have that matter more  fully explained, we shall take this opportunity of doing it.    In the reign of Charles I, dramatic entertainments were accompanied  with rich scenery, curious machines, and other elegant embellishments,  chiefly condufted by the wonderful dexterity of that celebrated  English, architect Inigo Jones. But these were employed only in  masques at court, and were too expensive for the little theatres in  which plays were then acted. In them there was nothing more than a  ouftain of very coarse stuff, upon the drawing up of which, the stage  appeared either with bare walls on the sides, coarsly matted, or  covered with tapestry; so that for the place originally represented,  and all the successive changes in which the poets of those times  freely indulged themselves, there was nothing to help the spectator's  understanding, or to assist the actor's performance, but bare  imagination. In Shakespear's time so undecorated were the theatres,  that a blanket supplied the place of a curtain; and it was a good  observation of the ingenious Mr. Chitty, a gentleman of acknowledged  taste in dramatic excellence, that the circumstance of the blanket,  suggested to Shakespear that noble image in Macbeth, where the  murderer invokes      Thick night to veil itself in the dunnest smoke of Hell,    Nor Heaven peep thro' the blanket of the dark    To cry hold, hold.    It is true, that while things continued in this situation, there were  a great many play-houses, sometimes six or seven open at once. Of  these some were large, and in part open, where they acted by day  light; others smaller, but better fitted up, where they made use of  candles. The plainness of the theatre made the prices small, and drew  abundance of company; yet upon the whole it is doubtful, whether the  spectactors in all these houses were really superior in number, to  those who have frequented the theatres in later times. If the spirit  and judgment of the actors supplied all deficiencies, and made as some  would insinuate, plays more intelligible without scenes, than they  afterwards were with them, it must be very astonishing; neither is it  difficult to assign another cause, why those who were concerned in  play-houses, were angry at the introduction of scenes and decorations,  which was, that notwithstanding the advanced prices, their profits  from that time were continually sinking; and an author, of high  authority in this case, assures us, in an historical account of the  stage, that the whole sharers in Mr. Hart's company divided a thousand  pounds a year a-piece, before the expensive decorations became  fashionable. Sir William Davehant considered things in another light:  he was well acquainted with the alterations which the French theatre  had received, under the auspice of cardinal Rich[e]lieu, who had an  excellent taste; and he remembered the noble contrivances of Inigo  Jones, which were not at all inferior to the designs of the best  French masters. Sir William was likewise sensible that the monarch he  served was an excellent judge of every thing of this kind; and these  considerations excited in him a passion for the advancement of the  theatre, to which the great figure it has since made is chiefly owing.  Mr. Dryden has acknowledged his admirable talents in this way, and  gratefully remembers the pains taken by our poet, to set a work of his  in the fairest light possible, and to which, he ingenuously ascribes  the success with which it was received. This is the hislory of the  life and progress of scenery on our stage; which, without doubt, gives  greater life to the entertainment of a play; but as the best purposes  may be prostituted, so there is some reason to believe that the  excessive fondness for decorations, which now prevails, has hurt the  true dramatic taste. Scenes are to be considered as secondary in a  play, the means of setting it off with lustre, and ought to engross  but little attention; as it is more important to hear what a character  speaks, than to observe the place where he stands; but now the case is  altered. The scenes in a Harlequin Sorcerer, and other unmeaning  pantomimes, unknown to our more elegant and judging fore-fathers,  procure crowded houses, while the noblest strokes of Dryden, the  delicate touches of Otway and Rowe, the wild majesty of Shakespear,  and the heart-felt language of Lee, pass neglected, when put in  competition with those gewgaws of the stage, these feasts of the eye;  which as they can communicate no ideas, so they can neither warm nor  reform the heart, nor answer one moral purpose in nature.    We ought not to omit a cirrumstance much in favour of Sir William  Davenant, which proves him to have been as good a man as a poet. When  at the Restoration, those who had been active in disturbing the late  reign, and secluding their sovereign from the throne, became obnoxious  to the royal party, Milton was likely to feel the vengeance of the  court, Davenant actuated by a noble principle of gratitude, interposed  all his influence, and saved the greatest ornament of the world from  the stroke of an executioner. Ten years before that, Davenant had been  rescued by Milton, and he remembered the favour; an instance, this,  that generosity, gratitude, and nobleness of nature is confined to no  particular party; but the heart of a good man will still discover  itself in acts of munificence and kindness, however mistaken he may be  in his opinion, however warm in state factions. The particulars of  this extraordinary affair are related in the life of Milton.    Sir William Davenant continued at the head of his company of actors,  and at last transferred them to a new and magnificent theatre built in  Dorset-Gardens, where some of his old plays were revived with very  singular circumstances of royal kindness, and a new one when brought  upon the stage met with great applause.    The last labour of his pen was in altering a play of Shakespear's,  called the Tempest, so as to render it agreeable to that age, or  rather susceptible of those theatrical improvements he had brought  into fashion. The great successor to his laurel, in a preface to this  play, in which he was concerned with Davenant, 'says, that he was a  man of quick and piercing imagination, and soon found that somewhat  might be added to the design of Shakespear, of which neither Fletcher  nor Suckling had ever thought; and therefore to put the last hand to  it, he designed the counterpart to Shakespear's plot, namely, that of  a man who had never seen a woman, that by this means, these two  characters of innocence and love might the more illustrate and commend  each other. This excellent contrivance he was pleased to communicate  to me, and to defire my assistance in it. I confess that from the  first moment it so pleased me, that I never wrote any thing with so  much delight. I might likewise do him that justice to acknowledge that  my writing received daily amendments, and that is the reason why it is  not so faulty, as the rest that I have done, without the help or  correction of so judicious a friend. The comical parts of the sailors  were also of his invention and Writing, as may easily be discovered  from the stile.'    This great man died at his house in little Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, April  17, 1668, aged 63, and two days afterwards was interred in  Westminster-Abbey. On his gravestone is inscribed, in imitation of Ben  Johnson's short epitaph,                         O RARE SIR WILLIAM DAVENANT!    It may not be amiss to observe, that his remains rest very near the  place out of which those of Mr. Thomas May, who had been formerly his  rival for the bays, and the Parliament's historian, were removed, by  order of the ministry. As to the family our author left behind him,  some account of it will be given in the life of his son Dr. Charles  Davenant, who succeeded him as manager of the theatre. Sir William's  works entire were published by his widow 1673, and dedicated to James  Duke of York.    After many storms of adversity, our author spent the evening of his  days in ease and serenity. He had the happiness of being loved by  people of all denominations, and died lamented by every worthy good  man. As a poet, unnumbered evidences may be produced in his favour.  Amongst these Mr. Dryden is the foremost, for when his testimony can  be given in support of poetical merit, we reckon all other evidence  superfluous, and without his, all other evidences deficient. In his  words then we shall sum up Davenant's character as a poet, and a man  of genius.    'I found him, (says he) in his preface to the Tempest, of so quick a  fancy, that nothing was proposed to him on which he could not quickly  produce a thought extreamly pleasant and surprizing, and these first  thoughts of his, contrary to the old Latin proverb, were not always  the least happy, and as his fancy was quick, so likewise were the  products of it remote and new. He borrowed not of any other, and his  imaginations were such as could not easily enter into any other man.  His corrections were sober and judicious, and he corrected his own  writings much more severely than those of another man, bestowing twice  the labour and pain in polishing which he used in invention.'    Before we enumerate the dramatic works of Sir William Davenant, it  will be but justice to his merit, to insert some animadversions on his  Gondibert; a poem which has been the subject of controversy almost a  hundred years; that is, from its first appearance to the present time.  Perhaps the dispute had been long ago decided, if the author's leisure  had permitted him to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16494"],[0,"The Transvaal from Within: A Private Record of Public Affairs (#14)"],[1,"was elected President, an office which he is now  holding for the third successive term.{06}    Prior to the war the population of the country was reckoned by both  Dutch and English authorities to be about 40,000 souls, the great  majority of whom were Dutch. The memorial addressed to Lord  Carnarvon, dated January 7, 1878, praying for repeal of the  annexation, was 'signed by 6,591 qualified electors out of a possible  8,000,' as is explained in the letter of the Transvaal delegates to  Sir M. Hicks-Beach dated July 10, 1878. The fact, already mentioned,  that 3,000 electors had petitioned for the annexation only means that  some of them changed their minds under pressure or conviction, and  helped to swell the number of those who later on petitioned for  repeal. The signatories to the above memorial would include  practically all the Dutch electors in the country, and the remaining  1,400 or so would probably be the non-Boer party who preferred  British rule, and could not be coerced into signing memorials against  it. These figures are useful as a check upon those now put forward by  the Transvaal Government to combat the assertion that the Uitlanders  outnumber the Boers. Recognizing the fact that the Boers are a  singularly domestic and prolific people, one may allow that  they numbered 35,000 out of the total population, an estimate that  will be seen to be extremely liberal. At the time that the above  figures were quoted by the Transvaal delegates every Boer youth over  the age of twenty-one was a qualified voter, so that it would seem  that the qualified Boer voter had an _average_ of one wife and 4.3  children, a fair enough allowance in all conscience. These figures  should be borne in mind, for the present Boer population consists of  what remains of these 35,000 souls and their natural increase during  eighteen years. There are other Dutch immigrants from the Cape  Colony and Free State: these are aliens, who have the invaluable  qualification of hating England and her sons and her ways and  her works; but, as will be made clear when the Franchise Law is  explained, the present Boer electorate consists-or, without fraud or  favouritism, _should_ consist-of the 'possible 8,000' and their  sons.    Many a champion of liberty has lived to earn the stigma of tyrant,  and the Boers who in 1835 had trekked for liberty and freedom from  oppressive rule, and who had fought for it in 1880, began now  themselves to put in force the principles which they had so stoutly  resisted. In the Volksraad Session of 1882 the first of the measures  of exclusion was passed. The Franchise, which until then-in  accordance with Law No. 1 of 1876-had been granted to anyone holding  property or residing in the State, or, failing the property  qualification, to anyone who had qualified by one year's residence,  was now altered, and Law No. 7 of 1882 was passed which provided that  aliens could become naturalized and enfranchised after five years'  residence, thus attaining the status of the oldest Voortrekker. The  feeling was now very strong against the Annexation Party, as they had  been called, that is to say, the men who had had the courage of their  convictions, and had openly advocated annexation; and as usual the  bitterest persecutors and vilifiers were found in the ranks of those  who, having secretly supported them before, had become suspect, and  had now need to prove their loyalty by their zeal. The intention was  avowed to keep the party pure and undiluted, as it was maintained  by many of the Boers that former proselytes had used their  newly-acquired privileges to vote away the independence of the  country. The view was not unnatural under the circumstances, and this  measure, had it not been a violation of pledges, might have found  defenders among impartial persons; but unfortunately it proved to  be not so much a stringently defensive measure which time and  circumstances might induce them to modify, as the first step in a  policy of absolute and perpetual exclusion. It was the first  deliberate violation of the spirit of the settlement, and, although  there is no clause in the Pretoria Convention which it can be said  to contravene, it was, as Mr. Chamberlain has since styled it, 'a  violation of the _status quo_ as it was present to the minds of her  Majesty's Ministers at the time the Convention was negotiated.' But  the Gladstone Ministry, which had paid so heavily to get rid of the  Transvaal question, was certainly not going to re-open it for the  sake of holding the Boers to the spirit of the settlement.    Another precaution was taken to keep all the power in the hands of  the Boers. The various towns which had formerly been entitled to  representation in Parliament were deprived of this right, and have  remained disfranchised ever since. Mr. Kruger feared that the  enlightened thought of the towns would hinder the growth of his  'national policy.'    It was not too late even at this time to have bloodlessly settled the  Transvaal question for ever by a fair but thoroughly firm attitude  towards the restored Republic. No doubt British Ministers, conscious  of an act of supreme self-restraint and magnanimity, believed that  some reciprocal justice would be evoked. At any rate, it is possible  that this was the reason which guided them, and not continued callous  indifference to the fate of British subjects and the future of South  Africa. In such case, however, they must have forgotten 'the fault of  the Dutch'--which Andrew Marvell's couplet has recorded--of 'giving  too little and asking too much.' The Transvaal Boers are very  practical people, and no matter what they may receive or how they get  it, whether by way of diplomacy or barter or the accident of good  luck or deed of gift, they never neglect to press and scheme for  more. It is an unpleasant feature in the Boer character, prominent  alike in personal and general relations, begotten, mayhap, of hard  life, constant struggle, and lack of education and its softening  and elevating influence. It is a feature which is common to all  uneducated peoples who have suffered great hardships, and it will no  doubt disappear in time; but it is one which has to be reckoned with  at the present day, and one which, when recognized at its true value,  sustains the contention that the Boers, in dealing with those whom  they regard as not of them, will recognise no right and do no justice  unless compelled to do so. The considerations of a narrow and selfish  policy are stronger than the sense of right and wrong.    British Ministers and the British people when glowing with a mildly  enthusiastic satisfaction at their tolerant and even generous  attitude towards a weaker opponent may imagine that they have sown  good seed which in time will bear ample fruit; but it is not so.  Nothing but firmness and strict justice will avert a bloody day of  reckoning. Nothing but prompt and effective veto on every attempt to  break or stretch the spirit of past undertakings will bring it home  to the Transvaal Government that all the give cannot be on the one  side and all the take on the other; that they cannot trade for ever  on the embarrassment of a big Power in dealing with a little one; and  that they must comport themselves with due regard to their  responsibilities.    Almost the first use made by the Transvaal Government of their  recovered power was one which has wrought much mischief to the State.  The Triumvirate who ruled the country in 1882 granted numbers of  concessions, ostensibly for the purpose of opening up industries or  developing mining areas. The real reasons are generally considered to  have been personal, and the result was the crushing of budding  activities, and the severe discouragement of those who were willing  to expend capital and energies in legitimate work. Favouritism pure  and simple dictated these grants. It is hardly too much to say that  the system and spirit then introduced rule to this day, for although  the Volksraad has taken definite resolution condemning the principle  of monopolies and contracts conferring preferential rights of any  sort, the spirit of this resolution is violated whenever the  President and Executive deem it fit to do so--witness, for instance,  the monopoly granted in December, 1895, for the free importation  of produce, which is disguised as a Government agency with a  'commission' to the agent; but it is really a monopoly and  nothing else!    The Boers were not satisfied with the Convention of 1881. They  desired the removal of the Suzerainty, the cancellation of the  clauses referring to natives, and the restoration of the title of the  South African Republic in lieu of that of the Transvaal State. They  also desired (but did not expect to obtain) complete freedom in  regard to their external relations, and they lost no time in trying  how far they would be allowed to go in the direction of stretching  the spirit of the Convention. Nothing in that ineffectual and  miserable document is clearer than the definition of certain  boundaries, and the provision that no extension shall be allowed.  This hemming of them in--or shutting them up in a kraal, as President  Kruger has expressively put it--was intensely repugnant to them. It  cut into one of the most deeply-rooted habits of the Boer. His method  of trek and expansion has been, to begin by making small hunting  excursions into adjacent native territories, to follow up with  grazing his cattle there until he created in his own mind a right by  prescription, and then to establish it either by force or else by  written agreement, too often imperfectly translated. This was  oftentimes varied or supplemented by helping the weaker of two rival  chiefs, and so demolishing the power of a tribe. The expulsion of the  native followed as a natural result.    In the Transvaal itself there was, and still is, an immense quantity  of unoccupied land, and"]]]
