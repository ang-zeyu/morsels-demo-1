As a father would interpose himself between his wife and children and an  attacking bulldog, so would a military commander provide a similar  protection for his camp. We see from this one of the big duties of an  outpost commander, i.e., especial attention should be devoted to the  direction from which the enemy (bulldog) is coming or is thought to be  coming, and a probably less degree of attention to other points.    Consider yourself a member of General Sherman's army during its march  from the North on Atlanta. You are to camp for the night on a very open  piece of ground. You do not know where the enemy is, but you believe  that he is somewhere south of you. The troops are tired. They have had a  long, hard march. Let us suppose it is your duty to provide the security  of the main body for the night. General Sherman has given you a certain  number of men for this purpose. Just how would you go about it?    Regardless of other considerations, it is imperative that your own main  force be not surprised or caught off guard by any contingency, however  exceptional. To secure this immunity, it is necessary to send men or  groups of men in the direction of the probable advance of the enemy,  anti to arrange these men or groups of men so that they can be of  assistance to each other. This we call forming an outpost.    It may be possible to have a line of protection extending around the  entire camp. It must be extended and arranged so as to keep the enemy so  far away from our main body that he cannot observe our numbers or our  position. The enemy must not be permitted to approach close enough to  the main body to annoy or surprise it. Experience shows that all of this  is best accomplished by placing: 1st, some groups or line of groups  farthest from our main body and closest to the enemy in order to  observe, to report the movements of the enemy, and, when necessary, to  make a temporary resistance; 2d, a line of resistance (\"supporting  groups\") called \"supports\" upon which the first line can retire before,  being swamped by superior numbers; 3d, large groups, or line of groups  (\"line of reserves\"), so located that they may go to the assistance of  the second line in case of necessity. Such arrangements may be  illustrated by the following diagram.

Rallying point for small groups in front.    Note that distances from the line of observation to the main body  increase as the groups increase in size. The reserves are the largest  groups. The groups on the Line of observation are the smallest.    It is most important to note that the groups are placed according to  the conditions and circumstances of the particular case. Don't follow  any blind rules. Your judgment must tell you when to place this group  here and not to place that group there. Have as few men on such duty as  practicable.    If a swamp, or a large body of water here, very small groups will  afford the necessary security.    If a forest, or steep hills here, very small parties will afford the  necessary security.    Assume that we want to afford security for our main body from any  especially dangerous sector such as ABC. Our cavalry is in front of our  first line and in touch with the enemy. The danger zone represents the  direction from which the enemy is expected.]    This plan must be modified according to the particular case. Let us  suppose that we are camping by a large body of water, or that we are  surrounded by mountains. We can easily imagine where we could change  the above general plan so as to give adequate protection and at the same  time lessen the number of men detailed for security. We must never  forget that men are generally tired when they arrive in camp, and that  we should make their work as light as circumstances permit. It requires  a nice judgment to choose the correct number for security.    We should know the names of these groups. Farthest away is the line that  sees, and reports what it sees, but can offer only a limited resistance.  This is called the \"line of observation\" or the \"line of outguards.\" In  rear of the line of outguards we have larger groups placed at greater  distances. These are called \"supports.\" This is the line that fights.  This is the line that makes extensive preparations for fighting (or  resisting). It is called the \"line of supports\" or the \"line of  resistance.\"[2] We have one farther and last line of groups which is  still larger and occupies still greater distances than the two we have  just discussed. This is the safety valve and is called the \"reserve,\" or  the \"line of reserves.\" This is the line that gives a sound factor of  safety. It will only be called upon in cases of emergency and may  therefore generally enjoy a considerable degree of repose. But it and  the line of supports combined must have sufficient strength to delay the  enemy, in case of a general attack, long enough for our main body to  form for battle.    Let us look at the line of outguards for further important  considerations and distinctions. The enemy's movements and operations  should ordinarily be expected where there are for him least  difficulties. Large (dangerous) bodies of troops find trouble in  marshes, thick forests, steep mountainous country. They avoid these  obstacles as much as possible, selecting open country, solid soil,  strong bridges, and good roads. Here is where large and strong groups in  opposition are necessary. Small and unimportant groups (or no groups at  all) should be placed where the enemy's advance is exceptionally  difficult. Finally, there will be places between these last two extremes  that require just an average amount of attention, that is to say,  require groups of medium strength.    The groups that are largest and are used at the important places where  danger is most expected, are called \"Pickets.\" (These consist of from  two squads of eight men each to eight squads.) The least important  groups are called \"Cossack Posts.\" (These consist of four men, usually a  noncommissioned officer and three privates.) The groups of average  importance are called \"Sentry Squads.\" (These consist of eight men, a  corporal and seven privates.)    Having discussed in broad terms the security of troops in camp, we are  prepared to consider their security while either advancing upon or  retreating from the enemy. In either case groups are placed between our  main body and the actual or supposed position of the hostile troops.  When we are advancing upon an enemy our advanced groups constitute what  we term the \"advance guard.\" If we are retreating from the enemy, our  rear groups compose the \"rear guard.\" The main general ideas of an  advance guard are illustrated by the husband who takes his wife and  family to his house after an evening's absence. The house is dark and  without occupants. The wife and children are apprehensive of danger. The  husband goes first, turns on the light, and searches for any indications  of an enemy. He looks, if desirable, in the closets and under the beds.  If there is any one that may harm his family it is his duty to find out  and dispose of him.    In the advance guard we have exactly the same general scheme as with  outposts. Far advanced to the front (and often to the sides or flanks)  we have small groups (called, when considered collectively, the \"advance  party\") whose business it is to inform us of the presence of the enemy.  Next we have a large group (\"support\") to assist these small and rather  helpless ones in advance in case of difficulty. And last we have a still  larger group (\"reserve\") that may be called upon in great emergencies.    We should fully understand that all these groups are out to accomplish  several ends, but their one great and ultimate object should be to push  on ahead of the main body so that it may be secure and its march  uninterrupted. To accomplish this it is desirable to get all possible  information about the enemy; it is also desirable to keep him from  getting any information about your own troops.    The ideas are nearly the same with rear guards. Note this important  difference: if, in an advance upon the enemy, your advance guard should  suddenly be fired upon, your main body would (temporarily) halt. If, in  a retreat, your rear guard is halted by the enemy's fire, your main body  would normally be marching farther from it. In the first case assistance  is near at hand. In the second it is withdrawing. The rear guard in a  retreat should therefore be a little larger than in an advance. It must  be able to extricate itself from any situation however difficult or it  loses its usefulness. Its commander should have a cool, level head. To  delay the enemy and thus assist the main body to escape is his mission.

Much must be known about the ancestry of the drunken  husband, and of the woman herself, before it can be certain that the  defective children owe their defect to alcoholism rather than to  heredity.    We can not undertake to review all the literature of this subject, for  it fills volumes, but we shall refer to a few of the studies which are  commonly cited, by the believers in the racial-poison character of  alcohol, as being the most weighty.    Taav Laitinen of Helsingfors secured information from the parents of  2,125 babies, who agreed to weigh their infants once a month for the  first eight months after birth, and who also furnished information about  their own drinking habits. His conclusion is that the average weight of  the abstainer's child is greater at birth, that these children develop  more rapidly during the first eight months than do the children of the  moderate drinker, and that the latter exceed in the same way the  children of the heavier drinker. But a careful analysis of his work by  Karl Pearson, whose great ability in handling statistics has thrown  light on many dark places in the alcohol problem, shows[21] that  Professor Laitinen's statistical methods were so faulty that no weight  can be attached to his conclusions. Furthermore, he appears to have  mixed various social classes and races together without distinction; and  he has made no distinction between parents, one of whom drank, and  parents, both of whom drank. Yet, this distinction, as we have pointed  out, is a critical one for such inquiries. Professor Laitinen's paper,  according to one believer in racial poisons, \"surpasses in magnitude and  precision all the many studies of this subject which have proved the  relation between drink and degeneracy.\" As a fact, it proves nothing of  the sort as to race degeneracy.    Again, T. A. MacNicholl reported on 55,000 American school children,  from 20,147 of whom he secured information about the parents' attitude  to alcoholic drinks. He found an extraordinarily large proportion (58%)  of deficient and backward children in the group. But the mere bulk of  his work, probably, has given it far more prestige than it deserves; for  his methods are careless, his classifications vague, his information  inadequate; he seems to have dealt with a degenerate section of the  population, which does not offer suitable material for testing the  question at issue; and he states that many of the children drank and  smoked,--hence, any defects found in them may be due to their own  intemperance, rather than that of their parents. In short, Dr.  MacNicholl's data offer no help in an attempt to decide whether  alcoholism is an inheritable effect.    Another supposed piece of evidence which has deceived a great many  students is the investigation of Bezzola into the distribution of the  birth-rate of imbeciles in Switzerland. He announced that in  wine-growing districts the number of idiots conceived at the time of the  vintage and carnival is very large, while at other periods it is almost  _nil_. The conclusion was that excesses of drunkenness occurring in  connection with the vintage and carnival caused this production of  imbeciles. But aside from the unjustified assumptions involved in his  reasoning, Professor Pearson has recently gone over the data and shown  the faulty statistical method; that, in fact, the number of imbeciles  conceived at vintage-time, in excess of the average monthly number, was  only three in spite of the large numbers! Bezzola's testimony, which has  long been cited as proof of the disastrous results of the use of alcohol  at the time of conception, must be discarded.    Demme's plausible investigation is also widely quoted to support the  belief that alcohol poisons the germ-plasm. He studied the offspring of  10 drunken and 10 sober pairs of parents, and found that of the 61  children of the latter, 50 were normal, while of the 57 progeny of the  drunkards, only nine were normal. This is a good specimen of much of the  evidence cited to prove that alcohol impairs the germ-plasm; it has been  widely circulated by propagandists in America during recent years. Of  course, its value depends wholly on whether the 20 pairs of parents were  of sound, comparable stock. Karl Pearson has pointed out that this is  not the case. Demme selected his children of drunkards by selecting  children who came to his hospital on account of imperfect development of  speech, mental defect, imbecility or idiocy. When he found families in  which such defective children occurred, he then inquired as to their  ancestry. Many of these children, he found, were reduced to a condition  approaching epilepsy, or actually epileptic, because they themselves  were alcoholic. Obviously such material can not legitimately be used to  prove that the use of alcohol by parents injures the heredity of their  children. The figures do not at all give the proof we are seeking, that  alcohol can so affect sound germ-plasm as to lead to the production of  defective children.    Dr. Bertholet made a microscopic examination of the reproductive glands  of 75 chronic male alcoholics, and in 37 cases he found them more or  less atrophied, and devoid of spermatozoa. Observing the same glands in  non-alcoholics who had died of various chronic diseases, such as  tuberculosis, he found no such condition. His conclusion is that the  reproductive glands are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol than  any other organ. So far as is known to us, his results have never been  discredited; they have, on the contrary, been confirmed by other  investigators. They are of great significance to eugenics, in showing  how the action of natural selection to purge the race of drunkards is  sometimes facilitated in a way we had not counted, through reduced  fertility due to alcohol, as well as through death due to alcohol. But  it should not be thought that his results are typical, and that all  chronic alcoholists become sterile: every reader will know of cases in  his own experience, where drunkards have large families; and the  experimental work with smaller animals also shows that long-continued  inebriety is compatible with great fecundity. It is probable that  extreme inebriety reduces fertility, but a lesser amount increases it in  the cases of many men by reducing the prudence which leads to limited  families.    In 1910 appeared the investigation of Miss Ethel M. Elderton and Karl  Pearson on school children in Edinburgh and Manchester.[22] Their aim  was to take a population under the same environmental conditions, and  with no discoverable initial differentiation, and inquire whether the  temperate and intemperate sections had children differing widely in  physique and mentality. Handling their material with the most refined  statistical methods, and in an elaborate way, they reached the  conclusion that parental alcoholism does not markedly affect the  physique or mentality of the offspring as children. Whether results  might differ in later life, their material did not show. Their  conclusions were as follows:    \"(1) There is a higher death-rate among the offspring of alcoholic than  among the offspring of sober parents. This appears to be more marked in  the case of the mother than in the case of the father, and since it is  sensibly higher in the case of the mother who has drinking bouts  [periodical sprees] than of the mother who habitually drinks, it would  appear to be due very considerably to accidents and gross carelessness  and possibly in a minor degree to toxic effect on the offspring.    \"Owing to the greater fertility of alcoholic parents, the net family of  the sober is hardly larger than the net family of the alcoholic. [It  should be remembered that the study did not include childless couples.]    \"(2) The mean weight and height of the children of alcoholic parents are  slightly greater than those of sober parents, but as the age of the  former children is slightly greater, the correlations when corrected for  age are slightly positive, i.e., there is slightly greater height and  weight in the children of the sober.\"    \"(3) The wages of the alcoholic as contrasted with the sober parent show  a slight difference compatible with the employers' dislike for an  alcoholic employee, but wholly inconsistent with a marked mental or  physical inferiority in the alcoholic parent.    \"(4) The general health of the children of alcoholic parents appears on  the whole slightly better than that of sober parents. There are fewer  delicate children, and in a most marked way cases of tuberculosis and  epilepsy are less frequent than among the children of sober parents. The  source of this relation may be sought in two directions; the physically  strongest in the community have probably the greatest capacity and taste  for alcohol. Further the higher death rate of the children of alcoholic  parents probably leaves the fittest to survive. Epilepsy and  tuberculosis both depending upon inherited constitutional conditions,  they will be more common in the parents of affected offspring, and  probably if combined with alcohol, are incompatible with any length of  life or size of family. If these views be correct, we can only say that  parental alcoholism has no marked effect on filial health.    \"(5) Parental alcoholism is not the source of mental defect in  offspring.    \"(6) The relationship, if any, between parental alcoholism and filial  intelligence is so slight that even its sign can not be determined from  the present material.    \"(7) The normal visioned and normal refractioned offspring appear to be  in rather a preponderance in the families of the drinking parents, the  parents who have 'bouts' give intermediate results, but there is no  substantial relationship between goodness of sight and parental  alcoholism. Some explanation was sought on the basis of alcoholic homes  driving the children out into the streets. This "]]]
