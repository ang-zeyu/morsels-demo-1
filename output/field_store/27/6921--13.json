If the  partition were not present, this motion would simply cause a mixing of the  liquids.    *Conditions under which Osmosis occurs.*--Osmosis may be shown by suitable  experiments (see Practical Work) to take place under the following  conditions:    1. The liquids on the two sides of the partition must be _unlike_ either  in density or in composition. Since the effect of the movement is to  reduce the liquids to the same condition, _a difference in density causes  the flow to be greater from the less dense toward the denser liquid_, than  in the opposite direction; while _a difference in composition causes the  substances in solution to move from the place of greater abundance toward  places of less abundance_.    2. The liquids must be capable of wetting, or penetrating, the partition.  If but one of the liquids penetrates the partition, the flow will be in  but one direction.    3. The liquids on the two sides of the partition must readily mix with  each other.    *Osmosis at the Cells.*--In the body osmosis takes place between the blood  and the lymph and between the lymph and the cells, the movements being  through the capillary walls and the membranes inclosing the cells (Fig.  27). Oxygen and food materials, which are found in great abundance in the  blood, are less abundant in the lymph and still less abundant in the  cells. According to the principle of osmosis, the main flow of oxygen and  food is from the capillaries toward the cells. On the other hand, the  wastes are most abundant in the cells where they are formed, less abundant  in the lymph, and least abundant in the blood. Hence the wastes flow from  the cells toward the capillaries.    *Solutions.*--Neither the blood plasma nor the lymph, as already shown, are  simple liquids; but they consist of water and different substances  dissolved in the water. They belong to a class of substances called  _solutions_. The chief point of interest about substances in solution is  that they are very finely divided and that their little particles are free  to move about in the liquid that contains them. Both the motion and the  finely divided condition of the dissolved substances are necessary to the  process of osmosis. All substances, however, that appear to be in solution  are not able to penetrate membranes, or take part in osmosis.    *Kinds of Solutions in the Body.*--The substances in solution in the body  liquids are of two general kinds known as _colloids_ and _crystalloids_.  The crystalloids are able to pass through membranous partitions, while the  colloids are not. An example of a colloid is found in the albumin of an  egg, which is unable to penetrate the membrane which surrounds it.  Examples of crystalloids are found in solutions of salt and sugar in  water. The inability of a colloid to penetrate a membrane is due to the  fact that it does not form a true solution. Its particles (molecules),  instead of being completely separated, still cling together, forming  little masses that are too large to penetrate the membrane. Since,  however, it has the appearance, on being mixed with water, of being  dissolved, it is called a _colloidal solution_. The crystalloid substance,  on the other hand, completely separates in the water and forms a _true  solution_--one which is able to penetrate the partition or membrane.    *Osmosis not a Sufficient Cause.*--The passage of materials through animal  membranes, according to the principle of osmosis, is limited to  crystalloid substances. But colloid substances are also known to pass  through the various partitions of the body. An example of such is found in  the proteids of the blood which, as a colloidal solution, pass through the  capillary walls to become a part of the lymph. Perhaps the best  explanation offered as yet for this passage is that the colloidal  substances are changed by the cells lining the capillaries into substances  that form true solutions and that after the passage they are changed back  again to the colloidal condition.    *Summary.*--Between the cells and the capillaries is a liquid, known as the  lymph, which is similar in composition and physical properties to the  blood. It consists chiefly of escaped plasma. The vessels that contain it  are connected with the system for the circulation of the blood. By adding  new material to the lymph and withdrawing waste material from it, the  blood keeps this liquid in a suitable condition for supplying the needs of  the cells. Supplementing each other in all respects, the blood and the  lymph together form the nutrient cell fluid of the body. The interchange  of material between the blood and the lymph, and the lymph and the cells,  takes place in part according to the principle of osmosis.    *Exercises.*--1. Explain the necessity for the lymph in the body.    2. Compare lymph and water with reference to density, color, and  complexity of composition.    3. Compare lymph and blood with reference to color, composition, and  movement through the body.    4. Show how blood pressure in the capillaries causes a flow of the lymph.    5. Show how contracting muscles cause the lymph to move. Compare with the  effect of muscular contraction upon the blood in the veins.    6. Trace the lymph in its flow from the right hand to where it enters the  blood; from the feet to where it enters the blood.    7. What conditions prevail at the cells to cause a movement of food and  oxygen in one direction and of waste materials in the opposite direction?    8. What part does water play in the exchanges at the cells?    9. Show that the blood and the lymph together fulfill all the requirements  of a nutrient cell fluid in the body.        PRACTICAL WORK      *To illustrate the Effect of Breathing upon the Flow of Lymph.*--Tightly  holding one end of a glass tube between the lips, let the other end extend  into water in a tumbler on a table. In this position quickly inhale air  through the nostrils, noting that with each inhalation there is a slight  movement of the water up the tube. (No sucking action should be exerted by  the mouth.) Apply to the movements in the large blood and lymph vessels  entering the thoracic cavity.    *To illustrate Osmosis.*--1. Separate the shell from the lining membrane at  one end of an egg, over an area about one inch in diameter. To do this  without injuring the membrane, the shell must first be broken into small  pieces and then picked off with a pair of forceps, or a small knife blade.  Fit a small glass tube, eight or ten inches long, into the other end so  that it will penetrate the membrane and pass down into the yolk. Securely  fasten the tube to the shell by melting beeswax around it, and set the egg  in a small tumbler partly filled with water. Examine in the course of half  an hour. What evidence now exists that the water has passed through the  membrane?    2. Tie over the large end of a \"thistle tube\" (used by chemists) a thin  animal membrane, such as a piece of the pericardium or a strip of the  membrane from around a sausage. Then fill the bulb and the lower end of  the tube with a concentrated solution of some solid, such as sugar, salt,  or copper sulphate. Suspend in a vessel of water so that the liquid which  it contains is just on a level with the water in the vessel. Examine from  time to time, looking for evidence of a movement in each direction through  the membrane. Why should the movement of the water into the tube be  greater than the movement in the opposite direction? (If the thistle tube  has a very slender stem, it is better to fill the bulb before tying on the  membrane. The opening in the stem may be plugged during the process of  filling.)                                    [Fig. 32]                               Fig. 32--An osmosometer.      NOTE.--With a special piece of apparatus, known as an _osmosometer_, the  principle of osmosis may be more easily illustrated than by the method in  either of the above experiments (Fig. 32). This apparatus may be obtained  from supply houses.          CHAPTER VII - RESPIRATION      Through the movements of the blood and the lymph, materials entering the  body are transported to the cells, and wastes formed at the cells are  carried to the organs which remove them from the body. We are now to  consider the passage of materials from outside the body to the cells and  _vice versa_. One substance which the body constantly needs is oxygen, and  one which it is constantly throwing off is carbon dioxide. Both of these  are constituents of    *The Atmosphere.*--The atmosphere, or air, completely surrounds the earth  as a kind of envelope, and comes in contact with everything upon its  surface. It is composed chiefly of oxygen and nitrogen,(29) but it also  contains a small per cent of other substances, such as water-vapor, carbon  dioxide, and argon. All of the regular constituents of the atmosphere are  gases, and these, as compared with liquids and solids, are very light.  Nevertheless the atmosphere has weight and, on this account, exerts  pressure upon everything on the earth. At the sea level, its pressure is  nearly fifteen pounds to the square inch. The atmosphere forms an  essential part of one's physical environment and serves various purposes.  The process by which gaseous materials are made to pass between the body  and the atmosphere is known as    *Respiration.*--As usually defined, respiration, or breathing, consists of  two simple processes--that of taking air into special contrivances in the  body, called the lungs, and that of expelling air from the lungs. The  first process is known as _inspiration_; the second as _expiration_. We  must, however, distinguish between respiration by the lungs, called  _external respiration_, and respiration by the cells, called _internal  respiration_.    _The purpose of respiration_ is indicated by the changes that take place  in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18790"],[0,"The Insect Folk (#14)"],[1,"we dislike them so is  because of this offensive odor.    Some species of crickets, too, and indeed many, many insects give forth  odors from glands that exist just for that purpose.    No, indeed, these odors are not all alike. Some have a strangling  quality like ammonia, and sometimes the odors are not disagreeable. Some  insects have sweet odors, like perfumes.    [Illustration]    The pleasant odors are not used to repel, but to attract.    If an insect wishes to see its mate, it may be able to give forth a  pleasant odor that will reach a long way through the air, and the mate,  smelling it, will follow it to its source. You see, this pleasant odor  is one way of talking; at least it is one way of sending a message.    Insects can detect odors much better than we can.    No doubt many insects produce odors that affect other insects, but that  are so faint we cannot smell them at all.    The sense of smell, even in the human being, is very wonderful. It is  the keenest of all the senses.    You have studied weights and measures, and you know how small a quantity  a grain of anything is. Well, you will be astonished to know that your  nose can detect the presence of 1/2,760,000,000 of a grain of mercaptan,  a substance having a very bad smell.    [Illustration]    So you see, insects that can smell very, very much better than we would  be greatly influenced by the odors of other insects.    Some of the stink bugs, although so disagreeable if disturbed, are very  useful to us, as they eat other insects injurious to vegetation.    Most of them, however, eat fruits and vegetables, and some species do a  vast amount of mischief.          THE LOUSE      Yes, John, lice are bugs, and very mean bugs too.    They have lived at the expense of other creatures so long that they  cannot exist unless they have a living body to feed on.    Here is a picture of one very much enlarged. No wings, no beauty, a pale  white thing, all claws and mouth.    [Illustration]    It has a long sucking tube by which it pierces the skin, and a sucking  stomach by which it pumps the blood into its mouth.    Such creatures are called parasites.    Yes, bed bugs are parasites too.    Besides the lice that live on human beings, there are species that  infest animals.          BIRD LICE AND BOOK LICE      Bird lice are not lice!    That is, they do not belong to the bug order.    They belong to a small order by themselves, but they are parasites like  the lice.    The little white book lice that scurry away when we open an old book  that has been standing on the back shelf, are not lice, either; they  also belong to a little order of their own, and are constructed very  differently from the true lice.          FRIEND CICADA      WHIR-R-R-R-RRRRR!!    May says she wishes that locust would keep quiet. It makes her warmer  than ever to hear him carrying on so this hot day.    John says it is the weather that is warm, not the song of the locust.    And yet, locusts generally sing during the hottest part of the summer,  so that we have learned to associate them with warm weather.    Since we must listen to its shrill out-cry, I wish we could also see  it.    Ah, that is a wish soon gratified! Here comes one out of John's pocket.    [Illustration]    John says it is _not_ a locust.    Ah, yes, the shorthorned grasshoppers are the real locusts, and this  fellow has somehow got the name.    But it is not a locust.    It is also called the dog-day harvest fly, but it is not a fly, though  it looks considerably like one.    Really, you know, it is a--bug!    Yes, it belongs to the bug order.    Its true name is cicada, and its shrill midsummer song has been famous  from the beginning of time.    [Illustration]    It looks like an enormous fly, but its mouth parts are the mouth parts  of the bug, and in other respects it resembles the members of the bug  order, when it is examined closely.    What glassy wings!    Let us spread them out carefully. Four of them it has.    The cicada, you see, has no wing covers. Nor are its upper wings, half  wing cover, and half wing, like those of so many of the bugs.    No, all four of its wings are alike, and all four are flying wings.    When it is at rest, the inner wings slip out of sight under the outer  ones, which fold down like a roof over its body.    See how beautifully the wings, are veined.    You think cicada has a very broad back, Nell?    So it has, and a broad head.    [Illustration]    See its black eyes on the corners of its head!    How many facets have its eyes?    I wish I knew, but I do not. This, however, I can tell you. If you look  on the top of its head between its compound eyes, with a magnifying  glass, you will find it has three little eyes there.    These small eyes are simple, and are called _ocelli_.    Many insects have ocelli, indeed, some of the grasshoppers have these  extra eyes on top of their head.    May says the grasshoppers are very astonishing insects.    You think you know all about them, and you are all the time finding out  something new. You would not be apt to notice these little ocelli on the  grasshopper's head, they are so small, and besides, some of the  grasshoppers do not have them.    Yes, Mollie, it is the same with the crickets and katydids. Some species  have ocelli, and some have not.    If you look full in the face of a cicada, you can see the three little  round ocelli between the compound eyes.    [Illustration]    They show very plainly with a magnifying glass.    Indeed, it is difficult to explain what the ocelli are for.    Some think they are to see objects close at hand, while the compound  eyes see more distant objects.    Others think the ocelli are only capable of distinguishing light from  darkness.    Yet others think they are merely a \"survival\" of the eyes of the worms.  You know, way back in time, before there were winged insects there were  worms. In some way the insects are descended from the worms, and though  they have got rid of many of their wormlike parts they still retain some  of them, and probably among these are the ocelli.    When an animal of any kind keeps organs that belonged to its ancestors,  but that are of no use to it, we say these organs are \"survivals.\" They  have not yet had time wholly to disappear.    Yes, John, the time may come when the ocelli will disappear from the  insects. A good many insects have lost them already.    Indeed, you are right, May; they have lost them because they did not use  them. When an animal ceases to use an organ in course of time, for lack  of exercise, that organ dwindles away and disappears. It generally takes  a very long time for this to happen.    Yes, Mabel, thousands or even millions of years may pass before an organ  that has gone out of use entirely disappears. As generations succeed  each other each generation loses a little power in that organ until,  finally, there is no organ left.    John is puzzled to know just what is meant by an organ. It is some  particular part of the creature. An arm is an organ, a stomach is an  organ, an eye is an organ. The whole creature is made up of organs, and  is called an _organism_.    Your whole body, John, is an organism, but your legs and arms are  organs. Now, I think you understand.    Our cicada has one organ that is very interesting; it is the little  apparatus by which it sings.    Turn it over, Ned, and all of you look at the two thin plates lying  against the abdomen just below the thorax.    Those membranes are like two little kettle drums, and they are its song  organs.    There are other membranes beneath them, and large muscles within the  body to move the membranes.    The membranes being set in rapid vibration we get the shrill cry of the  locust.    Only the male has the kettle drums. In the female these organs are  rudimentary, and she is dumb.    [Illustration]    Cicada, you are a pretty little thing with your clear, glasslike wings  and your black body with red and green trimming. See its mouth lying in  that little groove under its head. It is a tube, and sharp. The cicada  sticks it into a leaf or young twig to suck out the juice.    Nell wants to know if the young cicadas are like the old ones. Indeed,  they would be cunning little things if they were, and--yes, they _would_  look very much like flies.    But the young cicadas are queer babies, indeed. They do not look very  much like their parents, although they have a head, a thorax, and an  abdomen.    [Illustration]    The female cicada makes a slit in the bark of the tree twig with her  ovipositor and lays the eggs there. As soon as they hatch out, the tiny  cicadas drop down to the ground and burrow into the earth.    You would not know that they are cicadas, they are such queer-looking  little things. But they have strong, sucking mouth parts with which they  pierce holes in the roots of trees and suck out the juices.    Of course these larvae grow and moult and continue to do so until they  have moulted a good many times and grown quite large.    They stay down under the ground two years.    At the end of that time they crawl up to the surface of the earth in the  early summer.    They climb trees, or weeds, or fence posts, and then the skin splits  down the back for the last time, and out comes a full-grown cicada with  bright glassy wings.    The wings of the larva do not grow at each moult like the wings of the  grasshopper.    The larva never gets beyond short little wing pads. See John's eyes  twinkling! I believe--yes, he has! He has brought us the cast-off skin  of a cicada to look at.    [Illustration]    Why, John, you are like a good fairy to us to-day, giving us just the  things we want just when we want them.    Now, see this little shell. See the front legs, like strong paws to dig  with. And see its little glassy eyes, and its little wing pads!    It is a perfect cast of the cicada larva.    Yes, May, this little cast is made of chitin, and"]]]
