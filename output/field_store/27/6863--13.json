They had applied  themselves zealously to the study of Egyptian arts, industry and  religion, and had borrowed from these as much, at least, as they had  lent to the dwellers on the Nile. The ancient Babylonian foundation  of their civilization was not, indeed, seriously modified, but it was  covered over, so to speak, with an African veneer which varied in depth  according to the locality.*         * Most of the views put forth in this part of the chapter       are based on posterior and not contemporary data. The most       ancient monuments which give evidence of it show it in such       a complete state that we may fairly ascribe it to some       centuries earlier; that is, to the time when Egypt still       ruled in Syria, the period of the XIXth and even the XVIIIth       dynasty.    Phoenicia especially assumed and retained this foreign exterior. Its  merchants, accustomed to establish themselves for lengthened periods in  the principal trade-centres on the Nile, had become imbued therein  with something of the religious ideas and customs of the land, and  on returning to their own country had imported these with them and  propagated them in their neighbourhood. They were not content with other  household utensils, furniture, and jewellery than those to which they  had been accustomed on the Nile, and even the Phonician gods seemed to  be subject to this appropriating mania, for they came to be recognised  in the indigenous deities of the Said and the Delta. There was, at  the outset, no trait in the character of Baalat by which she could be  assimilated to Isis or Hathor: she was fierce, warlike, and licentious,  and wept for her lover, while the Egyptian goddesses were accustomed  to shed tears for their husbands only. It was this element of a common  grief, however, which served to associate the Phonician and Egyptian  goddesses, and to produce at length a strange blending of their persons  and the legends concerning them; the lady of Byblos ended in becoming an  Isis or a Hathor,* and in playing the part assigned to the latter in the  Osirian drama.    * The assimilation must have been ancient, since the Egyptians of the  Theban dynasties already accepted Baalat as the Hathor of Byblos.    [Illustration: 101.jpg THE TREE GROWING ON THE TOMB OF OSIRIS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Prisse d'Avennes    This may have been occasioned by her city having maintained closer  relationships than the southern towns with Buto and Mendes, or by her  priests having come to recognise a fundamental agreement between their  theology and that of Egypt. In any case, it was at Byblos that the most  marked and numerous, as well as the most ancient, examples of borrowing  from the religions of the Nile were to be found. The theologians of  Byblos imagined that the coffin of Osiris, after it had been thrown into  the sea by Typhon, had been thrown up on the land somewhere near their  city at the foot of a tamarisk, and that this tree, in its rapid growth,  had gradually enfolded within its trunk the body and its case. King  Malkander cut it down in order to use it as a support for the roof of  his palace: a marvellous perfume rising from it filled the apartments,  and it was not long before the prodigy was bruited abroad. Isis, who was  travelling through the world in quest of her husband, heard of it, and  at once realised its meaning: clad in rags and weeping, she sat down  by the well whither the women of Byblos were accustomed to come every  morning and evening to draw water, and, being interrogated by them,  refused to reply; but when the maids of Queen Astarte* approached  in their turn, they were received by the goddess in the most amiable  manner--Isis deigning even to plait their hair, and to communicate to  them the odour of myrrh with which she herself was impregnated.         * Astarte is the name taken by the queen in the Phoenician       version: the Egyptian counterpart of the same narrative       substituted for it Nemanous or Saosis; that is to say, the       two principal forms of Hathor--the Hermopolitan Nahmauit and       the Heliopolitan lusasit. It would appear from the presence       of these names that there must have been in Egypt two       versions at least of the Phoenician adventures of Isis--the       one of Hermopolitan and the other of Heliopolitan origin.    Their mistress came to see the stranger who had thus treated her  servants, took her into her service, and confided to her the care of her  lately born son. Isis became attached to the child, adopted it for her  own, after the Egyptian manner, by inserting her finger in its mouth;  and having passed it through the fire during the night in order to  consume away slowly anything of a perishable nature in its body,  metamorphosed herself into a swallow, and flew around the miraculous  pillar uttering plaintive cries. Astarte came upon her once while she  was bathing the child in the flame, and broke by her shrieks of  fright the charm of immortality. Isis was only able to reassure her by  revealing her name and the object of her presence there. She opened the  mysterious tree-trunk, anointed it with essences, and wrapping it in  precious cloths, transmitted it to the priests of Byblos, who deposited  it respectfully in their temple: she put the coffin which it contained  on board ship, and brought it, after many adventures, into Egypt.  Another tradition asserts, however, that Osiris never found his way back  to his country: he was buried at Byblos, this tradition maintained, and  it was in his honour that the festivals attributed by the vulgar to the  young Adonis were really celebrated. A marvellous fact seemed to support  this view. Every year a head of papyrus, thrown into the sea at some  unknown point of the Delta, was carried for six days along the Syrian  coast, buffeted by wind and waves, and on the seventh was thrown up at  Byblos, where the priests received it and exhibited it solemnly to the  people.* The details of these different stories are not in every case  very ancient, but the first fact in them carries us back to the time  when Byblos had accepted the sovereignty of the Theban dynasties,  and was maintaining daily commercial and political relations with the  inhabitants of the Nile valley.**         * In the later Roman period it was letters announcing the       resurrection of Adonis-Osiris that the Alexandrian women       cast into the sea, and these were carried by the current as       far as Byblos. See on this subject the commentaries of Cyril       of Alexandra and Procopius of Gaza on chap, xviii. of       Isaiah.         ** It is worthy of note that Philo gives to the divinity       with the Egyptian name Taautos the part in the ancient       history of Phoenicia of having edited the mystic writings       put in order by Sanchoniathon at a very early epoch.    The city proclaimed Horus to be a great god.* El-Kronos allied himself  with Osiris as well as with Adonis; Isis and Baalat became blended  together at their first encounter, and the respective peoples made  an exchange of their deities with the same light-heartedness as they  displayed in trafficking with the products of their soil or their  industry.         * This is confirmed by one of the names inscribed on the Tel       el-Amarna tablets as being that of a governor of Byblos       under Amenothes IV. This name was read Rabimur, Anrabimur,       or Ilrabimur, and finally Ilurabihur: the meaning of it is,       \"Muru is the great god,\" or \"Horus is the great god.\" Muru is       the name which we find in an appellation of a Hittite king,       Maurusaru, \"Mauru is king.\" On an Aramoan cylinder in the       British Museum, representing a god in Assyrian dress       fighting with two griffins, there is the inscription       \"Horkhu,\" Harmakhis.    [Illustration: 104.jpg THE PHOENICIAN HORUS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from an intaglio engraved in       Cesnola. The Phoenician figures of Horus and Thot which I       have reproduced were pointed out to me by my friend       Clermont-Ganneau.    After Osiris, the Ibis Thot was the most important among the deities  who had emigrated to Asia. He was too closely connected with the Osirian  cycle to be forgotten by the Phoenicians after they had adopted his  companions. We are ignorant of the particular divinity with whom he was  identified, or would be the more readily associated from some similarity  in the pronunciation of his name: we know only that he still preserved  in his new country all the power of his voice and all the subtilty of  his mind. He occupied there also the position of scribe and enchanter,  as he had done at Thebes, Memphis, Thinis, and before the chief of each  Heliopolitan Ennead. He became the usual adviser of El-Kronos at Byblos,  as he had been of Osiris and Horus; he composed charms for him,  and formulae which increased the warlike zeal of his partisans; he  prescribed the form and insignia of the god and of his attendant  deities, and came finally to be considered as the inventor of letters.*         * The part of counsellor which Thot played in connexion with       the god of Byblos was described at some length in the       writings attributed to Sankhoniathon.    [Illustration: 105.jpg THE PHOENICIAN THOT]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after an intaglio engraved in M. de       Vogue.    The epoch, indeed, in which he became a naturalised Phoenician coincides  approximately with a fundamental revolution in the art of writing--that  in which a simple and rapid stenography was substituted for the  complicated and tedious systems with which the empires of the ancient  world had been content from their origin.

[Illustration: 080.jpg End of the Harvest--Cutting Straw]    History does not record who were the former possessors of this land;  but towards the middle of the ninth century it was divided into several  principalities, whose position and boundaries cannot be precisely  determined. It is thought that Urartu lay on either side of Mount Ararat  and on both banks of the Araxes, that Biainas lay around Lake Van,*  and that the Mannai occupied the country to the north and east of  Lake Urumiah;** the positions of the other tribes on the different  tributaries of the Euphrates or the slopes of the Armenian mountains are  as yet uncertain.         * Urartu is the only name by which the Assyrians knew the       kingdom of Van; it has been recognised from the very       beginning of Assyriological studies, as well as its identity       with the Ararat of the Bible and the Alarodians of       Herodotus. It was also generally recognised that the name       Biainas in the Vannic inscriptions, which Hincks read Bieda,       corresponded to the Urartu of the Assyrians, but in       consequence of this mistaken reading, efforts have been made       to connect it with Adiabene. Sayce was the first to show       that Biainas was the name of the country of Van, and of the       kingdom of which Van was the capital; the word Bitani which       Sayce connects with it is not a secondary form of the name       of Van, but a present day term, and should be erased from       the list of geographical names.         ** The Mannai are the Minni of Jeremiah (li. 27), and it is       in their country of Minyas that one tradition made the ark       rest after the Deluge.    The country was probably peopled by a very mixed race, for its mountains  have always afforded a safe asylum for refugees, and at each migration,  which altered the face of Western Asia, some fugitives from neighbouring  nations drifted to the shelter of its fastnesses.    [Illustration: 082.jpg THE KINGDOM OF URATU]    The principal element, the Khaldi, were akin to that great family of  tribes which extended across the range of the Taurus, from the shores of  the Mediterranean to the Euxine, and included the Khalybes, the Mushku,  the Tabal, and the Khati. The little preserved of their language  resembles what we know of the idioms in use among the people of Arzapi  and Mitanni, and their religion seems to have been somewhat analogous  to the ancient worship of the Hittites. The character of the ancient  Armenians, as revealed to us by the monuments, resembles in its main  features that of the Armenians of the present time. They appear as tall,  strong, muscular, and determined, full of zest for work and fighting,  and proud of their independence.    [Illustration: 083.jpg FRAGMENT OF A VOTIVE SHIELD OF URARTIAN WORK]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Hormuzd Rassam.    Some of them led a pastoral life, wandering about with their flocks  during the greater part of the year, obliged to seek pasturage in  valley, forest, or mountain height according to the season, while in  winter they remained frost-bound in semi-subterranean dwellings similar  to those in which descendants immure themselves at the present day.  Where the soil lent itself to agriculture, they proved excellent  husbandmen, and obtained abundant crops. Their ingenuity in irrigation  was remarkable, and enabled them to bring water by a system of trenches  from distant springs to supply their fields and gardens; besides which,  they knew how to terrace the steep hillsides so as to prevent the rapid  draining away of moisture. Industries were but little developed among  them, except perhaps the working of metals; for were they not akin to  those Chalybes of the Pontus, whose mines and forges already furnished  iron to the Grecian world? Fragments have been discovered in the  ruined cities of Urartu of statuettes, cups, and votive shields, either  embossed or engraved, and decorated with concentric bands of animals  or men, treated in the Assyrian manner, but displaying great beauty of  style and remarkable finish of execution.    [Illustration: 084.jpg SITE OF AN URARTIAN TOWN AT TOPRAH-KALEH]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by M. Binder.    Their towns were generally fortified or perched on heights, rendering  them easy of defence, as, for example, Van and Toprah-Kaleh. Even such  towns as were royal residences were small, and not to be compared with  the cities of Assyria or Aram; their ground-plan generally assumed the  form of a rectangular oblong, not always traced with equal exactitude.    [Illustration: 085.jpg THE RUINS OF A PALACE OF URARTU AT TOPRAH-KALEH]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Hormuzd Rassam.    The walls were built of blocks of roughly hewn stone, laid in regular  courses, but without any kind of mortar or cement; they were surmounted  by battlements, and flanked at intervals by square towers, at the foot  of which were outworks to protect the points most open to attack.  The entrance was approached by narrow and dangerous pathways, which  sometimes ran on ledges across the precipitous face of the rock. The  dwelling-houses were of very simple construction, being merely square  cabins of stone or brick, devoid of any external ornament, and pierced  by one low doorway, but sometimes surmounted by an open colonnade  supported by a row of small pillars; a flat roof with a parapet crowned  the whole, though this was often replaced by a gabled top, which was  better adapted to withstand the rains and snows of winter. The palaces  of the chiefs differed from the private houses in the size of their  apartments and the greater care bestowed upon their decoration. Their  facades were sometimes adorned with columns, and ornamented with  bucklers or carved discs of metal; slabs of stone covered with  inscriptions lined the inner halls, but we do not know whether the  kings added to their dedications to the gods and the recital of their  victories, pictures of the battles they had fought and of the fortresses  they had destroyed. The furniture resembled that in the houses of  Nineveh, but was of simpler workmanship, and perhaps the most valuable  articles were imported from Assyria or were of Aramaean manufacture.  The temples seemed to have differed little from the palaces, at least  in external appearance. The masonry was more regular and more skilfully  laid; the outer court was filled with brazen lavers and statues; the  interior was furnished with altars, sacrificial stones, idols in human  or animal shape, and bowls identical with those in the sanctuaries on  the Euphrates, but the nature and details of the rites in which they  were employed are unknown. One supreme deity, Khaldis, god of the sky,  was, as far as we can conjecture, the protector of the whole nation,  and their name was derived from his, as that of the Assyrians was from  Assur, the Cossaeans from Kashshu, and the Khati from Khatu.    [Illustration: 086.jpg TEMPLE OF KHALDIS AT MUZAZIR]    This deity was assisted in the government of the universe by Teisbas,  god of the air, and Ardinis the sun-god. Groups of secondary deities  were ranged around this sovereign triad--Auis, the water; Ayas, the  earth; Selardis, the moon; Kharubainis, Irmusinis, Adarutas, and  Arzi-melas: one single inscription enumerates forty-six, but some of  these were worshipped in special localities only.    [Illustration: 089.jpg ASSYRIAN SOLDIERS CARRYING OFF OR DESTROYING THE  FURNITURE OF AN URARTIAN TEMPLE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Botta. Scribes are weighing       gold, and soldiers destroying the statue of a god with their       axes.    It would appear as if no goddesses were included in the native Pantheon.  Saris, the only goddess known to us at present, is probably merely a  variant of the Ishtar of Nineveh or Arbela, borrowed from the Assyrians  at a later date.    The first Assyrian conquerors looked upon these northern regions as an  integral part of Nairi, and included them under that name. They knew of  no single state in the district whose power might successfully withstand  their own, but were merely acquainted with a group of hostile provinces  whose internecine conflicts left them ever at the mercy of a foreign  foe.* Two kingdoms had, however, risen to some importance about the  beginning of the ninth century--that of the Mannai in the east, and that  of Urartu in the centre of the country. Urartu comprised the district  of Ararat proper, the province of Biaina, and the entire basin of the  Arzania.         * The single inscription of Tiglath-pileser I. contains a       list of twenty-three kings of Nairi, and mentions sixty       chiefs of the same country.    [Illustration: 090.jpg SHALMANESEE III. CROSSING THE MOUNTAINS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bas-reliefs on the       bronze gates of Balawat.    Arzashkun, one of its capitals, situated probably near the sources of  this river, was hidden, and protected against attack, by an extent of  dense forest almost impassable to a regular army. The power of this  kingdom, though as yet unorganised, had already begun to inspire the  neighbouring states with uneasiness. Assur-nazir-pal speaks of it  incidentally as lying on the northern frontier of his empire,* but the  care he took to avoid arousing its hostility shows the respect in which  he held it.         * Arzashku, Arzashkun, seems to be the Assyrian form of an       Urartian name ending in _-ka_, formed from a proper name       Arzash, which recalls the name Arsene, Arsissa, applied by       the ancients to part of Lake Van. Arzashkun might represent       the Ardzik of the Armenian historians, west of Malasgert.    He was, indeed, as much afraid of Urartu as of Damascus, and though  he approached quite close to its boundary in his second campaign, he  preferred to check his triumphant advance rather than risk"]]]
