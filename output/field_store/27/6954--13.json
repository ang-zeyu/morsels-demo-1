Haifa, Palestine,  January 4th, 1924.          Letter of February 23, 1924.      To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout  America.    My dear fellow-workers:    I gather from various sources that the Cause of Baha'u'llah, in the course  of its sure yet toilsome march towards the salvation of the world, has  encountered of late further obstacles, which in the eyes of some appear to  retard its progress and hinder its growth. I have learned with feelings of  sadness and surprise that some vague sense of apprehension, a strange  misconception of its immediate purpose and methods, is slowly gaining  ground, steadily affecting its wholesome growth and vigorous development  throughout the continent.    Though such signs should appear from time to time, and however  unrepresentative they be of the vast and growing mass of its convinced and  zealous supporters, the world over, what, I wonder, could have caused this  uneasiness of mind? Are such misgivings possible, though on the part of  but a few, in the face of the remarkable manifestations of so remarkable a  movement? To what extent do they form a part of those mental tests and  trials destined at various times by the Almighty to stir and reinvigorate  the body of His Cause, and how far are they traceable to our imperfect  state of understanding, to our weaknesses and failings?          Divine Destiny and Human Frailty      That the Cause of God should, in the days to come, witness many a  challenging hour and pass through critical stages in preparation for the  glories of its promised ascendancy in the new world has been, time and  again, undeniably affirmed by our departed Master, and is abundantly  proved to us all by its heroic past and turbulent history. And yet, if it  is the lot of the chosen ones of God, the people of Baha, to face  adversity and suffer tribulation before achieving ultimate victory, are we  to believe that whatever befalls us is divinely ordained, and in no wise  the result of our faint-heartedness and negligence?    Surely now, if ever, is the time to turn our eyes inwardly, to bestir  ourselves, to invoke the Most Great Name, and standing together, summon to  our aid and support all the faith, the strength, and the courage that we  shall need to meet our pressing obligations and discharge our trust.          The Plight of Mankind      The plight of mankind, the condition and circumstances under which we live  and labor are truly disheartening, and the darkness of prejudice and  ill-will enough to chill the stoutest heart. Disillusion and dismay are  invading the hearts of peoples and nations, and the hope and vision of a  united and regenerated humanity is growing dimmer and dimmer every day.  Time-honored institutions, cherished ideals, and sacred traditions are  suffering in these days of bewildering change, from the effects of the  gravest onslaught, and the precious fruit of centuries of patient and  earnest labor is faced with peril. Passions, supposed to have been curbed  and subdued, are now burning fiercer than ever before, and the voice of  peace and good-will seems drowned amid unceasing convulsions and turmoil.  What, let us ask ourselves, should be our attitude as we stand under the  all-seeing eye of our vigilant Master, gazing at a sad spectacle so  utterly remote from the spirit which He breathed into the world? Are we to  follow in the wake of the wayward and the despairing? Are we to allow our  vision of so unique, so enduring, so precious a Cause to be clouded by the  stain and dust of worldly happenings, which, no matter how glittering and  far-reaching in their immediate effects, are but the fleeting shadows of  an imperfect world? Are we to be carried away by the flood of hollow and  conflicting ideas, or are we to stand, unsubdued and unblemished, upon the  everlasting rock of God's Divine Instructions? Shall we not equip  ourselves with a clear and full understanding of their purpose and  implications for the age we live in, and with an unconquerable resolve  arise to utilize them, intelligently and with scrupulous fidelity, for the  enlightenment and the promotion of the good of all mankind?    Humanity, torn with dissension and burning with hate, is crying at this  hour for a fuller measure of that love which is born of God, that love  which in the last resort will prove the one solvent of its incalculable  difficulties and problems. Is it not incumbent upon us, whose hearts are  aglow with love for Him, to make still greater effort, to manifest that  love in all its purity and power in our dealings with our fellow-men? May  our love of our beloved Master, so ardent, so disinterested in all its  aspects, find its true expression in love for our fellow-brethren and  sisters in the faith as well as for all mankind. I assure you, dear  friends, that progress in such matters as these is limitless and infinite,  and that upon the extent of our achievements along this line will  ultimately depend the success of our mission in life.          The New World Order      And as we make an effort to demonstrate that love to the world may we also  clear our minds of any lingering trace of unhappy misunderstandings that  might obscure our clear conception of the exact purpose and methods of  this new world order, so challenging and complex, yet so consummate and  wise. We are called upon by our beloved Master in His Will and Testament  not only to adopt it unreservedly, but to unveil its merit to all the  world. To attempt to estimate its full value, and grasp its exact  significance after so short a time since its inception would be premature  and presumptuous on our part. We must trust to time, and the guidance of  God's Universal House of Justice, to obtain a clearer and fuller  understanding of its provisions and implications. But one word of warning  must be uttered in this connection. Let us be on our guard lest we measure  too strictly the Divine Plan with the standard of men. I am not prepared  to state that it agrees in principle or in method with the prevailing  notions now uppermost in men's minds, nor that it should conform with  those imperfect, precarious, and expedient measures feverishly resorted to  by agitated humanity. Are we to doubt that the ways of God are not  necessarily the ways of man? Is not faith but another word for implicit  obedience, whole-hearted allegiance, uncompromising adherence to that  which we believe is the revealed and express will of God, however  perplexing it might first appear, however at variance with the shadowy  views, the impotent doctrines, the crude theories, the idle imaginings,  the fashionable conceptions of a transient and troublous age? If we are to  falter or hesitate, if our love for Him should fail to direct us and keep  us within His path, if we desert Divine and emphatic principles, what hope  can we any more cherish for healing the ills and sicknesses of this world?    Pending the establishment of the Universal House of Justice, whose  function it is to lay more definitely the broad lines that must guide the  future activities and administration of the Movement, it is clearly our  duty to strive to obtain as clear a view as possible of the manner in  which to conduct the affairs of the Cause, and then arise with  single-mindedness and determination to adopt and maintain it in all our  activities and labors.          The Foundation of the House of Justice      The various Assemblies, local and national, constitute today the bedrock  upon the strength of which the Universal House is in future to be firmly  established and raised. Not until these function vigorously and  harmoniously can the hope for the termination of this period of transition  be realized. It devolves upon us whose dearest wish is to see the Cause  enter upon that promised era of universal recognition and world  achievements, to do all in our power to consolidate the foundations of  these Assemblies, promoting at the same time a fuller understanding of  their purpose and more harmonious cooperation for their maintenance and  success.    Let us also remember that at the very root of the Cause lies the principle  of the undoubted right of the individual to self-expression, his freedom  to declare his conscience and set forth his views. If certain instructions  of the Master are today particularly emphasized and scrupulously adhered  to, let us be sure that they are but provisional measures designed to  guard and protect the Cause in its present state of infancy and growth  until the day when this tender and precious plant shall have sufficiently  grown to be able to withstand the unwisdom of its friends and the attacks  of its enemies.    Let us also bear in mind that the keynote of the Cause of God is not  dictatorial authority but humble fellowship, not arbitrary power, but the  spirit of frank and loving consultation. Nothing short of the spirit of a  true Baha'i can hope to reconcile the principles of mercy and justice, of  freedom and submission, of the sanctity of the right of the individual and  of self-surrender, of vigilance, discretion and prudence on the one hand,  and fellowship, candor, and courage on the other.          Duties of Elected Representatives      The duties of those whom the friends have freely and conscientiously  elected as their representatives are no less vital and binding than the  obligations of those who have chosen them. Their function is not to  dictate, but to consult, and consult not only among themselves, but as  much as possible with the friends whom they represent. They must regard  themselves in no other light but that of chosen instruments for a more  efficient and dignified presentation of the Cause of God. They should  never be led to suppose that they are the central ornaments of the body of  the Cause, intrinsically "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19254"],[0,"Citadel of Faith (#14)"],[1,"to arise and generously support the  National Fund in hour of greatest need to insure uninterrupted progress in  the ornamentation of the House of Worship which, as foretold by  'Abdu'l-Baha, is already conferring such benefits upon the community.    [May 4, 1948]            TEMPLE INTERIOR ORNAMENTATION AND ARCADE OF THE BAB'S SEPULCHER      Delighted at contract for ornamentation, projected reception (i.e., for UN  delegates in Geneva), appointment of new committees for consolidation of  teaching work and noble determination to pursue unremittingly your  God-given task.    Announce to the friends that signature on contracts for arcade of the  Bab's Sepulcher is synchronizing with first contract for interior  ornamentation of the Mother Temple of the West.    [May 14, 1948]            MY APPEAL TO THIS GOD-CHOSEN COMMUNITY      The response of the American Baha'i Community to the urgent call to arise  and remedy a critical situation has been such as to excite my highest  admiration and exceed the hopes of all those who had waited with anxious  hearts for this dangerous corner to be turned at such an important stage  in the prosecution of the Second Seven Year Plan.    The rapidity with which the challenge has been met, the strenuous efforts  which have been systematically exerted, the zeal and devotion which have  been so abundantly demonstrated, the resolution and self-sacrifice which  have been so strikingly displayed by the members of a community, burdened  with such mighty responsibilities and intent on maintaining its lead among  its sister communities in East and West, confer great luster on this  latest episode in the history of the prosecution of the Divine Plan. I am  moved to offer its high-minded and valiant members my heartfelt  congratulations on so conspicuous a victory, and on the preservation of an  unblemished record of achievements in the service of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah.    The formation of the Canadian National Assembly, the conclusion of the  preliminary steps for the completion of the interior ornamentation of the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, the rapid multiplication and consolidation of the  institutions of the Faith throughout Latin America, the steady expansion  of the activities aiming at the proclamation of the Faith to the masses,  the recognition secured, on behalf of the national institutions of a world  community, from the United Nations Organization, above all the phenomenal  success achieved through the constitution of no less than eight spiritual  assemblies in seven of the goal countries selected as targets for the  transatlantic operation of the Plan, now crowned by the holding of the  first teaching conference on the continent of Europe--all these have served  to immortalize the second year of the Second Seven Year Plan and round out  the mighty feat accomplished throughout the states and provinces of the  North American continent--the base from which the operation of a divinely  impelled and constantly expanding Plan are being conducted.    Emboldened by the enduring and momentous successes won, on so many fronts,  in such distant fields, among such a diversity of peoples, and in the face  of such formidable obstacles, by a community now launched, in both  hemispheres, on its world-encircling mission, I direct my appeal to the  entire membership of this God-chosen community, to its associates and  daughter communities in the Dominion of Canada, in Central and South  America, and in the continent of Europe, to proclaim, in the course of  this current year, to their sister communities in East and West and by  deeds no less resplendent than those of the past, their inflexible resolve  to prosecute unremittingly the Plan entrusted to their care, and emblazon  on their shields the emblems of new victories in its service.    The placing, with care and promptitude, of the successive contracts,  designed to ensure the uninterrupted progress of the interior  ornamentation of the Temple, at a time when the international situation is  fraught with so many complications and perils; the acceleration of the  twofold process designed to preserve the status of the present assemblies  throughout the states of the Union and multiply their number; the constant  broadening of the bases on which the projected Latin American national  assemblies are to be securely founded; the steady expansion of the work  initiated to give wider publicity to the Faith in the North American  continent and in circles associated with the United Nations; and, last but  not least, the constitution of firmly established assemblies in each of  the remaining goal countries in Europe and the simultaneous initiation, in  the countries already provided with such assemblies, of measures aiming at  the formation of several nuclei calculated to reinforce the structural  basis of an infant Administrative Order--these stand out as the primary and  inescapable duties which the members of your Assembly--the mainspring of  the multitudinous activities carried on in your homeland, in the Latin  American field, and on the European front--must in this third year of the  Second Seven Year Plan, befittingly discharge.    That the launching of one of these fundamental activities to be conducted  by your Assembly during the present year--the commencement of the interior  ornamentation of the Mother Temple of the West--should have so closely  synchronized with the placing of the first two contracts for the  completion of the Sepulcher of the Bab, as contemplated by 'Abdu'l-Baha,  is indeed a phenomenon of singular significance. This conjunction of two  events of historic importance, linking, in a peculiar degree, the most  sacred House of Worship in the American continent with the most hallowed  Shrine on the slopes of Mount Carmel, brings vividly to mind the no less  remarkable coincidence marking the simultaneous holding, on a Naw-Ruz Day,  of the first convention of the American Baha'i Community and the  entombment by the Center of Baha'u'llah's Covenant of the remains of the  Bab in the newly constructed vault of His Shrine.(1) The simultaneous  arrival of those remains in the fortress city of Akka and of the first  pilgrims from the continent of America;(2) the subsequent association of  the founder of the American Baha'i Community with 'Abdu'l-Baha in the  laying of the cornerstone of the Bab's Mausoleum on Mount Carmel; the  holding of the Centenary of His Declaration beneath the dome of the  recently constructed Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar at Wilmette, on which solemn  occasion His blessed portrait was unveiled, on western soil, to the eyes  of His followers; and the unique distinction now conferred on a member(3)  of the North American Baha'i Community of designing the dome, envisaged by  'Abdu'l-Baha, as the final and essential embellishment of the Bab's  Sepulcher--all these have served to associate the Herald of our Faith and  His resting-place with the fortunes of a community which has so nobly  responded to His summons addressed to the \"peoples of the West\" in His  Qayyumu'l-Asma.    \"This Sublime Shrine has remained unbuilt ...,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha, looking at  the Shrine from the steps of His House on an August day in 1915, remarked  to some of His companions, at a time when the Bab's remains had already  been placed by Him in the vault of one of the six chambers He had already  constructed for that purpose. \"God willing, it will be accomplished. We  have carried its construction to this stage.\"    The initiation in these days of extreme peril in the Holy Land of so great  and holy an enterprise, founded by Baha'u'llah Himself whilst still a  Prisoner in Akka and commenced by 'Abdu'l-Baha during the darkest and most  perilous days of His ministry, recalls to our minds, furthermore, the  construction of the superstructure of the Temple in Wilmette during one of  the severest financial crises that has afflicted the United States of  America, and the completion of its exterior ornamentation during the dark  days of the last World War. Indeed, the tragic and moving story of the  transfer of the Bab's mutilated body from place to place ever since His  Martyrdom in Tabriz, its fifty-year concealment in Persia; its perilous  and secret journey by way of Tihran, Isfahan, Kirman_sh_ah, Ba_gh_dad,  Damascus, Beirut and Akka to the Mountain of God, its ultimate resting  place; its concealment for a further period of ten years in the Holy Land  itself; the vexatious and long-drawn-out negotiations for the purchase of  the site chosen by Baha'u'llah Himself for its entombment; the threats of  'Abdu'l-Hamid, the Turkish tyrant, the accusations levelled against its  Trustee, the plots devised, and the inspection made, by the scheming  members of the notorious Turkish Commission of Inquiry; the perils to  which the bloodthirsty Jamal Pa_sh_a exposed it; the machinations of the  arch-breaker of Baha'u'llah's Covenant, of His brother and of His son,  respectively, aiming at the frustration of 'Abdu'l-Baha's design, at the  prevention of the sale of land within the precincts of the Shrine itself,  and the multiplication of the measures taken for the preservation and  consolidation of the properties purchased in its vicinity and dedicated to  it--all these are to be regarded as successive stages in the history of the  almost hundred year long process destined to culminate in the consummation  of Baha'u'llah's irresistible purpose of erecting a lasting and befitting  memorial to His Divine Herald and Co-Founder of His Faith.    As the mission entrusted by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the followers of His Faith in  the North American continent gathers momentum, unfolds its potentialities,  and raises to new heights of heroism and renown its valiant prosecutors,  events of still greater significance will, no doubt, transpire, which will  serve to enhance the value of the work which the prosecutors of the Plan  are carrying out, to widen their vision, to reinforce "]]]
