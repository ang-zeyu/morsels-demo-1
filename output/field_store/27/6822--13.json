So far as can be judged from the extracts, this text  preaches in a fully developed form, the doctrines of Sunyata,  Dharma-kaya, the omnipresence of the Buddha and the redemption of the  world by the exertions of Bodhisattvas. Yet it seems to be early, for  a portion of it was translated into Chinese about 170 A.D. (Nanjio,  102) and about 405 Kumarajiva translated a commentary on it ascribed  to Nagarjuna (Nanjio, 1180).    7. Tathagata-guhyaka. This work is known by the analysis of  Rajendralala Mitra from which it appears to be a Tantra of the worst  class and probably late. Its proper title is said to be  Sriguhyasamaja. Watanabe states that the work catalogued by Nanjio  under No. 1027 and translated into Chinese about 1000 A.D. is an  expurgated version of it. The Sikshasamuccaya cites the  Tathagata-guhya-sutra several times. The relations of these works to  one another are not quite clear.    8. Samadhiraja[140] is a Vyakarana or narrative describing different  forms of meditation of which the Samadhiraja is the greatest and best.  The scene is laid on the Vulture's Peak and the principal  interlocutors are Sakyamuni and Candraprabha, a rich man of  Rajagriha. It appears to be the same as the Candrapradipa-sutra and  is a complete and copious treatise, which not only expounds the topic  from which it takes its name but incidentally enumerates the chief  principles of Mahayanism. Watanabe[141] states that it is the  Yueeh-teng-san-mei-ching (Nanjio, 191) translated about 450 and again  in 557 A.D.    9. Dasabhumisvara.[142] An account of the ten stages in the career of  a Bodhisattva before he can attain to Buddhahood. The scene is laid in  the paradise of Indra where Sakyamuni was temporarily sojourning and  the principal interlocutor is a Bodhisattva named Vajragarbha. It is  said to be the same as the Dasabhumika-sutra first translated into  Chinese about 300 A.D. (Nanjio, 105 and 110) but this work appears to  be merely a portion of the Ganda-vyuha or Avatamsaka mentioned  above.    These nine works are all extant in Sanskrit and are known in Nepal as  the nine Dharmas, the word Dharma being an abbreviation for  _Dharmaparyaya_, revolution or exposition of the law, a term  frequently used in the works themselves to describe a comprehensive  discourse delivered by the Buddha. They are all quoted in the  Sikshasamuccaya, supposed to have been written about 650 A.D. No  similar collection of nine seems to be known in Tibet or the Far East  and the origin of the selection is obscure. As however the list does  not include the Svayambhu Purana, the principal indigenous scripture  of Nepal, it may go back to an Indian source and represent an old  tradition.    Besides the nine Dharmas, numerous other sutras exist in Sanskrit,  Chinese, Tibetan and the languages of Central Asia. Few have been  edited or translated and even when something is known of their  character detailed information as to their contents is usually  wanting. Among the better known are the following.    10. One of the sutras most read in China and admired because its style  has a literary quality unusual in Buddhist works is commonly known as  the Leng-yen-ching. The full title is Shou-leng-yen-san-mei-ching  which is the Chinese transliteration of Surangama Samadhi.[143] This  sutra is quoted by name in the Sikshasamuccaya and fragments of the  Sanskrit text have been found in Turkestan.[144] The Surangama-Samadhi  Sutra has been conjectured to be the same as the Samadhiraja, but the  accounts of Rajendralala Mitra and Beal do not support this theory.  Beal's translation leaves the impression that it resembles a Pali  sutta. The scene is laid in the Jetavana with few miraculous  accessories. The Buddha discusses with Ananda the location of the soul  and after confuting his theories expounds the doctrine of the  Dharma-kaya. The fragments found in Turkestan recommend a particular  form of meditation.    11. Taranatha informs us that among the many Mahayanist works which  appeared in the reign of Kanishka's son was the Ratnakuta-dharma-paryaya  in 1000 sections and the Ratnakuta is cited not only by the  Sikshasamuccaya but by Asanga.[145] The Tibetan and Chinese  canons contain sections with this name comprising forty-eight  or forty-nine items among which are the three important treatises  about Amitabha's paradise and many dialogues called Paripriccha, that  is, questions put by some personage, human or superhuman, and  furnished with appropriate replies.[146] The Chinese Ratnakuta is  said to have been compiled by Bodhiruchi (693-713 A.D.) but of course  he is responsible only for the selection not for the composition of  the works included. Section 14 of this Ratnakuta is said to be  identical with chapters 11 and 12 of the Mulasarvastivadin  Vinaya.[147]    12. The Guna-karanda-vyuha and Karanda-vyuha are said to be two  recensions of the same work, the first in verse the second in prose.  Both are devoted to the praise of Avalokita who is represented as the  presiding deity of the universe. He has refused to enter Buddhahood  himself until all living creatures attain to true knowledge and is  specially occupied in procuring the release of those who suffer in  hell. The Guna-karanda-vyuha contains a remarkable account of the  origin of the world which is said to be absent from the prose version.  The primeval Buddha spirit, Adi-Buddha or Svayambhu, produces  Avalokita by meditation, and Avalokita produces the material world and  the gods of Hinduism from his body, Siva from his forehead, Narayana  from his heart and so on. As such doctrines are not known to have  appeared in Indian Buddhism before the tenth century it seems probable  that the versified edition is late. But a work with the title  Ratna-karandaka-vyuha-sutra was translated into Chinese in 270 and  the Karanda-vyuha is said to have been the first work translated  into Tibetan.[148]    13. The Karunaa-pundarika[149] or Lotus of Compassion is mainly  occupied with the description of an imaginary continent called  Padmadhatu, its Buddha and its many splendours. It exists in Sanskrit  and was translated into Chinese about 400 A.D. (Nanjio, No. 142).    14. The Mahavairocanabhisambhodhi called in Chinese Ta-jih-ching or  Great Sun sutra should perhaps be mentioned as it is the principal  scripture of the Chen-yen (Japanese Shingon) school. It is a late work  of unknown origin. It was translated into Chinese in 724 A.D. but the  Sanskrit text has not been found.    There are a great number of other sutras which are important for the  history of literature, although little attention is paid to them by  Buddhists at the present day. Such are the Mahayanist version of the  Mahaparinirvana recounting the death and burial of the Buddha and the  Mahasannipata-sutra, which apparently includes the Suryagarbha and  Candragarbha sutras. All these works were translated into Chinese  about 420 A.D. and must therefore be of respectable antiquity.    Besides the sutras, there are many compositions styled Avadanas or  pious legends.[150] These, though recognized by Mahayanists, do not as  a rule contain expositions of the Sunyata and Dharma-kaya and are not  sharply distinguished from the more imaginative of the Hinayanist  scriptures.[151] But they introduce a multiplicity of Buddhas and  Bodhisattvas and represent Sakyamuni as a superhuman worker of  miracles.    They correspond in many respects to the Pali Vinaya but teach right  conduct not so much by precept as by edifying stories and, like most  Mahayanist works they lay less stress upon monastic discipline than on  unselfish virtue exercised throughout successive existences. There are  a dozen or more collections of Avadanas of which the most important  are the Mahavastu and the Divyavadana. The former[152] is an  encyclopaedic work which contains _inter alia_ a life of Sakyamuni. It  describes itself as belonging to the Lokottaravadins, a section of the  Aryamaha-sanghikas. The Lokottaravadins were an ancient sect,  precursors of the Mahayana rather than a branch of it, and much of the  Mahavastu is parallel to the Pali Canon and may have been composed a  century or two before our era. But other parts seem to belong to the  Gandharan period and the mention of Chinese and Hunnish writing points  to a much later date.[153] If it was originally a Vinaya treatise, it  has been distended out of all recognition by the addition of legends  and anecdotes but it still retains a certain amount of matter found  also in the Pali and Tibetan Vinayas. There were probably several  recensions in which successive additions were made to the original  nucleus. One interpolation is the lengthy and important section called  Dasabhumika, describing the career of a Bodhisattva. It is the only  part of the Mahavastu which can be called definitely Mahayanist. The  rest of the work marks a transitional stage in doctrine, just as its  language is neither Prakrit or Sanskrit but some ancient vernacular  brought into partial conformity with Sanskrit grammar. No Chinese  translation is known.    The Divyavadana[154] is a collection of legends, part of which is  known as the Asokavadana and gives an edifying life of that pious  monarch. This portion was translated into Chinese A.D. 317-420 and the  work probably dates from the third century of our era. It is loosely  constructed: considerable portions of it seem to be identical with the  Vinaya of the Sarvastivadins and others with passages in the works of  Asvaghosha.    The Avadanas lie on the borderland between scripture and pious  literature which uses human argument and refers to scripture for its  authority. Of this literature the Mahayanist church has a goodly  collection and the works ascribed to such doctors as Asvaghosha,  Nagarjuna, Asanga and Vasubandhu hold a high place in general esteem.  The Chinese Canon places many of them in the Pitakas (especially in  the Abhidharma Pitaka)"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1658"],[0,"Phaedo (#14)"],[1,"similar, was inferior?    Certainly.    And has not this been our own case in the matter of equals and of  absolute equality?    Precisely.    Then we must have known equality previously to the time when we first  saw the material equals, and reflected that all these apparent equals  strive to attain absolute equality, but fall short of it?    Very true.    And we recognize also that this absolute equality has only been known,  and can only be known, through the medium of sight or touch, or of some  other of the senses, which are all alike in this respect?    Yes, Socrates, as far as the argument is concerned, one of them is the  same as the other.    From the senses then is derived the knowledge that all sensible things  aim at an absolute equality of which they fall short?    Yes.    Then before we began to see or hear or perceive in any way, we must have  had a knowledge of absolute equality, or we could not have referred to  that standard the equals which are derived from the senses?--for to that  they all aspire, and of that they fall short.    No other inference can be drawn from the previous statements.    And did we not see and hear and have the use of our other senses as soon  as we were born?    Certainly.    Then we must have acquired the knowledge of equality at some previous  time?    Yes.    That is to say, before we were born, I suppose?    True.    And if we acquired this knowledge before we were born, and were born  having the use of it, then we also knew before we were born and at the  instant of birth not only the equal or the greater or the less, but all  other ideas; for we are not speaking only of equality, but of beauty,  goodness, justice, holiness, and of all which we stamp with the name of  essence in the dialectical process, both when we ask and when we answer  questions. Of all this we may certainly affirm that we acquired the  knowledge before birth?    We may.    But if, after having acquired, we have not forgotten what in each case  we acquired, then we must always have come into life having knowledge,  and shall always continue to know as long as life lasts--for knowing  is the acquiring and retaining knowledge and not forgetting. Is not  forgetting, Simmias, just the losing of knowledge?    Quite true, Socrates.    But if the knowledge which we acquired before birth was lost by us at  birth, and if afterwards by the use of the senses we recovered what  we previously knew, will not the process which we call learning be a  recovering of the knowledge which is natural to us, and may not this be  rightly termed recollection?    Very true.    So much is clear--that when we perceive something, either by the help of  sight, or hearing, or some other sense, from that perception we are  able to obtain a notion of some other thing like or unlike which is  associated with it but has been forgotten. Whence, as I was saying, one  of two alternatives follows:--either we had this knowledge at birth, and  continued to know through life; or, after birth, those who are said to  learn only remember, and learning is simply recollection.    Yes, that is quite true, Socrates.    And which alternative, Simmias, do you prefer? Had we the knowledge at  our birth, or did we recollect the things which we knew previously to  our birth?    I cannot decide at the moment.    At any rate you can decide whether he who has knowledge will or will not  be able to render an account of his knowledge? What do you say?    Certainly, he will.    But do you think that every man is able to give an account of these very  matters about which we are speaking?    Would that they could, Socrates, but I rather fear that to-morrow, at  this time, there will no longer be any one alive who is able to give an  account of them such as ought to be given.    Then you are not of opinion, Simmias, that all men know these things?    Certainly not.    They are in process of recollecting that which they learned before?    Certainly.    But when did our souls acquire this knowledge?--not since we were born  as men?    Certainly not.    And therefore, previously?    Yes.    Then, Simmias, our souls must also have existed without bodies before  they were in the form of man, and must have had intelligence.    Unless indeed you suppose, Socrates, that these notions are given us at  the very moment of birth; for this is the only time which remains.    Yes, my friend, but if so, when do we lose them? for they are not in  us when we are born--that is admitted. Do we lose them at the moment of  receiving them, or if not at what other time?    No, Socrates, I perceive that I was unconsciously talking nonsense.    Then may we not say, Simmias, that if, as we are always repeating, there  is an absolute beauty, and goodness, and an absolute essence of all  things; and if to this, which is now discovered to have existed in our  former state, we refer all our sensations, and with this compare them,  finding these ideas to be pre-existent and our inborn possession--then  our souls must have had a prior existence, but if not, there would be  no force in the argument? There is the same proof that these ideas must  have existed before we were born, as that our souls existed before we  were born; and if not the ideas, then not the souls.    Yes, Socrates; I am convinced that there is precisely the same necessity  for the one as for the other; and the argument retreats successfully  to the position that the existence of the soul before birth cannot be  separated from the existence of the essence of which you speak. For  there is nothing which to my mind is so patent as that beauty, goodness,  and the other notions of which you were just now speaking, have a most  real and absolute existence; and I am satisfied with the proof.    Well, but is Cebes equally satisfied? for I must convince him too.    I think, said Simmias, that Cebes is satisfied: although he is the most  incredulous of mortals, yet I believe that he is sufficiently convinced  of the existence of the soul before birth. But that after death the soul  will continue to exist is not yet proven even to my own satisfaction.  I cannot get rid of the feeling of the many to which Cebes was  referring--the feeling that when the man dies the soul will be  dispersed, and that this may be the extinction of her. For admitting  that she may have been born elsewhere, and framed out of other elements,  and was in existence before entering the human body, why after having  entered in and gone out again may she not herself be destroyed and come  to an end?    Very true, Simmias, said Cebes; about half of what was required has been  proven; to wit, that our souls existed before we were born:--that the  soul will exist after death as well as before birth is the other half of  which the proof is still wanting, and has to be supplied; when that is  given the demonstration will be complete.    But that proof, Simmias and Cebes, has been already given, said  Socrates, if you put the two arguments together--I mean this and the  former one, in which we admitted that everything living is born of the  dead. For if the soul exists before birth, and in coming to life and  being born can be born only from death and dying, must she not after  death continue to exist, since she has to be born again?--Surely the  proof which you desire has been already furnished. Still I suspect  that you and Simmias would be glad to probe the argument further. Like  children, you are haunted with a fear that when the soul leaves the  body, the wind may really blow her away and scatter her; especially if a  man should happen to die in a great storm and not when the sky is calm.    Cebes answered with a smile: Then, Socrates, you must argue us out of  our fears--and yet, strictly speaking, they are not our fears, but there  is a child within us to whom death is a sort of hobgoblin; him too we  must persuade not to be afraid when he is alone in the dark.    Socrates said: Let the voice of the charmer be applied daily until you  have charmed away the fear.    And where shall we find a good charmer of our fears, Socrates, when you  are gone?    Hellas, he replied, is a large place, Cebes, and has many good men, and  there are barbarous races not a few: seek for him among them all, far  and wide, sparing neither pains nor money; for there is no better way  of spending your money. And you must seek among yourselves too; for you  will not find others better able to make the search.    The search, replied Cebes, shall certainly be made. And now, if  you please, let us return to the point of the argument at which we  digressed.    By all means, replied Socrates; what else should I please?    Very good.    Must we not, said Socrates, ask ourselves what that is which, as we  imagine, is liable to be scattered, and about which we fear? and what  again is that about which we have no fear? And then we may proceed  further to enquire whether that which suffers dispersion is or is not  of the nature of soul--our hopes and fears as to our own souls will turn  upon the answers to these questions.    Very true, he said.    Now the compound or composite may be supposed to be naturally capable,  as of being compounded, so also of being dissolved; but that which is  uncompounded, and that only, must be, if anything is, indissoluble.    Yes; I should imagine so, said Cebes.    And the uncompounded may be assumed to be the same and unchanging,  whereas the compound is always changing and never the same.    I agree, he said.    Then now let us return to the previous discussion. Is that idea or  essence, which in the dialectical process we define as essence or true  existence--whether essence of equality, beauty, or anything else--are  these essences, I say, liable at times to some degree of change? or  are they each of them always what they are, having the same simple  self-existent and unchanging forms, not admitting of variation at all,  or in any way, or at any"]]]
