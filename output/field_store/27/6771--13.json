During the intermission of twenty minutes between halves, the sophomores  retired to the little room off the gymnasium to rest. The outlook was  indeed gloomy. It was doubtful whether they could make up their loss  during the last half. Marian Barber, Eva Allen and Miriam whispered  together in one corner. Grace sat with her chin in her hand, deep in  thought, while Nora stood staring out the window trying to keep back the  tears. Two or three of the substitutes strolled in and joined Miriam's  group. The whispering grew to be a subdued murmur. The girls were  evidently talking about Grace, hence their lowered voices. Their  long-suffering captain looked at them once or twice, made a move as if to  join them, then sat down again. Nora's blood was up at the girls'  rudeness. She marched over to the group and was about to deliver her  opinion of them in scathing terms, when the whistle sounded. There was a  general scramble for places. Then the ball was put in play and the second  half began.    The sophomores managed to tie the score during the early part of the last  half, and from that on held their own. They fought strenuously to keep the  juniors from scoring. When the juniors did score, the plucky sophomores  managed to do the same soon after. There were two more minutes of the  game, and the score stood 10 to 10. It looked as though it might end in a  tie. One of the juniors had the ball. With unerring aim she threw it to  goal. It never reached there, for Miriam Nesbit made a dash, sprang  straight into the air and caught the ball before it reached its  destination. Quick as a flash she threw it to Nora, who threw it to Marian  Barber. The latter being near the basket threw it to goal without any  trouble.    Before the juniors could get anywhere near the ball the whistle blew and  the game closed. Score 12 to 10. The sophomores had won.    The noise in the gallery was deafening. Miriam's sensational playing had  taken every one by storm. A crowd of sophomores rushed down to the  gymnasium and began dancing around her singing their class song. Her  cheeks were scarlet and her eyes blazed with triumph. She was a lion at  last, and now the rest would follow. She felt sure that she would be asked  to take the place of Grace as captain. She had shown them what she could  do. Grace had done nothing but cause trouble. The team would be better off  without her.    Anne and Jessica were waiting in the corridor for Grace and Nora. The two  players rapidly changed their clothes and soon the chums were walking down  the quiet street.    \"Well,\" said Jessica, \"Miriam has done it at last.\"    \"She has, indeed,\" responded Grace, \"and no one begrudges her her glory.  She made a star play and saved the day for us. She is loyal to the team  even if she doesn't like their captain.\"    \"I don't know about that,\" said Nora, \"I think she might have exerted  herself during the first game if she wanted so much to show her loyalty.  She was anything but a star player, then. I have no faith in her,  whatever. She cares for no one but herself, and that star play was for her  own benefit, not because of any allegiance to her team. She's up to  something, you may depend upon that.\"    \"Oh, Nora, don't be too hard on her. She deserves great credit for her  work. Don't you think so, girls?\" Grace turned appealingly to Anne and  Jessica.    \"It was a remarkable play,\" said Anne.    Jessica made no answer. She would not praise Grace's enemy, even to please  Grace.    \"You may say what you please,\" said Nora obstinately, \"I shall stick to my  own convictions. The way those girls stood in the corner and whispered  during intermission was simply disgraceful. Mark my words, something will  come of it.\"    \"Oh, here comes David on his motorcycle,\" called Anne delightedly.    David slowed up when he saw the girls, alighted and greeted them warmly.  He at once congratulated them on their victory.    \"I congratulate you on having a star player for a sister,\" said Grace. \"It  must run in the family.\" She referred to his late football triumphs.    David flushed with pleasure, more at the compliment paid to his sister  than the one meant for him.    \"Sis can come up to the mark when she wants to,\" he said earnestly. \"I  hope she repeats the performance.\" Then he abruptly changed the subject.  That one little speech revealed to his friends the fact that he understood  the situation and longed with all his heart for a change of tactics on the  part of his sister.          CHAPTER XII    THE WAYS OF SCHOOLGIRLS      The clang of the gong announced the end of school for the day, but some of  the sophomores lingered in their locker-room.    They had a very disagreeable communication to make that afternoon, to one  of their class, and now that the time had come were inclined to shrink  from the ordeal.    \"I think Miriam should break the news herself,\" observed Marian Barber,  \"as long as she is to succeed Grace.\"    \"Miriam isn't here,\" said Eva Allen, \"she went home early. She told me she  could not bear to see anyone unhappy. She is so sensitive you know?\" Eva  Allen was devoted to Miriam's cause.    \"Oh, I don't know about that,\" said practical Marian. \"She'll make a good  captain, however, because she has showed more loyalty to the team than  Grace has.\"    Marian firmly believed what she said. She had never been an ardent admirer  of Miriam, and had at first stubbornly refused to repudiate Grace. But  Miriam had little by little instilled into her the idea of Grace's  incompetency, until Marian, who thought only of the good of the team,  became convinced that a change of captains was advisable. Miriam's  brilliant playing in the recent game was the final touch needed, and now  Marian was prepared to do what she considered was her absolute duty.    \"Suppose we write Grace a letter,\" suggested one of the substitutes, \"as  long as no one seems anxious to tell her.\"    \"Hush,\" exclaimed Eva Allen, holding up her finger. \"Here come Nora and  Jessica. I know they are going to make a lot of fuss when they hear the  news. Suppose we go back to the classroom and write the letter. We can all  sign our names to it, and then we'll be equally to blame.\"    The conspirators accordingly trooped into the corridor, just as Nora and  Jessica were about to enter the locker-room.    \"What in the world is the matter now?\" called Jessica. \"You girls looks as  guilty as though you'd stolen a gold mine.\"    \"Wait and see,\" said Eva with a rather embarrassed laugh, as she hurried  after the others up the stairs.    \"Do you know, Jessica, I believe they're up to some hateful mischief. What  did I tell you the other day? Those girls have given Grace the cold  shoulder more than ever, since the game. They have been following Miriam  about like a lot of sheep. Grace notices it, too, and it makes her  unhappy, only she's too proud to say so.\"    \"Never mind,\" said Jessica soothingly. \"They'll be sorry some day.  Miriam's influence won't last. Grace did perfectly right in standing by  Anne, and you and I must always stand by Grace. Grace is a fine captain,  and----\"    \"What are you saying about me?\" demanded Grace herself, walking into the  locker-room with Anne.    Jessica blushed and was silent, but Nora said glibly, \"Oh, Jessica just  now said that you made a fine captain.\" Then she went on hurriedly, \"I  think our chances for winning the championship are better than ever, don't  you?\"    \"The juniors have been practising like mad since their defeat,\" mused  Grace. \"They will make a hard fight next time. Miss Thompson told me  yesterday that she never saw better work in basketball than ours last  Saturday. I am so proud of my team, even though they haven't been very  nice to me lately. My whole desire is for them to win the final game. I  suppose a captain has about the same feeling toward her players that a  mother has toward her daughters. She is willing to make any sacrifice in  order to make fine girls of them.\"    \"And you are a fine captain,\" cried Anne. \"I felt so proud of you the  other day. You handled your team so well. Knowing how hateful they have  been, it was wonderful to see you give your orders as though nothing had  happened. No other girl could have done it.\"    \"That is a nice compliment, Anne, dear,\" said Grace pleased with the words  of praise from her friend, for the bitterness of her recent unpopularity  had made her heart heavy.    At that moment the sophomores whom Jessica and Nora had encountered filed  into the room.    Each girl wore a self-conscious expression. Eva Allen carried an envelope  in her hand. She was confused and nervous.    Once inside the door the girls paused and began a whispered conversation.  Then Eva Allen tried to push the envelope into another girl's hand; but  the girl put her hands behind her back and obstinately refused to take it.  There was another whispered conference with many side glances in Grace's  direction.    Nora stood scowling savagely at the group. She noticed that it consisted  of the basketball team and its substitutes. They were all there except  Miriam.    \"If you have any secrets, girls,\" remarked Grace in a hurt tone, \"please  postpone the telling of them for a few minutes. I am going, directly.\"    She opened her locker and drew out her coat and hat, trying to hide the  tears that filled her eyes.    Then Marian Barber impatiently took the envelope from Eva and stepped  forward. She had made up her mind to get the whole thing over as rapidly  as she could.    \"Er--Grace,\" she said, clearing her throat, \"er--the team has----\"    \"Well, what is it?\" exclaimed Nora, irritated beyond her power of  endurance. \"Why don't you speak out, instead of stuttering in that  fashion? I always did detest stuttering.\"    \"Marian has a note for you, Grace,\" interposed one of the substitutes  growing bolder.    Marian placed the note in Grace's hand and turned slowly away. Up to that  minute she had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15352"],[0,"Venereal Diseases in New Zealand (1922) (#14)"],[1,"prevalence of syphilis in New  Zealand has been made by Dr. Hay, Inspector-General of Mental Hospitals.  Working on what is known as Fournier's Index--the relation of the number  of cases of dementia paralytica existing at any one time to the number  of concurrent syphilitic infectious--he computes the number of persons  in New Zealand now who have or have had syphilis to be 33,000, or 1 to  every 38 of the population.    The Committee desire to state, however, that in their opinion there can  be no accurate estimate of the prevalence of venereal disease until some  system of obtaining accurate statistics has been adopted. One point  which has come out clearly in their investigations is that venereal  disease is sufficiently prevalent to cause serious concern and to call  for energetic action.    Evidence was given to the Committee to show that children with mental  and physical defects due to venereal diseases may become a charge on the  State; that a proportion of these on being released become parents of  defective children, who in their turn have to be supported at the public  expense. It was also shown that such defectives have little sexual  control, and are usually very prolific.    According to the Commissioner of Police there are only 104 professional  prostitutes in New Zealand.    There is, however, a great deal of \"amateur\" prostitution, and this is  chiefly responsible for the spread of venereal diseases.    The evidence points to a good deal of laxity of conduct among young  people of all social conditions, especially in the large towns. This is  generally attributed by the witnesses to the weakening of home influence  and the restlessness of the age.    Apart from the venereal disease among those who indulge in promiscuous  intercourse, there are many cases in which innocent wives are infected  by their husbands, and other cases (not so frequent) of innocent  husbands being infected by their wives.    Children suffer innocently from venereal disease, not only by  inheritance from infected parents, but by accidently coming in contact  with the germs on towels, &c., which have been used by a patient. There  are also cases which come before the Courts where disease has been  conveyed directly in crimes of violence by sexual perverts.    The free clinics in the chief centres are conducted by experts, and are  doing good work. Their influence for good is greatly impaired, however,  by the fact that a proportion of the male patients and the majority of  the female patients leave off treatment before they are cured. As the  law stands there is no power to compel them to continue treatment, and  in many cases they resume promiscuous intercourse and spread the  disease.    Evidence has been given of other cases, some of them of a very shocking  character, in which persons suffering from venereal disease are not  seeking medical treatment and are communicating the disease to others.  As the law stands at present there is no power to restrain them from  such conduct or to compel them to receive medical treatment.      SECTION 2.--RECOMMENDATIONS.    The Committee stress in the strongest terms the duty of moral  self-control.    They urge the cultivation of a healthier state of public opinion. The  stigma at present attached to sufferers from venereal disease should be  transferred to those who indulge in promiscuous sexual intercourse.    Parents have a great responsibility as regards the instruction and  training of their children so as to safeguard them against the dangers  resulting from ignorance of sexual laws. There is too little parental  control generally in New Zealand. The Committee recommend the training  of teachers, and provision for giving appropriate instruction in  schools.    Classification and, where necessary, segregation of mentally defective  adolescents is recommended.    The following medical measures for preventing and combating the disease  are recommended:--    The clinics should be made more available by being open continuously.  Every effort should be made to secure privacy. A specially trained nurse  should be in attendance at women's clinics, and women doctors should be  secured where possible.    The Committee recommend that provision be made at the clinics for prompt  preventive treatment of those who have exposed themselves to infection.    Lady patrols should be appointed in other centres to perform the kind of  work that is being carried on in Christchurch.    The Committee, having regard to the good work especially of an  educational nature which is being done by the Social Hygiene Society,  Christchurch, consider voluntary effort of the same kind in other  centres would be very helpful.    The Committee are entirely opposed to the Continental system of licensed  brothels, or a revival of the C.D. Acts in any shape or form.    They recommend legislation be introduced providing for what is known as  conditional notification of venereal disease. It will be the duty of a  doctor to notify to the Health Department, by number or symbol only,  each case of venereal disease he treats. If a patient, however, refuses  to continue treatment until cured, and will not consult some other  doctor or attend a clinic, it will then be the duty of the doctor last  in attendance to notify the case to the Department by name.    If the patient continues recalcitrant and refuses to allow himself to be  examined by the medical practitioner appointed by the Director-General  of Health, then the latter should be empowered to apply to a Magistrate  for the arrest of such person and his detention in a public hospital or  other place of treatment until he is non-infective.    The Committee also recommend further provision to deal with cases in  which persons suffering from venereal disease are not under medical  treatment and are likely to infect others. If the Director-General of  Health has reason to believe that any person is so suffering he may call  on that person to produce a medical certificate, which may be procured  free of charge from any hospital or venereal-disease clinic. If the  person refuses to produce such a certificate he or she may be taken  before a Magistrate, who may order a medical examination. Penalties,  including detention in a prison hospital, should be provided for  recalcitrant cases. The proceedings in all these cases are to be heard  in private unless defendant desires a public hearing.    The Committee recommend that before a license to marry is issued the  intending parties must sign a paper answering certain questions as to  freedom from communicable disease and from mental disease, and must make  a sworn statement that the answers to such questions are true.    They recommend the adoption of a provision in the Queensland Act making  venereal disease a ground for annulling a marriage contracted whilst one  party is suffering from such a disease in an infectious stage, provided  the other party was not informed of the fact prior to marriage. Also  that it should be the duty of a medical practitioner attending a case of  venereal disease, if he has reason to believe that the patient intends  to marry, to warn him or her against doing so, and if he or she persists  it should be the duty of the doctor to notify the case by name to the  Director-General of Health, whose duty it should be to inform the other  party, or the parents or guardian of such other party. Such  communications made in good faith either by the doctor or the  Director-General of Health should be absolutely privileged.    The Committee recommend that the law prohibiting treatment of patients  for venereal disease by unqualified persons shall be strengthened, and  suggest that the Pharmaceutical Society might assist in preventing such  practices.      SECTION 3.--CONCLUDING REMARKS.    The Committee in carrying out their task have been brought into contact  with some uninviting aspects of our social life. Some of the facts  disclosed are of a character to give serious concern to those lovers of  their country who rightly regard it as exceptionally favoured by nature,  and desire to see its people healthy and vigorous, clean in body and  mind, worthy of their heritage. The late war showed that the pick of our  population, physically as well as mentally, were of the finest possible  type, the admiration of all who saw them; but the medical examination of  the recruits disclosed that of 135,282 examined after the introduction  of the Military Service Act--mostly young men in the prime of life--only  57,382, or say, 421/2 per cent., could be accepted as fit for training,  unmistakably proving that the nation as a whole was much below the  standard of physical fitness which it ought to exhibit.    The investigations of the Committee show that already there is far too  large a proportion of mental and physical defectives reproducing their  kind. In the absence of accurate statistics it is impossible to say what  proportion of these defectives are the direct product of venereal  disease, but there is clear evidence that a tendency to lead dissolute  lives is especially noticeable in the females belonging to this  unfortunate class. \"A feeble-minded girl,\" says Mr. Beck, \"has not sense  enough to protect herself from the perils to which women are subjected.  Often amiable in disposition and physically attractive, they either  marry and bring forth a new generation of defectives, or they become  irresponsible sources of corruption and debauchery in the communities  where they live.\" Obviously some method of dealing with mental  defectives--by segregation or otherwise--must be found as part of the  problem of dealing with venereal disease.    As regards the effect of venereal disease on the general health of the  community, we have the statement of the late Sir William Osler that he  regards syphilis as \"third on the list of killing diseases\"; while  Neisser, a leading authority, says that \"with the"]]]
