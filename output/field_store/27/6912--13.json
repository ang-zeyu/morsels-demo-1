Yet, on  reading Jahn's elaborate account of Mozart's life and works, nothing  strikes one more than the emphasis he places on the amount of  preliminary labor which Mozart expended on his compositions, before he  wrote them down. It appears to be a well-authenticated fact that  Mozart postponed writing the overture to \"Don Giovanni,\" until the  midnight preceding the evening when the opera was to be performed in  public; and that at seven o'clock in the morning, the score was ready  for the copyist, although he had been drinking punch and was so sleepy  that his wife had to allow him to doze for two hours, and kept him  awake the rest of the time by telling him funny stories. But this  incident loses much of its marvellous character, when we bear in mind  that Mozart, according to his usual custom, must have had every bar of  the overture worked out in his head, before he sat down to commit it  to paper. This last labor was almost purely mechanical, and for this  reason, whenever he was engaged in writing down his scores, he not  only worked with amazing rapidity, but did not object to conversation,  and even seemed to like it; and on one occasion when at work on an  opera, he wrote as fast as his hands could travel, although in one  adjoining room there was a singing teacher, in another a violinist,  and opposite an oboeist, all in full blast!    Mozart himself tried to correct the notion, prevalent even in his day,  that he composed without effort--that melodies flowed from his mind as  water from a fountain. During one of the rehearsals of \"Don Giovanni,\"  at Prague, he remarked to the leader of the orchestra: \"I have spared  neither pains nor labor in order to produce something excellent for  Prague. People are indeed mistaken in imagining that art has been an  easy matter to me. I assure you, my dear friend, no one has expended  so much labor on the study of composition as I have. There is hardly a  famous master whose works I have not studied thoroughly and  repeatedly.\"    Jahn surmises, doubtless correctly, that the reason why Mozart  habitually delayed putting down his pieces on paper, was because this  process, being a mere matter of copying, did not interest him so much  as the composing and creating, which were all done before he took up  the pen. \"You know,\" he writes to his father, \"that I am immersed in  music, as it were, that I am occupied with it all day long, that I  like to study, speculate, reflect.\" He was often absent-minded and  even followed his thoughts while playing billiards or nine pins, or  riding. Like Beethoven, he walked up and down the room, absorbed in  thought, even while washing his hands; and his hair-dresser used to  complain that Mozart would never sit still, but would jump up every  now and then and walk across the room to jot down something, or touch  the piano, while _he_ had to run after him holding on to his pigtail.    Allusion has been made to the fact that it was almost always in the  open air that new ideas sprouted in Mozart's mind, especially when he  was travelling. Whenever a new theme occurred to him he would jot it  down on a slip of paper, and he always had a special leather bag for  preserving these sketches, which he carefully guarded. These sketches  differ somewhat in appearance, but generally they contained the melody  or vocal part, together with the bass, and brief indications of the  middle parts, and here and there mention of a special instrument.  This was sufficient subsequently to recall the whole composition to  his memory. In elaborating his scores he hardly ever made any  deviations from the original conception, not even in the  instrumentation; which seems the more remarkable when we reflect that  he was the originator of many new orchestral combinations, the beauty  of which presented itself to his imagination before his ears had ever  heard them in actuality. These new tone-colors, as Jahn remarks,  existed intrinsically in the orchestra as a statue does in the marble;  but it remained for the artist to bring them out; and that Mozart was  bound to have them is shown by the anecdote of a musician who  complained to him of the difficulty of a certain passage, and begged  him to alter it. \"Is it possible to play those tones on your  instrument?\" Mozart asked; and when he was told it was, he replied,  \"Then it is your affair to bring them out.\"    Beethoven's way of mental composing appears at first sight to differ  widely from Mozart's. But if we had as many specimens of Mozart's  preliminary sketches as we have of Beethoven's, the difference would  perhaps appear less pronounced, and would to a large extent resolve  itself into the fact that Beethoven did not trust his memory so much  as Mozart did, and therefore put more of his _tentative_, or rough  sketches, on paper. He always carried in his pockets a few loose  sheets of music paper, or a number of sheets bound together in a  note-book. If his supply gave out accidentally, he would seize upon  any loose sheet of paper, or even a bill of fare, to note down his  thoughts. In a corner of his room lay a large pile of note-books, into  which he had copied in ink his first rough pencil-sketches. Many of  these sketch-books have been fortunately preserved, and they are among  the most remarkable relics we have of any man of genius. They prove  above all things that rapidity of work is not a test of musical  inspiration, and that Carlyle was not entirely wrong when he defined  genius as \"an immense capacity for taking trouble.\" In the \"Fidelio\"  sketch-book, for example, sixteen pages are almost entirely filled  with sketches for a scene which takes up less than three pages of the  vocal score. Of the aria, \"O Hoffnung,\" there are as many as eighteen  different versions, and of the final chorus, ten; and these are not  exceptional cases by any means. As Thayer remarks: \"To follow a  recitative or aria through all its guises is an extremely fatiguing  task, and the almost countless studies for a duet or terzet are enough  to make one frantic.\" Thayer quotes Jahn's testimony that these  afterthoughts are invariably superior to the first conception, and  adds that \"some of his first ideas for pieces which are now among the  jewels of the opera are so extremely trivial and commonplace, that one  would hardly dare to attribute them to Beethoven, were they not in  his own handwriting.\"    On the other hand these sketch-books bear witness to the extreme  fertility of Beethoven's genius. Thayer estimates that the number of  distinct ideas noted in them, which remained unused, is as large as  the number which he used; and he refers to this as a commentary on the  remark which Beethoven made toward the close of his life: \"It seems to  me as if I were only just beginning to compose.\" And Nottebohm, who  has studied these sketch-books more thoroughly than any one else,  thinks that if Beethoven had elaborated all the symphonies which he  began in these books we should have at least fifty instead of nine.    The sketch-books show that Beethoven was in the habit of working at  several compositions at the same time; and the ideas for these are so  jumbled up in his books that he himself apparently needed a guide to  find them. At least, when ideas belonging together are widely  separated he used to connect them by writing the letters VI over the  first passage and DE over the second. He also used to write the word  \"better\" in French on some pages, or else the figures 100, 500, 1,000,  etc., probably, as Schindler thinks, to indicate the relative value of  certain ideas.    When his mind was in a creative mood, Beethoven was as completely  absorbed (or \"absent-minded,\" as we generally say) as Mozart. This is  illustrated by an amusing trait described by his biographers.  \"Beethoven was extremely fond of washing. He would pour water  backwards and forwards over his hands for a long time together, and if  at such times a musical thought struck him and he became absorbed, he  would go on until the whole floor was swimming, and the water had  found its way through the ceiling into the room beneath\" (Grove).  Consequently, as may be imagined, he not infrequently had trouble with  his landlord. He was constantly changing his lodgings, and always  spent the summer in the country, where he did his best work. \"In the  winter,\" he once remarked to Rellstab, \"I do but little; I only write  out and score what I have composed in the summer. But that takes a  long time. When I get into the country I am fit for anything.\"    On account of his deafness, Beethoven affords a striking instance of  the power musicians have of imagining novel sound effects which they  never could have heard with their ears. In literature we blame a  writer who, as the expression goes, \"evolves his facts from his inner  consciousness;\" but in music this proceeding is evidence of the  highest genius, because music has only a few elementary \"facts\" or  prototypes, in nature. Beethoven was deaf at thirty-two. He never  heard his \"Fidelio,\" and for twenty-five years he could hear music  only with the inner ear. But musicians are in one respect more  fortunate than painters. If Titian had lost his eyesight, he could  never have painted another picture; whereas Beethoven after losing his  principal sense still continued to compose, better than ever. Mr.  Thayer even thinks that from a purely artistic point of view  Beethoven's deafness may have been an advantage to him; for it  compelled him to concentrate all his thoughts on the symphonies in his  head, undisturbed by the harsh noises of the external world. And that  he did not forego the _delights_ of music is obvious from the fact  that the pleasure of creating is more intense than the pleasure of  hearing; and is, moreover illustrated by the great delight "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18564"],[0,"The Religion of Ancient Rome (#14)"],[1,"suspends his votive-tablet in the temple, pays his due for health or  commercial success vouchsafed to himself or his relations. 'Men call  Iuppiter greatest and best,' says Cicero, 'because he makes us not just  or temperate or wise, but sound and healthy and rich and wealthy.'  Still less, until we come to the moralists of the Empire, is there any  sense of that immediate and personal relation of the individual to a  higher being, which is really in religion, far more than commandments  and ordinances, the mainspring and safeguard of morality: even the  conception of the Genius, the 'nearest' perhaps of all unseen powers,  had nothing of this feeling in it, and it may be significant that, just  because of his nearness to man, the Genius never quite attained to  god-head. As far as direct relation is concerned, religion and morality  were to the Roman two independent spheres with a very small point of  contact.    Nor even in its indirect influence does the formal observance of the  Roman worship seem likely at first sight to have done much for personal  or national morality. Based upon fear, stereotyped in the form of a  legal relationship, _religio_--'the bounden obligation'--made, no  doubt, for a kind of conscientiousness in its adherents, but a cold  conscientiousness, devoid of emotion and incapable of expanding itself  to include other spheres or prompt to a similar scrupulousness in other  relations. The rigid and constant distinction of sacred and profane  would incline the Roman to fulfil the routine of his religious duty  and then turn, almost with a sigh of relief, to the occupations of  normal life, carrying with him nothing more than the sense of a burden  laid aside and a pledge of external prosperity. Even the religious act  itself might be without moral significance: as we have seen, the  worshipper might be wholly ignorant of the character, even the name of  the deity he worshipped, and in any case the motive of his action was  naught, the act itself everything. Nor again had the Roman religion any  trace of that powerful incentive to morality, a doctrine of rewards and  punishments in a future life: the ideas as to the fate of the dead were  fluctuating and vague, and the Roman was in any case much more  interested in their influence on himself than in their possible  experiences after death.    The divorce then between religion and morality seems almost complete  and it is not strange that most modern writers speak of the Roman  religion as a tiresome ritual formalism, almost wholly lacking in  ethical value. And yet it did not present itself in this light to the  Romans themselves. Cicero, sceptic as he was, could speak of it as the  cause of Rome's greatness; Augustus, the practical politician, could  believe that its revival was an essential condition for the  renaissance of the Roman character. Have we, in our brief examination  of its characteristics, seen any features which may suggest the  solution of this apparent antagonism? Was there in this formalism a  life which escapes us, as we handle the dry bones of antiquarianism?    In the first place there may be a danger that we underrate the value  of formalism itself. It spells routine, but routine is not without  value in the strengthening of character. The private citizen, who  conscientiously day by day had carried out the worship of his household  gods and month by month observed the sacred abstinence from work on the  days of festival, was certainly not less fitted to take his place as a  member of a strenuous and well-organised community, or to serve  obediently and quietly in the army on campaign. Even the magistrate in  the execution of his religious duties must have acquired an exactness  and method, which would not be valueless in the conduct of public  business. And when we pass to the origin of this formalism--the legal  relation--the connection with the Roman character becomes at once more  obvious. The 'lawgivers of the world,' who developed constitution and  code to a systematised whole such as antiquity had not dreamed of  before, imported, we may say if we like, their legal notions into the  sphere of religion: but we must not forget the other side of the  question. The permanence and success of this greater contract with  higher powers--the feeling that the gods did regard and reward exact  fulfilment of duty--cannot have been without re-action on the relations  of the life of the community: it was, as it were, a higher sanction to  the legal point of view: a pledge that the relations of citizen and  state too were rightly conceived. 'There is,' says Cicero, speaking of  the death of Clodius in the language of a later age, 'there is a divine  power which inspired that criminal to his own ruin: it was not by  chance that he expired before the shrine of the Bona Dea, whose rites  he had violated': the divine justice is the sanction of the human law.  Even in the fear, from which all ultimately sprang, there was a  training in self-repression and self-subordination, which in a more  civilised age must result in a valuable respect and obedience. The  descendants of those who had made religion out of an attempt to appease  the hostile _numina_, feeling themselves not indeed on more familiar  terms with their 'unknown gods,' but only perhaps a little more  confident of their own strength, were not likely to be wanting in a  disciplined sense of dependence and an appreciation of the value of  respect for authority, which alone can give stability to a  constitution. If fear with the Romans was not the beginning of  theological wisdom, it was yet an important contribution to the  character of a disciplined state.    But, as I have hinted in the course of this sketch more than once, the  answer to this problem, as well as the key to the general understanding  of the Roman religion, is to be found in the worship of the household.  If we knew more of it, we should see more clearly where religion and  morality joined hands, but we know enough to give us a clue. There not  only are the principal events of life, birth, adolescence, marriage,  attended by their religious sanction, but in the ordinary course of the  daily round the divine presence and the dependence of man are  continually emphasised. The gods are given their portion of the family  meal, the sanctified dead are recalled to take their share of the  family blessings. The result was not merely an approach--collectively,  not individually--to that sense of the nearness of the unseen, which  has so great an effect on the actions of the living, but a very strong  bond of family union which lay at the root of the life of the state.  It would be difficult to find a clearer expression of the notion than  in the fact that the same word _pietas_, which expresses the due  fulfilment of man's duty to god, is also the ideal of the relations of  the members of a household: filial piety was, in fact, but another  aspect of that rightness of relation, which reveals itself in the  worship of the gods. No doubt that, in the city-life of later periods,  this ideal broke down on both sides: household worship was neglected  and family life became less dutiful. But it was still, especially in  the country, the true backbone of Roman society, and no one can read  the opening odes of Horace's third book without feeling the strength of  Augustus' appeal to it.    And if we translate this, as we have learned to do, into terms of the  state, we can get some idea of what the Romans meant by their debt to  their religion. As the household was bound together by the tie of  common worship, as in the intermediate stage the clan, severed  politically and socially, yet felt itself reunited in the gentile  rites, so too the state was welded into a whole by the regularly  recurring annual festivals and the assurance of the divine sanction on  its undertakings. It might be that in the course of time these rites  lost their meaning and the community no longer by personal presence  expressed its service to the gods, but the cult stood there still, as  the type of Rome's union to the higher powers and a guarantee of their  assistance against all foes: the religion of Rome was, as it has been  said, the sanctification of patriotism--the Roman citizen's highest  moral ideal. It has been remarked, perhaps with partial truth, that the  religion of the _AEneid_--in many ways a summary of Roman thought and  feeling--is the belief in the _fata Romae_ and their fulfilment. The  very impersonality of this conception makes it a good picture of what  religion was in the Roman state. It was not, as with the Jews, a strong  conviction of the rightness of their own belief and a certainty that  their divine protectors must triumph over those of other nations, but a  feeling of the constant presence of some spirits, who, 'if haply they  might find them,' would, on the payment of their due, bear their part  in the great progress of right and justice and empire on which Rome  must march to her victory. It was the duty of the citizen, with this  conception of his city before his eyes, to see to it that the state's  part in the contract was fulfilled. From his ancestors had been  inherited the tradition, which told him the when, where, and how, and  in the preservation of that tradition and its due performance consisted  at once Rome's duty and her glory. 'If we wish,' says Cicero, 'to  compare ourselves with other nations, we may be found in other respects  equal or even inferior; in religion, that is in the worship of the  gods, we are far superior.' The religion of Rome may not have advanced  the theology or the ethics of the world, but it made and held together  a nation.
