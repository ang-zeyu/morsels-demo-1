The Tzar,  entirely oblivious of his ukase of 1817,[1] instructed the White-Russian  governor-general, Khovanski, to start a new rigorous inquiry.    [Footnote 1: See above, p. 74.]    The imperial order gave the governor-general, who was a Jew-hater and a  believer in the hideous libel, unrestricted scope for his anti-Semitic  instincts. He entrusted the conduct of the new investigation to a  subaltern, by the name of Strakhov, a man of the same ilk, conferring  upon him the widest possible powers. On his arrival in Velizh, Strakhov  first of all arrested Terentyeva, and subjected her to a series of  cross-examinations during which he endeavored to put her on what he  considered the desirable track. Stimulated by the prosecutor, the  prostitute managed to concoct a regular criminal romance. She deposed  that she herself had participated in the crime, having lured little  Theodore into the homes of Zetlin and Berlin. In Berlin's house, and  later on in the synagogue, a crowd of Jews of both sexes had subjected  the child to the most horrible tortures. The boy had been stabbed and  butchered and rolled about in a barrel. The blood squeezed out of him  had been distributed on the spot among those present, who thereupon  proceeded to soak pieces of linen in it and to pour it out in  bottles.[1] All these tortures had been perpetrated in her own presence,  and with the active participation both of herself and the Christian  servant-girls of the two families.    [Footnote 1: According to her testimony, the Jews are in the habit of  using Christian blood to smear the eyes of their new-born babies, since  \"the Jews are always born blind,\" also to mix it with the flour in  preparing the unleavened bread for Passover.]    It may be added that Terentyeva did not make these statements at one  time, but at different intervals, inventing fresh details at each new  examination and often getting muddled in her story. The implicated  servant-girls at first denied their share in the crime, but, yielding to  external pressure--like Terentyeva, they, too, were sent for frequent  \"admonition\" to a local priest, called Tarashkevich, a ferocious  anti-Semite--they were gradually led to endorse the depositions of the  principal material witness.    On the strength of these indictments Strakhov placed the implicated Jews  under arrest, at first two highly esteemed ladies, Slava Berlin and  Hannah Zetlin, later on their husbands and relatives, and finally a  number of other Jewish residents of Velizh. In all forty-two people were  seized, put in chains, and thrown into jail. The prisoners were examined  \"with a vengeance\"; they were subjected to the old-fashioned judicial  procedure which approached closely the methods of medieval torture. The  prisoners denied their guilt with indignation, and, when confronted with  Terentyeva, denounced her vehemently as a liar. The excruciating  cross-examinations brought some of the prisoners to the verge of  madness. But as far as Strakhov was concerned, the hysterical fits of  the women, the angry speeches of the men, the remarks of some of the  accused, such as: \"I shall tell everything, but only to the Tzar,\"  served in his eyes as evidence of the Jews' guilt. In his reports he  assured his superior, Khovanski, that he had got on the track of a  monstrous crime perpetrated by a whole Kahal, with the assistance of  several Christian women who had been led astray by the Jews.    In communicating his findings to St. Petersburg, the White Russian  governor-general presented the case as a crime committed on religious  grounds. In reply he received the fatal resolution of Emperor Nicholas,  dated August 16, 1828, to the following effect:      Whereas the above occurrence demonstrates that the Zhyds[1] make    wicked use of the religious tolerance accorded to them, therefore,    as a warning and as an example to others, let the Jewish schools    (the synagogues) of Velizh be sealed up until farther orders, and    let services be forbidden, whether in them or near them.    [Footnote 1: Compare Vol. I, p, 320, n. 2.]    The imperial resolution was couched in the fierce language of the new  reign which had begun in the meantime. It rose in the bloody mist of the  Velizh affair. The fatal consequences of this synchronism were not  limited to the Jews of Velizh. Judging by the contents and the harsh  wording of the resolution, Nicholas I. was convinced at that time of the  truth of the ritual murder libel. The mysterious and unloved tribe rose  before the vision of the new Tzar as a band of cannibals and evil-doers.  This sinister notion can be traced in the conscription statute which was  then in the course of preparation in St. Petersburg and was soon  afterwards to stir Russian Jewry to its depths, dooming their little  ones to martyrdom.    While punishment was to be meted out to the entire Jewish population of  Russia, the fate of the Velizh community was particularly tragic. It was  subjected to the terrors of a unique state of siege. The whole community  was placed under suspicion. All the synagogues were shut up as if they  were dens of thieves, and the hapless Jews could not even assemble in  prayer to pour out their hearts before God. All business was at a  standstill; the shops were closed, and gloomy faces flitted shyly across  the streets of the doomed city.    The stern command from St. Petersburg ordering that the case be  \"positively probed to the bottom\" and that the culprits be apprehended  gladdened only the heart of Strakhov, the chairman of the Commission of  Inquiry, who was now free to do as he pleased. He spread out the net of  inquiry in ever wider circles. Terentyeva and the other female  witnesses, who were fed well while in prison, and expected not only  amnesty but also remuneration for their services, gave more and more  vent to their imagination. They \"recollected\" and revealed before the  Commission of Inquiry a score of religious crimes which they alleged had  been perpetrated by the Jews prior to the Velizh affair, such as the  murder of children in suburban inns, the desecration of church utensils  and similar misdeeds.    The Commission was not slow in communicating the new revelations to the  Tzar who followed vigilantly the developments in the case. But the  Commission had evidently overreached itself. The Tzar began to suspect  that there was something wrong in this endlessly growing tangle of  crimes. In October, 1827, he attached to the report of the Commission  the following resolution: \"It is absolutely necessary to find out who  those unfortunate children were; this ought to be easy if the whole  thing is not a miserable lie.\" His belief in the guilt of the Jews had  evidently been shaken.    In its endeavors to make up for the lack of substantial evidence, the  commission, personified by Khovanski, put itself in communication with  the governors of the Pale, directing them to obtain information  concerning all local ritual murder cases in past years. The effect of  these inquiries was to revive the Grodno affair of 1818 which had been  \"left to oblivion.\" A certain convert by the name of Gradlnski from the  townlet of Bobovnya, in the government of Minsk, declared before the  Commission of Inquiry that he was ready to point out the description of  the ritual murder ceremony in a \"secret\" Hebrew work. When the book was  produced and the incriminated passage translated, it was found that it  referred to the Jewish rite of slaughtering animals. The apostate, thus  caught red-handed, confessed that he had turned informer in the hope of  making money, and was by imperial command sent into the army. The  confidence of St. Petersburg in the activity of the Velizh Commission of  Inquiry vanished more and more. Khovanski was notified that \"his Majesty  the Emperor, having observed that the Commission bases its deductions  mostly on surmises, by attaching significance to the fits and gestures  of the incriminated during the examinations, is full of apprehension  lest the Commission, carried away by zeal and anti-Jewish prejudice, act  with a certain amount of bias and protract the case to no purpose.\"    Soon afterwards, in 1830, the case was taken out of the hands of the  Commission which had become entangled in a mesh of lies--Strakhov had  died in the meantime--, and was turned over to the Senate.    Weighed down by the nightmare proportions of the material, which the  Velizh Commission had managed to pile up, the members of the Fifth  Department of the Senate which was charged with the case were inclined  to announce a verdict of guilty and to sentence the convicted Jews to  deportation to Siberia, with the application of the knout and whip  (1831). In the higher court, the plenary session of the Senate, there  was a disagreement, the majority voting guilty, while three senators,  referring to the ukase of 1817, were in favor of setting the prisoners  at liberty, but keeping them at the same time under police surveillance.    In 1834 the case reached the highest court of the Empire, the Council of  State, and here for the first time the real facts came to light. Truth  found its champion in the person of the aged statesman, Mordvinov, who  owned some estates near Velizh, and, being well-acquainted with the Jews  of the town, was roused to indignation by the false charges concocted  against them. In his capacity as president of the Department of Civil  and Ecclesiastical Affairs of the Council of State, Mordvinov, after  sifting the evidence carefully, succeeded in a number of sessions to  demolish completely the Babel tower of lies erected by Strakhov and  Khovanski and to adduce proofs that the governor-general, blinded by  anti-Jewish prejudice, had misled the Government by his communications.  The Department of Civil and Ecclesiastical Affairs was convinced by the  arguments of Mordvinov and other champions of the truth, and handed down  a decision that the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15767"],[0,"The Texan Scouts: A Story of the Alamo and Goliad (#14)"],[1,"Old Jack would remain there until his return.  But he addressed to him words of admonition:    \"Be sure that you stay among these trees, old friend,\" he said, \"because  it's likely that when I want you I'll want you bad. Remain and attend to  this grass.\"    Old Jack whinnied softly and, after his fashion, rubbed his nose gently  against his master's arm. It was sufficient for Ned. He was sure that  the horse understood, and leaving him he went back to the arroyo, which  he entered without hesitation.    Ned was well armed, as every one then had full need to be. He wore a  sombrero in the Mexican fashion, and flung over his shoulders was a  great serape which he had found most useful in the winter. With his  perfect knowledge of Spanish and its Mexican variants he believed that  if surprised he could pass as a Mexican, particularly in the night and  among so many.    The arroyo led straight down toward the plain upon which the Mexicans  were encamped, and when he emerged from it he saw that the fires which  at a distance looked like one continuous blaze were scores in number.  Many of them were built of buffalo chips and others of light wood that  burned fast. Sentinels were posted here and there, but they kept little  watch. Why should they? Here was a great Mexican army, and there was  certainly no foe amounting to more than a few men within a hundred  miles.    Ned's heart sank as he beheld the evident extent of the Mexican array.  The little Texan force left in the field could be no match for such an  army as this.    Nevertheless, his resolution to go through the Mexican camp hardened. If  he came back with a true and detailed tale of their numbers the Texans  must believe and prepare. He drew the brim of his sombrero down a little  further, and pulled his serape up to meet it. The habit the Mexicans had  of wrapping their serapes so high that they were covered to the nose was  fortunate at this time. He was now completely disguised, without the  appearance of having taken any unusual precaution.    He walked forward boldly and sat down with a group beside a fire. He  judged by the fact that they were awake so late that they had but little  to do, and he saw at once also that they were Mexicans from the far  south. They were small, dark men, rather amiable in appearance. Two  began to play guitars and they sang a plaintive song to the music. The  others, smoking cigarritos, listened attentively and luxuriously. Ned  imitated them perfectly. He, too, lying upon his elbow before the  pleasant fire, felt the influence of the music, so sweet, so murmurous,  speaking so little of war. One of the men handed him a cigarrito, and,  lighting it, he made pretense of smoking--he would not have seemed a  Mexican had he not smoked the cigarrito.    Lying there, Ned saw many tents, evidence of a camp that was not for the  day only, and he beheld officers in bright uniforms passing among them.  His heart gave a great jump when he noticed among them a heavy-set, dark  man. It was Cos, Cos the breaker of oaths. With him was another officer  whose uniform indicated the general. Ned learned later that this was  Sesma, who had been dispatched with a brigade by Santa Anna to meet Cos  on the Rio Grande, where they were to remain until the dictator himself  came with more troops.    The music ceased presently and one of the men said to Ned:    \"What company?\"    Ned had prepared himself for such questions, and he moved his hand  vaguely toward the left.    \"Over there,\" he said.    They were fully satisfied, and continued to puff their cigarritos,  resting their heads with great content upon pillows made of their  saddles and blankets. For a while they said nothing more, happily  watching the rings of smoke from their cigarritos rise and melt into the  air. Although small and short, they looked hardy and strong. Ned  noticed the signs of bustle and expectancy about the camp. Usually  Mexicans were asleep at this hour, and he wondered why they lingered.  But he did not approach the subject directly.    \"A hard march,\" he said, knowing that these men about him had come a  vast distance.    \"Aye, it was,\" said the man next on his right. \"Santiago, but was it  not, Jose?\"    Jose, the second man on the right, replied in the affirmative and with  emphasis:    \"You speak the great truth, Carlos. Such another march I never wish to  make. Think of the hundreds and hundreds of miles we have tramped from  our warm lands far in the south across mountains, across bare and windy  deserts, with the ice and the snow beating in our faces. How I shivered,  Carlos, and how long I shivered! I thought I should continue shivering  all my life even if I lived to be a hundred, no matter how warmly the  sun might shine.\"    The others laughed, and seemed to Ned to snuggle a little closer to the  fire, driven by the memory of the icy plains.    \"But it was the will of the great Santa Anna, surely the mightiest man  of our age,\" said Carlos. \"They say that his wrath was terrible when he  heard how the Texan bandits had taken San Antonio de Bexar. Truly, I am  glad that I was not one of his officers, and that I was not in his  presence at the time. After all, it is sometimes better to be a common  soldier than to have command.\"    \"Aye, truly,\" said Ned, and the others nodded in affirmation.    \"But the great Santa Anna will finish it,\" continued Carlos, who seemed  to have the sin of garrulity. \"He has defeated all his enemies in  Mexico, he has consolidated his power and now he advances with a mighty  force to crush these insolent and miserable Texans. As I have said, he  will finish it. The rope and the bullet will be busy. In six months  there will be no Texans.\"    Ned shivered, and when he looked at the camp fires of the great army he  saw that this peon was not talking foolishness. Nevertheless his mind  returned to its original point of interest. Why did the Mexican army  remain awake so late?    \"Have you seen the President?\" he asked of Carlos.    \"Often,\" replied Carlos, with pride. \"I fought under him in the great  battle on the plain of Guadalupe less than two years ago, when we  defeated Don Francisco Garcia, the governor of Zacatecas. Ah, it was a  terrible battle, my friends! Thousands and thousands were killed and all  Mexicans. Mexicans killing Mexicans. But who can prevail against the  great Santa Anna? He routed the forces of Garcia, and the City of  Zacatecas was given up to us to pillage. Many fine things I took that  day from the houses of those who presumed to help the enemy of our  leader. But now we care not to kill Mexicans, our own people. It is only  the miserable Texans who are really Gringos.\"    Carlos, who had been the most amiable of men, basking in the firelight,  now rose up a little and his eyes flashed. He had excited himself by his  own tale of the battle and loot of Zacatecas and the coming slaughter of  the Texans. That strain of cruelty, which in Ned's opinion always lay  embedded in the Spanish character, was coming to the surface.    Ned made no comment. His serape, drawn up to his nose, almost met the  brim of his sombrero and nobody suspected that the comrade who sat and  chatted with them was a Gringo, but he shivered again, nevertheless.    \"We shall have a great force when it is all gathered,\" he said at  length.    \"Seven thousand men or more,\" said Jose proudly, \"and nearly all of them  are veterans of the wars. We shall have ten times the numbers of the  Texans, who are only hunters and rancheros.\"    \"Have you heard when we march?\" asked Ned, in a careless tone.    \"As soon as the great Santa Anna arrives it will be decided, I doubt  not,\" said Jose. \"The general and his escort should be here by  midnight.\"    Ned's heart gave a leap. So it was that for which they were waiting.  Santa Anna himself would come in an hour or two. He was very glad that  he had entered the Mexican camp. Bidding a courteous good night to the  men about the fire, he rose and sauntered on. It was easy enough for him  to do so without attracting attention, as many others were doing the  same thing. Discipline seldom amounted to much in a Mexican army, and so  confident were both officers and soldiers of an overwhelming victory  that they preserved scarcely any at all. Yet the expectant feeling  pervaded the whole camp, and now that he knew that Santa Anna was coming  he understood.    Santa Anna was the greatest man in the world to these soldiers. He had  triumphed over everything in their own country. He had exhibited  qualities of daring and energy that seemed to them supreme, and his  impression upon them was overwhelming. Ned felt once more that little  shiver. They might be right in their view of the Texan war.    He strolled on from fire to fire, until his attention was arrested  suddenly by one at which only officers sat. It was not so much the group  as it was one among them who drew his notice so strongly. Urrea was  sitting on the far side of the fire, every feature thrown into clear  relief by the bright flames. The other officers were young men of about  his own age and they were playing dice. They were evidently in high good  humor, as they laughed frequently.    Ned lay down just within the shadow of a tent wall, drew his serape  higher about his face, and rested his head upon his arm. He would have  seemed sound asleep to an ordinary observer, but he was never more wide  awake in his life. He was near enough to hear what Urrea and his friends  were saying, and he intended to hear it. It was for such that he had  come.    \"You lose, Francisco,\" said one of the men as he made a throw of the  dice and looked eagerly at the result. \"What was it that you were saying  about the general?\"    \"That I expect an early advance, Ramon,\" replied Urrea, \"a brief  campaign, and a complete victory. I hate these Texans. I shall be glad  to see them annihilated.\"    The young officer whom he called Ramon laughed.    \"If"]]]
