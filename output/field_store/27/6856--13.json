Space again is the  individual and universal in one; or, in other words, a perception and  also a conception. So easily do what are sometimes called our simple  ideas pass into one another, and differences of kind resolve themselves  into differences of degree.    Within or behind space there is another abstraction in many respects  similar to it--time, the form of the inward, as space is the form of the  outward. As we cannot think of outward objects of sense or of outward  sensations without space, so neither can we think of a succession of  sensations without time. It is the vacancy of thoughts or sensations,  as space is the void of outward objects, and we can no more imagine  the mind without the one than the world without the other. It is to  arithmetic what space is to geometry; or, more strictly, arithmetic may  be said to be equally applicable to both. It is defined in our minds,  partly by the analogy of space and partly by the recollection of events  which have happened to us, or the consciousness of feelings which we are  experiencing. Like space, it is without limit, for whatever beginning or  end of time we fix, there is a beginning and end before them, and so  on without end. We speak of a past, present, and future, and again the  analogy of space assists us in conceiving of them as coexistent. When  the limit of time is removed there arises in our minds the idea of  eternity, which at first, like time itself, is only negative, but  gradually, when connected with the world and the divine nature, like  the other negative infinity of space, becomes positive. Whether time is  prior to the mind and to experience, or coeval with them, is (like  the parallel question about space) unmeaning. Like space it has been  realized gradually: in the Homeric poems, or even in the Hesiodic  cosmogony, there is no more notion of time than of space. The conception  of being is more general than either, and might therefore with greater  plausibility be affirmed to be a condition or quality of the mind. The a  priori intuitions of Kant would have been as unintelligible to Plato as  his a priori synthetical propositions to Aristotle. The philosopher of  Konigsberg supposed himself to be analyzing a necessary mode of thought:  he was not aware that he was dealing with a mere abstraction. But now  that we are able to trace the gradual developement of ideas through  religion, through language, through abstractions, why should we  interpose the fiction of time between ourselves and realities? Why  should we single out one of these abstractions to be the a priori  condition of all the others? It comes last and not first in the order of  our thoughts, and is not the condition precedent of them, but the last  generalization of them. Nor can any principle be imagined more suicidal  to philosophy than to assume that all the truth which we are capable of  attaining is seen only through an unreal medium. If all that exists  in time is illusion, we may well ask with Plato, 'What becomes of the  mind?'    Leaving the a priori conditions of sensation we may proceed to consider  acts of sense. These admit of various degrees of duration or intensity;  they admit also of a greater or less extension from one object, which is  perceived directly, to many which are perceived indirectly or in a less  degree, and to the various associations of the object which are latent  in the mind. In general the greater the intension the less the extension  of them. The simplest sensation implies some relation of objects to  one another, some position in space, some relation to a previous or  subsequent sensation. The acts of seeing and hearing may be almost  unconscious and may pass away unnoted; they may also leave an impression  behind them or power of recalling them. If, after seeing an object we  shut our eyes, the object remains dimly seen in the same or about the  same place, but with form and lineaments half filled up. This is the  simplest act of memory. And as we cannot see one thing without at  the same time seeing another, different objects hang together in  recollection, and when we call for one the other quickly follows. To  think of the place in which we have last seen a thing is often the  best way of recalling it to the mind. Hence memory is dependent on  association. The act of recollection may be compared to the sight of an  object at a great distance which we have previously seen near and seek  to bring near to us in thought. Memory is to sense as dreaming is to  waking; and like dreaming has a wayward and uncertain power of recalling  impressions from the past.    Thus begins the passage from the outward to the inward sense. But as  yet there is no conception of a universal--the mind only remembers  the individual object or objects, and is always attaching to them some  colour or association of sense. The power of recollection seems to  depend on the intensity or largeness of the perception, or on the  strength of some emotion with which it is inseparably connected. This is  the natural memory which is allied to sense, such as children appear to  have and barbarians and animals. It is necessarily limited in range, and  its limitation is its strength. In later life, when the mind has become  crowded with names, acts, feelings, images innumerable, we acquire  by education another memory of system and arrangement which is both  stronger and weaker than the first--weaker in the recollection  of sensible impressions as they are represented to us by eye or  ear--stronger by the natural connexion of ideas with objects or with one  another. And many of the notions which form a part of the train of our  thoughts are hardly realized by us at the time, but, like numbers or  algebraical symbols, are used as signs only, thus lightening the labour  of recollection.    And now we may suppose that numerous images present themselves to the  mind, which begins to act upon them and to arrange them in various  ways. Besides the impression of external objects present with us or just  absent from us, we have a dimmer conception of other objects which have  disappeared from our immediate recollection and yet continue to exist in  us. The mind is full of fancies which are passing to and fro before it.  Some feeling or association calls them up, and they are uttered by the  lips. This is the first rudimentary imagination, which may be truly  described in the language of Hobbes, as 'decaying sense,' an expression  which may be applied with equal truth to memory as well. For memory and  imagination, though we sometimes oppose them, are nearly allied; the  difference between them seems chiefly to lie in the activity of the one  compared with the passivity of the other. The sense decaying in memory  receives a flash of light or life from imagination. Dreaming is a link  of connexion between them; for in dreaming we feebly recollect and also  feebly imagine at one and the same time. When reason is asleep the  lower part of the mind wanders at will amid the images which have been  received from without, the intelligent element retires, and the sensual  or sensuous takes its place. And so in the first efforts of imagination  reason is latent or set aside; and images, in part disorderly, but also  having a unity (however imperfect) of their own, pour like a flood over  the mind. And if we could penetrate into the heads of animals we should  probably find that their intelligence, or the state of what in them is  analogous to our intelligence, is of this nature.    Thus far we have been speaking of men, rather in the points in which  they resemble animals than in the points in which they differ from  them. The animal too has memory in various degrees, and the elements  of imagination, if, as appears to be the case, he dreams. How far their  powers or instincts are educated by the circumstances of their lives  or by intercourse with one another or with mankind, we cannot precisely  tell. They, like ourselves, have the physical inheritance of form,  scent, hearing, sight, and other qualities or instincts. But they  have not the mental inheritance of thoughts and ideas handed down by  tradition, 'the slow additions that build up the mind' of the human  race. And language, which is the great educator of mankind, is wanting  in them; whereas in us language is ever present--even in the infant the  latent power of naming is almost immediately observable. And therefore  the description which has been already given of the nascent power of  the faculties is in reality an anticipation. For simultaneous with their  growth in man a growth of language must be supposed. The child of two  years old sees the fire once and again, and the feeble observation of  the same recurring object is associated with the feeble utterance of the  name by which he is taught to call it. Soon he learns to utter the name  when the object is no longer there, but the desire or imagination of it  is present to him. At first in every use of the word there is a colour  of sense, an indistinct picture of the object which accompanies it. But  in later years he sees in the name only the universal or class word, and  the more abstract the notion becomes, the more vacant is the image  which is presented to him. Henceforward all the operations of his mind,  including the perceptions of sense, are a synthesis of sensations,  words, conceptions. In seeing or hearing or looking or listening the  sensible impression prevails over the conception and the word. In  reflection the process is reversed--the outward object fades away into  nothingness, the name or the conception or both together are everything.  Language, like number, is intermediate between the two, partaking of the  definiteness of the outer and of the universality of the inner world.  For logic teaches us that every word is really a universal, and only  condescends by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1728"],[0,"The Odyssey of Homer (#14)"],[1," had slain. Thinking upon  him he spake winged words:    'Son of Atreus, the ancient Nestor in his own halls was  ever wont to say that thou wert wise beyond man's wisdom,  whensoever we made mention of thee and asked one another  concerning thee. And now, if it be possible, be persuaded  by me, who for one have no pleasure in weeping at supper  time--the new-born day will right soon be upon us. {*} Not  indeed that I deem it blame at all to weep for any mortal  who hath died and met his fate. Lo, this is now the only  due we pay to miserable men, to cut the hair and let the  tear fall from the cheek. For I too have a brother dead,  nowise the meanest of the Argives, and thou art like to  have known him, for as for me I never encountered him,  never beheld him. But men say that Antilochus outdid all,  being excellent in speed of foot and in the fight.'    {* Cf. B. xv.50}    And Menelaus of the fair hair answered him, and said: 'My  friend, lo, thou hast said all that a wise man might say or  do, yea, and an elder than thou;--for from such a sire too  thou art sprung, wherefore thou dost even speak wisely.  Right easily known is that man's seed, for whom Cronion  weaves the skein of luck at bridal and at birth: even as  now hath he granted prosperity to Nestor for ever for all  his days, that he himself should grow into a smooth old age  in his halls, and his sons moreover should be wise and the  best of spearsmen. But we will cease now the weeping which  was erewhile made, and let us once more bethink us of our  supper, and let them pour water over our hands. And again  in the morning there will be tales for Telemachus and me to  tell one to the other, even to the end.'    So spake he, and Asphalion poured water over their hands,  the ready squire of renowned Menelaus. And they put forth  their hands upon the good cheer spread before them.    Then Helen, daughter of Zeus, turned to new thoughts.  Presently she cast a drug into the wine whereof they drank,  a drug to lull all pain and anger, and bring forgetfulness  of every sorrow. Whoso should drink a draught thereof, when  it is mingled in the bowl, on that day he would let no tear  fall down his cheeks, not though his mother and his father  died, not though men slew his brother or dear son with the  sword before his face, and his own eyes beheld it.  Medicines of such virtue and so helpful had the daughter of  Zeus, which Polydamna, the wife of Thon, had given her, a  woman of Egypt, where earth the grain-giver yields herbs in  greatest plenty, many that are healing in the cup, and many  baneful. There each man is a leech skilled beyond all human  kind; yea, for they are of the race of Paeeon. Now after  she had cast in the drug and bidden pour forth of the wine,  she made answer once again, and spake unto her lord:    'Son of Atreus, Menelaus, fosterling of Zeus, and lo, ye  sons of noble men, forasmuch as now to one and now to  another Zeus gives good and evil, for to him all things are  possible,--now, verily, sit ye down and feast in the halls,  and take ye joy in the telling of tales, and I will tell  you one that fits the time. Now all of them I could not  tell or number, so many as were the adventures of Odysseus  of the hardy heart; but, ah, what a deed was this he  wrought and dared in his hardiness in the land of the  Trojans, where ye Achaeans suffered affliction. He subdued  his body with unseemly stripes, and a sorry covering he  cast about his shoulders, and in the fashion of a servant  he went down into the wide-wayed city of the foemen, and he  hid himself in the guise of another, a beggar, though in no  wise such an one was he at the ships of the Achaeans. In  this semblance he passed into the city of the Trojans, and  they wist not who he was, and I alone knew him in that  guise, and I kept questioning him, but in his subtlety he  avoided me. But when at last I was about washing him and  anointing him with olive oil, and had put on him raiment,  and sworn a great oath not to reveal Odysseus amid the  Trojans, ere he reached the swift ships and the huts, even  then he told me all the purpose of the Achaeans. And after  slaying many of the Trojans with the long sword, he  returned to the Argives and brought back word again of all.  Then the other Trojan women wept aloud, but my soul was  glad, for already my heart was turned to go back again even  to my home: and now at the last I groaned for the blindness  that Aphrodite gave me, when she led me thither away from  mine own country, forsaking my child and my bridal chamber  and my lord, that lacked not aught whether for wisdom or  yet for beauty.'    And Menelaus of the fair hair answered her, saying: 'Verily  all this tale, lady, thou hast duly told. Ere now have I  learned the counsel and the thought of many heroes, and  travelled over many a land, but never yet have mine eyes  beheld any such man of heart as was Odysseus; such another  deed as he wrought and dared in his hardiness even in the  shapen horse, wherein sat all we chiefs of the Argives,  bearing to the Trojans death and doom. Anon thou camest  thither, and sure some god must have bidden thee, who  wished to bring glory to the Trojans. Yea and godlike  Deiphobus went with thee on thy way. Thrice thou didst go  round about the hollow ambush and handle it, calling aloud  on the chiefs of the Argives by name, and making thy voice  like the voices of the wives of all the Argives. Now I and  the son of Tydeus and goodly Odysseus sat in the midst and  heard thy call; and verily we twain had a desire to start  up and come forth or presently to answer from within; but  Odysseus stayed and held us there, despite our eagerness.  Then all the other sons of the Achaeans held their peace,  but Anticlus alone was still minded to answer thee. Howbeit  Odysseus firmly closed his mouth with strong hands, and so  saved all the Achaeans, and held him until such time as  Pallas Athene led thee back.'    Then wise Telemachus answered him, and said: 'Menelaus, son  of Atreus, fosterling of Zeus, leader of the host, all the  more grievous it is! for in no way did this courage ward  from him pitiful destruction, not though his heart within  him had been very iron. But come, bid us to bed, that  forthwith we may take our joy of rest beneath the spell of  sleep.'    So spake he, and Argive Helen bade her handmaids set out  bedsteads beneath the gallery, and fling on them fair  purple blankets and spread coverlets above, and thereon lay  thick mantles to be a clothing over all. So they went from  the hall with torch in hand, and spread the beds, and the  henchman led forth the guests. Thus they slept there in the  vestibule of the house, the hero Telemachus and the  splendid son of Nestor. But the son of Atreus slept, as his  custom was, in the inmost chamber of the lofty house, and  by him lay long-robed Helen, that fair lady.    Soon as early Dawn shone forth, the rosy-fingered, Menelaus  of the loud war-shout gat him up from his bed and put on  his raiment, and cast his sharp sword about his shoulder,  and beneath his smooth feet bound his goodly sandals, and  stept forth from his chamber, in presence like a god, and  sat by Telemachus, and spake and hailed him:    'To what end hath thy need brought thee hither, hero  Telemachus, unto fair Lacedaemon, over the broad back of  the sea? Is it a matter of the common weal or of thine own?  Herein tell me the plain truth.'    Then wise Telemachus answered him, and said: 'Menelaus, son  of Atreus, fosterling of Zeus, leader of the host, I have  come if perchance thou mayest tell me some tidings of my  father. My dwelling is being devoured and my fat lands are  ruined, and of unfriendly men my house is full,--who  slaughter continually my thronging flocks, and my kine with  trailing feet and shambling gait,--none other than the  wooers of my mother, despiteful out of measure. So now am I  come hither to thy knees, if haply thou art willing to tell  me of his pitiful death, as one that saw it perchance with  thine own eyes, or heard the story from some other  wanderer; for his mother bare him to exceeding sorrow. And  speak me no soft words in ruth or pity, but tell me plainly  how thou didst get sight of him. Ah, I pray thee, if ever  at all my father, good Odysseus, made promise to thee of  word or work and fulfilled the same in the land of the  Trojans, where ye Achaeans suffered affliction, these  things, I pray thee, now remember and tell me truth.'    Then in heavy displeasure spake to him Menelaus of the fair  hair: 'Out upon them, for truly in the bed of a  brave-hearted man were they minded to lie, very cravens as  they are! Even as when a hind hath couched her newborn  fawns unweaned in a strong lion's lair, and searcheth out  the mountain knees and grassy hollows, seeking pasture, and  afterward the lion cometh back to his bed, and sendeth  forth unsightly death upon that pair, even so shall  Odysseus send forth unsightly death upon the wooers. Would  to our father Zeus and Athene and Apollo, would that in  such might as when of old in stablished Lesbos he rose up  and wrestled a match with Philomeleides and threw him  mightily, and all the Achaeans rejoiced; would that in such  strength Odysseus might consort with the wooers: then  should they all have swift fate, and bitter wedlock! But  for that whereof thou askest and entreatest me, be sure I  will not swerve from the truth in aught that I say, nor  deceive thee; but of all that the ancient one of the sea,  whose speech is sooth, declared to me, not a word will I  hide or keep from thee.    'In the river Aegyptus, {*} though eager I was to press  onward home, the gods they stayed me, for that I had not  offered them the acceptable sacrifice of hecatombs, and the  gods ever desired that men should be mindful of their  commandments. Now there is an island in the wash of the  waves over against Aegyptus, and men call it Pharos, within  one day's "]]]
