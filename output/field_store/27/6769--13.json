There his descendants in the garden  land of Canaan became an agricultural people; and the problem of Moses  and the Judges was to prevent their assimilation in religion and custom  to the settled Semitic tribes about them, and to make them preserve the  ideals born in the starry solitudes of the desert.    [Sidenote: Retrogression in new habitat.]    The change from the nomadic to the sedentary life represents an economic  advance. Sometimes removal to strongly contrasted geographic conditions  necessitates a reversion to a lower economic type of existence. The  French colonists who came to Lower Canada in the seventeenth and  eighteenth centuries found themselves located in a region of intense  cold, where arable soil was inferior in quality and limited in amount,  producing no staple like the tobacco of Virginia or the wheat of  Maryland or the cotton of South Carolina or the sugar of the West  Indies, by which a young colony might secure a place in European trade.  But the snow-wrapped forests of Canada yielded an abundance of  fur-bearing animals, the fineness and thickness of whose pelts were born  of this frozen north. Into their remotest haunts at the head of Lake  Superior or of Hudson Bay, long lines of rivers and lakes opened level  water roads a thousand miles or more from the crude little colonial  capital at Quebec. And over in Europe beaver hats and fur-trimmed  garments were all the style! So the plodding farmer from Normandy and  the fisherman from Poitou, transferred to Canadian soil, were  irresistibly drawn into the adventurous life of the trapper and  fur-trader. The fur trade became the accepted basis of colonial life;  the _voyageur_ and _courier de bois_, clad in skins, paddling up  ice-rimmed streams in their birch-bark canoes, fraternizing with Indians  who were their only companions in that bleak interior, and married often  to dusky squaws, became assimilated to the savage life about them and  reverted to the lower hunter stage of civilization.[76]    [Sidenote: The Boers of South Africa]    Another pronounced instance of rapid retrogression under new unfavorable  geographic conditions is afforded by the South African Boer. The  transfer from the busy commercial cities of the Rhine mouths to the  far-away periphery of the world's trade, from the intensive agriculture  of small deltaic gardens and the scientific dairy farming of the moist  Netherlands to the semi-arid pastures of the high, treeless _veldt_,  where they were barred from contact with the vivifying sea and its  ship-borne commerce, has changed the enterprising seventeenth century  Hollander into the conservative pastoral Boer. Dutch cleanliness has  necessarily become a tradition to a people who can scarcely find water  for their cattle. The comfort and solid bourgeois elegance of the Dutch  home lost its material equipment in the Great Trek, when the long wagon  journey reduced household furniture to its lowest terms. House-wifely  habits and order vanished in the semi-nomadic life which followed.[77]  The gregarious instinct, bred by the closely-packed population of little  Holland, was transformed to a love of solitude, which in all lands  characterizes the people of a remote and sparsely inhabited frontier. It  is a common saying that the Boer cannot bear to see another man's smoke  from his _stoep_, just as the early Trans-Allegheny pioneer was always  on the move westward, because he could not bear to hear his neighbor's  watch-dog bark. Even the Boer language has deteriorated under the  effects of isolation and a lower status of civilization. The native  _Taal_ differs widely from the polished speech of Holland; it preserves  some features of the High Dutch of two centuries ago, but has lost  inflexions and borrowed words for new phenomena from the English,  Kaffirs and Hottentots; can express no abstract ideas, only the concrete  ideas of a dull, work-a-day world.[78]    The new habitat may eliminate many previously acquired characteristics  and hence transform a people, as in the case of the Boers; or it may  intensify tribal or national traits, as in the seafaring propensities of  the Angles and Saxons when transferred to Britain, and of the  seventeenth century English when transplanted to the indented coasts of  New England; or it may tolerate mere survival or the slow dissuetude of  qualities which escape any particular pressure in the new environment,  and which neither benefit nor handicap in the modified struggle for  existence.

CHAPTER III    SOCIETY AND STATE IN RELATION TO THE LAND      [Sidenote: People and land.]    Every clan, tribe, state or nation includes two ideas, a people and its  land, the first unthinkable without the other. History, sociology,  ethnology touch only the inhabited areas of the earth. These areas gain  their final significance because of the people who occupy them; their  local conditions of climate, soil, natural resources, physical features  and geographic situation are important primarily as factors in the  development of actual or possible inhabitants. A land is fully  comprehended only when studied in the light of its influence upon its  people, and a people cannot be understood apart from the field of its  activities. More than this, human activities are fully intelligible only  in relation to the various geographic conditions which have stimulated  them in different parts of the world. The principles of the evolution of  navigation, of agriculture, of trade, as also the theory of population,  can never reach their correct and final statement, unless the data for  the conclusions are drawn from every part of the world, and each fact  interpreted in the light of the local conditions whence it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15299"],[0,"Drake, Nelson and Napoleon (#14)"],[1," the husband of a woman who, there can  be little doubt, did not keep her honour unstained, but who, to him,  was the guiding spirit of his remaining days: and whatever impressions  we may have forced upon us of the liaisons of this noxious creature,  there is nothing on record that suggests that he was ever unfaithful  to her after the bond of union was made. Nor does he appear to have  been openly charged with illicit intimacy with other women after his  marriage to Mrs. Nisbet, other than with Lady Hamilton.    We may talk of his wonderful career being morally blunted, but his own  belief in the sanctity of the verbal arrangement was sound to the  core, and he hazarded the opprobrium of our stern conventional  system. To him, Lady Hamilton had an enduring charm which influenced  his wild, weak, generous soul, and was in fact an inspiration to him.  It is a truism that the life-story of all men has its tragedy and  romance, and in this, Nelson's was only similar to others; and who can  help loving his memory?    The Hamiltons lived with him at Merton when he was on leave. They  shared the cost of the home, which Lady Hamilton had, with elaborate,  artistic taste, prepared for him. A document written by Sir William  makes it clear that the relations of man and wife were strained at  times to breaking-point, for, as he states, \"I am old and she in the  beauty and vigour of youth\"; and then he proceeds: \"I have no  complaint to make, but I feel that the whole attention of my wife is  given to Lord Nelson and his interest at Merton.\" Obviously, this is  the old gentleman's dull way of expressing his idea that there was a  gamble going on with the marriage vow, and then, with delightful  simplicity, he nullifies his suspicious thoughts by stating that he  well knows the purity of Lord Nelson's friendship for Emma and himself  and that he knows how uncomfortable it would make his Lordship, our  best friend, if a separation should take place; therefore he was  determined to do all in his power to prevent such an extremity, which  would be essentially detrimental to all parties, but would be more  sensibly felt by \"_our dear friend than by us_.\"[3] He is willing to  go on provided the expenses do not go on increasing, but as he cannot  expect to live many years, every moment is precious to him, and hopes  that he may be allowed to be his own master _and pass his time in his  own way_.[4] He continues: \"I am fully determined not to have any more  silly altercations that too often arise between us, and embitter his  present moments exceedingly. If we cannot live comfortably together,\"  he continues, \"a wise and well-concerted separation would be  preferable.\" He says he knows and admires her talents and many  excellent qualities, but _he is not blind to her defects_,[5] and  confesses to having many himself, and pleads \"for God's sake to bear  and forbear.\"    Throughout this pathetic document we find evidences that his heart was  torn with the consciousness of the mean advantage being taken of his  friendship. There is a droll, vacillating belief in the virtue of his  wife and the purity of Nelson's motives, but every sentence indicates  that his instinct led him to believe that another had taken his place.  It may have been that he saw it dimly, and that he shrank from making  any direct accusation, not wishing to break with the man with whom he  had long been on close terms of friendship. It is highly improbable  that either his own or Emma's past histories escaped his memory when  he was penning his grievances. Indeed, there are evidences gleaming  through his memorandum that his reflections were harassed by the  remembrance of his own conduct, which had plunged to epic depths of  wrongdoing in other days. These and other considerations would  doubtless have a restraining effect on the action that might have been  taken under different circumstances. Sir William Hamilton must have  pondered over the parentage of Horatia, who was born on the 29th  January, 1801. Is it possible that he knew that Nelson was her father,  and believed in the purity of his friendship for Emma and himself? I  think everything goes to prove that he knew of his friend's relations  with his wife and condoned it. Nelson, in his clumsy, transparent way,  tried to conceal the origin of the child, so he proceeds to write a  letter to Lady Hamilton, which I shall quote later on. To say that Sir  William Hamilton, a man of the world with vast experience of human  deceptions and intrigues, could have been put off the scent, in view  of all the circumstances, is too great a tax on credulity, but it is  wholly characteristic of Nelson's ideas of mystification. But even if  there were any further proof needed, Lady Hamilton has settled the  matter by preserving the correspondence Nelson urged her to destroy.  This will be referred to later on.    Meanwhile, it is hardly thinkable that Nelson, who had such a high  sense of honour in other affairs of life, and who had accepted the  hospitality and been the honoured guest of Sir William Hamilton at  Naples, should have made the occasion an opportunity of establishing  illicit relations with his wife. The whole matter must ever remain a  blot on the great Admiral's fame, even though his host appeared to, or  really did, connive at it. The price was too high to pay for both of  them.    The following extract from a letter from Lord Minto to his wife  indicates the mode of life of the family party. He says:        I went to Lord Nelson's (Merton) on Saturday. The whole      establishment and way of life makes me angry as well as      melancholy. I do not think myself obliged to quarrel with him      for his weakness, though nothing shall ever induce me to give      the smallest countenance to Lady Hamilton. She looks ultimately      to the chance of marriage, as Sir William will not be long in      her way, and she probably indulges a hope that she may survive      Lady Nelson. She is in high looks, but more immense than ever.      She goes on cramming Nelson with trowels of flattery, which he      takes as quietly as a child does pap. The love she makes to him      is ridiculous and disgusting. The whole house, staircase and      all, are covered with pictures of her and him of all sorts and      sizes. He is represented in naval actions, coats of arms, pieces      of plate in his honour, the flagstaff of _L'Orient_. If it were      Lady Hamilton's house, there might be pretence for it; but to      make his own a mere looking-glass to view himself all day is bad      taste.    This letter was written on the 22nd March, 1802, and Nelson writes  that Sir William Hamilton died in his arms and in Lady Hamilton's on  the 6th April, 1803, passing on \"without a struggle, and that the  world had never lost a more upright and accomplished gentleman\";[5]  which, be it said, is rather a stagey performance of his wife's lover.  But the mistress excels her lover in the record of the death-bed  drama. \"Unhappy day,\" says she in profusion of tears, \"for the forlorn  Emma. Ten minutes past ten dear beloved Sir William left me.\" Emma was  poorly provided for; only L700 a year jointure and L100 a year for her  mother for life. She and Nelson appealed to Lord Minto to urge on Mr.  Addington her claim for a pension, and she vowed to Minto that her  connection with Nelson was pure, and he says he can believe it, which  is hardly consistent with the description he gives his wife as to  \"their open and disgusting proceedings,\" or with his comments on a  visit paid to the Duke of Marlborough at Blenheim, where the Duke had  treated the gallant naval chief and his party as though they were mere  ordinary trippers who had come to see the wonders of his possessions.  He condescendingly ordered refreshments to be given to them, which  sent Nelson into a fury of indignation, and Minto excuses the Duke by  stating that Nelson persuaded himself that all the world should be  blind because he chose to extol Emma's \"virtues.\" Obviously, Minto was  not firmly convinced of her chastity.    Nelson, with his heart full of blind adoration, had quite a simple,  sailorly conviction that no one ought to question the innocence of his  attachment to Emma, since he called Hamilton her \"Uncle\"; and, because  he wished the public to believe in his innocence, he took it for  granted that they would believe it. The Duke of Marlborough evidently  had heard and believed in the impure tale, but that did not justify  him in treating his noble guest and his friends in the snobbish and  ill-mannered way he did. It is hardly likely that Nelson would have  paid the visit without being asked, and in ordinary decency he should  have been received or not asked at all. He was a greater figure and  public servant than the Duke, and His Grace would not have suffered in  dignity had he met Nelson on terms of equality. He could not have done  less, at all events. On the other hand, the great Admiral showed a  peevishness at the treatment which was unworthy of his fame and  position; he could well afford to ignore the affront, more especially  as he prided himself that the lady the Duke took exception to was \"in  the sight of Heaven his wife,\" and no one had any right to question  his choice.    The views held by Hamilton and recorded in various conflicting  versions give the impression that he was puzzled, and could not  determine whether to believe in the fidelity of Nelson or not. Some  writers think that he winked at the liaison because of the difference  between his own age and that of his wife; others, that he thought the  relations were innocent, and a token of high-spirited friendship for  himself; but all delicately indicate their conviction that he knew  what was going on. Meanwhile, Nelson steadfastly avows his unyielding  fidelity to his friends, and, with this exception, I think we may  conclude that his devotion to them could always be relied upon;"]]]
