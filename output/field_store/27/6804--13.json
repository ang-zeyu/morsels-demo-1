Each scout has his rifle in his hand, his pipe in his teeth, his bandolier  full of cartridges over his shoulder, and his scanty blanket under his left  arm. No fear of his sleeping at his post. He is fighting for honour, not  for pay; for home, not for glory; and he knows that on his acuteness the  lives of all may depend. He knows that his comrades and the women trust  him, and he values the trust as dearly as British soldier ever did. No  matter how tired he may be, no matter how famished, the Boer sentinel is  never faithless to his orders.    When the scouts are out the laager is fixed for the night--not a very  exhaustive proceeding, as the Boers do not go in for luxuries of any kind.  Here a tarpaulin is stretched over a kind of temporary ridge pole, blankets  are tossed down on the hard earth, saddles are used for pillows, and the  couch is complete. A little way farther down the line a rude canvas screen  is thrown over the wheels of a waggon, and a family, or rather husband and  wife, make themselves at home under the waggon; whilst the single men  simply throw themselves at full length on the ground, wrap their one thin,  small blanket round them, and smoke and jest merrily enough, whilst the  Kaffirs light the fires and make the coffee. There is scarcely any timber  in this part of Africa, and the fuel used is the dried manure of cattle  pressed into slabs about fifteen inches long, eight inches wide, and three  inches thick. The smoke from the fires is very dense, and soon fills the  air with a pungent odour, which is not unpleasant in the open, but would be  simply intolerable in a building. The coffee is soon made, and the simple  meal begins; it consists of \"rusks,\" a kind of bread baked until it becomes  crisp and hard, and plenty of steaming hot coffee. I never saw any people  so fond of this beverage as the Boers are. The Australian bushman and  digger loves tea, and can almost exist upon it; but these Boers cling to  coffee. They live, when out in laager, like Spartans, they dress anyhow,  sleep anyhow, and eat just rusks and precious little else. Talk about  \"Tommy\" and his hard times, why a private soldier at the front sleeps  better, dresses better, and eats better than a Boer general; yet never once  did I hear a Boer complain of hardships. After tea the Boers sit about and  clean their rifles; the women move from one little group to another,  chatting cheerfully, but I saw nothing in their conduct, or in the conduct  of any man towards one of them, that would cause the most chaste matron in  Great Britain to blush or droop her eyes. There is in the laager an utter  absence of what we term soldierly discipline; men moved about, went and  came in a free and easy fashion, just as I have seen them do a thousand  times in diggers' camps. There was no saluting of officers, no stiffness,  no starch anywhere. The general lounges about with hands in pockets and  pipe in mouth; no one pays him any special deference. He talks to the men,  the striplings, and the women, and they talk back to him in a manner which  seems strange to a Britisher familiar to the ways of military camps. After  the chatting, the pridikant, or parson, if there is one in the laager,  raises his hands, and all listen with reverent faces whilst the man of God  utters a few words in a solemn, earnest tone; then all kneel, and a prayer  floats up towards the skies, and a few moments later the whole camp is  wrapped in sleep, nothing is heard but the neighing of horses, the lowing  of cattle, the bleating of sheep, and the occasional barking of a dog.  There is no clatter of arms, no ringing of bugles, no deep-toned challenge  of sentries, no footfall of changing pickets.    At regular intervals men rise silently from the ranks of the sleepers, pick  up their rifles noiselessly, and silently, like ghosts, slip out into the  deep shadows of the kopjes, and other men, equally silent, glide in from  posts they have been guarding, and stretch themselves out to snatch slumber  whilst they may. At dawn the men toss their blankets aside, and spring up  ready dressed, and move amongst their horses; the Kaffirs attend to the  morning meal, the everlasting rusks and coffee are served up, horses are  saddled, cattle are yoked to waggons, and in the twinkling of an eye the  camp is broken up, and the irregular army is on the march again, with  scouts guarding every pass in front, scouts watching (themselves unseen) on  every height. They travel fast, because they travel light; they use very  little water, because they find it impossible to move it from place to  place. Many critics charge them with habits of personal uncleanliness. It  is true that in their laagers one does not see as much soap and water used  as in our camps, but this is possibly due to want of opportunity as much as  to want of inclination. In sanitary matters they are neglectful. I did not  see a single latrine in any of their laagers, nor do I think they are in  the habit of making them, and to this cause and to no other I attribute the  large amount of fever in their ranks. They do not seem to understand the  first principles of the laws of sanitation, and had this season been a wet,  instead of a peculiarly dry one, I venture to assert that typhoid fever  would have wrought far more havoc amongst them than our rifles.    I saw no literature in laager except Bibles. I witnessed no sports of any  kind, and the only sport I heard them talk about was horse-racing. I saw no  gambling, heard no blasphemy, noticed no quarrelling or bickering, and can  only say, from my slight acquaintance with life in Boer laager in war time,  that it may be rough, it may be irksome, it may not be so fastidiously  clean as a feather-bed soldier might like it, but I have been in many  tougher, rougher places, and never heard anyone cry about it.                                     THROUGH BOER GLASSES.                                                                  BURGHERSDORP.      I had a good many opportunities of chatting with Boers during the time  which elapsed between my capture and liberation, and had a long talk with  the President of the Orange Free State, Mr. Steyn; also with several of his  ministerial colleagues. Their ministers of religion, whom they call  pridikants, also chatted to me freely, as occasion offered. I had more than  one interview with their fighting generals. Medical men in their service I  found very much akin to medical men the world over. They patched up the  wounded and asked no questions concerning nationality, just as our own  medicos do. Personally, I must say that I found the Boers first-class  subjects for Press interviews. They did not know much about journalists and  the ways of journalism. Possibly had they had more experience in regard to  \"interviews,\" I should not have found them quite so easy to manage, but it  never seemed to enter their heads that a man might make good \"copy\" out of  a quiet chat over pipes and tobacco. One of their stock subjects of  conversation was their great General, the man of Magersfontein--General  Cronje.    \"What do you Britishers and Australians think of Cronje?\" was a stock  question with them. \"Do you think him a good fighter?\"    \"Well, yes, unquestionably he is a good fighting man.\"    \"Do you think him as good as Lord Roberts?\"    \"No. We men of British blood don't think there are many men on earth as  good as the hero of Candahar.\"    \"Do you think him as good a man as Lord Kitchener?\"    \"No. Very many of us consider the conqueror of the Soudan to be one who, if  he lives, will make as great a mark in history as Wellington.\"    At this a joyous smile would illuminate the face of the Boer. He would  reply, \"Yes, yes; Roberts is a great man, a very great man indeed. So is  Kitchener, so is General French, so is General Macdonald, so is General  Methuen. Yet all those five men are attempting to get Cronje into a corner  where they can capture him. They have ten times as many soldiers as Cronje  has, ten times as many guns; therefore, what a really great man Cronje must  be on your own showing.\"    That was before the fatal 27th of February on which Cronje surrendered.    I often asked them how they, representing a couple of small States, came to  get hold of the idea that they could whip a colossal Power like Great  Britain in a life or death struggle; and almost invariably they informed me  that they had expected that one of the great European Powers would take an  active part in the struggle on their behalf, and, furthermore, they had  been taught to think that Britain's Empire was rotten to the core, so much  so that as soon as war commenced in earnest all her colonies would fall  away from her and hoist the flag of independence, and that India would leap  once again into open and bloody mutiny. They expressed themselves as being  dumbfounded when they heard that Australian troops were rallying under the  Union Jack, and seemed to feel most bitterly that the men from the land of  the Southern Cross were in arms against them. \"We fell out with England,  and we thought we had to fight England. Instead we find we have to fight  people from all parts of the world, Colonials like ourselves. Surely  Australia and Canada might have kept out of this fight, and allowed us to  battle it out with the country we had a quarrel with.\"    \"The Canadians and Australians are of British blood.\"    \"Well, what if they are? Ain't plenty of the Cape Volunteers who are  fighting under President Kruger's banner born of Dutch parents? Yet,  because they fight against Englishmen, you call them all rebels, and talk  of punishing them when the war is over, if you win, just because they lived  on your side of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16140"],[0,"The Curious Book of Birds (#14)"],[1,"upon a time, our friend Blackbird, who comes first of the feathered  brothers in the spring, was not black at all. No, indeed; he was  white--white as feather-snow new fallen in the meadow. There are very  few birds who have been thought worthy to dress all in beautiful white,  for that is the greatest honor which a bird can have. So, like the Swan  and the Dove, Master Whitebird--for that is what they called him  then--was very proud of his spotless coat.    He was very proud and happy, and he sang all day long, the jolliest  songs. But you see he did not really deserve this honor, because he was  at heart a greedy bird; and therefore a great shame came upon him, and  after that he was never proud nor happy any more. I shall tell you the  story of how the Whitebird grew grimy and gloomy as we know him, almost  as black and solemn as old Daddy Crow.    Once upon a time, then, Master Whitebird was teetering on a rose-bush,  ruffling his beautiful white feathers and singing little bits of poetry  about himself to any one who would listen.        \"Ho-ho, ho-hee,      Just look at me!\"    he piped, and cocked his little eyes about in every direction, to see  who might be admiring his wondrous whiteness.    But all on a sudden his song gurgled down into his throat and choked  itself still, and his eyes fixed themselves upon a tree close by. It was  a dead old tree, and there was a hole in the trunk halfway up to the  lowest limb, a round little hole about as big as your two fists.    Whitebird had seen something black pop into that hole in a sly and  secret way, and he began to wonder; for he was inquisitive, as most  birds are. He sat quite still on his rose-bush and watched and watched.  Presently out of the hole popped a black head, bigger than Whitebird's,  with two wise little twinkling eyes.    \"Oho!\" said Whitebird to himself, \"it is Mother Magpie up to her old  tricks, hiding, hiding. Maybe she has a treasure hidden there. I will  watch, and perhaps I shall find out something worth knowing.\"    Mother Magpie was the wisest and the slyest of all the birds, and it was  always worth while, as Whitebird knew, to take lessons of her. So he sat  perfectly still until she came cautiously back carrying something in her  beak. It was round and white and glinted like moonlight. Whitebird's  eyes stuck out greedily.    \"It is a piece of silver!\" he thought, but he sat perfectly still until  the Magpie had stowed the coin safely in the hollow tree and had hopped  away as if upon an unfinished errand. \"Aha! there is more then. I will  watch to see what comes next,\" said Whitebird. And he waited.    Sure enough. In a little while the Magpie returned, this time bringing  something which glowed yellow like sunlight.    \"It is a piece of gold!\" gasped Whitebird, and his eyes bulged out like  those of lobsters, he was so jealous of her luck. But he silently  watched her disappear into her tree-cupboard and then hastily depart as  before toward the mountain. \"What comes next?\" muttered Whitebird to  himself. \"I am dying to peep into that hole. I cannot wait much longer.\"    Then, after a while, a third time came back the Magpie to the dead tree.  And lo, what she carried in her beak twinkled and trembled and shone in  many colors, like a drop of dew on a velvet flower-cheek. When  Whitebird saw this sight, he nearly tumbled off his perch with  excitement.    \"It is a diamond!\" he cried aloud; \"oh, it is a real diamond!\"    At this sudden noise from the rose-bush Mother Magpie's nerves were so  shocked that she dropped the diamond helter-skelter into the hole. And  in a moment she fell in after it, out of sight. She hoped that no one  had seen her, but little Whitebird knew the place. He hopped after her  and, perching on the edge of the hole, peered down into the hollow tree.  And there he saw a great heap of silver and gold and precious stones,  which Mother Magpie was trying to cover with her wings.    \"Oh, what a treasure! What a treasure!\" he piped greedily. \"Mother  Magpie, you must tell me where you found it, that I may go and get some  for myself.\"    But Mother Magpie refused to tell.    \"Oho!\" chirped Whitebird, angrily; \"we shall see about that! Then I will  call in the fierce birds, Robber Hawk and Fighting Falcon and the bloody  Butcher Bird, and they will take your treasure from you, and kill you,  too, into the bargain. What do you think of that, Mother Magpie?\"    Then she was afraid, for she knew those bad birds; and she saw that she  must trust her secret with Whitebird, since he had already discovered  half the truth.    \"Well, if you will promise me not to let any one else know, not even  King Eagle, I will tell you,\" she said. So Whitebird promised.    \"Listen,\" said the Magpie. \"You must find the cave which is near the  tallest oak on the mountain, under the flat stone. In a corner there is  a tiny hole, just big enough for you or me to pass. And this is the  entrance to a passage which leads down into the cellars of the earth.  And when you have gone down and down, farther than any one except myself  ever went before, you will come to the palace of the King of Riches. It  is full of gold and silver and precious stones like these you see here.  Each chamber is more beautiful and more tempting than the last. But you  must not touch a stone or a single coin, or even a little bit of  gold-dust, until you have seen the King. For first you must offer  yourself to be his servant, and then he will be generous; then he will  let you carry away as much treasure as your beak will hold. That is all  there is to it. But beware, greedy Whitebird! Take my advice, and do not  touch a grain of treasure before you see the King, or great evil will  befall you.\"    Whitebird promised to do as she said. And then away he flew to the blue  mountain and its tallest oak. Close by the great oak, in a lonely spot,  he found the flat rock, and under it was the cave where once a bear had  lived. Whitebird hopped in eagerly, and away back in one corner of the  cave he found a little round hole, as the Magpie had said; a hole not  much bigger than an apple. It must have been a tight squeeze for fat  Mother Magpie!    Whitebird hopped through the hole and found himself in a long, narrow  passage which led down, down, down into places where his eyes were of no  use at all. For he was not like Master Owl, who can see better in the  dark than anywhere else. Blindly he hopped on and on, till he came into  a great cavern, bright with a white radiance, as if the moonlight  filtered in from somewhere. It was the first room of the King's palace  of treasure; and it was all of silver, paved with silver, heaped with  silver, shining with silver. Whitebird's eyes glittered and he wanted to  stop and take some for himself. But just in time he remembered the wise  warning of Mother Magpie; and so he hopped on over the silver pebbles  through a silver door into a second room. And this was flooded with  yellow light as of sunshine, so dazzling that for a moment Whitebird's  yellow eyes could see nothing at all. When he could see, the place  seemed full of yellow eyes like his own, great yellow eyes heaped up  from floor to ceiling. And when he became used to this he looked again  and saw that these were golden coins, and that this was a cavern all of  gold.    Oh, such a wonderful sight! Oh, such a golden dream! The floor on which  he stood was deep with gold dust, which squished between his toes like  yellow sand on a sea beach. And then Whitebird lost his head and went  quite mad, forgetting the words of wise Mother Magpie.    \"Gold dust, gold dust, a treasure for me!\" he sang, hopping up and down  on one leg. \"I can carry away a great beakful of the yellow seeds, and  each one will blossom into a golden flower for me--for me--for me!\" He  was wholly crazy, as you see.    He thrust his bill deep into the gold dust of the floor, and greedily  filled it more than full, till it dropped over his white, white feathers  and splashed his coat so that he was no longer a white bird but a yellow  bird. Oh, the silly, greedy thing! But there are worse fates than being  a yellow bird.    Just at this moment a dreadful roar echoed through the caverns till they  rumbled like an earthquake, and into the golden chamber crashed a  horrible dragon-creature, the guardian of the King's treasure. His eyes  blazed red like coals, and from his mouth came smoke and flame so that  the gold melted before his breath. He rushed straight upon poor little  Whitebird to gobble him up, and as he came he roared: \"Thief, thief! who  steals my master's treasure? I scorch you with my eye! I burn you with  my breath! I swallow you into the furnace of my throat. Gr-r-r-r!\"    There seemed no chance for Whitebird to escape, the creature was so  near. But with a cry of terror he fluttered and hopped away as fast as  he could toward the narrow passage, through the gold chamber and the  silver chamber, leaving all the treasure behind. (Oh, don't you wish we  could have known how the diamond chamber looked, with its rainbow  light?)    Whitebird hopped and fluttered, fluttered and hopped, feeling the  dragon's hot breath close behind frizzling his feathers and blinding his  eyes with smoke. He seemed like to be roasted alive in this horrible  underground oven. But oh, there was the hole close before him! Pouf!  With a terrible roar the dragon snapped at him as Whitebird popped  through the hole; but he got only a mouthful of burnt tail-feathers.  Whitebird was safe, safe in the narrow passage where the dragon could  not follow. Up and up and up and up he feebly fluttered into the light  of the dear outside world, and then he gave a chirp of joy to find that  he really had escaped. But oh, how tired and frightened he was!    Mother Magpie was sitting on a bush waiting for him, for she had guessed  what would happen to the greedy bird. And when she saw him she gave a  squawk of"]]]
