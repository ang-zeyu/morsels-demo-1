The gales of the mercy of the Merciful One have converted these  servants and drawn them to the region of the [Divine] Unity--'The witness  of the faithful lover is in his sleeve'--but some of the doctors of Persia  have troubled the most luminous heart of the King of the Age with regard  to those who are admitted into the Sanctuary of the Merciful One and those  who make for the Kaaba of Wisdom. O would that the world-ordering judgment  of the King might decide that this Servant should meet those doctors, and,  in the presence of His Majesty the King, adduce arguments and proofs! This  Servant is ready, and hopeth of God that such a conference may be brought  about, so that the truth of the matter may become evident and apparent  before His Majesty the King. And afterwards the decision is in thy hand,  and I am ready to confront the throne of thy sovereignty; then give  judgment for Me or against Me. The Merciful Lord saith in the Furqan,  which is the enduring proof amidst the host of existences, 'Desire death,  then, if ye be sincere.'(30) He hath declared the desiring of death to be  the proof of sincerity; and it will be apparent in the mirror of the  [King's] luminous mind which party it is that hath this day foregone life  in the way of Him [Who is] adored by the dwellers upon earth. Had the  doctrinal books of this people, [composed] in proof of that wherein they  are, been written with the blood which has been shed in His way (exalted  is He), books innumerable would assuredly have been apparent and visible  amongst mankind.    \"How, then, can one repudiate this people, whose words and deeds are  consistent, and accept those persons who neither have foregone nor will  forego one atom of the consideration [which they enjoy] in the way of  [God] the Sovereign?    \"Some of the doctors of Persia who have denounced this Servant have never  either met or seen Him, nor [even] become cognizant of [His] intent:  nevertheless they said what they desired and do what they will. Every  statement requires proof, and is not [established] merely by assertion or  by outward gear of asceticism.    \"A translation of some passages from the contents of the Hidden Book of  Fatimih (upon her be the blessings of God) which are apposite to this  place will [now] be submitted in the Persian language, in order that some  things [now] concealed may be revealed before the [Royal] Presence. Those  addressed in these utterances in the above-mentioned book (which is today  known as 'Hidden Words') are those people who are outwardly notable for  science and piety, but who are inwardly subservient to their passions and  lust. He says:    \"'O faithless ones! Why do ye outwardly claim to be shepherds, while  inwardly ye have become the wolves of My sheep? Your likeness is like unto  the star before the morning, which is apparently bright and luminous, but  really causeth the misguidance and destruction of the caravans of My city  and country.'    \"So likewise He saith:    \"'O outwardly fair and inwardly faulty! Thy likeness is like unto clear  bitter water, wherein outwardly the utmost sweetness and purity is beheld,  but when it falleth into the assaying hands of the taste of the [Divine]  Unity He doth not accept a single drop thereof. The radiance of the sun is  on the earth and on the mirror alike; but regard the difference as from  the guard-stars to the earth; nay, between them is a limitless distance.'    \"'So likewise He saith:    \"'O child of the world! Many a morning hath the effulgence of My grace  come unto thy place from the day-spring of the placeless, found thee on  the couch of ease busied with other things, and returned like the  lightning of the spirit to the bright abode of glory. And I, desiring not  thy shame, declared it not in the retreats of nearness to the hosts of  holiness.'    \"'So likewise He saith:    \"'O pretender to My friendship! In the morning the breeze of My grace  passed by thee, and found thee sleeping on the bed of heedlessness, and  wept over thy condition, and turned back.' Finis.    \"In the presence of the King's justice, therefore, the statement of an  adversary ought not to be accepted as sufficient. And in the Furqan, which  distinguisheth between truth and falsehood, He says, 'O ye who believe, if  there come unto you a sinner with a message, then discriminate, lest you  fall upon a people in ignorance and on the morrow repent of what ye have  done.'(31) And it hath come down in holy tradition, 'Credit not the  calumniator.' The matter hath been misapprehended by certain doctors,  neither have they seen this Servant. But those persons who have met [Him]  testify that this Servant hath not spoken contrary to that which God hath  ordained in the Book, and recite this blessed verse: He saith (exalted is  He) 'Do ye disavow Us for aught save that We believe in God, and what hath  been sent down unto Us, and what was sent down before?'(32)    \"O King of the age! The eyes of these wanderers turn and gaze in the  direction of the mercy of the Merciful One, and assuredly to these  afflictions shall the greatest mercy succeed, and after these most  grievous hardships shall follow great ease. But [Our] hope is this, that  His Majesty the King will himself turn his attention to [these] matters,  which thing will be the cause of hope in [Our] hearts. And this is unmixed  good which hath been submitted, and God sufficeth for a witness.    \"Glory be to Thee, O God! O God, I bear witness that the heart of the King  is between the fingers of Thy power: if Thou pleasest, turn it, O God, in  the direction of mercy and kindliness: verily Thou art the Exalted, the  Potent, the Beneficent: there is no God but Thee, the Mighty from whom  help is sought.    \"Concerning the qualifications of the doctors, He saith: 'But amongst the  lawyers he who guardeth himself, observeth his religion, opposeth his  lust, and obeyeth the command of his Lord--it is incumbent on the people  to follow him...' unto the end. And if the King of the age will regard  this utterance, which proceeded from the tongue of the recipient of divine  inspiration, he will observe that those characterized by the qualities  transmitted in the aforementioned tradition are rarer than the  philosopher's stone. Therefore the claim of every person pretending to  science neither hath been nor is heard.    \"So likewise in describing the lawyers of the latter time He says: 'The  lawyers of that time are the most evil of lawyers under the shadow of  heaven: from them cometh forth mischief, and unto them it returneth.'    \"And if any person deny these traditions, the establishing thereof is  [incumbent] on this Servant; but since [Our] object is brevity therefore  the detail of the authorities hath not been submitted.    \"Those doctors who have indeed drunk of the cup of renunciation never  interfered with this Servant, even as the late _Sh_ay_kh_ Murtada (may God  exalt his station and cause him to dwell under the shadow of the domes of  His grace) used to show [Us] affection during the days of [Our] sojourn in  'Iraq, and used not to speak concerning this matter otherwise than God  hath permitted. We ask God to help all [men] unto that which He loveth and  approveth.    \"Now all people have shut their eyes to all [these] matters, and are bent  on the persecution of this sect; so that should it be demanded of certain  persons, who (after God's grace) rest in the shadow of the King's clemency  and enjoy unbounded blessings, 'In return for the King's favor what  service have ye wrought? Have ye by wise policy added any country to [his]  countries? Or have ye applied yourselves to aught which would cause the  comfort of the people, the prosperity of the kingdom, and the continuance  of fair fame for the state?', they have no reply save this, that, falsely  or truly, they designate a number of persons in the presence of the King  by the name of Babis, and forthwith engage in slaughter and plunder; even  as in Tabriz and elsewhere they sold certain ones, and received much  wealth; and this was never represented before the presence of the King.  All these things have occurred because of this, that they have found these  poor people without a helper. They have foregone matters of moment, and  have fallen upon these poor unfortunates.    \"Many sects and diverse tribes rest tranquil in the shadow of the King,  and of these sects one is this people. Were it not best that the lofty  endeavor and magnanimity of those who surround the King should be so  witnessed: that they should be scheming for all factions to come under the  King's shadow, and that they should govern amidst all with justice? To put  in force the ordinances of God is unmixed justice, and with this all are  satisfied; nay, the ordinances of God [ever] have been and will be the  instrument and means for the protection of [His] creatures, as He saith  (exalted is He) 'And in retaliation ye have life, O people of  understanding.'(33) [But] it is far from the justice of His Majesty the  King that, for the fault of one person, a number of persons should become  the objects of the scourges of wrath. God (glorious is His mention) saith:  'None shall bear the burden of another.'(34) And this is sufficiently  evident, that in every community there have been and will be learned and  ignorant, wise and foolish, sinful and pious. And to commit abominable  actions is far from the wise man. For the wise man either seeketh the  world or abandoneth it. If he abandoneth it, assuredly he will not regard  aught save God, and, apart from this, the fear of God will withhold him  from committing forbidden and culpable actions. And if he seeketh the  world, he will assuredly not commit deeds which will cause and induce the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19312"],[0,"Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas (#14)"],[1,"was read and its contents caused joy and happiness. Thank God  that in such a cycle ye have stepped into the plane of existence, attained  the glory of the Lord of the Kingdom, obtained light from the Sun of Truth  and were ushered in under the shadow of the Tree of Life in the paradise  of joy.    Give the name \"Rooha\" (i.e., Spiritual) to your new born child, and let  your own name be \"Saffa\" (this, in Arabic, means Peter or Rock).          \"O ye two truthful believers!...\"      O ye two(42) truthful believers!    Your letter was received. It contents were faith, certainty and sincerity.  It was an evidence of perceiving eyes, attentive ears and acute mind. Were  it not so, ye would not have witnessed the lights of the Sun of Truth,  heard the divine Call, nor attained the knowledge of God.    Although in body we are far from one another, yet--praise be to God! --with  life and heart we are present in one assembly; we enjoy the spiritual  meeting, abide under the shadow of one Blessed Tree, are attracted to the  beauty of one Beloved and gaze in the direction of one Object. Therefore,  be not sorry on account of the remoteness, but rather engage in the  commemoration of God and praise Him. I hope that we may be together in all  the worlds of God.    Teach the dear child Rooha this commune:    O God! Rear this little babe in the bosom of Thy love and give it milk  from the breat of Providence. Cultivate this fresh plant in the  rose-garden of Thy love and nurture it by showers from the clouds of  Providence. Make it a child of the Kingdom and lead it to the divine  world. Thou art powerful and kind! Thou art the Giver, the Bestower, whose  blessings precede all else!          \"O thou who art attracted by the Word of God!...\"      O thou who art attracted by the Word of God!    Verily, I read thy letter which contained new significances. I ask God to  make thee a new creature so that the lights of human perfections may shine  through thee and to make thee kind hearted unto all human beings so that  thou mayest be a mercy unto souls, absolute goodness to all, a sign of  kindness, a word of tenderness. Verily, thy Lord is the Mighty, the  Powerful! He reviveth whomsoever He wisheth by the spirit of righteousness  and granteth unto whom He wisheth great bounty, guideth whom He wisheth  unto the path of life and confirmeth whom He desireth in attaining the  Kingdom of God.    As to thee, be confident in the mercy of thy Lord, and ask what thou  desirest. Verily, God is the Generous, the Giver!          \"O maid-servant of God, who art supplicating unto the...\"      O maid-servant of God, who art supplicating unto the Sublime Kingdom!    Grieve not at the divine trials. Be not troubled because of hardships and  ordeals; turn unto God, bowing in humbleness and praying to Him, while  bearing every ordeal, contented under all conditions and thankful in every  difficulty. Verily thy Lord loveth His maid-servants who are patient,  believing and firm. He draws them nigh unto Him through these ordeals and  trials.    Be not sorrowful on account of the departure of thy good son. He hath  indeed departed from this narrow and gloomy world which is darkened by  unlimited sorrow, unto the Kingdom which is spacious, illumined, joyous  and beautiful. God delivered him from this dark well and promoted him unto  the Supreme Height! He gave him wings whereby he soared to the heaven of  happiness. Verily this is the great mercy from Him who is precious and  forgiving.          \"O thou who art advancing to the Dawning-point of...\"      O thou who art advancing to the Dawning-point of Lights!    Extend the hands of communion unto the sacred and brilliant Threshold and  read the following prayer:    O my God! O my God! Glory be unto Thee for that Thou hast confirmed me to  the confession of Thy Oneness, attracted me unto the word of Thy  Singleness, enkindled me by the fire of Thy love, and occupied me with Thy  mention and the service of Thy friends and maid-servants.    O Lord, help me to be meek and lowly and strengthen me in severing myself  from all things and in holding to the hem of the garment of Thy Glory, so  that my heart may be filled with Thy love and leave no space for the love  of the world and the attachment to its qualities.    O God! Sanctify me from all else save Thee, purge me from the dross of  sins and transgressions and cause me to possess a spiritual heart and  conscience.    Verily Thou art merciful and verily Thou art the Generous, the Helper.          \"O thou dear maid-servant of God!...\"      O thou dear maid-servant of God!    Thy likeness (photograph) was received through Mrs. .......... and was  seen. The light of faith shone in thy brow and the smile of the Kingdom in  thy face. When I saw that likeness, I supplicated and implored, at the  Threshold of the Lord of the Kingdom, to make thee a dear one of the two  realms and to free thee from every fetter save the love of God.          \"O thou flower perfumed by the Breaths of the Love...\"      O thou flower perfumed by the Breaths of the Love of God!    Verily, I read thy written letter and have supplicated unto God to receive  thee in His Kingdom, to make thee worthy to be called a child of the  Kingdom, to be firm in the Covenant of God as firm mountains and to  proclaim in His Great Covenant which He hath entered into which the people  of heaven and earth by a trace of His Supreme Pen, until thou mayest be  confirmed to diffuse the fragrance of holiness in those climes and  regions.          \"O thou who dost believe in the Unity of God!...\"      O thou who dost believe in the Unity of God!    Know verily nothing will benefit a person save the love of the Merciful  One. Nothing illuminates a man's heart save the radiance which shines  forth from the Kingdom of God! Put away every thought and doubtful  mentioning and keep thy thoughts entirely on that which uplifts man to the  heaven of the gift of God and that which causes every bird that belongs to  the Kingdom to soar unto the incomparable realms, the center of  everlasting grandeur in this world.          \"O servant of God!...\"      O servant of God!    What thou hast written and that which thou hast retained in mind are  evident. Appreciate Mrs. ...... who reminds you of God and explains His  divine mysteries.    Regarding thy question concerning a verse in the 22nd chapter of Exodus:  We gave a brief explanation of it in a letter to Mrs. .......... Please  refer to that. Owing to the great (press of) work, I have not the time for  several explanations.    I ask God that thou mayest attain such a state of perception, as will  enable thee to expound with knowledge the words of the Holy Bible.          \"O thou who art supplicating unto the Kingdom of God!...\"      O thou who art supplicating unto the Kingdom of God!    Rest assured in the mercy of thy Lord; be rejoiced for my remembering  thee; gladden thyself by the appearance of the Kingdom of God, be  attracted by the fragrance of God and call out: \"Ya Baha El-ABHA!\"--from  the depths of thy heart with all meekness and supplication, attracted by  the fire of the love of God. (Then annoint or rub all the parts of the  body.)    Verily, I say unto thee, if thou attainest the condition we demonstrate to  thee (i.e., if thou followest the directions given) be confident in the  speedy recovery through the favor of God.          \"O thou who art advancing unto the Kingdom of God!...\"      O thou who art advancing unto the Kingdom of God!    I ask God to make thee a helper to the maid-servants of the Merciful, to  walk in the path of salvation, to disperse the clouds of doubt from the  horizon of the hearts, to make the sun of knowledge manifest unto souls  and spirits and to confirm thee in a matter which will make thee to raise  the banner of the Covenant in the world.          \"O dear servant of God!...\"      O dear servant of God!    Observe how dear thou wert that He guided thee to the Kingdom of Light,  and how near to His Threshold, that He granted thee admission into His  Court. Thou were poor in spirit; He led thee to the Heavenly Treasure.  Thou wert in quest of illumination; He enlightened thee through the rays  of the Sun of Truth. Thou wert athirst; He led thee to the Spring of Life.  Thou wert sick; He bestowed upon thee the Heavenly Remedy.    I have read thy letter and have considered its contents. Know this: That  today whoever turns to the Kingdom of the Glorious God, holds communion  with the Almighty One, the Omniscient, and lives wholly the true and good  life, the doors of progress and help will be opened unto him everywhere;  such an one will be aided, victorious and protected.    Therefore, turn to the Supreme Kingdom, forget thyself entirely and remain  firm in the spiritual trials, so that thou mayest see the favors of the  Kingdom and realize the heavenly confirmation.          \"O thou who art uttering the praise of God!...\"      O thou who art uttering the praise of God!    Verily I read thy letter, which expressed thy surprise at some of the  commandments of the law of God, such as that concerning the hunting of  innocent animals. Be not surprised at this. Ponder over the contingent  realities, their mysteries, wisdom, connection and relations. The world is  harmonious in all things and the connection therein is mighty and nothing  is missing. All things are eaters and eaten in the physical creation. The  plant sucks from the mineral, the animal eats and swallows the plant, and  the human eats the animal. Then the mineral (in turn) eats the human body.  Physical bodies are transferred from death to death and life to life.  Therefore, all things are subject to transfer and change except the Cause  of existence, which cannot be changed or transferred, because it is the  foundation for life in all kinds and species and in all possible realities  in the world of creation.
