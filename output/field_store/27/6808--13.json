Notwithstanding all the precautions to prevent the mischief that might  happen at these martial exercises few were exhibited in which a great  number were not wounded, some killed in the melee, others crushed by  the falling of the scaffolds, or trod to death by the horses. Kings,  princes, and gallant knights from every part of Europe have perished  at different times while attending or taking part in those mimic  battles. Successive popes thundered out their anathemas against all  that encouraged this warlike and dangerous amusement. Those who  perished in these sanguinary entertainments were denied the honour of  Christian burial; and yet, so strong was the passion of the nobility  of Europe for these martial sports, from a desire to display their  grandeur, courage, and address before the ladies and the assembled  multitude, that no bulls, decretals, or anathemas of the church were  able to restrain them. The use of gunpowder, and the consequent  inutility of armour to defend the person in battle, gradually put  an end to these animating shows. The tragical death of Henry II. of  France, in 1559, who was accidentally killed in a tournament, caused  laws to be passed prohibiting their being held in that kingdom. They  were continued in England till the beginning of the seventeenth  century.    An attempt was made to revive these martial exhibitions in Scotland, a  few years ago, by Lord Eglintoun, the acknowledged leader in all manly  sports, elegant athletic exercises, and baronial liberality. This  noble peer proclaimed a tournament to be held at Eglintoun Castle on  the 28th and 29th of August, 1839. The lists were duly prepared, a  covered pavilion was erected for the accommodation of the ladies,  which would contain 3000 persons. In front of this pavilion was the  throne of the Queen of Beauty and her attendants. Around the lists,  at convenient distances, were arranged the tents or pavilions of the  knights, over which floated the gonfalon, or great banner, emblazoned  with the arms and motto of the knight to whom the tent was  appropriated, penons and penoncils fluttered at each angle of the  pavilion, and the shield was placed over the entrance. The knights  vied with each other in the decoration of their pavilions; all was in  accordance with ancient customs: and if the shade of Froissart had  witnessed the scene, it could not have complained of modern innovation  or misplaced ornament. The procession of the King of the tournament,  the Queen of Beauty, with the judges, heralds, pursuivants,  halberdiers, musicians, men-at-arms, as also the splendid retinues  of the noble challenger and the gallant knights, presented a scene  unparalleled for magnificence and heraldic emblazonment since the days  of Edward IV. Every form was observed in this modern tournament; and a  more interesting scene for the historian, the antiquary, and armorist,  could not be exhibited. Unfortunately, the continued rain cast a gloom  over this animated spectacle, which nevertheless excited the highest  admiration of all who beheld it: a spectator of the scene could well  imagine the enthusiasm similar ones would create in the minds of the  gay and brave of former times. It is deemed necessary to briefly  notice the last tournament held in Britain; as any one that requires  full information on every part of heraldic ornament, processional  arrangement, and technical definition, may find positive examples in  the details of this gorgeous exhibition.    TRANSPOSED. Charges or bearings placed contrary to their usual  situation.    [Illustration: Transposed]    Ex. Argent, a pile, azure, issuing from the chief between two others,  transposed.    TREFOIL. Three-leaved grass: the shamrock of Ireland. When a flower or  leaf is introduced as a charge in a shield of arms, if it is of its  natural colour, or, in heraldic language, proper, the tincture is not  named, but if of any other colour it must be described.    [Illustration: Trefoil]    Ex. Argent, three trefoils, gules, one over two.    [Illustration: Tressure]    TRESSURE. An ordinary not so broad as an orle. It generally forms a  border to the inescutcheon. Tressures are frequently borne double,  and sometimes treble. They are generally ornamented flory and  counter-flory. The example contains only a single tressure. The  arms of Scotland exhibit an example of a double tressure flory and  counter-flory, as exhibited in the shield on the title-page of this  Manual. See DOUBLE TRESSURE.    TRICORPORATED. Three lions rampant, conjoined, under one head,  guardant, in the fess points. See LIONS.    TRIPPING. The motion of deer, between running and walking.    [Illustration: Tripping]    Ex. Argent, a stag proper, tripping.    [Illustration: Turband]    TURBAND. In coats of arms, where the knight was a Crusader, this  figure often appears. It was the form of the sultan's turban at that  period.    [Illustration: Turreted]    TURRETED. A wall or castle having small turrets. In the annexed  example the square tower has circular turrets at the angles, and is  therefore said to be turreted.    TUSKED. Any animal having tusks of a different tincture from its body  is said to be tusked.    [Illustration: Tusked]    Ex. Argent, a boar's head, erased proper, tusked gules.    UNDY. A term used to express the word wavy by Gwillim and other  ancient armorists.    [Illustration: Wavy]    Ex. Argent, a bend undy, gules.    [Illustration: Vair]    VAIR. A kind of fur formerly used for the lining the garments of  knights. It is represented in engraving by the figures of small bells  ranged in lines, as in the annexed example. Unless the colour of the  fur is named, vair is always argent and azure. The bend, the cross and  saltier, are sometimes formed of this fur.    VAMBRACED. Armour for the arms.    [Illustration: Vambraced]    Ex. Argent, three dexter arms, vambraced, couped.    VAMPLATE. A word used by ancient heralds for armour for the hand,  instead of gauntlet.    VENUS. The name of the planet, used for the colour vert by ancient  heralds, who emblazoned the arms of sovereigns by planets instead of  metals and colours.    VERDOY. A bordure charged with eight leaves.    [Illustration: Verdoy]    Ex. Vert, a bordure argent, verdoy, of trefoils.    [Illustration: Vert]    VERT. Green. It is represented in engraving by diagonal lines drawn  from the dexter to the sinister side of the shield.    VISCOUNT. A title of honour, a degree below an earl.    VOIDED. A term applied when any part of an ordinary is left open to  the field.    [Illustration: Voided]    Ex. Gules, a bend sinister, voided, argent.    VOIDER. A subordinate ordinary.    [Illustration: Voider]    Ex. Azure, a voider, argent.    [Illustration: Volant]    VOLANT. The French word for flying. It is used in Heraldry to express  the same action.    VORANT. Swallowing or devouring: any animal, in a charge, devouring  another creature.    [Illustration: Vorant]    Ex. Argent, a serpent crowned, or, vorant an infant.    VULNED. A word that signifies wounded, used in emblazonry to denote an  animal wounded by another creature.    VULNING. Any creature in the act of wounding itself.    [Illustration: Vulning]    Ex. Argent, a pelican's head, erased, vulning.    WALLED. A term sometimes used in Heraldry. When an ordinary is edged  or guarded by an embattled wall.    [Illustration: Walled]    Ex. Azure, on a pale, walled on each side with three battlements  argent, an endorse gules.    WAVY. Curved lines, undulating like the waves of the sea.    [Illustration: Wavy]    Ex. Argent, the lower half of the shield three bars wavy, azure.    WHITE. This word is only used to describe a plain fur. It is  represented as argent.    WINGED. When the wings of a bird, or those of chimerical figures which  are drawn with wings, are of a different tincture to their bodies,  they are said to be winged. Thus, in the arms of the state of Venice  there is a lion sejant guardant, winged or.    [Illustration: Wings erect]    WINGS ERECT. Wings are called erect when their long feathers point  upwards.    [Illustration: Wings inverted]    WINGS INVERTED. When the feathers point downwards.    WIVERN. A chimerical animal, the upper part resembling a dragon.    [Illustration: Wivern]    Ex. Argent, a wivern, wings raised.    [Illustration: Wreath]    WREATH. A chaplet of two different-coloured silks wound round each  other, and placed on the top of the helmet for the crest to rest upon.  In Heraldry it is usually drawn straight, as in the lower example.           *       *       *       *       *          CHAP. VIII.    HERALDRY IN CONNECTION WITH HISTORY, ARCHITECTURE, INTERIOR  DECORATION, COSTUME, AMUSEMENT, RELIGIOUS SOLEMNITIES, FUNERAL RITES,  ETC.      In the preface to this Manual, we stated that Heraldry might be  considered as the symbolic history of the nobility of Britain, from  the Conquest to the reign of Elizabeth. It would require a volume of  far greater pretensions than this to enter fully upon the heraldic  history of the peerage; but the assertion may be borne out by merely  glancing at the supporters of the shields containing the arms of the  British monarchs during that period.    Supporters were not introduced in English heraldry previous to the  reign of Richard II. The shield of this luxurious monarch is supported  on each side by an angel habited, and beneath the shield by a white  hart couchant, gorged and chained or, beneath a tree. The shield of  Henry IV., the founder of the Lancastrian dynasty, was supported on  the dexter side by a swan, on the sinister side by an antelope, both  gorged and lined or. The shield of the gallant Henry V. was supported  on the dexter side by a lion rampant guardant, crowned or; on the  sinister side by an antelope, gorged and chained. Henry VI. had two  antelopes as supporters to his achievement.

To keep them where you have  called them, you must make the subject too interesting for them to  wander again. And for that there is one prescription; but the  prescription, like all our prescriptions, is abstract, and, to get  practical results from it, you must couple it with mother-wit.    The prescription is that _the subject must be made to show new aspects  of itself; to prompt new questions; in a word, to change_. From an  unchanging subject the attention inevitably wanders away. You can test  this by the simplest possible case of sensorial attention. Try to  attend steadfastly to a dot on the paper or on the wall. You presently  find that one or the other of two things has happened: either your field  of vision has become blurred, so that you now see nothing distinct at  all, or else you have involuntarily ceased to look at the dot in  question, and are looking at something else. But, if you ask yourself  successive questions about the dot,--how big it is, how far, of what  shape, what shade of color, etc.; in other words, if you turn it over,  if you think of it in various ways, and along with various kinds of  associates,--you can keep your mind on it for a comparatively long time.  This is what the genius does, in whose hands a given topic coruscates  and grows. And this is what the teacher must do for every topic if he  wishes to avoid too frequent appeals to voluntary attention of the  coerced sort. In all respects, reliance upon such attention as this is a  wasteful method, bringing bad temper and nervous wear and tear as well  as imperfect results. The teacher who can get along by keeping  spontaneous interest excited must be regarded as the teacher with the  greatest skill.    There is, however, in all schoolroom work a large mass of material that  must be dull and unexciting, and to which it is impossible in any  continuous way to contribute an interest associatively derived. There  are, therefore, certain external methods, which every teacher knows, of  voluntarily arousing the attention from time to time and keeping it upon  the subject. Mr. Fitch has a lecture on the art of securing attention,  and he briefly passes these methods in review; the posture must be  changed; places can be changed. Questions, after being answered singly,  may occasionally be answered in concert. Elliptical questions may be  asked, the pupil supplying the missing word. The teacher must pounce  upon the most listless child and wake him up. The habit of prompt and  ready response must be kept up. Recapitulations, illustrations,  examples, novelty of order, and ruptures of routine,--all these are  means for keeping the attention alive and contributing a little interest  to a dull subject. Above all, the teacher must himself be alive and  ready, and must use the contagion of his own example.    But, when all is said and done, the fact remains that some teachers have  a naturally inspiring presence, and can make their exercises  interesting, while others simply cannot. And psychology and general  pedagogy here confess their failure, and hand things over to the deeper  springs of human personality to conduct the task.           *       *       *       *       *    A brief reference to the physiological theory of the attentive process  may serve still further to elucidate these practical remarks, and  confirm them by showing them from a slightly different point of view.    What is the attentive process, psychologically considered? Attention to  an object is what takes place whenever that object most completely  occupies the mind. For simplicity's sake suppose the object be an object  of sensation,--a figure approaching us at a distance on the road. It is  far off, barely perceptible, and hardly moving: we do not know with  certainty whether it is a man or not. Such an object as this, if  carelessly looked at, may hardly catch our attention at all. The optical  impression may affect solely the marginal consciousness, while the  mental focus keeps engaged with rival things. We may indeed not 'see' it  till some one points it out. But, if so, how does he point it out? By  his finger, and by describing its appearance,--by creating a premonitory  image of _where_ to look and of _what_ to expect to see. This  premonitory image is already an excitement of the same nerve-centres  that are to be concerned with the impression. The impression comes, and  excites them still further; and now the object enters the focus of the  field, consciousness being sustained both by impression and by  preliminary idea. But the maximum of attention to it is not yet reached.  Although we see it, we may not care for it; it may suggest nothing  important to us; and a rival stream of objects or of thoughts may  quickly take our mind away. If, however, our companion defines it in a  significant way, arouses in the mind a set of experiences to be  apprehended from it,--names it an enemy or as a messenger of important  tidings,--the residual and marginal ideas now aroused, so far from being  its rivals, become its associates and allies. They shoot together into  one system with it; they converge upon it; they keep it steadily in  focus; the mind attends to it with maximum power.    The attentive process, therefore, at its maximum may be physiologically  symbolized by a brain-cell played on in two ways, from without and from  within. Incoming currents from the periphery arouse it, and collateral  currents from the centres of memory and imagination re-enforce these.    In this process the incoming impression is the newer element; the ideas  which re-enforce and sustain it are among the older possessions of the  mind. And the maximum of attention may then be said to be found whenever  we have a systematic harmony or unification between the novel and the  old. It is an odd circumstance that neither the old nor the new, by  itself, is interesting: the absolutely old is insipid; the absolutely  new makes no appeal at all. The old _in_ the new is what claims the  attention,--the old with a slightly new turn. No one wants to hear a  lecture on a subject completely disconnected with his previous  knowledge, but we all like lectures on subjects of which we know a  little already, just as, in the fashions, every year must bring its  slight modification of last year's suit, but an abrupt jump from the  fashion of one decade into another would be distasteful to the eye.    The genius of the interesting teacher consists in sympathetic divination  of the sort of material with which the pupil's mind is likely to be  already spontaneously engaged, and in the ingenuity which discovers  paths of connection from that material to the matters to be newly  learned. The principle is easy to grasp, but the accomplishment is  difficult in the extreme. And a knowledge of such psychology as this  which I am recalling can no more make a good teacher than a knowledge of  the laws of perspective can make a landscape painter of effective skill.    A certain doubt may now occur to some of you. A while ago, apropos of  the pugnacious instinct, I spoke of our modern pedagogy as being  possibly too 'soft.' You may perhaps here face me with my own words, and  ask whether the exclusive effort on the teacher's part to keep the  pupil's spontaneous interest going, and to avoid the more strenuous path  of voluntary attention to repulsive work, does not savor also of  sentimentalism. The greater part of schoolroom work, you say, must, in  the nature of things, always be repulsive. To face uninteresting  drudgery is a good part of life's work. Why seek to eliminate it from  the schoolroom or minimize the sterner law?    A word or two will obviate what might perhaps become a serious  misunderstanding here.    It is certain that most schoolroom work, till it has become habitual and  automatic, is repulsive, and cannot be done without voluntarily jerking  back the attention to it every now and then. This is inevitable, let the  teacher do what he will.    It flows from the inherent nature of the subjects and of the learning  mind. The repulsive processes of verbal memorizing, of discovering steps  of mathematical identity, and the like, must borrow their interest at  first from purely external sources, mainly from the personal interests  with which success in mastering them is associated, such as gaining of  rank, avoiding punishment, not being beaten by a difficulty and the  like. Without such borrowed interest, the child could not attend to them  at all. But in these processes what becomes interesting enough to be  attended to is not thereby attended to _without effort_. Effort always  has to go on, derived interest, for the most part, not awakening  attention that is _easy_, however spontaneous it may now have to be  called. The interest which the teacher, by his utmost skill, can lend to  the subject, proves over and over again to be only an interest  sufficient _to let loose the effort_. The teacher, therefore, need never  concern himself about _inventing_ occasions where effort must be called  into play. Let him still awaken whatever sources of interest in the  subject he can by stirring up connections between it and the pupil's  nature, whether in the line of theoretic curiosity, of personal  interest, or of pugnacious impulse. The laws of mind will then bring  enough pulses of effort into play to keep the pupil exercised in the  direction of the subject. There is, in fact, no greater school of effort  than the steady struggle to attend to immediately repulsive or difficult  objects of thought which have grown to interest us through their  association as means, with some remote ideal end.    The Herbartian doctrine of interest ought not, therefore, in principle  to be reproached with making pedagogy soft. If"]]]
