[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17221"],[0,"History of the Plague in London (#14)"],[1," turning up the street towards my own house, I saw another cart, with  links, and a bellman going before, coming out of Harrow Alley, in the  Butcher Row, on the other side of the way; and being, as I perceived,  very full of dead bodies, it went directly over the street, also,  towards the church. I stood a while, but I had no stomach[119] to go  back again to see the same dismal scene over again: so I went directly  home, where I could not but consider with thankfulness the risk I had  run, believing I had gotten no injury, as indeed I had not.    Here the poor unhappy gentleman's grief came into my head again, and  indeed I could not but shed tears in the reflection upon it, perhaps  more than he did himself; but his case lay so heavy upon my mind, that I  could not prevail with myself but that I must go out again into the  street, and go to the Pye Tavern, resolving to inquire what became of  him.    It was by this time one o'clock in the morning, and yet the poor  gentleman was there. The truth was, the people of the house, knowing  him, had entertained him, and kept him there all the night,  notwithstanding the danger of being infected by him, though it appeared  the man was perfectly sound himself.    It is with regret that I take notice of this tavern. The people were  civil, mannerly, and an obliging sort of folks enough, and had till this  time kept their house open, and their trade going on, though not so very  publicly as formerly. But there was a dreadful set of fellows that used  their house, and who, in the middle of all this horror, met there every  night, behaving with all the reveling and roaring extravagances as is  usual for such people to do at other times, and indeed to such an  offensive degree that the very master and mistress of the house grew  first ashamed, and then terrified, at them.    They sat generally in a room next the street; and as they always kept  late hours, so when the dead cart came across the street end to go into  Houndsditch, which was in view of the tavern windows, they would  frequently open the windows as soon as they heard the bell, and look out  at them; and as they might often hear sad lamentations of people in the  streets, or at their windows, as the carts went along, they would make  their impudent mocks and jeers at them, especially if they heard the  poor people call upon God to have mercy upon them, as many would do at  those times, in their ordinary passing along the streets.    These gentlemen, being something disturbed with the clutter of bringing  the poor gentleman into the house, as above, were first angry and very  high with the master of the house for suffering such a fellow, as they  called him, to be brought out of the grave into their house; but being  answered that the man was a neighbor, and that he was sound, but  overwhelmed with the calamity of his family, and the like, they turned  their anger into ridiculing the man and his sorrow for his wife and  children, taunting him with want of courage to leap into the great pit,  and go to heaven, as they jeeringly expressed it, along with them;  adding some very profane and even blasphemous expressions.    They were at this vile work when I came back to the house; and as far as  I could see, though the man sat still, mute and disconsolate, and their  affronts could not divert his sorrow, yet he was both grieved and  offended at their discourse. Upon this, I gently reproved them, being  well enough acquainted with their characters, and not unknown in person  to two of them.    They immediately fell upon me with ill language and oaths, asked me  what I did out of my grave at such a time, when so many honester men  were carried into the churchyard, and why I was not at home saying my  prayers, against[120] the dead cart came for me, and the like.    I was indeed astonished at the impudence of the men, though not at all  discomposed at their treatment of me: however, I kept my temper. I told  them that though I defied them, or any man in the world, to tax me with  any dishonesty, yet I acknowledged, that, in this terrible judgment of  God, many better than I were swept away, and carried to their grave;  but, to answer their question directly, the case was, that I was  mercifully preserved by that great God whose name they had blasphemed  and taken in vain by cursing and swearing in a dreadful manner; and that  I believed I was preserved in particular, among other ends of his  goodness, that I might reprove them for their audacious boldness in  behaving in such a manner, and in such an awful time as this was,  especially for their jeering and mocking at an honest gentleman and a  neighbor, for some of them knew him, who they saw was overwhelmed with  sorrow for the breaches which it had pleased God to make upon his  family.    I cannot call exactly to mind the hellish, abominable raillery which was  the return they made to that talk of mine, being provoked, it seems,  that I was not at all afraid to be free with them; nor, if I could  remember, would I fill my account with any of the words, the horrid  oaths, curses, and vile expressions such as, at that time of the day,  even the worst and ordinariest people in the street would not use: for,  except such hardened creatures as these, the most wicked wretches that  could be found had at that time some terror upon their mind of the hand  of that Power which could thus in a moment destroy them.    But that which was the worst in all their devilish language was, that  they were not afraid to blaspheme God and talk atheistically, making a  jest at my calling the plague the hand of God, mocking, and even  laughing at the word \"judgment,\" as if the providence of God had no  concern in the inflicting such a desolating stroke; and that the people  calling upon God, as they saw the carts carrying away the dead bodies,  was all enthusiastic, absurd, and impertinent.    I made them some reply, such as I thought proper, but which I found was  so far from putting a check to their horrid way of speaking, that it  made them rail the more: so that I confess it filled me with horror and  a kind of rage; and I came away, as I told them, lest the hand of that  Judgment which had visited the whole city should glorify his vengeance  upon them and all that were near them.    They received all reproof with the utmost contempt, and made the  greatest mockery that was possible for them to do at me, giving me all  the opprobrious insolent scoffs that they could think of for preaching  to them, as they called it, which, indeed, grieved me rather than  angered me; and I went away, blessing God, however, in my mind, that I  had not spared them, though they had insulted me so much.    They continued this wretched course three or four days after this,  continually mocking and jeering at all that showed themselves religious  or serious, or that were any way touched with the sense of the terrible  judgment of God upon us; and I was informed they flouted in the same  manner at the good people, who, notwithstanding the contagion, met at  the church, fasted, and prayed to God to remove his hand from them.    I say they continued this dreadful course three or four days (I think it  was no more), when one of them, particularly he who asked the poor  gentleman what he did out of his grave, was struck from Heaven with the  plague, and died in a most deplorable manner; and, in a word, they were  every one of them carried into the great pit, which I have mentioned  above, before it was quite filled up, which was not above a fortnight or  thereabout.    These men were guilty of many extravagances, such as one would think  human nature should have trembled at the thoughts of, at such a time of  general terror as was then upon us, and particularly scoffing and  mocking at everything which they happened to see that was religious  among the people, especially at their thronging zealously to the place  of public worship, to implore mercy from Heaven in such a time of  distress; and this tavern where they held their club, being within view  of the church door, they had the more particular occasion for their  atheistical, profane mirth.    But this began to abate a little with them before the accident, which I  have related, happened; for the infection increased so violently at this  part of the town now, that people began to be afraid to come to the  church: at least such numbers did not resort thither as was usual. Many  of the clergymen, likewise, were dead, and others gone into the country;  for it really required a steady courage and a strong faith, for a man  not only to venture being in town at such a time as this, but likewise  to venture to come to church, and perform the office of a minister to a  congregation of whom he had reason to believe many of them were actually  infected with the plague, and to do this every day, or twice a day, as  in some places was done.    It seems they had been checked, for their open insulting religion in  this manner, by several good people of every persuasion; and that[121]  and the violent raging of the infection, I suppose, was the occasion  that they had abated much of their rudeness for some time before, and  were only roused by the spirit of ribaldry and atheism at the clamor  which was made when the gentleman was first brought in there, and  perhaps were agitated by the same devil when I took upon me to reprove  them; though I did it at first with all the calmness, temper, and good  manners that I could, which, for a while, they insulted me the more for,  thinking it had been in fear of their resentment, though afterwards they  found the contrary.[122]    These things lay upon my mind, and I went home very much grieved and  oppressed with the horror of these men's wickedness, and to think that  anything could be so vile, so hardened, and so notoriously wicked, as to  insult God, and his servants and his worship, in such a manner, and at  such a time"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1723"],[0,"Cow-Country (#14)"],[1,"and his skill and the  unquestionable righteousness of his cause. Instead he had three bruised  knuckles and a rapidly swelling ear, and when his anger had cooled a  little he felt rather foolish and wondered what had started them off  that way. They had ridden away from the ranch in a very good humor, and  he had harbored no conscious dislike of Dirk Tracy, who had been one  individual of a type of rangemen which he had known all his life and had  accepted as a matter of course.    Dirk, on his part, had some trouble in stopping the bleeding of his  nose, and by the time he reached the ranch his left eye was closed  completely. He was taller and heavier than Bud, and he had not expected  such a slugging strength behind Bud's blows.    He was badly shaken, and when Bud recovered the two guns and the knife  and returned his weapons to him, Dirk was half tempted to shoot. But he  did not--perhaps because Bud had unwrapped his own six-shooter and  was looking it over with the muzzle slanting a wicked eye in Dirk's  direction.    Late that afternoon, when the boys were loafing around the cabin waiting  for their early supper, Bud packed his worldly goods on Sunfish and  departed from the Muleshoe--\"by special request\", he admitted to  himself ruefully--with his wages in gold and silver in his pocket and no  definite idea of what he would do next.    He wished he knew exactly why Bart had fired him. He did not believe  that it was for fighting, as Bart had declared. He thought that perhaps  Dirk Tracy had some hold on the Muleshoe not apparent to the outsider,  and that he had lied about him to Bart as a sneaking kind of revenge  for being whipped. But that explanation did not altogether satisfy him,  either.    In his month at the Muleshoe he had gained a very fair general idea of  the extent and resources of Burroback Valley, but he had not made any  acquaintances and he did not know just where to go for his next job. So  for want of something better, he rode down to the little stream which he  now knew was called One Creek, and prepared to spend the night there.  In the morning he would make a fresh start--and because of the streak of  stubbornness he had, he meant to make it in Burroback Valley, under the  very nose of the Muleshoe outfit.        CHAPTER NINE: LITTLE LOST    Little Lost--somehow the name appealed to Bud, whose instinct for  harmony extended to words and phrases and, for that matter, to  everything in the world that was beautiful. From the time when he first  heard Little Lost mentioned, he had felt a vague regret that chance had  not led him there instead of to the Muleshoe. Brands he had heard all  his life as the familiar, colloquial names for ranch headquarters. The  Muleshoe was merely a brand name. Little Lost was something else,  and because Buddy had been taught to \"wait and find out\" and to ask  questions only as a last resort, Bud was still in ignorance of the  meaning of Little Lost. He knew, from careless remarks made in his  presence, that the mail came to Little Lost, and that there was some  sort of store where certain everyday necessities were kept, for which  the store-keeper charged \"two prices.\" But there was also a ranch, for  he sometimes heard the boys mention the Little Lost cattle, and speak of  some man as a rider for the Little Lost.    So to Little Lost Bud rode blithely next morning, riding Stopper and  leading Smoky, Sunfish and the pack following as a matter of course.  Again his trained instinct served him faithfully. He had a very good  general idea of Burroback Valley, he knew that the Muleshoe occupied a  fair part of the south side, and guessed that he must ride north, toward  the Gold Gap Mountains, to find the place he wanted.    The trail was easy, his horses were as fat as was good for them. In  two hours of riding at his usual trail pace he came upon another stream  which he knew must be Sunk Creek grown a little wider and deeper in its  journey down the valley. He forded that with a great splashing, climbed  the farther bank, followed a stubby, rocky bit of road that wound  through dense willow and cottonwood growth, came out into a humpy meadow  full of ant hills, gopher holes and soggy wet places where the water  grass grew, crossed that and followed the road around a brushy ridge and  found himself squarely confronting Little Lost.    There could be no mistake, for \"Little Lost Post Office\" was unevenly  painted on the high cross-bar of the gate that stood wide open and  permanently warped with long sagging. There was a hitch-rail outside the  gate, and Bud took the hint and left his horses there. From the wisps  of fresh hay strewn along the road, Bud knew that haying had begun at  Little Lost. There were at least four cabins and a somewhat pretentious,  story-and-a-half log house with vines reaching vainly to the high window  sills, and coarse lace curtains. One of these curtains moved slightly,  and Bud's sharp eyes detected the movement and knew that his arrival was  observed in spite of the emptiness of the yard.    The beaten path led to a screen door which sagged with much slamming,  leaving a wide space at the top through which flies passed in and out  quite comfortably. Bud saw that, also, and his fingers itched to reset  that door, just as he would have done for his mother--supposing his  mother would have tolerated the slamming which had brought the need. Bud  lifted his gloved knuckles to knock, saw that the room within was  grimy and bare and meant for public use, very much like the office of a  country hotel, with a counter and a set of pigeon-holes at the farther  end. He walked in.    No one appeared, and after ten minutes or so Bud guessed why, and went  back to the door, pushed it wide open and permitted it to fly shut with  a bang. Whereupon a girl opened the door behind the counter and came in,  glancing at Bud with frank curiosity.    Bud took off his hat and clanked over to the counter and asked if there  was any mail for Bud Birnie--Robert Wallace Birnie.    The girl looked at him again and smiled, and turned to shuffle a handful  of letters. Bud employed the time in trying to guess just what she meant  by that smile.    It was not really a smile, he decided, but the beginning of one. And if  that were the beginning, he would very much like to know what the whole  smile would mean. The beginning hinted at things. It was as if she  doubted the reality of the name he gave, and meant to conceal her doubt,  or had heard something amusing about him, or wished to be friends with  him, or was secretly timorous and trying to appear merely indifferent.  Or perhaps----    She replaced the letters and turned, and rested her hands on the  counter. She looked at him and again her lips turned at the corners in  that faint, enigmatical beginning of a smile.    \"There isn't a thing,\" she said. \"The mail comes this noon again. Do you  want yours sent out to any of the outfits? Or shall I just hold it?\"    \"Just hold it, when there is any. At least, until I see whether I land a  job here. I wonder where I could find the boss?\" Bud was glancing often  at her hands. For a ranch girl her hands were soft and white, but her  fingers were a bit too stubby and her nails were too round and flat.    \"Uncle Dave will be home at noon. He's out in the meadow with the boys.  You might sit down and wait.\"    Bud looked at his watch. Sitting down and waiting for four hours did not  appeal to him, even supposing the girl would keep him company. But he  lingered awhile, leaning with his elbows on the counter near her; and by  those obscure little conversational trails known to youth, he progressed  considerably in his acquaintance with the girl and made her smile often  without once feeling quite certain that he knew what was in her mind.    He discovered that her name was Honora Krause, and that she was called  Honey \"for short.\" Her father had been Dutch and her mother a Yankee,  and she lived with her uncle, Dave Truman, who owned Little Lost ranch,  and took care of the mail for him, and attended to the store--which  was nothing more than a supply depot kept for the accommodation of the  neighbors. The store, she said, was in the next room.    Bud asked her what Little Lost meant, and she replied that she did not  know, but that it might have something to do with Sunk Creek losing  itself in The Sinks. There was a Little Lost river, farther across the  mountains, she said, but it did not run through Little Lost ranch, nor  come anywhere near it.    After that she questioned him adroitly. Perversely Bud declined to  become confidential, and Honey Krause changed the subject abruptly.    \"There's going to be a dance here next Friday night. It'll be a good  chance to get acquainted with everybody--if you go. There'll be good  music, I guess. Uncle Dave wrote to Crater for the Saunders boys to come  down and play. Do you know anybody in Crater?\"    The question was innocent enough, but perverseness still held Bud. He  smiled and said he did not know anybody anywhere, any more. He said that  if Bobbie Burns had asked him \"Should auld acquaintance be forgot,\" he'd  have told him yes, and he'd have made it good and strong. But he added  that he was just as willing to make new acquaintance, and thought the  dance would be a good place to begin.    Honey gave him a provocative glance from under her lashes, and Bud  straightened and stepped back.    \"You let folks stop here, I take it. I've a pack outfit and a couple of  saddle horses with me. Will it be all right to turn them in the corral?  I hate to have them eat post hay all day. Or I could perhaps go back to  the creek and camp.\"    \"Oh, just turn your horses in the corral and make yourself at home till  uncle comes,\" she told him with that tantalizing half-smile. \"We keep  people here--just for accommodation. There has to be some place in the  valley where folks can stop. I can't promise that uncle will give"]]]
