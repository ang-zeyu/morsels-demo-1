Hark to the words of      \"One-who-does-things-well.\"        \"I carry a message from my people to the Government at Washington,\"      says Princess Galilolie, youngest daughter of John Ross, hereditary      King of the \"Forest Indians,\" the Cherokees of Oklahoma. \"We have      been a nation without hope. The land that was promised us by solemn      treaty, 'so long as the grass should grow and the waters run,' has      been taken from us. It was barren and wild when we received it      seventy years ago. Now it is rich with oil and cultivation, and the      whites coveted our possessions. Since it was thrown open to settlers      no Cherokee holds sovereign rights as before, when it was his      nation. We are outnumbered. I have come as a voice from my people to      speak to the people of the Eastern States and to those at      Washington--most of all, if I am permitted to do so, to lay our      wrongs before the President's wife, in whose veins glows the blood      of the Indian.\"        Only nineteen is this Indian princess--this twentieth century      Pocahontas--who travels far to the seats of the mighty for her race.        She is a tall, slim, stately girl from the foothills of the Ozarks,      from Tahlequah, former capital of the Cherokee Nation. She says she      is proud of every drop of Indian blood that flows in her veins. But      her skin is fair as old ivory and she is a college girl--a girl of      the times to her finger-tips.        \"When an Indian goes through college and returns to his or her      people,\" she says with a smile, \"they say, 'Back to the blanket!' We      have few blankets among the Cherokees in Tahlequah. I am the      youngest of nine children, and we are all of us college graduates,      as my father was before us.\"        He is John Ross 3d, Chief of the Cherokee Nation, of mingled Scotch      and Indian blood, in descent from \"Cooweeskowee,\" John Ross I., the      rugged old Indian King who held out against Andrew Jackson back in      1838 for the ancient rights of the Five Nations to their lands along      the Southern Atlantic States.        She sat back on the broad window seat in the sunlight. Beyond the      window lay a bird's-eye view of New York housetops, the white man's      permanent tepee. Some spring birds alighted on a nearby telephone      wire, sending out twittering mating cries to each other.        \"They make me want to go home,\" she said with a swift, expressive      gesture. \"But I will stay until the answer comes to us. Do you know      what they have called me, the old men and women who are wise--the      full-bloods? Galilolie--'One-who-does-things-well.' With us, when a      name is given it is one with a meaning, something the child must      grow to in fulfillment. So I feel I must not fail them now.\"        \"You see,\" she went on, lifting her chin, \"it is we young      half-bloods who must carry the strength and honor of our people to      the world so it may understand us. All our lives we have been told      tales by the old men--how our people were driven from their homes by      the Government, how Gen. Winfield Scott's soldiers came down into      our quiet villages and ordered the Indians to go forth leaving      everything behind them. My great-grandfather, the old King      Cooweeskowee, with his wife and children, paused at the first      hilltop to look back at his home, and already the whites were moving      into it. The house is still standing at Rossville, Ga. Do you know      what the old people tell us children when we wish we could go back      there?\" Her eyes are half closed, her lips compressed as she says      slowly, thrillingly: \"They tell us it is easy to find the way over      that 'Trail of Tears,' that through the wilderness it is blazed with      the gravestones of those who were too weak to march.        \"That was seventy years ago, in 1838. The Government promised to pay      amply for all it took from us, our homes and lands, cattle--even      furniture. A treaty was made solemnly between the Indians and the      United States that Oklahoma should be theirs 'as long as the grass      should grow and the waters run.'        \"That meant perpetuity to us, don't you see?\" She makes her points      with a directness and simplicity that should disarm even the      diplomatic suavity of Uncle Sam when he meets her in Washington.      \"Year after year the Cherokees waited for the Government to pay. And      at last, three years ago, it came to us--$133.19 to each Indian,      seventy-eight years after the removal from Georgia had taken place.        \"Oil was discovered after the Indians had taken the wilderness lands      in Oklahoma and reclaimed them. It was as if God, in reparation for      the wrongs inflicted by whites, had given us the riches of the      earth. My people grew rich from their wells, but a way was found to      bind their wealth so they could not use it. It was said the Indians      were not fit to handle their own money.\"        She lifts eyebrows and shoulders, her hands clasped before her      tightly, as if in silent resentment of their impotence to help.        \"These are the things I want to tell; first our wrongs and then our      colonization plan, for which we hope so much if the Government will      grant it. We are outnumbered since the land was opened up and a mass      of 'sooners,' as we call them--squatters, claimers,      settlers--swarmed in over our borders. The Government again offered      to pay us for the land they took back--the land that was to be ours      in perpetuity 'while the grass grew and the waters ran.' We were      told to file our claims with the whites. Some of us did, but eight      hundred of the full-bloods went back forty miles into the foothills      under the leadership of Red Bird Smith. They refuse to sell or to      accept the Government money for their valuable oil lands. To appease      justice, the Government allotted them lands anyway, in their      absence, and paid the money for their old property into the banks,      where it lies untouched. Red Bird and his 'Night Hawks' refuse to      barter over a broken treaty.        \"Ah, but I have gone up alone to the old men there.\" Her voice      softens. \"They will talk to me because I am my father's daughter. My      Indian name means 'One-who-does-things-well.' So if I go to them      they tell me their heart longings, what they ask for the Cherokee.        \"And I shall put the message, if I can, before our President's wife.      Perhaps she will help.\"    THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ARTICLE. A writer's own experiences, given under  his name, under a pseudonym, or in anonymous form, can easily be made  interesting to others. Told in the first person, such stories are  realistic and convincing. The pronoun \"I\" liberally sprinkled through  the story, as it must be, gives to it a personal, intimate character  that most readers like. Conversation and description of persons, places,  and objects may be included to advantage in these personal narratives.    The possibilities of the personal experience story are as great as are  those of the interview. Besides serving as a vehicle for the writer's  own experiences, it may be employed to give experiences of others. If,  for example, a person interviewed objects to having his name used, it is  possible to present the material obtained by the interview in the form  of a personal experience story. In that case the article would have to  be published without the writer's name, since the personal experiences  that it records are not his own. Permission to present material in a  personal experience story should always be obtained from the individual  whose experiences the writer intends to use.    Articles designed to give practical guidance, to show readers how to do  something, are particularly effective when written in the first person.  If these \"how-to-do-something\" articles are to be most useful to  readers, the conditions under which the personal experience was  obtained must be fairly typical. Personal experience articles of this  type are very popular in women's magazines, agricultural journals, and  publications that appeal to business men.      EXAMPLES OF THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE STORY. The opportunities for  service offered to women by small daily newspapers are set forth in the  story below, by means of the personal experiences of one woman. The  article was published in the _Woman's Home Companion_, and was  illustrated by a half-tone reproduction of a wash drawing of a young  woman seated at her desk in a newspaper office.        \"THEY CALL ME THE 'HEN EDITOR'\"        THE STORY OF A SMALL-TOWN NEWSPAPER WOMAN        By SADIE L. MOSSLER        \"What do you stay buried in this burg for? Why, look how you drudge!      and what do you get out of it? New York or some other big city is      the place for you. There's where you can become famous instead of      being a newspaper woman in a one-horse town.\"        A big city newspaper man was talking. He was in our town on an      assignment, and he was idling away spare time in our office. Before      I could answer, the door opened and a small girl came to my desk.        \"Say,\" she said, \"Mama told me to come in here and thank you for      that piece you put in the paper about us. You ought to see the      eatin's folks has brought us! Heaps an' heaps! And Ma's got a job      scrubbin' three stores.\"        The story to which she referred was one that I had written about a      family left fatherless, a mother and three small children in real      poverty. I had written a plain appeal to the home people, with the      usual results.        \"That,\" I said, \"is one reason that I am staying here. Maybe it      isn't fame in big letters signed to an article, but it's another      kind.\"        His"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15721"],[0,"The Hawk of Egypt (#14)"],[1," he mechanically repeated the unintelligible  sentence which had been drummed into him by his master; and Damaris  smiled and replied in the servant's tongue, to his amazement, and  walked up close to el-Sooltan, holding out a flat palm with sugar upon  it.    It took some time before he snuffled her hand, and then only by  stratagem she mounted, swinging herself in a bound to the saddle as the  groom slipped to the ground on the off-side; upon which el-Sooltan  wheeled sharply and headed straight for the village of Khankah, which  is the outskirt proper of the desert.    For two and a half miles, at a tearing gallop, the girl made no attempt  to show any authority.  But once on the very edge of the desert she  did, for this was the longed-for moment of her life, when alone, free,  she should ride out into the unknown; and she had no inclination or  intention of being hurled through that moment like a stone from a  catapult.  Sooltan, behaving like a very demon, tried his best to  unseat the light weight upon his back by the simple and usually so  effective methods of rearing, plunging and bucking; but Damaris only  smiled and shouted as she looked towards the east, caring not a jot for  any vagary, so content was she.    But as the sun leapt clear of the horizon, she gave one cry, touched  the stallion lightly upon the neck, gave him his head, and was across  the desert, unmindful of an Arab who, some distance away, which, in the  desert, is really no optical distance at all, headed a grey mare,  thoroughbred and of mighty endurance, in the same direction.    Where is there anything to compare to riding across the desert at dawn?  At dawn, when to your right and to your left march phalanxes of ghostly  shapes, which maybe are the shadows of the night, or maybe, as says the  legend, the ghosts of the many long-dead kingdoms buried in oblivion  and the relentless sands; when the whistling of the wind is as the  shouting of men and the thunder of your horse's hoofs as the rolling of  many drums, calling you through the power of past centuries and the  ecstasy of the solitude in your heart, out to the mystery of the plains.    Mystery, fascination, spell, lure, call of the desert.  All fine words,  but hopeless to explain that which has lured more than one white woman  out into the golden wilderness to the wrecking of her soul; and which  has nothing whatever to do with the pseudo-psychic waves which trick us  into such pitiable hysteria and hallucination.    But there is no mystery about that which called Damaris.  It was the  joy of youth, the salt of novelty, the exhilarating sympathy between  horse and rider; she shouted as she seemingly rode straight into the  massed colouring of the sunrise; she lifted her face to the golden  banners flung across the sky and turned in the saddle and looked back  at the hem of Night's garments disappearing down in the west.    She was still a child, for those auxiliaries, Love and Life, had not  yet lain hand upon her; they had but pulled aside the veil from before  her eyes for one brief second, and she, dazzled by the glimpse, had  pulled it back hastily.  Neither was there anything to tell her that,  upon a not very far distant day, the veil would be torn from her,  leaving her to be well-nigh blinded by the radiance of the greatest  light in the world.    And she rode carelessly, without a thought to the passing of time or to  the ever-increasing speed of el-Sooltan, who was all out in an  endeavour to find his stable, also his companions, from whom he had  been parted for many weary weeks.    That they happened to be in the Oasis of Khargegh, some few hundred  miles down the Nile, he was not to know; he only knew that the desert  was his home and that in it and of it was his happiness to be found;  and it was only when Damaris turned to look at the ruins of the City of  On from a far distance that she discovered that they had disappeared in  a mist which was merely the combination of the distance and the waters  of the oasis evaporating in the morning sun.    She tried to pull the stallion, gently at first, and then with all her  might, but to no purpose; for nothing but the voice of his master or  his own particular _sayis_ could stop el-Sooltan once he had got the  light bit between his teeth; and of the death from thirst which awaited  him and his rider upon this particular venture if he continued in his  obstinacy he had, of course, no warning.    \"What a nuisance,\" said Damaris, as she looked round the great yellow  plain which stretched, a carpet of level sand, to the west and under  her horse's feet and broke to the east into a chain of hummocks, piled  by the last sandstorm which had caused such devastation in the nomad  tribes and such annoyance to the visitors at Heliopolis.    She felt no fear, only an increasing vacuum beneath her waistbelt and  distress for the worry her long absence might cause her godmother.    \"And Well-Well will have chewed everything chewable in the car, also  the legs of the _sayis_, by the time I get back,\" she exclaimed.  \"And  I can't do anything--I've irrevocably given el-Sooltan his head.  It's  no use slipping from the saddle, because I couldn't walk back.  I can't  . . .\"    She broke off suddenly, rose in the stirrups and waved.  And a more  radiant picture of youth you could not have wished to see in a lifetime.    \"A village!\" she shouted.  \"Camels, palms, water.  An oasis with tents;  women and children and men.  Come round, Sooltan, come round.\"  And she  pulled with all her strength, and still to no avail, for, oblivious of  the peaceful, verdant patch, the mighty animal forged ahead.    \"Well, I shall have to drop from the saddle, let Sooltan go, and walk  over to them.  They are sure to be friendly and . . .\"    She had just slipped her foot from the stirrup when, clear and  insistent, there came a ringing cry.    Some way off, the Hawk of Egypt had followed her from the village of  Khankah, with intent, knowing the horse she rode, to watch over but not  intrude his presence upon her.  He had known for some time that  el-Sooltan was out of hand, and had decided to call him after a mile or  so more of furious exercise; but, instead, quite suddenly and  instinctively, he cried, \"_A'ti balak!--a'ti balak_!\" which means, \"Be  careful--be careful,\" and pulled the mare to a standstill.    He too had seen the mirage of the peaceful oasis, thrown by the  atmosphere from a distance of eighty miles, and with his desert-trained  eyes had caught the little movement of the foot; and, connecting the  two, he insistently called the stallion, knowing that a drop from the  saddle at the almost incredible speed at which Sooltan was going might  easily result in twisted ankles or even a broken neck.    \"_Irja_!\" he called.  \"_Irja_!\"  Which means, \"Come back, come back!\"  And he called again and again as the stallion dropped from a gallop to  a canter, a canter to a trot, then stopped dead; whinnied gently;  wheeled sharply and stood stock-still.    \"_Irja, Sooltan_!\" came the cry.  \"_Irja Sooltan_!\" And with the cry  came the neighing of the mare.    The stallion lashed out, reared and stood still, ears pricked, silken  mane and tail flying in the wind.    Then _he_ answered, until the desert seemed filled with the calling of  the noble beasts, as the girl sat with thudding heart and eyes fixed on  the distant spot where fretted and fidgeted the mare ridden by the Arab.    Then something within her rebelled at this intrusion upon her privacy,  causing her to be suddenly stricken with anger and confusion.    \"Take me to the tents, Sooltan!\" she cried, turning to look back.  \"Take--but--why--oh! what an escape--a mirage--a----\"    But the rest was lost in the sudden bound of el-Sooltan as he raced in  obedience to his master's call.    The man waited until they were within a mile of him; then he wheeled  the mare and took her back along her tracks, urging her to her topmost  speed.  Swiftly she fled and swiftly pursued Sooltan, the man not once  turning in his seat.    And as they neared the outskirts of the oasis of Heliopolis Hugh Carden  Ali urged the mare so that she gained upon the stallion, and beckoned  to his groom, who had run hot-foot from the Obelisk to the edge of the  desert with fear in his heart for the beast but not one whit for the  girl.  And he caught the shouted order as his master passed him at full  speed, and ran out, shouting in his turn to the stallion.    El-Sooltan, connecting the _sayis_ with the bucketsful of water he  stood so badly in need of, stopped short, nearly unseating Damaris with  the suddenness of his decision and then with the hand of the groom upon  his heaving flank trotted docilely back to the Obelisk, where  Wellington, risking curvature of the spine, turned himself into a  canine picture of ecstatic welcome.    \"To-morrow at the same hour,\" said Damaris, feeding the stallion with  sugar, \"he will know me better.\"    \"_Ma sha-Allah_!\" murmured the servant to himself, praising the courage  of this bit of a woman.    \"_Bikhatirkum_,\" she said gently, as she moved off in the car.    \"_Ma'a-s-salamah ya sitti_,\" answered the delighted, astounded man as  he salaamed almost to the ground before such unexpected graciousness.
