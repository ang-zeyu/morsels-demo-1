They are so insignificant as  hardly even to suggest a vertical division. At Beverley they cease a  little way above the capitals of the main piers, and are still very  slender. At Exeter they are much more prominent, and terminate in rich  corbels reaching to the capitals of the main piers; while in the later  naves of Canterbury and Winchester, not only do they reach to the  ground, but they are forced so far forward, and rendered so prominent by  continuous mouldings on each side of them, that they become the most  significant part of the whole structure. They seem to be the columns on  which the vault is supported; and we have at last the avenue of stone.    [Illustration: The Nave.]    The nave of York Minster was built at an intermediate stage, in which  neither the vertical nor the horizontal tendency predominated. We might  have expected, therefore, a design something like that in the naves of  Exeter or Worcester; but the York builders were ambitious. They were  determined to build a nave both lofty and wide, and with a great space  for the display of stained glass. It seems likely, though we have no  evidence to support the theory, that they were influenced by French  example. There can be no doubt, as Professor Freeman has pointed out,  that the design is more French than that of any other large English  church, hitherto built, except Westminster Abbey. The most casual  observer will be struck at once by the large space occupied by the  glass. The clerestory is unusually large; the main arches unusually  high, and thus far the greater part of each bay is filled with the  clerestory and the aisle windows. With so much space given to the  highest and lowest storeys, it naturally follows that the triforium is  almost squeezed out of existence. Indeed, out of a total height of 99  feet, there are only about 13 between the top of the main arches and the  bottom of the clerestory. It would have been almost impossible to give  so narrow a triforium a separate and independent design; and, therefore,  by a device often found in French cathedrals, the triforium is merely a  continuation of the mullions of the clerestory windows. Behind these  mullions is the customary triforium passage; but the design really  consists only of two parts, the clerestory and the main arches. It is as  if the lower part of the light of the clerestory windows were divided  from the rest by a transom, and pierced, but not glazed, so as to let in  light to the passage behind them. This is the first example of this  treatment, which was so happily followed in the naves of Winchester and  Canterbury, in an English cathedral. In earlier examples, even where the  triforium was decisively divided into bays and had ceased to be a  continuous arcading, it was absolutely independent of the clerestory, as  in the transepts of the minster. There can be no doubt that the plan  adopted in the nave was a convenient and logical one. It is impossible  to have every advantage; and where the designer has set his heart on a  wall of glass, he cannot combine it with a rich and prominent triforium.  Unfortunately, the architect of the nave, though ambitious and logical  up to a certain point, did not carry his pursuit of the vertical  tendency far enough. He aimed at unity and coherence in the design of  each bay, and for the sake of that unity and coherence he was forced to  sacrifice the richness and fulness of pattern given by a prominent and  independent triforium. The later builders at Winchester and Canterbury  made up for this, as has been said, by the emphasis they gave to their  vertical lines. But at York, while the insignificance of the triforium  deprives the design of all horizontal continuity, there is little  attempt at vertical emphasis. True, large shafts rise from the floor to  the converging point of the ribs of the vault; but these shafts are not  forced forwards as at Winchester, but lie flat against the wall. They  are prominent enough when each individual bay is examined, but they do  not catch the eye when the nave is looked at as a whole. In the naves of  Salisbury or Beverley the eye is led on from west to east by the  circling band of the rich triforium; in the naves of Winchester and  Canterbury it is attracted from floor to roof by the upspringing  clusters of shafts; at York it wanders from point to point without any  prominent feature to catch it. The blank space in each bay between the  windows of the clerestory and the vaulting shafts ought to be a welcome  contrast to the curves of tracery, the clusters of pillars and mouldings  in a strong and forcible design. At York it appears to be simply a piece  of wall which requires decoration.    Everywhere there is a lack of emphasis, not only in structure but in  detail. The windows are not recessed, the capitals are small, the  mouldings are delicate rather than forcible. The main piers are thin,  their shafts are rather monotonously and tamely divided, the mouldings  of the arches are narrow and shallow, the mullions of the clerestory and  the shafts on each side of them are unusually slender; and this is  peculiarly unfortunate in a nave, the width of which is greater both  actually and proportionately, than that of any other English Gothic  cathedral. To make a successful design of such proportions, there was  need of strong vertical lines to give it the appearance of unusual  strength: and not only the appearance but the reality. It is a  significant fact that the builders were afraid to place a stone vault on  their nave, and thus it is a Gothic building without that feature which  gives its whole significance to the Gothic style, and by reason of which  the design of this nave came to be what it was. It is a curious paradox,  that the builders of York should have abandoned one of the most  attractive features of earlier art in pursuit of a more logical design,  and should then have been forced to abandon that very vault which gave  their design all its logic. It is as if a dramatist strictly  subordinated all his characters before the central figure of the hero,  and then discovered that the exigencies of the plot would not allow of  the introduction of the hero at all.    The most casual observer, on first entering the nave of York Minster,  must have a vague feeling of disappointment, a consciousness that  something is wanting; he will see that his feeling is justified, when he  learns that it is the first building in England of which the design is  entirely dominated by the necessities of a stone vault, and yet that it  is crowned by a wooden roof. But it must not be supposed that this nave  is altogether to be condemned, as some critics have condemned it. Each  bay, looked at by itself, is not only perfectly logical and coherent in  design, but is filled with delicate and appropriate detail. The  capitals, if small, are finely carved; the mouldings well contrasted and  subordinated; and the window tracery is the finest possible. It is a  work of the best age of architecture with all the characteristics in  detail of that age; yet it is not the work of a builder of genius, but  of a careful scholar, who has imperfectly assimilated the principles of  his masters.    In passing this judgment, it must be remembered that we are not rashly  coming to a conclusion on insufficient data. This nave is not a mere  beautiful scaffolding deprived of all its original decoration, like the  nave of Salisbury. If that is somewhat cold and wanting in richness, it  is the fault of later ages, which have deprived it of its stained glass.  At York the greater part of the stained glass remains. The vault has  been renewed, it is true, but it can never have been satisfactory; and  we may assume that in essentials we see the nave now as its designers  intended us to see it.    To pass to a detailed description, the nave is divided into eight bays,  of which the two nearest the lantern are narrower than the rest, no  doubt with the purpose of giving increased support to the tower. It is  about 263 feet long inside, and 48 feet wide, with the aisle 104 feet  wide in all. Its height is about 991/2 feet. Each bay is divided into  two main divisions of almost equal height; the upper half, consisting of  the triforium and clerestory, being only about 2 feet longer than the  lower, which consists of the main arches. These two halves are divided  by a slender horizontal moulding running immediately above the crown of  the main arches.    The piers of the main arches are octagonal in shape and unusually  slender. They are made up of shafts of different sizes, the larger ones  placed at the corners of the octagon, the smaller ones between them. The  grouping of these shafts should be compared with that of the Early  English piers in the transepts. There the central mass of masonry is  surrounded with shafts of Purbeck marble almost detached. Here the  different shafts are closely connected together and subordinated. The  earlier pier is made up, so to speak, of a bundle of shafts; the later  is a mass of masonry cut into different shapes. There can be no doubt  that in this case the treatment of the earlier pier, if less logical, is  more successful. The piers of the nave have capitals of beautiful  design, and well executed, but rather small and shallow. The moulding of  the arches is narrow, almost as narrow and small in detail as  Perpendicular work, but, of course, much more diversified in outline. On  each side of the main arches--that is to say, in their spandrels--is a  series of shields with coats of arms, said to be those of benefactors of  the minster. \"Murray's Hand-book\" gives the arms on the shields as  follow, beginning at the north-east end of the nave:--       1. Seme of fleur-de-lis--Old France.     2. Six lions rampant--Ulphus.     3. On a chevron, three lions passant guardant--Cobham.     4.

We can only  pray that a day may come when the envy between nations will cease, and  when each country shall respect its neighbor's rights in a truly  Christian spirit. Then we shall have a world for which we shall not  need to blush, and which will really be civilized.\"    \"Did the Saxon workmen have to make Dresden china in Germany?\"    \"Yes. Works under the patronage of the Emperor were opened at Berlin,  and here porcelain was made, the profits of which went to the Royal  Treasury, the workmen being paid very little indeed. Much of the ware  manufactured the monarch kept for his own use; and much of it he gave  away whenever he wished to make a fine present to his friends. But so  lavishly did the Saxon potters use the deposits of native clay that  later the supply became poorer in quality, and as a consequence the  body of the later Dresden was not so perfect as that made at  Meissen. For this reason collectors set great value on the early  Dresden work, that made between 1731 and 1756; also on the figures  modeled by the sculptor, Kaendler.\"    \"Did the works at Berlin continue?\" inquired Theo, who had become  absorbed in the story.    \"Yes,\" replied Mr. Croyden. \"You see, even before the capital at  Dresden was captured by the Germans and the Meissen workmen carried  off, attempts had been made in Prussia to manufacture porcelain from  ordinary stone. Several private business concerns as well as various  individuals had put their money into the enterprise and had even met  with some success. But this ware was manufactured on no very extended  scale. Now, however, the Emperor was determined that his venture  should succeed. Not only did he bring to Berlin the workmen and the  clay, but he even sent forth the edict that no Jew in his kingdom  should marry until he had purchased an entire supply of porcelain from  the Royal factories. As most of the Jews were rich this law assured  their master a wide sale for his product. That they did not wish to  spend all this money for china and resented the order troubled him not  at all. Most of these unlucky Jews bought their expensive porcelain  sets only to sell them afterward to other customers, and thus get them  off their hands. In this way much of the early Berlin Dresden ware  found its way into Russia, where rich Russian Jews were glad to buy  it. After repeated improvements the Berlin porcelain came in time to  be as fine as that made originally at Meissen; and not only were the  Meissen works reopened under German patronage, but the State also  established another factory at Charlottenberg.    \"Now, do not forget, Theo, that all this early Meissen or Dresden  porcelain, as well as that eventually manufactured at Berlin, was made  from hard paste, or a combination of clays resulting in what we call  true porcelain. Later on I shall tell you much about soft paste wares,  and about bone china. None of those varieties, however, ranks as real  porcelain. Remember that only the hard paste products are genuine.\"  Mr. Croyden paused a moment, then added: \"And while we are speaking  of this period in history you may perhaps be interested to know that  it was a workman who escaped from Meissen into Austria who started in  Vienna the art of making porcelain from hard paste.\"    \"True porcelain,\" remarked Theo, who had profited by his lesson.    \"Just so, son. Work in porcelain-making had been going on in Austria  since about 1717; but it had been done in a small way by private  individuals, who had only small capital to put into it, and who had  met with little success because the ware they had turned out had been  thick and muddy in appearance. In 1744 the Empress Maria Theresa  purchased these works, and from that time on they began to  prosper. You see, the monarchs of those days could make almost any  industry a success if they once set out to do so. Not only had they  the capital to back their undertaking but they could compel their  subjects to patronize the venture.\"    Theo laughed. \"I see.\"    \"Therefore by 1785 the Empress's china factory was a very busy place  which was supplying with porcelain not only Austria, but also  Turkey. In 1796 Lamprecht, one of the leading animal painters of the  monarchy, was decorating this ware with wonderful pictures of stags,  hounds, horses, in which work he excelled. But because of the  Mohammedan law that no copies of living creatures could be used for  designs the Turks refused to purchase these dishes. Hence Vienna,  eager to retain the Oriental trade, was forced to change its artistic  trend and make instead porcelains adorned with arabesques and  geometrical figures. At the present time,\" concluded Mr. Croyden,  \"there are extensive pottery and porcelain factories throughout  Germany and Austria-Hungary, and much of our finest ware comes from  these countries. Were you to study history you would find that many of  these factories sprang up from small beginnings, and that amid the  turmoil of European strife they had a stiff fight for existence.\"    \"I think I never considered before the effect of war upon anything but  persons,\" remarked Theo musingly.    \"Alas, the destruction war wages against human life is bad enough,\"  answered Mr. Croyden. \"But see, too, how it retards the arts and  industries of the world. May the day be not far distant when nations  shall find a more Christian and intelligent method of settling their  differences, and when wars shall cease forevermore!\"          [Illustration]          CHAPTER IX    THE ROMANCE OF FRENCH CHINA-MAKING      The next day when Mr. Croyden put his head in at Theo's door to say  good-morning he found the boy sitting up in bed eating his breakfast  and his first remark was:    \"How long did it take France to find out how to make porcelain,  Mr. Croyden?\"    The manufacturer laughed.    \"I declare if you are not beginning this morning just where you left  off last night!\" he exclaimed. \"What kind of porcelain do you mean,  hard or soft paste?\"    \"Oh, any kind.\"    \"You have not forgotten the vast difference between the hard and  soft ware, have you? I should be discouraged if you had.\"    Theo shook his head.    \"I don't believe you would let me forget even if I wanted to,\" he  replied with an impish chuckle.    \"I certainly shouldn't,\" smiled Mr. Croyden. Then he added more  seriously: \"Soft paste china, or pate tendre, as it is called, was  made at St. Cloud as early as 1695, and some of it was very  beautiful. Such ware looks more creamy and is not so cold and harsh to  the touch. It is, however, much more fragile and for that reason,  although a great deal of it was manufactured, the industry never  became a wide-spread success. Later soft paste was also made at  Chantilly, Vincennes, Limoges, Paris, and a number of French  cities. Even the celebrated Sevres ware, the finest thing in  china-making that France ever produced, was at first made from soft  paste. This is easily understood when you recall that at the beginning  the only clays the French knew anything about were pate tendre  clays. It was not until kaolin was discovered in 1765 and taken from  the section about St. Yrieix that hard paste, or pate dure, was  made in France.\"    \"I see.\"    \"Nevertheless the French people got wonderful results from their pate  tendre, and became wildly enthusiastic over the pieces the  china-designers turned out. And well they might for the French were an  inventive, art-loving people who certainly got fine results from their  early china-making. To understand the place art occupied at that time  you must remember that the Court was a centre for all those who were  interested in beautiful things. The King was ever on the lookout for  what was novel or artistic, and ready to give it his patronage; and  whatever the King patronized became the fad among the rich, idle  courtiers. So when the King turned his attention to the new art of  china-making its success was assured; as a matter of course all the  rest of the fashionable world did the same.\"    \"It was a good fashion.\"    \"A very good fashion. Often a monarch's patronage of arts and letters  called public attention to a praiseworthy production that might  otherwise live unrecognized for years. I sometimes think that in our  day it would be a fortunate custom if more persons of influence would  give thought and money to elevating the arts to their rightful  position of dignity. The old custom of placing artists and scientists  beyond the stress of financial worry is not a bad one. Such persons  are benefactors of the race and should be endowed that they may work  more freely. That is practically what the kings and emperors of the  past did for some of our great writers, artists, and inventors. That  is in reality what King Louis did for the newly-born china-industry.  When between 1740 and 1750 a company was formed at Vincennes to make  pate tendre, the King himself contributed to the venture 100,000  livres for its encouragment.\"    \"How splendid!\"    \"It meant prosperity for France if the undertaking succeeded, so the  act was not perhaps as unselfish as it seems; however, such a donation  was of course a great spur to the workmen, who immediately began  making not only dinner-sets and ordinary dishes but all sorts of  fantastic and beautiful things. They fashioned colored statuettes,  vases of fanciful pattern, and an abundance of most exquisitely  modeled flowers. How such fragile products as these latter could be  fired without injury was a marvel. Among other presents which the  china-makers gave to the Queen was a vase three feet in height  containing a bouquet of four hundred and eighty of these flowers, each  one carefully copied from nature. These china flowers promptly became  the rage. Two bouquets of them, each costing 3,000 livres, were made  for the King and the Dauphin; and these remain to this day in one of  the French museums.
