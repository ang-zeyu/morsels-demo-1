[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],[0,"The English Gipsies and Their Language (#14)"],[1,"in the  abstract.  I have seen this word printed as gorger in English slang.  CODGER, which is common, is applied, as Gipsies use the term Gorgio,  contemptuously, and it sounds still more like it.    BOSH, signifying nothing, or in fact empty humbug, is generally credited  to the Turkish language, but I can see no reason for going to the Turks  for what the Gipsies at home already had, in all probability, from the  same Persian source, or else from the Sanskrit.  With the Gipsies, _bosh_  is a fiddle, music, noise, barking, and very often an idle sound or  nonsense.  \"Stop your bosherin,\" or \"your bosh,\" is what they would term  _flickin lav_, or current phrase.    \"BATS,\" a low term for a pair of boots, especially bad ones, is, I think,  from the Gipsy and Hindustani _pat_, a foot, generally called, however,  by the Rommany in England, Tom Pats.  \"To pad the hoof,\" and \"to stand  pad \"--the latter phrase meaning to stand upright, or to stand and beg,  are probably derived from _pat_.  It should be borne in mind that  Gipsies, in all countries, are in the habit of changing certain letters,  so that _p_ and _b_, like _l_ and _n_, or _k_ and _g_ hard, may often be  regarded as identical.    \"CHEE-CHEE,\" \"be silent!\" or \"fie,\" is termed \"Anglo-Indian,\" by the  author of the Slang Dictionary, but we need not go to India of the  present day for a term which is familiar to every Gipsy and \"traveller\"  in England, and which, as Mr Simson discovered long ago, is an excellent  \"spell\" to discourage the advances of thimble-riggers and similar gentry,  at fairs, or in public places.    CHEESE, or \"THE CHEESE,\" meaning that anything is pre-eminent or  superior; in fact, \"the thing,\" is supposed by many to be of gipsy origin  because Gipsies use it, and it is to be found as \"chiz\" in Hindustani, in  which language it means a thing.  Gipsies do not, however, seem to regard  it themselves, as _tacho_ or true Rommanis, despite this testimony, and I  am inclined to think that it partly originated in some wag's perversion  of the French word _chose_.    In London, a man who sells cutlery in the streets is called a CHIVE  FENCER, a term evidently derived from the Gipsy _chiv_, a sharp-pointed  instrument or knife.  A knife is also called a _chiv_ by the lowest class  all over England.    COUTER or COOTER is a common English slang term for a guinea.  It was not  necessary for the author of the Slang Dictionary to go to the banks of  the Danube for the origin of a word which is in the mouths of all English  Gipsies, and which was brought to England by their ancestors.  A  sovereign, a pound, in Gipsy, is a _bar_.    A GORGER, meaning a gentleman, or well-dressed man, and in theatrical  parlance, a manager, is derived by the author of the Slang  Dictionary--absurdly enough, it must be confessed--from \"gorgeous,\"--a  word with which it has no more in common than with gouges or chisels.  A  gorger or gorgio--the two are often confounded--is the common Gipsy word  for one who is not Gipsy, and very often means with them a _rye_ or  gentleman, and indeed any man whatever.  Actors sometimes call a fellow-  performer a _cully-gorger_.    DICK, an English slang word for sight, or seeing, is purely Gipsy in its  origin, and in common use by Rommanis over all the world.    DOOK, to tell fortunes, and DOOKING, fortune-telling, are derived by the  writer last cited, correctly enough, from the Gipsy _dukkerin_,--a fact  which I specify, since it is one of the very rare instances in which he  has not blundered when commenting on Rommany words, or other persons'  works.    Mr Borrow has told us that a TANNER or sixpence, sometimes called a  Downer, owes its pseudonym to the Gipsy word _tawno_ or _tano_, meaning  \"little\"--the sixpence being the little coin as compared with a shilling.    DRUM or DROM, is the common English Gipsy word for a road.  In English  slang it is applied, not only to highways, but also to houses.    If the word GIBBERISH was, as has been asserted, first applied to the  language of the Gipsies, it may have been derived either from \"Gip,\" the  nickname for Gipsy, with _ish_ or _rish_ appended as in Engl-_ish_, I-  _rish_, or from the Rommany word _Jib_ signifying a language.    KEN, a low term for a house, is possibly of Gipsy origin.  The common  word in every Rommany dialect for a house is, however, neither ken nor  khan, but _Ker_.    LIL, a book, a letter, has passed from the Gipsies to the low \"Gorgios,\"  though it is not a very common word.  In Rommany it can be _correctly_  applied only to a letter or a piece of paper, which is written on, though  English Gipsies call all books by this name, and often speak of a letter  as a _Chinamangri_.    LOUR or LOWR, and LOAVER, are all vulgar terms for money, and combine two  Gipsy words, the one _lovo_ or _lovey_, and the other _loure_, to steal.  The reason for the combination or confusion is obvious.  The author of  the Slang Dictionary, in order to explain this word, goes as usual to the  Wallachian Gipsies, for what he might have learned from the first tinker  in the streets of London.  I should remark on the word loure, that Mr  Borrow has shown its original identity with _loot_, the Hindustani for  plunder or booty.    I believe that the American word loafer owes something to this Gipsy  root, as well as to the German _laufer_ (_landlaufer_), and Mexican  Spanish _galeofar_, and for this reason, that when the term first began  to be popular in 1834 or 1835, I can distinctly remember that it meant to  _pilfer_.  Such, at least, is my earliest recollection, and of hearing  school boys ask one another in jest, of their acquisitions or gifts,  \"Where did you loaf that from?\"  A petty pilferer was a loafer, but in a  very short time all of the tribe of loungers in the sun, and disreputable  pickers up of unconsidered trifles, now known as bummers, were called  loafers.  On this point my memory is positive, and I call attention to  it, since the word in question has been the subject of much conjecture in  America.    It is a very curious fact, that while the word _loot_ is unquestionably  Anglo-Indian, and only a recent importation into our English \"slanguage,\"  it has always been at the same time English-Gipsy, although it never rose  to the surface.    MAUNDER, to stroll about and beg, has been derived from _Mand_, the Anglo-  Saxon for a basket, but is quite as likely to have come from Maunder, the  Gipsy for \"to beg.\"  Mumper, a beggar, is also from the same source.    MOKE, a donkey, is _said_ to be Gipsy, by Mr Hotten, but Gipsies  themselves do not use the word, nor does it belong to their usual  language.  The proper Rommany word for an ass is _myla_.    PARNY, a vulgar word for rain, is supposed to have come into England from  the \"Anglo-Indian\" source, but it is more likely that it was derived from  the Gipsy _panni_ or water.  \"Brandy pawnee\" is undoubtedly an  Anglo-Indian word, but it is used by a very different class of people  from those who know the meaning of _Parny_.    POSH, which has found its way into vulgar popularity, as a term for small  coins, and sometimes for money in general, is the diminutive of the Gipsy  word _pashero_ or _poshero_, a half-penny, from _pash_ a half, and  _haura_ or _harra_, a penny.    QUEER, meaning across, cross, contradictory, or bad, is \"supposed\" to be  the German word _quer_, introduced by the Gipsies.  In their own language  _atut_ means across or against, though to _curry_ (German and Turkish  Gipsy _kurava_), has some of the slang meaning attributed to _queer_.  An  English rogue will say, \"to shove the queer,\" meaning to pass counterfeit  money, while the Gipsy term would be to _chiv wafri lovvo_, or _lovey_.    \"RAGLAN, a married woman, originally _Gipsy_, but now a term with English  tramps\" (_The Slang Dictionary_, _London_ 1865).  In Gipsy, _raklo_ is a  youth or boy, and _rakli_, a girl; Arabic, _ragol_, a man.  I am  informed, on good authority, that these words are known in India, though  I cannot find them in dictionaries.  They are possibly transposed from  _Lurka_ a youth and _lurki_ a girl, such transpositions being common  among the lowest classes in India.    RUMMY or RUMY, as applied to women, is simply the Gipsy word _romi_, a  contraction of _romni_, a wife; the husband being her _rom_.    BIVVY for beer, has been derived from the Italian _bevere_, but it is  probably Gipsy, since in the old form of the latter language, Biava or  Piava, means to drink.  To _pivit_, is still known among English Gipsies.    RIGS--running one's rigs is said to be Gipsy, but the only meaning of  _rig_, so far as I am able to ascertain in Rommany, is _a side_ or _an  edge_.  It is, however, possible that one's _side_ may in earlier times  have been equivalent to \"face, or encounter.\"  To _rikker_ or _rigger_ in  Gipsy, is to carry anything.    MOLL, a female companion, is probably merely the nickname for Mary, but  it is worth observing, that _Mal_ in old Gipsy, or in German Gipsy, means  an associate, and Mahar a wife, in Hindustani.    STASH, to be quiet, to stop, is, I think, a variation of the common Gipsy  word hatch, which means precisely the same thing, and is derived from the  older word _atchava_.    STURABAN, a prison, is purely Gipsy.  Mr Hotten says it is from the Gipsy  _distarabin_, but there is no such word beginning with _dis_, in the  English Rommany dialect.  In German Gipsy a prison is called  _stillapenn_.    TINY or TEENY has been derived from the Gipsy _tano_, meaning \"little.\"    TOFFER, a woman who is well dressed in new clean clothes, probably gets  the name from the Gipsy _tove_, to wash (German Gipsy _Tovava_).  She is,  so to speak, freshly washed.  To this class belong Toff, a dandy;  _Tofficky_, dressy or gay, and _Toft_, a dandy or swell.    TOOL as applied to stealing, picking pockets, and burglary, is, like  _tool_, to drive with the reins; derived beyond doubt from the Gipsy word"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16360"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 561, October 2, 1886 (#14)"],[1,"is to say, it may be arranged for a  comparatively small consumption of gas, while giving an increase of  250 per cent. of light.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. and FIG. 2. INCANDESCENT AND HIGH-POWER  BURNERS.]    The burner proper is a cage or basket of specially prepared magnesia,  which yields a warmer tone of light than any obtained hitherto, while  not requiring so high a temperature before combustion. The cap, made  of a fire-resisting substance, fits on to a tubular arrangement, R,  fixed in the upper portion of the body of the burner. The latter is  supplied by air entering at the cone, O, which terminates the inner  chamber, K, of the heater, and also by that drawn in by the rising  column of gas, passing before the orifices, D, which may be regulated  at will. The small burner, I, which is kept constantly alight, heats  the central compartment, K, the sides of which transmit heat to the  gas circulating in the annular casing, L, of the compartment. The  heated gas passes, by the passage, AA¹, into the space, C, where it  becomes intimately mixed with the air entering at OP, and also with  the outer air arriving by the lateral apertures, D.    The _vis viva_ of the jet is diffused through this mixture, which thus  becomes very intimate, when it penetrates into the tubular  arrangement, R; combustion now taking place at the top, while the  refractory cap emits a bright orange light of great steadiness. As it  is not the flow of gas which determines the entrance of the outer air,  the former may be used at any pressure--an advantageous arrangement in  all respects.    When the small burner, I, in the lower chamber is lighted, the  products of combustion issue by the orifice, O, of the compartment,  terminating in a needle like that of the steam injector; and the jet  draws along the air entering the apertures, PP, above the cone. The  gas from the pipe, arriving from the annular space, L, fills the two  lateral pockets shown in dotted lines, and passes through the  orifices, AA¹, which communicate with the upper chamber of the  burner. The manner in which it is conveyed thence to the tubular  arrangement has already been described.    Fig. 2 shows a more simple method of carrying out the same principle,  and of effecting a considerable saving in gas for a given intensity of  light. In this form, a wick, T, impregnated with an alkaline earthy  solution, a few seconds after lighting, affords a focus of white light  remarkable for its steadiness and brilliancy. A draught of air is  created by a jet of gas issuing from the hollow needle, B, and passing  through the vessel, D, which is provided with orifices, O, for the  entrance of air. The air and gas pass from D into C, whence (after  their intimate mixture is effected) they pass into the tubular  arrangement, F, at the top of which combustion takes place.    To regulate the proportions in which the air and gas should mingle, in  order that the combination should be as intimate as possible, the air  inlet is made variable by a perforated collar, which permits of the  orifices, O, being more or less covered. The other proportions of the  burner--that is to say, the relative capacity of the two compartments  and the length of the hollow needle--are determined by the sectional  area of the supply-pipe for the gas, which is admitted under moderate  pressure. Instead of a wire-gauze cap, impregnated with a solution of  metals or of salts, two fine platinum wires may be used--one bent into  the form of a semicircle of about an inch radius, and the other (of  slightly larger diameter) rolled spirally round the former. When both  ends of the two wires are connected with the upper portion of the  tubular arrangement (which in this case is flattened), and the gas is  ignited at the burner, the metallic arc becomes red hot, and then  brightly incandescent, emitting a light, less brilliant indeed than  with magnesia, but of remarkable steadiness.    In this case the production of light is chiefly due to the fact that  calorific condensation, caused by the use of the helicoidal coil  surrounding the curved wire, prevents loss of heat in this conductor.  In these forms of high-power burner, in which the gas is used directly  for the production of light, the difficulty generally encountered of  heating the air (present in a larger volume than the gas) has been  successfully overcome.    Fig. 3 shows the straight and outspread flame burner with a special  heater. In this arrangement the gas and air are heated before  combustion, in the compartment, G, directly exposed to the action of a  small Bunsen burner, R, which is placed (in an opaque glass) in the  middle of a lyre-shaped figure formed by the two gas-pipes, AA. The  burner proper consists of two fine annular passages meeting above, and  emitting a thin annular sheet of gas over the guide, T, made of a  white refractory substance placed between the two annular jets. The  object of this guide is to stretch the incandescent sheet of flame,  composed of several jets, and interpose friction, so as to prevent a  too rapid ascent of hot gases.    [Illustration: FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 REGENERATIVE BURNERS WITH INVERTED  FLAMES.]    The luminous focus is placed within a glass globe, C, mounted on the  bell, B, of the heater; and the external air enters this bell,  mingling with the products of combustion of the heating burner, R. The  portion, D, of the annular passage, B, being made of a highly  conductive metal, the gas becomes heated in passing to the burner, so  that both gas and air are raised to the same temperature by the time  they reach the orifices of the burner. Instead of prolonging the  gas-pipe to the point of bifurcation, a chamber may be arranged  immediately below the guide, for the gas and air to become intimately  mixed by passing through several perforations or wire gauze, receiving  the excess of heat from the white porcelain guide. The admission of  gas to both the main and heating burners is regulated by a double  valve in the pipe; but this arrangement may be used without any  previous heating of the gas and air.    Fig. 4 shows a similar arrangement to that above described, but  reversed; the gas and air being previously heated by the products of  combustion. The two pipes, D, lead the gas to the burner; and the  incandescent sheet of flame is drawn over a white refractory  substance, having in its center an orifice through which the hot gases  rise to the upper portion of the burner. The luminous sheet is spread  out all the better on account of this return of the flames, which also  causes the mixture of air and gas to be more complete than when they  rise directly. The gas escapes horizontally from the orifices of the  annular burner, B, and mingles with the double current of hot air  which rushes in above the flame inside the globe, and also below  through the central portion of the burner.    This lamp throws its light vertically downward; and its illuminating  power may be increased by providing, above the incandescent sheet, a  reflector, which diverts into a useful direction the rays thrown  toward the ceiling. In this arrangement of lamp the flame is  excessively condensed by its being turned back over the refractory  guide; and this condensation greatly favors the production of light.  On the other hand, the combustion of the gas is very perfect, because  the currents of hot air are thrown directly upon the two sides of the  flame; and thus the reciprocal action becomes more intense. Lastly,  the division of the gas into a large number of small jets, in contact  with which the hot air forms an intimate mixture, causes a greater  quantity of molecules to partake in the combinations; thus affording a  proportionate increase of temperature in a given space and time.    [Illustration: FIG. 5. REGENERATIVE BURNER WITH FLAME DEFLECTED  OUTWARD.]    Owing to these various circumstances, the final effective duty of this  burner is advantageous, so that it yields an illuminating power which  may be put at from 200 to 250 per cent. above that of ordinary  burners, and about 25 per cent. more than that of other regenerative  burners. The flame is comparatively steady; the loss due to the  friction over the white porcelain being almost eliminated, because the  flame only presses upon the guide for a small portion of its surface,  and is only spread out to the extent of its dark zone.    The contact between the incandescent sheet of flame and the guide may  be made as short as desired, and the motion of the gaseous mass be  directed by a simple button placed in the center of the burner; thus  giving the form shown by Fig. 5, which, however, differs from the  previous figure in the fact that the inverted flame is directed  outward instead of inward.    In this arrangement the button, T, is fixed in the middle of the  burner, which is made cylindrical and annular, or may consist of a  ring of small tubes, to which the gas is led by a single pipe; leaving  the whole \"furnace\" free for the circulation of air and the products  of combustion. This is the most recent development of the principle  patented by M. Somzee in 1882, viz., the formation of an illuminating  sheet of flame, spread out laterally, while heating the gas and air by  the products of combustion.    Figs. 6 and 7 show two forms of burner designed especially to give  economical results with a small consumption of gas. The former is an  ordinary Argand burner in which hot air is introduced into the upper  portion of the flame, so as to increase the activity of combustion.  The luminous sheet of flame is then spread out by a metal disk  attached to the end of the tube, D, which introduces the air into the  flame. The outer air becomes heated in its passage through the wire  gauze, T, which absorbs the heat liberated in the interior of the  apparatus, and also that which is radiated from the incandescent sheet  and reflected by a metal shield, P,"]]]
