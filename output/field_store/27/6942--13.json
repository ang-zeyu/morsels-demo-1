But in this, as in all other instances, the rightness of the  secondary passion depends on its being grafted on those two primary  instincts, the love of order and of kindness, so that indignation  itself is against the wounding of love. Do you think the +menis  Achileos+ came of a hard heart in Achilles, or the \"Pallas te hoc  vulnere, Pallas,\" of a hard heart in Anchises' son?      91. And now, if with this clue through the labyrinth of them, you  remember the course of the arts of great nations, you will perceive that  whatever has prospered, and become lovely, had its beginning--for no  other was possible--in the love of order in material things associated  with true +dikaiosune+: and the desire of beauty in material  things, which is associated with true affection, _charitas_, and with  the innumerable conditions of gentleness expressed by the different uses  of the words +charis+ and _gratia_. You will find that this love  of beauty is an essential part of all healthy human nature, and though  it can long co-exist with states of life in many other respects  unvirtuous, it is itself wholly good;--the direct adversary of envy,  avarice, mean worldly care, and especially of cruelty. It entirely  perishes when these are wilfully indulged; and the men in whom it has  been most strong have always been compassionate, and lovers of justice,  and the earliest discerners and declarers of things conducive to the  happiness of mankind.      92. Nearly every important truth respecting the love of beauty in its  familiar relations to human life was mythically expressed by the Greeks  in their various accounts of the parentage and offices of the Graces.  But one fact, the most vital of all, they could not in its fulness  perceive, namely, that the intensity of other perceptions of beauty is  exactly commensurate with the imaginative purity of the passion of love,  and with the singleness of its devotion. They were not fully conscious  of, and could not therefore either mythically or philosophically  express, the deep relation within themselves between their power of  perceiving beauty, and the honour of domestic affection which found  their sternest themes of tragedy in the infringement of its laws;--which  made the rape of Helen the chief subject of their epic poetry, and which  fastened their clearest symbolism of resurrection on the story of  Alcestis. Unhappily, the subordinate position of their most revered  women, and the partial corruption of feeling towards them by the  presence of certain other singular states of inferior passion which it  is as difficult as grievous to analyse, arrested the ethical as well as  the formative progress of the Greek mind; and it was not until after an  interval of nearly two thousand years of various error and pain, that,  partly as the true reward of Christian warfare nobly sustained through  centuries of trial, and partly as the visionary culmination of the faith  which saw in a maiden's purity the link between God and her race, the  highest and holiest strength of mortal love was reached; and, together  with it, in the song of Dante, and the painting of Bernard of Luino and  his fellows, the perception, and embodiment for ever of whatsoever  things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of  good report;--that, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise,  men might think on those things.      93. You probably observed the expression I used a moment ago, the  _imaginative_ purity of the passion of love. I have not yet spoken, nor  is it possible for me to-day, to speak adequately, of the moral power of  the imagination: but you may for yourselves enough discern its nature  merely by comparing the dignity of the relations between the sexes, from  their lowest level in moths or mollusca, through the higher creatures in  whom they become a domestic influence and law, up to the love of pure  men and women; and, finally, to the ideal love which animated chivalry.  Throughout this vast ascent it is the gradual increase of the  imaginative faculty which exalts and enlarges the authority of the  passion, until, at its height, it is the bulwark of patience, the tutor  of honour, and the perfectness of praise.      94. You will find farther, that as of love, so of all the other  passions, the right government and exaltation begins in that of the  Imagination, which is lord over them. For to _subdue_ the passions,  which is thought so often to be the sum of duty respecting them, is  possible enough to a proud dulness; but to _excite_ them rightly, and  make them strong for good, is the work of the unselfish imagination. It  is constantly said that human nature is heartless. Do not believe it.  Human nature is kind and generous; but it is narrow and blind; and can  only with difficulty conceive anything but what it immediately sees and  feels. People would instantly care for others as well as themselves if  only they could _imagine_ others as well as themselves. Let a child fall  into the river before the roughest man's eyes;--he will usually do what  he can to get it out, even at some risk to himself; and all the town  will triumph in the saving of one little life. Let the same man be shown  that hundreds of children are dying of fever for want of some sanitary  measure which it will cost him trouble to urge, and he will make no  effort; and probably all the town would resist him if he did. So, also,  the lives of many deserving women are passed in a succession of petty  anxieties about themselves, and gleaning of minute interests and mean  pleasures in their immediate circle, because they are never taught to  make any effort to look beyond it; or to know anything about the mighty  world in which their lives are fading, like blades of bitter grass in  fruitless fields.      95. I had intended to enlarge on this--and yet more on the kingdom which  every man holds in his conceptive faculty, to be peopled with active  thoughts and lovely presences, or left waste for the springing up of  those dark desires and dreams of which it is written that \"every  imagination of the thoughts of man's heart is evil continually.\" True,  and a thousand times true it is, that, here at least, \"greater is he  that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city.\" But this you can  partly follow out for yourselves without help, partly we must leave it  for future enquiry. I press to the conclusion which I wish to leave with  you, that all you can rightly do, or honourably become, depends on the  government of these two instincts of order and kindness, by this great  Imaginative faculty, which gives you inheritance of the past, grasp of  the present, authority over the future. Map out the spaces of your  possible lives by its help; measure the range of their possible agency!  On the walls and towers of this your fair city, there is not an ornament  of which the first origin may not be traced back to the thoughts of men  who died two thousand years ago. Whom will _you_ be governing by your  thoughts, two thousand years hence? Think of it, and you will find that  so far from art being immoral, little else except art is moral; that  life without industry is guilt, and industry without art is brutality:  and for the words \"good\" and \"wicked,\" used of men, you may almost  substitute the words \"Makers\" and \"Destroyers.\" Far the greater part of  the seeming prosperity of the world is, so far as our present knowledge  extends, vain: wholly useless for any kind of good, but having assigned  to it a certain inevitable sequence of destruction and of sorrow. Its  stress is only the stress of wandering storm; its beauty the hectic of  plague: and what is called the history of mankind is too often the  record of the whirlwind, and the map of the spreading of the leprosy.  But underneath all that, or in narrow spaces of dominion in the midst of  it, the work of every man, \"qui non accepit in vanitatem animam suam,\"  endures and prospers; a small remnant or green bud of it prevailing at  last over evil. And though faint with sickness, and encumbered in ruin,  the true workers redeem inch by inch the wilderness into garden ground;  by the help of their joined hands the order of all things is surely  sustained and vitally expanded, and although with strange vacillation,  in the eyes of the watcher, the morning cometh, and also the night,  there is no hour of human existence that does not draw on towards the  perfect day.      96. And perfect the day shall be, when it is of all men understood that  the beauty of Holiness must be in labour as well as in rest. Nay!  _more_, if it may be, in labour; in our strength, rather than in our  weakness; and in the choice of what we shall work for through the six  days, and may know to be good at their evening time, than in the choice  of what we pray for on the seventh, of reward or repose. With the  multitude that keep holiday, we may perhaps sometimes vainly have gone  up to the house of the Lord, and vainly there asked for what we fancied  would be mercy; but for the few who labour as their Lord would have  them, the mercy needs no seeking, and their wide home no hallowing.  Surely goodness and mercy shall _follow_ them, _all_ the days of their  life; and they shall dwell in the house of the Lord--FOR EVER.          LECTURE IV    THE RELATION OF ART TO USE      97. Our subject of enquiry to-day, you will remember, is the mode in  which fine art is founded upon, or may contribute to, the practical  requirements of human life.    Its offices in this respect are mainly twofold: it gives Form to  knowledge, and Grace to utility; that is to say, it makes permanently  visible to us things which otherwise could neither be described by our  science, nor retained by our memory; and it gives delightfulness and  worth to the implements of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19166"],[0,"The Quirt (#14)"],[1,"in one way or another.  They would find themselves fenced off from water, the Sawtooth having  acquired the water rights to creek or spring. Or they would be hemmed in  with fenced fields and would find it next to impossible to make use of  the law which gave them the right to \"condemn\" a road through. They  would not be openly assailed,--Bill Warfield was an intelligent man. A  dozen brands were recorded in the name of the Sawtooth Cattle Company,  and if a small rancher found his calf crop shorter than it should be, he  might think as he pleased, but he would have no tangible proof that his  calves wore a Sawtooth brand.    Inevitably it became necessary now and then to stop a mouth that was  ready to speak unwelcome truths. But if a Sawtooth man were known to  have committed violence, the Sawtooth itself was the first to put the  sheriff on his trail. If the man successfully dodged the sheriff and  made his way to parts unknown, the Sawtooth could shrug its shoulders  and wash its hands of him.    Then whispers were heard that the Sawtooth had on its pay roll men who  were paid to kill and to leave no trace. So many heedless ones crossed  the Sawtooth's path to riches! Fred Thurman had been one; a \"bull-headed  cuss\" who had the temerity to fight back when the Sawtooth calmly laid  claim to the first water rights to Granite Creek, having bought it, they  said, with the placer claim of an old miner who had prospected along the  headwaters of Granite at the base of Bear Top.    By that time the Sawtooth had grown to a power no poor man could hope to  defeat. Bill Warfield was Senator Warfield, and Senator Warfield was a  power in the political world that immediately surrounded him. Since his  neighboring ranchmen had not been able to prevent his steady climbing to  the position he now held, they had small hope of pulling him down. Brit  was right. They did well to hang on and continue living in that  country.    An open killing, one that would attract the attention of the outside  world, might be avenged. The man who committed the crime might be  punished,--if public opinion were sufficiently massed against him. In  that case Senator Warfield would cry loudest for justice. But it would  take a stronger man than the country held to raise the question of Fred  Thurman's death and take even the first steps toward proving it a  murder.    \"It ain't that they can _do_ anything, Mr. Warfield,\" the man from  Whisper said guardedly, urging his horse close to the machine that stood  in the trail from Echo. It was broad day--a sun-scorched day to  boot--and Senator Warfield perspired behind the wheel of his car. \"It's  the talk they may get started.\"    \"What have they said? The girl was at the ranch for several days. She  didn't talk there, or Hawkins would have told me.\"    \"She was sick. I saw her the other day at the Quirt, and she more'n half  recognized me. Hell! How'd _I_ know she was in there among them rocks?  Everybody that was apt to be riding through was accounted for, and I  knew there wasn't any one coming horseback or with a rig. My hearing's  pretty good.\"    Warfield moved the spark lever up and down on the wheel while he  thought. \"Well,\" he said carefully at last, \"if you're falling down in  your work, what are you whining about it to me for? What do you want?\"    Al moistened his lips with his tongue. \"I want to know how far I can go.  It's been hands off the Quirt, up to now. And the Quirt's beginning to  think it can get away with most anything. They've throwed a fence across  the pass through from Sugar Spring to Whisper. That sends us away around  by Three Creek. You can't trail stock across Granite Ridge, nor them  lava ledges. If it's going to be hands off, I want to know it. There's  other places I'd rather live in, if the Quirt's going to raise talk  about Fred Thurman.\"    Senator Warfield pulled at his collar and tie as if they choked him.  \"The Quirt has made no trouble,\" he said. \"Of course, if they begin  throwing fences across our stock trails and peddling gossip, that is  another story. I expect you to protect our interests, of course. And I  have never made a practice of dictating to you. In this case\"--he sent a  sharp glance at Al--\"it seems to me your interests are involved more  than ours. As to Fred Thurman, I don't know anything about it. I was not  here when he died, and I have never seen this girl of Brit's who seems  to worry you. She doesn't interest me, one way or the other.\"    \"She seems to interest Bob a whole lot,\" Al said maliciously. \"He rode  over to see her yesterday. She wasn't home, though.\"    Senator Warfield seemed unmoved by this bit of news, wherefore Al  returned to the main issue.    \"Do I get a free hand, or don't I?\" he insisted. \"They can't be let  peddle talk--not if I stay around here.\"    Senator Warfield considered the matter.    \"The girl's got the only line on me,\" Al went on. \"The inquest was as  clean as I ever saw. Everything all straight--and then, here she comes  up----\"    \"If you know how to stop a woman's mouth, Al, you can make a million a  month telling other men.\" Senator Warfield smiled at him. Then he leaned  across the front seat and added impressively, \"Bear one thing in mind,  Al. The Sawtooth cannot permit itself to become involved in any scandal,  nor in any killing cases. We're just at the most crucial point with our  reclamation project, over here on the flat. The legislature is willing  to make an appropriation for the building of the canal, and in two or  three months at the latest we should begin selling agricultural tracts  to the public. The State will also throw open the land it had withdrawn  from settlement, pending the floating of this canal project. More than  ever the integrity of the Sawtooth Cattle Company must be preserved,  since it has come out openly as a backer of the irrigation company.  Nothing--_nothing_ must be permitted to stand in the way.\"    He removed his thin driving cap and wiped his perspiring forehead. \"I'm  sorry this all happened--as it has turned out,\" he said, with real  regret in his tone. \"But since it did happen, I must rely upon you  to--to--er----\"    \"I guess I understand,\" Al grinned sardonically. \"I just wanted you to  know how things is building up. The Quirt's kinda overreached itself. I  didn't want you comin' back on me for trying to keep their feet outa the  trough. I want you to know things is pretty damn ticklish right now, and  it's going to take careful steppin'.\"    \"Well, don't let your foot slip, Al,\" Senator Warfield warned him. \"The  Sawtooth would hate to lose you; you're a good man.\"    \"Oh, I get yuh,\" Al retorted. \"My foot ain't going to slip---- If it  did, the Sawtooth would be the first to pile onto my back!\" The last  sentence was not meant for the senator's ears. Al had backed his horse,  and Senator Warfield was stepping on the starter. But it would not have  mattered greatly if he had heard, for this was a point quite thoroughly  understood by them both.    The Warfield car went on, lurching over the inequalities of the narrow  road. Al shook his horse into a shambling trot, picking his way  carelessly through the scattered sage.    His horse traveled easily, now and then lifting a foot high to avoid  rock or exposed root, or swerving sharply around obstacles too high to  step over. Al very seldom traveled along the beaten trails, though there  was nothing to deter him now save an inherent tendency toward  secretiveness of his motives, destinations and whereabouts. If the  country was open, you would see Al Woodruff riding at some distance from  the trail--or you would not see him at all, if there were gullies in  which he could conceal himself. He was always \"line-riding,\" or hunting  stray stock--horses, usually--or striking across to some line-camp of  the Sawtooth, on business which he was perfectly willing to state.    But you will long ago have guessed that he was the evil eye of the  Sawtooth Company. He took no orders save such general ones as Senator  Warfield had just given him. He gave none. Whatever he did he did alone,  and he took no man into his confidence. It is more than probable that  Senator Warfield would never have known to a certainty that Al was  responsible for Thurman's death, if Al had not been worried over the  Quirt's possible knowledge of the crime and anxious to know just how far  his power might go.    Ostensibly he was in charge of the camp at Whisper, a place far enough  off the beaten trails to free him from chance visitors. The Sawtooth  kept many such camps occupied by men whose duty it was to look after the  Sawtooth cattle that grazed near; to see that stock did not \"bog down\"  in the tricky sand of the adjacent water holes and die before help came,  and to fend off any encroachments of the smaller cattle owners,--though  these were growing fewer year by year, thanks to the weeding-out policy  of the Sawtooth and the cunning activities of such as Al Woodruff.    It may sound strange to say that the Sawtooth country had not had a real  \"killing\" for years, though accidental deaths had been rather frequent.  One man, for instance, had fallen over a ledge and broken his neck,  presumably while drunk. Another had bought a few sticks of dynamite to  open up a spring on his ranch, and at the inquest which followed the  jury had returned a verdict of \"death caused by being blown up by the  accidental discharge of dynamite.\" A sheepman was struck by lightning,  according to the coroner, and his widow had been glad to sell ranch and  sheep very cheaply to the Sawtooth and return to her relatives in  Montana. The Sawtooth had shipped the sheep within a month and turned  the ranch into another line-camp.    You will see that Senator Warfield had every reason to be sincere when  he called Al Woodruff a good man; good for the Sawtooth interests, that  means. You will also see that Brit Hunter had reasons for believing that  the"]]]
