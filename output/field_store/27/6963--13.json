[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19331"],[0,"Ceremonial of Hasjelti Dailjis and Mythical Sand Painting of the Navajo Indians (#14)"],[1,"  These gods stand upon the mountain tops and call the clouds to gather  around them. Hasjelti is the mediator between the Navajo and the sun. He  prays to the sun, \"Father, give me the light of your mind, that my mind  may be strong; give me some of your strength, that my arm may be strong,  and give me your rays that corn and other vegetation may grow.\" It is to  this deity that the most important prayers of the Navajo are addressed.  The lesser deities have shorter prayers and less valuable offerings made  to them. Hasjelti communicates with the Navajo through the feathered  kingdom, and for this reason the choicest feathers and plumes are placed  in the cigarettes and attached to the prayer sticks offered to him.          THE FLOATING LOGS.      A man sat thinking, \"Let me see; my songs are too short; I want more  songs; where shall I go to find them?\" Hasjelti appeared and, perceiving  his thoughts, said, \"I know where you can go to get more songs.\" \"Well, I  much want to get more, and I will follow you.\" When they reached a certain  point in a box canyon in the Big Colorado River they found four gods (the  Hostjobokon) at work hewing logs of cottonwood. Hasjelti said, \"This will  not do; cottonwood becomes water-soaked; you must use pine instead of  cottonwood.\" The Hostjobokon then began boring the pine with flint, when  Hasjelti said, \"That is slow work,\" and he commanded the whirlwind to  hollow the log. A Jerusalem cross was formed with one solid log and a  hollow one. The song-hunter entered the hollow log and Hasjelti closed the  end with a cloud, that the water of the river might not enter when the  logs were launched upon the great waters. The Hostjobokon, accompanied by  their wives, rode upon the logs, a couple sitting on the end of each cross  arm. These were accompanied by Hasjelti, Hostjoghon, and two Naaskiddi,  who walked on the banks to ward the logs off from the shore. Hasjelti  carried a squirrel skin filled with tobacco from which to supply the gods  on their journey. Hostjoghon carried a staff ornamented with eagle and  turkey plumes and a gaming ring with two humming birds tied to it with  white cotton cord. The two Naaskiddi carried staffs of lightning.(7) After  floating a long distance down the river they came to waters that had a  shore on one side only, and they landed. Here they found people like  themselves. These people, on learning of the song-hunter's wish, gave to  him many songs and they painted pictures on a cotton blanket and said,  \"These pictures must go with the songs. If we give this blanket to you you  will lose it. We will give you white earth and black coals which you will  grind together to make black paint, and we will give you white sand,  yellow sand, and red sand, and for the blue paint you will take white sand  and black coals with a very little red and yellow sand. These together  will give you blue.(8)\"    The song-hunter remained with these people until the corn was ripe. There  he learned to eat corn and he carried some back with him to the Navajo,  who had not seen corn before, and he taught them how to raise it and how  to eat it.    As the logs would not float upstream the song-hunter was conveyed by four  sunbeams, one attached to each end of the cross-logs, to the box canyon  whence he emerged. Upon his return he separated the logs, placing an end  of the solid log into the hollow end of the other and planted this great  pole in the river, whereto this day it is to be seen by those so  venturesome as to visit this point.    The old song priest who related this myth to me regretted that so few of  his people now visited the sacred spot.    \"When I was young,\" he said, \"many went there to pray and make offerings.\"          NAIYENESGONY AND TOBAIDISCHINNI.      This world was destroyed five times. The first time by a whirlwind; the  second, by immense hail stones; the third, by smallpox, when each pustule  covered a whole cheek; the fourth, all was destroyed by coughing; the  fifth time Naiyenesgony and Tobaidischinni went over the earth slaying all  enemies.    These two boys were born at Tohatkle (where the waters are mated), near  Ute Mountain, in Utah; they were the children of Ahsonnutli. Ahsonnutli  and Yolaikaiason (the white-shell woman) were the creators of shells.  Ahsonnutli had a beard under her right arm and Yolaikaiason had a small  ball of flesh under her left arm from which they made all shells. The eyes  of Naiyenesgony and Tobaidischinni were shells placed on their faces by  Ahsonnutli; the shells immediately becoming brilliant the boys could look  upon all things and see any distance without their eyes becoming weary. A  stick colored black was placed to the forehead of Naiyenesgony and one  colored blue to that of Tobaidischinni. When Naiyenesgony shook his head  the stick remained firm on the forehead, but he felt something in the palm  of his hand, which proved to be three kinds of seeds, and he said, \"We  must go by this.\" When Tobaidischinni shook his head the stick dropped off  the forehead and they thought a long time and said, \"We must go by this.\"  This is why the deer sheds his horns. In ceremonials the breath is drawn  from sticks which are made to represent the originals; the sticks are also  held to wounds as a curative.    These two boys grew from infancy to manhood in four days and on the fourth  day they made bows and arrows; on the fifth day they began using them.  Although they were the children of Ahsonnutli they did not know her as  their mother, but supposed her to be their aunt. Frequently they inquired  of her where they could find their father. She always told them to stop  their inquiries, for they had no father. Finally they said to her, \"We  know we have a father and we intend to go and look for him.\" She again  denied that they had a father, but they were determined and they journeyed  far to the east and came to the house of the sun. The house was of white  shell, and the wife of the sun (Yolaikaiason) was also of white shell. The  wife inquired of the youths where they were from, and, said she, \"What do  you want here?\" They replied, \"We came to hunt our father.\" When the sun  returned to his home in the evening he discovered the youths as soon as he  entered his house and he asked, \"Where are those two boys from?\" The wife  replied, \"You say you never do anything wrong when you travel; these two  boys call you father and I know they are your children.\" The wife was very  angry. The sun sent the boys off a distance and threw a great roll of  black clouds at them intending to kill them, but they were not injured,  and they returned to the house. He then pushed them against a sharp stone  knife, but they slipped by uninjured. Four times they were thrust against  the knife, but without injury. The sun finding his attempts unsuccessful  said, \"It is so, you are my sons.\" The sun then ordered Hasjelti and  Toneennili (these two were special attendants upon the sun) to build a  sweat house and put the boys in, that they might die from the heat.  Toneennili made an excavation inside of the sweat house, put the boys into  the hole, and placed a rock over the hole and built a fire over the rock.  When the rock became very hot the sun ordered Toneennili to sprinkle it  four times with water, being careful to keep the entrance to the sweat  house closely covered. After a time he uncovered the entrance and removing  the rock the sun commanded the boys to come out. He did not expect to be  obeyed, as he thought and hoped the boys were dead, but they came out  unharmed. The sun then said, \"You are indeed my own children; I have tried  in vain to destroy you.\" The boys wished to return to the woman whom they  supposed to be their aunt. Before departing the sun asked them what they  wished; they said, \"We want bows and arrows, knives, and good leggings.  There are people around the world eating our people (the Navajo). Some of  these people are great giants and some are as small as flies; we wish to  kill them with lightning.\" The sun gave the youths clothing that was  invulnerable, and he gave them lightning with which to destroy all  enemies, and a great stone knife. They then went over the world.  Naiyenesgony killed with the lightning arrows and Tobaidischinni scalped  with his knife. After all enemies had been destroyed Naiyenesgony and  Tobaidischinni said to the Navajo, \"Now we will leave you and return to  our home in the Ute Mountains, where the waters are mated, but before  leaving you we will give to you the ten songs and prayers that will bring  health and good fortune to your people. Tobaidischinni is the parent of  all waters.\"          THE BROTHERS.      The Tolchini (a Navajo clan) lived at Wind Mountain. One of the brothers  became crazy and he went off a long way, and on his return brought with  him a pine bough; a second time he returned with corn, and from each trip  he brought something new and had a story to tell about it. His brothers  would not believe him, and said, \"He is crazy; he does not know what he is  talking about.\" The brothers, however, became very jealous of him, and  constantly taunted him with being a crazy liar. The Tolchini left the Wind  Mountain and went to a rocky foothill east of San Mateo Mountain. They had  nothing to eat but a kind of seed grass. The eldest brother said, \"Let us  go hunt,\" and told the crazy brother not to leave the camp. But after five  days and nights and no word coming from the brothers he determined to  follow them and help them, bring home the game; he thought they had killed  more deer than they could carry. After a day's travel he camped near a  canyon, selecting a cavelike place in which to sleep, for he was tired and  thirsty. There was much snow, but no water, so he made a fire and heated a  rock and made a hole in the ground, and placing the rock in the cavity put  in some snow, which melted and furnished him a draft to quench his thirst."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19337"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#14)"],[1,"be. They could scarcely be supposed to  have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was  Past, and this Ghost's province was the Future. Nor could he think of  any one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could apply them.  But nothing doubting that, to whomsoever they applied, they had some  latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every  word he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the  shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the  conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would  render the solution of these riddles easy.    He looked about in that very place for his own image, but another man  stood in his accustomed corner, and, though the clock pointed to his  usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among  the multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little  surprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of  life, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out  in this.    Quiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched  hand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied, from  the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that  the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and  feel very cold.    They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town,  where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its  situation and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shops  and houses wretched; the people half naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly.  Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of  smell, and dirt, and life upon the straggling streets; and the whole  quarter reeked with crime, with filth and misery.    Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling  shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and  greasy offal were bought. Upon the floor within were piled up heaps of  rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse  iron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred  and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and  sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a  charcoal stove made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly  seventy years of age, who had screened himself from the cold air without  by a frouzy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line, and  smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.    Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a  woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely  entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too, and she was  closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by  the sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other.  After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with  the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.    \"Let the charwoman alone to be the first!\" cried she who had entered  first. \"Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the  undertaker's man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here's a  chance! If we haven't all three met here without meaning it!\"    \"You couldn't have met in a better place,\" said old Joe, removing his  pipe from his mouth. \"Come into the parlour. You were made free of it  long ago, you know; and the other two an't strangers. Stop till I shut  the door of the shop. Ah! How it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of  metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's no  such old bones here as mine. Ha! ha! We're all suitable to our calling,  we're well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.\"    The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked  the fire together with an old stair-rod, and, having trimmed his smoky  lamp (for it was night) with the stem of his pipe, put it into his mouth  again.    While he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on  the floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool; crossing her  elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.    \"What odds, then? What odds, Mrs. Dilber?\" said the woman. \"Every person  has a right to take care of themselves. _He_ always did!\"    \"That's true, indeed!\" said the laundress. \"No man more so.\"    \"Why, then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid, woman! Who's the  wiser? We're not going to pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose?\"    \"No, indeed!\" said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. \"We should hope  not.\"    \"Very well, then!\" cried the woman. \"That's enough. Who's the worse for  the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose?\"    \"No, indeed,\" said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.    \"If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,\"  pursued the woman, \"why wasn't he natural in his lifetime? If he had  been, he'd have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with  Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.\"    \"It's the truest word that ever was spoke,\" said Mrs. Dilber, \"It's a  judgment on him.\"    \"I wish it was a little heavier judgment,\" replied the woman; \"and it  should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands  on anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value  of it. Speak out plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for  them to see it. We knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves  before we met here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.\"    But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in  faded black, mounting the breach first, produced _his_ plunder. It was  not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons,  and a brooch of no great value, were all. They were severally examined  and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give  for each upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found  that there was nothing more to come.    \"That's your account,\" said Joe, \"and I wouldn't give another sixpence,  if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who's next?\"    Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two  old-fashioned silver tea-spoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few boots.  Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner.    \"I always give too much to ladies. It's a weakness of mine, and that's  the way I ruin myself,\" said old Joe. \"That's your account. If you asked  me for another penny, and made it an open question, I'd repent of being  so liberal, and knock off half-a-crown.\"    \"And now undo _my_ bundle, Joe,\" said the first woman.    Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it,  and, having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large heavy  roll of some dark stuff.    \"What do you call this?\" said Joe. \"Bed-curtains?\"    \"Ah!\" returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed  arms. \"Bed-curtains!\"    \"You don't mean to say you took 'em down, rings and all, with him lying  there?\" said Joe.    \"Yes, I do,\" replied the woman. \"Why not?\"    \"You were born to make your fortune,\" said Joe, \"and you'll certainly do  it.\"    \"I certainly shan't hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by  reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He was, I promise you,  Joe,\" returned the woman coolly. \"Don't drop that oil upon the blankets,  now.\"    \"His blankets?\" asked Joe.    \"Whose else's do you think?\" replied the woman. \"He isn't likely to take  cold without 'em, I dare say.\"    \"I hope he didn't die of anything catching? Eh?\" said old Joe, stopping  in his work, and looking up.    \"Don't you be afraid of that,\" returned the woman. \"I an't so fond of  his company that I'd loiter about him for such things, if he did. Ah!  You may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you won't find  a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It's the best he had, and a fine  one too. They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me.\"    \"What do you call wasting of it?\" asked old Joe.    \"Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,\" replied the woman with  a laugh. \"Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If  calico an't good enough for such a purpose, it isn't good enough for  anything. It's quite as becoming to the body. He can't look uglier than  he did in that one.\"    Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about  their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man's lamp, he  viewed them with a detestation and disgust which could hardly have been  greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse  itself.    \"Ha, ha!\" laughed the same woman when old Joe, producing a flannel bag  with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. \"This is  the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when he  was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!\"    \"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. \"I see, I see. The  case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way now.  Merciful Heaven, what is this?\"    He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost  touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which, beneath a ragged  sheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb,  announced itself in awful language.    The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy,  though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse,  anxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light, rising in the  outer air, fell straight upon the bed: and on it, plundered and bereft,  unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.    Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom.
