OTHO'S GOVERNMENT AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF FORCES    Meanwhile, contrary to all expectation, Otho was no prey to idle        71  luxury. He postponed his pleasures and disguised his extravagance,  suiting all his behaviour to the dignity of his position. But people  knew they had not seen the last of his vices, and his virtuous  hypocrisy only increased their alarm. He gave orders to summon Marius  Celsus to the Capitol. This was the consul-elect whom he had rescued  from the savage clutches of the soldiers by pretending to put him in  prison.[152] Otho now wanted to earn a name for clemency by pardoning  a well-known man, who had fought against his party. Celsus was firm.  Pleading guilty to the charge of fidelity to Galba, he went on to show  that he had set an example which was all to Otho's advantage. Otho  treated him as if there was nothing to pardon. Calling on heaven to  witness their reconciliation, he then and there admitted him to the  circle of his intimate friends, and subsequently gave him an  appointment as one of his generals. Celsus remained faithful to Otho  too, doomed apparently to the losing side. His acquittal, which  delighted the upper classes and was popular with the mass of the  people, even earned the approval of the soldiers, who now admired the  qualities which had previously aroused their indignation.    Equal rejoicing, though for different reasons, followed the             72  long-looked-for downfall of Ofonius Tigellinus. Born of obscure  parentage, he had grown from an immoral youth into a vicious old man.  He rose to the command first of the Police,[153] and then of the  Praetorian Guards, finding that vice was a short cut to such rewards  of virtue. In these and other high offices he developed the vices of  maturity, first cruelty, then greed. He corrupted Nero and introduced  him to every kind of depravity; then ventured on some villainies  behind his back, and finally deserted and betrayed him. Thus in his  case, as in no other, those who hated Nero and those who wished him  back agreed, though from different motives, in calling loudly for his  execution. During Galba's reign he had been protected by the influence  of Titus Vinius, on the plea that he had saved his daughter. Saved her  he had, not from any feelings of pity (he had killed too many for  that), but to secure a refuge for the future. For all such rascals,  distrusting the present and fearing a change of fortune, always  prepare for themselves a shelter against public indignation by  obtaining the favour of private persons. So they rely to escape  punishment not on their innocence but on a system of mutual insurance.  People were all the more incensed against Tigellinus, since the recent  feeling against Vinius was added to their old hatred for him. From all  quarters of Rome they flocked to the palace and the squares; and above  all, in the circus and the theatre, where the mob enjoys complete  licence, they assembled in crowds and broke out into riotous uproar.  Eventually Tigellinus at Sinuessa Spa[154] received the news that his  last hour was inevitably come. There after a cowardly delay in the  foul embraces of his prostitutes he cut his throat with a razor, and  blackened the infamy of his life by a hesitating and shameful death.    About the same time there arose a demand for the punishment of          73  Calvia Crispinilla. But she was saved by various prevarications, and  Otho's connivence cost him some discredit. This woman had tutored Nero  in vice, and afterwards crossed to Africa to incite Clodius Macer[155]  to civil war. While there she openly schemed to start a famine in  Rome. However, she secured herself by marrying an ex-consul, and lived  to enjoy a wide popularity in Rome. She escaped harm under Galba,  Otho, and Vitellius, and eventually wielded a great influence due to  her being both rich and childless, considerations of the first  importance in any state of society.    During this time Otho wrote constantly to Vitellius, holding out        74  various effeminate inducements, making him offers of money or an  influential position, or any retreat he liked to select for a life of  luxury.[156] Vitellius made similar offers. At first both wrote in the  mildest tone, though the affectation on either side was stupid and  inappropriate. But they soon struck a quarrelsome note, and reproached  each other with immorality and crime, both with a good deal of truth.  Otho recalled the commission which Galba had sent out to Germany,[157]  and, using the pretext of senatorial authority, sent fresh  commissioners to both the armies in Germany, and also to the Italian  legion, and the troops quartered at Lugdunum. However, the  commissioners remained with Vitellius with a readiness which showed  they were under no compulsion; and the guards who had been attached to  them, ostensibly as a mark of honour, were sent back at once before  they had time to mix with the legionary soldiers. Further than this,  Fabius Valens sent letters in the name of the German army to the  Guards and the City Garrison, extolling the strength of his own side  and offering to join forces. He even went so far as to reproach them  with having transferred to Otho the title which had long before[158]  been conferred on Vitellius. Thus they were assailed with threats       75  as well as promises, and told that they were not strong enough to  fight, and had nothing to lose by making peace. But, in spite of all,  the fidelity of the Guards remained unchanged. However, Otho  dispatched assassins to Germany, Vitellius to Rome. Neither met with  success. Vitellius' assassins were lost in the crowds of Rome, where  nobody knows anybody, and thus escaped detection: Otho's were betrayed  by their strange faces, since the troops all knew each other by sight.  Vitellius then composed a letter to Otho's brother Titianus,[159]  threatening that his life and his son's should answer for the safety  of Vitellius' mother and children. As it happened neither household  suffered. Fear was perhaps the reason in Otho's time, but Vitellius,  after his victory, could certainly claim credit for clemency.    The first news which gave Otho any degree of confidence was the         76  announcement from Illyricum that the legions of Dalmatia and Pannonia  and Moesia[160] had sworn allegiance to him. Similar news arrived from  Spain, and Cluvius Rufus[161] was commended in a special decree, but  it was found out immediately afterwards that Spain had gone over to  Vitellius. Even Aquitania soon fell away, although Julius Cordus had  sworn in the province for Otho. Loyalty and affection seemed dead: men  changed from one side to the other under the stress of fear or  compulsion. It was fear which gave Vitellius the Province of Narbonese  Gaul,[162] for it is easy to go over when the big battalions are so  near. The distant provinces and the troops across the sea all remained  at Otho's disposal, but not from any enthusiasm for his cause; what  weighed with them was the name of Rome and the title of the senate.  Besides, Otho had got the first hearing. Vespasian swore in the Jewish  army[163] for Otho, and Mucianus the legions in Syria;[164] Egypt too  and all the provinces towards the East were held for him. He also  received the submission of Africa, where Carthage had taken the lead,  without waiting for the sanction of the governor, Vipstanus  Apronianus. Crescens, one of Nero's freedmen--in evil days these  creatures play a part in politics[165]--had given the common people of  the town a gala dinner in honour of the new emperor, with the result  that the inhabitants hurried into various excesses. The other African  communities followed the example of Carthage.    The provinces and their armies being thus divided, Vitellius could      77  only win the throne by fighting. Otho meanwhile was carrying on the  government as if the time were one of profound peace. Sometimes he  consulted the country's dignity, though more often the exigencies of  the moment forced him into unseemly haste. He held the consulship  himself with his brother Titianus as colleague until the first of  March. For the next two months he appointed Verginius, as a sort of  sop to the army in Germany.[166] As colleague he gave him Pompeius  Vopiscus, ostensibly because he was an old friend of his own, but it  was generally understood as a compliment to Vienne.[167] For the rest  of the year the appointments which Nero or Galba had made were allowed  to stand. The brothers Caelius and Flavius Sabinus[168] were consuls  for June and July, Arrius Antoninus[169] and Marius Celsus for August  and September; even Vitellius after his victory did not cancel their  appointment. To the pontifical and augural colleges Otho either  nominated old ex-magistrates, as the final crown of their career, or  else, when young aristocrats returned from exile, he instated them by  way of recompense in the pontifical posts which their fathers or  grandfathers had held. He restored Cadius Rufus, Pedius Blaesus, and  _Saevinus Proculus_[170] to their seats in the senate. They had been  convicted during Claudius' and Nero's reigns of extortion in the  provinces. In pardoning them the name of their offence was changed,  and their greed appeared as 'treason'. For so unpopular was the law of  treason that it sapped the force of better statutes.[171]    Otho next tried to win over the municipalities and provincial           "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1694"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage: The First Thousand Years: 600 - 1600 (#14)"],[1," or narrow overlapping wood  shingles. The floor was strewn with hay and there was a hearth  near the center of the floor, with a louvered smoke hole in the  timber roof for escape of smoke. There were barns for grain and  animals. Beyond this area was a garden, orchard, and sometimes a  vineyard. The area was circumscribed by a moat over which there  was a drawbridge to a gatehouse.    The smaller room was the lord and lady's bedroom. It had a  canopied bed, chests for clothing, and wood frames on which  clothes could be hung. Life on the manor revolved around the  larger room, or hall, where the public life of the household was  passed. There, meals were served. The daily diet typically  consisted of milk, soup, porridge, fish, vegetables, and bread.  Open hospitality accompanied this communal living. There was  little privacy. Manor household villeins carried the lord's  sheaves of grain to the manor barn, shore his sheep, malted his  grain, and chopped wood for his fire. At night some slept on the  floor of the hall and others, cottars and bordars, had there  own dwellings nearby.    Games with dice were sometimes played. In winter, youths  ice-skated with bones fastened to their shoes. They propelled  themselves by striking the ice with staves shod with iron. On  summer holydays, they exercised in leaping, shooting with the  bow, wrestling, throwing stones, and darting a thrown spear. The  maidens danced with timbrels. Since at least 1133, children's  toys included dolls, drums, hobby horses, pop guns, trumpets,  and kites.    The cold, indoors as well as outdoors, necessitated that people  wear ample and warm garments. Men and women of position dressed  in long full cloaks reaching to their feet, sometimes having  short full sleeves. The cloak generally had a hood and was  fastened at the neck with a brooch. Underneath the cloak was a  simple gown with sleeves tight at the wrist but full at the  arm-hole, as if cut from the same piece of cloth. A girdle or  belt was worn at the waist. When the men were hunting or  working, they wore gown and cloak of knee length. Humble folk  also wore knee-length garments, with a band about the waist.    There was woodland, common pasture land, arable land, meadow  land, and wasteland on the manor. The arable land was allotted  to the villeins in strips to equalize the best and worst land  and their distance from the village where the villeins lived.  There was three-way rotation of wheat or rye, oats or barley, and  fallow land. Cows, pigs, sheep, and fowl were kept. The meadow  was allocated for hay for the lord's household and each  villein's. The villeins held land of their lord for various  services such as agricultural labor or raising domestic animals.  The villeins, who worked the farm land as their ancestor ceorls  had, now were so bound to the land that they could not leave or  marry or sell an ox without their lord's consent. If the manor  was sold, the villein was sold as a part of the manor. The  villeins worked about half of their time on their lord's fields  [his demesne land], which was about a third of the farmland. This  work was primarily to gather the harvest and to plough with  oxen, using a yoke over their shoulders, and to sow in autumn  and Lent. They threshed grain on barn floors with flails cut  from holly or thorn, and removed the kernels from the shafts by  hand. Work lasted from sunrise to sunset and included women and  children. Life expectancy was probably below thirty-five.    The villeins of a manor elected a reeve to communicate their  interests to their lord, usually through a bailiff, who directed  the labor. Sometimes there was a steward in charge of several of  a lord's manors, who also held the manorial court for the lord.  The steward held his land of the lord by serjeanty, which was a  specific service to the lord. Other serjeanty services were  helping in the lord's hunting expeditions and looking after his  hounds. The Woodward preserved the timber. The Messer supervised  the harvesting. The Hayward removed any fences from the fields  after harvest to allow grazing by cattle and sheep. The Coward,  Bullard, and Calvert tended the cows, bulls, and calves; the  Shepherd, the sheep; and the Swineherds the pigs. The Ponder  impounded stray stock.    The majority of manors were co-extensive with a single village.  The villeins lived in the village in one-room huts enclosed by a  wood fence, hedge, or stone wall. In this yard was a garden of  onions, leeks, mustard, peas, beans, parsley, garlic, herbs, and  cabbage and apple, pear, cherry, quince, and plum trees, and  bee-hives. The hut had a high-pitched roof thatched with reeds or  straw and low eaves reaching almost to the ground. The walls are  built of wood-framing overlaid with mud or plaster. Narrow slits  in the walls serve as windows, which have shutters and are  sometimes covered with coarse cloth. The floor is dirt and may  be covered with straw or rushes for warmth, but usually no  hearth. At one end of the hut was the family living area, where  the family ate on a collapsible trestle table with stools or  benches and used drinking horns and wooden bowls and spoons,  along with jars and other earthenware. Their usual food was beans  and peas, and some bacon, butter, cheese, and vegetables, rough  bread made from a mixture of wheat, barley, and rye flour,  honey, and herrings or other salt fish. They drank water, milk,  buttermilk, apple cider, mead, ale made from barley malt, and  bean and vegetable broth. Cooking was done over a fire with iron  tripod, pots, and kettle. Most of the food was boiled. They slept  on straw mattresses or sacks on the floor or on benches. The  villein regarded his bed area as the safest place in the house,  as did people of all ranks, and kept his treasures there, which  included his farm implements, as well as hens on the beams,  roaming pigs, and perhaps stalled oxen. Around the room are a  couple of chests to store salt, meal, flour, a broom made of  birch trigs, some woven baskets, the distaff and spindle for  spinning, and a simple loom for weaving. All clothes were  homemade. They were often coarse, greasy wool and leather made  from their own animals. The man wore a tunic of coarse linen  embroidered on the sleeves and breast, around with he wore a  girdle of rope, leather, or folded cloth. Sometimes he also wore  breeches reaching below the knee. The woman wore a loose  short-sleeved gown, under which was a tight fitting garment with  long loose sleeves. If they wore shoes, they were clumsy and  patched. Some wore a hood-like cap. At the other end of the hut  were the horses, cattle, pigs, and poultry. In the middle is a  wood fire burning on a hearthstone. The smoke rises through a  hole in the roof.    The villein and his wife and children worked from daybreak to  dusk in the fields, except for Sundays and holydays. He had  certain land to farm for his own family, but had to have his  grain milled at his lord's mill at the lord's price. He had to  retrieve his wandering cattle from his lord's pound at the lord's  price. He was expected to give a certain portion of his own  produce, whether grain or livestock, to his lord. However, if he  fell short, he was not put off his land. When his daughter or  son married, he had to pay a \"merchet\" to his lord. He could not  have a son educated without the lord's permission, and this  usually involved a fee to the lord. His best beast at his death,  or \"heriot\", went to his lord. If he wanted permission to live  outside the manor, he paid \"chevage\" yearly. Woodpenny was a  yearly payment for gathering dead wood. Sometimes a \"tallage\"  payment was taken at the lord's will. The villein's oldest son  usually took his place on his land and followed the same customs  with respect to the lord. For an heir to take his dead  ancestor's land, the lord demanded payment of a \"relief\", which  was usually the amount of a year's income but sometimes as much  as the heir was willing to pay to have the land. The usual aids  were also expected to be paid.    A large village also had a smith, a wheelwright, a millwright, a  tiler and thatcher, a shoemaker and tanner, a carpenter  wainwright and carter.    Markets were about twenty miles apart because a farmer from the  outlying area could then carry his produce to the nearest town  and walk back again in the daylight hours of one day. In this  local market he could buy foodstuffs, livestock, household  goods, fuels, skins, and certain varieties of cloth.    The cloth was crafted by local weavers, dyers, and fullers, who  made the cloth full and dense by washing, soaping, beating, and  agitating it. Then its surface could be raised with teazle-heads  and cropped or sheared to make a nap. Some cloth was sold to  tailors to make into clothes. Butchers bought, slaughtered, and  cut up animals to sell as meat. Some was sold to cooks, who sold  prepared foods. The hide was bought by the tanner to make into  leather. The leather was sold to shoemakers and glovemakers.  Millers bought harvested grain to make into flour. Flour was  sold to bakers to make into breads. Wood was bought by  carpenters and by coopers, who made barrels, buckets, tubs, and  pails. Tilers, oil-makers and rope-makers also bought raw  material to make into finished goods for sale. Wheelwrights made  ploughs, harrows, carts, and later waggons. Smiths and  locksmiths worked over their hot fires.    The nation grew with the increase of population, the development  of towns, and the growing mechanization of craft industries.  There were watermills for crafts in all parts of the nation.  There were also some iron furnaces.    Stone bridges over rivers could accommodate one person traveling  by foot or by horseback and were steep and narrow.    Merchants, who had come from the low end of the knightly class or  high end of the villein class, settled around the open market  areas, where main roads"]]]
