Being white, it does not stain the handkerchief.  It is best when sold fresh made, as by age the citrine oils oxidize, and  the perfume acquires an ethereal odor, and then customers say \"it is  sour.\" The vervaine thus prepared enters into the composition of a great  many of the favorite bouquets that are sold under the title \"Court  Bouquet,\" and others which are mixtures of violet, rose, and jasmine,  with verbena or vervaine in different proportions. In these  preparations, as also in Eau de Portugal, and in fact where any of the  citrine ottos are used, a much finer product is obtained by using grape  spirit or brandy in preference to the English corn spirit as a solvent  for them. Nor do they deteriorate so quickly in French spirit as in  English. Whether this be due to the oil of wine (oeanthic ether) or  not we cannot say, but think it is so.    VIOLET.--        \"The forward violet thus did I chide:      Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,      If not from my love's breath?\"    The perfume exhaled by the _Viola odorata_ is so universally admired,  that to speak in its favor would be more than superfluous. The demand  for the \"essence of violets\" is far greater than the manufacturing  perfumers are at present able to supply, and as a consequence, it is  difficult to procure the genuine article through the ordinary sources of  trade.    Real violet is, however, sold by many of the retail perfumers of the  West End of London, but at a price that prohibits its use except by the  affluent or extravagant votaries of fashion. The violet farms from  whence the flowers are procured to make this perfume are very extensive  at Nice and Grasse, also in the neighborhood of Florence. The true  smelling principle or otto of violets has never yet been isolated: a  very concentrated solution in alcohol impresses the olfactory nerve with  the idea of the presence of hydrocyanic acid, which is probably a true  impression. Burnett says that the plant _Viola tricolor_ (heart's ease),  when bruised, smells like peach kernels, and doubtless, therefore,  contains prussic acid.    The flowers of the heart's ease are scentless, but the plant evidently  contains a principle which in other species of the Viola, is eliminated  as the \"sweet that smells\" so beautifully alluded to by Shakspeare.    For commercial purposes, the odor of the violet is procured in  combination with spirit, oil, or suet, precisely according to the  methods previously described for obtaining the aroma of some other  flowers before mentioned, such as those for cassie, jasmine,  orange-flower, namely, by maceration, or by _enfleurage_, the former  method being principally adopted, followed by, when \"essence\" is  required, digesting the pomade in rectified alcohol.    Good essence of violets, thus made, is of a beautiful green color, and,  though of a rich deep tint, has no power to stain a white fabric, and  its odor is perfectly natural.    The essence of violet, as prepared for retail sale, is thus made,  according to the quality and strength of the pomade:--Take from six to  eight pounds of the violet pomade, chop it up fine, and place it into  one gallon of perfectly clean (free from fusel oil) rectified spirit,  allow it to digest for three weeks or a month, then strain off the  essence, and to every pint thereof add three ounces of tincture of orris  root, and three ounces of esprit de cassie; it is then fit for sale.    We have often seen displayed for sale in druggists' shops plain tincture  of orris root, done up in nice bottles, with labels upon them inferring  the contents to be \"Extract of Violet;\" customers thus once \"taken in\"  are not likely to be so a second time.    A good IMITATION ESSENCE OF VIOLETS is best prepared thus--    Spirituous extract of cassie pomade,         1 pint.  Esprit de rose, from pomade,               1/2 \"  Tincture of orris,                         1/2 \"  Spirituous extract of tuberose pomade,     1/2 \"  Otto of almonds,                            3 drops.    After filtration it is fit for bottling. In this mixture, it is the  extract of cassie which has the leading smell, but modified by the rose  and tuberose becomes very much like the violet. Moreover, it has a green  color, like the extract of violet; and as the eye influences the  judgment by the sense of taste, so it does with the sense of smell.  Extract of violet enters largely into the composition of several of the  most popular bouquets, such as extract of spring flowers and many  others.    VITIVERT, or Kus-Kus, is the rhizome of an Indian grass. In the  neighborhood of Calcutta, and in the city, this material has an  extensive use by being manufactured into awnings, blinds, and  sun-shades, called Tatty. During the hot seasons an attendant sprinkles  water over them; this operation cools the apartment by the evaporation  of the water, and, at the same time, perfumes the atmosphere, in a very  agreeable manner, with the odoriferous principle of the vitivert. It has  a smell between the aromatic or spicy odor and that of flowers--if such  a distinction can be admitted. We classify it with orris root, not that  it has any odor resembling it, but because it has a like effect in use  in perfumery, and because it is prepared as a tincture for obtaining its  odor.    About four pounds of the dried vitivert, as it is imported, being cut  small and set to steep in a gallon of rectified spirits for a fortnight,  produces the    ESSENCE OF VITIVERT of the shops. In this state it is rarely  used as a perfume, although it is occasionally asked for by those who,  perhaps, have learnt to admire its odor by their previous residence in  \"the Eastern clime.\" The extract, essence, or tincture of vitivert,  enters into the composition of several of the much-admired and old  bouquets manufactured in the early days of perfumery in England, such as  \"_Mousselaine des Indies_,\" for which preparation M. Delcroix, in the  zenith of his fame, created quite a _furor_ in the fashionable world.    [Illustration: Vitivert.]    Essence of vitivert is also made by dissolving 2 oz. of otto of vitivert  in 1 gallon of spirit; this preparation is stronger than the tincture,  as above.    MARECHALE and BOUQUET DU ROI, perfumes which have also  \"had their day,\" owe much of their peculiarity to the vitivert contained  in them.    Bundles of vitivert are sold for perfuming linen and preventing moth,  and, when ground, is used to manufacture certain sachet powders.    Otto of vitivert is procurable by distillation; a hundred-weight of  vitivert yields about 14 oz. of otto, which in appearance very much  resembles otto of santal. I have placed a sample of it in the museum at  Kew.    VOLKAMERIA.--An exquisite perfume is sold under this name,  presumed, of course, to be derived from the _Volkameria inermis_  (LINDLEY). Whether it has a smell resembling the flower of that  plant, or whether the plant blooms at all, we are unable to say. It is a  native of India, and seems to be little known even in the botanic  gardens of this country; however, the plant has a name, and that's  enough for the versatile Parisian perfumer, and if the mixture he makes  \"takes\" with the fashionable world--the plant which christens it has a  fine perfume for a certainty!    ESSENCE OF VOLKAMERIA.    Esprit de violette,      1 pint.     \"      tubereuse,      1  \"     \"      jasmine,      1/4  \"     \"      rose,         1/2  \"  Essence de muse,           2 oz.    WALLFLOWER (_Cherianthus_).--Exquisite as is the odor of this  flower, it is not used in perfumery, though no doubt it might be, and  very successfully too, were the plant cultivated for that purpose. To  this flower we would direct particular attention, as one well adapted  for experiments to obtain its odoriferous principle in this country, our  climate being good for its production. The mode for obtaining its odor  has been indicated when we spoke of heliotrope, page 60. And if it  answers on the small scale, there is little doubt of success in the  large way, and there is no fear but that the scent of the old English  wallflower will meet with a demand.    An IMITATION ESSENCE OF WALLFLOWER can be compounded thus:--    Extract fleur d'orange,         1 pint.    \"     vanilla,                1/2 \"  Esprit de rose,                  1  \"  Extract of orris,               1/2 \"    \"     cassie,                 1/2 \"  Essential oil of almonds,      5 drops.    Allow this mixture to be made up for two or three weeks prior to putting  it up for sale.    WINTER GREEN (_Trientalis Europoea_).--A perfuming otto can  be procured by distilling the leaves of this plant: it is principally  consumed in the perfuming of soaps. Upon the strength of the name of  this odorous plant a very nice handkerchief perfume is made.    ICELAND WINTER GREEN.    Esprit de rose,             1 pint.  Essence of lavender,        1/4 \"  Extract of neroli,          1/2 \"    \"        vanilla,         1/4 \"    \"        vitivert,        1/4 \"    \"        cassie,          1/2 \"    \"        ambergris,       1/4 \"    We have now described all the important odoriferous bodies which are  used by the manufacturing perfumer, as derived from the botanic kingdom;  it may be understood that where an odoriferous material is unnoticed,  it has no qualities peculiar enough to be remarked on, and that the  methods adopted for preparing its essence, extract, water, or oil, are  analogous to those that have been already noticed, that is, by the  processes of _maceration_, _absorption_, or _enfleurage_ for flowers, by  _tincturation_ for roots, and by _distillation_ for seeds, modified  under certain circumstances.    There are, however, three other important derivative odors--ambergris,  civet, and musk--which, being from the animal kingdom, are treated  separately from plant odors, in order, it is considered, to render the  whole matter less confused to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16399"],[0,"A Winter Tour in South Africa (#14)"],[1,"the people of South Africa were doing for themselves, and       confess I was amazed when I saw the great docks, by means of which       the commerce of South Africa is being encouraged, and by which it       will hereafter be developed. I was impressed, too, with the       educational institutions, the great Public Library, worthy of any       town, the South African Museum, the South African College, and the       various efforts made to bring the newest and best knowledge home to       the people. But perhaps in Cape Town, the thing which impressed me       as most curious was the new dock, in process of construction by       excavating stone for the breakwater and other purposes. This work       was carried on by coloured convict labour. The convicts thus become       trained in useful manual work, as well as in habits of obedience,       and when they are discharged, are not only better men, but people       in whose work employers of labour have confidence. I learned that       the great public mountain roads in Cape Colony have thus been       constructed by convict labour, at a comparatively small cost, while       the convict acquires skill and useful training. Going up country,       my attention, among other matters, was turned to the distribution       of mineral wealth and difficulties of water supply, for, as Sir       Frederick Young has remarked, the water supply is one of the great       problems which all persons have to consider in South Africa. The       season during which rain falls is short, and the rain drains       rapidly down comparatively steep inclined surfaces, so that science       of many kinds has to be enlisted to conserve the water, and turn       the supply to account. I found the rocks of much of the country       have been curiously compressed and hardened and thrown into       parallel irregular folds, and that these rocks were afterwards worn       down by the action of water, at a time when the land was still       beneath the ocean, with the result that many basin-shaped       depressions are preserved and exposed, each of which holds a       certain amount of water. Just as we never dream of putting down a       well in this country without knowing the positions of the       water-bearing strata, so it is hopeless to bore profitably for       water in the Colony till the districts are defined over which the       water-bearing basins are spread. Nothing arrests the escape of       water in its course through the rocks more efficiently than       intrusive sheets of igneous rock which rise to the surface, but       until the distribution of these dykes is systematically recorded it       will not be possible to open out all the water which is preserved       underground. There is no doubt that by utilising geological facts       of this nature, a better water supply may be obtained, which will       enable more land to be brought under cultivation, and larger crops       to be raised. I may say that the Colonial Government is fully aware       of the importance of following out such lines of work, and steps       are being taken to give effect to such exploration. Vegetation,       however, by its radiating power, must always be one of the chief       aids to improved water supply. In the matter of mineral wealth,       Cape Colony is not so rich as some adjacent lands. It contains       coal, but the individual beds of coal are thin, and owing to this       thinness the coal necessarily alternates with shale, which is more       conspicuous than in the coal fields of Britain. I remember that       Professor Sedgwick, my old master in geology, told me that in his       youth seams of coal only some four to six inches thick were worked       on the sides of hills in Yorkshire, and that the coal was carried       on horseback over the country to supply the wants of the mountain       population. Cape Colony is in a far better state than that. In the       Eastern Province the beds of coal are frequently a foot or two or       more in thickness. They crop out on the surface with a slight dip       near to the railway, and although only worked at present in a few       pits (as at Cyphergat, Fairview, Molteno--I did not visit the       Indwe)--the coal-bearing rocks certainly extend over a much wider       area of country than that which has been explored. One of the happy       results at which I arrived in my short visit to this district was       to find that there are certain extinct forms of reptilian life       associated with these coal beds, by means of which the geological       horizon upon which the coal occurs may be traced through the       country; so that there is a prospect of this mineral being followed       along its outcrop in the Eastern Province with comparative ease by       this means. It is desirable on all accounts that coal should be       burned rather than timber, since the destruction of wood is harmful       to the supply of water. With regard to the gold of Cape Colony, I       have not the requisite knowledge to speak with the same confidence.       The quantity in any district is probably small: the amount is great       in the aggregate, but very widely diffused. Gold appears to be       present in small amounts in almost all the volcanic rocks, so that       as those rocks decay and new mineral substances are formed out of       the decomposed products, the gold which they contained is often       preserved and concentrated in thin and narrow veins of zeolitic       minerals, which extend over the surface of these volcanic rocks. To       what extent these zeolites may be hereafter worked with profit it       is impossible at present to say, for much may depend upon water       supply, by means of which the ore would be crushed and washed, and       much on the varying quantities of gold present in samples from       different localities. On the whole, the utilisation of science in       the service of man, especially in relation to metals, coal, and       water supply, if systematically carried out, will, I believe, be an       element of future prosperity to Cape Colony, and enable the Colony       to minister to the welfare of adjacent lands.         Mr. J.X. MERRIMAN: I am sure South Africans are very grateful       indeed to the amiable and kindly critic in the person of Sir       Frederick Young. It is no new thing to Colonists to owe him a debt.       All those present will acknowledge the great things he has done for       the Colonies in connection with the Royal Colonial Institute. Sir       Frederick Young is a man who has been content to look after small       things, and the result is this Institute has been worked up by the       individual efforts of Colonists and others to its present       flourishing condition. I hope the Institute will long flourish,       and never be absorbed by anything under more magnificent       auspices--in other words, that you will \"paddle your own canoe.\" It       is good sometimes to have a plain statement from a plain man. South       Africa suffers under a plague of experts who, after spending a few       weeks there, tell us exactly what we ought to do; and we don't like       it. I wish I could speak to you as a sort of amiable critic, but I       have the misfortune to belong to that much-despised class the local       politician, and I notice that, when anybody says anything about the       Colonies in England, all unite in kicking the local politician. In       order not to sail under false colours, I state frankly that I       belong to that class. Of course, South Africa is creating a deal of       interest at the present time. People who come to fortunes usually       do excite a great deal of interest among relations who may in times       gone by have given them the cold shoulder. There can be no doubt as       to the material prosperity of South Africa at the present time, and       still less doubt as to the future. The gold fields of Witwatersrand       are unique in the world. This is not my own statement, but the       statement of eminent mining engineers from America. For thirty       miles and more you have a continuous stretch of reef, which gives       throughout a uniform yield per ton, and which has been proved to       the depth of some hundred feet, and may--there is every reason to       believe--go to unknown depths. The reefs are now being worked in       the most economical manner. When proper appliances for mining are       used, and when we get the stock-jobbers off our backs, I believe a       career of prosperity will open of which few people dream. From       another point of view, to those who love the country and make their       home there, there cannot but be a seamy side to the picture. Great       wealth brings other things in its train. It has brought into South       Africa a great spirit of gambling. People neglect the honest       industries of the country: they leave their farm work, and rush off       to make fortunes in a minute. Everybody--from the king to the       beggar--is gambling in gold shares. Everybody neglects his       business, and talks about nothing else. I ask whether this is a       wholesome state of society? Is it not a state of society to which       we may look with some degree of apprehension? I believe myself that       things will work round, but, undoubtedly, the state of affairs is       serious. After all, there is something which goes to build up a       country besides material wealth, and I am not sure that gambling in       gold shares is exactly the thing which is wanted. Of course, there       have been other countries where these vast increases of material       wealth have occurred--California and Australia--but there the       conditions were different. They were new countries, which attracted       large numbers of white men, and, when they found the gold fields       did not pay, they made homes for"]]]
