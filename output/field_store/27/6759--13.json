Towards the latter end of February a criminal  court was convened, in which six of the convicts received sentence of  death. One, who was the head of the gang, was executed the same day; of  the rest, one was pardoned; the other four were reprieved, and afterwards  exiled to a small island within the bay, where they were kept on bread  and water. These men had frequently robbed the stores, and the other  convicts. He who suffered, and two others, had been detected in stealing  from the stores the very day that they had received a week's provision;  at a time when their allowance, as settled by the Navy Board, was the  same as that of the soldiers, spirituous liquors excepted. So inveterate  were their habits of dishonesty, that even the apparent want of a motive  could not repress them.    2 March 1788    On the 2d of March Governor Phillip went with a long boat and cutter to  examine the broken land, mentioned by Captain Cook, about eight miles to  the northward of Port Jackson, and by him named Broken Bay. This bay  proved to be very extensive. The first night they slept in the boats,  within a rocky point in the north-west part of the bay, as the natives,  though friendly, appeared to be numerous; and the next day, after passing  a bar that had only water for small vessels, they entered a very  extensive branch, from which the ebb tide came out so strong that the  boats could not row against it in the stream; and here was deep water.  This opening appeared to end in several small branches, and in a large  lagoon which could not then be examined, as there was not time to seek a  channel for the boats among the banks of sand and mud. Most of the land  in the upper part of this branch was low and full of swamps. Pelicans and  various other birds were here seen in great numbers. Among the rest an  uncommon kind, called then the Hooded Gull, and supposed to be a non  descript; but it appears from a drawing sent to England, a plate from  which is here inserted, to be of that species called by Mr. Latham the  Caspian Tern, and is described by him as the second variety of that  species.*    [* Latham's Synopsis of Birds, vol. vi. p. 351.]    Leaving this north-west branch they proceeded across the bay, and went  into the south-west branch. This is also very extensive; and from it runs  a second opening to the westward, affording shelter for almost any number  of ships. In this part, as far as could then be examined, there is water  for vessels of the greatest burthen, the soundings being at the entrance  seven fathoms, and in going up still more. Continual rains prevented them  from taking a survey. The land here was found much higher than at Port  Jackson, more rocky, and equally covered with timber. Large trees were  seen growing even on the summits of the mountains, which appeared  accessible only to birds. Immediately round the headland that forms the  southern entrance into the bay, there is a third branch, which Governor  Phillip thought the finest piece of water he had ever seen; and which  therefore he thought worthy to be honoured with the name of Pitt Water.  This, as well as the south-west branch, is of sufficient extent to  contain all the navy of Great Britain. But on a narrow bar which runs  across the entrance it has only eighteen feet depth at low water. Within  the bar there are from seven to fifteen fathoms. The land is not so high  in this part as in the south-west branch, and there are some good  situations where the land might be cultivated. Small springs of water  were seen in most of the coves, and three cascades falling from heights,  which the rains at that time rendered inaccessible.    In this excursion some interviews with the natives took place. When the  party first landed in Broken Bay several women came down to the beach  with the men. One of these, a young woman, was very talkative and  remarkably cheerful. This was a singular instance, for in general they  are observed on this coast to be much less cheerful than the men, and  apparently under great awe and subjection. They certainly are not treated  with much tenderness, and it is thought that they are employed chiefly in  the canoes, in which women have frequently been seen with very young  children at the breast. The lively young lady, when she joined the party  the second day in her canoe, stood up and gave a song which was far from  unpleasing. The men very readily gave their assistance to the English in  making a fire, and behaved in the most friendly manner. In a bay where  Governor Phillip and his company landed to draw the seine, a number of  the natives again came to them. It was now first observed by the Governor  that the women in general had lost two joints from the little finger of  the left hand. As these appeared to be all married women, he at first  conjectured this privation to be a part of the marriage ceremony; but  going afterwards into a hut where were several women and children, he saw  a girl of five or six years of age whose left hand was thus mutilated;  and at the same time an old woman, and another who appeared to have had  children, on both of whom all the fingers were perfect. Several instances  were afterwards observed of women with child, and of others that were  evidently wives, who had not lost the two joints, and of children from  whom they had been cut. Whatever be the occasion of this mutilation, it  is performed on females only; and considering the imperfection of their  instruments, must be a very painful operation. Nothing has been seen in  the possession of these people that is at all calculated for performing  such an amputation, except a shell fixed to a short stick, and used  generally for pointing their spears, or for separating the oysters from  the rocks. More fingers than one are never cut; and in every instance it  is the same finger that has suffered.*    [* In Patterson's Travels in Africa, lately published, we are told, that  he met with a tribe of Hottentots near Orange River, all of whom had lost  the first joint of the little finger: the reason they gave for cutting it  off was, that it was a cure for a particular sickness to which they were  subject when young. Fourth Journey, p. 117. It would be a curious  coincidence of customs should it be discovered that the natives of New  Holland do it for any similar reason.]    The men are distinguished in a different manner: their fingers are not  mutilated, but most of them, as other voyagers have observed, want the  right front tooth in the upper jaw. Governor Phillip having remarked  this, pointed out to them that he had himself lost one of his front  teeth, which occasioned a general clamour; and it was thought he derived  some merit in their opinion from this circumstance. The perforation of  the cartilage that divides the nostrils, and the strange disfiguring  ornament of a long bone or stick thrust through it, was now observed, as  described by Captain Cook; and the same appellation of sprit-sail yard,  was ludicrously applied to it by the sailors. But several very old men  were seen in this excursion who had not lost the tooth, nor had their  noses prepared to receive that grotesque appendage: probably, therefore,  these are marks of distinction: ambition must have its badges, and where  cloaths are not worn, the body itself must be compelled to bear them.    Whether the scars raised upon the skin were of this kind, or as Captain  Cook understood by their signs, marks of sorrow for deceased friends,  could not now be learnt. They are of a very singular nature: sometimes  the skin is raised from the flesh for several inches, appearing as if it  were filled with wind, and forming a round surface of more than a quarter  of an inch diameter. Their bodies are scarred in various parts,  particularly about the breast and arms, and frequently on the instep. Nor  does the head always escape; one man in particular, putting aside the  hair on the forepart of his head, showed a scar, and then pointing to one  on the foot, and to others on different parts of the body, seemed to  intimate that he thought himself much honoured by having these marks upon  him from head to foot. The women did not appear equally forward to  produce the mutilated finger; nor was it always possible to ascertain  whether they had lost the joints or not. For though they made no attempt  to secrete themselves, nor seemed impressed with any idea that one part  of the body more requires concealment than another, yet there was a  shyness and timidity among them which frequently kept them at a distance.  They never would approach so readily as the men, and sometimes would not  even land from their canoes, but made signs that what was offered should  be given to the men. We are not yet enough acquainted with the manners of  the people to decide whether this reserve proceeds from the fears of the  women, or from the jealousy of their husbands, by whom they are evidently  kept in great subordination.    One of their modes of fishing was now observed: their hooks are made of  the inside of a shell resembling mother of pearl. When a fish which has  taken the bait is supposed to be too strong to be landed with the line,  the canoe is paddled to shore, and while one man gently draws the fish  along, another stands prepared to strike it with a spear: in this attempt  they seldom fail. In the plate which represents this action, the engraver  has inadvertently left the bodies of the figures rather too white; in  other respects it is very accurate.    When the southern branch of Broken Bay was first visited, the getting  round the headland that separates the branches, was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15106"],[0,"Origin of the Anglo-Boer War Revealed (2nd ed.) (#14)"],[1,"same evening and on the very next and  succeeding days appeared, published all over the Orange Free State and  the Transvaal, \"Government Gazettes extraordinary,\" filling scores of  pages, comprising proclamations of martial law, and the hundred and one  enactments and provisions regulating that new condition. Their preambles  stated: Whereas in secret session on such and such dates (that is to  say, months previous) the honourable First Volksraad had passed this or  that law--or whereas the two Volksraads, assembled in secret session,  had authorized the Government to frame such and such laws, to come into  force immediately after publication. This shows at least a studious  purpose months beforehand to be in complete readiness, for it obviously  took no little time to prepare all those laws, and have them ready in  type for despatch and publication as had been done. It accords with the  assumption that war had been predetermined, and this is further  confirmed by numerous statements, publicly made by Volksraad members,  and also by President Steyn's famous and now historic message to  President Krueger some short time before, in the laconic and oracular  words, \"We are ready.\"    That the Afrikaner Bond had been for years past preparing for its _coup  d'etat_ is further shown by the following incidents which can be  substantiated by the writer:--    During the days of the Jameson raid a very prominent Transvaal Boer,  holding office and who had two sons at the scene of the disturbance,  remarked at a public place in conversation with other burghers:--    \"England just wants to annex the Transvaal, and no doubt the Orange Free  State too. This we know; but what she does not know is, that we can at  this moment reverse the tale--we can seize in one day Cape Town, Port  Elizabeth, East London, and Durban, and within a very short time turn  every Englishman out of the Colonies, out of the land which England has  robbed us of.\"    Those words were spoken by a Bond man who is known to rarely speak in  public. When asked by a Uitlander how it could be done, he relapsed into  his usual prudent reticence, and merely remarked grimly, \"We can do it.\"    But for subsequent revelations and the present sequel those words would  have been forgotten, and were at the time attributed by some to mere  boastful exuberance.    In July last the topic was discussed by some Boers at the house of a  highly placed military official, about the five per cent. tax upon the  profits of the gold industry. One said it should be raised to  twenty-five per cent. for the benefit of the burgher estate. That  official, who, by the way, had just returned from a gathering of country  officials at Pretoria, sententiously replied \"that it was no more a  question of any tribute, but of taking the mines altogether out of the  capitalists' hands\"; and when another burgher interposed a doubt as to  the fairness of such a proceeding, that official continued by saying,  \"Fairness indeed! it is we who have submitted to unfairness only too  long--_ons wil nou Engelse schiet_ (we want now to go on the battue of  Englishmen).\"    When the Transvaal Government had secured the assent of both Volksraads  to the seven years' franchise measure it was thought desirable, as a  matter of form and to gain time, to defer the formal passing of the law  until after it had been referred to the burghers. This was not done till  August last. A large section of the people were known to be against  extending the franchise, but the Government had no misgivings about the  result, counting upon the persuasive influence of the Volksraad members  who were to preside at the plebiscite meetings, and had before been  drilled up to their task. Their success was as desired, and the measure  became law in due course. Those meetings in the different districts and  wards of the State were characterised by almost uniform proceedings, so  that the description of one of them can serve for all.    The burghers assembled on the appointed day at the local Government  Office. The Landdrost, or chief official of the ward, took the chair.  There were four Volksraad members, who each in turn recommended the  adoption of the seven years' franchise measure. The burghers were  invited to express their views. The majority appeared dead against it,  but were gradually appeased, and they finally assented to a motion of  approval presented by the chairman, which also conveyed full confidence  in the Government and their representatives to deal with the enactment  and to modify it as they might consider appropriate.    One of the burghers had in his speech stated in passionate terms that no  dictation on the part of Uitlanders could be tolerated; they must either  obey the laws or leave the State. The function and prerogative of making  laws belonged to the burghers. They had been ill-used enough by the  English; it would be still worse, he said, if they were invested with  legislative rights. \"On the contrary, it is the Boer nation which is  entitled to supremacy, not only in the Transvaal but right to the sea.  The Cape Colonies,\" he continued, \"are ours by divine right, and so is  Natal, and no Afrikaner may rest until we are reinstated.\" General  approbation and stamping of feet followed that passionately rendered  speech. Not a word of restraint or censure from any of the four  Volksraad members. Some of these had addressed the meeting already, and  the others in turn followed. Their speeches had one import, viz.,  \"Burghers! The Government and the two Volksraads have carefully and  prayerfully weighed this seven years' franchise measure. You may safely  approve of it; it can result in no harm; it will strengthen our cause.  We know that England wants our land because of the gold in it; but this  law will contribute to thwart her, though it will not avert war. We were  a small nation when our fathers trekked to this side of the Orange  River; we have become united and strong since. It will be soon seen that  our people have to be reckoned with among the other nations of the  earth; we have right on our side, and, with God's help, we are certain  to prevail. Burghers, you may trust us as your representatives; we are  all of one mind with you; you may safely approve of the proposed  franchise law, and leave possible modifications in the hands of the  Government.\" Then followed tumultuous approval from the great majority,  motions of confidence and of thanks. Those burgher meetings were  convened during July and August.           *       *       *       *       *    President Krueger is famous for employing clever and original similes in  order to illustrate a policy as he wants his people to understand it.    It has already been noted that the Franchise Law of 1890 excluded  Uitlanders from full burgher rights until after twenty-one years'  probation. The reduction to seven years was proclaimed to be a  concession to meet Mr. Chamberlain's demand. The simile, as addressed to  the Volksraad and published in the journals, ran as follows:--    \"First my coat was demanded of me, which I gave; next were asked my  boots, vest, and trousers. I surrendered these as well; and now, as I  stand in my bare shirt, my limbs are wanted besides.\"    The people were thus led to be unanimous in the resolve to oppose any  further concession, and to view Sir Alfred Milner's unconditional  insistence for a five years' franchise as a conclusive proof that  England in reality wanted no less than the country itself. In this way  the Boer mind was designedly fashioned into the conviction that war was  inevitable, and that both President and people were absolved from all  responsibility in it. Had the offered franchise of seven years and the  subsequent one of five years been honestly meant, there should, indeed,  have been little difficulty for adjusting in the one case the difference  of two years; but it being so surrounded by impossible trammels that  what purported to be an egg proved more like a stone, and even that was  not intended to be given, it was a mere subterfuge to gain time for  carrying out Bond designs.          ALLIANCE OF ORANGE FREE STATE WITH TRANSVAAL--SUZERAINTY  SQUABBLE--ARMAMENTS BEFORE JAMESON RAID      The project of alliance between the Transvaal and the Orange Free State  had been mooted before 1890. After that came conferences between the  respective Presidents and delegates for closer union as it was then  styled. Mr. John G. Fraser, one of the noblest and most distinguished  Orange Free State statesmen, was conspicuous among the few opponents.  His arguments against federation were so logical and conclusive that it  seemed for a while that the idea would have to be renounced. Among other  grounds adduced against that alliance was the fact that England  possessed claims of suzerainty over the Transvaal, and, the Orange Free  State itself being entirely independent, the incongruity and  incompatibility were obvious of joining a vassal State. There was  trouble if not danger lurking behind it, if such two States were to join  in an actual federation. Whatever was desirable for mutual advantage  might be attained without offensive and defensive alliance. The two  Governments, however, knew how to manipulate matters. The closer union  scheme was carried through before the Jameson incursion, and soon after  that event an offensive and defensive alliance completed the federation.  The Afrikaner Bond then had advanced another important stage.    Mr. John G. Fraser's persistent objections to federation, upon the  ground that the Transvaal stood under British suzerainty, had given that  question a prominence operating against the Afrikaner Bond project,  viz., that of gaining a strong Power as ally to its cause. It was felt  that no Power could, with decency, enter into a connection with that  State while such a claim was maintained. To overcome that obstacle the  Transvaal Government proceeded to"]]]
