Year in and year out every singer and pupil must practise it  in daily exercises as much as possible, on every tone of the vocal  compass.    In the lowest as well as in the highest range the sharpness of the  _a_ is lost, as well as the clear definition of all single vowels. _A_  should be mingled with _oo_, _ah_, and _e_. In the highest range, the  vowels are merged in each other, because then the principal thing is  not the vowel, but the high sound.    Even the _thought_ of _[=a]_ and _[=e]_, the latter especially, raises  the pitch of the tone. The explanation of this is that _[=a]_ and  _[=e]_ possess sympathetic sounds above the palate that lead the  breath to the resonance of the head cavities.    For this reason tenors often, in high notes, resort to the device of  changing words with dark vowels to words with the bright vowel _e_.  They could attain the same end, without changing the whole word, by  simply _thinking_ of an _e_.    [Illustration: Pronounce in English [=a] [=e] ueoo oah[=e]]    Without over-exertion, the singer can practise the exercises given  above twenty times a day, in periods of ten to fifteen minutes each,  and will soon appreciate the advantage of the muscular strengthening  they give. They make the voice fresh, not weary, as doubtless many  will suppose.    What, then, can be expected of an untrained organ? Nothing!    Without daily vocal gymnastics no power of endurance in the muscles  can be gained. They must be so strong that a great operatic role can  be repeated ten times in succession, in order that the singer may  become able to endure the strain of singing in opera houses, in great  auditoriums, and make himself heard above a great orchestra, without  suffering for it.    When I, for instance, was learning the part of _Isolde_, I could  without weariness sing the first act alone six times in succession,  with expression, action, and a full voice. That was my practice with  all my roles. After I had rehearsed a role a thousand times in my own  room, I would go into the empty theatre and rehearse single scenes, as  well as the whole opera, for hours at a time. That gave me the  certainty of being mistress of my resonances down to the last note;  and very often I felt able to begin it all over again. So must it be,  if one wishes to accomplish anything worth while.    Another end also is attained by the same exercise,--the connection,  not only of the vowels, but of all letters, syllables, words, and  phrases. By this exercise the form for the breath, tone, and word, in  which all the organs are adjusted to each other with perfect  elasticity, is gradually established. Slowly but surely it assures  greatest endurance in all the organs concerned in speaking and  singing, the inseparable connection of the palatal resonance with the  resonance of the head cavities. In this way is gained perfection in  the art of singing, which is based, not on chance, but on knowledge;  and this slow but sure way is the only way to gain it.    By the above-described method all other alphabetical sounds can be  connected, and exercises can be invented to use with it, which are  best adapted to correct the mistakes of pupils, at first on one, then  step by step on two and three connected tones, etc.    At the same time it is necessary to learn to move the tongue freely,  and with the utmost quickness, by jerking it back, after pronouncing  consonants, as quick as a flash, into the position in which it  conducts the breath to the resonating chambers for the vowels. With  all these movements is connected the power of elastically contracting  and relaxing the muscles.          SECTION XXVI    THE LIPS      Of special importance for the tone and the word are the movements of  the lips, which are so widely different in the bright and in the dark  vowels. These movements cannot be too much exaggerated in practising.  The same strength and elasticity to which we have to train the muscles  of the throat and tongue must be imparted to the lips, which must be  as of iron. Upon their cooeperation much of the life of the tone  depends, and it can be used in many shadings, as soon as one is able  to exert their power consciously and under the control of the will.    Every vowel, every word, every tone, can be colored as by magic in all  sorts of ways by the well-controlled play of the lips; can, as it  were, be imbued with life, as the lips open or close more or less in  different positions. The lips are the final cup-shaped resonators  through which the tone has to pass. They can retard it or let it  escape, can color it bright or dark, and exert a ceaseless and ever  varying influence upon it long before it ceases and up to its very  end.    No attempt should be made to use the play of the lips until complete  mastery of the absolutely even, perfect tone, and of the muscular  powers, has been acquired. The effect must be produced as a result of  power and practice; and should not be practised as an effect _per  se_.          SECTION XXVII    THE VOWEL-SOUND _AH_      There is much discussion as to whether _ah_, _oo_, or some other vowel  is the one best adapted for general practice. In former times practice  was entirely on the vowel-sound _ah_. The old Italians taught it; my  mother was trained so, and never allowed her pupils to use any other  vowel during the first months of their instruction. Later, to be sure,  every letter, every word, was practised and improved continually, till  it was correct, and had impressed itself upon the memory, as well as  the ear, of the pupil for all time.    I explain the matter thus:--    The singer's mouth should always make an agreeable impression. Faces  that are forever grinning or showing fish mouths are disgusting and  wrong.    The pleasing expression of the mouth requires the muscular  contractions that form the bright vowel _ah_.    Most people who are not accustomed to using their vocal resonance  pronounce the _ah_ quite flat, as if it were the vowel-sound lying  lowest. If it is pronounced with the position of the mouth belonging  to the bright vowels, it has to seek its resonance, in speaking as  well as in singing, in the same place as the dark vowels, on the  high-arched palate. To permit this, it must be mingled with _oo_. The  furrows in the tongue must also be formed, just as with _oo_ and _o_,  only special attention must be given that the back of the tongue does  not fall, but remains high, as in pronouncing _[=a]_. In this way _ah_  comes to lie between _oo-o'ah'y[=a]_, and forms at the same time the  connection between the bright and the dark vowels, and the reverse.    For this reason it was proper that _ah_ should be preferred as the  practice vowel, as soon as it was placed properly between the two  extremes, and had satisfied all demands. I prefer to teach it, because  its use makes all mistakes most clearly recognizable. It is the most  difficult vowel. If it is well pronounced, or sung, it produces the  necessary muscular contractions with a pleasing expression of the  mouth, and makes certain a fine tone color by its connection with _oo_  and _o_. If the _ah_ is equally well formed in all ranges of the  voice, a chief difficulty is mastered.    Those who have been badly taught, or have fallen into bad ways, should  practise the vocal exercise I have given above, with _ya-ye-yah_,  etc., slowly, listening to themselves carefully. Good results cannot  fail; it is an infallible means of improvement.    Italians who sing well never speak or sing the vowel sound _ah_  otherwise than mixed, and only the neglect of this mixture could have  brought about the decadence of the Italian teaching of song. In  Germany no attention is paid to it. The _ah_, as sung generally by  most Italians of the present day, quite flat, sounds commonplace,  almost like an affront. It can range itself, that is connect itself,  with no other vowel, makes all vocal connection impossible, evolves  very ugly registers; and, lying low in the throat, summons forth no  palatal resonance. The power of contraction of the muscles of speech  is insufficient, and this insufficiency misleads the singer to  constrict the throat muscles, which are not trained to the endurance  of it; thereby further progress is made impossible. In the course of  time the tone becomes flat at the transitions. The fatal tremolo is  almost always the result of this manner of singing.    Try to sing a scale upward on _ah_, placing the tongue and muscles of  speech at the same time on _[=a]_, and you will be surprised at the  agreeable effect. Even the thought of it alone is often enough,  because the tongue involuntarily takes the position of its own  accord.    I remember very well how Mme. Desiree Artot-Padilla, who had a low  mezzo-soprano voice, used to toss off great coloratura pieces,  beginning on the vowel-sound _ah_, and then going up and down on _a_,  _ee_, _aueoah_. At the time I could not understand why she did it; now  I know perfectly,--because it was easier for her. The breath is  impelled against the cavities of the head, the head tones are set into  action.    Behind the _a_ position there must be as much room provided as is  needed for all the vowels, with such modifications as each one  requires for itself. The matter of chief importance is the position of  the tongue _in_ the throat, that it shall not be in the way of the  larynx, which must be able to move up and down, even though very  slightly, without hindrance.    All vowels must be able to flow into each other; the singer must be  able to pass from one to another without perceptible alteration, and  back again.          SECTION XXVIII    ITALIAN AND GERMAN      How easy it is for the Italians, who have by nature, through the  characteristics of their native language, all these things which  others must gain by long years of practice! A "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19138"],[0,"Resonance in Singing and Speaking (#14)"],[1,"good voices. It is not a fundamental quality  of the voice. A little vibrato may occasionally be desirable when  properly and skilfully used; more than this is to be shunned as a  dangerous vice.          CHAPTER XI    THE PSYCHOLOGY OF VOCAL CULTURE      Mental conception precedes execution. The picture must exist in the  artist's mind before it can be drawn on the canvas. The architect must  mentally see the majestic cathedral in all its details before he can  draw the plans from which it can be built. In the field of physical  activity no movement is made until the mind has gone before and  prepared the way. A person's ability to do is in a great degree  measured by his determination to do, but sitting in a rocking-chair  and thinking will never make an athlete. Mental action is necessary,  but only through trained muscular action can the mental action  materialize in a finished performance.    So too the mind must anticipate the action of the vocal organs, but  the organs themselves must be led to interpret the mental concept  until such action becomes spontaneous. Action in turn quickens the  mental process, and the mental picture becomes more vivid.    Note with emphasis that the mental concept _precedes_ the action and  governs it. Therefore, instead of producing tone by local effort, by  conscious muscular action of any sort, correctly _think the tone_,  correctly shape and color it _mentally_. =Every vocal tone is a mental  concept made audible.= The beginner and the confirmed bungler alike  fail in this prime essential--they do not make this mental picture of  tone before singing it. Kindred to this is deficiency in hearing, in  discriminating between good tone color and poor. The student must  constantly compare his tone as it is sung with the picture in his  mind. Training the voice is therefore largely a training of mind and  ear, a developing of nicety in discrimination. Singing is mental  rather than physical, psychologic rather than physiologic. Think  therefore of the effect desired rather than of the process.    In considering the details of voice production analytically we are apt  to forget that man, notwithstanding his complexity, is a _unit_ and  acts as a unit. Back of all and underlying man's varied activity is  the psychical. In the advanced stages of the art of speech and song  this psychical element is of pre-eminent importance.    The speaker who essays to give expression to his own thoughts must  have his ideas sharply defined and aflame in order to so utter them  that they will arouse his hearers to enthusiasm. The speaker or singer  who would successfully interpret the thoughts of others must first  make those thoughts his very own. When this is attained, then the  voice, action, and the whole spirit of the performer, responding to  the theme, will beget a like responsiveness in his audience.      THE SINGER BEHIND THE VOICE    Books upon books have been written on voice training, and will  continue to be written. The preceding pages have been devoted to the  fundamental subject of tone production, but it is time to suggest that  back of the voice and the song is the singer himself with his complex  personality. Back of the personality is the soul itself, forever  seeking utterance through its mask of personality. All genuine impulse  to sing is from the soul in its need for expression. Through  expression comes growth in soul consciousness and desire for greater  and greater self-expression.    Singing is far more than \"wind and muscle,\" for, as Ffrangcon-Davies  puts it, \"The whole spiritual system, spirit, mind, sense, _soul_,  together with the whole muscular system from feet to head, will be in  the wise man's singing, _and the whole man will be in the tone_.\"    Of all the expressions of the human spirit in art form, the sublimated  speech we call song is the most direct. Every other art requires some  material medium for its transmission, and in music, subtlest of all  the arts, instruments are needed, except in singing only.      FREEDOM    In song the singer himself is the instrument of free and direct  expression. Freedom of expression, complete utterance, is prevented  only by the singer himself. No one hinders him, no one stands in the  way but himself. The business of the teacher is to _set free_ that  which is latent. His high calling is by wise guidance to help the  singer to get out of his own way, to cease standing in front of  himself. Technical training is not all in all. Simple recognition of  the existence of our powers is needed even more. Freedom comes through  the recognition and appropriation of inherent power; recognition comes  first, the appropriation then follows simply. The novice does not know  his natural power, his birthright, and must be helped to find it,  chiefly, however, by helping himself, by cognizing and re-cognizing  it.    No student of the most human of all arts--singing--need give up if he  has burning within him the _song impulse_, the _hunger to sing_. This  inner impulse is by its strength an evidence of the power to sing; the  very hunger is a promise and a prophecy.      DETERRENTS    The deterrents to beautiful singing are physical in appearance, but  these are outer signs of mental or emotional disturbance. Normal  poise, which is strength, smilingly expresses itself in curves, in  tones of beauty.    _Mental discord_ results in angularity, rigidity, harshness.    _Impatience_ produces feverishness that makes vocal poise impossible;  and impatience induces the modern vice of forcing the tone. Growth is  a factor for which hurried forcing methods make no allowance.    _Excess of emotion_ with its loss of balance affects the breathing and  play of the voice.    _Exertion_, trying effort, instead of easy, happy activity induces  hampering rigidities.    _Intensity_, over-concentration, or rather false concentration,  emotional tension, involves strain, and strain is always wrong.    _Over-conscientiousness_, with its fussiness about petty detail, and  insistence on non-essentials, is a deterrent from which the robust are  free. _Over-attention to the mechanics_ of voice production is a  kindred deterrent. Both deterrents prevent that prime characteristic  of expression--spontaneity.    _Anxiety_ is a great contractor of muscle, a great stiffener. Anxiety  always forgets the _power_ within, and falsely says to the  song-hunger, \"You shall never be satisfied.\"    _Self-repression_ is a great deterrent that afflicts the more  sensitive, particularly those of puritanic inheritance. It is a  devitalizer and a direct negative to expression, which is vital, is  _life_.    All of these deterrents are negative and may be overcome by fuller  recognition of the inner power that by its very nature must  perpetually seek positive expression.      CONCLUSION    In conclusion, the student can perpetually find encouragement in a  number of happy facts.    Man is endowed by nature, except in rare instances, with a perfect  vocal apparatus. When abnormal conditions are found they are usually  in the adult voice, and are due solely to misuse. In other words  defects are not inherent but acquired and _can be removed_.    By nature the human voice is beautiful, for the tendency of nature is  always in the direction of beauty. Whatever is unlovely in singing, as  in all else, is _un_natural. True method is therefore never artificial  in its action, but simple, because the natural is always simple.    Finally, no, not finally, but firstly and secondly and thirdly and  perpetually, every student of singing and every teacher of it must  constantly bear in mind the happy law:    =THE RIGHT WAY IS ALWAYS AN EASY WAY=          BOOKS CONSULTED      TITLE                           AUTHOR                   PUBLISHED    An Essay on the History  and Theory of Music, and  of the Qualities and Capacity  of the Human Voice              Isaac Nathan             London, 1823.
