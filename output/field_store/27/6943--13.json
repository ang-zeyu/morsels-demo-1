Seven children, all of whom are girls, are  boarded on the premises, and are being brought up as Christians. They  are pretty, bright children, the eldest, a girl of fourteen,  particularly so. All are large-footed, and they are to be married to  Christian converts. When this fact becomes known it is hoped that more  young Chinamen than at present may be emulous to be converted. All seven  are foundlings from Chungking where, wrapped in brown paper, they were  at different times dropped over the wall into the Mission compound. They  have been carefully reared by the Mission.    At the boys' school fifty smart boys, all heathens, were at their  lessons. They were learning different subjects, and were teaching their  ears the \"tones\" by reading at the top of their voices. The noise was  awful. None but a Chinese boy could study in such a din. In China, when  the lesson is finished, the class is silent; noise, therefore, is the  indication of work in a Chinese school--not silence.    The schoolmaster was a ragged-looking loafer, dressed in grey. He was  in mourning, and had been unshaven for forty-two days in consequence of  the death of his father. This was an important day of mourning, because  on this day, the forty-second after his death, his dead father became,  for the first time, aware of his own decease. A week later, on the  forty-ninth day, the funeral rites would cease.          CHAPTER VII.    SUIFU TO CHAOTONG, WITH SOME REMARKS ON THE PROVINCE OF YUNNAN--CHINESE  PORTERS, POSTAL ARRANGEMENTS, AND BANKS.      I engaged three new men in Suifu, who undertook to take me to Chaotong,  290 miles, in thirteen days, special inducement being held out to them  in the shape of a reward of one shilling each to do the journey in  eleven days. Their pay was to be seven shillings and threepence each,  apart from the bonus, and of course they had to find themselves. They  brought me from the coolie-hong, where they were engaged, an agreement  signed by the hong-master, which was to be returned to them in Chaotong,  and remitted to their master as a receipt for my safe delivery.    Every condition detailed in the agreement they faithfully carried out,  and they took me to Chaotong in ten days and a half, though the ordinary  time is fourteen days.    One of the three was a convert, one of the six surviving converts made  by the aggregate Inland Mission of Suifu in six years. He was an  excellent good fellow, rather dull of wits, but a credit to the Mission.  To him was intrusted the paying away of my money--he carried no load.  When he wanted money he was to show me his empty hands, and say \"_Muta  tsien! muta tsien!_\" (I have no money! I have no money!).    I knew that perfect confidence could be placed in the convert, apart  from the reason of his conversion, because he had a father living in  Suifu. Were he to rob me or do me a wrong and run away, we could arrest  his father and have him detained in the yamen prison till his son  returned. Nothing in China gives one greater protection against fraud  and injury than the law which holds a father responsible for the  wrongdoing of his son, or, where there is no father, an elder son  culpable for the misdeed of the younger.    On the morning of March 22nd we started for Chaotong in Yunnan province.  The Inland Missionary and a Brother from the American Baptist Mission  kindly came with me for the first thirteen miles. My route lay west on  the north bank of the Yangtse, but later, after crossing the Yangtse,  would be nearly south to Chaotong.    Shortly before leaving, the _chairen_ or yamen-runner--the policeman,  that is to say--sent by the Magistrate to shadow me to Tak-wan-hsien,  called at the Mission to request that the interpreter would kindly  remind the traveller, who did not speak Chinese, that it was customary  to give wine-money to the chairen at the end of the journey. The request  was reasonable. All the way from Chungking I had been accompanied by  yamen-runners without knowing it. The chairen is sent partly for the  protection of the traveller, but mainly for the protection of the  Magistrate; for, should a traveller provided with a passport receive any  injury, the Magistrate of the district would be liable to degradation.  It was arranged, therefore, with the convert that, on our arrival in  Tak-wan-hsien, I was to give the chairen, if satisfied with his  services, 200 cash (five pence); but, if he said \"_gowshun! gowshun!_\"  (a little more! a little more!) with sufficient persistence, I was to  increase the reward gradually to sevenpence halfpenny. This was to be  the limit; and the chairen, I was assured, would consider this a  generous return for accompanying me 227 miles over one of the most  mountainous roads in China.    It was a pleasant walk along the river-bank in the fertile alluvial,  where the poppy in white flower and tobacco were growing, and where  fields of yellow rape-seed alternated with beds of rushes--the rape-seed  yielding the oil, and the rushes the rushlights of Chinese lamps. Flocks  of wild geese were within easy shot on the sandbanks--the \"peaceful  geese,\" whose virtues are extolled by every Chinaman. They live in  pairs, and, if one dies, its mate will be for ever faithful to its  memory. Such virtue is worthy of being recorded on the arch which here  spans the roadway, whose Chinese characters, _Shen_ (holy), _Chi_  (will), show that it was erected by the holy decree of the Emperor to  perpetuate the memory of some widow who never remarried.    As we walked along the missionary gave instructions to my men. \"In my  grace I had given them very light loads; hurry and they would be richly  rewarded\"--one shilling extra for doing fourteen stages in eleven days.    At an inn, under the branches of a banyan tree, we sat down and had a  cup of tea. While we waited, a hawker came and sat near us. He was  peddling live cats. In one of his two baskets was a cat that bore a  curious resemblance to a tortoise-shell tabby, that till a week ago had  been a pet in the Inland Mission. It had disappeared mysteriously; it  had died, the Chinese servant said; and here it was reincarnated.    At the market town the missionaries left me to go on alone with my three  men. I had seventeen miles still to go before night.    It was midday, and the sun was hot, so a chair was arranged for to take  me the seventeen miles to Anpien. It was to cost 320 cash (eightpence),  but, just before leaving, the grasping coolies refused to carry me for  less than 340 cash. \"Walk on,\" said the missionary, \"and teach them a  Christian lesson,\" so I walked seventeen miles in the sun to rebuke them  for their avarice and save one halfpenny. In the evening I am afraid  that I was hardly in the frame of mind requisite for conducting an  evangelical meeting.    Anpien is a considerable town. It is on the Yangtse River just below  where it bifurcates into two rivers, one of which goes north-west, the  other south-west. Streets of temporary houses are built down by the  river; they form the winter suburb, and disappear in the summer when the  river rises in consequence of the melting of the snows in its mountain  sources. At an excellent inn, with a noisy restaurant on the first  floor, good accommodation was given me. No sooner was I seated than a  chairen came from the yamen to ask for my Chinese visiting card; but he  did not ask for my passport, though I had brought with me twenty-five  copies besides the original.    At daybreak a chair was ready, and I was carried to the River, where a  ferry boat was in waiting to take us across below the junction. Then we  started on our journey towards the south, along the right bank of the  Laowatan branch of the Yangtse. The road was a tracking path cut into  the face of the cliff; it was narrow, steep, winding, and slippery.  There was only just room for the chair to pass, and at the sudden turns  it had often to be canted to one side to permit of its passage. We were  high above the river in the mountain gorges. The comfort of the  traveller in a chair along this road depends entirely upon the sureness  of foot of his two bearers--a false step, and chair and traveller would  tumble down the cliff into the foaming river below. Deep and narrow was  the mountain river, and it roared like a cataract, yet down the passage  a long narrow junk, swarming with passengers, was racing, its oars and  bow-sweep worked by a score of sailors singing in chorus. The boat  appeared, passed down the reach, and was out of sight in a moment; a  single error, the slightest confusion, and it would have been smashed in  fragments on the rocks and the river strewn with corpses.    We did a good stage before breakfast. Every few li where the steepness  of the valley side permits it, there are straw-thatched, bamboo and  plaster inns. Here rice is kept in wooden bins all ready steaming hot  for the use of travellers; good tea is brewed in a few minutes; the  tables and chopsticks are sufficiently clean.    Leaving the river, we crossed over the mountains by a short cut to the  river again, and at a wayside inn, much frequented by Chinese, the chair  stage finished. I wished to do some writing, and sat down at one of the  tables. A crowd gathered round me, and were much interested. One elderly  Chinese with huge glasses, a wag in his own way, seeing that I did not  speak Chinese, thought to make me understand and divert the crowd by the  loudness of his speech, and, insisting that I was deaf, yelled into my  ears in tones that shook the tympanum. I told the foolish fellow, in  English, that the less he talked the better I could understand him; but  he persisted, and poked his face almost into mine, but withdrew it and  hobbled off in umbrage when I drew the attention of the bystanders to  the absurd capacity of his mouth, which was larger than any mule's.    I must "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19180"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XXIV., No. 12,  March 18, 1871 (#14)"],[1,"account.    A neat and ingenious instrument has been constructed for determining  the variation of the plummet, and will be used when great accuracy is  desired; the plummet will also be suspended in oil.    The bearing of the tunnel is about S. 81 deg. E.; but, independently of  its near approach to the line of revolution described by the earth,  it is not considered necessary to take into account any motion it may  derive from this cause. In fact, the opinion is, that the motion of  the earth will not practically have any effect.    On the whole, after the still imperfect experiments which have been  made, enough is established to show there is no difficulty to be  encountered, other than the accurate and delicate manipulation of the  plummet and its attachments.    The shaft headings are progressing favorably. The rock is not so hard  or varied as that met with at the west end markings. Already nearly  300 feet have been taken out, and with the proved energy of the  contractors, this great task will doubtless be prosecuted steadily and  surely to completion, within the contract time expiring March 1, 1874.           *       *       *       *       *          A MUSEUM OF ART AND NATURAL HISTORY.      Our recent articles on \"Scientific Destitution in New York\" and \"The  Scientific Value of the Central Park,\" have called forth numerous  letters from correspondents, and have been extensively noticed by the  press. We now learn that the legislature of the State has taken  the matter in hand, and there is some prospect, with an honest  administration of the appropriations, of something being done to  relieve our city of the opprobrium that rests upon it. A bill is  pending, before the Senate, authorizing the Park Commissioners to  build, equip, and furnish, on Manhattan Square, or any other public  square or park, suitable fire-proof buildings, at a cost not exceeding  $500,000 for each corporation, for the purpose of establishing a  museum of art, by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and of a museum  of natural history, by the American Museum of Natural History, two  societies recently incorporated by the Legislature. This is a million  dollars to begin with, and an ample site, without cost, to the  aforementioned corporations.    Manhattan Square extends from Seventy-seventh to Eighty-first streets,  and from Eighth to Ninth avenues, and spans about eighteen acres.  Until it was set apart by the state Board of Commissioners, for the  purposes of a Zoological Garden, it was proposed, by a number of  enlightened citizens of New York, to devote it to the uses of four of  our existing corporations, giving to each one a corner, and an equal  share in the allotment of space. The societies were, \"the Academy of  Design,\" for art, \"the Historical Society,\" for public records and  libraries, \"the Lyceum of Natural History,\" for science, and \"the  American Institute,\" for technology. These have been incorporated  for many years, and are known to include the leading artists, men  of letters, science, and the arts, of the city, on their lists of  members. The committee went so far as to have plans of the building  drawn by competent architects; but, like many other well-meant  schemes, want of money compelled the originators of the plan to  abandon any further attempts. In the meantime, the Legislature  chartered the American Botanical and Zoological Society, and gave the  Commissioners of the Park authority to set apart a portion of it,  not exceeding sixty acres, for the use of the Society, for the  establishment of a zoological and botanical garden. This society  was duly organized under the act, and Mr. Hamilton Fish was made  its president, and considerable sums of money were subscribed. But,  according to the sixth annual report of the Board of Commissioners,  \"the society never manifested its desire for an allotment of ground.\"  It appears to have died, and made no sign. Some of our citizens,  fearing that the Central Park would go the way of every other public  work in the city, made strenuous effort to revive the Zoological  Society, for the purpose of obtaining a perpetual lease of a suitable  site, on which to establish a zoological garden, similar to those in  London, Paris, Amsterdam, and Cologne. Their object was to remove this  part of the Park beyond the reach of political intrigue. Subsequent  events have shown that the fears of these gentlemen were well founded.  The Legislature of the State, on the 25th of March, 1862, gave ample  powers to the New York Historical Society to establish a Museum of  Antiquity and Science, and a Gallery of Art, in the Central Park.  They have submitted designs for a building, but, for some reason, no  decisive steps have been taken towards its construction.    The Lyceum of Natural History was also negotiating with the  Commissioners, for the use of the upper rooms of the arsenal for its  collections, and there is no doubt that an arrangement to this  effect would have been made, if a fire had not destroyed the entire  collections of the Lyceum. The Lyceum made great effort to raise money  to purchase a new collection, but without avail; and, although this  is the oldest scientific society in New York, and has inrolled in its  list of members, nearly every professional scientist of the city, it  is probably the poorest, in income and resources, of any academy of  sciences in the world. We do not know that the Academy of Design has  ever applied for a home in the Central Park; and we cannot speak for  the American Institute, nor for the Geographical Society, in this  particular. As we stated in our former article, the old Board of  Commissioners appears to have become weary of the unsuccessful  attempts on the part of numerous societies to divide up and apportion  the Central Park, and they applied to the Legislature for authority to  conduct matters in their own way. An act was duly passed, authorizing  the Board \"to erect, establish, conduct, and maintain, on the Central  Park, a Meteorological and Astronomical Observatory, a Museum of  Natural History, and a Gallery of Art, and the buildings therefor, and  to provide the necessary instruments, furniture, and equipments for  the same.\"    Here would seem to be ample power for the establishment of museums of  science and art, but nothing is said about the manner of raising the  money. One would suppose, however, that, by means of the \"Central Park  Improvement Fund,\" abundant means could have been raised. The bill  now before the Legislature puts matters in a new light. If it does not  conflict with previous enactments, nor destroy vested rights, it has  the appearance of being a thoroughly practical way of solving the  question of art and science for the city. The Metropolitan Museum of  Art and the American Museum of Natural History are in the hands of  the most respectable citizens of New York. It would not be possible to  find a body of men of more unimpeachable integrity and greater  worth, than the gentlemen who have founded these two societies. It is  impossible that they should lend their names to anything that will  not bear the closest scrutiny; hence the proposition, now before the  Legislature, to put up buildings for them, at a cost of a million  dollars, must attract unusual attention. If the State would  appropriate the money to these corporations, giving them the control  of its expenditure, we should have considerably more confidence in its  honest administration than, we are grieved to say, we can feel under  the present circumstances; and if we knew what other institutions  are to have the remaining portions of Manhattan Square, it would be a  great relief to our minds.    \"We fear the Greeks bringing gifts,\" but are willing to accept the  gifts, if the officers of the two organizations are certain that it is  all right.    The need of a Museum of Natural History, and of a Gallery of Art, in  New York, is so pressing that there is some danger of our accepting  the appropriations without a proper regard to consequences. The Court  House is not yet finished, and the foundations of the Post-office are  scarcely laid.           *       *       *       *       *          REPORT OF THE JUDGES OF GROUP 1, DEPARTMENT V. OF THE EXHIBITION OF  THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR 1870. THE ALLEN ENGINE.      The labors of the judges in this department were much lighter in the  last exhibition than in the preceding one, and we are happy to say,  were, in our opinion, so far as the award of premiums is concerned,  much more fairly performed. The award of two first premiums to two  competing engines could scarcely be repeated this time, as there was  in reality no competition. The Allen engine was the only important  one entered, and of course received the first premium. The engine is,  however, one that evidently could have competed favorably with those  previously exhibited.    We are in receipt of advanced sheets of the judges' report pertaining  to the critical examination of this engine, being a record and account  of experiments performed under the supervision of Washington Lee, C. E.  The experiments were very comprehensive, and comprised approved tests,  of each important detail, usually made by expert engineers.    The report is too voluminous for reprint or even for condensation  in our columns. In looking it through, we are satisfied that the  experiments were accurately made, and that the engine exhibited great  working efficiency and economy.    As the engine has been recently illustrated and described in our  columns, we deem it unnecessary to dwell upon the details of its  construction. The water test of the previous exhibition was employed,  the water being this time measured, with indisputable accuracy, in a  tank, instead of by a meter as before.    The voluminous comparison of this engine with those previously  exhibited, seems unnecessary, and we think not in good taste in such a  report, however much it may "]]]
