At his bedside, day and night, Slavery looked more heinous than it had  ever done before. Only think how this poor man, in an enlightened  Christian land, for the bare hope of freedom, in a strange land amongst  strangers, was obliged not only to bear the sacrifice of his wife and  kindred, but also of his own life.    Nothing ever appeared more sad than seeing him in a dying posture, and  instead of reaching his much coveted destination in Canada, going to  that \"bourne whence no traveler returns.\" Of course it was expedient,  even after his death, that only a few friends should follow him to his  grave. Nevertheless, he was decently buried in the beautiful Lebanon  Cemetery.    In his purse was found one single five cent piece, his whole pecuniary  dependence.    This was the first instance of death on the Underground Rail Road in  this region.    The Committee were indebted to the medical services of the well-known  friends of the fugitive, Drs. J.L. Griscom and H.T. Childs, whose  faithful services were freely given; and likewise to Mrs. H.S. Duterte  and Mrs. Williams, who generously performed the offices of charity and  friendship at his burial.    From his companion, who passed on Canada-ward without delay, we received  a letter, from which, as an item of interest, we make the following  extract:          \"I am enjoying good health, and hope when this reaches you, you      may be enjoying the same blessing. Give my love to Mr. ----, and      family, and tell them I am in a land of liberty! I am a man      among men!\" (The above was addressed to the deceased.)      The subjoined letter, from Rev. L.D. Mansfield, expressed on behalf of  Romulus' companion, his sad feelings on hearing of his friend's death.  And here it may not be inappropriate to add, that clearly enough is it  to be seen, that Rev. Mansfield was one of the rare order of ministers,  who believed it right \"to do unto others as one would be done by\" in  practice, not in theory merely, and who felt that they could no more be  excused for \"falling down,\" in obedience to the Fugitive Slave Law under  President Fillmore, than could Daniel for worshiping the \"golden image\"  under Nebuchadnezzar.          AUBURN, NEW YORK, MAY 4TH, 1857.        DEAR BR. STILL:--Henry Lemmon wishes me to write to you in reply      to your kind letter, conveying the intelligence of the death of      your fugitive guest, Geo. Weems. He was deeply affected at the      intelligence, for he was most devotedly attached to him and had      been for many years. Mr. Lemmon now expects his sister to come      on, and wishes you to aid her in any way in your power--as he      knows you will.        He wishes you to send the coat and cap of Weems by his sister      when she comes. And when you write out the history of Weems'      escape, and it is published, that you would send him a copy of      the papers. He has not been very successful in getting work yet.        Mr. and Mrs. Harris left for Canada last week. The friends made      them a purse of $15 or $20, and we hope they will do well.        Mr. Lemmon sends his respects to you and Mrs. Still. Give my      kind regards to her and accept also yourself,        Yours very truly,        L.D. MANSFIELD.               *       *       *       *       *          JAMES MERCER, WM. H. GILLIAM, AND JOHN CLAYTON.      STOWED AWAY IN A HOT BERTH.      This arrival came by Steamer. But they neither came in State-room nor as  Cabin, Steerage, or Deck passengers.    A certain space, not far from the boiler, where the heat and coal dust  were almost intolerable,--the colored steward on the boat in answer to  an appeal from these unhappy bondmen, could point to no other place for  concealment but this. Nor was he at all certain that they could endure  the intense heat of that place. It admitted of no other posture than  lying flat down, wholly shut out from the light, and nearly in the same  predicament in regard to the air. Here, however, was a chance of  throwing off the yoke, even if it cost them their lives. They considered  and resolved to try it at all hazards.    Henry Box Brown's sufferings were nothing, compared to what these men  submitted to during the entire journey.    They reached the house of one of the Committee about three o'clock, A.M.    All the way from the wharf the cold rain poured down in torrents and  they got completely drenched, but their hearts were swelling with joy  and gladness unutterable. From the thick coating of coal dust, and the  effect of the rain added thereto, all traces of natural appearance were  entirely obliterated, and they looked frightful in the extreme. But they  had placed their lives in mortal peril for freedom.    Every step of their critical journey was reviewed and commented on, with  matchless natural eloquence,--how, when almost on the eve of suffocating  in their warm berths, in order to catch a breath of air, they were  compelled to crawl, one at a time, to a small aperture; but scarcely  would one poor fellow pass three minutes being thus refreshed, ere the  others would insist that he should \"go back to his hole.\" Air was  precious, but for the time being they valued their liberty at still  greater price.    After they had talked to their hearts' content, and after they had been  thoroughly cleansed and changed in apparel, their physical appearance  could be easily discerned, which made it less a wonder whence such  outbursts of eloquence had emanated. They bore every mark of determined  manhood.    The date of this arrival was February 26, 1854, and the following  description was then recorded--    Arrived, by Steamer Pennsylvania, James Mercer, William H. Gilliam and  John Clayton, from Richmond.    James was owned by the widow, Mrs. T.E. White. He is thirty-two years of  age, of dark complexion, well made, good-looking, reads and writes, is  very fluent in speech, and remarkably intelligent. From a boy, he had  been hired out. The last place he had the honor to fill before escaping,  was with Messrs. Williams and Brother, wholesale commission merchants.  For his services in this store the widow had been drawing one hundred  and twenty-five dollars per annum, clear of all expenses.    He did not complain of bad treatment from his mistress, indeed, he spoke  rather favorably of her. But he could not close his eyes to the fact,  that at one time Mrs. White had been in possession of thirty head of  slaves, although at the time he was counting the cost of escaping, two  only remained--himself and William, (save a little boy) and on himself a  mortgage for seven hundred and fifty dollars was then resting. He could,  therefore, with his remarkably quick intellect, calculate about how long  it would be before he reached the auction block.    He had a wife but no child. She was owned by Mr. Henry W. Quarles. So  out of that Sodom he felt he would have to escape, even at the cost of  leaving his wife behind. Of course he felt hopeful that the way would  open by which she could escape at a future time, and so it did, as will  appear by and by. His aged mother he had to leave also.    Wm. Henry Gilliam likewise belonged to the Widow White, and he had been  hired to Messrs. White and Brother to drive their bread wagon. William  was a baker by trade. For his services his mistress had received one  hundred and thirty-five dollars per year. He thought his mistress quite  as good, if not a little better than most slave-holders. But he had  never felt persuaded to believe that she was good enough for him to  remain a slave for her support.    Indeed, he had made several unsuccessful attempts before this time to  escape from slavery and its horrors. He was fully posted from A to Z,  but in his own person he had been smart enough to escape most of the  more brutal outrages. He knew how to read and write, and in readiness of  speech and general natural ability was far above the average of slaves.    He was twenty-five years of age, well made, of light complexion, and  might be put down as a valuable piece of property.    This loss fell with crushing weight upon the kind-hearted mistress, as  will be seen in a letter subjoined which she wrote to the unfaithful  William, some time after he had fled.        LETTER FROM MRS. L.E. WHITE.            RICHMOND, 16th, 1854.        DEAR HENRY:--Your mother and myself received your letter; she is      much distressed at your conduct; she is remaining just as you      left her, she says, and she will never be reconciled to your      conduct.        I think Henry, you have acted most dishonorably; had you have      made a confidant of me I would have been better off; and you as      you are. I am badly situated, living with Mrs. Palmer, and      having to put up with everything--your mother is also      dissatisfied--I am miserably poor, do not get a cent of your      hire or James', besides losing you both, but if you can      _reconcile_ so do. By renting a cheap house, I might have lived,      now it seems starvation is before me. Martha and the Doctor are      living in Portsmouth, it is not in her power to do much for me.      I know you will repent it. I heard six weeks before you went,      that you were trying to persuade him off--but we all liked you,      and I was unwilling to believe it--however, I leave it in God's      hands He will know what to do. Your mother says that I must tell      you servant Jones is _dead_ and old _Mrs. Galt_. Kit is well,      but we are very uneasy, losing your and _James' hire_, I fear      poor little fellow, that he will be obliged to go, as I am      compelled to live, and it will be your fault. I am quite unwell,      but of course, you don't care.        Yours,        L.E. WHITE.        If you choose to come back you could. I would do a very good      part by you, Toler and Cooke has none.

Quick, Nannie, make me a big paper  lantern.\"    Well, the little goat girl stopped crying then, and she got her paper, and  her scissors, and the paste pot, and she began to make a paper lantern, as  big as a water pail. Uncle Wiggily and Billie helped her. And all the  while the burglar-fox was banging on the door, and crying out:    \"Let me in! Let me in!\"    \"Quick! is the lantern ready?\" Asked Uncle Wiggily, jumping around in a  circle like \"Ring Around the Rosie.\"    \"Here it is,\" said Nannie. So the rabbit gentleman took it, all nicely  made as it was, and inside of it he put a hot, blazing candle. And the  lantern was so big that the candle didn't burn the sides of the paper.    Then Uncle Wiggily tied the lantern to a string, and he lowered it right  down out of the window; down in front of the burglar-fox, and the hot  candle in the lantern burned the fox's nose, and he thought it was a  policeman climbing down out of a tree to catch him, and before you could  count forty-'leven the bad burglar-fox ran away, and so he didn't rob the  goats after all. And, oh! how thankful Nannie and Billie and their papa  and mamma were to Uncle Wiggily.    Now, in case the little boy next door doesn't take our clothes line, to  make a swing for his puppy dog, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the  paper house in the following story.          STORY XX    UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE PAPER HOUSE      Bright and early next morning Uncle Wiggily got up, and he took a careful  look around to see if there were any signs of the burglar-fox, about whom  I told you in another story.    \"I guess he's far enough off by this time,\" said Billie Goat, as he  polished his horns with a green leaf.    \"Yes, indeed,\" spoke Uncle Wiggily. \"It is a good thing that Nannie knew  how to make a paper lantern.\"    \"Oh, I can make lots of things out of paper,\" said the little goat girl.  \"Our teacher in school shows us how. Why I can even make a paper house.\"    \"Can you, indeed?\" asked the old gentleman rabbit, as he washed his paws  and face for breakfast. \"Now I should dearly like to know how to make a  paper house.\"    \"Why?\" asked Billie Goat, curious like.    \"So that when I am traveling about, looking for my fortune, and night  comes on, and I have no place to stay, then I could make me a paper house,  and be all nice and dry in case it rained,\" replied the rabbit.    \"Oh, but the water would soon soak through the paper,\" said Billie. \"I  know, for once I made a paper boat, and sailed it on the pond, and soon it  was soaked through, and sank away down.\"    \"Oh, but if I use that funny, greasy paper which comes inside cracker  boxes--the kind with wax on it--that wouldn't wet through,\" spoke the  rabbit as he went inside the goat-house with the children, for Mrs. Goat  had called them in to breakfast.    \"That would be just fine!\" exclaimed Nannie, as she passed some apple  sauce and oatmeal to Uncle Wiggily. \"After breakfast I'll show you how to  make a paper house.\"    Well, surely enough, as soon as breakfast was over, and before she and  Billie had gone to school, Nannie showed the old gentleman rabbit how to  make a paper house. You take some paper and some scissors, and you cut out  the sides of the house and the roof, and you make windows and doors in  these sides, and then you make a chimney, and you fasten them all  together, with paste or glue, and, there you are. Isn't it easy?    And if you only make the paper house large enough, you can get inside of  it and have a play party, and perhaps you can make paper dishes and knives  and forks; but listen! If you make paper things to eat, like cake or  cookies or anything like that, please only make-believe to eat them, for  they are bad for the digestion if you _really_ chew them.    \"Well, I think I'll travel along now, and once more seek my fortune,\" said  Uncle Wiggily, when Billie and Nannie were ready to go to school. So Mrs.  Goat packed up for the rabbit a nice lunch in his valise, and Nannie gave  him some waxed paper, that the rain wouldn't melt, and Billie gave his  uncle a pair of scissors, and off Mr. Longears started.    Well, he traveled on and on, over the fields and through the woods, and  across little brooks, and pretty soon it was coming on dark night, and the  rabbit gentleman hadn't found his fortune.    \"Now I wonder where I can stay to-night?\" thought Uncle Wiggily, as he  looked about him. He could see nothing but an old stump, which was not  hollow, so he couldn't get inside of it, and the only other thing that  happened to be there was a flat stone, and he couldn't get under that.    \"I guess I must make me a paper house,\" said the old gentleman rabbit.  \"Then I can sleep in it in peace and quietness, and I'll travel on again  in the morning.\"    So he got out the waxed paper, and he took the scissors, and, sitting down  on the green grass, he cut out the sides and roof of the paper house. Then  he made the chimney, and put it on the roof, and then he fastened the  house together, and crawled inside, with his valise and his barber-pole  crutch.    \"I guess I won't make too many windows or doors,\" thought Uncle Wiggily,  \"for a savage bear or a burglar-fox might come along in the night, and try  to get in.\"    So he only made one door, and one window in the house. But he made a  little fireplace out of stones, and built a little fire in it, to cook his  supper. But listen, you children must never, never make a fire, unless  some big person is near to put it out in case it happens to run away, and  chases after you, to catch you. Fires are dreadfully scary things for  little folks, so please be careful.    Well, Uncle Wiggily cooked his supper, frying some carrots in a little tin  frying pan he had with him, and then he said his prayers, and went to bed.  Soon he was fast, fast asleep.    Well, in the middle of the night, Uncle Wiggily was awakened in his paper  house by hearing a funny noise outside.    \"Ha! I wonder what that can be?\" he exclaimed, sitting up, and reaching  out for his crutch. The noise kept on, \"pitter-patter;  pitter-patter-patter-pitter; pat-pit-pat-pit.\"    \"Oh, that sounds like the toe nails of the burglar-fox, running around the  house!\" said the rabbit. Then he listened more carefully, and suddenly he  laughed: \"Ha! Ha!\" Then he got up and looked out of the window. \"Why, it's  only the rain drops pit-pattering on the roof,\" he said. \"Isn't it jolly  to be in a house when it rains, and you can't get wet? After this every  night I'm going to always build a waxed-paper house,\" said Uncle Wiggily.    So he listened to the rain drops, and he thought how nice it was not to be  wet, and he went to sleep again. And pretty soon he woke up once more, for  he heard another noise. This time it was a sniffing, snooping, woofing  sort of a noise, and Uncle Wiggily knew that it wasn't the rain.    \"I'm sure that's the burglar-fox,\" he said. \"What shall I do? He can smash  my paper house with his teeth and claws, and then eat me. I should have  built a wooden house. But it's too late now. I know what I'll do. I'll dig  a cellar underneath my paper house, and I'll hide there, in case that fox  smashes the roof.\"    So Uncle Wiggily got up very softly, and right in the middle of the dirt  floor of his paper house he began to burrow down to dig a cellar. My, how  his paws made the sand and gravel fly, and soon he had dug quite a large  cellar, in which to hide.    And all this time the sniffing, snooping sound kept on, until, all of a  sudden a voice cried:    \"Let me in!\"    \"Who are you?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.    \"I'm the bad alligator,\" was the answer, \"and if you don't let me in, I'll  smash down your paper house with one swoop of my scalery-ailery tail.\"    \"You can't come in!\" cried the rabbit, and then that bad alligator gave  one swoop of his tail, and smashed Uncle Wiggily's nice paper house all to  pieces!    But do you s'pose the rabbit was there? No, indeed. He just grabbed up his  crutch and valise, and ran down into his cellar as far and as fast as he  could run, just as the roof fell in. And the cellar wasn't big enough for  the alligator to get in, and so he had to stay outside, and he couldn't  get Uncle Wiggily.    And then it rained, and thundered and lightninged, and the alligator got  scared, and ran off, but the rabbit gentleman was safe down in his cellar,  and he didn't get a bit wet, and went to sleep there for the rest of the  night. Now, please go to bed, and in case my toothbrush, doesn't go out  roller skating, and fall down and get bald-headed, I'll tell you next  about Uncle Wiggily and the paper boat.          STORY XXI    UNCLE WIGGILY IN A PAPER BOAT      When the morning dawned, after he had slept all night in the cellar under  his paper house, that the alligator, with his swooping scalery-ailery  tail, had knocked down, Uncle Wiggily awakened, brushed the dirt from his  ears, and crawled out.    \"My!\" he exclaimed as he saw the paper house all flat on the ground, like  a pancake, \"Nannie Goat would certainly be sorry to see this. But I  suppose it can't be helped. Anyhow, it's a good thing that I am not  squashed as flat as that house is. Now I'll see about my breakfast, and  then I'll travel on again.\"    So the old gentleman rabbit got his breakfast, eating almost the last  piece of the cherry pie, which he had left from the time when he made some  for the hedgehog, and then, taking his crutch, striped red, white and  blue, like a barber pole, off he started.    Well, pretty soon, in a little while, not so very long, Uncle Wiggily  came to a pond of water, and, looking down into it, he saw the most  beautiful goldfish that you can imagine. It was a big fish, too, and the  scales on it were as round as"]]]
