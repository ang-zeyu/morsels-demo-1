The  one hard fact which rests upon abundant evidence is this--the pyramids  were built for tombs, to contain the mummies of deceased Egyptians. The  chambers in their interiors, at the time of their discovery, held within  them sarcophagi, and in one instance the sarcophagus had within it a  coffin. The coffin had an inscription upon it, which showed that it had  once contained the body of a king. If anything more is necessary, we may  add that every pyramid in Egypt--and there are, as he have said, more  than sixty of them--was built for the same purpose, and that they all  occupy sites in the great necropolis, or burial-ground opposite Memphis,  where the inhabitants are known to have laid their dead.    The marvel is, how Khufu came suddenly to have so magnificent a thought  as that of constructing an edifice double the height of any previously  existing, covering five times the area, and containing ten times the  mass. Architecture does not generally proceed by \"leaps and bounds;\" but  here was a case of a sudden extraordinary advance, such as we shall find  it difficult to parallel elsewhere. An attempt has been made to solve  the mystery by the supposition that all pyramids were gradual  accretions, and that their size marks simply the length of a king's  reign, each monarch making his sepulchral chamber, with a small pyramid  above it, in his first year, and as his reign went on, adding each year  an outer coating; so that the number of these coatings tells the length  of his reign, as the age of a tree is known from the number of its  annual rings. In this case there would have been nothing ideally great  in the conception of Khufu--he would simply have happened to erect the  biggest pyramid because he happened to have the longest reign; but,  except in the case of the \"Third Pyramid,\" there is a unity of design in  the structures which implies that the architect had conceived the whole  structure in his mind from the first. The lengths of the several parts  are proportioned one to another. In the \"Great Pyramid,\" the main  chamber would not have needed the five relieving chambers above it  unless it was known that it would have to be pressed down by a  superincumbent mass, such as actually lies upon it. Moreover, how is it  possible to conceive that in the later years of a decrepid monarch, the  whole of an enormous pyramid could be coated over with huge blocks--and  the blocks are largest at the external surface--the work requiring to be  pushed each year with more vigour, as becoming each year greater and  more difficult? Again, what shall we say of the external finish? Each  pyramid was finally smoothed down to a uniform sloping surface. This  alone must have been a work of years. Did a pyramid builder leave it to  his successor to finish his pyramid? It is at least doubtful whether any  pyramid at all would ever have been finished had he done so.    We must hold, therefore, that Khufu did suddenly conceive a design  without a parallel--did require his architect to construct him a tomb,  which should put to shame all previous monuments, and should with  difficulty be surpassed, or even equalled. He must have possessed much  elevation of thought, and an intense ambition, together with inordinate  selfishness, an overweening pride, and entire callousness to the  sufferings of others, before he could have approved the plan which his  master-builder set before him. That plan, including the employment of  huge blocks of stone, their conveyance to the top of a hill a hundred  feet high, and their emplacement, in some cases, at a further elevation  of above 450 feet, involved, under the circumstances of the time, such  an amount of human suffering, that no king who had any regard for the  happiness of his subjects could have consented to it. Khufu must have  forced his subjects to labour for a long term of years--twenty,  according to Herodotus--at a servile work which was wholly unproductive,  and was carried on amid their sighs and groans for no object but his own  glorification, and the supposed safe custody of his remains. Shafra must  have done nearly the same. Hence an evil repute attached to the pyramid  builders, whose names were handed down to posterity as those of  evil-minded and impious kings, who neglected the service of the gods to  gratify their own vanity, and, so long as they could exalt themselves,  did not care how much they oppressed their people. There was not even  the poor apology for their conduct that their oppression fell on slaves,  or foreigners, or prisoners of war. Egypt was not yet a conquering  power; prisoners of war were few, slaves not very common. The labourers  whom the pyramid builders employed were their own free subjects whom  they impressed into the heavy service.    It is by a just Nemesis that the kings have in a great measure failed to  secure the ends at which they aimed, and in hope of which they steeled  their hearts against their subjects' cries. They have indeed handed down  their names to a remote age: but it is as tyrants and oppressors. They  are world-famous, or rather world-infamous. But that preservation of  their corporeal frame which they especially sought, is exactly what they  have missed attaining.        Let not a monument give you or me hopes,      Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops,    says the doggerel of the satiric Byron; and it is the absolute fact  that while thousands of mummies buried in common graves remain untouched  even to the present day, the very grandeur of the pyramid builders'  tombs attracted attention to them, caused the monuments to be opened,  the sarcophagi to be rifled, and the remains inclosed in them to be  dispersed to the four winds of heaven.    Still, whatever gloomy associations attach to the pyramids in respect of  the sufferings caused by their erection, as monuments they must always  challenge a certain amount of admiration. A great authority declares:  \"No one can possibly examine the interior of the Great Pyramid without  being struck with astonishment at the wonderful mechanical skill  displayed in its construction. The immense blocks of granite brought  from Syene, a distance of five hundred miles, polished like glass, and  so fitted that the joints can scarcely be detected! Nothing can be more  wonderful than the extraordinary amount of knowledge displayed in the  construction of the discharging chambers over the roof of the principal  apartment, in the alignment of the sloping galleries, in the provision  of the ventilating shafts, and in all the wonderful contrivances of the  structure. All these, too, are carried out with such precision that,  notwithstanding the immense superincumbent weight, no settlement in any  part can be detected to an appreciable fraction of an inch. Nothing more  perfect mechanically has ever been erected since that time.\"[8]    [Illustration: VIEW OF THE GREAT AND SECOND PYRAMIDS.]    The architectural effect of the two greatest of the pyramids is  certainly magnificent. They do not greatly impress the beholder at  first sight, for a pyramid, by the very law of its formation, never  looks as large as it is--it slopes away from the eye in every direction,  and eludes rather than courts observation. But as the spectator gazes,  as he prolongs his examination and inspection, the pyramids gain upon  him, their impressiveness increases. By the vastness of their mass, by  the impression of solidity and durability which they produce, partly  also, perhaps, by the symmetry and harmony of their lines and their  perfect simplicity and freedom from ornament, they convey to the  beholder a sense of grandeur and majesty, they produce within him a  feeling of astonishment and awe, such as is scarcely caused by any other  of the erections of man. In all ages travellers have felt and expressed  the warmest admiration for them. They impressed Herodotus as no works  that he had seen elsewhere, except, perhaps, the Babylonian. They  astonished Germanicus, familiar as he was with the great constructions  of Rome. They furnished Napoleon with the telling phrase, \"Soldiers,  forty centuries look down upon you from the top of the pyramids.\" Greece  and Rome reckoned them among the Seven Wonders of the world. Moderns  have doubted whether they could really be the work of human hands. If  they possess only one of the elements of architectural excellence, they  possess that element to so great an extent that in respect of it they  are unsurpassed, and probably unsurpassable.    These remarks apply especially to the first and second pyramids. The  \"Third\" is not a work of any very extraordinary grandeur. The bulk is  not greater than that of the chief pyramid of Saccarah, which has never  attracted much attention; and the height did not greatly exceed that of  the chief Mexican temple-mound. Moreover, the stones of which the  pyramid was composed are not excessively massive. The monument aimed at  being beautiful rather than grand. It was coated for half its height  with blocks of pink granite from Syene, bevelled at the edges, which  remain still in place on two sides of the structure. The entrance to it,  on the north side, was conspicuous, and seems to have had a metal  ornamentation let into the stone. The sepulchral chamber was beautifully  lined and roofed, and the sarcophagus was exquisitively carved.  Menkaura, the constructor, was not regarded as a tyrant, or an  oppressor, but as a mild and religious monarch, whom the gods ill-used  by giving him too short a reign. His religious temper is indicated by  the inscription on the coffin which contained his remains: \"O Osiris,\"  it reads, \"King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Menkaura, living eternally,  engendered by the Heaven, born of Nut, substance of Seb, thy mother Nut  stretches herself over thee in her name of the abyss of heaven. She  renders thee divine by destroying all thy enemies, O King Menkaura,  living eternally.\"    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15665"],[0,"New Latin Grammar (#14)"],[1,", _we shall have been_,    fueris, _thou wilt have been_,       fueritis, _you will have been_,    fuerit, _he will have been_;         fuerint, _they will have been_.
