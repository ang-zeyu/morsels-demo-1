One of the big doors of the block of chambers was found to be ajar,  and a porter proved to be yet in attendance.    \"Mr. Ferrara?\" began Dr. Cairn.    \"You are five minutes too late, sir,\" said the man. \"He left by motor  at ten past twelve. He's gone abroad, sir.\"          CHAPTER XI    CAIRO      The exact manner in which mental stress will effect a man's physical  health is often difficult to predict. Robert Cairn was in the pink of  condition at the time that he left Oxford to take up his London  appointment; but the tremendous nervous strain wrought upon him by  this series of events wholly outside the radius of normal things had  broken him up physically, where it might have left unscathed a more  highly strung, though less physically vigorous man.    Those who have passed through a nerve storm such as this which had  laid him low will know that convalescence seems like a welcome  awakening from a dreadful dream. It was indeed in a state between  awaking and dreaming that Robert Cairn took counsel with his  father--the latter more pale than was his wont and somewhat  anxious-eyed--and determined upon an Egyptian rest-cure.    \"I have made it all right at the office, Rob,\" said Dr. Cairn. \"In  three weeks or so you will receive instructions at Cairo to write up a  series of local articles. Until then, my boy, complete rest and--don't  worry; above all, don't worry. You and I have passed through a  saturnalia of horror, and you, less inured to horrors than I, have  gone down. I don't wonder.\"    \"Where is Antony Ferrara?\"    Dr. Cairn shook his head and his eyes gleamed with a sudden anger.  \"For God's sake don't mention his name!\" he said. \"That topic is  taboo, Rob. I may tell you, however, that he has left England.\"    In this unreal frame of mind, then, and as one but partly belonging to  the world of things actual, Cairn found himself an invalid, who but  yesterday had been a hale man; found himself shipped for Port Said;  found himself entrained for Cairo; and with an awakening to the  realities of life, an emerging from an ill-dream to lively interest in  the novelties of Egypt, found himself following the red-jerseyed  Shepheard's porter along the corridor of the train and out on to the  platform.    A short drive through those singular streets where East meets West and  mingles, in the sudden, violet dusk of Lower Egypt, and he was amid  the bustle of the popular hotel.    Sime was there, whom he had last seen at Oxford, Sime the phlegmatic.  He apologised for not meeting the train, but explained that his duties  had rendered it impossible. Sime was attached temporarily to an  archaeological expedition as medical man, and his athletic and somewhat  bovine appearance contrasted oddly with the unhealthy gauntness of  Cairn.    \"I only got in from Wasta ten minutes ago, Cairn. You must come out to  the camp when I return; the desert air will put you on your feet again  in no time.\"    Sime was unemotional, but there was concern in his voice and in his  glance, for the change in Cairn was very startling. Although he knew  something, if but very little, of certain happenings in  London--gruesome happenings centering around the man called Antony  Ferrara--he avoided any reference to them at the moment.    Seated upon the terrace, Robert Cairn studied the busy life in the  street below with all the interest of a new arrival in the Capital of  the Near East. More than ever, now, his illness and the things which  had led up to it seemed to belong to a remote dream existence. Through  the railings at his feet a hawker was thrusting fly-whisks, and  imploring him in complicated English to purchase one. Vendors of  beads, of fictitious \"antiques,\" of sweetmeats, of what-not;  fortune-tellers--and all that chattering horde which some obscure  process of gravitation seems to hurl against the terrace of  Shepheard's, buzzed about him. Carriages and motor cars, camels and  donkeys mingled, in the Sharia Kamel Pasha. Voices American, voices  Anglo-Saxon, guttural German tones, and softly murmured Arabic merged  into one indescribable chord of sound; but to Robert Cairn it was all  unspeakably restful. He was quite contented to sit there sipping his  whisky and soda, and smoking his pipe. Sheer idleness was good for him  and exactly what he wanted, and idling amid that unique throng is  idleness _de luxe_.    Sime watched him covertly, and saw that his face had acquired  lines--lines which told of the fires through which he had passed.  Something, it was evident--something horrible--had seared his mind.  Considering the many indications of tremendous nervous disaster in  Cairn, Sime wondered how near his companion had come to insanity, and  concluded that he had stood upon the frontiers of that grim land of  phantoms, and had only been plucked back in the eleventh hour.    Cairn glanced around with a smile, from the group of hawkers who  solicited his attention upon the pavement below.    \"This is a delightful scene,\" he said. \"I could sit here for hours;  but considering that it's some time after sunset it remains unusually  hot, doesn't it?\"    \"Rather!\" replied Sime. \"They are expecting _Khamsin_--the hot wind,  you know. I was up the river a week ago and we struck it badly in  Assouan. It grew as black as night and one couldn't breathe for sand.  It's probably working down to Cairo.\"    \"From your description I am not anxious to make the acquaintance of  _Khamsin_!\"    Sime shook his head, knocking out his pipe into the ash-tray.    \"This is a funny country,\" he said reflectively. \"The most weird ideas  prevail here to this day--ideas which properly belong to the Middle  Ages. For instance\"--he began to recharge the hot bowl--\"it is not  really time for _Khamsin_, consequently the natives feel called upon  to hunt up some explanation of its unexpected appearance. Their ideas  on the subject are interesting, if idiotic. One of our Arabs (we are  excavating in the Fayum, you know), solemnly assured me yesterday  that the hot wind had been caused by an Efreet, a sort of Arabian  Nights' demon, who has arrived in Egypt!\"    He laughed gruffly, but Cairn was staring at him with a curious  expression. Sime continued:    \"When I got to Cairo this evening I found news of the Efreet had  preceded me. Honestly, Cairn, it is all over the town--the native  town, I mean. All the shopkeepers in the Muski are talking about it.  If a puff of _Khamsin_ should come, I believe they would permanently  shut up shop and hide in their cellars--if they have any! I am rather  hazy on modern Egyptian architecture.\"    Cairn nodded his head absently.    \"You laugh,\" he said, \"but the active force of a superstition--what we  call a superstition--is sometimes a terrible thing.\"    Sime stared.    \"Eh!\" The medical man had suddenly come uppermost; he recollected that  this class of discussion was probably taboo.    \"You may doubt the existence of Efreets,\" continued Cairn, \"but  neither you nor I can doubt the creative power of thought. If a  trained hypnotist, by sheer concentration, can persuade his subject  that the latter sits upon the brink of a river fishing when actually  he sits upon a platform in a lecture-room, what result should you  expect from a concentration of thousands of native minds upon the idea  that an Efreet is visiting Egypt?\"    Sime stared in a dull way peculiar to him.    \"Rather a poser,\" he said. \"I have a glimmer of a notion what you  mean.\"    \"Don't you think--\"    \"If you mean don't I think the result would be the creation of an  Efreet, no, I don't!\"    \"I hardly mean that, either,\" replied Cairn, \"but this wave of  superstition cannot be entirely unproductive; all that thought energy  directed to one point--\"    Sime stood up.    \"We shall get out of our depth,\" he replied conclusively. He  considered the ground of discussion an unhealthy one; this was the  territory adjoining that of insanity.    A fortune-teller from India proffered his services incessantly.    \"_Imshi_! _imshi_!\" growled Sime.    \"Hold on,\" said Cairn smiling; \"this chap is not an Egyptian; let us  ask him if he has heard the rumour respecting the Efreet!\"    Sime reseated himself rather unwillingly. The fortune-teller spread  his little carpet and knelt down in order to read the palm of his  hypothetical client, but Cairn waved him aside.    \"I don't want my fortune told!\" he said; \"but I will give you your  fee,\"--with a smile at Sime--\"for a few minutes' conversation.\"    \"Yes, sir, yes, sir!\" The Indian was all attention.    \"Why\"--Cairn pointed forensically at the fortune-teller--\"why is  _Khamsin_ come so early this year?\"    The Indian spread his hands, palms upward.    \"How should I know?\" he replied in his soft, melodious voice. \"I am  not of Egypt; I can only say what is told to me by the Egyptians.\"    \"And what is told to you?\"    Sime rested his hands upon his knees, bending forward curiously. He  was palpably anxious that Cairn should have confirmation of the Efreet  story from the Indian.    \"They tell me, sir,\"--the man's voice sank musically low--\"that a  thing very evil\"--he tapped a long brown finger upon his breast--\"not  as I am\"--he tapped Sime upon the knee--\"not as he, your friend\"--he  thrust the long finger at Cairn--\"not as you, sir; not a man at all,  though something like a man! not having any father and mother--\"    \"You mean,\" suggested Sime, \"a spirit?\"    The fortune-teller shook his head.    \"They tell me, sir, not a spirit--a man, but not as other men; a very,  very bad man; one that the great king, long, long ago, the king you  call Wise ----\"    \"Solomon?\" suggested Cairn.    \"Yes, yes, Suleyman!--one that he, when he banish all the tribe of the  demons from earth--one that he not found.\"    \"One he overlooked?\" jerked Sime.    \"Yes, yes, overlook! A very evil man, my gentlemen. They tell me he  has come to Egypt. He come not from the sea, but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19713"],[0,"The Laughing Prince: Jugoslav Folk and Fairy Tales (#14)"],[1,"ever you need me, rub this hair.\"    The third day he met a raven that had fallen on a thorn and was pinned  to the ground.    \"Help me, brother, help me!\" the raven begged, \"and--who knows?--some  day I may help you!\"    The Prince lifted the raven off the thorn and the raven, before it flew  away, gave the Prince one of its feathers saying:    \"If ever you need me, rub this feather.\"    So the Prince reached the house of the Old Woman of the Mountain with  the fish's scale, the fox's hair, and the raven's feather each safely  tied in a corner of his handkerchief.    The Old Woman of the Mountain was an ugly old witch with a long nose  that hooked down and a long chin that hooked up.    \"Ha! Ha!\" she cackled when she saw the Prince. \"Another one that wants  service with the Old Woman, eh?\"    \"Yes,\" said the Prince.    \"You know the conditions?\" the Old Woman said. \"Guard my mare and her  foal for three nights in succession and you may have any horse in my  stable. But if she escapes you, then your head is mine and I'll stick it  up there as a warning to other rash young men.\"    The Old Woman pointed to a high picket fence that surrounded the  courtyard. On every picket but one there was a grinning human skull. The  Prince looked and the only picket that had no skull called out:    \"I want my skull, granny! I want my skull!\"    The Old Woman gave a wicked laugh.    \"You see,\" she said, \"we were expecting you!\"    When night fell the Prince led out the mare and her foal to a grassy  meadow. To make sure that she would not escape him, he mounted her.  Midnight came and he must have fallen asleep for suddenly he awoke to  find himself astride a rail with an empty bridle in his hand. In despair  he looked in all directions. At one end of the meadow was a pond.    \"She may have gone there to drink,\" he said to himself.    At the pond he saw a hoofprint.    [Illustration: _The Old Woman of the Mountain and the Wonder Horse_]    \"Ah,\" he thought, \"if my fish were here, it could tell me.\"    He untied the corner of the handkerchief that had the fish scale, rubbed  the scale gently, and at once a little voice called out from the water:    \"What is it, brother? Can I help you?\"    \"Can you tell me what has become of the Old Woman's mare and foal?\"    \"Aye, brother, that I can! She and the foal are turned into fish and are  down here in the water hiding amongst us. Strike the water three times  with the bridle and say: 'Mare of the Old Woman, come out!' That will  bring her!\"    The Prince did this. There was a commotion in the water, a big fish and  a little fish leaped high in the air, fell on shore, and instantly  changed to mare and foal. When morning came the Prince drove them back  to the Old Woman.    She grinned and pretended to be pleased but, when she had the mare alone  in the stable, the Prince heard her beating the poor creature and  saying:    \"Why didn't you do as I told you and hide among the fishes?\"    \"I did,\" whinnied the mare, \"but the fishes are his friends and he found  me!\"    \"To-night,\" the Old Woman snarled, \"hide among the foxes and this time  don't let him find you! Do you hear me? The foxes!\"    The Prince remembered this and the second night when he awoke to find  himself again sitting astride a rail and holding an empty bridle in his  hand, he untied the second corner of his handkerchief, took out the  fox's hair, and rubbed it gently.    Instantly he heard a little bark and the fox's voice said:    \"What is it, brother? Can I help you?\"    \"Can you tell me,\" the Prince asked, \"what has become of the Old Woman's  mare and foal?\"    \"Aye, brother, that I can! She and the foal are turned into foxes and  are over in yonder woods now hiding among my people. Strike the earth  three times with the bridle and say: 'Mare of the Old Woman, come back!'  That will bring her!\"    The Prince did this and instantly two foxes, a vixen and a cub, came  trotting out of the woods and when they reached the Prince they changed  back to mare and foal.    In the morning the Prince drove them home to the Old Woman. As before  she grinned and pretended to be pleased but when she had the mare alone  in the stable the Prince heard her giving the poor creature another  beating and saying:    \"Why didn't you do as I told you and hide among the foxes?\"    \"I did,\" whinnied the mare, \"but the foxes are his friends, too, and he  found me!\"    \"To-night,\" the Old Woman ordered, \"hide among the ravens and this time  don't let him find you!\"    The third night the Prince tried hard to stay awake but sleep again  overcame him and when he woke he found himself for the third time  sitting astride a rail and holding the empty bridle in his hand. But he  remembered the Old Woman's words and at once opened the third corner of  his handkerchief and taking out the raven's feather rubbed it gently.    There was a flutter of wings and a raven's hoarse voice said:    \"Caw! Caw! What is it, brother? Can I help you?\"    \"Can you tell me what has become of the Old Woman's mare and foal?\"    \"Aye, brother, that I can! She and the foal are turned into ravens and  are perched in yonder tall fir tree hiding among my folk. Strike the  trunk of the tree three times with your bridle and say: 'Mare of the  Old Woman, come down!' That will bring her!\"    The Prince went over to the fir tree, struck it three times with the  bridle and said:    \"Mare of the Old Woman, come down!\"    Instantly two ravens, a big one and a fledgling, fluttered to earth and  changed to mare and foal. So when morning came the Prince was able to  drive them back to the Old Woman and claim his reward.    The Old Woman was angry enough to kill him but she pretended to be  pleased and she smiled and grinned and she patted the Prince on the arm  and said:    \"Aye, my son, but you are a hero! You have won the reward and you are  worthy of it. Choose now the finest horse in my stable. It is yours.\"    She drove the twelve handsome stallions out into the courtyard and urged  them on the Prince one after the other. But at each the Prince shook his  head.    \"I am only a poor adventurer,\" he said. \"Such horses as these are too  fine for me. Give me rather that poor mangy creature that lies over  yonder on the dung heap. That is the one I choose.\"    Then the Old Woman fell into an awful rage and shook and chattered and  begged the Prince not to take that horse.    \"It would shame me,\" she said, \"to have you ride off on that poor beast  which is half dead already! No, no, my son, you mustn't take him!\"    \"But that's the one I'm going to take,\" the Prince said firmly, \"that  and none other!\" He drew his sword and lifted it threateningly. \"I have  won whatever horse I choose and now, Old Woman, if you do not keep your  bargain I shall strike you dead with this sword and stick up your  grinning skull on that empty picket!\"    At that the empty picket began to shout:    \"I want my skull! I want my skull!\"    When the Old Woman of the Mountain saw that the Prince knew what he was  about, she gave up trying to deceive him and let him lead off the horse  he wanted. So the Prince walked away dragging the poor mangy creature  after him. When he was out of sight of the Old Woman's house, he turned  to the horse and began rubbing down his rough coat and patting his  wobbly legs.    \"Now, my beauty,\" he said, \"we'll see what you're made of!\"    Under his hand the mangy beast changed to a glorious animal--one of  those wonder horses of the olden days that rise on the wind and gallop  with the clouds. Soon his coat shone like burnished gold and his tail  and mane streamed out like flames of fire.    \"Ah, my master,\" the horse said, \"I have been waiting for you this many  a day! We shall have glorious adventures together!\"    Then the Prince mounted him and he rose on the wind and went so swiftly  that he covered in three minutes all the distance that it had taken the  Prince three days to go on an ordinary horse. Whiff! and there they were  at the dragon's castle and there was the Princess running out to welcome  them.    \"Now, my dear one,\" the Prince said, lifting the Princess up in front of  him, \"this time the dragon will not overtake us!\"    The wonder horse rose on the wind and off they went.    When the dragon got home and found that the Princess had fled again, he  said to his horse:    \"Shall we follow her at once or shall we eat supper first?\"    \"It's all one what we do,\" the horse said, \"for we shall never overtake  her.\"    At that the dragon leaped upon his horse and, mounting on the wind,  started off in hot pursuit. Presently they caught sight of the other  horse carrying the Prince and the Princess but, try as he would, the  dragon's horse could not overtake the other. The dragon beat his horse  unmercifully and dug his sharp claws into the horse's tender flanks  until the horse in agony called out to the Prince's horse:    \"Hold, brother, hold! Let me overtake you or this monster will kill me  with his cruelty!\"    \"Why do you carry such a monster?\" the Prince's horse called back.  \"Throw him from you and be rid of him forever!\"    At that the dragon's horse reared suddenly and the dragon, losing his  balance, fell and was dashed to pieces on the rocks below.    And that was the end of that dragon!    Then the Princess wept but her tears were tears of joy for she knew now  that the enchantment that had bound her was broken forever. Never again  would she be changed into a peafowl at the whim of a wicked dragon,  never again be separated from her loved one. Presently she mounted the  dragon's horse and together she and the Prince returned to the beautiful  city. The people came out to meet them and when they heard of the  dragon's death a holiday was proclaimed and amidst music and dancing and  merrymaking the Princess married the Prince. Then she was made Queen of  that beautiful city and the Prince was made King. They ruled long and  wisely and better than that they"]]]
