Here and there through the early writings we have  only the merest hints as to what girls studied and as to the length of  their schooling. Of course, throughout the world in the seventeenth  century it was not customary to educate women in the sense that men in  the same rank were educated. Her place was in the home and as economic  pressure was not generally such as to force her to make her own living  in shop or factory or office, and as society would have scowled at the  very idea, she naturally prepared only for marriage and home-making.  Very few men of the era, even among philosophers and educational  leaders, ever seemed to think that a woman might be a better mother  through thorough mental training. And the women themselves, in the main,  apparently were not interested.    The result was that there long existed an astonishingly large amount of  illiteracy among them. Through an examination made for the U.S.  Department of Education, it has been found that among women signing  deeds or other legal documents in Massachusetts, from 1653 to 1656, as  high as fifty per cent could not write their name, and were obliged to  sign by means of a cross; while as late as 1697 fully thirty-eight per  cent were as illiterate. In New York fully sixty per cent of the Dutch  women were obliged to make their mark; while in Virginia, where deeds  signed by 3,066 women were examined, seventy-five per cent could not  sign their names. If the condition was so bad among those prosperous  enough to own property, what must it have been among the poor and  so-called lower classes?    We know, of course, that early in the seventeenth century schools  attended by both boys and girls were established in Massachusetts, and  before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth there was at least one public  school for both sexes in Virginia. But for the most part the girls of  early New England appear to have gone to the \"dame's school,\" taught  by some spinster or poverty-stricken widow. We may again turn to  Sewall's _Diary_ for bits of evidence concerning the schooling in the  seventeenth century: \"Tuesday, Oct. 16, 1688. Little Hanah going to  School in the morn, being enter'd a little within the Schoolhouse  Lane, is rid over by David Lopez, fell on her back, but I hope little  hurt, save that her Teeth bled a Little; was much frighted; but went  to School.\"[43] \"Friday, Jan. 7th, 1686-7. This day Dame Walker is  taken so ill that she sends home my Daughters, not being able to teach  them.\"[44] \"Wednesday, Jan. 19th, 1686-7. Mr. Stoughton and Dudley and  Capt. Eliot and Self, go to Muddy-River to Andrew Gardner's, where  'tis agreed that L12 only in or as Money, be levyed on the people by a  Rate towards maintaining a School to teach to write and read  English.\"[45] \"Apr. 27, 1691.... This afternoon had Joseph to School  to Capt. Townsend's Mother's, his Cousin Jane accompanying him,  carried his Hornbook.\"[46]    And what did girls of Puritan days learn in the \"dame schools\"? Sewall  again may enlighten us in a notation in his _Diary_ for 1696: \"Mary goes  to Mrs. Thair's to learn to Read and Knit.\" More than one hundred years  afterwards (1817), Abigail Adams, writing of her childhood, declared:  \"My early education did not partake of the abundant opportunities which  the present days offer, and which even our common country schools now  afford. I never was sent to any school. I was always sick. Female  education, in the best families went no farther than writing and  arithmetic; in some few and rare instances, music and dancing.\"[47]    The Dutch women of New York, famous for their skill in housekeeping,  probably did not attend school, but received at home what little they  knew of reading, writing, and arithmetic. Mrs. Grant, speaking of  opportunities for female education in New Amsterdam in 1709, makes it  clear that the training of a girl's brain troubled no Hollander's head.  \"It was at this time very difficult to procure the means of instruction  in those inland districts; female education, of consequence, was  conducted on a very limited scale; girls learned needlework (in which  they were indeed both skilful and ingenious) from their mothers and  aunts; they were taught too at that period to read, in Dutch, the Bible,  and a few Calvinist tracts of the devotional kind. But in the infancy  of the settlement few girls read English; when they did, they were  thought accomplished; they generally spoke it, however imperfectly, and  few were taught writing. This confined education precluded elegance;  yet, though there was no polish, there was no vulgarity.\"[48]    The words of the biographer of Catherine Schuyler might truthfully have  been applied to almost any girl in or near the quaint Dutch city:  \"Meanwhile [about 1740] the girl [Catherine Schuyler] was perfecting  herself in the arts of housekeeping so dear to the Dutch matron. The  care of the dairy, the poultry, the spinning, the baking, the brewing,  the immaculate cleanliness of the Dutch, were not so much duties as  sacred household rites.\"[49] So much for womanly education in New  Amsterdam. A thorough training in domestic science, enough arithmetic  for keeping accurate accounts of expenses, and previous little  reading--these were considered ample to set the young woman on the right  path for her vocation as wife and mother.    This high respect for arithmetic was by no means limited to New York.  Ben Franklin, while in London, wrote thus to his daughter: \"The more  attentively dutiful and tender you are towards your good mama, the more  you will recommend yourself to me.... Go constantly to church, whoever  preaches. For the rest, I would only recommend to you in my absence, to  acquire those useful accomplishments, arithmetic, and book-keeping. This  you might do with ease, if you would resolve not to see company on the  hours set apart for those studies.\"[50] In addition, however, Franklin  seems not to have been averse to a girl's receiving some of those social  accomplishments which might add to her graces; for in 1750 he wrote his  mother the following message about this same child: \"Sally grows a fine  Girl, and is extreamly industrious with her Needle, and delights in her  Book. She is of a most affectionate Temper, and perfectly dutiful and  obliging to her Parents, and to all. Perhaps I flatter myself too much,  but I have hopes that she will prove an ingenious, sensible, notable,  and worthy Woman, like her Aunt Jenny. She goes now to the  Dancing-School...\"[51]      _II. Woman's Education in the South_    It is to be expected that there was much more of this training in social  accomplishments in the South than in the North. Among the \"first  families,\" in Virginia and the Carolinas the daughters regularly  received instruction, not only in household duties and the supervision  of the multitude of servants, but in music, dancing, drawing, etiquette  and such other branches as might help them to shine in the social life  that was so abundant. Thomas Jefferson has left us some hints as to the  education of aristocratic women in Virginia, in the following letter of  advice to his daughter:         \"Dear Patsy:--With respect to the distribution of your time, the       following is what I should approve:         \"From 8 to 10, practice music.         \"From 10 to 1, dance one day and draw another.         \"From 1 to 2, draw on the day you dance, and write a letter next       day.         \"From 3 to 4, read French.         \"From 4 to 5, exercise yourself in music.         \"From 5 till bedtime, read English, write, etc.         \"Informe me what books you read, what tunes you learn, and inclose       me your best copy of every lesson in drawing.... Take care that       you never spell a word wrong.... It produces great praise to a       lady to spell well....\"[52]    It should be noted, of course, that this message was written in the  later years of the eighteenth century when the French influence in  America was far more prominent than during the seventeenth. Moreover,  Jefferson himself had then been in France some time, and undoubtedly was  permeated with French ideas and ideals. But the established custom  throughout the South, except in Louisiana, demanded that the daughters  of the leading families receive a much more varied form of schooling  than their sisters in most parts of the North were obtaining. While the  sons of wealthy planters were frequently sent to English universities,  the daughters were trained under private tutors, who themselves were  often university graduates, and not infrequently well versed in  languages and literatures. The advice of Philip Fithian to John Peck,  his successor as private instructor in the family of a wealthy  Virginian, may be enlightening as to the character and sincerity of  these colonial teachers of Southern girls:    \"The last direction I shall venture to mention on this head, is that you  abstain totally from women. What I would have you understand from this,  is, that by a train of faultless conduct in the whole course of your  tutorship, you make every Lady within the Sphere of your acquaintance,  who is between twelve and forty years of age, so much pleased with your  person, & so satisfied as to your ability in the capacity of a Teacher;  & in short, fully convinced, that, from a principle of Duty, you have  both, by night and by day endeavoured to acquit yourself honourably, in  the Character of a Tutor; & that this account, you have their free and  hearty consent, without making any manner of demand upon you, either to  stay longer in the Country with them, which they would choose, or  whenever your business calls you away, that they may not have it in  their Power either by charms or Justice to detain you, and when you must  leave them, have their sincere wishes & constant prayrs for Length of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15489"],[0,"Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners (#14)"],[1,"a situation in  which wishes of that sort are commonly suppressed--a situation which is  so filled with sorrow that love is not thought of. And yet, it is very  easily probable that even in the actual situation at the bier of the  second, more dearly loved boy, which the dream copied faithfully, she  had not been able to suppress her feelings of affection for the visitor  whom she had missed for so long a time.    A different explanation was found in the case of a similar dream of  another female patient, who was distinguished in her earlier years by  her quick wit and her cheerful demeanors and who still showed these  qualities at least in the notion, which occurred to her in the course of  treatment. In connection with a longer dream, it seemed to this lady  that she saw her fifteen-year-old daughter lying dead before her in a  box. She was strongly inclined to convert this dream-image into an  objection to the theory of wish-fulfillment, but herself suspected that  the detail of the box must lead to a different conception of the  dream.[3] In the course of the analysis it occurred to her that on the  evening before, the conversation of the company had turned upon the  English word \"box,\" and upon the numerous translations of it into  German, such as box, theater box, chest, box on the ear, &c. From other  components of the same dream it is now possible to add that the lady had  guessed the relationship between the English word \"box\" and the German  _Buechse_, and had then been haunted by the memory that _Buechse_ (as well  as \"box\") is used in vulgar speech to designate the female genital  organ. It was therefore possible, making a certain allowance for her  notions on the subject of topographical anatomy, to assume that the  child in the box signified a child in the womb of the mother. At this  stage of the explanation she no longer denied that the picture of the  dream really corresponded to one of her wishes. Like so many other young  women, she was by no means happy when she became pregnant, and admitted  to me more than once the wish that her child might die before its birth;  in a fit of anger following a violent scene with her husband she had  even struck her abdomen with her fists in order to hit the child within.  The dead child was, therefore, really the fulfillment of a wish, but a  wish which had been put aside for fifteen years, and it is not  surprising that the fulfillment of the wish was no longer recognized  after so long an interval. For there had been many changes meanwhile.    The group of dreams to which the two last mentioned belong, having as  content the death of beloved relatives, will be considered again under  the head of \"Typical Dreams.\" I shall there be able to show by new  examples that in spite of their undesirable content, all these dreams  must be interpreted as wish-fulfillments. For the following dream, which  again was told me in order to deter me from a hasty generalization of  the theory of wishing in dreams, I am indebted, not to a patient, but to  an intelligent jurist of my acquaintance. \"_I dream_,\" my informant  tells me, \"_that I am walking in front of my house with a lady on my  arm. Here a closed wagon is waiting, a gentleman steps up to me, gives  his authority as an agent of the police, and demands that I should  follow him. I only ask for time in which to arrange my affairs._ Can you  possibly suppose this is a wish of mine to be arrested?\" \"Of course  not,\" I must admit. \"Do you happen to know upon what charge you were  arrested?\" \"Yes; I believe for infanticide.\" \"Infanticide? But you know  that only a mother can commit this crime upon her newly born child?\"  \"That is true.\"[4] \"And under what circumstances did you dream; what  happened on the evening before?\" \"I would rather not tell you that; it  is a delicate matter.\" \"But I must have it, otherwise we must forgo the  interpretation of the dream.\" \"Well, then, I will tell you. I spent the  night, not at home, but at the house of a lady who means very much to  me. When we awoke in the morning, something again passed between us.  Then I went to sleep again, and dreamt what I have told you.\" \"The woman  is married?\" \"Yes.\" \"And you do not wish her to conceive a child?\" \"No;  that might betray us.\" \"Then you do not practice normal coitus?\" \"I take  the precaution to withdraw before ejaculation.\" \"Am I permitted to  assume that you did this trick several times during the night, and that  in the morning you were not quite sure whether you had succeeded?\" \"That  might be the case.\" \"Then your dream is the fulfillment of a wish. By  means of it you secure the assurance that you have not begotten a child,  or, what amounts to the same thing, that you have killed a child. I can  easily demonstrate the connecting links. Do you remember, a few days ago  we were talking about the distress of matrimony (Ehenot), and about the  inconsistency of permitting the practice of coitus as long as no  impregnation takes place, while every delinquency after the ovum and  the semen meet and a foetus is formed is punished as a crime? In  connection with this, we also recalled the mediaeval controversy about  the moment of time at which the soul is really lodged in the foetus,  since the concept of murder becomes admissible only from that point on.  Doubtless you also know the gruesome poem by Lenau, which puts  infanticide and the prevention of children on the same plane.\"  \"Strangely enough, I had happened to think of Lenau during the  afternoon.\" \"Another echo of your dream. And now I shall demonstrate to  you another subordinate wish-fulfillment in your dream. You walk in  front of your house with the lady on your arm. So you take her home,  instead of spending the night at her house, as you do in actuality. The  fact that the wish-fulfillment, which is the essence of the dream,  disguises itself in such an unpleasant form, has perhaps more than one  reason. From my essay on the etiology of anxiety neuroses, you will see  that I note interrupted coitus as one of the factors which cause the  development of neurotic fear. It would be consistent with this that if  after repeated cohabitation of the kind mentioned you should be left in  an uncomfortable mood, which now becomes an element in the composition  of your dream. You also make use of this unpleasant state of mind to  conceal the wish-fulfillment. Furthermore, the mention of infanticide  has not yet been explained. Why does this crime, which is peculiar to  females, occur to you?\" \"I shall confess to you that I was involved in  such an affair years ago. Through my fault a girl tried to protect  herself from the consequences of a _liaison_ with me by securing an  abortion. I had nothing to do with carrying out the plan, but I was  naturally for a long time worried lest the affair might be discovered.\"  \"I understand; this recollection furnished a second reason why the  supposition that you had done your trick badly must have been painful to  you.\"    A young physician, who had heard this dream of my colleague when it was  told, must have felt implicated by it, for he hastened to imitate it in  a dream of his own, applying its mode of thinking to another subject.  The day before he had handed in a declaration of his income, which was  perfectly honest, because he had little to declare. He dreamt that an  acquaintance of his came from a meeting of the tax commission and  informed him that all the other declarations of income had passed  uncontested, but that his own had awakened general suspicion, and that  he would be punished with a heavy fine. The dream is a poorly-concealed  fulfillment of the wish to be known as a physician with a large income.  It likewise recalls the story of the young girl who was advised against  accepting her suitor because he was a man of quick temper who would  surely treat her to blows after they were married.    The answer of the girl was: \"I wish he _would_ strike me!\" Her wish to  be married is so strong that she takes into the bargain the discomfort  which is said to be connected with matrimony, and which is predicted for  her, and even raises it to a wish.    If I group the very frequently occurring dreams of this sort, which seem  flatly to contradict my theory, in that they contain the denial of a  wish or some occurrence decidedly unwished for, under the head of  \"counter wish-dreams,\" I observe that they may all be referred to two  principles, of which one has not yet been mentioned, although it plays a  large part in the dreams of human beings. One of the motives inspiring  these dreams is the wish that I should appear in the wrong. These dreams  regularly occur in the course of my treatment if the patient shows a  resistance against me, and I can count with a large degree of certainty  upon causing such a dream after I have once explained to the patient my  theory that the dream is a wish-fulfillment.[5] I may even expect this  to be the case in a dream merely in order to fulfill the wish that I may  appear in the wrong. The last dream which I shall tell from those  occurring in the course of treatment again shows this very thing. A  young girl who has struggled hard to continue my treatment, against the  will of her relatives and the authorities whom she had consulted, dreams  as follows: _She is forbidden at home to come to me any more. She then  reminds me of the promise I made her to treat her for nothing if  necessary, and I say to her: \"I can show no consideration in money  matters.\"_    It is not at all easy in this case to demonstrate the fulfillment of a  wish, but in all cases of this kind there is a second problem, the  solution of which helps also to solve the first. Where does she get the  words which she puts into my mouth? Of course I have never told her  anything like that, but one of her brothers, the very one who has the  greatest influence over her, has been kind enough to make this remark  about me. It is then"]]]
