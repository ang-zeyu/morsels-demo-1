When I wish to rise to the level  of the sea, I only let off the water, and empty all the reservoirs if I  want the Nautilus to emerge from the tenth part of her total capacity.\"    I had nothing to object to these reasonings.    \"I admit your calculations, Captain,\" I replied; \"I should be wrong to  dispute them since daily experience confirms them; but I foresee a real  difficulty in the way.\"    \"What, sir?\"    \"When you are about 1,000 feet deep, the walls of the Nautilus bear a  pressure of 100 atmospheres.  If, then, just now you were to empty the  supplementary reservoirs, to lighten the vessel, and to go up to the  surface, the pumps must overcome the pressure of 100 atmospheres, which  is 1,500 lbs.  per square inch.  From that a power----\"    \"That electricity alone can give,\" said the Captain, hastily.  \"I  repeat, sir, that the dynamic power of my engines is almost infinite.  The pumps of the Nautilus have an enormous power, as you must have  observed when their jets of water burst like a torrent upon the Abraham  Lincoln.  Besides, I use subsidiary reservoirs only to attain a mean  depth of 750 to 1,000 fathoms, and that with a view of managing my  machines.  Also, when I have a mind to visit the depths of the ocean  five or six mlles below the surface, I make use of slower but not less  infallible means.\"    \"What are they, Captain?\"    \"That involves my telling you how the Nautilus is worked.\"    \"I am impatient to learn.\"    \"To steer this boat to starboard or port, to turn, in a word, following  a horizontal plan, I use an ordinary rudder fixed on the back of the  stern-post, and with one wheel and some tackle to steer by.  But I can  also make the Nautilus rise and sink, and sink and rise, by a vertical  movement by means of two inclined planes fastened to its sides,  opposite the centre of flotation, planes that move in every direction,  and that are worked by powerful levers from the interior.  If the  planes are kept parallel with the boat, it moves horizontally.  If  slanted, the Nautilus, according to this inclination, and under the  influence of the screw, either sinks diagonally or rises diagonally as  it suits me.  And even if I wish to rise more quickly to the surface, I  ship the screw, and the pressure of the water causes the Nautilus to  rise vertically like a balloon filled with hydrogen.\"    \"Bravo, Captain!  But how can the steersman follow the route in the  middle of the waters?\"    \"The steersman is placed in a glazed box, that is raised about the hull  of the Nautilus, and furnished with lenses.\"    \"Are these lenses capable of resisting such pressure?\"    \"Perfectly.  Glass, which breaks at a blow, is, nevertheless, capable  of offering considerable resistance.  During some experiments of  fishing by electric light in 1864 in the Northern Seas, we saw plates  less than a third of an inch thick resist a pressure of sixteen  atmospheres.  Now, the glass that I use is not less than thirty times  thicker.\"    \"Granted.  But, after all, in order to see, the light must exceed the  darkness, and in the midst of the darkness in the water, how can you  see?\"    \"Behind the steersman's cage is placed a powerful electric reflector,  the rays from which light up the sea for half a mile in front.\"    \"Ah! bravo, bravo, Captain!  Now I can account for this phosphorescence  in the supposed narwhal that puzzled us so.  I now ask you if the  boarding of the Nautilus and of the Scotia, that has made such a noise,  has been the result of a chance rencontre?\"    \"Quite accidental, sir.  I was sailing only one fathom below the  surface of the water when the shock came.  It had no bad result.\"    \"None, sir.  But now, about your rencontre with the Abraham Lincoln?\"    \"Professor, I am sorry for one of the best vessels in the American  navy; but they attacked me, and I was bound to defend myself.  I  contented myself, however, with putting the frigate hors de combat; she  will not have any difficulty in getting repaired at the next port.\"    \"Ah, Commander! your Nautilus is certainly a marvellous boat.\"    \"Yes, Professor; and I love it as if it were part of myself.  If danger  threatens one of your vessels on the ocean, the first impression is the  feeling of an abyss above and below.  On the Nautilus men's hearts  never fail them.  No defects to be afraid of, for the double shell is  as firm as iron; no rigging to attend to; no sails for the wind to  carry away; no boilers to burst; no fire to fear, for the vessel is  made of iron, not of wood; no coal to run short, for electricity is the  only mechanical agent; no collision to fear, for it alone swims in deep  water; no tempest to brave, for when it dives below the water it  reaches absolute tranquillity.  There, sir! that is the perfection of  vessels!  And if it is true that the engineer has more confidence in  the vessel than the builder, and the builder than the captain himself,  you understand the trust I repose in my Nautilus; for I am at once  captain, builder, and engineer.\"    \"But how could you construct this wonderful Nautilus in secret?\"    \"Each separate portion, M. Aronnax, was brought from different parts of  the globe.\"    \"But these parts had to be put together and arranged?\"    \"Professor, I had set up my workshops upon a desert island in the  ocean.  There my workmen, that is to say, the brave men that I  instructed and educated, and myself have put together our Nautilus.  Then, when the work was finished, fire destroyed all trace of our  proceedings on this island, that I could have jumped over if I had  liked.\"    \"Then the cost of this vessel is great?\"    \"M. Aronnax, an iron vessel costs L145 per ton.  Now the Nautilus  weighed 1,500. It came therefore to L67,500, and L80,000 more for  fitting it up, and about L200,000, with the works of art and the  collections it contains.\"    \"One last question, Captain Nemo.\"    \"Ask it, Professor.\"    \"You are rich?\"    \"Immensely rich, sir; and I could, without missing it, pay the national  debt of France.\"    I stared at the singular person who spoke thus.  Was he playing upon my  credulity?  The future would decide that.        CHAPTER XIII    THE BLACK RIVER    The portion of the terrestrial globe which is covered by water is  estimated at upwards of eighty millions of acres.  This fluid mass  comprises two billions two hundred and fifty millions of cubic miles,  forming a spherical body of a diameter of sixty leagues, the weight of  which would be three quintillions of tons.  To comprehend the meaning  of these figures, it is necessary to observe that a quintillion is to a  billion as a billion is to unity; in other words, there are as many  billions in a quintillion as there are units in a billion.  This mass  of fluid is equal to about the quantity of water which would be  discharged by all the rivers of the earth in forty thousand years.    During the geological epochs the ocean originally prevailed everywhere.  Then by degrees, in the silurian period, the tops of the mountains  began to appear, the islands emerged, then disappeared in partial  deluges, reappeared, became settled, formed continents, till at length  the earth became geographically arranged, as we see in the present day.  The solid had wrested from the liquid thirty-seven million six hundred  and fifty-seven square miles, equal to twelve billions nine hundred and  sixty millions of acres.    The shape of continents allows us to divide the waters into five great  portions:  the Arctic or Frozen Ocean, the Antarctic, or Frozen Ocean,  the Indian, the Atlantic, and the Pacific Oceans.    The Pacific Ocean extends from north to south between the two Polar  Circles, and from east to west between Asia and America, over an extent  of 145 degrees of longitude.  It is the quietest of seas; its currents  are broad and slow, it has medium tides, and abundant rain.  Such was  the ocean that my fate destined me first to travel over under these  strange conditions.    \"Sir,\" said Captain Nemo, \"we will, if you please, take our bearings  and fix the starting-point of this voyage.  It is a quarter to twelve;  I will go up again to the surface.\"    The Captain pressed an electric clock three times.  The pumps began to  drive the water from the tanks; the needle of the manometer marked by a  different pressure the ascent of the Nautilus, then it stopped.    \"We have arrived,\" said the Captain.    I went to the central staircase which opened on to the platform,  clambered up the iron steps, and found myself on the upper part of the  Nautilus.    The platform was only three feet out of water.  The front and back of  the Nautilus was of that spindle-shape which caused it justly to be  compared to a cigar.  I noticed that its iron plates, slightly  overlaying each other, resembled the shell which clothes the bodies of  our large terrestrial reptiles.  It explained to me how natural it was,  in spite of all glasses, that this boat should have been taken for a  marine animal.    Toward the middle of the platform the longboat, half buried in the hull  of the vessel, formed a slight excrescence.  Fore and aft rose two  cages of medium height with inclined sides, and partly closed by thick  lenticular glasses; one destined for the steersman who directed the  Nautilus, the other containing a brilliant lantern to give light on the  road.    The sea was beautiful, the sky pure.  Scarcely could the long vehicle  feel the broad undulations of the ocean.  A light breeze from the east  rippled the surface of the waters.  The horizon, free from fog, made  observation easy.  Nothing was in sight.  Not a quicksand, not an  island.  A vast desert.    Captain Nemo, by the help of his sextant, took the altitude of the sun,  which ought also to give the latitude.  He waited for some moments till  its disc touched the horizon.  Whilst taking observations not a muscle  moved, the instrument could not have been more motionless in a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410"],[0,"The Life-Story of Insects (#14)"],[1," growing all the time; the codling caterpillar completes its  growth in the autumn, and winters as a full-size resting larva; lastly,  the 'whites' hibernate in the pupal state. And in every case it is  noteworthy that the form or habit of the wintering stage is well adapted  for enduring cold.    Our native 'whites' afford illustration of another interesting feature  often to be noticed in the life-story of double-brooded Lepidoptera. The  butterflies of the spring brood differ slightly but constantly from  their summer offspring, affording examples of what is called _seasonal  dimorphism_. All three species have whitish wings marked with black  spots, larger and more numerous in the female than in the male. In the  spring butterflies these spots tend towards reduction or replacement by  grey, while in the summer insects they are more strongly defined, and  the ground colour of the wings varies towards yellowish. In the  'Green-veined' white (_Pieris napi_) the characteristic greenish-grey  lines of scaling beneath the wings along the nervures, are much broader  and more strongly marked in the spring than in the summer generation,  whose members are distinguished by systematic entomologists under the  varietal name _napaeae_. The two forms of this insect were discussed by  A. Weismann in his classical work on the Seasonal Dimorphism of  butterflies (1876). He tried the effect of artificially induced cold  conditions on the summer pupae of _Pieris napi_, and by keeping a batch  for three months at the temperature of freezing water, he succeeded in  completely changing every individual of the summer generation into the  winter form. The reverse of this experiment also was attempted by  Weismann. He took a female of _bryoniae_, an alpine and arctic variety  of _Pieris napi_, showing in an intensive degree the characters of the  spring brood. This female laid eggs the caterpillars from which fed and  pupated. The pupae although kept through the summer in a hothouse all  produced typical _bryoniae_, and none of these with one exception  appeared until the next year, for in the alpine and arctic regions this  species is only single-brooded. Weismann experimented also with a small  vanessid butterfly, _Araschnia levana_, common on the European  continent, though unknown in our islands, which is double (or at times  treble) brooded, its spring form (_levana_) alternating with a larger  and more brightly coloured summer form (_prorsa_). Here again by  refrigerating the summer pupae, butterflies were reared most of which  approached the winter pattern, but it was impossible by heating the  winter pupae to change _levana_ into _prorsa_. Experiments with North  American dimorphic species have given similar results. Weismann argued  from these experiments that the winter form of these seasonally  dimorphic species is in all cases the older, and that the butterflies  developing within the summer pupae can be made to revert to the  ancestral condition by repeating the low-temperature stimulus which  always prevailed during the geologically recent Ice Age. On the other  hand, a high temperature stimulus applied to one generation of the  winter pupae cannot induce the change into the summer pattern, which has  been evolved still more recently by slow stages, as the continental  climate has become more genial. In tropical countries where instead of  an alternation of winter and summer, alternate dry and rainy seasons  prevail, somewhat similar seasonal dimorphism has been observed among  many butterflies. Not a few forms of Precis, an African and Indian genus  allied to our Vanessa, that had long been considered distinct species  are now known, thanks to the researches of G.A.K. Marshall (1898), to be  alternating seasonal forms of the same insect. The offspring when adult  does not closely resemble the parent; its appearance is modified by the  climatic environment of the pupa. The experiments of Weismann just  sketched in outline show at least that the same principle holds for our  northern butterflies.    We are thus led to see from the life-story of such insects, that the  course of the story is not rigidly fixed; the creature in its various  stages is plastic, open to influence from its surroundings, capable of  marked change in the course of generations. And so the seasonal changes  in the history of the individual from egg to imago point us to changes  in the age-long history of the race.          CHAPTER IX    PAST AND PRESENT; THE MEANING OF THE STORY      In the previous chapter we recognised how the seasonal changes in  various species of butterflies as observable in two or three  generations, indicate changes in the history of the race as it might be  traced through innumerable generations. The endless variety in the form  and habits of insect-larvae and their adaptations to various modes of  life, which have been briefly sketched in this little book, suggest  vaster changes in the class of insects, as a whole, through the long  periods of geological time. Every student of life, influenced by the  teaching of Charles Darwin (1859) and his successors, now regards all  groups of animals from the evolutionary standpoint, and believes that  comparisons of facts of structure and life-history of orders and classes  evidently akin to each other, furnish at least some indications of the  course of development in the greater systematic divisions, even as the  facts of seasonal dimorphism, mentioned in the last chapter, give hints  as to the course of development in those restricted groups that we call  species or varieties. A brief discussion of the main outlines of the  life-story of insects in the wide, evolutionary sense may thus fitly  conclude this book.    In the first place we turn to the 'records' of those rocks, in whose  stratified layers[12] are entombed remains, often fragmentary and  obscure, of the insects of past ages of the earth's history. Compared  with the thousands of extinct types of hard-shelled marine animals, such  as the Mollusca, fossil insects are few, as could only be expected,  seeing that insects are terrestrial and aerial creatures with slight  chance of preservation in sediments formed under water. Yet a number of  insect remains are now known to naturalists, who are, in this  connection, more particularly indebted to the researches of S.H. Scudder  (1885), C. Brongniart (1894), and A. Handlirsch (1906).    [12] See Table of Geological Systems, p. 123.    We are now considering insects from the standpoint of their  life-histories, and the individual life-story of an insect of which we  possess but a few fragments of wings or body, entombed in a rock formed  possibly before the period of the Coal Measures, can only be a matter of  inference. Still it may safely be inferred that when the structure of  these remains clearly indicates affinity to some existing order or  family, the life-history of the extinct creature must have resembled, on  the whole, that of its nearest living allies. And all the fossil  insects known can be either referred to existing orders, or shown to  indicate definite relationship to some existing group.    Passing over some doubtful remains of Silurian age, we find in rocks  usually regarded as Devonian[13] the most ancient fossils that can be  certainly referred to the insects, while from beds of the succeeding  Carboniferous period, a number of insect remains have been disinterred.  These Palaeozoic insects were frequently of large size, and they show  distinct affinities with our recent may-flies, dragon-flies,  stone-flies, and cockroaches. In the Permian period, the latest of the  divisions of the Palaeozoic, lived Eugereon, an insect with hemipteroid  jaws and orthopteroid wings. All these insects must have been  exopterygote in their life-history, if we may trust the indications of  affinity furnished by their structure. In the Mesozoic period, however,  insects with complete transformations must have been fairly abundant.  Rocks of Triassic age have yielded beetles and lacewing-flies, while  from among Jurassic fossils specimens have been described as  representing most of our existing orders, including Lepidoptera,  Hymenoptera and Diptera. In Cainozoic rocks fossil insects of nearly six  thousand species have been found, which are easily referable to  existing families and often to existing genera. We may conclude then,  imperfect though our knowledge of extinct insects is, that some of the  most complex of insect life-stories were being worked out before the  dawn of the Cainozoic era. Some instructive hints as to differences in  the rate of change among different insect groups may be drawn from the  study of parasites. For example, V.L. Kellogg (1913) points out that an  identical species of the Mallophaga (Bird-lice) infests an Australian  Cassowary and two of the South American Rheas; while two species of the  same genus (Lipeurus) are common to the African Ostrich and a third kind  of South American Rhea. These parasites must have been inherited  unchanged by the various members of these three families of flightless  birds from their common ancestors, that is from early Cainozoic times at  latest. On the other hand, the various kinds of such highly specialised  parasites as the warble-flies of the oxen and deer, must have become  differentiated during those later stages of the Cainozoic period which  witnessed the evolution of their respective mammalian hosts.    [13] The 'Little River' beds of St John, New Brunswick, Canada, by some  modern geologists however considered as Carboniferous.    The foregoing brief outline of our knowledge of the geological  succession of insects shows that the exopterygote preceded, in time, the  endopterygote type of life-history. We have already seen that those  insects undergoing little change in the life-cycle, and with visible,  external wing-rudiments, are on the whole less specialised in structure  than those which"]]]
