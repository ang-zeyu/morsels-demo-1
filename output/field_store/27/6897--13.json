[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18222"],[0,"The Religion of Numa (#14)"],[1,"must begin quite a distance back.    Taken as a whole, religious beliefs are among the most conservative  things in the world; the individual may grow as radical as you please,  but his effect on the general religious consciousness of his time is  extremely slight. Occasionally the number of radical individuals grows  larger and certain classes of society are affected by their views, but  even, in the periods of religious development which we are apt to think  of as most iconoclastic, society taken in the large, and on the average  of all classes, is not much more radical than in apparently normal  times. And while religion as a whole is conservative, there is one  section of it more conservative than all the rest, a section from which  change is almost excluded, that is the beliefs concerning the dead. In  our discussion of the religion of Numa we saw the very primitive  character of Roman beliefs in this field, the firm retention of the old  animistic idea of the dead, the tendency to class the dead together as a  mass and to believe in a collective rather than an individual  immortality, and above all the abhorrence of the dead and the  disinclination to dwell on their condition and to paint imaginary  pictures of life beyond the grave. In view of these feelings it is not  strange that we have great difficulty in finding any old Roman gods of  the dead, aside from the dead who are themselves all gods. These dead as  gods (_Di Manes_) and possibly Mother Earth (_Terra Mater_) are the only  rulers in the Lower World. In Greece on the contrary death was almost as  natural as life, and though the conditions in early times were not  unlike those in Rome, as Rohde in his _Psyche_ has so wonderfully  described them, the Greek soon grew beyond this, and the world of the  dead became almost as well known to him as the world of the living.  There was a kingdom of the dead, and a king and queen ruled over them.  These rulers were called by different names in different parts of  Greece, but the names which they had in certain parts of the  Peloponnesus, Hades the king of the dead and Persephone his bride, were  destined to survive the rest. The cult of this royal pair travelled far  and wide, but its most notable development occurred in Attica, where  Persephone became Kore the daughter of Demeter, stolen by Hades to  become his bride, while Hades himself under the sunny skies of Athens  lost some of his terrors and became Pluto, the god of riches, especially  the rich blessings of the earth. But all this was very foreign to Rome,  and while the Greeks were thinking these thoughts, the Romans were going  quietly along, content with their simple _Di Manes_. No better proof of  this can be desired than the one accidentally given us in the  introduction of Demeter and her daughter Kore into Rome as Ceres and  Libera in B.C. 493, and the absolute colourlessness and pointlessness of  Libera, in a word the entire lack of connexion in the religious  consciousness of Rome between Libera and Persephone. But in B.C. 249,  almost two and a half centuries later, matters were on a different  basis; Rome had been learning a great deal that was foreign to her old  beliefs, and there was no longer anything impossible to her in the idea  of individual rulers of the dead. Thus at the command of the books Pluto  and Persephone were received into the state-cult, though the strangeness  of the situation was acknowledged, at least in so far that they  translated Pluto into the Latin Dis; Persephone to be sure was left  alone, or more strictly speaking was accommodated to the Latin tongue by  being changed to Proserpina. It is of course impossible that the Romans  of B.C. 249 were entirely ignorant of Pluto and Persephone until the  Sibylline books bade them be brought in. Here again the traders from  Southern Italy had been their teachers; and the name _Tarentum_ of the  altar where the sacrifice was to be made may possibly indicate the town  of Tarentum as the source of the cult. The Romans knew Tarentum only too  well since the eventful war with Pyrrhus, which lay only a generation  back in their history.    And so the Romans adopted the Greek gods of the dead, and thus, at least  theoretically, put their dead ancestors into subjection to the Greeks  just as they themselves, the descendants, were sitting at the feet of  the Greeks in this life. But though the enactment of the Senate gave  these gods Roman citizenship, and the priests of the Sibylline books  were in duty bound to perform the ritual of the cult, be it said to the  credit of the Romans, the gods themselves never took a very deep hold of  the religious life of the people in general. Their names, to be sure,  crept into a few of the old formulae and stood side by side with the  older deities, and Proserpina was made much of by the Roman poets; but  the real tests of devotion, dedicatory inscriptions, are almost entirely  absent. Strangely enough the only thing which seems to have caught  their fancy was the weird ritual of the nightly sacrifice at the  Tarentum, and especially its repetition after one hundred years. This  idea of the hundred years is Roman rather than Greek, and it is at least  open to question whether it may not have been added to the instructions  in the oracle to give the whole matter an added Roman colour. Thus in  B.C. 249 were instituted the Secular Games, which were repeated with  approximate accuracy in B.C. 146, and would doubtless have been again  between B.C. 49 and 46, had not the Civil War completely filled men's  minds and made human sacrifices to the dead, in battle, an almost daily  occurrence. Meantime the Roman annalists were working backwards in their  own peculiar fashion, and building out into the past a series of  fictitious celebrations preceding B.C. 249, one hundred years apart,  back into the time of the kingdom. On the other hand we shall have  occasion later to speak of the restoration of the games and their  reorganisation by Augustus.    Under the test of adversity nations are very much like individuals, and  a national weakness, which is often entirely concealed in normal  conditions, comes prominently and disastrously to the surface in the  hour when strength is most needed. The war with Hannibal was just such a  crisis in Rome's history, and under its influence Rome's dependence upon  the Sibylline books was more pronounced than ever. The seeds of  superstition sown during the earlier centuries burst now into full  blossom, destined to produce the fruit, the gathering of which was to be  the bitter task of the closing centuries of the republic. The story of  the Second Punic War, regarded merely from the military standpoint,  reads for Rome almost like a nightmare, with its long succession of  apparently easy victories turning one by one into defeats; but when we  add to this that other chronicle, of which Livy is equally fond, the  long lists of portents and prodigies sent by the angered gods, and when  we realise that to the masses of the people the wrath of the gods was  more terrible and just as real as the hostility of Hannibal, then we  have not the heart to reproach them for their religious frenzy. Seen by  themselves, the jumping of a cow out of a second-story window, or the  images of the gods shedding tears, do not seem very serious matters, but  endow us with three hundred years of hereditary dread of these things,  give us the instinctive interpretation of them as the turning away from  us of the powers upon which we rely for help, nay their positive  opposition to us and our hopes--and our condition in the presence of  these phenomena would be very different.    Thus almost every year between B.C. 218 and 201 had its share of  religious ceremonial, and the Sibylline books, which had hitherto been,  in theory at least, merely an alternative method of religious procedure  permitted to exist alongside of the older and more conservative forms,  became now the order of the day. Like a Homeric picture in which the  quarrels of the gods in Olympus run parallel to the battles of Greeks  and Trojans on the plains of Troy, so every victory which Rome won over  Hannibal on the field of battle was bought at the price of a victory of  Greek gods over Roman gods in the field of religion; and further,  although Rome succeeded in keeping Hannibal outside of her own walls,  her gods did not succeed in defending the _pomerium_ against the Greek  gods, and it is during this Second Punic War that this, the greatest  safeguard of old Roman religion and customs, was broken down, and the  new gods gained entire possession of the city, placing their temples on  the spots hitherto held most sacred. From now on all distinction ceases,  and it is scarcely possible to speak of a Roman in contrast to a  Graeco-Roman cult. It is important however to observe that this  breakdown occurred because of excess of religious zeal rather than  through neglect and indifference, and though we may indeed notice a  gradual deterioration of the deities introduced by the books, all the  way down from the busy working gods like Ceres and Mercury and Neptune  to the more miraculous Aesculapius, and the cult of Dis or Proserpina  with its possibilities of weird fantastic worship, there have been  however as yet only scanty traces of the orgiastic element. But this was  the next step, and it was not long in coming. The rapid campaigns of the  earlier years of the war with Hannibal had passed, Cannae (B.C. 216) had  been somewhat retrieved by Metaurus (B.C. 207), where the reinforcements  for Hannibal, led by Hasdrubal, had been cut to pieces, but the result  was not what had been hoped for, and Hannibal had not left Italy, but  entrenched in the mountains of the south he seemed to be preparing to  pass the rest of his life there. It was in this the year B.C. 205 that  the help of the books was again sought, if peradventure they might show  the way to drive"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18233"],[0,"Animal Ghosts; Or, Animal Hauntings and the Hereafter (#14)"],[1,".\"    I did not know what to say. My conscience pricked me. Without a doubt I  ought to have told my wife of my own experience in the lane, and have  consulted her before taking the house. Supposing she, or any of the  children, should die of fright, it would be my fault. I should never  forgive myself.    \"You've something on your mind! What is it?\" my wife demanded.    I hesitated a moment or two and then told her. The next quarter of an  hour was one I do not care to recollect, but when it was over, and she  had had her say, it was decided I should make enquiries and see if there  was any possible way of getting rid of the ghosts. With this end in  view, I drove to the town, and after several fruitless efforts was at  length introduced to a Mr. Marsden, clerk of one of the banks, who, in  reply to my questions, said:    \"Well, Mr. B----, it's just this way. I do know something, only--in a  small place like this--one has to be so extra careful what one says.  Some years ago a Mr. Jeremiah Dance occupied the Crow's Nest. He came  here apparently a total stranger, and though often in the town, was only  seen in the company of one person--his landlord, Mr. Baldwin, with  whom--if local gossip is to be relied on--he appeared to be on terms of  the greatest familiarity. Indeed, they were seldom apart, walked about  the lanes arm-in-arm, visited each other's houses on alternate evenings,  called each other \"Teddy\" and \"Leslie.\" This state of things continued  for nearly three years, and then people suddenly began to comment on the  fact that Mr. Dance had gone, or at least was no longer visible. An  errand-boy, returning back to town, late one evening, swore to being  passed on the way by a trap containing Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Dance, who  were speaking in very loud voices--just as if they were having a violent  altercation. On reaching that part of the road where the trees are  thickest overhead, the lad overtook them, or rather Mr. Baldwin,  preparing to mount into the trap. Mr. Dance was nowhere to be seen. And  from that day to this nothing has ever been heard of him. As none of his  friends or relations came forward to raise enquiries, and all his bills  were paid--several of them by Mr. Baldwin--no one took the matter up.  Mr. Baldwin pooh-poohed the errand-boy's story, and declared that, on  the night in question, he had been alone in an altogether different part  of the county, and knew nothing whatever of Mr. Dance's movements,  further than that he had recently announced his intention of leaving the  Crow's Nest before the expiration of the three years' lease. He had not  the remotest idea where he was. He claimed the furniture in payment of  the rent due to him.\"    \"Did the matter end there?\" I asked.    \"In one sense of the word, yes--in another, no. Within a few weeks of  Dance's disappearance rumours got afloat that his ghost had been seen on  the road, just where, you may say, you saw it. As a matter of fact, I've  seen it myself--and so have crowds of other people.\"    \"Has anyone ever spoken to it?\"    \"Yes--and it has vanished at once. I went there one night with the  purpose of laying it, but, on its appearing suddenly, I confess I was so  startled, that I not only forgot what I had rehearsed to say, but ran  home, without uttering as much as a word.\"    \"And what are your deductions of the case?\"    \"The same as everyone else's,\" Mr. Marsden whispered, \"only, like  everyone else, I dare not say.\"    \"Had Mr. Dance any dogs?\"    \"Yes--two poodles, of which, much to Mr. Baldwin's annoyance (everyone  noticed this), he used to make the most ridiculous fuss.\"    \"Humph!\" I observed. \"That settles it! Ghosts! And to think I never  believed in them before! Well, I am going to try.\"    \"Try what?\" Mr. Marsden said, a note of alarm in his voice.    \"Try laying it. I have an idea I may succeed.\"    \"I wish you luck, then. May I come with you?\"    \"Thanks, no!\" I rejoined. \"I would rather go there alone.\"    I said this in a well-lighted room, with the hum of a crowded  thoroughfare in my ears. Twenty minutes later, when I had left all that  behind, and was fast approaching the darkest part of an exceptionally  dark road, I wished I had not. At the very spot, where I had previously  seen the figures, I saw them now. They suddenly appeared by my side, and  though I was going at a great rate--for the horse took fright--they kept  easy pace with me. Twice I essayed to speak to them, but could not  ejaculate a syllable through sheer horror, and it was only by nerving  myself to the utmost, and forcing my eyes away from them, that I was  able to stick to my seat and hold on to the reins. On and on we dashed,  until trees, road, sky, universe were obliterated in one blinding  whirlwind that got up my nostrils, choked my ears, and deadened me to  everything, save the all-terrorizing, instinctive knowledge, that the  figures by my side, were still there, stalking along as quietly and  leisurely as if the horse had been going at a snail's pace.    At last, to my intense relief--for never had the ride seemed longer--I  reached the Crow's Nest, and as I hurriedly dismounted from the trap,  the figures shot past me and vanished. Once inside the house, and in the  bosom of my family, where all was light and laughter, courage returned,  and I upbraided myself bitterly for this cowardice.    I confessed to my wife, and she insisted on accompanying me the  following afternoon, at twilight, to the spot where the ghost appeared  to originate. To our intense dismay, we had not been there more than  three or four minutes, before Dora, our youngest girl, a pretty,  sweet-tempered child of eight, came running up to us with a telegram,  which one of the servants had asked her to give us. My wife, snatching  it from her, and reading it, was about to scold her severely, when she  suddenly paused, and clutching hold of the child with one hand, pointed  hysterically at something on one side of her with the other. I looked,  and Dora looked, and we both saw, standing erect and staring at us, the  spare figure of a man, with a ghastly white face and dull, lifeless  eyes, clad in a panama hat, albert coat, and small, patent-leather  boots; beside him were two glossy--abnormally glossy--poodles.    I tried to speak, but, as before, was too frightened to articulate a  sound, and my wife was in the same plight. With Dora, however, it was  otherwise, and she electrified us by going up to the figure, and  exclaiming:    \"Who are you? You must feel very ill to look so white. Tell me your  name.\"    The figure made no reply, but gliding slowly forward, moved up to a  large, isolated oak, and pointing with the index finger of its left hand  at the trunk of the tree, seemingly sank into the earth and vanished  from view.    For some seconds everyone was silent, and then my wife exclaimed:    \"Jack, I shouldn't wonder if Dora hasn't been the means of solving the  mystery. Examine the tree closely.\"    I did so. The tree was hollow, and inside it were three skeletons!           *       *       *       *       *    Here followed an extract from a local paper:      \"_Sensational Discovery in a Wood near Marytown_    \"Whilst exploring in a wood, near Marytown, the other evening, a party  of the name of B---- discovered three skeletons--a human being and two  dogs--in the trunk of an oak. From the remnant of clothes still  adhering to the human remains, the latter were proved to be those of an  individual known as Mr. Jeremiah Dance, whose strange disappearance from  the Crow's Nest--the house he rented in the neighbourhood--some two  years ago, was the occasion of much comment. On closer examination,  extraordinary to relate, the remains have been proved to be those of a  WOMAN; and from certain abrasions on the skull, there is little doubt  she met with a violent end.\"    A second extract taken from the same paper runs thus:--      \"_Suicide at Marytown_    \"Late last night Percy Baldwin, the man who is under arrest on suspicion  of having caused the death of the unknown woman, whose skeleton was  found on Monday in the trunk of a tree, committed suicide by hanging  himself with his suspenders to the ceiling of his cell. Pinned on his  coat was a slip of paper bearing these words: 'She was my wife--I loved  her. She took to drink--I parted from her. She became a dog-worshipper.  I killed her--and her dogs.'\"      _Phantasms of Living Dogs_    I could quote innumerable cases of people who have either seen or heard  the spirits of dead dogs. However, as space does not permit of this, I  proceed to the oft-raised question, \"Do animals as well as people  project themselves?\" My reply is--yes; according to my experience they  do.    Some friends of mine have a big tabby that has frequently been seen in  two places at the same time; for example, it has been observed by  several people to be sitting on a chair in the dining-room, and, at the  same moment, it has been seen by two or more other persons extended at  full length before the kitchen fire--the latter figure proving to be its  immaterial, or what some designate its astral body, which vanishes the  instant an attempt is made to touch it. The only explanation of this  phenomenon seems to me to lie in projection--the cat possessing the  faculty of separating--in this instance, unconsciously--its spiritual  from its physical body--the former travelling anywhere, regardless of  space, time and material obstacles. I have often had experiences similar  to this with a friend's dog. I have been seated in a room, either  reading or writing, and on looking up have distinctly seen the dog lying  on the carpet in front of me. A few minutes later a scraping at the door  or window--both of which have been shut all the while--and on my rising  to see what was there, I have discovered the dog outside! Had I not been  so positive I had seen the dog on the ground in front of me, I might  have thought it was an"]]]
