I will marry a wife as  beautiful as the houries, and wise as Zobeide; and with her I will live  twenty years within the suburbs of Bagdad, in every pleasure that wealth  can purchase, and fancy can invent.    \" 'I will then retire to a rural dwelling, pass my days in obscurity and  contemplation; and lie silently down on the bed of death.

Such was my scheme of life, which I impressed indelibly upon my  memory.    \"The first part of my ensuing time was to be spent in search of knowledge,  and I know not how I was diverted from my design. I had no visible  impediments without, nor any ungovernable passion within. I regarded  knowledge as the highest honor, and the most engaging pleasure; yet day  stole upon day, and month glided after month, till I found that seven  years of the first ten had vanished, and left nothing behind them.    \"I now postponed my purpose of traveling; for why should I go abroad,  while so much remained to be learned at home? I immured myself for four  years, and studied the laws of the empire. The fame of my skill reached  the judges: I was found able to speak upon doubtful questions, and I was  commanded to stand at the footstool of the caliph. I was heard with  attention; I was consulted with confidence, and the love of praise  fastened on my heart.    \"I still wished to see distant countries; listened with rapture to the  relations of travelers, and resolved some time to ask my dismission, that  I might feast my soul with novelty; but my presence was always necessary,  and the stream of business hurried me along. Sometimes, I was afraid lest  I should be charged with ingratitude; but I still proposed to travel, and  therefore would not confine myself by marriage.    \"In my fiftieth year, I began to suspect that the time of my traveling was  past; and thought it best to lay hold on the felicity yet in my power, and  indulge myself in domestic pleasures. But, at fifty, no man easily finds a  woman beautiful as the houries, and wise as Zobeide. I inquired and  rejected, consulted and deliberated, till the sixty-second year made me  ashamed of wishing to marry. I had now nothing left but retirement; and  for retirement I never found a time, till disease forced me from public  employment.    \"Such was my scheme, and such has been its consequence. With an insatiable  thirst for knowledge, I trifled away the years of improvement; with a  restless desire of seeing different countries, I have always resided in  the same city; with the highest expectation of connubial felicity, I have  lived unmarried; and with an unalterable resolution of contemplative  retirement, I am going to die within the walls of Bagdad.\"      Notes.--Bag dad'--A large city of Asiatic Turkey, on the river Tigris.

VIII. THE BRAVE OLD OAK. (81)    Henry Fothergill Chorley, 1808-1872. He is known chiefly as a musical  critic and author; for thirty-eight years he was connected with the  \"London Athenaeum.\" His books are mostly novels.  ###      A song to the oak, the brave old oak,    Who hath ruled in the greenwood long;  Here's health and renown to his broad green crown,    And his fifty arms so strong.  There's fear in his frown, when the sun goes down,    And the fire in the west fades out;  And he showeth his might on a wild midnight,    When the storms through his branches shout.    In the days of old, when the spring with cold    Had brightened his branches gray,  Through the grass at his feet, crept maidens sweet,    To gather the dews of May.  And on that day, to the rebec gay    They frolicked with lovesome swains;  They are gone, they are dead, in the churchyard laid,    But the tree--it still remains.    He saw rare times when the Christmas chimes    Were a merry sound to hear,  When the Squire's wide hall and the cottage small    Were filled with good English cheer.  Now gold hath the sway we all obey,    And a ruthless king is he;  But he never shall send our ancient friend    To be tossed on the stormy sea.    Then here's to the oak, the brave old oak,    Who stands in his pride alone;  And still flourish he, a hale green tree,    When a hundred years are gone.      IX. THE ARTIST SURPRISED. (82)    It may not be known to all the admirers of the genius of Albert Durer,  that that famous engraver was endowed with a \"better half,\" so peevish in  temper, that she was the torment not only of his own life, but also of his  pupils and domestics. Some of the former were cunning enough to purchase  peace for themselves by conciliating the common tyrant, but woe to those  unwilling or unable to offer aught in propitiation. Even the wiser ones  were spared only by having their offenses visited upon a scapegoat.    This unfortunate individual was Samuel Duhobret, a disciple whom Durer had  admitted into his school out of charity. He was employed in painting signs  and the coarser tapestry then used in Germany. He was about forty years of  age, little, ugly, and humpbacked; he was the butt of every ill joke among  his fellow disciples, and was picked out as an object of especial dislike  by Madame Durer. But he bore all with patience, and ate, without  complaint, the scanty crusts given him every day for dinner, while his  companions often fared sumptuously.    Poor Samuel had not a spice of envy or malice in his heart. He would, at  any time, have toiled half the night to assist or serve those who were  wont oftenest to laugh at him, or abuse him loudest for his stupidity.  True, he had not the qualities of social humor or wit, but he was an  example of indefatigable industry. He came to his studies every morning at  daybreak, and remained at work until sunset. Then he retired into his  lonely chamber, and wrought for his own amusement.    Duhobret labored three years in this way, giving himself no time for  exercise or recreation. He said nothing to a single human being of the  paintings he had produced in the solitude of his cell, by the light of his  lamp. But his bodily energies wasted and declined under incessant toil.  There was none sufficiently interested in the poor artist, to mark the  feverish hue of his wrinkled cheek, or the increasing attenuation of his  misshapen frame.    None observed that the uninviting pittance set aside for his midday  repast, remained for several days untouched. Samuel made his appearance  regularly as ever, and bore with the same meekness the gibes of his  fellow-pupils, or the taunts of Madame Durer, and worked with the same  untiring assiduity, though his hands would sometimes tremble, and his eyes  become suffused, a weakness probably owing to the excessive use he had  made of them.    One morning Duhobret was missing at the scene of his daily labors. His  absence created much remark, and many were the jokes passed upon the  occasion. One surmised this, and another that, as the cause of the  phenomenon; and it was finally agreed that the poor fellow must have  worked himself into an absolute skeleton, and taken his final stand in the  glass frame of some apothecary, or been blown away by a puff of wind,  while his door happened to stand open. No on thought of going to his  lodgings to look after him or his remains.    Meanwhile, the object of their mirth was tossing on a bed of sickness.  Disease, which had been slowly sapping the foundations of his strength,  burned in every vein; his eyes rolled and flashed in delirium; his lips,  usually so silent, muttered wild and incoherent words. In his days of  health, poor Duhobret had his dreams, as all artists, rich or poor, will  sometimes have. He had thought that the fruit of many years' labor,  disposed of to advantage, might procure him enough to live, in an  economical way, for the rest of his life. He never anticipated fame or  fortune; the height of his ambition or hope was, to possess a tenement  large enough to shelter him from the inclemencies of the weather, with  means enough to purchase one comfortable meal per day.    Now, alas! however, even that one hope had deserted him. He thought  himself dying, and thought it hard to die without one to look kindly upon  him, without the words of comfort that might soothe his passage to another  world. He fancied his bed surrounded by fiendish faces, grinning at his  sufferings, and taunting his inability to summon power to disperse them.  At length the apparition faded away, and the patient sunk into an  exhausted slumber.    He awoke unrefreshed; it was the fifth day he had lain there neglected.  His mouth was parched; he turned over, and feebly stretched out his hand  toward the earthen pitcher, from which, since the first day of his illness  he had quenched his thirst. Alas! it was empty! Samuel lay for a few  moments thinking what he should do. He knew he must die of want if he  remained there alone; but to whom could he apply for aid?    An idea seemed, at last, to strike him. He arose slowly, and with  difficulty, from the bed, went to the other side of the room, and took up  the picture he had painted last. He resolved to carry it to the shop of a  salesman, and hoped to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16767"],[0,"Half-hours with the Telescope (#14)"],[1," yet  extended, it would seem to be the nearest to us of all stars visible in  the northern hemisphere. It is a fine double, the components nearly  equal (5-1/2 and 6), both yellow, and nearly 19\" apart. The period of  this binary appears to be about 540 years. To find 61 Cygni note that  [epsilon] and [delta] Cygni form the diameter of a semicircle divided  into two quadrants by [alpha] Cygni (Arided). On this semicircle, on  either side of [alpha], lie the stars [nu] and [alpha] Cygni, [nu]  towards [epsilon]. Now a line from [alpha] to [nu] produced passes very  near to 61 Cygni at a distance from [nu] somewhat greater than half the  distance of [nu] from [alpha].    The star [mu] Cygni lies in a corner of the constellation, rather  farther from [zeta] than [zeta] from [epsilon] Cygni. A line from  [epsilon] to [zeta] produced meets [kappa] Pegasi, a fourth-magnitude  star; and [mu] Cygni, a fifth-magnitude star, lies close above [kappa]  Pegasi. The distance between the components is about 5-1/2\", their  magnitudes 5 and 6, their colours white and pale blue.    The star [psi] Cygni may next be looked for, but for this a good map of  Cygnus will be wanted, as [psi] is not pointed to by any well-marked  stars. A line from [alpha], parallel to the line joining [gamma] and  [delta], and about one-third longer than that line, would about mark the  position of [psi] Cygni. The distance between the components of this  double is about 3-1/2\", their magnitudes 5-1/2 and 8, their colours  white and lilac.    Lastly, the observer may turn to the stars [gamma]_{1} and [gamma]_{2}  Draconis towards the north-west about 40 deg. above the horizon (they are  included in the second map of Plate 2). They form a wide double, having  equal (fifth-magnitude) components, both grey. (See Plate 5.)          CHAPTER VI.    HALF-HOURS WITH THE PLANETS.      In observing the stars, we can select a part of the heavens which may be  conveniently observed; and in this way in the course of a year we can  observe every part of the heavens visible in our northern hemisphere.  But with the planets the case is not quite so simple. They come into  view at no fixed season of the year: some of them can never be seen _by  night_ on the meridian; and they all shift their place among the stars,  so that we require some method of determining where to look for them on  any particular night, and of recognising them from neighbouring fixed  stars.    The regular observer will of course make use of the 'Nautical Almanac';  but 'Dietrichsen and Hannay's Almanac' will serve every purpose of the  amateur telescopist. I will briefly describe those parts of the almanac  which are useful to the observer.    It will be found that three pages are assigned to each month, each page  giving different information. If we call these pages I. II. III., then  in order that page I. for each month may fall to the left of the open  double page, and also that I. and II. may be open together, the pages  are arranged in the following order: I. II. III.; III. I. II.; I. II.  III.; and so on.    Now page III. for any month does not concern the amateur observer. It  gives information concerning the moon's motions, which is valuable to  the sailor, and interesting to the student of astronomy, but not  applicable to amateur observation.    [Illustration: PLATE VI.]    We have then only pages I. and II. to consider:--    Across the top of both pages the right ascension and declination of the  planets Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Mercury, and Uranus are given,  accompanied by those of two conspicuous stars. This information is very  valuable to the telescopist. In the first place, as we shall presently  see, it shows him what planets are well situated for observation, and  secondly it enables him to map down the path of any planet from day to  day among the fixed stars. This is a very useful exercise, by the way,  and also a very instructive one. The student may either make use of the  regular maps and mark down the planet's path in pencil, taking a light  curve through the points given by the data in his almanac, or he may lay  down a set of meridians suited to the part of the heavens traversed by  the planet, and then proceed to mark in the planet's path and the stars,  taking the latter either from his maps or from a convenient list of  stars.[9] My 'Handbook of the Stars' has been constructed to aid the  student in these processes. It must be noticed that old maps are not  suited for the work, because, through precession, the stars are all out  of place as respects R.A. and Dec. Even the Society's maps, constructed  so as to be right for 1830, are beginning to be out of date. But a  matter of 20 or 30 years either way is not important.[10] My Maps,  Handbook and Zodiac-chart have been constructed for the year 1880, so as  to be serviceable for the next fifty years or so.    Next, below the table of the planets, we have a set of vertical  columns. These are, in order, the days of the month, the calendar--in  which are included some astronomical notices, amongst others the  diameter of Saturn on different dates, the hours at which the sun rises  and sets, the sun's right ascension, declination, diameter, and  longitude; then eight columns which do not concern the observer; after  which come the hours at which the moon rises and sets, the moon's age;  and lastly (so far as the observer is concerned) an important column  about Jupiter's system of satellites.    Next, we have, at the foot of the first page, the hours at which the  planets rise, south, and set; and at the foot of the second page we have  the dates of conjunctions, oppositions, and of other phenomena, the  diameters of Venus, Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury, and finally a few words  respecting the visibility of these four planets.    After the thirty-six pages assigned to the months follow four (pp.  42-46) in which much important astronomical information is contained;  but the points which most concern our observer are (i.) a small table  showing the appearance of Saturn's rings, and (ii.) a table giving the  hours at which Jupiter's satellites are occulted or eclipsed, re-appear,  &c.    We will now take the planets in the order of their distance from the  sun: we shall see that the information given by the almanac is very  important to the observer.    Mercury is so close to the sun as to be rarely seen with the naked eye,  since he never sets much more than two hours and a few minutes after the  sun, or rises by more than that interval before the sun. It must not be  supposed that at each successive epoch of most favourable appearance  Mercury sets so long after the sun or rises so long before him. It would  occupy too much of our space to enter into the circumstances which  affect the length of these intervals. The question, in fact, is not a  very simple one. All the necessary information is given in the almanac.  We merely notice that the planet is most favourably seen as an evening  star in spring, and as a morning star in autumn.[11]    The observer with an equatorial has of course no difficulty in finding  Mercury, since he can at once direct his telescope to the proper point  of the heavens. But the observer with an alt-azimuth might fail for  years together in obtaining a sight of this interesting planet, if he  trusted to unaided naked-eye observations in looking for him. Copernicus  never saw Mercury, though he often looked for him; and Mr. Hind tells me  he has seen the planet but once with the naked eye--though this perhaps  is not a very remarkable circumstance, since the systematic worker in an  observatory seldom has occasion to observe objects with the unaided eye.    By the following method the observer can easily pick up the planet.    Across two uprights (Fig. 10) nail a straight rod, so that when looked  at from some fixed point of view the rod may correspond to the sun's  path near the time of observation. The rod should be at right-angles to  the line of sight to its centre. Fasten another rod at right angles to  the first. From the point at which the rods cross measure off and mark  on both rods spaces each subtending a degree as seen from the point of  view. Thus, if the point of view is 9-1/2 feet off, these spaces must  each be 2 inches long, and they must be proportionately less or greater  as the eye is nearer or farther.    [Illustration: _Fig. 10._]    Now suppose the observer wishes to view Mercury on some day, whereon  Mercury is an evening star. Take, for instance, June 9th, 1868. We find  from 'Dietrichsen' that on this day (at noon) Mercury's R.A. is 6h. 53m.  23s.: and the sun's 5h. 11m. 31s. We need not trouble ourselves about  the odd hours after noon, and thus we have Mercury's R.A. greater than  the sun's by 1h. 41m. 52s. Now we will suppose that the observer has so  fixed his uprights and the two rods, that the sun, seen from the fixed  point of view, appears to pass the point of crossing of the rods at  half-past seven, then Mercury will pass the cross-rod at 11m. 52s. past  nine. But where? To learn this we must take out Mercury's declination,  which is 24 deg. 43' 18\" N., and the sun's, which is 22 deg. 59' 10\" N. The  difference, 1 deg. 44' 8\" N. gives us Mercury's place, which it appears is  rather less than 1-3/4 degree north of the sun. Thus, about 1h. 42m.  after the sun has passed the cross-rod, Mercury will pass it between the  first and second divisions above the point of fastening. The sun will  have set about an hour, and Mercury will be easily found when the  telescope is directed towards the place indicated.    It will be noticed that this method does not require the time to be  exactly known. All we have to do is to note the moment at which the sun  passes the point of fastening of the two rods, and to take our 1h. 42m.  from that moment.    This method, it may be noticed in passing, may be applied to give  naked-eye observations of Mercury at proper seasons "]]]
