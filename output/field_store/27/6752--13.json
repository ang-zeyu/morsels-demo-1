Of course, it is very handy to have his house always with  him. As he says, he is always at home. Still, when he is in a hurry  to get away from an enemy, it must be very awkward to have to carry  his house on his back. I--I--why, how stupid of me! He doesn't have to  run away at all! All he has got to do is to go inside his house and  stay there until the danger is past! I never thought of that before.  Why, that is the handiest thing I ever heard of.\"    Now Peter knew that there must be a good story about Spotty and his  house, and you know Peter dearly loves a good story. So at the very  first opportunity the next day, he hurried over to the Smiling Pool to  ask Grandfather Frog about it. As usual, Grandfather Frog was sitting  on his big green lily-pad. No sooner did Peter pop his head above the  edge of the bank of the Smiling Pool than Grandfather Frog exclaimed:    \"Chug-a-rum! You've kept me waiting a long time, Peter Rabbit. I don't  like to be kept waiting. If you wanted to know about Spotty the  Turtle, why didn't you come earlier?\" All the time there was a twinkle  in the big, goggly eyes of Grandfather Frog.    Peter was so surprised that he couldn't find his tongue. He hadn't  said a word to any one about Spotty, so how could Grandfather Frog  know what he had come for? For a long time he had had a great deal of  respect for Grandfather Frog, who, as you know, is very old and very  wise, but now Peter felt almost afraid of him. You see, it seemed to  Peter as if Grandfather Frog had read his very thoughts.    \"I--I didn't know you were waiting. Truly I didn't,\" stammered Peter.  \"If I had, I would have been here long ago. If you please, how did you  know that I was coming and what I was coming for?\"    \"Never mind how I knew. I know a great deal that I don't tell, which  is more than some folks can say,\" replied Grandfather Frog.    Peter wondered if he meant him, for you know Peter is a great gossip.  But he didn't say anything, because he didn't know just what to say,  and in a minute Grandfather Frog began the story Peter so much wanted.    \"Of course you know, without me telling you, that there is a reason  for Spotty's carrying his house around with him, because there is a  reason for everything in this world. And of course you know that that  reason is because of something that happened a long time ago, way back  in the days when the world was young. Almost everything to-day is the  result of things that happened in those long-ago days. The  great-great-ever-so-great grandfather of Spotty the Turtle lived  then, and unlike Spotty, whom you know, he had no house. He was very  quiet and bashful, was Mr. Turtle, and he never meddled with any one's  business, because he believed that the best way of keeping out of  trouble was to attend strictly to his own affairs.    \"He was a good deal like Spotty, just as fond of the water and just as  slow moving, but he didn't have the house which Spotty has now. If he  had had, he would have been saved a great deal of trouble and worry.  For a long time everybody lived at peace with everybody else. Then  came the trying time, of which you already know, when those who lived  on the Green Meadows and in the Green Forest had the very hardest kind  of work to find enough to eat, and were hungry most of the time. Now  Mr. Turtle, living in the Smiling Pool, had plenty to eat. He had  nothing to worry about on that score. Everybody who lives in the  Smiling Pool knows that it is the best place in the world, anyway.\"    Grandfather Frog winked at Jerry Muskrat, who was listening, and Jerry  nodded his head.    \"But presently Mr. Turtle discovered that the big people were eating  the little people whenever they could catch them, and that he wasn't  safe a minute when on shore, and not always safe in the water,\"  continued Grandfather Frog. \"He had two or three very narrow escapes,  and these set him to thinking. He was too slow and awkward to run or  to fight. The only thing he could do was to keep out of sight as much  as possible. So he learned to swim with only his head out of water,  and sometimes with only the end of his nose out of water. When he went  on land, he would cover himself with mud, and then when he heard  anybody coming, he would lie perfectly still, with his legs and his  tail and his head drawn in just as close as possible, so that he  looked for all the world like just a little lump of brown earth.    \"One day he had crawled under a piece of bark to rest and at the same  time keep out of sight of any who might happen along. When he got  ready to go on his way, he found that the piece of bark had caught on  his back, and that he was carrying it with him. At first he was  annoyed and started to shake it off. Before he succeeded, he heard  someone coming, so he promptly drew in his head and legs and tail. It  was Mr. Fisher, and he was very hungry and fierce. He looked at the  piece of bark under which Mr. Turtle was hiding, but all he saw was  the bark, because, you know, Mr. Turtle had drawn himself wholly  under.    \"'I believe,' said Mr. Fisher, talking out loud to himself, 'that I'll  have a look around the Smiling Pool and see if I can catch that  slow-moving Turtle who lives there. I believe he'll make me a good  dinner.'    \"Of course Mr. Turtle heard just what he said, and he blessed the  piece of bark which had hidden him from Mr. Fisher's sight. For a long  time he lay very still. When he did go on, he took the greatest care  not to shake off that piece of bark, for he didn't know but that any  minute he might want to hide under it again. At last he reached the  Smiling Pool and slipped into the water, leaving the piece of bark on  the bank. Thereafter, when he wanted to go on land, he would first  make sure that no one was watching. Then he would crawl under the  piece of bark and get it on his back. Wherever he went he carried the  piece of bark so as to have it handy to hide under.    \"Now all this time Old Mother Nature had been watching Mr. Turtle, and  it pleased her to see that he was smart enough to think of such a  clever way of fooling his enemies. So she began to study how she could  help Mr. Turtle. One day she came up behind him just as he sat down to  rest. The piece of bark was uncomfortable and scratched his back, 'I  wish,' said he, talking to himself, for he didn't know that any one  else was near, 'I wish that I had a house of my own that I could carry  on my back all the time and be perfectly safe when I was inside of  it.'    \"'You shall have,' said Old Mother Nature, and reaching out, she  touched his back and turned the skin into hard shell. Then she touched  the skin of his stomach and turned that into hard shell. 'Now draw in  your head and your legs and your tail,' said she.    \"Mr. Turtle did as he was told to do, and there he was in the very  best and safest kind of a house, perfectly hidden from all his  enemies!    \"'Oh, Mother Nature, how can I ever thank you?' he cried.    \"'By doing as you always have done, attending wholly to your own  affairs,' replied Old Mother Nature.    \"So ever since that long-ago day when the world was young, all Turtles  have carried their houses with them and never have meddled in things  that don't concern them,\" concluded Grandfather Frog.    \"Oh, thank you, Grandfather Frog,\" exclaimed Peter, drawing a long  breath. \"That was a perfectly splendid thing for Old Mother Nature to  do.\"    Then he started for his own home in the dear Old Briar-patch, and all  the way there he wondered and wondered how Grandfather Frog knew that  he wanted that story, and to this day he hasn't found out. You see, he  didn't notice that Grandfather Frog was listening when he asked Spotty  about his house. Of course, Grandfather Frog knows Peter and his  curiosity so well that he had guessed right away that Peter would come  to him for the story, just as Peter did.          XVI    WHY PADDY THE BEAVER HAS A BROAD TAIL      Usually the thing that interests us most is something that we haven't  got ourselves. It is that way with Peter Rabbit. Peter is not  naturally envious. Oh, my, no! Peter is pretty well satisfied with  what he has, which is quite as it should be. There is only one thing  with which Peter is really dissatisfied, and it is only once in a  while, when he hasn't much of anything else to think about, that he is  dissatisfied with this. Can you guess what it is? Well, it is his  tail. Yes, Sir, that is the one thing that ever really troubles  Peter.    You see, Peter's tail is, nothing but a funny little bunch of cotton,  which doesn't look like a tail at all. The only time he ever sees it  is when he is back to the Smiling Pool and looks over his shoulder at  his reflection in the water, and then, of course, he really doesn't  see his tail itself. So sometimes when Peter sees the fine tails of  his neighbors, a little bit of envy creeps into his heart for just a  little while. Why, even little Danny Meadow Mouse has a real tail,  short as it is. And as for Happy Jack Squirrel and Reddy Fox and Bobby  Coon and Jimmy Skunk, everybody knows what beautiful tails they have.  Once Peter thought about it so much that Grandfather Frog noticed how  sober he was and asked Peter what the trouble was. When Peter told him  that it seemed to him that Old Mother Nature had not been fair in  giving him such a foolish little tail when she had given others such  beautiful ones, Grandfather Frog just opened his big mouth and laughed  until he had to hold his sides.    \"Why, Peter,\" said he, \"you look so sober, that I thought you really  had something to worry about. What would you do with a big tail, if  you had one? It would always be in your way. Just think how many times  Reddy Fox or old Granny Fox have almost caught you."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14959"],[0,"The Hymns of Prudentius (#14)"],[1,"offerunt    tus, myrrham, et aurum regium.

HYMN FOR THE EPIPHANY        Lift up your eyes, whoe'er ye be    That fare the new-born Christ to see:    For yonder is the shining sign    Of grace perennial and divine.      What means this star, whose piercing rays    Outshine the sun's resplendent blaze?    'Tis token sure that God is come    In mortal flesh to make His home.      No courtier of the realms of night    Nor monthly moon's bright acolyte,    This star directs the course of day,    Sole sovereign of the heavenly way.      Although the Bears their track retrace,    Nor wholly their clear beams efface,    Yet ofttimes 'neath the dun cloud's haze    They hide themselves from mortal gaze.      But yon Star's glory hath no end,    Nor to the depths can it descend:    It ne'er is whelmed by envious cloud    That seeks its beauty to enshroud.      Now let the baleful comet die,    The brood of blazing Sirius fly:    God's orb shall quench their sultry heats    And drive them from their haughty seats.      Lo! from the regions of the morn    Wherein the radiant sun is born,    The Persian sages see on high    God's ensign shining in the sky.      Soon as its rising beams prevail    The starry hosts in order pale:    E'en Lucifer durst not upraise    The silvery splendours of his face.      Who is this sovereign (they enquire)    That lords it o'er the ethereal choir?    'Fore whom the heavens bow down afraid,    Of all the worlds of light obeyed?      Sure 'tis the sign most reverend    Of Being that doth know no end:    Of One in state sublime arrayed    Ere sky and chaos yet were made.      This is the King of Israel,    Of all in Gentile lands that dwell:    The King to Abram and his seed    Throughout all ages erst decreed.      To him 'twas given his progeny    As stars innumerous to see:    First of believers! moved to slay    His only son, so God to obey.      Behold the Flower of David shine,    Of Jesse's root the Branch benign:    The sceptre spread with blossoms rare    Wields o'er the world its lordship fair.      Roused by the portent of the sky    The sages fix their gaze on high,    And speed them 'neath the furrowed way    Marked by the star's effulgent ray.      At length its flaming steps it stayed    Poised over where the Child was laid:    Straightway with downcast mien it shed    Its splendours on the sacred Head.      Whereat the travellers outpour    Of Eastern gifts their treasure-store,    Myrrh and sweet-smelling frankincense,    Gold meet for regal opulence.      Behold herein the triple sign    Of Thy pure being, King divine:    Seeing the Father willed in Thee    To plant a threefold majesty.      The gift of gold thee King proclaims:    Thee God the fragrant incense names:    The myrrh declares that Death shall thrust    Within the tomb Thy body's dust.      Ah! that dark sepulchre, whose fold    God's body quenched in death doth hold:    Yet shall He from that durance wake    And Death's strong prison-fetters break.      O Bethlehem! no longer thou    The least of cities: all shall vow    That thou art greatest on the earth:    For thou man's King didst bring to birth.      Yea thou didst on thy bosom bear    The All-loving Father's only heir:    Man of the Thunderer's Spirit made    And God in human flesh arrayed.      The prophets witnessed to the bond    Which sealed to Him the realm profound:    The Father's Kingdom He received    And the vast legacy perceived.      All things are His in sea and sky,    In hell beneath, in heaven on high:    From East to setting sun, in fee    He holds the earth's immensity.      Distraught, the tyrant base doth hear    That now the King of Kings draws near    To reign in David's seat of state    And Israel's empire dominate.      \"Betrayed are we,\" he maddened cries,    \"Our throne's usurper doth arise:    Go, soldiers, go with sword in hand    And slay all babes within my land.      \"Spare no male child: each nurse's robe    Your scrutinizing steel must probe:    Spare not the suckling infant, though    O'er mother's breast its life-blood flow.      \"On Bethlehem our suspicion falls,    On every hearth within its walls:    Lest mothers with love's tender zeal    Some manly scion may conceal.\"      With daggers drawn the infuriate crew    Upon their murderous errand flew:    Each latest offspring of the womb    To bloody death they foully doom.      Ah tiny limbs! 'twas hard to know    How best to strike the fatal blow:    Too wide the sword-blades are to smite    Those throats so silken-fragile, slight.      O horrid sight! the tender bones    Are dashed against the jagged stones:    Sightless and mangled there they lie,    Poor babes! untimely doomed to die.      Perchance the still deep river laves    Their bodies thrust into the waves:    The current with their sighing sighs,    Sobs with their latest, broken cries.      Ye flowers of martyrdom, all hail!    Of rising morn pure blossoms frail!    By Jesu's foe were ye downcast,    Like budding roses by the blast.      Lambs of the flock too early slain,    Ye first fruits of Christ's bitter pain!    Close to His very altar, gay    With palms and crowns, ye now do play.      Of what avail is deed so vile?    Doth Herod gain by murderous guile?    Of all to death so foully done    Escapes triumphant Christ alone.      Amidst that tide of infant gore    Alone He wins the sheltering shore:    The"]]]
