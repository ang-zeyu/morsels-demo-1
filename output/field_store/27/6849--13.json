The lady is my prisoner, also.\"    \"Sure by rights she should be gaoler and hold all men's hearts in ward,\"  said Paradise, with a low bow to my unfortunate captive.    While he spoke a most remarkable transformation was going on. The  minister's grave, rugged, and deeply lined face smoothed itself and shed  ten years at least; in the eyes that I had seen wet with noble tears a  laughing devil now lurked, while his strong mouth became a loose-lipped,  devil-may-care one. His head with its aureole of bushy, grizzled hair  set itself jauntily upon one side, and from it and from his face and his  whole great frame breathed a wicked jollity quite indescribable.    \"Odsbodikins, captain!\" he cried. \"Kirby's luck!--'twill pass into a  saw! Adzooks! and so you're captain once more, and I'm mate once more,  and we've a ship once more, and we're off once more        To sail the Spanish Main,      And give the Spaniard pain,          Heave ho, bully boy, heave ho!    By 'r lakin! I'm too dry to sing. It will take all the wine of Xeres in  the next galleon to unparch my tongue!\"      NOTES    =the grave=:--This refers to the latter part of chapter 21 of _To Have  and to Hold_; the hero, Ralph Percy, who has been shipwrecked with his  companions, discovers a group of pirates burying their dead captain.    =pezos and pieces of eight=:--_peso_ is the Spanish word for dollar;  _pieces of eight_ are dollars also, each dollar containing eight  _reals_.    =the man in black and silver=:--Paradise, an Englishman.    =frails=:--Baskets made of rushes.    =Kirby=:--A renowned pirate mentioned in chapter 21.    =Maracaibo=:--The city or the gulf of that name in Venezuela.    =galleasses=:--Heavy, low-built vessels having sails as well as oars.    =Lucayas=:--An old name for the Bahama Islands.    =de Leon=:--Ponce de Leon discovered Florida in 1513; he searched long  for a fountain which would restore youth.    =aqua vitae=:--Latin for _water of life_.    =Summer Isles=:--Another name for the Bermuda Islands.    =Cartagena=:--A city in Spain.    =Lima=:--A city in Peru.    =Toledo=:--A \"Toledo blade\"--a sword of the very finest temper, made in  Toledo, Spain.    =the Low Countries=:--Holland and Belgium.    =senor=:--The Spanish word for _sir_.    =Weyanoke=:--The home of the hero, near Jamestown, Virginia.    =Sparrow=:--A minister, one of the hero's companions; see chapter 3 of  _To Have and to Hold_.    =guarda costa=:--Coast guard.    =Diccon=:--Ralph Percy's servant.    =the gentleman without a sword=:--Lord Carnal, an enemy of Percy.    =the lady=:--She is really Percy's wife.    =Odsbodikins=; =Adzooks=:--Oaths much used two centuries ago.    =By 'r lakin=:--By our ladykin (little lady); an oath by the Virgin  Mary.    =Xeres=:--The Spanish town after which sherry wine is named.      SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY    This selection is easily understood. Ralph Percy, his wife, and several  others (see notes) are cast on a desert shore after the sinking of their  boat. Percy leaves his companions for a time and falls among pirates; he  pretends to be a \"sea-rover\" himself. Why does he allude to the pirate  ship as a \"cockboat\"? Why are the pirates impressed by his remarks? Why  does Percy emphasize the riches of the sunken ship? Is what he says  true? (See chapter 19 of _To Have and to Hold_.) If not, is he  justified in telling a falsehood? Is he really Kirby? Is he fortunate in  his assertion that he is? How does he explain his lack of resemblance to  Kirby? What kind of person is the hero? Why does he wish to become the  leader of the pirates? Is it possible that the pirate crew should change  their attitude so suddenly? Is it a good plan in a story to make a hero  tell of his own successes? Characterize the man in black and silver. How  does the author make us feel the action and peril of the struggle? How  does she make us feel the long duration of the fight with Paradise? Do  you like the hero's behavior with the defeated pirates? Why is he so  careful to repeat to the minister what he has told the pirates? Why does  the minister appear to change his character?    Can you make this piece into a little play?

In this process,  all the class may work together under the direction of the teacher, or  each pupil may make his own attempt to dramatize the piece.    In writing the drama, tell first what the setting is. In doing so, you  had better look up some modern play and see how the setting is explained  to the reader or the actors. Now show the pirates at work, and give a  few lines of their conversation; then have the hero come upon the scene.  Indicate the speech of each person, and put in all necessary stage  directions. Perhaps you will want to add more dialogue than there is  here. Some of the onlookers may have something to say. Perhaps you will  wish to leave something out. It might be well, while the fighting is  going on, to bring in remarks from the combatants and the other pirates.  You might look up the duel scene in _Hamlet_ for this point. You can end  your play with the departure of the group; or you can write a second  scene, in which the hero's companions appear, including the lady.  Considerable dialogue could be invented here, and a new episode added--a  quarrel, a plan for organization, or a merry-making.    When your play is finished, you may possibly wish to have it acted  before the class. A few turbans, sashes, and weapons will be sufficient  to give an air of piracy to the group of players. Some grim black  mustaches would complete the effect.    =A Pirate Story=:--Tell an old-fashioned \"yarn\" of adventure, in which a  modest hero relates his own experiences. Give your imagination a good  deal of liberty. Do not waste much time in getting started, but plunge  very soon into the actual story. Let your hero tell how he fell among  the pirates. Then go on with the conversation that ensued--the threats,  the boasting, and the bravado. Make the hero report his struggles, or  the tricks that he resorted to in order to outwit the sea-rovers.  Perhaps he failed at first and got into still greater dangers. Follow  out his adventures to the moment of his escape. Make your descriptions  short and vivid; put in as much direct conversation as possible; keep  the action brisk and spirited. Try to write a lively tale that would  interest a group of younger boys.

THOMAS          Shuttle of the sunburnt grass,      Fifer in the dun cuirass,      Fifing shrilly in the morn,      Shrilly still at eve unworn;      Now to rear, now in the van,      Gayest of the elfin clan:      Though I watch their rustling flight,      I can never guess aright      Where their lodging-places are;      'Mid some daisy's golden star,      Or beneath a roofing leaf,      Or in fringes of a sheaf,      Tenanted as soon as bound!      Loud thy reveille doth sound,      When the earth is laid asleep,      And her dreams are passing deep,      On mid-August afternoons;      And through all the harvest moons,      Nights brimmed up with honeyed peace,      Thy gainsaying doth not cease.

Thick forests of palms stretch at various  points along the low plain, where are springs plentifully furnished by  filtration from the high ground on either hand. The various kinds of  oasian culture are pursued here with success. Wheat and barley are  produced in considerable quantities; and camels, asses, and goats find  plentiful nourishment. The villages are numerous; but some contain only  few men, and none exceed forty-five. Takarteebah, the largest place,  pays four hundred and ninety mahboubs per annum, cultivates four  thousand palms, yielding a hundred and fifty kafasses of dates, thirty  of wheat, and eight of barley; it feeds eleven asses. I observed that  all domestic animals, the goats especially, attain a very diminutive  size in these oases, the nourishment for them being but scanty.    In this oasis the palm-groves are much more dense than in any other I  have seen. They almost merit the name of forests, both from their size  and wild luxuriant appearance. The Fezzanees pay little attention to  their culture, and when a tree falls it is frequently suffered to lie  for months, even though it block up the public road. In contrast to the  burning desert we had just traversed, these dense woods casting their  shadows on the white sand produced a most pleasing effect. We eagerly  wandered into the cool arcades, and watched with delight the doves and  hippoes, and other birds, as they fluttered to and fro amidst the  drooping leaves.    Laghareefah, like Edree, had been destroyed by the brilliant, though  ruthless usurper, Abd-el-Galeel, on account of its resistance to his  authority. The old town is at a little distance from the new, and was  evidently a much better-built place, commanded by an earthen kasr or  fortress.    On May 2d, we had a tempest of thunder and lightning to the south on the  hills, produced by the intense heat of the morning, and its accumulation  during the previous few days. Rain seemed to be falling at a distance of  a few hours. In the evening the mercury still stood about 100 deg.. The heat  now was still very distressing. The wind came charged with dust that  rolled in columns, like smoke beaten down by a tempest, across the  surface of the valley. All the vegetation seemed withered, as if in an  oven; and the wheat in the ear was brittle, as though roasted. There is  a good deal of wheat in this oasis. I observed an old woman reaping, and  went to chat with her. Her sickle had a long handle, and the blade  itself was narrow, but slightly bent and somewhat serrated. I tried it,  and found that it answered its purpose very well, however rude in  appearance.    I entered one of the huts made of palm-branches, and carelessly smeared  with mud--an attempt at plastering that can hardly be called successful.  The door was formed of rough planks of date-wood, and the flooring of  hard-trodden earth, covered with mats. The principal article of  furniture was, as usual, the small hand corn-mill, for nearly every  person in the East is still his own miller. The huts, though rude in  outward appearance, were dark, cool, and comfortable within. In the town  itself, many of them are built entirely of mud; that is to say, of round  mud balls, first moistened with water, and then dried in the sun. I  entered several, and found that most were empty. Where we found people,  they were courteous and cheerful in manners, and smiled at the curiosity  with which I lifted up the wicker covers of their pots and jars. In one  I found a little sour milk; in another, some bazeen; in another, a few  dates soaking in water. A small vessel now and then occurred, full of  oil; but this is the greatest luxury they possess.    None of the doors has either lock or key. The Fezzanee observed,  \"Strangers may steal, but Fezzanees never. All the dates remain securely  on the trees until gathered by the owners.\" It must be observed,  however, that the anomaly of vast possessions being held by one man, who  can scarcely consume or utilise the produce, whilst others have not a  stone whereon to lay their heads, and depend even for a burial-place  upon charity, is not to be observed in this barbarous country.    The children of the Wady, up to the age of seven or eight years, go  about perfectly naked, which may partly account for the bronze-black  colour of their skins. The Tuaricks are generally fairer than the  Fezzanees, though some of these latter are fair as the Moors on the  coast, whilst others are black as very niggers.    We received a visit from the Nather, or civil governor of the Wady. He  is a Fezzanee, Abbas by name; and thankfully received the present of a  handkerchief. The Kaid, or military commander, is a Moor from Tripoli.  Everybody seems interested about us, and there is a perfect flux of  visits. All the authorities around seem to make our arrival a holiday.  We are quite the fashion. The chaouch gets drunk in the evening on  leghma, furnished by the Nather, who wants to worm out all the news; and  there is little doubt that he has learned the whole truth, and a good  deal more. El-Maskouas, the Turkish officer employed in collecting  contributions for Mourzuk, arrived at the camp and brought letters from  M. Gagliuffi. He also told us that the Sheikh of Aghadez had not yet  returned from his pilgrimage to Mekka. The motions of all these desert  magnates are circulated from mouth to mouth as assiduously as those of  our Mayfair fashionables.    Among our visitors was Haj Mohammed El-Saeedy, the owner of our camels.  His social position answers to that of an English shipowner. He is a  marabout of great celebrity in this country, and moves about in an  atmosphere of respect. By the way, when it became clearly impressed upon  my mind that the Fezzanee camel-drivers were merely employed for hire,  and had no property whatever in the beasts they drove, my opinion of  them began to rise. It would have been impossible to take more care of  the camels than they did.    We remained stationary in the Wady, from the 1st of May to the evening  of the 3d, when we moved on to Toueewah. After dark was passed Azerna,  in the neighbourhood of which stood the ancient town, celebrated for its  ruins. The modern place, though presenting a martial kind of appearance  with its battlemented mud walls, contained only ten inhabitants, who  live like so many rats in holes or under the piles of ruins. On the 4th,  when the people removed our beds in the morning, a scorpion sallied  furiously forth. We had been sleeping with him under our pillows. We  moved on, still in the Wady, for a couple of hours, until we came to the  house of the Kaid, and once more encamped. His habitation is large,  commodious, and well protected from the sun. He showed us his  sleeping-apartment, which is airy and well protected from the sun. A  number of little wicker baskets, the handiwork of his wife, served as so  many clothes-presses. The baskets of Fezzan are perfectly water-tight.    This Kaid, called Ahmed Tylmoud, is quite a character, and looks very  droll with his single eye. He has twenty soldiers only under his command  throughout the valley. The Turks do not waste their men, making up by  severity for want of numbers. Like the commandant of Shaty, this Ahmed  Tylmoud insisted on \"playing at powder\" with his men for our  edification; but was also obliged to beg his ammunition. It is singular,  that although these people are only armed with matchlocks, and are  supposed to be ready for service, either to defend the country or levy  contributions, they seem entirely destitute of all necessary provisions  for that purpose.    We were pestered with two very modest requests, which were not in our  power to grant. In the first place, the native inhabitants sent a  deputation to ask us to use our influence with the Governor of Mourzuk  to procure a reduction of their taxes; and then the Arab troops desired  that we should procure for them their discharge. Our refusal even to  take the charge of these verbal petitions seemed very harsh. An  impression had evidently got abroad that we came to bring about a  general redress of grievances; or, at any rate, that our influence was  far greater than we chose to avow.    I gave to the Kaid a handkerchief, as well as some snuff and tobacco. In  return, he sent a little bread and a fly-flapper; so that we parted good  friends. During our stay, we heard this jolly fellow entertaining the  chaouches and his own horsemen with a description of the ladies of the  Wady, who had no reason to be flattered by his account. And yet he seems  to have married one himself: _hinc illae lachrymae_, perhaps. My chaouch  had already given me a confirmation of these libels, and was evidently  greatly delighted by this testimony to his exactitude.    There are several roads from the Wady to Mourzuk, all much about the  same distance. It is said, also, that Ghat is only ten days from  Laghareefah. We moved on a little further on the evening of the 4th, but  did not start properly until next day, when we made a long stretch of  more than thirteen hours, and encamped at the village of Agar, where I  remembered having halted once before on my way from Ghat. During this  day's march we found, that what we had supposed to be the border of the  Mourzuk plateau was not in reality so. We soon reached the summit of the  cliffs, and having cast back a glance upon the valley, with its expanse  of corn-fields and thousands of palm-trees, expected to find an elevated  plateau beyond; but the hills gradually softened down into a plain on  their eastern side. Our route may be said to have led through a  wilderness, not a desert. On all sides were clusters of the tholukh,  which grows prettily up, and has a poetical appearance. The ground at  some places was strewed with branches, cut"]]]
