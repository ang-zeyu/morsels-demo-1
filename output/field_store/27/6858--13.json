It had a hook on the  top, and was evidently used for attaching the ladder.    \"It was the end of this ladder which Miss Eltham saw,\" said Smith, \"as  he trailed it behind him into the shrubbery when she interrupted him in  her fathers room.  He and whomever he had with him doubtless slipped in  during the daytime--whilst Eltham was absent in London--bringing the  prepared cask and all necessary implements with them.  They concealed  themselves somewhere--probably in the shrubbery--and during the night  made the cache.  The excavated earth would be disposed of on the  flower-beds; the dummy bush they probably had ready.  You see, the  problem of getting IN was never a big one.  But owing to the 'defenses'  it was impossible (whilst Eltham was in residence at any rate) to get  OUT after dark.  For Fu-Manchu's purposes, then, a working-base INSIDE  Redmoat was essential.  His servant--for he needed assistance--must  have been in hiding somewhere outside; Heaven knows where!  During the  day they could come or go by the gates, as we have already noted.\"    \"You think it was the Doctor himself?\"    \"It seems possible.  Who else has eyes like the eyes Miss Eltham saw  from the window last night?\"    Then remains to tell the nature of the outrage whereby Fu-Manchu had  planned to prevent Eltham's leaving England for China.  This we learned  from Denby.  For Denby was not dead.    It was easy to divine that he had stumbled upon the fiendish visitor at  the very entrance to his burrow; had been stunned (judging from the  evidence, with a sand-bag), and dragged down into the cache--to which  he must have lain in such dangerous proximity as to render detection of  the dummy bush possible in removing him.  The quickest expedient, then,  had been to draw him beneath.  When the search of the shrubbery was  concluded, his body had been borne to the edge of the bushes and laid  where we found it.    Why his life had been spared, I cannot conjecture, but provision had  been made against his recovering consciousness and revealing the secret  of the shrubbery.  The ruse of releasing the mastiff alone had  terminated the visit of the unbidden guest within Redmoat.    Denby made a very slow recovery; and, even when convalescent,  consciously added not one fact to those we already had collated; his  memory had completely deserted him!    This, in my opinion, as in those of the several specialists consulted,  was due, not to the blow on the head, but to the presence, slightly  below and to the right of the first cervical curve of the spine, of a  minute puncture--undoubtedly caused by a hypodermic syringe.  Then,  unconsciously, poor Denby furnished the last link in the chain; for  undoubtedly, by means of this operation, Fu-Manchu had designed to  efface from Eltham's mind his plans of return to Ho-Nan.    The nature of the fluid which could produce such mental symptoms was a  mystery--a mystery which defied Western science: one of the many  strange secrets of Dr. Fu-Manchu.        CHAPTER X      SINCE Nayland Smith's return from Burma I had rarely taken up a paper  without coming upon evidences of that seething which had cast up Dr.  Fu-Manchu. Whether, hitherto, such items had escaped my attention or  had seemed to demand no particular notice, or whether they now became  increasingly numerous, I was unable to determine.    One evening, some little time after our sojourn in Norfolk, in glancing  through a number of papers which I had brought in with me, I chanced  upon no fewer than four items of news bearing more or less directly  upon the grim business which engaged my friend and I.    No white man, I honestly believe, appreciates the unemotional cruelty  of the Chinese.  Throughout the time that Dr. Fu-Manchu remained in  England, the press preserved a uniform silence upon the subject of his  existence.  This was due to Nayland Smith.  But, as a result, I feel  assured that my account of the Chinaman's deeds will, in many quarters,  meet with an incredulous reception.    I had been at work, earlier in the evening, upon the opening chapters  of this chronicle, and I had realized how difficult it would be for my  reader, amid secure and cozy surroundings, to credit any human being  with a callous villainy great enough to conceive and to put into  execution such a death pest as that directed against Sir Crichton Davey.    One would expect God's worst man to shrink from employing--against  however vile an enemy--such an instrument as the Zayat Kiss.  So  thinking, my eye was caught by the following:--      EXPRESS CORRESPONDENT    NEW YORK.    \"Secret service men of the United States Government are searching the  South Sea Islands for a certain Hawaiian from the island of Maui, who,  it is believed, has been selling poisonous scorpions to Chinese in  Honolulu anxious to get rid of their children.    \"Infanticide, by scorpion and otherwise, among the Chinese, has  increased so terribly that the authorities have started a searching  inquiry, which has led to the hunt for the scorpion dealer of Maui.    \"Practically all the babies that die mysteriously are unwanted girls,  and in nearly every case the parents promptly ascribe the death to the  bite of a scorpion, and are ready to produce some more or less  poisonous insect in support of the statement.    \"The authorities have no doubt that infanticide by scorpion bite is a  growing practice, and orders have been given to hunt down the scorpion  dealer at any cost.\"      Is it any matter for wonder that such a people had produced a  Fu-Manchu?  I pasted the cutting into a scrap-book, determined that, if  I lived to publish my account of those days, I would quote it therein  as casting a sidelight upon Chinese character.    A Reuter message to The Globe and a paragraph in The Star also  furnished work for my scissors.  Here were evidences of the deep-seated  unrest, the secret turmoil, which manifested itself so far from its  center as peaceful England in the person of the sinister Doctor.      \"HONG KONG, Friday.    \"Li Hon Hung, the Chinaman who fired at the Governor yesterday, was  charged before the magistrate with shooting at him with intent to kill,  which is equivalent to attempted murder.  The prisoner, who was not  defended, pleaded guilty.  The Assistant Crown Solicitor, who  prosecuted, asked for a remand until Monday, which was granted.    \"Snapshots taken by the spectators of the outrage yesterday disclosed  the presence of an accomplice, also armed with a revolver.  It is  reported that this man, who was arrested last night, was in possession  of incriminating documentary evidence.\"      Later.    \"Examination of the documents found on Li Hon Hung's accomplice has  disclosed the fact that both men were well financed by the Canton Triad  Society, the directors of which had enjoined the assassination of Sir  F. M. or Mr. C. S., the Colonial Secretary.  In a report prepared by  the accomplice for dispatch to Canton, also found on his person, he  expressed regret that the attempt had failed.\"--Reuter.    \"It is officially reported in St. Petersburg that a force of Chinese  soldiers and villagers surrounded the house of a Russian subject named  Said Effendi, near Khotan, in Chinese Turkestan.    \"They fired at the house and set it in flames.  There were in the house  about 100 Russians, many of whom were killed.    \"The Russian Government has instructed its Minister at Peking to make  the most vigorous representations on the subject.\"--Reuter.      Finally, in a Personal Column, I found the following:--    \"HO-NAN. Have abandoned visit.--ELTHAM.\"      I had just pasted it into my book when Nayland Smith came in and threw  himself into an arm-chair, facing me across the table.  I showed him  the cutting.    \"I am glad, for Eltham's sake--and for the girl's,\" was his comment.  \"But it marks another victory for Fu-Manchu!  Just Heaven!  Why is  retribution delayed!\"    Smith's darkly tanned face had grown leaner than ever since he had  begun his fight with the most uncanny opponent, I suppose, against whom  a man ever had pitted himself. He stood up and began restlessly to pace  the room, furiously stuffing tobacco into his briar.    \"I have seen Sir Lionel Barton,\" he said abruptly; \"and, to put the  whole thing in a nutshell, he has laughed at me!  During the months  that I have been wondering where he had gone to he has been somewhere  in Egypt.  He certainly bears a charmed life, for on the evidence of  his letter to The Times he has seen things in Tibet which Fu-Manchu  would have the West blind to; in fact, I think he has found a new  keyhole to the gate of the Indian Empire!\"    Long ago we had placed the name of Sir Lionel Barton upon the list of  those whose lives stood between Fu-Manchu and the attainment of his  end.  Orientalist and explorer, the fearless traveler who first had  penetrated to Lhassa, who thrice, as a pilgrim, had entered forbidden  Mecca, he now had turned his attention again to Tibet--thereby signing  his own death-warrant.    \"That he has reached England alive is a hopeful sign?\" I suggested.    Smith shook his head, and lighted the blackened briar.    \"England at present is the web,\" he replied.  \"The spider will be  waiting.  Petrie, I sometimes despair.  Sir Lionel is an impossible man  to shepherd.  You ought to see his house at Finchley.  A low, squat  place completely hemmed in by trees.  Damp as a swamp; smells like a  jungle.  Everything topsy-turvy. He only arrived to-day, and he is  working and eating (and sleeping I expect), in a study that looks like  an earthquake at Sotheby's auction-rooms. The rest of the house is half  a menagerie and half a circus.  He has a Bedouin groom, a Chinese  body-servant, and Heaven only knows what other strange people!\"    \"Chinese!\"    \"Yes, I saw him; a squinting Cantonese he calls Kwee.  I don't like  him.

Stalybridge lies in a narrow, crooked ravine, much  narrower even than the valley at Stockport, and both sides of this ravine  are occupied by an irregular group of cottages, houses, and mills.  On  entering, the very first cottages are narrow, smoke-begrimed, old and  ruinous; and as the first houses, so the whole town.  A few streets lie  in the narrow valley bottom, most of them run criss-cross, pell-mell, up  hill and down, and in nearly all the houses, by reason of this sloping  situation, the ground floor is half-buried in the earth; and what  multitudes of courts, back lanes, and remote nooks arise out of this  confused way of building may be seen from the hills, whence one has the  town, here and there, in a bird's-eye view almost at one's feet.  Add to  this the shocking filth, and the repulsive effect of Stalybridge, in  spite of its pretty surroundings, may be readily imagined.    But enough of these little towns.  Each has its own peculiarities, but in  general, the working-people live in them just as in Manchester.  Hence I  have especially sketched only their peculiar construction, and would  observe, that all more general observations as to the condition of the  labouring population in Manchester are fully applicable to these  surrounding towns as well.    Manchester lies at the foot of the southern slope of a range of hills,  which stretch hither from Oldham, their last peak, Kersallmoor, being at  once the racecourse and the Mons Sacer of Manchester.  Manchester proper  lies on the left bank of the Irwell, between that stream and the two  smaller ones, the Irk and the Medlock, which here empty into the Irwell.  On the left bank of the Irwell, bounded by a sharp curve of the river,  lies Salford, and farther westward Pendleton; northward from the Irwell  lie Upper and Lower Broughton; northward of the Irk, Cheetham Hill; south  of the Medlock lies Hulme; farther east Chorlton on Medlock; still  farther, pretty well to the east of Manchester, Ardwick.  The whole  assemblage of buildings is commonly called Manchester, and contains about  four hundred thousand inhabitants, rather more than less.  The town  itself is peculiarly built, so that a person may live in it for years,  and go in and out daily without coming into contact with a  working-people's quarter or even with workers, that is, so long as he  confines himself to his business or to pleasure walks.  This arises  chiefly from the fact, that by unconscious tacit agreement, as well as  with outspoken conscious determination, the working-people's quarters are  sharply separated from the sections of the city reserved for the middle-  class; or, if this does not succeed, they are concealed with the cloak of  charity.  Manchester contains, at its heart, a rather extended commercial  district, perhaps half a mile long and about as broad, and consisting  almost wholly of offices and warehouses.  Nearly the whole district is  abandoned by dwellers, and is lonely and deserted at night; only watchmen  and policemen traverse its narrow lanes with their dark lanterns.  This  district is cut through by certain main thoroughfares upon which the vast  traffic concentrates, and in which the ground level is lined with  brilliant shops.  In these streets the upper floors are occupied, here  and there, and there is a good deal of life upon them until late at  night.  With the exception of this commercial district, all Manchester  proper, all Salford and Hulme, a great part of Pendleton and Chorlton,  two-thirds of Ardwick, and single stretches of Cheetham Hill and  Broughton are all unmixed working-people's quarters, stretching like a  girdle, averaging a mile and a half in breadth, around the commercial  district.  Outside, beyond this girdle, lives the upper and middle  bourgeoisie, the middle bourgeoisie in regularly laid out streets in the  vicinity of the working quarters, especially in Chorlton and the lower  lying portions of Cheetham Hill; the upper bourgeoisie in remoter villas  with gardens in Chorlton and Ardwick, or on the breezy heights of  Cheetham Hill, Broughton, and Pendleton, in free, wholesome country air,  in fine, comfortable homes, passed once every half or quarter hour by  omnibuses going into the city.  And the finest part of the arrangement is  this, that the members of this money aristocracy can take the shortest  road through the middle of all the labouring districts to their places of  business, without ever seeing that they are in the midst of the grimy  misery that lurks to the right and the left.  For the thoroughfares  leading from the Exchange in all directions out of the city are lined, on  both sides, with an almost unbroken series of shops, and are so kept in  the hands of the middle and lower bourgeoisie, which, out of  self-interest, cares for a decent and cleanly external appearance and  _can_ care for it.  True, these shops bear some relation to the districts  which lie behind them, and are more elegant in the commercial and  residential quarters than when they hide grimy working-men's dwellings;  but they suffice to conceal from the eyes of the wealthy men and women of  strong stomachs and weak nerves the misery and grime which form the  complement of their wealth.  So, for instance, Deansgate, which leads  from the Old Church directly southward, is lined first with mills and  warehouses, then with second-rate shops and alehouses; farther south,  when it leaves the commercial district, with less inviting shops, which  grow dirtier and more interrupted by beerhouses and gin palaces the  farther one goes, until at the southern end the appearance of the shops  leaves no doubt that workers and workers only are their customers.  So  Market Street running south-east from the Exchange; at first brilliant  shops of the best sort, with counting-houses or warehouses above; in the  continuation, Piccadilly, immense hotels and warehouses; in the farther  continuation, London Road, in the neighbourhood of the Medlock,  factories, beerhouses, shops for the humbler bourgeoisie and the working  population; and from this point onward, large gardens and villas of the  wealthier merchants and manufacturers.  In this way any one who knows  Manchester can infer the adjoining districts, from the appearance of the  thoroughfare, but one is seldom in a position to catch from the street a  glimpse of the real labouring districts.  I know very well that this  hypocritical plan is more or less common to all great cities; I know,  too, that the retail dealers are forced by the nature of their business  to take possession of the great highways; I know that there are more good  buildings than bad ones upon such streets everywhere, and that the value  of land is greater near them than in remoter districts; but at the same  time I have never seen so systematic a shutting out of the working-class  from the thoroughfares, so tender a concealment of everything which might  affront the eye and the nerves of the bourgeoisie, as in Manchester.  And  yet, in other respects, Manchester is less built according to a plan,  after official regulations, is more an outgrowth of accident, than any  other city; and when I consider in this connection the eager assurances  of the middle-class, that the working-class is doing famously, I cannot  help feeling that the liberal manufacturers, the \"Big Wigs\" of  Manchester, are not so innocent after all, in the matter of this  sensitive method of construction.    I may mention just here that the mills almost all adjoin the rivers or  the different canals that ramify throughout the city, before I proceed at  once to describe the labouring quarters.  First of all, there is the old  town of Manchester, which lies between the northern boundary of the  commercial district and the Irk.  Here the streets, even the better ones,  are narrow and winding, as Todd Street, Long Millgate, Withy Grove, and  Shude Hill, the houses dirty, old, and tumble-down, and the construction  of the side streets utterly horrible.  Going from the Old Church to Long  Millgate, the stroller has at once a row of old-fashioned houses at the  right, of which not one has kept its original level; these are remnants  of the old pre-manufacturing Manchester, whose former inhabitants have  removed with their descendants into better-built districts, and have left  the houses, which were not good enough for them, to a population strongly  mixed with Irish blood.  Here one is in an almost undisguised working-  men's quarter, for even the shops and beerhouses hardly take the trouble  to exhibit a trifling degree of cleanliness.  But all this is nothing in  comparison with the courts and lanes which lie behind, to which access  can be gained only through covered passages, in which no two human beings  can pass at the same time.  Of the irregular cramming together of  dwellings in ways which defy all rational plan, of the tangle in which  they are crowded literally one upon the other, it is impossible to convey  an idea.  And it is not the buildings surviving from the old times of  Manchester which are to blame for this; the confusion has only recently  reached its height when every scrap of space left by the old way of  building has been filled up and patched over until not a foot of land is  left to be further occupied.    The south bank of the Irk is here very steep and between fifteen and  thirty feet high.  On this declivitous hillside there are planted three  rows of houses, of which the lowest rise directly out of the river, while  the front walls of the highest stand on the crest of the hill in Long  Millgate.  Among them are mills on the river, in short, the method of  construction is as crowded and disorderly here as in the lower part of  Long Millgate.  Right and left a multitude of covered passages lead from  the main street into numerous courts, and"]]]
