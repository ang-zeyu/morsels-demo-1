Futile, indeed, might be  Margrave's boasted secret; but at least in that secret was hope.  In recognized science I saw only despair.    And at that thought all dread of this mysterious visitor vanished--  all anxiety to question more of his attributes or his history.  His  life itself became to me dear and precious.  What if it should fail  me in the steps of the process, whatever that was, by which the  life of my Lilian might be saved!    The shades of evening were now closing in.  I remembered that I had  left Margrave without even food for many hours.  I stole round to  the back of the house, filled a basket with elements more generous  than those of the former day; extracted fresh drugs from my stores,  and, thus laden, hurried back to the hut.  I found Margrave in the  room below, seated on his mysterious coffer, leaning his face on  his hand.  When I entered, he looked up, and said:    \"You have neglected me.  My strength is waning.  Give me more of  the cordial, for we have work before us tonight, and I need  support.\"    He took for granted my assent to his wild experiment; and he was  right.    I administered the cordial.  I placed food before him, and this  time he did not eat with repugnance.  I poured out wine, and he  drank it sparingly, but with ready compliance, saying, \"In perfect  health, I looked upon wine as poison; now it is like a foretaste of  the glorious elixir.\"    After he had thus recruited himself, he seemed to acquire an energy  that startlingly contrasted with his languor the day before; the  effort of breathing was scarcely perceptible; the color came back  to his cheeks; his bended frame rose elastic and erect.    \"If I understood you rightly,\" said I, \"the experiment you ask me  to aid can be accomplished in a single night?\"    \"In a single night--this night.\"    \"Command me.  Why not begin at once?  What apparatus or chemical  agencies do you need?\"    \"Ah!\" said Margrave.  \"Formerly, how I was misled!  Formerly, how  my conjectures blundered!  I thought, when I asked you to give a  month to the experiment I wish to make, that I should need the  subtlest skill of the chemist.  I then believed, with Van Helmont,  that the principle of life is a gas, and that the secret was but in  the mode by which the gas might be rightly administered.  But now,  all that I need is contained in this coffer, save one very simple  material--fuel sufficient for a steady fire for six hours.  I see  even that is at hand, piled up in your outhouse.  And now for the  substance itself--to that you must guide me.\"    \"Explain.\"    \"Near this very spot is there not gold--in mines yet undiscovered--  and gold of the purest metal?\"    \"There is.  What then?  Do you, with the alchemists, blend in one  discovery, gold and life?\"    \"No.  But it is only where the chemistry of earth or of man  produces gold, that the substance from which the great pabulum of  life is extracted by ferment can be found.  Possibly, in the  attempts at that transmutation of metals, which I think your own  great chemist, Sir Humphry Davy, allowed might be possible, but  held not to be worth the cost of the process--possibly, in those  attempts, some scanty grains of this substance were found by the  alchemists, in the crucible, with grains of the metal as niggardly  yielded by pitiful mimicry of Nature's stupendous laboratory; and  from such grains enough of the essence might, perhaps, have been  drawn forth, to add a few years of existence to some feeble  graybeard--granting, what rests on no proofs, that some of the  alchemists reached an age rarely given to man.  But it is not in  the miserly crucible, it is in the matrix of Nature herself, that  we must seek in prolific abundance Nature's grand principle--life.  As the loadstone is rife with the magnetic virtue, as amber  contains the electric, so in this substance, to which we yet want a  name, is found the bright life-giving fluid.  In the old gold mines  of Asia and Europe the substance exists, but can rarely be met  with.  The soil for its nutriment may there be well nigh exhausted.  It is here, where Nature herself is all vital with youth, that the  nutriment of youth must be sought.  Near this spot is gold; guide  me to it.\"    \"You cannot come with me.  The place which I know as auriferous is  some miles distant, the way rugged.  You cannot walk to it.  It is  true I have horses, but--\"    \"Do you think I have come this distance and not foreseen and  forestalled all that I want for my object?  Trouble yourself not  with conjectures how I can arrive at the place.  I have provided  the means to arrive at and leave it.  My litter and its bearers are  in reach of my call.  Give me your arm to the rising ground, fifty  yards from your door.\"    I obeyed mechanically, stifling all surprise.  I had made my  resolve, and admitted no thought that could shake it.    When we reached the summit of the grassy hillock, which sloped from  the road that led to the seaport, Margrave, after pausing to  recover breath, lifted up his voice, in a key, not loud, but shrill  and slow and prolonged, half cry and half chant, like the  nighthawk's.  Through the air--so limpid and still, bringing near  far objects, far sounds--the voice pierced its way, artfully  pausing, till wave after wave of the atmosphere bore and  transmitted it on.    In a few minutes the call seemed re-echoed, so exactly, so  cheerily, that for the moment I thought that the note was the  mimicry of the shy mocking lyre bird, which mimics so merrily all  that it hears in its coverts, from the whir of the locust to the  howl of the wild dog.    \"What king,\" said the mystical charmer, and as he spoke he  carelessly rested his hand on my shoulder, so that I trembled to  feel that this dread son of Nature, Godless and soulless, who had  been--and, my heart whispered, who still could be--my bane and mind  darkener, leaned upon me for support, as the spoiled younger-born  on his brother--\"what king,\" said this cynical mocker, with his  beautiful boyish face--\"what king in your civilized Europe has the  sway of a chief of the East?  What link is so strong between mortal  and mortal as that between lord and slave?  I transport you poor  fools from the land of their birth; they preserve here their old  habits--obedience and awe.  They would wait till they starved in  the solitude--wait to hearken and answer my call.  And I, who thus  rule them, or charm them--I use and despise them.  They know that,  and yet serve me!  Between you and me, my philosopher, there is but  one thing worth living for--life for oneself.\"    Is it age, is it youth, that thus shocks all my sense, in my solemn  completeness of man?  Perhaps, in great capitals, young men of  pleasure will answer, \"It is youth; and we think what he says!\"  Young friends, I do not believe you.      II      Along the grass track I saw now, under the moon, just risen, a  strange procession--never seen before in Australian pastures.  It  moved on, noiselessly but quickly.  We descended the hillock, and  met it on the way; a sable litter, borne by four men, in unfamiliar  Eastern garments; two other servitors, more bravely dressed, with  yataghans and silver-hilted pistols in their belts, preceded this  somber equipage.  Perhaps Margrave divined the disdainful thought  that passed through my mind, vaguely and half-unconsciously; for he  said with a hollow, bitter laugh that had replaced the lively peal  of his once melodious mirth:    \"A little leisure and a little gold, and your raw colonist, too,  will have the tastes of a pasha.\"    I made no answer.  I had ceased to care who and what was my  tempter.  To me his whole being was resolved into one problem: had  he a secret by which death could be turned from Lilian?    But now, as the litter halted, from the long, dark shadow which it  cast upon the turf, the figure of a woman emerged and stood before  us.  The outlines of her shape were lost in the loose folds of a  black mantle, and the features of her face were hidden by a black  veil, except only the dark-bright, solemn eyes.  Her stature was  lofty, her bearing majestic, whether in movement or repose.    Margrave accosted her in some language unknown to me.  She replied  in what seemed to me the same tongue.  The tones of her voice were  sweet, but inexpressibly mournful.  The words that they uttered  appeared intended to warn, or deprecate, or dissuade; but they  called to Margrave's brow a lowering frown, and drew from his lips  a burst of unmistakable anger.  The woman rejoined, in the same  melancholy music of voice.  And Margrave then, leaning his arm upon  her shoulder, as he had leaned it on mine, drew her away from the  group into a neighboring copse of the flowering eucalypti--mystic  trees, never changing the hues of their pale-green leaves, ever  shifting the tints of their ash-gray, shedding bark.  For some  moments I gazed on the two human forms, dimly seen by the glinting  moonlight through the gaps in the foliage.  Then turning away my  eyes, I saw, standing close at my side, a man whom I had not  noticed before.  His footstep, as it stole to me, had fallen on the  sward without sound.  His dress, though Oriental, differed from  that of his companions, both in shape and color--fitting close to  the breast, leaving the arms bare to the elbow, and of a uniform  ghastly white, as are the cerements of the grave.  His visage was  even darker than those of the Syrians or Arabs behind him, and his  features were those of a bird of prey: the beak of the eagle, but  the eye of the vulture.  His cheeks were hollow; the arms, crossed  on his breast, were long and fleshless.  Yet in that skeleton form  there was a something which conveyed the idea of a serpent's  suppleness and strength; and as the hungry, watchful eyes met my  own startled gaze, I recoiled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18350"],[0,"Social Life in the Insect World (#14)"],[1,"on their native bushes.    Communal life has its dangers. When the hay is low in the manger  donkeys grow quarrelsome, although usually so pacific. My guests might  well, in a season of dearth, have lost their tempers and begun to fight  one another; but I was careful to keep the cages well provided with  crickets, which were renewed twice a day. If civil war broke out famine  could not be urged in excuse.    At the outset matters did not go badly. The company lived in peace, each  Mantis pouncing upon and eating whatever came her way, without  interfering with her neighbours. But this period of concord was of brief  duration. The bellies of the insects grew fuller: the eggs ripened in  their ovaries: the time of courtship and the laying season was  approaching. Then a kind of jealous rage seized the females, although no  male was present to arouse such feminine rivalry. The swelling of the  ovaries perverted my flock, and infected them with an insane desire to  devour one another. There were threats, horrid encounters, and cannibal  feasts. Once more the spectral pose was seen, the hissing of the wings,  and the terrible gesture of the talons outstretched and raised above the  head. The females could not have looked more terrible before a grey  cricket or a Decticus. Without any motives that I could see, two  neighbours suddenly arose in the attitude of conflict. They turned their  heads to the right and the left, provoking one another, insulting one  another. The _pouf! pouf!_ of the wings rubbed by the abdomen sounded  the charge. Although the duel was to terminate at the first scratch,  without any more serious consequence, the murderous talons, at first  folded, open like the leaves of a book, and are extended laterally to  protect the long waist and abdomen. The pose is superb, but less  terrific than that assumed when the fight is to be to the death.    Then one of the grappling-hooks with a sudden spring flies out and  strikes the rival; with the same suddenness it flies back and assumes a  position of guard. The adversary replies with a riposte. The fencing  reminds one not a little of two cats boxing one another's ears. At the  first sign of blood on the soft abdomen, or even at the slightest wound,  one admits herself to be conquered and retires. The other refurls her  battle standard and goes elsewhere to meditate the capture of a cricket,  apparently calm, but in reality ready to recommence the quarrel.    Very often the matter turns out more tragically. In duels to the death  the pose of attack is assumed in all its beauty. The murderous talons  unfold and rise in the air. Woe to the vanquished! for the victor seizes  her in her vice-like grip and at once commences to eat her; beginning,  needless to say, at the back of the neck. The odious meal proceeds as  calmly as if it were merely a matter of munching a grasshopper; and the  survivor enjoys her sister quite as much as lawful game. The spectators  do not protest, being only too willing to do the like on the first  occasion.    Ferocious creatures! It is said that even wolves do not eat one another.  The Mantis is not so scrupulous; she will eat her fellows when her  favourite quarry, the cricket, is attainable and abundant.    These observations reach a yet more revolting extreme. Let us inquire  into the habits of the insect at breeding time, and to avoid the  confusion of a crowd let us isolate the couples under different covers.  Thus each pair will have their own dwelling, where nothing can trouble  their honeymoon. We will not forget to provide them with abundant food;  there shall not be the excuse of hunger for what is to follow.    We are near the end of August. The male Mantis, a slender and elegant  lover, judges the time to be propitious. He makes eyes at his powerful  companion; he turns his head towards her; he bows his neck and raises  his thorax. His little pointed face almost seems to wear an expression.  For a long time he stands thus motionless, in contemplation of the  desired one. The latter, as though indifferent, does not stir. Yet the  lover has seized upon a sign of consent: a sign of which I do not know  the secret. He approaches: suddenly he erects his wings, which are  shaken with a convulsive tremor.    This is his declaration. He throws himself timidly on the back of his  corpulent companion; he clings to her desperately, and steadies himself.  The prelude to the embrace is generally lengthy, and the embrace will  sometimes last for five or six hours.    Nothing worthy of notice occurs during this time. Finally the two  separate, but they are soon to be made one flesh in a much more intimate  fashion. If the poor lover is loved by his mistress as the giver of  fertility, she also loves him as the choicest of game. During the day,  or at latest on the morrow, he is seized by his companion, who first  gnaws through the back of his neck, according to use and wont, and then  methodically devours him, mouthful by mouthful, leaving only the wings.  Here we have no case of jealousy, but simply a depraved taste.    I had the curiosity to wonder how a second male would be received by a  newly fecundated female. The result of my inquiry was scandalous. The  Mantis in only too many cases is never sated with embraces and conjugal  feasts. After a rest, of variable duration, whether the eggs have been  laid or not, a second male is welcomed and devoured like the first. A  third succeeds him, does his duty, and affords yet another meal. A  fourth suffers a like fate. In the course of two weeks I have seen the  same Mantis treat seven husbands in this fashion. She admitted all to  her embraces, and all paid for the nuptial ecstasy with their lives.    There are exceptions, but such orgies are frequent. On very hot days,  when the atmospheric tension is high, they are almost the general rule.  At such times the Mantis is all nerves. Under covers which contain large  households the females devour one another more frequently than ever;  under the covers which contain isolated couples the males are devoured  more eagerly than usual when their office has been fulfilled.    I might urge, in mitigation of these conjugal atrocities, that the  Mantis does not commit them when at liberty. The male, his function once  fulfilled, surely has time to wander off, to escape far away, to flee  the terrible spouse, for in my cages he is given a respite, often of a  whole day. What really happens by the roadside and in the thickets I do  not know; chance, a poor schoolmistress, has never instructed me  concerning the love-affairs of the Mantis when at liberty. I am obliged  to watch events in my laboratory, where the captives, enjoying plenty of  sunshine, well nourished, and comfortably lodged, do not seem in any way  to suffer from nostalgia. They should behave there as they behave under  normal conditions.    Alas! the facts force me to reject the statement that the males have  time to escape; for I once surprised a male, apparently in the  performance of his vital functions, holding the female tightly  embraced--but he had no head, no neck, scarcely any thorax! The female,  her head turned over her shoulder, was peacefully browsing on the  remains of her lover! And the masculine remnant, firmly anchored,  continued its duty!    Love, it is said, is stronger than death! Taken literally, never has an  aphorism received a more striking confirmation. Here was a creature  decapitated, amputated as far as the middle of the thorax; a corpse  which still struggled to give life. It would not relax its hold until  the abdomen itself, the seat of the organs of procreation, was attacked.    The custom of eating the lover after the consummation of the nuptials,  of making a meal of the exhausted pigmy, who is henceforth good for  nothing, is not so difficult to understand, since insects can hardly be  accused of sentimentality; but to devour him during the act surpasses  anything that the most morbid mind could imagine. I have seen the thing  with my own eyes, and I have not yet recovered from my surprise.    Could this unfortunate creature have fled and saved himself, being thus  attacked in the performance of his functions? No. We must conclude that  the loves of the Mantis are fully as tragic, perhaps even more so, than  those of the spider. I do not deny that the limited area of the cage may  favour the massacre of the males; but the cause of such butchering must  be sought elsewhere. It is perhaps a reminiscence of the carboniferous  period when the insect world gradually took shape through prodigious  procreation. The Orthoptera, of which the Mantes form a branch, are the  first-born of the insect world.    Uncouth, incomplete in their transformation, they wandered amidst the  arborescent foliage, already flourishing when none of the insects sprung  of more complex forms of metamorphosis were as yet in existence: neither  butterflies, beetles, flies, nor bees. Manners were not gentle in those  epochs, which were full of the lust to destroy in order to produce; and  the Mantis, a feeble memory of those ancient ghosts, might well preserve  the customs of an earlier age. The utilisation of the males as food is a  custom in the case of other members of the Mantis family. It is, I must  admit, a general habit. The little grey Mantis, so small and looking so  harmless in her cage, which never seeks to harm her neighbours in spite  of her crowded quarters, falls upon her male and devours him as  ferociously as the Praying Mantis. I have worn myself out in trying to  procure the indispensable complements to my female specimens. No sooner  is my capture, strongly winged, vigorous and alert, introduced into the  cage than he is seized, more often than not, by one of the females who  no longer have need of his assistance and devoured. Once the ovaries are  satisfied the two species of Mantis conceive an antipathy for the male;  or rather they regard him"]]]
