VI, 16.          \"How veiled are ye, O My creatures, ... who, without ...\"      How veiled are ye, O My creatures,(62) ... who, without any right, have  consigned Him unto a mountain [Maku], not one of whose inhabitants is  worthy of mention... With Him, which is with Me, there is no one except  him who is one of the Letters of the Living of My Book. In His presence,  which is My Presence, there is not at night even a lighted lamp! And yet,  in places [of worship] which in varying degrees reach out unto Him,  unnumbered lamps are shining! All that is on earth hath been created for  Him, and all partake with delight of His benefits, and yet they are so  veiled from Him as to refuse Him even a lamp!    In this Day therefore I bear witness unto My creatures, for the witness of  no one other than Myself hath been or shall ever be worthy of mention in  My presence. I affirm that no Paradise is more sublime for My creatures  than to stand before My face and to believe in My holy Words, while no  fire hath been or will be fiercer for them than to be veiled from the  Manifestation of My exalted Self and to disbelieve in My Words.    Ye may contend: 'How doth He speak on our behalf?' Have ye not perused the  unseemly words ye uttered in the past, as reflected in the text of My  Book, and still ye feel not ashamed? Ye have now seen the truth of My Book  conclusively established and today every one of you doth profess belief in  Me through that Book. The day is not far distant when ye shall readily  realize that your glory lieth in your belief in these holy verses. Today,  however, when only belief in this Faith truly profiteth you, ye have  debarred yourselves therefrom by reason of the things which are  disadvantageous unto you and will inflict harm upon you, whereas He Who is  the Manifestation of My Self hath been and shall ever remain immune from  any harm whatever, and any loss that hath appeared or will appear shall  eventually revert unto yourselves. II, 1.          \"How vast the number of people who are well versed in ...\"      How vast the number of people who are well versed in every science, yet it  is their adherence to the holy Word of God which will determine their  faith, inasmuch as the fruit of every science is none other than the  knowledge of divine precepts and submission unto His good-pleasure. II, 1.          \"No created thing shall ever attain its paradise unless it ...\"      No created thing shall ever attain its paradise unless it appeareth in its  highest prescribed degree of perfection. For instance, this crystal  representeth the paradise of the stone whereof its substance is composed.  Likewise there are various stages in the paradise for the crystal  itself... So long as it was stone it was worthless, but if it attaineth  the excellence of ruby--a potentiality which is latent in it--how much a  carat will it be worth? Consider likewise every created thing.    Man's highest station, however, is attained through faith in God in every  Dispensation and by acceptance of what hath been revealed by Him, and not  through learning; inasmuch as in every nation there are learned men who  are versed in divers sciences. Nor is it attainable through wealth; for it  is similarly evident that among the various classes in every nation there  are those possessed of riches. Likewise are other transitory things.    True knowledge, therefore, is the knowledge of God, and this is none other  than the recognition of His Manifestation in each Dispensation. Nor is  there any wealth save in poverty in all save God and sanctity from aught  else but Him--a state that can be realized only when demonstrated towards  Him Who is the Dayspring of His Revelation. This doth not mean, however,  that one ought not to yield praise unto former Revelations. On no account  is this acceptable, inasmuch as it behooveth man, upon reaching the age of  nineteen, to render thanksgiving for the day of his conception as an  embryo. For had the embryo not existed, how could he have reached his  present state? Likewise had the religion taught by Adam not existed, this  Faith would not have attained its present stage. Thus consider thou the  development of God's Faith until the end that hath no end. V, 4.          \"Twelve hundred and seventy years have elapsed since ...\"      Twelve hundred and seventy years have elapsed since the declaration of  Muhammad, and each year unnumbered people have circumambulated the House  of God [Mecca]. In the concluding year of this period He Who is Himself  the Founder of the House went on pilgrimage. Great God! There was a vast  concourse of pilgrims from every sect. Yet not one recognized Him, though  He recognized every one of them--souls tightly held in the grasp of His  former commandment. The only person who recognized Him and performed  pilgrimage with Him is the one round whom revolve eight Vahids,(63) in  whom God hath gloried before the Concourse on high by virtue of his  absolute detachment and for his being wholly devoted to the Will of God.  This doth not mean that he was made the object of a special favour, nay,  this is a favour which God hath vouchsafed unto all men, yet they have  suffered themselves to be veiled from it. The Commentary on the Surih of  Joseph had, in the first year of this Revelation, been widely distributed.  Nevertheless, when the people realized that fellow supporters were not  forthcoming they hesitated to accept it; while it never occurred to them  that the very Qur'an whereunto unnumbered souls bear fealty today, was  revealed in the midmost heart of the Arab world, yet to outward seeming  for no less than seven years no one acknowledged its truth except the  Commander of the Faithful [Imam 'Ali]--may the peace of God rest upon  him--who, in response to the conclusive proofs advanced by God's supreme  Testimony, recognized the Truth and did not fix his eyes on others. Thus  on the Day of Resurrection God will ask everyone of his understanding and  not of his following in the footsteps of others. How often a person,  having inclined his ears to the holy verses, would bow down in humility  and would embrace the Truth, while his leader would not do so. Thus every  individual must bear his own responsibility, rather than someone else  bearing it for him. At the time of the appearance of Him Whom God will  make manifest the most distinguished among the learned and the lowliest of  men shall both be judged alike. How often the most insignificant of men  have acknowledged the truth, while the most learned have remained wrapt in  veils. Thus in every Dispensation a number of souls enter the fire by  reason of their following in the footsteps of others. IV, 18.          \"Better is it for a person to write down but one of His ...\"      Better is it for a person to write down but one of His verses than to  transcribe the whole of the Bayan and all the books which have been  written in the Dispensation of the Bayan. For everything shall be set  aside except His Writings, which will endure until the following  Revelation. And should anyone inscribe with true faith but one letter of  that Revelation, his recompense would be greater than for inscribing all  the heavenly Writings of the past and all that has been written during  previous Dispensations. Likewise continue thou to ascend through one  Revelation after another, knowing that thy progress in the Knowledge of  God shall never come to an end, even as it can have no beginning. VII, 13.          \"O People of the Bayan! Be on your guard; for on the ...\"      O People of the Bayan! Be on your guard; for on the Day of Resurrection no  one shall find a place to flee to. He will shine forth suddenly, and will  pronounce judgement as He pleaseth. If it be His wish He will cause the  abased to be exalted, and the exalted to be abased, even as He did in the  Bayan, couldst thou but understand. And no one but Him is equal unto this.  Whatever He ordaineth will be fulfilled, and nothing will remain  unfulfilled. VII, 9.          \"Since all men have issued forth from the shadow of the ...\"      Since all men have issued forth from the shadow of the signs of His  Divinity and Lordship, they always tend to take a path, lofty and high.  And because they are bereft of a discerning eye to recognize their  Beloved, they fall short of their duty to manifest meekness and humility  towards Him. Nevertheless, from the beginning of their lives till the end  thereof, in conformity with the laws established in the previous religion,  they worship God, piously adore Him, bow themselves before His divine  Reality and show submissiveness toward His exalted Essence. At the hour of  His manifestation, however, they all turn their gaze toward their own  selves and are thus shut out from Him, inasmuch as they fancifully regard  Him as one like unto themselves. Far from the glory of God is such a  comparison. Indeed that august Being resembleth the physical sun, His  verses are like its rays, and all believers, should they truly believe in  Him, are as mirrors wherein the sun is reflected. Their light is thus a  mere reflection. VII, 15.          \"O People of the Bayan! If ye believe in Him Whom God ...\"      O People of the Bayan! If ye believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest,  to your own behoof do ye believe. He hath been and ever will remain  independent of all men. For instance, were ye to place unnumbered mirrors  before the sun, they would all reflect the sun and produce impressions  thereof, whereas the sun is in itself wholly independent of the existence  of the mirrors and of the suns which they reproduce. Such are the bounds  of the contingent beings in their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18833"],[0,"With Clive in India; Or, The Beginnings of an Empire (#14)"],[1,",\" the doctor said. \"They both showed great coolness and  courage, in the affairs I spoke of. Have you any surgeons with you,  Captain Clive? If not, I hope that I shall go with any expedition that  will take place. The doctor here is just recovering from an attack of  fever and will not be fit, for weeks, for the fatigues of active  service.    \"May I ask who is to command the expedition?\"    \"I am,\" Clive said quietly. \"You may well look surprised that an  officer who has but just joined should have been selected; but in  fact, there is no one else. Cope and Gingen are both at Trichinopoli,  and even if they were not--\" he paused, and a shrug of the shoulders  expressed his meaning clearly. \"Mr. Saunders is good enough to feel  some confidence in my capacity, and I trust that I shall not  disappoint him.    \"We are going--but this, mind, is a profound secret till the day we  march--to attack Arcot. It is the only possible way of relieving  Trichinopoli.\"    \"To attack Arcot?\" Doctor Rae said, astonished. \"That does indeed  appear a desperate enterprise, with such a small body as you have at  your command, and these, entirely new recruits. But I recognize the  importance of the enterprise. If you should succeed, it will draw off  Chunda Sahib from Trichinopoli. It's a grand idea, Captain Clive, a  grand idea, though I own it seems to me a desperate one.\"    \"In desperate times we must take desperate measures, Doctor,\" Captain  Clive said. \"Now I must be going on after the governor. I shall see  you tomorrow.    \"I will not forget you, young gentlemen.\"    So saying, he proceeded to the factory.    It was afterwards known that the proposal, to effect a diversion by an  expedition against Arcot, was the proposal of Clive himself. Upon  arriving at Trichinopoli, he had at once seen that all was lost,  there. The soldiers were utterly dispirited and demoralized. They had  lost all confidence in themselves and their officers, who had also  lost confidence in themselves. At Trichinopoli nothing was to be done,  and it must be either starved out, or fall an easy prey should the  enemy advance to the assault. Clive had, then, after a few days' stay,  made his way out from the town, and proceeded to Fort Saint David,  where he had laid before the governor the proposal, which he believed  to be the only possible measure which could save the English in India.    The responsibility thus set before Mr. Saunders was a grave one. Upon  the one hand, he was asked to detach half of the already inadequate  garrisons of Fort Saint David and Madras upon an enterprise which, if  unsuccessful, must be followed by the loss of the British possessions,  of which he was governor. He would have to take this great risk, not  upon the advice of a tried veteran like Lawrence, but on that of a  young man, only a month or two back a civilian; and it was to this  young man, untried in command, that the leadership of this desperate  enterprise must be intrusted.    Upon the other hand, if he refused to take this responsibility the  fall of Trichinopoli, followed by the loss of the three English ports,  was certain. But for this no blame or responsibility could rest upon  him. Many men would have chosen the second alternative; but Mr.  Saunders had, since Clive's return, seen a good deal of him, and had  been impressed with a strong sense of his capacity, energy, and good  sense. Mr. Pigot, who had seen Clive under the most trying  circumstances, was also his warm supporter; and Mr. Saunders at last  determined to adopt Clive's plan, and to stake the fortunes of the  English in India on this desperate venture.    Accordingly, leaving a hundred men only at Fort Saint David, he  decided to carry the remainder to Madras; and that Clive, leaving only  fifty behind as a garrison there, should, with the whole available  force, march upon Arcot.    The next morning as Charlie and Peters were at breakfast, a native  entered with a letter from the chief factor, to the effect that their  services in the office would be dispensed with, and that they were, in  accordance with their request, to report themselves to Captain Clive  as volunteers. No words can express the joy of the two lads, at  receiving the intelligence, and they created so much noise, in the  exuberance of their delight, that Mr. Johnson came in from the next  room to see what was the matter.    \"Ah!\" he said, when he heard the cause of the uproar; \"when I first  came out here, I should have done the same, and should have regarded  the certainty of being knocked on the head as cheerfully as you do.  Eight years out here takes the enthusiasm out of a man, and I shall  wait quietly to see whether we are to be transferred to Calcutta, or  shipped back to England.\"    A quarter of an hour later, Charlie and Peters joined Captain Clive in  the camp.    \"Ah!\" he said, \"My young friends, I'm glad to see you. There is plenty  for you to do, at once. We shall march tomorrow, and all preparations  have to be made. You will both have the rank of ensign, while you  serve with me. I have only six other officers, two of whom are  civilians who, like yourselves, volunteered at Saint David's. They are  of four or five year's standing and, as they speak the language, they  will serve with the Sepoys under one of my military officers. Another  officer, who is also an ensign, will take the command of the three  guns. The Europeans are divided into two companies. One of you will be  attached to each. The remaining officer commands both.\"    During the day the lads had not a moment to themselves, and were  occupied until late at night in superintending the packing of stores  and tents; and the following morning, the 26th of August, 1751, the  force marched from Madras. It consisted of two hundred of the  Company's English troops, three hundred Sepoys, and three small guns.  They were led, as has been said, by eight European officers, of whom  only Clive and another had ever heard a shot fired in action, four of  the eight being young men in the civil service, who had volunteered.    Charlie was glad to find that among the company to which he was  appointed was the detachment which had come out with him on board  ship; and the moment these heard that he was to accompany them, as  their officer, Tim Kelly pressed forward and begged that he might be  allowed to act as Charlie's servant, a request which the lad readily  complied with.    The march the first day was eighteen miles, a distance which, in such  a climate, was sufficient to try to the utmost the powers of the young  recruits. The tents were soon erected, each officer having two or  three native servants, that number being indispensable in India.  Charlie and Peters had one tent between them, which was shared by two  other officers, as the column had moved in the lightest order possible  in India.    \"Sure, Mr. Marryat,\" Tim Kelly said to him confidentially, \"that black  hathen of a cook is going to pison ye. I have been watching him, and  there he is putting all sorts of outlandish things into the mate. He's  been pounding them up on stones, for all the world like an apothecary,  and even if he manes no mischief, the food isn't fit to set before a  dog, let alone a Christian and a gintleman like yourself. If you give  the word, sir, I knock him over with the butt end of my musket, and do  the cooking for you, meself.\"    \"I'm afraid the other officers wouldn't agree to that, Tim,\" Charlie  said, laughing. \"The food isn't so bad as it looks, and I don't think  an apprenticeship among the Irish bogs is likely to have turned you  out a first rate cook, Tim; except, of course, for potatoes.\"    \"Sure, now, yer honor, I can fry a rasher of bacon with any man.\"    \"Perhaps you might do that, Tim, but as we've no bacon here, that  won't help us. No, we must put up with the cook, and I don't think any  of us will be the worse for the dinner.\"    On the morning of the 29th Clive reached Conjeveram, a town of some  size, forty-two miles from Madras. Here Clive gained the first  trustworthy intelligence as to Arcot. He found the garrison  outnumbered his own force by two to one; and that, although the  defences were not in a position to resist an attack by heavy guns,  they were capable of being defended against any force not so provided.  Clive at once despatched a messenger to Madras, begging that two  eighteen-pounders might be sent after him; and then, without awaiting  their coming he marched forward against Arcot.        Chapter 7: The Siege Of Arcot.      From Conjeveram to Arcot is twenty-seven miles, and the troops, in  spite of a delay caused by a tremendous storm of thunder and  lightning, reached the town in two days. The garrison, struck with  panic at the sudden coming of a foe, when they deemed themselves in  absolute security, at once abandoned the fort, which they might easily  have maintained until Chunda Sahib was able to send a force to relieve  it. The city was incapable of defence after the fort had been  abandoned, and Clive took possession of both, without firing a shot.    He at once set to work to store up provisions in the fort, in which he  found eight guns and an abundance of ammunition, as he foresaw the  likelihood of his having to stand a siege there; and then, leaving a  garrison to defend it in his absence, marched on the 4th of September  with the rest of his forces against the enemy, who had retired from  the town to the mud fort of Timari, six miles south of Arcot. After a  few discharges with their cannon they retired hastily, and Clive  marched back to Arcot.    Two days later, however, he found that they had been reinforced, and  as their position threatened his line of communications, he again  advanced towards them. He found the enemy about two thousand strong,  drawn up in a grove under cover of the guns of the fort. The grove was  inclosed by a bank and ditch, and some fifty yards away was a dry  tank, inclosed by a"]]]
