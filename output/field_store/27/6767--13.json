For the painter, flowers and animals form a sufficient  picture by themselves and are not felt to be inadequate because man is  absent. Portraits are frequent but a common form of European  composition, namely a group of figures subordinated to a principal one,  though not unknown, is comparatively rare.    How scanty are the records of great men in India! Great buildings  attract attention but who knows the names of the architects who planned  them or the kings who paid for them? We are not quite sure of the date  of Kalidasa, the Indian Shakespeare, and though the doctrines of  Sankara, Kabir, and Nanak still nourish, it is with difficulty that the  antiquary collects from the meagre legends clinging to their names a few  facts for their biographies. And Kings and Emperors, a class who in  Europe can count on being remembered if not esteemed after death, fare  even worse. The laborious research of Europeans has shown that Asoka and  Harsha were great monarchs. Their own countrymen merely say \"once upon a  time there was a king\" and recount some trivial story.    In fact, Hindus have a very weak historical sense. In this they are not  wholly wrong, for Europeans undoubtedly exaggerate the historical  treatment of thought and art[58]. In science, most students want to know  what is certain in theory and useful in practice, not what were the  discarded hypotheses and imperfect instruments of the past. In  literature, when the actors and audience are really interested, the date  of Shakespeare and even the authorship of the play cease to be  important[59]. In the same way Hindus want to know whether doctrines and  speculations are true, whether a man can make use of them in his own  religious experiences and aspirations. They care little for the date,  authorship, unity and textual accuracy of the Bhagavad-gita. They simply  ask, is it true, what can I get from it? The European critic, who  expects nothing of the sort from the work, racks his brains to know who  wrote it and when, who touched it up and why?    The Hindus are also indifferent to the past because they do not  recognize that the history of the world, the whole cosmic process, has  any meaning or value. In most departments of Indian thought, great or  small, the conception of [Greek: telos] or purpose is absent, and if the  European reader thinks this a grave lacuna, let him ask himself whether  satisfied love has any [Greek: telos]. For Hindus the world is endless  repetition not a progress towards an end. Creation has rarely the sense  which it bears for Europeans. An infinite number of times the universe  has collapsed in flaming or watery ruin, aeons of quiescence follow the  collapse and then the Deity (he has done it an infinite number of times)  emits again from himself worlds and souls of the same old kind. But  though, as I have said before, all varieties of theological opinion may  be found in India, he is usually represented as moved by some  reproductive impulse rather than as executing a plan. Sankara says  boldly that no motive can be attributed to God, because he being perfect  can desire no addition to his perfection, so that his creative activity  is mere exuberance, like the sport of young princes, who take exercise  though they are not obliged to do so.    Such views are distasteful to Europeans. Our vanity impels us to invent  explanations of the Universe which make our own existence important and  significant. Nor does European science altogether support the Indian  doctrine of periodicity. It has theories as to the probable origin of  the solar system and other similar systems, but it points to the  conclusion that the Universe as a whole is not appreciably affected by  the growth or decay of its parts, whereas Indian imagination thinks of  universal cataclysms and recurring periods of quiescence in which  nothing whatever remains except the undifferentiated divine spirit.    Western ethics generally aim at teaching a man how to act: Eastern  ethics at forming a character. A good character will no doubt act  rightly when circumstances require action, but he need not seek  occasions for action, he may even avoid them, and in India the  passionless sage is still in popular esteem superior to warriors,  statesmen and scientists.      15. _Eastern Polytheism_    Different as India and China are, they agree in this that in order not  to misapprehend their religious condition we must make our minds  familiar with a new set of relations. The relations of religion to  philosophy, to ethics, and to the state, as well as the relations of  different religions to one another, are not the same as in Europe. China  and India are pagan, a word which I deprecate if it is understood to  imply inferiority but which if used in a descriptive and respectful  sense is very useful. Christianity and Islam are organized religions.  They say (or rather their several sects say) that they each not only  possess the truth but that all other creeds and rites are wrong. But  paganism is not organized: it rarely presents anything like a church  united under one head: still more rarely does it condemn or interfere  with other religions unless attacked first. Buddhism stands between the  two classes. Like Christianity and Islam it professes to teach the only  true law, but unlike them it is exceedingly tolerant and many Buddhists  also worship Hindu or Chinese gods.    Popular religion in India and China is certainly polytheistic, yet if  one uses this word in contrast to the monotheism of Islam and of  Protestantism the antithesis is unjust, for the polytheist does not  believe in many creators and rulers of the world, in many Allahs or  Jehovahs, but he considers that there are many spiritual beings, with  different spheres and powers, to the most appropriate of whom he  addresses his petitions. Polytheism and image-worship lie under an  unmerited stigma in Europe. We generally assume that to believe in one  God is obviously better, intellectually and ethically, than to believe  in many. Yet Trinitarian religions escape being polytheistic only by  juggling with words, and if Hindus and Chinese are polytheists so are  the Roman and Oriental Churches, for there is no real distinction  between praying to the Madonna, Saints and Angels, and propitiating  minor deities. William James[60] has pointed out that polytheism is not  theoretically absurd and is practically the religion of many Europeans.  In some ways it is more intelligible and reasonable than monotheism. For  if there is only one personal God, I do not understand how anything that  can be called a person can be so expanded as to be capable of hearing  and answering the prayers of the whole world. Anything susceptible of  such extension must be more than a person. Is it not at least equally  reasonable to assume that there are many spirits, or many shapes taken  by the superpersonal world spirit, with which the soul can get into  touch?    The worship of images cannot be recommended without qualification, for  it seems to require artists capable of making a worthy representation of  the divine. And it must be confessed that many figures in Indian  temples, such as the statues of Kali, seem repulsive or grotesque,  though a Hindu might say that none of them are so strange in idea or so  horrible in appearance as the crucifix. But the claim of the iconoclast  from the times of the Old Testament onwards that he worships a spirit  whereas others worship wood and stone is true only of the lowest phases  of religion, if even there. Hindu theologians distinguish different  kinds of _avataras_ or ways in which God descends into the world: among  them are incarnations like Krishna, the presence of God in the human  heart and his presence in a symbol or image (_arca_). It may be  difficult to decide how far the symbol and the spirit are kept separate  either in the East or in Europe, but no one can attend a great  car-festival in southern India or the feast of Durga in Bengal without  feeling and in some measure sharing the ecstasy and enthusiasm of the  crowd. It is an enthusiasm such as may be evoked in critical times by a  king or a flag, and as the flag may do duty for the king and all that he  stands for, so may the image do duty for the deity.      16. _The Extravagance of Hinduism_    What I have just said applies to India rather than to China and so do  the observations which follow. India is the most religious country in  the world. The percentage of people who literally make religion their  chief business, who sacrifice to it money and life itself (for religious  suicide is not extinct), is far greater than elsewhere. Russia[61]  probably comes next but the other nations fall behind by a long  interval. Matter of fact respectable people--Chinese as well as  Europeans--call this attitude extravagance and it sometimes deserves the  name, for since there is no one creed or criterion in India, all sorts  of aboriginal or decadent superstitions command the respect due to the  name of religion.    This extravagance is both intellectual and moral. No story is too  extraordinary to be told of Hindu gods. They are the magicians of the  universe who sport with the forces of nature as easily as a conjuror in  a bazaar does tricks with a handful of balls. But though the average  Hindu would be shocked to hear the Puranas described as idle tales, yet  he does not make his creed depend on their accuracy, as many in Europe  make Christianity depend on miracles. The value of truth in religion is  rated higher in India than in Europe but it is not historical truth. The  Hindu approaches his sacred literature somewhat in the spirit in which  we approach Milton and Dante. The beauty and value of such poems is  clear. The question whether they are accurate reports of facts seems  irrelevant.

The charges against the zealots were twofold, that there had been no  persecution worthy of the name, such as to justify their doings, and  that those doings themselves were contrary to the teaching and spirit of  Christianity. The latter part of the charge has already been dealt with,  and may be considered sustained. As to the other part, the apologists,  it must be confessed, answer with a very uncertain sound. Sometimes,  indeed, they deny it point-blank:[1] \"as if,\" says Eulogius, \"the  destruction of our churches,[2] the insults heaped upon our clergy, the  monthly tax[3] which we pay, the perils of a hard life, lived on  sufferance, are nothing.\" These insults and affronts are continually  referred to. \"No one,\" says the same author,[4] \"can go out or come in  amongst us in security, no one pass a knot of Moslems in the street  without being treated with contumely. They mock at the marks[5] of our  order. They hoot at us and call us fools and vain. The very children  jeer at us, and even throw stones and potsherds at the priests. The  sound of the church-going bell[6] never fails to evoke from Moslem  hearers the foulest and most blasphemous language. They even deem it a  pollution to touch a Christian's garment.\" Alvar adds that the Moslems  would fall to cursing when they saw the cross;[7] and when they  witnessed a burial according to Christian rites, would say aloud, \"Shew  them no mercy, O God,\" throwing stones withal at the Lord's people, and  defiling their ears with the filthiest abuse.[8] \"Yet,\" he indignantly  exclaims, \"you say that this is not a time of persecution; nor is it, I  answer, a time of apostles. But I affirm that it is a deadly time[9] ...  are we not bowed beneath the yoke of slavery, burdened with intolerable  taxes, spoiled of our goods, lashed with the scourges of their abuse,  made a byword and a proverb, aye, a spectacle to all nations?\"[10]        [1] Eul., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" i. sec. 21: Alvar, \"Ind. Lum.,\" sec.      3.        [2] _Ibid._; and Alvar, \"Ind. Lum.,\" sec. 7.        [3] Leovigild, \"De habitu Clericorum.\" \"Migne,\" 121, p. 565.

Lum.,\" sec. 6, \"Derisioni et contemptui      inhiantes capita moventes infanda iterando congeminant.\" He      adds: \"Daily and nightly from their minarets they revile the      Lord by their invocation of Allah and Mohammed!\" Eul., \"Lib.      Ap.,\" sec. 19, confesses that hearing their call to prayer      always moved him to quote Psalm xcvi. 7: \"Confounded be all      they that worship carved images\"--a very irrelevant      malediction, as applied to the Moslems.        [7] Alvar, l.l., \"Fidei signum opprobrioso elogio decolorant.\"        [8] \"Spurcitiarum fimo.\"--_Ibid._        [9] \"Mortiferum.\"--\"Ind. Lum.,\" sec. 3.        [10] Alvar, \"Ind. Lum.,\" sec. 31, gives us a very savage      picture of the Moslem character: \"Sunt in superbia tumidi, in      tumore cordis elati, in delectatione carnalium operum fluidi,      in comestione superflui ... sine misericordia crudeles, sine      iustitia invasores, sine honore absque veritate, benignitatis      nescientes affectum ... humilitatem velut insaniam deridentes,      castitatem velut spurcitiam respuentes.\"    That there was a certain amount of social ill-treatment, and that the  lower classes of Moslems did not take any pains to conceal their dislike  and scorn of such Christian beliefs and rites as were at variance with  their own creed, and moreover regarded priests and monks with especial  aversion, there can be no doubt. But, on the other hand, there is no  want of evidence to show that the condition of the Christians was by no  means so bad as the apologists would have us suppose. Petty annoyances  could not fail to exist anywhere under such circumstances, as were  actually to be found in Spain at this time, and we may be sure that the  Christian priests in particular did not bear themselves with that  humility which might have ensured a mitigation of the annoyances.  Organised opposition to Christianity, unless the Moslem rule can itself  be called such, there was none, till it was called into being by the  action of the fanatics themselves. But apart from all the other facts  which point to this conclusion, we can call the apologists themselves in  evidence that there was no real persecution going on at the time of the  first martyrdoms.    Eulogius[1] admits that the Christians were not let or hindered in the  free exercise of their religion by saying that this state of things[2]  was not due to the forbearance (forsooth!) of the Moslems, but to the  Divine mercy. Alvar, too, in a passage which seems to contradict the  whole position which he is trying to defend, says[3]:--\"Though many were  the victims of persecution, very many others--and you cannot deny  it--offered themselves a voluntary sacrifice to the Lord. Is it not  clear that it was not the Arabs who began persecuting, but we who began  preaching? Read the story of the martyrs, and you will see that they  rushed voluntarily on their fate, not waiting the bidding of  persecutors, nor the snares of informers; aye, and--what is made so  strong a charge against them--that they tired out the forbearance of  their rulers and princes by insult upon insult.\"[4]        [1] \"Mem. Sanct.,\" i. sec. 29.        [2] Viz., \"Quod inter ipsos sine molestia fidei degimus.\"        [3] \"Ind. Lum.,\" sec. 3.        [4] \"Fatigasse praesides et principes multis      contumeliis.\"--_Ibid._    As to the other part of the accusation, that voluntary martyrs were no  martyrs, Eulogius could only declaim against the Scriptures quoted by  his opponents,[1] and refer to the morally blind, who make evil their  good, and take darkness to be their light;[2] while he brought forward a  saying of certain wise men that \"those martyrs will hold the first rank  in the heavenly companies who have gone to their death unsummoned.\"[3]    He also sought to defend the practice of reviling Mohammed by the plea  that exorcism was allowed against the devil, which is sufficiently  ridiculous; but Alvar goes further, and calmly assures us that these  insults and revilings of the prophet were merely a form of preaching[4]  to the poor benighted Moslems, naively remarking that the Scriptures  affirm that the Gospel of Christ must be preached to all nations.  Whereas, then, the Moslems had not been preached to, these martyred  saints had taken upon themselves the sacred duty of rendering them  \"debtors to the faith.\"    The second count[5] against the martyrs was that they had worked no  miracles--a serious deficiency in an age when miracles were almost the  test of sanctity. Eulogius[6] could only meet the charge by admitting  the fact, but adding that miracles were frequent in the early ages, in  order to establish Christianity on a firm basis; and that the constancy  of the martyrs was in itself a miracle (which was true, but not to the  point). Had he been content with this, he had done wisely; but he goes  on: \"Moreover, miracles are no sign of truth, as even the unbelievers  can work them.\"[7] Now, by trying to show why these martyrs did not  perform any miracles, he admits by implication that they were deficient  in this particular;[8] and yet in other parts of his work he mentions  miracles performed by these very martyrs, as, for instance, by Isaac,  and by Flora, and Maria.[9] So that the worthy priest is placed in this  dilemma: If miracles are really no sign of truth, why attribute them to  the martyrs, when, as is allowed elsewhere, they were unable to work  them? if, on the other hand, they did perform these miracles, why not  adduce them in evidence against the detractors?

Emetherius and Caledonius--a      book obviously of no authority.        [4] \"Ind. Lum.,\" sec. 10, \"In hac Israelitica gente nullus      hactenus exstitit praedicator, per quod debitores fidei      tenerentur. Isti enim (_i.e._, the martyrs) apostolatus vicem      in eosdem et evangelicam praedicationem impleverunt, eosque      fidei debitores reddiderunt.\"        [5] Eul., \"Mem. Sanct.,\" i. 13.        [6] \"Lib. Apol.,\" sec 7.        [7] \"Lib. Apol.,\" sec. 10.        [8] Cp. \"Mem. Sanct.,\" i. sec. 13.        [9] \"Mem. Sanct.,\" Pref., sec. 4.    The third objection is a curious one, that the martyrs were not put to  death by idolaters, but by men worshipping God and acknowledging a  divine law,[1] and therefore were not true martyrs. Eulogius misses the  true answer, which is obvious enough, and scornfully exclaims:--\"As if  they could be said to believe in God, who persecute His Church, and deem  it hateful to believe in a Christ who was very God and very man.\"[2]    Fourthly, the martyrs died a quick and easy death. But, as Eulogius  points out,[3] pain and torture give no additional claim to the martyr's  crown.    Lastly, it was objected that the bodies of these martyrs, as indeed was  to be expected, corrupted, and were even, in some cases, devoured by  dogs. \"What matter,\" says Eulogius,[4] \"since their souls are borne away  to celestial mansions.\"        [1] Eul. \"Lib. Apol.,\" sec. 3.        [2] _Ibid._, sec. 12.        [3] _Ibid._, sec. 5.        [4] \"Mem. Sanct.,\" i. sec. 17.    But"]]]
