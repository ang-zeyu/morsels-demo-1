The ascendancy  of storm and wind gods in some Babylonian cities may have been due to  the belief that they were the source of the \"air of life\". It is  possible that this conception was popularized by the Semites.  Inspiration was perhaps derived from these deities by burning incense,  which, if we follow evidence obtained elsewhere, induced a prophetic  trance. The gods were also invoked by incense. In the Flood legend the  Babylonian Noah burned incense. \"The gods smelled a sweet savour and  gathered like flies over the sacrificer.\" In Egypt devotees who  inhaled the breath of the Apis bull were enabled to prophesy.    In addition to water and atmospheric deities Babylonia had also its  fire gods, Girru, Gish Bar, Gibil, and Nusku. Their origin is obscure.  It is doubtful if their worshippers, like those of the Indian Agni,  believed that fire, the \"vital spark\", was the principle of life which  was manifested by bodily heat. The Aryan fire worshippers cremated  their dead so that the spirits might be transferred by fire to  Paradise. This practice, however, did not obtain among the fire  worshippers of Persia, nor, as was once believed, in Sumer or Akkad  either. Fire was, however, used in Babylonia for magical purposes. It  destroyed demons, and put to flight the spirits of disease. Possibly  the fire-purification ceremonies resembled those which were practised  by the Canaanites, and are referred to in the Bible. Ahaz \"made his  son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the  heathen\".[61] Ezekiel declared that \"when ye offer your gifts, when ye  make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with  all your idols\".[62] In _Leviticus_ it is laid down: \"Thou shalt not  let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Moloch\".[63] It may be  that in Babylonia the fire-cleansing ceremony resembled that which  obtained at Beltane (May Day) in Scotland, Germany, and other  countries. Human sacrifices might also have been offered up as burnt  offerings. Abraham, who came from the Sumerian city of Ur, was  prepared to sacrifice Isaac, Sarah's first-born. The fire gods of  Babylonia never achieved the ascendancy of the Indian Agni; they  appear to have resembled him mainly in so far as he was connected with  the sun. Nusku, like Agni, was also the \"messenger of the gods\". When  Merodach or Babylon was exalted as chief god of the pantheon his  messages were carried to Ea by Nusku. He may have therefore symbolized  the sun rays, for Merodach had solar attributes. It is possible that  the belief obtained among even the water worshippers of Eridu that the  sun and moon, which rose from the primordial deep, had their origin in  the everlasting fire in Ea's domain at the bottom of the sea. In the  Indian god Varuna's ocean home an \"Asura fire\" (demon fire) burned  constantly; it was \"bound and confined\", but could not be  extinguished. Fed by water, this fire, it was believed, would burst  forth at the last day and consume the universe.[64] A similar belief  can be traced in Teutonic mythology. The Babylonian incantation cult  appealed to many gods, but \"the most important share in the rites\",  says Jastrow, \"are taken by fire and water--suggesting, therefore,  that the god of water--more particularly Ea--and the god of fire ...  are the chief deities on which the ritual itself hinges\". In some  temples there was a _bit rimki_, a \"house of washing\", and a _bit  nuri_, a \"house of light\".[65]    It is possible, of course, that fire was regarded as the vital  principle by some city cults, which were influenced by imported ideas.  If so, the belief never became prevalent. The most enduring influence  in Babylonian religion was the early Sumerian; and as Sumerian modes  of thought were the outcome of habits of life necessitated by the  character of the country, they were bound, sooner or later, to leave a  deep impress on the minds of foreign peoples who settled in the Garden  of Western Asia. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that  imported deities assumed Babylonian characteristics, and were  identified or associated with Babylonian gods in the later imperial  pantheon.    Moon worship appears to have been as ancient as water worship, with  which, as we have seen, it was closely associated. It was widely  prevalent throughout Babylonia. The chief seat of the lunar deity,  Nannar or Sin, was the ancient city of Ur, from which Abraham migrated  to Harran, where the \"Baal\" (the lord) was also a moon god. Ur was  situated in Sumer, in the south, between the west bank of the  Euphrates and the low hills bordering the Arabian desert, and not far  distant from sea-washed Eridu. No doubt, like that city, it had its  origin at an exceedingly remote period. At any rate, the excavations  conducted there have afforded proof that it flourished in the  prehistoric period.    As in Arabia, Egypt, and throughout ancient Europe and elsewhere, the  moon god of Sumeria was regarded as the \"friend of man\". He controlled  nature as a fertilizing agency; he caused grass, trees, and crops to  grow; he increased flocks and herds, and gave human offspring. At Ur  he was exalted above Ea as \"the lord and prince of the gods, supreme  in heaven, the Father of all\"; he was also called \"great Anu\", an  indication that Anu, the sky god, had at one time a lunar character.  The moon god was believed to be the father of the sun god: he was the  \"great steer with mighty horns and perfect limbs\".    His name Sin is believed to be a corruption of \"Zu-ena\", which  signifies \"knowledge lord\".[66] Like the lunar Osiris of Egypt, he was  apparently an instructor of mankind; the moon measured time and  controlled the seasons; seeds were sown at a certain phase of the  moon, and crops were ripened by the harvest moon. The mountains of  Sinai and the desert of Sin are called after this deity.    As Nannar, which Jastrow considers to be a variation of \"Narnar\", the  \"light producer\", the moon god scattered darkness and reduced the  terrors of night. His spirit inhabited the lunar stone, so that moon  and stone worship were closely associated; it also entered trees and  crops, so that moon worship linked with earth worship, as both linked  with water worship.    The consort of Nannar was Nin-Uruwa, \"the lady of Ur\", who was also  called Nin-gala. She links with Ishtar as Nin, as Isis of Egypt linked  with other mother deities. The twin children of the moon were Mashu  and Mashtu, a brother and sister, like the lunar girl and boy of  Teutonic mythology immortalized in nursery rhymes as Jack and Jill.    Sun worship was of great antiquity in Babylonia, but appears to have  been seasonal in its earliest phases. No doubt the sky god Anu had his  solar as well as his lunar attributes, which he shared with Ea. The  spring sun was personified as Tammuz, the youthful shepherd, who was  loved by the earth goddess Ishtar and her rival Eresh-ki-gal, goddess  of death, the Babylonian Persephone. During the winter Tammuz dwelt in  Hades, and at the beginning of spring Ishtar descended to search for  him among the shades.[67] But the burning summer sun was symbolized as  a destroyer, a slayer of men, and therefore a war god. As Ninip or  Nirig, the son of Enlil, who was made in the likeness of Anu, he waged  war against the earth spirits, and was furiously hostile towards the  deities of alien peoples, as befitted a god of battle. Even his father  feared him, and when he was advancing towards Nippur, sent out Nusku,  messenger of the gods, to soothe the raging deity with soft words.  Ninip was symbolized as a wild bull, was connected with stone worship,  like the Indian destroying god Shiva, and was similarly a deity of  Fate. He had much in common with Nin-Girsu, a god of Lagash, who was  in turn regarded as a form of Tammuz.    Nergal, another solar deity, brought disease and pestilence, and,  according to Jensen, all misfortunes due to excessive heat. He was the  king of death, husband of Eresh-ki-gal, queen of Hades. As a war god  he thirsted for human blood, and was depicted as a mighty lion. He was  the chief deity of the city of Cuthah, which, Jastrow suggests, was  situated beside a burial place of great repute, like the Egyptian  Abydos.    The two great cities of the sun in ancient Babylonia were the Akkadian  Sippar and the Sumerian Larsa. In these the sun god, Shamash or  Babbar, was the patron deity. He was a god of Destiny, the lord of the  living and the dead, and was exalted as the great Judge, the lawgiver,  who upheld justice; he was the enemy of wrong, he loved righteousness  and hated sin, he inspired his worshippers with rectitude and punished  evildoers. The sun god also illumined the world, and his rays  penetrated every quarter: he saw all things, and read the thoughts of  men; nothing could be concealed from Shamash. One of his names was  Mitra, like the god who was linked with Varuna in the Indian  _Rigveda_. These twin deities, Mitra and Varuna, measured out the span  of human life. They were the source of all heavenly gifts: they  regulated sun and moon, the winds and waters, and the seasons.[68]    These did the gods establish in royal power over themselves, because  they were wise and the children of wisdom, and because they excelled  in power.--_Prof. Arnold's trans. of Rigvedic Hymn_.    Mitra and Varuna were protectors of hearth and home, and they  chastised sinners. \"In a striking passage of the _Mahabharata_\" says  Professor Moulton, \"one in which Indian thought comes nearest to the  conception of conscience, a kingly wrongdoer is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16658"],[0,"Piano and Song (#14)"],[1,"find suitable singing-professors, and who is to pay them  a sufficient salary? Therefore, away with this erroneous instruction of  children in singing! away with this abortion of philanthropy and the  musical folly of this extravagant age! Can such a premature, unrefined,  faulty screaming of children, or croaking in their throats, without  artistic cultivation and guidance, compensate for the later inevitable  hoarseness and loss of voice, and for the destruction of the organs of  singing?    The tenors who belong to these singing societies and institutions force  out and sacrifice their uncultured voices, and scream with throat,  palate, and nasal tones, in the execution of four-part songs by this or  that famous composer, which are far from beautiful, and which serve only  to ruin the voice. Who was the lady who sang the solo in yonder singing  academy? That girl, a year ago, had a fresh, beautiful, sonorous voice;  but, although she is only twenty years old, it already begins to fail  her, and she screws and forces it, by the help of the chest-tones, up to  the two-lined _a_, without any thing having ever been done for the  adjustment of the voice-registers and for the use of the head-tones, and  without proper direction from a competent superintendent. Instead of  this, he was continually exclaiming: \"Loud! forcibly! _con  espressione!_\"    While even the street boys in Italy sing clearly, and often with great  ability, their national songs, so well suited to the voice, and in their  most beautiful language, our northern voices, which are obliged to  contend with the great difficulties of the German language, are  sacrificed in the most cold-blooded and self-satisfied manner in the  schools and singing societies, while all artistic preparation, by which  alone the voice may be preserved and cultivated, is neglected.    Who are at the head of these institutions and societies? Musicians it is  true; but they are strangers to any special education in singing, or are  not skilful singing-teachers, who understand how to combine methodical  cultivation of the voice with practical execution. Their entire  instruction consists, at most, in hitting the notes and keeping time.  These musicians say: \"Whoever joins my society must know how to sing!\"  What does that mean? Where are they to learn it? And, even when you have  succeeded in obtaining for your academy a few imprudent but well-taught  singers, does not the preservation of their voices then require the  greatest care and watchfulness? Is that in your power? Have you the  requisite knowledge for it? Are not these few well-educated voices  obliged to sing by the side of singers who have been taught in a wrong  manner, and who have no pure, correct intonation? Then what do these  societies amount to? Do they improve or destroy the voice? They make the  members musical. A fine consolation for the loss of the voice! They  teach them to hit the notes and to keep time. A great comfort after the  voice has been destroyed by false culture!           *       *       *       *       *    A singing-teacher who has no firm, decided principle, who is constantly  wavering backwards and forwards, and who frequently leads others into  error by his untenable opinions; who cannot quickly discern the special  talent and capacity of his pupils, or discover the proper means to get  rid of what is false or wrong, and adopt the speediest road to success,  without any one-sided theories of perfection; who mistrusts and blames,  worries, offends, and depresses, instead of encouraging; who is always  dissatisfied instead of cordially acknowledging what is good in the  pupil; who at one time rides a high horse instead of kindly offering a  helping hand, and at another time praises as extravagantly as he before  has blamed, and kills time in such ways as these,--he may be an  encyclopaedia of knowledge, but his success will always fall short of his  hopes. Firmness, decision, energy, and a delicate, quick perception; the  art not to say too much or too little, and to be quite clear in his own  mind, and with constant considerate kindness to increase the courage and  confidence of his pupils,--these are requisite above all things for a  singing-master as well as for a piano-teacher.           *       *       *       *       *    \"My singers are to be educated for the public, for the stage, and must  therefore sing loud, study hard, force their execution, and make use of  a great deal of breath. How else will they be able to produce an  effect?\"    _Answer._ What, then, is the effect of your culture? I know of none,  except that they at first are applauded, because they are young and  pretty, and are novelties; because they have good voices, and the  benevolent public wishes to encourage them; and then they disappear in a  year or two without leaving any trace.    \"The singing-teacher can succeed in cultivating not more than one good  voice in twenty, with any noteworthy result. Hence the decadence of the  art of singing.\"    _Answer._ Unless some unusual disturbance or sickness occur, all voices  improve till the twenty-fourth year. When this is not the case, it is to  be attributed only to the singing-teacher.    \"Many voices acquire a sharp tone, which is the precursor of decay.\"    _Answer._ All voices are, and will remain, more or less tender, if their  culture is correct.    \"Only Jenny Lind and Henrietta Sontag were allowed by the public to give  out their voices naturally and lightly without straining them, and to  sing _piano_ and _pianissimo_, and their celebrity is a justification of  this privilege.\"    _Answer._ But how would they have obtained their celebrity, if this were  not the true, correct, and pure mode of singing?    \"Our singers also try the _piano_ and _pianissimo_; but they can  produce no effect on their audiences by it, as you may see every day.\"    _Answer._ Good heavens! I should think so! With such a _piano_, with  strained voices, faulty attack, and the use of too much breath,--a  _piano_ which only gurgles in the throat, or deeper! That I do not mean:  I must refer you again to the three trifles mentioned in my eighth  chapter.    \"But some voices have no _piano_, and many singers do not take the right  course to acquire it.\"    _Answer._ What a wide-spread, groundless excuse! Here we may see the  error of our times. People look for the fault outside of themselves, and  not in themselves. The inventive power of the age is here truly  astonishing! When, owing to false management, the voice soon degenerates  instead of improving with time, it is the consequence of a faulty  formation of the throat, and of the neglect of London throat brushes! If  such badly educated voices can no longer produce a _piano_, it is owing  to the unskilfulness of nature, and to the false construction of the  necessary organs! If the _piano_ is only a wheeze, the reason is found  in the deficiency of palate, and excess of muscles! If several times in  the month, the worn out, weary voice can only groan and sigh, or cannot  emit a sound, it is the result of a change in the weather, or other  meteorological conditions! If we complain of unpleasant, shrieking  tones, occasioned by the mouth being too widely stretched, then \"the  rays of sound take an oblique, instead of a direct course\"! If the poor,  strained medium voice, even with the help of a great deal of breath, can  only produce dull, hollow, veiled, and unpleasant tones, that is said to  be a necessary crisis, of which cruel Nature requires a great many in  the course of her development of the voice! Finally, if from long and  forced holding of the chest-tones, they are changed into noises like the  bellowing of calves and the quacking of ducks, and the instructor  finally perceives it, then again we have a crisis! And, alas! no one  thinks of \"the three trifles.\"           *       *       *       *       *    What occasions the want of success of our singing-teachers, many of whom  are musical, possess a delicate ear, fine culture and feeling, have  studied systems of singing, and exert themselves zealously to teach  rightly?    They fail in the culture of the tone, which is not to be learned from  books or by one's self, but only from verbal communication. To learn to  produce a clear tone, with a light, free, natural attack; to understand  how to draw forth the sound with the use of no unnecessary breath, and  to cause the sound to strike against the roof of the mouth above the  upper row of teeth; to improve the pronunciation; to adjust the  registers,--these, with many other things, may seem very easy; but to  teach them all in the shortest time, without wearing out the voice and  without falling into errors; to persevere in teaching to the end, even  if the pupil already sings correctly; to know what is still wanting and  how it is to be attained,--all these one must acquire by long and  constant experience.    When Schroeder-Devrient came from Vienna to Dresden, a young but already  celebrated singer, though at that time wanting in the proper foundation  for singing, she was not a little surprised when Miksch called her  attention to this deficiency. She devoted herself thoroughly to the  primary formation of the tone under the instruction of Miksch, and must  still remember the old master, and his extraordinary practice in this  particular. Miksch learned it from Caselli, a pupil of Bernacchi. He had  just sung as a young tenor, with great applause, in a concert, and  introduced himself to Caselli, who was present, expecting to receive  his approbation; but the latter, instead of commending, assured him  frankly that his mode of singing was false, and that with such misuse  his voice would succumb within a year, unless he adopted a correct  culture of tone. After much hard struggle, the young Miksch renounced  all further public applause, and studied the formation of tone  assiduously and perseveringly with"]]]
