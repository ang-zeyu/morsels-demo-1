There have been times when I stood in this spot and said what  I really thought, and I pray God that those days of indulgence may be  accorded me again. But I have come here today, of course, somewhat  restrained by a sense of responsibility that I cannot escape.    For I take The Associated Press very seriously. I know the enormous part  that you play in the affairs not only of this country, but the world.  You deal in the raw material of opinion and, if my convictions have any  validity, opinion ultimately governs the world.    It is, therefore, of very serious things that I think as I face this  body of men. I do not think of you, however, as members of The  Associated Press. I do not think of you as men of different parties or  of different racial derivations or of different religious denominations,  I want to talk to you as to my fellow-citizens of the United States. For  there are serious things which as fellow-citizens we ought to consider.    The times behind us, gentlemen, have been difficult enough, the times  before us are likely to be more difficult because, whatever may be said  about the present condition of the world's affairs, it is clear that  they are drawing rapidly to a climax, and at the climax the test will  come, not only of the nations engaged in the present colossal struggle,  it will come for them of course, but the test will come to us  particularly.    Do you realize that, roughly speaking, we are the only great nation at  present disengaged? I am not speaking, of course, with disparagement of  the greater of those nations in Europe which are not parties to the  present war, but I am thinking of their close neighborhood to it. I am  thinking how their lives much more than ours touch the very heart and  stuff of the business; whereas, we have rolling between us and those  bitter days across the water three thousand miles of cool and silent  ocean.    Our atmosphere is not yet charged with those disturbing elements which  must be felt and must permeate every nation of Europe. Therefore, is it  not likely that the nations of the world will some day turn to us for  the cooler assessment of the elements engaged?    I am not now thinking so preposterous a thought as that we should sit in  judgment upon them. No nation is fit to sit in judgment upon any other  nation, but that we shall some day have to assist in reconstructing the  processes of peace. Our resources are untouched; we are more and more  becoming by the force of circumstances the mediating nation of the world  in respect to its finances. We must make up our minds what are the best  things to do and what are the best ways to do them.    We must put our money, our energy, our enthusiasm, our sympathy into  these things; and we must have our judgments prepared and our spirits  chastened against the coming of that day. So that I am not speaking in a  selfish spirit when I say that our whole duty for the present, at any  rate, is summed up in this motto, \"America first.\" Let us think of  America before we think of Europe, in order that America may be fit to  be Europe's friend when the day of tested friendship comes. The test of  friendship is not now sympathy with the one side or the other, but  getting ready to help both sides when the struggle is over.    The basis of neutrality, gentlemen, is not indifference; it is not  self-interest. The basis of neutrality is sympathy for mankind. It is  fairness, it is good-will at bottom. It is impartiality of spirit and of  judgment. I wish that all of our fellow-citizens could realize that.    There is in some quarters a disposition to create distempers in this  body politic. Men are even uttering slanders against the United States  as if to excite her. Men are saying that if we should go to war upon  either side there will be a divided America--an abominable libel of  ignorance. America is not all of it vocal just now. It is vocal in  spots.    But I for one have a complete and abiding faith in that great silent  body of Americans who are not standing up and shouting and expressing  their opinions just now, but are waiting to find out and support the  duty of America. I am just as sure of their solidity and of their  loyalty and of their unanimity, if we act justly, as I am that the  history of this country has at every crisis and turning point  illustrated this great lesson.    We are the mediating nation of the world. I do not mean that we  undertake not to mind our own business and to mediate where other people  are quarreling. I mean the word in a broader sense. We are compounded of  the nations of the world. We mediate their blood, we mediate their  traditions, we mediate their sentiments, their tastes, their passions;  we are ourselves compounded of those things.    We are, therefore, able to understand all nations; we are able to  understand them in the compound, not separately, as partisans, but  unitedly, as knowing and comprehending and embodying them all. It is in  that sense that I mean that America is a mediating nation. The opinion  of America, the action of America, is ready to turn and free to turn in  any direction.    Did you ever reflect upon how almost all other nations, almost every  other nation has through long centuries been headed in one direction?  That is not true of the United States. The United States has no racial  momentum. It has no history back of it which makes it run all its  energies and all its ambitions in one particular direction; and America  is particularly free in this, that she has no hampering ambitions as a  world power.    If we have been obliged by circumstances or have considered ourselves to  be obliged by circumstances, in the past to take territory which we  otherwise would not have thought of taking, I believe I am right in  saying that we have considered it our duty to administer that territory,  not for ourselves, but for the people living in it, and to put this  burden upon our consciences not to think that this thing is ours for our  use, but to regard ourselves as trustees of the great business for those  to whom it does really belong, trustees ready to hand over the cosmic  trust at any time when the business seems to make that possible and  feasible. That is what I mean by saying we have no hampering ambitions.    We do not want anything that does not belong to us. Isn't a nation in  that position free to serve other nations, and isn't a nation like that  ready to form some part of the assessing opinion of the world?    My interest in the neutrality of the United States is not the petty  desire to keep out of trouble. To judge by my experience I have never  been able to keep out of trouble. I have never looked for it, but I have  always found it. I do not want to walk around trouble. If any man wants  a scrap--that is, an interesting scrap and worth while--I am his man. I  warn him that he is not going to draw me into the scrap for his  advertisement, but if he is looking for trouble--that is, the trouble of  men in general--and I can help a little, why, then, I am in for it. But  I am interested in neutrality because there is something so much  greater to do than fight, because there is something, there is a  distinction waiting for this nation that no nation has ever yet got.  That is the distinction of absolute self-control and self-mastery.    Whom do you admire most among your friends? The irritable man? The man  out of whom you can get a \"rise\" without trying? The man who will fight  at the drop of the hat, whether he knows what the hat is dropped for or  not?    Don't you admire and don't you fear, if you have to contest with him,  the self-mastered man who watches you with calm eye and comes in only  when you have carried the thing so far that you must be disposed of?  That is the man you respect. That is the man who you know has at bottom  a much more fundamental and terrible courage than the irritable,  fighting man.    Now, I covet for America this splendid courage of reserve moral force,  and I wanted to point out to you gentlemen simply this: There is news  and news. There is what is called news from Turtle Bay, that turns out  to be falsehood, at any rate in what it is said to signify, and which if  you could get the nation to believe it true might disturb our  equilibrium and our self-possession. We ought not to deal in stuff of  that kind. We ought not to permit things of that sort to use up the  electrical energy of the wires, because its energy is malign, its energy  is not of the truth, its energy is of mischief.    It is possible to sift truth. I have known some things to go out on the  wires as true when there was only one man or one group of men who could  have told the originators of the report whether it was true or not, and  they were not asked whether it was true or not for fear it might not be  true. That sort of report ought not to go out over the wires.    There is generally, if not always, somebody who knows whether that thing  is so or not, and in these days above all other days we ought to take  particular pains to resort to the one small group of men or to the one  man, if there be but one, who knows whether those things are true or  not.    The world ought to know the truth, but the world ought not at this  period of unstable equilibrium to be disturbed by rumor, ought not to be  disturbed by imaginative combinations of circumstances or, rather, by  circumstances stated in combination which do not belong in combination.  For we are holding--not I, but you and gentlemen engaged like you--the  balances in your hand. This unstable equilibrium rests upon scales that  are in your hands. For the food of opinion, as I began by saying, is the  news of the day. I have known many a man go off at a tangent on  information that was not reliable.

'And what did your father think?'    'He was so satisfied that she had been the wife of his eldest son in  a former birth, that he defrayed all the expenses of her funeral  ceremonies, and had them all observed with as much magnificence as  those of any member of the family. Her tomb is still to be seen at  Khitoli, and that of my brother at Sihora.'    I went to look at these tombs with Bholi Sukul himself some short  time after this conversation, and found that all the people of the  town of Sihora and village of Khitoli really believed that the old  Lodhi woman had been his brother's wife in a former birth, and had  now burned herself as his widow for the fourth time. Her tomb is at  Khitoli, and his at Sihora.      Notes:    1. _Sati_, a virtuous woman, especially one who burns herself with  her husband. The word, in common usage, is transferred to the  sacrifice of the woman.    2. The women of Bundelkhand wear the same costume, a full loin-cloth,  as those of the Jubbulpore district. North of the Jumna an ordinary  petticoat is generally worn.    3. Suttee was prohibited during the administration of Lord William  Bentinck by the Bengal Regulation xvii, dated 4th December, 1829,  extended in 1830 to Madras and Bombay. The advocates of the practice  unsuccessfully appealed to the Privy Council. Several European  officers defended the custom. A well-written account of the suttee  legislation is given in Mr. D. Boulger's work on Lord William  Bentinck in the 'Rulers of India' series.    4. Whenever it is practicable, Hindoos are placed on the banks of  sacred rivers to die, especially in Bengal.    5. For explanation of this phrase, see the following story of the  Lodhi woman, following note [14], in this chapter. The name is  abnormal. _Upadhya_ is a Brahman title meaning 'spiritual preceptor'.  Brahmans serving in the army sometimes take the title Singh, which is  more properly assumed by Rajputs or Sikhs.    6. An instance of such a prophecy, of a favourable kind, will be  found at the end of this chapter; and another, disastrously  fulfilled, in Chapter 21, _post_.    7. Riwa (Rewah) is a considerable principality lying south of  Allahabad and Mirzapore and north of Sagar. The chiefs are Baghel  Rajputs. The proper title of the Udaipur, or Mewar, chief is Rana,  not Raja. See 'Annals of Mewar', chapters 1-18, pp. 173-401, in the  Popular Edition of Tod's _Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan_  (Routledge, 1914), an excellent and cheap reprint. The original  quarto edition is almost unobtainable.    8. The masculine form of the word sati (suttee).    9. Well known to tourists as the seat of the Maharaja of Benares.    10. 'of' in text.    11. In the author's time no regular census had been taken. His rough  estimate was excessive. The census figures, including the  cantonments, are: 1872, 175,188; 1901, 209,331; 1911, 203,804.    12. This Benares story, accidentally omitted from the author's text,  was printed as a note at the end of the second volume. It has now  been inserted in the place which seems most suitable. Interesting and  well-told narratives of several suttees will be found in Bernier,  _Travels in the Mogul Empire_, pp. 306-14, ed. Constable. See also  Dubois, _Hindu Manners_, &c., 3rd ed. (1906), chapter 19.    13. Widows are not always so well treated. Their life in Lower  Bengal, especially, is not a pleasant one,    14. Sihora, on the road from Jubbulpore to Mirzapur, twenty-seven  miles from the former, is a town with a population of more than  5,000. A smaller town with the same name exists in the Bhandara  district of the Central Provinces.    15. The monkey-god. His shrines are very numerous in the Central  Provinces and Bundelkhand.    16. Within the last hundred years more than one officer has believed  that infanticide had been suppressed by his efforts, and yet the  practice is by no means extinct. In the Agra Province the severely  inquisitorial measures adopted in 1870, and rigorously enforced, have  no doubt done much to break the custom, but, in the neighbouring  province of Oudh, the practice continued to be common for many years  later. A clear case in the Rai Bareli District came before me in  1889, though no one was punished, for lack of judicial proof against  any individual. The author discusses infanticide as practised in Oudh  in many passages of his _Journey through the Kingdom of Oudh_  (Bentley, 1858), It is possible that female infanticide may be still  prevalent in many Native States. Mr. Willoughby in the years  preceding A.D. 1849 made great progress in stamping it out among the  Jharejas of the Kathiawar States in the Bombay Presidency. There is  reason to hope that the crime will gradually disappear from all parts  of India, but it is difficult to say how far it still prevails,  though the general opinion is that it is now comparatively rare  (_Census Report, India_, 1911, p. 217).    17. A college of more pretensions now exists at Jabalpur  (Jubbulpore), and is affiliated in Arts and Law to the University of  Allahabad established in 1887. The small college alluded to in the  text was abolished in 1850.    18. For description of the tedious and complicated 'sraddh'  ceremonies see chapter 11 of Monier Williams's _Religious Thought and  Life in India_.    19. This version of the story differs in some minute particulars from  the version given _ante_, [14].          CHAPTER 5      Marriages of Trees--The Tank and the Plantain--Meteors--Rainbows.    Before quitting Jubbulpore, to which place I thought it very unlikely  that I should ever return, I went to visit the groves in the  vicinity, which, at the time I held the civil charge of the district  in 1828, had been planted by different native gentlemen upon lands  assigned to them rent-free for the purpose, on condition that the  holder should bind himself to plant trees at the rate of twenty-five  to the acre, and keep them up at that rate; and that for each grove,  however small, he should build and keep in repair a well, lined with  masonry, for watering the trees, and for the benefit of  travellers.[1]      Some of these groves had already begun to yield fruit, and all had  been _married_. Among the Hindoos, neither the man who plants a  grove, nor his wife, can taste of the fruit till he has _married_ one  of the mango-trees to some other tree (commonly the tamarind-tree)  that grows near it in the same grove. The proprietor of one of these  groves that stands between the cantonment and the town, old Barjor  Singh, had spent so much in planting and watering the grove, and  building walls and wells of _pucka_[2] masonry, that he could not  afford to defray the expense of the marriage ceremonies till one of  the trees, which was older than the rest when planted, began to bear  fruit in 1833, and poor old Barjor Singh and his wife were in great  distress that they dared not taste of the fruit whose flavour was so  much prized by their children. They began to think that they had  neglected a serious duty, and might, in consequence, be taken off  before another season could come round. They therefore sold all their  silver and gold ornaments, and borrowed all they could; and before  the next season the grove was married with all due pomp and ceremony,  to the great delight of the old pair, who tasted of the fruit in June  1834.    The larger the number of the Brahmans that are fed on the occasion of  the marriage, the greater the glory of the proprietor of the grove;  and when I asked old Barjor Singh, during my visit to his grove, how  many he had feasted, he said, with a heavy sigh, that he had been  able to feast only one hundred and fifty. He showed me the mango-tree  which had acted the part of the bridegroom on the occasion, but the  bride had disappeared from his side. 'And where is the bride, the  tamarind?' 'The only tamarind I had in the grove died', said the old  man, 'before we could bring about the wedding; and I was obliged to  get a jasmine for a wife for my mango. I planted it here, so that we  might, as required, cover both bride and bridegroom under one canopy  during the ceremonies; but, after the marriage was over, the gardener  neglected her, and she pined away and died.'    'And what made you prefer the jasmine to all other trees after the  tamarind?'    'Because it is the most celebrated of all trees, save the rose.'    'And why not have chosen the rose for a wife?'    'Because no one ever heard of marriage between the rose and the  mango; while they [_sic_] take place every day between the mango and  the _chambeli_ (jasmine).'[3]    After returning from the groves, I had a visit after breakfast from a  learned Muhammadan, now guardian to the young Raja of Uchahara,[4]  who resides part of his time at Jubbulpore. I mentioned my visit to  the groves and the curious notion of the Hindoos regarding the  necessity of marrying them; and he told me that, among Hindoos, the  man who went to the expense of making a tank dared not drink of its  waters till he had married his tank to some banana-tree, planted on  the bank for the purpose.[5]    'But what', said he with a smile, 'could you expect from men who  believe that Indra is the god who rules the heavens immediately over  the earth, that he sleeps during eight months in the year, and during  the other four his time is divided between his duties of sending down  rain upon the earth, and repelling with his arrows Raja Bali, who by  his austere devotions (_tapasya_) has received from the higher gods a  promise of the reversion of his dominions? The lightning which we  see', said the learned Maulavi, 'they believe to be nothing more than  the glittering of these arrows, as they are shot from the bow of  Indra upon his foe Raja Bali '.[6]    'But, my good friend Maulavi Sahib, there are many good Muhammadans  who believe that the meteors, which we call shooting stars,"]]]
