Hospitality is to him a law,  and the guest is always treated with honour; it is pleasant also to  see the respect with which the Bedawin regard their women, and the  harmony which exists between the members or a tribe. Their government  is patriarchal, each tribe being ruled by its sheykh, the \"father of  his children,\" who administers their code of honour or justice, and  whose decision is always implicitly obeyed. Here, again, we have  another Biblical parallel, for, like his brother Mohammedan in Egypt,  the life of the desert Arab, no less than the dwellers on the \"black  soil,\" still preserves many of those poetical customs and  characteristics which render the history of Abraham so attractive, and  although these pages have only been able to give a partial picture of  Egypt and its people, perhaps enough has been said to induce my  readers to learn more about them, as well as to enable them a little  more fully to realize how very real, and how very human, are the  romantic stories of the Old Testament.

Ch'ang, feeling  hungry, had slipped into the house at daybreak to see if any scraps had  been left from the last evening's meal. The bedroom door had blown open  in the night, and there lay a young man sound asleep, instead of the  greybeard whom the gander called his master. Then, before his very eyes,  the youth changed suddenly into his former shape and was an old man  again.    In his excitement, forgetting all about his empty stomach, the  terror-stricken goose rushed out into the yard to think over the  mystery, but the longer he puzzled, the more strange it all seemed. Then  he thought of Hu-lin, and wished that she would come by, that he might  ask her opinion. He had a high regard for the slave girl's knowledge and  believed that she would understand fully what had taken place.    Ch'ang went to the gate. As usual, it was locked, and there was nothing  for him to do but wait for his master to rise. Two hours later the miser  walked out into the yard. He seemed in good spirits, and he gave Ch'ang  more to eat than usual. After taking his morning smoke on the street in  front of the house, he strolled around it leaving the front gate ajar.    This was precisely what the gander had been expecting. Slipping quietly  into the road, he turned towards the river where he could see the  houseboats lined up at the wharf. On the sand near by lay a well-known  form.    \"Hu-lin,\" he called as he drew near, \"wake up, for I have something to  tell you.\"    \"I am not asleep,\" she answered, turning her tear-stained face towards  her friend.    \"Why, what's the matter? You've been crying again. Has old Black Heart  been beating you?\"    \"Hush! he's taking a nap in the boat. Don't let him hear you.\"    \"It's not likely he would understand goose-talk if he did,\" replied  Ch'ang, smiling. \"However, I suppose it's always best to be on the safe  side, so I'll whisper what I have to say.\"    Putting his bill close to her ear, he told Hu-lin of his recent  discovery, and ended by asking her to tell him what it all meant.    The child forgot her own misery at hearing his wonderful story. \"Are you  quite sure there was not some friend of the miser's spending the night  with him?\" she asked gravely.    \"Yes, yes, perfectly sure, for he has no friends,\" replied the gander.  \"Besides, I was in the house just before he locked up for the night, and  I saw neither hair nor hide of any other person.\"    \"Then he must be a fairy in disguise!\" announced Hu-lin wisely.    \"A fairy! what's that?\" questioned Ch'ang, more and more excited.    \"Why, you old goose, don't you know what a fairy is?\" And Hu-lin laughed  outright. By this time she had forgotten her own troubles and was  becoming more and more amused at what she had heard. \"Hark!\" she said in  a low tone, and speaking very slowly, \"a fairy is----\" Here she lowered  her voice to a whisper.    The gander nodded violently as she went on with her explanation, and  when she had finished, was speechless with amazement, for a few moments.  \"Well,\" he said finally, \"if my master is that kind of man, suppose you  slip away quietly and come with me, for, if a fairy is what you say he  is, he can save you from all your troubles and make me happy for the  rest of my days.\"    [Illustration: \"PUTTING HIS BILL TO HER EAR, HE TOLD HU-LIN OF HIS  RECENT DISCOVERY.\"]    \"I wonder if I dare?\" she answered, looking round fearfully towards the  houseboat, from the open scuttle of which came the sound of deep  snoring.    \"Yes, yes, of course!\" coaxed Ch'ang. \"He gave you such a beating that  he won't be afraid of your taking to your heels again very soon.\"    Hurriedly they went to the miser's compound. Hu-lin's heart was beating  fast as she tried to decide what to say when she should actually stand  before the fairy. The gate was still partly open and the two friends  entered boldly.    \"Come this way,\" said Ch'ang. \"He must be in the back-yard digging in  his garden.\"    But when they reached the vegetable patch there was no one to be seen.    \"This is very strange,\" whispered the gander. \"I don't understand it,  for I have never known him to grow tired of work so early. Surely he  cannot have gone in to rest.\"    Led by her friend, Hu-lin entered the house on tiptoe. The door of the  miser's bedroom stood wide open, and they saw that there was no one  either in that room or any other room of the miserable cottage.    \"Come! let's see what kind of bed he sleeps on,\" said Hu-lin, filled  with curiosity. \"I have never been in a fairy's room. It must be  different from other people's rooms.\"    \"No, no! just a plain brick bed, like all the rest,\" answered Ch'ang, as  they crossed the threshold.    \"Does he have a fire in cold weather?\" asked Hu-lin, stooping to examine  the small fire hole in the bricks.    \"Oh, yes, a hot fire every night, and even in spring when other people  have stopped having fires, the brick bed is hot every night.\"    \"Well, that's rather strange for a miser, don't you think?\" said the  girl. \"It costs more to keep a fire going than it does to feed a man.\"    \"Yes, that's true,\" agreed Ch'ang, pruning his feathers. \"I hadn't  thought of that. It is strange, very. Hu-lin, you're a wise child. Where  did you learn so much?\"    At that moment the gander turned pale at hearing the gate slam loudly  and the bar thrown into place.    \"Good gracious! what ever shall we do?\" asked Hu-lin. \"What will he say  if he finds us here?\"    \"No telling,\" said the other, trembling, \"but, my dear little friend, we  are certainly caught, for we can't get away without his seeing us.\"    \"Yes, and I've already had one beating to-day! And such a hard one that  I don't believe I could live through another,\" sighed the child, as the  tears began to flow.    \"There, there, little girl, don't worry! Let's hide in this dark corner  behind the baskets,\" suggested the gander, just as the master's step was  heard at the front door.    Soon the frightened companions were crouching on the ground, trying  to hide. Much to their relief, however, the miser did not go into his  bedroom, and they soon heard him hard at work in the garden. All that  day the two remained in their hiding place, afraid to show themselves  outside the door.    \"I can't imagine what he would say if he found out that his watch-goose  had brought a stranger into the house,\" said Ch'ang.    \"Perhaps he would think we were trying to steal some of the money he  has hidden away,\" she answered, laughing, for as Hu-lin became used  to her cramped quarters she grew less frightened. At any rate she  was not nearly so much afraid of the miser as she had thought she was.  \"Besides,\" she reflected, \"he can't be so bad as old Black Heart.\"    Thus the day wore on and darkness fell over the land. By this time girl  and goose were fast asleep in one corner of the miser's room and knew  nothing more of what was happening.    When the first light of a new day filtered through the paper-covered  window above the miser's bed, Hu-lin awoke with a start, and at first  she could not think where she was. Ch'ang was staring at her with  wide-open frightened eyes that seemed to be asking, \"What can it all  mean? It is more than my goose brain can think out.\"    For on the bed, instead of the miser, there lay a young man whose hair  was a black as a raven's wing. A faint smile lightened up his handsome  face, as if he was enjoying some delightful dream. A cry of wonder  escaped Hu-lin's lips before she could hold it back. The sleeper's eyes  opened instantly and were fixed upon her. The girl was so frightened  that she could not move, and the gander trembled violently as he saw the  change that had come over his master.    The young man was even more surprised than his guests, and for two  minutes he was speechless. \"What does this mean?\" he asked, finally,  looking at Ch'ang. \"What are you doing in my bedroom and who is this  child who seems so frightened?\"    \"Forgive me, kind sir, but what have you done to my master?\" asked the  gander, giving question for question.    \"Am I not your master, you mad creature?\" said the man, laughing. \"You  are more stupid than ever this morning.\"    \"My master was old and ugly, but you are still young and handsome,\"  replied Ch'ang in a tone of flattery.    \"What,\" shouted the other, \"you say I am still young?\"    \"Why, yes. Ask Hu-lin, if you don't believe me.\"    The man turned towards the little girl.    \"Yes, indeed you are, sir,\" she replied in answer to his look. \"Never  have I seen a man so beautiful.\"    \"At last! at last!\" he cried, laughing joyfully, \"I am free, free, free  from all my troubles, but how it has come about is more than I can say!\"    For a few minutes he stood in a deep study, snapping his long fingers  as if trying to solve some hard problem. At last a smile lighted up his  face. \"Ch'ang,\" he asked, \"what was it you called your guest when you  spoke of her a minute ago?\"    \"I am Hu-lin,\" said the child simply, \"Hu-lin, the slave girl.\"    He clapped his hands. \"That's right! That's right!\" he cried. \"I see it  all now; it is as plain as day.\" Then, noticing the look of wonder on  her face, \"It is to you that I owe my freedom from a wicked fairy, and  if you like, I'll tell you the story of my misfortune.\"    \"Pray do, kind sir,\" she replied eagerly. \"I told Ch'ang that you were  a fairy, and I should like to know if I was right.\"    \"Well, you see,\" he began, \"my father is a rich man who lives in a  distant county. When I was a boy he gave me everything I wished. I was  so humoured and petted from earliest childhood that at last I began to  think there was nothing at all in the world I could not have for the  asking, and nothing that I must not do if I wished to.    \"My teacher often scolded me for having such notions. He told me there  was a proverb: 'Men die for gain, birds perish to get food.' He thought  such men were very"]]]
