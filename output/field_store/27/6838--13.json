Know thou that when the Son of Man yielded up His breath to God, the whole  creation wept with a great weeping. By sacrificing Himself, however, a  fresh capacity was infused into all created things. Its evidences, as  witnessed in all the peoples of the earth, are now manifest before thee.  The deepest wisdom which the sages have uttered, the profoundest learning  which any mind hath unfolded, the arts which the ablest hands have  produced, the influence exerted by the most potent of rulers, are but  manifestations of the quickening power released by His transcendent, His  all-pervasive, and resplendent Spirit.    We testify that when He came into the world, He shed the splendor of His  glory upon all created things. Through Him the leper recovered from the  leprosy of perversity and ignorance. Through Him, the unchaste and wayward  were healed. Through His power, born of Almighty God, the eyes of the  blind were opened, and the soul of the sinner sanctified.    Leprosy may be interpreted as any veil that interveneth between man and  the recognition of the Lord, his God. Whoso alloweth himself to be shut  out from Him is indeed a leper, who shall not be remembered in the Kingdom  of God, the Mighty, the All-Praised. We bear witness that through the  power of the Word of God every leper was cleansed, every sickness was  healed, every human infirmity was banished. He it is Who purified the  world. Blessed is the man who, with a face beaming with light, hath turned  towards Him.            XXXVII: BLESSED IS THE MAN THAT HATH ACKNOWLEDGED...      Blessed is the man that hath acknowledged his belief in God and in His  signs, and recognized that \"He shall not be asked of His doings.\" Such a  recognition hath been made by God the ornament of every belief, and its  very foundation. Upon it must depend the acceptance of every goodly deed.  Fasten your eyes upon it, that haply the whisperings of the rebellious may  not cause you to slip.    Were He to decree as lawful the thing which from time immemorial had been  forbidden, and forbid that which had, at all times, been regarded as  lawful, to none is given the right to question His authority. Whoso will  hesitate, though it be for less than a moment, should be regarded as a  transgressor.    Whoso hath not recognized this sublime and fundamental verity, and hath  failed to attain this most exalted station, the winds of doubt will  agitate him, and the sayings of the infidels will distract his soul. He  that hath acknowledged this principle will be endowed with the most  perfect constancy. All honor to this all-glorious station, the remembrance  of which adorneth every exalted Tablet. Such is the teaching which God  bestoweth on you, a teaching that will deliver you from all manner of  doubt and perplexity, and enable you to attain unto salvation in both this  world and in the next. He, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most  Bountiful.            XXXVIII: KNOW OF A CERTAINTY THAT IN EVERY DISPENSATION...      Know of a certainty that in every Dispensation the light of Divine  Revelation hath been vouchsafed unto men in direct proportion to their  spiritual capacity. Consider the sun. How feeble its rays the moment it  appeareth above the horizon. How gradually its warmth and potency increase  as it approacheth its zenith, enabling meanwhile all created things to  adapt themselves to the growing intensity of its light. How steadily it  declineth until it reacheth its setting point. Were it, all of a sudden,  to manifest the energies latent within it, it would, no doubt, cause  injury to all created things.... In like manner, if the Sun of Truth were  suddenly to reveal, at the earliest stages of its manifestation, the full  measure of the potencies which the providence of the Almighty hath  bestowed upon it, the earth of human understanding would waste away and be  consumed; for men's hearts would neither sustain the intensity of its  revelation, nor be able to mirror forth the radiance of its light.  Dismayed and overpowered, they would cease to exist.            XXXIX: PRAISE BE TO THEE, O LORD MY GOD, FOR THE...      Praise be to Thee, O Lord My God, for the wondrous revelations of Thy  inscrutable decree and the manifold woes and trials Thou hast destined for  Myself. At one time Thou didst deliver Me into the hands of Nimrod; at  another Thou hast allowed Pharaoh's rod to persecute Me. Thou, alone,  canst estimate, through Thine all-encompassing knowledge and the operation  of Thy Will, the incalculable afflictions I have suffered at their hands.  Again Thou didst cast Me into the prison-cell of the ungodly, for no  reason except that I was moved to whisper into the ears of the  well-favored denizens of Thy Kingdom an intimation of the vision with  which Thou hadst, through Thy knowledge, inspired Me, and revealed to Me  its meaning through the potency of Thy might. And again Thou didst decree  that I be beheaded by the sword of the infidel. Again I was crucified for  having unveiled to men's eyes the hidden gems of Thy glorious unity, for  having revealed to them the wondrous signs of Thy sovereign and  everlasting power. How bitter the humiliations heaped upon Me, in a  subsequent age, on the plain of Karbila! How lonely did I feel amidst Thy  people! To what a state of helplessness I was reduced in that land!  Unsatisfied with such indignities, My persecutors decapitated Me, and,  carrying aloft My head from land to land paraded it before the gaze of the  unbelieving multitude, and deposited it on the seats of the perverse and  faithless. In a later age, I was suspended, and My breast was made a  target to the darts of the malicious cruelty of My foes. My limbs were  riddled with bullets, and My body was torn asunder. Finally, behold how,  in this Day, My treacherous enemies have leagued themselves against Me,  and are continually plotting to instill the venom of hate and malice into  the souls of Thy servants. With all their might they are scheming to  accomplish their purpose.... Grievous as is My plight, O God, My  Well-Beloved, I render thanks unto Thee, and My Spirit is grateful for  whatsoever hath befallen me in the path of Thy good-pleasure. I am well  pleased with that which Thou didst ordain for Me, and welcome, however  calamitous, the pains and sorrows I am made to suffer.            XL: O MY WELL-BELOVED! THOU HAST BREATHED THY...      O My Well-Beloved! Thou hast breathed Thy Breath into Me, and divorced Me  from Mine own Self. Thou didst, subsequently, decree that no more than a  faint reflection, a mere emblem of Thy Reality within Me be left among the  perverse and envious. Behold, how, deluded by this emblem, they have risen  against Me, and heaped upon Me their denials! Uncover Thy Self, therefore,  O My Best-Beloved, and deliver Me from My plight.    Thereupon a Voice replied: \"I love, I dearly cherish this emblem. How can  I consent that Mine eyes, alone, gaze upon this emblem, and that no heart  except Mine heart recognize it? By My Beauty, which is the same as Thy  Beauty! My wish is to hide Thee from Mine own eyes: how much more from the  eyes of men!\"    I was preparing to make reply, when lo, the Tablet was suddenly ended,  leaving My theme unfinished, and the pearl of Mine utterance unstrung.            XLI: GOD IS MY WITNESS, O PEOPLE! I WAS ASLEEP...      God is My witness, O people! I was asleep on My couch, when lo, the Breeze  of God wafting over Me roused Me from My slumber. His quickening Spirit  revived Me, and My tongue was unloosed to voice His Call. Accuse Me not of  having transgressed against God. Behold Me, not with your eyes but with  Mine. Thus admonisheth you He Who is the Gracious, the All-Knowing. Think  ye, O people, that I hold within My grasp the control of God's ultimate  Will and Purpose? Far be it from Me to advance such claim. To this I  testify before God, the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise. Had the ultimate destiny of God's Faith been in Mine hands, I  would have never consented, even though for one moment, to manifest Myself  unto you, nor would I have allowed one word to fall from My lips. Of this  God Himself is, verily, a witness.            XLII: O SON OF JUSTICE! IN THE NIGHT SEASON THE...      O Son of Justice! In the night season the beauty of the immortal Being  hath repaired from the emerald height of fidelity unto the  Sadratu'l-Muntaha, and wept with such a weeping that the Concourse on high  and the dwellers of the realms above wailed at His lamenting. Whereupon  there was asked, Why the wailing and weeping? He made reply: As bidden I  waited expectant upon the hill of faithfulness, yet inhaled not from them  that dwell on earth the fragrance of fidelity. Then summoned to return I  beheld, and lo! certain doves of holiness were sore tried within the claws  of the dogs of earth. Thereupon the Maid of Heaven hastened forth unveiled  and resplendent from Her mystic mansion, and asked of their names, and all  were told but one. And when urged, the first letter thereof was uttered,  whereupon the dwellers of the celestial chambers rushed forth out of their  habitation of glory. And whilst the second letter was pronounced they fell  down, one and all, upon the dust. At that moment a voice was heard from  the inmost shrine: \"Thus far and no farther.\" Verily, We bear witness unto  that which they have done, and now are doing.            XLIII: O AFNAN, O THOU THAT HAST BRANCHED FROM...      O Afnan, O thou that hast branched from Mine ancient Stock! My glory and  My loving-kindness rest upon thee. How vast is the tabernacle of the Cause  of God! It hath overshadowed all the peoples and kindreds of the earth,  and will, erelong, gather together the whole of mankind beneath its  shelter. Thy day of service is now come. Countless Tablets bear the  testimony of the bounties vouchsafed unto thee.

In former times there lived in the famous city of Baghdad a miserly old  merchant named Abu Kasim. Although very rich, his clothes were mere  rags; his turban was of coarse cloth, and exceedingly dirty; but his  slippers were perfect curiosities--the soles were studded with great  nails, while the upper leathers consisted of as many different pieces as  the celebrated ship Argos. He had worn them during ten years, and the  art of the ablest cobblers in Baghdad had been exhausted in preventing a  total separation of the parts; in short, by frequent accessions of nails  and patches they had become so heavy that they passed into a proverb,  and anything ponderous was compared to Abu Kasim's slippers. Walking one  day in the great bazaar, the purchase of a large quantity of crystal was  offered to this merchant, and, thinking it a bargain, he bought it. Not  long after this, hearing that a bankrupt perfumer had nothing left to  sell but some rose-water, he took advantage of the poor man's  misfortune, and purchased it for half the value. These lucky  speculations had put him into good humour, but instead of giving an  entertainment, according to the custom of merchants when they have made  a profitable bargain, Abu Kasim deemed it more expedient to go to the  bath, which he had not frequented for some time. As he was undressing,  one of his acquaintances told him that his slippers made him the  laughing-stock of the whole city, and that he ought to provide himself  with a new pair. \"I have been thinking about it,\" he answered; \"however,  they are not so very much worn but they will serve some time longer.\"  While he was washing himself, the kazi of Baghdad came also to bathe.  Abu Kasim, coming out before the judge, took up his clothes but could  not find his slippers--a new pair being placed in their room. Our miser,  persuaded, because he wished it, that the friend who had spoken to him  about his old slippers had made him a present, without hesitation put on  these fine ones, and left the bath highly delighted. But when the kazi  had finished bathing, his servants searched in vain for his slippers;  none could be found but a wretched pair, which were at once identified  as those of Abu Kasim. The officers hastened after the supposed thief,  and, bringing him back with the theft on his feet, the kazi, after  exchanging slippers, committed him to prison. There was no escaping from  the claws of justice without money, and, as Abu Kasim was known to be  very rich, he was fined in a considerable sum.    On returning home, our merchant, in a fit of indignation, flung his  slippers into the Tigris, that ran beneath his window. Some days after  they were dragged out in a fisherman's net that came up more heavy than  usual. The nails with which the soles were thickly studded had torn the  meshes of the net, and the fisherman, exasperated against the miserly  Abu Kasim and his slippers--for they were known to everyone--determined  to throw them into his house through the window he had left open. The  slippers, thrown with great force, reached the jars of rose-water, and  smashed them in pieces, to the intense consternation of the owner.  \"Cursed slippers!\" cried he, tearing his beard, \"you shall cause me no  farther mischief!\" So saying, he took a spade and began to dig a hole in  his garden to bury them. One of his neighbours, who had long borne him  ill-will, perceiving him busied in digging the ground, ran at once to  inform the governor that Abu Kasim had discovered some hidden treasure  in his garden. Nothing more was needful to rouse the cupidity of the  commandant. In vain did our miser protest that he had found no treasure;  and that he only meant to bury his old slippers. The governor had  counted on the money, so the afflicted man could only preserve his  liberty at the expense of a large sum of money. Again heartily cursing  the slippers, in order to effectually rid himself of them, he threw them  into an aqueduct at some distance from the city, persuaded that he  should now hear no more of them. But his evil genius had not yet  sufficiently plagued him: the slippers got into the mouth of the pipe  and stopped the flow of the water. The keepers of the aqueduct made  haste to repair the damage, and, finding the obstruction was caused by  Abu Kasim's slippers, complained of this to the governor, and once more  was Abu Kasim heavily fined, but the governor considerately returned him  the slippers. He now resolved to burn them, but, finding them thoroughly  soaked with water, he exposed them to the sun upon the terrace of his  house. A neighbour's dog, perceiving the slippers, leaped from the  terrace of his master's house upon that of Abu Kasim, and, seizing one  of them in his mouth, he let it drop into the street: the fatal slipper  fell directly on the head of a woman who was passing at the time, and  the fright as well as the violence of the blow caused her to miscarry.  Her husband brought his complaint before the kazi, and Abu Kasim was  again sentenced to pay a fine proportioned to the calamity he was  supposed to have occasioned. He then took the slippers in his hand, and,  with a vehemence that made the judge laugh, said: \"Behold, my lord, the  fatal instruments of my misfortune! These cursed slippers have at length  reduced me to poverty. Vouchsafe, therefore, to publish an order that no  one may any more impute to me the disasters they may yet occasion.\" The  kazi could not refuse his request, and thus Abu Kasim learned, to his  bitter cost, the danger of wearing his slippers too long.          III    THE YOUNG MERCHANT OF BAGHDAD; OR, THE WILES OF WOMAN.      Too many Eastern stories turn upon the artful devices of women to screen  their own profligacy, but there is one, told by Arab Shah, the  celebrated historian, who died A.D. 1450, in a collection entitled  _Fakihat al-Khalifa_, or Pastimes of the Khalifs, in which a lady  exhibits great ingenuity, without any very objectionable motive. It is  to the following effect:    A young merchant in Baghdad had placed over the front of his shop,  instead of a sentence from the Kuran, as is customary, these arrogant  words: \"VERILY THERE IS NO CUNNING LIKE UNTO THAT OF MAN, SEEING IT  SURPASSES THE CUNNING OF WOMEN.\" It happened one day that a very  beautiful young lady, who had been sent by her aunt to purchase some  rich stuffs for dresses, noticed this inscription, and at once resolved  to compel the despiser of her sex to alter it. Entering the shop, she  said to him, after the usual salutations: \"You see my person; can anyone  presume to say that I am humpbacked?\" He had hardly recovered from the  astonishment caused by such a question, when the lady drew her veil a  little to one side and continued: \"Surely my neck is not as that of a  raven, or as the ebony idols of Ethiopia?\" The young merchant, between  surprise and delight, signified his assent. \"Nor is my chin double,\"  said she, still farther unveiling her face; \"nor my lips thick, like  those of a Tartar?\" Here the young merchant smiled. \"Nor are they to be  believed who say that my nose is flat and my cheeks are sunken?\" The  merchant was about to express his horror at the bare idea of such  blasphemy, when the lady wholly removed her veil and allowed her beauty  to flash upon the bewildered youth, who instantly became madly in love  with her. \"Fairest of creatures!\" he cried, \"to what accident do I owe  the view of those charms, which are hidden from the eyes of the less  fortunate of my sex?\" She replied: \"You see in me an unfortunate damsel,  and I shall explain the cause of my present conduct. My mother, who was  sister to a rich amir of Mecca, died some years ago, leaving my father  in possession of an immense fortune and myself as sole heiress. I am now  seventeen, my personal endowments are such as you behold, and a very  small portion of my mother's fortune would quite suffice to obtain for  me a good establishment in marriage. Yet such is the unfeeling avarice  of my father, that he absolutely refuses me the least trifle to settle  me in life. The only counsellor to whom I could apply for help in this  extremity was my kind nurse, and it is by her advice, as well as from  the high opinion I have ever heard expressed of your merits, that I have  been induced to throw myself upon your goodness in this extraordinary  manner.\" The emotions of the young merchant on hearing this story, may  be readily imagined. \"Cruel parent!\" he exclaimed. \"He must be a rock of  the desert, not a man, who can condemn so charming a person to perpetual  solitude, when the slightest possible sacrifice on his part might  prevent it. May I inquire his name?\" \"He is the chief kazi,\" replied the  lady, and disappeared like a vision.    The young merchant lost no time in waiting on the kazi at his court of  justice, whom he thus addressed: \"My lord, I am come to ask your  daughter in marriage, of whom I am deeply enamoured.\" Quoth the judge:  \"Sir, my daughter is unworthy of the honour you design for her. But be  pleased to accompany me to my dwelling, where we can talk over this  matter more at leisure.\" They proceeded thither accordingly, and after  partaking of refreshments, the young man repeated his request, giving a  true account of his position and prospects, and offering to settle  fifteen purses on the young lady. The kazi expressed his gratification,  but doubted whether the offer was made in all"]]]
