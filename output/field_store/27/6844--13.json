[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1702"],[0,"Little Masterpieces of Autobiography: Actors (#14)"],[1,"a ground for dissuading  any young woman in whom I might be interested from joining our  calling.  To say, as a writer once said, that it was impossible for a  girl to succeed on the stage without impaired morals, is a statement  as untrue as to say that no man can succeed as a lawyer unless he be a  rogue, a doctor unless he be a quack, a parson unless be be a  hypocrite.    To all who intend to become actors and actresses, my first word of  advice would be--Respect this calling you have chosen to pursue.  You  will often in your experience hear it, see it in print, slighted and  contemned.  There are many reasons for this.  Religious prejudice,  fostered by the traditions of a by no means obsolete Puritanism, is  one; the envy of those who, forgetting the disadvantages, the  difficulties, the uncertainty of the actor's life, see only the glare  of popular adulation, the glitter of the comparatively large salaries  paid to a few of us--such unreasoning envy as this is another; and the  want of sympathy of some writers with the art itself, who, unable to  pray with Goethe and Voltaire, remain to scoff with Jeremy Collier, is  a third.  There are causes from without that will always keep alive a  certain measure of hostility towards the player.  As long as the  public, in Hazlitt's words, feel more respect for John Kemble in a  plain coat than the Lord Chancellor on the Woolsack, so long will this  public regard for the actor provoke the resentment of those whose  achievements in art appeal less immediately, less strikingly, to their  audience.  But if they would only pause to consider, surely they might  lay to their souls the unction that the immediate reward of the actor  in his lifetime is merely nature's compensation to him for the  comparative oblivion of his achievements when he has ceased to be.  Imagine for one moment Shakespeare and Garrick contemplating at the  present moment from the heights the spectacle of their fame.  Who  would grudge the actor the few years of fervid admiration he was  privileged to enjoy, some one hundred and fifty years ago, as compared  with the centuries of living glory that have fallen to the great poet?    Sometimes you may hear your calling sneered at by those who pursue it.  There are few professions that are not similarly girded at by some of  their own members, either from disappointment or some ingrained  discontent.  When you hear such detraction, fix your thoughts not on  the paltry accidents of your art, such as the use of cosmetics and  other little infirmities of its practice, things that are obvious  marks for the cheap sneer, but look rather to what that art is capable  of in its highest forms, to what is the essence of the actor's  achievement, what he can do and has done to win the genuine admiration  and respect of those whose admiration and respect have been worth the  having.        ACTING IS A GREAT ART    You will read and hear, no doubt, in your experience, that acting is  in reality no art at all, that it is mere sedulous copying of nature,  demanding neither thought nor originality.  I will only cite in reply  a passage from a letter of the poet Coleridge to the elder Charles  Mathews, which, I venture to think, goes some way to settle the  question.  \"A great actor,\" he writes, \"comic or tragic, is not to be  a mere copy, a fac-simile, but an imitation of nature; now an  imitation differs from a copy in this, that it of necessity implies  and demands a difference, whereas a copy aims at identity and what a  marble peach on the mantelpiece, that you take up deluded and put down  with a pettish disgust, is compared with a fruit-piece of Vanhuysen's,  even such is a mere copy of nature, with a true histrionic imitation.  A good actor is Pygmalion's statue, a work of exquisite art, animated  and gifted with motion; but still art, still a species of poetry.\"  So  writes Coleridge.  Raphael, speaking  of  painting, expresses the same  thought, equally applicable to the art of acting.  \"To paint a fair  one,\" he says, \"it is necessary for me to see many fair ones; but  because there is so great a scarcity of lovely women, I am constrained  to make use of one certain ideal, which I have formed to myself in my  own fancy.\"  So the actor who has to portray Hamlet, Othello,  Macbeth--any great dramatic character--has to form an ideal of such a  character in his own fancy, in fact, to employ an exercise of  imagination similar to that of the painter who seeks to depict an  ideal man or woman; the actor certainly will not meet his types of  Hamlet and Othello in the street.    But, whilst in your hearts you should cherish a firm respect for the  calling, the art you pursue, let that respect be a silent and modest  regard; it will be all the stronger for that.  I have known actors and  actresses who were always talking about their art with a big A, their  \"art-life,\" their \"life-work,\" their careers and futures, and so on.  Keep these things to yourselves, for I have observed that eloquence  and hyper-earnestness of this kind not infrequently go with rather  disappointing achievement.  Think, act, but don't talk about it.  And,  above all, because you are actors and actresses, for that very reason  be sincere and unaffected; avoid rather than court publicity, for you  will have quite enough of it if you get on in your profession; the  successful actor is being constantly tempted to indiscretion.  Do not  yield too readily to the blandishments of the photographer, or the  enterprising editor who asks you what are the love scenes you have  most enjoyed playing on the stage, and whether an actor or actress can  be happy though married.  Be natural on the stage, and be just as  natural off it; regard the thing you have to do as work that has to be  done to the best of your power; if it be well done, it will bring its  own reward.  It may not be an immediate reward, but have faith, keep  your purpose serious, so serious as to be almost a secret; bear in  mind that ordinary people expect you, just because you are actors and  actresses, to be extraordinary, unnatural, peculiar; do your utmost at  all times and seasons to disappoint such expectations.        RELATIONS TO \"SOCIETY\"    To the successful actor society, if he desire it, offers a warm and  cordial welcome.  Its members do not, it is true, suggest that he  should marry with their daughters, but why should they?  An actor has  a very unattractive kind of life to offer to any woman who is not  herself following his profession.  What I mean is that the fact of a  man being an actor does not debar him from such gratification as he  may find in the pleasures of society.  And I believe that the effect  of such raising of the actor's status as has been witnessed in the  last fifty years has been to elevate the general tone of our calling  and bring into it men and women of education and refinement.    At the same time, remember that social enjoyments should always be a  secondary consideration to the actor, something of a luxury to be  sparingly indulged in.  An actor should never let himself be beguiled  into the belief that society, generally speaking, is seriously  interested in what he does, or that popularity in drawing-rooms  connotes success in the theatre.  It does nothing of the kind.  Always  remember that you can hope to have but few, very few friends or  admirers of any class who will pay to see you in a failure; you will  be lucky if a certain number do not ask you for free admission to see  you in a success.        THE FINAL SCHOOL IS THE AUDIENCE    It is to a public far larger, far more real and genuine than this,  that you will one day have to appeal.  It is in their presence that  you will finish your education.  The final school for the actor is his  audience; they are the necessary complement to the exercise of his  art, and it is by the impression he produces on them that he will  ultimately stand or fall; on their verdict, and on their verdict  alone, will his success or failure as an artist depend.  But, if you  have followed carefully, assiduously, the course of instruction now  open to you, when the time has arrived for you to face an audience you  will start with a very considerable handicap in your favour.  If you  have learnt to move well and to speak well, to be clear in your  enunciation and graceful in your bearing, you are bound to arrest at  once the attention of any audience, no matter where it may be, before  whom you appear.  Obvious and necessary as are these two acquirements  of graceful bearing and correct diction, they are not so generally  diffused as to cease to be remarkable.  Consequently, however modest  your beginning on the stage, however short the part you may be called  upon to play, you should find immediately the benefit of your  training.  You may have to unlearn a certain amount, or rather to  mould and shape what you have learnt to your new conditions, but if  you have been well grounded in the essential elements of an actor's  education, you will stand with an enormous advantage over such of your  competitors as have waited till they go into a theatre to learn what  can be acquired just as well, better, more thoroughly, outside it.    It has been my object to deal generally with the actor's calling, a  calling, difficult and hazardous in character, demanding much  patience, self-reliance, determination, and good temper.  This last is  not one of its least important demands on your character.  Remember  that the actor is not in one sense of the word an independent artist;  it is his misfortune that the practice of his art is absolutely  dependent on the fulfilment of elaborate external conditions.  The  painter, the musician, so long as they can find paint and canvas, ink  and paper, can work at their art, alone, independent of external  circumstances.  Not so the actor.  Before he can act, the theatre, the  play, scenery, company, these requisites, not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17024"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#14)"],[1,"name of the good and noble  Lincoln on the Lake, in gratitude to him who gave freedom to 4,000,000  of slaves. These two great men are no longer among us; but it pleases  me, here in the wilds, to place, as it were, my poor little garland of  love on their tombs. Sir Bartle Frere having accomplished the grand work  of abolishing slavery in Scindiah, Upper India, deserves the gratitude  of every lover of human kind.    \"Private friendship guided me in the selection of other names where  distinctive epithets were urgently needed. 'Paraffin' Young, one of my  teachers in chemistry, raised himself to be a merchant prince by his  science and art, and has shed pure white light in many lowly cottages,  and in some rich palaces. Leaving him and chemistry, I went away to try  and bless others. I, too, have shed light of another kind, and am fain  to believe that I have performed a small part in the grand revolution  which our Maker has been for ages carrying on, by multitudes of  conscious, and many unconscious agents, all over the world. Young's  friendship never faltered.    \"Oswell and Webb were fellow-travellers, and mighty hunters. Too much  engrossed myself with mission-work to hunt, except for the children's  larder, when going to visit distant tribes, I relished the sight of fair  stand-up fights by my friends with the large denizens of the forest, and  admired the true Nimrod class for their great courage, truthfulness, and  honour. Being a warm lover of natural history, the entire butcher tribe,  bent only on making 'a bag,' without regard to animal suffering, have  not a single kindly word from me. An Ambonda man, named Mokantju, told  Oswell and me in 1851 that the Liambai and Kafue rose as one fountain  and then separated, but after a long course came together again in the  Zambezi above Zumbo.\"    _8th October, 1870._--Mbarawa and party came yesterday from Katomba at  Mamohela. He reports that Jangeonge (?) with Moeneokela's men had been  killing people of the Metamba or forest, and four of his people were  slain. He intended fighting, hence his desire to get rid of me when I  went north: he got one and a half tusks, but little ivory, but Katomba's  party got fifty tusks; Abdullah had got two tusks, and had also been  fighting, and Katomba had sent a fighting party down to Lolinde; plunder  and murder is Ujijian trading. Mbarawa got his ivory on the Lindi, or as  he says, \"Urindi,\" which has black water, and is very large: an arrow  could not be shot across its stream, 400 or 500 yards wide, it had to be  crossed by canoes, and goes into Lualaba. It is curious that all think  it necessary to say to me, \"The Manyuema are bad, very bad;\" the Balegga  will be let alone, because they can fight, and we shall hear nothing of  their badness.    _10th October, 1870._--I came out of my hut to-day, after being confined  to it since the 22nd July, or eighty days, by irritable ulcers on the  feet. The last twenty days I suffered from fever, which reduced my  strength, taking away my voice, and purging me. My appetite was good,  but the third mouthful of any food caused nausea and vomiting--purging  took place and profuse sweating; it was choleraic, and how many Manyuema  died of it we could not ascertain. While this epidemic raged here, we  heard of cholera terribly severe on the way to the coast. I am thankful  to feel myself well.    Only one ulcer is open, the size of a split pea: malachite was the  remedy most useful, but the beginning of the rains may have helped the  cure, as it does to others; copper rubbed down is used when malachite  cannot be had. We expect Syde bin Habib soon: he will take to the river,  and I hope so shall I. The native traders reached people who had horns  of oxen, got from the left bank of the Lualaba. Katomba's people got  most ivory, namely, fifty tusks; the others only four. The Metamba or  forest is of immense extent, and there is room for much ivory to be  picked up at five or seven bracelets of copper per tusk, if the slaves  sent will only be merciful. The nine villages destroyed, and 100 men  killed, by Katomba's slaves at Nasangwa's, were all about a string of  beads fastened to a powder horn, which a Manyuema man tried in vain to  steal!    Katomba gets twenty-five of the fifty tusks brought by his people. We  expect letters, and perhaps men by Syde bin Habib. No news from the  coast had come to Ujiji, save a rumour that some one was building a  large house at Bagamoio, but whether French or English no one can say:  possibly the erection of a huge establishment on the mainland may be a  way of laboriously proving that it is more healthy than the island. It  will take a long time to prove by stone and lime that the higher lands,  200 miles inland, are better still, both for longevity and work.[9] I am  in agony for news from home; all I feel sure of now is that my friends  will all wish me to complete my task. I join in the wish now, as better  than doing it in vain afterwards.    The Manyuema hoeing is little better than scraping the soil, and cutting  through the roots of grass and weeds, by a horizontal motion of the hoe  or knife; they leave the roots of maize, ground-nuts, sweet potatoes,  and dura, to find their way into the rich soft soil, and well they  succeed, so there is no need for deep ploughing: the ground-nuts and  cassava hold their own against grass for years, and bananas, if cleared  of weeds, yield abundantly. Mohamad sowed rice just outside the camp  without any advantage being secured by the vicinity of a rivulet, and it  yielded forone measure of seed one hundred and twenty measures of  increase. This season he plants along the rivulet called \"Bonde,\" and on  the damp soil.    The rain-water does not percolate far, for the clay retains it about two  feet beneath the surface: this is a cause of unhealthiness to man. Fowls  and goats have been cut off this year in large numbers by an epidemic.    The visits of the Ujijian traders must be felt by the Manyuema to be a  severe infliction, for the huts are appropriated, and no leave asked:  firewood, pots, baskets, and food are used without scruple, and anything  that pleases is taken away; usually the women flee into the forest, and  return to find the whole place a litter of broken food. I tried to pay  the owners of the huts in which I slept, but often in vain, for they hid  in the forest, and feared to come near. It was common for old men to  come forward to me with a present of bananas as I passed, uttering with  trembling accents, \"Bolongo, Bolongo!\" (\"Friendship, Friendship!\"), and  if I stopped to make a little return present, others ran for plantains  or palm-toddy. The Arabs' men ate up what they demanded, without one  word of thanks, and turned round to me and said, \"They are bad, don't  give them anything.\" \"Why, what badness is there in giving food?\" I  replied. \"Oh! they like you, but hate us.\" One man gave me an iron ring,  and all seemed inclined to be friendly, yet they are undoubtedly  bloodthirsty to other Manyuema, and kill each other.    I am told that journeying inland the safe way to avoid tsetse in going  to Merere's is to go to Mdonge, Makinde, Zungomero, Masapi, Irundu,  Nyangore, then turn north to the Nyannugams, and thence to Nyembe, and  so on south to Merere's. A woman chief lies in the straight way to  Merere, but no cattle live in the land. Another insect lights on the  animals, and when licked off bites the tongue, or breeds, and is fatal  as well as tsetse: it is larger in size. Tipo Tipo and Syde bin Ali  come to Nyembe, thence to Nsama's, cross Lualaba at Mpweto's, follow  left bank of that river till they cross the next Lualaba, and so into  Lunda of Matiamvo. Much ivory may be obtained by this course, and it  shows enterprise. Syde bin Habib and Dugumbe will open up the Lualaba  this year, and I am hoping to enter the West Lualaba, or Young's River,  and if possible go up to Katanga. The Lord be my guide and helper. I  feel the want of medicine strongly, almost as much as the want of men.    _16th October, 1870._--Moenemgoi, the chief, came to tell me that  Monamyembo had sent five goats to Lohombo to get a charm to kill him.  \"Would the English and Kolokolo (Mohamad) allow him to be killed while  they were here?\" I said that it was a false report, but he believes it  firmly: Monamyembo sent his son to assure us that he was slandered, but  thus quarrels and bloodshed feuds arise!    The great want of the Manyuema is national life, of this they have none:  each headman is independent of every other. Of industry they have no  lack, and the villagers are orderly towards each other, but they go no  further. If a man of another district ventures among them, it is at his  peril; he is not regarded with more favour as a Manyuema than one of a  herd of buffaloes is by the rest: and he is almost sure to be killed.    Moenekuss had more wisdom than his countrymen: his eldest son went over  to Monamyembo (one of his subjects) and was there murdered by five spear  wounds. The old chief went and asked who had slain his son. All  professed ignorance, whilst some suggested \"perhaps the Bahombo did it,\"  so he went off to them, but they also denied it and laid it at the door  of Monamdenda, from whom he got the same reply when he arrived at his  place--no one knew, and so the old man died. This, though he was  heartbroken, was called witchcraft by Monamyembo. Eleven people were  murdered, and after this cruel man was punished he sent a goat with the  confession that he had killed Moenekuss' son. This son had some of the  father's wisdom: the others he never could get to act like men of sense.    _19th October, 1870._--Bambarre. The ringleading deserters sent Chuma to  say that they were going with the people of Mohamad (who left to-day),  to the Metamba, but I said that I had nought to say to them. They would  go now to the Metamba, whom, on deserting, they said they so much  feared,"]]]
