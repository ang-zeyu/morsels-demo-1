When the normal child learns to speak, _o_ receives the  sound-impressions; by _a_ the acoustic-nerve excitations are passed  along to K, and are here stored up, every distinctly heard sound (a  tone, a syllable, a word) leaving an impression behind in K. It is  very remarkable here that, among the many sounds and noises that  impress themselves upon the portions of the brain directly connected  with the auditory nerve, a selection is made in the sound-field of  speech, K, since all those impressions that can be reproduced, among  them all the acoustic images necessary for speech, are preserved, but  many others are not, e. g., thunder, crackling. Memory is indistinct  with regard to these. From K, when the sound-images or  sound-impressions have become sufficiently strong and numerous, the  nerve-excitement goes farther through the connecting paths _v_ to M,  where it liberates motor impulses, and through _h_ sets in activity  the peripheral apparatus of speech, _z_.    Now, speech is disturbed when at any point the path _o_ _z_ is  interrupted, or the excitation conducted along the nerve-fibers and  ganglionic cells upon the hearing of something spoken or upon the  speaking of something represented in idea (heard inwardly) is arrested,  a thing which may be effected without a total interruption of the  conduction, e. g., by means of poison and through anatomical lesions.    On the basis of these physiological relations, about which there is no  doubt, I divide, then, all pure disturbances of speech, or  _lalopathies_, into three classes:    (1) Periphero-Impressive or Perceptive Disturbances.    The organ of hearing is injured _at its peripheral extremity_, or else  the acusticus in its course; then occurs _difficulty of hearing_ or  _deafness_. What is spoken is not correctly heard or not heard at all:  the utterance is correct only in case the lesion happened late. If it  is inborn, then this lack of speech, alalia, is called _deaf-mutism_,  although the so-called deaf and dumb are not in reality dumb, but only  deaf. If words spoken are incorrectly heard on account of acquired  defects of the peripheral ear, the patient mis-hears, and the abnormal  condition is called paracusis.    (2) Central Disturbances.    _a._ The higher impressive central paths are disturbed: _centro-sensory  dysphasia and aphasia_, or _word-deafness_. Words are heard but not  understood. The hearing is acute. \"Patients may have perfectly correct  ideas, but they lack the correct expression for them; not the thoughts  but the words are confused. They would understand the ideas of others  also if they only understood the words. They are in the position of  persons suddenly transported into the midst of a people using the same  sounds but different words, which strike upon their ear like an  unintelligible noise.\" (Kussmaul.) Their articulation is without defect,  but what they say is unintelligible because the words are mutilated and  used wrongly. C. Wernicke discovered this form, and has separated it  sharply from other disturbances of speech. He designated it sensory  aphasia. Kussmaul later named this abnormal condition word-deafness  (surditas verbalis).    _b._ The connections between the impressive sound-centers and the motor  speech-center are injured. Then we have intercentral conductive  dysphasia and aphasia. What is spoken is heard and understood correctly  even when _v_ is completely interrupted. The articulation is not  disturbed, and yet the patient utters no word of himself. He can,  however, read aloud what is written. (Kussmaul.) The word that has just  been read aloud by the patient can not be repeated by him, neither can  the word that has been pronounced to him; and, notwithstanding this, he  reads aloud with perfect correctness. In this case, then, it is  impossible for the patient of his own motion, even if the memory of the  words heard were not lost, to set in activity the expressive mechanism  of speech, although it might remain uninjured.    _c._ The motor speech-center is injured. Then we have centro-motor  dysphasia and aphasia. If the center is completely and exclusively  disturbed, then it is a case of pure ataxic aphasia. Spontaneous  speaking, saying over of words said by another, and reading aloud of  writing, are impossible. (Kussmaul.) On the other hand, words heard are  understood, although the concepts belonging with them can not be  expressed aloud. The verbal memory remains; and the patient can still  express his thoughts in writing and can copy in writing what he reads or  what is dictated to him.    (3) Periphero-Expressive or Articulatory Disturbances.    The centrifugal paths from the motor speech-center to the motor nerves  of speech and to their extremities, or else these nerves themselves,  are injured. Then occurs _dysarthria_, and, if the path is totally  impassable at any place, _anarthria_. The hearing and understanding of  words are not hindered, but speaking, repeating the words of others,  and reading aloud are, as in the last case (2, _c_), impossible. In  general this form can not be distinguished from the foregoing when  both are developed in an extreme degree, except in cases of peripheral  dysarthria, i. e., dyslalia, since, as may be easily understood, it  makes no difference in the resulting phenomena whether the motor  center itself is extirpated or its connections with the motor outlet  are absolutely cut off just where the latter begins; but if this  latter is injured nearer to the periphery, e. g., if the hypoglossus  is paralyzed, then the phenomena are different (paralalia, mogilalia).  Here belongs all so-called mechanical dyslalia, caused by defects of  the peripheral speech-apparatus.    Of these five forms each occurs generally only in connection with  another; for this reason the topical diagnosis also is often  extraordinarily difficult. But enough cases have been accurately  observed and collected to put it almost beyond a doubt that each form  may also appear for a short time purely by itself. To be sure, the  anatomical localization of the impressive and expressive paths is not  yet ascertained, so that for the present the centripetal roads from  the acusticus to the motor speech-center, and the intercentral fibers  that run to the higher centers, are as much unknown as the centrifugal  paths leading from them to the nuclei of the hypoglossus; but that the  speech-center discovered by Broca is situated in the posterior portion  of the third frontal convolution (in right-handed men on the left, in  left-handed on the right) is universally acknowledged.    Further, it results from the abundance of clinical material, that the  acoustic-center K must be divided into a sound-center L, a  syllable-center S, a word-center W, each of which may be in itself  defective, for cases have been observed in which sounds were still  recognized and reproduced, but not syllables and words, also cases in  which sounds and syllables could be dealt with but no words; and,  finally, cases in which all these were wanting. The original diagram  is thereby considerably complicated, as the simple path of connection  between K and M has added to it the arcs L S M and L S W M (Fig. 2).    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    The surest test of the perfect condition of all the segments is afforded  by the repetition of sounds, syllables, and words pronounced by others.    Syllables and sounds, but no words, can be pronounced if W is missing  or the path S W or W M is interrupted; no syllables if S is missing or  L S or S M is interrupted. If L is missing, then nothing can be  repeated from hearing. If L M is interrupted, then syllables and words  are more easily repeated than simple sounds, so far as the latter are  not syllables. If L S is interrupted, then simple sounds only can be  repeated. All these abnormal states have been actually observed. The  proofs are to be found in Kussmaul's classic work on the disturbances  of speech (1877). Even the strange case appears in which, L M being  impracticable, syllables are more easily repeated than simple sounds.    If _a_ is interrupted before the acquirement of speech, and thus chronic  deafness is present in very early childhood, articulation may still be  learned through visual and tactile impressions; but in this case the  sound-center L is not developed. Another, a sound-touch-center, comes in  its place in deaf-mutes when they are instructed, chiefly through the  tactile sensations of the tongue; and, when they are instructed in  reading (and writing), a sound-sight-(or letter) center. This last is,  on the contrary, wanting to those born blind; and both are wanting to  those born blind and deaf. Instead is formed in them through careful  instruction, by means of the tactile sensations of the finger-tips, a  center for signs of sound that are known by touch (as with the printed  text for the blind).    Accordingly, the eye and ear are not absolutely indispensable to the  acquirement of a verbal language; but for the thorough learning of the  verbal language in its entire significance both are by all means  indispensable. For, the person born blind does not get the significance  of words pertaining to light and color. For him, therefore, a large  class of conceptions, an extensive portion of the vocabulary of his  language, remains empty sound. To the one born deaf there is likewise an  extensive district of conceptions closed, inasmuch as all words  pertaining to tone and noise remain unintelligible to him.    Moreover, those born blind and deaf, or those born blind and becoming  deaf very early, or those born deaf and becoming blind very early,  though they may possess ever so good intelligence, and perhaps even  learn to write letters, as did the famous Laura Bridgman, will  invariably understand only a small part of the vocabulary of their  language, and will not articulate correctly.

Wallace says of it, that its brain is  very small, and it possesses such tenacity of life that it is very  difficult to kill; he adds that it is said to have only one at a birth,  and one he shot had a very small blind naked little creature clinging  closely to its breast, which was quite bare and much wrinkled.  Raffles, however, gives two as the number produced at each birth.  Dr. Cantor says that in confinement plantains constitute the  favourite food, but deprived of liberty it soon dies. In its wild  state it \"lives entirely on young fruits and leaves; those of the  cocoanut and _Bombax pentandrum_ are its favourite food, and it  commits great injury to the plantations of these.\"--_Horsfield's_  'Cat. Mam.' Regarding its powers of flight, Wallace, in his 'Travels  in the Malay Archipelago,' says: \"I saw one of these animals run up  a tree in a rather open space, and then glide obliquely through the  air to another tree on which it alighted near its base, and  immediately began to ascend. I paced the distance from one tree to  the other, and found it to be seventy yards, and the amount of descent  not more than thirty-five or forty feet, or less than one in five.  This, I think, proves that the animal must have some power of guiding  itself through the air, otherwise in so long a distance it would have  little chance of alighting exactly upon the trunk.\"    There is a carefully prepared skeleton of this animal in the Indian  Museum in Calcutta.          ORDER CARNARIA.      CHEIROPTERA.    It may seem strange to many that such an insignificant, weird little  creature as a bat should rank so high in the animal kingdom as to  be but a few removes from man. It has, however, some striking  anatomical affinities with the last Order, _Quadrumana_, sufficient  to justify its being placed in the next link of the great chain of  creation.    [Figure: Sternum of _Pteropus_.]    \"Bats have the arms, fore-arms and fingers excessively elongated,  so as to form with the membrane that occupies their intervals, real  wings, the surface of which is equally or more extended than in those  of birds. Hence they fly high and with great rapidity.\"--_Cuvier_.  They suckle their young at the breast, but some of them have pubic  warts resembling mammae. The muscles of the chest are developed in  proportion, and the sternum has a medial ridge something like that  of a bird. They are all nocturnal, with small eyes (except in the  case of the frugivorous bats), large ears, and in some cases  membranous appendages to the nostrils, which may possibly be for the  purpose of guiding themselves in the dark, for it is proved by  experiment that bats are not dependent on eyesight for guidance, and  one naturalist has remarked that, in a certain species of bat which  has no facial membrane, this delicacy of perception was absent. I  have noticed this in one species, _Cynopterus marginatus_, one of  which flew into my room not long ago, and which repeatedly dashed  itself against a glass door in its efforts to escape. I had all the  other doors closed.    Bats are mostly insectivorous; a few are fruit-eaters, such as our  common flying-fox. They produce from one to two at a birth, which  are carried about by the mother and suckled at the breast, this  peculiarity being one of the anatomical details alluded to as  claiming for the bats so high a place.    Bats are divided into four sub-families--Pteropodidae, Vampyridae,  Noctilionidae, and Vespertilionidae.      MEGACHIROPTERA.      SUB-FAMILY PTEROPODIDAE.      _GENUS PTEROPUS_.    These are frugivorous bats of large size, differing, as remarked by  Jerdon, so much in their dentition from the insectivorous species  that they seem to lead through the flying Lemurs (_Colugos_) directly  to the _Quadrumana_. The dentition is more adapted to their diet;  they have cutting incisors to each jaw, and grinders with flat crowns,  and their intestines are longer than those of the insectivorous bats.  They produce but one at birth, and the young ones leave their parents  as soon as they can provide for themselves. The tongue is covered  with rough papillae. They have no tail. These bats and some of the  following genus, which are also frugivorous, are distinguished from  the rest of the bats by a claw on the first or index finger, which  is short.

NATIVE NAMES.--_Badul_, Bengali and Mahratti; _Wurbagul_, Hindi;  _Toggul bawali_, Canarese; _Sikurayi_, Telegu.    HABITAT.--All through India, Ceylon, and Burmah.    [Figure: The Flying Fox at Home.]    DESCRIPTION.--Head and nape rufous black; neck and shoulders golden  yellow (the hair longer); back dark brown; chin dark; rest of body  beneath fulvous or rusty brown; interfemoral membrane brownish  black.--_Jerdon_.    SIZE.--Length, 12 to 14 inches; extent of wings, 46 to 52 inches.    These bats roost on trees in vast numbers. I have generally found  them to prefer tamarinds of large size. Some idea of the extent of  these colonies may be gathered from observations by McMaster, who  attempted to calculate the number in a colony. He says: \"In five  minutes a friend and I counted upwards of six hundred as they passed  over head, _en route_ to their feeding grounds; supposing their  nightly exodus to continue for twenty minutes, this would give  upwards of two thousand in one roosting place, exclusive of those  who took a different direction.\"    [Figure: Head of _Pteropus medius_.]    Tickell's account of these colonies is most graphic, though Emerson  Tennent has also given a most interesting and correct account of  their habits. The former writes:--\"From the arrival of the first  comer until the sun is high above the horizon, a scene of incessant  wrangling and contention is enacted among them, as each endeavours  to secure a higher and better place, or to eject a neighbour from  too close vicinage. In these struggles the bats hook themselves along  the branches, scrambling about hand over hand with some speed, biting  each other severely, striking out with the long claw of the thumb,  shrieking and cackling without intermission. Each new arrival is  compelled to fly several times round the tree, being threatened from  all points, and, when he eventually hooks on, he has to go through  a series of combats, and be probably ejected two or three times before  he makes good his tenure.\" For faithful portraying, no one could  improve on this description. These bats are exceeding strong on the  wing. I was aware that they went long distances in search of food,  but I was not aware of the power they had for sustained flight till  the year 1869, when, on my way to England on furlough, I discovered  a large flying fox winging his way towards our vessel, which was at  that time more than two hundred miles from land. Exhausted, it clung  on to the fore-yard arm; and a present of a rupee induced a Lascar  to go aloft and seize it, which he did after several attempts. The  voracity with which it attacked some plantains showed that it had  been for some time deprived of food, probably having been blown off  shore by high winds. Hanging head-downwards from its cage, it stuffed  the fruit into its cheeks, monkey-fashion, and then seemed to chew  it at leisure. When I left the steamer at Suez it remained in the  captain's possession, and seemed to be tame and reconciled to its  imprisonment, tempered by a surfeit of plantains. In flying over  water they frequently dip down to touch the surface. Jerdon was in  doubt whether they did this to drink or not, but McMaster feels sure  that they do this in order to drink, and that the habit is not peculiar  to the _Pteropodidae_, as he has noticed other bats doing the same.  Colonel Sykes states that he \"can personally testify that their flesh  is delicate and without disagreeable flavour;\" and another colonel  of my acquaintance once regaled his friends on some flying fox  cutlets, which were pronounced \"not bad.\" Dr. Day accuses these bats  of intemperate habits; drinking the toddy from the earthen pots on  the cocoanut trees, and flying home intoxicated. The wild almond is  a favourite fruit.    Mr. Rainey, who has been a careful observer of animals for years,  states that in Bengal these bats prefer clumps of bamboos for a  resting place, and feed much on the fruit of the betel-nut palm when  ripe. Another naturalist, Mr. G. Vidal, writes that in Southern India  the _P. medius_ feeds chiefly on the green drupe or nut of the  Alexandrian laurel (_Calophyllum inophyllum_), the kernels of which  contain a strong-smelling green oil on which the bats fatten  amazingly; and then they in turn yield, when boiled down, an oil which  is recommended as an excellent stimulative application for the hair.  I noticed in Seonee a curious superstition to the effect that a bone  of this bat tied on to the ankle by a cord of black cowhair is a  sovereign remedy, according to the natives, for rheumatism in the  leg. Tickell states that these bats produce one at a time in March  or April, and they continue a fixture on the mother till the end of  May or beginning of June.      NO. 32.
