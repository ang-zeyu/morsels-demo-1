[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1860"],[0,"Westward Ho! Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#14)"],[1," There, dear readers, Ex pede Herculem; I cannot tire myself or you  (especially in this book) with any wire-drawn soul-dissections. I have  tried to hint to you two opposite sorts of men,--the one trying to be  good with all his might and main, according to certain approved methods  and rules, which he has got by heart, and like a weak oarsman, feeling  and fingering his spiritual muscles over all day, to see if they are  growing; the other not even knowing whether he is good or not, but just  doing the right thing without thinking about it, as simply as a little  child, because the Spirit of God is with him. If you cannot see the  great gulf fixed between the two, I trust that you will discover it some  day.    But in justice be it said, all this came upon Eustace, not because he  was a Romanist, but because he was educated by the Jesuits. Had he been  saved from them, he might have lived and died as simple and honest a  gentleman as his brothers, who turned out like true Englishmen (as did  all the Romish laity) to face the great Armada, and one of whom was  fighting at that very minute under St. Leger in Ireland, and as brave  and loyal a soldier as those Roman Catholics whose noble blood has  stained every Crimean battlefield; but his fate was appointed otherwise;  and the Upas-shadow which has blighted the whole Romish Church, blighted  him also.    \"Ah, my dearest cousin!\" said Eustace, \"how disappointed I was this  morning at finding I had arrived just a day too late to witness your  triumph! But I hastened to your home as soon as I could, and learning  from your mother that I should find you here, hurried down to bid you  welcome again to Devon.\"    \"Well, old lad, it does look very natural to see you. I often used to  think of you walking the deck o' nights. Uncle and the girls are all  right, then? But is the old pony dead yet? And how's Dick the smith, and  Nancy? Grown a fine maid by now, I warrant. 'Slid, it seems half a life  that I've been away.    \"And you really thought of your poor cousin? Be sure that he, too,  thought of you, and offered up nightly his weak prayers for your safety  (doubtless, not without avail) to those saints, to whom would that  you--\"    \"Halt there, coz. If they are half as good fellows as you and I take  them for, they'll help me without asking.\"    \"They have helped you, Amyas.\"    \"Maybe; I'd have done as much, I'm sure, for them, if I 'd been in their  place.\"    \"And do you not feel, then, that you owe a debt of gratitude to them;  and, above all, to her, whose intercessions have, I doubt not, availed  for your preservation? Her, the star of the sea, the all-compassionate  guide of the mariner?\"    \"Humph!\" said Amyas. \"Here's Frank; let him answer.\"    And, as he spoke, up came Frank, and after due greetings, sat down  beside them on the ridge.    \"I say, brother, here's Eustace trying already to convert me; and  telling me that I owe all my luck to the Blessed Virgin's prayers for  me.    \"It may be so,\" said Frank; \"at least you owe it to the prayers of that  most pure and peerless virgin by whose commands you sailed; the sweet  incense of whose orisons has gone up for you daily, and for whose sake  you were preserved from flood and foe, that you might spread the fame  and advance the power of the spotless championess of truth, and right,  and freedom,--Elizabeth, your queen.\"    Amyas answered this rhapsody, which would have been then both  fashionable and sincere, by a loyal chuckle. Eustace smiled meekly, but  answered somewhat venomously nevertheless--    \"I, at least, am certain that I speak the truth, when I call my  patroness a virgin undefiled.\"    Both the brothers' brows clouded at once. Amyas, as he lay on his back  on the pebbles, said quietly to the gulls over his head--\"I wonder what  the Frenchman whose head I cut off at the Azores, thinks by now about  all that.\"    \"Cut off a Frenchman's head?\" said Frank.    \"Yes, faith; and so fleshed my maiden sword. I'll tell you. It was  in some tavern; I and George Drake had gone in, and there sat this  Frenchman, with his sword on the table, ready for a quarrel (I found  afterwards he was a noted bully), and begins with us loudly enough about  this and that; but, after awhile, by the instigation of the devil, what  does he vent but a dozen slanders against her majesty's honor, one atop  of the other? I was ashamed to hear them, and I should be more ashamed  to repeat them.\"    \"I have heard enough of such,\" said Frank. \"They come mostly through  lewd rascals about the French ambassador, who have been bred (God help  them) among the filthy vices of that Medicean Court in which the Queen  of Scots had her schooling; and can only perceive in a virtuous freedom  a cloak for licentiousness like their own. Let the curs bark; Honi soit  qui mal y pense is our motto, and shall be forever.\"    \"But I didn't let the cur bark; for I took him by the ears, to show him  out into the street. Whereon he got to his sword, and I to mine; and a  very near chance I had of never bathing on the pebble ridge more; for  the fellow did not fight with edge and buckler, like a Christian, but  had some newfangled French devil's device of scryming and foining with  his point, ha'ing and stamping, and tracing at me, that I expected to be  full of eyelet holes ere I could close with him.\"    \"Thank God that you are safe, then!\" said Frank. \"I know that play well  enough, and dangerous enough it is.\"    \"Of course you know it; but I didn't, more's the pity.\"    \"Well, I'll teach it thee, lad, as well as Rowland Yorke himself,         'Thy fincture, carricade, and sly passata,       Thy stramazon, and resolute stoccata,       Wiping maudritta, closing embrocata,       And all the cant of the honorable fencing mystery.'\"    \"Rowland Yorke? Who's he, then?\"    \"A very roystering rascal, who is making good profit in London just now  by teaching this very art of fence; and is as likely to have his mortal  thread clipt in a tavern brawl, as thy Frenchman. But how did you escape  his pinking iron?\"    \"How? Had it through my left arm before I could look round; and at that  I got mad, and leapt upon him, and caught him by the wrist, and then had  a fair side-blow; and, as fortune would have it, off tumbled his head on  to the table, and there was an end of his slanders.\"    \"So perish all her enemies!\" said Frank; and Eustace, who had been  trying not to listen, rose and said--    \"I trust that you do not number me among them?\"    \"As you speak, I do, coz,\" said Frank. \"But for your own sake, let  me advise you to put faith in the true report of those who have daily  experience of their mistress's excellent virtue, as they have of the  sun's shining, and of the earth's bringing forth fruit, and not in the  tattle of a few cowardly back-stair rogues, who wish to curry favor with  the Guises. Come, we will say no more. Walk round with us by Appledore,  and then home to breakfast.\"    But Eustace declined, having immediate business, he said, in Northam  town, and then in Bideford; and so left them to lounge for another  half-hour on the beach, and then walk across the smooth sheet of turf to  the little white fishing village, which stands some two miles above the  bar, at the meeting of the Torridge and the Taw.    Now it came to pass, that Eustace Leigh, as we have seen, told his  cousins that he was going to Northam: but he did not tell them that  his point was really the same as their own, namely, Appledore; and,  therefore, after having satisfied his conscience by going as far as the  very nearest house in Northam village, he struck away sharp to the left  across the fields, repeating I know not what to the Blessed Virgin all  the way; whereby he went several miles out of his road; and also, as  is the wont of crooked spirits, Jesuits especially (as three centuries  sufficiently testify), only outwitted himself. For his cousins going  merrily, like honest men, along the straight road across the turf,  arrived in Appledore, opposite the little \"Mariner's Rest\" Inn, just in  time to see what Eustace had taken so much trouble to hide from them,  namely, four of Mr. Thomas Leigh's horses standing at the door, held by  his groom, saddles and mail-bags on back, and mounting three of them,  Eustace Leigh and two strange gentlemen.    \"There's one lie already this morning,\" growled Amyas; \"he told us he  was going to Northam.\"    \"And we do not know that he has not been there,\" blandly suggested  Frank.    \"Why, you are as bad a Jesuit as he, to help him out with such a fetch.\"    \"He may have changed his mind.\"    \"Bless your pure imagination, my sweet boy,\" said Amyas, laying his  great hand on Frank's head, and mimicking his mother's manner. \"I  say, dear Frank, let's step into this shop and buy a penny-worth of  whipcord.\"    \"What do you want with whipcord, man?\"    \"To spin my top, to be sure.\"    \"Top? how long hast had a top?\"    \"I'll buy one, then, and save my conscience; but the upshot of this  sport I must see. Why may not I have an excuse ready made as well as  Master Eustace?\"    So saying, he pulled Frank into the little shop, unobserved by the party  at the inn-door.    \"What strange cattle has he been importing now? Look at that  three-legged fellow, trying to get aloft on the wrong side. How he claws  at his horse's ribs, like a cat scratching an elder stem!\"    The three-legged man was a tall, meek-looking person, who had bedizened  himself with gorgeous garments, a great feather, and a sword so long  and broad, that it differed little in size from the very thin and stiff  shanks between which it wandered uncomfortably.    \"Young David in Saul's weapons,\" said Frank. \"He had better not go in  them, for he certainly has not proved them.\"    \"Look, if his third leg is not turned into a tail! Why does not some one  in charity haul in half-a-yard of his belt for him?\"    It was too true; the sword, after being kicked out three or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18613"],[0,"The Golden Scorpion (#14)"],[1,"that Zara el-Khala had  left. Two men had followed her and had telephoned from Calais for  instructions. She had crossed by the night mail for Dover. It was  already too late to instruct the English police.    For a few hours I had relaxed my usual vigilance--and this was the  result. What could I do? Zara el-Khala had committed no crime, but  her sudden flight--for it looked like flight you will agree--was  highly suspicious. And as I sat there in my office filled with all  sorts of misgivings, in ran one of the men engaged in watching the  Grand Duke.    The Grand Duke had been seized with illness as he left his box in the  Montmartre theatre and had died before his car could reach the hotel!          CHAPTER III    A STRANGE QUESTION      A conviction burst upon my mind that a frightful crime had been  committed. By whom and for what purpose I knew not. I hastened to the  hotel of the Grand Duke. Tremendous excitement prevailed there, of  course. There is no more certain way for a great personage to court  publicity than to travel incognito. Everywhere that \"M. de Stahler\"  had appeared all Paris had cried, \"There goes the Grand Duke Ivan!\"  And now as I entered the hotel, press, police and public were  demanding: \"Is it true that the Grand Duke is dead?\" Just emerging  from the lift I saw Casimir. _In propria persona_--as M. Max--he  failed to recognize me.    \"My good man,\" I said--\"are you a member of the suite of the late  Grand Duke?\"    \"I am, or was, the valet of M. de Stahler, monsieur,\" he replied.    I showed him my card.    \"To me 'M. de Stahler' is the Grand Duke Ivan. What other servants had  he with him?\" I asked, although I knew very well.    \"None, monsieur.\"    \"Where and when was he taken ill?\"    \"At the Theatre Coquerico. Montmartre, at about a quarter past ten  o'clock to-night.\"    \"Who was with him?\"    \"No one, monsieur. His Highness was alone in a box. I had instructions  to call with the car at eleven o'clock.\"    \"Well?\"    \"The theatre management telephoned at a quarter past ten to say that  His Highness had been taken ill and that a physician had been sent for.  I went in the car at once and found him lying in one of the  dressing-rooms to which he had been carried. A medical man was in  attendance. The Grand Duke was unconscious. We moved him to the car----\"    \"_We?_\"    \"The doctor, the theatre manager, and myself. The Grand Duke was then  alive, the physician declared, although he seemed to me to be already  dead. But just before we reached the hotel, the physician, who was  watching His Highness anxiously, cried, 'Ah,_mon Dieu!_ It is finished.  What a catastrophe!'\"    \"He was dead?\"    \"He was dead, monsieur.\"    \"Who has seen him?\"    \"They have telephoned for half the doctors in Paris, monsieur, but it  is too late.\"    He was affected, the good Casimir. Tears welled up in his eyes. I  mounted in the lift to the apartment in which the Grand Duke lay.  Three doctors were there, one of them being he of whom Casimir had  spoken. Consternation was written on every face.    \"It was his heart,\" I was assured by the doctor who had been summoned  to the theatre. \"We shall find that he suffered from heart trouble.\"    They were all agreed upon the point.    \"He must have sustained a great emotional shock,\" said another.    \"You are convinced that there was no foul play, gentlemen?\" I asked.    They were quite unanimous on the point.    \"Did the Grand Duke make any statement at the time of the seizure  which would confirm the theory of a heart attack?\"    No. He had fallen down unconscious outside the door of his box, and  from this unconsciousness he had never recovered. (Depositions of  witnesses, medical evidence and other documents are available for  the guidance of whoever may care to see them, but, as is well known,  the death of the Grand Duke was ascribed to natural causes and it  seemed as though my trouble would after all prove to be in vain.)  Let us see what happened.    Leaving the hotel, on the night of the Grand Duke's death, I joined  the man who was watching the cafe telephone.    There had been a message during the course of the evening, but it had  been for a Greek cigarette-maker and it referred to the theft of  several bales of Turkish tobacco--useful information, of minor kind,  but of little interest to me. I knew that it would be useless to  question the man Miguel, although I strongly suspected him of being  a member of \"The Scorpion's\" organization. Any patron of the  establishment enjoyed the privilege of receiving private telephone  calls at the cafe on payment of a small fee.    A man of less experience in obscure criminology might now have assumed  that he had been misled by a series of striking coincidences. Remember,  there was not a shadow of doubt in the minds of the medical experts  that the Grand Duke had died from syncope. His own professional  advisor had sent written testimony to show that there was hereditary  heart trouble, although not of a character calculated to lead to a  fatal termination except under extraordinary circumstances. His own  Government, which had every reason to suspect that the Grand Duke's  assassination might be attempted, was satisfied. _Eh bien!_ I was not.    I cross-examined the manager of the Theatre Coquerico. He admitted that  Mlle. Zara el-Khala had been a mystery throughout her engagement.  Neither he nor anyone else connected with the house had ever entered  her dressing-room or held any conversation with her, whatever, except  the stage-manager and the musical director. These had spoken to her  about her music and about lighting and other stage effects. She spoke  perfect French.    Such a state of affairs was almost incredible, but was explained by  the fact that the dancer, at a most modest salary, had doubled the  takings of the theatre in a few days and had attracted capacity  business throughout the remainder of her engagement. She had written  from Marseilles, enclosing press notices and other usual matter and  had been booked direct for one week. She had remained for two months,  and might have remained for ever, the poor manager assured me, at five  times the salary!    A curious fact now came to light. In all her photographs Zara  el-Khala appeared veiled, in the Eastern manner; that is to say, she  wore a white silk _yashmak_ which concealed all her face except her  magnificent eyes! On the stage the veil was discarded; in the  photographs it was always present.    And the famous picture which she had sent to the Grand Duke? He had  destroyed it, in a fit of passion, on returning from the Bois de  Boulogne after his encounter with Chunda Lal!    It is Fate after all--Kismet--and not the wit of man which leads to  the apprehension of really great criminals--a tireless Fate which  dogs their footsteps, a remorseless Fate from which they fly in vain.  Long after the funeral of the Grand Duke, and at a time when I had  almost forgotten Zara el-Khala, I found myself one evening at the  opera with a distinguished French scientist and he chanced to refer  to the premature death (which had occurred a few months earlier) of  Henrik Ericksen, the Norwegian.    \"A very great loss to the century, M. Max,\" he said. \"Ericksen was as  eminent in electrical science as the Grand Duke Ivan was eminent in  the science of war. Both were stricken down in the prime of life--and  under almost identical circumstances.\"    \"That is true,\" I said thoughtfully.    \"It would almost seem,\" he continued, \"as if Nature had determined to  foil any further attempts to rifle her secrets and Heaven to check  mankind in the making of future wars. Only three months after the  Grand Duke's death, the American admiral, Mackney, died at sea--you  will remember? Now, following Ericksen, Van Rembold, undoubtedly the  greatest mining engineer of the century and the only man who has  ever produced radium in workable quantities, is seized with illness  at a friend's house and expires even before medical aid can be  summoned.\"    \"It is very strange.'    \"It is uncanny.\"    \"Were you personally acquainted with the late Van Rembold?\" I asked.    \"I knew him intimately--a man of unusual charm, M. Max; and I have  particular reason to remember his death, for I actually met him and  spoke to him less than an hour before he died. We only exchanged a  few words--we met on the street; but I shall never forget the subject  of our chat.\"    \"How is that?\" I asked.    \"Well, I presume Van Rembold's question was prompted by his knowledge  of the fact that I had studied such subjects at one time; but he  asked me if I knew of any race or sect in Africa or Asia who  worshipped scorpions.\"    \"_Scorpions!_\" I cried. \"_Ah, mon Dieu!_ monsieur say it again--  _scorpions?_\"    \"But yes, certainly. Does it surprise you?\"    \"Did it not surprise _you_?\"    \"Undoubtedly. I could not imagine what had occurred to account for  his asking so strange a question. I replied that I knew of no such  sect, and Van Rembold immediately changed the subject, nor did he  revert to it. So that I never learned why he had made that singular  inquiry.\"    You can imagine that this conversation afforded me much food for  reflection. Whilst I could think of no reason why anyone should plot  to assassinate Grand Dukes, admirals and mining engineers, the  circumstances of the several cases were undoubtedly similar in a  number of respects. But it was the remarkable question asked by Van  Rembold which particularly aroused my interest.    Of course it might prove to be nothing more than a coincidence, but  when one comes to consider how rarely the word \"scorpion\" is used,  outside those in which these insects abound, it appears to be  something more. Van Rembold, then, had had some occasion to feel  curious about the scorpions; the name \"Scorpion\" was associated  with the Hindu follower of Zara el-Khala; and she was who had  brought the Grand Duke to Paris, where he had died."]]]
