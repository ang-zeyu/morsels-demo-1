A little of the liquor,  thickened with flour, may be served as a sauce.      ~FRIED SPANISH ONIONS~--Peel and slice two pounds of Spanish onions.  Place them in a hot frying-pan, containing two heaping tablespoonfuls of  butter, add salt and pepper.      ~BOILED OYSTER PLANT~--Scrape a bunch of oyster plants, dropping into  cold water to which a little vinegar has been added. Cut in small pieces  and boil in salted water until tender. Season with butter, pepper and  cream. Cream may be omitted if desired.      ~BROILED POTATOES~--Peel a half dozen medium-sized cooked potatoes,  halve them and lay upon a dish, seasoning with a pinch of salt, and  pour over them two tablespoons of butter and roll them thoroughly in it.  Then arrange them on a double broiler, and broil over a moderate fire  for three minutes on each side. Serve in a folded napkin on a hot dish.      ~PARSNIP FRITTERS~--Peel and boil some parsnips until tender, then drain  thoroughly and mash, mixing in with them two beaten eggs, salt to taste,  and sufficient flour to bind them stiffly. Divide and mold the mixture  into small round cakes with floured hands. Put a large piece of butter  into a stewpan, place on the fire and let it boil. Then put in the cakes  and fry to a nice golden brown color. Take out and drain them, and serve  on a napkin spread over a hot dish, with a garnish of fried parsley.      ~MASHED PARSNIPS~--Wash and scrape some parsnips, cut in pieces  lengthwise, put them in a saucepan with boiling water, a little salt and  a small lump of drippings. Boil till tender, remove and place in a  colander to drain, and press all the waste out of them. Mash them till  quite smooth with a wooden spoon, put them in a saucepan with a  tablespoonful of milk or a small lump of butter, and a little salt and  pepper; stir over the fire until thoroughly hot again, turn out on to a  dish, and serve immediately.      ~POTATO BALLS~--Mash thoroughly a pound of boiled potatoes and rub them  through a wire sieve. Mix in a quarter of a pound of grated ham, a  little chopped parsley, and a small onion chopped very fine, together  with a small quantity of grated nutmeg, and the beaten yolks of two  eggs. Roll this mixture into balls of equal size, then roll in flour and  egg-breadcrumbs, and fry in dripping or brown them in the oven, and  serve on a hot dish.      ~POTATOES AND ONIONS SAUTED~--Take an equal amount of small new potatoes  and onions of equal size, peel and place in a saute pan with a  good-sized piece of butter, tossing them over the fire for a quarter of  an hour, being careful not to let them burn. Put in enough water to half  cover the vegetables, add a little salt and pepper, place the lid over  the pan and stew gently for half an hour, then squeeze a little lemon  juice in it and turn on a hot dish, and serve.      ~POTATOES LYONNAISE~--Cut into round slices eight boiled potatoes, lay  in a frying-pan with an ounce and a half of butter and the round slices  of a fried onion, seasoning with a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cook  for six minutes, or until they become well browned, tossing them all the  while. Sprinkle over with a small quantity of chopped parsley, and  serve.      ~STEWED MUSHROOMS~--Peel and remove the stalks from some large  mushrooms, wash and cut them into halves; put two ounces of butter into  a small lined saucepan with two tablespoonfuls of flour and stir this  over the fire, then mix in by degrees one and one-half breakfast cupfuls  of milk; while boiling and after being thickened, put in the mushrooms.  Season to taste with salt, pepper and a small quantity of powdered mace,  and stew gently on the side of the fire until tender. When cooked turn  the mushrooms on to a hot dish, garnish with some croutons of bread that  have been fried to a nice brown, and serve.      ~STUFFED ONIONS, STEAMED~--Peel eight large onions and boil for ten  minutes, and salt them slightly. Remove them from the fire, drain quite  dry, push about half the insides out; chop the parts taken out very  small, together with a little sausage meat; add one teacupful of  breadcrumbs, one egg, and salt and pepper to taste. Put this mixture  into the cavity in the onions, piling a little on the top and bottom so  that none shall be left. Arrange them in a deep pan. Put them in a  steamer over a saucepan of water and steam for one hour and a half. Put  the pan in the oven to brown the tops of the onions, adding one  breakfast cupful of butter to prevent burning. Arrange them tastefully  on a dish, and serve hot.      ~POTATO CROQUETTES~--Take four boiled potatoes and add to them half  their weight in butter, the same quantity of powdered sugar, salt,  grated peel of half a lemon and two well beaten eggs. Mix thoroughly and  roll into cork-shaped pieces and dip into the beaten yolks of eggs,  rolling in sifted breadcrumbs. Let stand one hour and again dip in egg  and roll in crumbs. Fry in boiling lard or butter. Serve with a garnish  of parsley.      ~CREAMED POTATOES~--Cut into cubes or dices about half a pound of boiled  potatoes and place in a shallow baking pan. Pour over them enough milk  or cream to cover them and put in the oven or on the side of the stove  and cook gently until nearly all the milk is absorbed. Add a  tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful each of finely chopped parsley,  and salt, and half a saltspoonful of pepper, mixed well together. When  they have become thoroughly warmed turn into a dish, and serve  immediately.      ~APPLES AND ONIONS~--Select sour apples, pare, core and thinly slice.  Slice about half as many onions, put some bacon fat in the bottom of a  frying-pan and when melted add the apples and onions. Cover the pan and  cook until tender, cooking rather slowly. Sprinkle with sugar, and serve  with roast pork.      ~BACON AND SPINACH~--Line a pudding dish with thin slices of raw bacon.  Take boiled spinach, ready for the table, season with butter, salt and  pepper. Take also some boiled carrots, turnips and onions. Whip up the  yolk of an egg with pepper and salt, and stir into the carrots and  turnips. Arrange the vegetables alternately in the dish and partially  fill with boiling water. Steam for an hour. Turn out on a flat dish, and  serve with a rich brown gravy.      ~BOILED CELERY~--Trim off the tops of the celery about one-third of  their length, and also trim the roots into rounding shape. Save the tops  for making cream of celery and for garnishes, cook the celery in salted  water until tender, drain, lay on toast, and pour a cream sauce over.      ~BOSTON BAKED BEANS~--Pick over a quart of small pea beans, wash  thoroughly and soak over night in warm water. In the morning parboil  them until the skins crack open. Pour off the water. Put into the bottom  of a glazed earthenware pot, made expressly for the purpose, a pint of  hot water in which have been dissolved a half tablespoonful salt, two  tablespoonfuls molasses, a half teaspoonful mustard, and a pinch of  soda. Pack in the beans until about a third full, then place in it a  pound (or less, if preferred) of streaked pig pork, the skin of which  has been scored. Cover with a layer of beans, letting the rind of the  pork just show through. Now add enough more seasoned hot water to cover  the beans, and bake covered in a slow oven all day or night. When done  the beans should be soft, tender and moist but brown and whole, and the  pork cooked to a jelly.      ~BREADED POTATO BALLS~--Pare, boil and mash potatoes and whip into three  cups of potato three level tablespoons of butter, two tablespoons of hot  milk, salt and pepper to taste; also two teaspoons of onion juice and  two level tablespoons of chopped parsley, one-quarter cup of grated mild  cheese and two well-beaten eggs. Beat well and set aside to cool. Mold  into small balls, roll each in beaten egg, in fine stale breadcrumbs,  and then fry in deep hot fat.      ~CABBAGE AND CHEESE~--Boil the cabbage in two waters, then drain, cool  and chop. Season well with salt and pepper and spread a layer in a  buttered baking dish. Pour over this a white sauce made from a  tablespoonful each of flour and butter and a cup of milk. Add two or  three tablespoonfuls of finely broken cheese. Now add another layer of  cabbage, then more of the white sauce and cheese, and so on until all  the material is used. Sprinkle with fine crumbs, bake covered about half  an hour, then uncover and brown.      ~CAULIFLOWER AU GRATIN~--Select a firm, well-shaped cauliflower, and  after the preliminary soaking in cold salt water throw into a kettle of  boiling water and cook half an hour, until tender. Drain, pick off the  flowers and lay to one side, while you pick the stalks into small  pieces. Lay on the bottom of a rather shallow buttered baking dish,  sprinkle with pepper, grated cheese and cracker crumbs. Dot with pieces  of butter. Add a little milk, then a layer of the flowerets and another  sprinkling of milk, cheese and pepper.      ~CAULIFLOWER FRITTERS~--Soak and boil the cauliflower in the usual way,  then separate into flowers. Dip each piece into a thin batter, plunge  into boiling fat and fry a delicate brown. Serve very hot on napkins. If  preferred, the pieces may be dipped into a mixture of salt, pepper,  vinegar and oil, then fried.      ~CREAMED SPAGHETTI~--Have two quarts of water boiling in a kettle and  one-third of a pound of spaghetti. Hold a few pieces of the spaghetti at  a time in the water and as the ends soften turn them round and round and  down into the kettle. When all are in the water put on a cover and cook  the spaghetti twenty minutes, then drain.    Make a cream sauce with a rounding tablespoon each of flour and butter  and one cup of cream. Season with one-half teaspoon of salt and a few  grains of pepper. Stir in the spaghetti cut in inch pieces, turn on to a  dish, and sprinkle with finely grated cheese.      ~FRIED"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18440"],[0,"Logic: Deductive and Inductive (#14)"],[1," the quantity of predicates by predesignation,  thus: 'Some men are _some_ wise (beings)'; 'some men are not _any_ brave  (beings)'; etc. This is called the Quantification of the Predicate,  and leads to some modifications of Deductive Logic which will be  referred to hereafter. (See Sec. 3; chap. vii. Sec. 4, and chap. viii. Sec. 3.)    Sec. 2. As to Quality, Propositions are either Affirmative or Negative. An  Affirmative Proposition is, formally, one whose copula is affirmative  (or, has no negative sign), as _S--is--P, All men--are--partial to  themselves_. A Negative Proposition is one whose copula is negative (or,  has a negative sign), as _S--is not--P, Some men--are not--proof against  flattery_. When, indeed, a Negative Proposition is of Universal  Quantity, it is stated thus: _No S is P, No men are proof against  flattery_; but, in this case, the detachment of the negative sign from  the copula and its association with the subject is merely an accident of  our idiom; the proposition is the same as _All men--are not--proof  against flattery_. It must be distinguished, therefore, from such an  expression as _Not every man is proof against flattery_; for here the  negative sign really restricts the subject; so that the meaning  is--_Some men at most_ (it may be _none) are proof against flattery_;  and thus the proposition is Particular, and is rendered--_Some men--are  not--proof against flattery_.    When the negative sign is associated with the predicate, so as to make  this an Infinite Term (chap. iv. Sec. 8), the proposition is called an  Infinite Proposition, as _S is not-P_ (or _p), All men are--incapable of  resisting flattery_, or _are--not-proof against flattery_.    Infinite propositions, when the copula is affirmative, are formally,  themselves affirmative, although their force is chiefly negative; for,  as the last example shows, the difference between an infinite and a  negative proposition may depend upon a hyphen. It has been proposed,  indeed, with a view to superficial simplification, to turn all  Negatives into Infinites, and thus render all propositions Affirmative  in Quality. But although every proposition both affirms and denies  something according to the aspect in which you regard it (as _Snow is  white_ denies that it is any other colour, and _Snow is not blue_  affirms that it is some other colour), yet there is a great difference  between the definite affirmation of a genuine affirmative and the vague  affirmation of a negative or infinite; so that materially an affirmative  infinite is the same as a negative.    Generally Mill's remark is true, that affirmation and denial stand for  distinctions of fact that cannot be got rid of by manipulation of words.  Whether granite sinks in water, or not; whether the rook lives a hundred  years, or not; whether a man has a hundred dollars in his pocket, or  not; whether human bones have ever been found in Pliocene strata, or  not; such alternatives require distinct forms of expression. At the same  time, it may be granted that many facts admit of being stated with  nearly equal propriety in either Quality, as _No man is proof against  flattery_, or _All men are open to flattery_.    But whatever advantage there is in occasionally changing the Quality of  a proposition may be gained by the process of Obversion (chap. vii. Sec.  5); whilst to use only one Quality would impair the elasticity of  logical expression. It is a postulate of Logic that the negative sign  may be transferred from the copula to the predicate, or from the  predicate to the copula, without altering the sense of a proposition;  and this is justified by the experience that not to have an attribute  and to be without it are the same thing.    Sec. 3. A. I. E. O.--Combining the two kinds of Quantity, Universal and  Particular, with the two kinds of Quality, Affirmative and Negative, we  get four simple types of proposition, which it is usual to symbolise by  the letters A. I. E. O., thus:    A.   Universal Affirmative   -- All S is P.  I.   Particular Affirmative  -- Some S is P.  E.   Universal Negative      -- No S is P.  O.   Particular Negative     -- Some S is not P.    As an aid to the remembering of these symbols we may observe that A. and  I. are the first two vowels in _affirmo_ and that E. and O. are the  vowels in _nego_.    It must be acknowledged that these four kinds of proposition recognised  by Formal Logic constitute a very meagre selection from the list of  propositions actually used in judgment and reasoning.    Those Logicians who explicitly quantify the predicate obtain, in all,  eight forms of proposition according to Quantity and Quality:    [Transcriber's Note: The Greek characters used in the original are  represented below by the name of the character in square brackets.]    U.   Toto-total Affirmative      -- All X is all Y.  A.   Toto-partial Affirmative    -- All X is some Y.  Y.   Parti-total Affirmative     -- Some X is all Y.  I.   Parti-partial Affirmative   -- Some X is some Y.  E.   Toto-total Negative         -- No X is any Y.  [eta].   Toto-partial Negative       -- No X is some Y.  O.   Parti-total Negative        -- Some X is not any Y.  [omega].   Parti-partial Negative      -- Some X is not some Y.    Here A. I. E. O. correspond with those similarly symbolised in the usual  list, merely designating in the predicates the quantity which was  formerly treated as implicit.    Sec. 4. As to Relation, propositions are either Categorical or Conditional.  A Categorical Proposition is one in which the predicate is directly  affirmed or denied of the subject without any limitation of time, place,  or circumstance, extraneous to the subject, as _All men in England are  secure of justice_; in which proposition, though there is a limitation  of place ('in England'), it is included in the subject. Of this kind are  nearly all the examples that have yet been given, according to the form  _S is P_.    A Conditional Proposition is so called because the predication is made  under some limitation or condition not included in the subject, as _If a  man live in England, he is secure of justice_. Here the limitation  'living in England' is put into a conditional sentence extraneous to the  subject, 'he,' representing any man.    Conditional propositions, again, are of two kinds--Hypothetical and  Disjunctive. Hypothetical propositions are those that are limited by an  explicit conditional sentence, as above, or thus: _If Joe Smith was a  prophet, his followers have been unjustly persecuted_. Or in symbols  thus:        If A is, B is;      If A is B, A is C;      If A is B, C is D.    Disjunctive propositions are those in which the condition under which  predication is made is not explicit but only implied under the disguise  of an alternative proposition, as _Joe Smith was either a prophet or an  impostor_. Here there is no direct predication concerning Joe Smith, but  only a predication of one of the alternatives conditionally on the other  being denied, as, _If Joe Smith was not a prophet he was an impostor_;  or, _If he was not an impostor, he was a prophet_. Symbolically,  Disjunctives may be represented thus:        A is either B or C,      Either A is B or C is D.    Formally, every Conditional may be expressed as a Categorical. For our  last example shows how a Disjunctive may be reduced to two Hypotheticals  (of which one is redundant, being the contrapositive of the other; see  chap. vii. Sec. 10). And a Hypothetical is reducible to a Categorical thus:  _If the sky is clear, the night is cold_ may be read--_The case of the  sky being clear is a case of the night being cold_; and this, though a  clumsy plan, is sometimes convenient. It would be better to say _The sky  being clear is a sign of the night being cold_, or a condition of it.  For, as Mill says, the essence of a Hypothetical is to state that one  clause of it (the indicative) may be inferred from the other (the  conditional). Similarly, we might write: _Proof of Joe Smith's not being  a prophet is a proof of his being an impostor_.    This turning of Conditionals into Categoricals is called a Change of  Relation; and the process may be reversed: _All the wise are virtuous_  may be written, _If any man is wise he is virtuous_; or, again, _Either  a man is not-wise or he is virtuous_. But the categorical form is  usually the simplest.    If, then, as substitutes for the corresponding conditionals,  categoricals are formally adequate, though sometimes inelegant, it may  be urged that Logic has nothing to do with elegance; or that, at any  rate, the chief elegance of science is economy, and that therefore, for  scientific purposes, whatever we may write further about conditionals  must be an ugly excrescence. The scientific purpose of Logic is to  assign the conditions of proof. Can we, then, in the conditional form  prove anything that cannot be proved in the categorical? Or does a  conditional require to be itself proved by any method not applicable to  the Categorical? If not, why go on with the discussion of Conditionals?  For all laws of Nature, however stated, are essentially categorical. 'If  a straight line falls on another straight line, the adjacent angles are  together equal to two right angles'; 'If a body is unsupported, it  falls'; 'If population increases, rents tend to rise': here 'if' means  'whenever' or 'all cases in which'; for to raise a doubt whether a  straight line is ever conceived to fall upon another, whether bodies are  ever unsupported, or population ever increases, is a superfluity of  scepticism; and plainly the hypothetical form has nothing to do with the  proof of such propositions, nor with inference from them.    Still, the disjunctive form is necessary in setting out the relation of  contradictory terms, and in stating a Division (chap. xxi.), whether  formal (_as A is B or not-B_) or material (as _Cats are white, or black,  or tortoiseshell, or"]]]
