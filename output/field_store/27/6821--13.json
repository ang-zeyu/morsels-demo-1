Before starting, they were allowed to  go to their homes and see their families, but they were not permitted to  speak to them. Their wives and children clung to them, crying in their  despair, and were only separated by the cruel swords of the guards.    Fifty-six of the leading brethren were now taken prisoners and sent to the  town of Richmond. Most of them were released shortly after.    On November 6th General Clark made his famous speech to the Saints in Far  West, wherein he told them that he had come to carry out the governor's  orders to destroy them, but he would be lenient and give them a little time  to get out of the state. He advised the Saints to be like other people and  not organize themselves with bishops, presidents, etc. It was a very  foolish, conceited speech.    About twenty-five miles north of Far West was a beautiful settlement of  the Saints. Joseph said it was the place where our father Adam had blessed  his children, and where he will come again to visit his people. So the  place was called Adam-ondi-Ahman. The people here had suffered with the  rest of the Saints, and now in the cold month of November they were driven  from their homes and took refuge for the winter in Far West.    During that hard winter and time of trial when Joseph and many of his  brethren were in prison and many others had apostatized, one name comes to  the front as that of a faithful man. It is Brigham Young. He was ever true  to the Prophet, and Joseph could rely on him. With him were such noble men  as Heber C. Kimball, John Taylor, and many others. Brigham was now  president of the Twelve, and it was his duty to take the lead in looking  after the affairs of the Church during the absence of the First Presidency.    In January, 1839, Brigham Young called a meeting to consider what should be  done in aiding the poor Saints to remove from Missouri. President Young  presented a resolution that the brethren should never desert the poor  Saints, but that they should help them to escape from their persecutors. A  great many brethren agreed to this, and that winter and spring the move  eastward to Illinois continued. They did not travel in large bodies, but in  small companies as they got ready. Not one family who wished to go was left  behind.    The sufferings of that winter journey cannot be told you here. Many died on  the way through exposure and hardships. The mobs would not let them alone  even when they were leaving as fast as they could. Mobs often rode into Far  West, abused the people, stole horses, drove off cattle and took anything  that pleased them. The Saints traded their farms for horses and wagons in  which to get away. Sometimes fine farms were nearly given away. It is told  of one brother that he sold forty acres of good land for a blind mare and a  clock.    July 8, 1838, the Lord gave a revelation wherein he called the Twelve  Apostles to go on a mission to England. The Twelve were to take leave of  the Saints at the temple site in Far West, April 26, 1839. (Doc. and Cov.,  Sec. 118.) This time had now come, but it seemed impossible that it could  be carried out, as most of the Saints had left Far West and the mobbers  swore that this was a revelation that should not be fulfilled. They would  kill the first Apostle that came into the place, they said.    However, seven of the Twelve arrived at Far West the night before the 26th,  and early next morning they went to the temple lot, rolled a large stone to  the southeast corner of the temple grounds as a foundation, and then  proceeded to hold a meeting. Elders Wilford Woodruff and George A. Smith  were then ordained Apostles, the brethren prayed and sang and then  dismissed the meeting, bidding good-bye to the eighteen Saints present. Not  a mobber was astir that morning, and the word of the Lord was again  fulfilled.    Topics.--1. Governor Boggs' exterminating order. 2. Betrayal of Joseph  and his brethren. 3.

From Far West Joseph and his brethren who had been taken prisoners were  marched towards Jackson county. At first General Wilson who had them in  charge treated the brethren badly, but as they proceeded on their journey  he became quite friendly, and told the prisoners that he was just going to  show the people of Independence what a \"set of fine fellows you are.\"    While on the march the Lord comforted Joseph, and he spoke to the other  prisoners as follows: \"Be of good cheer, brethren; the word of the Lord  came to me last night that our lives should be given us, and that whatever  we may suffer during this captivity, not one of our lives shall be taken.\"    After they had crossed the Missouri river into Jackson county, many people  came to see these wonders, the \"Mormons.\" One lady came up and asked the  guards which of the prisoners the \"Mormons\" worshiped. Joseph was pointed  out to her. She then asked the Prophet if he professed to be the Lord and  Savior. Joseph said he was only a man sent by Jesus Christ to preach the  gospel. Quite a crowd had gathered around, and Joseph went on explaining  the principles of faith, repentance, etc. Thus Joseph preached a sermon in  Jackson county in fulfillment of a prediction he had made some months  before.    At Independence their treatment was not bad. The people seemed curious to  see them, and the brethren spent their time in talking with people who came  to them.    General Clark, who also wanted some of the \"honor\" of having these noted  prisoners, now ordered them to Richmond, in Ray county, where the general  had a talk with them. Shortly after this, some guards came into the jail  house and fastened the seven prisoners together by means of a chain and  pad-locks. In this way they lived in a room without chairs or beds,  sleeping on the hard, cold floor at nights. Guards with loaded guns stood  watch over them, and talked to each other of the wicked deeds they had done  at Far West and other places near by. About these horrible acts they  boasted in glee while the prisoners had to lie and hear it all.    One night, says P.P. Pratt, he lay next to Joseph, listening to all this  vile talk, when suddenly Joseph arose to his feet and spoke in a voice of  thunder, or as the roaring lion, these words:    \"'_Silence! ye fiends of the infernal pit! In the name of Jesus Christ I  rebuke you, and command you to be still. I will not live another minute and  hear such language. Cease your talk, or you or I die this minute_'    \"He ceased to speak. He stood erect in terrible majesty, chained and  without a weapon; calm, unruffled, and dignified as an angel, he looked  down upon the quailing guards, whose weapons dropped to the ground, whose  knees smote together.\" The ruffians instantly became still, and were very  glad when a change of guard came so that they could get away.    General Clark tried hard to find some law by which he could have Joseph  tried by an army court, but he failed in this and therefore he handed the  prisoners over to the civil authorities.    Another farce of a trial was now had. About forty men, mostly apostates,  testified against the prisoners. The brethren had no witnesses, and when  the mobber Bogart was sent to Far West for some, he simply arrested them  and put them in prison. The result of the hearing was that Joseph Smith,  Hyrum Smith, Sidney Rigdon, Lyman Wight, Alexander McRae, and Caleb Baldwin  were sent to Liberty, Clay county, to jail. Parley P. Pratt and others were  to remain in Richmond jail, while some others were released.    Joseph with his fellow-prisoners remained in Liberty jail from November 28,  1838, to April 6, 1839. During all this time they suffered the hardships of  prison life, together with abuses not usually imposed on common prisoners.  It is claimed by some that they were offered human flesh to eat. During  this time of trial Joseph was cheerful and told the brethren they would get  out safe. He wrote many letters of instruction to the Saints, bidding them  to be faithful to their religion. The brethren who were at liberty were not  idle. They were appealing continually to the judges and the governor for  justice for their brethren, but it was of little use. At one hearing,  Sidney Rigdon was released but he had to go back to jail for a time because  the mob threatened to kill him.    Seeing that it was useless trying to be released lawfully the brethren  decided to try to escape. The evening of February 7, 1839, when the guard  should come with their supper, was fixed as the time to try; but Hyrum  wanted to be sure about the matter so he asked Joseph to enquire of the  Lord if it was wisdom for them to make the attempt. Joseph did so and was  informed that if they were all united they would be able to escape that  evening. Therefore all but Lyman Wight agreed to the plan. He wanted to  wait till the next day, and as the brethren would not go without him, they  decided to wait.    That evening the guard left the door wide open and gave them a good chance  to escape, but they did not try. The next evening the jailor brought a  double guard with him, and six of the brethren came to see the prisoners.  Though it was a very poor chance to escape, they meant to try.

In the mean time, the Danes, far from being subdued by the adverse  turn of fortune which had befallen them, strengthened themselves in  their fortress, made desperate sallies from their intrenchments,  attacked their foes on every possible occasion, and kept the country  in continual alarm. They at length so far recruited their strength,  and intimidated and discouraged their foes, whose king and nominal  leader, Ethelred, was now less able than ever to resist them, as to  take the field again. They fought more pitched battles; and, though  the Saxon chroniclers who narrate these events are very reluctant to  admit that the Saxons were really vanquished in these struggles, they  allow that the Danes kept the ground which they successively took post  upon, and the discouraged and disheartened inhabitants of the country  were forced to retire.    In the mean time, too, new parties of Danes were continually arriving  on the coast, and spreading themselves in marauding and plundering  excursions over the country. The Danes at Reading were re-enforced  by these bands, which made the conflict between them and Ethelred's  forces more unequal still. Alfred did his utmost to resist the tide of  ill fortune, with the limited and doubtful authority which he held;  but all was in vain. Ethelred, worn down, probably, with the anxiety  and depression which the situation of his kingdom brought upon him,  lingered for a time, and then died, and Alfred was by general consent  called to the throne. This was in the year 871.    It was a matter of moment to find a safe and secure place of deposit  for the body of Ethelred, who, as a Christian slain in contending with  pagans, was to be considered a martyr. His memory was honored as that  of one who had sacrificed his life in defense of the Christian faith.  They knew very well that even his lifeless remains would not be safe  from the vengeance of his foes unless they were placed effectually  beyond the reach of these desperate marauders. There was, far to the  south, in Dorsetshire, on the southern coast of England, a monastery,  at Wimborne, a very sacred spot, worthy to be selected as a place of  royal sepulture. The spot has continued sacred to the present day; and  it has now upon the site, as is supposed, of the ancient monastery, a  grand cathedral church or minster, full of monuments of former days,  and impressing all beholders with its solemn architectural grandeur.  Here they conveyed the body of Ethelred and interred it. It was a  place of sacred seclusion, where there reigned a solemn stillness and  awe, which no _Christian_ hostility would ever have dared to disturb.  The sacrilegious paganism of the Danes, however, would have respected  it but little, if they had ever found access to it; but they did  not. The body of Ethelred remained undisturbed; and, many centuries  afterward, some travelers who visited the spot recorded the fact that  there was a monument there with this inscription:    \"IN HOC LOCO QUIESC'T CORPUS ETHELREDI REGIS WEST SAXONUM, MARTYRIS,  QUI ANNO DOMINI DCCCLXXI., XXIII. APRILIS, PER MANUS DANORUM  PAGANORUM, OCCUBUIT.\"[1]    Such is the commonly received opinion of the death of Ethelred. And  yet some of the critical historians of modern times, who find cause to  doubt or disbelieve a very large portion of what is stated in ancient  records, attempt to prove that Ethelred was not killed by the Danes  at all, but that he died of the plague, which terrible disease was at  that time prevailing in that part of England. At all events, he died,  and Alfred, his brother, was called to reign in his stead.    [Footnote 1: \"Here rests the body of Ethelred, king of West Saxony,  the Martyr, who died by the hands of the pagan Danes, in the year of  our Lord 871.\"]          CHAPTER VII.    REVERSES.      The historians say that Alfred was very unwilling to assume the crown  when the death of Ethelred presented it to him. If it had been an  object of ambition or desire, there would probably have been a rival  claimant, whose right would perhaps have proved superior to his own,  since it appears that one or more of the brothers who reigned before  him left a son, whose claim to the inheritance, if the inheritance  had been worth claiming, would have been stronger than that of their  uncle. The _son_ of the oldest son takes precedence always of the  _brother_, for hereditary rights, like water, never move laterally so  long as they can continue to descend.    The nobles, however, and chieftains, and all the leading powers of the  kingdom of Wessex, which was the particular kingdom which descended  from Alfred's ancestors, united to urge Alfred to take the throne. His  father had, indeed, designated him as the successor of his brothers by  his will, though how far a monarch may properly control by his will  the disposal of his realm, is a matter of great uncertainty. Alfred  yielded at length to these solicitations, and determined on assuming  the sovereign power. He first went to Wimborne to attend to the  funeral solemnities which were to be observed at his royal brother's  burial. He then went to Winchester, which, as well as Wimborne, is in  the south of England, to be crowned and anointed king. Winchester was,  even in those early days, a great ecclesiastical center. It was for  some time the capital of the West Saxon realm. It was a very sacred  place, and the crown was there placed upon Alfred's head, with the  most imposing and solemn ceremonies. It is a curious and remarkable  fact, that the spots which were consecrated in those early days by the  religious establishments of the times, have preserved in almost every  case their sacredness to the present day. Winchester is now famed all  over England for its great Cathedral church, and the vast religious  establishment which has its seat there--the annual revenues and  expenditures of which far exceed those of many of the states of this  Union. The income of the bishop alone was for many years double that  of the salary of the President of the United States. The Bishop of  Winchester is widely celebrated, therefore, all over England, for his  wealth, his ecclesiastical power, the architectural grandeur of the  Cathedral church, and the wealth and importance of the college of  ecclesiastics over which he presides.    [Illustration: CORONATION CHAIR.]    It was in Winchester that Alfred was crowned. As soon as the ceremony  was performed, he took the field, collected his forces, and went  to meet the Danes again. He found the country in a most deplorable  condition. The Danes had extended and strengthened their positions.  They had got possession of many of the towns, and, not content with  plundering castles and abbeys, they had seized lands, and were  beginning to settle upon them, as if they intended to make Alfred's  new kingdom their permanent abode. The forces of the Saxons, on the  other hand, were scattered and discouraged. There seemed no hope left  to them of making head against their pestiferous invaders. If they  were defeated, their cruel conquerors showed no moderation and no  mercy in their victory; and if they conquered, it was only to suppress  for a moment one horde, with a certainty of being attacked immediately  by another, more recently arrived, and more determined and relentless  than those before them.    Alfred succeeded, however, by means of the influence of his personal  character, and by the very active and efficient exertions that he  made, in concentrating what forces remained, and in preparing for a  renewal of the contest. The first great battle that was fought was at  Wilton. This was within a month of his accession to the throne. The  battle was very obstinately fought; at the first onset Alfred's troops  carried all before them, and there was every prospect that he would  win the day. In the end, however, the tide of victory turned in favor  of the Danes, and Alfred and his troops were driven from the field.  There was an immense loss on both sides. In fact, both armies were,  for the time, pretty effectually disabled, and each seems to have  shrunk from a renewal of the contest. Instead, therefore, of fighting  again, the two commanders entered into negotiations. Hubba was the  name of the Danish chieftain. In the end, he made a treaty with  Alfred, by which he agreed to retire from Alfred's dominions, and  leave him in peace, provided that Alfred would not interfere with him  in his wars in any other part of England. Alfred's kingdom was Wessex.  Besides Wessex, there was Essex, Mercia, and Northumberland. Hubba and  his Danes, finding that Alfred was likely to prove too formidable an  antagonist for them easily to subdue, thought it would be most prudent  to give up one kingdom out of the four, on condition of not having  Alfred to contend against in their depredations upon the other three.  They accordingly made the treaty, and the Danes withdrew. They  evacuated their posts and strong-holds in Wessex, and went down the  Thames to London, which was in Mercia, and there commenced a new  course of conquest and plunder, where they had no such powerful foe to  oppose them.    Buthred was the king of Mercia. He could not resist Hubba and his  Danes alone, and he could not now have Alfred's assistance. Alfred was  censured very much at the time, and has been condemned often since,  for having thus made a separate peace for himself and his own  immediate dominions, and abandoned his natural allies and friends, the  people of the other Saxon kingdoms. To make a peace with savage  and relentless pagans, on the express condition of leaving his  fellow-Christian neighbors at their mercy, has been considered  ungenerous, at least, if it was not unjust. On the other hand, those  who vindicate his conduct maintain that it was his duty to secure the  peace and welfare of his own realm, leaving other sovereigns to take "]]]
