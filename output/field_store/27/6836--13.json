CHAPTER 12    Ralph Entereth Into the Burg of the Four Friths      When they came up to the wall they saw that it was well builded of good  ashlar, and so high that they might not see the roofs of the town  because of it; but there were tall towers on it, a many of them, strong  and white.  The road led up straight to the master-gate of the Burg,  and there was a bailey before it strongly walled, and manned with  weaponed men, and a captain going about amongst them.  But they entered  it along with men bringing wares into the town, and none heeded them  much, till they came to the very gate, on the further side of a moat  that was both deep and clean; but as now the bridge was down and the  portcullis up, so that the market-people might pass in easily, for it  was yet early in the day.  But before the door on either side stood  men-at-arms well weaponed, and on the right side was their captain, a  tall man with bare grizzled head, but otherwise all-armed, who stopped  every one whom he knew not, and asked their business.    As Ralph came riding up with Roger beside him, one of the guard laid  his spear across and bade them stand, and the captain spake in a dry  cold voice: \"Whence comest thou, man-at-arms?\" \"From the Abbey of St.  Mary at Higham,\" said Ralph.  \"Yea,\" said the captain, smiling grimly,  \"even so I might have deemed:  thou wilt be one of the Lord Abbot's  lily lads.\" \"No I am not,\" quoth Ralph angrily.  \"Well, well,\" said the  captain, \"what is thy name?\"    \"Ralph Motherson,\" quoth Ralph, knitting his brow.  Said the captain  \"And whither wilt thou?\"  Said Ralph, \"On mine own errands.\" \"Thou  answerest not over freely,\" quoth the captain.  Said Ralph, \"Then is it  even; for thou askest freely enough.\" \"Well, well,\" said the captain,  grinning in no unfriendly wise, \"thou seemest a stout lad enough; and  as to my asking, it is my craft as captain of the North Gate:  but now  tell me friendly, goest thou to any kinsman or friend in the Burg?\"    Then Ralph's brow cleared and he said, \"Nay, fair sir.\" \"Well then,\"  said the captain, \"art thou but riding straight through to another  gate, and so away again?\"  \"Nay,\" said Ralph, \"if I may, I would abide  here the night over, or may-happen longer.\" \"Therein thou shalt do  well, young man,\" said the captain; \"then I suppose thou wilt to some  hostelry? tell me which one.\"    Said Ralph, \"Nay, I wot not to which one, knowing not the town.\" But  Roger close by him spake and said:  \"My lord shall go to the Flower de  Luce, which is in the big square.\"    \"Truly,\" said the captain, \"he goes to a good harbour; and moreover,  fair sir, to-morrow thou shalt see a goodly sight from thine inn; thou  mayst do no better, lord.  But thou, carle, who art thou, who knowest  the inside of our Burg so well, though I know thee not, for as well as  I know our craftsmen and vavassors?\"    Then Roger's words hung on his lips awhile, and the knight bent his  brow on him, till at last he said, \"Sir Captain, I was minded to lie,  and say that I am this young knight's serving-man.\" The captain broke  in on him grimly, \"Thou wert best not lie.\"    \"Yea, sir,\" quoth Roger, \"I deemed, as it was on my tongue's end, that  thou wouldst find me out, so I have nought to do but tell thee the very  sooth: this it is:  I am a man made masterless by the thieves of the  Dry Tree.  From my land at Hampton under Scaur have I been driven, my  chattels have been lifted, and my friends slain; and therefore by your  leave would I ride in the host of the Burg, that I may pay back the  harm which I had, according to the saw, 'better bale by breeding bale.'  So, lord, I ask thee wilt thou lend me the sword and give me the loaf,  that I may help both thee, and the Burg, and me?\"    The captain looked at him closely and sharply, while the carle faced  him with open simple eyes, and at last he said: \"Well, carle, thou wert  about to name thyself this young knight's serving-man; be thou even so  whiles he abideth in the Burg; and when he leaveth the Burg then come  back to me here any day before noon, and may be I shall then put a  sword in thy fist and horse between thy thighs.  But,\" (and he wagged  his head threateningly at Roger) \"see that thou art at the Flower de  Luce when thou art called for.\"    Roger held his peace and seemed somewhat abashed at this word, and the  captain turned to Ralph and said courteously:  \"Young knight, if thou  art seeking adventures, thou shalt find them in our host; and if thou  be but half as wise as thou seemest bold, thou wilt not fail to gain  honour and wealth both, in the service of the Burg; for we be overmuch  beset with foemen that we should not welcome any wight and wary  warrior, though he be an alien of blood and land.  If thou thinkest  well of this, then send me thy man here and give me word of thy mind,  and I shall lead thee to the chiefs of the Port, and make the way easy  for thee.\"    Ralph thanked him and rode through the gate into the street, and Roger  still went beside his stirrup.    Presently Ralph turned to Roger and spake to him somewhat sourly, and  said:  \"Thou hadst one lie in thy mouth and didst swallow it; but how  shall I know that another did not come out thence?  Withal thou must  needs be my fellow here, will I, nill I; for thou it was that didst put  that word into the captain's mouth that thou shouldst serve me while I  abide in the Burg.  So I will say here and now, that my mind misgives  me concerning thee, whether thou be not of those very thieves and  tyrants whom thou didst mis-say but a little while ago.\"    \"Yea,\" said Roger, \"thou art wise indeed to set me down as one of the  Dry Tree; doubtless that is why I delivered thee from their ambush even  now.  And as for my service, thou mayst need it; for indeed I deem thee  not so safe as thou deemest thyself in this Burg.\"    \"What!\" said Ralph, \"Dost thou blow hot and cold? why even now, when we  were in the wood, thou wert telling me that I had nought at all to fear  in the Burg of the Four Friths, and that all was done there by reason  and with justice.  What is this new thing then which thou hast found  out, or what is that I have to fear?\"    Roger changed countenance thereat and seemed somewhat confused, as one  who has been caught unawares; but he gat his own face presently, and  said:  \"Nay, Sir Knight, I will tell thee the truth right out.  In the  wood yonder thy danger was great that thou mightest run into the hands  of them of the Dry Tree; therefore true it is that I spake somewhat  beyond my warrant concerning the life of the folk of the Burg, as how  could I help it?  But surely whatever thy peril may be here, it is  nought to that which awaited thee at Hampton.\"    \"Nay, but what is the peril?\" said Ralph.  Quoth Roger, \"If thou wilt  become their man and enter into their host, there is none; for they  will ask few questions of so good a man-at-arms, when they know that  thou art theirs; but if thou naysay that, it may well be that they will  be for turning the key on thee till thou tellest them what and whence  thou art.\" Ralph answered nought, thinking in his mind that this was  like enough; so he rode on soberly, till Roger said:    \"Anyhow, thou mayst turn the cold shoulder on me if thou wilt.  Yet  were I thee, I would not, for so it is, both that I can help thee, as I  deem, in time to come, and that I have helped thee somewhat in time  past.\"    Now Ralph was young and could not abide the blame of thanklessness; so  he said, \"Nay, nay, fellow, go we on together to the Flower de Luce.\"    Roger nodded his head and grumbled somewhat, and they made no stay  except that now and again Ralph drew rein to look at goodly things in  the street, for there were many open booths therein, so that the whole  street looked like a market.  The houses were goodly of building, but  not very tall, the ways wide and well-paved. Many folk were in the  street, going up and down on their errands, and both men and women of  them seemed to Ralph stout and strong, but not very fair of favour.  Withal they seemed intent on their business, and payed little heed to  Ralph and his fellow, though he was by his attire plainly a stranger.    Now Ralph sees a house more gaily adorned than most, and a sign hung  out from it whereon was done an image of St. Loy, and underneath the  same a booth on which was set out weapons and war-gear exceeding  goodly; and two knaves of the armourer were standing by to serve folk,  and crying their wares with \"what d'ye lack?\" from time to time.  So he  stayed and fell to looking wistfully at the gleam and glitter of those  fair things, till one of the aforesaid knaves came to his side and said:    \"Fair Sir, surely thou lackest somewhat; what have we here for thy  needs?\"  So Ralph thought and called to mind that strong little steel  axe of the man whom he had slain yesterday, and asked for the sight of  such a weapon, if he might perchance cheapen it.  And the lad brought a  very goodly steel axe, gold-inlaid about the shaft, and gave him the  price thereof, which Ralph deemed he might compass; so he brought round  his scrip to his hand, that he might take out the money.  But while his  hand was yet in the bag, out comes the master-armourer, a tall and very  stark carle, and said in courteous wise: \"Sir Knight, thou art a  stranger to me and I know thee not; so I must needs ask for a sight of  thy license to buy weapons, under the seal of the Burg.\"    \"Hear a wonder,\" said Ralph, \"that a free man for his money shall not  buy wares set out to be bought, unless he have the Burg-Reeve's hand  and seal for it!  Nay, take thy florins, master, and give me the axe  and let the jest end there.\" \"I jest not, young rider,\" quoth the  armourer.  \"When we know"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16921"],[0,"Plague Ship (#14)"],[1,"lost its scent.    They packed the lower hold solid in accordance with the rules of stowage  and locked the hatch before Van Rycke returned from his meeting with the  storm priests. When the Cargo-master came back he was followed by two  servants bearing between them a chest.    But there was something in Van Rycke's attitude, apparent to those who  knew him best, that proclaimed he was not too well pleased with his  morning's work. Sparing the feelings of the accompanying storm priests  about the offensiveness of the spacer Captain Jellico and Steen Wilcox  went out to receive them in the open. Dane watched from the hatch, aware  that in his present pariah-hood it would not be wise to venture closer.    The Terran Traders were protesting some course of action that the  Salariki were firmly insistent upon. In the end the natives won and Kosti  was summoned to carry on board the chest which the servants had brought.  Having seen it carried safely inside the spacer, the aliens departed,  but Van Rycke was frowning and Jellico's fingers were beating a tattoo on  his belt as they came up the ramp.    \"I don't like it,\" Jellico stated as he entered.    \"It was none of my doing,\" Van Rycke snapped. \"I'll take risks if I have  to--but there's something about this one--\" he broke off, two deep lines  showing between his thick brows. \"Well, you can't teach a sasseral to  spit,\" he ended philosophically. \"We'll have to do the best we can.\"    But Jellico did not look at all happy as he climbed to the control  section. And before the hour was out the reason for the Captain's  uneasiness was common property throughout the ship.    Having sampled the delights of off-world herbs, the Salariki were  determined to not be cut off from their source of supply. Six Terran  months from the present Sargolian date would come the great yearly feast  of the Fifty Storms, and the priests were agreed that this year their  influence and power would be doubled if they could offer the devout  certain privileges in the form of Terran plants. Consequently they had  produced and forced upon the reluctant Van Rycke the Koros collection of  their order, with instructions that it be sold on Terra and the price  returned to them in the precious seeds and plants. In vain the  Cargo-master and Captain had pointed out that Galactic trade was a chancy  thing at the best, that accident might prevent return of the Queen to  Sargol. But the priests had remained adamant and saw in all such  arguments only a devious attempt to raise prices. They quoted in their  turn the information they had levered out of the Company men--that  Traders had their code and that once pay had been given in advance the  contract _must_ be fulfilled. They, and they alone, wanted the full cargo  of the Queen on her next voyage, and they were taking the one way they  were sure of achieving that result.    So a fortune in Koros stones which as yet did not rightfully belong to  the Traders was now in the Queen's strong-room and her crew were pledged  by the strongest possible tie known in their Service to set down on  Sargol once more before the allotted time had passed. The Free Traders  did not like it, there was even a vaguely superstitious feeling that such  a bargain would inevitably draw ill luck to them. But they were left with  no choice if they wanted to retain their influence with the Salariki.    \"Cutting orbit pretty fine, aren't we?\" Ali asked Rip across the mess  table. \"I saw your two star man sweating it out before he came down to  shoot the breeze with us rocket monkeys--\"    Rip nodded. \"Steen's double checked every computation and some he's done  four times.\" He ran his hands over his close cropped head with a weary  gesture. As a semi-invalid he had been herded down with his fellows to  swallow the builder Mura had concocted and Tau insisted that they take,  but he had been doing a half a night's work on the plotter under his  chief's exacting eye before he came. \"The latest news is that, barring  accident, we can make it with about three weeks' grace, give or take a  day or two--\"    \"Barring accident--\" the words rang in the air. Here on the frontiers of  the star lanes there were so many accidents, so many delays which could  put a ship behind schedule. Only on the main star trails did the huge  liners or Company ships attempt to keep on regularly timed trips. A Free  Trader did not really dare to have an inelastic contract.    \"What does Stotz say?\" Dane asked Ali.    \"He says he can deliver. We don't have the headache about setting a  course--you point the nose and we only give her the boost to send her  along.\"    Rip sighed. \"Yes--point her nose.\" He inspected his nails. \"Goodbye,\" he  added gravely. \"These won't be here by the time we planet here again.  I'll have my fingers gnawed off to the first knuckle. Well, we lift at  six hours. Pleasant strap down.\" He drank the last of the stuff in his  mug, made a face at the flavor, and got to his feet, due back at his post  in control.    Dane, free of duty until the ship earthed, drifted back to his own cabin,  sure of part of a night's undisturbed rest before they blasted off.  Sinbad was curled on his bunk. For some reason the cat had not been  prowling the ship before take-off as he usually did. First he had sat on  Van's desk and now he was here, almost as if he wanted human company.  Dane picked him up and Sinbad rumbled a purr, arching his head so that it  rubbed against the young man's chin in an extremely uncharacteristic show  of affection. Smoothing the fur along the cat's jaw line Dane carried him  back to the Cargo-master's cabin.    With some hesitation he knocked at the panel and did not step in until he  had Van Rycke's muffled invitation. The Cargo-master was stretched on the  bunk, two of the take off straps already fastened across his bulk as if  he intended to sleep through the blast-off.    \"Sinbad, sir. Shall I stow him?\"    Van Rycke grunted an assent and Dane dropped the cat in the small hammock  which was his particular station, fastening the safety cords. For once  Sinbad made no protest but rolled into a ball and was promptly fast  asleep. For a moment or two Dane thought about this unnatural behavior  and wondered if he should call it to the Cargo-master's attention.  Perhaps on Sargol Sinbad had had _his_ equivalent of a friendship cup  and needed a check-up by Tau.    \"Stowage correct?\" the question, coming from Van Rycke, was also unusual.  The seal would not have been put across the hold lock had its contents  not been checked and rechecked.    \"Yes, sir,\" Dane replied woodenly, knowing he was still in the outer  darkness. \"There was just the wood--we stowed it according to chart.\"    Van Rycke grunted once more. \"Feeling top-layer again?\"    \"Yes, sir. Any orders, sir?\"    \"No. Blast-off's at six.\"    \"Yes, sir.\" Dane left the cabin, closing the panel carefully behind him.  Would he--or could he--he thought drearily, get back in Van Rycke's  profit column again? Sargol had been unlucky as far as he was concerned.  First he had made that stupid mistake and then he got sick and now--And  now--what _was_ the matter? Was it just the general attack of nerves over  their voyage and the commitments which forced their haste, or was it  something else? He could not rid himself of a vague sense that the Queen  was about to take off into real trouble. And he did not like the  sensation at all!          Chapter VIII    HEADACHES      They lifted from Sargol on schedule and went into Hyper also on schedule.  From that point on there was nothing to do but wait out the usual dull  time of flight between systems and hope that Steen Wilcox had plotted a  course which would cut that flight time to a minimum. But this voyage  there was little relaxation once they were in Hyper. No matter when Dane  dropped into the mess cabin, which was the common meeting place of the  spacer, he was apt to find others there before him, usually with a mug of  one of Mura's special brews close at hand, speculating about their  landing date.    Dane, himself, once he had thrown off the lingering effects of his  Sargolian illness, applied time to his studies. When he had first joined  the Queen as a recruit straight out of the training Pool, he had speedily  learned that all the ten years of intensive study then behind him had  only been an introduction to the amount he still had to absorb before he  could take his place as an equal with such a trader as Van Rycke--if he  had the stuff which would raise him in time to that exalted level. While  he had still had his superior's favor he had dared to treat him as an  instructor, going to him with perplexing problems of stowage or barter.  But now he had no desire to intrude upon the Cargo-master, and doggedly  wrestled with the microtapes of old records on his own, painfully  working out the why and wherefor for any departure from the regular  procedure. He had no inkling of his own future status--whether the return  to Terra would find him permanently earthed. And he would ask no  questions.    They had been four days of ship's time in Hyper when Dane walked into the  mess cabin, tired after his work with old records, to discover no Mura  busy in the galley beyond, no brew steaming on the heat coil. Rip sat at  the table, his long legs stuck out, his usually happy face very sober.    \"What's wrong?\" Dane reached for a mug, then seeing no pot of drink, put  it back in place.    \"Frank's sick--\"    \"What!\" Dane turned. Illness such as they had run into on Sargol had a  logical base. But illness on board ship was something else.    \"Tau has him isolated. He has a bad headache and he blacked out when he  tried to sit up. Tau's running tests.\"    Dane sat down. \"Could be something he ate--\"    Rip shook his head. \"He wasn't at the feast--remember? And he didn't eat  anything from outside, he swore that to Tau. In fact he didn't go dirt  much while we were down--\"  "]]]
