To the Brahmans  especially his condemnation, both implied and explicit, of the caste  system was a constant stone of offence.    Great as was his genius and admirable as were many of his institutions,  Akbar, to use a homely phrase, fell between two stools to the ground. He  himself ceased to be a Mahomedan without becoming a Hindu, whilst the  great bulk at least of his subjects still remained at bottom Mahomedans  and Hindus as before. Neither community was ripe for an eclectic creed  based only upon sweet reasonableness and lofty ethical conceptions. His  son and successor, Jehanghir, at once reverted to Mahomedan orthodoxy,  but the reaction only became militant when Aurungzeb succeeded Shah  Jehan. The profound incompatibility between Islam and Hinduism  reasserted itself in him with a bitterness which the growing menace of  the rising power of the Hindu Mahrattas probably helped to intensify.  The reimposition of the poll-tax on the Hindus destroyed the last  vestige of the great work of conciliation to which Akbar had vainly  applied all his brilliant energies. Like Fatehpur Sikri itself, which  for lack of water he had been compelled to abandon within fifteen years  of its construction, it was a magnificent failure, and it was perhaps  bound in his time to be a failure.    Aurungzeb was the first of the Moghuls to reside in the Mahomedan  atmosphere of Delhi throughout his long reign. But, begun in usurpation  at the cost of his own father, it ended in misery and gloom. His sons  had revolted against him, his sombre fanaticism had estranged from him  the Rajput princes of whom Akbar had made the pillars of the Moghul  throne, and though he had reduced to subjection the last of the  independent Mahomedan kingdoms of India, he had exhausted his vast  military resources in long and fruitless endeavours to arrest the growth  of the new Mahratta power, to which Shivaji had not unsuccessfully  attempted to rally the spiritual forces of disaffected Hinduism. In the  incapable hands of Aurungzeb's successors, whilst the Delhi palace  became a hotbed of squalid and often sanguinary intrigue, disintegration  proceeded with startling rapidity. Revolt followed revolt within, and  the era of external invasions was reopened. Nadir Shah swept down from  Persia and, after two months' carnage and plunder, carried off from  Delhi booty to the value of thirty-two millions, including the famous  Peacock Throne. Then the Afghans again broke through the northern  passes. Six times in the course of fourteen years did Ahmed Shah Durani  carry fire and sword through Northern India. One service, however, the  Afghan rendered. From the Deccan, where a great Mahratta confederacy  had grown up under the Poona Peishwa, the Mahrattas slowly but surely  closed in upon Delhi. Another great battle was fought at Panipat between  the Afghan invaders from the North and the flower of the Mahratta army.  The Mahrattas endured a crushing defeat, which, together with treachery  within their own ranks, broke up the confederacy and prepared the  downfall of their military power, which British arms were to complete.    For whilst the Moghul Empire was rapidly breaking up, the oversea  penetration of India by the ocean route, which the Portuguese had been  the first to open up at the beginning of the sixteenth century, was  progressing apace. Of all those who had followed in the wake of the  Portuguese--Dutch and Danes and Spaniards and French and British--the  British alone had come to stay. After Panipat the wretched emperor, Shah  Alam II., actually took refuge at Allahabad under British protection,  and stayed there for some years as a pensioner of the East India  Company, already a power in the land. Well for him had he remained  there, for he returned to Delhi only to be buffeted, first by one  faction and then by another. Ghulam Kadir, the Rohilla, blinded him in  the very Hall of Audience which bears the famous inscription, \"If a  paradise there be on earth, it is here, it is here, it is here\"; and  when the Mahrattas rescued him he merely exchanged jailers. He was  already an old man, decrepit and sightless, when in 1803, in the same  Hall of Audience, he welcomed his deliverer in Lord Lake, who had routed  the Mahratta forces, almost within sight of his palace, between  Humayun's tomb and the river Jumna. Then, perhaps for the first time in  her history, India knew peace; for though two more descendants of the  Moghul Emperors were still suffered to retain at Delhi the insignia of  royalty, Mahomedan domination was over and her destinies had passed into  the strong keeping of the British, who have sought to fulfil, on  different and sounder lines, the purpose which had inspired the noblest  of Akbar's dreams.    But throughout all those centuries of Mahomedan domination the enduring  power of Hinduism had bent without ever breaking to the storm, even in  Northern India, where it was exposed to the full blast of successive  tempests. Many of its branches withered or were ruthlessly lopped off,  but its roots were too firmly and too deeply embedded in the soil to be  fatally injured. It continued indeed to throw off fresh shoots. The same  process of adaptation, assimilation, and absorption, which had been  going on for centuries before the Mahomedan conquest, without ever being  permanently or even very deeply affected by the vicissitudes of Indian  political history, went on throughout all the centuries of Mahomedan  domination. Whilst millions of Hindus were, it is true, being forcibly  converted to Islam, Hinduism, making good its losses to a great extent  by the complete elimination of Buddhism, and by permeating the Dravidian  races of Southern India, continued its own social and religious  evolution. It was, in fact, after the tide of Mahomedan conquest had set  in that Hindu theology put on fresh forms of interpretation. The rivalry  between the cults of Shiva and of Vishnu became more acute, and many of  the Dharmashastras and Puranas were recast and elaborated by Shivaite  and Vishnuite writers respectively in the form in which we now know  them, thus affording contemporary and graphic pictures of the  persistency of Hindu life and manners after India had lost all political  independence. It was then, too, that Krishna rose to be perhaps the most  popular of Hindu gods, and the divine love, of which he was at first the  personification, was to a great extent lost sight of in favour of his  human amours, whilst the works known as the Tantras, deriving in their  origin from the ancient ideas of sexual dualism immanent in some of the  Vedic deities, developed the customary homage paid to the consorts of  the great gods into the Sakti worship of the female principle, often  with ritual observances either obscene or sanguinary or both. Possibly  as a result of closer contact with primitive Dravidian religions, or of  such wild lawlessness as followed the barbarous devastation wrought by  Timur, the blood even of human victims flowed more freely before the  altars of the Mahamatri, the great goddesses personified in Kali and  Durga. The worship of the gods assumed a more terrific and orgiastic  character. _Sati_ was more frequently practised. Many of the most  splendid and, at the present day, most famous temples--amongst others  that of Jaganath at Puri--were founded during that period. The custom,  in itself very ancient, of religious pilgrimages to celebrated shrines  and to the banks and sources of specially sacred rivers, was consecrated  in elaborate manuals which became text-books of ritual as well as of  religious geography. Much of what might be regarded as the degeneration  of Hinduism from its earlier and more spiritual forms into gross  idolatry and licentiousness, may well have been in itself a reaction  against the iconoclastic monotheism of the politically triumphant  Mahomedans. Caste, which was as foreign to Islam as to Christianity, but  nevertheless retained its hold upon Indian converts to Islam as it has  also in later times upon Indian converts to the Christian creeds, tended  to harden still further; for caste has ever been the keystone of  Hinduism, and, as Mahomedan power gradually waned, Hinduism reasserted  itself in a spirit of both religious and national rebellion against  Mahomedan domination.    The most permanent, or at least the most signal, mark which Mahomedan  ascendancy has left upon Hinduism has been to accentuate the inferiority  of woman by her close confinement--of which there are few traces in  earlier times--within the zenana, possibly in the first instance a  precautionary measure for her protection against the lust of the  Mahomedan conquerors. Her seclusion still constitutes one of the  greatest obstacles to Indian social and religious reform. For, as custom  requires an Indian girl to be shut up in the zenana at the very age when  her education, except in quite elementary schools, should commence, the  women of India, even in the classes in which the men of India have been  drawn into the orbit by Western education, have until recently remained  and still for the most part remain untouched by it, and their innate  conservatism clings to social traditions and religious superstitions of  which their male belongings have already been taught to recognise the  evils. In this respect Mahomedan domination has helped to strengthen the  forces of resistance inherent to Hinduism.    On the other hand, Mahomedan domination has left behind it a deep line  of religious cleavage, deepest in the north, which was the seat of  Mahomedan power, but extending to almost every part of India. Sixty-six  millions of Indians out of three hundred millions are still Mahomedans,  and though time has in a large measure effaced the racial differences  between the original Mahomedan conquerors and the indigenous populations  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15604"],[0,"Piano Mastery: Talks with Master Pianists and Teachers (#14)"],[1,"hand), or singing the melodies and themes, in order to  give him ideas of the meaning and interpretation of the music. This gave  independence to the pupils, though it often afforded them much  amusement.    \"With advanced students Pugno spoke much about music and what it could  express; he translated themes and passages back into the feelings and  emotions which had originated them; he showed how all emotions find  their counterpart in tones. 'Above all let kindness and goodness control  you,' he once wrote; 'if you are filled with kindness, your tone will be  beautiful!'    \"Pugno's instruction took the form of talks on the inner meaning of the  composition, and the art of interpreting it, rather than any training on  the technical side; about the latter he concerned himself very little.  It goes without saying that only talented pupils made progress under  such a master; indeed those without talent interested him not at all. He  was a wonderful teacher for those who had the insight to read between  the lines, and were able to follow and absorb his artistic enthusiasms.    \"I have said that Pugno did not concern himself about teaching the  technical side of piano playing. Even with me, his best pupil, he rarely  touched upon technical points. I must mention a notable exception. He  gave me one technical principle, expressed in a few simple exercises,  which I have never heard of from any one else. The use of this  principle has helped me amazingly to conquer many knotty passages. I  have never given these exercises to any one; I am willing however, to  jot them down for you.\"    (The following is a brief plan of the exercises, as sketched by Mme.  Schnitzer)    [Illustration: EXERCISES]    \"Pugno wished the thirty-seconds and sixty-fourths to be played with the  utmost quickness. This idea is not alone applicable to all scales, but  can be used with any difficult passage found in a composition.    \"Pugno took a keen interest in my work, my progress and career. A few  sentences culled here and there from the many letters of his which I  have preserved, may serve to throw more light on the inner nature of the  man:    \"'I have endeavored to make clear to your young mind the thoughts  expressed in music, so that your understanding and your emotions also  might grow; all this has created a link of gratitude in you and an  affection within me. I have opened the windows for you and have given  you light, and I have reaped the satisfaction of my sowing.'    \"'Hear all the music you can--do not miss any of the pianists either  good or bad; there is always something to be learned, even from a poor  player--if it is only what to avoid! Study great works, but even in  those there are some figures and phrases which need not be brought into  the foreground, lest they attain too much significance.'    \"(After playing with Hans Richter's Orchestra): 'What intoxication of  sound--what exhilaration and collaboration in music! What a force within  us, which sways us and throbs through us, developing and expressing  each sentiment and instinct! What art can be compared to music, which  finds expression through this medium, called an orchestra. I feel myself  greater amid the orchestra, for I have a giant to converse with. I keep  pace with him, I lead him where I will--I calm him and I embrace him. We  supplement each other; in a moment of authority I become his master and  subdue him. The piano alone is too small for me; it does not tempt me to  play it except under such conditions--with a grand orchestra!'\"          XV    THUEL BURNHAM    THE \"MELODY\" AND \"COLORATURA\" HAND      A prominent figure in the musical life of Paris is Thuel Burnham,  pianist and teacher.    Mr. Burnham is an American, who for a number of years has made his home  in Paris. He has studied with the greatest masters of his instrument on  both sides of the water. More than this he is a musical thinker who has  worked out things for himself, amalgamating what he has found best in  other methods with what he has discovered in his own experience. He has  been able to simplify the whole fabric of technical material, so there  is no time lost in useless labor.    As a pianist Mr. Burnham takes high rank. Technical difficulties do not  exist for him. He has come to the last turning of the road; before him  rise the heights of supreme spiritual mastery. A touch that is limpid,  clear, and capable of many gradations of tints; splendid power in  _fortissimo_; delicacy, velocity and variety are all his; together with  all this he has a sympathetic insight into the mood and meaning of the  composer. Of late he has been giving several recitals of a semi-private  nature, at which he has brought out some of the larger works in his  repertoire. These recitals have taken place in his charming studios, and  it was my good fortune to be present when two concertos were played, the  MacDowell in D minor, and the Grieg in A minor. Mr. Burnham is a warm  admirer of the works of our great American composer, and has prepared an  entire program of MacDowell's music, which included the Tragica Sonata,  Polonaise, and many of the shorter pieces.    In a conversation with Mr. Burnham in regard to methods of teaching, he  gave many helpful points, explaining how he had reduced technical  difficulties to a minimum through the exercise of a few simple  principles.      PRINCIPLES OF TOUCH    \"The position and condition of the hand varies according to the  character of the music, and the tone you wish to produce. If you give  out a melody, you want a full, luscious tone, the weight of arm on the  key, everything relaxed, and a clinging, caressing pressure of finger.  Here then, you have the 'Melody Hand,' with outstretched, flat fingers.  If, on the contrary, you want rapid passage work, with clear, bright,  articulate touch, the hand must stand up in well-arched, normal playing  position, with fingers well rounded and good finger action. Here you  have the 'Technical' or 'Coloratura Hand.'      MELODY HAND      \"The Melody Hand is weighty and 'dead,' so to speak. The touch is made  with flat fingers; the ball of the finger comes in contact with the key,  the whole arm, hand and fingers are relaxed--as loose as possible. You  caress the keys as though you loved them, as though they were a very  part of you; you cling to them as to something soft, velvety or  downy--with pressure, pressure, pressure, always.\"    (This illustration recalled to the listener's mind one of Kitty  Cheatham's stories, the one about the little girl caressing a pet  kitten. She was asked which she loved best--her mother or the kitten.  \"Of course I love her best,\" was the rather hesitating answer; \"but I  love kitty too--and she has _fur_!\")    \"To acquire the melody touch, I teach it with the simplest exercises,  sometimes with only single tones. When the idea is apprehended, the  pupil works it out in some lyric piece, like a _Song without Words_, by  Mendelssohn.    \"There are three touches for melody playing: First, the _down touch_,  made by descending arm and hand; second, the _up touch_, made by  elevating the wrist, while the finger lies upon the key; third, the  _wiping-off touch_, which draws the finger off the key, with an arm and  hand movement.      THE TECHNICAL HAND    \"The technical hand employs finger touch and finger action; the hand is  held up, in military position, so to speak; the finger movements are  quick, alert and exact; the hand is _alive_, not dead and heavy, as is  the melody hand. The two ways of playing are quite opposite in their  fundamental character, but they can be modified and blended in endless  ways.    \"For the technical or coloratura touch, the hand is in arched position,  the five fingers are well rounded and curved, their tips are on the  keys, everything is rounded. When a finger is lifted, it naturally  assumes a more rounded position until it descends to the same spot on  the key from which it was lifted, as though there were five little  imaginary black spots on the keys, showing exactly where the finger-tips  should rest. The fingers are lifted cleanly and evenly and _fall_ on the  keys--no hitting nor striking. I make a great distinction between the  coloratura touch and the melody touch. The first is for rapid, brilliant  passage work, sparkling, glittering, iridescent--what you will--but  cold. It is made, as I said, with arched hand and raised finger action.  Melody touch expresses warmth and feeling; is from the heart. Then there  are the down and up arm movements, for chords, and, of course, scale and  arpeggio work, with coloratura touch. I generally expect pupils who come  to me to go through a short course of preparatory study with my  assistant, Miss Madeleine Prosser, who has been with me for years, and  does most thorough work in this line.      ASSIMILATION OF PRINCIPLES    \"Many pupils come to me with no very definite ideas as to touch and what  they may express through it. They think if they _feel_ a passage  sufficiently, they will be able to use the right touch for it. Sometimes  they may be able to hit upon the effect they want, but they don't know  quite how they got it, nor can they repeat it another time at will. I  believe the principles governing certain touches can be so thoroughly  learned and assimilated that _when the player sees a certain passage, he  knows at once what touch is required to express it._ A great actor  illustrates what I mean--he knows how to employ his features and body to  express the thought of his lines. When you go to the Theatre Francais in  Paris, you know every member of the company is thoroughly trained in  every phase of his art. You are aware that each actor has studied  expression to such an extent that the features naturally fall into the  required lines and curves whenever a certain emotion comes up for  expression. So with the pianist--he should have the various touches at  his finger-tips. The step "]]]
