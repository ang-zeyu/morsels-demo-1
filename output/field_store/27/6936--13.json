The second glyph (Pl. 25, fig. 7) is better drawn and shows, in addition  to the eye ring, the slightly erectile feathers at the back of the head.  Comparison with the glyphs representing turtles (Pl. 14, figs. 7-10)  hitherto confused with these macaw glyphs shows differences, the most  important of which are of course the eye ring and the feathers at the  back of the head.    Various other glyphs occur which undoubtedly represent the heads either  of macaws or smaller parrots. They are, for the most part, glyphs from  the stone inscriptions. A crest, resembling that depicted on the head of  the quetzal, is found on a glyph on Altar Q from Copan (Pl. 25, fig.  10). The eye ring, however, seems to indicate the macaw which also has  slightly erectile feathers on the head. Much doubt is attached to the  identification of the glyph of the month _Kayae_[TN-8] from Stela A,  Quirigua (Pl. 25, fig. 9). It resembles closely the glyphs of the turtle  (Pl. 14, figs. 7-9) and especially that on Pl. 14, fig. 10. The Quirigua  glyph has a prominent fleshy tongue, however, like the parrot. From the  fact that the glyph is certainly that for the month _Kayab_ and the  _Kayab_ glyphs in the codices (Pl. 14, fig. 10) resemble the sign for  _a_, in the Landa alphabet which seems to stand for _ak_ (turtle), we  are led to identify this as a turtle rather than a parrot.    The use of the macaw as a lightning beast has already been commented  upon. The parrot is also used in the codices as a head-dress. As with  several other birds the only places in the manuscripts where the whole  bird is shown is in connection with the bearing of children and the  baptism. Here the parrot head-dress is seen on women, Dresden 16c (Pl.  25, fig. 2) and Tro-Cortesianus 94c (Pl. 25, fig. 13). There seems to be  an exception to the whole bird appearing as a head-dress exclusively  with women in Tro-Cortesianus 26c (Pl. 26, fig. 1), where god F appears  with a head-dress composed of the whole bird. The bird is also seen as a  head-dress on Altar Q from Copan (Pl. 26, fig. 3). The head of the macaw  appears as part of the head-dress of god H in Dresden 11a (Pl. 26, fig.  13), god E in Dresden 11b (Pl. 26, fig. 11), god F in Dresden 14b, god D  in Tro-Cortesianus 89a (Pl. 26, fig. 5) and of women in Dresden 12b (Pl.  26, fig. 6) and 19a (Pl. 26, fig. 9). In the rites of the four years in  Tro-Cortesianus 37b, there are two birds which are quite different from  those we have been considering, but which may represent macaws (Pl. 25,  fig. 12; Pl. 26, fig. 10).    In the Nuttall Codex, occur several figures of heavy-billed birds that  may be macaws or other smaller parrots of the genera _Amazona_ or  _Pachyrhynchus_. They are not, however, certainly identifiable (Pl. 26,  figs. 4, 7).    IMPERIAL WOODPECKER (_Campephilus imperialis_). We have here introduced  two drawings from the Nuttall Codex (Pl. 27, figs. 5, 6) which seem to  represent the Imperial ivory-billed woodpecker, a large species that  occurs in the forests of certain parts of Mexico. The figures show a  long-billed bird with acutely pointed tail feathers, a red crest, and  otherwise black and white plumage. The red crest of the woodpecker is of  course highly conventionalized in the drawings where it is shown as of a  number of erect feathers instead of the prominent occipital tuft of  this bird. The crest and particularly the pointed tail feathers and long  beak combined with the characteristic coloring seem to leave little  doubt as to the identity of the species figured. This bird does not seem  to appear in the Maya drawings.    RAVEN (_Corvus corax sinuatus_) (?). There occurs in the Nuttall Codex a  figure of a large black bird (Pl. 27, fig. 7), which may be a black  vulture, but which, from the presence of what appear as prominent  bristles over the nostril, may also be a raven. These bristles are  rather prominent in ravens and quite lacking in the vulture, so that we  are led to identify the drawing as representing the former bird. We have  found no other figures that suggest ravens.    MISCELLANEOUS BIRDS. Four drawings of birds from the Aubin manuscript are  shown here (Pl. 27, figs. 8-11), in order that the conventionalization of  the bird form may be seen. The first two are supposed to represent the  parrot (_cocho_) and the last two the turkey cock (_uexolotl_). There is  little in the drawings by which they can be differentiated. In the codex,  the heads of the parrots are colored red. There is no doubt, however,  about the identification, as they occur in the same relative position on  every page of the manuscript and are two of the thirteen birds associated  with the thirteen gods, the \"Lords of the House of Day\" (Seler,  1900-1901, pp. 31-35). From the foregoing, it may be seen that where  there is no question about the identification, the drawing of the bird  form is rather carelessly done and no great attempt is made to indicate  the special characteristics of the different birds.    As has been shown previously, it is not always possible to identify  without question many of the forms appearing in the manuscripts. This is  especially true with birds. In Tro-Cortesianus 20c, an unidentifiable  bird, painted blue, appears on the top of the staff carried by god F.  The head-dress of this same god in Tro-Cortesianus 27c is a bird form  and in Tro-Cortesianus 55b, the _tonalamatl_ figure is a bird whose  identity cannot be made out with certainty.      MAMMALIA    OPOSSUM (_Didelphis yucatanensis_, _D. mesamericana_). Figures  representing opossums are not with certainty identifiable in the Maya  writings. We have provisionally identified as a frog the animal shown in  Pl. 29, fig. 6, although at first sight the two median round markings  might be taken to represent a marsupial pouch. Stempell considers the  animals found in the upper division of Dresden 25-28 as opossums of one  of the above species, and this seems very possible. They are shown with  long tails, slightly curved at the tips, and with long head and  prominent vibrissae. A rather similar figure is found in the Nuttall  Codex (Pl. 34, fig. 7). There is nothing, however, that seems to  preclude their being dogs and, in our opinion, they represent this  animal.    NINE-BANDED ARMADILLO (_Tatu novemcinctum_). This is the common species  of armadillo (Maya, _wet[vs]_) found throughout the warmer portion of  Mexico and Central America, where it is frequently used as an article of  food, and its shell-like covering is utilized in various ways. Several  representations of it occur in the Tro-Cortesianus (Pl. 29, figs. 1-4),  where it is characterized by its scaly covering, long ears and tail, and  the moveable bands about the body.    This animal is associated with the bee culture, as it is represented  twice in Tro-Cortesianus 103a (Pl. 29, figs. 1, 3) seated below a bee  under an overhanging roof. The hunting scenes in the Tro-Cortesianus  also show the armadillo; in 48a (Pl. 29, fig. 4) and in 91a it is shown  in a pit-fall. In the last case the _Cauac_ signs are clearly seen on  top of the trap, whereas in the former case the same signs seem to be  indicated by the crosses. Finally, this same animal occurs seated in  Tro-Cortesianus 92d (Pl. 29, fig. 2) facing a female figure. There seems  to be no glyph used in connection with this animal.    YUCATAN BROCKET (_Mazama pandora_). Among the numerous representations  of deer in the Maya writings, there is but one that appears to show the  brocket. This occurs in Tro-Cortesianus 92a (Pl. 30, fig. 2), where a  hoofed animal with a single spike-like horn is shown, seemingly impaled  on a stake set in the bottom of a pit-fall. As stated by Stempell, this  animal from the character of its horns is probably to be identified as a  brocket, though there is nothing to preclude its being a young spike  buck of some species of _Odocoileus._    YUCATAN DEER (_Odocoileus yucatanensis_; _O. thomasi_). Several species  of small deer (Maya, _ke_) occur in Mexico and Central America whose  relationships are not yet thoroughly understood (Pls. 30-32). The  species of Yucatan and southern Mexico have small lyrate antlers with  few, short tines, rather different from the broader type of the more  northern species with well developed secondary tines. The former type of  antlers seems to be indicated by the conventionalized structure shown in  Pl. 32, figs. 8-12. These probably represent the Yucatan deer or its  ally Thomas's deer of southern Mexico. Two of the figures, both from the  Nuttall Codex, show the lower incisor teeth (Pl. 32, figs. 8, 11),  though in other cases these are omitted. The larger part of the figures  of deer represent the does which have no antlers. For this reason it is  impossible to distinguish females of the brocket from those of the other  species of deer, if indeed, the Mayas themselves made such a  distinction. The characteristics of deer drawings are the long head and  ears, the prominently elevated tail with the hair bristling from its  posterior side (the characteristic position of the tail when the deer is  running), the hoofs, and less often the presence of incisors in the  lower jaw only and of a curious oblong mark at each end of the eye,  possibly representing the large tear gland.    The deer plays a large part in the Maya ceremonials. It is an important,  perhaps the most important animal offering as a sacrifice to the gods.  Several pages of the Tro-Cortesianus (38-49) are given over to the hunt  and the animal usually represented is the deer, the hunters are shown,  the methods of trapping, the return from the chase, and the rites in  connection with the animals slain. Tro-Cortesianus 48b (Pl. 30, fig. 1)  shows the usual method of trapping where the deer is caught by a cord  around one of the fore legs. Tro-Cortesianus 91a pictures the same  method and 92a (Pl. 30, figs. 2) shows where the deer is caught on a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1906"],[0,"Erewhon; Or, Over the Range (#14)"],[1,"of the Musical Banks, priests of religion, or what  not, and carrying their education with them they diffused a leaven of  culture throughout the country.  I naturally questioned them about many  of the things which had puzzled me since my arrival.  I inquired what was  the object and meaning of the statues which I had seen upon the plateau  of the pass.  I was told that they dated from a very remote period, and  that there were several other such groups in the country, but none so  remarkable as the one which I had seen.  They had a religious origin,  having been designed to propitiate the gods of deformity and disease.  In  former times it had been the custom to make expeditions over the ranges,  and capture the ugliest of Chowbok's ancestors whom they could find, in  order to sacrifice them in the presence of these deities, and thus avert  ugliness and disease from the Erewhonians themselves.  It had been  whispered (but my informant assured me untruly) that centuries ago they  had even offered up some of their own people who were ugly or out of  health, in order to make examples of them; these detestable customs,  however, had been long discontinued; neither was there any present  observance of the statues.    I had the curiosity to inquire what would be done to any of Chowbok's  tribe if they crossed over into Erewhon.  I was told that nobody knew,  inasmuch as such a thing had not happened for ages.  They would be too  ugly to be allowed to go at large, but not so much so as to be criminally  liable.  Their offence in having come would be a moral one; but they  would be beyond the straightener's art.  Possibly they would be consigned  to the Hospital for Incurable Bores, and made to work at being bored for  so many hours a day by the Erewhonian inhabitants of the hospital, who  are extremely impatient of one another's boredom, but would soon die if  they had no one whom they might bore--in fact, that they would be kept as  professional borees.  When I heard this, it occurred to me that some  rumours of its substance might perhaps have become current among  Chowbok's people; for the agony of his fear had been too great to have  been inspired by the mere dread of being burnt alive before the statues.    I also questioned them about the museum of old machines, and the cause of  the apparent retrogression in all arts, sciences, and inventions.  I  learnt that about four hundred years previously, the state of mechanical  knowledge was far beyond our own, and was advancing with prodigious  rapidity, until one of the most learned professors of hypothetics wrote  an extraordinary book (from which I propose to give extracts later on),  proving that the machines were ultimately destined to supplant the race  of man, and to become instinct with a vitality as different from, and  superior to, that of animals, as animal to vegetable life.  So convincing  was his reasoning, or unreasoning, to this effect, that he carried the  country with him; and they made a clean sweep of all machinery that had  not been in use for more than two hundred and seventy-one years (which  period was arrived at after a series of compromises), and strictly  forbade all further improvements and inventions under pain of being  considered in the eye of the law to be labouring under typhus fever,  which they regard as one of the worst of all crimes.    This is the only case in which they have confounded mental and physical  diseases, and they do it even here as by an avowed legal fiction.  I  became uneasy when I remembered about my watch; but they comforted me  with the assurance that transgression in this matter was now so unheard  of, that the law could afford to be lenient towards an utter stranger,  especially towards one who had such a good character (they meant  physique), and such beautiful light hair.  Moreover the watch was a real  curiosity, and would be a welcome addition to the metropolitan  collection; so they did not think I need let it trouble me seriously.    I will write, however, more fully upon this subject when I deal with the  Colleges of Unreason, and the Book of the Machines.    In about a month from the time of our starting I was told that our  journey was nearly over.  The bandage was now dispensed with, for it  seemed impossible that I should ever be able to find my way back without  being captured.  Then we rolled merrily along through the streets of a  handsome town, and got on to a long, broad, and level road, with poplar  trees on either side.  The road was raised slightly above the surrounding  country, and had formerly been a railway; the fields on either side were  in the highest conceivable cultivation, but the harvest and also the  vintage had been already gathered.  The weather had got cooler more  rapidly than could be quite accounted for by the progress of the season;  so I rather thought that we must have been making away from the sun, and  were some degrees farther from the equator than when we started.  Even  here the vegetation showed that the climate was a hot one, yet there was  no lack of vigour among the people; on the contrary, they were a very  hardy race, and capable of great endurance.  For the hundredth time I  thought that, take them all round, I had never seen their equals in  respect of physique, and they looked as good-natured as they were robust.  The flowers were for the most part over, but their absence was in some  measure compensated for by a profusion of delicious fruit, closely  resembling the figs, peaches, and pears of Italy and France.  I saw no  wild animals, but birds were plentiful and much as in Europe, but not  tame as they had been on the other side the ranges.  They were shot at  with the cross-bow and with arrows, gunpowder being unknown, or at any  rate not in use.    We were now nearing the metropolis and I could see great towers and  fortifications, and lofty buildings that looked like palaces.  I began to  be nervous as to my reception; but I had got on very well so far, and  resolved to continue upon the same plan as hitherto--namely, to behave  just as though I were in England until I saw that I was making a blunder,  and then to say nothing till I could gather how the land lay.  We drew  nearer and nearer.  The news of my approach had got abroad, and there was  a great crowd collected on either side the road, who greeted me with  marks of most respectful curiosity, keeping me bowing constantly in  acknowledgement from side to side.    When we were about a mile off, we were met by the Mayor and several  Councillors, among whom was a venerable old man, who was introduced to me  by the Mayor (for so I suppose I should call him) as the gentleman who  had invited me to his house.  I bowed deeply and told him how grateful I  felt to him, and how gladly I would accept his hospitality.  He forbade  me to say more, and pointing to his carriage, which was close at hand, he  motioned me to a seat therein.  I again bowed profoundly to the Mayor and  Councillors, and drove off with my entertainer, whose name was Senoj  Nosnibor.  After about half a mile the carriage turned off the main road,  and we drove under the walls of the town till we reached a _palazzo_ on a  slight eminence, and just on the outskirts of the city.  This was Senoj  Nosnibor's house, and nothing can be imagined finer.  It was situated  near the magnificent and venerable ruins of the old railway station,  which formed an imposing feature from the gardens of the house.  The  grounds, some ten or a dozen acres in extent, were laid out in terraced  gardens, one above the other, with flights of broad steps ascending and  descending the declivity of the garden.  On these steps there were  statues of most exquisite workmanship.  Besides the statues there were  vases filled with various shrubs that were new to me; and on either side  the flights of steps there were rows of old cypresses and cedars, with  grassy alleys between them.  Then came choice vineyards and orchards of  fruit-trees in full bearing.    The house itself was approached by a court-yard, and round it was a  corridor on to which rooms opened, as at Pompeii.  In the middle of the  court there was a bath and a fountain.  Having passed the court we came  to the main body of the house, which was two stories in height.  The  rooms were large and lofty; perhaps at first they looked rather bare of  furniture, but in hot climates people generally keep their rooms more  bare than they do in colder ones.  I missed also the sight of a grand  piano or some similar instrument, there being no means of producing music  in any of the rooms save the larger drawing-room, where there were half a  dozen large bronze gongs, which the ladies used occasionally to beat  about at random.  It was not pleasant to hear them, but I have heard  quite as unpleasant music both before and since.    Mr. Nosnibor took me through several spacious rooms till we reached a  boudoir where were his wife and daughters, of whom I had heard from the  interpreter.  Mrs. Nosnibor was about forty years old, and still  handsome, but she had grown very stout: her daughters were in the prime  of youth and exquisitely beautiful.  I gave the preference almost at once  to the younger, whose name was Arowhena; for the elder sister was  haughty, while the younger had a very winning manner.  Mrs. Nosnibor  received me with the perfection of courtesy, so that I must have indeed  been shy and nervous if I had not at once felt welcome.  Scarcely was the  ceremony of my introduction well completed before a servant announced  that dinner was ready in the next room.  I was exceedingly hungry, and  the dinner was beyond all praise.  Can the reader wonder that I began to  consider myself in excellent quarters?  \"That man embezzle money?\"  thought I to myself; \"impossible.\"    But I noticed that my host was uneasy during the whole meal, and that he  ate nothing but a little bread and milk; towards the end"]]]
