The subject of the atmosphere of Mars can not be dismissed without  further consideration than we have yet given it, because those who think  the planet uninhabitable base their opinion largely upon the assumed  absence of sufficient air to support life. It was long ago recognized  that, other things being equal, a planet of small mass must possess a  less dense atmosphere than one of large mass. Assuming that each planet  originally drew from a common stock, and that the amount and density of  its atmosphere is measured by its force of gravity, it can be shown that  Mars should have an atmosphere less than one fifth as dense as the  earth's.    Dr. Johnstone Stoney has attacked the problem of planetary atmospheres  in another way. Knowing the force of gravity on a planet, it is easy to  calculate the velocity with which a body, or a particle, would have to  start radially from the planet in order to escape from its gravitational  control. For the earth this critical velocity is about seven miles per  second; for Mars about three miles per second. Estimating the velocity  of the molecules of the various atmospheric gases, according to the  kinetic theory, Dr. Stoney finds that some of the smaller planets, and  the moon, are gravitationally incapable of retaining all of these gases  in the form of an atmosphere. Among the atmospheric constituents that,  according to this view, Mars would be unable permanently to retain is  water vapor. Indeed, he supposes that even the earth is slowly losing  its water by evaporation into space, and on Mars, owing to the slight  force of gravity there, this process would go on much more rapidly, so  that, in this way, we have a means of accounting for the apparent drying  up of that planet, while we may be led to anticipate that at some time  in the remote future the earth also will begin to suffer from lack of  water, and that eventually the chasms of the sea will yawn empty and  desolate under a cloudless sky.    But it is not certain that the original supply of atmospheric elements  was in every case proportional to the respective force of gravity of a  planet. The fact that Venus appears to have an atmosphere more extensive  and denser than the earth's, although its force of gravity is a little  less than that of our globe, indicates at once a variation as between  these two planets in the amount of atmospheric material at their  disposal. This may be a detail depending upon differences in the mode,  or in the stage, of their evolution. Thus, after all, Dr. Stoney's  theory may be substantially correct and yet Mars may retain sufficient  water to form clouds, to be precipitated in snow, and to fill its canals  after each annual melting of the polar caps, because the original supply  was abundant, and its escape is a gradual process, only to be completed  by age-long steps.    Even though the evidence of the spectroscope, as far as it goes, seems  to lend support to the theory that there is no water vapor in the  atmosphere of Mars, we can not disregard the visual evidence that,  nevertheless, water vapor exists there.    What are the polar caps if they are not snow? Frozen carbon dioxide, it  has been suggested; but this is hardly satisfactory, for it offers no  explanation of the fact that when the polar caps diminish, and in  proportion as they diminish, the \"seas\" and the canals darken and  expand, whereas a reasonable explanation of the correlation of these  phenomena is offered if we accept the view that the polar caps consist  of snow.    Then there are many observations on record indicating the existence of  clouds in Mars's atmosphere. Sometimes a considerable area of its  surface has been observed to be temporarily obscured, not by dense  masses of cloud such as accompany the progress of great cyclonic storms  across the continents and oceans of the earth, but by comparatively thin  veils of vapor such as would be expected to form in an atmosphere so  comparatively rare as that of Mars. And these clouds, in some instances  at least, appear, like the cirrus streaks and dapples in our own air, to  float at a great elevation. Mr. Douglass, one of Mr. Lowell's associates  in the observations of 1894 at Flagstaff, Arizona, observed what he  believed to be a cloud over the unilluminated part of Mars's disk,  which, by micrometric measurement and estimate, was drifting at an  elevation of about fifteen miles above the surface of the planet. This  was seen on two successive days, November 25th and November 26th, and it  underwent curious fluctuations in visibility, besides moving in a  northerly direction at the rate of some thirteen miles an hour. But,  upon the whole, as Mr. Lowell remarks, the atmosphere of Mars is  remarkably free of clouds.    The reader will remember that Mars gets a little less than half as much  heat from the sun as the earth gets. This fact also has been used as an  argument against the habitability of the planet. In truth, those who  think that life in the solar system is confined to the earth alone  insist upon an almost exact reproduction of terrestrial conditions as a  _sine qua non_ to the habitability of any other planet. Venus, they  think, is too hot, and Mars too cold, as if life were rather a happy  accident than the result of the operation of general laws applicable  under a wide variety of conditions. All that we are really justified in  asserting is that Venus may be too hot and Mars too cold for _us_. Of  course, if we adopt the opinion held by some that the temperature on  Mars is constantly so low that water would remain perpetually frozen, it  does throw the question of the kind of life that could be maintained  there into the realm of pure conjecture.    The argument in favor of an extremely low temperature on Mars is based  on the law of the diminution of radiant energy inversely as the square  of the distance, together with the assumption that no qualifying  circumstances, or no modification of that law, can enter into the  problem. According to this view, it could be shown that the temperature  on Mars never rises above -200 deg. F. But it is a view that seems to be  directly opposed to the evidence of the telescope, for all who have  studied Mars under favorable conditions of observation have been  impressed by the rapid and extensive changes that the appearance of its  surface undergoes coincidently with the variation of the planet's  seasons. It has its winter aspect and its summer aspect, perfectly  distinct and recognizable, in each hemisphere by turns, and whether the  polar caps be snow or carbon dioxide, at any rate they melt and  disappear under a high sun, thus proving that an accumulation of heat  takes place.    Professor Young says: \"As to the temperature of Mars we have no certain  knowledge. On the one hand, we know that on account of the planet's  distance from the sun the intensity of solar radiation upon its surface  must be less than here in the ratio of 1 to (1.524)^2--i.e., only about  43 per cent as great as with us; its 'solar constant' must be less than  13 calories against our 30. Then, too, the low density of its  atmosphere, probably less at the planet's surface than on the tops of  our highest mountains, would naturally assist to keep down the  temperature to a point far below the freezing-point of water. But, on  the other hand, things certainly _look_ as if the polar caps were really  masses of _snow_ and _ice_ deposited from vapor in the planet's  atmosphere, and as if these actually melted during the Martian summer,  sending floods of water through the channels provided for them, and  causing the growth of vegetation along their banks. We are driven,  therefore, to suppose either that the planet has sources of heat  internal or external which are not yet explained, or else, as long ago  suggested, that the polar 'snow' may possibly be composed of something  else than frozen _water_.\"[4]    [Footnote 4: General Astronomy, by Charles A. Young. Revised edition,  1898, p. 363.]    Even while granting the worst that can be said for the low temperature  of Mars, the persistent believer in its habitability could take refuge  in the results of recent experiments which have proved that bacterial  life is able to resist the utmost degree of cold that can be applied,  microscopic organisms perfectly retaining their vitality--or at least  their power to resume it--when subjected to the fearfully low  temperature of liquid air. But then he would be open to the reply that  the organisms thus treated are in a torpid condition and deprived of all  activity until revived by the application of heat; and the picture of a  world in a state of perpetual sleep is not particularly attractive,  unless the fortunate prince who is destined to awake the slumbering  beauty can also be introduced into the romance.[5]    [Footnote 5: Many of the present difficulties about temperatures on the  various planets would be beautifully disposed of if we could accept the  theory urged by Mr. Cope Whitehouse, to the effect that the sun is not  really a hot body at all, and that what we call solar light and heat are  only local manifestations produced in our atmosphere by the  transformation of some other form of energy transmitted from the sun;  very much as the electric impulses carried by a wire from the  transmitting to the receiving station on a telephone line are translated  by the receiver into waves of sound. According to this theory, which is  here mentioned only as an ingenuity and because something of the kind so  frequently turns up in one form or another in popular semi-scientific  literature, the amount of heat and light on a planet would depend mainly  upon local causes.]    "]]]
