But they will not come to this city without good reason. It is  an accursed place.\"    With the early morning the city drew them once more. Dalgard's  curiosity pulled him to that storehouse. He could not stifle the hope  that with luck he might find something there which would solve their  problem for them. If there could only be a way to avoid open conflict  with Those Others, some solution whereby the aliens need never know of  the existence of the Colony. For so many generations, even centuries,  the aliens had been confined, or had confined themselves, safely  overseas on the western continent. Perhaps if now they were faced by  some new catastrophe, they would never attempt to come east again. He  had visions of discovering and activating some trap set to protect  their treasures which could be turned against them. But he realized  that he lacked the technical knowledge which would have aided him in  the search for such a weapon.    The remnants of Terran science and mechanics, which the outlaws had  brought with them from their native world, had been handed on; the  experiments they had managed since with crude equipment had been  carefully recorded, and he was acquainted with the outlines of most of  them. But the few destructive arms they had imported were long since  worn out or lacked charges, and they had not been able to duplicate  them. Just as they had torn asunder the ship in which they had crossed  space, to use its parts for the building of Homeport, so had they  hoarded all else they had brought. But they were limited by lack of  materials on Astra, and their fear of the knowledge of the aliens had  kept them from experimenting with things found in the ruins.    There might be hundreds of objects on the shelves of that storage  place, which, properly used, would reduce not only just the room and  its contents to glowing slag, but take half the city with it. But he  had no idea which, or which combination, would do it.    And here Sssuri could be no help. The mermen had made great strides  forward in biological and mental sciences, but mechanics was a closed  section of learning because of their enforced habitat under the sea,  and of machines they knew less than the colonists.    \"I have been thinking--\" Sssuri broke into his companion's chain of  reasoning, \"of what we may do. And perhaps there is a way to reach the  sea more swiftly than by returning overland.\"    \"Downriver? But you said that way may have its watching devices.\"    \"Which would be centered on objects coming upstream, not down. But in  this city there should be yet another way--\"    He did not enlarge upon that, but since he apparently knew what he was  doing, Dalgard let him play guide once more. They recrossed the  sluggish river, the scout looking into its murky depths with little  relish for it as a means of transportation. Though it had an oily,  flowing current, there was a suggestion of stagnant water with  unpleasant surprises waiting beneath its turgid surface.    For the second time they entered the arena. Avoiding the bodies,  Sssuri made a circuit of the sanded floor. He did not turn in at the  archway which led to the storage place, but paused before another as  if there lay what he had been searching for.    Dalgard's less sensitive nostrils picked up a new scent, the  not-to-be-missed fetor of damp underground ways where water stood.  The merman edged around a barred gate as Dalgard sniffed again. The  smell of damp was crossed by other and even less appetizing odors, but  he did not catch the stench of the snake-devils. And, relying on  Sssuri's judgment, he followed the merman into the dark.    Once again patches of violet light glimmered over their heads as the  passage narrowed and sloped downward. Dalgard tried to remember the  general geography of the section which was above them now. He had  assumed that this way with its dank chill must give on the river. But  when they had pattered on for a long distance, he knew that either  they had passed beneath the stream or that he was totally lost as to  direction.    As their eyes adjusted to the gloom of the passage the violet light  grew stronger. So Dalgard saw clearly when Sssuri whirled and faced  back along the way they had come, his body in a half crouch, his knife  ready in his hand.    Dalgard, his bow useless in the damp, drew his own sword-knife. But,  though his mind probed and he listened, he could sense or hear nothing  on their trail.          8    AIRLIFT      They were air-borne once more, but Raf was not pleased. In the seat  beside him, which Captain Hobart should be occupying, there now  squirmed an alien warrior who apparently was uncomfortable in the  chair-like depression so different from the low stools he was  accustomed to. Soriki was still in the second passenger place, but he,  too, shared that with another of the men from the city who rested  across bony knees a strange weapon rather like a Terran rifle.    No, the spacemen were not prisoners. According to the official  statement they were allies. But, Raf wondered, as against his will he  followed the globe in a northeastern course, how long would that  fiction last if they refused to fall in with any suggestions the  aliens might make? He did not doubt that there was on board the globe  some surprise which could shoot the flitter out of the air, if, for  example, he adjusted the controls before him and bore west toward the  mountains and the safety of the space ship. Either of the aliens he  now transported could bring him under control by using those weapons,  which might do anything from boiling a man in some unknown ray to  smothering him in gas. He had not seen the arms in action, and he did  not want to.    Yet Hobart and Lablet did not, as far as he could tell, share his  suspicions. Lablet was eager to see the mysterious storehouse, and the  captain was either moved by the same desire or else had long since  deduced the folly of trying to make a break for it Thus they were now  heading seaward with the captain and Lablet sharing quarters with the  leaders of the expedition on board the globe, and Raf and the  com-tech, with companions--or guards--bringing up the rear. The aliens  had even insisted on stripping the flitter of much of its Terran  equipment before they left the city, pointing out that the cleared  storage space would be filled with salvage when they made the return  voyage.    The globe had been trailing along the coastline, and now it angled out  to glide over a long finger of cape, rocky and waterworn, which  pointed at almost a right angle into the sea. This dwindled into a  reef of rock, like the nail on a finger. The sea ahead was no unbroken  expanse. Instead there was a series of islands, some merely tops of  reefs over which the waves broke, others more substantial, rising well  above the threatening water, and one or two showing the green of  vegetation.    The chain of islets extended so far out that when the flitter passed  over the last one the main continent was out of sight. Now only water  stretched beneath them. The globe skidded on as if its pilot had given  it an extra burst of power, and Raf accelerated in turn, having no  desire to lose his guide. But they were not to make the ocean-wide  trip in one jump.    At midday he saw again a break in the smooth carpet of waves, another  island, or perhaps the southern tip of a northern continent for the  land swept in that direction as far as he could see. The globe  spiraled down to make a neat landing on a flat plateau, and Raf  prepared to join it. When the undercarriage of the flitter jarred  lightly on the rock, he saw signs that this was a man-or  alien-fashioned place which must have had much use in the dim past  when his new companions ruled all their native world.    The rock had been smoothed off to a flat surface, and at its perimeter  were several small domed buildings. Yet, as there had been in the  countryside and in the city, except at its very heart, there was an  aura of desertion at the site.    Both his alien passengers jumped out of the flitter, as if only too  pleased at their release from the Terran flyer. For the first time Raf  was shaken out of his own preoccupation with his dislike for the  aliens to wonder if they could be moved by a similar distaste for  Terrans. Lablet might be interested in that as a scientific  problem--the pilot only knew how he felt and that was not comfortable.    Soriki got out and walked across the rock, stretching. But for a long  moment Raf remained where he was, behind the controls of the flyer. He  was as cramped and tired of travel as the com-tech, perhaps even more  so since the responsibility of the flight had been his. And had they  landed in open country he would have liked to have thrown himself down  on the ground, taking off his helmet and unhooking his tunic collar to  let the fresh wind blow through his hair and across his skin. Perhaps  that would take away the arid dust of centuries, which, to his mind,  had grimed him since their hours in the city. But here was no open  country, only a landing space which reminded him too much of the roof  of the building in the metropolis.    A half-dozen of the breastplated warriors filed out of the globe and went  to the nearest dome, returning with heavy boxes. Fuel--supplies--Raf  shrugged off the problem. The pilot was secretly relieved when Captain  Hobart dropped out of the hatch in the globe and made his way over to the  flitter.    \"Everything running smoothly?\" he asked with a glance at the two  aliens who were Raf's passengers.    \"Yes, sir. Any idea how much farther--?\" Raf questioned.    Hobart shrugged. \"Until we work out basic language difficulties,\" he  muttered, \"who knows anything? There is at least one more of these way  stations. They don't run on atomics, need some kind of fuel, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18464"],[0,"The Wit and Humor of America, Volume I.

A LETTER FROM MR. BIGGS    BY E.W. HOWE      MY DEAR SIR--Occasionally a gem occurs to me which I am unable to favor  you with because of late we are not much together. Appreciating the keen  delight with which you have been kind enough to receive my philosophy, I  take the liberty of sending herewith a number of ideas which may please  and benefit you, and which I have divided into paragraphs with headings.      HAPPINESS    I have observed that happiness and brains seldom go together. The  pin-headed woman who regards her thin-witted husband as the greatest man  in the world, is happy, and much good may it do her. In such cases  ignorance is a positive blessing, for good sense would cause the woman  to realize her distressed condition. A man who can think he is as \"good  as anybody\" is happy. The fact may be notorious that the man is not so  \"good as anybody\" until he is as industrious, as educated, and as  refined as anybody, but he has not brains enough to know this, and,  content with conceit, is happy. A man with a brain large enough to  understand mankind is always wretched and ashamed of himself.      REPUTATION    Reputation is not always desirable. The only thing I have ever heard  said in Twin Mounds concerning Smoky Hill is that good hired girls may  be had there.      WOMEN    1. Most women seem to love for no other reason than that it is expected  of them.    2. I know too much about women to honor them more than they deserve; in  fact I know all about them. I visited a place once where doctors are  made, and saw them cut up one.    3. A woman loses her power when she allows a man to find out all there  is to her; I mean by this that familiarity breeds contempt. I knew a  young man once who worked beside a woman in an office, and he never  married.    4. If men would only tell what they actually know about women, instead  of what they believe or hear, they would receive more credit for  chastity than is now the case, for they deserve more.      LACK OF SELF-CONFIDENCE    As a people we lack self-confidence. The country is full of men that  will readily talk you to death privately, who would run away in alarm if  asked to preside at a public meeting. In my Alliance movement I often  have trouble in getting out a crowd, every farmer in the neighborhood  feeling of so much importance as to fear that if he attends he will be  called upon to say something.      IN DISPUTE    In some communities where I have lived the women were mean to their  husbands; in others, the husbands were mean to their wives. It is  usually the case that the friends of a wife believe her husband to be a  brute, and the friends of the husband believe the wife to possess no  other talent than to make him miserable. You can't tell how it is; the  evidence is divided.      MAN    There is only one grade of men; they are all contemptible. The judge may  seem to be a superior creature so long as he keeps at a distance, for I  have never known one who was not constantly trying to look wise and  grave; but when you know him, you find there is nothing remarkable about  him except a plug hat, a respectable coat, and a great deal of vanity,  induced by the servility of those who expect favors.      OPPORTUNITY    You hear a great many persons regretting lack of opportunity. If every  man had opportunity for his desires, this would be a nation of murderers  and disgraced women.      EXPECTATION    Always be ready for that which you do not expect. Nothing that you  expect ever happens. You have perhaps observed that when you are waiting  for a visitor at the front door, he comes in at the back, and surprises  you.      WOMAN'S WORK    A woman's work is never done, as the almanacs state, for the reason that  she does not go about it in time to finish it.      THE GREATEST OF THESE IS CHARITY    If you can not resist the low impulse to talk about people, say only  what you actually know, instead of what you have heard. And, while you  are about it, stop and consider whether you are not in need of charity  yourself.      NEIGHBORS    Every man overestimates his neighbors, because he does not know them so  well as he knows himself. A sensible man despises himself because he  knows what a contemptible creature he is. I despise Lytle Biggs, but I  happen to know that his neighbors are just as bad.      VIRTUE    Men are virtuous because the women are; women are virtuous from  necessity.      ASHAMED OF THE TRUTH    I believe I never knew any one who was not ashamed of the truth. Did you  ever notice that a railroad company numbers its cars from 1,000, instead  of from 1?      KNOWING ONLY ONE OF THEM    We are sometimes unable to understand why a pretty little woman marries  a fellow we know to be worthless; but the fellow, who knows the woman  better than we do, considers that he has thrown himself away. We know  the fellow, but we do not know the woman.      AN APOLOGY    I detest an apology. The world is full of people who are always making  trouble and apologizing for it. If a man respects me, he will not give  himself occasion for apology. An offense can not be wiped out in that  way. If it could, we would substitute apologies for hangings. I hope you  will never apologize to me; I should regard it as evidence that you had  wronged me.      OLDEST INHABITANTS    The people of Smoky Hill are only fit for oldest inhabitants. In thirty  or forty years from now there will be a great demand for reminiscences  of the pioneer days. I recommend that they preserve extensive data for  the only period in their lives when they can hope to attract attention.    Be good enough, sir, to regard me, as of old, your friend.    L. BIGGS.  _To_ NED WESTLOCK, _Twin Mounds_.          MRS. JOHNSON    BY WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS      It was on a morning of the lovely New England May that we left the  horse-car, and, spreading our umbrellas, walked down the street to our  new home in Charlesbridge, through a storm of snow and rain so finely  blent by the influences of this fortunate climate, that no flake knew  itself from its sister drop, or could be better identified by the people  against whom they beat in unison. A vernal gale from the east fanned our  cheeks and pierced our marrow and chilled our blood, while the raw, cold  green of the adventurous grass on the borders of the sopping side-walks  gave, as it peered through its veil of melting snow and freezing rain, a  peculiar cheerfulness to the landscape. Here and there in the vacant  lots abandoned hoop-skirts defied decay; and near the half-finished  wooden houses, empty mortar-beds, and bits of lath and slate strewn over  the scarred and mutilated ground, added their interest to the scene....    This heavenly weather, which the Pilgrim Fathers, with the idea of  turning their thoughts effectually from earthly pleasures, came so far  to discover, continued with slight amelioration throughout the month of  May and far into June; and it was a matter of constant amazement with  one who had known less austere climates, to behold how vegetable life  struggled with the hostile skies, and, in an atmosphere as chill and  damp as that of a cellar, shot forth the buds and blossoms upon the  pear-trees, called out the sour Puritan courage of the currant-bushes,  taught a reckless native grape-vine to wander and wanton over the  southern side of the fence, and decked the banks with violets as  fearless and as fragile as New England girls; so that about the end of  June, when the heavens relented and the sun blazed out at last, there  was little for him to do but to redden and darken the daring fruits that  had attained almost their full growth without his countenance.    Then, indeed, Charlesbridge appeared to us a kind of Paradise. The wind  blew all day from the southwest, and all day in the grove across the way  the orioles sang to their nestlings.... The house was almost new and in  perfect repair; and, better than all, the kitchen had as yet given no  signs of unrest in"]]]
