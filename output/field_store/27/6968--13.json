He continued Warelwast's work.    #Robert Warelwast# (1155-1160) was a nephew of the former bishop of that  name.    #Bartholomaeus Iscanus# (1161-1184), a native of Exeter, was of humble  birth. He is said to have been an enemy of Becket's and was called by  Pope Alexander III. \"the luminary of the English Church.\"    #John the Chaunter# (1186-1191) continued the buildings which had been  suspended during the last episcopate.    #Henry Marshall# (1194-1206), brother to the Earl of Pembroke, Marshal  of England, was promoted from York, of which cathedral he was dean. He  completed the buildings as designed by the first Warelwast. To him we  owe the Lady Chapel, the larger choir, the north porch, cloister  doorway, and six chapels. He assisted at the coronation of King Richard  at Winchester in 1194, and at that of John in 1199.    #Simon de Apulia# (1214-1223). But little is recorded of this bishop. He  assisted at Henry III.'s coronation at Gloucester when the king was a  lad of ten. To him also is attributed the fixing of the boundaries of  the city parishes. His tomb is in the Lady Chapel.    #William Bruere# (1224-1244) served as Precentor of Exeter before he was  made bishop. To him are due the chapter house and stalls in the old  choir. For five years he was in the Holy Land, and Matthew Paris writes  of his energy and untiring devotion in administering to the wants of his  countrymen.    #Richard Blondy# (1245-1257). According to Hoker this bishop was the son  of Hilary Blondy, Mayor of Exeter in 1227.    #Walter Bronescombe# (1257-1280), a native of Exeter, was only in  deacon's orders when chosen bishop. He restored the chapels of St.  Gabriel, St. Mary Magdalene and St. James. He also founded a college at  Glasney and restored \"the establishment of Crediton\" to much of its  former splendour.    #Peter Quivil# (1280-1291) was born in Exeter, and a _protege_ of  Bronescombe's. His first preferment was as Archdeacon of St. David's,  from whence he was promoted bishop of his native city. He it was who  designed the Decorated cathedral and transformed transepts with chapels,  eastern bay of the nave, and the Lady Chapel.    #Thomas de Bytton# (1292-1307) continued Quivil's work, transforming the  choir and its aisles. He was a native of Gloucestershire and had been  Dean of Wells. An indulgence of forty days was granted by the Pope,  Boniface VIII., three archbishops and five bishops, to all who should  pray for his prosperity. The rules he made for the government of the  collegiate church at Crediton won general approval.    #Walter de Stapledon# (1308-1326) was Professor of Canon Law at Oxford  and a chaplain to Pope Clement V. He was killed by a London mob. The  transformed choir transepts are his work, and he erected the organ  screen, bishop's throne, and sedilia. During his episcopate, also, the  cloisters were begun.    #James Berkeley# (1326-1327), Archdeacon of Huntingdon, and grandson of  William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby, died a few weeks after his  consecration.    #John Grandisson# (1327-1369) was born in Herefordshire, of good family.  His long tenure of the see is one of the most memorable chapters in the  history of Exeter. The fatal Black Death occurred during his episcopacy,  1348-1369. He inherited the transforming zeal of his predecessors and  set his seal on the six western bays of the nave, the great west  windows, and the vaulting and the aisles. He completed the north  cloister.    #Thomas Brantyngham# (1370-1394) was educated at the Court of Edward  III., and was a canon of Exeter when chosen bishop. He was a constant  adviser of the king, only being released from his privy council and  parliamentary duties when his advanced age made them irksome to him. He  was very busy in all the affairs of the diocese, but found time to  complete the cloisters, east window, and west front.    #Edmund Stafford# (1395-1419) came of a greatly distinguished family. He  was a canon of York when Pope Boniface IX. advanced him to the See of  Exeter. For a time he served the king as Lord High Chancellor. He has  been abused by Campbell in his \"Lives of the Lord Chancellors of  England\": but there seems little doubt that he deserved the reputation  he certainly got of being learned, grave, and wise, and \"very well  accounted generally of all men.\" To him are attributed the canopies over  the tombs in the Lady Chapel.    #John Ketterick# or #Catterick# (1419) died at Florence a month after  his appointment.    #Edmund Lacy# (1420-1455), composer of an office in honour of the  Archangel Raphael, left a saintly reputation, and pilgrimages were, for  long, made to his tomb. According to Canon Freeman he raised the chapter  house and glazed the nave windows.    #George Neville# (1458-1465) was a son of the Earl of Salisbury. He was  Chancellor of Oxford, and only twenty-four when made bishop. Though for  several years Lord High Chancellor, and translated to York, he died in  disgrace and comparative poverty.    #John Bothe# (1465-1478) was the son of a Cheshire knight. He has often,  but wrongly, been credited with being the donor of the throne. With more  certainty the roof of the chapter house has been acknowledged as his  work.    #Peter Courtenay# (1478-1486), son of Sir Philip Courtenay of Powderham,  had been Archdeacon of Exeter and Wiltshire, and Dean of Windsor and  Exeter before he was appointed Bishop of Exeter. He assisted at the  coronation of Richard III., but was none the less translated, for his  services, by Henry to the diocese of Winchester.    #Richard Fox# (1487-1491), the next bishop, was held in great esteem by  Henry VII., whom he represented for a time as Ambassador at the Court of  Scotland. He arranged the preliminaries of the marriage of Henry's  daughter Margaret with James IV. He was translated to Bath and Wells,  then to Durham, and finally to Winchester. He is said to have refused  the dignity of Archbishop of Canterbury, which his godson, Henry VIII.,  was anxious he should accept.    #Oliver King# (1492-1495) was Bishop of Exeter for a short time only,  being translated to Bath and Wells. He began building the Abbey Church  at Bath, but did not live to see much of it completed.    #Richard Redman# (1496-1501) was translated to Exeter from St. Asaph. He  resigned the see on becoming Bishop of Ely.    #John Arundell# (1502-1503) was translated from the See of Lichfield and  Coventry. He was famous for his benevolence and hospitality. He died  after barely two years' tenancy of the western bishopric.    #Hugh Oldham# (1504-1519) came of an ancient Lancashire family. A large  and flourishing manufacturing town in that county bears his name. He  founded the grammar school in Manchester, and on his elevation became  famous throughout the west of England for his learning and piety.    #John Vesey (Harman)# (1519-1551). A lengthy account is given of this  bishop in the first chapter.    #Miles Coverdale# (1551-1553) was a famous reformer, and revised  Tyndale's translation of the Bible. He was not popular in the diocese,  and on Queen Mary's accession was deprived of his see, to the great  satisfaction of his flock.    #James Turberville# (1555-1559) was deprived of his see on his refusal  to acknowledge the ecclesiastical supremacy of Elizabeth. He had been  popular in the west of England, where the Reformation was at first  heartily disliked.    #William Alleyn# (1560-1570). Oliver writes the surname Alley. The  diocese was now so poor that he was compelled to reduce the number of  canons from twenty-four to nine. Only by accepting the rectorship of  Honiton was the bishop himself able to support the dignity of his  office. He was the author of several religious books that had  considerable popularity in their day.    #William Bradbridge# (1570-1578) is said to have speculated largely in  agricultural land, and to have died a debtor for a large amount,  including L1,400 owed to Queen Elizabeth. Beyond this little is recorded  of him except that he lived at Newton Ferrers, of which he held the  living _in commendam_, which must have put his clergy to great  inconvenience.    #John Wolton# (1579-1594). During Wolton's episcopate the revenues were  restored to the chapter, the crown reserving to itself the sum of L145  yearly. The priest-vicars, also, received back from the queen the  greater portion of their possessions.    #Gervase Babington# (1595-1597) was translated from Llandaff. He  remained at Exeter but a short time. He seems to have been a favourite  with the queen, who took an early opportunity to promote him to the  wealthy See of Worcester.    #William Cotton# (1598-1621).    #Valentine Carey# (1621-1626) had been Master of Christ's College,  Cambridge, and Dean of St. Paul's.    #Joseph Hall# (1627-1641) was Dean of Worcester when promoted to the See  of Exeter. He was a famous theological writer, and was translated to  Norwich in 1641. There he suffered a great deal of unmerited  persecution, which he bore bravely, though the ill-treatment of his  enemies killed him.    #Ralph Brownrigg# (1642-1659), Master of St. Catharine's, Cambridge, was  bishop in troublous times. He had to retire to a friend's house in  Berkshire. He was elected Preacher of the Temple, and was buried at the  cost of the Inn.    #John Gauden# (1660-1662) was Master of the Temple. His title to fame is  as the reputed author of the [Greek: EIKON BASILIKE]. Being the first  bishop appointed after the Restoration, his arrival in Exeter was gladly  welcomed by the loyal citizens. But he does not seem to have been a  lovable man, and was over-eager for riches. He was translated to  Worcester on his complaint of poverty reaching the king's ears.    #Seth Ward# (1662-1667) was already popular as dean when he succeeded  Gauden as bishop. He cleared the cathedral of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19449"],[0,"The North American Indian, Vol. 1 (#14)"],[1," plains, even to the feather  headdress, which is never worn by the tribes to their south and west.  Features of an annual fiesta have been borrowed directly from the Pueblos.    The typical habitation of the Jicarillas is a tipi, or lodge, called  _kozhan_, patterned after that of the Plains tribes. Formerly they hunted  the buffalo, making periodical excursions from their mountain home to the  plains and bringing back quantities of prepared meat and large numbers of  hides, which were fashioned into tents and used for many other purposes.  To all intents and purposes, therefore, the Jicarillas were a plains  tribe. Only within recent years have they grown crops of any kind. They  exhibit fair skill in basketry, this being their chief industry and source  of barter with neighboring tribes; indeed it was through this custom of  making \"little baskets\" that the Spaniards applied to them the name by  which they are popularly known. The Pueblos of the Rio Grande use many  baskets, which they obtain chiefly from the Jicarillas in exchange for  corn. During late years many of these _jicarillas_ have been disposed of  to traders. Like the Navaho they make but little pottery, and that only  for utilitarian purposes.    The Jicarillas seem to have no system of clans or gentes. The tribe is  divided into two bands--commonly called by their Spanish names, _Olleros_  (Potters) and _Llaneros_ (Plainsmen)--within which marriage is not  prohibited. In the days of the buffalo a part of the tribe, preferring the  prairie country, remained there for a short time and received the name  Kolhkahin, People of the Plains. The others returned to the mountains and  from the pottery they there made were called Sait Nde, Sand People, sand  being used in mixing the clay. In event of marriage between members of  different bands, sons born of the union belong to the father's band, while  daughters belong to the band of the mother.    Generally speaking, chieftainship is hereditary, passing to the eldest  son, if there be such, otherwise to a brother, on the death of the  incumbent; but this rule might be set aside if public opinion were strong  enough to warrant it, and the chief be selected from another family. Each  band has a headman, chosen by reason of his personal bravery and  worthiness. The tribal chief, however, is the recognized leader, the two  band chiefs being little more than figureheads.    The social customs of the Jicarillas are well defined. A young man wishing  to marry sends a near relation to procure the consent of the girl's  parents, with whose decision the wishes of the daughter have little  weight. If the young man meets their approval, he is sent out to hunt, and  the game which he kills is distributed among the girl's relations. The  following day his family build a _kozhan_ and place in it the personal  effects of the young couple, who, at night, enter with friends and  kinsfolk. A medicine-man prays to Naye{~COMBINING BREVE~}nayezgani, asking his beneficence  toward the new home. This ceremony lasts until midnight, when the visitors  depart and the marriage is consummated. Polygamy was common. Divorce is  effected without ceremony, the discontented one deserting the other and  leaving him or her in possession of the dwelling.    Property right is governed by tribal laws. The wife's belongings are  inherited by her children or, if she should have none, by her parents, not  by the husband. On the death of the husband his property passes to the  children and the wife.    The dead are buried in secret, only a few of the close relations having  knowledge of the place. Immediately after death the body is carried on  horseback to a high point, where it is placed on the ground and covered  with the personal possessions of the deceased, such as clothing, blankets,  saddles, and weapons, and over all are heaped brush and stones. Formerly a  man's horse was killed near his grave, and sometimes as many as three or  four horses were similarly sacrificed at different places. In former times  also the _kozhan_ was burned after the burial, and members of the family  cut their hair as a sign of mourning. The souls of the dead are believed  to rise skyward. In one portion of the sky, among vast herds of buffalo,  all those who have met death in battle assemble, rich and happy; in  another part, those who have succumbed to sickness and old age. The evil,  or those who have practised witchcraft, have a place apart from the rest.  Between the latter and the spirits of the good stands a high rock wall at  which the evil ones are condemned to dig for eternity in an effort to  reach the happier home. Spirits can work only in darkness, and the work of  the night is ever brought to naught by recurring daylight.                     [Illustration: A Jicarilla Feast March]                             A Jicarilla Feast March                 _From Copyright Photograph 1904 by E.S. Curtis_      The Jicarillas, like their kindred the Navaho and Apache, pay much  attention to religion and ceremony. Compared with the Navaho their life  seems almost lacking in ceremony, but when contrasted with the various  Yuman tribes on the Colorado and Gila rivers of Arizona it is fairly rich.  Their healing or medicine rites include a dance, called _Isane_, that  occupies four days and four nights, and many one-day \"sings,\" in all of  which dry-paintings are employed. Like the Apache the Jicarillas attach  much importance to the girls' puberty ceremony and still rigidly adhere to  it.    A four-day medicine dance is founded on the following legend:    Two maidens lived at the bottom of a deep pit. Many of the men wished to  marry them, but the girls were well content and refused to come out. The  Bear and the Snake formed a plan to carry them off and make them their  wives. A beautiful butterfly was sent fluttering down over the girls'  heads, but they paid little heed to its beauties. Another was sent, then  another, and yet a fourth, which was so beautiful that the girls reached  up to catch it, for they wished to copy its splendid colors on a large  basket they were weaving. But the butterfly escaped them and flew upward,  keeping ever out of reach as the girls followed to the mouth of the pit.  There the Bear and the Snake in waiting suddenly reached over, seized the  girls, and carried them away. The people, learning of this, asked them to  bring the girls back, but the Bear and the Snake refused, so an appeal was  made to Naye{~COMBINING BREVE~}nayezgani and Kobadjischini. These two gods built a fence  around the world to keep the Bear and the Snake from escaping, and,  summoning all the people, compelled the Bear and the Snake to bring the  two young women back. The one the Bear had married had grown very fat and  coarse, like her master. \"What have you done to make this girl so fat?\"  demanded Naye{~COMBINING BREVE~}nayezgani in anger. \"You must give her medicine to make her  comely again.\" So the Bear sang songs and made medicine until the girl was  herself again. Then came the Snake with the girl he had stolen. She had  become thin, like her master. \"What have you done to make this girl so  thin?\" cried Naye{~COMBINING BREVE~}nayezgani. \"You must give her medicine to make her well  again.\" The Snake then sang his songs and made medicine until the girl  became again robust and beautiful.    As already mentioned, the performance of this ceremony extends through a  period of four days and four nights. The day preceding is spent in  preparation: the head of the family of the sick person makes ready for a  feast, and helpers build a corral of pinon and spruce branches. This  corral is circular, about forty yards in diameter and six feet high, with  an opening at the east. To the west, close to the fence, is the medicine  _kozhan_. The latter part of each morning of the four days is spent by the  medicine-man and his assistants in the _kozhan_, where a dry-painting of  blue, black, yellow, and red earths is made in the shape of a snake lying  in a circle with a space between the head and the tail. The circle is  about six feet in diameter, and within it are represented numerous  animals: the bear, turkey, deer, eagle, buffalo, elk, badger, gopher, and  others. A decoction is mixed in an earthen bowl and the patient is  summoned. Sand from the various parts of the painting are sprinkled on the  corresponding parts of his body, and the medicine mixture is given him to  drink.    The night portions of the ceremony begin shortly after dark. The  medicine-man and any persons who know the songs gather in the _kozhan_ and  sing, accompanied with a drum made of a basket inverted over a hole in the  ground and covered with a buffalo skin, the head toward the east. The hole  represents the pit in the legend, the basket the one the girls were  weaving, and a figure interwoven in the latter symbolizes the butterfly of  the story. The beating of the drum is varied at intervals by the use of a  leg-bone of a mountain sheep rasped quickly over a notched stick. Any men  of the tribe may enter the _kozhan_, and even a white man who is well  known. The songs consist of recitals of the powers of the medicine-man and  invocations to the various animals, as the bear, snake, and mountain  sheep. Some of the songs consist merely in naming the parts of the  animal's body, while others are supposed to be those used by the Bear and  the Snake in the legend. After singing these songs for about three hours,  with intervals of rest, the dancing begins. On each side of the enclosure  are three fires. Behind these on the north side are the men, on the south  the women; thus a large open space is bounded by the two lines of fires,  the _kozhan_, and the opening of the corral. Two women walk slowly into  this space, their heads modestly bent. They stop, and a young man  approaches to ascertain with whom they would dance. He then finds the  desired persons, takes each by the arm, and"]]]
