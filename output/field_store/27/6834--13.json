Anawrata in indignation collected an army,  marched against the Talaings and ended by carrying off to Pagan not  only elephant loads of scriptures and relics, but also all the Talaing  monks and nobles with the king himself.[149] The Pitakas were  stored in a splendid pagoda and Anawrata sent to Ceylon[150] for  others which were compared with the copies obtained from Thaton in  order to settle the text.[151]    For 200 years, that is from about 1060 A.D. until the later decades of  the thirteenth century, Pagan was a great centre of Buddhist culture  not only for Burma but for the whole east, renowned alike for its  architecture and its scholarship. The former can still be studied in  the magnificent pagodas which mark its site. Towards the end of his  reign Anawrata made not very successful attempts to obtain relics from  China and Ceylon and commenced the construction of the Shwe Zigon  pagoda. He died before it was completed but his successors, who  enjoyed fairly peaceful reigns, finished the work and constructed  about a thousand other buildings among which the most celebrated is  the Ananda temple erected by King Kyansitha.[152]    Pali literature in Burma begins with a little grammatical treatise  known as Karika and composed in 1064 A.D. by the monk Dhammasenapati  who lived in the monastery attached to this temple. A number of other  works followed. Of these the most celebrated was the Saddaniti of  Aggavamsa (1154), a treatise on the language of the Tipitaka  which became a classic not only in Burma but in Ceylon. A singular  enthusiasm for linguistic studies prevailed especially in the reign of  Kyocva (_c._ 1230), when even women are said to have been  distinguished for the skill and ardour which they displayed in  conquering the difficulties of Pali grammar. Some treatises on the  Abhidhamma were also produced.    Like Mohammedanism, Hinayanist Buddhism is too simple and definite to  admit much variation in doctrine, but its clergy are prone to violent  disputes about apparently trivial questions. In the thirteenth century  such disputes assumed grave proportions in Burma. About 1175 A.D. a  celebrated elder named Uttarajiva accompanied by his pupil  Chapata left for Ceylon. They spent some years in study at the  Mahavihara and Chapata received ordination there. He returned to  Pagan with four other monks and maintained that valid ordination could  be conferred only through the monks of the Mahavihara, who alone had  kept the succession unbroken. He with his four companions, having  received this ordination, claimed power to transmit it, but he  declined to recognize Burmese orders. This pretension aroused a storm  of opposition, especially from the Talaing monks. They maintained that  Arahanta who had reformed Buddhism under Anawrata was spiritually  descended from the missionaries sent by Asoka, who were as well  qualified to administer ordination as Mahinda. But Chapata was not  only a man of learning and an author[153] but also a vigorous  personality and in favour at Court. He had the best of the contest and  succeeded in making the Talaing school appear as seceders from  orthodoxy. There thus arose a distinction between the Sinhalese or  later school and the old Burmese school, who regarded one another as  schismatics. A scandal was caused in the Sinhalese community by  Rahula, the ablest of Chapata's disciples, who fell in love with an  actress and wished to become a layman. His colleagues induced him to  leave the country for decency's sake and peace was restored but  subsequently, after Chapata's death, the remaining three  disciples[154] fell out on questions of discipline rather than  doctrine and founded three factions, which can hardly be called  schools, although they refused to keep the Uposatha days together. The  light of religion shone brightest at Pagan early in the thirteenth  century while these three brethren were alive and the Sasanavamsa  states that at least three Arhats lived in the city. But the power of  Pagan collapsed under attacks from both Chinese and Shans at the end  of the century and the last king became a monk under the  compulsion of Shan chiefs. The deserted city appears to have lost its  importance as a religious centre, for the ecclesiastical chronicles  shift the scene elsewhere.    The two Shan states which arose from the ruin of Pagan, namely Panya  (Vijayapura) and Sagaing (Jeyyapura), encouraged religion and  learning. Their existence probably explains the claim made in Siamese  inscriptions of about 1300 that the territory of Siam extended to  Hamsavati or Pegu and this contact of Burma and Siam was of great  importance for it must be the origin of Pali Buddhism in Siam which  otherwise remains unexplained.    After the fall of the two Shan states in 1364, Ava (or Ratnapura)  which was founded in the same year gradually became the religious  centre of Upper Burma and remained so during several centuries. But  it did not at first supersede older towns inasmuch as the loss of  political independence did not always involve the destruction of  monasteries. Buddhism also flourished in Pegu and the Talaing country  where the vicissitudes of the northern kingdoms did not affect its  fortunes.    Anawrata had transported the most eminent Theras of Thaton to Pagan  and the old Talaing school probably suffered temporarily. Somewhat  later we hear that the Sinhalese school was introduced into these  regions by Sariputta,[155] who had been ordained at Pagan. About the  same time two Theras of Martaban, preceptors of the Queen, visited  Ceylon and on returning to their own land after being ordained at the  Mahavihara considered themselves superior to other monks. But the old  Burmese school continued to exist. Not much literature was produced in  the south. Sariputta was the author of a Dhammathat or code, the first  of a long series of law books based upon Manu. Somewhat later Mahayasa  of Thaton (_c._ 1370) wrote several grammatical works.    The most prosperous period for Buddhism in Pegu was the reign of  Dhammaceti, also called Ramadhipati (1460-1491). He was not of the  royal family, but a simple monk who helped a princess of Pegu to  escape from the Burmese court where she was detained. In 1453 this  princess became Queen of Pegu and Dhammaceti left his monastery to  become her prime minister, son-in-law and ultimately her  successor. But though he had returned to the world his heart was with  the Church. He was renowned for his piety no less than for his  magnificence and is known to modern scholars as the author of the  Kalyani inscriptions,[156] which assume the proportions of a treatise  on ecclesiastical laws and history. Their chief purpose is to settle  an intricate and highly technical question, namely the proper method  of defining and consecrating a _sima_. This word, which means  literally _boundary_, signifies a plot of ground within which Uposatha  meetings, ordinations and other ceremonies can take place. The  expression occurs in the Vinaya Pitaka,[157] but the area there  contemplated seems to be an ecclesiastical district within which the  Bhikkhus were obliged to meet for Uposatha. The modern _sima_ is much  smaller,[158] but more important since it is maintained that valid  ordination can be conferred only within its limits. To Dhammaceti the  question seemed momentous, for as he explains, there were in southern  Burma six schools who would not meet for Uposatha. These were, first  the Camboja[159] school (identical with the Arahanta school) who  claimed spiritual descent from the missionaries sent by Asoka to  Suvarnabhumi, and then five divisions of the Sinhalese school,  namely the three founded by Chapata's disciples as already related  and two more founded by the theras of Martaban. Dhammaceti accordingly  sent a mission to Ceylon charged to obtain an authoritative ruling as  to the proper method of consecrating a _sima_ and conferring  ordination. On their return a locality known as the Kalyanisima was  consecrated in the manner prescribed by the Mahavihara and during  three years all the Bhikkhus of Dhammaceti's kingdom were reordained  there. The total number reached 15,666, and the king boasts that he  had thus purified religion and made the school of the Mahavihara the  only sect, all other distinctions being obliterated.    There can be little doubt that in the fifteenth century Burmese  Buddhism had assumed the form which it still has, but was this form  due to indigenous tradition or to imitation of Ceylon? Five periods  merit attention. (_a_) In the sixth century, and probably several  centuries earlier, Hinayanism was known in Lower Burma. The  inscriptions attesting its existence are written in Pali and in a  south Indian alphabet. (_b_) Anawrata (1010-1052) purified the  Buddhism of Upper Burma with the help of scriptures obtained from the  Talaing country, which were compared with other scriptures brought  from Ceylon. (_c_) About 1200 Chapata and his pupils who had studied  in Ceylon and received ordination there refused to recognize the  Talaing monks and two hostile schools were founded, predominant at  first in Upper and Lower Burma respectively. (_d_) About 1250 the  Sinhalese school, led by Sariputta and others, began to make conquests  in Lower Burma at the expense of the Talaing school. (_e_) Two  centuries later, about 1460, Dhammaceti of Pegu boasts that he has  purified religion and made the school of the Mahavihara, that is the  most orthodox form of the Sinhalese school, the only sect.    In connection with these data must be taken the important statement  that the celebrated Tantrist Atisa studied in Lower Burma about  1000 A.D. Up to a certain point the conclusion seems clear. Pali  Hinayanism in Burma was old: intercourse with southern India and  Ceylon tended to keep it pure, whereas intercourse with Bengal and  Orissa, which must"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1685"],[0,"The Mystery of the Yellow Room (#14)"],[1,"ze; they were fixed on Monsieur Robert Darzac, who was looking  anxiously at the impression left by his feet side by side with the  elegant footmarks. There was not a particle of difference between them!    We thought he was about to faint. His eyes, bulging with terror, avoided  us, while his right hand, with a spasmodic movement, twitched at the  beard that covered his honest, gentle, and now despairing face. At  length regaining his self-possession, he bowed to us, and remarking, in  a changed voice, that he was obliged to return to the chateau, left us.    \"The deuce!\" exclaimed Rouletabille.    He, also, appeared to be deeply concerned. From his pocket-book he  took a piece of white paper as I had seen him do before, and with his  scissors, cut out the shape of the neat bootmarks that were on the  ground. Then he fitted the new paper pattern with the one he had  previously made--the two were exactly alike. Rising, Rouletabille  exclaimed again: \"The deuce!\" Presently he added: \"Yet I believe  Monsieur Robert Darzac to be an honest man.\" He then led me on the road  to the Donjon Inn, which we could see on the highway, by the side of a  small clump of trees.          CHAPTER X. \"We Shall Have to Eat Red Meat--Now\"      The Donjon Inn was of no imposing appearance; but I like these  buildings with their rafters blackened with age and the smoke of their  hearths--these inns of the coaching-days, crumbling erections that will  soon exist in the memory only. They belong to the bygone days, they are  linked with history. They make us think of the Road, of those days when  highwaymen rode.    I saw at once that the Donjon Inn was at least two centuries  old--perhaps older. Under its sign-board, over the threshold, a man with  a crabbed-looking face was standing, seemingly plunged in unpleasant  thought, if the wrinkles on his forehead and the knitting of his brows  were any indication.    When we were close to him, he deigned to see us and asked us, in a tone  anything but engaging, whether we wanted anything. He was, no doubt,  the not very amiable landlord of this charming dwelling-place. As we  expressed a hope that he would be good enough to furnish us with a  breakfast, he assured us that he had no provisions, regarding us, as he  said this, with a look that was unmistakably suspicious.    \"You may take us in,\" Rouletabille said to him, \"we are not policemen.\"    \"I'm not afraid of the police--I'm not afraid of anyone!\" replied the  man.    I had made my friend understand by a sign that we should do better not  to insist; but, being determined to enter the inn, he slipped by the man  on the doorstep and was in the common room.    \"Come on,\" he said, \"it is very comfortable here.\"    A good fire was blazing in the chimney, and we held our hands to the  warmth it sent out; it was a morning in which the approach of winter  was unmistakable. The room was a tolerably large one, furnished with two  heavy tables, some stools, a counter decorated with rows of bottles of  syrup and alcohol. Three windows looked out on to the road. A coloured  advertisement lauded the many merits of a new vermouth. On the  mantelpiece was arrayed the innkeeper's collection of figured  earthenware pots and stone jugs.    \"That's a fine fire for roasting a chicken,\" said Rouletabille. \"We have  no chicken--not even a wretched rabbit,\" said the landlord.    \"I know,\" said my friend slowly; \"I know--We shall have to eat red  meat--now.\"    I confess I did not in the least understand what Rouletabille meant  by what he had said; but the landlord, as soon as he heard the words,  uttered an oath, which he at once stifled, and placed himself at our  orders as obediently as Monsieur Robert Darzac had done, when he heard  Rouletabille's prophetic sentence--\"The presbytery has lost nothing of  its charm, nor the garden its brightness.\" Certainly my friend knew  how to make people understand him by the use of wholly incomprehensible  phrases. I observed as much to him, but he merely smiled. I should have  proposed that he give me some explanation; but he put a finger to his  lips, which evidently signified that he had not only determined not to  speak, but also enjoined silence on my part.    Meantime the man had pushed open a little side door and called to  somebody to bring him half a dozen eggs and a piece of beefsteak. The  commission was quickly executed by a strongly-built young woman with  beautiful blonde hair and large, handsome eyes, who regarded us with  curiosity.    The innkeeper said to her roughly:    \"Get out!--and if the Green Man comes, don't let me see him.\"    She disappeared. Rouletabille took the eggs, which had been brought to  him in a bowl, and the meat which was on a dish, placed all carefully  beside him in the chimney, unhooked a frying-pan and a gridiron, and  began to beat up our omelette before proceeding to grill our beefsteak.  He then ordered two bottles of cider, and seemed to take as little  notice of our host as our host did of him. The landlord let us do our  own cooking and set our table near one of the windows.    Suddenly I heard him mutter:    \"Ah!--there he is.\"    His face had changed, expressing fierce hatred. He went and glued  himself to one of the windows, watching the road. There was no need for  me to draw Rouletabille's attention; he had already left our omelette  and had joined the landlord at the window. I went with him.    A man dressed entirely in green velvet, his head covered with a  huntsman's cap of the same colour, was advancing leisurely, lighting  a pipe as he walked. He carried a fowling-piece slung at his back. His  movements displayed an almost aristocratic ease. He wore eye-glasses and  appeared to be about five and forty years of age. His hair as well as  his moustache were salt grey. He was remarkably handsome. As he passed  near the inn, he hesitated, as if asking himself whether or no he should  enter it; gave a glance towards us, took a few whiffs at his pipe, and  then resumed his walk at the same nonchalant pace.    Rouletabille and I looked at our host. His flashing eyes, his clenched  hands, his trembling lips, told us of the tumultuous feelings by which  he was being agitated.    \"He has done well not to come in here to-day!\" he hissed.    \"Who is that man?\" asked Rouletabille, returning to his omelette.    \"The Green Man,\" growled the innkeeper. \"Don't you know him? Then all  the better for you. He is not an acquaintance to make.--Well, he is  Monsieur Stangerson's forest-keeper.\"    \"You don't appear to like him very much?\" asked the reporter, pouring  his omelette into the frying-pan.    \"Nobody likes him, monsieur. He's an upstart who must once have had a  fortune of his own; and he forgives nobody because, in order to live, he  has been compelled to become a servant. A keeper is as much a servant as  any other, isn't he? Upon my word, one would say that he is the master  of the Glandier, and that all the land and woods belong to him. He'll  not let a poor creature eat a morsel of bread on the grass his grass!\"    \"Does he often come here?\"    \"Too often. But I've made him understand that his face doesn't please  me, and, for a month past, he hasn't been here. The Donjon Inn has never  existed for him!--he hasn't had time!--been too much engaged in paying  court to the landlady of the Three Lilies at Saint-Michel. A bad  fellow!--There isn't an honest man who can bear him. Why, the concierges  of the chateau would turn their eyes away from a picture of him!\"    \"The concierges of the chateau are honest people, then?\"    \"Yes, they are, as true as my name's Mathieu, monsieur. I believe them  to be honest.\"    \"Yet they've been arrested?\"    \"What does that prove?--But I don't want to mix myself up in other  people's affairs.\"    \"And what do you think of the murder?\"    \"Of the murder of poor Mademoiselle Stangerson?--A good girl much loved  everywhere in the country. That's what I think of it--and many things  besides; but that's nobody's business.\"    \"Not even mine?\" insisted Rouletabille.    The innkeeper looked at him sideways and said gruffly:    \"Not even yours.\"    The omelette ready, we sat down at table and were silently eating, when  the door was pushed open and an old woman, dressed in rags, leaning on  a stick, her head doddering, her white hair hanging loosely over her  wrinkled forehead, appeared on the threshold.    \"Ah!--there you are, Mother Angenoux!--It's long since we saw you last,\"  said our host.    \"I have been very ill, very nearly dying,\" said the old woman. \"If ever  you should have any scraps for the Bete du Bon Dieu--?\"    And she entered, followed by a cat, larger than any I had ever believed  could exist. The beast looked at us and gave so hopeless a miau that I  shuddered. I had never heard so lugubrious a cry.    As if drawn by the cat's cry a man followed the old woman in. It was the  Green Man. He saluted by raising his hand to his cap and seated himself  at a table near to ours.    \"A glass of cider, Daddy Mathieu,\" he said.    As the Green Man entered, Daddy Mathieu had started violently; but  visibly mastering himself he said:    \"I've no more cider; I served the last bottles to these gentlemen.\"    \"Then give me a glass of white wine,\" said the Green Man, without  showing the least surprise.    \"I've no more white wine--no more anything,\" said Daddy Mathieu,  surlily.    \"How is Madame Mathieu?\"    \"Quite well, thank you.\"    So the young Woman with the large, tender eyes, whom we had just seen,  was the wife of this repugnant and brutal rustic, whose jealousy seemed  to emphasise his physical ugliness.    Slamming the door behind him, the innkeeper left the room. Mother  Angenoux was still standing, leaning on her stick, the cat at her feet.    \"You've been ill, Mother Angenoux?--Is that why we have not seen you for  the last week?\" asked the Green Man.    \"Yes, Monsieur keeper. I have been able to get up but three times, to"]]]
