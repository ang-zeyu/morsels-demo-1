At his desire the  sheikhs wrote to the sherif of Mecca, to acquaint him that the pilgrims  would be protected, and that the caravans would find safety and  protection. The pasha of Cairo had followed Ibraham Bey to Belbeys.  Bonaparte wrote to him, as well as to the several pashas of St. Jean  d'Acre and Damascus, to assure them of the good disposition of the  French towards the Sublime Porte. The Arabs were struck by the character  of the young conqueror. They could not comprehend how it was that the  mortal who wielded the thunderbolt should be so merciful. They called  him the worthy son of the Prophet, the favourite of the great Allah, and  sang in the great mosque a litany in his praise.    Napoleon, in carrying out his policy of conciliating the natives, was  present at the Nile festival, which is one of the greatest in Egypt.  It was on the 18th of August that this festival was held. Bonaparte  had ordered the whole army to be under arms, and had drawn it up on the  banks of the canal. An immense concourse of people had assembled, who  beheld with joy the brave man of the West attending their festivals.    It was by such means that the young general, as profound a politician as  he was a great captain, contrived to ingratiate himself with the people.  While he flattered their prejudices for the moment, he laboured  to diffuse among them the light of science by the creation of the  celebrated Institute of Egypt. He collected the men of science and the  artists whom he had brought with him, and, associating with them some of  the best educated of his officers, established the institute, to which  he appropriated a revenue and one of the most spacious palaces in Cairo.    The conquest of the provinces of Lower and Middle Egypt had been  effected without difficulty, and had cost only a few skirmishes with the  Arabs. A forced march upon Belbeys had been sufficient to drive Ibrahim  Bey into Syria, where Desaix awaited the autumn for wresting Upper Egypt  from Murad Bey, who had retired thither with the wrecks of his army.    Fortune was, meanwhile, preparing for Bonaparte the most terrible of all  reverses. On leaving Alexandria, he had earnestly recommended to Admiral  Brueys to secure his squadron from the English, either by taking it into  the harbour of Alexandria, or by proceeding with it to Corfu; and he had  particularly enjoined him not to leave it in the road of Abukir, for it  was much better to fall in with an enemy when under sail than to receive  him at anchor. A warm discussion had arisen on the question whether  the ships of 80 and 120 guns could be carried into the harbour of  Alexandria. As to the smaller ships, there was no doubt; but the larger  would require lightening so much as to enable them to draw three feet  less water. For this purpose it would be necessary to take out their  guns, or to construct floats. On such conditions, Admiral Brueys  resolved not to take his squadron into the harbour. The time which he  spent, either in sounding the channels to the harbour, or in waiting for  news from Cairo, caused his own destruction.    Admiral Brueys was moored in the road of Abukir. This road is a very  regular semicircle, and his thirteen ships formed a line parallel to  the shore, and so disposed that he believed no British ship could pass  between him and the shore, if an attack were made.    Nelson, after visiting the Archipelago, and returning to the Adriatic,  Naples, and Sicily, had at length obtained the certain knowledge of  the landing of the French at Alexandria. He immediately steered in that  direction in order to seek and put to flight their squadron. He sent a  frigate to look out for it, and to reconnoitre its position. The English  frigate, having made her observations, rejoined Nelson, who, being  informed of all the particulars, immediately stood in for Abukir, and  arrived there August 1, 1798, at about six o'clock in the evening.  Admiral Brueys was at dinner. He immediately ordered the signal for  battle to be given; but so unprepared was the squadron to receive the  enemy, that the hammocks were not stowed away on board any of the ships,  and part of the crews were on shore. The admiral despatched officers to  send the seamen on board, and to demand part of those who were in the  transports. He had no conception that Nelson would dare to attack him  the same evening, and conceived that he should have time to receive the  reinforcements for which he had applied.    Nelson resolved to attack immediately, and to push in between the French  ships and the shore at all hazards. \"Before this time to-morrow\" said  he, \"I shall have gained a peerage or Westminster Abbey.\"    The number of vessels was equal on both sides, namely, thirteen ships  of war. The engagement lasted upwards of fifteen hours. All the crews  performed prodigies of valour. The brave Captain Du Petit-Thouars had  two of his limbs shot off. He ordered snuff to be brought him,  and remained on his quarter-deck, and, like Brueys, waited till a  cannon-ball despatched him. The entire French squadron, excepting the  two ships and two frigates carried off by Villeneuve, was destroyed.  Nelson had suffered so severely that he could not pursue the fugitives.  Such was the famous battle of Abukir, the most disastrous that  the French had ever sustained, and involved the most far-reaching  consequences. The fleet which had carried the French to Egypt, which  might have served to succour or to recruit them, which was to  second their movements on the coast of Syria,--had there been any to  execute,--which was to overawe the Porte, to force it to put up with  false reasoning, and to oblige it to wink at the invasion of Egypt,  which finally, in case of reverses, was to convey the French back to  their country,--that fleet was destroyed. The French ships were burned.  The news of this disaster spread rapidly in Egypt, and for a moment  filled the army with despair. Bonaparte received the tidings with  imperturbable composure. \"Well,\" he said, \"we must die in this country,  or get out of it as great as the ancients.\" He wrote to Kleber: \"This  will oblige us to do greater things than we intended. We must hold  ourselves in readiness.\" The great soul of Kleber was worthy of  this language: \"Yes,\" replied Kleber, \"we must do great things. I am  preparing my faculties.\" The courage of these men supported the army,  and restored its confidence.    Bonaparte strove to divert the thoughts of the soldiers by various  expeditions, and soon made them forget this disaster. On the festival of  the foundation of the republic, he endeavoured to give a new stimulus to  their imagination; he engraved on Pompey's Pillar the names of the first  forty soldiers slain in Egypt. They were the forty who had fallen in  the attack on Alexandria; and the names of these men, sprung from the  villages of France, were thus associated with the immortality of Pompey  and Alexander.    Bonaparte, after the battle of the Pyramids, found himself master of  Egypt. He began to establish himself there, and sent his generals into  the provinces to complete their conquest. Desaix, placed at the entrance  of Upper Egypt with a division of about three thousand men, was directed  to reduce the remnants of Murad Bey's force in that province. It was in  the preceding year (October, 1798), at the moment when the inundation  was over, that Desaix had commenced his expedition. The enemy had  retired before him, and did not wait for him till he reached Sediman;  there, on October 7th, Desaix fought a sanguinary battle with the  desperate remainder of Murad Bey's forces. Two thousand French had to  combat with four thousand Mamluks and eight thousand fellahs, intrenched  in the village of Sediman. The battle was conducted in the same manner  as that of the Pyramids, and like all those fought in Egypt. The fellahs  were behind the walls of the village, and the horse in the plain. The  field of battle was thickly strewn with slain. The French lost three  hundred men. Desaix continued his march during the whole winter, and,  after a series of actions, reduced Upper Egypt as far as the cataracts.  He made himself equally feared for his bravery and beloved for his  clemency. In Cairo, Bonaparte had been named Sultan Kebir, the Fire  Sultan. In Upper Egypt, Desaix was called the \"Just Sultan.\"    Bonaparte had meanwhile marched to Belbeys, to drive Ibrahim Bey into  Syria, and he had collected by the way the wrecks of the caravan of  Mecca, plundered by the Arabs. Returning to Cairo, he continued to  establish there an entirely French administration. Thus passed the  winter between 1798 and 1799 in the expectation of important events.  During this interval, Bonaparte received intelligence of the declaration  of war by the Porte, and of the preparations which it was making against  him with the aid of the English. Two armies were being formed, one at  Rhodes, the other in Syria. These two armies were to act simultaneously  in the spring of 1799, the one by landing at Abukir near Alexandria, the  other by crossing the desert which separates Syria from Egypt. Bonaparte  was instantly aware of his position, and determined, as was his custom,  to disconcert the enemy and to forestall any offensive movement by a  sudden attack. He could not cross the desert which parts Egypt from  Syria in summer, and he resolved to avail himself of the winter for  destroying the assemblages of troops forming at Acre, at Damascus,  and in the principal towns. Djezzar, the celebrated pasha of Acre, was  appointed seraskier of the army collected in Syria. Abd Allah Pasha of  Damascus commanded its advanced-guard, and had proceeded as far as the  fort of El Arish, which is the key to Egypt on the side next to Syria.  Bonaparte resolved to act immediately. He was in communication with the  tribes of the Lebanon.

The ceiling dipped so we were not able to stand  straight, and the guide said he had never gone farther; but to his  surprise here was a light boat which I am ready to admit he displayed no  eagerness to appropriate to his own use, and swimming about it, close to  shore, were numerous small, eyeless fish, pure white and perfectly  fearless; the first I had ever seen, and little beauties.    By burning magnesium ribbon we saw that the passage before us was a low  arch and occupied from wall to wall by water, the direction of the flow  being into another of somewhat greater size at right angles to that by  which we had come, and at the mouth of this lay the boat. The distance  we could see in either direction was of tantalizing shortness, and the  boat was provided with no means of guidance or control, save an  abundance of slender twine which secured it to a log of drift from the  outside; so I decided to leave my companions in charge of the main coil  of twine while I went on an excursion alone, there being not much  evident cause for apprehension as no living cow could ever have made the  trip to this favored spot.    Although the water looked perfectly placid, the boat drifted with  surprising speed, so that the two scared faces peering after me were  soon lost sight of. The channel was nowhere more than six feet wide,  consequently as the boat inclined to drive against either wall I was  able with care to keep it off the rocks with my hands, and in the same  way guide it around the sharp turns in safety. After several of these  turns there appeared the mouth of a passage so much smaller that the  roof was only twelve inches above the sides of the boat and I could  touch both walls at the same time. By running the boat across this it  was held in place by the current, and I could sit at ease and enjoy the  position, which even the least imaginative person can readily conceive  to have been a novel one.    The small eyeless fish had been noticeable in the water everywhere but  now came swimming about the boat in an astonishing multitude, and as  unconscious of any possible danger as bees in a flower garden. Having no  eyes, they were naturally undisturbed by the light, so the candle could  be held close to the water for a satisfactory examination of the happy  creatures.    They bore a striking resemblance to minnows, although a few were larger,  and it is claimed that four or five inches are sizes not unusual, but  they happened not to be on exhibition. Even dipping a hand into the  water in their midst occasioned no alarm, and they might have been  caught by dozens.    The guide now loudly called that he had fears of the twine being cut on  the sharp edges of rock, and that cutting off all possibility of the  boat's return, which being sufficiently reasonable, explorations were  indefinitely suspended, and a landing soon made. The camera and  flash-light were then prepared for taking a view, and a point of light  being needed to work by the nephew was asked to sit in the boat with his  candle, to which he readily consented; but judging from the developed  picture it may be doubted if his pleasure at the time was extremely  keen.    On leaving the cave the guide said it would not be necessary to return  to the upper end of the Gulf in order to reach the surface, as the  ascent could be made in another place; and leading the way to the left  of the entrance he started up the nearly perpendicular wall, more than  two hundred feet high, by a sort of \"blind trail\" that would have caused  a mountain sheep to sigh for wings, but it was very beautiful.    We walked over to the wagon road on the high ridge above the middle of  the bridge and going down the forest-clad slopes to the perpendicular  wall in which is the smaller of the great arches, admired from this fair  point of view the marvelous grandeur of one of the greatest natural  wonders.    The weather being perfect after a rain the day before, there was no need  of haste to get indoors, so we lingered into the afternoon and then  drove to the Mammoth Spring, in Arkansas, a short distance south of the  Missouri state line, where the Cave River, just visited, comes to the  surface in a bounding spring of great force. The distance being little  less than nine miles.    The basin filled by the Spring might be called a lake, as its size of  two hundred by three hundred feet gives it that appearance, and the  color is a remarkable deep blue. The volume of water is so nearly  uniform that the height seldom varies more than two or three inches,  but three years ago a storm of unusual violence carried out most of the  native fish, and in restocking from Government supplies, the clear, cold  water suggested an experiment with mountain trout which are found to be  doing well.    Where Mammoth Spring flows out its power is utilized by a flour mill on  one bank and a cotton mill on the other, and the water flowing on forms  Spring River, well known for the charm of its beautiful scenery.    This Spring is described by Dr. David Dale Owen in his First Report of a  Geological Reconnoissance of the northern counties of Arkansas, 1857 and  1858, pp. 60-61.          CHAPTER VIII.    THE BLACK HILLS AND BAD LANDS.      In order to thoroughly appreciate and enjoy the wonderful caves of South  Dakota, which are found within the limits of the Black Hills, it is  necessary to have some knowledge of the geological character and history  of that peculiar region.    Prof. J.E. Todd, State Geologist, in his \"Preliminary Report on the  Geology of South Dakota,\" gives an interesting \"Historical Sketch of  Explorations\" in his state, beginning with the expedition of Captains  Lewis and Clark to the upper Missouri regions in 1804-6 to explore that  portion of the recent Louisiana Purchase for the government and notify  the Indians of the transfer; and including all other important  expeditions since that time down to his own official tour of the Black  Hills and Bad Lands in 1894. His own descriptions are so concise and  graphic as to invite quotation. Of the Hills he says:    \"The Black Hills have an area of five-thousand square miles of a rudely  elliptical form with its major axis, approximately, north-northwest.  Most of this area lies within our state. The true limit of the Hills is  quite distinctly marked by a sharp ridge of sandstone, three hundred to  six hundred feet in relative height, which becomes broader and more  plateau-like towards the north and south ends. This ridge is separated  from the higher mass of hills within by a valley one to three miles in  breadth, which is known as the Red Valley, from its brick-red soil, or  the 'race course,' which name was given it by the Indians because of its  open and smooth character, affording easy and rapid passage around the  Hills. The junction of the outer base of the Hills with the surrounding  table lands has an altitude of three thousand, five hundred to four  thousand feet. Within this Red Valley one gradually ascends the outer  slope of the Hills and soon enters, at an altitude of four thousand five  hundred or five thousand feet, the woody portion of the region. This  outer slope varies greatly in width and is underlaid by older  sedimentary rocks, cut in almost every direction by narrow deep canons.  This feature covers nearly the whole of the western half of the Hills  proper, where erosion has been less active on account of its distance  from the main channels of drainage. Usually, from the broken interior  edge of this slope or sedimentary plateau one descends a bluff or  escarpment, and enters the central area of slates, granite, and  quartzites, which is carved into high ridges and sharp peaks cut by many  narrow and deep valleys and ravines and generally thickly timbered with  the common pine of the Rocky Mountains. Toward the south, about Harney  Peak, the surface is peculiarly rugged and difficult to traverse. Toward  the north, also, about Terry and Custer peaks, a smaller rugged surface  appears; but in the central area between and extending west of the  Harney range is a region which is characterized by open and level parks  much lower than the surrounding peaks and ridges.\"    The Archaean rocks which form the core of the Hills mark the center of  the various uplifts which have attended their formation and controlled  their history. The coarse granite of Harney Peak indicating that, as the  central point of the earliest upheaval, and the three porphyries known  as rhyolite, trachyte, and phonolite, showing the uplifts of later  periods to have had their centers a little more to the north, but the  entire area is said to be only about sixty miles long and twenty-five  miles in width. It is exceptionally rough and mountainous, and  consequently has great charms for the lover of fine scenery. Erosion has  only partially denuded the peaks of the sedimentary rocks through which  they were thrust up, or by which they were overlaid during the earlier  part of several subsequent periods of submersion. The Hills, in these  remote times, led but a doubtful and precarious existence, being now an  isolated island rising out of a shallow sea, and then, owing to a  general subsidence, submerged in the ocean to so great a depth that even  Harney Peak is supposed to have almost, if not entirely, disappeared.  This up and down motion continued at intervals until the Fox Hills epoch  of the Cretaceous Age, at the close of which the sea retired forever  from that portion of the country. In the next epoch fresh water work  began and extensive marshes were formed, with an abundant growth of  vegetation and reptiles. There was also much volcanic violence which  resulted in the fine scenery in the north end of the Black Hills, and  probably opened the"]]]
