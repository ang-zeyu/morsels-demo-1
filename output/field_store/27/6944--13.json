(#14)"],[1,"assification, he wrote in quotations, 'An  invisible thread in all ages runs through this immense diversity,  exhibiting as a general result that there is a continual progress in  development ending in man, the four classes of vertebrates presenting  the intermediate steps, and the invertebrates the constant accessory  accompaniment. Have we not here the manifestation of a mind as powerful  as prolific? an act of intelligence as sublime as provident? the marks  of goodness as infinite as wise? the most palpable demonstration of the  existence of a personal God, author of all this; ruler of the universe,  and the dispenser of all good? This at least is what I read in the works  of creation.' And it was what he ever read, and with profound awe and  adoration. To this exalted faith he was inflexibly loyal. The laws of  nature were to him the eternal Word of God.    \"His repugnance to Darwinism grew in great part from his apprehension of  its atheistical tendency,--an apprehension which I confess I cannot  share; for I forget not that these theories, now in the ascendent, are  maintained by not a few devout Christian men, and while they appear to  me unproved and incapable of demonstration, I could admit them without  parting with one iota of my faith in God and Christ. Yet I cannot but  sympathize most strongly with him in the spirit in which he resisted  what seemed to him lese-majesty against the sovereign of the universe.  Nor was his a theoretical faith. His whole life, in its broad  philanthropy, in its pervading spirit of service, in its fidelity to  arduous trusts and duties, and in its simplicity and truthfulness,  bespoke one who was consciously fulfilling a mission from God to his  fellow-men.\"    The words \"evolution\" and \"Darwinism\" are so often in this country, but  not in Europe, used interchangeably, that it is conceivable that Dr.  Peabody could retain his faith in God, and yet admit the doctrine of  evolution. But it is not conceivable that any man should adopt the main  element of Mr. Darwin's theory, viz., the denial of all final causes,  and the assertion, that since the first creation of matter and life, God  has left the universe to the control of unintelligent physical causes,  so that all the phenomena of the plants and animals, all that is in man,  and all that has ever happened on the earth, is due to physical force,  and yet retain his faith in Christ. On that theory, there have been no  supernatural revelation, no miracles; Christ is not risen, and we are  yet in our sins. It is not thus that this matter is regarded abroad. The  Christians of Germany say that the only alternative these theories leave  us, is Heathenism or Christianity; \"Heidenthum oder Christenthum, Die  Frage der Zeit.\"      _Janet._    Janet, a professor of philosophy, is the author of a book on the  Materialism of Buechner.[34] The greater part of the last chapter of his  work is devoted to Darwinism. He says, \"Dr. Buechner invoked (Darwin's  book) as a striking confirmation of his doctrine.\" (p. 154) What  Buechner's doctrine is has been shown on a previous page. The points of  coincidence between Darwin's system and his are, that both regard mind  as a mere function of living matter; and both refer all the organs and  organisms of living things to the unconscious, unintelligent operation  of physical causes. Buechner's way of accounting for complicated organs  was, \"that the energy of the elements and forces of matter, which in  their fated and accidental occurrence must have produced innumerable  forms, which must needs limit each other mutually, and correspond,  apparently, the one with the other, as if they were made for that  purpose. Out of all those forms, they only have survived which were  adapted, in some manner, to the conditions of the medium in which they  were placed.\" (p. 30) This is very clumsy. No wonder Buechner preferred  Darwin's method. The two systems are, indeed, exactly the same, but Mr.  Darwin has a much more winning way of presenting it.    Professor Janet does not seem to have much objection to the doctrine of  evolution in itself; it is the denial of teleology that he regards as  the fatal element of Mr. Darwin's theory. \"According to us,\" he says,  \"the true stumbling-block of Mr. Darwin's theory, the perilous and  slippery point, is the passage from artificial to natural selection; it  is when he wants to establish that a blind and designless nature has  been able to obtain, by the occurrence of circumstances, the same  results which man obtains by thoughtful and well calculated industry.\"  (p. 174)    Towards the end of his volume he says: \"We shall conclude by a general  observation. Notwithstanding the numerous objections we have raised  against Mr. Darwin's theory, we do not declare ourselves hostile to a  system of which zooelogists are the only competent judges. We are neither  for nor against the transmutation of species, neither for nor against  the principle of natural selection. The only positive conclusion of our  debate is this: no principle hitherto known, neither the action of  media, nor habit, nor natural selection, can account for organic  adaptations without the intervention of the principle of finality.  Natural selection, unguided, submitted to the laws of a pure mechanism,  and exclusively determined by accidents, seems to me, under another  name, the chance proclaimed by Epicurus, equally barren, equally  incomprehensible; on the other hand, natural selection guided beforehand  by a provident will, directed towards a precise end by intentional laws,  might be the means which nature has selected to pass from one stage of  being to another, from one form to another, to bring to perfection life  throughout the universe, and to rise by a continuous process from the  monad to man. Now, I ask Mr. Darwin himself, what interest has he in  maintaining that natural selection is not guided--not directed? What  interest has he in substituting accidental causes for every final cause?  I cannot see. Let him admit that in natural, as well as in artificial  selection, there may be a choice and direction; his principle  immediately becomes much more fruitful than it was before. His  hypothesis, then, whilst having the advantage of exempting science from  the necessity of introducing the personal and miraculous intervention of  God in the creation of each species, yet would be free from the  banishing out of the universe an all-provident thought, and of  submitting everything to blind and brute chance.\" (pp. 198, 199)  Professor Janet asks far too much of Mr. Darwin. To ask him to give up  his denial of final causes is like asking the Romanists to give up the  Pope. That principle is the life and soul of his system.    FOOTNOTE:    [34] _The Materialism of the Present Day: a Critique of Dr. Buechner's  System_. By Paul Janet, Member of the Institute of France, Professor of  Philosophy at the Paris Faculte des Lettres. Translated from the French,  by Gustave Masson, B. A. London and Paris, 1867.      _M. Flourens._    M. Flourens, recently dead, was one of the earliest and most pronounced  opponents of Darwinism. He published in 1864 his \"Examen du Livre de M.  Darwin sur l'Origine des Especes.\" His position as Member of the  Academie Francaise, and Perpetual Secretary of the Academie des  Sciences, or Institut de France, vouch for his high rank among the  French naturalists. His connection with the Jardin des Plantes gave him  enlarged opportunities for biological experiments. The result of his own  experience, as well as the experience of other observers, was, as he  expresses it, his solemn conviction that species are fixed and not  transmutable. No ingenuity of device could render hybrids fertile. \"They  never establish an intermediate species.\" It is, therefore, to the  doctrine of evolution his attention is principally directed.  Nevertheless, he is no less struck by Darwin's way of excluding all  intelligence and design in his manner of speaking of nature. On this  point he quotes the language of Cuvier, who says: \"Nature has been  personified. Living beings have been called the works of nature. The  general bearing of these creatures to each other has become the laws of  nature. It is thus while considering Nature as a being endowed with  intelligence and will, but in its power limited and secondary, that it  may be said that she watches incessantly over the maintenance of her  work; that she does nothing in vain, and always acts by the most simple  means.... It is easy to see how puerile are those who give nature a  species of individual existence distinct from the Creator, and from the  law which He has impressed upon the movements and peculiarities of the  forms given by Him to living things, and which He makes to act upon  their bodies with a peculiar force and reason.\" Older writers, says  Flourens, in speaking of Nature, \"gave to her inclinations, intentions,  and views, and horrors (of a vacuum), and sports,\" etc. He says that one  of the principal objects of his book is to show how Mr. Darwin \"has  deluded himself, and perhaps others, by a constant abuse of figurative  language.\" \"He plays with Nature as he pleases, and makes her do  whatsoever he wishes.\" When we remember that Mr. Darwin defines Nature  to be the aggregate of physical forces, we see how, in attributing  everything to Nature, he effectually excludes the supernatural.    In his volume of \"Lay Sermons, Reviews,\" etc., Professor Huxley has a  very severe critique on M. Flourens's book. He says little, however, in  reference to teleology, except in one paragraph, in which we read: \"M.  Flourens cannot imagine an unconscious selection; it is for him a  contradiction in terms.\" Huxley's answer is, \"The winds and waves of the  Bay of Biscay have not much consciousness, and yet they have with great  care 'selected,' from an infinity of masses of silex, all grains of sand  below a certain size and have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19200"],[0,"The History of a Lie: \"The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion\" (#14)"],[1,"gosudarstvennoj  moshhi vseh evropejskih stran, cherez padenie etoj moshhi,  ot ekonomicheskago razstrojstva i razorenija, vsjudu vnosimago  Sionom cherez nravstvennyj upadok.

Several years later he  resumed his anti-Semitic agitation and became one of the most vicious  vilifiers of the Jewish people on the eve of the notorious Beilis affair  which was staged by the Russian government for the purpose of  discrediting the Jews and of justifying the Russian governmental  anti-Jewish policy before the world. After the collapse of the Beilis  prosecution, which involved the absurd charge of ritual murder,  Lutostansky approached several prominent wealthy Jews with an offer to  retract his new charges against the Jews, provided they would pay him a  certain amount of money for his book. The Jews declined to have anything  to do with the charlatan who had caused so much harm to the Jews of  Russia by his monstrous accusations. His works attracted special  attention because of the fact that they were endorsed and supported by  Russian Grand Dukes and by the Dowager Empress of Russia.    While examining one of his books entitled, \"The Talmud and the Jews,\"  published in 1907, in which he promised the publication of \"the  Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion\" in his forthcoming volume, I came  upon an amazing passage in his introduction, outlining an alleged secret  plan of the Jews to gain world domination, which I find reproduced,  word for word, with but a few phrases changed, in the epilogue of \"the  Russian mystic,\" Sergius Nilus. Did Sergius Nilus plagiarize  Lutostansky? Or was it Lutostansky who plagiarized Nilus? Or were they  one and the same person? At any rate, both served the purposes of the  \"Black Hundreds\" against the Jews, and both employed the same weapons.    Here is a translation of Lutostansky's introduction:         From Lutostansky's Introduction, 1907         EXPLANATION OF THE ZIONIST SYMBOLIC SNAKE         \"The political plan represented in the form of a snake is very old       and was devised by the Judaean sages in theory, and in the course       of historical developments it is elaborated and augmented by their       initiated followers. These sages decided to conquer the world       peacefully for Zion, by the cunning of the symbolic snake. The head       of the snake represents the sages of Zion, and the body--the Judaean       nation. Crawling into the bosoms of governments, this snake       undermines eats away all non-Judaean governmental forces, as they       grow on various continents, but especially in Europe, which it is       to do also in the future, carefully following the outlined plan,       until the cycle of the road travelled by it is completed by the       return of the head of the snake to Zion,--that is until this snake       will include within the sphere of its circle the whole of Europe,       and through Europe the whole world. First of all they are       endeavoring to introduce everywhere irreligion and moral decadence,       utilizing all forces they have won economically in order to drag       the other continents into the sphere of their cycle. As the return       of the head of the snake could be accomplished only over the razed       ruins of the governmental power of all European countries, through       the collapse of this power, through economic disorganization and       ruin, introduced by Zion everywhere by means of moral decadence.       Corruption is introduced with the aid of Jewesses under the guise       of French or Italian women, who even undergo fictitious baptism for       these purposes and then become the wives of prominent men, like the       biblical Esther, and they are always accompanied by their       Mordecais, and make their politics for the good of the Jews. These       so-called French and Italian women are the best carriers of       immorality from place to place. These women are used for those who,       because of them, are always in need of money, and therefore       willingly barter their conscience to secure money at any cost. The       money is reality only loaned to such conscience-barterers, for it       quickly comes back to the hands of those loaned the money, as it       is squandered with the aid of these women soon after they receive       it. The Zionist nets are spread out on all the roads of the goyim       (gentiles) and the cycle of the snake is moving along in the       Twentieth century with the speed of an express train towards its       goal.         \"The complete outline of all the secret protocols of the Zionist       Jewish sages, the entire plan of the conquest of the whole world,       will be included in the next (seventh) volume of 'The Talmud and       the Jews.'\"    And this is a facsimile reproduction and translation of Sergius Nilus's  epilogue taken from the copy of the \"Protocols\" in the British Museum,  from which the American translation was made.
