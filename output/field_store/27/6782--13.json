It would be absurd to credit early man with conscious speculations  like these, belonging more properly to the twentieth century; yet it is  incontrovertible, I think, that in SOME ways the primitive peoples, with  their swift subconscious intuitions and their minds unclouded by mere  book knowledge, perceived truths to which we moderns are blind. Like  the animals they arrived at their perceptions without (individual) brain  effort; they knew things without thinking. When they did THINK of course  they went wrong. Their budding science easily went astray. Religion  with them had as yet taken no definite shape; science was equally  protoplasmic; and all they had was a queer jumble of the two in the form  of Magic. When at a later time Science gradually defined its outlook and  its observations, and Religion, from being a vague subconscious feeling,  took clear shape in the form of gods and creeds, then mankind gradually  emerged into the stage of evolution IN WHICH WE NOW ARE. OUR scientific  laws and doctrines are of course only temporary formulae, and so also  are the gods and the creeds of our own and other religions; but these  things, with their set and angular outlines, have served in the past  and will serve in the future as stepping-stones towards another kind of  knowledge of which at present we only dream, and will lead us on to  a renewed power of perception which again will not be the laborious  product of thought but a direct and instantaneous intuition like that of  the animals--and the angels.      To return to our Tree. Though primitive man did not speculate in modern  style on these things, I yet have no reasonable doubt that he felt (and  FEELS, in those cases where we can still trace the workings of his  mind) his essential relationship to the creatures of the forest more  intimately, if less analytically, than we do to-day. If the animals with  all their wonderful gifts are (as we readily admit) a veritable part  of Nature--so that they live and move and have their being more or less  submerged in the spirit of the great world around them--then Man, when  he first began to differentiate himself from them, must for a long  time have remained in this SUBconscious unity, becoming only distinctly  CONSCIOUS of it when he was already beginning to lose it. That early  dawn of distinct consciousness corresponded to the period of belief  in Magic. In that first mystic illumination almost every object was  invested with a halo of mystery or terror or adoration. Things were  either tabu, in which case they were dangerous, and often not to be  touched or even looked upon--or they were overflowing with magic grace  and influence, in which case they were holy, and any rite which released  their influence was also holy. William Blake, that modern prophetic  child, beheld a Tree full of angels; the Central Australian native  believes bushes to be the abode of spirits which leap into the bodies of  passing women and are the cause of the conception of children; Moses  saw in the desert a bush (perhaps the mimosa) like a flame of fire, with  Jehovah dwelling in the midst of it, and he put off his shoes for  he felt that the place was holy; Osiris was at times regarded as a  Tree-spirit (1); and in inscriptions is referred to as \"the solitary one  in the acacia\"--which reminds us curiously of the \"burning bush.\" The  same is true of others of the gods; in the old Norse mythology Ygdrasil  was the great branching World-Ash, abode of the soul of the universe;  the Peepul or Bo-tree in India is very sacred and must on no account be  cut down, seeing that gods and spirits dwell among its branches. It is  of the nature of an Aspen, and of little or no practical use, (2) but so  holy that the poorest peasant will not disturb it. The Burmese believe  the things of nature, but especially the trees, to be the abode of  spirits. \"To the Burman of to-day, not less than to the Greek of long  ago, all nature is alive. The forest and the river and the mountains  are full of spirits, whom the Burmans call Nats. There are all kinds of  Nats, good and bad, great and little, male and female, now living round  about us. Some of them live in the trees, especially in the huge figtree  that shades half-an-acre without the village; or among the fern-like  fronds of the tamarind.\" (3)       (1) The Golden Bough, iv, 339.     (2) Though the sap is said to contain caoutchouc.     (3) The Soul of a People, by H. Fielding (1902), p. 250.      There are also in India and elsewhere popular rites of MARRIAGE of women  (and men) to Trees; which suggest that trees were regarded as very  near akin to human beings! The Golden Bough (1) mentions many of these,  including the idea that some trees are male and others female. The  well-known Assyrian emblem of a Pine cone being presented by a priest to  a Palm-tree is supposed by E. B. Tylor to symbolize fertilization--the  Pine cone being masculine and the Palm feminine. The ceremony of the god  Krishna's marriage to a Basil plant is still celebrated in India down  to the present day; and certain trees are clasped and hugged by pregnant  women--the idea no doubt being that they bestow fertility on those  who embrace them. In other cases apparently it is the trees which are  benefited, since it is said that men sometimes go naked into the  Clove plantations at night in order by a sort of sexual intercourse to  fertilize them. (2)     (1) Vol. i, p. 40, Vol. iii, pp. 24 sq.     (2) Ibid., vol. ii, p. 98.      One might go on multiplying examples in this direction quite  indefinitely. There is no end to them. They all indicate--what was  instinctively felt by early man, and is perfectly obvious to all to-day  who are not blinded by \"civilization\" (and Herbert Spencer!) that the  world outside us is really most deeply akin to ourselves, that it is  not dead and senseless but intensely alive and instinct with feeling and  intelligence resembling our own. It is this perception, this conviction  of our essential unity with the whole of creation, which lay from the  first at the base of all Religion; yet at first, as I have said, was  hardly a conscious perception. Only later, when it gradually became more  conscious, did it evolve itself into the definite forms of the gods and  the creeds--but of that process I will speak more in detail presently.    The Tree therefore was a most intimate presence to the Man. It grew in  the very midst of his Garden of Eden. It had a magical virtue, which  his tentative science could only explain by chance analogies and  assimilations. Attractive and beloved and worshipped by reason of its  many gifts to mankind--its grateful shelter, its abounding fruits, its  timber, and other invaluable products--why should it not become the  natural emblem of the female, to whom through sex man's worship is ever  drawn? If the Snake has an unmistakable resemblance to the male organ in  its active state, the foliage of the tree or bush is equally remindful  of the female. What more clear than that the conjunction of Tree and  Serpent is the fulfilment in nature of that sex-mystery which is so  potent in the life of man and the animals? and that the magic ritual  most obviously fitted to induce fertility in the tribe or the herds  (or even the crops) is to set up an image of the Tree and the Serpent  combined, and for all the tribe-folk in common to worship and pay it  reverence. In the Bible with more or less veiled sexual significance  we have this combination in the Eden-garden, and again in the brazen  Serpent and Pole which Moses set up in the wilderness (as a cure for the  fiery serpents of lust); illustrations of the same are said to be found  in the temples of Egypt and of South India, and even in the ancient  temples of Central America. (1) In the myth of Hercules the golden  apples of the Hesperides garden are guarded by a dragon. The Etruscans,  the Persians and the Babylonians had also legends of the Fall of man  through a serpent tempting him to taste of the fruit of a holy Tree. And  De Gubernatis, (2) pointing out the phallic meaning of these stories,  says \"the legends concerning the tree of golden apples or figs which  yields honey or ambrosia, guarded by dragons, in which the life, the  fortune, the glory, the strength and the riches of the hero have their  beginning, are numerous among every people of Aryan origin: in India,  Persia, Russia, Poland, Sweden, Germany, Greece and Italy.\"     (1) See Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian Symbolism, by Thomas  Inman (Trubner, 1874), p. 55.     (2) Zoological Mythology, vol. ii, pp. 410 sq.      Thus we see the natural-magic tendency of the human mind asserting  itself. To some of us indeed this tendency is even greater in the case  of the Snake than in that of the Tree. W. H. Hudson, in Far Away  and Long Ago, speaks of \"that sense of something supernatural in  the serpent, which appears to have been universal among peoples in a  primitive state of culture, and still survives in some barbarous or  semi-barbarous countries.\" The fascination of the Snake--the fascination  of its mysteriously gliding movement, of its vivid energy, its  glittering eye, its intensity of life, combined with its fatal dart of  Death--is a thing felt even more by women than by men--and for a reason  (from what we have already said) not far to seek. It was the Woman who  in the story of the Fall was the first to listen to its suggestions.  No wonder that, as Professor Murray says, (1) the Greeks worshiped a  gigantic snake (Meilichios) the lord of Death and Life, with ceremonies  of appeasement, and sacrifices, long before they arrived at the worship  of Zeus and the Olympian gods.

Sometimes a spot will last for more than two hundred  days, recognizable through six or eight revolutions. Sometimes  a spot will last only half an hour.    The velocities indicated by these movements are incredible. An  up-rush and down-rush at the sides has been measured of twenty  miles a second; a side-rush or whirl, of one hundred and twenty  miles a second. These tempests rage from a few days to half a year,  traversing regions so wide that our Indian Ocean, the realm of  storms, is too small to be used for comparison; then, as they cease,  the advancing sides of the spots approach each other at the rate of  20,000 miles an hour; they strike together, and the rising spray  of fire leaps thousands of miles into space. It falls again into the  incandescent surge, rolls over mountains as the sea over pebbles, and  all this for eon after eon without sign of exhaustion or diminution.  All these swift succeeding Himalayas of fire, where one hundred  worlds could be buried, do not usually prevent the sun's appearing  to our far-off eyes as a perfect sphere.    [Page 94]  _What the Sun does for us._    To what end does this enormous power, this central source of power,  exist? That it could keep all these gigantic forces within itself  could not be expected. It is in a system where every atom is made  to affect every other atom, and every world to influence every  other. The Author of all lives only to do good, to send rain on  the just and unjust, to cause his sun to rise on the evil and the  good, and to give his spirit, like a perpetually widening river,  to every man to profit withal.    The sun reaches his unrelaxing hand of gravitation to every other  world at every instant. The tendency of every world is to fly off  in a straight line. This tendency must be momentarily curbed, and  the planet held in its true curve about the sun. These giant worlds  must be perfectly handled. Their speed, amounting to seventy times  as fast as that of a rifle-ball, must be managed. Each and every  world may be said to be lifted momentarily and swung perpetually  at arm's-length by the power of the sun.    The sun warms us. It would convey but a small idea of the truth  to state how many hundreds of millions of cubic miles of ice could  be hailed at the sun every second without affecting its heat; but,  if any one has any curiosity to know, it is 287,200,000 cubic miles  of ice per second.    We journey through space which has a temperature of 200 deg. below  zero; but we live, as it were, in a conservatory, in the midst of  perpetual winter. We are roofed over by the air that treasures the  heat, floored under by strata both absorptive and retentive of heat,  [Page 95] and between the earth and air violets grow and grains  ripen. The sun has a strange chemical power. It kisses the cold  earth, and it blushes with flowers and matures the fruit and grain.  We are feeble creatures, and the sun gives us force. By it the light  winds move one-eighth of a mile an hour, the storm fifty miles, the  hurricane one hundred. The force is as the square of the velocity.  It is by means of the sun that the merchant's white-sailed ships are  blown safely home. So the sun carries off the miasma of the marsh,  the pollution of cities, and then sends the winds to wash and  cleanse themselves in the sea-spray. The water-falls of the earth  turn machinery, and make Lowells and Manchesters possible, because  the sun lifted all that water to the hills.    Intermingled with these currents of air are the currents of electric  power, all derived from the sun. These have shown their swiftness  and willingness to serve man. The sun's constant force displayed  on the earth is equal to 543,000,000,000 engines of 400-horse power  each, working day and night; and yet the earth receives only  1/21500000000 part of the whole force of the sun.    Besides all this, the sun, with provident care, has made and given  to us coal. This omnipotent worker has stored away in past ages  an inexhaustible reservoir of his power which man may easily mine  and direct, thus releasing himself from absorbing toil.    EXPERIMENTS.    Any one may see the spots on the sun who has a spy-glass. Darken  the room and put the glass through an opening toward the sun, as  shown in Fig. 37. The eye-piece should be drawn out about half  an inch beyond [Page 96] its usual focusing for distant objects. The  farther it is drawn, the nearer must we hold the screen for a  perfect image.    By holding a paper near the eye-piece, the proper direction of  the instrument may be discovered without injury to the eyes. By  this means the sun can be studied from day to day, and its spots or  the transits of Mercury and Venus shown to any number of spectators.    [Illustration: Fig. 37.--Holding Telescope to see the Sun's Spots.]    First covering the eyes with very dark or smoked glasses, erect  a disk of pasteboard four inches in diameter between you and the  sun; close one eye; stand near it, and the whole sun is obscured.  Withdraw from it till the sun's rays just shoot over the edge of  the disk on every side. Measure the distance from the eye to the  disk. You will be able to determine the distance of the sun by  the rule of three: thus, as four inches is to 860,000 miles, so  is distance from eye to disk to distance from disk to the sun.  Take such measurements at sunrise, noon, and sunset, and see the  apparently differing sizes due to refraction.          [Page 97]  VI.    THE PLANETS, AS SEEN FROM SPACE.    \"He hangeth the earth upon nothing.\"--_Job_ xxvi. 7.    [Page 98]  \"Let a power be delegated to a finite spirit equal to the projection  of the most ponderous planet in its orbit, and, from an exhaustless  magazine, let this spirit select his grand central orb. Let him with  puissant arm locate it in space, and, obedient to his mandate, there  let it remain forever fixed. He proceeds to select his planetary  globes, which he is now required to marshal in their appropriate  order of distance from the sun. Heed well this distribution; for  should a single globe be misplaced, the divine harmony is destroyed  forever. Let us admit that finite intelligence may at length determine  the order of combination; the mighty host is arrayed in order.  These worlds, like fiery coursers, stand waiting the command to  fly. But, mighty spirit, heed well the grand step, ponder well  the direction in which thou wilt launch each wailing world; weigh  well the mighty impulse soon to be given, for out of the myriads  of directions, and the myriads of impulsive forces, there comes  but a single combination that will secure the perpetuity of your  complex scheme. In vain does the bewildered finite spirit attempt  to fathom this mighty depth. In vain does it seek to resolve the  stupendous problem. It turns away, and while endued with omnipotent  power, exclaims, 'Give to me infinite wisdom, or relieve me from  the impossible task!'\"-0. M. MITCHEL, LL. D.          [Page 99]  VI.    _THE PLANETS, AS SEEN FROM SPACE_    If we were to go out into space a few millions of miles from either  pole of the sun, and were endowed with wonderful keenness of vision,  we should perceive certain facts, viz: That space is frightfully  dark except when we look directly at some luminous body. There is  no air to bend the light out of its course, no clouds or other  objects to reflect it in a thousand directions. Every star is a  brilliant point, even in perpetual sunshine. The cold is frightful  beyond the endurance of our bodies. There is no sound of voice in  the absence of air, and conversation by means of vocal organs being  impossible, it must be carried on by means of mind communication.  We see below an unrevolving point on the sun that marks its pole.  Ranged round in order are the various planets, each with its axis  pointing in very nearly the same direction. All planets, except  possibly Venus, and all moons except those of Uranus and Neptune,  present their equators to the sun. The direction of orbital and  axial revolution seen from above the North Pole would be opposite  to that of the hands of a watch.    [Illustration: Fig. 38.--Orbits and Comparative Sizes of the Planets.]    The speed of this orbital revolution must be proportioned to the  distance from the sun. The attraction of the sun varies inversely  as the square of the distance. [Page 100] It holds a planet with a  certain power; one twice as far off, with one-fourth that power.  This attraction must be counterbalanced by centrifugal force; great  force from great speed when attraction is great, and small from less  [Page 101] speed when attractive power is diminished by distance.  Hence Mercury must go 29.5 miles per second--seventy times as fast  as a rifle-ball that goes two-fifths of a mile in a second--or be  drawn into the sun; while Neptune, seventy-five times as far off,  and hence attracted only 1/5626 as much, must be slowed down to 3.4  miles a second to prevent its flying away from the feebler  attraction of the sun. The orbital velocity of the various planets  in miles per second is as follows:      Mercury  29.55  |  Jupiter  8.06    Venus    21.61  |  Saturn   5.95    Earth    18.38  |  Uranus   4.20    Mars     14.99  |  Neptune  3.36    Hence, while the earth makes one revolution in its year, Mercury  has made over four revolutions, or passed through four years; the  slower Neptune has made only 1/164 of one revolution.    The time of axial revolution which determines the length of the  day varies with different planets. The periods of the four planets  nearest the sun vary only half an hour from that of the earth,  while the enormous bodies of Jupiter and Saturn revolve in ten  and ten and a quarter hours respectively. This high rate of speed,  and its resultant, centrifugal force, has aided in preventing these  bodies from becoming as dense as they would otherwise be--Jupiter  being only 0.24 as dense as the earth, "]]]
