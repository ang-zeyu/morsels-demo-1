The turn where the sand pit had been was now close at hand. Here the  road was rather narrow, so they had to drive close to the opening, now  more than half filled with drifted snow. Bert clung to the cutter while  Bob continued to haul in on the reins. Then came a crash, as the cutter  hit a hidden stone and drove straight for the sand pit.    \"Hold on!\" cried Bob, and the next instant Bert found himself flying  out of the cutter and over the edge of the road. He tried to save  himself by clutching at the ice and snow, but it was useless, and in a  twinkling he disappeared into the sand pit! Bob followed, while Rusher  went on more gayly than ever, hauling the overturned cutter after him.    Down and down went poor Bert into the deep snow, until he thought he was  never going to stop. Bob was beside him, and both floundered around  wildly until almost the bottom of the pit was reached.    \"Oh, Bob!\"    \"Oh, Bert! Are you hurt?\"    \"Don't know as I am. But what a tumble!\"    \"Rusher has run away!\"    \"I was afraid he'd do that.\"    For a minute the two boys knew not what to do. The deep snow lay all  around them and how to get out of the pit was a serious question.    \"It's a wonder we weren't smothered,\" said Bob. \"Are you quite sure no  bones have been broken?\"    \"Bones broken? Why, Bob, it was like coming down on a big feather bed. I  only hope Rusher doesn't do any damage.\"    \"So do I.\"    When the boys finally floundered out of the hollow into which they had  fallen, they found themselves in snow up to their waists. On all sides  of them were the walls of the sand pit, ten to fifteen feet high.    \"I don't see how we are going to get out of this,\" said Bert dolefully.  \"We can't climb out.\"    \"We'll have to do it,\" answered Bob. \"Come, follow me.\"    He led the way through the deep snow to where the walls did not seem to  be so high. At one spot the rain had washed down part of the soil.    \"Let us try to climb up that slope,\" said the larger boy and led the  way, and Bert followed.    It was hard work and it made Bert pant for breath, for the snow was  still up to his waist. But both kept on, and in the end they stood on  the edge of the sand pit, opposite to the side which ran along the  road.    \"Now we have got to walk around,\" said Bob. \"But that will be easy, if  we keep to the places where the wind has swept the snow away.\"    At last they stood on the road, and this reached both struck out for  Dalton, less than a mile away.    \"I'm afraid I'll catch it, if Rusher has smashed up the cutter,\" said  Bob as they hurried along.    \"We did wrong to race,\" answered Bert.    \"Humph! it's no use to cry over spilt milk, Bert.\"    \"I know that, Bob. Was the cutter a new one?\"    \"No, but I know father won't want it smashed up.\"    Much downhearted the boys kept on walking. Bert had not wanted to race,  yet he felt he was guilty for having taken part. Perhaps his father  would have to pay for part of the damage done.    \"Maybe old Rusher ran right into town and smashed things right and  left,\" he said to his friend.    \"It would be just like him,\" sighed Bob. \"It will make an awful bill to  pay, won't it?\"    A little further on they came to where a barn and a wagon shed lined the  road. Under the shed stood a horse and cutter.    \"My gracious me!\" burst out Bob.    \"Why--why--is it Rusher?\" gasped Bert.    \"It is!\" shouted his friend.    Both boys ran up, and as they did so a farmer came from the barn.    \"Oh, Mr. Daly, did you catch our horse?\"    \"I did, Bob,\" said the farmer. \"Had a runaway, eh?\"    \"Yes, sir. Rusher threw us both into the old sand pit. I'm ever so glad  you caught him. Is the cutter broken?\"    \"Not that I noticed. I knew you must have had a spill-out. I saw you  going to the lake right after dinner.\"    Both boys inspected the cutter and found it in good condition, outside  of a few scratches that did not count. Old Rusher was also all right,  for which they were thankful.    \"It was nice of you to stop the horse,\" said Bert to Farmer Daly.    \"Oh, I'd do as much for anybody,\" said the farmer. \"That is, if it  wasn't too dangerous. Rusher wasn't running very fast when I caught  him.\"    \"He was running fast enough when he threw us out,\" answered Bob.    It did not take the boys long to get into the cutter again.    \"Don't let him get away on the road home,\" sang out Farmer Daly after  them.    \"No fear of that,\" answered Bob.    He was very careful how he let Rusher step out. It was growing late, but  Bert did not urge him on, so it was half-past five before the Ramdell  house was reached.    \"You are late after all,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, rather displeased.    \"Oh, we've had such an adventure,\" cried Bert.    \"What happened to you?\" questioned Mrs. Bobbsey quickly.    \"Rusher threw us into a sand pit,\" answered Bert, and then told the  whole story.    \"You can be thankful that you were not hurt,\" said his mamma.    \"I am thankful, mamma.\"    \"Rusher is still full of go,\" said Mrs. Ramdell. \"I have warned my  husband not to let Bob drive him.\"    \"Oh, it was the brush with the other cutter that did it,\" said Bob.  \"Rusher couldn't stand it to let another horse pass him on the road.\"    Shortly after this, good-bys were said, and Sam brought around the big  family sleigh from the barn. Into this the whole Bobbsey family piled,  and off they went, in the gathering gloom of the short winter day.    \"I've had a lovely time!\" called out Nan.    \"So have I had a lovely time,\" added little Flossie.    \"Splendid,\" came from Freddie. \"The baby is awful nice to play with.\"    \"I've had a good time, too,\" said Bert. \"The hockey game was just the  best ever, and so was the drive behind Rusher, even if we did get dumped  out.\"    The drive back to Lakeport was enjoyed as much as the drive to Dalton in  the morning. On the way the children began to sing, and the voices  mingled sweetly with the sounds of the sleigh bells.    \"I shall not forget this outing in a hurry,\" said Nan, as she leaped to  the step and ran into the house.    \"I shan't forget it either,\" answered Bert. \"But it turned out  differently for me from what I thought it would.\"          CHAPTER XVIII    A QUARREL IN THE SCHOOLYARD      Three days after the grand sleighing party to Dalton, Nan came down to  breakfast looking very pale and worried.    \"What is the trouble, Nan?\" questioned her mamma. \"What has happened?\"    \"Oh, mamma, I scarcely feel like telling,\" answered Nan. \"I am afraid  you'll laugh at me.\"    \"I fancy you had best tell me,\" went on Mrs. Bobbsey.    \"I saw the ghost last night--or rather, early this morning.\"    \"What, the ghost that I saw?\" shouted Bert.    \"I think it must have been the same. Anyway, it was about that  high\"--Nan raised her hand to her shoulder--\"and all pure white.\"    \"Oh, Nan!\" shivered Freddie. \"Don't want no ghostses!\"    \"I don't want to see it,\" put in Flossie, and edged closer to her mamma  as if fearful the ghost might walk into the dining room that minute.    \"This is certainly strange,\" came from Mr. Bobbsey. \"Tell us all about  it, Nan.\"    \"Oh, papa, you won't laugh?\" and Nan's face grew very red. \"I--I--didn't  think of it then, but it must have been very funny,\" she continued.    \"It's not very funny to see a ghost, Nan,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.    \"I don't mean that--I mean what I did afterward. You see I was asleep  and I woke up all of a sudden, for I thought somebody had passed a hand  over my face. When I looked out into the room the ghost was standing  right in front of the dresser. I could see into the glass and for the  minute I thought there were two ghosts.\"    \"Oh!\" came from Flossie. \"Two! Wasn't that simply dreadful!\" And she  crouched closer than ever to her mamma.    \"As I was looking, the ghost moved away toward the window and then I saw  there was but one. I was so scared I couldn't call anybody.\"    \"I believe you,\" said Bert. \"It's awful, isn't it?\"    \"This is certainly strange,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, with a grave look on his  face. \"What did you do next, Nan?\"    \"You--you won't laugh, papa?\"    \"No.\"    \"I thought of my umbrella. It was resting against the wall, close to the  bed. I turned over and reached for the umbrella, but it slipped down and  made a terrible noise as it struck the floor. Then I flung the covers  over my head.\"    \"What did you want the umbrella for?\" questioned Freddie, in great  wonder. \"'Twasn't raining.\"    \"I thought I could--could punch the ghost with it,\" faltered Nan.    At this Bert could hold in no longer, and he set up a shout of laughter,  which was instantly repressed by Mr. Bobbsey.    \"Oh, Nan, I'm sorry I laughed,\" said her twin brother, when he could  speak. \"But the idea of your poking at a ghost with an umbrella!\"    \"It was more than you tried to do,\" said Mr. Bobbsey dryly.    \"That is so.\" Bert grew red in the face. \"Did you see the ghost after  that?\" he asked to hide his confusion.    \"No.\"    \"Not at all?\" asked Mrs. Bobbsey.    \"No, mamma. I stayed under the covers for about a minute--just like Bert  did--and when I looked the ghost was gone.\"    \"I will have to investigate this,\" said Mr. Bobbsey seriously. \"It is  queer that neither I nor your mamma has seen the ghost.\"    \"I ain't seen it,\" said Flossie.    \"Don't want to see it,\" piped in Freddie.    Dinah, in the kitchen, had heard Nan's story and she was almost scared  to death.    \"Dat am de strangest t'ing,\" she said to Sam, when he came for his  dinner. \"Wot yo' make of it, hey?\"    \"Dunno,\" said Sam. \"Maybe sumbuddy's gwine to"]]]
