Take my advice and try something milder; now do,  to-morrow; for I should never forgive myself if it made you worse  instead of better; and the air is too strong for lots of people.\"    I was neither too ill nor too vexed to laugh outright in his face.    \"It's not the air,\" said I; \"it's that splendid old Madeira of yours,  that was too strong for me, if you like! No, no, Rattray, you don't get  rid of me so cheaply-much as you seem to want to!\"    \"I was only thinking of you,\" he rejoined, with a touch of pique that  convinced me of his sincerity. \"Of course I want you to stop, though  I shan't be here many days; but I feel responsible for you, Cole,  and that's the fact. Think you can find your way?\" he continued,  accompanying me to the gate, a postern in the high garden wall. \"Hadn't  you better have a lantern?\"    No; it was unnecessary. I could see splendidly, had the bump of locality  and as many more lies as would come to my tongue. I was indeed burning  to be gone.    A moment later I feared that I had shown this too plainly. For his final  handshake was hearty enough to send me away something ashamed of  my precipitancy, and with a further sense of having shown him  small gratitude for his kindly anxiety on my behalf. I would behave  differently to-morrow. Meanwhile I had new regrets.    At first it was comparatively easy to see, for the lights of the house  shone faintly among the nearer oaks. But the moon was hidden behind  heavy clouds, and I soon found myself at a loss in a terribly dark zone  of timber. Already I had left the path. I felt in my pocket for matches.  I had none.    My head was now clear enough, only deservedly heavy. I was still  quarrelling with myself for my indiscretions and my incivilities, one  and all the result of his wine and my weakness, and this new predicament  (another and yet more vulgar result) was the final mortification. I  swore aloud. I simply could not see a foot in front of my face. Once I  proved it by running my head hard against a branch. I was hopelessly and  ridiculously lost within a hundred yards of the hall!    Some minutes I floundered, ashamed to go back, unable to proceed for  the trees and the darkness. I heard the beck running over its stones. I  could still see an occasional glimmer from the windows I had left. But  the light was now on this side, now on that; the running water chuckled  in one ear after the other; there was nothing for it but to return in  all humility for the lantern which I had been so foolish as to refuse.    And as I resigned myself to this imperative though inglorious course, my  heart warmed once more to the jovial young squire. He would laugh, but  not unkindly, at my grotesque dilemma; at the thought of his laughter I  began to smile myself. If he gave me another chance I would smoke that  cigar with him before starting home afresh, and remove, from my own  mind no less than from his, all ill impressions. After all it was not  his fault that I had taken too much of his wine; but a far worse offence  was to be sulky in one's cups. I would show him that I was myself again  in all respects. I have admitted that I was temporarily, at all events,  a creature of extreme moods. It was in this one that I retraced my steps  towards the lights, and at length let myself into the garden by the  postern at which I had shaken Rattray's hand not ten minutes before.    Taking heart of grace, I stepped up jauntily to the porch. The weeds  muffled my steps. I myself had never thought of doing so, when all at  once I halted in a vague terror. Through the deep lattice windows I  had seen into the lighted hall. And Rattray was once more seated at his  table, a little company of men around him.    I crept nearer, and my heart stopped. Was I delirious, or raving mad  with wine? Or had the sea given up its dead?          CHAPTER XI. I LIVE AGAIN      Squire Rattray, as I say, was seated at the head of his table, where  the broken meats still lay as he and I had left them; his fingers, I  remember, were playing with a crust, and his eyes fixed upon a distant  door, as he leant back in his chair. Behind him hovered the nigger of  the Lady Jermyn, whom I had been the slower to recognize, had not her  skipper sat facing me on the squire's right. Yes, there was Captain  Harris in the flesh, eating heartily between great gulps of wine,  instead of feeding the fishes as all the world supposed. And nearer  still, nearer me than any, with his back to my window but his chair  slued round a little, so that he also could see that door, and I his  profile, sat Joaquin Santos with his cigarette!    None spoke; all seemed waiting; and all were silent but the captain,  whose vulgar champing reached me through the crazy lattice, as I stood  spellbound and petrified without.    They say that a drowning man lives his life again before the last; but  my own fight with the sea provided me with no such moments of vivid and  rapid retrospect as those during which I stood breathless outside the  lighted windows of Kirby Hall. I landed again. I was dogged day and  night. I set it down to nerves and notoriety; but took refuge in a  private hotel. One followed me, engaged the next room, set a watch on  all my movements; another came in by the window to murder me in my  bed; no party to that, the first one nevertheless turned the outrage to  account, wormed himself into my friendship on the strength of it, and  lured me hither, an easy prey. And here was the gang of them, to meet  me! No wonder Rattray had not let me see him off at the station; no  wonder I had not been followed that night. Every link I saw in its  right light instantly. Only the motive remained obscure. Suspicious  circumstances swarmed upon my slow perception: how innocent I had been!  Less innocent, however, than wilfully and wholly reckless: what had it  mattered with whom I made friends? What had anything mattered to me?  What did anything matter--    I thought my heart had snapped!    Why were they watching that door, Joaquin Santos and the young squire?  Whom did they await? I knew! Oh, I knew! My heart leaped, my blood  danced, my eyes lay in wait with theirs. Everything began to matter  once more. It was as though the machinery of my soul, long stopped, had  suddenly been set in motion; it was as though I was born again.    How long we seemed to wait I need not say. It cannot have been many  moments in reality, for Santos was blowing his rings of smoke in the  direction of the door, and the first that I noticed were but dissolving  when it opened--and the best was true! One instant I saw her very  clearly, in the light of a candle which she carried in its silver stick;  then a mist blinded me, and I fell on my knees in the rank bed into  which I had stepped, to give such thanks to the Almighty as this heart  has never felt before or since. And I remained kneeling; for now my face  was on a level with the sill; and when my eyes could see again, there  stood my darling before them in the room.    Like a queen she stood, in the very travelling cloak in which I had seen  her last; it was tattered now, but she held it close about her as though  a shrewd wind bit her to the core. Her sweet face was all peeked and  pale in the candle-light: she who had been a child was come to womanhood  in a few weeks. But a new spirit flashed in her dear eyes, a new  strength hardened her young lips. She stood as an angel brought to book  by devils; and so noble was her calm defiance, so serene her scorn,  that, as I watched and listened; all present fear for her passed out of  my heart.    The first sound was the hasty rising of young Rattray; he was at Eva's  side next instant, essaying to lead her to his chair, with a flush which  deepened as she repulsed him coldly.    \"You have sent for me, and I have come,\" said she. \"But I prefer not to  sit down in your presence; and what you have to say, you will be good  enough to say as quickly as possible, that I may go again before I  am--stifled!\"    It was her one hot word; aimed at them all, it seemed to me to fall like  a lash on Rattray's cheek, bringing the blood to it like lightning. But  it was Santos who snatched the cigarette from his mouth, and opened upon  the defenceless girl in a torrent of Portuguese, yellow with rage, and a  very windmill of lean arms and brown hands in the terrifying rapidity of  his gesticulations. They did not terrify Eva Denison. When Rattray took  a step towards the speaker, with flashing eyes, it was some word from  Eva that checked him; when Santos was done, it was to Rattray that she  turned with her answer.    \"He calls me a liar for telling you that Mr. Cole knew all,\" said she,  thrilling me with my own name. \"Don't you say anything,\" she added, as  the young man turned on Santos with a scowl; \"you are one as wicked as  the other, but there was a time when I thought differently of you: his  character I have always known. Of the two evils, I prefer to speak to  you.\"    Rattray bowed, humbly enough, I thought; but my darling's nostrils only  curled the more.    \"He calls me a liar,\" she continued; \"so may you all. Since you have  found it out, I admit it freely and without shame; one must be false in  the hands of false fiends like all of you. Weakness is nothing to you;  helplessness is nothing; you must be met with your own weapons, and so I  lied in my sore extremity to gain the one miserable advantage within my  reach. He says you found me out by making friends with Mr. Cole. He  says that Mr. Cole has been dining with you in this very room, this  very night. You still tell the truth sometimes; has that man--that  demon--told it for once?\"    \"It is perfectly true,\" said Rattray in a low voice.    \"And poor Mr. Cole told you that he knew nothing of your villany?\"    \"I found out that he knew absolutely"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17034"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#14)"],[1," is the matter?\"    \"O mother!\" says she between her sobs, \"it's that horrid mallet.  Supposing him and me was married, and supposing we was to have a son,  and supposing he was to grow up to be a man, and supposing he was to  come down to draw cider like as I'm doing, and supposing the mallet were  to fall on his head and kill him, how dreadful it would be!\"    \"Dear heart!\" said the mother, seating herself beside her daughter and  beginning to cry: \"How dreadful it would be!\"    So they both sat a-crying.    Now after a time, when they did not come back, the farmer began to  wonder what had happened, and going down to the cellar found them  seated side by side on the cask, crying hard, and the cider running all  over the floor.    \"Zounds!\" says he, \"whatever is the matter?\"    \"Just look at that horrid mallet up there, father,\" moaned the mother.  \"Supposing our daughter was to marry her sweetheart, and supposing they  was to have a son, and supposing he was to grow to man's estate, and  supposing he was to come down to draw cider like as we're doing, and  supposing that there mallet was to fall on his head and kill him, how  dreadful it would be!\"    \"Dreadful indeed!\" said the father and, seating himself beside his wife  and daughter, started a-crying too.    Now upstairs the young squire wanted his supper; so at last he lost  patience and went down into the cellar to see for himself what they were  all after. And there he found them seated side by side on the cask  a-crying, with their feet all a-wash in cider, for the floor was fair  flooded. So the first thing he did was to run straight and turn off the  tap. Then he said:    \"What are you three after, sitting there crying like babies, and letting  good cider run over the floor?\"    Then they all three began with one voice, \"Look at that horrid mallet!  Supposing you and me/she was married, and supposing we/you had a  son, and supposing he was to grow to man's estate, and supposing he was  to come down here to draw cider like as we be, and supposing that there  mallet was to fall down on his head and kill him, how dreadful it would  be!\"    Then the young squire burst out a-laughing, and laughed till he was  tired. But at last he reached up to the old mallet and pulled it out,  and put it safe on the floor. And he shook his head and said, \"I've  travelled far and I've travelled fast, but never have I met with three  such sillies as you three. Now I can't marry one of the three biggest  sillies in the world. So I shall start again on my travels, and if I can  find three bigger sillies than you three, then I'll come back and be  married--not otherwise.\"    So he wished them good-bye and started again on his travels, leaving  them all crying; this time because the marriage was off!    Well, the young man travelled far and he travelled fast, but never did  he find a bigger silly, until one day he came upon an old woman's  cottage that had some grass growing on the thatched roof.    And the old woman was trying her best to cudgel her cow into going up a  ladder to eat the grass. But the poor thing was afraid and durst not go.  Then the old woman tried coaxing, but it wouldn't go. You never saw such  a sight! The cow getting more and more flustered and obstinate, the old  woman getting hotter and hotter.    At last the young squire said, \"It would be easier if _you_ went up the  ladder, cut the grass, and threw it down for the cow to eat.\"    \"A likely story that,\" says the old woman. \"A cow can cut grass for  herself. And the foolish thing will be quite safe up there, for I'll tie  a rope round her neck, pass the rope down the chimney, and fasten  t'other end to my wrist, so as when I'm doing my bit o' washing, she  can't fall off the roof without my knowing it. So mind your own  business, young sir.\"    Well, after a while the old woman coaxed and codgered and bullied and  badgered the cow up the ladder, and when she got it on to the roof she  tied a rope round its neck, passed the rope down the chimney, and  fastened t'other end to her wrist. Then she went about her bit of  washing, and young squire he went on his way.    But he hadn't gone but a bit when he heard the awfullest hullabaloo. He  galloped back, and found that the cow had fallen off the roof and got  strangled by the rope round its neck, while the weight of the cow had  pulled the old woman by her wrist up the chimney, where she had got  stuck half-way and been smothered by the soot!    \"That is one bigger silly,\" quoth the young squire as he journeyed on.  \"So now for two more!\"    He did not find any, however, till late one night he arrived at a little  inn. And the inn was so full that he had to share a room with another  traveller. Now his room-fellow proved quite a pleasant fellow, and they  forgathered, and each slept well in his bed.    But next morning, when they were dressing, what does the stranger do but  carefully hang his breeches on the knobs of the tallboy!    \"What are you doing?\" asks young squire.    \"I'm putting on my breeches,\" says the stranger; and with that he goes  to the other end of the room, takes a little run, and tried to jump into  the breeches.    But he didn't succeed, so he took another run and another try, and  another and another and another, until he got quite hot and flustered,  as the old woman had got over her cow that wouldn't go up the ladder.  And all the time young squire was laughing fit to split, for never in  his life did he see anything so comical.    Then the stranger stopped a while and mopped his face with his  handkerchief, for he was all in a sweat. \"It's very well laughing,\" says  he, \"but breeches are the most awkwardest things to get into that ever  were. It takes me the best part of an hour every morning before I get  them on. How do you manage yours?\"    Then young squire showed him, as well as he could for laughing, how to  put on his breeches, and the stranger was ever so grateful and said he  never should have thought of that way.    \"So that,\" quoth young squire to himself, \"is a second bigger silly.\"  But he travelled far and he travelled fast without finding the third,  until one bright night when the moon was shining right overhead he came  upon a village. And outside the village was a pond, and round about the  pond was a great crowd of villagers. And some had got rakes, and some  had got pitchforks, and some had got brooms. And they were as busy as  busy, shouting out, and raking, and forking, and sweeping away at the  pond.    \"What is the matter?\" cried young squire, jumping off his horse to help.  \"Has any one fallen in?\"    \"Aye! Matter enough,\" says they. \"Can't 'ee see moon's fallen into the  pond, an' we can't get her out nohow.\"    And with that they set to again raking, and forking, and sweeping away.  Then the young squire burst out laughing, told them they were fools for  their pains, and bade them look up over their heads where the moon was  riding broad and full. But they wouldn't, and they wouldn't believe that  what they saw in the water was only a reflection. And when he insisted  they began to abuse him roundly and threaten to duck him in the pond. So  he got on his horse again as quickly as he could, leaving them raking,  and forking, and sweeping away; and for all we know they may be at it  yet!    But the young squire said to himself, \"There are many more sillies in  this world than I thought for; so I'll just go back and marry the  farmer's daughter. She is no sillier than the rest.\"    So they were married, and if they didn't live happy ever after, that has  nothing to do with the story of the three sillies.          [Illustration: Headpiece--The Golden Ball]    THE GOLDEN BALL      Once upon a time there lived two lasses, who were sisters, and as they  came from the fair they saw a right handsome young man standing at a  house door before them. They had never seen such a handsome young man  before. He had gold on his cap, gold on his finger, gold on his neck,  gold at his waist! And he had a golden ball in each hand. He gave a ball  to each lass, saying she was to keep it; but if she lost it, she was to  be hanged.    Now the youngest of the lasses lost her ball, and this is how. She was  by a park paling, and she was tossing her ball, and it went up, and up,  and up, till it went fair over the paling; and when she climbed to look  for it, the ball ran along the green grass, and it ran right forward to  the door of a house that stood there, and the ball went into the house  and she saw it no more.    So she was taken away to be hanged by the neck till she was dead,  because she had lost her ball.    But the lass had a sweetheart, and he said he would go and get the ball.  So he went to the park gate, but 'twas shut; then he climbed the  railing, and when he got to the top of it an old woman rose up out of  the ditch before him and said that if he wanted to get the ball he must  sleep three nights in the house: so he said he would.    Well! when it was evening, he went into the house, and looked everywhere  for the ball, but he could not find it, nor any one in the house at all;  but when night came on he thought he heard bogles moving about in the  courtyard; so he looked out o' window, and, sure enough, the yard was  full of them!    Presently he heard steps coming upstairs, so he hid behind the door, and  was as still as a mouse. Then in came a big giant five times as tall as  the lad, and looked around; but seeing nothing he went to the window and  bowed himself to look out; and as he bowed on his elbows to see the  bogles in the yard, the lad stepped behind him, and with one blow of his  sword he cut him in twain, so that the top part of him fell in the yard,  and the bottom part remained standing looking out of the window.    Well! there was a great cry from the bogles when they saw half the giant  come tumbling down to them, and they called out, \"There comes half our  master; give us the other"]]]
