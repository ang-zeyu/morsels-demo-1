The two teachers of Chopin were Adalbert Zwyny, a Bohemian violinist,  who taught the piano, and Joseph Elsner, a violinist, organist and  theorist. \"From Zwyny and Elsner even the greatest dunce must learn  something,\" he is quoted as saying. Neither of these men attempted to  hamper his free growth by rigid technical restraints. Their guidance  left him master of his own genius, at liberty to \"soar like the lark  into the ethereal blue of the skies.\" He respected them both. A revering  affection was cherished by him for Elsner, to whom he owed his sense of  personal responsibility to his art, his habits of serious study and his  intimate acquaintance with Bach.    There is food for thought in the fact that this Prince Charming of the  piano, whose magic touch awakened the Sleeping Beauty of the instrument  of wood and wires, never had a lesson in his life from a mere piano  specialist. Liszt once said Chopin was the only pianist he ever knew  that could play the violin on the piano. If he could do so it was  because he had harkened to the voice of the violin and resolved to show  that the piano, too, could produce thrilling effects. In the same way he  had listened to the human voice, and determined that the song of his own  instrument should be heard. Those who give ear to the piano alone will  never learn the secret of calling forth its supreme eloquence.    We can see and hear this \"Raphael of Music\" at the piano, so many and so  eloquent have been the descriptions given of his playing. It is easy to  fancy him sweeping the ivory keys with his gossamer touch that enveloped  with ethereal beauty the most unaccustomed of his complicated chromatic  modulations. We can feel his individuality pulsating through every tone  evoked by those individualized fingers of his as they weave measures for  sylphs of dreamland, or summon to warfare heroes of the ideal world. We  are entranced by his luxuriant tone-coloring, induced to a large extent  by his original management of the pedals. We marvel at his softly  whispered, yet ever clearly distinct pianissimo, at the full, round tone  of its relative fortissimo, that was never harsh or noisy, and at all  the exquisitely graded nuances that lay between, with those time  fluctuations expressive of the ebb and flow of his poetic inner being.  No wonder Balzac maintained that if Chopin should but drum on the table  his fingers would evoke subtle-sounding music.    And what an example he has left for teachers. Delicately strung as he  was, he must often have endured tortures from the best of his pupils,  but so thoroughly was he consecrated to his art that he never faltered  in his efforts to lift those who confided in him to the aerial heights  he had found. A vivid picture of his method of teaching is given in the  lectures on \"Frederic Chopin's Works and Their Proper Interpretation,\"  by the Pole, Jean Kleczynski.    The basis of this method consisted in refinement of touch, for the  attainment of which a natural, easy position of the hand was considered  by Chopin a prime requisite. He prepared each hand with infinite care  before permitting any attempt at the reproduction of musical ideas. In  order to place it to advantage he caused it to be thrown lightly on the  keyboard so that the five fingers rested on the notes E, F sharp, G  sharp, A sharp and B, and without change of position required the  practice of exercises calculated to insure independence. The pupil was  instructed to go through these exercises first staccato, effected by a  free movement of the wrist, an admirable means of counteracting  heaviness and clumsiness, then legato-staccato, then accented legato,  then pure legato, modifying the power from pp to ff, and the movement  from andante to prestissimo.    He was exceedingly particular about arpeggio work, and insisted upon the  repetition of every note and passage until all harshness and roughness  of tone were eliminated. \"Is that a dog barking?\" he was known to  exclaim to an unlucky pupil whose attack in the opening arpeggio of a  Clementi study lacked the desired quality. A very independent use of the  thumb was prescribed by him. He never hesitated about placing it on a  black key when convenient, and had it passed by muscle action alone in  scales and broken chords whose zealous practice in different forms of  touch, accent, rhythm and tone were demanded by him.    Individualization of the fingers was one of his strong points, and he  believed in assigning to each of them its appropriate part. \"In a good  mechanism,\" he said, \"the aim is not to play everything with an equal  sound, but to acquire beautiful quality of touch and perfect shading.\"  Of prime importance in his eyes was a clear, elastic, singing tone, one  whose exquisite delicacy could never be confounded with feebleness.  Every dynamic nuance he exacted of fingers that fell with freedom and  elasticity on the keys, and he knew how to augment the warmth and  richness of tone-coloring by setting in vibration sympathetic harmonics  of the principal notes through judicious employment of the damper pedal.    By precept and example he advocated frequent playing of the preludes and  fugues of Bach as a means of cultivating musical intelligence, muscular  independence and touch and tone discrimination. His musical heroes were  Bach and Mozart, for they represented to him nature, strong  individuality and poetry in music. At one time he undertook to write a  method or school of piano-playing, but never progressed beyond the  opening sentences. A message directly from him would have been  invaluable to students, and might have averted many unlucky  misapprehensions of himself and his works. Those of his contemporaries  who have harkened with rapture to his playing have declared that he  alone could adequately interpret his tone-creations, or make perfectly  intelligible his method. Pupils of his and their pupils have faithfully  endeavored to transmit to the musical world the tradition of his  individual style. The elect few have come into touch with his vision of  beauty, but it has been mercilessly misinterpreted by thousands of  ruthless aspirants to musical honors, in the schoolroom, the students'  recital and the concert hall.    Whoever plays Chopin with sledge-hammer fingers will deaden all sense of  his poetry, charm and grace. Whoever approaches him with weak  sentimentalism will miss altogether his dignity and strength. It has  been said of him that he was Woman in his tenderness and realization of  the beautiful; and Man in his energy and force of mind. The highest type  of artist and human being is thus represented. To interpret him requires  simplicity, purity of style, refined technique, poetic imagination and  genuine sentiment--not fitful, fictitious sentimentality.    In regard to the much discussed tempo rubato of Chopin many and fatal  blunders have been made. Players without number have gone stumbling over  the piano keys with a tottering, spasmodic gait, serenely fancying they  are heeding the master's design. Reckless, out-of-time playing  disfigures what is meant to express the fluctuation of thought, the  soul's agitation, the rolling of the waves of time and eternity. The  rubato, from rubare, to rob, represents a pliable movement that is  certainly as old as the Greek drama in declamation, and was employed in  intoning the Gregorian chant. The recitative of the sixteenth century  gave it prominence, and it passed into instrumental music. Indications  of it in Bach are too often neglected. Beethoven used it effectively.  Chopin appropriated it as one of his most potent auxiliaries. In playing  he emphasized the saying of Mozart: \"Let your left hand be the orchestra  conductor,\" while his right hand balanced and swayed the melody and its  arabesques according to the natural pulsation of the emotions. \"You see  that tree,\" exclaimed Liszt; \"its leaves tremble with every breath of  the wind, but the tree remains unshaken--that is the rubato.\" There are  storms to which even the tree yields. To realize them, to divine the  laws which regulate the undulating, tempest-tossed rubato, requires  highly matured artistic taste and absolute musical control.    Too sensitive to enjoy playing before miscellaneous audiences whose  unsympathetic curiosity, he declared, paralyzed him, Chopin was at his  best when interpreting music in private, for a choice circle of friends  or pupils, or when absorbed in composition. It is not too much to say  for him that he ushered in a new era for his chosen instrument,  spiritualizing its timbre, liberating it from traditional orchestral and  choral effects, and elevating it to an independent power in the world of  music. Besides enriching the technique of the piano, he augmented the  materials of musical expression, contributing fresh charms to those  prime factors of music melody, harmony and rhythm. New chord extensions,  passages of double notes, arabesques and harmonic combinations were  devised by him and he so systematized the use of the pedals that the  most varied nuances could be produced by them.    In melody and general conception his tone-poems sprang spontaneously  from his glowing fancy, but they were subjected to the most severe  tests before they were permitted to go out into the world. Every  ingenious device that gave character to his exquisite cantilena, and  softened his most startling chord progressions, was evolved by the vivid  imagination of this master from hitherto hidden qualities of the  pianoforte. Without him neither it nor modern music could have been what  it is. An accentuation like the ringing of distant bells is frequently  heard in his music. To him bell tones were ever ringing, reminding him  of home, summoning him to the heights.    James Huneker, the raconteur of the Musical Courier, discussing the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18285"],[0,"Tales from the Hindu Dramatists (#14)"],[1," without an  invitation.\" She answers, \"I need not stand on ceremony with my father.\"    Siva observes, \"How! would you impose upon me with falsehoods? Daksha is  not your father, nor is his wife your mother, you are the father of all  things, the mother of the universe. Those versed in the _Vedas_ declare  you male and female too.\"    In the end, she is allowed to follow her own inclinations.    She comes to her father, and vainly endeavours to impress him with  respect for her husband. She quits him to throw herself into the  sacrificial fire.    Nareda then appears and tells Daksha to prepare for the consequences of  his folly. Virabhadra, Siva's attendant, then enters and plays some  antics. Shaking the earth with his tread, and filling space with his  extended arms, he rolls his eyes in wrath. Some of the gods he casts on  the ground and tramples on them; he knocks out the teeth of some with  his fists, plucks out the beards of some, and cuts off the ears, arms,  and noses of others; he smites some, and he tosses others into the  sacrificial fire. He decapitates the cause of his master's indignation,  the haughty Daksha.          MRIGANKALEKHA.      Mrigankalekha is the daughter of the king of Kamarupa or Assam: she is  beheld by Karpuratilaka, the king of Kalinga, whilst hunting, and the  parties are mutually enamoured.    The obstacle to their union is the love of Sankhapala, a demon, to  oppose whose supernatural powers, Ratnachura, the minister of the king  of Kalinga, who alone is aware of the circumstance, invites to the  palace a benevolent magician, Siddhayogini, and Mrigankalekha is also  lodged in the palace as the friend of the queen Vilasavati.    Notwithstanding these precautions, she is carried off by Sankhapala to  the temple of Kali, which is surrounded by goblins. During the Raja's  peregrinations in his love-frenzy, he passes disconsolate through a wood  in which he inquires of different animals if they have seen his  mistress.    He now comes to the temple, rescues her, and kills Sankhapala. He is  then united to Mrigankalekha in the presence of her father and brother,  and with the consent of the queen. Before the conclusion of the marriage  rite, he kills also the brother of Sankhapala, who comes to revenge him  in the form of a wild elephant.    The marriage is thus effected through the secret contrivance of the  minister, because the lady's husband is to become the master of the  world.          MUDRARAKSHASA    OR    RAKSHASA (THE MINISTER) WITH THE SIGNET    OR    RAKSHASA AND THE SIGNET-RING    OR    RAKSHASA KNOWN BY THE SIGNET-RING.      The city of Pataliputra or Palibothra, the capital of the Nandas, was  situated not far from the confluence of the Ganges and the Sone; and was  on the southern side of the rivers. Nanda, the last king of the Nanda  line, had for his minister the able and experienced Rakshasa.  Chandragupta also called Vrishala and Maurya is identical with  Sandrakottus represented by the Greek writers as the most powerful Raja  in India at the time of Alexander the Great's death. He was a sovereign  of dignity and strength of character and had a high respect for his  minister Chanakya, the Indian Macchiavelli, who was a crafty,  clearheaded, self-confident, intriguing and hard politician, with the  ultimate end of his ambition thoroughly well-determined and directing  all his clearheadedness and intrigue to the accomplishment of that end.  This minister, also called Vishnugupta, is famous as a writer on _Nity_  or \"rules of government and polity\", and the reputed author of numerous  moral and political precepts commonly current in India. Nanda is slain  by the contrivances of this wily Brahman, who thus assists Chandragupta  to the throne, and becomes his minister. Rakshasa refuses to recognise  the usurper and endeavours to be avenged on him for the ruin of his late  master.    After the assassination of Nanda, Servarthasiddhi is placed on the  throne by Rakshasa but he retires to a life of devotion. Saileswara or  Parvataka or Parvateswara, the king of the Mountains, at first the ally  of Chandragupta, afterwards befriended his opponents and is therefore  slain privily by Chanakya. Vairodhaka, the brother of Parvataka, is  killed by Rakshasa's emissaries by mistake for Chandragupta.    Malayaketu, the son of Parvataka, is a prince whose confidence and  distrust are alike misplaced, who is thoughtless, suspicious, wanting in  dignity, and almost child-like, not to say childish. He leads an army  against Chandragupta but without success. He is so rash and  inconsiderate as to resolve most hastily to undertake war against five  kings at a time.    Rakshasa is a brave soldier but a blundering and somewhat soft-natured  politician, whose faithfulnesss to his original master Nanda prompts him  to wreak vengeance on Chandragupta and Chanakya. He has ultimately to  abandon in despair his self-imposed task, the great aim of his life,  being foiled by the arts of his adversary Chanakya. The proximate motive  of the abandonment, however, is the duty of repaying favours received by  him when he was engaged in his attempts at vengeance. He accidentally  acquires a ring.    Chanakya, whose ability and diplomatic skill are of a high order, lays  out various plottings and machinations to make Chandragupta the  paramount sovereign in India, by winning over the noble Rakshasa to his  master's cause. He tries successfully to effect a reconciliation between  his protege, and Rakshasa. With this view Rakshasa is rendered by the  contrivances of Chanakya an object of suspicion to the prince Malyaketu  with whom he has taken refuge and is consequently dismissed by him.    In this deserted condition he learns the imminent danger of a dear  friend Chandandasa whom Chanakya is about to put to death, and in order  to effect his liberation surrenders himself to his enemies.    They offer him, contrary to his expectations, the rank and power of  Prime Minister, and the parties are finally friends.    The Nanda dynasty thus comes to an end and Chandragupta becomes the  founder of the Maurya dynasty.    A curious scene in the last Act may be noticed here. A Chandala or  executioner leads a criminal to the place of execution. The latter bears  a stake (_Sula_) on his shoulder, and is followed by his wife and son  who use no expressions suggestive of tenderness but only of sacrifice--a  stern sense of duty. At the impending execution of her husband, she  neither faints nor becomes disconsolate but simply weeps and talks of  her duty.    The executioner calls out--\"Make way, make way, good people! let every  one who wishes to preserve his life, his property, or his family, avoid  transgressing against the king as he would, poison.\" This criminal is  Chandan Das who is put into chains with a view to force his friend  Rakshsa to yield. He gives up his life and property for the sake of his  friend Rakshasa. This conduct is described as casting into the shade the  noble acts of even the Buddhas.          VIDDHA SALABHANJIKA    OR    THE CARVED STATUE.      Vidyadhar Malla, the chief of the Karachuli race, a Rajput tribe, was  the king of Triling and Kalinga. Bhagurayana was his minister. Charayana  was his Vidushaka or confidential attendant. Chandraverma, the king of  Lata, was the maternal uncle-in-law of Vidyadhar Malla. He had no son.  To satisfy his desire for a son, he dressed his only daughter  Mrigankavali as a son to pass her off as such. People knew that the  child was a son.    Bhagurayana had heard from the sages that \"whosoever shall wed the  daughter of Chandravarma shall become the paramount sovereign.\" So he  told Chandravarma, \"My king desires to see your son.\" Upon this  Chandravarma sent his child to the queen of Vidyadhara Malla to be taken  care of by her. Thus the minister contrived to bring Mrigankavali to the  palace of his king.    One day, while the king is asleep, Mrigankavali puts a necklace on the  neck of the king, being induced by a maid-servant who had instructions  to do so by the minister. The king takes this as a wonderful dream. The  vision of a beautiful maid agitates his mind. The king thus relates to  Bidushaka the story of his fancied vision, \"for the burden of the heart  is lightened by sharing it with a faithful friend.\"    \"A glorious halo appeared before me in my dream, bright as the moon's  resplendent disk; within the orb a beauteous maiden moved as gently  radiant as the lunar rays in autumn skies.    Advancing near me, she inclined her head in reverence, and, as if  pouring ambrosia into my ears, pronounced in softest tones,    'Glory to the deity of love!' Then sighing, she took up this string of  costly pearls and placed it on my neck. This awoke me, I started up and  saw my vision realised. I caught the nymph by her scarf, but she hastily  extricated herself from my hands and fled, leaving me this necklace  alone the evidence of her presence.\" Bidushaka asks his Majesty, \"Was  not the queen with you when you dreamt? What did she do?\"    The king replies, \"The queen got angry and left me.\" Bidushaka remarks,  \"Why could not you assuage her anger?\"    The king answers, \"I was absorbed in the maid of my vision.\"    The Vidushaka, however, treats the whole as a dream, and reproaches the  king for his fickleness, as he had just before fallen in love with  Kuvalayamala, the princess of Kuntala, and recommends him to be content  with the queen, as \"a partridge in the hand is better than a pea-hen in  the forest.\"    The prince and the Vidushaka then go into the garden by the back-door,  where, over the edge of a terrace, they see some of the fair tenants of  the inner apartments amusing themselves with swinging. Amongst them the  king recognises the countenance he has seen in his dream, but the party  disappear on the advance of the king and his friend.    The king then enters a pleasure-house or pavilion called the  _kelikailas_ or mountain of sport "]]]
