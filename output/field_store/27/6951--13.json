[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19238"],[0,"Foundations of World Unity (#14)"],[1,"of this physical world so must the physical and intellectual man be  born into the light of the world of divinity. In the matrix of the mother  the unborn child was deprived and unconscious of the world of material  existence but after its birth it beheld the wonders and beauties of a new  realm of life and being. In the world of the matrix it was utterly  ignorant and unable to conceive of these new conditions but after its  transformation it discovers the radiant sun, trees, flowers and an  infinite range of blessings and bounties awaiting it. In the human plane  and kingdom man is a captive of nature and ignorant of the divine world  until born of the breaths of the Holy Spirit out of physical conditions of  limitation and deprivation. Then he beholds the reality of the spiritual  realm and kingdom, realizes the narrow restrictions of the mere human  world of existence and becomes conscious of the unlimited and infinite  glories of the world of God. Therefore no matter how man may advance upon  the physical and intellectual plane he is ever in need of the boundless  virtues of divinity, the protection of the Holy Spirit and the face of  God.            SCIENCE      The virtues of humanity are many but science is the most noble of them  all. The distinction which man enjoys above and beyond the station of the  animal is due to this paramount virtue. It is a bestowal of God; it is not  material, it is divine. Science is an effulgence of the Sun of Reality,  the power of investigating and discovering the verities of the universe,  the means by which man finds a pathway to God. All the powers and  attributes of man are human and hereditary in origin, outcomes of nature's  processes, except the intellect, which is supernatural. Through  intellectual and intelligent inquiry science is the discoverer of all  things. It unites present and past, reveals the history of bygone nations  and events, and confers upon man today the essence of all human knowledge  and attainment throughout the ages. By intellectual processes and logical  deductions of reason, this super-power in man can penetrate the mysteries  of the future and anticipate its happenings.    Science is the first emanation from God toward man. All created beings  embody the potentiality of material perfection, but the power of  intellectual investigation and scientific acquisition is a higher virtue  specialized to man alone. Other beings and organisms are deprived of this  potentiality and attainment. God has created or deposited this love of  reality in man. The development and progress of a nation is according to  the measure and degree of that nation's scientific attainments. Through  this means, its greatness is continually increased and day by day the  welfare and prosperity of its people are assured.    All blessings are divine in origin but none can be compared with this  power of intellectual investigation and research which is an eternal gift  producing fruits of unending delight. Man is ever partaking of these  fruits. All other blessings are temporary; this is an everlasting  possession. Even sovereignty has its limitations and overthrow; this is a  kingship and dominion which none may usurp or destroy. Briefly; it is an  eternal blessing and divine bestowal, the supreme gift of God to man.  Therefore you should put forward your most earnest efforts toward the  acquisition of sciences and arts. The greater your attainment, the higher  your standard in the divine purpose. The man of science is perceiving and  endowed with vision whereas he who is ignorant and neglectful of this  development is blind. The investigating mind is attentive, alive; the mind  callous and indifferent is deaf and dead. A scientific man is a true index  and representative of humanity, for through processes of inductive  reasoning and research he is informed of all that appertains to humanity,  its status, conditions and happenings. He studies the human body politic,  understands social problems and weaves the web and texture of  civilization. In fact, science may be likened to a mirror wherein the  infinite forms and images of existing things are revealed and reflected.  It is the very foundation of all individual and national development.  Without this basis of investigation, development is impossible. Therefore  seek with diligent endeavor the knowledge and attainment of all that lies  within the power of this wonderful bestowal.    We have already stated that science or the attribute of scientific  penetration is supernatural and that all other blessings of God are within  the boundary of nature. What is the proof of this? All created things  except man are captives of nature. The stars and suns swinging through  infinite space, all earthly forms of life and existence whether mineral,  vegetable or animal come under the dominion and control of natural law.  Man through scientific knowledge and power rules nature and utilizes her  laws to do his bidding. According to natural limitations he is a creature  of earth restricted to life upon its surface, but through scientific  utilization of material laws he soars in the sky, sails upon the ocean and  dives beneath it. The products of his invention and discovery so familiar  to us in daily life were once mysteries of nature. For instance, man has  brought electricity out of the plane of the invisible into the plane of  the visible, harnessed and imprisoned that mysterious natural agent and  made it the servant of his needs and wishes. Similar instances are many  but we will not prolong. Man as it were takes the sword out of nature's  hand and with it for his sceptre of authority dominates nature itself.  Nature is without the crown of human faculties and attributes. Man  possesses conscious intelligence and reflection; nature is minus. This is  an established fundamental among philosophers. Man is endowed with  volition and memory; nature has neither. Man can seek out the mysteries  latent in nature whereas nature is not conscious of her own hidden  phenomena. Man is progressive; nature is stationary, without the power of  progression or retrogression. Man is endowed with ideal virtues, for  example intellection, volition,--among them faith, confession and  acknowledgment of God, while nature is devoid of all these. The ideal  faculties of man, including the capacity of scientific acquisition are  beyond nature's ken. These are powers whereby man is differentiated and  distinguished from all other forms of life. This is the bestowal of divine  idealism, the crown adorning human heads. Notwithstanding the gift of this  supernatural power, it is most amazing that materialists still consider  themselves within the bounds and captivity of nature. The truth is that  God has endowed man with virtues, powers and ideal faculties of which  nature is entirely bereft and by which man is elevated, distinguished and  superior. We must thank God for these bestowals, for these powers He has  given us, for this crown He has placed upon our heads.    How shall we utilize these gifts and expend these bounties? By directing  our efforts toward the unification of the human race. We must use these  powers in establishing the oneness of the world of humanity; appreciate  these virtues by accomplishing the unity of the white and colored races;  devote this divine intelligence to the perfecting of amity and accord  among all branches of the human family, so that under the protection and  providence of God, the East and West may hold each other's hands and  become as lovers. Then will mankind be as one nation, one race and kind;  as waves of one ocean. Although these waves may differ in form and shape,  they are waves of the same sea. Flowers may be variegated in colors but  they are all flowers of one garden. Trees differ though they grow in the  same orchard. All are nourished and quickened into life by the bounty of  the same rain; all grow and develop by the heat and light of the one sun;  all are refreshed and exhilarated by the same breeze; that they may bring  forth varied fruits. This is according to the creative wisdom. If all  trees bore the same kind of fruit it would cease to be delicious. In their  never ending variety man finds enjoyment instead of monotony.    And now as I look into your faces I am reminded of trees varying in color  and form but all bearing luscious and delectable fruits, fragrant and  delightful to the inner and outer senses. The radiance and spirituality of  this meeting is through the favor of God. Our hearts are uplifted in  thankfulness to Him. Praise be to God! you are living upon the great  continent of the West enjoying the perfect liberty, security and peace of  this just government. There is no cause for sorrow or unhappiness  anywhere; every means of happiness and enjoyment is about you, for in this  human world there is no greater blessing than liberty. You do not know. I  who for forty years have been a prisoner, do know. I do know the value and  blessing of liberty. For you have been and are now living in freedom and  you have no fear of anybody. Is there a greater blessing than this?  Freedom! Liberty! Security! These are the great bestowals of God.  Therefore praise God!            SPIRITUAL SPRINGTIME      In the world of existence man has traversed successive degrees until he  has attained the human kingdom. In each degree of his progression he has  developed capacity for advancement to the next station and condition.  While in the kingdom of the mineral he was attaining the capacity for  promotion into the degree of the vegetable. In the kingdom of the  vegetable he underwent preparation for the world of the animal and from  thence he has come onward to the human degree or kingdom. Throughout this  journey of progression he has ever and always been potentially man.    In the beginning of his human life man was embryonic in the world of the  matrix. There he received capacity and endowment"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19239"],[0,"Bahá'í World Faith (#14)"],[1,"I hope the time will come when they shall live  together in the utmost peace, unity and friendship. I wish to say one  thing of importance to both in order that the white race may be just and  kind to the colored and that the colored race may in turn be grateful and  appreciative toward the white. The great proclamation of liberty and  emancipation from slavery was made upon this continent. A long bloody war  was fought by white men for the sake of colored people. These white men  forfeited their possessions and sacrificed their lives by thousands in  order that colored men might be freed from bondage. The colored population  of the United States of America are possibly not fully informed of the  wide-reaching effect of this freedom and emancipation upon their colored  brethren in Asia and Africa where even more terrible conditions of slavery  existed. Influenced and impelled by the example of the United States, the  European powers proclaimed universal liberty to the colored race and  slavery ceased to exist. This effort and accomplishment by the white  nations should never be lost sight of. Both races should rejoice in  gratitude, for the institution of liberty and equality here became the  cause of liberating your fellow-beings elsewhere. The colored people of  this country are especially fortunate, for, praise be to God! conditions  here are so much higher than in the East and comparatively few differences  exist in the possibility of equal attainments with the white race. May  both develop toward the highest degree of equality and altruism. May you  be drawn together in friendship and may extraordinary development make  brotherhood a reality and truth. I pray in your behalf that there shall be  no name other than that of humanity among you. For instance we say \"a  flock of doves,\" without mention or distinction as to white or black; we  apply the name \"horse,\" \"deer,\" \"gazelle\" to other creatures, referring to  species and not to their variance in color. It is my hope that through  love and fellowship we may advance to such a degree of mutual recognition  and estimate, that the oneness of the human world may be realized in each  and all present in this meeting.    Therefore strive earnestly and put forth your greatest endeavor toward the  accomplishment of this fellowship and the cementing of this bond of  brotherhood between you. Such an attainment is not possible without will  and effort on the part of each; from one, expressions of gratitude and  appreciation; from the other kindliness and recognition of equality. Each  one should endeavor to develop and assist the other toward mutual  advancement. This is possible only by conjoining of effort and  inclination. Love and unity will be fostered between you, thereby bringing  about the oneness of mankind. For the accomplishment of unity between the  colored and whites will be an assurance of the world's peace. Then racial  prejudice, national prejudice, limited patriotism and religious bias will  pass away and remain no longer. I am pleased to see you at this gathering,  white and dark, and I praise God that I have had this opportunity of  seeing you loving each other, for this is the means of the glory of  humanity. This is the means of the good-pleasure of God and of eternal  bliss in His kingdom. Therefore I pray in your behalf that you may attain  to the fullest degree of love and that the day may come when all  differences between you may disappear.          RELIGION AND CIVILIZATION      The greatest bestowal of God in the world of humanity is religion; for  assuredly the divine teachings of religion are above all other sources of  instruction and development to man. Religion confers upon man eternal life  and guides his footsteps in the world of morality. It opens the doors of  unending happiness and bestows everlasting honor upon the human kingdom.  It has been the basis of all civilization and progress in the history of  mankind.    We will therefore investigate religion, seeking from an unprejudiced  standpoint to discover whether it is the source of illumination, the cause  of development and the animating impulse of all human advancement. We will  investigate independently, free from the restrictions of dogmatic beliefs,  blind imitations of ancestral forms, and the influence of mere human  opinion; for as we enter this question we will find some who declare that  religion is a cause of uplift and betterment in the world, while others  assert just as positively that it is a detriment and a source of  degradation to mankind. We must give these questions thorough and  impartial consideration so that no doubt or uncertainty may linger in our  minds regarding them.    How shall we determine whether religion has been the cause of human  advancement or retrogression?    We will first consider the founders of the religions--the prophets--review  the story of their lives, compare the conditions preceding their  appearance with those subsequent to their departure, following historical  records and irrefutable facts instead of relying upon traditionary  statements which are open to both acceptance and denial.    Among the great prophets was His Holiness Abraham who being an iconoclast  and a herald of the oneness of God, was banished from His native land. He  founded a family upon which the blessing of God descended; and it was  owing to this religious basis and ordination that the Abrahamic house  progressed and advanced. Through the divine benediction, noteworthy and  luminous prophets issued from the lineage of His Holiness. There appeared  Isaac, Ishmael, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, David and Solomon. The Holy  Land was conquered by the power of the Covenant of God with Abraham, and  the glory of the Solomonic wisdom and sovereignty dawned. All this was due  to the religion of God which this blessed lineage established and upheld.  It is evident that throughout the history of Abraham and His posterity  this was the source of their honor, advancement and civilization. Even  today the descendants of His household and lineage are found throughout  the world.    There is another and more significant aspect to this religious impulse and  impetus. The children of Israel were in bondage and captivity in the land  of Egypt four hundred years. They were in an extreme state of degradation  and slavery under the tyranny and oppression of the Egyptians. While they  were in the condition of abject poverty, in the lowest degree of  abasement, ignorance and servility His Holiness Moses suddenly appeared  among them. Although He was but a shepherd, such majesty, grandeur and  efficiency became manifest in Him through the power of religion, that His  influence continues to this day. His prophethood was established  throughout the land and the law of His Word became the foundation of the  laws of the nations. This unique personage, single and alone, rescued the  children of Israel from bondage through the power of religious training  and discipline. He led them to the Holy Land and founded there a great  civilization which has become permanent and renowned and under which these  people attained the highest degree of honor and glory. He freed them from  bondage and captivity. He imbued them with qualities of progressiveness  and capability. They proved to be a civilizing people with instincts  toward education and scholastic attainment. Their philosophy became  renowned; their industries were celebrated throughout the nations. In all  lines of advancement which characterize a progressive people they achieved  distinction. In the splendor of the reign of Solomon their sciences and  arts advanced to such a degree that even the Greek philosophers journeyed  to Jerusalem to sit at the feet of the Hebrew sages and acquire the basis  of Israelitish law. According to eastern history this is an established  fact. Even Socrates visited the Jewish doctors in the Holy Land,  consorting with them and discussing the principles and basis of their  religious belief. After his return to Greece he formulated his  philosophical teaching of divine unity and advanced his belief in the  immortality of the spirit beyond the dissolution of the body. Without  doubt Socrates absorbed these verities from the wise men of the Jews with  whom he came in contact. Hippocrates and other philosophers of the Greeks  likewise visited Palestine and acquired wisdom from the Jewish prophets,  studying the basis of ethics and morality, returning to their country with  contributions which have made Greece famous.    When a movement fundamentally religious makes a weak nation strong,  changes a nondescript tribal people into a mighty and powerful  civilization, rescues them from captivity and elevates them to  sovereignty, transforms their ignorance into knowledge and endows them  with an impetus of advancement in all degrees of development--(this is not  theory, but historical fact)--it becomes evident that religion is the cause  of man's attainment to honor and sublimity.    But when we speak of religion we mean the essential foundation or reality  of religion, not the dogmas and blind imitations which have gradually  encrusted it and which are the cause of the decline and effacement of a  nation. These are inevitably destructive and a menace and hindrance to a  nation's life,--even as it is recorded in the Torah and confirmed in  history that when the Jews became fettered by empty forms and imitations  the wrath of God became manifest. When they forsook the foundations of the  law of God, Nebuchadnezzar came and conquered the Holy Land. He killed and  made captive the people of Israel, laid waste the country and populous  cities and burned the villages. Seventy thousand Jews were carried away  captive to Babylon. He destroyed Jerusalem, despoiled the great temple,  desecrated the holy of holies and burned the Torah, the heavenly book of  scriptures. Therefore we learn that allegiance to the"]]]
