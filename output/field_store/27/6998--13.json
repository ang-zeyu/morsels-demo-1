This room is 14x6 feet, besides the L running up next to  the kitchen, of 6x4 feet. From the kitchen also opens a closet into the  front part of the house for any purpose needed. This adjoins the parlor,  and sitting-room, closets. In the passage to the sitting-room also opens  the stairway leading to the chambers, and beneath, at the other end of  it, next the outside wall, is a flight leading down cellar. The cellar  is excavated under the whole house, being 36x22, and 34x16 feet, with  glass windows, one light deep by four wide, of 8x10 glass; and an outer  door, and flight of steps outside, under either the sitting-room or  kitchen windows, as may be most convenient. A door opens, also, from the  kitchen, into a passage 4 feet wide and 12 feet long leading to the  wash-room, 18x16 feet, and by an outside door, through this passage to  the porch. In this passage may be a small window to give it light.    In the wash-room are two windows. A chimney at the far end accommodates  a boiler or two, and a fireplace, if required. A sink stands adjoining  the chimney. A flight of stairs, leading to a garret over head on one  side, and to the kitchen chamber on the other, stands next the dairy,  into which last a door also leads. In this wash-room may be located the  cooking stove in warm weather, leaving the main kitchen for a family and  eating room. A door also leads from the wash-room into the wood-house.    The wood-house stands lower than the floor of the wash-room, from which  it falls, by steps. This is large, because a plentiful store of wood is  needed for a dwelling of this character. If the room be not all wanted  for such purpose, a part of it may devoted to other necessary uses,  there seldom being too much shelter of this kind on a farm; through the  rear wall of this wood-house leads a door into the garden, or  clothes-yard, as the case may be; and at its extreme angle is a water  closet, 6x4 feet, by way of lean-to, with a hipped roof, 8 feet high,  running off from both the wood-house and workshop. This water-closet is  lighted by a sliding sash window.    On to the wood-house, in a continuous front line, joins the workshop, an  indispensable appendage to farm convenience. This has a flight of stairs  leading to the lumber-room above. For the furnishing of this apartment,  see description of Design I. Next to the work-house is the wagon and  tool-house, above which is the hay loft, also spread over the stable  adjoining; in which last are stalls for a pair of horses, which may be  required for uses other than the main labors of the farm--to run to  market, carry the family to church, or elsewhere. A pair of horses for  such purposes should always be kept near the house. The horse-stalls  occupy a space of 10x12 feet, with racks and feeding boxes. The plans of  these will be described hereafter. The door leading out from these  stalls is 5 feet wide, and faces the partition, so that each horse may  be led out or in at an easy angle from them. Beyond the stalls is a  passage 4 feet wide, leading to a store-room or area, from which a  flight of rough stairs leads to the hay loft above. Beyond this room,  in which is the oat bin for the horses, is a small piggery, for the  convenience of a pig or two, which are always required to consume the  daily wash and offal of the house; and not for the general _pork_ stock  of the farm; which, on one of this size, may be expected to require more  commodious quarters.    The chamber plan of this house is commodious, furnishing one large room  and three smaller ones. The small chamber leading to the deck over the  porch, may, or may not be occupied as a sleeping room. The small one  near the stairs may contain a single bed, or be occupied as a large  clothes-closet. Through this, a door leads into the kitchen chamber,  which may serve as one, or more laborers' bed-chambers. They may be  lighted by one or more windows in the rear gable.    If more convenient to the family, the parlor and sitting-room, already  described, may change their occupation, and one substituted for the  other.    The main business approach to this house should be by a lane, or farm  road opening on the side next the stable and wagon-house. The yard, in  front of these last named buildings, should be separated from the lawn,  or front door-yard of the dwelling. The establishment should stand some  distance back from the traveled highway, and be decorated with such  trees, shrubbery, and cultivation, as the taste of the owner may direct.  No _general_ rules or directions can be applicable to this design beyond  what have already been given; and the subject must be treated as  circumstances may suggest. The unfrequented side of the house should,  however, be flanked with a garden, either ornamental, or fruit and  vegetable; as buildings of this character ought to command a  corresponding share of attention with the grounds by which they are  surrounded.    This house will appear equally well built of wood, brick, or stone. Its  cost, according to materials, or finish, may be $1,000 or $1,500. The  out-buildings attached, will add $400 to $600, with the same conditions  as to finish; but the whole may be substantially and well built of  either stone, brick, or wood, where each may be had at equal  convenience, for $2,000 in the interior of New York. Of course, it is  intended to do all the work plain, and in character for the occupation  to which it is intended.      MISCELLANEOUS DETAILS.    At this point of our remarks a word or two may be offered on the general  subject of inside finish to farm houses, which may be applicable more or  less to any one, or all of the designs that may come under our  observation; therefore what is here said, may be applied at large.  Different sections of the United States have their own several _local_  notions, or preferences as to the mode of finish to their houses and  out-buildings, according to climate, education, or other circumstances.  In all these matters neither taste, fashion, nor climate should be  arbitrary. The manner of finish may be various, without any departure  from truth or propriety--always keeping in mind the object for which it  is intended. The _material_ for a country house should be _strong_, and  _durable_, and the work simple in its details, beyond that for either  town or suburban houses. It should be _strong_, for the reason that the  interior of the farm house is used for purposes of industry, in  finishing up and perfecting the labors of the farm; labors indispensable  too, and in amount beyond the ordinary housekeeping requirements of a  family who have little to do but merely to live, and make themselves  comfortable. The material should be _durable_, because the distance at  which the farm house is usually located from the residences of building  mechanics, renders it particularly troublesome and expensive to make  repairs, and alterations. The work should be _simple_, because cheaper  in the first place, in construction, and finish; quite as appropriate  and satisfactory in appearance; and demanding infinitely less labor and  pains to care for, and protect it afterward. Therefore all mouldings,  architraves, _chisel_-work, and gewgawgery in interior finish should be  let alone in the living and daily occupied rooms of the house. If, to a  single parlor, or _spare_ bedchamber a little _ornamental_ work be  permitted, let even that be in moderation, and just enough to teach the  active mistress and her daughters what a world of scrubbing and elbow  work they have saved themselves in the enjoyment of a plainly-finished  house, instead of one full of gingerbread work and finery. None but the  initiated can tell the affliction that _chiseled_ finishing entails on  housekeepers in the spider, fly, and other insect lodgment which it  invites--frequently the cause of more annoyance and _daily_ disquietude  in housekeeping, because unnecessary, than real griefs from which we may  not expect to escape. Bases, casings, sashes, doors--all should be  plain, and painted or stained a quiet _russet_ color--a color natural to  the woods used for the finish, if it can be, showing, in their wear, as  little of dust, soiling, and fly dirt as possible. There is no poetry  about common housekeeping. Cooking, house-cleaning, washing, scrubbing,  sweeping, are altogether matter-of-fact duties, and usually considered  _work_, not recreation; and these should all be made easy of  performance, and as seldom to be done as possible; although the first  item always was, and always _will_ be, and the last item _should_ be, an  every-day vocation for _somebody_; and the manner of inside finish to a  house has a great deal to do with all these labors.    In a stone, or brick house, the inside walls should be firred off for  plastering. This may be done either by \"plugging,\" that is, driving a  plug of wood strongly into the mortar courses, into which the firring  should be nailed, or by laying a strip of thin board in the mortar  course, the entire length of each wall. This is better than _blocks_  laid in for such purpose, because it is effectually _bound_ by the  stone, or brick work; whereas, a block may get loose by shrinking, but  the nails which hold the firring to the plug, or to the thin strip of  board will split and _wedge_ it closer to the mason work of the outside  wall. This is an important item. It makes close work too, and leaves no  room for rats, mice, or other vermin; and as it admits a _space_--no  matter how thin--so that no outside damp from the walls can communicate  into, or through the inner plastering, it answers all purposes. The  inside, and partition walls should be of coarse, strong mortar, _floated  off_ as smoothly as may "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/200"],[0,"The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia, Volume 1 of 28 (#14)"],[1,"ward,--the  former containing the menial, the latter the monastic  buildings.  The precincts are entered by a gateway (P), at  the extreme western extremity, giving admission to the lower  ward.  Here the barns, granaries, stables, shambles, workshops  and workmen,s lodgings were placed, without any regard to  symmetry, convenience being the only consideration.  Advancing  eastwards, we have before us the wall separating the        FIG. 6.--.Clairvaux, No. 1 (Cistercian), General        A. Cloisters.         I. Wine-press and       O. Public presse.    B.

On passing through the gateway, the outer  court of the inner ward was entered, with the western facade  of the monastic church in front.  Immediately on the right  of entrance was the abbot's house (G), in close proximity to  the guest-house (F). On the other side of the court were the  stables, for the accommodation of the horses of the guests  and their attendants (H). The church occupied a central  position.  To the south was the great cloister (A),  surrounded by the chief monastic buildings, and farther to  the east the smaller cloister, opening out of which were  the infirmary, novices' lodgings and quarters for the aged  monks.  Still farther to the east, divided from the monastic  buildings by a wall, were the vegetable gardens and orchards,  and tank for fish.  The large fish-ponds, an indispensable  adjunct to any ecclesiastical foundation, on the formation  of which the monks lavished extreme care and pains, and  which often remain as almost the only visible traces of these  vast establishments, were placed outside the abbey walls.    Plan No. 2 furninshes the ichnography of the distinctly  monastic buildings on a larger scale.  The usually unvarying  arrangement of the Cistercian houses allows us to accept  this as a type of the monasteries of this order.  The church  (A) is the chief feature.  It consists of a vast nave of  eleven bays, entered by a narthex, with a transept and short  apsidal choir. (It may be remarked that the eastern limb in  all unaltered Cistercian churches is remarkably short, and  usually square.) To the east of each limb of the transept  are two square chapels, divided according to Cistercian  rule by solid walls.  Nine radiating chapels, similarly  divided, surround the apse.  The stalls of the monks,  forming the ritual choir, occupy the four eastern bays of the  nave.  There was a second range of stalls in the extreme  western bays of the nave for the fratres conversi, or lay  brothers.  To the south of the church, so as to secure as  much sun as possible, the cloister was invariably placed,  except when local reasons forbade it.  Round the cloister  (B) were ranged the buildings connected with the monks' daily  life.  The chapter-house (C) always opened out of the east  walk of the cloister in a line with the south transept.          FIG. 7.--Clairvaux, No. 2 (Cistercian), Monastic        A. Church.            L.

Undercroft of dormitory.                          R. Stables.      In Cistercian houses this was quadrangular, and was divided  by pillars and arches into two or three aisles.  Between  it and the transept we find the sacristy (X), and a small  book-room (Y) armariolum, where the brothers deposited the  volumes borrowed from the library.  On the other side of the  chapter-house, to the south, is a passage (D) communicating  with the courts and buildings beyond.  This was sometimes  known as the parlour, colloquii locus, the monks having the  privilege of conversation here.  Here also, when iscipline  became relaxed, traders, who had the liberty of admission,  were allowed to display their goods.  Beyond this we often  find the calefactorium or day-room--an apartment warmed  by flues beneath the pavement, where the brethren, half  frozen during the night offices, betook themselves after  the conclusion of lauds, to gain a little warmth, grease  their sandals and get themselves ready for the work of the  day.  In the plan before us this apartment (E) opens from the  south cloister walk, adjoining the refectory.  The place usually  assigned to it is occupied by the vaulted substructure of the  dormitory (Z). The dormitory, as a rule, was placed on the  east side of the cloister, running over the calethetory and  chapter-house, and joined the south transept, where a flight  of steps admitted the brethren into the church for nocturnal  services.  Opening out of the dormitory was always the  necessarium, planned with the greatest regard to health and  cleanliness, a water-course invariably running from end to  end.  The refectory opens out of the south cloister at G.  The position of the refectory is usually a marked point of  difference between Benedictine and Cistercian abbeys.  In the  former, as at Canterbury, the refectory ran east and west  parallel to the nave of the church, on the side of the cloister  farthest removed from it.  In the Cistercian monasturies, to  keep the noise and smell of dinner still farther away from  the sacred building, the refectory was built north and south,  at right angles to the axis of the church.  It was often  divided, sometimes into two, sometimes, as here, into three  aisles.  Outside the refectory door, in the cloister,  was the lavatory, where the monks washed their hands at  dinner-time.  The buildings belonging to the material life of  the monks lay near the refectory, as far as possible from the  church, to the S.W. With a distinct entrance from the outer  court was the kitchen court (F), with its buttery, scullery  and larder, and the important adjunct of a stream of running  water.  Farther to the west, projecting beyond the line of  the west front of the church, were vast vaulted apartments  (SS), serving as cellars and storehouses, above which was  the dormitory of the conversi. Detached from these, and  separated entirely from the monastic buildings, were various  workshops, which convenience repuired to be banished to  the outer precincts, a saw-mill and oil-mill (UU) turned  by water, and a currier's shop (V), where the sandals  and leathern girdles of the monks were made and repaired.    Returning to the cloister, a vaulted passage admitted to the small  cloister (l), opening from the north side of which were eight  small cells, assigned to the scribes employed in copying works  for the library, which was placed in the upper story, accessible  by a turret staircase.  To the south of the small cloister  a long hall will be noticed.  This was a lecture-hall, or  rather a hall for the religious disputations customary among the  Cistercians.  From this cloister opened the infirmary (K),  with its hall, chapel, cells, blood-letting house and other  dependencies.  At the eastern verge of the vast group of buildings  we find the novices' lodgings (L), with a third cloister  near the novices' quarters and the original guest-house (M).  Detached from the great mass of the monastic edifices was the  original abbot's house (N), with its dining-hall (P). Closely  adjoining to this, so that the eye of the father of the whole  establishment should be constantly over those who stood the  most in need of his watchful care,--those who were training  for the monastic life, and those who had worn themselves  out in its duties,--was a fourth cloister (O), with annexed  buildings, devoted to the aged and infirm members of the  establishment.  The cemetery, the last resting-place of the  brethren, lay to the north side of the nave of the church (H).    It will be seen from the above account that the arrangement of  a Cistercian monastery was in accordance with a clearly defined  system, and admirably adapted to its purpose.  The base court  nearest to the outer wall contained the buildings belonging to  the functions of the body as agriculturists and employers of  labour.  Advancing into the inner court, the buildings`devoted  to hospitality are found close to the entrance; while those  connected with the supply of the material wants of the brethren,  --the kitchen, cellars, &c.,--form a court of themselves  outside the cloister and quite detached from the church.  The church refectory, dormitory and other buildings belonging  to the professional life of the brethren surround the great  cloister.  The small cloister beyond, with its scribes' cells,  library, hall for disputations, &c., is the centre of the  literary life of the community.  The requirements of sickness  and old age are carefully provided for in the infirmary  cloister and that for the aged and infirm members of the  establishment.  The same group contains the quarters of the novices.    This stereotyped arrangement is further shown by the  illustration of the mother establishment of Citeaux.    Citeaux.
