[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/175"],[0,"The Phantom of the Opera (#14)"],[1," urged her, in his chief's name, to commit no imprudence,  to stay at home all day and to be careful of drafts; and Carlotta could  not help, after he had gone, comparing this unusual and unexpected  advice with the threats contained in the letter.    It was five o'clock when the post brought a second anonymous letter in  the same hand as the first.  It was short and said simply:    You have a bad cold.  If you are wise, you will see that it is madness  to try to sing to-night.    Carlotta sneered, shrugged her handsome shoulders and sang two or three  notes to reassure herself.    Her friends were faithful to their promise.  They were all at the Opera  that night, but looked round in vain for the fierce conspirators whom  they were instructed to suppress.  The only unusual thing was the  presence of M. Richard and M. Moncharmin in Box Five.  Carlotta's  friends thought that, perhaps, the managers had wind, on their side, of  the proposed disturbance and that they had determined to be in the  house, so as to stop it then and there; but this was unjustifiable  supposition, as the reader knows.  M. Richard and M. Moncharmin were  thinking of nothing but their ghost.    \"Vain!  In vain do I call, through my vigil weary, On creation and its  Lord!  Never reply will break the silence dreary!  No sign!  No single  word!\"    The famous baritone, Carolus Fonta, had hardly finished Doctor Faust's  first appeal to the powers of darkness, when M. Firmin Richard, who was  sitting in the ghost's own chair, the front chair on the right, leaned  over to his partner and asked him chaffingly:    \"Well, has the ghost whispered a word in your ear yet?\"    \"Wait, don't be in such a hurry,\" replied M. Armand Moncharmin, in the  same gay tone.  \"The performance has only begun and you know that the  ghost does not usually come until the middle of the first act.\"    The first act passed without incident, which did not surprise  Carlotta's friends, because Margarita does not sing in this act.  As  for the managers, they looked at each other, when the curtain fell.    \"That's one!\" said Moncharmin.    \"Yes, the ghost is late,\" said Firmin Richard.    \"It's not a bad house,\" said Moncharmin, \"for 'a house with a curse on  it.'\"    M. Richard smiled and pointed to a fat, rather vulgar woman, dressed in  black, sitting in a stall in the middle of the auditorium with a man in  a broadcloth frock-coat on either side of her.    \"Who on earth are 'those?'\" asked Moncharmin.    \"'Those,' my dear fellow, are my concierge, her husband and her  brother.\"    \"Did you give them their tickets?\"    \"I did ... My concierge had never been to the Opera--this is, the first  time--and, as she is now going to come every night, I wanted her to  have a good seat, before spending her time showing other people to  theirs.\"    Moncharmin asked what he meant and Richard answered that he had  persuaded his concierge, in whom he had the greatest confidence, to  come and take Mme. Giry's place.  Yes, he would like to see if, with  that woman instead of the old lunatic, Box Five would continue to  astonish the natives?    \"By the way,\" said Moncharmin, \"you know that Mother Giry is going to  lodge a complaint against you.\"    \"With whom?  The ghost?\"    The ghost!  Moncharmin had almost forgotten him.  However, that  mysterious person did nothing to bring himself to the memory of the  managers; and they were just saying so to each other for the second  time, when the door of the box suddenly opened to admit the startled  stage-manager.    \"What's the matter?\" they both asked, amazed at seeing him there at  such a time.    \"It seems there's a plot got up by Christine Daae's friends against  Carlotta.  Carlotta's furious.\"    \"What on earth ... ?\" said Richard, knitting his brows.    But the curtain rose on the kermess scene and Richard made a sign to  the stage-manager to go away.  When the two were alone again,  Moncharmin leaned over to Richard:    \"Then Daae has friends?\" he asked.    \"Yes, she has.\"    \"Whom?\"    Richard glanced across at a box on the grand tier containing no one but  two men.    \"The Comte de Chagny?\"    \"Yes, he spoke to me in her favor with such warmth that, if I had not  known him to be Sorelli's friend ...\"    \"Really?  Really?\" said Moncharmin.  \"And who is that pale young man  beside him?\"    \"That's his brother, the viscount.\"    \"He ought to be in his bed.  He looks ill.\"    The stage rang with gay song:                \"Red or white liquor,              Coarse or fine!              What can it matter,              So we have wine?\"    Students, citizens, soldiers, girls and matrons whirled light-heartedly  before the inn with the figure of Bacchus for a sign.  Siebel made her  entrance.  Christine Daae looked charming in her boy's clothes; and  Carlotta's partisans expected to hear her greeted with an ovation which  would have enlightened them as to the intentions of her friends.  But  nothing happened.    On the other hand, when Margarita crossed the stage and sang the only  two lines allotted her in this second act:             \"No, my lord, not a lady am I, nor yet a beauty,           And do not need an arm to help me on my way,\"    Carlotta was received with enthusiastic applause.  It was so unexpected  and so uncalled for that those who knew nothing about the rumors looked  at one another and asked what was happening.  And this act also was  finished without incident.    Then everybody said:  \"Of course, it will be during the next act.\"    Some, who seemed to be better informed than the rest, declared that the  \"row\" would begin with the ballad of the KING OF THULE and rushed to  the subscribers' entrance to warn Carlotta.  The managers left the box  during the entr'acte to find out more about the cabal of which the  stage-manager had spoken; but they soon returned to their seats,  shrugging their shoulders and treating the whole affair as silly.    The first thing they saw, on entering the box, was a box of English  sweets on the little shelf of the ledge.  Who had put it there?  They  asked the box-keepers, but none of them knew.  Then they went back to  the shelf and, next to the box of sweets, found an opera glass.  They  looked at each other.  They had no inclination to laugh.  All that Mme.  Giry had told them returned to their memory ... and then ... and then  ... they seemed to feel a curious sort of draft around them ... They  sat down in silence.    The scene represented Margarita's garden:                \"Gentle flow'rs in the dew,                  Be message from me ...\"    As she sang these first two lines, with her bunch of roses and lilacs  in her hand, Christine, raising her head, saw the Vicomte de Chagny in  his box; and, from that moment, her voice seemed less sure, less  crystal-clear than usual.  Something seemed to deaden and dull her  singing...    \"What a queer girl she is!\" said one of Carlotta's friends in the  stalls, almost aloud.  \"The other day she was divine; and to-night  she's simply bleating.  She has no experience, no training.\"                \"Gentle flow'rs, lie ye there                  And tell her from me ...\"    The viscount put his head under his hands and wept.  The count, behind  him, viciously gnawed his mustache, shrugged his shoulders and frowned.  For him, usually so cold and correct, to betray his inner feelings like  that, by outward signs, the count must be very angry.  He was.  He had  seen his brother return from a rapid and mysterious journey in an  alarming state of health.  The explanation that followed was  unsatisfactory and the count asked Christine Daae for an appointment.  She had the audacity to reply that she could not see either him or his  brother...                \"Would she but deign to hear me              And with one smile to cheer me ...\"    \"The little baggage!\" growled the count.    And he wondered what she wanted.  What she was hoping for... She was a  virtuous girl, she was said to have no friend, no protector of any sort  ...  That angel from the North must be very artful!    Raoul, behind the curtain of his hands that veiled his boyish tears,  thought only of the letter which he received on his return to Paris,  where Christine, fleeing from Perros like a thief in the night, had  arrived before him:    MY DEAR LITTLE PLAYFELLOW:    You must have the courage not to see me again, not to speak of me  again.  If you love me just a little, do this for me, for me who will  never forget you, my dear Raoul.  My life depends upon it.  Your life  depends upon it.  YOUR LITTLE CHRISTINE.    Thunders of applause.  Carlotta made her entrance.               \"I wish I could but know who was he             That addressed me,             If he was noble, or, at least, what his name is ...\"    When Margarita had finished singing the ballad of the KING OF THULE,  she was loudly cheered and again when she came to the end of the jewel  song:                \"Ah, the joy of past compare              These jewels bright to wear! ...\"    Thenceforth, certain of herself, certain of her friends in the house,  certain of her voice and her success, fearing nothing, Carlotta flung  herself into her part without restraint of modesty ...  She was no  longer Margarita, she was Carmen.  She was applauded all the more; and  her debut with Faust seemed about to bring her a new success, when  suddenly ... a terrible thing happened.    Faust had knelt on one knee:             \"Let me gaze on the form below me,               While from yonder ether blue           Look how the star of eve, bright and tender,                  lingers o'er me,               To love thy beauty too!\"    And Margarita replied:             \"Oh, how strange!               Like a spell does the evening bind me!           And a deep languid charm           I feel without alarm               With its melody enwind me           And all my heart subdue.\"    At that moment, at that identical moment, the terrible thing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17530"],[0,"Maida's Little Shop (#14)"],[1,"by' yet. My, but she's a case! If I didn't watch her  all the time, every pan in this room would be on the floor in a  jiffy. And she tears everything she puts her hands on.\"    \"Granny must see her sometime--Granny's name is Delia.\"    \"Hi, stop that!\" Dicky called. For Delia had discovered the little  bundle that Maida had placed on a chair, and was busy trying to tear  it open.    \"Let her open it,\" Maida said, \"I brought it for her.\"    They watched.    It took a long time, but Delia sat down, giving her whole attention  to it. Finally her busy fingers pulled off so much paper that a pair  of tiny rubber dolls dropped into her lap.    \"Say 'Thank you, Maida,'\" Dicky prompted.    Delia said something and Dicky assured her that the baby had obeyed  him. It sounded like, \"Sank-oo-Maysa.\"    While Delia occupied herself with the dolls, Maida listened to  Dicky's reading lesson. He was getting on beautifully now. At least  he could puzzle out by himself some of the stories that Maida lent  him. When they had finished that day's fairy-tale, Dicky said:    \"Did you ever see a peacock, Maida?\"    \"Oh, yes--a great many.\"    \"Where?\"    \"I saw ever so many in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris and then my  father has some in his camp in the Adirondacks.\"    \"Has he many?\"    \"A dozen.\"    \"I'm just wild to see one. Are they as beautiful as that picture in  the fairy-tale?\"    \"They're as beautiful as--as--\" Maida groped about in her mind to find  something to compare them to \"--as angels,\" she said at last.    \"And do they really open their tails like a fan?\"    \"That is the most wonderful sight, Dicky, that you ever saw.\"  Maida's manner was almost solemn. \"When they unfurl the whole fan  and the sun shines on all the green and blue eyes and on all the  little gold feathers, it's so beautiful. Well, it makes you ache. I  _cried_ the first time I saw one. And when their fans are down, they  carry them so daintily, straight out, not a single feather trailing  on the ground. There are two white peacocks on the Adirondacks  place.\"    \"_White_ peacocks! I never heard of white ones.\"    \"They're not common.\"    \"Think of seeing a dozen peacocks every day!\" Dicky exclaimed.  \"Jiminy crickets! Why, Maida, your life must have been just like a  fairy-tale when you lived there.\"    \"It seems more like a fairy-tale here.\"    They laughed at this difference of opinion.    \"Dicky,\" Maida asked suddenly, \"do you know that Rosie steals out of  her window at night sometimes when her mother doesn't know it?\"    \"Sure--I know that. You see,\" he went on to explain, \"it's like this.  Rosie is an awful bad girl in some ways--there's no doubt about that.  But my mother says Rosie isn't as bad as she seems. My mother says  Rosie's mother has never learned how to manage her. She whips Rosie  an awful lot. And the more she whips Rosie, the naughtier she gets.  Rosie says she's going to run away some day, and by George, I bet  she'll do it. She always does what she says she'll do.\"    \"Isn't it dreadful?\" Maida said in a frightened tone. \"Run away! I  never heard of such a thing. Think of having a mother and then not  getting along with her. Suppose she died sometime, as my mother  did.\"    \"I don't know what I'd do without my mother,\" Dicky said  thoughtfully. \"But then I've got the best mother that ever was. I  wish she didn't have to work so hard. But you wait until I get on my  feet. Then you'll see how I'm going to earn money for her.\"    When Maida got home that night, Billy Potter sat with Granny in the  living-room. Maida came in so quietly that they took no notice of  her. Granny was talking. Maida could see that the tears were  coursing down the wrinkles in her cheeks.    \"And after that, the poor choild ran away to America and I niver  have seen her since. Her father died repenting av his anger aginst  her. But ut was too late. At last, in me old age, Oi came over to  America, hoping Oi cud foind her. But, glory be, Oi had no idea  'twas such a big place! And Oi've hunted and Oi've hunted and Oi've  hunted. But niver a track of her cud Oi foind--me little Annie!\"    Billy's face was all screwed up, but it was not with laughter. \"Did  you ever speak to Mr. Westabrook about it?\"    \"Oh, Misther Westabruk done iv'ry t'ing he cud--the foine man that he  is. Adver_tise_ments and _de_tayktives, but wid all his money, he  cudn't foind out a t'ing. If ut wasn't for my blissed lamb, I'd pray  to the saints to let me die.\"    Maida knew what they were talking about--Granny had often told her  the sad story of her lost daughter.    \"What town in Ireland did you live in, Granny?\" Billy asked.    \"Aldigarey, County Sligo.\" \"Now don't you get discouraged, Granny,\"  Billy said, \"I'm going to find your daughter for you.\"    He jumped to his feet and walked about the room. \"I'm something of a  detective myself, and you'll see I'll make good on this job if it  takes twenty years.\"    \"Oh, Billy, do--please do,\" Maida burst in. \"It will make Granny so  happy.\"    Granny seemed happier already. She dried her tears.    \"'Tis the good b'y ye are, Misther Billy,\" she said gratefully.    \"Yes, m'm,\" said Billy.                                     CHAPTER VII: TROUBLE      The next week was a week of trouble for Maida. Everything seemed to  go wrong from the first tinkle of the bell, Monday morning, to the  last tinkle Saturday night.    It began with a conversation.    Rosie came marching in early Monday, head up, eyes flaming.    \"Maida,\" she began at once, in her quickest, briskest tone, \"I've  got something to tell you. Laura Lathrop came over to Dicky's house  the other day while the W.M.N.T.'s were meeting and she told us the  greatest mess of stuff about you. I told her I was coming right over  and tell you about it and she said, 'All right, you can.' Laura said  that you said that last summer you had a birthday party that you  invited five hundred children to. She said that you said that you  had a May-pole at this party and a fish pond and a Punch and Judy  show and all sorts of things. She said that you said that you had a  big doll-house and a little theater all your own. I said that I  didn't believe that you told her all that. Did you?\"    \"Oh, yes, I told her that--and more,\" Maida answered directly.    \"Laura said it was all a pack of lies, but I don't believe that. Is  it all true?\"    \"It's all true,\" Maida said.    Rosie looked at her hard. \"You know, Maida,\" she went on after  awhile, \"you told me about a lot of birds and animals that your  father had. I thought he kept a bird-place. But Dicky says you told  him that your father had twelve peacocks, not in a store, but in a  place where he lives.\" She paused and looked inquiringly at Maida.    Maida answered the look. \"Yes, I told him that.\"    \"And it's all true?\" Rosie asked again.    \"Yes, it's all true,\" Maida repeated.    Rosie hesitated a moment. \"Harold Lathrop says that you're daffy.\"    Maida said nothing.    \"Arthur Duncan says,\" Rosie went on more timidly, \"that you probably  dreamed those things.\"    Still Maida said nothing.    \"Do you think you did dream them, Maida?\"    Maida smiled. \"No, I didn't dream them.\"    \"Well, I thought of another thing,\" Rosie went on eagerly. \"Miss  Allison told mother that Granny told her that you'd been sick for a  long time. And I thought, maybe you were out of your head and  imagined those things. Oh, Maida,\" Rosie's voice actually coaxed her  to favor this theory, \"don't you think you imagined them?\"    Maida laughed. \"No, Rosie,\" she said in her quietest voice, \"I did  not imagine them.\"    For a moment neither of the two little girls spoke. But they stared,  a little defiantly, into each other's eyes.    \"What did Dicky say?\" Maida asked after awhile.    \"Oh, Dicky said he would believe anything you told him, no matter  what it was. Dicky says he believes you're a princess in  disguise--like in fairy-tales.\"    \"Dear, dear Dicky!\" Maida said. \"He was the first friend I made in  Primrose Court and I guess he's the best one.\"    \"Well, I guess I'm your friend,\" Rosie said, firing up; \"I told that  little smarty-cat of a Laura if she ever said one word against you,  I'd slap her good and hard. Only--only--it seems strange that a little  girl who's just like the rest of us should have story-book things  happening to her all the time. If it's true--then fairy-tales are  true.\" She paused and looked Maida straight in the eye. \"I can't  believe it, Maida. But I know you believe it. And that's all there  is to it. But you'd better believe I'm your friend.\"    Saying which she marched out.    Maida's second trouble began that night.    It had grown dark. Suddenly, without any warning, the door of the  shop flew open. For an instant three or four voices filled the place  with their yells. Then the door shut. Nothing was heard but the  sound of running feet.    Granny and Maida rushed to the door. Nobody was in sight.    \"Who was it? What does it mean, Granny?\" Maida asked in  bewilderment. \"Only naughty b'ys, taysing you,\" Granny explained.    Maida had hardly seated herself when the performance was repeated.  Again she rushed to the door. Again she saw nobody. The third time  she did not stir from her chair.    Tuesday night the same thing happened. Who the boys were Maida could  not find out. Why they bothered her, she could not guess.    \"Take no notuce av ut, my lamb,\" Granny counselled. \"When they foind  you pay no attintion to ut, they'll be afther stopping.\"    Maida followed Granny's advice. But the annoyance did not cease and  she began to dread the twilight. She made up her mind that she must  put an end to it soon. She knew she could stop it at once by  appealing to Billy Potter. And, yet, somehow, she did not want to  ask for outside help. She had a feeling of pride about handling her  own troubles.    One afternoon Laura came into the shop. It was the first time that  Maida had seen her since the afternoon of her call and Maida did"]]]
