This behaviour may  be easily shown experimentally. We will dissolve some \"cake alum\" or  normal sulphate of alumina, Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}, in water, and boil some  of the solution. No deposit or precipitate is produced; the salt is  stable. To another portion of the solution we will add some caustic  soda, NaOH, in order to rob the normal sulphate of alumina of some of  its sulphuric acid. This makes the sulphate of alumina basic, and the  more basic, the more caustic soda is added, the sodium (Na) of the  caustic soda combining with the SO_{4} of the sulphate of alumina to  form sulphate of soda (Na_{2}SO_{4}), whilst the hydroxyl (OH) of the  caustic soda takes the position previously occupied by the SO_{4}. But  this increase of basicity also means decrease of stability, for on  boiling the solution, which now contains a basic sulphate of alumina, a  precipitate is formed, a result which also follows if more caustic soda  is added, production of still more basic salts or of hydrated alumina,  Al_{2}(OH)_{6}, taking place in either case.    _Mordanting or Fixing Acid (Phenolic) Colours._--But what has all this  to do with mordanting? is possibly now the inquiry. So much as this,  that only such unstable salts as I have just described, which decompose  and yield precipitates by the action on them of alkalis, heat, the  textile fibres themselves, or other agencies, are suitable to act as  true mordants. Hence, generally, the sources or root substances of the  best and most efficient mordants are the metals of high specific  appetite or valency. I think we have now got a clue to the principle of  mordants and also to the importance of a sound chemical knowledge in  dealing most effectively with them, and I may tell you that the man who  did most to elucidate the theory of mordanting is not a practical man in  the general sense of the term, but a man of the highest scientific  attainments and standing, namely, Professor Liechti, who, with his  colleague Professor Suida, did probably more than any other man to clear  up much that heretofore was cloudy in this region. We have seen that  with aluminium sulphate, basic salts are precipitated, _i.e._ salts with  such a predominance of appetite for acids, or such _quasi_-acids as  phenolic substances, that if such bodies were present they would combine  with the basic parts of those precipitated salts as soon as the latter  were formed, and all would be precipitated together as one complex  compound. Just such peculiar _quasi_-acid, or phenolic substances are  Alizarin, and most of the natural adjective dyestuffs, the colouring  principles of logwood, cochineal, Persian berries, etc. Hence these  substances will be combined and carried down with such precipitated  basic salts. The complex compounds thus produced are coloured substances  known as lakes. For example, if I take a solution containing basic  sulphate of alumina, prepared as I have already described, and add to  some Alizarin, and then heat the mixture, I shall get a red lake of  Alizarin and alumina precipitated. If I had taken sulphate of iron  instead of sulphate of alumina, and proceeded in a similar manner, and  added Alizarin, I should have obtained a dark purple lake. Now if you  imagine these reactions going on in a single fibre of a textile  material, you have grasped the theory and purpose of mordanting. The  textile fabric is drawn through the alumina solution to fill the pores  and tubes of the fabric; it is then passed through a weak alkaline bath  to basify or render basic the aluminium salt in the pores; and then it  is finally carried into the dye-bath and heated there, in order to  precipitate the colour lake in the fibre. The method usually employed to  mordant woollen fabrics consists in boiling them with weak solutions of  the metallic salts used as mordants, often with the addition of acid  salts, cream of tartar, and the like. A partial decomposition of the  metallic salts ensues, and it is induced by several conditions: (1) The  dilution of the liquid; (2) the heating of the solution; (3) the  presence of the fibre, which itself tends to cause the breaking up of  the metallic salts into less soluble basic ones. Thus it is not really  necessary to use basic aluminium sulphate for mordanting wool, since the  latter itself decomposes the normal or neutral sulphate of alumina on  heating, an insoluble basic sulphate being precipitated in the fibres of  the wool. (4) The presence of other added substances, as cream of  tartar, etc. The best alumina mordant is probably the acetate of  alumina (\"red liquor\"), and the best iron mordant, probably also the  acetate (\"iron liquor\") (see preceding lecture), because the acetic acid  is so harmless to the fibre, and is easily driven off on steaming, etc.  A further reason is that from the solution of acetate of iron or  alumina, basic acetates are very easily precipitated on heating, and are  thus readily deposited in the fibre.    _Mordanting and Fixing Basic Colours._--Now let us ask ourselves a very  important question. Suppose we have a colour or dyestuff, such as  Magenta, which is of a basic character, and not of an acid or phenolic  character like the colours Alizarin, Haematein (logwood), or carminic  acid (cochineal), and we wish to fix this basic dyestuff on the tissue.  Can we then use \"red liquor\" (acetate of alumina), acetate of iron,  copperas, etc.? The answer is, No; for such a process would be like  trying to combine base with base, instead of base with acid, in order to  form a salt. Combination, and so precipitation, would not take place; no  lake would be formed. We must seek for an acid or acid body to use as  mordant for our basic colour, and an acid or acid body that will form an  insoluble precipitate or colour-lake with the dyestuff. An acid much  used, and very valuable for this purpose, is tannic acid. The tannate of  rosaniline (colour principle of Magenta) is a tolerably insoluble lake,  which can be precipitated by Magenta from a solution of tannate of soda,  the Magenta being capable of displacing the soda. But tannic acid,  alone, does not form very fast lakes with Magenta and the other basic  dyestuffs, and so a means of rendering these lakes more insoluble is  needed. It is found that tannic acid and tartar emetic (a tartrate of  antimony and potash) yield a very insoluble compound, a tannate of  antimony. Perchloride of tin, in a similar manner, yields insoluble  tannate of tin with tannic acid. These insoluble compounds, however,  have sufficient acid-affinity left in the combined tannic acid to unite  also with the basic aniline colours, forming very fast or insoluble  colour lakes. This principle is extensively used in practice to fix  basic aniline colours, especially on cotton. We should first soak the  piece of cotton in a solution of tannic acid, and then pass it into a  solution, say, of tartar emetic, when the tannic acid will be firmly  fixed, as tannate of antimony, on the cotton. We then dip the mordanted  piece of cotton into the colour bath, containing, for instance, Magenta,  and it is dyed a fine red, composed of a tannate of antimony and  Magenta. You now see, no doubt, the necessity of sharply discriminating  between two classes of colouring matters, which we may term _colour  acids_ and _colour bases_ respectively. There are but few acids that act  like tannic acid in fixing basic aniline dyestuffs, but oleic acid and  other fatty acids are of the number. A curious question might now be  asked, namely: \"Could the acid colour Alizarin, if fixed on cotton  cloth, combine with a basic aniline colour, _e.g._ Aniline Violet, and  act as a mordant for it, thus fixing it?\" The answer is, \"Certainly\";  and thus an Alizarin Purple would be produced, whilst if Magenta were  used in place of Aniline Violet, an Alizarin Red of a crimson tone would  result.    _Chrome Mordanting of Wool and Fur._--In studying this subject I would  recommend a careful perusal of the chapter on \"Mordants\" in J.J.  Hummel's book, entitled _The Dyeing of Textile Fabrics_, and pages 337  to 340 of Bowman's work on _The Wool-Fibre_.    In the treatment of wool or fur with bichrome (potassium bichromate) we  start with an acid salt, a bichromate (K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}) and a strong  oxidising agent, and we finish with a basic substance, namely, oxide of  chromium, in the fibres of the wool or fur. If we desire to utilise the  whole of the chromic acid in our mordanting liquor, we must add to it  some sulphuric acid to set free the chromic acid from the potassium with  which it is combined. Bichromate of potash with sulphuric acid gives  sulphate of potash and chromic acid. The question of the proper  exhaustion of bichromate baths is an important economic one. Now we must  remember that this chromic acid (CrO_{3}) oxidises our wool or fur, and  must oxidise it before it can of itself act as a mordant by being  reduced in the process to hydrated chromic oxide, Cr_{2}O_{3} + 3  H_{2}O. [2 CrO_{3} (chromic acid) = Cr_{2}O_{3} (chromic oxide) + O_{3}  (oxygen).] It is this hydrated chromic oxide in the fibre that yields  with the Haematein of the logwood your logwood black dye. Mr. Jarmain  finds that it is not safe to use more than 3 per cent. (of the weight of  the wool) of bichromate; if 4 per cent. be used, the colour becomes  impaired, whilst if 12 per cent. be employed, the wool cannot be dyed at  all with logwood, the phenomenon known as \"over-chroming\" being the  result of such excessive treatment. I think there is no doubt, as  Professor Hummel says, that the colouring matter is oxidised and  destroyed in such over-chroming, but I also think that there can be no  doubt that the wool itself is also greatly injured and incapacitated for  taking up colour. Now the use of certain coal-tar black dyes in place of  logwood obviates this use of bichrome,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17748"],[0,"The Extermination of the American Bison (#14)"],[1,"seen first  along the lower parts of the neck and between the fore legs. The  heavily-haired parts are never bare, but, on the contrary, the amount of  hair upon them is about the same all the year round. The old and the new  hair cling together with provoking tenacity long after the old coat  should fall, and on several of the bulls we killed in October there were  patches of it still sticking tightly to the shoulders, from which it  had to be forcibly plucked away. Under all such patches the new hair was  of a different color from that around them.    The other process of shedding takes place on the body and hind quarters,  from which the old hair loosens and drops off in great woolly flakes a  foot square, more or less. The shedding takes place very unevenly, the  old hair remaining much longer in some places than in others. During  April, May, and June the body and hind quarters present a most ludicrous  and even pitiful spectacle. The island-like patches of persistent old  hair alternating with patches of bare brown skin are adorned (?) by  great ragged streamers of loose hair, which flutter in the wind like  signals of distress. Whoever sees a bison at this period is filled with  a desire to assist nature by plucking off the flying streamers of old  hair; but the bison never permits anything of the kind, however good  one's intentions may be. All efforts to dislodge the old hair are  resisted to the last extremity, and the buffalo generally acts as if the  intention were to deprive him of his skin itself. By the end of June, if  not before, the body and hind quarters are free from the old hair, and  as bare as the hide of a hippopotamus. The naked skin has a shiny brown  appearance, and of course the external anatomy of the animal is very  distinctly revealed. But for the long hair on the fore quarters, neck,  and head the bison would lose all his dignity of appearance with his  hair. As it is, the handsome black head, which is black with new hair as  early as the first of May, redeems the animal from utter homeliness.    After the shedding of the body hair, the naked skin of the buffalo is  burned by the sun and bitten by flies until he is compelled to seek a  pool of water, or even a bed of soft mud, in which to roll and make  himself comfortable. He wallows, not so much because he is so fond of  either water or mud, but in self-defense; and when he emerges from his  wallow, plastered with mud from head to tail, his degradation is  complete. He is then simply not fit to be seen, even by his best  friends.    By the first of October, a complete and wonderful transformation has  taken place. The buffalo stands forth clothed in a complete new suit of  hair, fine, clean, sleek, and bright in color, not a speck of dirt nor a  lock awry anywhere. To be sure, it is as yet a trifle short on the body,  where it is not over an inch in length, and hardly that; but it is  growing rapidly and getting ready for winter.    From the 20th of November to the 20th of December the pelage is at its  very finest. By the former date it has attained its full growth, its  colors are at their brightest, and nothing has been lost either by the  elements or by accidental causes. To him who sees an adult bull at this  period, or near it, the grandeur of the animal is irresistibly felt.  After seeing buffaloes of all ages in the spring and summer months the  contrast afforded by those seen in October, November, and December was  most striking and impressive. In the later period, as different  individuals were wounded and brought to bay at close quarters, their  hair was so clean and well-kept, that more than once I was led to  exclaim: \"He looks as if he had just been combed.\"    It must be remarked, however, that the long hair of the head and fore  quarters is disposed in locks or tufts, and to comb it in reality would  utterly destroy its natural and characteristic appearance.    Inasmuch as the pelage of the domesticated bison, the only  representatives of the species which will be found alive ten years  hence, will in all likelihood develop differently from that of the wild  animal, it may some time in the future be of interest to know the  length, by careful measurement, of the hair found on carefully-selected  typical wild specimens. To this end the following measurements are  given. It must be borne in mind that these specimens were not chosen  because their pelage was particularly luxuriant, but rather because they  are fine average specimens.    The hair of the adult bull is by no means as long as I have seen on a  bison, although perhaps not many have greatly surpassed it. It is with  the lower animals as with man--the length of the hairy covering is an  individual character only. I have in my possession a tuft of hair, from  the frontlet of a rather small bull bison, which measures 221/2 inches  in length. The beard on the specimen from which this came was  correspondingly long, and the entire pelage was of wonderful length and  density.    LENGTH OF THE HAIR OF BISON AMERICANUS.

I have met many old buffalo hunters, who had killed  thousands and seen scores of thousands of buffaloes, yet never had seen  a white one. From all accounts it appears that not over ten or eleven  white buffaloes, or white buffalo skins, were ever seen by white men.  Pied individuals were occasionally obtained, but even they were rare.  Albino buffaloes were always so highly prized that not a single one, so  far as I can learn, ever had the good fortune to attain adult size,  their appearance being so striking, in contrast with the other members  of the herd, as to draw upon them an unusual number of enemies, and  cause their speedy destruction.    At the New Orleans Exposition, in 1884-'85, the Territory of Dakota  exhibited, amongst other Western quadrupeds, the mounted skin of a  two-year-old buffalo which might fairly be called an albino. Although  not really white, it was of a uniform dirty cream-color, and showed not  a trace of the bison's normal color on any part of its body.    Lieut. Col. S. C. Kellogg, U. S. Army, has on deposit in the National  Museum a tanned skin which is said to have come from a buffalo. It is  from an animal about one year old, and the hair upon it, which is short,  very curly or wavy, and rather coarse, is pure white. In length and  texture the hair does not in any one respect resemble the hair of a  yearling buffalo save in one particular,--along the median line of the  neck and hump there is a rather long, thin mane of hair, which has the  peculiar woolly appearance of genuine buffalo hair on those parts. On  the shoulder portions of the skin the hair is as short as on the hind  quarters. I am inclined to believe this rather remarkable specimen came  from a wild half-breed calf, the result of a cross between a white  domestic cow and a buffalo bull. At one time it was by no means uncommon  for small bunches of domestic cattle to enter herds of buffalo and  remain there permanently.    I have been informed that the late General Marcy possessed a white  buffalo skin. If it is still in existence, and is really _white_, it is  to be hoped that so great a rarity may find a permanent abiding place in  some museum where the remains of _Bison americanus_ are properly  appreciated.
