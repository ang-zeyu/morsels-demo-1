I think it's what any of us would do. I  shan't give it away, of course, but somehow there are one or two little  things which make me think that Mark really did shoot his brother--I mean  other than accidentally.\"    \"Murdered him?\"    \"Well, manslaughtered him, anyway. I may be wrong. Anyway, it's not my  business.\"    \"But why do you think so? Because of the keys?\"    \"Oh, the keys are a wash-out. Still, it was a brilliant idea of mine,  Wasn't it? And it would have been rather a score for me if they had all  been outside.\"    He had finished his writing, and now passed the paper over to Bill. In  the clear moonlight the carefully printed letters could easily be read:    \"GO ON TALKING AS IF I WERE HERE. AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO, TURN ROUND AS  IF I WERE SITTING ON THE GRASS BEHIND YOU, BUT GO ON TALKING.\"    \"I know you don't agree with me,\" Antony went on as Bill read, \"but  you'll see that I'm right.\"    Bill looked up and nodded eagerly. He had forgotten golf and Betty and  all the other things which had made up his world lately. This was the  real thing. This was life. \"Well,\" he began deliberately, \"the whole  point is that I know Mark. Now, Mark--\"    But Antony was off the seat and letting himself gently down into the  ditch. His intention was to crawl round it until the shed came in sight.  The footsteps which he had heard seemed to be underneath the shed;  probably there was a trap-door of some kind in the floor. Whoever it was  would have heard their voices, and would probably think it worth while  to listen to what they were saying. He might do this merely by opening  the door a little without showing himself, in which case Antony would  have found the entrance to the passage without any trouble to himself.  But when Bill turned his head and talked over the back of the seat, it  was probable that the listener would find it necessary to put his head  outside in order to hear, and then Antony would be able to discover  who it was. Moreover, if he should venture out of his hiding-place  altogether and peep at them over the top of the bank, the fact that Bill  was talking over the back of the seat would mislead the watcher into  thinking that Antony was still there, sitting on the grass, no doubt,  behind the seat, swinging his legs over the side of the ditch.    He walked quickly but very silently along the half-length of the  bowling-green to the first corner, passed cautiously round, and then  went even more carefully along the width of it to the second corner.  He could hear Bill hard at it, arguing from his knowledge of Mark's  character that this, that and the other must have happened, and he  smiled appreciatively to himself. Bill was a great conspirator worth a  hundred Watsons. As he approached the second corner he slowed down, and  did the last few yards on hands and knees. Then, lying at full length,  inch by inch his head went round the corner.    The shed was two or three yards to his left, on the opposite side of  the ditch. From where he lay he could see almost entirely inside it.  Everything seemed to be as they left it. The bowls-box, the lawn-mower,  the roller, the open croquet-box, the--    \"By Jove!\" said Antony to himself, \"that's neat.\"    The lid of the other croquet-box was open, too. Bill was turning round  now; his voice became more difficult to hear. \"You see what I mean,\" he  was saying. \"If Cayley--\"    And out of the second croquet-box came Cayley's black head.    Antony wanted to shout his applause. It was neat, devilish neat. For a  moment he gazed, fascinated, at that wonderful new kind of croquet-ball  which had appeared so dramatically out of the box, and then reluctantly  wriggled himself back. There was nothing to be gained by staying there,  and a good deal to be lost, for Bill showed signs of running down. As  quickly as he could Antony hurried round the ditch and took up his place  at the back of the seat. Then he stood up with a yawn, stretched himself  and said carelessly, \"Well, don't worry yourself about it, Bill, old  man. I daresay you're right. You know Mark, and I don't; and that's the  difference. Shall we have a game or shall we go to bed?\"    Bill looked at him for inspiration, and, receiving it, said, \"Oh, just  let's have one game, shall we?\"    \"Right you are,\" said Antony.    But Bill was much too excited to take the game which followed very  seriously. Antony, on the other hand, seemed to be thinking of nothing  but bowls. He played with great deliberation for ten minutes, and then  announced that he was going to bed. Bill looked at him anxiously.    \"It's all right,\" laughed Antony. \"You can talk if you want to. Just  let's put 'em away first, though.\"    They made their way down to the shed, and while Bill was putting the  bowls away, Antony tried the lid of the closed croquet-box. As he  expected, it was locked.    \"Now then,\" said Bill, as they were walking back to the house again,  \"I'm simply bursting to know. Who was it?\"    \"Cayley.\"    \"Good Lord! Where?\"    \"Inside one of the croquet-boxes.\"    \"Don't be an ass.\"    \"It's quite true, Bill.\" He told the other what he had seen.    \"But aren't we going to have a look at it?\" asked Bill, in great  disappointment. \"I'm longing to explore. Aren't you?\"    \"To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow. We shall see Cayley coming along  this way directly. Besides, I want to get in from the other end, if I  can. I doubt very much if we can do it this end without giving ourselves  away. Look, there's Cayley.\"    They could see him coming along the drive towards them. When they were a  little closer, they waved to him and he waved back.    \"I wondered where you were,\" he said, as he got up to them. \"I rather  thought you might be along this way. What about bed?\"    \"Bed it is,\" said Antony.    \"We've been playing bowls,\" added Bill, \"and talking, and--and playing  bowls. Ripping night, isn't it?\"    But he left the rest of the conversation, as they wandered back to the  house, to Antony. He wanted to think. There seemed to be no doubt now  that Cayley was a villain. Bill had never been familiar with a villain  before. It didn't seem quite fair of Cayley, somehow; he was taking  rather a mean advantage of his friends. Lot of funny people there were  in the world--funny people with secrets. Look at Tony, that first time he  had met him in a tobacconist's shop. Anybody would have thought he was  a tobacconist's assistant. And Cayley. Anybody would have thought that  Cayley was an ordinary decent sort of person. And Mark. Dash it! one  could never be sure of anybody. Now, Robert was different. Everybody had  always said that Robert was a shady fellow.    But what on earth had Miss Norris got to do with it? What had Miss  Norris got to do with it? This was a question which Antony had already  asked himself that afternoon, and it seemed to him now that he had found  the answer. As he lay in bed that night he reassembled his ideas, and  looked at them in the new light which the events of the evening threw  upon the dark corners in his brain.    Of course it was natural that Cayley should want to get rid of his  guests as soon as the tragedy was discovered. He would want this for  their own sake as well as for his. But he had been a little too quick  about suggesting it, and about seeing the suggestion carried out. They  had been bustled off as soon as they could be packed. The suggestion  that they were in his hands, to go or stay as he wished, could have been  left safely to them. As it was, they had been given no alternative,  and Miss Norris, who had proposed to catch an after-dinner train at the  junction, in the obvious hope that she might have in this way a  dramatic cross-examination at the hands of some keen-eyed detective, was  encouraged tactfully, but quite firmly, to travel by the earlier train  with the others. Antony had felt that Cayley, in the tragedy which had  suddenly befallen the house, ought to have been equally indifferent to  her presence or absence. But he was not; and Antony assumed from this  that Cayley was very much alive to the necessity for her absence.    Why?    Well, that question was not to be answered off-hand. But the fact that  it was so had made Antony interested in her; and it was for this reason  that he had followed up so alertly Bill's casual mention of her in  connection with the dressing-up business. He felt that he wanted to know  a little more about Miss Norris and the part she had played in the Red  House circle. By sheer luck, as it seemed to him, he had stumbled on the  answer to his question.    Miss Norris was hurried away because she knew about the secret passage.    The passage, then, had something to do with the mystery of Robert's  death. Miss Norris had used it in order to bring off her dramatic  appearance as the ghost. Possibly she had discovered it for herself;  possibly Mark had revealed it to her secretly one day, never guessing  that she would make so unkind a use of it later on; possibly Cayley,  having been let into the joke of the dressing-up, had shown her how she  could make her appearance on the bowling-green even more mysterious and  supernatural. One way or another, she knew about the secret passage. So  she must be hurried away.    Why? Because if she stayed and talked, she might make some innocent  mention of it. And Cayley did not want any mention of it.    Why, again? Obviously because the passage, or even the mere knowledge of  its existence, might provide a clue.    \"I wonder if Mark's hiding there,\" thought Antony; and he went to sleep.          CHAPTER X. Mr. Gillingham Talks Nonsense      Antony came down in a very good humour to breakfast next morning, and  found that his host was before him. Cayley looked up from his letters  and nodded.    \"Any word of Mr. Ablett--of Mark?\" said Antony, as he poured out"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18721"],[0,"The Victim: A Romance of the Real Jefferson Davis (#14)"],[1,"heap odium and infamy upon us  and make the very name of the South a by-word of hissing and of scorn  throughout the civilized world--\"    He paused overcome with emotion and lifted his hand to stay the burst of  applause from the galleries.    \"We have borne all this for long years and might have borne it many more  under the assurance of our Northern friends that such fanaticism does  not represent the true heart of the Northern people. But the fallacy of  these promises and the folly of our hopes have been too clearly proven  in the late election. The platform of the political party on which you  have swept every Northern State and elected a sectional President is a  foul libel upon our character and a declaration of open war on the lives  and property of the Southern people.    \"In defiance of the Constitution which protects our rights your mob has  decreed the confiscation of three thousand million dollars' worth of our  property. If we claim the protection of our common law, your mob  solemnly burns the Constitution in your public squares and denounces it  as 'an agreement with Death and covenant with Hell.' We appeal to the  Supreme Court of the Republic and when its Judges unanimously sustain  our position on every point, your mob cries:    \"'Down with the Supreme Court of the United States!'    \"You have not only insulted us as unchristian and heathen, you have  proclaimed that four million ignorant negroes but yesterday taken from  the savagery of cannibal Africa are our equals and entitled to share in  the solemn rights of American citizenship. Your declaration is an open  summons that they rise in insurrection with the knife in one hand and  the torch in the other.    \"Your mob has declared the South outlawed, branded with ignominy,  consigned to execration and ultimate destruction. Your mob has decreed  the death of Slavery and sends the new President to execute their  decree.    \"All right--kill Slavery and then what? Kill Slavery and what will you  do with its corpse? Who shall deliver us from the body of this death? We  are not leaving this Hall to fight for the Institution of African  Slavery. The grim specter of a degraded and mongrel citizenship which  lies back of your mob's programme of confiscation is the force that is  driving the Southern people out of the Union to find peace and safety.  Whatever may be the sins of Slavery in the South they are as nothing  when compared to the degradation of your life which must follow their  violent emancipation. The Southern white man is slowly lifting the  African out of barbarism into the light of Christian civilization. In  our own good time we will emancipate him and start him on a new life  beyond the boundaries of our Republic. Whatever may be the differences  of opinion in the South on the institution of slavery--there is no  difference and there has never been on one point--it was true  yesterday--it is true to-day--it will be true to-morrow--_Slavery is the  only modus viviendi by which two such races as the Negro and the Aryan  can live side by side in a free democracy with equality the law of its  life_--\"    Again a burst of tumultuous applause swept the gallery.    \"The issue is clear cut and terrible in its simplicity--the South stands  on the faith of our fathers who created this Republic. The South stands  for Constitutional freedom under the forms of established law. The  North has lifted the red flag of revolution and proclaims the  irresponsible despotism of an enthroned mob!    \"For a generation your school mistresses have been training your boys to  hate us and arming them to fight us. Make no mistake about this movement  to-day. We who go are but the servants of those who sent us. They now  recall their ambassadors, and we obey their sovereign will. Make no  mistake about it. They are not a brave and rash people, deluded by bad  men, who are attempting in an illegal way to wreck the Union. They seek  peace and safety outside driven by the Rebellion against Law and Order  within.    \"Are we more or less than men? Can we love our enemies and bless them  that curse and revile us? Are we devoid of the sensibilities, the  sentiments, the passions, the reason, and the instincts of mankind? Have  we no pride, no honor, no sense of shame, no reverence for our  ancestors, no care for posterity, no love for home, or family or  friends? Must we quail before the onion breath of an enthroned mob,  confess our baseness, discredit the fame of our sires, degrade our  children, abandon our homes, flee from our country and dishonor  ourselves--all for the sake of a Union whose Constitution you have  publicly burned and whose Supreme Court you have spit upon?    \"Shall we consent to live under an administration controlled by those  who not only deny us justice and equality and brand us as infamous, but  boldly proclaim their purpose to rob us of our property and destroy our  civilization?    \"The freemen of Alabama have proclaimed to the world they will not. In  their sovereign power they have recalled me. As their servant I go!\"    With a wave of his hand in an imperious gesture of defiance to the  silent Senators of the North, amid a scene of unparalleled passion, the  speaker turned to his seat, gathered his books and papers and strode  with quick firm step down the aisle.    Jennie had leaped to her feet and stood clapping her hands in a frenzy  of excitement, unconscious of the existence of the strangely quiet young  man by her side.    He rose and stood smiling into her flushed face as she gasped:    \"A wonderful speech--wasn't it?\"    \"They say the South has never lacked audacity, Miss Barton. I'm  wondering if they are really going to make good such words with deeds.\"    He spoke with a cold detachment that chilled and angered the impulsive  girl. A hot answer was on her lips when she remembered suddenly that he  was a foreigner.    \"Of course, Signor, you can not understand our feelings!\"    \"On the other hand, I assure you, I do--I'm just wondering in a cold  intellectual way whether the oratorical temperament--the temperament of  passion, of righteous wrath of the explosive type which we have just  witnessed, will win in the trial by fire which war will bring--\"    \"You doubt our courage?\" she interrupted, with a slight curve of the  proud little lips.    \"Far from it--I assure you! I'm only wondering if it has the sullen,  dogged, staying qualities these stolid Northern men down there have  exhibited while they listened--\"    The girl threw him a quick surprised look and he stopped. His voice had  unconsciously taken the tones of a soliloquy.    \"I beg your pardon, Miss Barton,\" he said, with sudden swing to the  polite tones of society. \"I'm annoying you with my foreign  speculations--\"    A sudden murmur swept the galleries and all eyes were turned on the tall  slender figure of Jefferson Davis as he slowly entered the Senate  Chamber.    \"Who is it?\" Socola asked.    \"Senator Davis--you don't know him?\"    \"I have never seen him before. He has been quite ill I hear.\"    \"Yes. He's been in bed for the past week suffering agonies from  neuralgia. He lost the sight of one of his eyes from chronic pain caused  by exposure in the service of his country in the northwest.\"    \"Really--I didn't know that.\"    \"He was compelled to remain in a darkened room for months the past year  to save the sight of his remaining eye.\"    \"That accounts for my not having seen him before.\"    Socola followed the straight military figure with painful interest as he  slowly moved toward his seat greeting with evident weakness his  colleagues as he passed. He was astonished beyond measure at the  personality of the famous leader of the \"Southern Conspirators\" of whom  he had heard so much. He was the last man in all the crowd he would have  singled out for such a role. The face was too refined, too spiritual,  too purely intellectual for the man of revolution. His high forehead,  straight nose, thin compressed lips and pointed chin belonged to the  poet and dreamer rather than the man of action. The hollow cheek bones  and deeply furrowed mouth told of suffering so acute the sympathy of  every observer was instantly won.    In spite of evident suffering his carriage was erect, dignified, and  graceful. The one trait which fastened the attention from the first and  held it was the remarkable intensity of expression which clothed his  thin muscular face.    \"You like him?\" Jennie ventured at last.    \"I can't say, Miss Barton,\" was the slowly measured answer. \"He is a  remarkably interesting man. I'm surprised and puzzled--\"    \"Surprised and puzzled at what?\"    \"Well, you see I know his history. The diplomatist makes it his business  to know the facts in the lives of the leaders of a nation to whose  Government he is accredited. Mr. Davis spent four years at West Point.  He gave seven years of his life to the service of the army in the West.  He carried your flag to victory in Mexico and hobbled home on crutches.  He was one of your greatest Secretaries of War. He sent George B.  McClellan and Robert E. Lee to the Crimea to master European warfare,  organized and developed your army, changed the model of your arms,  introduced the rifled musket and the minie ball. He explored your  Western Empire and surveyed the lines of the great continental railways  you are going to build to the Pacific Ocean. He planned and built your  system of waterworks in the city of Washington and superintends now the  extension of the Capitol building which will make it the most imposing  public structure in the world. He has never stooped to play the part of  a demagogue. He has never sought an office higher than the role of  Senator which fits his character and temperament. His mind has always  been busy dreaming of the imperial future of your widening Republic. His  eye has seen the vision of its extension to the Arctic on the north and  the jungles of Panama on the south."]]]
