They come to that man or woman who  accepts his life with radiant acquiescence.\"    Radiant acquiescence--that was the quality with which we all suddenly  seemed inspired as 'Abdu'l-Baha bade us good-bye.    It was a remarkable experience, hearing one who had passed along the  prison path for forty years declare \"There is no prison but the prison  self;\" and it drove conviction to one's mind as this white-robed messenger  from the East pointed the way out,--not by the path called \"Renunciation,\"  but \"Unattachment;\" Radiant Acquiescence--the Shining Pathway out of the  \"greater prison of self\" as 'Abdu'l-Baha so beautifully terms those bars  that keep us from our fulfillment.    Isabel Fraser.            A LOVING FAREWELL GREETING.      After leaving London and during his two months stay in Paris, 'Abdu'l-Baha  frequently sent back messages to his English friends, some of whom  journeyed over to take advantage of the conferences there. On the eve of  his departure for Alexandria, he gave the following admonitory farewell to  the people of England and France.    \"Work,\" he said unceasingly, \"for the day of Universal Peace. Strive  always that you may be united. Kindness and love in the path of service  must be your means.    \"I bid a loving farewell to the people of France and England. I am very  much pleased with them. I counsel them that they may day by day strengthen  the bond of love and amity to this end,--that they may become the  sympathetic embodiment of one nation.--That they may extend themselves to a  Universal Brotherhood to guard and protect the interests and rights of all  the nations of the East,--that they may unfurl the Divine Banner of  justice,--that they may treat each nation as a family composed of the  individual children of God and may know that before the sight of God the  rights of all are equal. For all of us are the children of one Father. God  is at peace with all his children; why should they engage in strife and  warfare among themselves? God is showering down kindness; why should the  inhabitants of this world exchange unkindness and cruelty?\"    \"I will pray for you that you may be illumined with the Light of the  Eternal.\"            GREETINGS BY 'ABDU'L-BAHA FROM PARIS TO LONDON.                                    October 1911.      Spoken to Mrs. Enthoven for conveyance to all the friends, and now written  from memory.    'Abdu'l-Baha sent his greetings to all, begging all to go on acquiring  strength in their belief and courage in its proclamation.    He spoke much of the pleasure he had felt in the atmosphere of England. He  said there was a strength of purpose in the English people and a firmness  which he liked and admired, There was honesty and uprightness. They were  slow in starting a new idea, but, when they did, it was only because their  minds and common-sense had told them that the idea was sound.    The English as a nation had pleased him greatly.    Believers, he added, must show their belief in their daily lives, so that  the world might see the light shining in their faces. A bright and happy  face cheers people on their way. If you are sad, and pass a child who is  laughing, the child, seeing your sad face, will cease to laugh, not  knowing why. If the day be dark, how much a gleam of sunshine is prized;  so let believers wear smiling happy faces, gleaming like sunshine in the  darkness. Let the Light of Truth and Honesty shine from them, so that all  who behold them may know that their word in business or pleasure will be a  word to trust and depend upon.    Forget self and work for the whole race. Remember always that one is  working for the world, not for a town or even for a country; because, as  all are brethren, so every country is, as it were, one's own.    Remember, above all, the teaching of Baha'u'llah concerning gossip and  unseemly talk about others. Stories repeated about others are seldom good.  A silent tongue is the safest. Even good may be harmful, if spoken at the  wrong time, or to the wrong person.    Finally 'Abdu'l-Baha sent his greetings and blessings to all, and assured  me he was constantly thinking and praying for all.    To a gentleman who was questioning him, he remarked \"The beginnings of all  great religions were pure; but priests, taking possession of the minds of  the people, filled them with dogmas and superstitions, so that religion  became gradually corrupt. I come to teach no new religion. 'My only desire  is, through the blessing of God, to show the road to the Great Light.\"  Touching the gentleman gently on his shoulder, as a loving father might  touch a son, he went on to say, \"I am no Prophet, only a man like  yourself.\"            MESSAGE TO THE LONDON BAHA'IS FOR THE DAY OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA.

(Letter No. 1)      Margaret Stevenson, the first New Zealand Baha'i was born on November  30th, 1865. Her first intimation of the Baha'i Faith was through reading  \"The Christian Commonwealth\" and she admitted later that \"she did not  think any more about it\". She received this journal from her sister who  was in London studying music and had heard 'Abdu'l-Baha address the  congregation of St. John's, Westminster at the invitation of Canon  Wilberforce. She was so impressed that when another discourse given by  'Abdu'l-Baha at City Temple, London was printed in \"The Christian  Commonwealth\" dated March 27th, 1911, she sent a copy of the journal to  Margaret in New Zealand. In 1912, Miss Dorothea Spinney arrived in  Auckland from London and stayed with Margaret at her home, \"Clunie\", 3,  Cowie Street, Parnell where she talked about the Baha'i Cause and her own  meeting with 'Abdu'l-Baha. To quote Margaret's own words: \"As a child, I  used to wish I had lived when Christ was on earth. As Miss Spinney spoke,  I remembered my childhood wish, and the thought came to me that I too  might have denied Him as so many others had done. It was this secret  thought that made me seriously think of what I heard from Miss Spinney,  and through God's grace and mercy I was enabled to grasp and believe in  Baha'u'llah and His Message\".(10) Margaret spoke to others of her belief  and obtained literature from America, becoming a subscriber to \"Star of  the West\". Eventually a study group was formed in Auckland and for ten  years, Margaret's home was a venue for these classes. It was here that the  first Baha'i Feast in New Zealand took place in January, 1923.    In 1925, Margaret was one of a small group who journeyed from New Zealand  to the Holy Land on pilgrimage, and after an inspiring nineteen days in  Haifa, travelled on to England where she met with the English Baha'i  community. The pilgrims arrived back in Auckland in December, 1925,  bringing with them some dust from the Tomb of Baha'u'llah which was placed  in New Zealand soil at the Stevenson's home in a ceremony held on February  14th, 1926.    In such a geographically remote country, the early New Zealand believers  had scant knowledge of Baha'i administration and erroneously called  themselves an Assembly as early as 1924. This was corrected with the  receipt of a booklet on the subject and the first properly constituted  Baha'i Assembly in New Zealand was formed on April 21st, 1926, with  Margaret Stevenson as its Secretary. A steadfast worker, Margaret was a  member of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of  Australia and New Zealand which was elected in 1934, and served the Baha'i  Cause with faithfulness and efficiency until her passing to the Abha  Kingdom on February 11th, 1941.          Note 2. (Letter No. 1)      Born in London in 1855, Hyde Dunn was engaged in business in Britain and  continental Europe before emigrating to the United States. In 1905, whilst  at a tinsmith's shop in Seattle, he observed the shopkeeper in excited  conversation with a man who had just returned from the Prison of Akka and  the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha; he overheard the quotation \"Let not a man  glory in this, that he loves his country, but let him glory in this, that  he loves his kind\". Hyde Dunn later recalled that \"The words reached me  with dynamic force, its truth and power crystallised in my heart--a new  consciousness awakened... That one glorious utterance magnetised my whole  being, appealed as a new note, sent forth from God to His wandering  creatures--a Message from the Supreme to the sons of men\".(11) Recognising  the Truth, Hyde Dunn interrupted the conversation, and accepted  immediately the Revelation of Baha'u'llah. The year was 1905.    In 1912, he was present at a meeting with 'Abdu'l-Baha in San Francisco  and declared it was the Master's \"penetrating glance, his life giving  words, he felt gave him the power that enabled him later to become the  spiritual conqueror of a continent\". Accompanied by his English born wife,  Clara, he answered the call of the \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\" and on  April 18th, 1920 reached Australia whence they travelled to New Zealand in  1922-3, not knowing there was already a believer there (Margaret  Stevenson). With their arrival in Auckland, the Cause grew in that country  and when Hyde Dunn left to return to Australia, Clara remained for a time  to organise a study group in New Zealand.    Known affectionately among Baha'is as \"Mother\" and \"Father\" Dunn, they  carried the Message of Baha'u'llah from New South Wales to Victoria, South  Australia, Tasmania, across the desert to Perth and to tropical Queensland  and became the spiritual parents of Australia. After \"Mother\" Dunn  returned from a lone pilgrimage to the Holy Land, \"Father\" was elected a  member of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of  Australia and New Zealand in 1934. After his passing on February 17th,  1941, \"Mother\" Dunn's dedication to the Baha'i Faith continued unabated  and in 1952 she was elevated to the station of Hand of the Cause of God by  Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith: \"Father\" Dunn was  subsequently elevated to the same station posthumously.    Despite her advanced years, \"Mother\" Dunn returned to New Zealand in 1957  as representative of the Guardian at the formation of the first National  Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of New Zealand. In March, 1958, at the  request of the Guardian, she placed plaster from the Castle of Mah-Ku in  the foundations of the Australasian Baha'i House of Worship in Sydney  during the Australian Inter-Continental Conference. Until her passing to  the Abha Kingdom in 1960 at the age of 91 years, \"Mother\" Dunn retained  her memory of many Baha'i prayers and was reciting these at the time of  her death.          Note 3. (Letter No. 2)      The Blundell family: Mrs Sarah Blundell was born at Burwell,  Cambridgeshire, England in 1850, a year sacred in Baha'i history as that  of the Bab's martyrdom, and was destined to become one of the pioneers of  the Baha'i Cause in New Zealand. She received her early religious training  from her \"Non-Conformist\" father, a man whose strong convictions led him  to withdraw his seven year old daughter from religious instruction classes  at her boarding school. The feeling of isolation which followed caused her  to think for herself and she had the rare distinction of being one of the  first women to enter the Cambridge University Examinations in an age  prejudiced against the education of women.    In 1886, with her husband and seven children, she arrived in New Zealand  where she endured hardship and difficulties in a strange country. She  persisted in her unfettered search for truth and rejected several dogmas  until, with an open mind and a prepared heart, she read in \"The Christian  Commonwealth\" of 'Abdu'l-Baha's visit to London in 1911 and sent overseas  for additional literature. When Mr and Mrs Dunn arrived in Auckland in  1922-3, Mrs Blundell invited them to her home, \"Lymbury\", Ridings Road,  Remuera to meet a group of twenty people whom she thought might be  interested. This was the first Baha'i meeting held in New Zealand and  shortly afterwards Mrs Blundell accepted the Baha'i Faith.    On hearing from Martha Root that Shoghi Effendi and the Ladies of the  Household were eager to welcome the New Zealand friends, Sarah Blundell  arranged to make the journey to the Holy Land in 1925 visit the Holy  Family, and the Shrines of the Bab, Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha, and to  meet in person many other Baha'is--this was \"a crowning gift to one whose  spiritual path had been travelled alone.\"(12) She returned to New Zealand  after first going home to England to see her relatives and, at the  Guardian's suggestion, make personal contact with the English Baha'i  community. She continued to work unsparingly in New Zealand to serve the  Cause of Baha'u'llah until her passing at the age of eighty-four years on  December 20th, 1934.    One of her daughters, Ethel Blundell who accepted the Baha'i Faith in  1925, was a delegate to the first Baha'i Convention and was elected as a  member of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of  Australia and New Zealand in May, 1934.    Mrs Blundell's son, Hugh, was also destined to serve the Baha'i Cause.  Although not at that time a Baha'i, Hugh accompanied his mother and sister  on their pilgrimage to Haifa in 1925 and accepted the Faith the following  year. A tireless worker for the Cause, he was New Zealand's first  Auxiliary Board Member and passed to the Abha Kingdom on October 16th,  1976 in his ninety-second year.          Note 4. (Letter No. 2)      Effie Baker became disenchanted with the Church and, having an open and  enquiring attitude, was one of a committee formed in Melbourne responsible  for arranging speakers to address the \"New Thought\" organisation. This led  her to attend a public meeting at which Hyde Dunn spoke on the Baha'i  Faith and, recognising the truth of the Message, Effie Baker accepted the  Faith the same evening and so became the first woman believer in  Australia. She accompanied Martha Root on the latter's lecture tour of New  Zealand and, learning of the New Zealand Baha'is projected journey to the  Holy Land in 1925, Effie sold her home and joined the pilgrims.    After the bounty of visiting the Shrines and meeting with the Guardian and  the Greatest Holy Leaf, Effie acceded to Shoghi Effendi's request and  accompanied the New Zealand friends to London so as to contact the British  Baha'i community. She planned to return to Australia and assist the Dunns,  and had accepted an invitation from the Ladies of the Holy Family to stop  over in Haifa on her homeward journey, but on arriving there in June, she  found Shoghi Effendi was away from the Holy Land and so decided to wait"]]]
