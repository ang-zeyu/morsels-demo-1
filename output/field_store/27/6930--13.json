With the last year's brand        Light the new block, and      For good success in his spending,        On your psalteries play,        That sweet luck may      Come while the log is a-teending.          Drink now the strong beer,        Cut the white loaf here,      The while the meat is a-shredding;        For the rare mince-pie,        And the plums stand by,      To fill the paste that's a kneading.           *       *       *       *       *        SANTA CLAUS        ANON        He comes in the night! He comes in the night!        He softly, silently comes;      While the little brown heads on the pillows so white        Are dreaming of bugles and drums.      He cuts through the snow like a ship through the foam,        While the white flakes around him whirl;      Who tells him I know not, but he findeth the home        Of each good little boy and girl.        His sleigh it is long, and deep, and wide;        It will carry a host of things,      While dozens of drums hang over the side,        With the sticks sticking under the strings:      And yet not the sound of a drum is heard,        Not a bugle blast is blown,      As he mounts to the chimney-top like a bird,        And drops to the hearth like a stone.        The little red stockings he silently fills,        Till the stockings will hold no more;      The bright little sleds for the great snow hills       Are quickly set down on the floor.      Then Santa Claus mounts to the roof like a bird,        And glides to his seat in the sleigh;      Not the sound of a bugle or drum is heard        As he noiselessly gallops away.        He rides to the East, and he rides to the West,        Of his goodies he touches not one;      He eateth the crumbs of the Christmas feast        When the dear little folks are done.      Old Santa Claus doeth all that he can;        This beautiful mission is his;      Then, children, be good to the little old man,        When you find who the little man is.           *       *       *       *       *        THE CEREMONIES FOR CHRISTMAS DAY        ROBERT HERRICK        Kindle the Christmas brand, and then        Till sunset let it burn;      Which quench'd, then lay it up again        Till Christmas next return.

NICHOLAS    MARY MAPES DODGE    We all know how, before the Christmas-tree began to flourish in the  home-life of our country, a certain \"right jolly old elf,\" with \"eight  tiny reindeer,\" used to drive his sleigh-load of toys up to our  housetops, and then bound down the chimney to fill the stockings so  hopefully hung by the fireplace. His friends called him Santa Claus; and  those who were most intimate ventured to say, \"Old Nick.\" It was said  that he originally came from Holland. Doubtless he did; but, if so, he  certainly, like many other foreigners, changed his ways very much after  landing upon our shores. In Holland, St. Nicholas is a veritable saint,  and often appears in full costume, with his embroidered robes glittering  with gems and gold, his mitre, his crosier, and his jewelled gloves.  _Here_ Santa Claus comes rollicking along on the 25th of December, our  Holy Christmas morn; but in Holland, St. Nicholas visits earth on the  5th, a time especially appropriated to him. Early on the morning of the  6th, which is St. Nicholas Day, he distributes his candies, toys and  treasures, and then vanishes for a year.    Christmas Day is devoted by the Hollanders to church-rites and pleasant  family visiting. It is on St. Nicholas Eve that their young people  become half wild with joy and expectation. To some of them it is a sorry  time; for the saint is very candid, and, if any of them have been bad  during the past year, he is quite sure to tell them so. Sometimes he  carries a birch-rod under his arm, and advises the parents to give them  scoldings in place of confections, and floggings instead of joys.    It was well that the boys hastened to their abodes on that bright winter  evening; for, in less than an hour afterwards, the saint made his  appearance in half the homes of Holland. He visited the king's palace,  and in the self-same moment appeared in Annie Bouman's comfortable home.  Probably one of our silver half-dollars would have purchased all that  his saintship left at the peasant Bouman's. But a half-dollar's worth  will sometimes do for the poor what hundreds of dollars may fail to do  for the rich: it makes them happy and grateful, fills them with new  peace and love.    Hilda van Gleck's little brothers and sisters were in a high state of  excitement that night. They had been admitted into the grand parlor:  they were dressed in their best, and had been given two cakes apiece at  supper. Hilda was as joyous as any. Why not? St. Nicholas would never  cross a girl of fourteen from his list, just because she was tall and  looked almost like a woman. On the contrary, he would probably exert  himself to do honor to such an august-looking damsel. Who could tell? So  she sported and laughed and danced as gayly as the youngest, and was the  soul of all their merry games. Father, mother and grandmother looked on  approvingly; so did grandfather, before he spread his large red  handkerchief over his face, leaving only the top of his skull-cap  visible. This kerchief was his ensign of sleep.    Earlier in the evening, all had joined in the fun. In the general  hilarity, there had seemed to be a difference only in bulk between  grandfather and the baby. Indeed, a shade of solemn expectation, now and  then flitting across the faces of the younger members, had made them  seem rather more thoughtful than their elders.    Now the spirit of fun reigned supreme. The very flames danced and  capered in the polished grate. A pair of prim candles, that had been  staring at the astral lamp, began to wink at other candles far away in  the mirrors. There was a long bell-rope suspended from the ceiling in  the corner, made of glass beads, netted over a cord nearly as thick as  your wrist. It generally hung in the shadow, and made no sign; but  to-night it twinkled from end to end. Its handle of crimson glass sent  reckless dashes of red at the papered wall, turning its dainty blue  stripes into purple. Passers-by halted to catch the merry laughter  floating through curtain and sash into the street, then skipped on their  way with the startled consciousness that the village was wide awake. At  last matters grew so uproarious that the grandsire's red kerchief came  down from his face with a jerk. What decent old gentleman could sleep in  such a racket! Mynheer van Gleck regarded his children with  astonishment. The baby even showed symptoms of hysterics. It was high  time to attend to business. Mevrouw suggested that, if they wished to  see the good St. Nicholas, they should sing the same loving invitation  that had brought him the year before.    The baby stared, and thrust his fist into his mouth, as Mynheer put him  down upon the floor. Soon he sat erect, and looked with a sweet scowl at  the company. With his lace and embroideries, and his crown of blue  ribbon and whalebone (for he was not quite past the tumbling age), he  looked like the king of babies.    The other children, each holding a pretty willow basket, formed at once  in a ring, and moved slowly around the little fellow, lifting their eyes  meanwhile; for the saint to whom they were about to address themselves  was yet in mysterious quarters.    Mevrouw commenced playing softly upon the piano; soon the voices  rose,--gentle, youthful voices, rendered all the sweeter for their  tremor,--        \"Welcome, friend! St. Nicholas, welcome!        Bring no rod for us to-night!      While our voices bid thee welcome,        Every heart with joy is light.            \"Tell us every fault and failing;          We will bear thy keenest railing          So we sing, so we sing:          Thou shalt tell us everything!        \"Welcome, friend! St. Nicholas, welcome!        Welcome to this merry band!      Happy children greet thee, welcome!        Thou art gladdening all the land.            \"Fill each empty hand and basket;          'T is thy little ones who ask it.          So we sing, so we sing:          Thou wilt bring us everything!\"    During the chorus, sundry glances, half in eagerness, half in dread, had  been cast towards the polished folding-doors. Now a loud knocking was  heard. The circle was broken in an instant. Some of the little ones,  with a strange mixture of fear and delight, pressed against their  mother's knee. Grandfather bent forward, with his chin resting upon his  hand; grandmother lifted her spectacles; Mynheer van Gleck, seated by  the fireplace, slowly drew his meerschaum from his mouth; while Hilda  and the other children settled themselves beside him in an expectant  group."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18909"],[0,"Poems Teachers Ask For (#14)"],[1,"theirs and blaming it on you;  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,    But make allowance for their doubting too;  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,    Or being lied about don't deal in lies,  Or being hated don't give way to hating,    And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;    If you can dream and not make dreams your master;    If you can think and not make thoughts your aim;  If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster    And treat those two impostors just the same;  If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,  Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,    And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools;    If you can make one heap of all your winnings    And risk it on one turn of pitch and toss.

They hate  To have the other people eat while boys must wait and wait,  But I've about made up my mind I'm different from the rest,  For as for me, I b'lieve I like the second table best.    To eat along with comp'ny is so trying, for it's tough  To sit and watch the victuals when you dassent touch the stuff.  You see your father serving out the dark meat and the light  Until a boy is sure he'll starve before he gets a bite.    And when, he asks you what you'll have,--you've heard it all before,--  You know you'll get just what you get and won't get nothing more;  For, when you want another piece, your mother winks her eye,  And so you say, \"I've plenty, thanks!\" and tell a whopping lie.    When comp'ny is a-watching you, you've got to be polite,  And eat your victuals with a fork and take a little bite.  You can't have nothing till you're asked and, 'cause a boy is small,  Folks think he isn't hungry, and he's never asked at all.    Since I can first remember I've been told that when the cake  Is passed around, the proper thing is for a boy to take  The piece that's nearest to him, and so all I ever got,  When comp'ny's been to our house, was the smallest in the lot.    It worries boys like everything to have the comp'ny stay  A-setting round the table, like they couldn't get away.  But when they've gone, and left the whole big shooting match to me,  Say! ain't it fun to just wade in and help myself? Oh, gee!    With no one round to notice what you're doing--bet your life!--  Boys don't use forks to eat with when they'd rather use a knife,  Nor take such little bites as when they're eating with the rest  And so, for lots of things, I like the second table best        _Nixon Waterman._          The Children      When the lessons and tasks are all ended,    And the school for the day is dismissed,  And the little ones gather around me,    To bid me good night and be kissed;  Oh, the little white arms that encircle    My neck in their tender embrace!  Oh, the smiles that are halos of heaven,    Shedding sunshine of love on my face!    And when they are gone, I sit dreaming    Of my childhood, too lovely to last;  Of love that my heart will remember    When it wakes to the pulse of the past,  Ere the world and its wickedness made me    A partner of sorrow and sin,--  When the glory of God was about me,    And the glory of gladness within.    All my heart grows weak as a woman's    And the fountains of feeling will flow,  When I think of the paths steep and stony,    Where the feet of the dear ones must go;  Of the mountains of sin hanging o'er them,    Of the tempest of Fate blowing wild;  Oh, there's nothing on earth half so holy    As the innocent heart of a child!    They are idols of hearts and of households;    They are angels of God in disguise;  His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,    His glory still gleams in their eyes;  Oh, these truants from home and from heaven,--    They have made me more manly and mild;  And I know now how Jesus could liken    The kingdom of God to a child!    I ask not a life for the dear ones    All radiant, as others have done,  But that life may have just enough shadow    To temper the glare of the sun;  I would pray God to guard them from evil,    But my prayer would bound back to myself;  Ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner,    But a sinner must pray for himself.    The twig is so easily bended,    I have banished the rule and the rod;  I have taught them the goodness of knowledge,    They have taught me the goodness of God.  My heart is the dungeon of darkness,    Where I shut them for breaking a rule;  My frown is sufficient correction;    My love is the law of the school.    I shall leave the old house in the autumn,    To traverse its threshold no more;  Ah! how shall I sigh for the dear ones    That meet me each morn at the door!  I shall miss the \"good nights\" and the kisses,    And the gush of their innocent glee.  The group on its green, and the flowers    That are brought every morning to me.    I shall miss them at morn and at even,    Their song in the school and the street;  I shall miss the low hum of their voices,    And the tread of their delicate feet.  When the lessons of life are all ended,    And death says, \"The school is dismissed!\"  May the little ones gather around me    To bid me good night and be kissed!        _Charles M. Dickinson._          A Visit from St. Nicholas      'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house  Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;  The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,  In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;  The children were nestled all snug in their beds,  While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;  And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,  Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,--  When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,  I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.  Away to the window I flew like a flash,  Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.  The moon, on the breast of the new-fallen snow,  Gave a luster of midday to objects below:  When what to my wondering eyes should appear,  But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,  With a little old driver, so lively and quick,  I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.  More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,  And he whistled and shouted, and called them by name:  \"Now, Dasher! now Dancer! now, Prancer! now Vixen!  On, Comet, on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!--  To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall!  Now, dash away, dash sway, dash away all!\"  As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,  When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,  So, up to the house-top the coursers they flew,  With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too,  And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof  The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.  As I drew in my head, and was turning around,  Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.  He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,  And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;  A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,  And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.  His eyes how they twinkled; his dimples how merry!  His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,  And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.  The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,  And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.  He had a broad face and a little round belly  That shook, when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.  He was chubby and plump--a right jolly old elf--  And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.  A wink of his eye, and a twist of his head,  Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.  He spake not a word, but went straight to his work,  And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,  And laying his finger aside of his nose  And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.  He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,  And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;  But I heard him exclaim, ere they drove out of sight,  \"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!\"        _Clement C. Moore._          Your Mission      If you cannot on the ocean    Sail among the swiftest fleet,  Rocking on the highest billows,    Laughing at the storms you meet,  You can stand among the sailors,    Anchored yet within the bay,  You can lend a hand to help them,    As they launch their boats away.    If you are too weak to journey    Up the mountain steep and high,  You can stand within the valley,    While the multitudes go by;  You can chant in happy measure,    As they slowly pass along;  Though they may forget the singer,    They will not forget the song.    If you have not gold and silver    Ever ready to command,  If you cannot towards the needy    Reach an ever-open hand,  You can visit the afflicted,    O'er the erring you can weep,  You can be a true disciple,    Sitting at the Savior's feet.    If you cannot in the conflict,    Prove yourself a soldier true,  If where fire and smoke are thickest,    There's no work for you to do,  When the battle-field is silent,    You can go with careful tread,  You can bear away the wounded,    You can cover up the dead.    Do not then stand idly waiting    For some greater work to do,  Fortune is a lazy goddess,    She will "]]]
