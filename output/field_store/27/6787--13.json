He believed  that there were evil spirits all about the world. Doubtless he imagined  that they were hidden in the corners and crevices of his library, and that  they peeped out from among the leaves of many of his books, as he turned  them over, at midnight. He supposed that these unlovely demons were  everywhere, in the sunshine as well as in the darkness, and that they were  hidden in men's hearts, and stole into their most secret thoughts.\"    Here Grandfather was interrupted by little Alice, who hid her face in his  lap, and murmured a wish that he would not talk any more about Cotton  Mather and the evil spirits. Grandfather kissed her, and told her that  angels were the only spirits whom she had any thing to do with. He then  spoke of the public affairs of the period.    A new war between France and England had broken out in 1702, and had been  raging ever since. In the course of it, New England suffered much injury  from the French and Indians, who often came through the woods from Canada,  and assaulted the frontier towns. Villages were sometimes burnt, and the  inhabitants slaughtered, within a day's ride of Boston. The people of New  England had a bitter hatred against the French, not only for the mischief  which they did with their own hands, but because they incited the Indians  to hostility.    The New Englanders knew that they could never dwell in security, until the  provinces of France should be subdued, and brought under the English  government. They frequently, in time of war, undertook military  expeditions against Acadia and Canada, and sometimes besieged the  fortresses, by which those territories were defended. But the most earnest  wish of their hearts was, to take Quebec, and so get possession of the  whole province of Canada. Sir William Phips had once attempted it, but  without success.    Fleets and soldiers were often sent from England, to assist the colonists  in their warlike undertakings. In 1710, Port Royal, a fortress of Acadia,  was taken by the English. The next year, in the month of June, a fleet,  commanded by Admiral Sir Hovenden Walker, arrived in Boston Harbor. On  board of this fleet was the English General Hill, with seven regiments of  soldiers, who had been fighting under the Duke of Marlborough, in  Flanders. The government of Massachusetts was called upon to find  provisions for the army and fleet, and to raise more men to assist in  taking Canada.    What with recruiting and drilling of soldiers, there was now nothing but  warlike bustle in the streets of Boston. The drum and fife, the rattle of  arms, and the shouts of boys, were heard from morning till night. In about  a month, the fleet set sail, carrying four regiments from New England and  New York, besides the English soldiers. The whole army amounted to at  least seven thousand men. They steered for the mouth of the river St.  Lawrence.    \"Cotton Mather prayed most fervently for their success,\" continued  Grandfather, \"both in his pulpit, and when he kneeled down in the solitude  of his library, resting his face on our old chair. But Providence ordered  the result otherwise. In a few weeks, tidings were received, that eight or  nine of the vessels had been wrecked in the St. Lawrence, and that above a  thousand drowned soldiers had been washed ashore, on the banks of that  mighty river. After this misfortune, Sir Hovenden Walker set sail for  England; and many pious people began to think it a sin, even to wish for  the conquest of Canada.\"    \"I would never give it up so,\" cried Charley.    \"Nor did they, as we shall see,\" replied Grandfather. \"However, no more  attempts were made during this war, which came to a close in 1713. The  people of New England were probably glad of some repose; for their young  men had been made soldiers, till many of them were fit for nothing else.  And those, who remained at home, had been heavily taxed to pay for the  arms, ammunition, fortifications, and all the other endless expenses of a  war. There was great need of the prayers of Cotton Mather, and of all  pious men, not only on account of the sufferings of the people, but  because the old moral and religious character of New England was in danger  of being utterly lost.\"    \"How glorious it would have been,\" remarked Laurence, \"if our forefathers  could have kept the country unspotted with blood.\"    \"Yes,\" said Grandfather; \"but there was a stern warlike spirit in them,  from the beginning. They seem never to have thought of questioning either  the morality or piety of war.\"    The next event, which Grandfather spoke of, was one that Cotton Mather, as  well as most of the other inhabitants of New England, heartily rejoiced  at. This was the accession of the Elector of Hanover to the throne of  England, in 1714, on the death of Queen Anne. Hitherto, the people had  been in continual dread that the male line of the Stuarts, who were  descended from the beheaded King Charles and the banished King James,  would be restored to the throne. In that case, as the Stuart family were  Roman Catholics, it was supposed that they would attempt to establish  their own religion throughout the British dominions. But the Elector of  Hanover, and all his race, were Protestants; so that now the descendants  of the old Puritans were relieved from many fears and disquietudes.    \"The importance of this event,\" observed Grandfather, \"was a thousand  times greater than that of a Presidential Election, in our own days. If  the people dislike their president, they may get rid of him in four years;  whereas, a dynasty of kings may wear the crown for an unlimited period.\"    The German elector was proclaimed king from the balcony of the town-house,  in Boston, by the title of George the First, while the trumpets sounded,  and the people cried Amen. That night, the town was illuminated; and  Cotton Mather threw aside book and pen, and left Grandfather's chair  vacant, while he walked hither and thither to witness the rejoicings.          Chapter VI      \"Cotton Mather,\" continued Grandfather, \"was a bitter enemy to Governor  Dudley; and nobody exulted more than he, when that crafty politician was  removed from the government, and succeeded by Colonel Shute. This took  place in 1716. The new governor had been an officer in the renowned Duke  of Marlborough's army, and had fought in some of the great battles in  Flanders.\"    \"Now, I hope,\" said Charley, \"we shall hear of his doing great things.\"    \"I am afraid you will be disappointed, Charley,\" answered Grandfather. \"It  is true, that Colonel Shute had probably never led so unquiet a life while  fighting the French, as he did now, while governing this province of  Massachusetts Bay. But his troubles consisted almost entirely of  dissensions with the legislature. The king had ordered him to lay claim to  a fixed salary; but the representatives of the people insisted upon paying  him only such sums, from year to year, as they saw fit.\"    Grandfather here explained some of the circumstances, that made the  situation of a colonial governor so difficult and irksome. There was not  the same feeling towards the chief magistrate, now, that had existed,  while he was chosen by the free suffrages of the people. It was felt,  that, as the king appointed the governor, and as he held his office during  the king's pleasure, it would be his great object to please the king. But  the people thought, that a governor ought to have nothing in view, but the  best interests of those whom he governed.    \"The governor,\" remarked Grandfather, \"had two masters to serve--the king,  who appointed him, and the people, on whom he depended for his pay. Few  men, in this position, would have ingenuity enough to satisfy either  party. Colonel Shute, though a good-natured, well-meaning man, succeeded  so ill with the people, that in 1722, he suddenly went away to England,  and made complaint to King George. In the mean time, Lieutenant-Governor  Dummer directed the affairs of the province, and carried on a long and  bloody war with the Indians.\"    \"But where was our chair, all this time?\" asked Clara.    \"It still remained in Cotton Mather's library,\" replied Grandfather; \"and  I must not omit to tell you an incident, which is very much to the honor  of this celebrated man. It is the more proper, too, that you should hear  it, because it will show you what a terrible calamity the small pox was to  our forefathers. The history of the province, (and, of course, the history  of our chair,) would be incomplete, without particular mention of it.\"  Accordingly, Grandfather told the children a story, to which, for want of  a better title, we shall give that of        THE REJECTED BLESSING      One day, in 1721, Doctor Cotton Mather sat in his library, reading a book  that had been published by the Royal Society of London. But, every few  moments, he laid the book upon the table, and leaned back in Grandfather's  chair, with an aspect of deep care and disquietude. There were certain  things which troubled him exceedingly, so that he could hardly fix his  thoughts upon what he read.    It was now a gloomy time in Boston. That terrible disease, the small pox,  had recently made its appearance in the town. Ever since the first  settlement of the country, this awful pestilence had come, at intervals,  and swept away multitudes of the inhabitants. Whenever it commenced its  ravages, nothing seemed to stay its progress, until there were no more  victims for it to seize upon. Oftentimes, hundreds of people, at once, lay  groaning with its agony; and when it departed, its deep footsteps were  always to be traced in many graves.    The people never felt "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15699"],[0,"A Handbook of the Boer War (#14)"],[1,"after midnight, however, Gatacre's suspicions were aroused by the  sudden appearance of a railway which ought not to have been there, and  it was discovered that the guides had a mile or two back missed a path  on which the column should have diverged to the right. They assured him,  however, that they had chosen a better road and that he was now less  than 3,000 yards from the Boer position. He therefore halted the column  for an hour's rest, and hoped for the best.    When the march was resumed another railway was almost immediately  encountered. It was in fact the colliery line which had been crossed  before the halt and which here curves almost to the extent of a  semicircle; but Gatacre believed that he had come upon the main line to  Steynsburg and judged that he was now N.W. of the Boer position; while  many of the officers in the rear of the column, unaware of the change of  plan, imagined that they were approaching it from the S.E. along the  Stormberg road originally selected for the advance on which the  ambulance and ammunition wagons had already gone astray.    The direction of the march was now almost reversed, owing to Gatacre's  misapprehension of his position; and at dawn the column unknown to  itself reached certain cross roads on Van Zyl's farm which had been  fixed upon as the point from which the attack should be delivered; but  the locality was not recognized by the staff, and the guides, who seem  to have misunderstood the object of the march, conducted the column  still deeper into the valley beneath the Kissieberg ridge.    Suddenly a shot from the heights startled the errant and plodding  column. The Boers had indeed been taken by surprise, but were at once on  the alert and the crest line was soon occupied. The column marching in  fours halted and turned to the right and, except the leading companies  of Irish Rifles, which were formed to the front in order to seize a  detached hill at the end of the ridge, sprang up the slope, but were  soon baffled by the irregular tiers of krantzes or rock walls on the  hill side. The artillery diverged to the left, losing one gun in the  donga which ran down the valley, and took post on the detached hill from  which the Kissieberg ridge could be shelled. The companies of Irish  Rifles, after seizing this hill, passed along the nek which joined it to  the ridge and almost won the crest line.    Meanwhile the Northumberland Fusiliers and the remaining companies of  the Irish Rifles found the task of mounting the encumbered slope beyond  their powers, and were soon ordered to fall back into the valley. The  artillery noticed the movement, and in order to cover the retreat opened  upon Kissieberg; not perceiving in the eastern dazzle of the sun about  to rise above the sky line that some of the infantry who had not heard  the order to retire were still clinging to the darkened westward  hillside, and these were shelled by their own guns.    Gatacre, confident of an easy success, had thrown all his infantry into  the firing line, and had no reserves to fall back upon to support the  companies of the Irish Rifles which were still holding their own on the  left flank of the attack. As soon as the troops had crossed the valley  to reform on the opposite ridge a new entanglement beset them.    A commando under E.R. Grobler and Steenkamp, chiefly composed of rebels,  which had been sent by Olivier on the previous day to stir up trouble in  the district, was halted for the night a few miles out on the Steynsburg  road. The sound of the firing quickly called it to attention, and a  position which seriously threatened Gatacre's line of retreat was  quickly seized. The commando, however, was handled with little judgment  or energy, and was soon checked by the field guns which had been  withdrawn from the detached hill near the Kissieberg ridge to cover the  retreat of the infantry; and which at one time were firing trail to  trail, some still engaging Olivier on Kissieberg while others were  shelling Grobler.    The raid on Stormberg had manifestly failed and Gatacre ordered a  retreat to Molteno. Thither the weary, dispirited column trudged all  through the forenoon of December 10. A gun was abandoned on the way, and  even the wagon in which the breech block had been secreted fell also  into the enemy's hands. But this was a comparatively insignificant loss.  It was soon discovered that nearly a third of the infantry was absent.  When the troops were withdrawn from the attack on Kissieberg not a few  of them remained in the donga or under the krantzes on the hill side,  while others appear to have held on to the ridge. By some extraordinary  neglect or default nearly 600 men were left to their fate. No one seems  to have missed them at the time and they were made prisoners of war  without an effort to extricate them.    In less than two hours all the fighting except the little affair with  Grobler was over. On neither side were the casualties of killed and  wounded heavy. No British officer was killed and of the eight who were  wounded four had been struck by shells not fired by the enemy.           *       *       *       *       *    Stonmberg on December 10, followed by Magersfontein on December 13,  brought about Colenso on December 15. The latter was Buller's attempt to  retrieve the former mishaps.    A naturally strong position on the left bank of the Tugela had by the  efforts of the Boers during the previous three weeks been almost  perfectly secured. They showed, however, some hesitation with regard to  Hlangwhane, a detached hill on the right bank from which the Tugela line  could be enfiladed. It was a somewhat precarious position as it was  accessible from the left bank only by two bridle drifts. It had been  originally held by the Boers, but the garrison was withdrawn when  Barton's Brigade appeared at Chieveley; and now all Botha's persistence,  and even a reference to Kruger and Joubert at Pretoria, were required to  induce the burghers to re-occupy it on December 15. From the south  Hlangwhane, though separated from the Colenso kopjes by the river,  appears to be an integral continuation of them.    [Illustration: Colenso Battlefield.]    The enemy's general idea was a defensive occupation of the Colenso  position, although Botha, with characteristic spirit, proposed to send a  commando across the river to face the British on the open. The  initiative, always a disadvantage when attacking an enemy strongly  posted and entrenched, was thus imposed upon Buller. It was not doubted  that he would be compelled to make a frontal attack on Colenso and in  this the Boers showed the more correct appreciation of the situation.  Botha hoped to lure Buller on and was prepared even to allow him to  cross the river; and having crushed him to act upon the British flanks,  an operation which the wide extension of Botha's front from Hlangwhane  to Robinson's farm, a distance of seven miles, gave him a good chance of  being able to carry out. If necessary, reinforcements could be drawn  from the investing circle around Ladysmith, which seemed to be detaining  more burghers than were necessary for the maintenance of the siege.    Buller proclaimed his intention of attacking Botha by a preliminary  bombardment of the Colenso kopjes on December 13 and 14; but the  burghers lay low and gave so little indication of their presence that it  almost seemed that they had abandoned the line of the Tugela. The  British Army was encamped near Chieveley four miles south of Colenso.    On the evening of December 14 the scheme of attack was delivered to the  Brigadiers. The leading idea of it was a frontal attack to be delivered  from the village of Colenso, where the Tugela is crossed by an iron  railway bridge as well as by an iron wagon bridge. The latter had been  left intact by the enemy, possibly in order to entice the British troops  across the river. Buller appears to have been unaware how far the Boer  trenches extended towards the west, and to have assumed that only the  kopjes immediately opposite Colenso were occupied. Hildyard's Brigade  was ordered to march in the direction of the \"iron bridge,\"[21] to cross  at that point, and then to \"seize the kopjes north of the iron bridge.\"  The attack on the enemy's right, which was believed to be weak, was  assigned to Hart's Irish Brigade. He was instructed to cross the Tugela  at a bridle drift about two miles west of Colenso and work down the left  bank towards the occupied kopjes. Two infantry Brigades were retained as  reserves to be used when required; and the mounted Brigade was ordered  to move towards Hlangwhane and occupy it, if possible, and cover the  right flank; but the weakness of the Boer position on that hill, which  was cut off by the river from the main line of defence, does not seem to  have been realized. A few batteries were sent with Hart, but the bulk of  the artillery was ordered east of the railway to support Hildyard.    Buller's scheme has been severely criticized ever since its failure, but  Clery who was in nominal command of the Natal force, and in whose name  the battle orders were issued, as well as the other general officers,  acquiesced in it. But in fact hardly any scheme could have been devised  more likely to play into Botha's hands. Buller hoped to get a footing on  the left bank and Botha hoped that he would succeed in doing so. Botha's  special idea was to allure the troops of the frontal attack to his own  side, where he could easily pound them from his kopjes and carry out his  general idea of netting the British flanks.    Buller had not then been in action with the Boers and he probably  underrated their tactical capacity; but already he seems to have  contemplated the possibility of the loss of Ladysmith, for in his  despatch of December 13 to Lord Lansdowne, in which he justified his  sudden change of the plan of campaign, he said that \"it would be better  to lose"]]]
