Truly it was an answer to the cry of the wolf-dog, for in the slender  compass it carried the same wail, the same unearthly quality with this  great difference, that a thrilling happiness went through it, as if some  one walked through the mountains and rejoiced in the unknown terrors. A  sob formed in the throat of Kate and the wolf turned its head and looked  at her, and the yellow of things that see in the night swam in its eyes.  Lee Haines struck the arm of Buck Daniels.    \"Buck, let's get clear of this. Let's start. He's coming.\"    At the whisper Buck turned a livid face; one could see him gather his  strength.    \"I stick,\" he said with difficulty, as though his lips were numb.  \"She'll need me now.\"    Lee Haines stood in a moment's indecision but then settled back in his  chair and gripped his hands together. They both sat watching the door as  if the darkness were a magnet of inescapable horror. Only Joan, of  all in that room, showed no fear after the first moment. Her face was  blanched indeed, but she tilted it up now, smiling; she stole towards  the door, but Kate caught the child and gathered her close with  strangling force. Joan made no attempt to escape. \"S-sh!\" she cautioned,  and raised a plump little forefinger. \"Munner, don't you hear? Don't you  like it?\"    As if the sound had turned a corner, it broke all at once clearly over  them in a rain of music; a man's whistling. It went out; it flooded  about them again like beautiful, cold light. Once again it stopped, and  now they sensed, rather than heard, a light, rapid, padding step that  approached the cabin. Dan Barry stood in the door and in that shadowy  place his eyes seemed luminous. He no longer whistled, but a spirit went  from him which carried the same sense of the untamed, the wild happiness  which died out with his smile as he looked around the room. The brim  of his hat curved up, his neckerchief seemed to flutter a little. The  wolf-dog reached the threshold in the same instant and stood looking  steadily up into the face of the master.    \"Daddy Dan!\" cried Joan.    She had slipped from the nerveless arms of Kate and now ran towards her  father, but here she faltered, there she stopped with her arms slowly  falling back to her sides. He did not seem to see her, but looked past  her, far beyond every one in the room as he walked to the wall and took  down a bridle that hung on a peg. Kate laid her hands on the arms of the  chair, but after the first effort to rise, her strength failed.    \"Dan!\" she said. It was only a whisper, a heart-stopping sound. \"Dan!\"  Her voice rang, then her arms gathered to her, blindly, Joan, who had  shrunk back. \"What's happened?\"    \"Molly died.\"    \"Died.\"    \"They broke her leg.\"    \"The posse!\"    \"With a long shot.\"    \"What are you going to do!\"    \"Get Satan. Go for a ride.\"    \"Where?\"    He looked about him, troubled, and then frowned. \"I dunno. Out yonder.\"    He waved his arm. Black Bart followed the turn of the master's body, and  switching around in front continued to stare up into Dan's face.    \"You're going back after the posse?\"    \"No, I'm done with them.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"They paid for Grey Molly.\"    \"You shot one of their--horses?\"    \"A man.\"    \"God help us!\" Then life came to her; she sprang up and ran between him  and the door. \"You shan't go. If you love me!\" She was only inches from  Black Bart, and the big animal showed his teeth in silent hate.    \"Kate, I'm goin'. Don't stand in the door.\"    Joan, slipping around Bart, stood clinging to the skirts of her mother  and watched the face of Dan, fascinated, silent.    \"Tell me where you're going. Tell me when you're coming back. Dan, for  pity!\"    Loud as a trumpet, a horse neighed from the corral. Dan had stood with  an uncertain face, but now he smiled.    \"D'you hear? I got to go!\"    \"I heard Satan whinney. But what does that mean? How does that make you  go?\"    \"Somewhere,\" he murmured, \"something's happening. I felt it on the wind  when I was comin' up the pass.\"    \"If you--oh, Dan, you're breaking my heart!\"    \"Stand out of the door.\"    \"Wait till the morning.\"    \"Don't you see I can't wait?\"    \"One hour, ten minutes. Buck--Lee Haines--\"    She could not finish, but Buck Daniels stepped closer, trying to make a  smile grow on his ashen face.    \"Another minute, Dan, and I'll tell a man you've forgotten me.\"    Barry pivoted suddenly as though uneasy at finding something behind him,  and Daniels winced.    \"Hello, Buck. Didn't see you was here. Lee Haines? Lee, this is fine.\"    He passed from one to the other and his handshake was only the elusive  passage of his fingers through their palms. Haines shrugged his  shoulders to get rid of a weight that clung to him; a touch of color  came back to his face.    \"Look here, Dan. If you're afraid that gang may trail you here and start  raising the devil--how many are there?\"    \"Five.\"    \"I'm as good with a gun as I ever was in the old days. So is Buck.  Partner, let's make the show down together. Stick here with Kate and  Joan and Buck and I will help you hold the fort. Don't look at me like  that. I mean it. Do you think I've forgotten what you did for me that  night in Elkhead? Not in a thousand years. Dan, I'd rather make my last  play here than any other place in the world. Let 'em come! We'll salt  them down and plant them where they won't grow.\"    As he talked the pallor quite left him, and the fighting fire blazed  in his eyes, he stood lion-like, his feet spread apart as if to meet  a shock, his tawny head thrown back, and there was about him a  hair-trigger sensitiveness, in spite of his bulk, a nervousness of hand  and coldness of glance which characterizes the gun-fighter. Buck Daniels  stepped closer, without a word, but one felt that he also had walked  into the alliance. As Barry watched them the yellow which swirled in his  eyes flickered away for a moment.    \"Why, gents,\" he murmured, \"they ain't any call for trouble. The posse?  What's that got to do with me? Our accounts are all squared up.\"    The two stared dumbly.    \"They killed Grey Molly; I killed one of them.\"    \"A horse--for a man?\" repeated Lee Haines, breathing hard.    \"A life for a life,\" said Dan simply. \"They got no call for  complainin'.\"    Glances of wonder, glances of meaning, flashed back and forth from  Haines to Buck.    \"Well, then,\" said the latter, and he took in Kate with a caution from  the corner of his eye, \"if that's the case, let's sit down and chin for  a minute.\"    Dan stood with his head bowed a little, frowning; two forces pulled him,  and Kate leaned against the wall off in the shadow with her eyes closed,  waiting, waiting, waiting through the crisis.    \"I'd like to stay and chin with you, Buck--but, I got to be off. Out  there--in the night--something may happen before mornin'.\" Black Bart  licked the hand of the master and whined. \"Easy, boy. We're startin'.\"    \"But the night's just beginnin',\" said Buck Daniels genially. \"You got a  world of time before you, and with Satan to fall back on you don't have  to count your minutes. Pull up a chair beside me, Dan, and--\"    The latter shook his head, decided. \"Buck, I can't do it. Just to sit  here\"--he looked about him--\"makes me feel sort of choked. Them walls  are as close--as a coffin.\"    He was already turning; Kate straightened in the shadow, desperate.    \"As a matter of fact, Dan,\" said Lee Haines, suddenly, \"we need your  help badly.\"    \"Help?\"    The heart of Kate stood in her eyes as she looked at Lee Haines.    \"Sit down a minute, Dan, and I'll tell you about it.\"    Barry slipped into a chair which he had pulled to one side--so that the  back of it was towards the wall, and every one in the room was before  him.        Chapter XIV. Suspense    The help which Lee Haines wanted, it turned out, was guidance across  a difficult stretch of country which he and Buck Daniels wanted  to prospect, and while he talked Barry listened uneasily. It was  constitutionally impossible for him to say no when a favor was asked of  him, and Haines counted heavily on that characteristic; in the meantime  Black Bart lay on the hearth with his wistful eyes turned steadily up  to the master; and Buck Daniels went to Kate on the farther side of the  room. She sat quivering, alternately crushing and soothing Joan with the  strength of her caresses. Buck drew a chair close, with his back half  towards the fire.    \"Turn around a little, Kate,\" he cautioned. \"Don't let Dan see your  face.\"    She obeyed him automatically.    \"Is there a hope, Buck? What have I done to deserve this? I don't want  to live; I want to die! I want to die!\"    \"Steady, steady!\" he cut in, and his face was working. \"If you keep on  like this you'll bust down in a minute or two. And you know what tears  do to Dan; he'll be out of this house like a scairt coyote. Brace up!\"    She struggled and won a partial control.    \"I'm fighting hard, Buck.\"    \"Fight harder still. You ought to know him better than I do. When he's  like this it drives him wild to have other folks thinkin' about him.\"    He looked over to Dan. In spite of the bowed head of the latter as he  listened to Haines yarning he gave an impression of electric awareness  to all that was around him.    \"Talk soft,\" whispered Buck. \"Maybe he knows we're talkin' about him.\"    He raised his voice out of the whisper, breaking in on a sentence about  Joan, as if this were the tenor of their talk. Then he lowered his tone  again.    \"Think quick. Talk soft. Do you want Dan kept here?\"    \"For God's sake, yes.\"    \"Suppose the posse gets him here?\"    \"We musn't dodge the law.\"    They were gauging their voices with the closest precision. Talking like  this so close to Barry was like dancing among flasks of nitroglycerine.  Once, and once only, Lee Haines cast a desperate eye across to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18993"],[0,"History  of the World War: An Authentic Narrative of the World's Greatest War (#14)"],[1,"has played for more than eighty years in  the civilization of the world, she refuses to believe that the  independence of Belgium can be preserved only at the expense of the  violation of her neutrality.    If this hope were disappointed the Belgian Government has firmly  resolved to repulse by every means in her power any attack upon her  rights.      The German attack upon Belgium and France came with terrible force and  suddenness. Twenty-four army corps, divided into three armies clad in a  specially designed and colored gray-green uniform, swept in three mighty  streams over the German borders with their objective the heart of  France. The Army of the Meuse was given the route through Liege, Namur  and Maubeuge. The Army of the Moselle violated the Duchy of Luxemburg,  which, under a treaty guaranteeing its independence and neutrality, was  not permitted to maintain an army. Germany was a signatory party to this  treaty also. The Army of the Rhine cut through the Vosges Mountains and  its route lay between the French cities of Nancy and Toul.    The heroic defense of the Belgian army at Liege against the Army of the  Meuse delayed the operation of Germany's plans and in all probability  saved Paris. It was the first of many similar disappointments and checks  that Germany encountered during the war.    The defense of Liege continued for ten heroic days. Within that interval  the first British Expeditionary Forces were landed in France and  Belgium, the French army was mobilized to full strength. The little  Belgian army falling back northward on Antwerp, Louvain and Brussels,  threatened the German flank and approximately 200,000 German soldiers  were compelled to remain in the conquered section of Belgium to garrison  it effectively.    Liege fortifications were the design of the celebrated strategist  Brialmont. They consisted of twelve isolated fortresses which had been  permitted to become out of repair. No field works of any kind connected  them and they were without provision for defense against encircling  tactics and against modern artillery.    The huge 42-centimeter guns, the first of Germany's terrible surprises,  were brought into action against these forts, and their concrete and  armored steel turrets were cracked as walnuts are cracked between the  jaws of a nut-cracker. The Army of the Meuse then made its way like a  gray-green cloud of poison gas through Belgium. A cavalry screen of  crack Uhlan regiments preceded it, and it made no halt worthy of note  until it confronted the Belgian army on the line running from Louvain to  Namur. The Belgians were forced back before Louvain on August 20th, the  Belgian Government removed the capital from Brussels to Antwerp, and the  German hosts entered evacuated Brussels.    During this advance of the Army of the Meuse, strong French detachments  invaded German soil, pouring into Alsace through the Belfort Gap. Brief  successes attended the bold stroke. Mulhausen was captured and the  Metz-Strassburg Railroad was cut in several places. The French suffered  a defeat almost immediately following this first flush of victory, both  in Alsace and in Lorraine, where a French detachment had engaged with  the Army of the Moselle. The French army thereupon retreated to the  strong line of forts and earthworks defending the border between France  and Germany.    England's first expeditionary force landed at Ostend, Calais and Dunkirk  on August 7th. It was dubbed England's \"contemptible little army\" by the  German General Staff. That name was seized upon gladly by England as a  spur to volunteering. It brought to the surface national pride and a  fierce determination to compel Germany to recognize and to reckon with  the \"contemptible little army.\"    The contact between the French, Belgian and British forces was speedily  established and something like concerted resistance to the advance of  the enemy was made possible. The German army, however, followed by a  huge equipment of motor kitchens, munition trains, and other motor  transport evidencing great care in preparation for the movement, swept  resistlessly forward until it encountered the French and British on a  line running from Mons to Charleroi.    The British army was assigned to a position between two French armies.  By some miscalculation, the French army that was to have taken its  position on the British left, never appeared. The French army on the  right was attacked and defeated at Charleroi, falling back in some  confusion. The German Army of the Moselle co-operating with the Army of  the Meuse then attacked the British and French, and a great flanking  movement by the German joint commands developed.    This was directed mainly at the British under command of Sir John  French. There followed a retreat that for sheer heroism and dogged  determination has become one of the great battles of all time. The  British, outflanked and outnumbered three to one, fought and marched  without cessation for six days and nights. Time after time envelopment  and disaster threatened them, but with a determination that would not be  beaten they fought off the best that Germany could send against them,  maintained contact with the French army on their right, and delayed the  German advance so effectively that a complete disarrangement of all the  German plans ensued. This was the second great disappointment to  Germany. It made possible the victory of the Marne and the victorious  peace of 1918. The story of that immortal retreat is best told in the  words of Sir John French, transmitting the report of this encounter to  the British War Office:    \"The transport of the troops from England both by sea and by rail was  effected in the best order and without a check. Each unit arrived at its  destination well within the scheduled time.    \"The concentration was practically complete on the evening of Friday,  the 21st ultimo, and I was able to make dispositions to move the force  during Saturday, the 22d, to positions I considered most favorable from  which to commence operations which the French commander-in-chief,  General Joffre, requested me to undertake in pursuance of his plans in  prosecution of the campaign.    \"The line taken up extended along the line of the canal from Conde on  the west, through Mons and Binche on the east. This line was taken up as  follows:    \"From Conde to Mons, inclusive, was assigned to the Second Corps, and to  the right of the Second Corps from Mons the First Corps was posted. The  Fifth Cavalry Brigade was placed at Binche.    \"In the absence of my Third Army Corps I desired to keep the cavalry  divisions as much as possible as a reserve to act on my outer flank, or  move in support of any threatened part of the line. The forward  reconnoissance was intrusted to Brig.-Gen. Sir Philip Chetwode, with the  Fifth Cavalry Brigade, but I directed General Allenby to send forward a  few squadrons to assist in this work.    \"During the 22d and 23d these advanced squadrons did some excellent  work, some of them penetrating as far as Soignies, and several  encounters took place in which our troops showed to great advantage.    \"2. At 6 A. M., on August 23d, I assembled the commanders of the First  and Second Corps and cavalry division at a point close to the position  and explained the general situation of the Allies, and what I understood  to be General Joffre's plan. I discussed with them at some length the  immediate situation in front of us.    \"From information I received from French headquarters I understood that  little more than one, or at most two, of the enemy's army corps, with  perhaps one cavalry division, were in front of my position; and I was  aware of no attempted outflanking movement by the enemy. I was confirmed  in this opinion by the fact that my patrols encountered no undue  opposition in their reconnoitering operations. The observations of my  airplanes seemed to bear out this estimate.    \"About 3 P. M. on Sunday, the 23d, reports began coming in to the effect  that the enemy was commencing an attack on the Mons line, apparently in  some strength, but that the right of the position from Mons and Bray was  being particularly threatened.    \"The commander of the First Corps had pushed his flank back to some high  ground south of Bray, and the Fifth Cavalry Brigade evacuated Binche,  moving slightly south; the enemy thereupon occupied Binche.    \"The right of the Third Division, under General Hamilton, was at Mons,  which formed a somewhat dangerous salient; and I directed the commander  of the Second Corps to be careful not to keep the troops on this salient  too long, but, if threatened seriously, to draw back the center behind  Mons. This was done before dark. In the meantime, about 5 P. M., I  received a most unexpected message from General Joffre by telegraph,  telling me that at least three German corps, viz., a reserve corps, the  Fourth Corps and the Ninth Corps, were moving on my position in front,  and that the Second Corps was engaged in a turning movement from the  direction of Tournay. He also informed me that the two reserve French  divisions and the Fifth French army on my right were retiring, the  Germans having on the previous day gained possession of the passages of  the Sambre, between Charleroi and Namur.    \"3. In view of the possibility of my being driven from the Mons  position, I had previously ordered a position in rear to be  reconnoitered. This position rested on the fortress of Maubeuge on the  right and extended west to Jenlain, southeast to Valenciennes, on the  left. The position was reported difficult to hold, because standing  crops and buildings made the placing of trenches very difficult and  limited the field of fire in many important localities. It nevertheless  afforded a few good artillery positions.    \"When the news of the retirement of the French and the heavy German  threatening on my front reached me, I endeavored to"]]]
