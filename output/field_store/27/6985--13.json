Hy het ons mense hard geteister,        Windmaker in sy dwinglandy.        Dingaan, die Soeloe, was 'n duiwel,        Maar hy is lankal dood, en nou      Het ons geen mens, wat ons kan teister--        En tog sit ons nog in die rou!                      XVIII.        Klim op, klim op, met die slingerpad!        Klim op, klim op, tot jy staan daar bo,      Waar jy al ons land in 'n oomblik vat,        Van die Suurveld af tot die kaal Karoo!        Klim op, klim op, langs die slingerpad!        Klim op, tot jy bo-op staan; en kyk,      Hoe mooi ons wêreld is! Dan weet        Jou siel die waarheid--want jy is ryk!                      XIX.        Die see het juwele, robyne,        So rooi as 'n korrel granaat;      Die see het sy lyke, geraamtes,        Van elke verdrinkte Janmaat.        Die see het sy skulpe, wat, mooier        As ooit ook 'n mens dit kan maak,      Daar pronk in paleise van seegras,        Waar ewig die branders om kraak.        Die see het 'n hart: in die diepte--        Waar selfs nie 'n kreef kan bestaan,      Waar lewens nog laer as muggies        Gebore word om te vergaan--        Daar setel sy siel, en dit uiter        In elke verandring sy wil!      Verslinger die rotse die branders,        Die see sal daar nimmer van gril;        Want ewig en altyd onsterflik        Is diep in die diepte sy krag,      En laag in die land van sy lewe        'n Siel, wat vir ewig kan wag.                      XX.        Die see is wild, die see is blind:        Hy slaan so oor die rotse grof;        Veraf nog dreun sy donder dof,      En oor hom huil die noordewind.        Die wind is wild, die wind is kwaai:        Hy gons die bome deur en breek        Die takke van die stam, en steek      Die haelbui aan met sy lawaai.        Die hael is wild, die hael is sterk;        Hy maak die see se branders glad,        En stamp die koringvelde plat,      En breek die sekretaars se vlerk.        Nog wilder as die see en wind,        Nog strammer as die haelstormsnood,        Nog blinder as die drie--die Dood,      Wat op jou voorkop sit, ou vrind!                  Die Einde.          Gee vrede en rus vir ons almal, wat lam is van swerwe,      Moed en geduld vir ons almal, wat bang is te sterwe;      Gee vir ons hart soos in somer die sap vir die bome;      Gee vir ons krag vir die werk en verstand vir die drome;      Gee, dat ons lag, as die lewenslas druk op ons harte;      Gee vir ons hoop in die donkerste nagte en smarte;      Gee vrede en rus vir ons almal, wat lewe en erwe      Smart en verdriet, met die reg om uiteindlik te sterwe.      Gee vrede en rus; en ons vra nie iets anders, en luister      Stil na die wind, wat so sag in ons ore kom fluister:                  \"Moed, mense, hou moed!

The giant kept an enchanted castle in the midst of a lonely  wood. About four months after the death of Cormoran, as Jack was  taking a journey into Wales, he passed through this wood; and, as he  was very weary, he sat down to rest by the side of a pleasant  fountain, and there he fell into a deep sleep. The giant came to the  fountain for water just at this time, and found Jack there; and as the  lines on Jack's belt showed who he was, the giant lifted him up and  laid him gently upon his shoulder, to carry him to his castle; but, as  he passed through the thicket, the rustling of the leaves waked Jack;  and he was sadly afraid when he found himself in the clutches of  Blunderbore. Yet this was nothing to his fright soon after; for, when  they reached the castle, he beheld the floor covered all over with the  skulls and bones of men and women. The giant took him into a large  room, where lay the hearts and limbs of persons who had been lately  killed; and he told Jack, with a horrid grin, that men's hearts, eaten  with pepper and vinegar, were his nicest food, and also, that he  thought he should make a dainty meal on his heart. When he had said  this, he locked Jack up in that room, while he went to fetch another  giant, who lived in the same wood, to enjoy a dinner off Jack's flesh  with him. While he was away, Jack heard dreadful shrieks, groans, and  cries from many parts of the castle; and soon after he heard a  mournful voice repeat these lines:--        \"Haste, valiant stranger, haste away,      Lest you become the giant's prey.      On his return he'll bring another,      Still more savage than his brother;      A horrid, cruel monster, who,      Before he kills, will torture you.      Oh valiant stranger! haste away,      Or you'll become these giants' prey.\"    This warning was so shocking to poor Jack, that he was ready to go  mad. He ran to the window, and saw the two giants coming along arm in  arm. This window was right over the gates of the castle. \"Now,\"  thought Jack, \"either my death or freedom is at hand.\"    There were two strong cords in the room. Jack made a large noose, with  a slip-knot at the ends of both these, and, as the giants were coming  through the gates, he threw the ropes over their heads. He then made  the other ends fast to a beam in the ceiling, and pulled with all his  might, till he had almost strangled them. When he saw that they were  both quite black in the face, and had not the least strength left, he  drew his sword, and slid down the ropes; he then killed the giants,  and thus saved himself from a cruel death. Jack next took a great  bunch of keys from the pocket of Blunderbore, and went into the castle  again. He made a strict search through all the rooms, and in them  found three ladies tied up by the hair of their heads, and almost  starved to death. They told him that their husbands had been killed by  the giants, who had then condemned them to be starved to death,  because they would not eat the flesh of their own dead husbands.    \"Ladies,\" said Jack, \"I have put an end to the monster and his wicked  brother; and I give you this castle and all the riches it contains, to  make you some amends for the dreadful pains you have felt.\" He then  very politely gave them the keys of the castle, and went further on  his journey to Wales.    As Jack had not taken any of the giant's riches for himself, and had  very little money of his own, he thought it best to travel as fast as  he could. At length he lost his way; and, when night came on, he was  in a lonely valley between two lofty mountains. There he walked about  for some hours, without seeing any dwelling-place, so he thought  himself very lucky at last in finding a large and handsome house. He  went up to it boldly, and knocked loudly at the gate; when, to his  great terror and surprise, there came forth a monstrous giant with two  heads. He spoke to Jack very civilly, for he was a Welsh giant, and  all the mischief he did was by private and secret malice, under the  show of friendship and kindness. Jack told him that he was a traveller  who had lost his way, on which the huge monster made him welcome, and  led him into a room, where there was a good bed in which to pass the  night. Jack took off his clothes quickly; but though he was so weary,  he could not go to sleep. Soon after this, he heard the giant walking  backward and forward in the next room, and saying to himself:--        \"Though here you lodge with me this night,      You shall not see the morning light;      My club shall dash your brains out quite.\"    \"Say you so?\" thought Jack. \"Are these your tricks upon travellers?  But I hope to prove as cunning as you.\" Then getting out of bed, he  groped about the room, and at last found a large thick billet of wood;  he laid it in his own place in the bed, and hid himself in a dark  corner of the room. In the middle of the night the giant came with his  great club, and struck many heavy blows on the bed, in the very place  where Jack had laid the billet, and then he went back to his own room,  thinking he had broken all his bones. Early in the morning, Jack put a  bold face upon the matter, and walked into the giant's room to thank  him for his lodging.    The giant started when he saw him, and he began to stammer out, \"Oh,  dear me! is it you? Pray how did you sleep last night? Did you hear or  see anything in the dead of the night?\"    \"Nothing worth speaking of,\" said Jack, carelessly; \"a rat, I  believe, gave me three or four slaps with his tail, and disturbed me a  little, but I soon went to sleep again.\"    The giant wondered more and more at this; yet he did not answer a  word, and went to bring two great bowls of hasty-pudding for their  breakfast.    Jack wished to make the giant believe that he could eat as much as  himself; so he contrived to button a leathern bag inside his coat, and  slipped the hasty-pudding into this bag, while he seemed to put it  into his mouth. When breakfast was over, he said to the giant, \"Now I  will show you a fine trick; I can cure all wounds with a touch; I  could cut off my head one minute, and the next put it sound again on  my shoulders: you shall see an example.\" He then took hold of the  knife, ripped up the leathern bag, and all the hasty-pudding tumbled  out upon the floor.    \"Ods splutter hur nails,\" cried the Welsh giant, who was ashamed to be  outdone by such a little fellow as Jack; \"hur can do that hurself.\" So  he snatched up the knife, plunged it into his stomach, and in a moment  dropped down dead.    As soon as Jack had thus tricked the Welsh monster, he went farther on  his journey; and, a few days after, he met with King Arthur's only  son, who had got his father's leave to travel into Wales, to deliver a  beautiful lady from the power of a wicked magician, by whom she was  held in enchantment. When Jack found that the young prince had no  servants with him, he begged leave to attend him; and the prince at  once agreed to this, and gave Jack many thanks for his kindness.    King Arthur's son was a handsome, polite, and brave knight, and so  good-natured, that he gave money to everybody he met. At length he  gave his last penny to an old woman, and then turned to Jack, \"How  shall we be able to get food for ourselves the rest of our journey?\"    \"Leave that to me, sir,\" replied Jack; \"I will provide for my prince.\"    Night now came on, and the prince began to grow uneasy at thinking  where they should lodge.    \"Sir,\" said Jack, \"be of good heart; two miles further there lives a  large giant, whom I know well; he has three heads, and will fight five  hundred men, and make them fly before him.\"    \"Alas!\" cried the king's son, \"we had better never have been born than  meet with such a monster.\"    \"My lord, leave me to manage him, and wait here in quiet till I  return.\"    The prince now stayed behind, while Jack rode on at full speed; and  when he came to the gates of the castle, he gave a loud knock. The  giant, with a voice like thunder, roared out, \"Who is there?\"    Jack made answer, and said, \"No one but your poor cousin Jack.\"    \"Well,\" said the giant, \"what news, cousin Jack?\"    \"Dear uncle,\" said Jack, \"I have heavy news.\"    \"Pooh!\" said the giant, \"what heavy news can come to me? I am a giant  with three heads, and can fight five hundred men, and make them fly  before me.\"    \"Alas!\" said Jack, \"here's the king's son coming with two thousand men  to kill you, and to destroy the castle and all that you have.\"    \"Oh, cousin Jack,\" said the giant, \"this is heavy news indeed! But I  have a large cellar underground, where I will hide myself, and you  shall lock, bolt, and bar me in, and keep the keys till the king's son  is gone.\"    Now, when Jack had barred the giant fast in the vault, he went back  and fetched the prince to the castle; they both made themselves merry  with the wine and other dainties that were in the house. So that night  they rested very pleasantly while the poor giant lay trembling and  shaking with fear in the cellar underground. Early in the morning,  Jack gave the king's son gold and silver out of the giant's treasure,  and accompanied him three miles forward on his journey. The prince  then sent Jack to let his uncle out of the hole, who asked him what he  should give him as a reward for saving his castle.    \"Why, good uncle,\" said Jack, \"I desire nothing but the old coat and  cap, with the old rusty sword and slippers, which are hanging at your  bed's head.\"    \"Then,\" said the giant, \"you shall have them: and pray "]]]
