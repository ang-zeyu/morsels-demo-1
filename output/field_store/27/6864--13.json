He was the official ancestor of a royal house, a fact proved by the way  in which his conqueror uses the name to distinguish the country over  which he had ruled; moreover, the epoch assigned to him by contemporary  chroniclers coincides closely enough with that indicated by tradition  in the case of Deiokes. He was never the august sovereign that posterity  afterwards made him out to be, and his territory included barely half of  what constituted the province of Media in classical times; he contrived,  however--and it was this that gained him universal renown in later  days--to create a central rallying-point for the Median tribes around  which they henceforth grouped themselves. The work of concentration  was merely in its initial stage during the lifetime of Sennacherib, and  little or nothing was felt of its effects outside its immediate area of  influence, but the pacific character ascribed to the worthy Deiokes by  popular legends, is to a certain extent confirmed by the testimony of  the monuments: they record only one expedition, in 702, against Ellipi  and the neighbouring tribes, in the course of which some portions of the  newly acquired territory were annexed to the province of Kharkhar, and  after mentioning this the annals have nothing further to relate during  the rest of the reign. Sennacherib was too much taken up with his  retaliatory measures against Babylon, or his disputes with Blam, to  think of venturing on expeditions such as those which had brought  Tiglath-pileser III. or Sargon within sight of Mount Bikni; while the  Medes, on their part, had suffered so many reverses under these two  monarchs that they probably thought twice before attacking any of the  outposts scattered along the Assyrian frontier: nothing occurred  to disturb their tranquillity during the early years of the seventh  century, and this peaceful interval probably enabled Deiokes to  consolidate, if not to extend, his growing authority. But if matters  were quiet, at all events on the surface, in this direction, the nations  on the north and north-west had for some time past begun to adopt a more  threatening attitude. That migration of races between Europe and Asia,  which had been in such active progress about the middle of the second  millennium before our era, had increased twofold in intensity after the  rise of the XXth Egyptian dynasty, and from thenceforward a wave of new  races had gradually spread over the whole of Asia Minor, and had either  driven the older peoples into the less fertile or more inaccessible  districts, or else had overrun and absorbed them.    [Illustration: 090.jpg ASIA MINOR IN THE 7TH CENTURY]    Many of the nations that had fought against Ramses II. and Ramses III.,  such as the Uashasha, the Shagalasha, the Zakkali, the Danauna, and  the Tursha, had disappeared, but the Thracians, whose appearance on the  scene caused such consternation in days gone by, had taken root in the  very heart of the peninsula, and had, in the course of three or four  generations, succeeded in establishing a thriving state. The legend  which traced the descent of the royal line back to the fabulous hero  Ascanius proves that at the outset the haughty tribe of the Ascanians  must have taken precedence over their fellows;* it soon degenerated,  however, and before long the Phrygian tribe gained the upper hand and  gave its name to the whole nation.         * The name of this tribe was retained by a district       afterwards included in the province of Bithynia, viz.       Ascania, on the shores of the Ascanian lake: the       distribution of place and personal names over the face of       the country makes it seem extremely probable that Ascania       and the early Ascanians occupied the whole of the region       bounded on the north by the Propontis; in other words, the       very country in which, according to Xanthus of Lydia, the       Phry gians first established themselves after their arrival       in Asia.    Phrygia proper, the country first colonised by them, lay between Mount  Dindymus and the river Halys, in the valley of the Upper Sangarios and  its affluents: it was there that the towns and strongholds of their most  venerated leaders, such as Midaion, Dorylaion, Gordiaion, Tataion, and  many others stood close together, perpetuating the memory of Midas,  Dorylas, Gordios, and Tatas. Its climate was severe and liable to  great extremes of temperature, being bitterly cold in winter and almost  tropical during the summer months; forests of oak and pine, however, and  fields of corn flourished, while the mountain slopes favoured the growth  of the vine; it was, in short, an excellent and fertile country, well  fitted for the development of a nation of vinedressers and tillers of  the soil. The slaying of an ox or the destruction of an agricultural  implement was punishable by death, and legend relates that Gordios,  the first Phrygian king, was a peasant by birth. His sole patrimony  consisted of a single pair of oxen, and the waggon used by him in  bringing home his sheaves after the harvest was afterwards placed as an  offering in the temple of Cybele at Ancyra by his son Midas; there was  a local tradition according to which the welfare of all Asia depended on  the knot which bound the yoke to the pole being preserved intact.  Midas did not imitate his father's simple habits, and the poets, after  crediting him with fabulous wealth, tried also to make out that he was a  conqueror. The kingdom expanded in all directions, and soon included the  upper valley of the Masander, with its primeval sanctuaries, Kydrara,  Colossae, and Kylsenae, founded wherever exhalations of steam and boiling  springs betrayed the presence of some supernatural power. The southern  shores of the Hellespont, which formed part of the Troad, and was  the former territory of the Ascania, belonged to it, as did also the  majority of the peoples scattered along the coast of the Euxine between  the mouth of the Sangarios and that of the Halys; those portions of the  central steppe which border on Lake Tatta were also for a time subject  to it, Lydia was under its influence, and it is no exaggeration to say  that in the tenth and eleventh centuries before our era there was a  regular Phrygian empire which held sway, almost without a rival, over  the western half of Asia Minor.    [Illustration: 095.jpg MONUMENT COMMEMORATIVE OF MIDAS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a plate in Perrot and Chipiez.    It has left behind it so few relics of its existence, that we can only  guess at what it must have been in the days of its prosperity. Three or  four ruined fortresses, a few votive stelae, and a dozen bas-reliefs cut  on the faces of cliffs in a style which at first recalls the Hittite and  Asianic carvings of the preceding age, and afterwards, as we come down  to later times, betrays the influence of early Greek art. In the midst  of one of their cemeteries we come upon a monument resembling the facade  of a house or temple cut out of the virgin rock; it consists of a low  triangular pediment, surmounted by a double scroll, then a rectangle  of greater length than height, framed between two pilasters and a  horizontal string-course, the centre being decorated with a geometrical  design of crosses in a way which suggests the pattern of a carpet; a  recess is hollowed out on a level with the ground, and filled by a blind  door with rebated doorposts. Is it a tomb? The inscription carefully  engraved above one side of the pediment contains the name of Midas, and  seems to show that we have before us a commemorative monument, piously  dedicated by a certain Ates in honour of the Phrygian hero.    [Illustration: 096.jpg A PHRYGIAN GOD]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by Ramsay.    Elsewhere we come upon the outlines of a draped female form, sometimes  alone, sometimes accompanied by two lions, or of a man clothed in a  short tunic, holding a sort of straight sceptre in his hand, and we  fancy that we have the image of a god before our eyes, though we cannot  say which of the deities handed down by tradition it may represent.  The religion of the Phrygians is shrouded in the same mystery as their  civilisation and their art, and presents a curious mixture of European  and Asianic elements. The old aboriginal races had worshipped from time  immemorial a certain mother-goddess, Ma, or Amma, the black earth,  which brings forth without ceasing, and nourishes all living things. Her  central place of worship seems, originally, to have been in the region  of the Anti-taurus, and it was there that her sacred cities--Tyana,  Venasa, and the Cappadocian Comana--were to be found as late as Roman  times; in these towns her priests were regarded as kings, and thousands  of her priestesses spent lives of prostitution in her service; but her  sanctuaries, with their special rites and regulations, were scattered  over the whole peninsula. She was sometimes worshipped under the form  of a meteoric stone, or betyle similar to those found in Canaan;* more  frequently she was represented in female shape, with attendant lions, or  placed erect on a lion in the attitude of walking.         * E.g. at Mount Dindymus and at Pessinus, which latter place       was supposed to possess the oldest sanctuary of Cybele. The       Pessinus stone, which was carried off to Rome in 204 B.C.,       was small, irregular in shape, and of a dark colour. Another       stone represented Ida.

That which was once my hated foe is now my friend,  and the sweetest thing is to die!' Thus he spoke, and ordered the softly  moving eunuch* to set fire to the wooden structure.         * The word translated \"softly moving eunuch\" is here perhaps       a proper name: the slave whose duty it was to kindle the       pyre was called Abrobatas in the version of the story chosen       by Bacchylides, while that adopted by the potter whose work       is reproduced on the opposite page, calls him Euthymos.    The maidens shrieked and threw their arms around their mother, for the  death before them was that most hated by mortals. But just when the  sparkling fury of the cruel fire had spread around, Zeus, calling up a  black-flanked cloud, extinguished the yellow flame.    Nothing is incredible of that which the will of the gods has decreed:  Apollo of Delos, seizing the old man, bore him, together with his  daughters of tender feet, into the Hyperborean land as a reward for  his piety, for no mortal had sent richer offerings to the illustrious  Pytho!\"    [Illustration: 075.jpg CIMESUS ON HIS PYRE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph of the original in       the Museum of the Louvre.    This miraculous ending delighted the poets and inspired many fine  lines, but history could with difficulty accommodate itself to such a  materialistic intervention of a divine being, and sought a less  fabulous solution. The legend which appeared most probable to the worthy  Herodotus did not even admit that the Lydian king took his own life;  it was Cyrus who condemned him, either with a view of devoting the  first-fruits of his victory to the immortals, or to test whether the  immortals would save the rival whose piety had been so frequently held  up to his admiration. The edges of the pyre had already taken light,  when the Lydian king sighed and thrice repeated the name of Solon. It  was a tardy recollection of a conversation in which the Athenian sage  had stated, without being believed, that none can be accounted truly  happy while they still live. Cyrus, applying it to himself, was seized  with remorse or pity, and commanded the bystanders to quench the fire,  but their efforts were in vain. Thereupon Croesus implored the pity of  Apollo, and suddenly the sky, which up till then had been serene and  clear, became overcast; thick clouds collected, and rain fell so  heavily that the burning pile was at once extinguished.*         * The story told by Nicolas of Damascus comes down probably       from Xanthus of Lydia, but with many additions borrowed       directly from Herodotus and rhetorical developments by the       author himself. Most other writers who tell the story depend       for their information, either directly or indirectly, on       Herodotus: in later times it was supposed that the Lydian       king was preserved from the flames by the use of some       talisman such as the Ephesian letters.    Well treated by his conqueror, the Lydian king is said to have become  his friend and most loyal counsellor; he accepted from him the fief of  Barene in Media, often accompanied him in his campaigns, and on more  than one occasion was of great service to him by the wise advice which  he gave.    We may well ask what would have taken place had he gained the decisive  victory over Cyrus that he hoped. Chaldaea possessed merely the semblance  of her former greatness and power, and if she still maintained her hold  over Mesopotamia, Syria, Phoenicia, and parts of Arabia, it was because  these provinces, impoverished by the Assyrian conquest, and entirely  laid waste by the Scythians, had lost the most energetic elements  of their populations, and felt themselves too much enfeebled to  rise against their suzerain. Egypt, like Chaldaea, was in a state of  decadence, and even though her Pharaohs attempted to compensate for the  inferiority of their native troops by employing foreign mercenaries,  their attempts at Asiatic rule always issued in defeat, and just as the  Babylonian sovereigns were unable to reduce them to servitude, so they  on their part were powerless to gain an advantage over the sovereigns of  Babylon. Hence Lydia, in her youth and vigour, would have found little  difficulty in gaining the ascendency over her two recent allies, but  beyond that she could not hope to push her success; her restricted  territory, sparse population, and outlying position would always have  debarred her from exercising any durable dominion over them, and though  absolute mistress of Asia Minor, the countries beyond the Taurus were  always destined to elude her grasp. If the Achaemenian, therefore, had  confined himself, at all events for the time being, to the ancient  limits of his kingdom, Egypt and Chaldaea would have continued to  vegetate each within their respective area, and the triumph of Croesus  would, on the whole, have caused but little change in the actual balance  of power in the East.    The downfall of Croesus, on the contrary, marked a decisive era in the  world's history. His army was the only one, from the point of numbers  and organisation, which was a match for that of Cyrus, and from the day  of its dispersion it was evident that neither Egypt nor Chaldaea had any  chance of victory on the battle-field. The subjection of Babylon and  Harran, of Hamath, Damascus, Tyre and Sidon, of Memphis and Thebes, now  became merely a question of time, and that not far distant; the whole of  Asia, and that part of Africa which had been the oldest cradle of human  civilisation, were now to pass into the hands of one man and form a  single empire, for the benefit of the new race which was issuing forth  in irresistible strength from the recesses of the Iranian table-land. It  was destined, from the very outset, to come into conflict with an  older, but no less vigorous race than itself, that of the Greeks, whose  colonists, after having swarmed along the coasts of the Mediterranean,  were now beginning to quit the seaboard and penetrate wherever they  could into the interior.    [Illustration: 078.jpg A PERSIAN KING FIGHTING WITH GREEKS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from an intaglio reproduced in the       _Antiquites du Bosphore cimmerien._    They had been on friendly terms with that dynasty of the Meramadae  who had shown reverence for the Hellenic gods; they had, as a whole,  disdained to betray Croesus, or to turn upon him when he was in  difficulties beyond the Halys; and now that he had succumbed to his  fate, they considered that the ties which had bound them to Sardes were  broken, and they were determined to preserve their independence at all  costs. This spirit of insubordination would have to be promptly dealt  with and tightly curbed, if perpetual troubles in the future were to  be avoided. The Asianic peoples soon rallied round their new  master--Phrygians, Mysians, the inhabitants on the shores of the Black  Sea, and those of the Pamphylian coast;* even Cilicia, which had held  its own against Chaldaea, Media, and Lydia, was now brought under the  rising power, and its kings were henceforward obedient to the Persian  rule.**         * None of the documents actually say this, but the general       tenor of Herodotus' account seems to show clearly that, with       the exception of the Greek cities of the Carians and       Lycians, all the peoples who had formed part of the Lydian       dominion under Croesus submitted, without any appreciable       resistance, after the taking of Sardes.         ** Herodotus mentions a second Syennesis king of Cilicia       forty years later at the time of the Ionian revolt.    The two leagues of the Ionians and AEolians had at first offered to  recognise Cyrus as their suzerain under the same conditions as those  with which Croesus had been satisfied; but he had consented to accept  it only in the case of Miletus, and had demanded from the rest an  unconditional surrender. This they had refused, and, uniting in a common  cause perhaps for the first time in their existence, they had resolved  to take up arms. As the Persians possessed no fleet, the Creeks had  nothing to fear from the side of the AEgean, and the severity of the  winter prevented any attack being made from the land side till the  following spring. They meanwhile sought the aid of their mother-country,  and despatched an embassy to the Spartans; the latter did not consider  it prudent to lend them troops, as they would have done in the case of  Croesus, but they authorised Lakrines, one of their principal citizens,  to demand of the great king that he should respect the Hellenic cities,  under pain of incurring their enmity.    [Illustration: 080.jpg THE PRESENT SITE OF MILETUS]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph.    Cyrus was fully occupied with the events then taking place in the  eastern regions of Iran; Babylon had not ventured upon any move after  having learned the news of the fall of Sardes, but the Bactrians and the  Sakae had been in open revolt during the whole of the year that he had  been detained in the extreme west, and a still longer absence might risk  the loss of his prestige in Media, and even in Persia itself.*         * The tradition followed by Ctesias maintained that the       submission of the eastern peoples was an accomplished fact       when the Lydian war began. That adopted by Herodotus placed       this event after the fall of Croesus; at any rate, it showed       that fear of the Bactrians and the Sakae, as well as of the       Babylonians and Egyptians was the cause that hastened Cyrus'       retreat.    The threat of the Lacedaaemonians had little effect upon him; he  inquired as to what Sparta and Greece were, and having been informed,  he ironically begged the Lacedaemonian envoy to thank his compatriots for  the good advice with which they had honoured him; \"but,\" he added, \"take  care that I do not soon cause you to babble, not of"]]]
