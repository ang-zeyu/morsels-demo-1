He asked what they were, but no  one could answer him.    At last an old peasant was found who said, \"Your highness, fifty years  ago my father told me that there is a castle in the woods where a  princess sleeps--the most beautiful princess that ever lived. It was  said that she must sleep there a hundred years, when she would be  awakened by a king's son.\"    At this the young prince determined to find out the truth for himself.  He leaped from his horse and began to force his way through the wood. To  his astonishment, the stiff branches gave way, then closed again,  allowing none of his companions to follow.    A beautiful palace rose before him. In the courtyard the prince saw  horses and men who looked as if they were dead. But he was not afraid  and boldly entered the palace. There were guards motionless as stone,  gentlemen and ladies, pages and footmen, some standing, some sitting,  but all like statues.    [Illustration: The prince finds the princess]    At last the prince came to a chamber of gold, where he saw upon a bed  the fairest sight one ever beheld--a princess of about seventeen years  who looked as if she had just fallen asleep. Trembling, the prince knelt  beside her, and awakened her with a kiss. And now the enchantment was  broken.    The princess looked at him with wondering eyes and said: \"Is it you, my  prince? I have waited for you long.\"    So happy were the two that they talked hour after hour. In the meantime  all in the palace awaked and each began to do what he was doing when he  fell asleep. The gentlemen went on bowing to the ladies, the ladies went  on with their embroidery. The grooms went on currying their horses, the  cook went on slapping the kitchen boy, and the servants began to serve  the supper. Then the chief lady in waiting, who was ready to die of  hunger, told the princess aloud that supper was ready.    The prince gave the princess his hand, and they all went into the great  hall for supper. That very evening the prince and princess were married.  The next day the prince took his bride to his father's palace, and there  they lived happily ever afterward.    --GRIMM.          THE UGLY DUCKLING    I      It was summer. The country was lovely just then. The cornfields were  waving yellow, the wheat was golden, the oats were still green, and the  hay was stacked in the meadows. Beyond the fields great forests and  ponds of water might be seen.    In the sunniest spot of all stood an old farmhouse, with deep canals  around it. At the water's edge grew great burdocks. It was just as wild  there as in the deepest wood, and in this snug place sat a duck upon her  nest. She was waiting for her brood to hatch.    At last one eggshell after another began to crack. From each little egg  came \"Cheep! cheep!\" and then a little duckling's head.    \"Quack! quack!\" said the duck; and all the babies quacked too. Then they  looked all around. The mother let them look as much as they liked, for  green is good for the eyes.    \"How big the world is!\" said all the little ducklings.    \"Do you think this is all the world?\" asked the mother. \"It stretches a  long way on the other side of the garden and on to the parson's field,  but I have never been so far as that. I hope you are all out. No, not  all; that large egg is still unbroken. I am really tired of sitting so  long.\" Then the duck sat down again.    \"Well, how goes it?\" asked an old duck who had come to pay her a visit.    \"There is one large egg that is taking a long time to hatch,\" replied  the mother. \"But you must look at the ducklings. They are the finest I  have ever seen; they are all just like their father.\"    \"Let me look at the egg which will not hatch,\" said the old duck. \"You  may be sure that it is a turkey's egg. I was once cheated in that way.  Oh, you will have a great deal of trouble, for a turkey will not go into  the water. Yes, that's a turkey's egg. Leave it alone and teach the  other children to swim.\"    \"No, I will sit on it a little longer,\" said the mother duck.    \"Just as you please,\" said the old duck, and she went away.    At last the large egg cracked. \"Cheep! cheep!\" said the young one, and  tumbled out. How large it was! How ugly it was!    \"I wonder if it can be a turkey chick,\" said the mother. \"Well, we shall  see when we go to the pond. It must go into the water, even if I have to  push it in myself.\"    Next day the mother duck and all her little ones went down to the water.  Splash! she jumped in, and all the ducklings went in, too. They swam  about very easily, and the ugly duckling swam with them.    \"No, it is not a turkey,\" said the mother duck. \"See how well he can use  his legs. He is my own child! And he is not so very ugly either.\"      II      Then she took her family into the duck yard. As they went along, she  told the ducklings how to act.    \"Keep close to me, so that no one can step on you,\" she said. \"Come;  now, don't turn your toes in. A well-brought-up duck turns its toes out,  just like father and mother. Bow your heads before that old duck yonder.  She is the grandest duck here. One can tell that by the red rag around  her leg. That's a great honor, the greatest honor a duck can have. It  shows that the mistress doesn't want to lose her. Now bend your necks  and say 'Quack!'\"    They did so, but the other ducks did not seem glad to see them.    \"Look!\" they cried. \"Here comes another brood, as if there were not  enough of us already. And oh, dear, how ugly that large one is! We won't  stand him.\"    Then one of the ducks flew at the ugly duckling and bit him in the neck.    [Illustration: The ugly duckling and the other ducks]    \"Let him alone,\" said the mother; \"he is doing no harm.\"    \"Perhaps not,\" said the duck who had bitten the poor duckling, \"but he  is too ugly to stay here. He must be driven out.\"    \"Those are pretty children that the mother has,\" said the old duck with  the rag around her leg. \"They are all pretty but that one. What a pity!\"    \"Yes,\" replied the mother duck, \"he is not handsome, but he is  good-tempered, and he swims as well as any of the others. I think he  will grow to be pretty. Perhaps he stayed too long in the egg.\"    \"Well, make yourselves at home,\" said the old duck. \"If you find an  eel's head, you may bring it to me.\"    And they did make themselves at home--all but the poor ugly duckling.  His life was made quite miserable. The ducks bit him, and the hens  pecked him. So it went on the first day, and each day it grew worse.    The poor duckling was very unhappy. At last he could stand it no longer,  and he ran away. As he flew over the fence, he frightened the little  birds on the bushes.    \"That is because I am so ugly,\" thought the duckling.    He flew on until he came to a moor where some wild ducks lived. They  laughed at him and swam away from him.    Some wild geese came by, and they laughed at the duckling, too. Just  then some guns went bang! bang! The hunters were all around. The hunting  dogs came splash! into the swamp, and one dashed close to the duckling.  The dog looked at him and went on.    \"Well, I can be thankful for that,\" sighed he. \"I am so ugly that even  the dog will not bite me.\"    When all was quiet, the duckling started out again. A storm was raging,  and he found shelter in a poor hut. Here lived an old woman with her cat  and her hen. The old woman could not see well, and she thought he was a  fat duck. She kept him three weeks, hoping that she would get some duck  eggs, but the duckling did not lay.    After a while the fresh air and sunshine streamed in at the open door,  and the duckling longed to be out on the water. The cat and the hen  laughed when he told them of his wish.    \"You must be crazy,\" said the hen. \"I do not wish to swim. The cat does  not; and I am sure our mistress does not.\"    \"You do not understand me,\" said the duckling. \"I will go out into the  wide world.\"    \"Yes, do go,\" said the hen.    And the duckling went away. He swam on the water and dived, but still  all the animals passed him by because he was so ugly; and the poor  duckling was lonesome.      III      Now the winter came, and soon it was very cold. Snow and sleet fell, and  the ugly duckling had a very unhappy time.    One evening a whole flock of handsome white birds rose out of the  bushes. They were swans. They gave a strange cry, and spreading their  great wings, flew away to warmer lands and open lakes.    The ugly duckling felt quite strange, and he gave such a loud cry that  he frightened himself. He could not forget those beautiful happy birds.  He knew not where they had gone, but he wished he could have gone with  them.    The winter grew cold--very cold. The duckling swam about in the water to  keep from freezing, but every night the hole in which he swam became  smaller and smaller. At last he was frozen fast in the ice.    Early the next morning a farmer found the duckling and took him to the  farmhouse. There in a warm room the duckling came to himself again. The  children wished to play with him, but he was afraid of them.    In his terror he fluttered into the milk pan and splashed the milk about  the room. The woman clapped her hands at him, and that frightened him  still more. He flew into the butter tub and then into the meal barrel.    How he did look then! The children laughed and screamed. The woman  chased him with the fire tongs. The door stood open, and the duckling  slipped out into the snow.    It was a cruel, hard winter, and he nearly froze. At last the warm sun  began to shine, and the larks to sing. The duckling flapped his wings  and found that they were strong. Away he flew over the meadows and  fields.    Soon he found himself in a beautiful garden where the apple trees were  in full bloom, and the long branches of the willow trees hung over the  shores of the lake.

With the completion of the station at Bold  Street the scheme may be said to have been brought successfully to a  conclusion. It was not until 1879, after the expenditure of  125,000_l._ upon trial borings, that the promoters ventured to appeal  to the public for support, and that a company, of which the Right Hon.  H. Cecil Raikes, M.P., was chairman, was formed for carrying the  project of the Mersey Railway into effect. The experience of the  engineers in the construction of the tunnel is not a little curious.  It was proved by the borings that the position in which the tunnel was  proposed to be bored was not only the most important from the point of  view of public convenience, and therefore of commercial advantage, but  was from the point of view of engineering difficulty decidedly the  most preferable. In this position the cuttings passed through the  sandstone rock, although on the Liverpool side the shafts were sunk  through a considerable depth through \"made\" ground, the whole of Mann  Island and the Goree being composed of earth and gravel tipped on the  old bank of the river. Indeed the miners passed through the cellars of  old houses and unearthed old water pipes; excavated through a depth of  tipped rubbish on which these houses had evidently been built; and  then came upon the former strand of the river, beneath which was the  blue silt usually found; then a stratum of bowlder clay; and finally  the red sandstone rock. Once begun, the works were pushed forward  night and day, Sundays excepted, until January, 1884, when the last  few feet of rock were cleared away by the boring machine, and the  mayors of Liverpool and Birkenhead met in fraternal greeting beneath  the river. The operations gave employment to 3,000 men working three  shifts of eight hours each, but were greatly accelerated by the use of  Colonel Beaumont's boring machine, on which disks of chilled iron are  set in a strong iron bar made to revolve by means of compressed air.  This machine scooped out a tunnel 7 feet in diameter; and by  successive improvements Colonel Beaumont attained a speed of 150 feet  per week, leaving the old method of blasting far behind. As the  machine moved forward the rock behind was broken out to the size of  the main tunnel and bricked in in short lengths. One remarkable  circumstance in connection with the work is that the boring from the  Birkenhead side and the boring from Liverpool were found, when they  were completed and joined, to be out of line by only 1 inch.    This excellent result was attained by careful calculations and  experiments with perpendicular wires kept in position by weights,  which, to avoid oscillation, were suspended in buckets of water. From  shaft to shaft the tunnel is 1,770 yards in length and 26 feet in  diameter; but for a length of 400 feet at the James Street and  Hamilton Square stations the arch is enlarged to 501/2 feet. The tunnel  is lined with from six to eight rings of solid brickwork embedded in  cement, the two inner rings being blue Staffordshire or Burnley  bricks. For the purpose of ventilation a smaller tunnel, 7 feet in  diameter, was bored parallel with the main tunnel, with which it is  connected in eight places by cross cuts, provided with suitable doors.  Both at Liverpool and at Birkenhead there are two guibal fans, one 40  feet and the other 30 feet in diameter. The smaller, which throw each  180,000 cubic feet of air per minute, ventilate the continuations of  the tunnel under Liverpool and Birkenhead respectively, and the larger  tunnel under the river. The fans remove together 600,000 cubic feet of  air per minute, and by this combined operation the entire air in the  tunnel is changed once in every seven minutes. By the use of  regulating shutters the air passes in a continuous current and the  fans are noiseless. The telegraph and telephone wires pass through the  tunnel, thus avoiding the long detour by Runcorn. Probably, as a feat  of engineering, the construction of the new station at Bold Street is  not inferior to any part of the scheme advanced. Under very singular  and perplexing difficulties it could only be proceeded with in its  first stages from midnight until six o'clock the following morning, it  being of course essential that the traffic at the Central Station  should not be interfered with. During these hours, night after night,  trenches were cut at intervals of 10 feet across the roadway  connecting the arrival platforms at the station, and into these were  placed strong balks of timber, across which planks were laid as a  temporary roadway. Beneath these planks, which were taken up and put  down as required, the rock was excavated to a depth of 9 feet, and the  balks supported upon stout props. Then from the driftway or rough  boring beneath well holes were bored to the upper excavation, and  through them the strong upright iron pillars designed to support the  roof of the new tunnel station were passed, bedded and securely fixed  in position. No sooner were they _in situ_ than the most troublesome  part of the task was entered upon, for the balks had then to be  removed in order to allow to be placed in position the girders running  the length of the new station, and resting on the tops of the upright  pillars. From these longitudinal girders cross girders of great  strength were placed, and between these were built brick arches,  packed above with concrete. This formed the roof of the new station.  One portion of it passed under the rails in the station above, and had  to be constructed without stoppage of the traffic. The rails had  consequently to be supported on a temporary steel bridge of ingenious  design, constructed by Mr. C.A. Rowlendson, the resident engineer and  manager of the company, under whose personal supervision, as  representing Sir Douglas Fox, the work has been carried out. With this  device the men were enabled to go on in safety although locomotives  were passing immediately above their heads. After the completion of  the roof the station below was excavated by what is technically called  \"plug and feather\" work--that is to say, by drilling holes into which  powerful wedges are driven to split the rock.           *       *       *       *       *          A STEAM STREET RAILWAY MOTOR.      [Illustration: North Chicago Street Railroad Engine]    While in Paris, President Yerkes, of the North Chicago Street Railway  Company, purchased a noiseless steam motor, the results in  experimenting with which will be watched with great interest. The  accompanying engraving, for which we are indebted to the _Street  Railway Review_, gives a very accurate idea of the general external  appearance. The car is all steel throughout, except windows, doors and  ceiling. It is 12 ft. long, 8 ft. wide, and 9 ft. high, and weighs  about seven tons. The engines, which have 25 horse power and are of  the double cylinder pattern, are below the floor and connected  directly to the wheels. The wheels are four in number and 31 in. in  diameter. The internal appearance and general arrangement of  machinery, etc., is about that of the ordinary steam dummy. It will  run in either direction, and the exhaust steam is run through a series  of mufflers which suppress the sound, condense the steam and return  the water to the boiler, which occupies the center of the car. The  motor was built in Ghent, Belgium, and cost about $5,000, custom house  duties amounting to about $2,000 more.--_The Railway Review_.           *       *       *       *       *          TWENTY-FOUR KNOT STEAMERS.      Probably the most important form of steam machinery is the marine  engine, not only because of the conditions under which it works, but  because of the great power it is called upon to exert. Naturally its  most interesting application is to Atlantic steaming. The success of  the four great liners, Teutonic, Majestic, City of Paris and City of  New York, has stimulated demand, and the Cunard Company has resolved  to add to its fleet, and place two ships on the Atlantic which will  outstrip the racers we have named.    The visitor to the late Naval Exhibition interested in shipping will  have remarked at each of the several exhibits of the great firms a  model of a projected steamer, intended to reduce the present record of  the six days' voyage across the Atlantic--the _ne plus ultra_ at this  time of steam navigation. To secure this present result a continuous  steaming for the six days at 20 knot speed is requisite, not to  mention an extra day or two at each end of the voyage. The City of  Paris and the City of New York, Furst Bismarck, Teutonic and Majestic  are capable of this, with the Umbria and Etruria close behind at 18 to  19 knots. Only ten years ago the average passage, reckoned in the same  way as from land to land--or Queenstown to Sandy Hook--was seven days  with a speed of 17 knots, the performance of such vessels as the  Arizona and Alaska. Twenty years ago the length of the voyage was  estimated as seven and a half to eight days at a speed of 16 knots,  the performance of such vessels as the Germanic and Britannic of the  White Star fleet of 5,000 tons and 5,000 horse power. Thirty years ago  the paddle steamer was not yet driven off the ocean, and we find the  Scotia crossing in between eight and nine days, at a speed of 13 or 14  knots. In 1858 ten and a half to twelve and a half days was allowed  for the passage between Liverpool and New York. So as we recede we  finally arrive at the pioneer vessels, the Sirius and Great Western,  crossing in fourteen to eighteen days at a speed of 6 to 8 knots. For  these historical details an interesting paper may be consulted, \"De  Toenemende Grootte der Zee-Stoombooten,\" 1888, by Professor A. Huet,  of the Delft Polytechnic School.    Each of the last two or three decades has thus succeeded, always,  however, with increasing difficulty, "]]]
