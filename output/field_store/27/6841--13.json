Over-exposure cannot  be corrected by using a cooler bath, as is the case with the black  prints, and the paper does not remain good so long.    The paper for the black prints by the hot bath process is washed with  a mixture of potassic platinous chloride and ferric oxalate, the  proportion being about sixty grains of the platinum salt to one ounce  of the iron solution. It will not keep good longer than twenty minutes  or so, and must be applied to the paper directly after mixing. The  ferric oxalate in the paper is reduced by the action of light to  ferrous oxalate, which forms the faint visible image; this, when the  paper is floated on the oxalate of potash bath, is capable of reducing  the platinum salt in contact with it into metallic platinum; but the  ferric salt, which remains unaltered, has no action on the platinum  salt, leaving these parts, which represent the high lights of the  print, untouched. The ferric oxalate is removed by the acid baths  which follow the development. A good temperature for development is  150 deg. Fahr., and when using this so much detail should not be apparent  as when printing for the cold bath process, in which all the detail  desired should be very faintly visible. There are, however, many  methods of exposing the paper and developing it, and no fixed rule can  be made, but the development must in every case be suited to the  exposure or the result will be a failure. For instance, the paper may  be printed until all detail is visible, but a very much cooler  development must be used, say 80 deg. or 90 deg.; on the other hand, a  slightly short exposure may be given, and a temperature of 180 deg. to  200 deg. used. 150 deg. should be taken as the normal temperature, and kept to  until some experience has been gained, as employing all temperatures  will lead to confusion, and nothing will be learned. Some negatives  require a special treatment, and both printing and development must be  altered, while for a very dense negative the paper may be left out in  a dampish room for some time. It will then print with less contrast  and more half tone. A thin negative is better printed by the cold bath  process, but negatives should be good and brilliant for platinotype  printing. Any one taking up platinotype and getting only weak prints  would do well to look to his negatives instead of blaming the paper,  as the high lights should be fairly dense, and the deep shadows nearly  clear glass.    Time for complete development should always be allowed; with a hot  bath fifteen seconds will be sufficient, but if a cooler development  is used, or the prints are solarized in the shadows, more time should  be allowed. When the deep shadows are solarized, or appear lighter  than surrounding parts, a hot and prolonged development is required to  obtain sufficient blackness, as they have a tendency to look like  brown paper. I have found breathing on solarized shadows useful, as in  the presence of slight moisture they begin to print out and become  dark before development, getting black almost directly the print is  floated on the oxalate. Three or four acid baths of about ten minutes  each are used, and the prints are washed as before. The process  throughout takes much less time than silver printing, and can be kept  on all the winter, when it is nearly impossible to print in silver.  Prints can be developed in weak daylight or gaslight, and prolonged  washing is dispensed with.--_N.P. Fox, reported in Br.

In the first part of this paper were described certain forms of  silver; among them a lilac blue substance, very soluble in water, with  a deep red color. After undergoing purification, it was shown to be  nearly pure silver. During the purification by washing it seemed to  change somewhat, and, consequently, some uncertainty existed as to  whether or not the purified substance was essentially the same as the  first product; it seemed possible that the extreme solubility of the  product in its first condition might be due to a combination in some  way with citric acid, the acid separating during the washing. Many  attempts were made to get a decisive indication, and two series of  analyses, one a long one, to determine the ratio between the silver  and the citric acid present, without obtaining a wholly satisfactory  result, inasmuch as even these determinations of mere ratio involved a  certain degree of previous purification which might have caused a  separation.    This question has since been settled in an extremely simple way, and  the fact established that the soluble blue substance contains not a  trace of combined citric acid.    The precipitated lilac blue substance (obtained by reducing silver  citrate by ferrous citrate) was thrown on a filter and cleared of  mother water as far as possible with a filter pump. Pure water was  then poured on in successive portions until more than half the  substance was dissolved. The residue, evidently quite unchanged, was,  of course, tolerably free from mother water. It was found that by  evaporating it to dryness over a water bath, most of the silver  separated out as bright white normal silver; by adding water and  evaporating a second time, the separation was complete, and water  added dissolved no silver. _The solution thus obtained was neutral._  It must have been acid had any citric acid been combined originally  with the silver. This experiment, repeated with every precaution,  seems conclusive. The ferrous solution, used for reducing the silver  citrate, had been brought to exact neutrality with sodium hydroxide.  After the reduction had been effected, the mother water over the lilac  blue precipitate was neutral or faintly acid.    A corroborating indication is the following: The portions of the lilac  blue substance which were dissolved on the filter (see above) were  received into a dilute solution of magnesium sulphate, which throws  down insoluble allotropic silver of the form I have called B (see  previous paper). This form has already been shown to be nearly pure  silver. The magnesia solution, neutral before use, was also neutral  after it had effected the precipitation, indicating that no citric  acid had been set free in the precipitation of the silver.    It seems, therefore, clear that the lilac blue substance contains no  combined citric acid. Had the solubility of the silver been due to  combination with either acid or alkali, the liquid from which it was  separated by digestion at or below 100 deg. C. must have been acid or  alkaline; it could not have been neutral.    We have, therefore, this alternative: In the lilac blue substance we  have either pure silver in a soluble form or else a compound of  silver, with a perfectly neutral substance generated from citric acid  in the reaction which leads to the formation of the lilac blue  substance. If this last should prove the true explanation, then we  have to do with a combination of silver of a quite different nature  from any silver compounds hitherto known. A neutral substance  generated from citric acid must have one or more atoms of hydrogen  replaced by silver. This possibility recalls the recent observations  of Ballo, who, by acting with a ferrous salt on tartaric acid,  obtained a neutral colloid substance having the constitution of  arabin, C6 H10 O6.    To appreciate the difficulty of arriving at a correct conclusion, it  must be remembered that the silver precipitate is obtained saturated  with strong solutions of ferric and ferrous citrate, sodium citrate,  sulphate, etc. These cannot be removed by washing with pure water, in  which the substance itself is very soluble, but must be got rid of by  washing with saline solutions, under the influence of which the  substance itself slowly but continually changes. Next, the saline  solution used for washing must be removed by alcohol. During this  treatment, the substance, at first very soluble, gradually loses its  solubility, and, when ready for analysis, has become wholly insoluble.  It is impossible at present to say whether it may not have undergone  other change; this is a matter as to which I hope to speak more  positively later. It is to be remarked, however, that these allotropic  forms of silver acquire and lose solubility from very slight causes,  as an instance of which may be mentioned the ease with which the  insoluble form B recovers its solubility under the influence of sodium  sulphate and borate, and other salts, as described in the previous  part of this paper.    The two insoluble forms of allotropic silver which I have described as  B and C--B, bluish green; C, rich golden color--show the following  curious reaction. A film of B, spread on glass and heated in a water  stove to 100 deg. C. for a few minutes becomes superficially bright  yellow. A similar film of the gold colored substance, C, treated in  the same way, acquires a blue bloom. In both cases it is the surface  only that changes.    _Sensitiveness to Light._--All these forms of silver are acted upon by  light. A and B acquire a brownish tinge by some hours' exposure to  sunlight. With C the case is quite different, the color changes from  that of red gold to that of pure yellow gold. The experiment is an  interesting one. The exposed portion retains its full metallic  brilliancy, giving an additional proof that the color depends upon  molecular arrangement, and this with the allotropic forms of silver is  subject to change from almost any influence.    _Stability._--These substances vary greatly in stability under  influences difficult to appreciate. I have two specimens of the gold  yellow substance, C, both made in December, 1886, with the same  proportions, under the same conditions. One has passed to dazzling  white, normal silver, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16983"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Íqán (#14)"],[1,"  manifest sorcery.'\"(81) Again He speaketh: \"If ever thou dost marvel,  marvellous surely is their saying, 'What! When we have become dust, shall  we be restored in a new creation?'\"(82) Thus, in another passage, He  wrathfully exclaimeth: \"Are We wearied out with the first creation? Yet  are they in doubt with regard to a new creation!\"(83)    As the commentators of the Qur'an and they that follow the letter thereof  misapprehended the inner meaning of the words of God and failed to grasp  their essential purpose, they sought to demonstrate that, according to the  rules of grammar, whenever the term \"idha\" (meaning \"if\" or \"when\")  precedeth the past tense, it invariably hath reference to the future.  Later, they were sore perplexed in attempting to explain those verses of  the Book wherein that term did not actually occur. Even as He hath  revealed: \"And there was a blast on the trumpet,--lo! it is the threatened  Day! And every soul is summoned to a reckoning,--with him an impeller and a  witness.\"(84) In explaining this and similar verses, they have in some  cases argued that the term \"idha\" is implied. In other instances, they  have idly contended that whereas the Day of Judgment is inevitable, it  hath therefore been referred to as an event not of the future but of the  past. How vain their sophistry! How grievous their blindness! They refuse  to recognize the trumpet-blast which so explicitly in this text was  sounded through the revelation of Muhammad. They deprive themselves of the  regenerating Spirit of God that breathed into it, and foolishly expect to  hear the trumpet-sound of the Seraph of God who is but one of His  servants! Hath not the Seraph himself, the angel of the Judgment Day, and  his like been ordained by Muhammad's own utterance? Say: What! Will ye  give that which is for your good in exchange for that which is evil?  Wretched is that which ye have falsely exchanged! Surely ye are a people,  evil, in grievous loss.    Nay, by \"trumpet\" is meant the trumpet-call of Muhammad's Revelation,  which was sounded in the heart of the universe, and by \"resurrection\" is  meant His own rise to proclaim the Cause of God. He bade the erring and  wayward arise and speed out of the sepulchres of their bodies, arrayed  them with the beauteous robe of faith, and quickened them with the breath  of a new and wondrous life. Thus at the hour when Muhammad, that divine  Beauty, purposed to unveil one of the mysteries hidden in the symbolic  terms \"resurrection,\" \"judgment,\" \"paradise,\" and \"hell,\" Gabriel, the  Voice of Inspiration, was heard saying: \"Erelong will they wag their heads  at Thee, and say, 'When shall this be?' Say: 'Perchance it is nigh.'\"(85)  The implications of this verse alone suffice the peoples of the world,  were they to ponder it in their hearts.    Gracious God! How far have that people strayed from the way of God!  Although the Day of Resurrection was ushered in through the Revelation of  Muhammad, although His light and tokens had encompassed the earth and all  that is therein, yet that people derided Him, gave themselves up to those  idols which the divines of that age, in their vain and idle fancy, had  conceived, and deprived themselves of the light of heavenly grace and of  the showers of divine mercy. Yea, the abject beetle can never scent the  fragrance of holiness, and the bat of darkness can never face the  splendour of the sun.    Such things have come to pass in the days of every Manifestation of God.  Even as Jesus said: \"Ye must be born again.\"(86) Again He saith: \"Except a  man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom  of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born  of the Spirit is spirit.\"(87) The purport of these words is that whosoever  in every dispensation is born of the Spirit and is quickened by the breath  of the Manifestation of Holiness, he verily is of those that have attained  unto \"life\" and \"resurrection\" and have entered into the \"paradise\" of the  love of God. And whosoever is not of them, is condemned to \"death\" and  \"deprivation,\" to the \"fire\" of unbelief, and to the \"wrath\" of God. In  all the scriptures, the books and chronicles, the sentence of death, of  fire, of blindness, of want of understanding and hearing, hath been  pronounced against those whose lips have tasted not the ethereal cup of  true knowledge, and whose hearts have been deprived of the grace of the  holy Spirit in their day. Even as it hath been previously recorded:  \"Hearts have they with which they understand not.\"(88)    In another passage of the Gospel it is written: \"And it came to pass that  on a certain day the father of one of the disciples of Jesus had died.\"  That disciple reporting the death of his father unto Jesus, asked for  leave to go and bury him. Whereupon, Jesus, that Essence of Detachment,  answered and said: \"Let the dead bury their dead.\"(89)    In like manner, two of the people of Kufih went to 'Ali, the Commander of  the Faithful. One owned a house and wished to sell it; the other was to be  the purchaser. They had agreed that this transaction should be effected  and the contract be written with the knowledge of 'Ali. He, the exponent  of the law of God, addressing the scribe, said: \"Write thou: 'A dead man  hath bought from another dead man a house. That house is bounded by four  limits. One extendeth toward the tomb, the other to the vault of the  grave, the third to the Sirat, the fourth to either Paradise or hell.'\"  Reflect, had these two souls been quickened by the trumpet-call of 'Ali,  had they risen from the grave of error by the power of his love, the  judgment of death would certainly not have been pronounced against them.    In every age and century, the purpose of the Prophets of God and their  chosen ones hath been no other but to affirm the spiritual significance of  the terms \"life,\" \"resurrection,\" and \"judgment.\" If one will ponder but  for a while this utterance of 'Ali in his heart, one will surely discover  all mysteries hidden in the terms \"grave,\" \"tomb,\" \"sirat,\" \"paradise\" and  \"hell.\" But oh! how strange and pitiful! Behold, all the people are  imprisoned within the tomb of self, and lie buried beneath the nethermost  depths of worldly desire! Wert thou to attain to but a dewdrop of the  crystal waters of divine knowledge, thou wouldst readily realize that true  life is not the life of the flesh but the life of the spirit. For the life  of the flesh is common to both men and animals, whereas the life of the  spirit is possessed only by the pure in heart who have quaffed from the  ocean of faith and partaken of the fruit of certitude. This life knoweth  no death, and this existence is crowned by immortality. Even as it hath  been said: \"He who is a true believer liveth both in this world and in the  world to come.\"    If by \"life\" be meant this earthly life, it is evident that death must  needs overtake it.    Similarly, the records of all the scriptures bear witness to this lofty  truth and this most exalted word. Moreover, this verse of the Qur'an,  revealed concerning Hamzih, the \"Prince of Martyrs,\"(90) and Abu-Jahl, is  a luminous evidence and sure testimony of the truth of Our saying: \"Shall  the dead, whom We have quickened, and for whom We have ordained a light  whereby he may walk among men, be like him, whose likeness is in the  darkness, whence he will not come forth?\"(91) This verse descended from  the heaven of the Primal Will at a time when Hamzih had already been  invested with the sacred mantle of faith, and Abu-Jahl had waxed  relentless in his opposition and unbelief. From the Wellspring of  omnipotence and the Source of eternal holiness, there came the judgment  that conferred everlasting life upon Hamzih, and condemned Abu-Jahl to  eternal damnation. This was the signal that caused the fires of unbelief  to glow with the hottest flame in the heart of the infidels, and provoked  them openly to repudiate His truth. They loudly clamoured: \"When did  Hamzih die? When was he risen? At what hour was such a life conferred upon  him?\" As they understood not the significance of these noble sayings, nor  sought enlightenment from the recognized expounders of the Faith, that  these might confer a sprinkling of the Kawthar of divine knowledge upon  them, therefore such fires of mischief were kindled amongst men.    Thou dost witness today how, notwithstanding the radiant splendour of the  Sun of divine knowledge, all the people, whether high or low, have clung  to the ways of those abject manifestations of the Prince of Darkness. They  continually appeal to them for aid in unraveling the intricacies of their  Faith, and, owing to lack of knowledge, they make such replies as can in  no wise damage their fame and fortune. It is evident that these souls,  vile and miserable as the beetle itself, have had no portion of the  musk-laden breeze of eternity, and have never entered the Ridvan of  heavenly delight. How, therefore, can they impart unto others the  imperishable fragrance of holiness? Such is their way, and such will it  remain for ever. Only those will attain to the knowledge of the Word of  God that have turned unto Him, and repudiated the manifestations of Satan.  Thus God hath reaffirmed the law of the day of His Revelation, and  inscribed it with the pen of power upon the mystic Tablet hidden beneath  the veil of celestial glory. Wert thou to heed these words, wert thou to  ponder their outward and inner meaning in thy heart, thou wouldst seize  the significance of all the abstruse problems which, in this day, have  become insuperable barriers between men and the knowledge of the Day of  Judgment. Then wilt thou have no more questions to perplex thee. We fain  would hope that, God willing, thou wilt not return, deprived and still  athirst, from the shores of the ocean of divine mercy, nor come back  destitute from the imperishable Sanctuary of thy heart's"]]]
