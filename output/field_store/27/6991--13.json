What was passing in Hamilton's mind was not to be gathered from his  countenance, which exhibited no emotion of any kind. He turned to  Trevannion, as their party was strengthened by Churchill, remarking,  \"Here comes the sucking fish.\"    \"It's _uncommon_ hot,\" said Churchill, taking off his hat, and fanning  himself with his handkerchief.    \"_Dreadful_ warm,\" said Frank Digby, in exactly the same tone.    \"And there is not a breath of wind on the horrid downs,\" continued the  sapient youth, perfectly unconscious of Frank's mimicry.    \"What will the fair Louisa do?\" cried Frank: \"O that a zephyr would  have pity on that delicate form!\"    Across their path lay a wagon, from which the horses had been detached,  and which now offered a tempting though homely shelter to those among  the pedestrians who might choose to sit on the shady side, or to avail  themselves of the accommodation afforded by the awning over the interior.  Ferrers threw himself full length inside the cart: and Louis, drawing  Alfred to the shady side, seated himself by him on the grass. His example  was followed by Churchill, who exclaimed rapturously as he did so, \"How  nice! This puts me in mind of a Latin sentence; I forget the Latin, but  I remember the English--'Oh, 'tis pleasant to sit in the shade!'\"    \"Of a wagon,\" said Frank, laughing. \"Remarkably romantic! It is so  sweet to hear the birds chirp, and the distant hum of human voices--but  language fails! As for Lady Louisa, she is in the Elysium of ecstasy.  It's _so_ romantic.\"    \"Are you going to Bristol, Frank, for I'm off?\" said Hamilton.    \"Coming,\" replied Frank. \"We'll leave these romantic mortals to their  sequestered glen. There ain't nothing like imagination, my good sirs.\"    As he joined his companions, Trevannion remarked to Hamilton, \"Little  Mortimer is so much the gentleman, you never know him do or say any  thing vulgar or awkward. It is a pity one can't depend upon him.\"    \"I am not quite sure that you cannot,\" replied Hamilton.    \"How!\" said Trevannion, in astonishment.    \"Are you going to turn Paladin for her ladyship?\" asked Frank.    \"I have been watching Louis very carefully, and the more I see,  the more I doubt his guilt,\" replied Hamilton.    \"After what you saw yourself? After all that was seen by others?  Impossible, my dear Hamilton!\" exclaimed Trevannion. \"You cannot  exonerate him without criminating others.\"    \"We shall see,\" replied Hamilton; \"and more than that, Trevannion,  I am certain that Dr. Wilkinson has his doubts now, too.\"    \"But does Fudge know any thing about his old pranks?\" asked Frank,  incredulously.    \"I cannot say,\" replied Hamilton; \"but I think that he probably does;  for what is so well known now among ourselves, is likely enough to reach  his quick ears.\"    \"But knowing all you do, my dear Hamilton,\" said Trevannion,  expostulatingly, \"you must be strongly prejudiced in your protege's  favor to admit a doubt in this case. Has Dr. Wilkinson told you that  he has any doubts?\"    \"No,\" replied Hamilton; \"you know the doctor would not reveal his mind  unless he were confident, but I have noticed some little things, and am  sure that though he seems generally so indifferent to Louis' presence  and concerns, and so distant and cold towards him, he's nevertheless  watching him very narrowly; and I, for my part, expect to see things  take a new turn before long.\"    \"The boy seems quite to have won your heart,\" said Trevannion.    \"Poor fellow,\" replied Hamilton, smiling. \"He is a sweet-tempered,  gentle boy; a little too anxious to be well thought of, and has,  perhaps, too little _moral courage_. I own he has interested me.  His very timidity and his numerous scrapes called forth pity in the  first instance, and then I saw more. I should not have been surprised  at his telling a lie in the first place, but I do not think he would  persist in it.\"    \"I'm afraid wisdom's at fault,\" said Frank, shaking his head:  \"you would not say that Ferrers helped him?--I mean took the key  to get him into a scrape.\"    \"I accused no one, Digby,\" replied Hamilton, in a reserved tone;  \"nor am I going to wrong any one by uttering unformed suspicions.\"    \"Enough has been said,\" remarked Trevannion; \"let us drop the subject,  and talk of something more interesting to all parties.\"    While these young gentlemen pursue their walk, we will retrace our  steps to the wagon, where Louis and his little friend have taken  shelter.    Churchill, finding neither seemed very much inclined to encourage his  conversational powers, took himself off, after remaining in the shade  long enough to cool himself. After his departure Louis and Alfred talked  lazily on of their own pleasant thoughts and schemes, both delighted at  being once more in each other's society. They were within sight of the  masters out on the downs, and who had forbidden them to wander beyond  certain limits, but still so far from their school-fellows as to be able  to enjoy their own private conversation unmolested, and in the feeling  of seclusion.    At length, after a pause, Louis made an original remark on the beauty  of the weather, which was immediately responded to by his companion,  who added that he had not known such a fine day since Miss Wilkinson's  wedding.    \"Don't you think so?\" said Louis; \"I think we had one or two Sundays  quite as fine.\"    \"Perhaps I thought that day so very fine, because I wanted to go out,\"  said Alfred.    \"What do you mean?\" asked Louis: \"we had a holiday then.\"    \"Yes, I know, but I was not allowed to go out because I had been idle,  and had spoken improperly to Mr. Norton. I remember it was so sad. I  assure you, Louis, I cried nearly all day; for I was shut up in your  class-room, and I heard all the boys so merry outside. The very thought  makes me quite sorrowful now.\"    A thought flashed across Louis' mind, and he asked quickly--    \"Were you shut up in our class-room that holiday, Alfred? I never saw  you when I went in.\"    \"But I saw you once,\" said Alfred, \"when you came in for an atlas;  and I saw Mr. Ferrers, and afterwards Edward and Mr. Salisbury and  Mr. Trevannion come in; but I was ashamed, and I did not want any  one to see me, so I hid myself between the book-case and the wall.\"    \"Did your brother know you were there?\" asked Louis.    \"Not _there_,\" replied Alfred. \"He thought I was to go into  Dr. Wilkinson's study; but I could not go there, and I didn't  want him to speak to me.\"    \"Did Ferrers come to fetch any thing, Alfred?\"    Alfred laughed. \"It won't be telling tales out of school to tell you,  Louis. He came for a key to the first-class exercise book.\"    \"How do you know it was a first-class exercise book, Alfred?\"  asked Louis, with a glowing face and beating heart.    \"I know Edward does Kenrick's Latin Exercises, and I know the key  because it's just like the book, and I have seen Mr. Ferrers with  it before. I remember once on a half-holiday he did his lessons in  the school-room at my desk, and he had it open in the desk, and as  I wanted something out. I saw it, though he did not think I did.\"    \"Oh Alfred, Alfred!\" cried Louis, clasping him very tightly. \"Oh Alfred!  _dear_ Alfred!\"    The child looked up in astonishment, but Louis was so wild with  excitement that he could not say any more.    Just at that moment there was an abrupt movement in the wagon,  and Ferrers' head was put over the side.    Alfred uttered an exclamation of fear. \"Oh, there's Mr. Ferrers!\"    \"What rubbish have you been talking, you little impostor?\" cried Ferrers.  \"How dare you talk in such a manner? I've a great mind to kick you from  Land's End to John o' Groat's house.\"    [Illustration: Ferrers begins to be found out.]    \"Ferrers, you know it's all true,\" said Louis.    Ferrers' face was white with passion and anxiety. \"Get along with  you, Alfred, you'd better not let me hear any more of your lies, I  can tell you.\"    \"If you had not been listening you would not have heard,\" replied Alfred,  taking care to stand out of Ferrers' reach. \"Listeners never hear any  good of themselves, Mr. Ferrers: you know it's all true, and if I'd  told Edward, you wouldn't have liked it.\"    \"Alfred dear, don't say so much,\" said Louis.    Alfred here set off running, as Ferrers had dismounted in a very  threatening attitude, but instead of giving chase to the daring  fugitive, the conscience-stricken youth drew near Louis, who was  standing in a state of such delight that he must be excused a little  if no thought of his school-fellow's disgrace marred it at present.  A glance at the changed and terror-stricken countenance of that  school-fellow checked the exuberance of Louis' joy, for he was too  sympathizing not to feel for him, and he said in a gentle tone,    \"I am very sorry for you, Ferrers,--you have heard all that Alfred  has said.\"    \"Louis Mortimer!\" exclaimed Ferrers, in agony; and Louis was half  alarmed by the wild despair of his manner, and the vehemence with  which he seized his arm. \"Louis Mortimer--it is all true--but what  shall I do?\"    Louis was so startled that he could not answer at first: at last  he replied,    \"Go and tell the doctor yourself--that will be much the best way.\"    \"Listen to me a moment--just listen a moment--as soon as Dr. Wilkinson  knows it, I shall be expelled, and I shall be ruined for life. What I  have suffered, Louis! Oh--you see how it was; I dared not tell about  it--how can I hope you can forgive me?\"    \"I think you must have seen that I forgave you long ago,\" replied  Louis; \"I wish I could do any thing for you, Ferrers, but you cannot  expect me to bear the blame of this any longer. I think if you tell  it to the doctor yourself, he will, perhaps,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19856"],[0,"A Study of Pueblo Architecture: Tusayan and Cibola (#14)"],[1,"data for a  suggestion of a ground plan or of the area covered.      [Illustration: Plate XVIII. Plan of Sichumovi.]      [Illustration: Fig. 2. Ruins, Old Walpi mound.]    OLD MASHONGNAVI.    In the case of Mashongnavi we have somewhat more abundant material. It  will be desirable to quote a few lines of narrative from the account of  a Mashongnavi Indian of the name of Nuvayauma, as indicating the causes  that led to the occupation of the site illustrated.      We turned and came to the north, meeting the Apache and \"Beaver    Indians,\" with whom we had many battles, and being few we were    defeated, after which we came up to Mashongnavi [the ruin at the    \"Giant's Chair\"] and gave that rock its name [name not known], and    built our houses there. The Apache came upon us again, with the    Comanche, and then we came to [Old Mashóngnavi]. We lived there in    peace many years, having great success with crops, and our people    increased in numbers, and the Apache came in great numbers and set    fire to the houses and burned our corn, which you will find to-day    there burnt and charred. After they had destroyed our dwellings we    came upon the mesa, and have lived here since.    The ruins referred to as having been the first occupied by the  Mashongnavi at a large isolated rock known as the \"Giant's Chair,\" have  not been examined. The later village from which they were driven by the  attacks of the Apache to their present site has been surveyed. The plan  of the fallen walls and lines of débris by which the form of much of the  old pueblo can still be traced is given in Pl. II. The plan of the best  preserved portion of the pueblo towards the north end of the sheet  clearly indicates a general adherence to the inclosed court arrangement  with about the same degree of irregularity that characterizes the modern  village. Besides the clearly traceable portions of the ruin that bear  such resemblance to the present village in arrangement, several small  groups and clusters appear to have been scattered along the slope of the  foothills, but in their present state of destruction it is not clear  whether these clusters were directly connected with the principal group,  or formed part of another village. Occasional traces of foundation walls  strongly suggest such connection, although from the character of the  site this intervening space could hardly have been closely built over.  With the exception of the main cluster above described the houses occupy  very broken and irregular sites. As indicated on the plan, the slope is  broken by huge irregular masses of sandstone protruding from the soil,  while much of the surface is covered by scattered fragments that have  fallen from neighboring pinnacles and ledges. The contours indicate the  general character of the slopes over which these irregular features are  disposed. The fragment of ledge shown on the north end of the plate,  against which a part of the main cluster has been built, is a portion of  a broad massive ledge of sandstone that supports the low buttes upon  which the present villages of Mashongnavi and Shupaúlovi are built, and  continues as a broad, level shelf of solid rock for several miles along  the mesa promontory. Its continuation on the side opposite that shown in  the plate may be seen in the general view of Shupaulovi (Pl. XXXI).    SHITAIMUVI.    The vestiges of another ruined village, known as Shitaimuvi, are found  in the vicinity of Mashongnavi, occupying and covering the crown of a  rounded foothill on the southeast side of the mesa. No plan of this ruin  could be obtained on account of the complete destruction of the walls.  No line of foundation stones even could be found, although the whole  area is more or less covered with the scattered stones of former  masonry. An exceptional quantity of pottery fragments is also strewn  over the surface. These bear a close resemblance to the fine class of  ware characteristic of \"Talla Hogan\" or \"Awatubi,\" and would suggest  that this pueblo was contemporaneous with the latter. Some reference to  this ruin win be found in the traditionary material in Chapter I.      [Illustration: Plate XIX. View of Sichumovi.]    AWATUBI.    The ruin of Awatubi is known to the Navajo as Talla Hogan, a term  interpreted as meaning \"singing house\" and thought to refer to the  chapel and mission that at one time nourished here, as described by Mr.  Stephen in Chapter I. Tradition ascribes great importance to this  village. At the time of the Spanish conquest it was one of the most  prosperous of the seven \"cities\" of Tusayan, and was selected as the  site of a mission, a distinction shared by Walpi, which was then on a  lower spur of the first mesa, and by Shumopavi, which also was built on  a lower site than the present village of that name. Traditions referring  to this pueblo have been collected from several sources and, while  varying somewhat in less important details, they all concur in bringing  the destruction of the village well within the period of Spanish  occupation.    On the historical site, too, we know that Cruzate on the occasion of the  attempted reconquest of the country visited this village in 1692, and  the ruin must therefore be less than two centuries old, yet the  completeness of destruction is such that over most of its area no  standing wall is seen, and the outlines of the houses and groups are  indicated mainly by low ridges and masses of broken-down masonry, partly  covered by the drifting sands. The group of rooms that forms the south  east side of the pueblo is an exception to the general rule. Here  fragmentary walls of rough masonry stand to a height, in some cases, of  8 feet above the débris. The character of the stonework, as may be seen  from Pl. V, is but little better than that of the modern villages. This  better preserved portion of the village seems to have formed part of a  cluster of mission buildings. At the points designated A on the ground  plan may be seen the remnants of walls that have been built of straw  adobe in the typical Spanish manner. These rest upon foundations of  stone masonry. See Pl. VI. The adobe fragments are probably part of the  church or associated buildings. At two other points on the ground plan,  both on the northeast side, low fragments of wall are still standing, as  may be seen from the plate. At one of these points the remains indicate  that the village was provided with a gateway near the middle of the  northeast side.    The general plan of this pueblo is quite different from that of the  present villages, and approaches the older types in symmetry and  compactness. There is a notable absence of the arrangement of rooms into  long parallel rows. This typical Tusayan feature is only slightly  approximated in some subordinate rows within the court. The plan  suggests that the original pueblo was built about three sides of a  rectangular court, the fourth or southeast side--later occupied by the  mission buildings--being left open, or protected only by a low wall.  Outside the rectangle of the main pueblo, on the northeast side, are two  fragments of rude masonry, built by Navajo sheep herders. Near the west  corner of the pueblo are the vestiges of two rooms, outside the pueblo  proper, which seem to belong to the original construction.    Awatubi is said to have had excavated rectangular kivas, situated in the  open court, similar to those used in the modern village. The people of  Walpi had partly cleared out one of these chambers and used it as a  depository for ceremonial plume-sticks, etc., but the Navajo came and  carried off their sacred deposits, tempted probably by their market  value as ethnologic specimens. No trace of these kivas was visible at  the time the ruins were surveyed.    The Awatubi are said to have had sheep at the time the village was  destroyed. Some of the Tusayan point out the remains of a large sheep  corral near the spring, which they say was used at that time, but it is  quite as likely to have been constructed for that purpose at a much  later date.    HORN HOUSE.    The Horn House is so called because tradition connects this village with  some of the people of the Horn phratry of the Hopituh or Tusayan. The  ruin is situated on a projecting point of the mesa that forms the  western flank of Jeditoh Valley, not far from where the Holbrook road to  Keam's Canyon ascends the brink of the mesa. The village is almost  completely demolished, no fragment of standing wall remaining in place.  Its general plan and distribution are quite clearly indicated by the  usual low ridges of fallen masonry partly covered by drifted sand. There  is but little loose stone scattered about, the sand having filled in all  the smaller irregularities.    It will be seen from the plan, Pl. VII, that the village has been built  close to the edge of the mesa, following to some extent the  irregularities of its outline. The mesa ruin at this point, however, is  not very high, the more abrupt portion having a height of 20 or 30 feet.  Near the north end of the village the ground slopes very sharply toward  the east and is rather thickly covered with the small stones of fallen  masonry, though but faint vestiges of rooms remain. In plan the ruin is  quite elongated, following the direction of the mesa. The houses were  quite irregularly disposed, particularly in the northern portion of the  ruin. But here the indications are too vague to determine whether the  houses were originally built about one long court or about two or more  smaller ones. The south end of the pueblo, however, still shows a well  defined court bounded on all sides by clearly traceable rooms. At the  extreme south end of the ruin the houses have very irregular outlines,  a result of their adaptation to the topography, as may be seen in the  illustration.      [Illustration: Plate XX.
