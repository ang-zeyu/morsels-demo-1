[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18297"],[0,"The Story of a Summer (#14)"],[1," struck with  the true ring of poesy so apparent in it.      _June 30_.    Upon returning from church yesterday, we found the front door standing  open, a couple of arm-chairs upon the piazza, and a newspaper or two in  lieu of the occupants--proof unmistakable of a masculine invasion.  Who  it was we could not imagine; that it was not a neighbor we were  convinced by seeing the morning _Herald_ and _Times_, for the Sunday  papers cannot be obtained here, save by being at the depot when the  interminable way-train comes up from New York, and waylaying the  newsboy who accompanies the cars; and for this our neighbors are rarely  sufficiently enterprising.  Unmistakably our visitors had come from the  city.    Upon questioning Minna, she gave us a graphic description of the  gentlemen.  One was \"tall, oh so tall! with dark hair and red  cheeks\"--in him we recognized Mr. Walworth Ward--the other was a blonde  gentleman whom she had seen here before.    \"Lina has already made wine _padding_,\" she said, seeing Ida about to  descend and inspect the larder.  \"Miss no fret--all right.\"    Ida and I then started to walk to the grove, where we thought we would  probably find our guests awaiting our return.  Not there, indeed, but  in the vegetable garden we found them, where they were kindly looking  after the interests of the family by weeding the strawberry-beds,  regardless of the Sabbath, and notwithstanding one of the gentlemen was  a grandson of a D.D.  In answer to our regrets that we should have been  absent when they arrived, they mildly intimated some surprise, one  having telegraphed his proposed coming, and the other sent a message  through papa the day previous; dear papa, however, had as usual  forgotten to deliver the message, and whither the telegram went, no one  could imagine.      _July 1_.    A visit yesterday from the little colored sculptress, Edmonia Lewis.  Miss Lewis was accompanied by a box of formidable size, containing, she  told us, a marble bust of Mr. Greeley, which she had brought out here  for the opinion of the family; but as Ida was in the city where she had  gone for a day's shopping, we reserved our judgment until she should  return and see it with us.    I was very glad to learn that Miss Lewis was prospering in both a  pecuniary and an artistic point of view.  She had, she told me,  received two orders for busts of uncle--one from the Lincoln Club, and  one from a Chicago gentleman.  She intends returning to Rome before  long.    Miss Lewis had already opened a studio while we were in Rome four or  five years ago, and I heard much talk about her from her brother and  sister artists.  I intended at one time to visit her studio and see her  work, but several sculptors advised me not to do so; she was, they  declared, \"queer,\" \"unsociable,\" often positively rude to her visitors,  and had been heard to fervently wish that the Americans would not come  to her studio, as they evidently looked upon her only as a curiosity.  When, therefore, I did see her for the first time (last summer), I was  much surprised to find her by no means the morose being that had been  described to me, but possessed of very soft and quite winning manners.  She was amused when I told her what I had heard of her, and remarked,  quite pertinently:    \"How could I expect to sell my work if I did not receive visitors  civilly?\"    Miss Lewis expressed much gratitude to Miss Hosmer and Miss Stebbins  for their kindness to her in Rome, and of Miss Cushman she said  enthusiastically, \"She is an angel!\"    She is, I have been told, very well received in society abroad, and  when baptized a Catholic in Rome, two ladies of high position, Countess  Cholmondeley and Princess Wittgenstein, offered to stand godmother for  her.  Edmonia chose Lady Cholmondeley, whom I remember well in Rome as  a great belle and a highly accomplished woman.  She wrote poetry, I was  told, and modelled in clay with much taste, and her finely trained  voice and dainty playing of the harp I well remember as one of the  attractions of Miss Cushman's receptions.    Edmonia has, beside her somewhat hard English appellation, two pretty  baptismal names--Maria Ignatia.          CHAPTER X.    Cataloguing the Library--A Thousand Volumes--Contrasting Books--Some  Rare Volumes--Mr. Greeley's Collection of Paintings--Authenticity of  the Cenci Questioned--A Portrait of Galileo--Portrait of Martin  Luther--Portrait of Greeley at Thirty--Powers' Proserpine--Hart's Bust  of Mr. Greeley--Mosaics and Medallions.      _July 2_.    This morning we have had a family picnic at the side-hill house, where  the amusement was, however, neither \"Twenty Questions,\" gossip, nor  croquet; but arranging and cataloguing uncle's large library.  The  books had hitherto been kept in the house in the woods, with the  exception of those in daily use, filling three good-sized bookcases in  our present residence; but as the house in the woods had been twice  broken into last winter, Ida thought it safer to move them all down  this summer to the side-hill house, where Bernard sleeps.  Accordingly,  a wagon-load or two was brought down the other day and deposited in the  dining-room, and this morning, as we had no guests, and no very  pressing occupations, we all, including Minna, went up there directly  after breakfast to look them over.    \"I am resolved,\" Ida had said, \"to have the books catalogued, that I  may know in future how many I yearly lose by lending them to my  friends.\"  Consequently the work was doubled by the necessity of  writing down the names, and we had unluckily chosen the hottest day  that we had so far experienced for this laborious task.  We all went to  work, however, with as much energy as though the temperature was at a  reasonable degree, and I felt quite proud of my achievements when the  work was done, having catalogued, myself, over three hundred volumes.    Our work was divided: mamma read off the names of the books, and  Marguerite and I wrote them down, and Minna then dusted and carried  them into the next room to Ida, who placed them upon the shelves,  dividing the library into compartments for poetry, biography, science,  fiction, etc.  An endless task it seemed at first to sort the books,  for more than one thousand volumes of all sizes and in every variety of  binding from cloth to calf, had been thrown promiscuously on the floor,  and the hottest antagonists in the political and religious world were  now lying side by side in the apparent enjoyment of peace and  good-will.  \"Slavery Doomed\" and \"Slavery Justified\" composed one  externally harmonious group, while \"Footfalls on the Boundary of  Another World,\" \"How I became a Unitarian,\" and Strauss' \"Life of  Jesus,\" lay beside their rigidly orthodox neighbors, the \"Following of  Christ,\" by Thomas a Kempis, Cardinal Wiseman's \"Doctrines of the  Church,\" and a Jesuit Father's idea of the Happiness of Heaven.    Uncle's fondness for his country home was manifested by thirty or more  large volumes upon Agriculture, and several others upon Rural  Architecture, while his literary and aesthetic taste was displayed by a  superb edition of Macaulay, in eight octavo volumes, combining the  whitest of paper and the largest and clearest type, with richest  binding; Lord Derby's translation of the Iliad, Mackay's \"Thousand and  One Gems,\" a large and elegant volume of Byron's complete works, and  Bryant's \"Library of Poetry and Song\"--the two latter beautifully bound  and illustrated.  Xenophon, Herodotus, Josephus, and Caesar lay off at  an aristocratic distance from their neighbors, and looked down with  scorn upon anything so modern as Noel's \"Rebellion,\" or Draper's \"Civil  War in America;\" while memories of the buried \"Brook Farm\" arose from  the past as mamma took up a volume or two upon Co-operative  Associations.    Uncle's strict temperance principles were illustrated by half a dozen  volumes upon the \"Effects of Alcohol,\" including \"Scriptural Testimony  against Wine;\" and a work or two upon the Tariff Question recalled many  a _Tribune_ editorial penned by the dear, dead hand.    A large dark pile of some twenty volumes loomed up from a distant  corner--Appleton's useful Cyclopaedia--and beside them lay an enormous  Webster's Dictionary, handsomely put up in a chocolate-colored library  binding.    Many elegantly bound volumes were presentation copies from their  authors--among them a magnificent album of languages, beautifully  illuminated, and bound in scarlet morocco, containing the Lord's Prayer  in one hundred different tongues.  This book sold, Ida said, for one  hundred dollars a copy.    In striking contrast with this gorgeous volume were two little  yellow-leaved, shabbily bound books, valued, however, at one hundred  dollars each, and treasures which no money could have bought from  uncle--one a copy of Erasmus, dated Basle, 1528, and the other \"The  tvvoo Bookes of Francis Bacon on the Proficience and Aduancement of  Learning, diuine and humane,\" printed, the fly-leaf states, at London,  in 1605.      _July 3_.    I have not yet, I believe, spoken of more than one or two of the  pictures that uncle bought while in Europe the first time.  He then  spent ten thousand dollars on paintings, a piece or two of sculpture,  and a few little curiosities of art in the way of mosaics and  antiquities from different ruins of Italy, which, for a man who was by  no means a Stewart or an Astor, showed great liberality.  Uncle could  not afford, like ostentatious millionnaires, to dazzle the public with  paintings bought by the yard; but for a man of his means he displayed,  I think, a true love for art and a strong desire to encourage it.  His  purchases, too, were very different from the second-rate pictures so  often purchased abroad by uncultivated eyes, for instead of depending  merely upon his own judgment, he asked the assistance of the sculptor  Story in choosing his souvenirs; and his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18298"],[0,"Essays in Natural History and Agriculture (#14)"],[1,"or a bullock, and to his first cost add the  rent of the land on which he has pastured, and something for  insurance and interest on capital, the transaction is not a very  profitable one in the long run. But in the case of the Salmon, we  send a little fish down to the sea which is not worth a penny, and  he remains there, paying neither rent nor taxes, neither  gamekeepers' nor bailiffs' wages, costing nothing to anyone, until  he returns to the river, worth ten or twenty shillings, as the  case may be. Surely this is a branch of the public wealth that  deserves sedulous cultivation.    I think with you that the Calder can never become a Salmon river,  so long as manufactories flourish on its banks, and it is not  desirable that it ever should become so at their expense; but even  in the Calder (and its tributaries) a little care would prevent  immense mischief. Some people at Church, a few years ago, very  carelessly pushed a quantity of poisonous matter into the Hyndburn  brook, and the first thunderstorm that followed carried it down  the Calder into the Ribble, and poisoned all the fish between  Calder foot and Ribchester. Take another instance of carelessness  in the Ribble, the emptying of the gas-holder tank at Settle,  which when turned into the river killed nearly all the fish  between that town and Mitton. Several other instances occur to me,  but these two are sufficient to show the great mischief occasioned  by avoidable neglect and carelessness. Such mischief should not be  perpetrated with impunity.    The act of 1861 was very good as far as it went, notwithstanding  some oversights; but it did not go far enough. It did not give to  the upper riparian proprietors such an interest in the fish as  they are entitled to, nor is the interest they now have sufficient  to induce them to exert themselves in the preservation and  increase of the Salmon as they might and would do if such  additional stimulus were given to them. The law now is, that no  nets shall be used in the taking of Salmon between twelve o'clock  at noon on Saturdays, and six o'clock on Monday mornings. That is,  forty-two hours per week. But in the Ribble, as a rule, we never  see seasonable Salmon until May. Now from that time to the 1st of  September, is, say sixteen weeks, and at forty-two hours per week  (the length of the weekly close time) this gives twenty-eight days  during which time the fish may pass up the river without  interruption; but this is by no means the true state of the case.  Everyone conversant with the habits of Salmon knows that they  never ascend rivers except when they are in a state of flood; and  in average summers, partly owing to droughts, and partly to the  rapid evaporation and absorption of moisture by vegetation, these  twenty-eight days may fairly be reduced by two-thirds, to give the  true time allowed for the ascent of the fish. But say ten days,  which are supposed to give an adequate supply of fish to a hundred  miles of river,--the extent of the Ribble and its Salmon-breeding  tributaries. Is it surprising that the upper proprietors are not  satisfied with this state of things? It would be surprising if  they were content with such a cheeseparing allowance.    When the bill of 1861 was before the House of Commons, I had an  opportunity (indirectly) of suggesting to the late Sir George  Cornewall Lewis the propriety of a considerable extension of the  weekly close time. He replied, \"You might as well propose to shoot  partridges only three days a week, as to restrict the netting of  Salmon to only three days.\" With all due deference to such an  authority, there is no analogy between the two cases. But if  partridges had all to migrate and return before they could be  legally shot, and had, like Salmon, to come by one road, and if,  like them, ninety per cent. of them became the prey of men who had  neither bred nor fed them, I fancy the sportsman who reared them  would want some restrictions placed on their being shot by men who  had not spent a farthing in breeding and protecting them, but who  took the lion's share in their appropriation.    I saw Lord Derby on the subject last spring. He had, however, so  little time at his disposal that he could only give me a few  minutes. He said a good deal must be allowed for vested interests.  I said, \"My Lord, I am a manufacturer. When the Ten Hours Bill was  passed, manufacturers were deprived of one-sixth of their fixed  capital at a stroke, and had not a farthing allowed for their  vested interests; nay, more, that measure involved the destruction  of machinery which had cost millions. All this was done on grounds  of public policy. And is not the Salmon question one of public  policy? If, as I suppose, the measure I advocate produced a great  increase in the breed of Salmon, the estuary fisheries would be  the first to profit by it. They are the first on the river.  Indeed, the stake nets in the estuaries are taking fish daily in  times of drought, when fish will not ascend the river at all.\"    In 1859 we had not a fresh in the river between the 10th of April  and the 1st of August. And last year we had only a few days of  flood between the beginning of May and the 31st August, when close  time (for nets) commences.    I have said above that only ten days per year are allowed for the  supply of fish to the upper proprietors. I may be told that they  have two months (September and October) in which they are allowed  to angle for them. True, but what are they worth? They are not  allowed to be sold, they are not fit to eat, the fish are black  (or red), the milt and spawn nearly at maturity, and the only  temptation they offer is to the poacher (who often pots the roe as  a bait for Trout); and he is a poacher, whatever his rank or  station, who will kill an October fish when full of spawn.    Last year, at my suggestion, a meeting of gentlemen interested in  Salmon fisheries was convened at Worcester, during the meeting  there of the Royal Agricultural Society, and a number of  suggestions were made, and resolutions were come to, which were  intended to serve as a basis for the desired alterations in the  Salmon Bill of 1861. I have no memoranda to which I can now refer,  but the most important, according to my recollection, were the  following:--The extension of the weekly close time; the annual  close time to be extended to Trout; a right to be given to all  conservators and water-bailiffs, duly appointed, to pass along the  banks of Salmon rivers without being deemed guilty of trespass; a  tax on fishing-nets, rods, and implements, to defray the expenses  of protecting the rivers from poachers.    The Commissioner of Salmon Fisheries, Mr. Eden, has been convening  meetings of gentlemen interested in Salmon rivers at Chester,  Conway, York, and various other places, to explain the provisions  of the bill which Government introduced at the end of last session  and intend to bring forward again. I have not attended any of  these meetings, but expect he will be at Whalley or Preston  shortly, when we shall hear what he has got to say. The new bill,  as printed last year, does not embody any of the suggestions of  the Worcester meeting; but as I learn from private sources, Mr.  Eden, at the various meetings he has lately attended, has thrown  out various suggestions, some of which are highly objectionable.    For instance, he suggests that the magistrates in quarter sessions  assembled shall have the power to appoint conservators, and that  the conservators shall have the power to expend all the money  raised by subscription in having water-bailiffs to put up fish-  ladders, commencing actions at law in certain cases; and if the  subscriptions are not adequate to defray all these expenses, that  they (the conservators) shall have the power to levy a rate in aid  on the riparian proprietors.    I cannot see how this can be made to work equitably. If the rate  be laid on the extent of frontage to the river, one man may have a  great extent of no value for fishing purposes, another may have  only one pool, so conveniently formed and placed for netting that  he will be able to catch ten times as many fish as the other. Then  how are the fisheries in the estuary and just above tideway to be  valued? They probably take ninety per cent. of all the seasonable  fish. Will they be willing to pay ninety per cent. of the rate?    Again, the college at Stonyhurst claims a right of _several  fishery_, both in the Ribble and the Hodder. That is, they  exercise a right to fish in both rivers, where they have no land,  and they exercise this right so freely that they take more fish  than all the other upper proprietors added together. If, then, the  tax is laid on the extent of frontage to the rivers, these  reverend gentlemen would escape entirely, so far as the right of  _several fishery_ extends, and would only pay the rate on their  own extent of frontage.    Again, the new bill does not embody the suggestions of the  Worcester meeting as to the right of way for the water-bailiffs;  but according to Mr. Eden's comment upon it at Chester and  elsewhere, a strict surveillance is to be kept on weirs, to which  the water-bailiffs are to have free access. Personally I have no  objection to this, provided the water-bailiffs are allowed free  access to the banks of the river elsewhere; but I have a strong  objection to be made the subject of offensive exceptional  legislation. Are not gamekeepers as likely to need looking after  as mill-owners?    Again, the bill does not touch on minimum penalties. This it ought  to do, for in some districts (Wales, for instance) there is a  strong animus against all attempts at preserving the Salmon, and  notorious poachers, duly convicted of offences against the act of  1861, in some instances have been fined a shilling, in others a  farthing.
