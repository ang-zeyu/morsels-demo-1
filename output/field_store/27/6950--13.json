(#14)"],[1,"voted, as an indemnification to the colonists for exertions allowed  to be far beyond their means and resources; and that the proper  compensation to Britain for the expense of rearing and protecting her  colonies was the monopoly of their trade, the absolute direction and  regulation of which was universally acknowledged to be inherent in the  British legislature.\"    In all ages of the world sovereign states have assumed to themselves the  right of taxing their dependant colonies for the general good. A glance  at ancient history, however, is sufficient to prove that there is danger  in the expedient. By colonial taxation Athens involved herself in many  dangerous wars, which proved highly prejudicial to her interests, and  which reads a powerful lesson to modern states and kingdoms on this  subject. The British king and British cabinet, however, had, like the  Athenians, to learn a lesson from experience, and not from the pages  of history. Conceiving that they had gone too far to recede, they were  resolutely determined not to yield their claim of right. The memorials  were not even allowed to be read in the house, for the British  legislature, with few exceptions, considered the right which they  questioned to be indisputable. Fifty-five resolutions of the committee  of ways and means, relating to this branch of the revenue, were agreed  to by the commons, and they were afterwards incorporated into an act  for laying nearly the same stamp-duties on the American colonies as were  payable at the time in England. The debate on this subject was generally  languid, but on Townshend venturing to assert, that the Americans were  \"children planted by our care and nourished by our indulgence,\" Colonel  Barre, who had served beyond the Atlantic, and knew both the country and  people well, exclaimed vehemently, \"They planted by your care! No! your  oppression planted them in America--they fled from your tyranny to  a then uncultivated and inhospitable wilderness, exposed to all the  hardships to which human nature is liable. They nourished by your  indulgence! No! they grew by your neglect of them; your care of them  was displayed, as soon as you began to take care about them, in sending  persons to rule them who were the deputies of deputies of ministers--men  whose behaviour on many occasions has caused the blood of those sons  of liberty to recoil within them--men who have been promoted to the  highest seats of justice in that country, in order to escape being  brought to the bar of justice in their own. I have been conversant with  the Americans, and I know them to be loyal indeed, but a people jealous  of their liberties, and who will vindicate them if ever they should be  violated; and let my prediction of this day be remembered, that the same  spirit of freedom which actuated that people at first will accompany  them still.\" The prediction of Colonel Barre was treated as emanating  from his loss of the regiment which he had commanded in America; and  the bill passed both houses without any difficulty, and it received the  royal assent by commission on the 22nd of March. It passed from a lack  of knowledge of American affairs; from an indifference to the interests  of the colonists; and from sheer cupidity. The profits which we had  derived from commerce with the Americans, and which were the ostensible  object proposed in planting the colonies, were not sufficient: if we  could obtain it, we must share in their profits likewise. But this was  a question which time only could solve; a riddle, which events must  explain.          INSTABILITY OF THE CABINET.    Ministers seemed to have carried matters with a high hand in parliament  during the previous debates, but there were nevertheless causes at work  which tended to weaken and dissolve their administration. The Americans  had already put their threats into execution concerning their abstinence  from the use of British goods, and this created great alarm among  shipowners, merchants, manufacturers, artizans, and labourers. The  complaints of the two latter classes of the community were increased  by a scarcity of bread, and the high price of provisions, which were  ascribed to the maladministration of the ministers. These popular  discontents, however, might have been disregarded, had not Grenville  given offence to a royal personage, whose resentment would have ensured  the downfall of even a much greater and more popular man than the prime  minister.    About a week after he had given his assent to the American Stamp Act,  it was reported that his majesty was seriously ill, and it would appear  that his illness was a slight attack of that fearful malady which thrice  afflicted him during his long reign, and incapacitated him for his  kingly duties. This time his malady was transient; but, taking warning  by it, he acquainted his ministers that he was anxious for a Regency  Bill, and told them the particulars of his intention. The sketch of such  a bill was drawn up by Fox, now Lord Holland, which left the regent  to be named by the king, and which, among other members of the royal  family, omitted the name of the queen. The queen's name was subsequently  added, but no mention was made of the Princess-dowager of Wales. The  king himself proposed that he should be invested with power, from time  to time, by instruments under his sign manual, to appoint either the  queen or any other person of the royal family, usually residing in Great  Britain, to be guardian of his succession and regent of the kingdom,  until his successor should have attained his eighteenth year. A bill to  this effect was carried in the upper house, but in the commons a motion  was made requiring the king to name those persons whom he would intrust  with so important a charge. This motion was negatived, and a question  was then raised as to the construction of the words \"any other member  of the royal family,\" and the answer given was, that they meant  \"the descendants of George the Second.\" This interpretation would have  excluded the princess-dowager from all share in the public councils, and  therefore an amendment was moved at the next reading to insert her  name next to that of the queen. This amendment was carried by a large  majority; but it was foreseen that the king would resent the insult put  upon his mother in both houses, and would attempt to rid himself of Mr.  Grenville and Lord Halifax, who had omitted to insert her name in the  bill at the very outset of the proceedings.    On the 15th of May, the king went in person to give his assent to  this bill. On that occasion a mob of silk-weavers and others, from  Spitalfields, went to St. James's Palace with black flags and other  symptoms of mourning and distress, to present a petition, complaining  that they were reduced to a state of starvation by the importation of  French silks. Both houses of parliament were surrounded by them, where  they insulted various members, and even terrified the lords into an  adjournment. In the evening they attacked Bedford-house, and began to  pull down the walls, declaring that the duke had been bribed to make the  treaty of Fontainbleau, and that it had brought poverty and all other  curses into England. The riot act was read, and the mob dispersed, but  the streets were crowded with soldiers for some days for fear of an  outbreak. Reports were also spread of mutinies among the sailors at  Portsmouth, insurrections among the Norwich weavers, and riots in Essex  and Lancashire. The cabinet and country alike seemed to be fast going  to pieces; whence his majesty, combined with the insult offered to his  mother, resolved to make some attempt to form a new administration,  hoping thereby to effect a change in the aspect of public affairs.          ATTEMPTS TO FORM A NEW ADMINISTRATION.    In a letter written to the Earl of Hertford, when the yells of the  populace of London were ringing in his ears, Mr. Burke writes:--\"The  Regency Bill has shown such want of capacity in the ministers, such an  inattention to the honour of the crown, if not such a design against it;  such imposition and surprise upon the king, and such a misrepresentation  of the disposition of parliament to the sovereign, that there is no  doubt a fixed resolution to get rid of them all--unless perhaps of  Grenville--but principally of the Duke of Bedford; so that you will have  much more reason to be surprised to find the ministry standing by the  end of next week, than to hear of their entire removal. Nothing but an  intractable temper in your friend Pitt can prevent a most admirable  and lasting system from being put together, and this crisis will show  whether pride or patriotism be predominant in his character: for you may  be assured he has it now in his power to come into the service of his  country upon any plan of politics he may choose to dictate, with great  and honourable terms to himself and to every friend he has in the world,  and with such a strength of power as will be equal to everything but  absolute despotism over the king and kingdom. A few days will show  whether he will take this part, or that of continuing on his back at  Hayes, talking fustian, excluded from all ministerial, and incapable  of all parliamentary service: for his gout is worse than ever, but his  pride may disable him more than his gout.\"    At the very time Burke wrote thus, negociations were in progress with  Pitt. For when ministers went to the king on the 16th of May, to receive  his commands for his speech at the end of the session, he had given them  to understand that he would only have it prorogued, since he intended  to make a change in the administration. In consequence of this  determination, his majesty sent his uncle, the Duke of Cumberland,  to Hayes, in Kent, to treat with Pitt. The final reply of Pitt to the  offers is said to have been, \"that he was ready to go to St. James's  provided he might carry with him the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19237"],[0,"The Secret of Divine Civilization (#14)"],[1,"fanaticism, are busy only with your quarrels and  antipathies, your indulgences and appetites and empty dreams? Is it  commendable that you should waste and fritter away in apathy the  brilliance that is your birthright, your native competence, your inborn  understanding? Again, We have digressed from Our theme.    Those European intellectuals who are well-informed as to the facts of  Europe's past, and are characterized by truthfulness and a sense of  justice, unanimously acknowledge that in every particular the basic  elements of their civilization are derived from Islam. For example  Draper,(58) the well-known French authority, a writer whose accuracy,  ability and learning are attested by all European scholars, in one of his  best-known works, The Intellectual Development of Europe, has written a  detailed account in this connection, that is, with reference to the  derivation by the peoples of Europe of the fundamentals of civilization  and the bases of progress and well-being from Islam. His account is  exhaustive, and a translation here would unduly lengthen out the present  work and would indeed be irrelevant to Our purpose. If further details are  desired the reader may refer to that text.    In essence, the author shows how the totality of Europe's civilization--its  laws, principles, institutions, its sciences, philosophies, varied  learning, its civilized manners and customs, its literature, art and  industry, its organization, its discipline, its behavior, its commendable  character traits, and even many of the words current in the French  language, derives from the Arabs. One by one, he investigates each of  these elements in detail, even giving the period when each was brought  over from Islam. He describes as well the arrival of the Arabs in the  West, in what is now Spain, and how in a short time they established a  well-developed civilization there, and to what a high degree of excellence  their administrative system and scholarship attained, and how solidly  founded and well regulated were their schools and colleges, where sciences  and philosophy, arts and crafts, were taught; what a high level of  leadership they achieved in the arts of civilization and how many were the  children of Europe's leading families who were sent to attend the schools  of Cordova and Granada, Seville and Toledo to acquire the sciences and  arts of civilized life. He even records that a European named Gerbert came  to the West and enrolled at the University of Cordova in Arab territory,  studied arts and sciences there, and after his return to Europe achieved  such prominence that ultimately he was elevated to the leadership of the  Catholic Church and became the Pope.    The purpose of these references is to establish the fact that the  religions of God are the true source of the spiritual and material  perfections of man, and the fountainhead for all mankind of enlightenment  and beneficial knowledge. If one observes the matter justly it will be  found that all the laws of politics are contained in these few and holy  words:    \"And they enjoin what is just, and forbid what is unjust, and speed on in  good works. These are of the righteous.\"(59) And again: \"that there may be  among you a people who invite to the good, and enjoin the just, and forbid  the wrong. These are they with whom it shall be well.\"(60) And further:  \"Verily, God enjoineth justice and the doing of good ... and He forbiddeth  wickedness and oppression. He warneth you that haply ye may be  mindful.\"(61) And yet again, of the civilizing of human behavior: \"Make  due allowances; and enjoin what is just, and withdraw from the  ignorant.\"(62) And likewise: \"...who master their anger, and forgive  others! God loveth the doers of good.\"(63) And again: \"There is no  righteousness in turning your faces toward the East or the West, but he is  righteous who believeth in God, and the last day, and the angels, and the  Scriptures, and the Prophets; who for the love of God disburseth his  wealth to his kindred, and to orphans, and the needy and the wayfarer, and  those who ask, and for ransom; who observeth prayer, and payeth the legal  alms, and who is of those who perform their covenant when they have  covenanted, and are patient under ills and hardships, and in time of  trouble: these are they who are just, and these are they who fear the  Lord.\"(64) And yet further: \"They prefer them before themselves, though  poverty be their own lot.\"(65) See how these few sacred verses encompass  the highest levels and innermost meanings of civilization and embody all  the excellencies of human character.    By the Lord God, and there is no God but He, even the minutest details of  civilized life derive from the grace of the Prophets of God. What thing of  value to mankind has ever come into being which was not first set forth  either directly or by implication in the Holy Scriptures?    Alas, of what avail is it. When the weapons are in cowards' hands, no  man's life and property are safe, and thieves only grow the stronger.  When, in the same way, a far-from-perfect priesthood acquire control of  affairs, they come down like a massive curtain between the people and the  light of Faith.    Sincerity is the foundation-stone of faith. That is, a religious  individual must disregard his personal desires and seek in whatever way he  can wholeheartedly to serve the public interest; and it is impossible for  a human being to turn aside from his own selfish advantages and sacrifice  his own good for the good of the community except through true religious  faith. For self-love is kneaded into the very clay of man, and it is not  possible that, without any hope of a substantial reward, he should neglect  his own present material good. That individual, however, who puts his  faith in God and believes in the words of God--because he is promised and  certain of a plentiful reward in the next life, and because worldly  benefits as compared to the abiding joy and glory of future planes of  existence are nothing to him--will for the sake of God abandon his own  peace and profit and will freely consecrate his heart and soul to the  common good. \"A man, too, there is who selleth his very self out of desire  to please God.\"(66)    There are some who imagine that an innate sense of human dignity will  prevent man from committing evil actions and insure his spiritual and  material perfection. That is, that an individual who is characterized with  natural intelligence, high resolve, and a driving zeal, will, without any  consideration for the severe punishments consequent on evil acts, or for  the great rewards of righteousness, instinctively refrain from inflicting  harm on his fellow men and will hunger and thirst to do good. And yet, if  we ponder the lessons of history it will become evident that this very  sense of honor and dignity is itself one of the bounties deriving from the  instructions of the Prophets of God. We also observe in infants the signs  of aggression and lawlessness, and that if a child is deprived of a  teacher's instructions his undesirable qualities increase from one moment  to the next. It is therefore clear that the emergence of this natural  sense of human dignity and honor is the result of education. Secondly,  even if we grant for the sake of the argument that instinctive  intelligence and an innate moral quality would prevent wrongdoing, it is  obvious that individuals so characterized are as rare as the philosopher's  stone. An assumption of this sort cannot be validated by mere words, it  must be supported by the facts. Let us see what power in creation impels  the masses toward righteous aims and deeds!    Aside from this, if that rare individual who does exemplify such a faculty  should also become an embodiment of the fear of God, it is certain that  his strivings toward righteousness would be strongly reinforced.    Universal benefits derive from the grace of the Divine religions, for they  lead their true followers to sincerity of intent, to high purpose, to  purity and spotless honor, to surpassing kindness and compassion, to the  keeping of their covenants when they have covenanted, to concern for the  rights of others, to liberality, to justice in every aspect of life, to  humanity and philanthropy, to valor and to unflagging efforts in the  service of mankind. It is religion, to sum up, which produces all human  virtues, and it is these virtues which are the bright candles of  civilization. If a man is not characterized by these excellent qualities,  it is certain that he has never attained to so much as a drop out of the  fathomless river of the waters of life that flows through the teachings of  the Holy Books, nor caught the faintest breath of the fragrant breezes  that blow from the gardens of God; for nothing on earth can be  demonstrated by words alone, and every level of existence is known by its  signs and symbols, and every degree in man's development has its  identifying mark.    The purpose of these statements is to make it abundantly clear that the  Divine religions, the holy precepts, the heavenly teachings, are the  unassailable basis of human happiness, and that the peoples of the world  can hope for no real relief or deliverance without this one great remedy.  This panacea must, however, be administered by a wise and skilled  physician, for in the hands of an incompetent all the cures that the Lord  of men has ever created to heal men's ills could produce no health, and  would on the contrary only destroy the helpless and burden the hearts of  the already afflicted.    That Source of Divine wisdom, that Manifestation of Universal Prophethood  (Muhammad), encouraging mankind to acquire sciences and arts and similar  advantages has commanded them to seek these even in the furthermost  reaches of China; yet the incompetent and caviling doctors forbid this,  offering as their justification the saying, \"He who imitates a"]]]
