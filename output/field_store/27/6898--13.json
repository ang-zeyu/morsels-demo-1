[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18237"],[0,"A Bird Calendar for Northern India (#14)"],[1,"episcopus_) are  busy at their nests in June. These birds build in large trees, usually  at a distance from water. The nest is rudely constructed of twigs. It  is about one and a half feet in diameter. The eggs are placed in a  depression lined with straw, grass or feathers. White-necked storks  often begin nest-building about the middle of May, but eggs are rarely  laid earlier than the second week of June. House-crows nest at the  same time of year, and they often worry the storks considerably by  their impudent attempts to commit larceny of building material.    The breeding season of the paddy-birds has now fairly begun. These  birds, usually so solitary in habit, often nest in small colonies,  sometimes in company with night-herons. The nest is a slender platform  of sticks placed high up in a tree, often in the vicinity of human  habitations. Nesting paddy-birds, or pond-herons as they are  frequently called, utter all manner of weird calls, the one most  frequently heard being a curious gurgle.    Some of the amadavats build nests in June, but the great majority  breed during the winter months.    As soon as the first rains have fallen a few of the pheasant-tailed  jacanas begin nesting operations, but the greater number breed in  August; for this reason their nests are described in the calendar for  that month.    In June a very striking bird makes its appearance in Northern India.  This is the pied crested cuckoo (_Coccystes jacobinus_). Its under  parts are white, as is a bar in the wing. The remainder of the plumage  is glossy black. The head is adorned by an elegant crest. The pied  cuckoo has a peculiar metallic call, which is as easy to recognise as  it is difficult to describe. The bird victimises, not crows, but  babblers; nevertheless the corvi seem to dislike it as intensely as  they dislike koels.    By the beginning of the month the great majority of the cock _bayas_  or weaver-birds have assumed their black-and-golden wedding garment;  nevertheless they do not as a rule begin to nest before July.    The curious excrescence on the bill of the drake _nukta_ or comb-duck  is now much enlarged. This betokens the approach of the nesting season  for that species.    If the monsoon happen to burst early many of the birds which breed in  the rains begin building their nests towards the end of June, but, in  nine years out of ten, July marks the beginning of the breeding period  of aquatic birds, therefore the account of their nests properly finds  place in the calendar of that month, or of August, when the season is  at its height.          JULY      Alas! creative nature calls to light    Myriads of winged forms in sportive flight,    When gathered clouds with ceaseless fury pour    A constant deluge in the rushing shower.                                     _Calcutta: A Poem_.      In July India becomes a theatre in which Nature stages a mighty  transformation scene. The prospect changes with kaleidoscopic  rapidity. The green water-logged earth is for a time overhung by dull  leaden clouds; this sombre picture melts away into one, even more  dismal, in which the rain pours down in torrents, enveloping  everything in mist and moisture. Suddenly the sun blazes forth with  indescribable brilliance and shines through an atmosphere, clear as  crystal, from which every particle of dust has been washed away.  Fleecy clouds sail majestically across the vaulted firmament. Then  follows a gorgeous sunset in which changing colours run riot through  sky and clouds--pearly grey, jet black, dark dun, pale lavender, deep  mauve, rich carmine, and brightest gold. These colours fade away into  the darkness of the night; the stars then peep forth and twinkle  brightly. At the approach of \"rosy-fingered\" dawn their lights go out,  one by one. Then blue tints appear in the firmament which deepen into  azure. The glory of the ultramarine sky does not remain long without  alloy: clouds soon appear. So the scene ever changes, hour by hour and  day by day. Had the human being who passes July in the plains but one  window to the soul and that the eye, the month would be one of pure  joy, a month spent in the contemplation of splendid dawns, brilliant  days, the rich green mantle of the earth, the majesty of approaching  thunderclouds, and superb sunsets. But, alas, July is not a month of  unalloyed pleasure. The temperature is tolerably low while the rain is  actually falling; but the moment this ceases the European is subjected  to the acute physical discomforts engendered by the hot, steamy,  oppressive atmosphere, the ferocity of the sun's rays, and the teasing  of thousands of biting and buzzing insects which the monsoon calls  into being. Termites, crickets, red-bugs, stink-bugs, horseflies,  mosquitoes, beetles and diptera of all shapes and sizes arise in  millions as if spontaneously generated. Many of these are creatures of  the night. Although born in darkness all seem to strive after light.  Myriads of them collect round every burning lamp in the open air, to  the great annoyance of the human being who attempts to read out of  doors after dark. The spotted owlets, the toads and the lizards,  however, take a different view of the invasion and partake eagerly of  the rich feast provided for them. Notwithstanding the existence of  _chiks_, or gauze doors, the hexapods crowd into the lighted bungalow,  where every illumination soon becomes the centre of a collection of  the bodies of the insects that have been burned by the flame, or  scorched by the lamp chimney. Well is it for the rest of creation that  most of these insects are short-lived. The span of life of many is but  a day: were it much longer human beings could hardly manage to exist  during the rains. Equally unbearable would life be were all the  species of monsoon insects to come into being simultaneously.  Fortunately they appear in relays. Every day some new forms enter on  the stage of life and several make their exit. The pageant of insect  life, then, is an ever-changing one. To-day one species predominates,  to-morrow another, and the day after a third. Unpleasant and  irritating though these insect hosts be to human beings, some pleasure  is to be derived from watching them. Especially is this the case when  the termites or white-ants swarm. In the damp parts of Lower Bengal  these creatures may emerge at any time of the year. In Calcutta they  swarm either towards the close of the rainy season or in spring after  an exceptionally heavy thunderstorm. In Madras they emerge from their  hiding-places in October with the northeast monsoon. In the United  Provinces the winged termites appear after the first fall of the  monsoon rain in June or July as the case may be. These succulent  creatures provide a feast for the birds which is only equalled by that  furnished by a flight of locusts. In the case of the termites it is  not only the birds that partake. The ever-vigilant crows are of course  the first to notice a swarm of termites, and they lose no time in  setting to work. The kites are not far behind them. These great birds  sail on the outskirts of the flight, seizing individuals with their  claws and transferring them to the beak while on the wing. A few  king-crows and bee-eaters join them. On the ground below  magpie-robins, babblers, toads, lizards, musk-rats and other  terrestrial creatures make merry. If the swarm comes out at dusk, as  often happens, bats and spotted owlets join those of the gourmands  that are feasting while on the wing.    The earth is now green and sweet. The sugar-cane grows apace. The  rice, the various millets and the other autumn crops are being sown.  The cultivators take full advantage of every break in the rains to  conduct agricultural operations.    As we have seen, the nocturnal chorus of the birds is now replaced by  the croaking of frogs and the stridulation of crickets. In the  day-time the birds still have plenty to say for themselves. The  brain-fever birds scream as lustily as they did in May and June. The  koel is, if possible, more vociferous than ever, especially at the  beginning of the month. The Indian cuckoo does not call so frequently  as formerly, but, by way of compensation, the pied crested cuckoo  uplifts his voice at short intervals.    The _whoot_, _whoot_, _whoot_ of the crow-pheasant booms from almost  every thicket. The iora, the coppersmith, the barbet, the  golden-backed woodpecker, and the white-breasted kingfisher continue  to call merrily. The pied starlings are in full voice; their notes  form a very pleasing addition to the avian chorus. Those magpie-robins  that have not brought nesting operations to a close are singing  vigorously. The king-crows are feeding their young ones in the  greenwood tree, and crooning softly to them _pitchu-wee_. At the  _jhils_ the various waterfowl are nesting and each one proclaims the  fact by its allotted call. Much strange music emanates from the  well-filled tank; the indescribable cries of the purple coots, the  curious \"fixed bayonets\" of the cotton teal and the weird cat-like  mews of the jacanas form the dominant notes of the aquatic symphony.    In July the black-breasted or rain-quail (_Coturnix coromandelica_) is  plentiful in India. Much remains to be discovered regarding the  movements of this species. It appears to migrate to Bengal, the United  Provinces, the Punjab and Sind shortly before the monsoon bursts, but  it is said to arrive in Nepal as early as April. It would seem to  winter in South India. It is a smaller bird than the ordinary grey  quail and has no pale cross-bars on the primary wing feathers. The  males of this species are held in high esteem by Indians as fighting  birds. Large numbers of them are netted in the same way as the grey  quail. Some captive birds are set down in a covered cage by a  sugar-cane field in the evening. Their calls attract a number of wild  birds, which settle down in the sugar-cane in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18253"],[0,"Discovery of Witches (#14)"],[1," into prison  the sick are some time delivered, some time he or she (they are most  females, most old women, and most poor,) must transfer the disease to  other persons, sometimes to a dog, or horse, or cow, &c. Threaten her  and beat her to remove it._\"--Drage, p. 23.]    The name of Margaret Johnson does not appear in Edmund Robinson's  examination. Whether accused or not, the opportunity was too alluring  to be lost by a personage full of matter, being like old Mause  Headrigg, \"as a bottle that lacketh vent,\" and too desirous of  notoriety, to let slip such an occasion. She made, on the 2nd of March  following, before the same justices who had taken Robinson's  examination, the following confession, which must have been considered  a most instructive one by those who were in search of some short _vade  mecum_ of the statistics of witchcraft in Pendle:--      \"THE CONFESSION OF MARGARET JOHNSON.    \"That betwixt seaven and eight yeares since, shee beeinge in her owne  house in _Marsden_, in a greate passion of anger and discontent, and  withall pressed with some want, there appeared unto her a spirit or  devill in ye proportion or similitude of a man, apparrelled in a suite  of blacke, tyed about with silk points, who offered yt if shee would  give him her soule hee would supply all her wants, and bringe to her  whatsoever shee did neede. And at her appointment would in revenge  either kill or hurt whom or what shee desyred, weare it man or beast.  And saith, yt after a solicitation or two shee contracted and  covenanted with ye said devill for her soule. And yt ye said devill or  spirit badde her call him by the name of _Mamilian_. And when shee  would have him to doe any thinge for her, call in _Mamilian_, and hee  would bee ready to doe her will. And saith, yt in all her talke or  conference shee calleth her said devill, _Mamil_ my God. Shee further  saith, yt ye said _Mamilian_, her devill, (by her consent) did abuse  and defile her body by comittinge wicked uncleannesse together. And  saith, yt shee was not at the greate meetings at _Hoarestones_, at the  forest of _Pendle_, upon All-Saints Day, where ----. But saith yt shee  was at a second meetinge ye Sunday next after All-Saints Day, at the  place aforesaid; where there was at yt tyme between 30 and 40 witches,  who did all ride to the said meetinge, and the end of theire said  meeting was to consult for the killinge and hurtinge of men and  beasts. And yt besides theire particular familiars or spirits, there  was one greate or grand devill or spirit more eminent than the rest.  And if any desyre to have a greate and more wonderfull devill, whereby  they may have more power to hurt, they may have one such. And sayth,  yt such witches as have sharp bones given them by the devill to pricke  them, have no pappes or dugges whereon theire devill may sucke, but  theire devill receiveth bloud from the place, pricked with the bone.  And they are more grand witches than any yt have marks. Shee allsoe  saith, yt if a witch have but one marke, shee hath but one spirit, if  two then two spirits, if three yet but two spirits. And saith, yt  theire spirits usually have knowledge of theire bodies. And being  desyred to name such as shee knewe to be witches, shee named, &c.[59]  And if they would torment a man, they bid theire spirit goe and tormt.  him in any particular place. And yt Good-Friday is one constant day  for a yearely generall meetinge of witches. And yt on Good-Friday  last, they had a meetinge neare _Pendle_ water syde. Shee alsoe saith,  that men witches usually have women spirits, and women witches men  spirits. And theire devill or spirit gives them notice of theire  meetinge, and tells them the place where it must bee. And saith, if  they desyre to be in any place upon a sodaine, theire devill or spirit  will upon a rodde, dogge, or any thinge els, presently convey them  thither: yea, into any roome of a man's house. But shee saith it is  not the substance of theire bodies, but theire spirit assumeth such  form and shape as goe into such roomes. Shee alsoe saith, yt ye devill  (after he begins to sucke) will make a pappe or dugge in a short tyme,  and the matter which hee sucks is blood. And saith yt theire devills  can cause foule weather and storms, and soe did at theire meetings.  Shee alsoe saith yt when her devill did come to sucke her pappe, hee  usually came to her in ye liknes of a cat, sometymes of one colour and  sometymes of an other. And yt since this trouble befell her, her  spirit hath left her, and shee never sawe him since.\"    [Footnote 59: The omission here is thus supplied in Baines's  Transcript; but the actual names are scarcely to be recognised, from  the clerical errors of the copy:--    \"One Pickerne and his wife both of Wyndwall,  Rawson of Clore and his wife  Duffice wife of Clore by the water side  Cartmell the wife of Clore  And Jane of the hedgend in Maresden.\"]    On the evidence contained in these examinations several persons were  committed for trial at Lancaster, and seventeen, on being tried at the  ensuing assizes, were found guilty by the jury. The judge before whom  the trial took place was, however, more sagacious and enlightened than  his predecessors, Bromley and Altham. He respited the execution of the  prisoners; and on the case being reported to the king in council, the  Bishop of Chester, Dr. Bridgman, was required to investigate the  circumstances. The inquiry was instituted at Chester, and four of the  convicted witches, namely, Margaret Johnson, Frances Dickonson, Mary  Spencer, and the wife of one of the Hargreaves's, were sent to London,  and examined, first by the king's physicians and surgeons, and  afterwards by Charles the first in person.    \"A stranger scene\" to quote Dr. Whitaker's concluding paragraph \"can  scarcely be conceived; and it is not easy to imagine whether the  untaught manners, rude dialect, and uncouth appearance of these poor  foresters, would more astonish the king; or his dignity of person and  manners, together with the splendid scene with which they were  surrounded, would overwhelm them. The end, however, of the business  was, that strong presumptions appeared of the boy having been suborned  to accuse them falsely, and they were accordingly dismissed. The boy  afterwards confessed that he was suborned.\"[60]    [Footnote 60: Webster gives the sequel of this curious case of  imposture:--\"Four of them, to wit Margaret Johnson, Francis Dicconson,  Mary Spenser, and Hargraves Wife, were sent for up to London, and were  viewed and examined by his Majesties Physicians and Chirurgeons, and  after by his Majesty and the Council, and no cause of guilt appearing  but great presumptions of the boys being suborned to accuse them  falsely. Therefore it was resolved to separate the boy from his  Father, they having both followed the women up to London, they were  both taken and put into several prisons asunder. Whereupon shortly  after the Boy confessed that he was taught and suborned to devise, and  feign those things against them, and had persevered in that wickedness  by the counsel of his Father, and some others, whom envy, revenge and  hope of gain had prompted on to that devillish design and villany; and  he also confessed, that upon that day when he said that they met at  the aforesaid house or barn, he was that very day a mile off, getting  Plums in his Neighbours Orchard. And that this is a most certain  truth, there are many persons yet living, of sufficient reputation and  integrity, that can avouch and testifie the same; and besides, what I  write is the most of it true, upon my own knowledge, and the whole I  have had from his own mouth.\"--_Displaying of Witchcraft_, p. 277.]    In Dr. Whitaker's astonishment that Margaret Johnson should make the  confession she appears to have done, in a clear case of imposture, few  of his readers will be disposed to participate, who are at all  conversant with the trials of reputed witches in this country.  Confessions were so common on those occasions, that there is, I  believe, not a single instance of any great number of persons being  convicted of witchcraft at one time, some of whom did not make a  confession of guilt. Nor is there anything extraordinary in that  circumstance, when it is remembered that many of them sincerely  believed in the existence of the powers attributed to them; and  others, aged and of weak understanding, were, in a measure, coerced by  the strong persuasion of their guilt, which all around them  manifested, into an acquiescence in the truth of the accusation. In  many cases the confessions were made in the hope, and no doubt with  the promise, seldom performed, that a respite from punishment would be  eventually granted. In other instances, there is as little doubt, that  they were the final results of irritation, agony, and despair.[61] The  confessions are generally composed of \"such stuff as dreams are made  of,\" and what they report to have occurred, might either proceed, when  there was no intention to fabricate, from intertwining the fantastic  threads which sometimes stream upon the waking senses from the land of  shadows, or be caused by those ocular hallucinations of which medical  science has supplied full and satisfactory solution. There is no  argument which so long maintained its ground in support of witchcraft  as that which was founded on the confessions referred to. It was the  last plank clung to by many a witch-believing lawyer and divine. And  yet there is none which will less bear critical scrutiny and  examination, or the fallacy of which can more easily be shown, if any  particular reported confession is taken as a test and subjected to a  searching analysis and inquiry.
