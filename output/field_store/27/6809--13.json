Hence the attempts, on the  one hand, of discarding by skilful interpretation all contradictions met  with in the sacred text, and, on the other hand, of showing what  sections of the different Upanishads have to be viewed as teaching the  same matter, and therefore must be combined in one meditation. The  latter is the special task of the present pada.    Adhik. I and II (1-4; 5) are concerned with the question whether those  vidyas, which are met with in identical or similar form in more than one  sacred text, are to be considered as constituting several vidyas, or one  vidya only. /S/a@nkara remarks that the question affects only those  vidyas whose object is the qualified Brahman; for the knowledge of the  non-qualified Brahman, which is of an absolutely uniform nature, can of  course be one only wherever it is set forth. But things lie differently  in those cases where the object of knowledge is the sagu/n/am brahma or  some outward manifestation of Brahman; for the qualities as well as  manifestations of Brahman are many. Anticipating the subject of a later  adhikara/n/a, we may take for an example the so-called /S/a/nd/ilyavidya  which is met with in Ch. Up. III, 14, again--in an abridged form--in  B/ri/. Up. V, 6, and, moreover, in the tenth book of the  /S/atapathabrahma/n/a (X, 6, 3). The three passages enjoin a meditation  on Brahman as possessing certain attributes, some of which are specified  in all the three texts (as, for instance, manomayatva, bharupatva),  while others are peculiar to each separate passage (pra/n/a/s/ariratva  and satyasa/m/kalpatva, for instance, being mentioned in the Chandogya  Upanishad and /S/atapatha-brahma/n/a, but not in the B/ri/hadara/n/yaka  Upanishad, which, on its part, specifies sarvava/s/itva, not referred to  in the two other texts). Here, then, there is room for a doubt whether  the three passages refer to one object of knowledge or not. To the  devout Vedantin the question is not a purely theoretical one, but of  immediate practical interest. For if the three texts are to be held  apart, there are three different meditations to be gone through; if, on  the other hand, the vidya is one only, all the different qualities of  Brahman mentioned in the three passages have to be combined into one  meditation.--The decision is here, as in all similar cases, in favour of  the latter alternative. A careful examination of the three passages  shows that the object of meditation is one only; hence the meditation  also is one only, comprehending all the attributes mentioned in the  three texts.    Adhik. III (6-8) discusses the case of vidyas being really separate,  although apparently identical. The examples selected are the  udgithavidyas of the Chandogya Upanishad (I, 1-3) and the  B/ri/hadara/n/yaka Upanishad (I, 3), which, although showing certain  similarities--such as bearing the same name and the udgitha being in  both identified with pra/n/a--yet are to be held apart, because the  subject of the Chandogya vidya is not the whole udgitha but only the  sacred syllabic Om, while the B/ri/hadara/n/yaka Upanishad represents  the whole udgitha as the object of meditation.    Sutra 9 constitutes in /S/a@nkara's view a new adhikara/n/a (IV),  proving that in the passage, 'Let a man meditate' (Ch. Up. I, 1, 1), the  O/m/kara and the udgitha stand in the relation of one specifying the  other, the meaning being, 'Let a man meditate on that O/m/kara which,'  &c.--According to Ramanuja's interpretation, which seems to fall in more  satisfactorily with the form and the wording of the Sutra, the latter  merely furnishes an additional argument for the conclusion arrived at in  the preceding adhikara/n/a.--Adhik. V (10) determines the unity of the  so-called pra/n/a-vidyas and the consequent comprehension of the  different qualities of the pra/n/a, which are mentioned in the different  texts, within one meditation.    Adhik. VI comprises, according to /S/a@nkara, the Sutras 11-13. The  point to be settled is whether in all the meditations on Brahman all its  qualities are to be included or only those mentioned in the special  vidya. The decision is that the essential and unalterable attributes of  Brahman, such as bliss and knowledge, are to be taken into account  everywhere, while those which admit of a more or less (as, for instance,  the attribute of having joy for its head, mentioned in the Taitt. Up.)  are confined to special meditations.--Adhik. VII (14, 15), according to  /S/a@nkara, aims at proving that the object of Ka/th/a. Up. III, 10, 11  is one only, viz. to show that the highest Self is higher than  everything, so that the passage constitutes one vidya only.--Adhik. VIII  (16, 17) determines, according to /S/a@nkara, that the Self spoken of in  Ait. Ar. II, 4, 1, 1 is not a lower form of the Self (the so-called  sutratman), but the highest Self; the discussion of that point in this  place being due to the wish to prove that the attributes of the highest  Self have to be comprehended in the Aitarcyaka meditation.    According to Ramanuja the Sutras 11-17 constitute a single adhikara/n/a  whose subject is the same as that of /S/a@nkara's sixth adhikar/n/a.  Sutras 11-13 are, on the whole, explained as by /S/a@nkara; Sutra 12,  however, is said to mean, 'Such attributes as having joy for its head,  &c. are not to be viewed as qualities of Brahman, and therefore not to  be included in every meditation; for if they were admitted as qualities,  difference would be introduced into Brahman's nature, and that would  involve a more or less on Brahman's part.' Sutras 14-17 continue the  discussion of the passage about the priya/s/irastva.--If  priya/s/irastva, &c. are not to be viewed as real qualities of Brahman,  for what purpose does the text mention them?--'Because,' Sutra 14  replies, 'there is no other purpose, Scripture mentions them for the  purpose of pious meditation.'--But how is it known that the Self of  delight is the highest Self? (owing to which you maintain that having  limbs, head, &c. cannot belong to it as attributes.)--'Because,' Sutra  15 replies, 'the term \"Self\" (atma anandamaya) is applied to it.'--But  in the previous parts of the chapter the term Self (in atma pra/n/amaya,  &c.) is applied to non-Selfs also; how then do you know that in atma  anandamaya it denotes the real Self?--'The term Self,' Sutra 16 replies,  'is employed here to denote the highest Self as in many other passages  (atmaa va idam eka, &c.), as we conclude from the subsequent passage,  viz. he wished, May I be many.'--But, an objection is raised, does not  the context show that the term 'Self,' which in all the preceding  clauses about the pra/n/amaya, &c. denoted something other than the  Self, does the same in anandamaya atman, and is not the context of  greater weight than a subsequent passage?--To this question asked in the  former half of 17 (anvayad iti /k/et) the latter half replies, 'Still it  denotes the Self, owing to the affirmatory statement,' i.e. the fact of  the highest Self having been affirmed in a previous passage also, viz.  II, 1, 'From that Self sprang ether.'    Adhik. IX (18) discusses a minor point connected with the  pra/n/asa/m/vada.--The subject of Adhik. X (19) has been indicated  already above under Adhik. I.--Adhik. XI (20-22) treats of a case of a  contrary nature; in B/ri/. Up. V, 5, Brahman is represented first as  abiding in the sphere of the sun, and then as abiding within the eye; we  therefore, in spite of certain counter-indications, have to do with two  separate vidyas.--Adhik. XII (23) refers to a similar case; certain  attributes of Brahman mentioned in the Ra/n/ayaniya-khila have not to be  introduced into the corresponding Chandogya vidya, because the stated  difference of Brahman's abode involves difference of vidya.--Adhik. XIII  (24) treats of another instance of two vidyas having to be held apart.    Adhik. XIV (25) decides that certain detached mantras and brahma/n/a  passages met with in the beginning of some Upanishads--as, for instance,  a brahma/n/a about the mahavrata ceremony at the beginning of the  Aitareya-ara/n/yaka--do, notwithstanding their position which seems to  connect them with the brahmavidya, not belong to the latter, since they  show unmistakable signs of being connected with sacrificial acts.    Adhik. XV (26) treats of the passages stating that the man dying in the  possession of true knowledge shakes off all his good and evil deeds, and  affirms that a statement, made in some of those passages only, to the  effect that the good and evil deeds pass over to the friends and enemies  of the deceased, is valid for all the passages.    Sutras 27-30 constitute, according to /S/a@nkara, two adhikara/n/as of  which the former (XVI; 27, 28) decides that the shaking off of the good  and evil deeds takes place--not, as the Kaush. Up. states, on the road  to Brahman's world--but at the moment of the soul's departure from the  body; the Kaushitaki statement is therefore not to be taken  literally.--The latter adhikara/n/a (XVII; 29, 30) treats of the cognate  question whether the soul that has freed itself from its deeds proceeds  in all cases on the road of the gods (as said in the Kaush. Up.), or  not. The decision is that he only whose knowledge does not pass beyond  the sagu/n/am brahma proceeds on that road, while the soul of him who  knows the nirgu/n/am brahma becomes one with it without moving to any  other place.    The /S/ri-bhashya treats the four Sutras as one adhikara/n/a whose two  first Sutras are explained as by /S/a@nkara, while Sutra 29 raises an  objection to the conclusion arrived at, 'the going (of the soul on the  path of the gods) has a sense only if the soul's freeing itself from its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16331"],[0,"New York Times Current History: The European War from the Beginning to March (#14)"],[1,"the personal warning which he had given  to the German Ambassador to the sharpest official threat. In a telegram  to the Ambassador in Berlin upon the question placed before him by the  Chancellor of the empire on the day prior, (British \"White Paper\" No.  85,) whether England would remain neutral if Germany would bind itself,  after possible war, to claim no French territory in Europe whatever,  while in lieu of the French colonies a like guarantee could not be  accepted, Grey answers with thundering words:         His Majesty's Government cannot for a moment entertain the       Chancellor's proposal that they should bind themselves to       neutrality on such terms. What he asks us in effect is to engage to       stand by while French colonies are taken and France is beaten, so       long as Germany does not take French territory as distinct from the       colonies. From a material point of view such a proposal is       unacceptable, for France without further territory in Europe being       taken from her could be so crushed as to lose her position as a       great power and become subordinate to German policy. Altogether       apart from that, it would be a disgrace for us to make this bargain       with Germany at the expense of France, a disgrace from which the       good name of this country could never recover.--(British \"White       Paper\" No. 101.)    With this telegram the war on Germany was practically declared, for as a  price of British neutrality an open humiliation of Germany was demanded.  If France--the question of French colonies is of very minor importance  in this connection--must not be defeated by Germany, then England  forbade the German Government to make war. It was furthermore stated  that Germany was absolutely compelled to accept Russian-French dictates,  and would have to leave Austria to its own resources. This would have  meant Germany's retirement from the position of a great power, even if  she had backed down before such a challenge.             *       *       *       *       *          III.    THE AGREEMENT WITH FRANCE.      Only in the light of the developments concerning England's relation to  France, given at the beginning of the war, Grey's policy, swaying  between indecision and precipitate action, becomes apparent.    In all the explanations which the British Government in the course of  eight years had presented to the British Parliament concerning the  relations to other large powers, the assurance had been repeated that no  binding agreements with the two partners of the Franco-Russian alliance  had been made, above all, that no agreement with France existed. Only in  his speech in the House of Commons on Aug, 3, 1914, which meant the war  with Germany, Grey gave to the representatives of the people news of  certain agreements which made it a duty for Great Britain to work  together with France in any European crisis.    The fateful document, which in the form of an apparently private letter  to the French Ambassador, dealt with one of the most important compacts  of modern history, was written toward the end of the year 1912, and is  published in the British \"White Paper\" No. 105, Annex 1:         London Foreign Office, Nov. 22, 1912.         My Dear Ambassador:         From time to time in recent years the French and British naval and       military experts have consulted together. It has always been       understood that such consultation does not restrict the freedom of       either Government to decide at any future time whether or not to       assist the other by armed force. We have agreed that consultation       between experts is not, and ought not to be, regarded as an       engagement that commits either Government to action in a       contingency that has not arisen and may never arise. The       disposition, for instance, of the French and British fleets       respectively at the present moment is not based upon an engagement       to co-operate in war.         You have, however, pointed out that, if either Government had grave       reason to expect an unprovoked attack by a third power, it might       become essential to know whether it could in that event depend upon       the armed assistance of the other.         I agree that, if either Government had grave reason to expect an       unprovoked attack by a third power, or something that threatened       the general peace, it should immediately discuss with the other       whether both Governments should act together to prevent aggression       and to preserve peace, and, if so, what measures they would be       prepared to take in common. If these measures involved action, the       plans of the General Staffs would at once be taken into       consideration, and the Governments would then decide what effect       should be given to them.         Yours, &c.,         E. GREY.    Was Parliament Deceived?    A few members of the English Parliament who on Aug. 3 dared to gingerly  protest against the war may have had reason to complain about the hiding  of facts from the House of Commons. When such understandings can be made  without any one having an idea of their existence, then--so far as  England is concerned--the supervision of the Government, theoretically  being exercised by a Parliament, becomes a fiction.    Veiled Defensive Alliance.    As a matter of fact, Grey does not desire to have accepted as political  obligations the conversations of the French and English Army and Navy  General Staffs concerning the future plans of campaign which took place  from time to time in times of peace. However, the true tendency of this  agreement, for such it is, gives itself away in the promise to  immediately enter with France into a political and military exchange of  opinions in every critical situation; it means in realty nothing less  than a veiled defensive alliance which by clever diplomatic  manipulations can be changed without any difficulty to an offensive one,  for inasmuch as the English Government promises to consult and work  together with France, and consequently also with its ally, Russia, in  every crisis, before a serious investigation of the moments of danger,  it waives all right of taking an independent position.    How would England ever have been able to enter a war against France  without throwing upon itself the accusation of faithlessness against one  with whose plans for war it had become acquainted through negotiations  lasting through years?    Here a deviation may be permissible, which leaves for a moment the basis  of documentary proof.    If one considers how this agreement of such immeasurable  consequences was not only hidden from the British Parliament by the  Cabinet, but how to the very edge of conscious deceit its existence was  denied--in the year 1913 Premier Asquith answered a query of a member of  the House of Commons that there were no unpublished agreements in  existence which in a case of war between European powers would interfere  with or limit free decision on the part of the British Government or  Parliament as to whether or not Britain should take part at a war--then  certain reports making their appearance with great persistency in June,  1914, concerning an Anglo-Russian naval agreement are seen in a  different light.    Persons who were acquainted with the happenings in diplomacy then stated  that the Russian Ambassador in Paris, M. Iswolski, during the visit  which the King of England and Sir Edward Grey were paying to Paris, had  succeeded in winning the English statesmen for the plan of such an  agreement. A formal alliance, it was said, was not being demanded by  Russia immediately, for good reasons. M. Iswolski was attempting to go  nearer to his goal, carefully, step by step.    It had been preliminarily agreed that negotiations should be started  between the British Admiralty and the Russian Naval Attache in London,  Capt. Wolkow. As a matter of fact Wolkow during June went to St.  Petersburg for a few days to, as was assumed, obtain instructions and  then return to London.    Grey's \"Twisty\" Answer.    These happenings aroused so much attention in England that questions  were raised in Parliament concerning them. It was noted how twisty  Grey's answer was. He referred to the answer of the Premier, already  mentioned, stated that the situation is unchanged, and said then that no  negotiations were under way concerning a naval agreement with any  foreign nation. \"As far as he was able to judge the matter,\" no such  negotiations would be entered into later on.    The big Liberal newspaper, The Manchester Guardian, was not at all  satisfied with this explanation; it assumed that certain conditional  preliminary agreements might not be excluded.    This Russian plan, which was later worked out in St. Petersburg, went  into oblivion on account of the rapidly following European war. In the  light of the following revelation of Grey's agreement with France, the  news of the naval agreement desired by Iswolski assumed another aspect.    Let us return to the Anglo-French agreement. The following remarks by  the French Ambassador in London, reported by Grey, prove that, on the  ground of this agreement, France, with very little trouble, would be  able to make out of a diplomatic entanglement a case for Allies'  interest as far as England is concerned.    A German \"Attack.\"    He [Cambon] anticipated that the [German] aggression would take the form  of either a demand to cease her preparations or a demand that she should  engage to remain neutral if there was war between Germany and Russia.  Neither of these things would France admit.--(British \"White Paper\" No.  105.)    Therefore, even the demand addressed to France not to, jointly with  Russia, attack Germany became a German \"attack,\" which obliged England  to come to the aid!    In spite of this, even on July 27 in a conversation with Cambon, Grey  gave himself the appearance as if his hands were free."]]]
