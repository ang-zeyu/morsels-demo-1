[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17249"],[0,"Added Upon (#14)"],[1," on the day of Pentecost when the Holy  Spirit was given, Peter preached to a large crowd of people. Many of  them believed, and being pricked in their hearts, they said: 'Men and  brethren, what shall we do?' You know they are not the only ones who  have asked that question.\"    \"No, you are right.\"    \"'And Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in  the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive  the gift of the Holy Ghost.' That's plain enough, isn't it? Words can  make it no clearer. When Peter saw that they had faith, he told them to  repent, then be baptized for the remission of their sins, then they  would get the Holy Ghost.\"    \"And the promise was to them and to their children and to them that were  afar off. Signe, is it not to us also?\" Rupert asked, eagerly, \"why  shouldn't it be?\"    \"The promise is not limited--it is to you and to me. I, Rupert, have  obeyed Peter's word, and have received the promise. You may do the same,  and the same blessings will follow. The gospel is a law, a natural law,  and oh, such a beautiful one!\"    \"Why haven't I heard this before?\" exclaimed he. \"Why isn't it written  in our books, and taught us in our childhood? Signe, I am a bit  bewildered yet.\"    \"Rupert,\" said she, with a smile that had something of sadness in it,  \"the world is 'Ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of  the truth.' 'Darkness has covered the earth and gross darkness the  people.' 'And as with the people, so with the priest.' 'The earth also  is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed  the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.' Is  there any wonder that you have not heard these doctrines before? Though  you may read about them in the Bible, the world has been without their  living presence for many hundreds of years. But a new time has come to  the world. The gospel in its fulness and purity has been restored. We  read here that John, on the Isle of Patmos, saw that in the latter days  an angel would 'fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting  gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth.' That angel has come,  Rupert, that gospel has been restored; and what I have been telling you  are the teachings of that gospel. Man is again endowed with power from  on high to preach the gospel and administer its ordinances to those who  believe.\"    Rupert listened with deepest interest. He became as a disciple at her  feet. They talked far into the night, and when Mr. and Mrs. Janson came  home they found them bending low over the fire reading from the \"good  old book.\" Their heads were close together, the dark-brown one and the  one of soft, silken tresses.          X.      \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept    the faith.\"--_II Tim. 4:7._      Rupert was now continually thinking of the great questions of life.  Never before had he been so stirred in his feelings; never before had he  contemplated life in the light which now came to him. His heart was full  of love, gratitude, and praise which swelled within him, and seemed to  take possession of his whole being.    The winter passed, and Rupert closed his school. He came to the  conclusion that school teaching was not his forte, though the people  were satisfied with his work. He longed to be out digging ditches. He  liked it far better, and conjectured that in this world his mission was  to make the physical deserts to blossom as the rose.    During the summer, Chamogo valley did undergo a change. One side of the  valley was brought under irrigation, and a number of farms were sold at  a good profit. Mr. Janson did right by Rupert, and together they worked  and prospered.    And that which now filled Rupert's cup of happiness was the fact that he  had rendered obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ, and had received  the promised gifts and blessings following. The light that leadeth into  all truth was his. With Signe and her co-religionists, he could now see  eye to eye, all having the same glorious hope for the future.    One more winter passed; and when nature had spread her robe of green  over Chamogo valley, preparations were made for the ceremony that would  make Rupert and Signe husband and wife. Rupert longed to see Willowby  and Dry Bench once more, so it was decided that after they had visited  the Temple of God and had been sealed to each other for time and all  eternity, they would take a trip to Rupert's old home. They were married  in the Temple. Within its sacred walls they experienced more fully than  ever before what still sweetness there is in the ministrations of the  Spirit of God.    They reached Willowby late in September. He had written Nina when he  would be there, and she and her husband were at the station to meet  them.    There were tears in their eyes at the meeting.    \"Nina, this is my wife,\" said Rupert. \"Signe, my sister, Mrs. Furns.\"    A number of Rupert's old friends were there who now came forward and  welcomed him home.    Then they rode through the valley behind two spirited grays. Nina had  not changed much, but she declared that had she met her brother on the  street, she would not have known him.    \"What has changed you so, brother?\" asked she.    \"Experience, Nina, experience with the world I have lived a long time in  the two and a half years that I have been away--but never mind that now.  Everything looks the same hereabouts. I seem to have been absent but a  few days. How strange it is! Signe, there you see Willowby, on that  rise; quite a town yet. How's Dry Bench, James?\"    \"Much the same, Rupe. No improvements since you left.\"    \"And the reservoir?\"    \"As you left it, though it needs repairing badly.\"    In the few moments of silence that followed, Rupert contrasted his  condition now with what it was when he left the place. What a change! He  was wiser if not much older. And then he had a wife--and he looked  lovingly at her as he thought of all she had done for him. As they drove  into town, friends greeted him and seemed pleased at his return.  Married? Yes; that is his wife. Not so dashing as Miss Wilton, but far  more charming, was the general expression.    That evening there was quite a social gathering at Nina's.    Early next morning, before others of the household were astir, Rupert  and Signe went up to Dry Bench. A beautiful morning greeted them. They  walked up towards the hill that they might get a good view of the farm,  and when they turned, Dry Bench was before them. The trees had grown,  but otherwise it was the same scene that he had looked upon many and  many a time. The memory of a particular morning came to him--the morning  when Miss Wilton's horse had run away. Miss Wilton had never been heard  of since she left Willowby.    \"How beautiful!\" exclaimed Signe. \"Do you know, Rupert, it reminds me of  a scene in Norway. I must make a sketch here before we leave.\"    \"Sit down on this rock,\" said he, \"while I tell you something. Here's my  overcoat.\" He made a seat for her and he stood by her side.    \"Signe, nearly six years ago, I stood here on this spot. I was the owner  of the farm that you see. In fact, I dug this ditch. I set out that  orchard, I planned and built the reservoir that has made all this  possible; and then I stood here, and in the pride of my heart I said:  'All this is mine. I have done it all.' Now I understand that God put me  on trial, lent me some of His riches to try me, and then, seeing that I  was not in a condition to stand such favors, took them all from me. Yes,  it was a blessing in disguise. Darling, for this knowledge I am indebted  to you,\" and he leaned over and kissed her.    \"There you are wrong again,\" she said; \"what about God above?\"    \"You are right. 'Tis He only who should have our gratitude. You have  been but an instrument in His hand. I see it all. O Father, forgive my  foolish thoughts.\" He uncovered his head, as if in prayer.    He sat down with her on the stone. The smoke began to rise from the  chimneys of the town below, and soon the Dry Bench farm-houses showed  signs of life. He pressed her cheek against his own.    \"Sweetheart,\" said he, \"'When love has blended and molded two beings in  an angelic and sacred union, they have found the secret of life;  henceforth they are only the two terms of the same destiny, the two  wings of one mind. Love and soar.' That is from Victor Hugo; how true it  is.\"    After a time they went down to the old home. A Mr. Temming was living  there, as a renter. He was not acquainted with Mr. Ames, and was not  disposed to show much courtesy, so they left.    \"What do you think of the place?\" he asked.    \"I like it.\"    \"Could you live there?\"    \"All my life, I could. Rupert, I see you in every tree, fence, and  ditch.\"    He laughed at that.    \"I can now buy the place. Shall I?\"    \"Yes, do.\"    \"You don't object? Would you really like to live there?\"    \"I think, my dear, that you can do much good here. We ought to live  where we can do the most good.\"    And so it was settled. Next day Rupert inquired after the owner of the  farm which once was his, and learned that it was in the hands of a real  estate dealer. He made his way to the office and knocked at the door,  which was partly open. A man was sitting at a desk, but he evidently did  not hear, so Rupert stepped into the room, at the same time giving the  door another loud rap. Still the man did not hear.    \"Good morning, sir,\" said Rupert.    The man turned.    \"Volmer, Volmer Holm, is it you?\"    \"Rupert Ames, I'm pleased to see you. When did you come to town? Have a  chair.\"    \"Are you in the real estate business?\"    \"I can't hear very well, and you'll have to speak at close range, Rupe.\"    So they put their chairs close together, and Rupert repeated his last  question.    \"Yes, a man must do something; but there's nothing going on now--nothing  in our line.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17253"],[0,"Dewey and Other Naval Commanders (#14)"],[1," anxiety that would not allow them to remain still. At intervals a gun  was fired or a rocket sent up to guide the missing ones, but none  appeared. Every man had been killed by the explosion of the ketch.    Investigations made afterward seemed to establish that Somers was  attacked by three gunboats, and, finding escape impossible, it was he  who ran along the deck, lighted lantern in hand, and deliberately blew  up the _Intrepid_, destroying not only himself and companions, but many  of the enemy. The mangled remains of several bodies were found some days  later and given burial on shore, but not one could be recognized.  Captain Bainbridge and some of his brother officers, who were prisoners  in Tripoli, were allowed to view them. He said: \"From the whole of them  being so disfigured, it was impossible to recognize any feature known to  us, or even to distinguish an officer from a seaman.\"    In November, Commodore Samuel Barron arrived, and succeeded Captain  Preble in command of the American squadron. He brought with him the  _President_ and _Constellation_, thereby increasing the force to ten  vessels, carrying two hundred and sixty-four guns.    Having failed to bring the Bashaw to terms by force of arms, the  Americans now resorted to what may be termed diplomacy. The reigning  Bashaw of Tripoli was a usurper, having displaced his elder brother, who  had fled to Upper Egypt. He had a good many friends, who, if they dared,  would have been glad to replace him on his throne. The American consul,  who understood all the particulars, proposed to our government to use  the deposed ruler as an instrument to compel the usurper to make terms.  The Government authorized the consul to go ahead.    Accordingly, he made his way to Alexandria, sought out the banished  ruler, proposed his plan, and it was eagerly accepted. He furnished the  consul with a cavalry escort, enlisted a number of Greek soldiers, the  party marched a thousand miles across the flaming Barcan desert, and in  April appeared before Derne, one of the seaports of the reigning  monarch, who was also advancing upon the place. With the help of the  American fleet, the town was captured, and, for the first time in its  history, the Stars and Stripes were given to the breeze above a  fortification on the eastern side of the Atlantic.    By the enlistment of the mongrel population of the neighborhood, the  American consul gathered a formidable force, with which the enemy were  again defeated. Then they boldly set out for Tripoli.    Meanwhile the usurper was shivering with fear, and was more than ready  to make a treaty of peace with the terrible barbarians from the other  side of the ocean. The treaty was signed on June 2, 1805. The Bashaw,  who had demanded a princely sum for the release of his American  prisoners, was now glad to set them free for $60,000. It was agreed,  furthermore, that no more tribute should be paid, and thus ended all our  troubles with Tripoli.    These proceedings left the rightful ruler in the lurch. He had been  promised that he should be restored to his throne on condition of  helping the Americans, and he had given the most valuable sort of aid,  but the treaty declared that no assistance should be given him. It was a  gross injustice on the part of our Government, which did no special  credit to itself, when, after the deposed ruler had made a pitiful  appeal to Congress, that body presented him with a beggarly pittance of  $2,400.          THE WAR OF 1812.      CHAPTER XI.    Cause of the War of 1812--Discreditable Work of the Land  Forces--Brilliant Record of the Navy--The _Constitution_--Captain Isaac  Hull--Battle Between the _Constitution_ and _Guerriere_--Winning a  Wager.      Probably no hostilities in which the United States was ever engaged so  abound with stirring, romantic and remarkable exploits as those upon the  ocean in the War of 1812.    Now, as to the cause of the war between England and our country: Great  Britain was engaged in a tremendous conflict with France, at the head of  which was the greatest military leader of the world, Napoleon Bonaparte.  England needed every soldier and sailor she could get. Some of them  deserted to our ships, so her officers began the practice of stopping  such vessels on the ocean, searching them for deserters, and if found  they were taken away. Sometimes she took Americans, because she knew  they were good seamen, and, to excuse her action, she declared they were  deserters from the British navy.    [Illustration: IMPRESSING AMERICAN SAILORS.]    This action was against the law of nations. She had no more right to  molest an American vessel than she had to land a force on our coast,  march inland and search the house of a private family. We protested, but  she paid no attention. It happened more than once that when our vessels  refused to be searched the English fired into them and killed and  wounded some of the American crews. If any nation acted that way toward  England to-day she would declare war at once, and so would any other  nation.    Finding there was no peaceable way of stopping the unbearable conduct of  Great Britain, our country, in the month of June, 1812, declared war  against her, and it lasted until the early part of 1815.    There was one feature of that war which it is not pleasant for Americans  to recall. It opened with a cowardly surrender by General William Hull  of Detroit to the English army, and for two years our land forces did  very little to their credit. They set out to invade Canada several  times, but in every instance were beaten. The leading generals were  \"poor sticks,\" quarreled among themselves, and for a time failed to gain  any advantage. The trouble was not with the soldiers. They were among  the best in the world, but their leaders were of no account. By and by,  however, the poor officers were weeded out and good ones took their  places. Then something was accomplished in which we all could feel  pride.    It was just the other way on the ocean. From the very start our naval  vessels and privateers won the most brilliant of victories. This was the  more remarkable when several facts are kept in mind. Great Britain had  been at war so long that she had the most powerful navy by far in the  world. It numbered one thousand and thirty-six vessels, of which two  hundred and fifty-four were ships-of-the-line, not one of which carried  less than seventy guns of large calibre. This prodigious navy was manned  by one hundred and forty-four thousand sailors, and eighty-five of her  war vessels were on the American coast, equipped and ready for action.    In amazing contrast to all this, we had only twenty large war vessels  and a number of gunboats that were of little account. The disparity was  so great that our Government, after looking at the situation and  discussing the matter, decided that it would be folly to fight England  on the ocean, and it was decided not to do so. When Captains Stewart and  Bainbridge learned of this decision, they went to President Madison and  his advisers and insisted that the American navy, weak as it was, should  be given a chance of showing what it could do. Consent was finally  given, and then opened the wonderful career of our cruisers and  privateers.    Among the frigates that had been built during our war with France was  the _Constitution_, which carried 44 guns. She earned the name of being  one of the luckiest ships in the navy, and because of her astonishing  record was named \"Old Ironsides.\" The old hulk of this historical ship  is still carefully preserved in remembrance of her brilliant record,  which in some respects has never been equalled.    Sailors are superstitious, and the good name which the _Constitution_  gained made it easy to get all the seamen needed. When you come to look  into the matter you will find that the _Constitution_ was a lucky ship,  because it was always officered by the best men we had, and they were  wise enough to choose the finest crews.    The captain of the _Constitution_, when the war broke out, was Isaac  Hull, a nephew of General William Hull, who made the cowardly surrender  of Detroit. He was born in Connecticut in 1773, and died in 1843. He was  one of the brilliant young officers who received his commission in 1798,  and was commander of the _Argus_ during the war with Tripoli. He was  made a captain in 1806, and the following year was given command of the  _Constitution_.    Upon learning that the war had broken out, Captain Hull left the  Chesapeake, with orders to join the squadron under the command of  Captain Rodgers at New York. When off Barnegat, New Jersey, he was  sighted by the blockading squadron of Captain Philip Bowes Vere Broke,  which gave chase. The ingenuity and skill displayed by Captain Hull in  escaping from the enemy, when all escape seemed hopeless, is still  referred to as one of the most remarkable exploits in the history of the  American navy. The chase lasted for more than two days and three nights,  and it is safe to say that very few commanders placed in the situation  of Captain Hull would have been able to save themselves from capture.    Captain Hull sailed on a cruise from Boston on August 21, just in time  to dodge an order from Washington to remain in port until further  orders. On the afternoon of August 19, when several hundred miles to the  eastward of Halifax, he sighted the British frigate _Guerriere_. Her  commander, Captain James E. Dacres, was an old acquaintance of Hull, and  the two had made a wager of a hat during peace that if they ever met in  battle the other would run.    The British officer was as anxious as Hull for a fight, and they drew  near each other, both confident of winning the wager made half in jest  a brief time before.    Great interest attaches to this naval battle, for it was the first of  its kind and a fair test of the respective prowess of ships of and crews  of that nature."]]]
