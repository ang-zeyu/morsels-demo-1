[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17280"],[0,"Anthropology (#14)"],[1," For a long time, then, man along the north coasts must have been  oppressed rather than assisted by his environment. It made  mass-movements impossible. Great waves of migration from the  steppe-land to the northeast, or from the forest-land to the north-west,  would thunder on the long mountain barrier, only to trickle across  in rivulets and form little pools of humanity here and there. Petty  feuds between plain, shore, and mountain, as in ancient Attica, would  but accentuate the prevailing division. Contrariwise, on the southern  side of the Mediterranean, where there was open, if largely desert,  country, there would be room under primitive conditions for a  homogeneous race to multiply. It is in North Africa that we must  probably place the original hotbed of that Mediterranean race, slight  and dark with oval heads and faces, who during the neolithic period  colonized the opposite side of the Mediterranean, and threw out a wing  along the warm Atlantic coast as far north as Scotland, as well as  eastwards to the Upper Danube; whilst by way of south and east they  certainly overran Egypt, Arabia, and Somaliland, with probable  ramifications still farther in both directions. At last, however, in  the eastern Mediterranean was learnt the lesson of the profits  attending the sea-going life, and there began the true Mediterranean  phase, which is essentially an era of sea-borne commerce. Then was  the chance for the northern shore with its peninsular configuration.  Carthage on the south shore must be regarded as a bold experiment that  did not answer. The moral, then, would seem to be that the Mediterranean  basin proved an ideal nursery for seamen; but only as soon as men were  brave and clever enough to take to the sea. The geographical factor  is at least partly consequence as well as cause.           *       *       *       *       *    Now let us proceed farther north into what was for the earlier  Mediterranean folk the breeding-ground of barbarous outlanders,  forming the chief menace to their circuit of settled civic life. It  is necessary to regard northern Europe and northern Asia as forming  one geographic province. Asia Minor, together with the Euphrates  valley and with Arabia in a lesser degree, belongs to the Mediterranean  area. India and China, with the south-eastern corner of Asia that lies  between them, form another system that will be considered separately  later on.    The Eurasian northland consists naturally, that is to say, where  cultivation has not introduced changes, of four belts. First, to the  southward, come the mountain ranges passing eastwards into high  plateau. Then, north of this line, from the Lower Danube, as far as  China, stretches a belt of grassland or steppe-country at a lower level,  a belt which during the milder periods of the ice-age and immediately  after it must have reached as far as the Atlantic. Then we find, still  farther to the north, a forest belt, well developed in the Siberia  of to-day. Lastly, on the verge of the Arctic sea stretches the tundra,  the frozen soil of which is fertile in little else than the lichen  known as reindeer moss, whilst to the west, as, for instance, in our  islands, moors and bogs represent this zone of barren lands in a milder  form.    The mountain belt is throughout its entire length the home of  round-headed peoples, the so-called Alpine race, which is generally  supposed to have originally come from the high plateau country of Asia.  These round-headed men in western Europe appear where-ever there are  hills, throwing out offshoots by way of the highlands of central France  into Brittany, and even reaching the British Isles. Here they  introduced the use of bronze (an invention possibly acquired by contact  with Egyptians in the near East), though without leaving any marked  traces of themselves amongst the permanent population. At the other  end of Europe they affected Greece by way of a steady though limited  infiltration; whilst in Asia Minor they issued forth from their hills  as the formidable Hittites, the people, by the way, to whom the Jews  are said to owe their characteristic, yet non-Semitic, noses. But are  these round-heads all of one race? Professor Ridgeway has put forward  a rather paradoxical theory to the effect that, just as the long-faced  Boer horse soon evolved in the mountains of Basutoland into a  round-headed pony, so it is in a few generations with human  mountaineers, irrespective of their breed. This is almost certainly  to overrate the effects of environment. At the same time, in the present  state of our knowledge, it would be premature either to affirm or deny  that in the very long run round-headedness goes with a mountain life.    The grassland next claims our attention. Here is the paradise of the  horse, and consequently of the horse-breaker. Hence, therefore, came  the charging multitudes of Asiatic marauders who, after many repulses,  broke through the Mediterranean cordon, and established themselves  as the modern Turks; whilst at the other end of their beat they poured  into China, which no great wall could avail to save, and established  the Manchu domination. Given the steppe-country and a horse-taming  people, we might seek, with the anthropo-geographers of the bolder  sort, to deduce the whole way of life, the nomadism, the ample food,  including the milk-diet infants need and find so hard to obtain farther  south, the communal system, the patriarchal type of authority, the  caravan-system that can set the whole horde moving along like a swarm  of locusts, and so on. But, as has been already pointed out, the horse  had to be tamed first. Palaeolithic man in western Europe had  horse-meat in abundance. At Solutre, a little north of Lyons, a heap  of food-refuse 100 yards long and 10 feet high largely consists of  the bones of horses, most of them young and tender. This shows that  the old hunters knew how to enjoy the passing hour in their improvident  way, like the equally reckless Bushmen, who have left similar Golgothas  behind them in South Africa. Yet apparently palaeolithic man did not  tame the horse. Environment, in fact, can only give the hint; and man  may not be ready to take it.    The forest-land of the north affords fair hunting in its way, but it  is doubtful if it is fitted to rear a copious brood of men, at any  rate so long as stone weapons are alone available wherewith to master  the vegetation and effect clearings, whilst burning the brushwood down  is precluded by the damp. Where the original home may have been of  the so-called Nordic race, the large-limbed fair men of the Teutonic  world, remains something of a mystery; though it is now the fashion  to place it in the north-east of Europe rather than in Asia, and to  suppose it to have been more or less isolated from the rest of the  world by formerly existing sheets of water. Where-ever it was, there  must have been grassland enough to permit of pastoral habits, modified,  perhaps, by some hunting on the one hand, and by some primitive  agriculture on the other. The Mediterranean men, coming from North  Africa, an excellent country for the horse, may have vied with the  Asiatics of the steppes in introducing a varied culture to the north.  At any rate, when the Germans of Tacitus emerge into the light of  history, they are not mere foresters, but rather woodlanders, men of  the glades, with many sides to their life; including an acquaintance  with the sea and its ways, surpassing by far that of those early  beachcombers whose miserable kitchen-middens are to be found along  the coast of Denmark.    Of the tundra it is enough to say that all depends on the reindeer.  This animal is the be-all and end-all of Lapp existence. When Nansen,  after crossing Greenland, sailed home with his two Lapps, he called  their attention to the crowds of people assembled to welcome them at  the harbour. \"Ah,\" said the elder and more thoughtful of the pair,  \"if they were only reindeer!\" When domesticated, the reindeer yields  milk as well as food, though large numbers are needed to keep the  community in comfort. Otherwise hunting and fishing must serve to eke  out the larder. Miserable indeed are the tribes or rather remnants  of tribes along the Siberian tundra who have no reindeer. On the other  hand, if there are plenty of wild reindeer, as amongst the Koryaks  and some of the Chukchis, hunting by itself suffices.           *       *       *       *       *    Let us now pass on from the Eurasian northland to what is, zoologically,  almost its annexe, North America; its tundra, for example, where the  Eskimo live, being strictly continuous with the Asiatic zone. Though  having a very different fauna and flora, South America presumably forms  part of the same geographical province so far as man is concerned,  though there is evidence for thinking that he reached it very early.  Until, however, more data are available for the pre-history of the  American Indian, the great moulding forces, geographical or other,  must be merely guessed at. Much turns on the period assigned to the  first appearance of man in this region; for that he is indigenous is  highly improbable, if only because no anthropoid apes are found here.  The racial type, which, with the exception of the Eskimo, and possibly  of the salmon-fishing tribes along the north-west coast, is one for  the whole continent, has a rather distant resemblance to that of the  Asiatic Mongols. Nor is there any difficulty in finding the immigrants  a means of transit from northern Asia. Even if it be held that the  land-bridge by way of what are now the Aleutian Islands was closed  at too early a date for man to profit by it, there is always the passage  over the ice by way of Behring Straits; which, if it bore the mammoth,  as is proved by its remains in Alaska, could certainly bear man.    Once man was across, what was the manner of his distribution?

Law's house was mobbed by people seeking  interviews with him, and nobles disguised themselves in liveries to get  access to him. Fortunes were made one week and lost the next, and  finally the whole plan proved to have been a mere baseless scheme; ruin  followed, and the misery of the country increased. The Duke of Orleans  died suddenly in 1723. The king was now legally of age; but he was dull  and backward, and little fitted for government, and the country was  really ruled by the Duke of Bourbon, and after him by Cardinal Fleury,  an aged statesman, but filled with the same schemes of ambition as  Richelieu or Mazarin.      13. War of the Austrian Succession.--Thus France plunged into new  wars. Louis XV. married the daughter of Stanislas Lecksinsky, a Polish  noble, who, after being raised to the throne, was expelled by Austrian  intrigues and violence. Louis was obliged to take up arms on behalf of  his father-in-law, but was bought off by a gift from the Emperor Charles  VI. of the duchy of Lorraine to Stanislas, to revert to his daughter  after his death and thus become united to France. Lorraine belonged to  Duke Francis, the husband of Maria Theresa, eldest daughter to the  Emperor, and Francis received instead the duchy of Tuscany; while all  the chief Powers in Europe agreed to the so-called Pragmatic Sanction,  by which Charles decreed that Maria Theresa should inherit Austria and  Hungary and the other hereditary states on her father's death, to the  exclusion of the daughters of his elder brother, Joseph. When Charles  VI. died, however, in 1740, a great European war began on this matter.  Frederick II. of Prussia would neither allow Maria Theresa's claim to  the hereditary states, nor join in electing her husband to the Empire;  and France took part against her, sending Marshal Belleisle to support  the Elector of Bavaria, who had been chosen Emperor. George II. of  England held with Maria Theresa, and gained a victory over the French at  Dettingen, in 1744. Louis XV. then joined his army, and the battle of  Fontenoy, in 1745, was one of the rare victories of France over England.  Another victory followed at Laufeldt, but elsewhere France had had heavy  losses, and in 1748, after the death of Charles VII., peace was made at  Aix-la-Chapelle.      14. The Seven Years' War.--Louis, dull and selfish by nature, had been  absolutely led into vice by his courtiers, especially the Duke of  Bourbon, who feared his becoming active in public affairs. He had no  sense of duty to his people; and whereas his great-grandfather had  sought display and so-called glory, he cared solely for pleasure, and  that of the grossest and most sensual order, so that his court was a  hotbed of shameless vice. All that could be wrung from the impoverished  country was lavished on the overgrown establishments of every member of  the royal family, in pensions to nobles, and in shameful amusements of  the king. In 1756 another war broke out, in consequence of the hatreds  left between Prussia and Austria by the former struggle. Maria Theresa  had, by flatteries she ought to have disdained, gained over France to  take part with her, and England was allied with Frederick II. In this  war France and England chiefly fought in their distant possessions,  where the English were uniformly successful; and after seven years  another peace followed, leaving the boundaries of the German states just  where they were before, after a frightful amount of bloodshed. But  France had had terrible losses. She was driven from India, and lost all  her settlements in America and Canada.      15. France under Louis XV.--Meantime the gross vice and licentiousness  of the king was beyond description, and the nobility retained about the  court by the system established by Louis XIV. were, if not his equals in  crime, equally callous to the suffering caused by the reckless  expensiveness of the court, the whole cost of which was defrayed by the  burghers and peasants. No taxes were asked from clergy or nobles, and  this latter term included all sprung of a noble line to the utmost  generation. The owner of an estate had no means of benefiting his  tenants, even if he wished it; for all matters, even of local  government, depended on the crown. All he could do was to draw his  income from them, and he was often forced, either by poverty or by his  expensive life, to strain to the utmost the old feudal system. If he  lived at court, his expenses were heavy, and only partly met by his  pension, likewise raised from the taxes paid by the poor farmer; if he  lived in the country, he was a still greater tyrant, and was called by  the people a _hobereau_, or kite. No career was open to his younger  sons, except in the court, the Church, or the army, and here they  monopolized the prizes, obtaining all the richer dioceses and abbeys,  and all the promotion in the army. The magistracies were almost all  hereditary among lawyers, who had bought them for their families from  the crown, and paid for the appointment of each son. The officials  attached to each member of the royal family were almost incredible in  number, and all paid by the taxes. The old _gabelle_, or salt-tax, had  gone on ever since the English wars, and every member of a family had to  pay it, not according to what they used, but what they were supposed to  need. Every pig was rated at what he ought to require for salting. Every  cow, sheep, or hen had a toll to pay to king, lord, bishop--sometimes  also to priest and abbey. The peasant was called off from his own work  to give the dues of labour to the roads or to his lord. He might not  spread manure that could interfere with the game, nor drive away the  partridges that ate his corn. So scanty were his crops that famines  slaying thousands passed unnoticed, and even if, by any wonder,  prosperity smiled on the peasant, he durst not live in any kind of  comfort, lest the stewards of his lord or of Government should pounce on  his wealth.      16. Reaction.--Meantime there was a strong feeling that change must  come. Classical literature was studied, and Greek and Roman manners and  institutions were thought ideal perfection. There was great disgust at  the fetters of a highly artificial life in which every one was bound,  and at the institutions which had been so misused. Writers arose, among  whom Voltaire and Rousseau were the most eminent, who aimed at the  overthrow of all the ideas which had come to be thus abused. The one by  his caustic wit, the other by his enthusiastic simplicity, gained  willing ears, and, the writers in a great Encyclopaedia then in course of  publication, contrived to attack most of the notions which had been  hitherto taken for granted, and were closely connected with faith and  with government. The king himself was dully aware that he was living on  the crust of a volcano, but he said it would last his time; and so it  did. Louis XV. died of smallpox in 1774, leaving his grandsons to reap  the harvest that generations had been sowing.          CHAPTER VII.    THE REVOLUTION.      1. Attempts at Reform.--It was evident that a change must be made.  _Louis XVI._ himself knew it, and slurred over the words in his  coronation oath that bound him to extirpate heresy; but he was a slow,  dull man, and affairs had come to such a pass that a far abler man than  he could hardly have dealt with the dead-lock above, without causing a  frightful outbreak of the pent-up masses below. His queen, Marie  Antoinette, was hated for being of Austrian birth, and, though a  spotless and noble woman, her most trivial actions gave occasion to  calumnies founded on the crimes of the last generation. Unfortunately,  the king, though an honest and well-intentioned man, was totally unfit  to guide a country through a dangerous crisis. His courage was passive,  his manners were heavy, dull, and shy, and, though steadily industrious,  he was slow of comprehension and unready in action; and reformation was  the more difficult because to abolish the useless court offices would  have been utter starvation to many of their holders, who had nothing but  their pensions to live upon. Yet there was a general passion for reform;  all ranks alike looked to some change to free them from the dead-lock  which made improvement impossible. The Government was bankrupt, while  the taxes were intolerable, and the first years of the reign were spent  in experiments. Necker, a Swiss banker, was invited to take the charge  of the finances, and large loans were made to Government, for which he  contrived to pay interest regularly; some reduction was made in the  expenditure; but the king's old minister, Maurepas, grew jealous of his  popularity, and obtained his dismissal. The French took the part of the  American colonies in their revolt from England, and the war thus  occasioned brought on an increase of the load of debt, the general  distress increased, and it became necessary to devise some mode of  taxing which might divide the burthens between the whole nation, instead  of making the peasants pay all and the nobles and clergy nothing. Louis  decided on calling together the Notables, or higher nobility; but they  were by no means disposed to tax themselves, and only abused his  ministers. He then resolved on convoking the whole States-General of the  kingdom, which had never met since the reign of Louis XIII.      2. The States-General.--No one exactly knew the limits of the powers  of the States-General when it met in 1789. Nobles, clergy, and the  deputies who represented the commonalty, all formed the assembly at  Versailles; and though the king would have kept apart these last, who  were called the _Tiers Etat_, or third estate, they refused to withdraw  from the great hall of Versailles. The Count of Mirabeau, the younger  son of a noble family, who sat as a deputy, declared that nothing short  of"]]]
