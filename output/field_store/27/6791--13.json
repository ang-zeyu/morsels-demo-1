Hungarians resented the stain upon their honour of the _Ancona_  incident and they were on the verge of compelling Berlin to assume  responsibility for the sinking and adjust the matter.  But Berlin  feared that if the _Ancona_ crime was accredited to the real murderers  it would bring about another, and perhaps a fatal crisis with the  United States.  So Vienna assumed responsibility and promised to punish  the submarine commander who torpedoed the ship.    This opposition from Hungary embittered the German Navy but it was  helpless.  The growing fear of the effects which President Wilson's  notes were having upon Americans and upon the outside neutral world  caused opposition to von Tirpitz to gain more force.  In desperation  von Tirpitz and his followers extended the anti-American propaganda and  began personal attacks upon von Bethmann-Hollweg.    Bitterness between these two men became so great that neither of them  would go to the Great Headquarters to confer with the Kaiser if the  other was there.  The personal opposition reached the point where the  Kaiser could not keep both men in his cabinet.  Von Tirpitz, who  thought he was the hero of the German people because of the submarine  policy, believed he had so much power that he could shake the hold  which the Kaiser had upon the people and frighten the Emperor into the  belief that unless he supported him against the Chancellor and the  United States, the people would overthrow the Hohenzollern dynasty.  But von Tirpitz had made a good many personal enemies especially among  financiers and business men.  So the Kaiser, instead of ousting the  Chancellor, asked von Tirpitz to resign and appointed Admiral von  Capelle, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy and a friend of the  Chancellor, as von Tirpitz' successor.  Admiral von Mueller, Chief of  the Naval Cabinet, who was always at Great Headquarters as the Kaiser's  personal adviser on naval affairs, was opposed to von Tirpitz and  exposed him at the Great Headquarters conferences by saying that von  Tirpitz had falsified the Navy's figures as to the number of submarines  available for a blockade of England.  Von Capelle supported von Mueller  and when the friends of von Tirpitz in the Reichstag demanded an  explanation for the ousting of their idol, both the Chancellor and von  Capelle explained that Germany could not continue submarine warfare  which von Tirpitz had started, because of the lack of the necessary  submarines.    This was the first big victory of the Foreign Office.  The democratic  forces in Germany which had been fighting von Tirpitz for over a year  were jubilant.  Every one in Germany who realised that not until the  hold of the military party upon the Kaiser and the Government was  dislodged, would the Government be able to make peace now breathed  sighs of relief and began to make plans for the adjustment of all  differences with the United States and for a peace without annexation.  Von Tirpitz had had the support of all the forces in Germany which  looked forward to the annexation of Belgium and the richest portions of  Northern France.  Von Tirpitz was supported by the men who wanted the  eastern border of Germany extended far into Poland and Lithuania.    Even Americans were delighted.  Washington for the first time began to  see that eleven months of patience was bearing fruit.  But this period  of exaltation was not destined to last very long.  While the Chancellor  had cleaned house in the Navy Department at Berlin he had overlooked  Kiel.  There were admirals and officers in charge there who were making  preparations for the Navy.  They were the men who talked to the  submarine commanders before they started out on their lawless sea  voyages.    On March 24th the whole world was shocked by another U-boat crime.  The  _Sussex_, a French channel steamer, plying between Folkstone and  Dieppe, was torpedoed without warning and Americans were among the  passengers killed and wounded.  When the news reached Berlin, not only  the Chancellor and the Foreign Office were shocked and horrified, but  the American Embassy began to doubt whether the Chancellor really meant  what he said when he informed Gerard confidentially that now that von  Tirpitz was gone there would be no new danger from the submarines.  Even the new Admiralty administration was loathe to believe that a  German submarine was responsible.    By April 5th it was apparent to every one in Berlin that there would be  another submarine crisis with the United States and that the  reactionary forces in Germany would attempt again to overthrow the  Chancellor.  Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, who had been doing everything  possible to get some one to propose peace, decided to address the  Reichstag again on Germany's peace aims.  It was announced in the  newspapers only a few days beforehand.  The demand for tickets of  admission was so great that early in the morning on the day scheduled  for the address such dense crowds surrounded the Reichstag building  that the police had to make passages so the military automobiles could  reach the building to bring the officials there.    The Chamber itself was crowded to the rafters.  On the floor of the  House practically every member was in his seat.  On the rostrum were  several hundred army and naval officers, all members of the cabinet,  prominent business men and financiers.  Every one awaited the entrance  of the Chancellor with great expectations.  The National Liberals, who  had been clamouring for the annexation of Belgium, the conservatives,  who wanted a stronger war policy against England, the Socialists, who  wanted real guarantees for the German people for the future and a peace  without annexation, sat quietly in their seats anxiously awaiting the  Chancellor's remarks which were expected to satisfy all wants.    The Chancellor entered the chamber from the rear of the rostrum and  proceeded to his desk in the front platform row, facing the House and  galleries.  After a few preliminary remarks by President Kaempf, the  Chancellor arose.  To the Chancellor's left, near the rear of the hall  among his Socialist colleagues, sat a nervous, determined and defiant  radical.  He was dressed in the uniform of a common soldier.  Although  he had been at the front several months and in the firing line, he had  not received the iron cross of the second class which practically every  soldier who had seen service had been decorated with.  His clothes were  soiled, trousers stuffed into the top of heavy military boots.  His  thick, curly hair was rumpled.  At this session of the Reichstag the  Chancellor was to have his first encounter with Dr. Karl Liebknecht,  the Socialist radical, who in his soldier's uniform was ready to  challenge anything the Chancellor said.    The Chancellor began his address, as he began all others, by referring  to the strong military position of the German army.  He led up,  gradually, to the subject of peace.  When the Chancellor said: \"We  could have gotten what we wanted by peaceful work.  Our enemies chose  war.\"  Liebknecht interjected in his sharp, shrill voice, \"_You_ chose  the war!\"  There was great excitement and hissing; the President called  for order.  Members shouted: \"Throw him out!\"  But Liebknecht sat there  more determined than ever.    The Chancellor continued for a few minutes until he reached the  discussion of the establishment of a Flemish nation in Belgium, when  Liebknecht again interrupted, but the Chancellor continued: \"Gentlemen,  we want neighbours who will not again unite against us in order to  strangle us, but such that we can work with them and they with us to  our mutual advantage.\"  A storm of applause greeted this remark.  Liebknecht was again on his feet and shouted, \"Then you will fall upon  them!\"    \"The Europe which will arise from this, the most gigantic of all  crises, will in many respects not resemble the old one,\" continued von  Bethmann-Hollweg.  \"The blood which has been shed will never come back;  the wealth which has been wasted will come back but only slowly.  In  any case, it must become, for all living in it, a Europe of peaceful  labour.  The peace which shall end this war must be a lasting one and  not containing the germ of a fresh war, but establishing a final and  peaceful order of things in European affairs.\"    Before the applause had gotten a good start the fiery private in the  Socialists' rank was again on his feet, this time shouting, \"Liberate  the German people first!\"    Throughout the Chancellor's speech there was not one reference to the  Sussex.  The Chancellor was anxious if he could to turn the world's  attention from the Sussex to the larger question of peace, but the  world was not so inclined.  On the 18th of April I asked Admiral von  Holtzendorff, Chief of the Admiralty Staff, for his opinion about the  _Sussex_.  Two days later he approved the interview, in which I quoted  him as saying:      \"We did not sink the _Sussex_.  I am as convinced of that as of  anything which has happened in this war.  If you read the definite  instructions, the exact orders each submarine commander has you would  understand that the torpedoing of the _Sussex_ was impossible.  Many of  our submarines have returned from rounding up British vessels.  They  sighted scores of passenger ships going between England and America but  not one of these was touched.    \"We have definitely agreed to warn the crews and passengers of  passenger liners.  We have lived up to that promise in every way.  We  are not out to torpedo without warning neutral ships bound for England.  Our submarines have respected every one of them so far, and they have  met scores in the North Sea, the Channel and the Atlantic.\"      On the same day that Ambassador Gerard handed von Jagow Secretary  Lansing's note, Under Secretary of State Zimmermann"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15777"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World, Volume 1 (#14)"],[1,"time, observed the sea to be smooth when the wind  blew in that direction. Athough this was not conformable to the remarks  _we_ had made on the sea, I resolved to clear up the point, if the wind  would admit of my getting to the west in any reasonable time.    At eight o'clock in the morning of the 3d, being in the latitude of 48 deg. 56'  S. longitude 60 deg. 47' E., and upwards of 8 deg. to the east of the meridian of  the Mauritius, I began to despair of finding land to the east; and as the  wind had now veered to the north, resolved to search for it to the west. I  accordingly tacked and stood to the west with a fresh gale. This increased  in such a manner, that, before night, we were reduced to our two courses;  and, at last, obliged to lie-to under the fore-sails, having a prodigious  high sea from W.N.W., notwithstanding the height of the gale was from N. by  W. At three o'clock the next morning, the gale abating, we made sail, and  continued to ply to the west till ten o'clock in the morning of the 6th.    At this time, being in the latitude of 48 deg. 6' S., longitude 58 deg. 22' E., the  wind seemingly fixed at W.N.W., and seeing no signs of meeting with land, I  gave over plying, and bore away east a little southerly: Being satisfied,  that if there is any land hereabout, it can only be an isle of no great  extent. And it was just as probable I might have found it to the E. as to  the W.    While we were plying about here we took every opportunity to observe the  variation of the compass, and found it to be from 27 deg. 50' to 30 deg. 26' W.  Probably the mean of the two extremes, viz. 29 deg. 4', is the nearest the  truth, as it nearly agrees with the variation observed on board the  Adventure. In making these observations, we found that, when the sun was on  the larboard side of the ship, the variation was the least; and when on the  starboard side, the greatest. This was not the first time we had made this  observation, without being able to account for it. At four o'clock in the  morning of the 7th, I made the Adventure's signal to keep at the distance  of four miles on my starboard beam; and continued to steer E.S.E. This  being a fine day, I had all our men's bedding and clothes spread on deck to  air; and the ship cleaned and smoked betwixt decks. At noon I steered a  point more to the south, being then in the latitude of 45 deg. 49' S.,  longitude 61 deg. 48' E. At six o'clock in the evening, I called in the  Adventure; and at the same time took several azimuths, which gave the  variation 31 deg. 28'.W. These observations could not be taken with the  greatest accuracy, on account of the rolling of the ship, occasioned by a  very high westerly swell.    The preceding evening, three Port Egmont hens were seen; this morning  another appeared. In the evening, and several times in the night, penguins  were heard; and, at daylight in the morning of the 8th, several of these  were seen; and divers of two sorts, seemingly such as are usually met with  on the coast of England. This occasioned us to sound, but we found no  ground with a line of 210 fathoms. Our latitude now was 49 deg. 53' S., and  longitude 63 deg. 39' E. This was at eight o'clock. By this time the wind had  veered round by the N.E. to E., blew a brisk gale, and was attended with  hazy weather, which soon after turned to a thick fog; and, at the same  tine, the wind shifted to N.E.    I continued to keep the wind on the larboard tack, and to fire a gun every  hour till noon; when I made the signal to tack, and tacked accordingly.  But, as neither this signal, nor any of the former, was answered by the  Adventure, we had but too much reason to think that a separation had taken  place; though we were at a loss to tell how it had been effected. I had  directed Captain Furneaux, in case he was separated from me, to cruise  three days in the place where he last saw me. I therefore continued making  short boards, and firing half-hour guns, till the 9th in the afternoon,  when, the weather having cleared up, we could see several leagues round us,  and found that the Adventure was not within the limits of our horizon. At  this time we were about two or three leagues to the eastward of the  situation we were in when we last saw her; and were standing to the  westward with a very strong gale at N.N.W., accompanied with a great sea  from the same direction. This, together, with an increase of wind, obliged  us to lie-to till eight o'clock the next morning, during which time we saw  nothing of the Adventure, notwithstanding the weather was pretty clear, and  we had kept firing guns, and burning false fires, all night. I therefore  gave over looking for her, made sail, and steered S.E., with a very fresh  gale at W. by N., accompanied with a high sea from the same direction.    While we were beating about here; we frequently saw penguins and divers,  which made us conjecture the land was not far off; but in what direction it  was not possible for us to tell. As we advanced to the south, we lost the  penguins, and most of the divers; and, as usual, met with abundance of  albatrosses, blue peterels, sheer-waters, &c.    The 11th, at noon, and in the latitude of 51 deg. 15' S., longitude 67 deg. 20' E.,  we again met with penguins: and saw an egg bird, which we also look upon to  be a sign of the vicinity of land. I continued to steer to the S.E., with a  fresh gale in the north-west quarter, attended with a long hollow swell,  and frequent showers of rain, hail, and snow. The 12th, in the morning,  being in the latitude of 52 deg. 32' S., longitude 69 deg. 47' E., the variation  was 31 deg. 38' W. In the evening, in the latitude of 53 deg. 7' S., longitude 70 deg.  50' E., it was 32 deg. 33'; and, the next morning, in the latitude of 53 deg. 37'  S., longitude 72 deg. 10', it was 33 deg. 8' W. Thus far we had continually a great  number of penguins about the ship, which seemed to be different from those  we had seen near the ice; being smaller, with reddish bills and brownish  heads. The meeting with so many of these birds, gave us some hopes of  finding land, and occasioned various conjectures about its situation. The  great westerly swell, which still continued, made it improbable that land  of any considerable extent lay to the west. Nor was it very probable that  any lay to the north; as we were only about 160 leagues to the south of  Tasman's track in 1642; and I conjectured that Captain Furneaux would  explore this place; which accordingly happened. In the evening we saw a  Port Egmont hen, which flew away in the direction of N.E. by E., and the  next morning a seal was seen; but no penguins. In the evening, being in the  latitude of 55 deg. 49' S., longitude 75 deg. 52' E., the variation was 34 deg. 48' W.,  and, in the evening of the 15th, in latitude 57 deg. 2' S., longitude 79 deg. 56'  E., it was 38 deg. W. Five seals were seen this day, and a few penguins; which  occasioned us to sound, without finding any bottom, with a line of 150  fathoms.    At day-light in the morning of the 16th, we saw an island of ice to the  northward; for which we steered, in order to take some on board; but the  wind shifting to that direction, hindered us from putting this in  execution. At this time we were in the latitude of 57 deg. 8' S., longitude 80 deg.  59' E., and had two islands of ice in sight. This morning we saw one  penguin, which appeared to be of the same sort which we had formerly seen  near the ice. But we had now been so often deceived by these birds, that we  could no longer look upon them, nor indeed upon any other oceanic birds,  which frequent high latitudes, as sure signs of the vicinity of land.    The wind continued not long at north, but veered to E. by N.E., and blew a  gentle gale, with which we stood to the southward; having frequent showers  of sleet and snow. But, in the night, we had fair weather, and a clear  serene sky; and, between midnight and three o'clock in the morning, lights  were seen in the heavens, similar to those in the northern hemisphere,  known by the name of Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights; but I never heard  of the Aurora Australia been seen before. The officer of the watch observed  that it sometimes broke out in spiral rays, and in a circular form; then  its light was very strong, and its appearance beautiful. He could not  perceive it had any particular direction; for it appeared, at various  times, in different parts of the heavens, and diffused its light throughout  the whole atmosphere.    At nine in the morning, we bore down to an island of ice which we reached  by noon. It was full half a mile in circuit, and two hundred feet high at  least, though very little loose ice about it. But while we were considering  whether or no we should hoist out our boats to take some up, a great  quantity broke from the island. Upon this we hoisted out our boats, and  went to work to get some on board. The pieces of ice, both great and small,  which broke from the island, I observed, drifted fast to the westward; that  is, they left the island in that direction, and were, in a few hours,  spread over a large space of sea. This, I have no doubt, was caused by a  current setting in that direction. For the wind could have but little  effect upon the ice; especially as there was a large hollow swell from the  west. This circumstance greatly retarded our taking up ice. We, however,  made a shift to get on board about nine or ten tons before eight o'clock,  when we hoisted in the boats and made sail to the east, inclining to the  south, with a fresh gale at south; which, soon after, veered to S.S.W. and  S.W., with fair but cloudy weather. This course brought us among many ice  isles; so that it was necessary to proceed with great caution. In the night  the mercury in the thermometer fell two degrees below the freezing point;  and the water in the scuttle casks on deck was frozen. As I have not taken  notice of"]]]
