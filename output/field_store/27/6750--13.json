Will you?\"    \"Yes, Aunt Zoe, of course, if you want me,\" answered the boy promptly,  stopping his saw and springing to his feet, for he was much gratified by  the invitation. \"I'll get ready as fast as I can; 'twon't take over five  minutes.\"    \"Thank you. I'll wait for you in the parlor,\" said Zoe, \"Lulu, would you  like to go, too?\"    \"No, thank you, I had a ride this morning, and now I want to finish this.\"    Max had left the room, and Zoe, drawing nearer to Lulu, exclaimed at the  beauty of her work.    \"Why, I never should have dreamed you could do it so well!\" she said. \"I  don't believe I could.\"    Lulu's face flushed with pleasure, but she said modestly, \"Perhaps you'd  find, if you should try, that you could do it better; you do everything  else better than I do.\"    \"Quite a mistake,\" returned Zoe, \"though I ought to, as I'm so much older.  But there, I dare say Max is ready and waiting for me, so good-by.\"    They met in the lower hall. \"All ready, Max?\" she asked.    \"Yes--no; I must ask leave,\" and he ran into the parlor where the ladies  of the family were sitting.    It was of Grandma Elsie he asked permission, and it was given at once.    \"Thank you, ma'am,\" he said. \"Can I do anything for you in the town,  ladies?\"    \"Yes,\" said Violet, \"I have just broken a crochet needle. You may get me  one to replace it.\"    She went on to give him directions about the size and where he would be  likely to find it; then taking some money from her purse, \"This is sure to  be more than enough,\" she said, \"but you may keep the change.\"    \"Mamma Vi, I don't want pay for doing an errand for you,\" returned the boy  coloring; \"it is a great pleasure, it would be even if papa had not told  me to wait on you and do all I could to fill his place.\"    \"I don't mean it as pay, my dear boy,\" Violet answered, with a pleased  look, \"but haven't I a right to make a little present now and then to the  children who call me mamma?\"    Max's face brightened.    \"Yes, ma'am, I suppose so,\" he said. \"Thank you; I'll take it willingly  enough if it isn't pay, and I'm very proud to be trusted to buy something  for you.\"    Edward was helping Zoe into the saddle as Max came hurrying out.    \"Take good care of her, Max,\" he said, \"I'm trusting you and Tom there  with my chiefest treasure.\"    \"I'll do my best,\" Max said, mounting his pony, which Tom the colored boy  was holding.    \"Me, too, Marse Ed'ard, dere shan't nuffin hurt Miss Zoe,\" added the  latter, giving Max the bridle, then mounting a third horse and falling  behind the others as they cantered down the avenue.    A little beyond the gate the family carriage passed them, Mr. Dinsmore and  a strange gentleman inside.    \"Company,\" remarked Zoe. \"I wonder who he is, and if he's come to stay any  time? I think grandpa drove into the city in season to meet the afternoon  train.\"    \"Yes, I know he did,\" said Max.    Max had now learned to ride quite well, and felt himself very nearly a man  as he escorted Zoe to the village, and, arrived there, went with her from  store to store, executed Violet's commission, then having assisted Zoe  into the saddle remounted, and returned with her to Ion.    It was very near the tea hour when they reached home. Zoe went directly to  her own apartments to change her dress, but Max, without even waiting to  take off his overcoat, hastened into the parlor to hand the crochet needle  to Violet.    The ladies were all there, Rosie, too, and Mr. Dinsmore, and an elderly  gentleman, whom Max at once recognized as the one he had seen in the  carriage that afternoon.    He shook hands very kindly with the boy as Mr. Dinsmore introduced them,  \"Cousin Ronald this is Max Raymond--Mr. Lilburn, Max.\"    \"Ah ha, ah ha! um, h'm! ah ha! A fine-looking lad,\" Mr. Lilburn said,  still holding the boy's hand in a kindly grasp, and gazing with evident  interest into the bright young face. \"I trust you and I are going to be  good friends, Max. I'm no so young myself as I once was, but I like the  company of the blithe young lads and lasses.\"    \"Thank you, sir,\" said Max, coloring with pleasure. \"Rosie says you tell  splendid stories about Wallace and the Bruce and Robin Hood and his merry  men; and I know I shall enjoy them ever so much.\"    As he finished his sentence Max colored more deeply than before, at the  same time hastily thrusting his right hand deep into the pocket on that  side of his overcoat, for a peculiar sound like the cry of a young puppy  seemed to come from it at that instant, much to the boy's discomfiture and  astonishment.    \"What is that? What have you got there, Max?\" asked little Walter,  pricking up his ears, while Violet asked with an amused look, \"Have you  been making an investment in livestock, Max?\"    A query that seemed all the more natural and appropriate as the cluck of a  hen came from the pocket on the other side of the overcoat.    Down went the left hand into that. \"No, Mamma Vi, they're not in my  pockets,\" returned the boy, with a look of great bewilderment.    \"No, to be sure not,\" said Mr. Lilburn, and the hen clucked behind  Violet's chair and the pup's cry was heard coming from underneath a heap  of crocheting in Mrs. Dinsmore's lap, fairly startling her into uttering a  little cry of surprise and dismay and springing to her feet.    Then everybody laughed, Rosie clapping her hands with delight, and Max  glanced from one to another more mystified than ever.    \"Never mind, Max,\" said Violet, \"it's plain you are not the culprit who  brought such unwelcome intruders here. Run up to your room now and make  yourself ready for tea.\"    Max obeyed, but looking back from the doorway, asked, \"Shall I send one of  the servants to turn out the hen and carry away the pup?\"    \"Never mind, we'll attend to it,\" said Mr. Dinsmore.    \"I'll find 'em. I can carry that pup out,\" said Walter, getting down from  his grandpa's knee and beginning a vigorous search for it, the older  people watching him with much amusement.    At length, having satisfied himself that neither it nor the hen was in the  room, he concluded that they must be in Max's overcoat pockets, and told  him so the moment he returned.    \"No, they are not, unless some one has put them there since I went  up-stairs,\" said Max. \"But I don't believe in them, Walter. I think they  were only make believe.\"    \"How make believe?\" asked the little fellow in perplexity.    \"Ask Mr. Lilburn.\"    \"Come, explain yourself, young man,\" said that gentleman laughingly.    \"I've heard of ventriloquists, sir,\" said Max. \"I don't know if you are  one, but as pup and hen could only be heard and not seen, I think it must  have been a ventriloquist's work.\"    \"But you don't know for certain,\" said Rosie, coming to his side, \"and  please don't say anything to Zoe, or Lulu, or Gracie about it.\"    \"I won't,\" he said, as the door opened and the three entered, Zoe having  overtaken the two little girls on their way down-stairs after being  dressed for the evening by the careful and expert Agnes.    \"Mamma, do I look nice enough for your little girl?\" asked Gracie, going  to Violet's side.    \"Very nice and sweet, my darling,\" was the whispered reply, accompanied by  a tender caress.    Walter, hardly waiting until the necessary introductions were over, burst  out eagerly, \"Zoe, do you know where that pup is?\"    \"What pup?\" she asked.    \"I don't know his name.\"    \"Well, what about him?\"    \"I thought he was in Max's pocket, but he wasn't, and neither was the  hen.\"    The tea-bell rang at that instant, and Rosie, putting her lips to Walter's  ear, whispered, \"Do keep quiet about it, and we'll have some fun.\"    \"Will we?\" he asked with a look of mingled wonder and pleasure; \"then I'll  keep quiet.\"    All through the meal Walter was on the _qui vive_ for the fun, but there  was none beyond a few jests and pleasantries which were by no means  unusual in their cheerful family circle.    \"There wasn't a bit of fun, Rosie,\" he complained to her after all had  returned to the parlor.    \"Wait a little,\" she answered, \"perhaps it will come yet.\"    \"Before I have to go to bed?\"    \"I hope so. Suppose you go and tell Cousin Ronald you want some fun. He  knows how to make it. But be sure to whisper it in his ear.\"    Walter did as directed.    \"Wait a wee, bairnie, and see what will happen,\" Cousin Ronald answered in  an undertone, and with a low pleasant laugh as he lifted the little fellow  to his knee.    Mr. Dinsmore sat near at hand, the ladies had gathered about the  centre-table with their work, while Lester Leland and Edward Travilla  hovered near their wives, the one with a newspaper, the other merely  watching the busy fingers of the fair workers and making jesting comments  upon what they were doing.    But presently there was a sudden commotion in their midst, one after  another springing from her chair with a little startled cry and trying to  dodge what, from the sound, seemed to be an enormous bumble bee circling  round and round their heads and in and out among them. \"Buzz! buzz! buzz!\"  surely never bumble bee buzzed so loud before.    \"Oh, catch it! kill it, Edward!\" cried Zoe, with a half frantic rush to  the farther side of the room. \"Oh, here it comes after me! It's settling  on my hair! Oh!\"    \"No, dear, it isn't, there is really nothing there,\" Edward said  soothingly, yet with a laugh, for a second thought had told him the real  cause of the disturbance.    \"I believe it's gone,\" she said, drawing a long breath of relief, as she  turned her head this way and that, \"but where did it go to? and how  strange for one to be flying about this time of year!\"    The other ladies exchanging amused glances and smiles, were drawing round  the table again when a loud \"cluck, cluck\" came from beneath it.    \"Oh, there she is! there's the old hen Max brought!\" cried Walter,  springing from Mr. Lilburn's knee to run to the table.    Stooping down he peeped"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14916"],[0,"Fairy Tales Every Child Should Know (#14)"],[1,"her again, and directed his  vizier to have her brought before him.    After having prostrated herself, she made answer, in reply to the  sultan: \"Sire, I come at the end of three months to ask of you the  fulfillment of the promise you made to my son.\" The sultan little  thought the request of Aladdin's mother was made to him in earnest, or  that he would hear any more of the matter. He therefore took counsel  with his vizier, who suggested that the sultan should attach such  conditions to the marriage that no one of the humble condition of  Aladdin could possibly fulfill. In accordance with this suggestion of  the vizier, the sultan replied to the mother of Aladdin: \"Good woman, it  is true sultans ought to abide by their word, and I am ready to keep  mine, by making your son happy in marriage with the princess my  daughter. But as I cannot marry her without some further proof of your  son being able to support her in royal state, you may tell him I will  fulfill my promise as soon as he shall send me forty trays of massy  gold, full of the same sort of jewels you have already made me a present  of, and carried by the like number of black slaves, who shall be led by  as many young and handsome white slaves, all dressed magnificently. On  these conditions I am ready to bestow the princess my daughter upon him;  therefore, good woman, go and tell him so, and I will wait till you  bring me his answer.\"    Aladdin's mother prostrated herself a second time before the sultan's  throne, and retired. On her way home, she laughed within herself at her  son's foolish imagination. \"Where,\" said she, \"can he get so many large  gold trays, and such precious stones to fill them? It is altogether out  of his power, and I believe he will not be much pleased with my embassy  this time.\" When she came home, full of these thoughts, she told Aladdin  all the circumstances of her interview with the sultan, and the  conditions on which he consented to the marriage. \"The sultan expects  your answer immediately,\" said she; and then added, laughing, \"I believe  he may wait long enough!\"    \"Not so long, mother, as you imagine,\" replied Aladdin, \"This demand is  a mere trifle, and will prove no bar to my marriage with the princess. I  will prepare at once to satisfy his request.\"    Aladdin retired to his own apartment and summoned the genie of the lamp,  and required him to prepare and present the gift immediately, before the  sultan closed his morning audience, according to the terms in which it  had been prescribed. The genie professed his obedience to the owner of  the lamp, and disappeared. Within a very short time, a train of forty  black slaves, led by the same number of white slaves, appeared opposite  the house in which Aladdin lived. Each black slave carried on his head a  basin of massy gold, full of pearls, diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.  Aladdin then addressed his mother: \"Madam, pray lose no time; before the  sultan and the divan rise, I would have you return to the palace with  this present as the dowry demanded for the princess, that he may judge  by my diligence and exactness of the ardent and sincere desire I have to  procure myself the honour of this alliance.\"    As soon as this magnificent procession, with Aladdin's mother at its  head, had begun to march from Aladdin's house, the whole city was filled  with the crowds of people desirous to see so grand a sight. The graceful  bearing, elegant form, and wonderful likeness of each slave; their grave  walk at an equal distance from each other, the lustre of their jewelled  girdles, and the brilliancy of the aigrettes of precious stones in their  turbans, excited the greatest admiration in the spectators. As they had  to pass through several streets to the palace, the whole length of the  way was lined with files of spectators. Nothing, indeed, was ever seen  so beautiful and brilliant in the sultan's palace, and the richest robes  of the emirs of his court were not to be compared to the costly dresses  of these slaves, whom they supposed to be kings.    As the sultan, who had been informed of their approach, had given orders  for them to be admitted, they met with no obstacle, but went into the  divan in regular order, one part turning to the right and the other to  the left. After they were all entered, and had formed a semicircle  before the sultan's throne, the black slaves laid the golden trays on  the carpet, prostrated themselves, touching the carpet with their  foreheads, and at the same time the white slaves did the same. When they  rose, the black slaves uncovered the trays, and then all stood with  their arms crossed over their breasts.    In the mean time, Aladdin's mother advanced to the foot of the throne,  and having prostrated herself, said to the sultan, \"Sire, my son knows  this present is much below the notice of Princess Buddir al Buddoor; but  hopes, nevertheless, that your majesty will accept of it, and make it  agreeable to the princess, and with the greater confidence since he has  endeavoured to conform to the conditions you were pleased to impose.\"    The sultan, overpowered at the sight of such more than royal  magnificence, replied without hesitation to the words of Aladdin's  mother: \"Go and tell your son that I wait with open arms to embrace him;  and the more haste he makes to come and receive the princess my daughter  from my hands, the greater pleasure he will do me.\" As soon as Aladdin's  mother had retired, the sultan put an end to the audience; and rising  from his throne ordered that the princess's attendants should come and  carry the trays into their mistress's apartment, whither he went himself  to examine them with her at his leisure. The fourscore slaves were  conducted into the palace; and the sultan, telling the princess of their  magnificent apparel, ordered them to be brought before her apartment,  that she might see through the lattices he had not exaggerated in his  account of them.    In the meantime Aladdin's mother reached home, and showed in her air and  countenance the good news she brought to her son. \"My son,\" said she,  \"you may rejoice you are arrived at the height of your desires. The  sultan has declared that you shall marry the Princess Buddir al Buddoor.  He waits for you with impatience.\"    Aladdin, enraptured with this news, made his mother very little reply,  but retired to his chamber. There he rubbed his lamp, and the obedient  genie appeared. \"Genie,\" said Aladdin, \"convey me at once to a bath, and  supply me with the richest and most magnificent robe ever worn by a  monarch.\" No sooner were the words out of his mouth than the genie  rendered him, as well as himself, invisible, and transported him into a  bath of the finest marble of all sorts of colours; where he was  undressed, without seeing by whom, in a magnificent and spacious hall.  He was then well rubbed and washed with various scented waters. After he  had passed through several degrees of heat, he came out quite a  different man from what he was before. His skin was clear as that of a  child, his body lightsome and free; and when he returned into the hall,  he found, instead of his own poor raiment, a robe, the magnificence of  which astonished him. The genie helped him to dress, and when he had  done, transported him back to his own chamber, where he asked him if he  had any other commands. \"Yes,\" answered Aladdin, \"bring me a charger  that surpasses in beauty and goodness the best in the sultan's stables;  with a saddle, bridle, and other caparisons to correspond with his  value. Furnish also twenty slaves, as richly clothed as those who  carried the present to the sultan, to walk by my side and follow me, and  twenty more to go before me in two ranks. Besides these, bring my mother  six women slaves to attend her, as richly dressed at least as any of the  Princess Buddir al Buddoor's, each carrying a complete dress fit for any  sultaness. I want also ten thousand pieces of gold in ten purses; go,  and make haste.\"    As soon as Aladdin had given these orders, the genie disappeared, but  presently returned with the horse, the forty slaves, ten of whom carried  each a purse containing ten thousand pieces of gold, and six women  slaves, each carrying on her head a different dress for Aladdin's  mother, wrapt up in a piece of silver tissue, and presented them all to  Aladdin.    He presented the six women slaves to his mother, telling her they were  her slaves, and that the dresses they had brought were for her use. Of  the ten purses Aladdin took four, which he gave to his mother, telling  her, those were to supply her with necessaries; the other six he left in  the hands of the slaves who brought them, with an order to throw them by  handfuls among the people as they went to the sultan's palace. The six  slaves who carried the purses he ordered likewise to march before him,  three on the right hand and three on the left.    When Aladdin had thus prepared himself for his first interview with the  sultan, he dismissed the genie, and immediately mounting his charger,  began his march, and though he never was on horseback before, appeared  with a grace the most experienced horseman might envy. The innumerable  concourse of people through whom he passed made the air echo with their  acclamations, especially every time the six slaves who carried the  purses threw handfuls of gold among the populace.    On Aladdin's arrival at the palace, the sultan was surprised to find him  more richly and magnificently robed than he had ever been himself, and  was impressed with his good looks and dignity of manner, which were so  different from what he expected in the son of one so humble as Aladdin's  mother. He embraced him with all the demonstrations of joy, and when he  would have fallen at his feet, held him by the hand, and made him sit  near his throne. He shortly after led him amidst the sounds of trumpets,  hautboys, and all kinds of music, to "]]]
