First,  every girl had to sort a pack of 48 cards into 4 piles as quickly as  possible. The time was measured in fifths of a second. The following  experiment which referred to the accuracy of movement impulses  demanded that every one try to reach with the point of a pencil 3  different points on the table in the rhythm of metronome beats. On  each of these three places a sheet of paper was fixed with a fine  cross in the middle. The pencil should hit the crossing point, and the  marks on the paper indicated how far the movement had fallen short of  the goal. One of these movements demanded the full extension of the  arm and the other two had to be made with half-bent arm. I introduced  this last test because the hitting of the right holes in the  switchboard of the telephone office is of great importance. The last  individual experiment was an association test. I called six words like  \"book,\" \"house,\" \"rain,\" and had them speak the first word which came  to their minds. The time was measured in fifths of a second only, as  subtler experiments, for which hundredths of a second would have to  be considered, were not needed.    In studying the results so far as the memory experiments were  concerned, we found that it would be useless to consider the figures  with more than 10 digits. We took the results only of those with 8,9,  and 10 digits. There were 54 possibilities of mistakes. The smallest  number of actual mistakes was 2, the largest, 29. In the experiment on  attention made with the crossing-out of letters, we found that the  smallest number of correctly marked letters was 107, the largest  number in the six minutes, 272; the smallest number of overlooked  letters was 2, the largest, 135; but this last case of abnormal  carelessness stood quite isolated. On the whole, the number of  overlooked letters fluctuated between 5 and 60. If both results, those  of the crossed-out and those of the overlooked letters, are brought  into relation, we find that the best results were a case of 236  letters marked, with only 2 overlooked, and one of 257 marked, with 4  overlooked. The very interesting details as to the various types of  attention which we see in the distribution of mistakes over the six  minutes were not taken into our final table. The word experiments by  which we tested the intelligence showed that no one was able to  reproduce more than 22 of the 24 words. The smallest number of words  remembered was 7. The mistakes in the perception of distances  fluctuated between 1 and 14 millimeters; the time for the sorting of  the 48 cards, between, 35 and 58 seconds; the association-time for the  6 associated words taken together was between 9 and 21 seconds. The  pointing experiments could not be made use of in this first series, as  it was found that quite a number of participants were unable to  perform the act with the rapidity demanded.    Several ways were open to make mathematical use of these results. I  preferred the simplest way. I calculated the grade of the girls for  each of these achievements. The same candidate who stood in the 7th  place in the memory experiment was in the 15th place with reference to  the number of letters marked, in the 3rd place with reference to the  letters overlooked, in the 21st place with reference to the number of  word pairs which she had grasped, in the 11th place with reference to  the exactitude of space-perception, in the 16th place with reference  to the association-time, and in the 6th place with reference to the  time of sorting. As soon as we had all these independent grades, we  calculated the average and in this way ultimately gained a common  order of grading. It is evident that this kind of calculation contains  accidental factors, especially as a consequence of the fact that we  give equal value to every one of these results. It might be better,  for instance, to attribute a higher value to the attention experiment  or to the intelligence experiment. This could be done by multiplying  the results of some of these grades by 2 or by 3, which would bring  the high or low grade of a girl for a particular function to stronger  influence in the final result. But in this first trial I contented  myself with the simplest uniform scheme in order to exclude all  arbitrariness, and therefore considered the mere average of all the  grades as the expression of the experimental result.    With this average rank list, we compared the practical results of the  telephone company after three months had passed. These three months  had been sufficient to secure at least a certain discrimination  between the best, the average, and the unfit. The result of this  comparison was on the whole satisfactory. First, the skeptical  telephone company had mixed with the class a number of women who had  been in the service for a long while and had even been selected as  teachers in the telephone school. I did not know, in figuring out the  results, which of the participants in the experiments these  particularly gifted outsiders were. If the psychological experiments  had brought the result that these individuals who stood so high in  the estimation of the telephone company ranked low in the laboratory  experiment, it would have reflected strongly on the reliability of the  laboratory method. The results showed, on the contrary, that these  women who had proved most able in practical service stood at the top  of our list. Correspondingly, those who stood the lowest in our  psychological rank list had in the mean time been found unfit in  practical service and had either left the company of their own accord  or else had been eliminated. The agreement, to be sure, was not a  perfect one. One of the list of women stood rather low in the  psychological list, while the office reported that so far she had done  fair work in the service, and two others to whom the psychological  laboratory gave a good testimonial were considered by the telephone  office as only fair.    But it is evident that certain disagreements would have occurred even  with a more ideal method, as on the one side no final achievement in  practical service can be given after only three months, and because on  the other side a large number of secondary factors may enter which  entirely overshadow the mere question of psychophysical fitness. Poor  health, for instance, may hinder even the most fit individual from  doing satisfactory work, and extreme industry and energetic will may  for a while lead even the unfit to fair achievement, which, to be  sure, is likely to be coupled with a dangerous exhaustion. The slight  disagreements between the psychological results and the practical  valuation, therefore, do not in the least speak against the  significance of such a method. On the other hand, I emphasize that  this first series meant only the beginning of the investigation, and  it can hardly be expected that at such a first approach the best and  most suitable methods would at once be hit upon. A continuation of the  work will surely lead to much better combinations of test experiments  and to better adjusted schemes. But it would be most desirable that  such studies be undertaken at various places according to various  schemes in order to come nearer to the solution of a problem which is  economically important to the whole public and to many thousands of  employees. As soon as methods are really perfected it would seem not  at all impossible that by a short experiment of a few minutes  thousands of applicants might be saved long months of study and  training which are completely wasted. For us here the detailed  analysis of this particular case did not mean a suggestion to use  to-day in the telephone offices of the country the special scheme  which we applied, but it stood only as a clear, simple illustration  of a method by which not the specific work itself is tested, but by  which the industrial work of the individual is resolved into a long  series of parallel functions each one of which is tested  independently. The experimental aid which the laboratory has to supply  in such cases is not a newly invented device, such as we needed in the  case of the motormen, but simply the methods well known as so-called  mental tests.    The experiments with such tests by which single mental functions are  measured approximately in short quick examinations, has been much  discussed in psychological circles. For a long while the thorough  scholars remained very reluctant to accept such an apparently  superficial scheme, when these tests were proposed especially for the  pedagogical interests of the schoolroom. It was a time in which the  scientific efforts were completely devoted to the general problems of  the human mind and in which individual differences were very little  considered. Moreover, the questions of applied psychology still seemed  so far distant that the true scholar instinctively took his standards  from the methods of purely theoretical research. Seen from such a  point of view, it could not be denied that the tests were not  sufficient to give us a complete scientific analysis of the  personality in its subtler structure. The theorists knew too well that  if the reactions, or associations, or memories, or tendencies of  attention, or emotions of a subject were measured really with that  scientific thoroughness which is the ideal of research, long months of  experiments would be needed, and little could be hoped for from tests  to be performed in half an hour. But this somewhat haughty reserve  which was quite justified twenty years ago has become obsolete and  would be meaningless to-day. On the one side the methods themselves  have been multiplied; for each mental act like memory, attention, and  so on, dozens of well-studied tests are at our disposal, which are  adjusted to the finest ramifications of the functions.[15] "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15164"],[0,"Folk Tales Every Child Should Know (#14)"],[1,"what? I know that you will be glad to liberate yourself from that  pest.\" The old woman interrupted him: \"How should I not? It captured me,  too, in this way, but now I have no means of escape.\" Then he proceeded:  \"Listen well to what I am going to say to you. Ask it whither it goes  and where its strength is; then kiss all that place where it tells you  its strength is, as if from love, till you ascertain it, and afterward  tell me when I come.\" Then the prince went off to the palace, and the  old woman remained in the water-mill. When the dragon came in, the old  woman began to question it: \"Where in God's name have you been? Whither  do you go so far? You will never tell me whither you go.\" The dragon  replied: \"Well, my dear old woman, I do go far.\" Then the old woman  began to coax it: \"And why do you go so far? Tell me where your strength  is. If I knew where your strength is, I don't know what I should do for  love; I would kiss all that place.\" Thereupon the dragon smiled and said  to her: \"Yonder is my strength, in that fireplace.\" Then the old woman  began to fondle and kiss the fireplace, and the dragon on seeing it  burst into a laugh and said to her: \"Silly old woman, my strength isn't  there; my strength is in that tree-fungus in front of the house.\" Then  the old woman began again to fondle and kiss the tree, and the dragon  again laughed, and said to her: \"Away, old woman! my strength isn't  there.\" Then the old woman inquired: \"Where is it?\" The dragon began to  give an account in detail: \"My strength is a long way off, and you  cannot go thither. Far in another empire under the emperor's city is a  lake, in that lake is a dragon, and in that dragon a boar, and in the  boar a pigeon, and in that is my strength.\" The next morning when the  dragon went away from the mill, the prince came to the old woman, and  the old woman told him all that she had heard from the dragon. Then he  left his home, and disguised himself; he put shepherd's boots to his  feet, took a shepherd's staff in his hand, and went into the world. As  he went on thus from village to village, and from town to town, at last  he came into another empire and into the imperial city, in a lake under  which the dragon was. On going into the town he began to inquire who  wanted a shepherd. The citizens told him that the emperor did. Then he  went straight to the emperor. After he announced himself, the emperor  admitted him into his presence, and asked him: \"Do you wish to keep  sheep?\" He replied: \"I do, illustrious crown!\" Then the emperor engaged  him, and began to inform and instruct him: \"There is here a lake, and  alongside of the lake very beautiful pasture, and when you call the  sheep out, they go thither at once, and spread themselves round the  lake; but whatever shepherd goes off there, that shepherd returns back  no more. Therefore, my son, I tell you, don't let the sheep have their  own way and go where _they_ will, but keep them where _you_ will.\" The  prince thanked the emperor, got himself ready, and called out the sheep,  taking with him, more-over, two hounds that could catch a boar in the  open country, and a falcon that could capture any bird, and carrying  also a pair of bagpipes. When he called out the sheep he let them go at  once to the lake, and when the sheep arrived at the lake, they  immediately spread round it, and the prince placed the falcon on a  stump, and the hounds and bagpipes under the stump, then tucked up his  hose and sleeves, waded into the lake, and began to shout: \"Dragon,  dragon! come out to single combat with me to-day that we may measure  ourselves together, unless you're a woman.\"[6] The dragon called out in  reply, \"I will do so now, prince--now!\" Erelong behold the dragon! it is  large, it is terrible, it is disgusting! When the dragon came out, it  seized him by the waist, and they wrestled a summer day till afternoon.  But when the heat of afternoon came on, the dragon said: \"Let me go,  prince, that I may moisten my parched head in the lake, and toss you to  the sky.\" But the prince replied: \"Come, dragon, don't talk nonsense; if  I had the emperor's daughter to kiss me on the forehead, I would toss  you still higher.\" Thereupon, the dragon suddenly let him go, and went  off into the lake. On the approach of evening, he washed and got himself  up nicely, placed the falcon on his arm, the hounds behind him, and the  bagpipes under his arm, then drove the sheep and went into the town  playing on the bagpipes. When he arrived at the town, the whole town  assembled as to see a wondrous sight because he had come, whereas  previously no shepherd had been able to come from the lake. The next day  the prince got ready again, and went with his sheep straight to the  lake. But the emperor sent two grooms after him to go stealthily and see  what he did, and they placed themselves on a high hill whence they could  have a good view. When the shepherd arrived, he put the hounds and  bagpipes under the stump and the falcon upon it, then tucked up his hose  and sleeves waded into the lake and shouted: \"Dragon, dragon! come out  to single combat with me, that we may measure ourselves once more  together, unless you are a woman!\" The dragon replied: \"I will do so,  prince, now, now!\" Erelong, behold the dragon! it was large, it was  terrible, it was disgusting! And it seized him by the waist and wrestled  with him a summer's day till afternoon. But when the afternoon heat came  on, the dragon said: \"Let me go, prince, that I may moisten my parched  head in the lake, and may toss you to the sky.\" The prince replied:  \"Come, dragon, don't talk nonsense; if I had the emperor's daughter to  kiss me on the forehead, I would toss you still higher.\" Thereupon the  dragon suddenly left hold of him, and went off into the lake. When night  approached the prince drove the sheep as before, and went home playing  the bagpipes When he arrived at the town, the whole town was astir and  began to wonder because the shepherd came home every evening, which no  one had been able to do before. Those two grooms had already arrived at  the palace before the prince, and related to the emperor in order  everything that they had heard and seen. Now when the emperor saw that  the shepherd returned home, he immediately summoned his daughter into  his presence and told her all, what it was and how it was. \"But,\" said  he, \"to-morrow you must go with the shepherd to the lake and kiss him on  the forehead.\" When she heard this she burst into tears and began to  entreat her father. \"You have no one but me, and I am your only  daughter, and you don't care about me if I perish.\" Then the emperor  began to persuade and encourage her: \"Don't fear, my daughter; you see  we have had so many changes of shepherds, and of all that went out to  the lake not one has returned; but _he_ had been contending with the  dragon for two whole days and it has done him no hurt. I assure you, in  God's name, that he is able to overcome the dragon, only go to-morrow  with him to see whether he will free us from this mischief which has  destroyed so many people.\"    When, on the morrow, the day dawned and the sun came forth, up rose the  shepherd, up rose the maiden too, to begin to prepare for going to the  lake. The shepherd was cheerful, more cheerful than ever, but the  emperor's daughter was sad and shed tears. The shepherd comforted her:  \"Lady sister, I pray you, do not weep, but do what I tell you. When it  is time, run up and kiss me, and fear not.\" As he went and drove the  sheep, the shepherd was thoroughly cheery, and played a merry tune on  his bagpipes; but the damsel did nothing but weep as she went beside  him, and he several times left off playing and turned toward her: \"Weep  not, golden one; fear nought.\" When they arrived at the lake, the sheep  immediately spread round it, and the prince placed the falcon on the  stump, and the hounds and bagpipes under it, then tucked up his hose and  sleeves, waded into the water, and shouted: \"Dragon! dragon! Come out to  single combat with me; let us measure ourselves once more, unless you're  a woman!\" The dragon replied: \"I will, prince; now, now!\" Erelong,  there was the dragon! it was huge, it was terrible, it was disgusting!  When it came out, they seized each other by the middle, and wrestled a  summer's day till afternoon. But when the afternoon heat came on, the  dragon said: \"Let me go, prince, that I may moisten my parched head in  the lake, and toss you to the skies.\" The prince replied: \"Come, dragon,  don't talk nonsense; if I had the emperor's daughter to kiss me on the  forehead, I would toss you much higher.\" When he said this, the  emperor's daughter ran up and kissed him on the face, on the eye, and on  the forehead. Then he swung the dragon, and tossed it high into the air,  and when it fell to the ground it burst into pieces. But as it burst  into pieces, out of it sprang a wild boar, and started to run away. But  the prince shouted to his shepherd dogs: \"Hold it! don't let it go!\" and  the dogs sprang up and after it, caught it, and soon tore it to pieces.  But out of the boar flew a pigeon, and the prince loosed the falcon, and  the falcon caught the pigeon and brought it into the prince's hands. The  prince said to it: \"Tell me now, where are my brothers?\" The pigeon  replied: \"I will; only do me no harm. Immediately behind your father's  town is a water-mill, and in the water-mill are three wands that have  sprouted up. Cut these three wands up from below, and strike with them  upon their root; an iron door will immediately open into a large vault.  In that vault are many people, old and young, rich and poor, small and  great, wives and maidens, so that you could settle a populous empire;  there, too, are your brothers.\" When the pigeon had told him all this,  the prince immediately wrung its neck.    The emperor had gone out in person, and posted himself on the hill"]]]
