Papa, too,  liked to watch my enjoyment and hear my cries of delight at each  fresh surprise that came from the magic shoes, and his pleasure  added to mine. But the time had come when Our Lord wished to free  me from childhood's failings, and even withdraw me from its  innocent pleasures. On this occasion, instead of indulging me as  he generally did, Papa seemed vexed, and on my way upstairs I  heard him say: \"Really all this is too babyish for a big girl like  Therese, and I hope it is the last year it will happen.\" His words  cut me to the quick. Celine, knowing how sensitive I was,  whispered: \"Don't go downstairs just yet--wait a little, you would  cry too much if you looked at your presents before Papa.\" But  Therese was no longer the same--Jesus had changed her heart.    Choking back my tears, I ran down to the dining-room, and, though  my heart beat fast, I picked up my shoes, and gaily pulled out all  the things, looking as happy as a queen. Papa laughed, and did not  show any trace of displeasure, and Celine thought she must be  dreaming. But happily it was a reality; little Therese had  regained, once for all, the strength of mind which she had lost at  the age of four and a half.    On this night of grace, the third period of my life began--the  most beautiful of all, the one most filled with heavenly favours.  In an instant Our Lord, satisfied with my good will, accomplished  the work I had not been able to do during all these years. Like  the Apostle I could say: \"Master, we have laboured all night, and  have taken nothing.\"[2]    More merciful to me even than to His beloved disciples, Our Lord  Himself took the net, cast it, and drew it out full of fishes. He  made me a fisher of men. Love and a spirit of self-forgetfulness  took possession of me, and from that time I was perfectly happy.    One Sunday, closing my book at the end of Mass, a picture of Our  Lord on the Cross half slipped out, showing only one of His Divine  Hands, pierced and bleeding. I felt an indescribable thrill such  as I had never felt before. My heart was torn with grief to see  that Precious Blood falling to the ground, and no one caring to  treasure It as It fell, and I resolved to remain continually in  spirit at the foot of the Cross, that I might receive the Divine  Dew of Salvation and pour it forth upon souls. From that day the  cry of my dying Saviour--\"I thirst!\"--sounded incessantly in my  heart, and kindled therein a burning zeal hitherto unknown to me.  My one desire was to give my Beloved to drink; I felt myself  consumed with thirst for souls, and I longed at any cost to snatch  sinners from the everlasting flames of hell.    In order still further to enkindle my ardour, Our Divine Master  soon proved to me how pleasing to him was my desire. Just then I  heard much talk of a notorious criminal, Pranzini, who was  sentenced to death for several shocking murders, and, as he was  quite impenitent, everyone feared he would be eternally lost. How  I longed to avert this irreparable calamity! In order to do so I  employed all the spiritual means I could think of, and, knowing  that my own efforts were unavailing, I offered for his pardon the  infinite merits of Our Saviour and the treasures of Holy Church.    Need I say that in the depths of my heart I felt certain my  request would be granted? But, that I might gain courage to  persevere in the quest for souls, I said in all simplicity: \"My  God, I am quite sure that Thou wilt pardon this unhappy Pranzini.  I should still think so if he did not confess his sins or give any  sign of sorrow, because I have such confidence in Thy unbounded  Mercy; but this is my first sinner, and therefore I beg for just  one sign of repentance to reassure me.\" My prayer was granted to  the letter. My Father never allowed us to read the papers, but I  did not think there was any disobedience in looking at the part  about Pranzini. The day after his execution I hastily opened the  paper, _La Croix,_ and what did I see? Tears betrayed my emotion;  I was obliged to run out of the room. Pranzini had mounted the  scaffold without confessing or receiving absolution, and the  executioners were already dragging him towards the fatal block,  when all at once, apparently in answer to a sudden inspiration, he  turned round, seized the crucifix which the Priest was offering to  him, and kissed Our Lord's Sacred Wounds three times. . . . I had  obtained the sign I asked for, and to me it was especially sweet.  Was it not when I saw the Precious Blood flowing from the Wounds  of Jesus that the thirst for souls first took possession of me? I  wished to give them to drink of the Blood of the Immaculate Lamb  that It might wash away their stains, and the lips of \"my first  born\" had been pressed to these Divine Wounds. What a wonderful  answer!    After receiving this grace my desire for the salvation of souls  increased day by day. I seemed to hear Our Lord whispering to me,  as He did to the Samaritan woman: \"Give me to drink!\"[3] It was  indeed an exchange of love: upon souls I poured forth the Precious  Blood of Jesus, and to Jesus I offered these souls refreshed with  the Dew of Calvary. In this way I thought to quench His Thirst;  but the more I gave Him to drink, so much the more did the thirst  of my own poor soul increase, and I accepted it as the most  delightful recompense.    In a short time God, in His goodness, had lifted me out of the  narrow sphere in which I lived. The great step was taken; but,  alas! I had still a long road to travel. Now that I was free from  scruples and morbid sensitiveness, my mind developed. I had always  loved what was noble and beautiful, and about this time I was  seized with a passionate desire for learning. Not content with  lessons from my teachers, I took up certain subjects by myself,  and learnt more in a few months than I had in my whole school  life. Was not this ardour--\"vanity and vexation of spirit\"?[4] For  me, with my impetuous nature, this was one of the most dangerous  times of my life, but Our Lord fulfilled in me those words of  Ezechiel's prophecy: \"Behold thy time was the time of lovers: and  I spread my garment over thee. And I swore to thee, and I entered  into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest  Mine. And I washed thee with water, and I anointed thee with oil.  I clothed thee with fine garments, and put a chain about thy neck.  Thou didst eat fine flour and honey and oil, and wast made  exceedingly beautiful, and wast advanced to be a queen.\"[5]    Yes, Our Lord has done all this for me. I might take each word of  that striking passage and show how it has been completely realised  in me, but the graces of which I have already told you are  sufficient proof. So I will only speak now of the food with which  my Divine Master abundantly provided me. For a long time I had  nourished my spiritual life with the \"fine flour\" contained in the  _Imitation of Christ._ It was the only book which did me good, for  I had not yet found the treasures hidden in the Holy Gospels. I  always had it with me, to the amusement of my people at home. My  aunt used often to open it, and make me repeat by heart the first  chapter she chanced to light upon.    Seeing my great thirst for knowledge, God was pleased, when I was  fourteen, to add to the \"fine flour,\" \"honey\" and \"oil\" in  abundance.    This \"honey\" and \"oil\" I found in the conferences of Father  Arminjon on _The End of this World and the Mysteries of the World  to Come._ While reading this book my soul was flooded with a  happiness quite supernatural. I experienced a foretaste of what  God has prepared for those who love Him; and, seeing that eternal  rewards are so much in excess of the petty sacrifices of this  life, I yearned to love Our Lord, to love Him passionately, and to  give Him countless proofs of affection while this was still in my  power.    Celine had become the most intimate sharer of my thoughts,  especially since Christmas. Our Lord, Who wished to make us  advance in virtue together, drew us to one another by ties  stronger than blood. He made us sisters in spirit as well as in  the flesh. The words of our Holy Father, St. John of the Cross,  were realised in us:            Treading within Thy Footsteps          Young maidens lightly run upon the way.          From the spark's contact,          And the spiced wine,          They give forth aspirations of a balm divine.    It was lightly indeed that we followed in the footsteps of Our  Saviour. The burning sparks which He cast into our souls, the  strong wine which He gave us to drink, made us lose sight of all  earthly things, and we breathed forth sighs of love.    Very sweet is the memory of our intercourse. Every evening we went  up to our attic window together and gazed at the starry depths of  the sky, and I think very precious graces were bestowed on us  then. As the _Imitation_ says: \"God communicates Himself sometimes  amid great light, at other times sweetly in signs and figures.\"[6]    In this way He deigned to manifest Himself to our hearts; but how  slight and transparent was the veil! Doubt was no longer possible;  already Faith and Hope had given place to Love, which made us find  Him whom we sought, even on this earth. When He found us  alone--\"He gave us His kiss, and now no one may despise us.\"[7]    These divine impressions could not but bear fruit. The practice of  virtue gradually became sweet and natural to me. At first my looks  betrayed the effort, but, little by little, self-sacrifice seemed  to come more easily and without hesitation. Our Lord has said: \"To  everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall abound.\"[8]    Each grace faithfully received brought many others. He gave  Himself to me in Holy Communion oftener than I should have dared  to hope. I had made it my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/168"],[0,"The History and Practice of the Art of Photography (#14)"],[1,"quantity of salt has  been added, and it should afterwards be soaked in water only.  When the  picture has been dried, wash it quickly over with a soft brush dipped  in a warm solution of hyposulphite of soda, and then wash it for some  time in distilled water, in order that all the hyposulphite may be  removed.  The drawing is now fixed and we may use it to procure  positive copies, (the original being termed a negative,) many of which  may be taken from one original.\"    \"The action of light on this preparation, does indeed appear to be  instantaneous.  The exquisite delicacy of this preparation may be  imagined, when I state that in five seconds in the camera, I have,  during sunshine, obtained perfect pictures, and that when the sky is  overcast, one minute is quite sufficient to produce a most decided  effect.\"    \"This very beautiful process is not without its difficulties; and the  author cannot promise that, even with the closest attention to the  above directions, annoying failures will not occur.  It often happens  that some accidental circumstance--generally a projecting film or a  little dust--will occasion the mercurial vapor to act with great energy  on one part of the paper, and blacken it before the other portions are  at all effected.  Again, the mercury will sometimes accumulate along  the lines made by the brush, and give a streaky appearance to the  picture, although these lines are not at all evident before the  mercurial vapor was applied.  (A brush sufficiently large--and they may  be easily obtained--will, in a measure, prevent this difficulty.--Amer  Au.) I have stated that the paper should be placed wet in the camera;  the same paper may be used dry, which often is a great convenience.  When in the dry state a little longer exposure is required; and instead  of taking a picture in four or five seconds, two or three minutes are  necessary.\"    The durability of daguerreotypes has been, and is still, doubted by  many, but experiment has proved that they are more permanent than oil  paintings or engravings.    ETCHING DAGUERREOTYPES.--There are several methods of accomplishing  this object; discovered and applied by different individuals.    The first process was published at Vienna by Dr. Berres, and consisted  in covering the plate with the mucilage of gum arabic, and then  immersing the plate in nitric acid of different strengths.    Mr. Figeau, of whom I have already spoken, likewise discovered a  process for the engraving of Daguerreotypes; and founded on the belief  that the lights of a Daguerreotype plate consists of unaltered silver,  while the dark or shadows consists of mercury or an amalgam of mercury  with silver.  He finds that a compound acid, consisting of a mixture of  nitric, nitrous, and muriatic acids, or of nitric mixed with nitrate of  potass and common salt, has the property of attaching the silver in  presence of the mercury without acting upon the latter.  Bi-chloride of  copper answers the purpose also, but less completely.    \"When the clean surface of a Daguerreotype plate is exposed to the  action of this menstruum, particularly if warm, the white parts, or  lights are not altered, but the dark parts are attacked, and chloride  of silver is formed, of which an insoluble coating is soon deposited,  and the action of the acid soon ceases.  This coat of chloride of  silver is removed by a solution of ammonia, and then the acid applied  again, and so on, until the depth of biting in is sufficient.  However,  it is not possible, by repeating this process, to get a sufficient  force of impression; a second operation is required, in order to obtain  such a depth as will hold the ink, to give a dark impression; for this  purpose the whole plate is covered with drying oil; this is cleared off  with the hand, exactly in the way a copper plate printer cleans his  plate.  The oil is thus left in the sinkings, or dark bitten in parts  only.  The whole plate is now placed in a suitable apparatus, and the  lights or prominent parts of the face are gilt by the electrotype  process.  The whole surface is now touched with what the French  engravers call the \"Resin Grain,\" (grain de resine), a species of  partial stopping out, and it is at once bitten in to a sufficient depth  with nitric acid, the gilding preserving the lights from all action of  the acid.  The resin grain gives a surface to the corroded parts  suitable for holding the ink, and the plate is now finished and fit to  give impressions resembling aquatint.  But as silver is so soft a metal  that the surface of the plate might be expected to wear rapidly, the  discoverer proposes to shield it by depositing over its whole surface a  very thin coat of copper by the electrotype process; which when worn  may be removed at pleasure down to the surface of the noble metal  beneath, and again a fresh coat of copper deposited; and so an  unlimited number of impressions obtained without injuring the plate  itself.\"    If, as has been asserted, steel may be rendered sufficiently sensitive,  to take photographic impressions, to what a revolution will the art of  engraving be subject by the discovery of this process.        CHAP. VIII.    PHOTOGENIC DRAWING ON PAPER.      We shall now proceed to describe the various processes for Photogenic  drawing on paper; first, however, impressing on the mind of the  experimenter, the necessity which exists for extreme care in every  stage of the manipulation.  In this portion of my work I am entirely  indebted to the works of Professors Hunt, Fisher and others.    I. APPARATUS AND MATERIALS.--Paper.--The principal difficulty to be  contended with in using paper, is the different power of imbibition  which we often find possessed in the same sheet, owing to trifling  inequalities in its texture.  This is, to a certain extent, to be  overcome by a careful examination of each sheet, by the light of a  candle or lamp at night, or in the dark.  By extending each sheet  between the light and the eye, and slowly moving it up and down, and  from left to right, the variations in its texture will be seen by the  different quantities of light which pass through it in different parts;  and it is always the safest course to reject every sheet in which  inequalities exist.  Paper sometimes contains minute portions of  thread, black or brown specks, and other imperfections, all of which  materially interfere with the process.  Some paper has an artificial  substance given to it by sulphate of lime (Plaster of Paris); this  defect only exists, however, in the cheaper sorts of demy, and  therefore can be easily avoided.  In all cases such paper should be  rejected, as no really sensitive material can be obtained with it.  Paper-makers, as is well known, often affix their name to one half the  sheet; this moiety should also be placed aside, as the letters must  frequently come out with annoying distinctness.  Well sized paper is by  no means objectionable, indeed, is rather to be preferred, since the  size tends to exalt the sensitive powers of the silver.  The principal  thing to be avoided, is the absorption of the sensitive solution into  the pores; and it must be evident that this desideratum cannot be  obtained by unsized paper.  Taking all things into consideration, the  paper known as satin post would appear to be preferable, although the  precautions already recommended should be taken in its selection.    Brushes.--The necessary solutions are to be laid upon the paper by  brushes.  Some persons pass the paper over the surface of the  solutions, thus licking up, as it were, a portion of the fluid; but  this method is apt to give an uneven surface; it also rapidly spoils  the solutions.  At all events, the brush is the most ready and the most  effectual means.    Distilled Water.--All the water used, both for mixing the solutions,  washing the paper, or cleaning the brushes, must be distilled, to  obtain good results, for reasons before specified.    Blotting Paper.--In many instances, the prepared paper requires to be  lightly dried with bibulous paper.  The best description is the white  sort.  In each stage of the preparation distinct portions of bibulous  paper must be used.  If these be kept seperate and marked, they can be  again employed for the same stage; but it would not do, for example, to  dry the finished picture in the same folds in which the sensitive paper  had been pressed.  A very convenient method is to have two or three  quarto size books of bibulous paper, one for each seperate process.    Nitrate of Silver.--In the practice of the photographic art, much  depends on the nitrate of silver.  Care should be taken to procure the  best; the crystalized salt is most suitable for the purpose.  While in  the form of crystal it is not injured by exposure to light, but the  bottles containing the solutions of this salt should at all times be  kept wrapped in dark paper, and excluded from daylight.    II. DIFFERENT METHODS OF PREPARING THE PAPER.--Preparation of the  Paper.--Dip the paper to be prepared into a weak solution of common  salt.  The solution should not be saturated, but six or eight times  diluted with water.  When perfectly moistened, wipe it dry with a  towel, or press it between bibulous paper, by which operation the salt  is uniformly dispersed through its substance.  Then brush over it, on  one side only, a solution of nitrate of silver.  The strength of this  solution must vary according to the color and sensitiveness required.  Mr. Talbot recommends about fifty grains of the salt to an ounce of  distilled water.  Some advise twenty grains only, while others say  eighty grains to the ounce.  When dried in a dark room, the paper is  fit for use.  To render this paper still more sensitive, it must again  be washed with salt and water, and afterwards with the same solution of  nitrate of silver, drying it between times.  This paper, if carefully  made, is very useful "]]]
