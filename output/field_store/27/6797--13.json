As it was, the kindly  intention of czar or czarina sufficed to arouse them from the asthenia  to which they were reduced for want of freedom. The times were rife with  excitement, and the Jewish atmosphere with expectancy. The mighty  changes which were taking place in Russia and Poland; the dismemberment  of the latter; the annexation of Balta (1791), Lithuania (1794), and  Courland (1797) to the former; the short-lived yet potent German rule in  Byelostok (1793-1807), and the rude but memorable contact with France  (1807-1812), these and many other important happenings in a brief span  of time had a telling effect upon the diverse races under the dominion  of Russia, and among them not the least upon the Jewish race. Everywhere  the desire for \"liberty, equality, and fraternity\" began to manifest  itself. In Courland, the most German of Russian provinces, Georg  Gottfried Mylich, a Lutheran pastor at Nerft, made a touching appeal  (ab. 1787) in German on behalf of the Jews, insisting that the word Jew  \"should not be taken to indicate a class of people different from us,  but only a different religious body; and as regards his nationality, it  should not hinder him from obtaining citizen's rights and liberties  equal to those of the people of Sleswick, the Saxons, Danes, Swedes,  Swiss, French, and Italians, who also live among us.\" In Poland, Tadeusz  Czacki, the historian, wrote his _Discourse on the Jews_ (_Rosprava o  Zhydakh_, Vilna, 1807), in which he deplores that Jews \"experienced  indulgence rarely, oppression often, and contempt nearly always\" under  the most Christian governments, and suggests a plan for reforming their  condition. But the main appeal for freedom came, as might have been  expected, from the Jews themselves. Contemporaneous with, if not before,  Michel Beer's _Appel a la justice des nations et des rois_, a Lithuanian  Jew, during his imprisonment in Nieszvicz on a false charge, wrote a  work in Polish on the Jewish problem,[2] while in 1803 Loeb, or Leon,  Nebakhovich, an intimate friend of Count Shakovskoy, published _The Cry  of the Daughter of Judah_ (_Fopli Docheri Yudeyskoy_), the first defence  of the Russian Jew in the Russian language. The followers of the  religion of love are implored to love a Jew because he is a Jew, and  they are assured that the Jew who preserves his religion undefiled can  be neither a bad man nor a bad citizen.    But the Jews did not wait for their dreams to be realized. They threw  themselves into the swirl of their country's ambition, as if they had  never received anything other than the tenderness of a devoted mother at  her hands. They were \"kindled in a common blaze\" of patriotism with the  rest of the population. That in spite of all accusations to the contrary  they remained loyal to Poland, is amply proved by the history of that  unfortunate country. The characteristic kapota of the Polish Jew, his  whole garb, including the yarmulka (under cap), is simply the old Polish  costume, which the Jews retained after the Poles had adopted the German  form of dress.[3] \"When, in the year 1794,\" says Czacki, \"despair armed  the [Polish] capital, the Jews were not afraid of death, but, mingling  with the troops and the populace, they proved that danger did not  terrify them, and that the cause of the fatherland was dear to them.\"  With the permission of Kosciusko, Colonel Joselovich Berek, later killed  at the battle of Kotzk (1809), formed a regiment of light cavalry  consisting entirely of Jews, which distinguished itself especially at  the siege of Warsaw. Most of the members perished in defence of the  suburb of Praga. In the agony of death, Rabbi Hayyim longed for good  tidings, that he might die in peace. And when the fight was over,  Zbitkover expended two barrels of money, one filled with gold ducats and  one with silver rubles, for the live and dead soldiers who were brought  to him.[4] Indeed, Prince Czartorisky was so convinced of their  patriotism, that he always advocated the same rights for the Polish Jews  as were claimed for the Polish Gentiles, entrusted his children to the  care of Mendel Levin of Satanov, and instructed his son, Prince  Ladislaus, always to remain their friend.[5]    But when, in spite of struggle and sacrifice, the doom \"finis Poloniae\"  was sounded, and a large portion of the once powerful empire was  incorporated into Russia, we find the Jews bearing their sorrow  patiently, and willingly performing their duties as subjects to their  new masters. Their attachment to their czar and country was not shaken  in the least when, in 1812, Napoleon made them flattering promises to  secure their services in his behalf. Rabbi Shneor Zalman, the eminent  leader of the Lithuanian Hasidim, hearing of the invasion of the French  army, spent many days in prayer and fasting for the success of the  Russians, and fled on the Sabbath day, not to be contaminated by contact  with the \"godless French.\" When Napoleon was finally defeated, the event  was celebrated both at home and in the synagogue, and Russian soldiers  were everywhere welcomed by Jews with gifts and good cheer.[6]  Lilienthal relates that the Jews succeeded in intercepting a courier who  carried the plan of operations of the French army, and Alexander  declared in a dispatch that Jews had opened the eyes of the Russians,  and the Government, therefore, felt itself bound to them by eternal  gratitude.[7] It is to this proof of patriotism that some attribute  Alexander's interest in the Jews and his order that three deputies  should reside in St. Petersburg to represent them in Russia, and in  Poland a committee consisting of three Christians and eight Jews should  be appointed to devise ways and means of ameliorating their  condition.[8]    The times were promising in other respects. In that critical period, the  Government, reposing but little confidence in Russian merchants, whose  business motto was \"No swindle, no sale,\" allowed several Jews to become  Government contractors (podradchiki). These, while rendering valuable  services, amassed considerable fortunes. Notwithstanding the law  restricting Jewish residence to the Pale of Settlement, Catherine II  speaks of Jews who resided in St. Petersburg for many years, and lodged  in the house of a priest, who had been her confessor. Moreover, Jews  contributed not a little to the liberal policy of Alexander I. Among  them were Eliezer Dillon of Nieszvicz (d. 1838), who was honored by the  emperor with a gold medal \"for faithful and conscientious services,\" and  was given an audience by his Majesty, at which he pleaded the cause of  his coreligionists;[9] Nathan Notkin, who mitigated the possible effect  of Senator Dyerzhavin's baneful opinions concerning Jews, as expressed  in his report (_Mnyenie_, September, 1800), and who suggested the  establishment of schools for children and for adults in Yekaterinoslav  and elsewhere; Abraham Peretz, the personal friend of Speransky,  Dyerzhavin, and Potemkin, and a brilliant financier, whose high standing  enabled him to be a power for good in the councils concerning Jews;[10]  and his father-in-law, Joshua Zeitlin (1724-1822). Zeitlin was a rare  phenomenon, reminding one of the golden days of Jewish Spain. His  knowledge of finance and political economy won him the admiration of  Prince Potemkin, the protection of Czarina Catherine, and the esteem of  Alexander I, who appointed him court councillor (nadvorny sovyetnik).  But his mercantile pursuits did not hinder him from study, and his high  living did not interfere with his high thinking. His palatial home at  Ustye, in Mohilev, became a refuge for all needy Talmudists and  Maskilim, whom he helped with the liberality of a Maecenas; he conducted  an extensive correspondence on rabbinic literature, and for many years  supported Doctor Schick and Mendel Levin. For Doctor Schick he built a  laboratory, and filled his library with rare manuscripts and works on  Jewish and secular subjects.[11]    Even among the conservative Talmudists signs of improvement were not  wanting. The Gaon became the centre of a group of enlightened friends  and disciples, who continued in his footsteps after his death. His son,  Rabbi Abraham, who published and edited many of his works, a task  requiring no small amount of acumen and Talmudic erudition,[12] was also  the author of books on geography, mathematics, and physics. His pupils,  such as Doctor Schick and Rabbi Benjamin and Rabbi Zelmele, influenced  their contemporaries either directly, by bringing them in touch with the  new learning, or indirectly, by reforming the school system and the  method of Talmud study.[13] Of Rabbi Zelmele, who like his master became  the hero of a wonder-biography written by his disciple Ezekiel Feivel of  Plungian, we are told that he regarded grammar as indispensable to a  thorough knowledge of the Bible and the Talmud, pleaded for a return to  the order of study prescribed in the _Pirke Abot_, and complained that,  owing to the neglect of Aramaic, the benefits of comparative philology  were lost and unknown. He declared also that while he believed in all  the Bible contains, the stories in the Talmud are, for the most part,  legends and parables used for the purpose of illustration.[14]    [Illustration: MAX LILIENTHAL, 1815-1882]    Towering above all the disciples of the Gaon, the most outspoken in  behalf of enlightenment is Manasseh of Ilye (1767-1831). At a very early  age he attracted the attention of Talmudists by his originality and  boldness. In his unflinching determination to get at the truth, he did  not shrink from criticising Rashi and the _Shulhan 'Aruk_, and dared to  interpret some parts of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15932"],[0,"The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians (#14)"],[1,"       \"Created things are in the hollow of my hand, and the things that       are not yet made are inside me. I am clothed in and supplied with       thy spells, O Ra, which are above me and beneath me.... I am Ra,       the self-protected, no evil thing whatsoever shall overthrow me\"       (Chap. XXXII).    [Footnote 1: A god of the Eastern Delta and a local form of the Sun-god  early in the day.]    [Footnote 2: The primeval god, a form of Pautti, the oldest Egyptian  god.]    [Footnote 3: She was called \"Serqet.\"]    [Footnote 4: A green-eyed serpent-god, or goddess, equipped with great  power to destroy.]                                         CHAPTER V                  BOOKS OF THE DEAD OF THE GRAECO-ROMAN PERIOD      From what has been said in the preceding chapter it will be clear that  only wealthy people could afford to bury copies of the great Book of the  Dead with their deceased relatives. Whether the chapters that formed it  were written on coffins or on papyrus the cost of copying the work by a  competent scribe must have been relatively very great. Towards the close  of the twenty-sixth dynasty a feeling spread among the Egyptians that  only certain parts of the Book of the Dead were essential for the  resurrection of the body and for the salvation of the soul, and men  began to bury with their dead copies of the most important chapters of  it in a very much abridged form. A little later the scribes produced a  number of works, in which they included only such portions of the most  important chapters as were considered necessary to effect the  resurrection of the body. In other words, they rejected all the old  magical elements in the Book of the Dead, and preserved only the texts  and formulae that appertained to the cult of Osiris, the first man who  had risen from the dead. One of the oldest of these later substitutes  for the Book of the Dead is the _Shai en Sensen_, or \"Book of  Breathings.\" Several copies of this work are extant in the funerary  papyri, and the following sections, translated from a papyrus in the  British Museum, will give an idea of the character of the Book:    \"Hail, Osiris[1] Kersher, son of Tashenatit! Thou art pure, thy heart is  pure. Thy fore parts are pure, thy hind parts are cleansed; thy interior  is cleansed with incense and natron, and no member of thine hath any  defect in it whatsoever. Kersher is washed in the waters of the Field of  Offerings, that lieth to the north of the Field of the Grasshoppers. The  goddesses Uatchet and Nekhebet purify thee at the eighth hour of the  night and at the eighth hour of the day. Come then, enter the Hall of  Truth, for thou art free from all offence and from every defect, and  'Stone of Truth' is thy name. Thou enterest the Tuat (Other World) as  one exceedingly pure. Thou art purified by the Goddesses of Truth in the  Great Hall. Holy water hath been poured over thee in the Hall of Keb  (_i.e._ the earth), and thy body hath been made pure in the Hall of Shu  (heaven). Thou lookest upon Ra when he setteth in the form of Tem at  eventide. Amen is nigh unto thee and giveth thee air, and Ptah likewise,  who fashioned thy members for thee; thou enterest the horizon with Ra.  Thy soul is received in the Neshem Boat of Osiris, thy soul is made  divine in the House of Keb, and thou art made to be triumphant for ever  and ever.\"    \"Hail, Osiris Kersher! Thy name flourisheth, thy earthly body is  stablished, thy spirit body germinateth, and thou art not repulsed  either in heaven or on earth. Thy face shineth before Ra, thy soul  liveth before Amen, and thy earthly body is renewed before Osiris. Thou  breathest the breath of life for ever and ever. Thy soul maketh  offerings unto thee in the course of each day.... Thy flesh is collected  on thy bones, and thy form is even as it was upon earth. Thou takest  drink into thy body, thou eatest with thy mouth, and thou receivest thy  rations in company with the souls of the gods. Anubis protecteth thee;  he is thy protector, and thou art not turned away from the Gates of the  Tuat. Thoth, the most mighty god, the Lord of Khemenu (Hermopolis),  cometh to thee, and he writeth the 'Book of Breathings' with his own  fingers. Then doth thy soul breathe for ever and ever, and thy form is  renewed with life upon earth; thou art made divine with the souls of the  gods, thy heart is the heart of Ra, and thy limbs are the limbs of the  great god. Amen is nigh unto thee to make thee to live again. Upuat  openeth a prosperous road for thee. Thou seest with thine eyes, thou  hearest with thine ears, thou speakest with thy mouth, thou walkest with  thy legs. Thy soul hath been made divine in the Tuat, so that it may  change itself into any form it pleaseth. Thou canst snuff at will the  odours of the holy Acacia of Anu (An, or Heliopolis). Thou wakest each  day and seest the light of Ra; thou appearest upon the earth each day,  and the 'Book of Breathings' of Thoth is thy protection, for through it  dost thou draw thy breath each day, and through it do thine eyes behold  the beams of the Sun-god Aten. The Goddess of Truth vindicateth thee  before Osiris, and her writings are upon thy tongue. Ra vivifieth thy  soul, the Soul of Shu is in thy nostrils. Thou art even as Osiris, and  'Osiris Khenti Amenti' is thy name. Thy body liveth in Tatu (Busiris),  and thy soul liveth in heaven.... Thy odour is that of the holy gods in  Amentet, and thy name is magnified like the names of the Spirits of  heaven. Thy soul liveth through the 'Book of Breathings,' and it is  rejoined to thy body by the 'Book of Breathings.' These fine extracts  are followed in the British Museum papyrus by the praises of Kersher by  the gods, a prayer of Kersher himself for offerings, and an extract from  the so-called Negative Confession, which has been already described. The  work is closed by an address to the gods, in which it is said that  Kersher is sinless, that he feeds and lives upon Truth, that his deeds  have satisfied the hearts of the gods, and that he has fed the hungry  and given water to the thirsty and clothes to the naked.[2]    [Footnote 1: The deceased is always supposed to be identified with  Osiris.]    [Footnote 2: A papyrus at Florence contains a copy of Part II. of The  Book of Breathings. The fundamental ideas are the same as those in Part  I., but the forms in which they are expressed are different. The  deceased is made to address several gods by name, and to declare that he  himself is those gods. \"I am Ra, I am Atem, I am Osiris, I am Horus, I  am Thoth,\" &c.]    Another late work of considerable interest is the \"Book of Traversing  Eternity,\" the fullest known form of which is found on a papyrus at  Vienna. This work describes how the soul of the deceased, when armed  with the power which the Book of Traversing Eternity will give it, shall  be able to travel from one end of Egypt to the other, and to visit all  the holy places, and to assist at the festivals, and to enjoy communion  not only with the gods and spirits who assemble there, but also with its  kinsfolk and acquaintances whom it left behind alive on the earth. The  object of the book was to secure for the deceased the resurrection of  his body; it opens with the following words: \"Thy soul liveth in heaven  in the presence of Ra. Thy Ka hath acquired the divine nature of the  gods. Thy body remaineth in the deep house (_i.e._ tomb) in the presence  of Osiris. Thy spirit-body becometh glorious among the living. Thy  descendants flourish upon the earth, in the presence of Keb, upon thy  seat among the living, and thy name is stablished by the utterance of  those who have their being through the 'Book of Traversing Eternity.'  Thou comest forth by day, thou art joined to the Sun-god Aten.\" The text  goes on to state that the deceased breathes, speaks, eats, drinks, sees,  hears, and walks, and that all the organs of his body are in their  proper places, and that each is performing its proper functions. He  floats in the air, hovers in the shadow, rises in the sky, follows the  gods, travels with the stars, dekans, and planets, and moves about by  night and by day on earth and in heaven at will.    Of the works that were originally composed for recitation on the days of  the festivals of Osiris, and were specially connected with the cult of  this god, three, which became very popular in the Graeco-Roman period,  may be mentioned. These are: (1) The Lamentations of Isis and Nephthys;  (2) The Festival Songs of Isis and Nephthys; (3) The Book of making  splendid the Spirit of Osiris. The first of these works was recited on  the twenty-fifth day of the fourth month of the season Akhet  (October-November) by two \"fair women,\" who personified Isis and  Nephthys. One of these had the name of Isis on her shoulder, and the  other the name of Nephthys, and each held a vessel of water in her right  hand, and a \"Memphis cake of bread\" in her left. The object of the  recital was to commemorate the resurrection of Osiris, and if the book  were recited on behalf of any deceased person it would make his spirit  to be glorious, and stablish his body, and cause his Ka to rejoice, and  give breath to his nostrils and air to his throat. The two \"fair women\"  sang the sections alternately in the presence of the Kher-heb and Setem  priests. The two first sections, as they are found on a papyrus in  Berlin, read thus:--ISIS SAITH: \"Come to thy house, come to thy house, O  An, come to thy house. Thine enemy [Set] hath perished. O beautiful  youth, come to thy house. Look thou upon me. I am the sister who loveth  thee, go not far from me. O Beautiful Boy, come to thy house,  straightway, straightway. I cannot see thee, and my heart weepeth for  thee; my eyes follow thee about. I am following thee about so that I may  see thee. Lo, I wait to see thee, I wait to see thee; behold, Prince, I  wait to see thee. It is good to see thee, it is good to see thee; O An,  it is "]]]
