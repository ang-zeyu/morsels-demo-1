More than  any one else he brought over into it a new spirit and new forms; and it  is due primarily to his unsurpassed technical skill that the German  language is to-day the best medium for an acquaintance, not only with  the literature of the West, but also with that of the East.

Becomes Interested in India through Schlegel--Influence of        India's Literature on his Poetry--Interest in the Persian        Poets--Persian Influence on Heine--His Attitude toward the        Oriental Movement.      \"Was das Sanskrit-Studium selbst betrifft, so wird ueber den Nutzen  desselben die Zeit entscheiden. Portugiesen, Hollaender und Englaender  haben lange Zeit jahraus, jahrein auf ihren grossen Schiffen die Schaetze  Indiens nach Hause geschleppt; wir Deutsche hatten immer das Zusehen.  Aber die geistigen Schaetze Indiens sollen uns nicht entgehen. Schlegel,  Bopp, Humboldt, Frank u. s. w. sind unsere jetzigen Ostindienfahrer;  Bonn und Muenchen werden gute Faktoreien sein.\"    With these words Heine sent forth his \"Sonettenkranz\" to A.W. von  Schlegel in 1821.[192] These sonnets show what a deep impression the  personality and lectures of the famous romanticist made on him while he  was a student at Bonn, in 1819 and 1820. Schlegel had just then been  appointed to the professorship of Literature at the newly created  university, and to his lectures Heine owed the interest for India which  manifests itself in many of his poems, and which continued even in later  years when his relations to his former teacher had undergone a complete  change.    He never undertook the study of Sanskrit. His interest in India was  purely poetic. \"Aber ich stamme aus Hindostan, und daher fuehle ich mich  so wohl in den breiten Sangeswaeldern Valmikis, die Heldenlieder des  goettlichen Ramo bewegen mein Herz wie ein bekanntes Weh, aus den  Blumenliedern Kalidasas bluehen mir hervor die suessesten Erinnerungen\"  (_Ideen_, vol. v. p. 115)--these words, with some allowance perhaps for  the manner of the satirist, may well be taken to characterize the  poet's attitude towards India. Instinctively he appropriated to himself  the most beautiful characteristics of Sanskrit poetry, its tender love  for the objects of nature, for flowers and animals and the similes and  metaphors inspired thereby, and he invests them with all the grace and  charm peculiar to his muse. Some of his finest verses owe their  inspiration to the lotus; and in that famous poem \"Die Lotosblume  aengstigt,\"--so beautifully set to music by Schumann--the favorite flower  of India's poets may be said to have found its aesthetic apotheosis. As  is well known, there are two kinds of lotuses, the one opening its  leaves to the sun (Skt. _padma_, _pankaja_), the other to the moon (Skt.  _kumuda_, _kairava_). Both kinds are mentioned in _Sakuntala_ (Act. V.  Sc. 4, ed. Kale, Bombay, 1898, p. 141): _kumudanyeva sasankah savita"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],[0,"The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#14)"],[1,"first and refreshments afterward, let me tell you what  little I know of the matter.\"    \"Be as brief as you can,\" snapped Nayland Smith, starting up from the  chair in which he had been seated and beginning restlessly to pace  the floor before the open fireplace--\"as brief as is consistent with  clarity. We have learnt in the past that an hour or less sometimes  means the difference between----\"    He paused, glancing at Sir Baldwin's secretary.    \"Between life and death,\" he added.    Mr. Logan started perceptibly.    \"You alarm me, Mr. Smith,\" he declared; \"for I can conceive of no  earthly manner in which this mysterious Eastern organization of which  Inspector Weymouth speaks, could profit by the death of Sir Baldwin.\"    Nayland Smith suddenly turned and stared grimly at the speaker.    \"I call it death,\" he said harshly, \"to be carried off to the interior  of China, to be made a mere slave, having no will but the great and  evil man who already--already, mark you!--has actually accomplished  such things.\"    \"But Sir Baldwin----\"    \"Sir Baldwin Frazer,\" snapped Smith, \"is the undisputed head of his  particular branch of surgery. Dr. Fu-Manchu may have what he deems  useful employment for such skill as his. But,\" glancing at the clock,  \"we are wasting time. Your story, Mr. Logan.\"    \"It was about half-past twelve last night,\" began the secretary,  closing his eyes as if he were concentrating his mind upon certain  past events, \"when a woman came here and inquired for Sir Baldwin.  The butler informed her that Sir Baldwin was entertaining friends and  that he could receive no professional visitors until the morning.  She was so insistent, however, absolutely declining to go away, that  I was sent for--I have rooms in the house--and I came down to interview  her in the library.\"    \"Be very accurate, Mr. Logan,\" interrupted Smith, \"in your description  of this visitor.\"    \"I shall do my best,\" pursued Logan, closing his eyes again in  concentrated thought. \"She wore evening dress, of a fantastic kind,  markedly Oriental in character, and had large gold rings in her ears.  A green embroidered shawl, with raised figures of white birds as a  design, took the place of a cloak. It was certainly of Eastern  workmanship, possibly Arab; and she wore it about her shoulders with  one corner thrown over her head--again, something like a _burnous_. She  was extremely dark, had jet-black, frizzy hair and very remarkable  eyes, the finest of their type I have ever seen. She possessed beauty  of a sort, of course, but without being exactly vulgar, it was what I  may term _ostentatious;_ and as I entered the library I found myself  at a loss to define her exact place in society--you understand what  I mean?\"    We all nodded comprehendingly and awaited with intense interest the  resumption of the story. Mr. Logan had vividly described the Eurasian  Zarmi, the creature of Dr. Fu-Manchu.    \"When the woman addressed me,\" he continued, \"my surmise that she was  some kind of half-caste, probably a Eurasian, was confirmed by her  broken English. I shall not be misunderstood\"--a slight embarrassment  became perceptible in his manner--\"if I say that the visitor quite  openly tried to bewitch me; and since we are all human, you will  perhaps condone my conduct when I add that she succeeded, in a measure,  inasmuch as I consented to speak to Sir Baldwin, although he was  actually playing bridge at the time.    \"Either my eloquence, or, to put it bluntly, the extraordinary fee  which the woman offered, resulted in Sir Baldwin's agreeing to abandon  his friends and accompany the visitor in a cab which was waiting to  see the patient.\"    \"And who was the patient?\" rapped Smith.    \"According to the woman's account, the patient was her mother, who  had met with a street accident a week before. She gave the name of  the consultant who had been called in, and who, she stated, had  advised the opinion of Sir Baldwin. She represented that the matter  was urgent, and that it might be necessary to perform an operation  immediately in order to save the patient's life.\"    \"But surely,\" I interrupted, in surprise, \"Sir Baldwin did not take  his instruments?\"    \"He took his case with him--yes,\" replied Logan; \"for he in turn  yielded to the appeals of the visitor. The very last words that I  heard him speak as he left the house were to assure her that no such  operation could be undertaken at such short notice in that way.\"    Logan paused, looking around at us a little wearily.    \"And what aroused your suspicions?\" said Smith.    \"My suspicions were aroused at the very moment of Sir Baldwin's  departure, for as I came out onto the steps with him I noticed a  singular thing.\"    \"And that was?\" snapped Smith.    \"Directly Sir Baldwin had entered the cab the woman got out,\" replied  Logan with some excitement in his manner, \"and reclosing the door  took her seat beside the driver of the vehicle--which immediately  moved off.\"    Nayland Smith glanced significantly at me.    \"The cab trick again, Petrie!\" he said; \"scarcely a doubt of it.\" Then,  to Logan: \"Anything else?\"    \"This,\" replied the secretary: \"I thought, although I could not be  sure, that the face of Sir Baldwin peered out of the window for a  moment as the cab moved away from the house, and that there was  strange expression upon it, almost a look of horror. But of course as  there was no light in the cab and the only illumination was that from  the open door, I could not be sure.\"    \"And now tell Mr. Smith,\" said Weymouth, \"how you got confirmation of  your fears.\"    \"I felt very uneasy in my mind,\" continued Logan, \"for the whole  thing was so irregular, and I could not rid my memory of the idea of  Sir Baldwin's face looking out from the cab window. Therefore I rang  up the consultant whose name our visitor had mentioned.\"    \"Yes?\" cried Smith eagerly.    \"He knew nothing whatever of the matter,\" said Logan, \"and had no such  case upon his books! That of course put me in a dreadful state of mind,  but I was naturally anxious to avoid making a fool of myself and  therefore I waited for some hours before mentioning my suspicions to  any one. But when the morning came and no message was received I  determined to communicate with Scotland Yard. The rest of the mystery  it is for you, gentlemen, to unravel.\"        CHAPTER XVI    I TRACK ZARMI      \"What does it mean?\" said Nayland Smith wearily, looking at me through  the haze of tobacco smoke which lay between us. \"A well-known man like  Sir Baldwin Frazer is decoyed away--undoubtedly by the woman Zarmi;  and up to the present moment not so much as a trace of him can be  found. It is mortifying to think that with all the facilities of New  Scotland Yard at our disposal we cannot trace that damnable cab! We  cannot find the headquarters of the group--we cannot _move!_ To sit  here inactive whilst Sir Baldwin Frazer--God knows for what purpose!--  is perhaps being smuggled out of the country, is maddening--maddening!\"  Then, glancing quickly across to me: \"To think ...\"    I rose from my chair, head averted. A tragedy had befallen me which  completely overshadowed all other affairs, great and small. Indeed,  its poignancy was not yet come to its most acute stage; the news was  too recent for that. It had numbed my mind; dulled the pulsing life  within me.    The s.s._Nicobar_, of the Oriental Navigation Line, had arrived at  Tilbury at the scheduled time. My heart leaping joyously in my bosom,  I had hurried on board to meet Karamaneh....    I have sustained some cruel blows in my life; but I can state with  candor that this which now befell me was by far the greatest and the  most crushing I had ever been called upon to bear; a calamity dwarfing  all others which I could imagine.    She had left the ship at Southampton--and had vanished completely.    \"Poor old Petrie,\" said Smith, and clapped his hands upon my shoulders  in his impulsive sympathetic way. \"Don't give up hope! We are not  going to be beaten!\"    \"Smith,\" I interrupted bitterly, \"what chance have we? what chance  have we? We know no more than a child unborn where these people have  their hiding-place, and we haven't a shadow of a clue to guide us to it.\"    His hands resting upon my shoulders and his gray eyes looking  straightly into mine.    \"I can only repeat, old man,\" said my friend, \"don't abandon hope. I  must leave you for an hour or so, and, when I return, possibly I may  have some news.\"    For long enough after Smith's departure I sat there, companioned only  by wretched reflections; then, further inaction seemed impossible; to  move, to be up and doing, to be seeking, questing, became an  imperative necessity. Muffled in a heavy traveling coat I went out  into the wet and dismal night, having no other plan in mind than that  of walking on through the rain-swept streets, on and always on, in an  attempt, vain enough, to escape from the deadly thoughts that pursued  me.    Without having the slightest idea that I had done so, I must have  walked along the Strand, crossed Trafalgar Square, proceeded up the  Haymarket to Piccadilly Circus, and commenced to trudge along at the  Oriental rugs displayed in Messrs. Liberty's window, when an incident  aroused me from the apathy of sorrow in which I was sunken.    \"Tell the cab feller to drive to the north side of Wandsworth Common,\"  said a woman's voice--a voice speaking in broken English, a voice  which electrified me, had me alert and watchful in a moment.    I turned, as the speaker, entering a taxi-cab that was drawn up by the  pavement, gave these directions to the door-porter, who with open  umbrella was in attendance. Just one glimpse I had of her as she  stepped into the cab, but it was sufficient. Indeed, the voice had  been sufficient; but that sinuous shape and that lithe swaying movement  of the hips removed all doubt.    It was Zarmi!    As the cab moved off I ran out into the"]]]
