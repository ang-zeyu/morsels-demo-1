I have now sufficiently proved, that there are hills in the Moone, and  hence it may seeme likely that there is also a world, for since  providence hath some speciall end in all its workes, certainly then  these mountaines were not produced in vaine, and what more probable  meaning can wee conceive there should be, than to make that place  convenient for habitation.          Proposition 10.    _That there is an Atmo-sphaera, or an orbe of grosse vaporous aire,    immediately encompassing the body of the Moone._      As that part of our aire which is neerest to the earth, is of a thicker  substance than the other, by reason tis alwaies mixed with some vapours,  which are continually exhaled into it. So is it equally requisite, that  if there be a world in the Moone, that the aire about that should be  alike qualified with ours. Now, that there is such an orbe of grosse  aire, was first of all (for ought I can reade) observed by _Meslin_,  afterwards assented unto by _Keplar_ and _Galilaeus_,[1] and since by  _Baptistae Cisatus_, _Sheiner_ with others, all of them confirming it by  the same arguments which I shall onely cite, and then leave this  Proposition.      [Sidenote 1: _Vide_ Euseb. Nierem. _de Nat. Hist. l. 2. c. 11._]    1. 'Tis observed, that so much of the Moone as is enlightened, is  alwaies part of a bigger circle then that which is darker. Their  frequent experience hath proved this, and an easie observation may  quickely confirme it. But now this cannot proceede from any other cause  so probable, as from this orbe of aire, especially when we consider how  that planet shining with a borrowed light, doth not send forth any such  rayes as may make her appearance bigger then her body.    2. 'Tis observed in the Solary eclipses, that there is a great  trepidation about the body of the Moone, from which we may likewise  argue an Atmo-sphaera, since we cannot well conceive what so probable a  cause there should be of such an appearance as this,      _Quod radii Solares a vaporibus Lunam ambientibus fuerint    intercisi_,[1]    that the Sun beames were broken and refracted by the vapours that  encompassed the Moone.      [Sidenote 1: _Scheiner. Ros. Vrs. l. 4. pars 2. c. 27._]    3. I may adde the like argument taken from another observation which  will be easily tried and granted. When the Sunne is eclipsed, wee  discerne the Moone as shee is in her owne naturall bignesse, but then  she appeares somewhat lesse then when shee is in the full, though she be  in the same place of her supposed excentrick and epicycle, and therefore  _Tycho_ hath calculated a Table for the Diameter of the divers new  Moones. But now there is no reason so probable to salve this appearance,  as to place an orbe of thicker aire, neere the body of that Planet,  which may be enlightened by the reflected beames, and through which the  direct raies may easily penetrate.    But some may object that this will not consist with that which was  before delivered, where I said, that the thinnest parts had least light.    If this were true, how comes it to passe then, that this aire should be  as bright as any of the other parts, when as tis the thinnest of all?    I answer, if the light be received by reflection, then the thickest body  hath most because it is best able to beare backe the raies, but if the  light be received by illumination[1] (especially if there be an opacous  body behinde, which may double the beames by reflexion) as it is here,  then I deny not but a thinne body may retaine much light, and perhaps,  some of those appearances which wee take for fiery comets, are nothing  else but a bright cloud enlightened, so that probable it is, there may  be such aire without the Moone, and hence it comes to passe, that the  greater spots are onely visible towards her middle parts, and none neere  the circumference, not but that there are some as well in those parts as  else where, but they are not there perceiveable, by reason of those  brighter vapours which hide them.      [Sidenote 1: _Hist. l. 1. c. 7. Sec. 11._]          Proposition 11.    _That as their world is our Moone, so our world is their Moone._      I have already handled the first thing that I promised according to the  Method which _Aristotle_ uses in his Booke _de Mundo_, and shew'd you  the necessary parts that belong to this world in the Moone. In the next  place 'tis requisite that I proceed to those things which are  extrinsecall unto it, as the Seasons, the Meteors, and the Inhabitants.      1. Of the Seasons;    And if there be such a world in the Moone, 'tis requisite then that  their seasons should be some way correspondent unto ours, that they  should have Winter and Summer, night and day, as wee have.    Now that in this Planet there is some similitude of Winter and Summer is  affirmed by _Aristotle_ [1] himselfe, since there is one hemispheare  that hath alwaies heate and light, and the other that hath darknesse and  cold. True indeed, their daies and yeeres are alwaies of one and the  same length, but tis so with us also under the Poles, and therefore that  great difference is not sufficient to make it altogether unlike ours,  nor can we expect that every thing there should be in the same manner as  it is here below, as if nature had no way but one to bring about her  purposes. Wee may easily see what great differences there are amongst  us, betwixt things of the same kinde. Some men (say they) [2] there are,  who can live onely upon smells, without eating any thing, and the same  Plant, saith _Besoldus_, hath sometimes contrary effects. _Mandragora_  which growes in _Syria_ inflames the lust, wheras _Mandragora_ which  grows in other places doth coole the blood & quench lust.      [Sidenote 1: _De gen. animal. l. 4. 12._]      [Sidenote 2: _Plat. de fac._    _De natura populorum. c. 3._]    Now if with us there be such great difference betwixt things of the same  kinde, we have no reason then to thinke it necessary that both these  worlds should be altogether alike, but it may suffice if they bee  correspondent in something onely, however it may be questioned whether  it doth not seeme to be against the wisedome of providence, to make the  night of so great a length, when they have such a long time unfit for  worke? I answere no, since tis so, and more with us also under the  poles; and besides, the generall length of their night is somewhat  abated in the bignesse of their Moone which is our earth. For this  returnes as great a light unto that Planet, as it receives from it. But  for the better proofe of this, I shall first free the way from such  opinions as might otherwise hinder the speede of a clearer progresse.    _Plutarch_[1] one of the chiefe patrons of this world in the Moone, doth  directly contradict this proposition; affirming, that those who live  there may discerne our world as the dregges and sediment of all other  creatures, appearing to them through clouds and foggy mists, and that  altogether devoid of light, being base and unmoveable, so that they  might well imagine the darke place of damnation to be here situate, and  that they onely were the inhabiters of the world, as being in the midst  betwixt Heaven and Hell.      [Sidenote 1: _Plut. de fac. lunae._]    To this I may answere, 'tis probable that _Plutarch_ spake this  inconsiderately, and without a reason, which makes him likewise fall  into another absurditie, when he sayes our earth would appeare  immoveable, whereas questionlesse though it did not, yet would it seeme  to move, and theirs to stand still, as the Land doth to a man in a  Shippe; according to that of the Poet:      _Provehimur portu, terraeque urbesque recedunt._    And I doubt not but that ingenuous Authour would easily have recanted if  hee had beene but acquainted with those experiences which men of latter  times have found out, for the confirmation of this truth.    2. Unto him assents _Macrobius_, whose words are these;      _Terra accepto solis lumine clarescit, tantummodo, non relucet._      \"The earth is by the Sunne-beames made bright, but not able to    enlighten any thing so farre.\"    And his reason is, because this being of a thicke and grosse matter, the  light is terminated in its superficies, and cannot penetrate into the  substance; whereas the moone doth therefore seeme so bright to us,  because it receives the beames within it selfe. But the weaknesse of  this assertion, may bee easily manifest by a common experience, for  polished steele (whose opacity will not give any admittance to the  rayes) reflects a stronger heate then glasse, and so consequently a  greater light.    3. 'Tis the generall consent of Philosophers, that the reflection of the  Sunne-beames from the earth doth not reach much above halfe a mile high,  where they terminate the first region, so that to affirme they might  ascend to the moone, were to say, there were but one region of aier,  which contradicts the proved and received opinion.    Unto this it may be answered:    That it is indeed the common consent, that the reflexion of the  Sunne-beames reach onely to the second region, but yet some there are,  and those too Philosophers of good note, who thought otherwise. Thus  _Plotinus_ is cited by _Caelius_,[1]      _Si concipias te in sublimi quopiam mundi loco, unde oculis    subjiciatur terrae moles aquis circumfusa, & solis syderumque radiis    illustrata, non aliam profecto visam iri probabile est, quam qualis    modo visatur lunaris globi species._      \"If you did conceive your selfe to bee in some such high place,    where you might discerne the whole Globe of the earth and water,    when it was enlightned by the Sunnes rayes, 'tis probable it would    then appeare to you in the same shape as the moone doth now unto us.\"    Thus also _Carolus Malapertius_, whose words are these,[2]      _Terra haec nostra si in luna constituti essemus, splendida prorsus    quasi non ignobilis planeta, nobis appareret._   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19115"],[0,"Roman Britain in 1914 (#14)"],[1,"Roy's time; the width of the camp is unknown.  Cleghorn seems to have been fairly complete, but modern measurers  give its size as 1,000 x 1,700 feet. Dr. Schulten builds on imaginary  foundations when he calls these four camps coeval. He has not even proof  that there were four camps.    Nor is his reason any more convincing for assigning these camps, and  Birrenswark with them, to Agricola. Here he parts company from Roy and  adduces an argument of his own--that Agricola was the only general who  used both eastern and western routes. That is a mere assertion, unproven  and improbable. Roman generals were operating in Scotland in the reigns  of Pius and Marcus (A.D. 140-80) and Septimius Severus; if there were  two routes, it is merely arbitrary to limit these men to the eastern  route. As a matter of fact, the history of the western route is rather  obscure; doubts have been thrown on its very existence north of Birrens.  But if it did exist, the sites most obviously connected with it are the  second-century sites of Birrens, Lyne, and Carstairs; at Birrenswark  itself the only definitely datable finds, four coins, include two issues  of Trajan.[15]    [Footnote 15: Gordon, p. 184, _Minutes of the Soc. Antiq._ i. 183  (2 February, 1725). It has been suggested that Gordon mixed up Birrens  and Birrenswark. But though the Soc. Antiq. Minutes only describe the  coins as 'found in a Roman camp in Annandale, ... the first Roman camp  to be seen in Scotland', Gordon obviously knew more than the Minutes  contain--he gives, e.g. the name of a local antiquary who noted the  find--and the distinction between the 'town' (as it was then thought)  of Middelby (as it was then called) and the camp of Burnswork, was well  recognized in his time.]    The truth is that the question is more complex than Dr. Schulten has  realized. Possibly it is not ripe for solution. I have myself ventured,  in previous publications, to date Birrenswark to Agricola--for reasons  quite different from those of Dr. Schulten. But I would emphasize that  we need, both there and at many earth-camps, full archaeological use of  the spade. The circumstances of the hour are unfavourable to that  altogether.      POSTSCRIPT      _Herefordshire_    (54) As I go to press, I receive the _Transactions of the Woolhope  Naturalists' Field Club_ for 1908-11 (Hereford, 1914), a volume  which, despite the date on its title-page, does not appear to have been  actually issued till April 1915. It contains on pp. 68-73 and 105-9 two  illustrated papers on three Roman roads of Herefordshire--Stone Street,  the puzzling road near Leominster, and Blackwardine, the itinerary  route between Gloucester and Monmouth. The find made at Donnington  in 1906, which is explained on p. 69 as a 'villa' and on p. 109 as an  agrimensorial pit--this latter an impossibility--was, I think, really  a kiln, though there may have been a dwelling-house near. The most  interesting of the Roman finds made lately in Herefordshire, those of  Kenchester, do not come into this volume, but belong in point of date  to the volume which will succeed it.
