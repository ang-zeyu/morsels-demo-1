By the middle of the afternoon they came in sight of Bass Lake, a  beautiful sheet of water about two miles and a half long by nearly half  a mile wide. Close to the south shore lay Pine Island, so called  because it was covered in spots with tall pine trees. Between the main  shore and Pine Island were two smaller islands, and there were low  wooden bridges from one to the other, connecting the big island with  the mainland.    The wagons had already gone over the bridges to the spot selected for  the camp, and now the battalion marched across, from island to island,  under low arching trees and over ground covered with fallen leaves and  moss.    \"What a grand spot for a camp!\"    It was Dick who uttered the words when the final halt was made. His  words were true, and his fellow students agreed with him that Captain  Putnam could not have made a better selection.    There was an open space nearly an acre in extent, covered with short  grass and sloping slightly toward the lake. At the water's edge was a  small wooden dock, where the boats were tied up, and next to this a  sandy strip excellent for bathing purposes. Back of the open space was  a fine grove of trees, to which the students could retire when the sun  became too hot for them. More trees lined the north shore, some hanging  out far over the water, making ideal spots for reading or fishing.  There were beautiful walks through the woods, and in the center of the  island was a rocky hill from the top of which one could obtain a view  of the country for several miles around.    Captain Putnam insisted upon it that the camp be laid out in true  military fashion, and two students who knew a little about civil  engineering put down the necessary stakes. There was a street for each  company, with a tent for the captain and his lieutenants at the head.  Each tent was of the wall pattern and large enough to accommodate four  soldiers. That the flooring of the tent might be kept dry around each a  trench was dug, by which the water could run off when it rained. On the  bottom pine boughs were strewn, giving a delicious smell to the  interior.    \"This smell of pine is very good for a cold in the head,\" said Major  Larry to Dick. \"My sister always uses a pillow filled with pine needles  for that purpose.\"    The students worked hard that evening getting their tents ready for  occupancy and as a consequence all were glad to retire when the proper  time came. Captain Putnam had expected that there would be some  skylarking, but he was mistaken. That was to come later--when the lads  felt more rested.          CHAPTER XVI    THE FIRST DAY ON PINE ISLAND      \"Can anybody tell me where the--er--looking glass is\"?    It was William Philander Tubbs who asked the question. He stood in the  middle of one of the tents, gazing helplessly about him.    \"Beastly way to live, really now it is,\" he continued. \"How is a fellow  to arrange his toilet without a glass\"?    \"Better run down to the lake and look into the water,\" suggested Sam,  who occupied a cot in the tent.    \"Look into the water? Beastly!\" murmured Tubbs. \"Really now, this isn't  like home, is it\"? he continued.    \"It suits me well enough,\" went on Sam, leaping up and beginning to  dress. \"You'll get used to it before long.\"    \"Never, my dear boy, never!\"    As Tubbs spoke he began to put on his coat, but failed to get either of  his hands further than the elbows of the sleeves.    \"What's the matter with this coat\"? he ejaculated. \"Well, I declare!\"    \"What's up now\"? asked another cadet.    \"Somebody has gone and sewed up the sleeves.\"    There was a roar of laughter at this.    \"Mustn't mind a little thing like that,\" said Sam, and he sat down on  the edge of his cot to put on his shoes. \"Great Scott, what's this\"?    He had forced his foot into one shoe and now withdrew it covered with  soft soap.    \"Haw! haw!\" roared Tubbs. \"Rather fancy the laugh is on you now,  Rover.\"    \"That's a fact,\" muttered Sam, and began to clean out the shoe as  quickly as he could.    Several other small jokes had been played, showing that the cadets were  \"tuning up,\" as Major Larry expressed it.    \"I guess I'll have my hands full before the week is out,\" he said to  Dick, in private. \"Keeping order will be no fool of a job.\"    \"Well, you must remember that you liked to have your fling too, when  you were a private, major,\" answered the captain of Company A.    The cooking detail were already preparing breakfast and the aroma of  hot coffee floated throughout the camp. Immediately after roll-call  breakfast was served, of fruit, fish, eggs, bread, and coffee, and the  cadets pitched in with a will.    \"Gives one an appetite to live out in the open,\" said Lieutenant Tom.    \"As if you didn't carry your appetite with you wherever you go,\"  grinned Sam.    \"Silence, Private Rover, or I'll fine you half a day's pay,\" flung back  Tom with a similar grin.    \"My, but we are some pumpkins,\" went on Sam, squaring his shoulders.  \"Wonder how soon we'll get to be a general.\"    \"Perhaps at the next general election,\" suggested George Granbury.    \"Lieutenant Granbury is fined a peanut for punning,\" said Tom severely.  \"Don't do it again and the fine will be remitted.\"    \"That's a fine way to do,\" murmured George, and then Sam shied a tin  plate at him.    As soon as the meal was over there was a drill lasting half an hour,  and then the cadets were permitted to do as they pleased until noon.  Some went boating, some fishing, while others took a swim, or simply  \"knocked around\" as Sam expressed it.    \"I shouldn't mind a swim,\" said Tom. \"Who will go in with me\"?    A dozen cadets were willing, including Dick, Larry, and Fred Garrison.  As it was off time, Larry, even though major, did not feel it necessary  to \"stand on his dignity.\"    \"I'm just going to be as I've always been,\" he told the others. \"If I  can't be that, I don't want to be major.\"    Several tents had been erected close to the water's edge, where the  cadets might undress and don their bathing suits. Tom was the first  ready, and with a run he plunged into the lake head-first.    \"It's glorious!\" he shouted, as he came up and shook the water from his  head. \"Worth a dollar a minute. Come on in!\" And they came, one after  another, without loss of more time. The water was slightly cool, but  the students at Putnam Hall were required to take cold baths weekly, so  they did not mind the temperature. Laughing and shouting gleefully they  dove around in all directions, and then Tom suggested a race.    \"Just the thing!\" said another cadet. \"Where shall we race to\"?    \"Over to yonder rock and back,\" answered Tom. \"Line up, everybody. A  stale biscuit to the winner and a sour cream puff for the last man. All  ready\"?    There was a pause.    \"Start!\" yelled Tom, and made a wild splash that sent the water flying  in all directions.    \"A race! A race!\" shouted one of the students on the shore, and his cry  soon brought a score or more of the others to the spot.    \"I think Tom Rover will win that race.\"    \"I'll bet on Major Larry.\"    \"Fred Garrison is ahead. He's the best swimmer in the school.\"    \"He can't swim as well as Dick Rover.\"    \"I'll bet Jackson wins,\" came from Lew Flapp, who was in the crowd on  the beach. Jackson, it will be remembered, was one of his particular  cronies.    \"Jackson can't swim against Dick Rover,\" came from Songbird Powell, who  had hardly spoken to Flapp since the row at Mike Sherry's resort.    \"I'll bet you a dollar he beats Rover,\" replied the tall boy, in a low  tone.    \"I don't bet, Flapp.\"    \"You're afraid to bet,\" sneered the tall boy.    This statement angered Powell and he quickly dove into his pocket and  pulled out the sum mentioned.    \"This is the time you lose, Flapp,\" he said quietly.    Another student was made stakeholder and each boy passed over his  money.    By this time the race was well underway. Tom was still in the lead, but  Jackson was close behind him, with Larry Colby third and Dick fourth.    \"Go it, Tom, you are sure to win!\" shouted one of his friends.    \"Don't know about that,\" Tom returned pantingly. \"Guess I started too  hard!\" And soon he began to drop behind.    \"Jackson is ahead!\" was the next cry.    \"Major Colby is a close second!\"    \"That is true, but Dick Rover is crawling up!\"    So the cries went on until the big rock that was the turning point was  gained.    Jackson touched the rock first, several seconds before either Larry or  Dick came up. It certainly looked as if Lew Flapp's crony had a good  chance of winning.    \"Told you he would win,\" said Flapp to Powell.    \"The race isn't over yet,\" answered Songbird briefly.    \"Humph! Do you think Dick Rover can catch Jackson when he is five yards  behind\"?    \"Not quite as much as that, Flapp, and he is gradually crawling up.\"    \"He won't make it, I tell you.\"    \"Perhaps he will.\"    \"I'll bet you five to one that he won't,\" insisted the big boy.    \"I won't bet any more.\"    \"You're afraid,\" sneered Flapp.    Again Powell went down into his pocket and drew forth another dollar.    \"There you are,\" he said to the stakeholder.    Lew Flapp had not expected this, but he quickly covered the one dollar  with a five, feeling sure he was going to win.    \"You'll never"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#14)"],[1,"are in distress, but merely from a  thievish disposition, and it will he manifest that half the cases of  theft in England and Wales are not due to the pressure of absolute  want.    But what shall be said of the other half which still represents four  per cent. of the annual amount of crime. According to the calculations  just referred to, the offenders constituting this percentage were not  in work when the crimes charged against them were committed. Was it  destitution arising from want of employment which led them to break  the law? At first sight one may easily be inclined to say that it is.  These people, it will be argued, have no work and no money. What are  they to do but beg or steal? Before jumping at this conclusion it must  not be forgotten that there is such a person as the habitual criminal.  The habitual criminal, as he will very soon tell you if you possess  his confidence absolutely, declines to work. He never has worked, he  does not want work; he prefers living by his wits. With the  recollection of imprisonment fresh upon him an offender of this  description may in rare instances take employment for a short period,  but the regularity of life which work entails is more than he can  bear, and the old occupation of thieving is again resorted to. To live  by plundering the community is the trade of the habitual criminal; it  is the only business he truly cares for, and it is wonderful how long  and how often he will succeed in eluding the suspicion and vigilance  of the police. Of course, offenders of this class, when arrested, say  they are out of work, and will very readily make an unwary person  believe that it is destitution which drives them to desperation. But  as was truly remarked a short time ago by a judge in one of the London  courts, nearly all of these very men are able to pay high fees to  experienced counsel to defend them. After these observations, it will  be seen that the habitual criminal, the man who lives by burglary,  housebreaking, shoplifting, and theft of every description, is not to  be classed among the destitute. Criminals of this character constitute  at least two per cent. of the delinquents annually brought before the  courts.    Respecting the two per cent. of offenders which remain to be accounted  for, it will not be far from the mark to say that destitution is the  immediate cause of their wrong-doing. These offenders are composed of  homeless boys, of old men unable to work, of habitual drunkards who  cannot got a steady job, or keep it when they get it, of vagrants who  divide their time between begging and petty theft, and of workmen on  the tramp, who have become terribly reduced, and will rather steal  than enter a workhouse. The percentage of these offenders varies in  different parts of the country. In the north of England, for instance,  there are comparatively few homeless boys who find their way before  the magistrates on charges of theft; in London, on the other hand, the  number is considerable, and ranges according to the season of the  year, or the state of trade, to between 1 and 3 per cent. of the  criminal population. Why does London enjoy such an evil pre-eminence  in this matter? In my opinion it often arises from the fact that  house-accommodation is so expensive in the metropolis. In London, it  is a habit with many parents, owing to the want of room at home, to  make growing lads shift for themselves at a very early age. These boys  earn just enough to enable them to secure a bare existence; out of  their scanty wages it is impossible to hire a room for themselves;  they have to be contented with the common lodging-house. In such  places these boys have to associate with all sorts of broken-down,  worthless characters, and in numbers of instances they come by degrees  to adopt the habits and modes of life of the class among which their  lot is cast. At the very time parental control is most required it is  almost entirely withdrawn; the lad is left to his own devices; and, in  too many cases, descends into the ranks of crime. The first step in  his downward career begins with the loss of employment; this sometimes  happens through no fault of his own, and is simply the result of a  temporary slackness of trade; but in most instances a job is lost for  want of punctuality or some other boyish irregularity which can only  be properly corrected at home. To lose work is to be deprived of the  means of subsistence; the only openings left are the workhouse or  crime. It is the latter alternative which is generally chosen, and  thus, the lad is launched on the troubled sea of crime.    It must not be understood that all London boys drift into crime after  the manner I have just described. In some instances these unfortunates  have lived all their life in criminal neighbourhoods, and merely  follow the footsteps of the people around them. What, for instance, is  to be expected from children living in streets such as Mr. Charles  Booth describes in his work on \"Life and Labour in East London?\" One  of these streets, which he calls St. Hubert Street, swarms with  children, and in hardly any case does the family occupy more than one  room. The general character of the street is thus depicted. \"An awful  place; the worst street in the district. The inhabitants are mostly of  the lowest class, and seem to lack all idea of cleanliness or decency  .... The children are rarely brought up to any kind of work, but loaf  about, and, no doubt, form the nucleus for future generations of  thieves and other bad characters.\" In this street alone there are  between 160 and 170 children; these children do not require to go to  lodging-houses to be contaminated; they breathe a polluted moral  atmosphere from birth upwards, and it is more than probable that a  considerable proportion of them will help to recruit the army of  crime. It is not destitution which will force them into this course,  but their up-bringing and surroundings.    In addition to homeless boys who steal from destitution, there are, as  I have said, a number of decrepit old men who do the same. There is a  period in a workman's life when he becomes too feeble to do an average  day's work. When this period arrives employers of labour often  discharge him in order to make way for younger and more vigorous men.  If his home, as sometimes happens, is broken up by the death of his  wife, his existence becomes a very lonely and precarious one. An odd  job now and again is all he can get to do, and even these jobs are  often hard to find. His sons and daughters are too heavily encumbered  with large families to be capable of rendering any effective  assistance, and the Union looms gloomily in the distance as the only  prospect before the worn-out worker. But it sometimes happens that he  will not face that prospect. He will rather steal and run the risk of  imprisonment. And so it comes to pass that for a year or two before  finally reconciling himself to the Union, the aged workman will lead a  wandering, criminal life on a petty scale; he becomes an item in the  statistics of offenders against property.    Habitual drunkards form another class who sometimes steal from  destitution. The well-known irregularity of these men's habits  prevents them, in a multitude of cases, from getting work, and  unfortunately, they cannot keep it when they do get it. Employers  cannot depend on them; as soon as they earn a few shillings they  disappear from the workshop till the money is spent on drink. It is at  such times that they are arrested for being drunk and disorderly. As  they can never pay a fine they have to go to prison, but long before  their sentence has expired they have lost their job, and must look out  for something else. If such men do not find work many of them are not  ashamed to steal, and it is only when trade is at flood-tide that they  can be sure of employment, no matter how irregular their habits may  be. At other times they are the first to be discharged and the last to  be engaged. It is not really destitution, but intemperance which turns  them into thieves. That they are destitute when arrested is perfectly  true, but we must go behind the immediate fact of their destitution in  order to arrive at the true causes of their crimes. When this is done  it is found that the stress of economic conditions has very little to  do with making these unhappy beings what they are; on the contrary, it  is in periods of prosperity that they sink to the lowest depths.    Summing up the results of this inquiry into the relations between  destitution and offences against property, we arrive as nearly as  possible at the following figures, so far as England and Wales are  concerned:--    ---------------------------------------------------------------------    Proportion of offences against property to total       offences:                                            8. p. cent.                                                           ---      Thus divided:    Proportion of offenders in work when arrested:          4. p. cent.    Proportion of offenders, habitual thieves:              2. p. cent.    Proportion of offenders, homeless lads and old men:     1. p. cent.    Proportion of offenders, drunkards, tramps:             1. p. cent.                                                           ---                                                            8. p. cent.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------    We shall now proceed to an examination of offences against the  Vagrancy Acts presumably arising from destitution. It has already  been pointed out that seven per cent. of the annual amount of crime  committed in England and Wales consists of offences against the  Vagrancy Acts, and it now remains for us to inquire whether these  offences are the result of destitution, or what part destitution plays  in producing them.
