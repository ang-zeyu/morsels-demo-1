He who is not ready to suffer all things, and to conform to  the will of the Beloved, is not worthy to be called a lover of  God.  It behoveth him who loveth to embrace willingly all hard  and bitter things for the Beloved's sake, and not to be drawn  away from Him because of any contrary accidents.    (1) 2 Corinthians i. 3.      CHAPTER VI    Of the proving of the true lover    \"My Son, thou art not yet strong and prudent in thy love.\"    2. Wherefore, O my Lord?    3. \"Because for a little opposition thou fallest away from thy  undertakings, and too eagerly seekest after consolation.  The  strong lover standeth fast in temptations, and believeth not the  evil persuasions of the enemy.  As in prosperity I please him, so  in adversity I do not displease.    4. \"The prudent lover considereth not the gift of the lover so  much as the love of the giver.  He looketh for the affection more  than the value, and setteth all gifts lower than the Beloved.  The noble lover resteth not in the gift, but in Me above every  gift.    5. \"All is not lost, though thou sometimes think of Me or of My  saints, less than thou shouldest desire.  That good and sweet  affection which thou sometimes perceivest is the effect of  present grace and some foretaste of the heavenly country; but  hereon thou must not too much depend, for it goeth and cometh.  But to strive against the evil motions of the mind which come to  us, and to resist the suggestions of the devil, is a token of  virtue and great merit.    6. \"Therefore let not strange fancies disturb thee, whencesoever  they arise.  Bravely observe thy purpose and thy upright  intentions towards God.  It is not an illusion when thou art  sometimes suddenly carried away into rapture, and then suddenly  art brought back to the wonted vanities of thy heart.  For thou  dost rather unwillingly undergo them than cause them; and so long  as they displease thee and thou strivest against them, it is a  merit and no loss.    7. \"Know thou that thine old enemy altogether striveth to hinder  thy pursuit after good, and to deter thee from every godly  exercise, to wit, the contemplation of the Saints, the pious  remembrance of My passion, the profitable recollection of sin,  the keeping of thy own heart, and the steadfast purpose to grow  in virtue.  He suggesteth to thee many evil thoughts, that he may  work in thee weariness and terror, and so draw thee away from  prayer and holy reading.  Humble confession displeaseth him, and  if he were able he would make thee to cease from Communion.  Believe him not, nor heed him, though many a time he hath laid  for thee the snares of deceit.  Account it to be from him, when  he suggesteth evil and unclean thoughts.  Say unto him, 'Depart  unclean spirit; put on shame, miserable one; horribly unclean art  thou, who bringest such things to mine ears.  Depart from me,  detestable deceiver; thou shalt have no part in me; but Jesus  shall be with me, as a strong warrior, and thou shalt stand  confounded.  Rather would I die and bear all suffering, than  consent unto thee.  Hold thy peace and be dumb; I will not hear  thee more, though thou plottest more snares against me.  The Lord  is my light and my salvation: whom then shall I fear?  Though a  host of men should rise up against me, yet shall not my heart be  afraid.  The Lord is my strength and my Redeemer.'(1)    8. \"Strive thou like a good soldier; and if sometimes thou fail  through weakness, put on thy strength more bravely than before,  trusting in My more abundant grace, and take thou much heed of  vain confidence and pride.  Because of it many are led into  error, and sometimes fall into blindness well-nigh irremediable.  Let this ruin of the proud, who foolishly lift themselves up, be  to thee for a warning and a continual exhortation to humility.\"    (1) Psalms xxvii. 1-3; xix. 14.      CHAPTER VII    Of hiding our grace under the guard of humility    \"My Son, it is better and safer for thee to hide the grace of  devotion, and not to lift thyself up on high, nor to speak much  thereof, nor to value it greatly; but rather to despise thyself,  and to fear as though this grace were given to one unworthy  thereof.  Nor must thou depend too much upon this feeling, for it  can very quickly be turned into its opposite.  Think when thou  art in a state of grace how miserable and poor thou art wont to  be without grace.  Nor is there advance in spiritual life in this  alone, that thou hast the grace of consolation, but that thou  humbly and unselfishly and patiently takest the withdrawal  thereof; so that thou cease not from the exercise of prayer, nor  suffer thy other common duties to be in anywise neglected; rather  do thy task more readily, as though thou hadst gained more  strength and knowledge; and do not altogether neglect thyself  because of the dearth and anxiety of spirit which thou feelest.    2. \"For there are many who, when things have not gone prosperous  with them, become forthwith impatient or slothful.  For the way  of a man is not in himself,(1) but it is God's to give and to  console, when He will, and as much as He will, and whom He will,  as it shall please Him, and no further.  Some who were  presumptuous because of the grace of devotion within them, have  destroyed themselves, because they would do more than they were  able, not considering the measure of their own littleness, but  rather following the impulse of the heart than the judgment of  the reason.  And because they presumed beyond what was  well-pleasing unto God, therefore they quickly lost grace.  They  became poor and were left vile, who had built for themselves  their nest in heaven; so that being humbled and stricken with  poverty, they might learn not to fly with their own wings, but  to put their trust under My feathers.  They who are as yet new  and unskilled in the way of the Lord, unless they rule themselves  after the counsel of the wise, may easily be deceived and led  away.    3. \"But if they wish to follow their own fancies rather than  trust the experience of others, the result will be very dangerous  to them if they still refuse to be drawn away from their own  notion.  Those who are wise in their own conceits, seldom  patiently endure to be ruled by others.  It is better to have a  small portion of wisdom with humility, and a slender  understanding, than great treasures of sciences with vain  self-esteem.  It is better for thee to have less than much of  what may make thee proud.  He doeth not very discreetly who  giveth up himself entirely to joy, forgetting his former  helplessness and the chaste fear of the Lord, which feareth to  lose the grace offered.  Nor is he very wise, after a manly sort,  who in time of adversity, or any trouble whatsoever, beareth  himself too despairingly, and feeleth concerning Me less  trustfully than he ought.    4. \"He who in time of peace willeth to be oversecure shall be  often found in time of war overdispirited and full of fears.  If  thou knewest always how to continue humble and moderate in  thyself, and to guide and rule thine own spirit well, thou  wouldest not so quickly fall into danger and mischief.  It is  good counsel that when fervour of spirit is kindled, thou  shouldest meditate how it will be with thee when the light is  taken away.  Which when it doth happen, remember that still the  light may return again, which I have taken away for a time for a  warning to thee, and also for mine own glory.  Such a trial is  often more useful than if thou hadst always things prosperous  according to thine own will.    5. \"For merits are not to be reckoned by this, that a man hath  many visions or consolations, or that he is skilled in the  Scriptures, or that he is placed in a high situation; but that he  is grounded upon true humility and filled with divine charity,  that he always purely and uprightly seeketh the honour of God,  that he setteth not by himself, but unfeignedly despiseth  himself, and even rejoiceth to be despised and humbled by others  more than to be honoured.\"    (1) Jeremiah x. 23.      CHAPTER VIII    Of a low estimation of self in the sight of God    I will speak unto my Lord who am but dust and ashes.  If I count  myself more, behold Thou standest against me, and my iniquities  bear true testimony, and I cannot gainsay it.  But if I abase  myself, and bring myself to nought, and shrink from all  self-esteem, and grind myself to dust, which I am, Thy grace will  be favourable unto me, and Thy light will be near unto my heart;  and all self-esteem, how little soever it be, shall be swallowed  up in the depths of my nothingness, and shall perish for ever.  There Thou showest to me myself, what I am, what I was, and  whither I have come: so foolish was I and ignorant.(1)  If I am  left to myself, behold I am nothing, I am all weakness; but if  suddenly Thou look upon me, immediately I am made strong, and  filled with new joy.  And it is great marvel that I am so  suddenly lifted up, and so graciously embraced by Thee, since I  am always being carried to the deep by my own weight.    2. This is the doing of Thy love which freely goeth before me and  succoureth me in so many necessities, which guardeth me also in  great dangers and snatcheth me, as I may truly say, from  innumerable evils.  For verily, by loving myself amiss, I lost  myself, and by seeking and sincerely loving Thee alone, I found  both myself and Thee, and through love I have brought myself to  yet deeper nothingness: because Thou, O most sweet Lord, dealest  with me beyond all merit, and above all which I dare ask or  think.    3. Blessed be Thou, O my God, because though I be unworthy of all  Thy benefits, Thy bountiful and infinite goodness never ceaseth  to do good even to ingrates and to those who are turned far from  Thee.  Turn Thou us unto Thyself, that we may be grateful,  humble, and godly, for Thou art our salvation, our courage, and  our strength.

The Verger was bound to be a  bachelor, because, said the statute, \"having a wife is a troublesome  and disturbing affair, and husbands are apt to study the wishes of  their wives or their mistresses, and no man can serve two masters.\"    The Chancellor kept charge of the correspondence of the Chapter, and  also superintended the schools belonging to the cathedral.    The Archdeacons of London, Middlesex, and Colchester had their own  stalls in the cathedral, but had no voice in the Chapter.    The Minor Canons, twelve in number, formed a separate college, founded  in the time of Richard II. They were, of course, under the authority  of the cathedral, though they had independent estates of their own.    The Scriptorium of St. Paul's was an important department, and was  well managed. Much of the work produced in it perished in the fire;  but there are some of its manuscripts still happily preserved, notably  the _Majora Statuta_ of the cathedral, in the Library there, and a  magnificent folio of Diceto's History, now in Lambeth Library.    Incidental notice has been taken in the preceding pages of Chantries  in St. Paul's, but we have to speak more fully of these, for they  formed a very large source of income, especially to the Residentiary  Canons. These Chantries were founded for saying masses for the souls  of the departed, even to the end of the world. St. Paul's was almost  beyond measure rich in them. The oldest was founded in the reign of  Henry II., after which time they multiplied so fast that it would  be impossible to enumerate them all here. There is a return of them  (quoted at length by Dugdale), which was made by order of King Edward  VI. Take the description of the second of them as he gives it. \"The  next was ordained by Richard, surnamed Nigell [Fitzneal], Bishop of  London in King Richard I.'s time, who having built two altars in this  cathedral, the one dedicated to St. Thomas the Martyr, and the other  to St. Dionis, assigned eight marks yearly rent, to be received out  of the church of Cestreheart, for the maintaining of two priests  celebrating every day thereat; viz., one for the good estate of the  King of England and Bishop of London for the time being; as also for  all the congregation of this church, and the faithful parishioners  belonging thereto, and the other for the souls of the Kings of England  and Bishops of London, and all the faithful deceased: which grant was  confirmed by the Chapter.\" This is a fair specimen; they go on page  after page in Dugdale's folio. William de Sanctae Mariae ecclesia (he  was Dean 1241-1243) leaves 120 marks for bread and beer yearly to  a priest who shall celebrate for his soul and for the souls of his  predecessors, successors, parents, and benefactors. Sometimes special  altars are named at which the Mass is to be said, \"St. Chad, St.  Nicholas, St. Ethelbert the King, St. Radegund, St. James, the twelve  Apostles, St. John the Evangelist, St. John Baptist, St. Erkenwald,  St. Sylvester, St. Michael, St. Katharine.\" I take them as they  come in the successive testaments. The following passage is worth  quoting:--\"In 19 Ed. II. Roger de Waltham, a Canon of this church,  enfeoft the Dean and Chapter of certain messuages and shops lying  within the city of London, for the support of two priests to pray  perpetually for his soul, and for the souls of his parents and  benefactors, within the chapel of St. John the Baptist in the south  part of this cathedral; as also for the soul of Antony Beck, Patriarch  of Jerusalem, and Bishop of Durham. And further directed that out  of the revenue of these messuages, &c., there should be a yearly  allowance to the said Dean and Chapter, to keep solemn processions in  this church on the several days of the invention and exaltation of the  Holy Cross, as also of St. John Baptist; wearing their copes at those  times in such sort as they used on all the great festivals; and  likewise out of his high devotion to the service of God, and that it  should be the more venerably performed therein, he gave divers costly  vestments thereto, some whereof were set with precious stones,  expressly directing that in all masses wherein himself by particular  name was to be commended, as also at his anniversary, and in those  festivals of the Holy Cross, St. John Baptist, and St. Laurence the  Deacon, they should be used. And, moreover, out of his abundant piety  he founded a certain Oratory on the south side of the Choir in this  cathedral, towards the upper end thereof, to the honour of God, our  Lady, St. Laurence, and All Saints, and adorned it with the images  of our blessed Saviour, St. John Baptist, St. Laurence, and St. Mary  Magdalene; so likewise with the pictures of the celestial Hierarchy,  the joys of the blessed Virgin, and others, both in the roof about  the altar, and other places within and without; in which Oratory the  chantry before mentioned was placed, and the said anniversary to be  kept. And, lastly, in the south wall, opposite to the said Oratory,  erected a glorious tabernacle, which contained the image of the  said blessed Virgin, sitting as it were in childbed; as also of our  Saviour, in swaddling clothes, lying between the ox and the ass, and  St. Joseph at her feet; above which was another image of her, standing  with the child in her arms. And on the beam, thwarting from the upper  end of the Oratory to the before-specified childbed, placed the  crowned images of our Saviour and his mother sitting in one  tabernacle; as also the images of St. Katharine and St. Margaret,  virgins and martyrs; neither was there any part of the said Oratory,  or roof thereof, but he caused it to be beautified with comely  pictures and images, to the end that the memory of our blessed Saviour  and His saints, especially of the glorious Virgin, His mother, might  be always the more famous: in which Oratory he designed that his  sepulture should be.\"    [Illustration: JOHN FISHER, BISHOP OF ROCHESTER. _After Holbein_.  _British Museum_.]    [Illustration: ST.

Fourteenth Century. British Museum,  29902._]      Bishop Richard of Gravesend (d. at Fulham, 1306) made his will at his  Manor House of Haringay, in 1302. It is written with his own hand, and  the opening words are: \"Imprimis, Tibi, o pie Redemptor, et potens  Salvator animarum, Domine Jesu Christe, animam meam commendo; Tibi  etiam, o summe Sacerdos et vere Pontifex animarum, commendo universam  plebem Londonensis civitatis et diocaesis; obsecrans te, per medicinam  vulnerum tuorum, qui in cruce pependisti, ut mihi et ipsis, concessa  perfecta venia peccatorum, concedas nos ad tuam misericordiam  pervenire, et frui beatitudine, tuis electis perenniter repromissa.\"  After which he goes on to direct that he shall be buried close to his  predecessor, Henry de Sandwiche, whom he calls his special benefactor,  and that the marble covering his grave shall not rise higher than  the pavement; that out of his personal estate, consisting of books,  household goods, corn and cattle, which together is valued at 2000  marks, 140_l_. shall be given to the poor, 100 marks to the new fabric  of the cathedral, and that lands of the value of 10_l_. a year shall  be bought for the founding of a chantry here for his soul, and for the  keeping of his anniversary.    In the Inventory of his goods we have interesting information about  values: wheat is reckoned at 4_s_. the quarter, peas at 2_s_. 6_d._,  and oats at 2_s._ Bulls are worth 7_s._ 4_d._ each, kine 6_s._, fat  muttons 1_s._, ewes 8_d._, capons 2_d._, cocks and hens 1_d._ His  nephew, Stephen, who succeeded him thirteen years later, allows only  100 marks for the expenses of his funeral, quoting St. Augustine that  funeral parade may be a certain comfort to the living, but is of no  advantage to the dead. He disposes of 140_l._ to the poor tenants on  his manors. Bishop Michael Northburgh (d. 1362) left the rents of  certain houses which he had built at Fulham for a chantry priest, who  was to be appointed by the Bishop of London. He also desired to be  buried on the same day he died, with his face exposed to view, outside  the west door of the cathedral. His endowment of the chantry being  judged to be insufficient, one of the nominated chantry priests gave a  further endowment for it. This Bishop Northburgh left 2000_l._ for  the completion of the house of the Carthusians (Charter House) in  co-operation with Sir Walter Manny. He also left 1000 marks to be put  into a chest in the Cathedral Treasury, out of which any poor layman  might, for a sufficient pledge, borrow 10_l._, the Dean and principal  Canons 20_l._ upon the like pledge; the Bishop 40_l._; other noblemen  or citizens 20_l._ for the term of a year. If at the year's end the  money was not repaid, the preacher at Paul's Cross was to notify the  fact, and to announce that the pledge would be sold within fourteen  days if it were not redeemed, and any surplus from the sale would be  handed to the borrower, or his executors. If there were no executors  then the money was to go back to the chest, and be spent for the  health of his soul. There were three keys to the chest, one was kept  by the Dean, another by the oldest Canon-resident, and the third by a  Warden appointed by the Chapter.    One keeps on finding benefactions of this sort. In"]]]
