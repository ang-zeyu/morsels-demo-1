'Not on those conditions,' replied our Captain, with provoking  coolness;--'Come on, my boys, another volley.' No sooner said than  done, and even with more fury than before. Like men driven to despair,  who expect no quarter on surrendering, the little urchins daringly  mounted the window seat, which was a broad, old-fashioned one, and  pointed the fire arms and heated poker at him; whilst others advanced  with the squibs and missiles. 'Come on, my lads,' said the captain,  'let this be our Thermopylae, and I will be your Leonidas.' And,  indeed, so daring were they, that each seemed ready to emulate the  Spartans of old. The master, perceiving their determined obstinacy,  turned round, without further remonstrance, and indignantly walked  away.    \"Relieved from our terrors, we now became intoxicated with joy. The  walls rang with repeated hurrahs! In the madness of enthusiasm, some  of the boys began to tear up the forms, throw the books about, break  the slates, locks, and cupboards, and act so outrageously that the  captain called them to order; not, however, before the master's desk  and drawers had been broken open, and every play thing which had been  taken from the scholars restored to its owner.    \"We now began to think of provisions. They were all placed on one  table and dealt out in rations by the Captains of each company. In the  meantime, we held a council of war, as we called it, to determine on  what was to be done.    \"In a recess at the east end of the school there stood a large oak  chest, black with age, whose heavy hinges had become corroded with  years of rust. It was known to contain the records and endowments of  the school; and, as we presumed, the regulations for the treatment of  the scholars. The oldest boy had never seen its inside. Attempts,  dictated by insatiable curiosity, had often been made to open it; but  it was deemed impregnable. It was guarded by three immense locks, and  each key was in the possession of different persons. The wood appeared  to be nearly half a foot thick, and every corner was plaited with  iron. All eyes were instinctively directed to this mysterious chest.  Could any means be devised for effecting an entrance? was the natural  question. We all proceeded to reconnoitre; we attempted to move it,  but in vain: we made some feeble efforts to force the lid; it was firm  as a block of marble. At length, one daring urchin brought, from the  fire-place, a red-hot poker, and began to bore through its sides. A  universal shout was given. Other pokers were brought, and to work they  went. The smoke and tremendous smell which the old wood sent forth  rather alarmed us. We were apprehensive that we might burn the records  instead of obtaining a copy of them. This arrested our progress for a  few minutes.    \"At this critical moment a shout was set up that the parson  and a constable was coming! Down went the pokers; and, as if  conscience-stricken, we were all seized with consternation. The  casement window was so shattered that it could easily be entered by  any resolute fellow. In the desperation of the moment we seized the  desks, forms, and stools to block it up; but, in some degree, our  courage had evaporated, and we felt reluctant to act on the offensive.  The old gentleman and his attendant deliberately inspected the windows  and fastenings: but, without making any attempt to enter, they  retreated for the purpose, we presumed, of obtaining additional  assistance. What was now to be done? The master appeared obdurate, and  we had gone too far to recede. Some proposed to drill a hole in the  window seat, fill it with gunpowder, and explode it if any one  attempted to enter. Others thought we had better prepare to set fire  to the school sooner than surrender unconditionally. But the majority  advised what was, perhaps, the most prudent resolution, to wait for  another attack; and, if we saw no hopes of sustaining a longer  defence, to make the best retreat we could.    \"The affair of the Barring Out had now become known, and persons began  to assemble round the windows, calling out that the master was coming  with assistance, and saying everything to intimidate us. Many of us  were completely jaded with the over-excitement we had experienced  since the previous evening. The school was hot, close, and full of  smoke. Some were longing for liberty and fresh air; and most of us  were now of opinion that we had engaged in an affair which it was  impossible to accomplish. In this state of mind we received another  visit from our dreaded master. With his stick he commenced a more  furious attack than before; and, observing us less turbulent, he  appeared determined to force his way in spite of the barricadoes. The  younger boys thought of nothing but flight and self-preservation, and  the rush to the back windows became general. In the midst of this  consternation our Captain exclaims, 'Let us not fly like cowards; if  we must surrender, let the gates of the citadel be thrown open: the  day is against us; but let us bravely face the enemy, and march out  with the honours of war.' Some few had already escaped; but the rest  immediately ranged themselves on each side of the school, in two  extended lines, with their weapons in hand. The door was thrown  open--the master instantly entered, and passed between the two lines,  denouncing vengeance on us all. But, as he marched in we marched out  in military order; and, giving three cheers, we dispersed into the  neighbouring fields.    \"We shortly met again, and, after a little consultation, it was  determined that none of the leaders should come to school until sent  for, and a free pardon given.    \"The defection, however, was so general that no corporal punishments  took place. Many of the boys did not return till after the holidays:  and several of the elder ones never entered the school again.\"    This curious custom can hardly be considered as dead, for a writer,  mentioning it in _Notes and Queries_ for December 22, 1888 (7th  series, vi. p. 484), says: \"This old custom, strange to say, still  exists, in spite of the schoolmaster and the Board School. It may be  of interest to some of your readers if I give an extract from a letter  to the Dalston (Carlisle) School Board in reference to this subject,  received at their last meeting on December 7th. 'I would ask the  sanction of the Board for the closing of the school for the Vacation  on the evening of Thursday the 20th. If we open on the Friday we  shall, most likely, have a poor attendance. My principal reason for  asking is that we should be thus better able to effectually put a stop  to the old barbarous custom of Barring Out. Some of the children might  possibly be persuaded by outsiders to make the attempt on Friday, and  in such a case I should feel it my duty to inflict an amount of  castigation on offenders such as neither they nor myself would  relish.'    \"The majority of the Board sympathised with the Master's difficulty  and granted his request; though as Chairman I expressed my curiosity  to see the repetition of a custom I had heard so much about.\"          CHAPTER VIII         The Bellman--Descriptions of him--His verses. The       Waits--Their origin--Ned Ward on them--Corporation       Waits--York Waits (17th Century)--Essay on       Waits--Westminster Waits--Modern Waits.      Before the advent of Christmas the Bellman, or Watchman, left at each  house a copy of verses ostensibly breathing good-will and a happy  Christmas to the occupants, but in reality as a reminder to them of  his existence, and that he would call in due time for his Christmas  box. The date of the institution of the Bellman is not well defined.  In Tegg's _Dictionary of Chronology_, 1530 is given, but no authority  for the statement is adduced; Machyn, in his diary, is more definite  \"[the xij. day of January 1556-7, in Alderman Draper's ward called]  chordwenerstrett ward, a belle man [went about] with a belle at evere  lane, and at the ward [end to] gyff warnyng of ffyre and candyll  lyght, [and to help the] poure, and pray for the ded.\" Their cry  being, \"Take care of your fire and candle, be charitable to the poor,  and pray for the dead.\"    Shakespeare knew him, for in _Macbeth_ (Act II. sc. 2) he says:         It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bell man,       Which gives the stern'st good night.    And Milton mentions him in _Il Penseroso_:         Or the bellman's drowsy charm,       To bless the doors from nightly harm.    Herrick also celebrates _The Bellman_:         From noise of Scare-fires rest ye free,       From Murders _Benedicite_.       From all mischances, that may fright       Your pleasing slumbers in the night;       Mercie secure ye all, and keep       The Goblin from ye, while ye sleep.       Past one o'clock, and almost two,       My Masters all, _Good day to you_.    On the title page of Decker's _Belman of London_ (ed. 1608) we have a  woodcut giving a vivid portrait of the Bellman going his nightly  rounds with his pike upon his shoulder, a horn lanthorn, with a candle  inside, in one hand, and his bell, which is attached by a strap to his  girdle, in the other hand, his faithful dog following him in his  nightly rounds. In his _Lanthorne and Candle light; or The Bell-man's  second Night's walke_, ed. 1608, the title page gives us a totally  different type of Bellman, carrying both bell and lanthorn, but  bearing no pike, nor is he accompanied by a dog. In his _O per se O_,  ed. 1612, is another type of Bellman, with lanthorn, bell, and brown  bill on his shoulder, but no dog. And in his _Villanies Discovered by  Lanthorne and Candle Light_, etc., ed. 1620, we have two more and yet  different"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19980"],[0,"A Joy For Ever (and Its Price in the Market) (#14)"],[1,"I know there are many  political economists, who would rather leave a bag of gold on a  garret-table, than give a porter sixpence extra to carry it downstairs.    That, then, is the first practical outcome of the matter. Never grumble,  but be glad when you hear of a new picture being bought at a large  price. In the long run, the dearest pictures are always the best  bargains; and, I repeat, (for else you might think I said it in mere  hurry of talk, and not deliberately,) there are some pictures which are  without price. You should stand, nationally, at the edge of Dover  cliffs--Shakespeare's--and wave blank cheques in the eyes of the nations  on the other side of the sea, freely offered, for such and such canvases  of theirs.      90. Then the next practical outcome of it is--Never buy a copy of a  picture, under any circumstances whatever. All copies are bad; because  no painter who is worth a straw ever _will_ copy. He will make a study  of a picture he likes, for his own use, in his own way; but he won't and  can't copy. Whenever you buy a copy, you buy so much misunderstanding of  the original, and encourage a dull person in following a business he is  not fit for, besides increasing ultimately chances of mistake and  imposture, and farthering, as directly as money _can_ farther, the cause  of ignorance in all directions. You may, in fact, consider yourself as  having purchased a certain quantity of mistakes; and, according to your  power, being engaged in disseminating them.      91. I do not mean, however, that copies should never be made. A certain  number of dull persons should always be employed by a Government in  making the most accurate copies possible of all good pictures; these  copies, though artistically valueless, would be historically and  documentarily valuable, in the event of the destruction of the original  picture. The studies also made by great artists for their own use,  should be sought after with the greatest eagerness; they are often to be  bought cheap; and in connection with the mechanical copies, would become  very precious: tracings from frescoes and other large works are also of  great value; for though a tracing is liable to just as many mistakes as  a copy, the mistakes in a tracing are of one kind only, which may be  allowed for, but the mistakes of a common copyist are of all conceivable  kinds: finally, engravings, in so far as they convey certain facts about  the pictures, without pretending adequately to represent or give an idea  of the pictures, are often serviceable and valuable. I can't, of course,  enter into details in these matters just now; only this main piece of  advice I can safely give you--never to buy copies of pictures (for your  private possession) which pretend to give a facsimile that shall be in  any wise representative of, or equal to, the original. Whenever you do  so, you are only lowering your taste, and wasting your money. And if  you are generous and wise, you will be ready rather to subscribe as much  as you would have given for a copy of a great picture towards its  purchase, or the purchase of some other like it, by the nation. There  ought to be a great National Society instituted for the purchase of  pictures; presenting them to the various galleries in our great cities,  and watching there over their safety: but in the meantime, you can  always act safely and beneficially by merely allowing your artist  friends to buy pictures for you, when they see good ones. Never buy for  yourselves, nor go to the foreign dealers; but let any painter whom you  know be entrusted, when he finds a neglected old picture in an old  house, to try if he cannot get it for you; then, if you like it, keep  it; if not, send it to the hammer, and you will find that you do not  lose money on pictures so purchased.      92. And the third and chief practical outcome of the matter is this  general one: Wherever you go, whatever you do, act more for  _preservation_ and less for _production_. I assure you, the world is,  generally speaking, in calamitous disorder, and just because you have  managed to thrust some of the lumber aside, and get an available corner  for yourselves, you think you should do nothing but sit spinning in it  all day long--while, as householders and economists, your first thought  and effort should be, to set things more square all about you. Try to  set the ground floors in order, and get the rottenness out of your  granaries. _Then_ sit and spin, but not till then.      93. IV. DISTRIBUTION.--And now, lastly, we come to the fourth great head  of our inquiry, the question of the wise distribution of the art we have  gathered and preserved. It must be evident to us, at a moment's thought,  that the way in which works of art are on the whole most useful to the  nation to which they belong, must be by their collection in public  galleries, supposing those galleries properly managed. But there is one  disadvantage attached necessarily to gallery exhibition--namely, the  extent of mischief which may be done by one foolish curator. As long as  the pictures which form the national wealth are disposed in private  collections, the chance is always that the people who buy them will be  just the people who are fond of them; and that the sense of exchangeable  value in the commodity they possess, will induce them, even if they do  not esteem it themselves, to take such care of it as will preserve its  value undiminished. At all events, so long as works of art are scattered  through the nation, no universal destruction of them is possible; a  certain average only are lost by accidents from time to time. But when  they are once collected in a large public gallery, if the appointment of  curator becomes in any way a matter of formality, or the post is so  lucrative as to be disputed by place-hunters, let but one foolish or  careless person get possession of it, and perhaps you may have all your  fine pictures repainted, and the national property destroyed, in a  month. That is actually the case at this moment, in several great  foreign galleries. They are the places of execution of pictures: over  their doors you only want the Dantesque inscription, \"Lasciate ogni  speranza, voi che entrate.\"      94. Supposing, however, this danger properly guarded against, as it  would be always by a nation which either knew the value, or understood  the meaning, of painting,[12] arrangement in a public gallery is the  safest, as well as the most serviceable, method of exhibiting pictures;  and it is the only mode in which their historical value can be brought  out, and their historical meaning made clear. But great good is also to  be done by encouraging the private possession of pictures; partly as a  means of study, (much more being always discovered in any work of art by  a person who has it perpetually near him than by one who only sees it  from time to time,) and also as a means of refining the habits and  touching the hearts of the masses of the nation in their domestic life.    [Note 12: It would be a great point gained towards the preservation  of pictures if it were made a rule that at every operation they  underwent, the exact spots in which they have been repainted should be  recorded in writing.]      95. For these last purposes, the most serviceable art is the living art  of the time; the particular tastes of the people will be best met, and  their particular ignorances best corrected, by painters labouring in the  midst of them, more or less guided to the knowledge of what is wanted by  the degree of sympathy with which their work is received. So then,  generally, it should be the object of government, and of all patrons of  art, to collect, as far as may be, the works of dead masters in public  galleries, arranging them so as to illustrate the history of nations,  and the progress and influence of their arts; and to encourage the  private possession of the works of _living_ masters. And the first and  best way in which to encourage such private possession is, of course, to  keep down the prices of them as far as you can.    I hope there are not a great many painters in the room; if there are, I  entreat their patience for the next quarter of an hour: if they will  bear with me for so long, I hope they will not, finally, be offended by  what I am going to say.      96. I repeat, trusting to their indulgence in the interim, that the  first object of our national economy, as respects the distribution of  modern art, should be steadily and rationally to limit its prices, since  by doing so, you will produce two effects: you will make the painters  produce more pictures, two or three instead of one, if they wish to make  money; and you will, by bringing good pictures within the reach of  people of moderate income, excite the general interest of the nation in  them, increase a thousandfold the demand for the commodity, and  therefore its wholesome and natural production.      97. I know how many objections must arise in your minds at this moment  to what I say; but you must be aware that it is not possible for me in  an hour to explain all the moral and commercial bearings of such a  principle as this. Only, believe me, I do not speak lightly; I think I  have considered all the objections which could be rationally brought  forward, though I have time at present only to glance at the main  one--namely, the idea that the high prices paid for modern pictures are  either honourable, or serviceable, to the painter. So far from this  being so, I believe one of the principal obstacles to the progress of  modern art to be the high prices given for good modern pictures. For  observe first the action of this high remuneration on the artist's mind.  If he \"gets on,\" as it is called, catches the eye of the public, and  especially of the public of the upper classes, there is hardly any limit  to the fortune he may acquire; so that, in his early years, his mind is"]]]
