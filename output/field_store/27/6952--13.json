I  give Thee thanks, also, for having sent down upon me from the clouds of  Thy will that which hath so sanctified me from the hints of the infidels  and the allusions of the misbelievers that I have fixed my heart firmly on  Thee, and fled from such as have denied the light of Thy countenance.  Again I thank Thee for having empowered me to be steadfast in Thy love,  and to speak forth Thy praise and to extol Thy virtues, and for having  given me to drink of the cup of Thy mercy that hath surpassed all things  visible and invisible.    Thou art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, the All-  Loving.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! Every time...\"      Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! Every time I attempt to make mention of  Thee, I am hindered by the sublimity of Thy station and the overpowering  greatness of Thy might. For were I to praise Thee throughout the length of  Thy dominion and the duration of Thy sovereignty, I would find that my  praise of Thee can befit only such as are like unto me, who are themselves  Thy creatures, and who have been generated through the power of Thy decree  and been fashioned through the potency of Thy will. And at whatever time  my pen ascribeth glory to any one of Thy names, methinks I can hear the  voice of its lamentation in its remoteness from Thee, and can recognize  its cry because of its separation from Thy Self. I testify that everything  other than Thee is but Thy creation and is held in the hollow of Thy hand.  To have accepted any act or praise from Thy creatures is but an evidence  of the wonders of Thy grace and bountiful favors, and a manifestation of  Thy generosity and providence.    I entreat Thee, O my Lord, by Thy Most Great Name whereby Thou didst  separate light from fire, and truth from denial, to send down upon me and  upon such of my loved ones as are in my company the good of this world and  of the next. Supply us, then, with Thy wondrous gifts that are hid from  the eyes of men. Thou art, verily, the Fashioner of all creation. No God  is there but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Most High.    --Baha'u'llah        \"All majesty and glory, O my God, and all dominion...\"      All majesty and glory, O my God, and all dominion and light and grandeur  and splendor be unto Thee. Thou bestowest sovereignty on whom Thou willest  and dost withhold it from whom Thou desirest. No God is there but Thee,  the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted. Thou art He Who createth from naught  the universe and all that dwell therein. There is nothing worthy of Thee  except Thyself, while all else but Thee are as outcasts in Thy holy  presence and are as nothing when compared to the glory of Thine Own Being.    Far be it from me to extol Thy virtues save by what Thou hast extolled  Thyself in Thy weighty Book where Thou sayest, \"No vision taketh in Him,  but He taketh in all vision. He is the Subtile, the All-Perceiving.\"(6)  Glory be unto Thee, O my God, indeed no mind or vision, however keen or  discriminating, can ever grasp the nature of the most insignificant of Thy  signs. Verily, Thou art God, no God is there besides Thee. I bear witness  that Thou Thyself alone art the sole expression of Thine attributes, that  the praise of no one besides Thee can ever attain to Thy holy court nor  can Thine attributes ever be fathomed by anyone other than Thyself.    Glory be unto Thee, Thou art exalted above the description of anyone save  Thyself, since it is beyond human conception to befittingly magnify Thy  virtues or to comprehend the inmost reality of Thine Essence. Far be it  from Thy glory that Thy creatures should describe Thee or that anyone  besides Thyself should ever know Thee. I have known Thee, O my God, by  reason of Thy making Thyself known unto me, for hadst Thou not revealed  Thyself unto me, I would not have known Thee. I worship Thee by virtue of  Thy summoning me unto Thee, for had it not been for Thy summons I would  not have worshiped Thee.    --The Bab          PROTECTION        \"Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! Thou seest...\"      Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! Thou seest and knowest that I have  called upon Thy servants to turn nowhere except in the direction of Thy  bestowals, and have bidden them observe naught save the things Thou didst  prescribe in Thy Perspicuous Book, the Book which hath been sent down  according to Thine inscrutable decree and irrevocable purpose.    I can utter no word, O my God, unless I be permitted by Thee, and can move  in no direction until I obtain Thy sanction. It is Thou, O my God, Who  hast called me into being through the power of Thy might, and hast endued  me with Thy grace to manifest Thy Cause. Wherefore I have been subjected  to such adversities that my tongue hath been hindered from extolling Thee  and from magnifying Thy glory.    All praise be to Thee, O my God, for the things Thou didst ordain for me  through Thy decree and by the power of Thy sovereignty. I beseech Thee  that Thou wilt fortify both myself and them that love me in our love for  Thee, and wilt keep us firm in Thy Cause. I swear by Thy might! O my God!  Thy servant's shame is to be shut out as by a veil from Thee, and his  glory is to know Thee. Armed with the power of Thy name nothing can ever  hurt me, and with Thy love in my heart all the world's afflictions can in  no wise alarm me.    Send down, therefore, O my Lord, upon me and upon my loved ones that which  will protect us from the mischief of those that have repudiated Thy truth  and disbelieved in Thy signs.    Thou art, verily, the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! This is Thy...\"      Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! This is Thy servant who hath quaffed from  the hands of Thy grace the wine of Thy tender mercy, and tasted of the  savor of Thy love in Thy days. I beseech Thee, by the embodiments of Thy  names whom no grief can hinder from rejoicing in Thy love or from gazing  on Thy face, and whom all the hosts of the heedless are powerless to cause  to turn aside from the path of Thy pleasure, to supply him with the good  things Thou dost possess, and to raise him up to such heights that he will  regard the world even as a shadow that vanisheth swifter than the  twinkling of an eye.    Keep him safe also, O my God, by the power of Thine immeasurable majesty,  from all that Thou abhorrest. Thou art, verily, his Lord and the Lord of  all worlds.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! I entreat...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! I entreat Thee by Thy Name through  which the Hour hath struck, and the Resurrection came to pass, and fear  and trembling seized all that are in heaven and all that are on earth, to  rain down, out of the heaven of Thy mercy and the clouds of Thy tender  compassion, what will gladden the hearts of Thy servants, who have turned  towards Thee and helped Thy Cause.    Keep safe Thy servants and Thy handmaidens, O my Lord, from the darts of  idle fancy and vain imaginings, and give them from the hands of Thy grace  a draught of the soft-flowing waters of Thy knowledge.    Thou, truly, art the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Ever-Forgiving, the  Most Generous.    --Baha'u'llah        \"O God, my God! I have set out from my...\"      O God, my God! I have set out from my home, holding fast unto the cord of  Thy love, and I have committed myself wholly to Thy care and Thy  protection. I entreat Thee by Thy power through which Thou didst protect  Thy loved ones from the wayward and the perverse, and from every  contumacious oppressor, and every wicked doer who hath strayed far from  Thee, to keep me safe by Thy bounty and Thy grace. Enable me, then, to  return to my home by Thy power and Thy might. Thou art, truly, the  Almighty, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Ordain for me, O my Lord, and for those who...\"      Ordain for me, O my Lord, and for those who believe in Thee that which is  deemed best for us in Thine estimation, as set forth in the Mother Book,  for within the grasp of Thy hand Thou holdest the determined measures of  all things.    Thy goodly gifts are unceasingly showered upon such as cherish Thy love,  and the wondrous tokens of Thy heavenly bounties are amply bestowed on  those who recognize Thy divine Unity. We commit unto Thy care whatsoever  Thou hast destined for us, and implore Thee to grant us all the good that  Thy knowledge embraceth.    Protect me, O my Lord, from every evil that Thine omniscience perceiveth,  inasmuch as there is no power nor strength but in Thee, no triumph is  forthcoming save from Thy presence, and it is Thine alone to command.  Whatever God hath willed hath been, and that which He hath not willed  shall not be.    There is no power nor strength except in God, the Most Exalted, the Most  Mighty.    --The Bab        \"Glory be to Thee, O God! Thou art the God...\"      Glory be to Thee, O God! Thou art the God Who hath existed before all  things, Who will exist after all things and will last beyond all things.  Thou art the God Who knoweth all things, and is supreme over all things.  Thou art the God Who dealeth mercifully with all things, Who judgeth  between all things and Whose vision embraceth all things. Thou art God my  Lord, Thou art aware of my position, Thou dost witness my inner and outer  being.    Grant Thy forgiveness unto me and unto the believers who responded to Thy  Call. Be Thou my sufficing helper against the mischief of whosoever may  desire to inflict sorrow upon me or wish me ill. Verily, Thou art the Lord  of all created things. Thou dost suffice everyone, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19243"],[0,"The Advent of Divine Justice (#14)"],[1,"that its members will find themselves overpowered by the  evidences of their regenerative power.    The Inter-America Committee must, at such a stage, nay even before it is  entered, rise to the level of its opportunities, and display a vigor, a  consecration, and enterprise as will be commensurate with the  responsibilities it has shouldered. It should not, for a moment, be  forgotten that Central and Southern America embrace no less than twenty  independent nations, constituting approximately one-third of the entire  number of the world's sovereign states, and are destined to play an  increasingly important part in the shaping of the world's future destiny.  With the world contracting into a neighborhood, and the fortunes of its  races, nations and peoples becoming inextricably interwoven, the  remoteness of these states of the Western Hemisphere is vanishing, and the  latent possibilities in each of them are becoming increasingly apparent.    When this second stage in the progressive unfoldment of teaching  activities and enterprises, under the Seven Year Plan, is reached, and the  machinery required for its prosecution begins to operate, the American  believers, the stout-hearted pioneers of this mighty movement, must,  guided by the unfailing light of Baha'u'llah, and in strict accordance  with the Plan laid out by 'Abdu'l-Baha, and acting under the direction of  their National Spiritual Assembly, and assured of the aid of the  Inter-America Committee, launch an offensive against the powers of  darkness, of corruption, and of ignorance, an offensive that must extend  to the uttermost end of the Southern continent, and embrace within its  scope each of the twenty nations that compose it.    Let some, at this very moment, gird up the loins of their endeavor, flee  their native towns, cities, and states, forsake their country, and,  \"putting their whole trust in God as the best provision for their  journey,\" set their faces, and direct their steps towards those distant  climes, those virgin fields, those unsurrendered cities, and bend their  energies to capture the citadels of men's hearts--hearts, which, as  Baha'u'llah has written, \"the hosts of Revelation and of utterance can  subdue.\" Let them not tarry until such time as their fellow-laborers will  have passed the first stage in their campaign of teaching, but let them  rather, from this very hour, arise to usher in the opening phase of what  will come to be regarded as one of the most glorious chapters in the  international history of their Faith. Let them, at the very outset, \"teach  their own selves, that their speech may attract the hearts of their  hearers.\" Let them regard the triumph of their Faith as their \"supreme  objective.\" Let them not \"consider the largeness or smallness of the  receptacle\" that carries the measure of grace that God poureth forth in  this age. Let them \"disencumber themselves of all attachment to this world  and the vanities thereof,\" and, with that spirit of detachment which  'Abdu'l-Baha exemplified and wished them to emulate, bring these  diversified peoples and countries to the remembrance of God and His  supreme Manifestation. Let His love be a \"storehouse of treasure for their  souls,\" on the day when \"every pillar shall tremble, when the very skins  of men shall creep, when all eyes shall stare up with terror.\" Let their  \"souls be aglow with the flame of the undying Fire that burneth in the  midmost heart of the world, in such wise that the waters of the universe  shall be powerless to cool down its ardor.\" Let them be \"unrestrained as  the wind\" which \"neither the sight of desolation nor the evidences of  prosperity can either pain or please.\" Let them \"unloose their tongues and  proclaim unceasingly His Cause.\" Let them \"proclaim that which the Most  Great Spirit will inspire them to utter in the service of the Cause of  their Lord.\" Let them \"beware lest they contend with anyone, nay strive to  make him aware of the truth with kindly manner and most convincing  exhortation.\" Let them \"wholly for the sake of God proclaim His Message,  and with that same spirit accept whatever response their words may evoke  in their hearers.\" Let them not, for one moment, forget that the \"Faithful  Spirit shall strengthen them through its power,\" and that \"a company of  His chosen angels shall go forth with them, as bidden by Him Who is the  Almighty, the All-Wise.\" Let them ever bear in mind \"how great is the  blessedness that awaiteth them that have attained the honor of serving the  Almighty,\" and remember that \"such a service is indeed the prince of all  goodly deeds, and the ornament of every goodly act.\"    And, finally, let these soul-stirring words of Baha'u'llah, as they pursue  their course throughout the length and breadth of the southern American  continent, be ever ready on their lips, a solace to their hearts, a light  on their path, a companion in their loneliness, and a daily sustenance in  their journeys: \"O wayfarer in the path of God! Take thou thy portion of  the ocean of His grace, and deprive not thyself of the things that lie  hidden in its depths.... A dewdrop out of this ocean would, if shed upon  all that are in the heavens and on earth, suffice to enrich them with the  bounty of God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. With the hands  of renunciation draw forth from its life-giving waters, and sprinkle  therewith all created things, that they may be cleansed from all man-made  limitations, and may approach the mighty seat of God, this hallowed and  resplendent Spot. Be not grieved if thou performest it thyself alone. Let  God be all-sufficient for thee.... Proclaim the Cause of thy Lord unto all  who are in the heavens and on the earth. Should any man respond to thy  call, lay bare before him the pearls of the wisdom of the Lord, thy God,  which His Spirit hath sent down upon thee, and be thou of them that truly  believe. And should anyone reject thy offer, turn thou away from him, and  put thy trust and confidence in the Lord of all worlds. By the  righteousness of God! Whoso openeth his lips in this day, and maketh  mention of the name of his Lord, the hosts of Divine inspiration shall  descend upon him from the heaven of my name, the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise. On him shall also descend the Concourse on high, each bearing  aloft a chalice of pure light. Thus hath it been foreordained in the realm  of God's Revelation, by the behest of Him Who is the All-Glorious, the  Most Powerful.\"    Let these words of 'Abdu'l-Baha, gleaned from the Tablets of the Divine  Plan, ring likewise in their ears, as they go forth, assured and unafraid,  on His mission: \"O ye apostles of Baha'u'llah! May my life be sacrificed  for you!... Behold the portals which Baha'u'llah hath opened before you!  Consider how exalted and lofty is the station you are destined to attain;  how unique the favors with which you have been endowed.\" \"My thoughts are  turned towards you, and my heart leaps within me at your mention. Could ye  know how my soul gloweth with your love, so great a happiness would flood  your hearts as to cause you to become enamored with each other.\" \"The full  measure of your success is as yet unrevealed, its significance still  unapprehended. Erelong ye will, with your own eyes, witness how  brilliantly every one of you, even as a shining star, will radiate in the  firmament of your country the light of Divine Guidance, and will bestow  upon its people the glory of an everlasting life.\" \"I fervently hope that  in the near future the whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the  results of your achievements.\" \"The Almighty will no doubt grant you the  help of His grace, will invest you with the tokens of His might, and will  endue your souls with the sustaining power of His holy Spirit.\" \"Be not  concerned with the smallness of your numbers, neither be oppressed by the  multitude of an unbelieving world.... Exert yourselves; your mission is  unspeakably glorious. Should success crown your enterprise, America will  assuredly evolve into a center from which waves of spiritual power will  emanate, and the throne of the Kingdom of God will, in the plenitude of  its majesty and glory, be firmly established.\"    It should be remembered that the carrying out of the Seven Year Plan  involves, insofar as the teaching work is concerned, no more than the  formation of at least one center in each of the Central and South American  Republics. The hundredth anniversary of the birth of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah should witness, if the Plan already launched is to meet with  success, the laying, in each of these countries, of a foundation, however  rudimentary, on which the rising generation of the American believers may,  in the opening years of the second century of the Baha'i era, be able to  build. Theirs will be the task, in the course of successive decades, to  extend and reinforce those foundations, and to supply the necessary  guidance, assistance, and encouragement that will enable the widely  scattered groups of believers in those countries to establish independent  and properly constituted local Assemblies, and thereby erect the framework  of the Administrative Order of their Faith. The erection of such a  framework is primarily the responsibility of those whom the community of  the North American believers have converted to the Divine Message. It is a  task which must involve, apart from the immediate obligation of enabling  every group to evolve into a local Assembly, the setting up of the entire  machinery of the Administrative Order in conformity with the spiritual and  administrative principles governing the life and activities of every  established Baha'i community throughout the world. No departure from these  cardinal and clearly enunciated principles, embodied and preserved in  Baha'i national and local constitutions, common to all Baha'i communities,  can under any circumstances be tolerated.
