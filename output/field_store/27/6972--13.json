[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Wimborne Minster and Christchurch Priory (#14)"],[1," churches, the chief entrance into the building. Its great  dimensions, both in length and height, however, are remarkable; it  projects 40 feet beyond the aisle wall, and its own side walls rise  nearly to the height of the clerestory of the church. Its south end  does not extend beyond the wall of the aisle, so that there is a space  between the upper part of the porch and the clerestory. The upper part  above the porch proper contains, as mentioned above, a lofty chamber,  probably originally the muniment-room. This is lighted by two pairs  of narrow single-light windows on either side, and by a similar pair  in the north face beneath the obtuse-angled gable. This room is, no  doubt, a later addition. The entrance into the porch is a beautiful,  deeply-recessed archway of thirteenth-century date, with numerous shafts  of Purbeck marble on either side. Within the porch the side walls are  divided into two compartments, each of which is composed of two pointed  arches beneath another larger pointed arch, with a cinquefoil in the  head. On the west side, near the outer archway, is a cinquefoiled  recess, with shafts of Purbeck marble and foliated cusps. This is  said originally to have contained a desk, at which the prior met the  parishioners and signed deeds. A stone seat runs along each side of  the porch walls. The double doorway which leads into the church is very  beautiful and rich Early English work. From six Purbeck marble shafts on  either side spring the orders of the enclosing archway; the heads of the  double doorways themselves are cinquefoiled arches with foliated cusps.  At the jambs, and dividing the two doors, are clusters of Purbeck marble  shafts, with moulded capitals. In the tympanum is a quatrefoil, the  upper part of which projects so as to form a canopy. This was, no doubt,  intended to contain some carved subject, possibly the Doom. Very  extensive restoration was carried out in the groining and porch  generally, in 1862.    [Illustration: THE NORTH DOOR.]    The wall of the #North Aisle# between the porch and the transept is  divided into six compartments by Early English buttresses with gabled  heads. This wall was built in Norman times, as may be seen from the  small round-headed windows which light the clerestory, but was in  Early English times faced with fresh ashlar, which conceals the Norman  arcading of intersecting arches which ran along this wall. The triforium  windows on this side are not, though they are on the south side,  regularly arranged; there are none in the two western divisions, while  between the easternmost buttress and the transept there are two. Six  late thirteenth-century windows were cut through this wall--these are  all of similar design; they consist of two lights under a comprising  arch, with a circle in the head. The clerestory windows are of plainer  character. Each window consists of two simple lancets set under a  recessed arch without any hood moulding; the tympana also above the  lancet heads are not pierced or decorated in any way; in fact, the whole  clerestory is remarkably plain. Between the windows are flat buttresses.  The aisles are covered with lean-to roofs of lead, the nave itself with  a tiled roof of medium pitch. The gable at the east end of the nave, and  indications on the east face of the tower, show that the pitch of the  roof was once higher, and that it must have been lowered at some time  after the tower was built in the fifteenth century.    [Illustration: THE NORTH TRANSEPT IN 1810.  (From Britton's \"Architectural Antiquities.\")]    The #North Transept# is most interesting. Its west wall contains  two round-headed windows with billet moulding, the northern one blocked  up; and at the north-west corner is a cluster of cylindrical shafts  running up to about the same height as the walls of the aisle. Why they  terminated here it is hard to say; they may mark the termination of the  original Norman wall. This wall may not have risen above this height,  or the upper part may have been taken down and rebuilt when the large  Perpendicular window was inserted in the north end of the transept. At  the north-east corner of the transept stands a richly-ornamented turret  of Norman date. Round the lower part of this the arcade of intersecting  arches which runs round the whole transept is carried; above this, round  the turret, runs an arcading of semicircular-headed arches springing  from pairs of shafts; above this the wall is decorated with diaper work;  and finally, another arcading, this time of round-headed arches rising  from single shafts, encircles the turret. The turret is capped by a  sloping roof of stone attached to the transept wall. This turret is  worthy of close attention, because it shows how the Norman builders  hated monotony; each stage has its own decoration unlike that of  any other; and, moreover, there are variations in the shafts of the  arcading--some are plain, some decorated in one way, some in another.  The same love of variety may be seen here that lends so great a charm  on a larger scale to Flambard's glorious nave at Durham. No doubt this  north transept had attached to its east wall an apsidal Norman chapel  similar to that which still exists on the eastern side of the south  transept, but this had to make way for an addition of two chapels, which  we may assign, from the character of their architecture, to the latter  end of the thirteenth century. The northern chapel is lighted by a  three-light window with three foliated circles in the head, which is  rather sharp pointed, and the southern one by a two-light window with  one foliated arch. These are beautiful examples of plate tracery. Above  these chapels is a small chamber lighted by a window of similar  character. This is supposed to have been the tracing room, where the  various architectural designs for the building were drawn.    To the east of the transept may be seen the #Choir# and #Presbytery#,  with its four clerestory windows; the #Choir Aisle#, also with four  windows; the #Lady Chapel#, with the octagonal turret-staircase leading  into Saint Michael's Loft above it. It will be noticed that there is no  window in the aisle under the western clerestory window of the choir,  as the space where this would have been found is occupied by the two  chapels to the east of the transept, and also that the aisle extends  beyond the choir and flanks the western part of the Lady Chapel. The  whole of this part of the church is of Perpendicular character. The  windows of the choir aisles are low, the arches are depressed, and the  curvature of each side of the arch is so slight that they appear almost  straight lines. The body of these windows contains four lights; in the  head, each of these is subdivided into two. Between the aisle windows  are buttresses, which, with the exception of the one opposite the east  wall of the choir, which terminates in a gable, have pinnacled cappings;  and from each of these, save the gabled one, a flying buttress is  carried over the roof of the aisle and rests against the choir wall.  The aisle roof is flat, and at the top of the outer wall runs a plain  parapet pierced with quatrefoil openings. The clerestory windows are of  great size and are set close together. The choir roof is flat and is  quite invisible from the exterior. There can be little doubt that a  parapet at one time ran along the tops of the clerestory walls, but  this has disappeared. The Lady Chapel has on either side three large  Perpendicular windows; the arches of these as well as those of the  clerestory have pointed heads. The western half of the central window  of the Lady Chapel is blocked up by the later-built octagonal turret  containing the staircase to Saint Michael's Loft. The staircase  commences in an octagonal turret at the north-east corner of the choir  aisle,--this rises above the aisle roof,--the stairs are then carried  above the east wall of the choir aisle and then into the octagonal  turret, which runs up the wall of the Lady Chapel and the loft above,  and rises to some height above the parapet. There is a similar staircase  on the south side, but the turret does not rise quite so high above the  roof. There are five square-headed two-light windows on either side of  St Michael's Loft, the lights being divided by transoms, the upper parts  foliated. At the east end is a three-light window without any transom,  with an obtuse arch under a dripstone. The loft has a parapet all round  it pierced with quatrefoil openings. Some of this parapet, at any rate,  is modern, as, in a photograph of the north side taken in 1884, the  parapet is only shown to the east of the turret. As restoration work  is constantly going on at the church, the money paid by visitors for  viewing the interior (sixpence a head, which produces over L500 a year)  being devoted to this object, the parapet will doubtless in course of  time be extended along the walls of the choir, and will certainly add to  the beauty of the church; and as nothing will be destroyed to make room  for it, such an addition will not be open to the same objection as much  of the work done by restoration committees.    [Illustration: THE NORTH TRANSEPT.]    The buttresses at the east angles of the Lady Chapel are set diagonally,  and rise in five stages; the upper stage of each is square, in section,  with the faces parallel to the walls of the church, and reaches a higher  level than the parapet, and is finished with a flat cap. The large east  window is a Perpendicular one of five lights. From the base of the  south-east buttress runs a wall dividing the burying-ground from the  gardens of the house, to the south of the church, which stands on the  site of the domestic buildings of the priory. The portion of the wall of  the Lady Chapel beneath the eastern-most window on the north side is  modern. Here Mr Ferrey, the architect, by whom much of the restoration  was carried out,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19529"],[0,"Nala and Damayanti and Other Poems (#14)"],[1,"thus:      \"Oh! so like mine own twin children--was yon lovely infant pair,      Seeing them thus unexpected--have I broken out in tears:      If so oft thou comest hither--men some evil will suspect,      We within this land are strangers--beauteous maiden, part in peace.\"          BOOK XXIV.          Seeing the profound emotion--of that wisest king of men,      Passing back in haste, Kesinia--told to Damayanti all:      Then again did Damayanti--mission to Kesinia give,      To approach her royal mother--in her haste her lord to see.      \"Vahuca we've watched most closely--Nala we suspect him still;      Only from his form we doubt him--this myself would fain behold.      Cause him enter here, my mother--to my wishes condescend;      Known or unknown to my father--let it be decided now.\"      By that handmaid thus accosted--then the queen to Bhima told      All his daughter's secret counsel--and the raja gave assent.      Instant from her sire the princess--from her mother leave obtained,      Bade them make king Nala enter--in the chamber where she dwelt.      Sudden as he gazed upon her--upon Damayanti gazed,      Nala, he was seized with anguish--and with tears his eyes o'erflowed.      And when Damayanti gazed on--Nala, thus approaching near,      With an agonizing sorrow--was the noble lady seized.      Clad, then, in a scarlet mantle--hair dishevelled, mire-defiled,[133]      Unto Vahuca this language--Damayanti thus addressed:      \"Vahuca beheld'st thou ever--an upright and noble man,      Who departed and abandoned--in the wood, his sleeping wife?      The beloved wife, and blameless--in the wild wood, worn with grief?      Who was he who thus forsook her?--who but Nala, king of men?      To the lord of earth, from folly--what offence can I have given?      That he fled, within the forest--leaving me, by sleep oppressed?      Openly, the gods rejected--was he chosen by me, my lord:      Could he leave the true, the loving--her that hath his children borne!      By the nuptial fire, in presence--of the gods, he clasped my hand,      'I will be,'[134] this truth he plighted--whither did he then depart?\"        While all this in broken accents--sadly Damayanti spoke,      From her eyes the drops of sorrow--flowed in copious torrents down.      Those dark eyes, with vermeil corners--thus with trembling moisture dewed,      When king Nala saw, and gazed on--to the sorrowful he spake.      \"Gaming that I lost my kingdom--'twas not mine own guilty deed,      It was Kali wrought within me--hence it was I fled from thee;      Therefore he, in th' hour of trial--smitten by thy scathing curse,      In the wild wood as thou wanderest--grieving night and day for me,      Kali dwelt within my body--burning with thy powerful curse,      Ever burning, fiercer, hotter--as when fire is heaped on fire.      He, by my religious patience--my devotion, now subdued,      Lo! the end of all our sorrows--beautiful! is now at hand.      I, the evil one departed, hither have made haste to come;      For thy sake, O round-limbed! only;--other business have I none.      Yet, O how may high-born woman--from her vowed, her plighted lord,      Swerving, choose another husband--even as thou, O trembler, would'st?      Over all the earth the heralds--travel by the kings command,      'Now the daughter of king Bhima--will a second husband choose,      'Free from every tie, as wills she--as her fancy may beseem,'      Hearing this, came hither speeding--king Bhangasuri in haste.\"      Damayanti, when from Nala--heard she this his grievous charge,      With her folded hands, and trembling--thus to Nala made reply:      \"Do not me, O noble-minded--of such shameless guilt suspect,      Thou, when I the gods rejected--Nala, wert my chosen lord.      Only thee to find, the Brahmins--went to the ten regions forth,      Chaunting to their holy measures--but the words that I had taught.      Then that Brahmin wise, Parnada--such the name he bears, O king,      Thee in Kosala, the palace--of king Rituparna saw.      There to thee, my words addressed he--answer there from thee received.      I this subtle wile imagined--king of men, to bring thee here.      Since, beside thyself, no mortal--in the world, within the day,      Could drive on the fleetest coursers--for a hundred Yojanas.      To attest this truth, O monarch!--thus I touch thy sacred feet;      Even in heart have I committed--never evil thought 'gainst thee.      He through all the world that wanders--witness the all-seeing wind,[135]      Let him now of life bereave me--if in this 'gainst thee I've sinned:      And the sun that moveth ever--over all the world, on high,      Let him now of life bereave me--if in this 'gainst thee I've sinned.      Witness, too, the moon that permeates--every being's inmost thought;      Let her too of life bereave me--if in this 'gainst thee I've sinned.      These three gods are they that govern--these three worlds, so let them          speak;      This my sacred truth attest they--or this day abandon me.\"        Thus adjured, a solemn witness--spake the wind from out the air;      \"She hath done or thought no evil--Nala, 'tis the truth we speak:      King, the treasure of her virtue--well hath Damayanti kept,      We ourselves have seen and watched her--closely for three livelong years.      This her subtle wile she plotted--only for thy absent sake,      For beside thyself no mortal--might a hundred Yojanas drive.      Thou hast met with Bhima's daughter--Bhima's daughter meets with thee,      Cast away all jealous scruple--to thy bosom take thy wife.\"        Even as thus the wind was speaking--flowers fell showering all            around:[136]      And the gods sweet music sounded--on the zephyr floating light.      As on this surpassing wonder--royal Nala stood and gazed,      Of the blameless Damayanti--melted all his jealous doubts.      Then by dust all undefiled--he the heavenly vest put on,      Thought upon the King of Serpents--and his proper form resumed.      In his own proud form her husband--Bhima's royal daughter saw,      Loud she shrieked, the undespised--and embraced the king of men.      Bhima's daughter, too, king Nala--shining glorious as of old,      Clasped unto his heart, and fondled--gently that sweet infant pair.      Then her face upon his bosom--as the lovely princess laid,      In her calm and gentle sorrow--softly sighed the long-eyed queen:      He, that form still mire-defiled--as he clasped with smile serene,      Long the king of men stood silent--in the ecstacy of woe.      All the tale of Damayanti--and of Nala all the tale,      To king Bhima in her transport--told Vidarbha's mother-queen.      Then replied that mighty monarch--\"Nala, his ablutions done,      Thus rejoined to Damayanti--I to-morrow will behold.\"        VRIHADASVA _spake_.        They the livelong night together--slow related, each to each,      All their wanderings in the forest--and each wild adventure strange.      In king Bhima's royal palace--studying each the other's bliss,      With glad hearts, Vidarbha's princess--and the kingly Nala dwelt.      In their fourth year of divorcement--reunited to his wife,      Richly fraught with every blessing--at the height of joy he stood.      Damayanti too re-wedded--still increasing in her bliss,      Like as the glad earth to water--opens its half-budding fruits,      She of weariness unconscious,--soothed each grief, and full each joy,      Every wish fulfilled, shone brightly--as the night, when high the moon.          BOOK XXV.          When that night was passed and over--Nala, that high-gifted king,      Wedded to Vidarbha's daughter--in fit hour her sire beheld.      Humbly Nala paid his homage--to the father of his queen,      Reverently did Damayanti--pay her homage to her sire.      Him received the royal Bhima--as his son, with highest joy,      Honoured, as became him, nobly:--then consoled that monarch wise      Damayanti, to king Nala--reconciled, the faithful wife.      Royal Nala, all these honours--as his homage meet, received;      And in fitting terms, devotion--to his royal sire declared.      Mighty then, through all the city--ran the wakening sound of joy;      All in every street exulting--at king Nala's safe return.      All the city with their banners--and with garlands decked they forth.      All the royal streets, well watered--and with stainless flowers were strewn;      And from door to door the garlands--of festooning flowers were hung;      And of all the gods the altars--were with fitting rites adorned.      Rituparna heard of Nala--in the form of Vahuca,      Now re-wed, to Damayanti--and the king of men rejoiced.      To the king, before his presence--Nala courteous made excuse.      In his turn Ayodhya's monarch--in like courteous language spake.      He, received thus hospitably--wondering to Nishadha's king,      \"Bliss be with thee, reunited--to thy queen:\" 'twas thus he said.      \"Have I aught offensive ever--done to thee, or said, O king      Whilst unknown, within my palace--thou wert dwelling, king of men?      If designed or undesigning--any single act I've done      I might wish undone, thy pardon--grant me, I beseech thee, king.\"        NALA _spake_.        \"Not or deed or word discourteous--not the slightest hast thou done;      Hadst thou, I might not resent it--freely would I pardon all.      Thou of old, my friend, my kinsman--wert, O sovereign of men,      From this time henceforth thy friendship--be my glory and my joy.      Every wish anticipated--pleasantly I dwelt with thee,      As in mine own royal palace--dwelt I ever, king, in thine.      My surpassing skill in horses--all is thine that I possess;      That on thee bestow I gladly--if, O king, it seem thee good.\"        Nala thus to Rituparna--gave his subtle skill in steeds,      Gladly he received the present--with each regulation meet.      Gifted with that precious knowledge--t"]]]
