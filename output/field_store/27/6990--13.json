He was the most celebrated of the famous \"Four Doctors\"  of the law school of that university, and was regarded as the Chrysostom of  the Gloss-writers, being frequently designated by the title of the \"Golden  Mouth\" (_os aureum_). He died in 1166 A.D., at a very advanced age. Popular  tradition represents all the Four Doctors (Bulgarus, Martinus Gosia, Hugo  de Porta Ravennate and Jacobus de Boragine) as pupils of Irnerius (_q.v._),  but while there is no insuperable difficulty in point of time in accepting  this tradition as far as regards Bulgarus, Savigny considers the general  tradition inadmissible as regards the others. Martinus Gosia and Bulgarus  were the chiefs of two opposite schools at Bologna, corresponding in many  respects to the Proculians and Sabinians of Imperial Rome, Martinus being  at the head of a school which accommodated the law to what his opponents  styled the equity of \"the purse\" (_aequitas bursalis_), whilst Bulgarus  adhered more closely to the letter of the law. The school of Bulgarus  ultimately prevailed, and it numbered amongst its adherents Joannes  Bassianus, Azo and Accursius, each of whom in his turn exercised a  commanding influence over the course of legal studies at Bologna. Bulgarus  took the leading part amongst the Four Doctors at the diet of Roncaglia in  1158, and was one of the most trusted advisers of the emperor Frederick I.  His most celebrated work is his commentary _De Regulis Juris_, which was at  one time printed amongst the writings of Placentius, but has been properly  reassigned to its true author by Cujacius, upon the internal evidence  contained in the additions annexed to it, which are undoubtedly from the  pen of Placentinus. This [v.04 p.0787] _Commentary_, which is the earliest  extant work of its kind emanating from the school of the Gloss-writers, is,  according to Savigny, a model specimen of the excellence of the method  introduced by Irnerius, and a striking example of the brilliant results  which had been obtained in a short space of time by a constant and  exclusive study of the sources of law.    BULL, GEORGE (1634-1710), English divine, was born at Wells on the 25th of  March 1634, and educated at Tiverton school, Devonshire. He entered Exeter  College, Oxford, in 1647, but had to leave in 1649 in consequence of his  refusal to take the oath of allegiance to the Commonwealth. He was ordained  privately by Bishop Skinner in 1655. His first benefice held was that of St  George's near Bristol, from which he rose successively to be rector of  Suddington in Gloucestershire (1658), prebendary of Gloucester (1678),  archdeacon of Llandaff (1686), and in 1705 bishop of St David's. He died on  the 17th of February 1710. During the time of the Commonwealth he adhered  to the forms of the Church of England, and under James II. preached  strenuously against Roman Catholicism. His works display great erudition  and powerful thinking. The _Harmonia Apostolica_ (1670) is an attempt to  show the fundamental agreement between the doctrines of Paul and James with  regard to justification. The _Defensio Fidei Nicenae_ (1685), his greatest  work, tries to show that the doctrine of the Trinity was held by the  ante-Nicene fathers of the church, and retains its value as a  thorough-going examination of all the pertinent passages in early church  literature. The _Judicium Ecclesiae Catholicae_ (1694) and _Primitiva et  Apostolica Traditio_ (1710) won high praise from Bossuet and other French  divines. Following on Bossuet's criticisms of the _Judicium_, Bull wrote a  treatise on _The Corruptions of the Church of Rome_, which became very  popular.    The best edition of Bull's works is that in 7 vols., published at Oxford by  the Clarendon Press, under the superintendence of E. Burton, in 1827. This  edition contains the _Life_ by Robert Nelson. The _Harmonia, Defensio_ and  _Judicium_ are translated in the Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology  (Oxford, 1842-1855).    BULL, JOHN (c. 1562-1628), English composer and organist, was born in  Somersetshire about 1562. After being organist in Hereford cathedral, he  joined the Chapel Royal in 1585, and in the next year became a Mus. Bac. of  Oxford. In 1591 he was appointed organist in Queen Elizabeth's chapel in  succession to Blitheman, from whom he had received his musical education.  In 1592 he received the degree of doctor of music at Cambridge University;  and in 1596 he was made music professor at Gresham College, London. As he  was unable to lecture in Latin according to the foundation-rules of that  college, the executors of Sir Thomas Gresham made a dispensation in his  favour by permitting him to lecture in English. He gave his first lecture  on the 6th of October 1597. In 1601 Bull went abroad. He visited France and  Germany, and was everywhere received with the respect due to his talents.  Anthony Wood tells an impossible story of how at St Omer Dr Bull performed  the feat of adding, within a few hours, forty parts to a composition  already written in forty parts. Honourable employments were offered to him  by various continental princes; but he declined them, and returned to  England, where he was given the freedom of the Merchant Taylors' Company in  1606. He played upon a small pair of organs before King James I. on the  16th of July 1607, in the hall of the Company, and he seems to have been  appointed one of the king's organists in that year. In the same year he  resigned his Gresham professorship and married Elizabeth Walter. In 1613 he  again went to the continent on account of his health, obtaining a post as  one of the organists in the arch-duke's chapel at Brussels. In 1617 he was  appointed organist to the cathedral of Notre Dame at Antwerp, and he died  in that city on the 12th or 13th of March 1628. Little of his music has  been published, and the opinions of critics differ much as to its merits  (see Dr Willibald Nagel's _Geschichte der Musik in England_, ii. (1897), p.  155, &c.; and Dr Seiffert's _Geschichte der Klaviermusik_ (1899), p. 54,  &c.). Contemporary writers speak in the highest terms of Bull's skill as a  performer on the organ and the virginals, and there is no doubt that he  contributed much to the development of harpsichord music. Jan Swielinck  (1562-1621), the great organist of Amsterdam, did not regard his work on  composition as complete without placing in it a canon by John Bull, and the  latter wrote a fantasia upon a fugue of Swielinck. For the ascription to  Bull of the composition of the British national anthem, see NATIONAL  ANTHEMS. Good modern reprints, _e.g._ of the Fitzwilliam _Virginal-Book_,  \"The King's Hunting Jig,\" and one or two other pieces, are in the  repertories of modern pianists from Rubinstein onwards.    BULL, OLE BORNEMANN (1810-1880), Norwegian violinist, was born in Bergen,  Norway, on the 5th of February 1810. At first a pupil of the violinist  Paulsen, and subsequently self-taught, he was intended for the church, but  failed in his examinations in 1828 and became a musician, directing the  philharmonic and dramatic societies at Bergen. In 1829 he went to Cassel,  on a visit to Spohr, who gave him no encouragement. He now began to study  law, but on going to Paris he came under the influence of Paganini, and  definitely adopted the career of a violin virtuoso. He made his first  appearance in company with Ernst and Chopin at a concert of his own in  Paris in 1832. Successful tours in Italy and England followed soon  afterwards, and he was not long in obtaining European celebrity by his  brilliant playing of his own pieces and arrangements. His first visit to  the United States lasted from 1843 to 1845, and on his return to Norway he  formed a scheme for the establishment of a Norse theatre in Bergen; this  became an accomplished fact in 1850; but in consequence of harassing  business complications he went again to America. During this visit  (1852-1857) he bought 125,000 acres in Potter county, Pennsylvania, for a  Norwegian colony, which was to have been called Oleana after his name; but  his title turned out to be fraudulent, and the troubles he went through in  connexion with the undertaking were enough to affect his health very  seriously, though not to hinder him for long from the exercise of his  profession. Another attempt to found an academy of music in Christiania had  no permanent result. In 1836 he had married Alexandrine Felicie Villeminot,  the grand-daughter of a lady to whom he owed much at the beginning of his  musical career in Paris; she died in 1862. In 1870 he married Sara C.  Thorpe of Wisconsin; henceforth he confined himself to the career of a  violinist. He died at Lysoe, near Bergen, on the 17th of August 1880. Ole  Bull's \"polacca guerriera\" and many of his other violin pieces, among them  two concertos, are interesting to the virtuoso, and his fame rests upon his  prodigious technique. The memoir published by his widow in 1886 contains  many illustrations of a career that was exceptionally brilliant; it gives a  picture of a strong individuality, which often found expression in a  somewhat boisterous form of practical humour.    There is a fountain and portrait statue to his memory in the Ole Bulls  Plads in Bergen.    BULL, (1) The male of animals belonging to the section _Bovina_ of the  family _Bovidae_ (_q.v._), particularly the uncastrated male of the  domestic ox (_Bos taurus_). (See CATTLE.) The word, which is found in M.E.  as _bole, bolle_ (cf. Ger. _Bulle_, and Dutch _bul_ or _bol_), is also used  of the males of other animals of large size, _e.g._ the elephant, whale,  &c. The O.E. diminutive form _bulluc_, meaning originally a young bull, or  bull calf, survives in bullock, now confined to a young castrated male ox  kept for slaughter for beef.

VI    ANIMAL MATHEMATICIANS        _\"But what a thoughtless animal is man,--    How very active in his own trepan!\"_      --PRIOR.    Among the special senses of animals none seems more human than their  knowledge of mathematics. A recognition of this quality in animals is  encouraging because the new scientists are earnestly trying to build up  a true knowledge of animal behaviour by studying them in the light of  the new psychology. This will fill the place of the vast amount of  misinformation which those skilled only in book-knowledge, without  really knowing the ways of Nature, have builded. It will also record all  the strange and curious facts about animals and their ways without  insisting too much on rigid explanation. These new scientists are far  different from their predecessors who tried to explain everything they  did not understand about an animal's behaviour in terms of the scanty  information gained by studying a few museum specimens. We might as well  attempt to explain human nature from the study of an Egyptian mummy. The  new method is simply to give the facts about an animal, and frankly  admit that in many cases, such as are found in their knowledge of  counting and numbers, we must leave complete explanation to the future  when we shall have a greater fund of scientific data on which to base  our conclusions.    It is an established fact that some animals can count, and that they  have the faculty of close observation and keen discrimination. They  learn to count quickly, but they do not fully appreciate the value of  numerical rotation. Most of the arithmetical feats of trained animals  are hoaxes regulated by their sense of smell, sight, touch and taste.  But no one doubts their ability to count. I have known a monkey that  could count to five. He played with a number of marbles, and I would ask  for two marbles, one marble, four marbles, as the case might be, and he  would quickly hand the number requested.    Another incident that will illustrate the point is the case of a mule  owned by an old negro near Huntsville, Texas. The regular routine work  of this mule was to cart two loads of wood to the town every day. One  day the negro wished to make a third trip, but was unable to do so. When  asked the reason, he replied, \"Dat fool mule, Napoleon, done decided we  had hauled enough wood fo' one day!\"    Prantl claims that the time-sense is totally absent in animals, and that  it belongs only to man, as one of the attributes of his mental  superiority. However, many facts go to show that animals have not only a  specific time-sense, but also a sense of personal identity which reaches  back into the past.    Time-sense is very highly developed in dogs, cats, hogs, horses, goats,  and sheep. They apparently are able to keep an accurate account of the  days of the week and hours of the day and night, and even seem to know  something of numerical succession and logical sequence. A friend in  Texas had an old coloured servant, whose faithful dog had been trained  to know that just at noon each day he was expected to carry lunch to his  master. I have seen the dog on more than one occasion playing with  children in the streets, suddenly break away without any one calling  him, or any suggestion on our part as to the time, and rush for the  kitchen just at the proper moment. No one could detain him from his  duty. This same dog, however, would on Sundays continue to play at the  noon hour. Surely, if any explanation is to be offered in such a case as  this, it will imply as strict a sense of time as it does of duty.    A friend relates a case of a dog that went each evening to meet a train  on which his master returned from the city. On one occasion the train  was delayed two hours, and it was exceedingly cold, but the devoted  companion remained until his master arrived. Innumerable instances of  such all-absorbing affection, showing at the same time a sense of time,  might be cited.    Dr. Brown gives a most remarkable example of a dog's ability to  distinguish time. The story is of a female dog, though named Wylie,  which was purchased by Dr. Brown when he was a young man, from an old  shepherd who had long been in his employment. Wylie was brought to his  father's, \"and was at once taken,\" he says, \"to all our hearts; and  though she was often pensive, as if thinking of her master and her work  on the hills, she made herself at home, and behaved in all respects like  a lady.... Some months after we got her, there was a mystery about her;  every Tuesday evening she disappeared; we tried to watch her, but in  vain; she was always off by nine P. M., and was away all night, coming  back next day wearied, and all over mud, as if she had travelled far.  This went on for some months, and we could make nothing of it. Well, one  day I was walking across the Grass-market, with Wylie at my heels, when  two shepherds started, and looking at her, one said, 'That's her;  that's the wonderful wise bitch that naebody kens.' I asked him what he  meant, and he told me that for months past she had made her appearance  by the first daylight at the 'buchts' or sheep-pens in the  cattle-market, and worked incessantly, and to excellent purpose, in  helping the shepherds to get their sheep and lambs in. The man said in a  sort of transport, 'She's a perfect meeracle; flees about like a  speerit, and never gangs wrang; wears, but never grups, and beats a' oor  dowgs. She's a perfect meeracle, and as soople as a mawkin'.' She  continued this work until she died.\"    Another most striking instance, showing animals' sense of time, is that  related by Watson in which he tells of two friends, fathers of families,  one living in London and the other at Guilford. For many years it was  the custom of the London family to visit their friends in Guilford,  always accompanied by their spaniel, Caesar. After some years a  misunderstanding arose between the two families. The usual Christmas  visits were discontinued; not, however, so far as the spaniel was  concerned. His visits continued as before. On the eve of the first  Christmas following the misunderstanding, the Guilford family were  astonished to find at their door their London friend, Caesar. Naturally,  they expected that he had come in advance of the family, and were happy  in the thought of this unexpected reconciliation. All evening they  awaited their friends, but none arrived. Nor did they the next day.  Caesar had come of his own accord at the accustomed time, and remained  with his friends for the usual number of days. This naturally led to a  correspondence between the families, who thereupon resumed their former  friendly relations. We do not believe, of course, that this dog counted  the exact number of days to know when to start to Guilford, but he  doubtless saw something to remind him of the past.    Sir John Lubbock once related before the British Association at Aberdeen  how cards bearing the ten numerals were arranged before a dog, and the  dog given a problem, such as to state the square root of nine, or of  sixteen, or the sum of two numbers. He would then point at each card in  succession, and the dog would bark when he came to the right one. The  dog never made a mistake. If this was not evidence of a mentality at  least approaching that of men, we do not know what to call it.    If there is any difference between an animal and a human mathematician,  it depends upon special training. The animal never has the same  opportunities to learn as the man. Many savages, for example, cannot  count beyond three or four. Sir John Lubbock gives an anecdote of Mr.  Galton, who compared the arithmetical knowledge of certain savages of  South Africa and a dog. The comparison proved to the advantage of the  dog.    There is no reason that a dog should not be taught arithmetic. And if  one wishes to do so, it might be well to begin by making the dog  distinguish one from two, allowing him to touch both once at the word  one, and twice at the word two. Then he might pass on to six or seven.  After he had progressed to ten, he might begin addition. At least the  experiment would be interesting and conducive to learning the truth.  Surely a knowledge of mathematics is no more wonderful than that of the  ordinary pointer dog's ability to distinguish different kinds of birds.  Certain of those wise dogs are trained to hunt only quail, while others  hunt several varieties of game.    It should be remembered that all degrees of arithmetical aptitude are  found in the human races, from the genius of a Newton and a Laplace to  the absolute inability of certain of the Hottentots to count to three.  These inequalities in the mathematical notions of different people  should make us very cautious about saying that animals cannot count and  have no sense of numbers. It is extremely probable that if we had a way  of choosing those animals with a special gift for arithmetic, they  would surprise us with their learning.

They are not so skilled as the average human being  in making these distinctions, yet when mentally compared to the state of  Bushmen, Tasmanians, and Veddahs, who can count only two, and call it  many, there is not such a vast gulf between them and mankind.    The zebu, or sacred bull of India, shows his mathematical qualities to a  pronounced degree.
