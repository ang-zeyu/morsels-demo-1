Lewis, detesting Leicester's usurpations and perjuries, and disgusted  at the English barons, who had refused to submit to his award, secretly  favored all her enterprises, and was generally believed to be making  preparations for the same purpose. An English army, by the pretended  authority of the captive king, was assembled on the sea-coast, to oppose  this projected invasion;[**] but Leicester owed his safety more to cross  winds, which long detained and at last dispersed and ruined the queen's  fleet, than to any resistance which, in their present situation, could  have been expected from the English.         * Rymer, vol. i. p. 793.

Leicester found himself better able to resist the spiritual thunders  which were levelled against him. The pope, still adhering to the king's  cause against the barons, despatched Cardinal Guido as his legate  into England, with orders to excommunicate by name the three earls,  Leicester, Glocester, and Norfolk, and all others in general, who  concurred in the oppression and captivity of their sovereign.[*]  Leicester menaced the legate with death if he set foot within the  kingdom; but Guido, meeting in France the bishops of Winchester, London,  and Worcester, who had been sent thither on a negotiation, commanded  them, under the penalty of ecclesiastical censures, to carry his bull  into England, and to publish it against the barons. When the prelates  arrived off the coast, they were boarded by the piratical mariners of  the cinque ports, to whom probably they gave a hint of the cargo which  they brought along with them: the bull was torn and thrown into the  sea; which furnished the artful prelates with a plausible excuse for not  obeying the orders of the legate. Leicester appealed from Guido to the  pope in person; but before the ambassadors appointed to defend his cause  could reach Rome, the pope was dead; and they found the legate himself,  from whom they had appealed, seated on the papal throne, by the name of  Urban IV. That daring leader was nowise dismayed with this incident; and  as he found that a great part of his popularity in England was founded  on his opposition to the court of Rome, which was now become odious, he  persisted with the more obstinacy in the prosecution of his measures.    {1265.} That he might both increase and turn to advantage his  popularity, Leicester summoned a new parliament in London, where he  knew his power was uncontrollable; and he fixed this assembly on a  more democratical basis than any which had ever been summoned since the  foundation of the monarchy. Besides the barons of his own party, and  several ecclesiastics, who were not immediate tenants of the crown, he  ordered returns to be made of two knights from each shire, and, what is  more remarkable, of deputies from the boroughs, an order of men which,  in former ages, had always been regarded as too mean to enjoy a place in  the national councils.[**] This period is commonly esteemed the epoch of  the house of commons in England; and it is certainly the first time that  historians speak of any representatives sent to parliament by the  boroughs and even in the most particular narratives delivered of  parliamentary transactions, as in the trial of Thomas a Becket, where  the events of each day, and almost of each hour, are carefully recorded  by contemporary authors,[***] there is not, throughout the whole, the  least appearance of a house of commons.         * Rymer, vol. i. p. 798. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 373.         ** Rymer, vol. i. p. 802.         *** Fitz-Stephen, Hist. Quadrip. Hoveden, etc.    In all the general accounts given in preceding times of those  assemblies, the prelates and barons only are mentioned as the  constituent members. But though that house derived its existence from so  precarious and even so invidious an origin as Leicester's usurpation, it  soon proved, when summoned by the legal princes, one of the most  useful, and, in process of time, one of the most powerful members of  the national constitution; and gradually rescued the kingdom from  aristocratical as well as from regal tyranny. But Leicester's policy, if  we must ascribe to him so great a blessing, only forwarded by some  years an institution, for which the general state of things had already  prepared the nation; and it is otherwise inconceivable, that a plant,  set by so inauspicious a hand, could have attained to so vigorous  a growth, and have flourished in the midst of such tempests and  convulsions. The feudal system, with which the liberty, much more the  power of the commons, was totally incompatible, began gradually  to decline; and both the king and the commonalty, who felt its  inconveniencies, contributed to favor this new power, which was more  submissive than the barons to the regular authority of the crown, and at  the same time afforded protection to the inferior orders of the state.    Leicester, having thus assembled a parliament of his own model, and  trusting to the attachment of the populace of London, seized the  opportunity of crushing his rivals among the powerful barons. Robert  de Ferrers, earl of Derby, was accused in the king's name, seized, and  committed to custody, without being brought to any legal trial.[*] John  Gifford, menaced with the same fate, fled from London, and took shelter  in the borders of Wales. Even the earl of Glocester, whose power and  influence had so much contributed to the success of the barons, but  who of late was extremely disgusted with Leicester's arbitrary conduct,  found himself in danger from the prevailing authority of his ancient  confederate; and he retired from parliament.[**] This known dissension  gave courage to all Leicester's enemies and to the king's friends; who  were now sure of protection from so potent a leader.         * Chron. T. Wykes, p. 66. Ann. Waverl. p. 216.         ** M. Paris, p. 671. Ann. Waverl. p. 211.    Though Roger Mortimer, Hamond l'Estrange, and other powerful marchers  of Wales, had been obliged to leave the kingdom, their authority still  remained over the territories subjected to their jurisdiction; and  there were many others who were disposed to give disturbance to the new  government. The animosities inseparable from the feudal aristocracy,  broke out with fresh violence, and threatened the kingdom with new  convulsions and disorders.    The earl of Leicester, surrounded with these difficulties, embraced a  measure, from which he hoped to reap some present advantages, but which  proved in the end the source of all his future calamities. The active  and intrepid Prince Edward had anguished in prison ever since the fatal  battle of Lewes; and as he was extremely popular in the kingdom there  arose a general desire of seeing him again restored to liberty.[*]  Leicester, finding that he could with difficulty oppose the concurring  wishes of the nation, stipulated with the prince, that, in return,  he should order his adherents to deliver up to the barons all their  castles, particularly those on the borders of Wales; and should swear  neither to depart the kingdom during three years, nor introduce into it  any foreign forces.[**] The king took an oath to the same effect, and  he also passed a charter in which he confirmed the agreement or Mise of  Lewes; and even permitted his subjects to rise in arms against him, if  he should ever attempt to infringe it.[***] So little care did Leicester  take, though he constantly made use of the authority of this captive  prince, to preserve to him any appearance of royalty or kingly  prerogatives.         * Knyghton, p. 2451.         ** Ann. Waverl. p. 216.         *** Blackstone's Mag. Chart. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 378.    In consequence of this treaty, Prince Edward was brought into  Westminster Hall, and was declared free by the barons: but instead of  really recovering his liberty, as he had vainly expected, he found that  the whole transaction was a fraud on the part of Leicester; that he  himself still continued a prisoner at large, and was guarded by the  emissaries of that nobleman; and that, while the faction reaped all the  benefit from the performance of his part of the treaty, care was taken  that he should enjoy no advantage by it. As Glocester, on his rupture  with the barons, had retired for safety to his estates on the borders  of Wales, Leicester followed him with an army to Hereford,[*] continued  still to menace ana negotiate, and that he might add authority to his  cause, he carried both the king and prince along with him. The earl of  Glocester here concerted with young Edward the manner of that prince's  escape. He found means to convey to him a horse of extraordinary  swiftness; and appointed Roger Mortimer who had returned into the  kingdom, to be ready at hand with a small party to receive the prince,  and to guard him to a place of safety. Edward pretended to take the  air with some of Leicester's retinue, who were his guards; and making  matches between their horses, after he thought he had tired and blown  them sufficiently, he suddenly mounted Glocester's horse, and called  to his attendants that he had long enough enjoyed the pleasure of  their company, and now bade them adieu. They followed him for some time  without being able to overtake him; and the appearance of Mortimer with  his company put an end to their pursuit.         * Chron. T. Wykes, p. 67. Ann.

(#14)"],[1," frontiers exposed to the inroads of the  English general, who besieged and took Aiton, a small castle lying a few  miles beyond Berwick. These unsuccessful or frivolous attempts on both  sides prognosticated a speedy end to the war; and Henry, notwithstanding  his superior force, was no less desirous than James of terminating  the differences between the nations. Not to depart, however, from his  dignity, by making the first advances, he employed in this friendly  office Peter Hialas, a man of address and learning, who had come to him  as ambassador from Ferdinand and Isabella, and who was charged with a  commission of negotiating the marriage of the Infanta Catharine, their  daughter, with Arthur, prince of Wales.[*]         * Polyd. Virg. p. 603.    Hialas took a journey northwards, and offered his mediation between  James and Henry, as minister of a prince who was in alliance with both  potentates. Commissioners were soon appointed to meet and confer on  terms of accommodation. The first demand of the English was, that Perkin  should be put into their hands: James replied, that he himself was  no judge of the young man's pretensions; but having received him as a  supplicant, and promised him protection, he was determined not to betray  a man who had trusted to his good faith and his generosity. The next  demand of the English met with no better reception: they required  reparation for the ravages committed by the late inroads into England:  the Scottish commissioners replied, that the spoils were like water  spilt upon the ground, which could never be recovered; and that Henry's  subjects were better able to bear the loss, than their master to repair  it. Henry's commissioners next proposed, that the two kings should have  an interview at Newcastle, in order to adjust all differences; but James  said, that he meant to treat of a peace, not to go a begging for it.  Lest the conferences should break off altogether without effect, a truce  was concluded for some months; and James, perceiving that while Perkin  remained in Scotland he himself never should enjoy a solid peace with  Henry, privately desired him to depart the kingdom.    Access was now barred Perkin into the Low Countries, his usual retreat  in all his disappointments. The Flemish merchants, who severely felt the  loss resulting from the interruption of commerce with England, had made  such interest in the archduke's council, that commissioners were sent to  London, in order to treat of an accommodation. The Flemish court agreed,  that all English rebels should be excluded the Low Countries; and in  this prohibition the demesnes of the duchess dowager were expressly  comprehended. When this principal article was agreed to, all the other  terms were easily adjusted. A treaty of commerce was finished, which was  favorable to the Flemings, and to which they long gave the appellation  of \"intercursus magnus,\" the great treaty. And when the English  merchants returned to their usual abode at Antwerp, they were publicly  received, as in procession, with joy and festivity.    Perkin was a Fleming by descent, though born in England; and it might  therefore be doubted whether he were included in the treaty between the  two nations: but as he must dismiss all his English retainers if he took  shelter in the Low Countries, and as he was sure of a cold reception,  if not bad usage, among people who were determined to keep on terms  of friendship with the court of England, he thought fit rather to  hide himself during some time in the wilds and fastnesses of Ireland.  Impatient, however, of a retreat which was both disagreeable and  dangerous, he held consultations with his followers, Herne, Skelton, and  Astley, three broken tradesmen: by their advice he resolved to try the  affections of the Cornish, whose mutinous disposition, notwithstanding  the king's lenity, still subsisted after the suppression of their  rebellion. No sooner did he appear at Bodmin, in Cornwall, than the  populace, to the number of three thousand, flocked to his standard, and  Perkin, elated with this appearance of success, took on him, for the  first time, the appellation of Richard IV., king of England. Not to  suffer the expectations of his followers to languish, he presented  himself before Exeter; and by many fair promises invited that city to  join him. Finding that the inhabitants shut their gates against him,  he laid siege to the place; but being unprovided with artillery,  ammunition, and every thing requisite for the attempt, he made no  progress in his undertaking. Messengers were sent to the king, informing  him of this insurrection: the citizens of Exeter meanwhile were  determined to hold out to the last extremity, in expectation of  receiving succor from the well-known vigilance of that monarch.    When Henry was informed that Perkin was landed in England, he expressed  great joy, and prepared himself with alacrity to attack him, in hopes of  being able, at length, to put a period to pretensions which had so long  given him vexation and inquietude. All the courtiers, sensible that  their activity on this occasion would be the most acceptable service  which they could render the king, displayed their zeal for the  enterprise, and forwarded his preparations. The lords Daubeney and  Broke, with Sir Rice ap Thomas, hastened forward with a small body of  troops to the relief of Exeter. The earl of Devonshire, and the most  considerable gentlemen in the county of that name, took arms of their  own accord, and marched to join the king's generals. The duke of  Buckingham put himself at the head of a troop, consisting of young  nobility and gentry, who served as volunteers, and who longed for an  opportunity of displaying their courage and their loyalty. The king  himself prepared to follow with a considerable army; and thus all  England seemed united against a pretender who had at first engaged their  attention and divided their affections.    Perkin, informed of these great preparations, immediately raised the  siege of Exeter, and retired to Taunton. Though his followers now  amounted to the number of near seven thousand, and seemed still resolute  to maintain his cause, he himself despaired of success, and secretly  withdrew to the sanctuary of Beaulieu, in the new forest. The Cornish  rebels submitted to the king's mercy, and found that it was not yet  exhausted in their behalf. Except a few persons of desperate fortunes,  who were executed, and some others who were severely fined, all the rest  were dismissed with impunity Lady Catharine Gordon, wife to Perkin fell  into the hands of the victor, and was treated with a generosity which  does him honor. He soothed her mind with many marks of regard, placed  her in a reputable station about the queen and assigned her a pension,  which she enjoyed even under his successor.    {1498.} Henry deliberated what course to take with Perkin himself. Some  counselled him to make the privileges of the church yield to reasons of  state, to take him by violence from the sanctuary, to inflict on him  the punishment due to his temerity, and thus at once to put an end to  an imposture which had long disturbed the government, and which the  credulity of the people and the artifices of malcontents were still  capable of reviving. But the king deemed not the matter of such  importance as to merit so violent a remedy, He employed some persons to  deal with Perkin, and persuade him, under promise of pardon, to deliver  himself into the king's hands.[*] The king conducted him in a species of  mock triumph to London. As Perkin passed along the road and through  the streets of the city, men of all ranks flocked about him, and the  populace treated with the highest derision his fallen fortunes. They  seemed desirous of revenging themselves, by their insults, for the shame  which their former belief of his impostures had thrown upon them. Though  the eyes of the nation were generally opened with regard to Perkin's  real parentage, Henry required of him a confession of his life and  adventures; and he ordered the account of the whole to be dispersed soon  after, for the satisfaction of the public. But as his regard to decency  made him entirely suppress the share which the duchess of Burgundy had  had in contriving and conducting the imposture, the people, who knew  that she had been the chief instrument in the whole affair, were  inclined, on account of the silence on that head, to pay the less credit  to the authenticity of the narrative.         * Polyd. Virg. p. 606.    {1499.} But Perkin, though his life was granted him, was still detained  in custody; and keepers were appointed to guard him. Impatient of  confinement, he broke from his keepers, and flying to the sanctuary of  Shyne, put himself into the hands of the prior of that monastery. The  prior had obtained great credit by his character of sanctity; and he  prevailed on the king again to grant a pardon to Perkin. But in order  to reduce him to still greater contempt, he was set in the stocks at  Westminster and Cheapside, and obliged in both places to read aloud to  the people the confession which had formerly been published in his name.  He was then confined to the Tower, where his habits of restless intrigue  and enterprise followed him. He insinuated himself into the intimacy of  four servants of Sir John Digby, lieutenant of the Tower; and by their  means opened a correspondence with the earl of Warwick, who was confined  in the same prison. This unfortunate prince, who had from his earliest  youth been shut up from the commerce of men, and who was ignorant even  of the most common Affairs of life, had fallen into a simplicity which  made him susceptible of any impression. The continued dread also of the  more violent effects of Henry's tyranny, joined to the natural love of  liberty, engaged him to embrace a project for his escape, by the murder  of the lieutenant; and Perkin"]]]
