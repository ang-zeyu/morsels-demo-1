This is the true sacrifice: the offering of  oneself, even as did Christ, as a ransom for the life of the world.    As to the influence of holy Beings and the continuance of Their grace to  mankind after They have put away Their human form, this is, to Baha'is, an  indisputable fact. Indeed, the flooding grace, the streaming splendours of  the holy Manifestations appear after Their ascension from this world. The  exaltation of the Word, the revelation of the power of God, the conversion  of God-fearing souls, the bestowal of everlasting life--it was following  the Messiah's martyrdom that all these were increased and intensified. In  the same way, ever since the ascension of the Blessed Beauty, the  bestowals have been more abundant, the spreading light is brighter, the  tokens of the Lord's might are more powerful, the influence of the Word is  much stronger, and it will not be long before the motion, the heat, the  brilliance, the blessings of the Sun of His reality will encompass all the  earth.    Grieve thou not over the slow advance of the Baha'i Cause in that land.  This is but the early dawn. Consider how, with the Cause of Christ, three  hundred years had to go by, before its great influence was made manifest.  Today, not sixty years from its birth, the light of this Faith hath been  shed around the planet.    Regarding the health society of which thou art a member, once it cometh  under the shelter of this Faith its influence shall increase a  hundredfold.    Thou dost observe that love among the Baha'is is very great, and that love  is the main thing. Just as love's power hath been developed to such a high  degree among the Baha'is, and is far greater than among the people of  other religions, so is it with all else as well; for love is the ground of  all things.    Regarding the translation of the Books and Tablets of the Blessed Beauty,  erelong will translations be made into every tongue, with power, clarity  and grace. At such time as they are translated, conformably to the  originals, and with power and grace of style, the splendours of their  inner meanings will be shed abroad, and will illumine the eyes of all  mankind. Do thy very best to ensure that the translation is in conformity  with the original.    The Blessed Beauty proceeded to Haifa on many occasions. Thou beheldest  Him there, but thou didst not know Him at that time. It is my hope that  thou wilt attain unto the true meeting with Him, which is to behold Him  with the inner, not the outer eye.    The essence of Baha'u'llah's Teaching is all-embracing love, for love  includeth every excellence of humankind. It causeth every soul to go  forward. It bestoweth on each one, for a heritage, immortal life. Erelong  shalt thou bear witness that His celestial Teachings, the very glory of  reality itself, shall light up the skies of the world.    The brief prayer which thou didst write at the close of thy letter was  indeed original, touching and beautiful. Recite thou this prayer at all  times.            32: O YE HANDMAIDS OF THE LORD! IN THIS CENTURY--THE ...      O ye handmaids of the Lord! In this century--the century of the Almighty  Lord--the Day-Star of the Realms above, the Light of Truth, shineth in its  meridian splendour and its rays illuminate all regions. For this is the  age of the Ancient Beauty, the day of the revelation of the might and  power of the Most Great Name--may my life be offered up as a sacrifice for  His loved ones.    In the ages to come, though the Cause of God may rise and grow a  hundredfold and the shade of the Sadratu'l-Muntaha shelter all mankind,  yet this present century shall stand unrivalled, for it hath witnessed the  breaking of that Morn and the rising of that Sun. This century is, verily,  the source of His Light and the dayspring of His Revelation. Future ages  and generations shall behold the diffusion of its radiance and the  manifestations of its signs.    Wherefore, exert yourselves, haply ye may obtain your full share and  portion of His bestowals.            33: O SERVANT OF GOD! WE HAVE NOTED WHAT THOU DIDST ...      O servant of God! We have noted what thou didst write to  Jinab-i-Ibn-'Abhar, and thy question regarding the verse: 'Whoso layeth  claim to a Revelation direct from God, ere the expiration of a full  thousand years, such a man is assuredly a lying impostor.'    The meaning of this is that any individual who, before the expiry of a  full thousand years--years known and clearly established by common usage  and requiring no interpretation--should lay claim to a Revelation direct  from God, even though he should reveal certain signs, that man is  assuredly false and an impostor.    This is not a reference to the Universal Manifestation, for it is clearly  set forth in the Holy Writings that centuries, nay thousands of years,  must pass on to completion, before a Manifestation like unto this  Manifestation shall appear again.    It is possible, however, that after the completion of a full thousand  years, certain Holy Beings will be empowered to deliver a Revelation:  this, however, will not be through a Universal Manifestation. Wherefore  every day of the cycle of the Blessed Beauty is in reality equal to one  year, and every year of it is equal to a thousand years.    Consider, for example, the sun: its transit from one zodiacal sign to the  next occurreth within a short period of time, yet only after a long period  doth it attain the plenitude of its resplendency, its heat and glory, in  the sign of Leo. It must first complete one full revolution through the  other constellations before it will enter the sign of Leo again, to blaze  out in its full splendour. In its other stations, it revealeth not the  fullness of its heat and light.    The substance is, that prior to the completion of a thousand years, no  individual may presume to breathe a word. All must consider themselves to  be of the order of subjects, submissive and obedient to the commandments  of God and the laws of the House of Justice. Should any deviate by so much  as a needle's point from the decrees of the Universal House of Justice, or  falter in his compliance therewith, then is he of the outcast and  rejected.    As to the cycle of the Blessed Beauty--the times of the Greatest Name--this  is not limited to a thousand or two thousand years....    When it is said that the period of a thousand years beginneth with the  Manifestation of the Blessed Beauty and every day thereof is a thousand  years, the intent is a reference to the cycle of the Blessed Beauty, which  in this context will extend over many ages into the unborn reaches of  time.            34: O THOU WHO ART SERVING THE WORLD OF HUMANITY! ...      O thou who art serving the world of humanity! Thy letter was received and  from its contents we felt exceedingly glad. It was a decisive proof and a  brilliant evidence. It is appropriate and befitting that in this illumined  age--the age of the progress of the world of humanity--we should be  self-sacrificing and should serve the human race. Every universal cause is  divine and every particular one is temporal. The principles of the divine  Manifestations of God were, therefore, all-universal and all-inclusive.    Every imperfect soul is self-centred and thinketh only of his own good.  But as his thoughts expand a little he will begin to think of the welfare  and comfort of his family. If his ideas still more widen, his concern will  be the felicity of his fellow citizens; and if still they widen, he will  be thinking of the glory of his land and of his race. But when ideas and  views reach the utmost degree of expansion and attain the stage of  perfection, then will he be interested in the exaltation of humankind. He  will then be the well-wisher of all men and the seeker of the weal and  prosperity of all lands. This is indicative of perfection.    Thus, the divine Manifestations of God had a universal and all-inclusive  conception. They endeavoured for the sake of everyone's life and engaged  in the service of universal education. The area of their aims was not  limited--nay, rather, it was wide and all-inclusive.    Therefore, ye must also be thinking of everyone, so that mankind may be  educated, character moderated and this world may turn into a Garden of  Eden.    Love ye all religions and all races with a love that is true and sincere  and show that love through deeds and not through the tongue; for the  latter hath no importance, as the majority of men are, in speech,  well-wishers, while action is the best.            35: O ARMY OF GOD! A LETTER SIGNED JOINTLY BY ALL OF ...      O army of God! A letter signed jointly by all of you hath been received.  It was most eloquent and full of flavour, and reading it was a delight.    Ye had written of the fasting month. Fortunate are ye to have obeyed the  commandment of God, and kept this fast during the holy season. For this  material fast is an outer token of the spiritual fast; it is a symbol of  self-restraint, the withholding of oneself from all appetites of the self,  taking on the characteristics of the spirit, being carried away by the  breathings of heaven and catching fire from the love of God.    Your letter also betokened your unity and the closeness of your hearts. It  is my hope that the west, through the boundless grace that God is pouring  down in this new era, will become the east, the dawning-point of the Sun  of Truth, and western believers the daysprings of light, and manifestors  of the signs of God; that they will be guarded from the doubts of the  heedless and will stay firm and unmoveable in the Covenant and Testament;  that they will toil by day and by night until they awaken those who sleep,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19289"],[0,"Some Answered Questions (#14)"],[1," earth is to be  verdant and fertile through the bounty of the clouds of springtime. Plants  grow; flowers and fragrant herbs spring up; fruit-bearing trees become  full of blossoms and bring forth fresh and new fruit. Gardens become  beautiful, and meadows adorned; mountains and plains are clad in a green  robe, and gardens, fields, villages and cities are decorated. This is the  prosperity of the mineral world.    The height of exaltation and the perfection of the vegetable world is that  a tree should grow on the bank of a stream of fresh water, that a gentle  breeze should blow on it, that the warmth of the sun should shine on it,  that a gardener should attend to its cultivation, and that day by day it  should develop and yield fruit. But its real prosperity is to progress  into the animal and human world, and replace that which has been exhausted  in the bodies of animals and men.    The exaltation of the animal world is to possess perfect members, organs  and powers, and to have all its needs supplied. This is its chief glory,  its honor and exaltation. So the supreme happiness of an animal is to have  possession of a green and fertile meadow, perfectly pure flowing water,  and a lovely, verdant forest. If these things are provided for it, no  greater prosperity can be imagined. For example, if a bird builds its nest  in a green and fruitful forest, in a beautiful high place, upon a strong  tree, and at the top of a lofty branch, and if it finds all it needs of  seeds and water, this is its perfect prosperity.    But real prosperity for the animal consists in passing from the animal  world to the human world, like the microscopic beings that, through the  water and air, enter into man and are assimilated, and replace that which  has been consumed in his body. This is the great honor and prosperity for  the animal world; no greater honor can be conceived for it.    Therefore, it is evident and clear that this wealth, this comfort and this  material abundance form the complete prosperity of minerals, vegetables  and animals. No riches, wealth, comfort or ease of the material world is  equal to the wealth of a bird; all the areas of these plains and mountains  are its dwelling, and all the seeds and harvests are its food and wealth,  and all the lands, villages, meadows, pastures, forests and wildernesses  are its possessions. Now, which is the richer, this bird, or the most  wealthy man? for no matter how many seeds it may take or bestow, its  wealth does not decrease.    Then it is clear that the honor and exaltation of man must be something  more than material riches. Material comforts are only a branch, but the  root of the exaltation of man is the good attributes and virtues which are  the adornments of his reality. These are the divine appearances, the  heavenly bounties, the sublime emotions, the love and knowledge of God;  universal wisdom, intellectual perception, scientific discoveries,  justice, equity, truthfulness, benevolence, natural courage and innate  fortitude; the respect for rights and the keeping of agreements and  covenants; rectitude in all circumstances; serving the truth under all  conditions; the sacrifice of one's life for the good of all people;  kindness and esteem for all nations; obedience to the teachings of God;  service in the Divine Kingdom; the guidance of the people, and the  education of the nations and races. This is the prosperity of the human  world! This is the exaltation of man in the world! This is eternal life  and heavenly honor!    These virtues do not appear from the reality of man except through the  power of God and the divine teachings, for they need supernatural power  for their manifestation. It may be that in the world of nature a trace of  these perfections may appear, but they are unstable and ephemeral; they  are like the rays of the sun upon the wall.    As the compassionate God has placed such a wonderful crown upon the head  of man, man should strive that its brilliant jewels may become visible in  the world.            PART TWO: SOME CHRISTIAN SUBJECTS          16: OUTWARD FORMS AND SYMBOLS MUST BE USED TO CONVEY INTELLECTUAL  CONCEPTIONS      A subject that is essential(77) for the comprehension of the questions  that we have mentioned, and of others of which we are about to speak, so  that the essence of the problems may be understood, is this: that human  knowledge is of two kinds. One is the knowledge of things perceptible to  the senses--that is to say, things which the eye, or ear, or smell, or  taste, or touch can perceive, which are called objective or sensible. So  the sun, because it can be seen, is said to be objective; and in the same  way sounds are sensible because the ear hears them; perfumes are sensible  because they can be inhaled and the sense of smell perceives them; foods  are sensible because the palate perceives their sweetness, sourness or  saltness; heat and cold are sensible because the feelings perceive them.  These are said to be sensible realities.    The other kind of human knowledge is intellectual--that is to say, it is a  reality of the intellect; it has no outward form and no place and is not  perceptible to the senses. For example, the power of intellect is not  sensible; none of the inner qualities of man is a sensible thing; on the  contrary, they are intellectual realities. So love is a mental reality and  not sensible; for this reality the ear does not hear, the eye does not  see, the smell does not perceive, the taste does not discern, the touch  does not feel. Even ethereal matter, the forces of which are said in  physics to be heat, light, electricity and magnetism, is an intellectual  reality, and is not sensible. In the same way, nature, also, in its  essence is an intellectual reality and is not sensible; the human spirit  is an intellectual, not sensible reality. In explaining these intellectual  realities, one is obliged to express them by sensible figures because in  exterior existence there is nothing that is not material. Therefore, to  explain the reality of the spirit--its condition, its station--one is  obliged to give explanations under the forms of sensible things because in  the external world all that exists is sensible. For example, grief and  happiness are intellectual things; when you wish to express those  spiritual qualities you say: \"My heart is oppressed; my heart is dilated,\"  though the heart of man is neither oppressed nor dilated. This is an  intellectual or spiritual state, to explain which you are obliged to have  recourse to sensible figures. Another example: you say, \"such an  individual made great progress,\" though he is remaining in the same place;  or again, \"such a one's position was exalted,\" although, like everyone  else, he walks upon the earth. This exaltation and this progress are  spiritual states and intellectual realities, but to explain them you are  obliged to have recourse to sensible figures because in the exterior world  there is nothing that is not sensible.    So the symbol of knowledge is light, and of ignorance, darkness; but  reflect, is knowledge sensible light, or ignorance sensible darkness? No,  they are merely symbols. These are only intellectual states, but when you  desire to express them outwardly, you call knowledge light, and ignorance  darkness. You say: \"My heart was gloomy, and it became enlightened.\" Now,  that light of knowledge, and that darkness of ignorance, are intellectual  realities, not sensible ones; but when we seek for explanations in the  external world, we are obliged to give them a sensible form.    Then it is evident that the dove which descended upon Christ was not a  material dove, but it was a spiritual state, which, that it might be  comprehensible, was expressed by a sensible figure. Thus in the Old  Testament it is said that God appeared as a pillar of fire: this does not  signify the material form; it is an intellectual reality which is  expressed by a sensible image.    Christ says, \"The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father.\" Was  Christ within God, or God within Christ? No, in the name of God! On the  contrary, this is an intellectual state which is expressed in a sensible  figure.    We come to the explanation of the words of Baha'u'llah when He says: \"O  king! I was but a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when lo, the  breezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught Me the  knowledge of all that hath been. This thing is not from Me, but from One  Who is Almighty and All-Knowing.\"(78) This is the state of manifestation:  it is not sensible; it is an intellectual reality, exempt and freed from  time, from past, present and future; it is an explanation, a simile, a  metaphor and is not to be accepted literally; it is not a state that can  be comprehended by man. Sleeping and waking is passing from one state to  another. Sleeping is the condition of repose, and wakefulness is the  condition of movement. Sleeping is the state of silence; wakefulness is  the state of speech. Sleeping is the state of mystery; wakefulness is the  state of manifestation.    For example, it is a Persian and Arabic expression to say that the earth  was asleep, and the spring came, and it awoke; or the earth was dead, and  the spring came, and it revived. These expressions are metaphors,  allegories, mystic explanations in the world of signification.    Briefly, the Holy Manifestations have ever been, and ever will be,  Luminous Realities; no change or variation takes place in Their essence.  Before declaring Their manifestation, They are silent and quiet like a  sleeper, and after Their manifestation, They speak and are illuminated,  like one who is awake.          17: THE BIRTH OF CHRIST      Question.--How was Christ born of the Holy Spirit?    Answer.--In regard to this question, theologians and materialists disagree.  The theologians believe that Christ was born of the Holy Spirit, but the  materialists"]]]
