HAJI MULLA MIHDIY-I-YAZDI      Yet another who left his homeland was Mulla Mihdi of Yazd. Although to all  appearances this excellent man was not of the learned class, he was an  expert in the field of Muslim sacred traditions and an eloquent  interpreter of orally transmitted texts. Persevering in his devotions,  known for holy practices and nightly communings and vigils, his heart was  illumined, and he was spiritual of mind and soul. He spent most of his  time repeating communes, performing the obligatory prayers, confessing his  failings and supplicating the Lord. He was one of those who penetrate  mysteries, and was a confidant of the righteous. As a teacher of the Faith  he was never at a loss for words, forgetting, as he taught, all restraint,  pouring forth one upon another sacred traditions and texts.    When news of him spread around the town and he was everywhere charged, by  prince and pauper alike, with bearing this new name, he freely declared  his adherence and on this account was publicly disgraced. Then the evil  'ulamas of Yazd rose up, issuing a decree that he must die. Since the  mujtahid, Mulla Baqir of Ardikan, refused to confirm the sentence of those  dark divines, Mulla Mihdi lived on, but was forced to leave his native  home. With his two sons, one the great martyr-to-be, Jinab-i-Varqa, and  the other Jinab-i-Husayn, he set out for the country of his Well-Beloved.  In every town and village along the way, he ably spread the Faith,  adducing clear arguments and proofs, quoting from and interpreting the  sacred traditions and evident signs.(49) He did not rest for a moment;  everywhere he shed abroad the attar of the love of God, and diffused the  sweet breathings of holiness. And he inspired the friends, making them  eager to teach others in their turn, and to excel in knowledge.    He was an eminent soul, with his heart fixed on the beauty of God. From  the day he was first created and came into this world, he single-mindedly  devoted all his efforts to acquiring grace for the day he should be born  into the next.(50) His heart was illumined, his mind spiritual, his soul  aspiring, his destination Heaven. He was imprisoned along his way; and as  he crossed the deserts and climbed and descended the mountain slopes he  endured terrible, uncounted hardships. But the light of faith shone from  his brow and in his breast the longing was aflame, and thus he joyously,  gladly passed over the frontiers until at last he came to Beirut. In that  city, ill, restive, his patience gone, he spent some days. His yearning  grew, and his agitation was such that weak and sick as he was, he could  wait no more.    He set out on foot for the house of Baha'u'llah. Because he lacked proper  shoes for the journey, his feet were bruised and torn; his sickness  worsened; he could hardly move, but still he went on; somehow he reached  the village of Mazra'ih and here, close by the Mansion, he died. His heart  found his Well-Beloved One, when he could bear the separation no more. Let  lovers be warned by his story; let them know how he gambled away his life  in his yearning after the Light of the World. May God give him to drink of  a brimming cup in the everlasting gardens; in the Supreme Assemblage, may  God shed upon his face rays of light. Upon him be the glory of the Lord.  His sanctified tomb is in Mazra'ih, beside Akka. His Eminence Kalim (Mirza  Musa)    Jinab-i-Mirza Musa was the true brother of Baha'u'llah, and from earliest  childhood he was reared in the sheltering embrace of the Most Great Name.  He drank in the love of God with his mother's milk; when yet a suckling,  he showed an extraordinary attachment to the Blessed Beauty. At all times  he was the object of Divine grace, favor and loving-kindness. After their  distinguished father died, Mirza Musa was brought up by Baha'u'llah,  growing to maturity in the haven of His care. Day by day, the youth's  servitude and devotion increased. In all things, he lived according to the  commandments, and he was entirely severed from any thoughts of this world.    Like a bright lamp, he shone out in that Household. He wished neither rank  nor office, and had no worldly aims at all. His one supreme desire was to  serve Baha'u'llah, and for this reason he was never separated from his  Brother's presence. No matter what torments the others inflicted, his  loyalty equaled the cruelty of the rest, for he had drunk the wine of  unadulterated love.    Then the voice was heard, crying out of _Sh_iraz, and from a single  utterance of Baha'u'llah's his heart was filled with light, and from a  single gust that blew over the gardens of faith, he caught the fragrance.  At once, he began to serve the friends. He had an extraordinary attachment  to me, and was at all times concerned for my well-being. In Tihran he  occupied himself day and night with propagating the Faith and gradually  became well known to everyone; habitually he spent his time in the company  of blessed souls.    Baha'u'llah then left Tihran, journeying to 'Iraq, and of His brothers the  two who were in His company were Aqay-i-Kalim(51) and Mirza Muhammad-Quli.  They turned their faces away from Persia and the Persians, and closed  their eyes to comfort and peace; in the Beloved's path they chose with all  their hearts to bear whatever calamity should be their lot.    Thus they arrived in 'Iraq. During the days when Baha'u'llah had vanished  from sight, that is, when He was on the journey to Kurdistan, Aqay-i-Kalim  lived on the edge of an abyss; his life was constantly in danger, and each  day that passed was worse than the one before; still, he bore it all, and  knew no fear. When at last the Blessed Beauty returned out of Kurdistan,  Aqay-i-Kalim resumed his post by the Holy Threshold, rendering every  service within his power. For this he became known far and wide. At the  time when Baha'u'llah left Ba_gh_dad for Constantinople, Aqay-i-Kalim was  with Him and continued to serve along the way, as he did on the further  journey from Constantinople to Adrianople.    It was during the sojourn in this latter city that he detected from Mirza  Yahya the odor of rebellion. Day and night he tried to make him mend his  ways, but all to no avail. On the contrary, it was astonishing how, like a  deadly poison, the temptings and satanic suggestions of Siyyid Muhammad  worked on Mirza Yahya, so that Aqay-i-Kalim finally abandoned hope. Even  then he never ceased trying, thinking that somehow, perhaps, he could  still the tempest and rescue Mirza Yahya from the gulf. His heart was worn  away with despair and grief. He tried everything he knew. At last he had  to admit the truth of these words of Sana'i:    If to the fool my lore you'd bring,  Or think my secrets can be told  To him who is not wise--  Then to the deaf go harp and sing,  Or stand before the blind and hold  A mirror to his eyes.    When all hope was gone, he ended the relationship, saying: \"O my brother,  if others are in doubt as to this affair, you and I both know the truth.  Have you forgotten the loving-kindness of Baha'u'llah, and how He trained  us both? What care He took with your lessons and your penmanship; how  constantly He saw to your spelling and your composition, and encouraged  you to practice the different calligraphic styles; He even guided your  copy with His own blessed fingers. Who does not know how He showered  favors on you, how He brought you up in the haven of His embrace. Is this  your thanks for all His tenderness--that you plot with Siyyid Muhammad and  desert the shelter of Baha'u'llah? Is this your loyalty? Is this the right  return for all His love?\" The words had no effect whatever; on the  contrary, with each passing day, Mirza Yahya disclosed a greater measure  of his concealed intent. Then at the end, the final rupture took place.    From Adrianople, Aqay-i-Kalim went on with the convoy of Baha'u'llah, to  the fortress of Akka. His name was specifically listed in the Sultan's  decree, and he was condemned to perpetual banishment.(52) He devoted all  his time in the Most Great Prison to serving Baha'u'llah, and had the  honor of being continually in his Brother's presence, also keeping company  with the believers; until at last he left this world of dust and hastened  to the holy world above, dying with lowliness and contrition, as he  supplicated his Lord.    It happened that during the Ba_gh_dad period, the well-known Il_kh_ani,  son of Musa _Kh_an-i-Qazvini, received through Siyyid Javad-i-Tabataba'i  an audience with Baha'u'llah. Siyyid Javad on that occasion made a plea in  the Il_kh_ani's behalf, saying: \"This Il_kh_ani, 'Ali-Quli _Kh_an,  although a sinner and a lifelong creature of his passions, has now  repented. He stands before You with regret as to his former ways, and from  this day forward he will not so much as draw a breath that might be  contrary to Your good pleasure. I beg of You, accept his repentance; make  him the object of Your grace and favor.\"    Baha'u'llah replied: \"Because he has chosen you as intercessor, I will  hide away his sins, and I will take steps to bring him comfort and peace  of mind.\"    The Il_kh_ani had been a man of unlimited wealth, but he had wasted it all  on the desires of the flesh. He was now destitute, to such a point that he  did not even dare to step outside his house, because of the creditors  waiting there to fall upon him. Baha'u'llah directed him to go to Umar  Pa_sh_a, the Governor of Damascus, and obtain from him a letter of  recommendation to Constantinople. The Il_kh_ani complied, and he received  every assistance from the Governor of Ba_gh_dad. After utter despair, he  began to hope again, and left for Constantinople. When he arrived at  Diyarbakr(53) he penned a letter on behalf of two Armenian merchants.  \"Thes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19282"],[0,"The Promised Day Is Come (#14)"],[1,"following: 'I have,  as requested by you, delivered your letter, and until now have received no  answer. We have, however, issued the necessary recommendations to our  Minister in Constantinople and our consuls in those regions. If there be  anything you wish done, inform us, and we will carry it out.' From his  words it became apparent that he understood the purpose of this Servant to  have been a request for material assistance.\"    In His first Tablet Baha'u'llah, wishing to test the sincerity of the  Emperor's motives, and deliberately assuming a meek and unprovocative  tone, had, after expatiating on the sufferings He had endured, addressed  him the following words: \"Two statements graciously uttered by the king of  the age have reached the ears of these wronged ones. These pronouncements  are, in truth, the king of all pronouncements, the like of which have  never been heard from any sovereign. The first was the answer given the  Russian government when it inquired why the war [Crimean] was waged  against it. Thou didst reply: 'The cry of the oppressed who, without guilt  or blame, were drowned in the Black Sea wakened me at dawn. Wherefore, I  took up arms against thee.' These oppressed ones, however, have suffered a  greater wrong, and are in greater distress. Whereas the trials inflicted  upon those people lasted but one day, the troubles borne by these servants  have continued for twenty and five years, every moment of which has held  for us a grievous affliction. The other weighty statement, which was  indeed a wondrous statement, manifested to the world, was this: 'Ours is  the responsibility to avenge the oppressed and succor the helpless.' The  fame of the Emperor's justice and fairness hath brought hope to a great  many souls. It beseemeth the king of the age to inquire into the condition  of such as have been wronged, and it behooveth him to extend his care to  the weak. Verily, there hath not been, nor is there now, on earth anyone  as oppressed as we are, or as helpless as these wanderers.\"    It is reported that upon receipt of this first Message that superficial,  tricky, and pride-intoxicated monarch flung down the Tablet saying: \"If  this man is God, I am two gods!\" The transmitter of the second Tablet had,  it is reliably stated, in order to evade the strict surveillance of the  guards, concealed it in his hat, and was able to deliver it to the French  agent, who resided in Akka, and who, as attested by Nabil in his  Narrative, translated it into French and sent it to the Emperor, he  himself becoming a believer when he had later witnessed the fulfillment of  so remarkable a prophecy.    The significance of the somber and pregnant words uttered by Baha'u'llah  in His second Tablet was soon revealed. He who was actuated in provoking  the Crimean War by his selfish desires, who was prompted by a personal  grudge against the Russian Emperor, who was impatient to tear up the  Treaty of 1815 in order to avenge the disaster of Moscow, and who sought  to shed military glory over his throne, was soon himself engulfed by a  catastrophe that hurled him in the dust, and caused France to sink from  her preeminent station among the nations to that of a fourth power in  Europe.    The Battle of Sedan in 1870 sealed the fate of the French Emperor. The  whole of his army was broken up and surrendered, constituting the greatest  capitulation hitherto recorded in modern history. A crushing indemnity was  exacted. He himself was taken prisoner. His only son, the Prince Imperial,  was killed, a few years later, in the Zulu War. The Empire collapsed, its  program unrealized. The Republic was proclaimed. Paris was subsequently  besieged and capitulated. \"The terrible Year\" marked by civil war,  exceeding in its ferocity the Franco-German War, followed. William I, the  Prussian king, was proclaimed German Emperor in the very palace which  stood as a \"mighty monument and symbol of the power and pride of Louis  XIV, a power which had been secured to some extent by the humiliation of  Germany.\" Deposed by a disaster \"so appalling that it resounded throughout  the world,\" this false and boastful monarch suffered in the end, and till  his death, the same exile as that which, in the case of Baha'u'llah, he  had so heartlessly ignored.    A humiliation less spectacular yet historically more significant awaited  Pope Pius IX. It was to him who regarded himself as the Vicar of Christ  that Baha'u'llah wrote that \"the Word which the Son [Jesus] concealed is  made manifest,\" that \"it hath been sent down in the form of the human  temple,\" that the Word was Himself, and He Himself the Father. It was to  him who styling himself \"the servant of the servants of God\" that the  Promised One of all ages, unveiling His station in its plenitude,  announced that \"He Who is the Lord of Lords is come overshadowed with  clouds.\" It was he, who, claiming to be the successor of St. Peter, was  reminded by Baha'u'llah that \"this is the day whereon the Rock [Peter]  crieth out and shouteth ... saying: 'Lo, the Father is come, and that  which ye were promised in the Kingdom is fulfilled.'\" It was he, the  wearer of the triple crown, who later became the first prisoner of the  Vatican, who was commanded by the Divine Prisoner of Akka to \"leave his  palaces unto such as desire them,\" to \"sell all the embellished ornaments\"  he possessed, and to \"expend them in the path of God,\" and to \"abandon his  kingdom unto the kings,\" and emerge from his habitation with his face \"set  towards the Kingdom.\"    Count Mastai-Ferretti, Bishop of Imola, the 254th pope since the inception  of St. Peter's primacy, who had been elevated to the apostolic throne two  years after the Declaration of the Bab, and the duration of whose  pontificate exceeded that of any of his predecessors, will be permanently  remembered as the author of the Bull which declared the Immaculate  Conception of the Blessed Virgin (1854), referred to in the Kitab-i-Iqan,  to be a doctrine of the Church, and as the promulgator of the new dogma of  Papal Infallibility (1870). Authoritarian by nature, a poor statesman,  disinclined to conciliation, determined to preserve all his authority, he,  while he succeeded through his assumption of an ultramontane attitude in  defining further his position and in reinforcing his spiritual authority,  failed, in the end, to maintain that temporal rule which, for so many  centuries, had been exercised by the heads of the Catholic Church.    This temporal power had, throughout the ages, shrunk to insignificant  proportions. The decades preceding its extinction were fraught with the  gravest vicissitudes. As the sun of Baha'u'llah's Revelation was mounting  to full meridian splendor, the shadows that beset the dwindling patrimony  of St. Peter were correspondingly deepening. The Tablet of Baha'u'llah,  addressed to Pius IX, precipitated its extinction. A hasty glance at the  course of its ebbing fortunes, during those decades, will suffice.  Napoleon I had driven the Pope from his estates. The Congress of Vienna  had reestablished him as their head and their administration in the hands  of the priests. Corruption, disorganization, impotence to ensure internal  security, the restoration of the inquisition, had induced an historian to  assert that \"no land of Italy, perhaps of Europe, except Turkey, is ruled  as is this ecclesiastical state.\" Rome was \"a city of ruins, both material  and moral.\" Insurrections led to Austria's intervention. Five great Powers  demanded the introduction of far-reaching reforms, which the Pope promised  but failed to carry out. Austria again reasserted herself, and was opposed  by France. Both watched each other on the Papal estates until 1838, when,  on their withdrawal, absolutism was again restored. The Pope's temporal  power was now denounced by some of his own subjects, heralding its  extinction in 1870. Internal complications forced him to flee, in the dead  of night and in the disguise of a humble priest, from Rome which was  declared a republic. It was later restored by the French to its former  status. The creation of the kingdom of Italy, the shifting policy of  Napoleon III, the disaster of Sedan, the misdeeds of the Papal government  denounced by Clarendon, at the Congress of Paris, terminating the Crimean  War, as a \"disgrace to Europe,\" sealed the fate of that tottering  dominion.    In 1870, after Baha'u'llah had revealed His Epistle to Pius IX, King  Victor Emmanuel II went to war with the Papal states, and his troops  entered Rome and seized it. On the eve of its seizure, the Pope repaired  to the Lateran and, despite his age and with his face bathed in tears,  ascended on bended knees the Scala Santa. The following morning, as the  cannonade began, he ordered the white flag to be hoisted above the dome of  St. Peter. Despoiled, he refused to recognize this \"creation of  revolution,\" excommunicated the invaders of his states, denounced Victor  Emmanuel as the \"robber King\" and as \"forgetful of every religious  principle, despising every right, trampling upon every law.\" Rome, \"the  Eternal City, on which rest twenty-five centuries of glory,\" and over  which the Popes had ruled in unchallengeable right for ten centuries,  finally became the seat of the new kingdom, and the scene of that  humiliation which Baha'u'llah had anticipated and which the Prisoner of  the Vatican had imposed upon himself.    \"The last years of the old Pope,\" writes a commentator on his life, \"were  filled with anguish. To his physical infirmities was added the sorrow of  beholding, all too often, the Faith outraged in the very heart of Rome,  the religious orders despoiled and persecuted, the Bishops and priests  debarred from exercising their functions.\"    Every effort to retrieve the situation created in 1870 proved fruitless.  The Archbishop of Posen went to Versailles to solicit Bismarck's  intervention in behalf of the Papacy, "]]]
