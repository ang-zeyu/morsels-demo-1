We are able to bear up under the greatest afflictions when our  soul is free from guilt! And therefore I will meet the future  courageously and patiently, hoping that God will have mercy on us.  Henceforth there will be but one duty for me, and that is, to be a  faithful mother, and a comforter to my husband in his misfortunes. Oh,  Caroline, my heart, which was lately, as it were, frozen and dead, is  reawakening now--it is living and throbbing with joy, for I shall see my  husband and my children! If all should forsake us, love will remain with  us, and he whose heart is full of love will not be forsaken by the  Lord.\"    She leaned back and closed her eyes. Profound peace was depicted on her  handsome face; her brow was calm and cloudless, and a sweet smile played  on her lips. Grief had not yet marked this noble and youthful  countenance with its mournful yet eloquent traces, and its handwriting  was not yet to be read on her expansive forehead.    \"Oh,\" whispered her friend to herself, contemplating the beautiful  slumbering queen, \"oh, that grief might pass away from her like a dark  cloud--that no thunderbolt burst forth from it and strike that beloved  head! But I am afraid the lightning will at last blight all the blossoms  of her heart. O God, give her strength, nerve her in her sufferings, as  Thou hast blessed her in her happiness! She is sleeping; let her slumber  be peaceful and refreshing, so that it may invigorate her mind!\" Madame  von Berg leaned cautiously, in order not to disturb the queen, into the  other corner of the carriage, which rapidly drove along the high-road.    The journey was continued uninterruptedly from station to station; in  every town and village the people, as soon they had recognized her,  hastened to procure fresh horses for her, and crowds gathered everywhere  to cheer her on her way. She had already passed through Frankfort, and  stopped in the village of Rettwein in front of the superintendent's  house. The footman entered and asked in her name for another set of  horses. The superintendent looked at him uneasily and gloomily. \"I will  get them directly,\" he said; \"I will go myself to the stable and harness  them, in order not to detain the queen unnecessarily.\" He left the house  hastily, and the footman returned to the carriage.    Louisa had risen and contemplated with a melancholy air the deserted  landscape. For the first time since the beginning of her journey she was  not welcomed on her arrival. Nobody seemed to know or care that it was  the queen who was seated in the carriage. Only a few tow-headed  peasants' children, in ragged, dirty dresses, rushed toward the  superintendent's house and stared at her, without saluting or thanking  her for her kindly nods.    \"We shall frequently ride out of the gate, but no drums will be beaten,\"  murmured she, with a faint smile, and sank back on the cushions.    Time passed, and no horses made their appearance. The queen glanced  uneasily at her watch. \"We have been here nearly an hour,\" she said;  \"this long delay renders me uneasy.\"    She rose once more and looked again out of the coach window. The same  silence prevailed. The children were still in front of the house, with  their fingers in their mouths staring at the carriage. At a distance the  dull lowing of the cows in their stables and the barking of dogs were to  be heard. No human being, except the few children, was to be seen; even  the superintendent did not make his appearance, although he knew that  the queen was waiting at his door. Just then, however, a laborer, in a  long blouse, with heavy wooden shoes, came out of the house and  remained at the door, staring with his small blue eyes at the royal  carriage.    \"I do not know why,\" murmured Louisa, uneasily, \"but this silence  frightens me; it fills my heart with a feeling of anxiety which I cannot  well explain. It seems to me as though every thing around me were  breathing treachery and mischief, and some great danger were menacing  me. Let us set out--we must leave this place. Why do not the horses  come?\"    \"Will your majesty permit me to call the footman, and ask him to hurry  up the postilion?\" said Madame von Berg, leaning out of the window.    \"Tell them to make haste,\" she said to the approaching footman. \"Her  majesty wishes to continue her journey immediately.\"    \"The horses are not yet here,\" exclaimed he anxiously; \"the  superintendent promised he would fetch and harness them himself, and he  does not return.\"    Some one set up a loud, scornful laugh, which reached the queen's ears.  She bent forward and looked uneasily at the laborer who was standing at  the door with folded arms. The footman turned, and asked him,  indignantly, why he laughed. The man looked at him with twinkling eyes.  \"Well,\" he said, \"I laugh because you are looking for horses, and have  been waiting here for an hour already. But they will not come, for the  superintendent has driven two of them through the back gate into the  field, and then mounted the third, and rode off!\"    The queen uttered a low cry, and placed her hand convulsively on her  heart; she felt there a piercing pain, depriving her of breath, and  turning her cheeks pale.    \"Then the stable is empty?\" said Madame von Berg.    \"Yes, and there is not a hack even in the whole village; the peasants  have taken them all to Kuestrin, lest the French should take them.\"    \"Are the French, then, so near?\"    \"The superintendent said this morning he had seen them at Baerwalde, two  miles from our village.\"    \"Let us start--let us set out without a minute's delay,\" said Louisa,  anxiously grasping her friend's arm. \"The superintendent is a traitor,  and has left the village in order to inform our enemies that I am here.  Oh, Caroline, we must escape, and if I cannot do otherwise, I shall  pursue my journey on foot!\"    \"No, your majesty, there must and will be some expedient,\" replied  Caroline, resolutely. \"Permit me to alight for a moment, and speak to  the postilion who drove us hither.\"    \"I shall alight with you,\" exclaimed the queen, rising and trying to  open the coach door.    Madame von Berg wished to keep her back. \"What,\" she exclaimed in  dismay. \"I am sure your majesty will not--\"    \"Speak personally to the postilion? Yes, I will. He is a human being,  like all of us, and at this hour happier and more enviable than we are.  Perhaps he will have mercy on his sovereign!\"    She hastily left the carriage, and ordered the footman to conduct her to  the postilion, who, during the last hour, had fed and watered his  horses, and was just about to ride back with them to his station. He  hastened to obey the order, and approached the queen, who stood  trembling near the carriage by the side of Madame von Berg.    \"Speak to him first,\" said Louisa to her friend.    \"You have heard that we cannot get any other horses,\" said Madame von  Berg. \"Her majesty wants you, therefore, to drive us to the next  station.\"    \"That is impossible, madame,\" said the postilion; \"my horses are  exhausted, and I myself am so weary that I am almost unable to stand,  for I have been on horseback for three days. We had to take fugitives to  Kuestrin all the time.\"    \"If you drive us thither rapidly and without delay, you shall be  liberally rewarded; you may depend on it,\" replied Madame von Berg.    \"All the rewards of the world would not do me any good, inasmuch as  neither I nor my horses are able to continue the journey to Kuestrin,\" he  replied, shrugging his shoulders. \"I would gladly comply with your  request, but I cannot.\"    \"You cannot?\" asked the queen, in her sonorous voice, \"have you any  children?\"    \"Yes, madame, I have children. Two boys and a girl.\"    \"Well, suppose you should hear that your children were in Kuestrin, that  some great danger was menacing them, and that they were anxiously crying  for their father. What would you do then?\"    \"I would gallop with lightning speed, not caring if the trip killed my  horses, could I only reach my children!\"    \"Well,\" said the queen, with a gentle smile, \"although you are a father,  and love your children so ardently, yet you are cruel enough to refuse  your assistance to a mother who wishes to hasten to hers? I beseech you  take me to them, for they are looking with anxiety for me.\" As she  uttered these words her eyes filled with tears, and her lips trembled.    The man was silent, and gazed with an air of surprise at Louisa's  beautiful face. \"Madame,\" he said, after a pause, \"pray enter the  carriage again. I will take you to Kuestrin--you shall be with your  children in an hour. But I tell you, madame,\" he added, turning to  Madame von Berg, \"I do not go for the sake of the reward you have  promised me, and I will not take any money. I go because it would be  infamous not to reunite a mother and her children. Now, make haste.\" He  turned round without waiting for a reply, and began to prepare for the  journey.    The queen gazed after him with beaming glances, and then raised her eyes  to heaven. \"I thank Thee, my God,\" she murmured. \"Give me strength that  I may still believe in the human heart, and that such a discovery as I  have made to-day as to the treachery of one man may not harden my heart!  Come, Caroline, let us enter; in an hour we shall be with my children;  oh, in an hour, I shall see the king!\" An expression of delight  overspread her face like sunshine, and she hastened to the carriage with  light, elastic steps.    The postilion whipped the horses. The village was soon left behind, and  they proceeded rapidly toward their destination.    \"How fast the kind-hearted man drives!\" said Louisa. \"He does not do so  for the sake of the queen, but because he thinks of his children, and  commiserates a mother's heart. Oh, I confess, my heart was painfully "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19564"],[0,"The Pirates' Who's Who (#14)"],[1," them into his protection if they would destroy  their ships. Having done this, they sailed to Mauritius, where they  settled down, and Captain Condent married the Governor's sister-in-law.    A few years later the captain and his wife left the island and sailed to  France, settling at St. Malo, where Condent drove a considerable trade as  a merchant.      COOK, CAPTAIN EDWARD, or EDMUND.    Was on the Pacific coast with Captains Sharp and Sawkins, 1680. Being  unable to keep order amongst his unruly crew, he resigned his ship and  command to Captain John Cox, a New Englander. He commanded a barque in the  successful sacking of Porto Bello in the same year in company with Sharp,  Coxon, and others.    On land engagements his flag was a red one striped with yellow, on which  was a device of a hand and sword.      COOK, GEORGE, _alias_ RAMEDAM.    An English renegade amongst the Barbary pirates of Algiers. Was gunner's  mate when captured in the _Exchange_ in 1622. Brought to Plymouth and  hanged.      COOK, WILLIAM.    Servant to Captain Edmund Cook, and was found, on being searched, to have  on him a paper with the names of all his fellow pirates written on it, and  was suspected of having prepared it to give to some of the Spanish  prisoners. For this, Captain Walters put him in irons on January 7th,  1681.    He died on board ship on Monday, February 14th, 1681, off the coast of  Chile.      COOKE, CAPTAIN JOHN.    This buccaneer was born in the Island of St. Christopher. \"A brisk, bold  man,\" he was promoted to the rank of quartermaster by Captain Yankey. On  taking a Spanish ship, Cooke claimed the command of her, which he was  entitled to, and would have gone in her with an English crew had not the  French members of the crew, through jealousy, sacked the ship and marooned  the Englishmen on the Island of Avache. Cooke and his men were rescued by  another French buccaneer, Captain Tristram, and taken to the Island of  Dominica. Here the English managed to get away with the ship, leaving  Tristram and his Frenchmen behind on land. Cooke, now with a ship of his  own, took two French ships loaded with wine. With this valuable cargo he  steered northward, and reached Virginia in April, 1683. He had no  difficulty in selling his wine for a good price to the New Englanders, and  with the profits prepared for a long voyage in his ship, the _Revenge_. He  took on board with him several famous buccaneers, including Dampier and  Cowley, the latter as sailing master. They first sailed to Sierra Leone,  then round the Horn to the Island of Juan Fernandez. Here Cooke was taken  ill. His next stop was at the Galapagos Islands. Eventually Cooke died a  mile or two off the coast of Cape Blanco in Mexico. His body was rowed  ashore to be buried, accompanied by an armed guard of twelve seamen. While  his grave was being dug three Spanish Indians came up, and asked so many  questions as to rouse the suspicions of the pirates, who seized them as  spies, but one escaping, he raised the whole countryside.      COOPER, CAPTAIN.    Commanded a pirate sloop, the _Night Rambler_. On November 14th, 1725, he  took the _Perry_ galley (Captain King, commander), three days out from  Barbadoes, and the following day a French sloop, and carried both prizes  to a small island called Aruba, near Curacao, where they plundered them  and divided the spoil amongst the crew. The crews of the two prizes were  kept on the island by Cooper for seventeen days, and would have starved if  the pirate's doctor had not taken compassion on them and procured them  food.    Upton, boatswain in the _Perry_, joined the pirates, and was afterwards  tried and hanged in England.      COOPER, CAPTAIN.    On October 19th, 1663, he brought into Port Royal, Jamaica, two Spanish  prizes, one the _Maria of Seville_, a royal azogue carrying 1,000 quintals  of quicksilver for the King of Spain's mines in Mexico, besides oil, wine,  and olives. Also a number of prisoners were taken, including several  friars on their way to Campeachy and Vera Cruz. The buccaneers always  rejoiced at capturing a priest or a friar, and these holy men generally  experienced very rough treatment at the hands of the pirates.    Cooper's ship was a frigate of ten guns, and a crew of eighty men.      CORBET, CAPTAIN.    Sailed with Captain Heidon from Bantry Bay in the _John of Sandwich_ in  1564 to search for a good prize in which he might go a-pirating on his own  account. The ship was wrecked on the Island of Alderney, and all the crew  arrested. Corbett and several others escaped in a small boat.      CORNELIUS, CAPTAIN.    A contemporary of Howard Burgess North and other Madagascar pirates.      DE COSSEY, STEPHEN JAMES.    With three other pirates was tried and convicted in June, 1717, before the  Vice-Admiralty Court at Charleston. The President of the Court was Judge  Trot, a terror to all pirates, as he never failed to hang a guilty one. De  Cossey and the other prisoners were found guilty of piratically taking the  vessels _Turtle Dove_, _Penelope_, and the _Virgin Queen_.      COWARD, WILLIAM.    In November, 1689, with three men and a boy he rowed out to the ketch  _Elinor_ (William Shortrigs, master), lying at anchor in Boston Harbour,  and seized the vessel and took her to Cape Cod. The crew of the ketch  could make no resistance as they were all down with the smallpox. The  pirates were caught and locked up in the new stone gaol in Boston. Hanged  on January 27th, 1690.      COWLEY, CAPTAIN C.    M.A. Cantab.    A man of high intelligence and an able navigator. In the year 1683 he  sailed from Achamach or Cape Charles in Virginia for Dominica as sailing  master of a privateer, the _Revenge_ (eight guns and fifty-two men), in  company with Dampier and Captain John Cooke. As soon as they were away  from the land, they turned buccaneers or pirates, and sailed to Sierra  Leone in West Africa. Thence to the coast of Brazil, round the Horn, where  Cowley mentions that owing to the intense cold weather the crew were able,  each man, to drink three quarts of burnt brandy a day without becoming  drunk.    On February 14th the buccaneers were abreast of Cape Horn, and in his  diary Cowley writes: \"We were choosing valentines and discoursing on the  Intrigues of Woman, when there arose a prodigious storm,\" which lasted  till the end of the month, driving them farther south than any ship had  ever been before; \"so that we concluded the discoursing of Women at sea  was very unlucky and occasioned the storm.\" Cowley, who was addicted to  giving new names to islands, not only named one Pepys Island, but when he  arrived at the Galapagos Islands, he rechristened them most thoroughly,  naming one King Charles Island, while others he named after the Dukes of  York, Norfolk, and Albemarle, and Sir John Narborough. Feeling, no doubt,  that he had done enough to honour the great, and perhaps to have insured  himself against any future trouble with the authorities when he returned  home, he named one small island \"Cowley's Enchanted Isle.\"    The Earl of Alington, Lord Culpepper, Lord Wenman, all had islands in this  group christened with their names and titles.    In September, 1684, Cowley, now in the _Nicholas_, separated from Davis,  and sailed from Ampalla for San Francisco, and then started west to cross  the Pacific Ocean. On March 14th, 1685, at seven o'clock in the morning,  after a voyage of 7,646 miles, land was at last seen, which proved to be  the Island of Guan.    The Spanish Governor was most friendly to the visitors, and when complaint  was made to him that the buccaneers had killed some of his Indian subjects  he \"gave us a Toleration to kill them all if we would.\" Presents were  exchanged, Cowley giving the Governor a valuable diamond ring, one, no  doubt, taken off the hand of some other loyal subject of the King of  Spain. Here the pirates committed several atrocious cruelties on the  Indians, who wished to be friends with the foreigners.    In April they arrived at Canton to refit, and while there, thirteen Tartar  ships arrived laden with Chinese merchandise, chiefly valuable silks.  Cowley wanted to attack and plunder them, but his crew refused to do so,  saying \"they came for gold and silver, and not to be made pedlars, to  carry packs on their backs,\" to Cowley's disgust, for he complains, \"had  Reason but ruled them, we might all have made our Fortunes and have done  no Christian Prince nor their subjects any harm at all.\" Thence they  sailed to Borneo, the animals and birds of which island Cowley describes.  Sailing next to Timor, the crew mutinied, and Cowley and eighteen others  bought a boat and sailed in her to Java, some 300 leagues. Here they heard  of the death of King Charles II., which caused Cowley to get out his map  of the Galapagos Islands, and to change the name of Duke of York Island to  King James Island. At Batavia Cowley procured a passage in a Dutch ship to  Cape Town. In June, 1686, he sailed for Holland after much health drinking  and salutes of 300 guns, arriving in that country in September, and  reaching London, \"through the infinite Mercy of God,\" on October 12th,  1686.      COX, CAPTAIN JOHN. Buccaneer.    Born in New England, and considered by some of his fellow buccaneers \"to  have forced kindred upon Captain Sharp\"--the leader of the fleet--\"out of  old acquaintance, only to advance himself.\" Thus he was made Vice-Admiral  to Captain Sharp, in place of Captain Cook, whose crew had mutinied and  refused to sail any longer under his command. Cox began his captaincy by  getting lost, but after a fortnight rejoined the fleet off the Island of  Plate, on the coast of Peru, \"to the great joy of us all.\" This island  received its name from the fact that Sir Francis Drake had here made a  division of his spoils, distributing to each man of his company sixteen  bowlfuls of doubloons and pieces of eight. The buccaneers rechristened it  Drake's Island. "]]]
