Armenia is a large food    importer and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The    economic decline in the past three years (1991-93) has been    particularly severe due to the ongoing conflict over the Armenian    enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Turkey have    blockaded pipeline and railroad traffic to Armenia for its support of    the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18019"],[0,"The Luckiest Girl in the School (#14)"],[1,"an authority upon every possible subject. There  was no doubt it was owing to her initiative that the two  scholarship-holders were gaining a position for themselves in the  school. As Garnet had foreseen, the part they had taken in the Symposium  won them favorable recognition. To be singled out as soloists and to  have the honor of playing an accompaniment for the prefects had raised  them above the common herd, and though a few were jealous, more were  ready to extend the hand of good fellowship. In their own Form they were  living down the prejudice which had at first existed against them. Hilda  Langley and Estelle Harrison were not very friendly and influenced Olave  Parry and Mollie Hill against them, but these formed a minority, and the  bulk of the girls seemed to have decided in their favor.    With the enormous demands made on her time by her home preparation,  Winona did not venture to join many of the school guilds. She would have  liked immensely to put her name down for election to the Dramatic  Society, the Debating Club and the Literary Association, but these all  required rather strenuous brain work from their members, and in the  circumstances she knew it would be folly to take them up. At some future  date, when her ordinary subjects proved less of a burden, she promised  herself the pleasure of being numbered among that select clique known  as \"The Intellectuals,\" but for the present her motto must be \"grim  grind.\" The Patriotic Knitting Guild seemed more feasible. She paid her  subscription, received her skeins of khaki wool, and started mittens to  fill up odd moments. She found the knitting a soothing occupation, it  could be taken up and laid down so easily; it often went to school with  her, and would come out during the interval, or while she was waiting  for a class. The Photographic Union was beyond her, for as yet she had  no camera, but she thought she was justified in joining the Natural  History League. This society did not for the present demand papers from  its members, but contented itself with encouraging the collection of  objects for the school museum. Its main activities would be during the  summer term, though a weather record was kept throughout the year, and  any nature notes that were worthy of being written down were duly  chronicled in the Field Book. Linda Fletcher and Annie Hardy, two of the  prefects, were the leading spirits in the League. Linda was great on  entomology, and, having a brother who was interested in the subject, had  been out \"sugaring\" in his company in August and September, and had  secured some fine specimens of moths. She had boxes full of chrysalides  which she fondly hoped would emerge in the spring into perfect insects,  and she had made quite a good little collection of beetles. Annie was  more interested in botany, she pressed flowers and leaves, dried fruits  and seed vessels, and made praiseworthy efforts at preserving funguses  in bottles, though these latter attempts were not always attended with  the success they deserved, as they were apt to acquire a gamey odor, to  which her mother very naturally objected, and she would be obliged  disconsolately to turn them out into the dust-bin.    November happened to be a particularly fine month at Seaton. There had  been little rain, and no high winds to blow the leaves away. Though the  trees in the city were bare, those in the country round about remained  almost in their October glory, and in sheltered woods some were still  green. The persistent sunshine encouraged the Natural History League to  plan an excursion for its members, and after a consultation with Miss  Lever, the Botany mistress, Linda pinned up the following announcement  on the school notice board:--    NATURAL HISTORY LEAGUE.  An Autumn Foray will be held on Saturday next, visiting Monkend Woods  and Copplestone Quarry. Members will meet at station for the 12.45 train  to Powerscroft, returning by the 5.30 from Chartwell. Tea at farm-house.  Walking distance five miles. Leaders: Miss Lever, Linda Fletcher and  Annie Hardy. Those intending to join kindly give their names to the  Secretary on Wednesday at latest.                                            L. FLETCHER,                                                       _Hon. Sec._    The prospect of a ramble was alluring. Winona was a country lover, so  she forthwith secured Aunt Harriet's permission for the outing and  placed her name upon the list.    \"I don't think there'll be more than a dozen of us altogether,\" said  Linda, \"but really a small party's more manageable than a big one, and  I'll undertake we enjoy ourselves. Miss Lever can get permission for us  to walk through the private part of the woods--there's no shooting this  autumn, you know--so that will be simply glorious, and she says we ought  to find some fossils in the quarry, if we've luck. I hope the weather  will keep up. Don't forget to take a vasculum or a basket, and a hammer  for fossils, and be sure you put on strong boots. The tea will probably  be eightpence a head. Miss Lever is writing beforehand to the farm to  make arrangements.\"    Garnet also was to join the excursion and she promised to call for  Winona, so that they might walk to the station together. The latter had  an early lunch, and was ready dressed and waiting for her friend by  twenty minutes past twelve. Garnet's tram was late, and by the time she  reached Abbey Close the clock pointed to the half-hour.    \"I'm frightfully sorry! You must think me a Juggins, but it wasn't my  fault!\" she apologized. \"We shall have to sprint, but we'll just do it.\"    The girls set off at a tremendous pace along the Close and down the  Abbey avenue, but it was difficult to keep the same speed through the  town, where the streets were thronged with country people who had come  in for the Saturday market. They got along as best they could, walking  first on the pavement and then on the road, dodging round stout females  bearing baskets, avoiding hooting motors, and finally making a dash down  a back street that led to the railway bridge. They clattered down the  steps to the booking office, secured their tickets and rushed on to the  platform. The hands of the big clock were at 12.45 exactly, the guard  was about to wave his green flag. They were too late to look for their  party; they simply pelted towards the nearest carriage, a porter opened  the door and they scrambled in just in the very nick of time.    \"Oh, thank goodness! Thank goodness!\" gasped Garnet. \"I thought we'd  miss it! I never had such a run in my life before! Oh! It's given me a  stitch in my side!\"    \"They've put us in a first!\" exulted Winona, breathlessly. \"We have it  all to ourselves! What luck! Hope they won't make a fuss about our  tickets when we get out!\"    \"It was the porter's fault. He opened the door. We'll ask Miss Lever to  explain. I suppose the others are further along somewhere in the train.  I wonder if they saw us get in?\"    \"If they didn't, it will be a surprise packet for them when we turn up.\"    \"Yes, they'll have made up their minds we're left behind.\"    The two girls leaned back, enjoying the luxury of traveling in a  first-class compartment. They felt the excursion had begun well as far  as they were concerned. Their satisfaction was short-lived, however.  When they neared Barnhill, the train, instead of stopping, rushed  through the station at thirty-five miles an hour. Garnet turned to  Winona in utter consternation.    \"Oh, good-night!\" she ejaculated. \"I verily believe we've gone and got  into the express!\"    They saw at once how it had happened. The 12.40 fast train to Rockfield  must have been five minutes late. In their hurry they had mistaken it  for the stopping train, which probably had been drawn up behind it in  the station.    \"Well, this is a pretty go!\" agreed Winona. \"We shall be carried on to  Rockfield and have to come back.\"    \"We shall miss the ramble! Oh, it's the limit of hard luck--to see  ourselves whizzing through Powerscroft!\"    \"I say, I believe we're stopping after all!\"    They let down the window and looked out. They were still about a mile  from Powerscroft, but the train drew up, probably in obedience to an  adverse signal. Then the girls did a terrible and awful thing. They  never remembered afterwards which suggested it, probably the idea  occurred to both simultaneously, but in defiance of the law of the realm  and the rules of the railway company, they opened the door of the  carriage and climbed down on to the line. There were some railings near,  and they scrambled over these and dodged down an embankment into a  coppice before anybody in the train had time to give an alarm. They  hoped their flight had not been noticed, but of that they could not be  sure. They hid behind some bushes until they heard the train rumble  away.    \"That was the smartest thing we've ever done in our lives!\" chuckled  Garnet. \"I believe we could be fined about ten pounds each if they  caught us!\"    \"Let us hurry on and try to find the road,\" said Winona, who was rather  frightened at her own temerity, and had a nervous apprehension lest a  guard or a signalman or some other railway official might even now be in  pursuit and arrest them on a charge of breaking the law.    After crossing a field they struck a path which led them eventually into  a by-lane.    \"I know where we are,\" affirmed Garnet. \"I bicycled this way once.  Monkend Woods are in that direction, and if we turn to the left and  through this village we shall get there sooner than the others, I  believe, and be waiting for them when they arrive. Their train won't  have reached Powerscroft yet.\"    \"We'd better step out all the same,\" urged Winona.    Fortunately Garnet possessed the bump of locality. Her recollection of  the district was correct, and after a brisk walk of about a mile they  found themselves in the high road close to the wood, and sat down on "]]]
