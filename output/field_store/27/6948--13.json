The parliament of Paris itself, the seat of law and  justice, instead of employing its authority to compose these fatal  quarrels, published an edict by which it put the sword into the hands  of the enraged multitude, and empowered the Catholics every where to  massacre the Hugonots:[***] and it was during this period, when men  began to be somewhat enlightened, and in this nation, renowned for  polished manners, that the theological rage, which had long been boiling  in men's veins, seems to have attained its last stage of virulence and  ferocity.         * Father Paul, lib. vii.         ** Father Paul, lib. vii.         *** Father Paul, lib. vii. Haynes, p. 391.    Philip, jealous of the progress which the Hugonots made in France, and  dreading that the contagion would spread into the Low Country provinces,  had formed a secret alliance with the princes of Guise, and had entered  into a mutual concert for the protection of the ancient faith and the  suppression of heresy. He now sent six thousand men, with some supply of  money, to reenforce the Catholic party; and the prince of Conde, finding  himself unequal to so great a combination, countenanced by the royal  authority, was obliged to despatch the Vidame of Chartres and Briguemaut  to London, in order to crave the assistance and protection of Elizabeth.  Most of the province of Normandy was possessed by the Hugonots: and  Conde offered to put Havre de Grace into the hands of the English; on  condition that, together with three thousand man for the garrison of  that place, the queen should likewise send over three thousand to defend  Dieppe and Rouen, and should furnish the prince with a supply of a  hundred thousand crowns.[*]    Elizabeth, besides the general and essential interest of supporting the  Protestants, and opposing the rapid progress of her enemy the duke of  Guise, had other motives which engaged her to accept of this proposal.  When she concluded the peace at Chateau-Cambresis, she had good reason  to foresee that France never would voluntarily fulfil the article which  regarded the restitution of Calais; and many subsequent incidents had  tended to confirm this suspicion. Considerable sums of money had been  expended on the fortifications; long leases had been granted of the  lands; and many inhabitants had been encouraged to build and settle  there, by assurances that Calais should never be restored to the  English.[**] The queen therefore wisely concluded, that, could she get  possession of Havre, a place which commanded the mouth of the Seine, and  was of greater importance than Calais, she should easily constrain the  French to execute the treaty, and should have the glory of restoring to  the crown that ancient possession, so much the favorite of the nation.    No measure could be more generally odious in France than the conclusion  of this treaty with Elizabeth. Men were naturally led to compare the  conduct of Guise, who had finally expelled the English, and had debarred  these dangerous and destructive enemies from all access into France,  with the treasonable politics of Conde, who had again granted them an  entrance into the heart of the kingdom. The prince had the more reason  to repent of this measure, as he reaped not from it all the advantage  which he expected. Three thousand English immediately took possession  of Havre and Dieppe, under the command of Sir Edward Poinings; but  the latter place was found so little capable of defence, that it was  immediately abandoned.[***] The siege of Rouen was already formed by the  Catholics, under the command of the king of Navarre and Montmorency; and  it was with difficulty that Poinings could throw a small  reenforcement into the place. Though these English troops behaved with  gallantry,[****] and though the king of Navarre was mortally wounded  during the siege, the Catholics still continued the attack of the place,  and carrying it at last by assault, put the whole garrison to the sword.         * Forbes, vol. ii. p. 48.         ** Forbes, vol. ii. p. 54, 257.         *** Forbes, vol. ii. p. 199.         **** Forbes, vol. ii. p. 161.    The earl of Warwick, eldest son of the late duke of Northumberland,  arrived soon after at Havre with another body of three thousand English,  and took on him the command of the place.    It was expected that the French Catholics, flushed with their success at  Rouen, would immediately have formed the siege of Havre, which was not  as yet in any condition of defence; but the intestine disorders of the  kingdom soon diverted their attention to another enterprise. Andelot,  seconded by the negotiations of Elizabeth, had levied a considerable  body of Protestants in Germany; and having arrived at Orleans, the seat  of the Hugonots' power, he enabled the prince of Conde and the admiral  to take the field, and oppose the progress of their enemies. After  threatening Paris during some time, they took their march towards  Normandy, with a view of engaging the English to act in conjunction with  them, and of fortifying themselves by the further assistance which  they expected from the zeal and vigor of Elizabeth.[*] The Catholics,  commanded by the constable, and under him by the duke of Guise, followed  on their rear; and overtaking them at Dreux, obliged them to give  battle. The field was fought with great obstinacy on both sides; and  the action was distinguished by this singular event, that Conde and  Montmorency, the commanders of the opposite armies, fell both of them  prisoners into the hands of their enemies. The appearances of victory  remained with Guise, but the admiral, whose fate it ever was to be  defeated, and still to rise more terrible after his misfortunes,  collected the remains of the army; and inspiring his own unconquerable  courage and constancy into every breast, kept them in a body, and  subdued some considerable places in Normandy. Elizabeth, the better to  support his cause, sent him a new supply of a hundred thousand crowns;  and offered, if he could find merchants to lend him the money, to give  her bond for another sum of equal amount.[**]         * Forbes, vol. ii. p. 320. Davila, lib. iii.         ** Forbes, vol. ii. p. 322, 347.    {1563.} The expenses incurred by assisting the French Hugonots had  emptied the queen's exchequer; and in order to obtain supply, she found  herself under a necessity of summoning a parliament: an expedient to  which she never willingly had recourse. A little before the meeting of  this assembly, she had fallen into a dangerous illness, the small-pox;  and as her life, during some time, was despaired of, the people  became the more sensible of their perilous situation, derived from the  uncertainty, which, in case of her demise, attended the succession of  the crown. The partisans of the queen of Scots, and those of the house  of Suffolk, already divided the nation into factions; and every one  foresaw, that, though it might be possible at present to determine the  controversy by law, yet, if the throne were vacant, nothing but the  sword would be able to fix a successor. The commons, therefore, on the  opening of the session, voted an address to the queen; in which, after  enumerating the dangers attending a broken and doubtful succession,  and mentioning the evils which their fathers had experienced from the  contending titles of York and Lancaster, they entreated the queen to  put an end to their apprehensions, by choosing some husband, whom they  promised, whoever he were, gratefully to receive, and faithfully to  serve, honor, and obey: or if she had entertained any reluctance to the  married state, they desired that the lawful successor might be named,  at least appointed by act of parliament. They remarked, that, during  all the reigns which had passed since the conquest, the nation had never  before been so unhappy as not to know the person who, in case of the  sovereign's death, was legally entitled to fill the vacant throne. And  they observed, that the fixed order which took place in inheriting the  French monarchy, was one chief source of the usual tranquillity, as well  as of the happiness, of that kingdom.[*]         * Sir Simon d'Ewes's Journ. p. 81.    This subject, though extremely interesting to the nation, was very  little agreeable to the queen; and she was sensible that great  difficulties would attend every decision. A declaration in favor of the  queen of Scots would form a settlement perfectly legal; because that  princess was commonly allowed to possess the right of blood; and the  exclusion given by Henry's will, deriving its weight chiefly from an  act of parliament, would lose all authority whenever the queen and  parliament had made a new settlement, and restored the Scottish line to  its place in the succession. But she dreaded giving encouragement to  the Catholics, her secret enemies, by this declaration. She was sensible  that every heir was, in some degree, a rival; much more one who enjoyed  a claim for the present possession of the crown, and who had already  advanced, in a very open manner, these dangerous pretensions. The great  power of Mary, both from the favor of the Catholic princes, and her  connections with the house of Guise, not to mention the force and  situation of Scotland, was well known to her; and she saw no security,  that this princess, if fortified by a sure prospect of succession, would  not revive claims which she could never yet be prevailed on formally  to relinquish. On the other hand, the title of the house of Suffolk was  supported by the more zealous Protestants only; and it was very doubtful  whether even a parliamentary declaration in its favor would bestow on it  such validity as to give satisfaction to the people.

Their sudden profulgation  prevented them from bringing their pretensions to a full conclusion.    When Charles opened this session, he had foreseen that the same  controversy would arise; and he therefore took care very early, among  many mild and reconciling expressions, to inform the commons, \"That  he had not taken these duties as appertaining to his hereditary  prerogative; but that it ever was, and still is, his meaning to enjoy  them as a gift of his people: and that, if he had hitherto levied  tonnage and poundage he pretended to justify himself only by the  necessity of so doing, not by any right which he assumed.\"[*]         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 644 Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 256,       346.    This concession, which probably arose from the king's moderate temper,  now freed from the impulse of Buckingham's violent counsels, might have  satisfied the commons, had they entertained no other view than that of  ascertaining their own powers and privileges. But they carried their  pretensions much higher. They insisted, as a necessary preliminary, that  the king should once entirely desist from levying these duties; after  which they were to take it into consideration, how far they would  restore, him to the possession of a revenue of which he had clearly  divested himself. But, besides that this extreme rigor had never  been exercised towards any of his predecessors, and many obvious  inconveniencies must follow from the intermission of the customs, there  were other reasons which deterred Charles from complying with so hard  a condition. It was probable, that the commons might renew their former  project of making this revenue only temporary, and thereby reducing  their prince to perpetual dependence; they certainly would cut off the  new impositions which Mary and Elizabeth, but especially James, had  levied, and which formed no despicable part of the public revenue:  and they openly declared, that they had at present many important  pretensions, chiefly with regard to religion; and if compliance were  refused, no supply must be expected from the commons.    It is easy to see in what an inextricable labyrinth Charles was now  involved. By his own concessions, by the general principles of the  English government, and by the form of every bill which had granted this  duty, tonnage and poundage was derived entirely from the free gift of  the people; and, consequently, might be withdrawn at their pleasure. If  unreasonable in their refusal, they still refused nothing but what was  their own. If public necessity required this supply, it might be thought  also to require the king's compliance with those conditions which were  the price of obtaining it. Though the motive for granting it had been  the enabling of the king to guard the seas, it did not follow, that  because he guarded the seas, he was therefore entitled to this revenue  without further formality: since the people had still reserved to  themselves the right of judging how far that service merited such a  supply. But Charles, notwithstanding his public declaration, was  far from assenting to this conclusion in its full extent. The plain  consequence, he saw, of all these rigors, and refinements, and  inferences, was, that he, without any public necessity, and without any  fault of his own, must of a sudden, even from his accession, become a  magistrate of a very different nature from any of his predecessors, and  must fall into a total dependence on subjects over whom former kings,  especially those immediately preceding, had exercised an authority  almost unlimited. Entangled in a chain of consequences which he could  not easily break, he was inclined to go higher, and rather deny the  first principle, than admit of conclusions which to him appeared so  absurd and unreasonable. Agree-* to the ideas hitherto entertained both  by natives and foreigners, the monarch he esteemed the essence and  soul of the English government: and whatever other power pretended to  annihilate or even abridge, the royal authority, must necessarily, he  thought, either in its nature or exercise, be deemed no better than a  usurpation. Willing to preserve the ancient harmony of the constitution,  he had ever intended to comply as far as he easily could, with the  ancient forms of administration; but when these forms appeared to him,  by the inveterate obstinacy of the commons, to have no other tendency  than to disturb that harmony, and to introduce a new constitution, he  concluded that, in this violent situation, what was subordinate must  necessarily yield to what was principal, and the privileges of the  people, for a time, give place to royal prerogative. From the rank of  a monarch, to be degraded into a slave of his insolent, ungrateful  subjects, seemed of all indignities the greatest; and nothing, in his  judgment, could exceed the humiliation attending such a state, but the  meanness of tamely submitting to it, without making some efforts to  preserve the authority transmitted to him by his predecessors.    Though these were the king's reflections and resolutions before the  parliament assembled, he did not immediately break with them upon their  delay in voting him this supply. He thought that he could better justify  any strong measure which he might afterwards be obliged to take, if he  allowed them to carry to the utmost extremities their attacks upon his  government and prerogative.[*] He contented himself, for the present,  with soliciting the house by messages and speeches. But the commons,  instead of hearkening to his solicitations proceeded to carry their  scrutiny into his management of religion,[**] which was the only  grievance to which, in their opinion, they had not as yet, by their  petition of right, applied a sufficient remedy.         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 642.         ** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 651. Whitlocke, p. 12.    It was not possible that this century, so fertile in religious sects  and disputes, could escape the controversy concerning fatalism and free  will, which, being strongly interwoven both with philosophy and theology  had, in all ages, thrown every school and every church into such  inextricable doubt and perplexity. The first reformers in England, as  in other European countries, had embraced the most rigid tenets of  predestination and absolute decrees, and had composed upon that, system  all the articles of their religious creed. But these principles having  met with opposition from Arminius and his sectaries, the controversy  was soon brought into this island and began here to diffuse itself. The  Arminians, finding more encouragement from the superstitious spirit  of the church than from the fanaticism of the Puritans, gradually  incorporated themselves with the former; and some of that sect, by the  indulgence of James and Charles, had attained the highest preferments in  the hierarchy. But their success with the public had not been altogether  answerable to that which they met with in the church and the court.  Throughout the nation, they still lay under the reproach of innovation  and heresy. The commons now levelled against them their formidable  censures, and made them the objects of daily invective and declamation.  Their protectors were stigmatized; their tenets canvassed; their views  represented as dangerous and pernicious. To impartial spectators surely,  if any such had been at that time in England, it must have given great  entertainment to see a popular assembly, inflamed with faction  and enthusiasm, pretend to discuss questions to which the greatest  philosophers, in the tranquillity of retreat, had never hitherto been  able to find any satisfactory solution.    Amidst that complication of disputes in which men were then involved,  we may observe, that the appellation \"Puritan\" stood for three parties,  which, though commonly united, were yet actuated by very different  views and motives. There were the political Puritans, who maintained  the highest principles of civil liberty; the Puritans in discipline, who  were averse to the ceremonies and Episcopal government of the church;  and the doctrinal Puritans, who rigidly defended the speculative system  of the first reformers. In opposition to all these stood the court  party, the hierarchy, and the Arminians; only with this distinction,  that the latter sect, being introduced a few years before, did not  as yet comprehend all those who were favorable to the church and to  monarchy. But, as the controversies on every subject grew daily warmer,  men united themselves more intimately with their friends, and separated  themselves wider from their antagonists; and the distinction gradually  became quite uniform and regular.    This house of commons, which, like all the preceding, during the reigns  of James and Charles, and even of Elizabeth, was much governed by the  Puritanical party, thought that they could not better serve their cause  than by branding and punishing the Arminian sect, which, introducing an  innovation in the church, were the least favored and least powerful of  all their antagonists. From this measure, it was easily foreseen, that,  besides gratifying the animosity of the doctrinal Puritans, both the  Puritans in discipline and those in politics would reap considerable  advantages. Laud, Neile, Montague, and other bishops, who were the chief  supporters of Episcopal government, and the most zealous partisans of  the discipline and ceremonies of the church, were all supposed to be  tainted with Arminianism. The same men and their disciples were the  strenuous preachers of passive obedience, and of entire submission to  princes; and if these could once be censured, and be expelled the church  and court, it was concluded, that the hierarchy would receive a mortal  blow, the ceremonies be less rigidly insisted on, and"]]]
