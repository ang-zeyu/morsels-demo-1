But it  refers to inequality of proportion: because the angels, even the  lowest, have every perfection of Happiness that they ever will have,  whereas the separated souls of the saints have not.  ________________________    SIXTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 4, Art. 6]    Whether Perfection of the Body Is Necessary for Happiness?    Objection 1: It would seem that perfection of the body is not  necessary for man's perfect Happiness. For perfection of the body is  a bodily good. But it has been shown above (Q. 2) that Happiness does  not consist in bodily goods. Therefore no perfect disposition of the  body is necessary for man's Happiness.    Obj. 2: Further, man's Happiness consists in the vision of the Divine  Essence, as shown above (Q. 3, A. 8). But the body has no part in  this operation, as shown above (A. 5). Therefore no disposition of  the body is necessary for Happiness.    Obj. 3: Further, the more the intellect is abstracted from the body,  the more perfectly it understands. But Happiness consists in the most  perfect operation of the intellect. Therefore the soul should be  abstracted from the body in every way. Therefore, in no way is a  disposition of the body necessary for Happiness.    _On the contrary,_ Happiness is the reward of virtue; wherefore it is  written (John 13:17): \"You shall be blessed, if you do them.\" But the  reward promised to the saints is not only that they shall see and  enjoy God, but also that their bodies shall be well-disposed; for it  is written (Isa. 66:14): \"You shall see and your heart shall rejoice,  and your bones shall flourish like a herb.\" Therefore good  disposition of the body is necessary for Happiness.    _I answer that,_ If we speak of that happiness which man can acquire  in this life, it is evident that a well-disposed body is of necessity  required for it. For this happiness consists, according to the  Philosopher (Ethic. i, 13) in \"an operation according to perfect  virtue\"; and it is clear that man can be hindered, by indisposition  of the body, from every operation of virtue.    But speaking of perfect Happiness, some have maintained that no  disposition of body is necessary for Happiness; indeed, that it is  necessary for the soul to be entirely separated from the body. Hence  Augustine (De Civ. Dei xxii, 26) quotes the words of Porphyry who said  that \"for the soul to be happy, it must be severed from everything  corporeal.\" But this is unreasonable. For since it is natural to the  soul to be united to the body; it is not possible for the perfection  of the soul to exclude its natural perfection.    Consequently, we must say that perfect disposition of the body is  necessary, both antecedently and consequently, for that Happiness  which is in all ways perfect. Antecedently, because, as Augustine  says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 35), \"if the body be such, that the  governance thereof is difficult and burdensome, like unto flesh which  is corruptible and weighs upon the soul, the mind is turned away from  that vision of the highest heaven.\" Whence he concludes that, \"when  this body will no longer be 'natural,' but 'spiritual,' then will it  be equalled to the angels, and that will be its glory, which  erstwhile was its burden.\" Consequently, because from the Happiness  of the soul there will be an overflow on to the body, so that this  too will obtain its perfection. Hence Augustine says (Ep. ad  Dioscor.) that \"God gave the soul such a powerful nature that from  its exceeding fulness of happiness the vigor of incorruption  overflows into the lower nature.\"    Reply Obj. 1: Happiness does not consist in bodily good as its  object: but bodily good can add a certain charm and perfection to  Happiness.    Reply Obj. 2: Although the body has no part in that operation of the  intellect whereby the Essence of God is seen, yet it might prove a  hindrance thereto. Consequently, perfection of the body is necessary,  lest it hinder the mind from being lifted up.    Reply Obj. 3: The perfect operation of the intellect requires indeed  that the intellect be abstracted from this corruptible body which  weighs upon the soul; but not from the spiritual body, which will be  wholly subject to the spirit. On this point we shall treat in the  Third Part of this work (Suppl., Q. 82, seqq.).  ________________________    SEVENTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 4, Art. 7]    Whether Any External Goods Are Necessary for Happiness?    Objection 1: It would seem that external goods also are necessary for  Happiness. For that which is promised the saints for reward, belongs  to Happiness. But external goods are promised the saints; for  instance, food and drink, wealth and a kingdom: for it is said (Luke  22:30): \"That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom\": and  (Matt. 6:20): \"Lay up to yourselves treasures in heaven\": and (Matt.  25:34): \"Come, ye blessed of My Father, possess you the kingdom.\"  Therefore external goods are necessary for Happiness.    Obj. 2: Further, according to Boethius (De Consol. iii): happiness is  \"a state made perfect by the aggregate of all good things.\" But some  of man's goods are external, although they be of least account, as  Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19). Therefore they too are  necessary for Happiness.    Obj. 3: Further, Our Lord said (Matt. 5:12): \"Your reward is very  great in heaven.\" But to be in heaven implies being in a place.  Therefore at least external place is necessary for Happiness.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Ps. 72:25): \"For what have I in  heaven? and besides Thee what do I desire upon earth?\" As though to  say: \"I desire nothing but this, \"--\"It is good for me to adhere to my  God.\" Therefore nothing further external is necessary for Happiness.    _I answer that,_ For imperfect happiness, such as can be had in this  life, external goods are necessary, not as belonging to the essence  of happiness, but by serving as instruments to happiness, which  consists in an operation of virtue, as stated in _Ethic._ i, 13. For  man needs in this life, the necessaries of the body, both for the  operation of contemplative virtue, and for the operation of active  virtue, for which latter he needs also many other things by means of  which to perform its operations.    On the other hand, such goods as these are nowise necessary for  perfect Happiness, which consists in seeing God. The reason of this is  that all suchlike external goods are requisite either for the support  of the animal body; or for certain operations which belong to human  life, which we perform by means of the animal body: whereas that  perfect Happiness which consists in seeing God, will be either in the  soul separated from the body, or in the soul united to the body then  no longer animal but spiritual. Consequently these external goods are  nowise necessary for that Happiness, since they are ordained to the  animal life. And since, in this life, the felicity of contemplation,  as being more Godlike, approaches nearer than that of action to the  likeness of that perfect Happiness, therefore it stands in less need  of these goods of the body as stated in _Ethic._ x, 8.    Reply Obj. 1: All those material promises contained in Holy  Scripture, are to be understood metaphorically, inasmuch as Scripture  is wont to express spiritual things under the form of things  corporeal, in order \"that from things we know, we may rise to the  desire of things unknown,\" as Gregory says (Hom. xi in Evang.). Thus  food and drink signify the delight of Happiness; wealth, the  sufficiency of God for man; the kingdom, the lifting up of man to  union of God.    Reply Obj. 2: These goods that serve for the animal life, are  incompatible with that spiritual life wherein perfect Happiness  consists. Nevertheless in that Happiness there will be the aggregate  of all good things, because whatever good there be in these things, we  shall possess it all in the Supreme Fount of goodness.    Reply Obj. 3: According to Augustine (De Serm. Dom. in Monte  i, 5), it is not material heaven that is described as the reward of  the saints, but a heaven raised on the height of spiritual goods.  Nevertheless a bodily place, viz. the empyrean heaven, will be  appointed to the Blessed, not as a need of Happiness, but by reason of  a certain fitness and adornment.  ________________________    EIGHTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 4, Art. 8]    Whether the Fellowship of Friends Is Necessary for Happiness?    Objection 1: It would seem that friends are necessary for Happiness.  For future Happiness is frequently designated by Scripture under the  name of \"glory.\" But glory consists in man's good being brought to the  notice of many. Therefore the fellowship of friends is necessary for  Happiness.    Obj. 2: Further, Boethius [*Seneca, Ep. 6] says that \"there is no  delight in possessing any good whatever, without someone to share it  with us.\" But delight is necessary for Happiness. Therefore fellowship  of friends is also necessary.    Obj. 3: Further, charity is perfected in Happiness. But charity  includes the love of God and of our neighbor. Therefore it seems that  fellowship of friends is necessary for Happiness.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Wis. 7:11): \"All good things came to  me together with her,\" i.e. with divine wisdom, which consists in  contemplating God. Consequently nothing else is necessary for  Happiness.    _I answer that,_ If we speak of the happiness of this life, the happy  man needs friends, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. ix, 9), not,  indeed, to make use of them, since he suffices himself; nor to  delight in them, since he possesses perfect delight in the operation  of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17910"],[0,"The Mafulu: Mountain People of British New Guinea (#14)"],[1,"and utensils of  daily life. These are sometimes uncoloured and sometimes coloured. (5)  There are the very small charm bags, only about 2 inches or a trifle  more square, which are used by both men and women (I think only the  married ones) for carrying charms, and are worn hanging like lockets  from the neck. They are sometimes coloured.    Plate 53 gives illustrations of three of these bags--Fig. 1 being a  woman's ornamented bag No. 3, and Fig. 2 being a man's ornamented bag  No. 4; but this last-mentioned bag is rather a large one of its type,  the usual difference in size between Nos. 3 and 4 being greater than  the two examples figured would suggest. The patterns of both these  bags, and especially of the larger one, are more regular than is  usually the case. The bag shown in Fig. 3 will be dealt with hereafter  under the heading of netting.    As regards women, the carrying of bags, either full or empty, hanging  over their backs is so common that one might almost regard the bag  as an additional article of dress. I may say here in advance of  my observations on netting that the distinctive features of Mafulu  bags, as compared with those made in Mekeo and on the coast, are the  special and peculiar form of netting which is commonly adopted for  some of them and the curious lines of colouring with which they are  often ornamented.    Hammocks are commonly used in the houses and _emone_ for sleeping. [52]  These also are made of network and will be referred to later. The  distinctive feature of network mentioned in relation to bags applies  to these also, but not that of colouring.    Pottery is not made or used in Mafulu.    I may perhaps refer here to what I imagine to be an ancient stone  mortar, which I found at Mafulu, and which I have endeavoured to show  in Fig. 2. A portion of the upper part of the original was broken away,  and I regret that I did not try to sketch it just as it was, instead  of adopting the easier course of following what had been the original  lines. I am also sorry that its great weight made it impossible for me  to bring it down with me to the coast, [53] and that by an oversight  I did not secure a photograph of it. The vessel was well and evenly  shaped. It had perfectly smooth surfaces, without any trace of cutting  or chipping, and must have been made by grinding. It was devoid of any  trace of decoration. Its top external diameter was about 12 inches,  its height, when standing upright on its base, was about 8 inches,  and the thickness of the bowl at the lip  about 1 inch. I was told  that similar things are from time to time found in the district,  generally on the ridges, far away from water. A Mafulu chief said  that the Mafulu name for these things is _idagafe._ The natives have  no knowledge of their origin or past use, the only explanation of the  latter which was suggested being that they were used as looking-glasses  by looking into the scummy surface of the water inside them. [54]    European things. The Mafulu people are now beginning, mainly through  the missionaries of the Sacred Heart, and also through their contact  with Mekeo and other lowland tribes, to get into touch with European  manufactures. Trade beads, knives, axes, plane irons (used by them  in place of stone blades for their adzes), matches and other things  are beginning to find their way directly and indirectly into such of  the villages as are nearest to the opportunities of procuring them  by exchange or labour.      Domestic Animals.    Dogs may occasionally, though only rarely, be seen in the villages,  but these are small black, brownish-black, or black and white dogs  with very bushy tails, and not the yellow dingo dogs which infest  the villages of Mekeo; and even these Mafulu dogs are, I was told,  not truly a Mafulu institution, having been obtained by the people,  I think, only recently from their Kuni neighbours. A tame cockatoo may  also very occasionally be seen, and even, though still more rarely,  a tame hornbill. There are no cocks and hens.    The universal domestic animal of the Mafulu, however, is the pig,  and he is so important to them that he is worthy of notice. These  pigs are \"village\" pigs, which, though naturally identical with \"wild\"  pigs--being, in fact, wild pigs which have been caught alive or their  descendants--have to be distinguished from wild pigs, and especially  so in connection with feasts and ceremonies.    Village pigs are the individual property of the householders who  possess them, there being no system of community or village ownership;  and, when required for feasts and ceremonies, each household has to  provide such pig or pigs as custom requires of it. They are bred in the  villages by their owners, and by them brought up, fed and tended, the  work of feeding and looking after them being the duty of the women. No  distinguishing ownership marks are put upon the pigs, but their owners  know their own pigs, and still more do the pigs know the people who  feed them; so that disputes as to ownership do not arise. The number  of pigs owned by these people is enormous in proportion to the size  of their villages, and I was told that a comparatively small village  will be able at a big feast to provide a number of village pigs much  in excess of what will be produced by one of the big Mekeo villages.    These village pigs often wander away into the bush, and may disappear  from sight for months; but they nevertheless still continue to  be village pigs. If, however, they are not seen or heard of for a  very long time (say six months), they are regarded as having become  wild pigs, and may be caught and appropriated as such. It is usual  with village pigs to clip or shorten their ears and tails, or even  sometimes to remove their eyes, so as to keep them from wandering  into the gardens. [55] But even a village pig thus marked as such  would be regarded as having become a wild pig if it had disappeared  for a very long time.    Village pigs (as distinguished from wild pigs) are, as will be seen  below, never eaten in their own village on ceremonial occasions,  or indeed perhaps at all, being only killed and cut up and given to  the visitors to take away and eat in their own villages.      Etiquette.    These simple people do not appear to have many customs which come  under the heading of etiquette, pure and simple.    A boy must soon, say within a few weeks, after he has received his  perineal band leave the parental home, and go to live in the _emone;_  but this rule only refers to his general life, and does not prohibit  him from ever entering his parents' house. If he receives his band  when he is very young, this rule will not begin to operate until he  is ten or twelve years old. He is in no case under any prohibition  from being in or crossing the village enclosure. A girl is allowed to  enter the _emone_, though she may not sleep there, prior to receiving  her band, but after that she must never enter it.    A young unmarried man, who has arrived at the marriageable age, must  not eat in the presence of women. He can eat in the bush, or inside  the _emone_, but he must not eat on the platform of the _emone_,  where women might see him. There appear to be no other customs  of mutual avoidance, as, for example, that between son-in-law and  mother-in-law, and with reference to other marriage relationships,  such as are found in some of the Solomon Islands, and among various  other primitive races.    Children and unimportant adults must always pass behind a chief,  not in front of him, and when a chief is speaking, everyone else,  old and young, must be silent.    Young men and girls associate and talk freely together in public  among other people, but no young man would go about alone with a girl,  unless he was misconducting himself with her, or wished to do so.    Visiting is purely friendly and social, and there is no personal  system of formal and ceremonial visiting, except as between communities  or villages.    There do not appear to be any forms of physical salutation, but there  are recognised ways in which men address one another on meeting and  parting. If A and B meet in the bush, A may say to B, \"Where do you  come from?\", and B will answer, \"I come from----.\" A may then say,  \"Where are you going to?\", and B will reply to this. Then B may  put similar questions to A, and will be similarly answered. These  questions are not necessarily asked because the questioner is really  anxious for information, but are in the nature of a formality,--the  equivalent of our \"How do you do?\" The system of asking and answering  these questions, though well recognised as a social form, is not  in practice strictly adhered to. Also A, on coming to a village and  finding B there, and wishing to salute him, will call him by name,  and B will then call A by name. Then A will say, \"You are here,\"  and B will reply, \"I am here.\" This form is more strictly carried  out than is the other one. Then when A leaves he will say to B,  \"I am going,\" and B will answer, \"Go.\" Then B will call A by his  name, and A will call B by name, and the formality is finished. If A,  being very friendly with B, comes to his village to see him, on A's  departure B, and probably B's family, will accompany A out of the  village, and will stand watching his departure until he is about to  disappear round the corner of the path; and then they will call out  his name, and he will respond by calling out B's name.    Gestures may perhaps be included under this heading, though there is  apparently but little to be said about the matter. When a question  is asked, an affirmative reply is indicated by nodding the head,  and a negative one by shaking it; and, though I asked if this was  not probably the result of association with people who had been among  white men, I was told that it was not so. A negative answer is also  often expressed by shrugging the shoulders, and a kind of"]]]
