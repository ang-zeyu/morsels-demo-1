On the second terrace of the declivity are ten or twelve graves, two of  which bear the names of Americans who have died in Rome. A portrait  carved in bas-relief, upon one of the slabs, told me, without the  inscription, that one whom I had known was buried beneath. The slightly  rising mound was covered with small violets, half hidden by the grass.  It takes away from the pain with which one stands over the grave of an  acquaintance or a friend, to see the sun lying so warm upon it, and the  flowers springing so profusely and cheerfully. Nature seems to have  cared for those who have died so far from home, binding the earth gently  over them with grass, and decking it with the most delicate flowers. We  descended to the lower enclosure at the foot of the slight declivity.  The first grave here is that of Keats. The inscription runs thus:    \"This grave contains all that was mortal of a young English poet, who,  on his death-bed in the bitterness of his heart at the malicious power  of his enemies, desired these words to be engraved on his tomb: 'Here  lies one whose name was written in water.'\"    He died at Rome in 1821. Every reader knows his history and the cause of  his death. Shelley says, in the preface to his elegy:    \"The savage criticism on his poems, which appeared in the \"Quarterly  Review,\" produced the most violent effect on his susceptible mind; the  agitation thus originated ended in a rupture of a blood-vessel in the  lungs; a rapid consumption ensued, and the succeeding acknowledgments,  from more candid critics, of the true greatness of his powers, were  ineffectual to heal the wound thus wantonly inflicted.\"    Keats was, no doubt, a poet of very uncommon promise. He had all the  wealth of genius within him, but he had not learned, before he was  killed by criticism, the received, and, therefore, the best manner of  producing it for the eye of the world. Had he lived longer, the strength  and richness which break continually through the affected style of  \"Endymion\" and \"Lamia\" and his other poems, must have formed themselves  into some noble monuments of his powers. As it is, there is not a poet  living who could surpass the material of his \"Endymion\"--a poem, with  all its faults, far more full of beauties. But this is not the place for  criticism. He is buried fitly for a poet, and sleeps beyond criticism  now. Peace to his ashes!          EXCURSIONS NEAR ROME[25]    BY CHARLES DICKENS      The excursions in the neighborhood of Rome are charming, and would be  full of interest were it only for the changing views they afford of the  wild Campagna. But every inch of ground in every direction is rich in  associations, and in natural beauties. There is Albano, with its lovely  lake and wooded shore, and with its wine, that certainly has not  improved since the days of Horace, and in these times hardly justifies  his panegyric. There is squalid Tivoli, with the river Anio, diverted  from its course, and plunging down, headlong, some eighty feet in search  of it, with its picturesque Temple of the Sibyl, perched high on a crag;  its minor waterfalls glancing and sparkling in the sun; and one good  cavern yawning darkly, where the river takes a fearful plunge and shoots  on, low down under beetling rocks.    There, too, is the Villa d'Este, deserted and decaying among groves of  melancholy pine and cypress-trees, where it seems to lie in state. Then,  there is Frascati, and, on the steep above it, the ruins of Tusculum,  where Cicero lived, and wrote, and adorned his favorite house (some  fragments of it may yet be seen there), and where Cato was born. We saw  its ruined amphitheater on a gray, dull day, when a shrill March wind  was blowing, and when the scattered stones of the old city lay strewn  about the lonely eminence, as desolate and dead as the ashes of a  long-extinguished fire.    One day we walked out, a little party of three, to Albano, fourteen  miles distant; possest by a great desire to go there by the ancient  Appian Way, long since ruined and overgrown. We started at half-past  seven in the morning, and within an hour or so were out upon the open  Campagna. For twelve miles we went climbing on, over an unbroken  succession of mounds, and heaps, and hills of ruin. Tombs and temples,  overthrown and prostrate; small fragments of columns, friezes,  pediments; great blocks of granite and marble; moldering arches  grass-grown and decayed; ruin enough to build a spacious city from; lay  strewn about us. Sometimes loose walls, built up from these fragments by  the shepherds, came across our path; sometimes a ditch, between two  mounds of broken stones, obstructed our progress; sometimes, the  fragments themselves, rolling from beneath our feet, made it a toilsome  matter to advance; but it was always ruin. Now, we tracked a piece of  the old road above the ground; now traced it underneath a grassy  covering, as if that were its grave; but all the way was ruin.    In the distance, ruined aqueducts went stalking on their giant course  along the plain; and every breath of wind that swept toward us, stirred  early flowers and grasses, springing up, spontaneously, on miles of  ruin. The unseen larks above us, who alone disturbed the awful silence,  had their nests in ruin; and the fierce herdsmen, clad in sheepskins,  who now and then scowled out upon us from their sleeping nooks, were  housed in ruin. The aspect of the desolate Campagna in one direction,  where it was most level, reminded me of an American prairie; but what is  the solitude of a region where men have never dwelt, to that of a  desert, where a mighty race have left their footprints in the earth from  which they have vanished; where the resting-places of their dead have  fallen like their dead; and the broken hour-glass of Time is but a heap  of idle dust! Returning by the road at sunset, and looking, from the  distance, on the course we had taken in the morning, I almost felt (as I  had felt when I first saw it, at that hour) as if the sun would never  rise again, but looked its last, that night, upon a ruined world.    To come again to Rome, by moonlight, after such an expedition, is a  fitting close to such a day. The narrow streets, devoid of footways, and  choked, in every obscure corner, by heaps of dung-hill-rubbish, contrast  so strongly, in their cramped dimensions, and their filth and darkness,  with the broad square before some haughty church; in the center of  which, a hieroglyphic-covered obelisk, brought from Egypt in the days of  the Emperors, looks strangely on the foreign scene about it; or perhaps  an ancient pillar, with its honored statue overthrown, supports a  Christian saint; Marcus Aurelius giving place to Paul, and Trajan to St.  Peter. Then, there are the ponderous buildings reared from the  spoliation of the Coliseum, shutting out the moon, like mountains; while  here and there are broken arches and rent walls, through which it gushes  freely, as the life comes pouring from a wound. The little town of  miserable houses, walled, and shut in by barred gates, is the quarter  where the Jews are locked up nightly, when the clock strikes eight--a  miserable place, densely populated, and reeking with bad odors, but  where the people are industrious and money-getting. In the daytime, as  you make your way along the narrow streets, you see them all at  work--upon the pavement, oftener than in their dark and frowsy shops;  furbishing old clothes, and driving bargains.    Crossing from these patches of thick darkness out into the moon once  more, the fountain of Trevi, welling from a hundred jets, and rolling  over mimic rocks, is silvery to the eye and ear. In the narrow little  throat of street beyond, a booth drest out with flaring lamps, and  boughs of trees, attracts a group of sulky Romans around its smoky  coppers of hot broth, and cauliflower stew; its trays of fried fish, and  its flasks of wine. As you rattle around the sharply twisting corner, a  lumbering sound is heard. The coachman stops abruptly, and uncovers, as  a van comes slowly by, preceded by a man who bears a large cross; by a  torch-bearer, and a priest; the latter chanting as he goes. It is the  dead-cart, with the bodies of the poor, on their way to burial in the  Sacred Field outside the walls, where they will be thrown into the pit  that will be covered with a stone to-night, and sealed up for a year.    But whether, in this ride, you pass by obelisks, or columns, ancient  temples, theaters, houses, porticoes or forums, it is strange to see how  every fragment, whenever it is possible, has been blended into some  modern structure, and made to serve some modern purpose--a wall, a  dwelling-place, a granary, a stable--some use for which it never was  designed, and associated with which it can not otherwise than lamely  assort.          II    FLORENCE      THE APPROACH BY CARRIAGE ROAD[26]    BY NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE      Immediately after leaving Incisa, we saw the Arno, already a  considerable river, rushing between deep banks, with the greenish hue of  a duck-pond diffused through its water. Nevertheless, tho the first  impression was not altogether agreeable, we soon became reconciled to  this hue, and ceased to think it an indication of impurity; for, in  spite of it, the river is still, to a certain degree, transparent, and  is, at any rate, a mountain stream, and comes uncontaminated from its  source. The pure, transparent brown of the New England rivers is the  most beautiful color; but I am content that it should be peculiar to  them.    Our afternoon's drive was through scenery less striking than some which  we had traversed, but still picturesque and beautiful. We saw deep  valleys and ravines, with streams at the bottom; long, wooded hillsides,  rising far and high, and dotted with white dwellings, well toward the  summits. By and by, we had a distant glimpse of Florence,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18846"],[0,"Voodoo Planet (#14)"],[1,"out. Two of  the off-worlder poachers were dead. The other and the spaceman were  prisoners, while Nymani rounded up in addition the man Dane had burned  to save Tau. When the younger spaceman returned from making the medic  comfortable in the shelter, he found Asaki and Jellico holding an  impromptu court of inquiry.    The dazed native Hunters had been expertly looped together by Nymani  and, a little apart from them, the off-worlders were under examination.    \"An I-C man, eh?\" Jellico, smoothing a mud-spattered chin with a grimed  hand, regarded the latest arrival measuringly. \"Trying to run in and  break a Combine charter, were you? You'd better spill the facts; your  own head office will disown you, you ought to know that. They never back  any failures in these undercover deals.\"    \"I want medical attention,\" snapped the other, cradling his seared hand  to his chest. \"Or do you plan to turn me over to these savages?\"    \"Seeing as how you tried to blast our medic,\" replied the captain with a  grin which was close to shark-like, \"he may not feel much like patching  up those fingers of yours. Stick 'em in where they have no business, and  they're apt to get burned. At any rate he's not going to look at 'em  until he's had a chance to rest. I'll give you first aid. And while I'm  working we'll talk. I-C going into the poaching trade now? That news is  going to please Combine; they have no use for you boys anyway.\"    His answer was lurid and uninformative. But the uniform tunic the other  wore could not be so easily explained away. Dane, worn out, stretched  his aching length on a pile of mats and lost all interest in the  argument.           *       *       *       *       *    Two days later they stood once more on the same terrace where Lumbrilo  had wrought his magic and met his first defeat. This time no lightning  played along the mountain ridges and the blaze of the sun was so bright  and clear that one could hardly believe in the fantastic happenings of  that swamp clearing where men had fought with weapons not made by hands.  The three from the _Queen_ moved away from the parapet to meet the Chief  Ranger as he came down the stairs.    \"A messenger has just arrived. The hunter was hunted indeed, and his  going was witnessed by many--though they did not see those which hunted  him. Lumbrilo is dead; he came to his end by the Great River.\"    Jellico started. \"But that is almost fifty miles from the swamp, on this  side of the mountain!\"    \"He was hunted and he fled--as you promised,\" Asaki said to Tau. \"You  made strong magic, off-world man.\"    The medic shook his head slowly. \"I but turned his own methods against  him. Because he believed in his power, that same power, reflected back,  broke him. Had I been facing one who did not believe....\" He shrugged.  \"Our first meeting set the pattern. From that moment he feared a little  that I could match him, and his uncertainty pierced a hole in his  armor.\"    \"Why on earth did you want 'Terra Bound?'\" burst out Dane, still seeking  an explanation for that one small mystery among the others.    Tau chuckled. \"In the first place, that blasted tune has haunted us all  for so long that I knew its rhythm was probably the one you could keep  to without hardly knowing that you were beating it out. And, in the  second place, its alien pattern was a part of our particular background,  to counteract Lumbrilo's native Khatkan music, which was certainly a big  factor in _his_ stage setting. He must have believed that we would not  find out about the drugged water and so would be prepared for any  fantasy he cared to produce. When they saw us coming out over the swamp  they counted us easy takings. His practice had always been with  Khatkans, and he judged us by their reactions to stimuli he knew well  how to use. So he failed....\"    Asaki smiled. \"Which was good for Khatka but ill for Lumbrilo and those  using him to make mischief here. The poacher and the outlaw Hunters will  meet with our justice, which I do not believe they will relish. But the  other two, the spaceman and the company agent, are to be sent to Xecho  to face Combine authorities. It is my thought that those will not accept  kindly the meddling of another company in their territory.\"    Jellico grunted. \"Kindness and Combine are widely separated in such  matters. But we can now take passage on the same ship as your  prisoners--\"    \"But, my friend, you have not yet seen the preserve. I assure you that  _this_ time there shall be no trouble. We have several days yet before  you must return to your ship--\"    The captain of the _Queen_ held up his hand. \"Nothing would give me  greater pleasure than to inspect the Zoboru preserve, sir--next year. As  it is, my holiday is over and the _Queen_ is waiting for us on Xecho.  Also, permit me to send you some tapes dealing with the newest types of  flitters--guaranteed against flight failures.\"    \"Yes, guaranteed,\" Tau added guilelessly, \"not to break down, lose  course, or otherwise disrupt a pleasant excursion.\"    The Chief Ranger threw back his head and his deep-chested laughter was  echoed from the heights above them. \"Very well, Captain. Your mail run  will bring you back to Xecho at intervals. Meanwhile I shall study your  sales tapes concerning the non-expendable flitters. But you _shall_  visit Zoboru--and pleasantly, very pleasantly, I assure you, Medic Tau!\"    \"I wonder,\" Tau muttered and Dane heard. \"Just now the quiet of deep  space is a far, far more entrancing proposition!\"        +--------------------------------------------------------------+    |                                                              |    | Transcriber's Notes                                          |    |                                                              |    |                                                              |    | One copyright symbol was replaced with \"(c)\".                |    | The repetition \"too too\" and the writing of the word         |    | \"steppingstones\" without hyphen is as in the original.       |    |                                                              |    | The following typos have been corrected.                     |    |                                                              |    | Typo         Correction                                      |    |                                                              |    | breath       breathe                                         |    | an           on                                              |    | Yes. sir!
