The scenery  becomes more romantic and savage at every step as we ascend the winding  path after leaving St. Scholastica, till a small gate admits us to the  famous immemorial Ilex Grove of St. Benedict, which is said to date from  the fifth century, and which has never been profaned by ax or hatchet.  Beyond it the path narrows, and a steep winding stair, just wide enough  to admit one person at a time, leads to the platform before the second  convent, which up to that moment is entirely concealed. Its name, Sacro  Speco, commemorates the holy cave of St. Benedict.    At the portal, the thrilling interest of the place is suggested by the  inscription--\"Here is the patriarchal cradle of the monks of the West  Order of St. Benedict.\" The entrance corridor, built on arches over the  abyss, has frescoes of four sainted popes, and ends in an ante-chamber  with beautiful Umbrian frescoes, and a painted statue of St. Benedict.  Here we enter the all-glorious church of 1116, completely covered with  ancient frescoes. A number of smaller chapels, hewn out of the rock, are  dedicated to the sainted followers of the founder. Some of the paintings  are by the rare Umbrian master Concioli. A staircase in front of the  high altar leads to the lower church. At the foot of the first flight of  steps, above the charter of 1213, setting forth all its privileges, is  the frescoed figure of Innocent III., who first raised Subiaco into an  abbacy; in the same fresco is represented Abbot John of Tagliacozzo,  under whom (1217-1277) many of the paintings were executed.    On the second landing, the figure of Benedict faces us on a window with  his finger on his lips, imposing silence. On the left is the coro, on  the right the cave where Benedict is said to have passed three years in  darkness. A statue by Raggi commemorates his presence here; a basket is  a memorial of that lowered with his food by St. Romanus; an ancient bell  is shown as that which rang to announce its approach. As we descend the  Scala Santa trodden by the feet of Benedict, and ascended by the monks  upon their knees, the solemn beauty of the place increases at every  step. On the right is a powerful fresco of Death mowing down the young  and sparing the old; on the left, the Preacher shows the young and  thoughtless the three states to which the body is reduced after death.  Lastly, we reach the Holy of Holies, the second cave, in which Benedict  laid down the rule of his order, making its basis the twelve degrees of  humility. Here also an inscription enumerates the wonderful series of  saints, who, issuing from Subiaco, founded the Benedictine Order  throughout the world.          ETRUSCAN VOLTERRA[32]    BY WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT      For several miles before reaching Volterra, our attention was fixt by  the extraordinary aspect of the country through which we were passing.  The road gradually ascended, and we found ourselves among deep ravines  and steep, high, broken banks, principally of clay, barren, and in most  places wholly bare of herbage, a scene of complete desolation, were it  not for a cottage here and there perched upon the heights, a few sheep  attended by a boy and a dog grazing on the brink of one of the  precipices, or a solitary patch of bright green wheat in some spot where  the rains had not yet carried away the vegetable mold.    In the midst of this desolate tract, which is, however, here and there  interspersed with fertile spots, rises the mountain on which Volterra is  situated, where the inhabitants breathe a pure and keen atmosphere,  almost perpetually cool, and only die of pleurisies and apoplexies;  while below, on the banks of the Cecina, which in full sight winds its  way to the sea, they die of fevers. One of the ravines of which I have  spoken--the \"balza,\" they call it at Volterra--has plowed a deep chasm  on the north side of this mountain, and is every year rapidly  approaching the city on its summit. I stood on its edge and looked down  a bank of soft, red earth five hundred feet in height. A few rods in  front of me I saw where a road had crossed the spot in which the gulf  now yawned; the tracks of the last year's carriages were seen reaching  to the edge on both sides. The ruins of a convent were close at hand,  the inmates of which, two or three years since, had been removed by the  Government to the town for safety....    The antiquities of Volterra consist of an Etruscan burial-ground, in  which the tombs still remain, pieces of the old and incredibly massive  Etruscan wall, including a far larger circuit than the present city, two  Etruscan gates of immemorial antiquity, older, doubtless, than any thing  at Rome, built of enormous stones, one of them serving even yet as an  entrance to the town, and a multitude of cinerary vessels, mostly of  alabaster, sculptured with numerous figures in \"alto relievo.\" These  figures are sometimes allegorical representations, and sometimes embody  the fables of the Greek mythology. Among them are many in the most  perfect style of Grecian art, the subjects of which are taken from the  poems of Homer; groups representing the besiegers of Troy and its  defenders, or Ulysses with his companions and his ships. I gazed with  exceeding delight on these works of forgotten artists, who had the  verses of Homer by heart--works just drawn from the tombs where they had  been buried for thousands of years, and looking as if fresh from the  chisel.          THE PAESTUM OF THE GREEKS[33]    BY EDWARD A. FREEMAN      Few buildings are more familiar than the temples of Paestum; yet the  moment when the traveler first comes in sight of works of untouched  Hellenic skill is one which is simply overwhelming. Suddenly, by the  side of a dreary road, in a spot backed indeed by noble mountains, but  having no charm of its own, we come on these works, unrivaled on our  side of the Hadriatic and the Messenian strait, standing in all their  solitary grandeur, shattered indeed, but far more perfect than the mass  of ruined buildings of later days. The feeling of being brought near to  Hellenic days and Hellenic men, of standing face to face with the  fathers of the world's civilization, is one which can never pass away.  Descriptions, pictures, models, all fail; they give us the outward form;  they can not give us the true life.    The thought comes upon us that we have passed away from that Roman world  out of which our own world has sprung into that earlier and fresher and  brighter world by which Rome and ourselves have been so deeply  influenced, but out of which neither the Roman nor the modern world can  be said to spring. There is the true Doric in its earliest form, in all  its unmixed and simple majesty. The ground is strewed with shells and  covered with acanthus-leaves; but no shell had suggested the Ionic  volute, no acanthus-leaf had suggested the Corinthian foliage. The vast  columns, with the sudden tapering, the overhanging capitals, the stern,  square abacus, all betoken the infancy of art. But it is an infancy like  that of their own Herakles; the strength which clutched the serpent in  his cradle is there in every stone. Later improvements, the improvements  of Attic skill, may have added grace; the perfection of art may be found  in the city which the vote of the divine Assembly decreed to Athene; but  for the sense of power, of simplicity without rudeness, the city of  Poseidon holds her own. Unlike in every detail, there is in these  wonderful works of early Greek art a spirit akin to some of the great  churches of Romanesque date, simple, massive, unadorned, like the  Poseidonian Doric.    And they show, too, how far the ancient architects were from any slavish  bondage to those minute rules which moderns have invented for them. In  each of the three temples of Paestum differences both of detail and of  arrangement may be marked, differences partly of age, but also partly of  taste. And some other thoughts are brought forcibly upon the mind. Here  indeed we feel that the wonders of Hellenic architecture are things to  kindle our admiration, even our reverence; but that, as the expression  of a state of things which has wholly passed away, nothing can be less  fit for reproduction in modern times.    And again, we may be sure that the admiration and reverence which they  may awaken in the mind of the mere classical purist is cold beside that  which they kindle in the mind which can give them their true place in  the history of art. The temples of Paestum are great and noble from any  point of view. But they become greater and nobler as we run over the  successive steps in the long series by which their massive columns and  entablatures grew into the tall clusters and soaring arches of  Westminster and Amiens.          VII    SICILIAN SCENES          PALERMO[34]    BY WILL S. MONROE      While not one of the original Hellenic city-states, Palermo has a superb  location on the northern shores of the central island of the central  sea; its harbor is guarded by the two picturesque cliffs and the fertile  plain that forms the \"compagne\" is hemmed in by a semicircular cord of  rugged mountains. \"Perhaps there are few spots upon the surface of the  globe more beautiful than Palermo,\" writes Arthur Symonds. \"The hills on  either hand descend upon the sea with long-drawn delicately broken  outlines, so delicately tinted with aerial hues at early dawn or beneath  the blue light of a full moon the panorama seems to be some fabric of  fancy, that must fade away, 'like shapes of clouds we form,' to nothing.  Within the cradle of these hills, and close upon the tideless water,  lies the city. Behind and around on every side stretches the famous  Conco d'Oro, or golden shell, a plain of marvelous fertility, so called  because of its richness and also because of its shape; for it tapers to  a fine point where the mountains meet, and spreads abroad, where they  diverge, like a cornucopia."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068"],[0,"Household Stories (#14)"],[1,"that she began to wish for some; and at  length she longed for it greatly. This went on for days, and as she knew  she could not get the rampion, she pined away, and grew pale and  miserable. Then the man was uneasy, and asked, \"What is the matter, dear  wife?\"    \"Oh,\" answered she, \"I shall die unless I can have some of that rampion  to eat that grows in the garden at the back of our house.\" The man, who  loved her very much, thought to himself,    \"Rather than lose my wife I will get some rampion, cost what it will.\"    [Illustration: RAPUNZEL        \"O RAPUNZEL, RAPUNZEL!      LET DOWN THINE HAIR.\"]    So in the twilight he climbed over the wall into the witch's garden,  plucked hastily a handful of rampion and brought it to his wife. She  made a salad of it at once, and ate of it to her heart's content. But  she liked it so much, and it tasted so good, that the next day she  longed for it thrice as much as she had done before; if she was to  have any rest the man must climb over the wall once more. So he went in  the twilight again; and as he was climbing back, he saw, all at once,  the witch standing before him, and was terribly frightened, as she  cried, with angry eyes,    \"How dare you climb over into my garden like a thief, and steal my  rampion! it shall be the worse for you!\"    \"Oh,\" answered he, \"be merciful rather than just, I have only done it  through necessity; for my wife saw your rampion out of the window, and  became possessed with so great a longing that she would have died if she  could not have had some to eat.\" Then the witch said,    \"If it is all as you say you may have as much rampion as you like, on  one condition--the child that will come into the world must be given to  me. It shall go well with the child, and I will care for it like a  mother.\"    In his distress of mind the man promised everything; and when the time  came when the child was born the witch appeared, and, giving the child  the name of Rapunzel (which is the same as rampion), she took it away  with her.    Rapunzel was the most beautiful child in the world. When she was twelve  years old the witch shut her up in a tower in the midst of a wood, and  it had neither steps nor door, only a small window above. When the witch  wished to be let in, she would stand below and would cry,    \"Rapunzel, Rapunzel! let down your hair!\"    Rapunzel had beautiful long hair that shone like gold. When she heard  the voice of the witch she would undo the fastening of the upper window,  unbind the plaits of her hair, and let it down twenty ells below, and  the witch would climb up by it.    After they had lived thus a few years it happened that as the King's son  was riding through the wood, he came to the tower; and as he drew near  he heard a voice singing so sweetly that he stood still and listened. It  was Rapunzel in her loneliness trying to pass away the time with sweet  songs. The King's son wished to go in to her, and sought to find a door  in the tower, but there was none. So he rode home, but the song had  entered into his heart, and every day he went into the wood and listened  to it. Once, as he was standing there under a tree, he saw the witch  come up, and listened while she called out,    \"O Rapunzel, Rapunzel! let down your hair.\"    Then he saw how Rapunzel let down her long tresses, and how the witch  climbed up by it and went in to her, and he said to himself,    \"Since that is the ladder I will climb it, and seek my fortune.\" And the  next day, as soon as it began to grow dusk, he went to the tower and  cried,    \"O Rapunzel, Rapunzel! let down your hair.\"    And she let down her hair, and the King's son climbed up by it.    Rapunzel was greatly terrified when she saw that a man had come in to  her, for she had never seen one before; but the King's son began  speaking so kindly to her, and told how her singing had entered into his  heart, so that he could have no peace until he had seen her herself.  Then Rapunzel forgot her terror, and when he asked her to take him for  her husband, and she saw that he was young and beautiful, she thought to  herself,    \"I certainly like him much better than old mother Gothel,\" and she put  her hand into his hand, saying,    \"I would willingly go with thee, but I do not know how I shall get out.  When thou comest, bring each time a silken rope, and I will make a  ladder, and when it is quite ready I will get down by it out of the  tower, and thou shalt take me away on thy horse.\" They agreed that he  should come to her every evening, as the old woman came in the day-time.  So the witch knew nothing of all this until once Rapunzel said to her  unwittingly,    \"Mother Gothel, how is it that you climb up here so slowly, and the  King's son is with me in a moment?\"    \"O wicked child,\" cried the witch, \"what is this I hear! I thought I had  hidden thee from all the world, and thou hast betrayed me!\"    In her anger she seized Rapunzel by her beautiful hair, struck her  several times with her left hand, and then grasping a pair of shears in  her right--snip, snap--the beautiful locks lay on the ground. And she  was so hard-hearted that she took Rapunzel and put her in a waste and  desert place, where she lived in great woe and misery.    The same day on which she took Rapunzel away she went back to the tower  in the evening and made fast the severed locks of hair to the  window-hasp, and the King's son came and cried,    \"Rapunzel, Rapunzel! let down your hair.\"    Then she let the hair down, and the King's son climbed up, but instead  of his dearest Rapunzel he found the witch looking at him with wicked  glittering eyes.    \"Aha!\" cried she, mocking him, \"you came for your darling, but the sweet  bird sits no longer in the nest, and sings no more; the cat has got her,  and will scratch out your eyes as well! Rapunzel is lost to you; you  will see her no more.\"    The King's son was beside himself with grief, and in his agony he sprang  from the tower: he escaped with life, but the thorns on which he fell  put out his eyes. Then he wandered blind through the wood, eating  nothing but roots and berries, and doing nothing but lament and weep for  the loss of his dearest wife.    So he wandered several years in misery until at last he came to the  desert place where Rapunzel lived with her twin-children that she had  borne, a boy and a girl. At first he heard a voice that he thought he  knew, and when he reached the place from which it seemed to come  Rapunzel knew him, and fell on his neck and wept. And when her tears  touched his eyes they became clear again, and he could see with them as  well as ever.    Then he took her to his kingdom, where he was received with great joy,  and there they lived long and happily.          The THREE LITTLE MEN in the WOOD      THERE was once a man, whose wife was dead, and a woman, whose husband  was dead; and the man had a daughter, and so had the woman. The girls  were acquainted with each other, and used to play together sometimes in  the woman's house. So the woman said to the man's daughter,    \"Listen to me, tell your father that I will marry him, and then you  shall have milk to wash in every morning and wine to drink, and my  daughter shall have water to wash in and water to drink.\"    The girl went home and told her father what the woman had said. The man  said,    \"What shall I do! Marriage is a joy, and also a torment.\"    At last, as he could come to no conclusion, he took off his boot, and  said to his daughter,    \"Take this boot, it has a hole in the sole; go up with it into the loft,  hang it on the big nail and pour water in it. If it holds water, I will  once more take to me a wife; if it lets out the water, so will I not.\"    The girl did as she was told, but the water held the hole together, and  the boot was full up to the top. So she went and told her father how it  was. And he went up to see with his own eyes, and as there was no  mistake about it, he went to the widow and courted her, and then they  had the wedding.    The next morning, when the two girls awoke, there stood by the bedside  of the man's daughter milk to wash in and wine to drink, and by the  bedside of the woman's daughter there stood water to wash in and water  to drink.    On the second morning there stood water to wash in and water to drink  for both of them alike. On the third morning there stood water to wash  in and water to drink for the man's daughter, and milk to wash in and  wine to drink for the woman's daughter; and so it remained ever after.  The woman hated her step-daughter, and never knew how to treat her badly  enough from one day to another. And she was jealous because her  step-daughter was pleasant and pretty, and her real daughter was ugly  and hateful.    Once in winter, when it was freezing hard, and snow lay deep on hill and  valley, the woman made a frock out of paper, called her step-daughter,  and said,    \"Here, put on this frock, go out into the wood and fetch me a basket of  strawberries; I have a great wish for some.\"    \"Oh dear,\" said the girl, \"there are no strawberries to be found in  winter; the ground is frozen, and the snow covers everything. And why  should I go in the paper frock? it is so cold out of doors that one's  breath is frozen; the wind will blow through it, and the thorns will  tear it off my back!\"    \"How dare you contradict me!\" cried the step-mother, \"be off, and don't  let me see you again till you bring me a basket of strawberries.\"    Then she gave her a little piece of hard bread, and said,    \"That will do for you to eat during the day,\" and she thought to  herself, \"She is sure to be frozen or starved to death out of doors, and  I shall never set eyes on her again.\"    So the girl went obediently, put on the paper frock, and started out  with the basket. The snow was lying everywhere, far and wide, and there  was not a blade of green to be seen. When she entered the wood she saw a  little house"]]]
