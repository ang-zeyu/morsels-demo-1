But, on  the other hand, if you are in trouble, there is nothing like wings for  getting you out of it.    This was the case in the matter of the fierce dog who sprang out at them  when they had folded up their wings as small as possible and were going  up to a farm door to ask for a crust of bread and cheese, for in  spite of the plums they were soon just as hungry as ever again.    Now there is no doubt whatever that, if the four had been ordinary  wingless children, that black and fierce dog would have had a good bite  out of the brown-stockinged leg of Robert, who was the nearest. But at  its first growl there was a flutter of wings, and the dog was left to  strain at his chain and stand on his hind-legs as if he were trying to  fly too.    They tried several other farms, but at those where there were no dogs  the people were far too frightened to do anything but scream; and at  last, when it was nearly four o'clock, and their wings were getting  miserably stiff and tired, they alighted on a church-tower and held a  council of war.    \"We can't possibly fly all the way home without dinner _or_ tea,\" said  Robert with desperate decision.    \"And nobody will give us any dinner, or even lunch, let alone tea,\" said  Cyril.    \"Perhaps the clergyman here might,\" suggested Anthea. \"He must know all  about angels\"--    \"Anybody could see we're not that,\" said Jane. \"Look at Robert's boots  and Squirrel's plaid necktie.\"    \"Well,\" said Cyril firmly, \"if the country you're in won't _sell_  provisions, you _take_ them. In wars I mean. I'm quite certain you do.  And even in other stories no good brother would allow his little sisters  to starve in the midst of plenty.\"    \"Plenty?\" repeated Robert hungrily; and the others looked vaguely round  the bare leads of the church-tower, and murmured, \"In the midst of?\"    \"Yes,\" said Cyril impressively. \"There is a larder window at the side of  the clergyman's house, and I saw things to eat inside--custard pudding  and cold chicken and tongue--and pies--and jam. It's rather a high  window--but with wings\"--    \"How clever of you!\" said Jane.    \"Not at all,\" said Cyril modestly; \"any born general--Napoleon or the  Duke of Marlborough--would have seen it just the same as I did.\"    \"It seems very wrong,\" said Anthea.    \"Nonsense,\" said Cyril. \"What was it Sir Philip Sidney said when the  soldier wouldn't give him a drink?--'My necessity is greater than his.'\"    \"We'll club together our money, though, and leave it to pay for the  things, won't we?\" Anthea was persuasive, and very nearly in tears,  because it is most trying to feel enormously hungry and unspeakably  sinful at one and the same time.    \"Some of it,\" was the cautious reply.    Everyone now turned out its pockets on the lead roof of the tower, where  visitors for the last hundred and fifty years had cut their own and  their sweethearts' initials with penknives in the soft lead. There was  five-and-seven-pence halfpenny altogether, and even the upright Anthea  admitted that that was too much to pay for four people's dinners. Robert  said he thought eighteenpence.    [Illustration: Every one now turned out his pockets]    And half-a-crown was finally agreed to be \"handsome.\"    So Anthea wrote on the back of her last term's report, which happened to  be in her pocket, and from which she first tore her own name and that of  the school, the following letter:--              \"DEAR REVEREND CLERGYMAN,--We are very hungry            indeed because of having to fly all day, and we            think it is not stealing when you are starving to            death. We are afraid to ask you for fear you            should say 'No,' because of course you know about            angels, but you would not think we were angels. We            will only take the necessities of life, and no            pudding or pie, to show you it is not grediness            but true starvation that makes us make your larder            stand and deliver. But we are not highwaymen by            trade.\"    \"Cut it short,\" said the others with one accord. And Anthea hastily  added--              \"Our intentions are quite honourable if you only            knew. And here is half-a-crown to show we are            sinseer and grateful.              \"Thank you for your kind hospitality.                                              \"FROM US FOUR.\"    The half-crown was wrapped in this letter, and all the children felt  that when the clergyman had read it he would understand everything, as  well as anyone could who had not even seen the wings.    \"Now,\" said Cyril, \"of course there's some risk; we'd better fly  straight down the other side of the tower and then flutter low across  the churchyard and in through the shrubbery. There doesn't seem to be  anyone about. But you never know. The window looks out into the  shrubbery. It is embowered in foliage, like a window in a story. I'll go  in and get the things. Robert and Anthea can take them as I hand them  out through the window; and Jane can keep watch,--her eyes are  sharp,--and whistle if she sees anyone about. Shut up, Robert! she can  whistle quite well enough for that, anyway. It ought not to be a very  good whistle--it'll sound more natural and birdlike. Now then--off we  go!\"    I cannot pretend that stealing is right. I can only say that on this  occasion it did not look like stealing to the hungry four, but appeared  in the light of a fair and reasonable business transaction. They had  never happened to learn that a tongue,--hardly cut into,--a chicken and  a half, a loaf of bread, and a syphon of soda-water cannot be bought in  the stores for half-a-crown. These were the necessaries of life, which  Cyril handed out of the larder window when, quite unobserved and without  hindrance or adventure, he had led the others to that happy spot. He  felt that to refrain from jam, apple pie, cake, and mixed candied peel,  was a really heroic act--and I agree with him. He was also proud of not  taking the custard pudding,--and there I think he was wrong,--because if  he had taken it there would have been a difficulty about returning the  dish; no one, however starving, has a right to steal china pie-dishes  with little pink flowers on them. The soda-water syphon was different.  They could not do without something to drink, and as the maker's name  was on it they felt sure it would be returned to him wherever they might  leave it. If they had time they would take it back themselves. The  man appeared to live in Rochester, which would not be much out of their  way home.    [Illustration: These were the necessaries of life]    Everything was carried up to the top of the tower, and laid down on a  sheet of kitchen paper which Cyril had found on the top shelf of the  larder. As he unfolded it, Anthea said, \"I don't think _that's_ a  necessity of life.\"    \"Yes, it is,\" said he. \"We must put the things down somewhere to cut  them up; and I heard father say the other day people got diseases from  germans in rain-water. Now there must be lots of rain-water here,--and  when it dries up the germans are left, and they'd get into the things,  and we should all die of scarlet fever.\"    \"What are germans?\"    \"Little waggly things you see with microscopes,\" said Cyril, with a  scientific air. \"They give you every illness you can think of. I'm sure  the paper was a necessary, just as much as the bread and meat and water.  Now then! Oh, I'm hungry!\"    I do not wish to describe the picnic party on the top of the tower. You  can imagine well enough what it is like to carve a chicken and a tongue  with a knife that has only one blade and that snapped off short about  half-way down. But it was done. Eating with your fingers is greasy and  difficult--and paper dishes soon get to look very spotty and horrid. But  one thing you _can't_ imagine, and that is how soda-water behaves when  you try to drink it straight out of a syphon--especially a quite full  one. But if imagination will not help you, experience will, and you can  easily try it for yourself if you can get a grown-up to give you the  syphon. If you want to have a really thorough experience, put the tube  in your mouth and press the handle very suddenly and very hard. You had  better do it when you are alone--and out of doors is best for this  experiment.    However you eat them, tongue and chicken and new bread are very good  things, and no one minds being sprinkled a little with soda-water on a  really fine hot day. So that everyone enjoyed the dinner very much  indeed, and everyone ate as much as it possibly could: first, because it  was extremely hungry; and secondly, because, as I said, tongue and  chicken and new bread are very nice.    Now, I daresay you will have noticed that if you have to wait for your  dinner till long after the proper time, and then eat a great deal more  dinner than usual, and sit in the hot sun on the top of a  church-tower--or even anywhere else--you become soon and strangely  sleepy. Now Anthea and Jane and Cyril and Robert were very like you in  many ways, and when they had eaten all they could, and drunk all there  was, they became sleepy, strangely and soon--especially Anthea, because  she had gotten up so early.    [Illustration: The children were fast asleep]    One by one they left off talking and leaned back, and before it was a  quarter of an hour after dinner they had all curled round and tucked  themselves up under their large soft warm wings and were fast asleep.  And the sun was sinking slowly in the west. (I must say it was in the  west, because it is usual in books to say so, for fear careless people  should think it was setting in the east. In point of fact, it was not  exactly in the west either--but that's near enough.) The sun, I repeat,  was sinking slowly in the west, and the children slept warmly and  happily on--for wings are cosier than eider-down quilts to sleep under.

In the time of the Ist Dynasty the royal tomb was known by the name of  \"Protection-around-the-Hawk, i.e. the king\"(_Sa-ha-heru_); but under  the Hid and IVth Dynasties regular names, such as \"the Firm,\" \"the  Glorious,\" \"the Appearing,\" etc., were given to each pyramid.    [Illustration: 086.jpg FALSE DOOR OF THE TOMB OF TETA, about 3600 B.C.]    We must not omit to note an interesting point in connection with the  royal tombs at Abydos, In that of King Khent or Tjer (the reading of  the ideograph is doubtful) M. Amelineau found a large bed or bier of  granite, with a figure of the god Osiris lying in state sculptured in  high relief upon it. This led him to jump to the conclusion that he  had found the tomb of the god Osiris himself, and that a skull he found  close by was the veritable cranium of the primeval folk-hero, who,  according to the euhemerist theory, was the deified original of the god.  The true explanation is given by Dr. Wallis Budge in his _History of  Egypt_, i, p. 19. It is a fact that the tomb of Tjer was regarded by  the Egyptians of the XIXth Dynasty as the veritable tomb of Osiris.  They thought they had discovered it, just as M. Amelineau did. When the  ancient royal tombs of Umm el-Ga'ab were rediscovered and identified at  the beginning of the XIXth Dynasty, and Seti I built the great temple of  Abydos to the divine ancestors in honour of the discovery, embellishing  it with a relief of himself and his son Ramses making offerings to the  names of his predecessors (the \"Tablet of Abydos \"), the name of King  Khent or Tjer (which is perhaps the really correct original form) was  read by the royal scribes as \"Khent\" and hastily identified with the  first part of the name of the god _Khent-amenti_ Osiris, the lord of  Abydos. The tomb was thus regarded as the tomb of Osiris himself, and  it was furnished with a great stone figure of the god lying on his bier,  attended by the two hawks of Isis and Nephthys; ever after the site was  visited by crowds of pilgrims, who left at Umm el-Ga'ab the thousands of  little votive vases whose fragments have given the place its name of the  \"Mother of Pots.\" This is the explanation of the discovery of the \"Tomb  of Osiris.\" We have not found what M. Amelineau seems rather naively to  have thought possible, a confirmation of the ancient view that Osiris  was originally a man who ruled over Egypt and was deified after his  death; but we have found that the Egyptians themselves were more or less  euhemerists, and did think so.    It may seem remarkable that all this new knowledge of ancient Egypt is  derived from tombs and has to do with the resting-places of the kings  when dead, rather than with their palaces or temples when living. Of  temples at this early period we have no trace. The oldest temple in  Egypt is perhaps the little chapel in front of the pyramid of Snefru at  Medum. We first hear of temples to the gods under the IVth Dynasty, but  of the actual buildings of that period we have recovered nothing but one  or two inscribed blocks of stone. Prof. Petrie has traced out the plan  of the oldest temple of Osiris at Abydos, which may be of the time of  Khufu, from scanty evidences which give us but little information. It is  certain, however, that this temple, which is clearly one of the oldest  in Egypt, goes back at least to his time. Its site is the mound  called Kom es-Sultan, \"The Mound of the King,\" close to the village of  el-Kherba, and on the borders of the cultivation northeast of the royal  tombs at Umm el-Oa'ab.    Of royal palaces we have more definite information. North of the Kom  es-Sultan are two great fortress-enclosures of brick: the one is known  as _Sunet es-Zebib_, \"the Storehouse of Dried Orapes;\" the other is  occupied by the Coptic monastery of Der Anba Musas. Both are certainly  fortress-palaces of the earliest period of the Egyptian monarchy. We  know from the small record-plaques of this period that the kings were  constantly founding or repairing places of this kind, which were always  great rectangular enclosures with crenelated brick walls like those of  early Babylonian buildings.    We have seen that the Northern Egyptian possessed similar  fortress-cities which were captured by Narmer. These were the seats of  the royal residence in various parts of the country. Behind their walls  was the king's house, and no doubt also a town of nobles and retainers,  while the peasants lived on the arable land without.    [Illustration: 089.jpg THE SHUNET EZ-ZEBIB: THE FORTRESS-TOWN, About  3900 B.C.]    The Shunet ez-Zebib and its companion fortress were evidently the royal  cities of the 1st and IId Dynasties at Abydos. The former has been  excavated by Mr. E. R. Ayrton for the Egypt Exploration Fund, under the  supervision of Prof. Petrie. He found jar-sealings of Khasekhemui and  Perabsen. In later times the place was utilized as a burial-place for  ibis-mummies (it had already been abandoned as a city before the time of  the XIIth Dynasty), and from this fact it received the name of _Shenet  deb-hib_, or \"Storehouse of Ibis Burials.\" The Arab invaders adapted  this name to their own language in the nearest form which would have  any meaning, as _Shunet ez-Zebib_, \"the Storehouse of Dried Grapes.\"  The Arab word _shuna_ (\"Barn\" or \"Storehouse\") was, it should be noted,  taken over from the Coptic _sheune,_ which is the old-Egyptian _shenet_.  The identity of _sheune_ or _shuna_ with the German \"Scheune\" is a  quaint and curious coincidence. In the illustration of the Shunet  ez-Zebib the curved line of crenelated wall, following the contour of  the hill, should be noted, as it is a remarkable example of the building  of this early period.    It will have been seen from the foregoing description of what  far-reaching importance the discoveries at Abydos have been. A new  chapter of the history of the human race has been opened, which contains  information previously undreamt of, information which Egyptologists  had never dared to hope would be recovered. The sand of Egypt indeed  conceals inexhaustible treasures, and no one knows what the morrow's  work may bring forth.    _Ex Africa semper aliquid novi!_          CHAPTER III--MEMPHIS AND THE PYRAMIDS      Memphis, the \"beautiful abode,\" the \"City of the White Wall,\" is said  to have been founded by the legendary Menes, who in order to build it  diverted the stream of the Nile by means of a great dyke constructed  near the modern village of Koshesh, south of the village of Mitrahena,  which marks the central point of the ancient metropolis of Northern  Egypt. It may be that the city was founded by Aha or Narmer, the  historical originals of Mena or Menes; but we have another theory with  regard to its foundation, that it was originally built by King Merpeba  Atjab, whose tomb was also discovered at Abydos near those of Aha and  Narmer. Merpeba is the oldest king whose name is absolutely identified  with one occurring in the XIXth Dynasty king-lists and in Manetho. He  is certainly the \"Merbap\" or \"Merbepa\" (\"Merbapen\") of the lists and the  _Miebis_ of Manetho. In both the lists and in Manetho he stands fifth in  order from Mena, and he was therefore the sixth king of the Ist Dynasty.  The lists, Manetho, and the small monuments in his own tomb agree in  making him the immediate successor of Semti Den (Ousaphais), and from  the style of these latter it is evident that he comes after Tja, Tjer,  Narmer, and Aha. That is to say, the contemporary evidence makes him the  fifth king from Aha, the first original of \"Menes.\"    Now after the piety of Seti I had led him to erect a great temple at  Abydos in memory of the ancient kings, whose sepulchres had probably  been brought to light shortly before, and to compile and set up in the  temple a list of his predecessors, a certain pious snobbery or snobbish  piety impelled a worthy named Tunure, who lived at Memphis, to put up in  his own tomb at Sakkara a tablet of kings like the royal one at Abydos.  If Osiris-Khentamenti at Abydos had his tablet of kings, so should  Osiris-Seker at Sakkara. But Tunure does not begin his list with Mena;  his initial king is Merpeba. For him Merpeba was the first monarch to be  commemorated at Sakkara. Does not this look very much as if the strictly  historical Merpeba, not the rather legendary and confused Mena, was  regarded as the first Memphite king? It may well be that it was in  the reign of Merpeba, not in that of Aha or Narmer, that Memphis was  founded.    The XIXth Dynasty lists of course say nothing about Mena or Merpeba  having founded Memphis; they only give the names of the kings, nothing  more. The earliest authority for the ascription of Memphis to \"Menes\",  is Herodotus, who was followed in this ascription, as in many other  matters, by Manetho; but it must be remembered that Manetho was writing  for the edification of a Greek king (Ptolemy Philadelphus) and his Greek  court at Alexandria, and had therefore to evince a respect for the great  Greek classic which he may not always have really felt. Herodotus is  not, of course, accused of any wilful misstatement in this or in any  other matter in which his accuracy is suspected. He merely wrote  down what he was told by the Egyptians themselves, and Merpeba was  sufficiently near in time to Aha to be easily confounded with him by  the scribes of the Persian period, who no doubt ascribed everything  to \"Mena\" that was done by the kings of the Ist and IId Dynasties.  Therefore it may be considered quite probable that the \"Menes\" who  founded Memphis was Merpeba, the fifth or sixth king of the Ist Dynasty,  whom Tunure, a thousand years before the time of Herodotus and his  informants, placed at the head of the Memphite \"List of Sakkara.\"    The reconquest of the North by Khasekhemui doubtless led to a further  strengthening of"]]]
