So he dressed particularly  slowly in the hope of avoiding an encounter with his host. But fate  thwarted this hope. Reginald, too, lingered that morning unusually long  over his coffee. He was just taking his last sip when Ernest entered the  room. His behaviour was of an almost bourgeois kindness. Benevolence  fairly beamed from his face. But to the boy's eyes it had assumed a new  and sinister expression.    \"You are late this morning, Ernest,\" he remarked in his mildest manner.  \"Have you been about town, or writing poetry? Both occupations are  equally unhealthy.\" As he said this he watched the young man with the  inscrutable smile that at moments was wont to curl upon his lips. Ernest  had once likened it to the smile of Mona Lisa, but now he detected in it  the suavity of the hypocrite and the leer of the criminal.    He could not endure it; he could not look upon that face any longer. His  feet almost gave way under him, cold sweat gathered on his brow, and he  sank on a chair trembling and studiously avoiding the other man's gaze.    At last Reginald rose to go. It seemed impossible to accuse this  splendid impersonation of vigorous manhood of cunning and underhand  methods, of plagiarisms and of theft. As he stood there he resembled  more than anything a beautiful tiger-cat, a wonderful thing of strength  and will-power, indomitable and insatiate. Yet who could tell whether  this strength was not, after all, parasitic. If Ethel's suspicions were  justified, then, indeed, more had been taken from him than he could ever  realise. For in that case it was his life-blood that circled in those  veins and the fire of his intellect that set those lips aflame!          XXVII      Reginald Clarke had hardly left the room when Ernest hastily rose from  his seat. While it was likely that he would remain in undisturbed  possession of the apartment the whole morning, the stake at hand was too  great to permit of delay.    Palpitating and a little uncertain, he entered the studio where,  scarcely a year ago, Reginald Clarke had bidden him welcome. Nothing had  changed there since then; only in Ernest's mind the room had assumed an  aspect of evil. The Antinous was there and the Faun and the Christ-head.  But their juxtaposition to-day partook of the nature of the blasphemous.  The statues of Shakespeare and Balzac seemed to frown from their  pedestals as his fingers were running through Reginald's papers. He  brushed against a semblance of Napoleon that was standing on the  writing-table, so that it toppled over and made a noise that weirdly  re-echoed in the silence of the room. At that moment a curious family  resemblance between Shakespeare, Balzac, Napoleon--and Reginald,  forcibly impressed itself upon his mind. It was the indisputable  something that marks those who are chosen to give ultimate expression to  some gigantic world-purpose. In Balzac's face it was diffused with  kindliness, in that of Napoleon sheer brutality predominated. The image  of one who was said to be the richest man of the world also rose before  his eyes. Perhaps it was only the play of his fevered imagination, but  he could have sworn that this man's features, too, bore the mark of  those unoriginal, great absorptive minds who, for better or for worse,  are born to rob and rule. They seemed to him monsters that know neither  justice nor pity, only the law of their being, the law of growth.    Common weapons would not avail against such forces. Being one, they were  stronger than armies; nor could they be overcome in single combat.  Stealth, trickery, the outfit of the knave, were legitimate weapons in  such a fight. In this case the end justified the means, even if the  latter included burglary.    After a brief and fruitless search of the desk, he attempted to force  open a secret drawer, the presence of which he had one day accidentally  discovered. He tried a number of keys to no account, and was thinking of  giving up his researches for the day until he had procured a skeleton  key, when at last the lock gave way.    The drawer disclosed a large file of manuscript. Ernest paused for a  moment to draw breath. The paper rustled under his nervous fingers. And  there--at last--his eyes lit upon a bulky bundle that bore this legend:  \"_Leontina_, A Novel.\"    It was true, then--all, his dream, Reginald's confession. And the house  that had opened its doors so kindly to him was the house of a Vampire!    Finally curiosity overcame his burning indignation. He attempted to  read. The letters seemed to dance before his eyes--his hands trembled.    At last he succeeded. The words that had first rolled over like drunken  soldiers now marched before his vision in orderly sequence. He was  delighted, then stunned. This was indeed authentic literature, there  could be no doubt about it. And it was his. He was still a poet, a great  poet. He drew a deep breath. Sudden joy trembled in his heart. This  story set down by a foreign hand had grown chapter by chapter in his  brain.    There were some slight changes--slight deviations from the original  plan. A defter hand than his had retouched it here and there, but for  all that it remained his very own. It did not belong to that thief. The  blood welled to his cheek as he uttered this word that, applied to  Reginald, seemed almost sacrilegious.    He had nearly reached the last chapter when he heard steps in the  hallway. Hurriedly he restored the manuscript to its place, closed the  drawer and left the room on tiptoe.    It was Reginald. But he did not come alone. Someone was speaking to him.  The voice seemed familiar. Ernest could not make out what it said. He  listened intently and--was it possible? Jack? Surely he could not yet  have come in response to his note! What mysterious power, what dim  presentiment of his friend's plight had led him hither? But why did he  linger so long in Reginald's room, instead of hastening to greet him?  Cautiously he drew nearer. This time he caught Jack's words:    \"It would be very convenient and pleasant. Still, some way, I feel that  it is not right for me, of all men, to take his place here.\"    \"That need not concern you,\" Reginald deliberately replied; \"the dear  boy expressed the desire to leave me within a fortnight. I think he will  go to some private sanitarium. His nerves are frightfully overstrained.\"    \"This seems hardly surprising after the terrible attack he had when you  read your play.\"    \"That idea has since then developed into a monomania.\"    \"I am awfully sorry for him. I cared for him much, perhaps too much. But  I always feared that he would come to such an end. Of late his letters  have been strangely unbalanced.\"    \"You will find him very much changed. In fact, he is no longer the  same.\"    \"No,\" said Jack, \"he is no longer the friend I loved.\"    Ernest clutched for the wall. His face was contorted with intense agony.  Each word was like a nail driven into his flesh. Crucified upon the  cross of his own affection by the hand he loved, all white and trembling  he stood there. Tears rushed to his eyes, but he could not weep.  Dry-eyed he reached his room and threw himself upon his bed. Thus he  lay--uncomforted and alone.          XXVIII      Terrible as was his loneliness, a meeting with Jack would have been more  terrible. And, after all, it was true, a gulf had opened between them.    Ethel alone could bring solace to his soul. There was a great void in  his heart which only she could fill. He hungered for the touch of her  hand. He longed for her presence strongly, as a wanton lusts for  pleasure and as sad men crave death.    Noiselessly he stole to the door so as not to arouse the attention of  the other two men, whose every whisper pierced his heart like a dagger.  When he came to Ethel's home, he found that she had gone out for a  breath of air. The servant ushered him into the parlor, and there he  waited, waited, waited for her.    Greatly calmed by his walk, he turned the details of Clarke's  conversation over in his mind, and the conviction grew upon him that  the friend of his boyhood was not to blame for his course of action.  Reginald probably had encircled Jack's soul with his demoniacal  influence and singled him out for another victim. That must never be. It  was his turn to save now. He would warn his friend of the danger that  threatened him, even if his words should be spoken into the wind. For  Reginald, with an ingenuity almost satanic, had already suggested that  the delusion of former days had developed into a monomania, and any  attempt on his part to warn Jack would only seem to confirm this theory.  In that case only one way was left open. He must plead with Reginald  himself, confront at all risks that snatcher of souls. To-night he would  not fall asleep. He would keep his vigil. And if Reginald should  approach his room, if in some way he felt the direful presence, he must  speak out, threaten if need be, to save his friend from ruin. He had  fully determined upon this course when a cry of joy from Ethel, who had  just returned from her walk, interrupted his reverie. But her gladness  changed to anxiety when she saw how pale he was. Ernest recounted to  her the happenings of the day, from the discovery of his novel in  Reginald's desk to the conversation which he had accidentally overheard.  He noticed that her features brightened as he drew near the end of his  tale.    \"Was your novel finished?\" she suddenly asked.    \"I think so.\"    \"Then you are out of danger. He will want nothing else of you. But you  should have taken it with you.\"    \"I had only sufficient presence of mind to slip it back into the drawer.  To-morrow I shall simply demand it.\"    \"You will do nothing of the kind. It is in his handwriting, and you have  no legal proof that it is yours. You must take it away secretly. And he  will not dare to reclaim it.\"    \"And Jack?\"    She had quite forgotten"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17149"],[0,"Creative Chemistry: Descriptive of Recent Achievements in the Chemical (#14)"],[1,"he was surprised to find that it gave  a beautiful purple solution. This was \"mauve,\" the first of the aniline  dyes.    The funny thing about it was that when Perkin tried to repeat the  experiment with purer aniline he could not get his color. It was because  he was working with impure chemicals, with aniline containing a little  toluidine, that he discovered mauve. It was, as I said, a lucky  accident. But it was not accidental that the accident happened to the  young fellow who spent his noonings and vacations at the study of  chemistry. A man may not find what he is looking for, but he never  finds anything unless he is looking for something.    Mauve was a product of creative chemistry, for it was a substance that  had never existed before. Perkin's next great triumph, ten years later,  was in rivaling Nature in the manufacture of one of her own choice  products. This is alizarin, the coloring matter contained in the madder  root. It was an ancient and oriental dyestuff, known as \"Turkey red\" or  by its Arabic name of \"alizari.\" When madder was introduced into France  it became a profitable crop and at one time half a million tons a year  were raised. A couple of French chemists, Robiquet and Colin, extracted  from madder its active principle, alizarin, in 1828, but it was not  until forty years later that it was discovered that alizarin had for its  base one of the coal-tar products, anthracene. Then came a neck-and-neck  race between Perkin and his German rivals to see which could discover a  cheap process for making alizarin from anthracene. The German chemists  beat him to the patent office by one day! Graebe and Liebermann filed  their application for a patent on the sulfuric acid process as No. 1936  on June 25, 1869. Perkin filed his for the same process as No. 1948 on  June 26. It had required twenty years to determine the constitution of  alizarin, but within six months from its first synthesis the commercial  process was developed and within a few years the sale of artificial  alizarin reached $8,000,000 annually. The madder fields of France were  put to other uses and even the French soldiers became dependent on  made-in-Germany dyes for their red trousers. The British soldiers were  placed in a similar situation as regards their red coats when after  1878 the azo scarlets put the cochineal bug out of business.    The modern chemist has robbed royalty of its most distinctive insignia,  Tyrian purple. In ancient times to be \"porphyrogene,\" that is \"born to  the purple,\" was like admission to the Almanach de Gotha at the present  time, for only princes or their wealthy rivals could afford to pay $600  a pound for crimsoned linen. The precious dye is secreted by a  snail-like shellfish of the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. From a  tiny sac behind the head a drop of thick whitish liquid, smelling like  garlic, can be extracted. If this is spread upon cloth of any kind and  exposed to air and sunlight it turns first green, next blue and then  purple. If the cloth is washed with soap--that is, set by alkali--it  becomes a fast crimson, such as Catholic cardinals still wear as princes  of the church. The Phoenician merchants made fortunes out of their  monopoly, but after the fall of Tyre it became one of \"the lost  arts\"--and accordingly considered by those whose faces are set toward  the past as much more wonderful than any of the new arts. But in 1909  Friedlander put an end to the superstition by analyzing Tyrian purple  and finding that it was already known. It was the same as a dye that had  been prepared five years before by Sachs but had not come into  commercial use because of its inferiority to others in the market. It  required 12,000 of the mollusks to supply the little material needed for  analysis, but once the chemist had identified it he did not need to  bother the Murex further, for he could make it by the ton if he had  wanted to. The coloring principle turned out to be a di-brom indigo,  that is the same as the substance extracted from the Indian plant, but  with the addition of two atoms of bromine. Why a particular kind of a  shellfish should have got the habit of extracting this rare element from  sea water and stowing it away in this peculiar form is \"one of those  things no fellow can find out.\" But according to the chemist the Murex  mollusk made a mistake in hitching the bromine to the wrong carbon  atoms. He finds as he would word it that the 6:6' di-brom indigo  secreted by the shellfish is not so good as the 5:5' di-brom indigo now  manufactured at a cheap rate and in unlimited quantity. But we must not  expect too much of a mollusk's mind. In their cheapness lies the offense  of the aniline dyes in the minds of some people. Our modern aristocrats  would delight to be entitled \"porphyrogeniti\" and to wear exclusive  gowns of \"purple and scarlet from the isles of Elishah\" as was done in  Ezekiel's time, but when any shopgirl or sailor can wear the royal color  it spoils its beauty in their eyes. Applied science accomplishes a real  democracy such as legislation has ever failed to establish.    Any kind of dye found in nature can be made in the laboratory whenever  its composition is understood and usually it can be made cheaper and  purer than it can be extracted from the plant. But to work out a  profitable process for making it synthetically is sometimes a task  requiring high skill, persistent labor and heavy expenditure. One of the  latest and most striking of these achievements of synthetic chemistry is  the manufacture of indigo.    Indigo is one of the oldest and fastest of the dyestuffs. To see that it  is both ancient and lasting look at the unfaded blue cloths that enwrap  an Egyptian mummy. When Caesar conquered our British ancestors he found  them tattooed with woad, the native indigo. But the chief source of  indigo was, as its name implies, India. In 1897 nearly a million acres  in India were growing the indigo plant and the annual value of the crop  was $20,000,000. Then the fall began and by 1914 India was producing  only $300,000 worth! What had happened to destroy this profitable  industry? Some blight or insect? No, it was simply that the Badische  Anilin-und-Soda Fabrik had worked out a practical process for making  artificial indigo.    That indigo on breaking up gave off aniline was discovered as early as  1840. In fact that was how aniline got its name, for when Fritzsche  distilled indigo with caustic soda he called the colorless distillate  \"aniline,\" from the Arabic name for indigo, \"anil\" or \"al-nil,\" that is,  \"the blue-stuff.\" But how to reverse the process and get indigo from  aniline puzzled chemists for more than forty years until finally it was  solved by Adolf von Baeyer of Munich, who died in 1917 at the age of  eighty-four. He worked on the problem of the constitution of indigo for  fifteen years and discovered several ways of making it. It is possible  to start from benzene, toluene or naphthalene. The first process was the  easiest, but if you will refer to the products of the distillation of  tar you will find that the amount of toluene produced is less than the  naphthalene, which is hard to dispose of. That is, if a dye factory had  worked out a process for making indigo from toluene it would not be  practicable because there was not enough toluene produced to supply the  demand for indigo. So the more complicated napthalene process was  chosen in preference to the others in order to utilize this by-product.    The Badische Anilin-und-Soda Fabrik spent $5,000,000 and seventeen years  in chemical research before they could make indigo, but they gained a  monopoly (or, to be exact, ninety-six per cent.) of the world's  production. A hundred years ago indigo cost as much as $4 a pound. In  1914 we were paying fifteen cents a pound for it. Even the pauper labor  of India could not compete with the German chemists at that price. At  the beginning of the present century Germany was paying more than  $3,000,000 a year for indigo. Fourteen years later Germany was _selling_  indigo to the amount of $12,600,000. Besides its cheapness, artificial  indigo is preferable because it is of uniform quality and greater  purity. Vegetable indigo contains from forty to eighty per cent. of  impurities, among them various other tinctorial substances. Artificial  indigo is made pure and of any desired strength, so the dyers can depend  on it.    The value of the aniline colors lies in their infinite variety. Some are  fast, some will fade, some will stand wear and weather as long as the  fabric, some will wash out on the spot. Dyes can be made that will  attach themselves to wool, to silk or to cotton, and give it any shade  of any color. The period of discovery by accident has long gone by. The  chemist nowadays decides first just what kind of a dye he wants, and  then goes to work systematically to make it. He begins by drawing a  diagram of the molecule, double-linking nitrogen or carbon and oxygen  atoms to give the required intensity, putting in acid or basic radicals  to fasten it to the fiber, shifting the color back and forth along the  spectrum at will by introducing methyl groups, until he gets it just to  his liking.    Art can go ahead of nature in the dyestuff business. Before man found  that he could make all the dyes he wanted from the tar he had been  burning up at home he searched the wide world over to find colors by  which he could make himself--or his wife--garments as beautiful as those  that arrayed the flower, the bird and the butterfly. He sent divers down  into the Mediterranean to rob the murex of his purple. He sent ships to  the new world to get Brazil wood and to the oldest world for indigo. He  robbed the lady cochineal of her scarlet coat. Why these peculiar  substances were formed only by these particular plants, mussels and  insects it is hard to understand.
