The monks are showing him  the paved way to hell.    These hypocrites do not know the first thing about grace, the Gospel,  or Christ. They retain the appearance and the name of the Gospel and  of Christ for a decoy only. In their confessional writings faith or the  merit of Christ are never mentioned. In their writings they play up  the merits of man, as can readily be seen from the following form of  absolution used among the monks.      \"God forgive thee, brother. The merit of the passion of our Lord Jesus    Christ, and of the blessed Saint Mary, always a virgin, and of all the    saints; the merit of thy order, the strictness of thy religion, the    humility of thy profession, the contrition of thy heart, the good works    thou hast done and shalt do for the love of our Lord Jesus Christ, be    available unto thee for the remission of thy sins, the increase of thy    worth and grace, and the reward of everlasting life. Amen.\"    True, the merit of Christ is mentioned in this formula of absolution.  But if you look closer you will notice that Christ's merit is belittled,  while monkish merits are aggrandized. They confess Christ with their  lips, and at the same time deny His power to save. I myself was at one  time entangled in this error. I thought Christ was a judge and had to be  pacified by a strict adherence to the rules of my order. But now I give  thanks unto God, the Father of all mercies, who has called me out of  darkness into the light of His glorious Gospel, and has granted unto me  the saving knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord.    We conclude with Paul, that we are justified by faith in Christ, without  the Law. Once a person has been justified by Christ, he will not be  unproductive of good, but as a good tree he will bring forth good fruit.  A believer has the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit will not permit a  person to remain idle, but will put him to work and stir him up to  the love of God, to patient suffering in affliction, to prayer,  thanksgiving, to the habit of charity towards all men.        VERSE 19. For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live    unto God.    This cheering form of speech is frequently met with in the Scriptures,  particularly in the writings of St. Paul, when the Law is set against  the Law, and sin is made to oppose sin, and death is arrayed against  death, and hell is turned loose against hell, as in the following  quotations: \"Thou hast led captivity captive,\" Psalm 68:18. \"O death, I  will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction,\" Hosea 13:14.  \"And for sin, condemned sin in the flesh,\" Romans 8:3.    Here Paul plays the Law against the Law, as if to say: \"The Law of Moses  condemns me; but I have another law, the law of grace and liberty which  condemns the accusing Law of Moses.\"    On first sight Paul seems to be advancing a strange and ugly heresy.  He says, \"I am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.\" The false  apostles said the very opposite. They said, \"If you do not live to the  law, you are dead unto God.\"    The doctrine of our opponents is similar to that of the false apostles  in Paul's day. Our opponents teach, \"If you want to live unto God,  you must live after the Law, for it is written, Do this and thou shalt  live.\" Paul, on the other hand, teaches, \"We cannot live unto God unless  we are dead unto the Law.\" If we are dead unto the Law, the Law can have  no power over us.    Paul does not only refer to the Ceremonial Law, but to the whole Law.  We are not to think that the Law is wiped out. It stays. It continues to  operate in the wicked. But a Christian is dead to the Law. For example,  Christ by His resurrection became free from the grave, and yet the grave  remains. Peter was delivered from prison, yet the prison remains. The  Law is abolished as far as I am concerned, when it has driven me into  the arms of Christ. Yet the Law continues to exist and to function. But  it no longer exists for me.    \"I have nothing to do with the Law,\" cries Paul. He could not have  uttered anything more devastating to the prestige of the Law. He  declares that he does not care for the Law, that he does not intend ever  to be justified by the Law.    To be dead to the Law means to be free of the Law. What right, then,  has the Law to accuse me, or to hold anything against me? When you see  a person squirming in the clutches of the Law, say to him: \"Brother, get  things straight. You let the Law talk to your conscience. Make it talk  to your flesh. Wake up, and believe in Jesus Christ, the Conqueror of  Law and sin. Faith in Christ will lift you high above the Law into the  heaven of grace. Though Law and sin remain, they no longer concern you,  because you are dead to the Law and dead to sin.\"    Blessed is the person who knows how to use this truth in times of  distress. He can talk. He can say: \"Mr. Law, go ahead and accuse me as  much as you like. I know I have committed many sins, and I continue to  sin daily. But that does not bother me. You have got to shout louder,  Mr. Law. I am deaf, you know. Talk as much as you like, I am dead to  you. If you want to talk to me about my sins, go and talk to my flesh.  Belabor that, but don't talk to my conscience. My conscience is a lady  and a queen, and has nothing to do with the likes of you, because my  conscience lives to Christ under another law, a new and better law, the  law of grace.\"    We have two propositions: To live unto the Law, is to die unto God. To  die unto the Law, is to live unto God. These two propositions go against  reason. No law-worker can ever understand them. But see to it that you  understand them. The Law can never justify and save a sinner. The Law  can only accuse, terrify, and kill him. Therefore to live unto the Law  is to die unto God. Vice versa, to die unto the Law is to live unto God.  If you want to live unto God, bury the Law, and find life through faith  in Christ Jesus.    We have enough arguments right here to conclude that justification is  by faith alone. How can the Law effect our justification, when Paul so  plainly states that we must be dead to the Law if we want to live unto  God? If we are dead to the Law and the Law is dead to us, how can it  possibly contribute anything to our justification? There is nothing left  for us but to be justified by faith alone.    This nineteenth verse is loaded with consolation. It fortifies a person  against every danger. It allows you to argue like this:      \"I confess I have sinned.\"    \"Then God will punish you.\"    \"No, He will not do that.\"    \"Why not? Does not the Law say so?\"    \"I have nothing to do with the Law.\"    \"How so?\"    \"I have another law, the law of liberty.\"    \"What do you mean--'liberty'?\"    \"The liberty of Christ, for Christ has made me free from the Law that    held me down. That Law is now in prison itself, held captive by grace    and liberty.\"    By faith in Christ a person may gain such sure and sound comfort, that  he need not fear the devil, sin, death, or any evil. \"Sir Devil,\" he  may say, \"I am not afraid of you. I have a Friend whose name is Jesus  Christ, in whom I believe. He has abolished the Law, condemned sin,  vanquished death, and destroyed hell for me. He is bigger than you,  Satan. He has licked you, and holds you down. You cannot hurt me.\" This  is the faith that overcomes the devil.    Paul manhandles the Law. He treats the Law as if it were a thief and  a robber He treats the Law as contemptible to the conscience, in order  that those who believe in Christ may take courage to defy the Law, and  say: \"Mr. Law, I am a sinner. What are you going to do about it?\"    Or take death. Christ is risen from death. Why should we now fear the  grave? Against my death I set another death, or rather life, my life in  Christ.    Oh, the sweet names of Jesus! He is called my law against the Law, my  sin against sin, my death against death. Translated, it means that He is  my righteousness, my life, my everlasting salvation. For this reason was  He made the law of the Law, the sin of sin, the death of death, that  He might redeem me from the curse of the Law. He permitted the Law to  accuse Him, sin to condemn Him, and death to take Him, to abolish the  Law, to condemn sin, and to destroy death for me.    This peculiar form of speech sounds much sweeter than if Paul had said:  \"I through liberty am dead to the law.\" By putting it in this way, \"I  through the law am dead to the law,\" he opposes one law with another  law, and has them fight it out.    In this masterly fashion Paul draws our attention away from the Law,  sin, death, and every evil, and centers it upon Christ.        VERSE 20. I am crucified with Christ.    Christ is Lord over the Law, because He was crucified unto the Law. I  also am lord over the Law, because by faith I am crucified with Christ.    Paul does not here speak of crucifying the flesh, but he speaks of that  higher crucifying wherein sin, devil, and death are crucified in Christ  and in me. By my faith in Christ I am crucified with Christ. Hence these  evils are crucified and dead unto me.        VERSE 20. Nevertheless I live.    \"I do not mean to create the impression as though I did not live before  this. But in reality I first live now, now that I have been delivered  from the Law, from sin, and death. Being crucified with Christ and dead  unto the Law, I may now rise unto a new and better life.\"    We must pay close attention to Paul's way of speaking.

What makes one man an  artist and keeps another an amateur is a God-given instinct for the  artistically and musically right. It is not a thing to be explained, but  to be felt. There is often only a narrow line of demarcation between the  artistically right and wrong. Yet nearly every real artist will be found  to agree as to when and when not that boundary has been overstepped.  Sincerity and personality as well as disinterestedness, an expression of  himself in his art that is absolutely honest, these, I believe, are  ideals which every artist should cherish and try to realize. I believe,  furthermore, that these ideals will come more and more into their own;  that after the war there will be a great uplift, and that Art will  realize to the full its value as a humanizing factor in life.\" And as is  well known, no great artist of our day has done more toward the actual  realization of these ideals he cherishes than Fritz Kreisler himself.                                              X                                    FRANZ KNEISEL                           THE PERFECT STRING ENSEMBLE      Is there a lover of chamber music unfamiliar with Franz Kneisel's name?  It may be doubted. After earlier European triumphs the gifted Roumanian  violinist came to this country (1885), and aside from his activities in  other directions--as a solo artist he was the first to play the Brahms  and Goldmark violin concertos, and the Cesar Franck sonata in this  country--organized his famous quartet. And, until his recent retirement  as its director and first violin, it has been perhaps the greatest  single influence toward stimulating appreciation for the best in chamber  music that the country has known. Before the Flonzaley was, the Kneisels  were. They made plain how much of beauty the chamber music repertory  offered the amateur string player; not only in the classic  repertory--Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Spohr; in Schubert, Schumann,  Brahms; but in Smetana, Dvorak and Tschaikovsky; in Cesar Franck,  Debussy and Ravel. Not the least among Kneisel's achievements is, that  while the professional musicians in the cities in which his organization  played attended its concerts as a matter of course, the average music  lover who played a string instrument came to them as well, and carried  away with him a message delivered with all the authority of superb  musicianship and sincerity, one which bade him \"go and do likewise,\" in  so far as his limitations permitted. And the many excellent professional  chamber music organizations, trios, quartets and _ensembles_ of various  kinds which have come to the fore since they began to play offer  eloquent testimony with regard to the cultural work of Kneisel and his  fellow artists.                [Illustration: FRANZ KNEISEL, with signature]    A cheery grate fire burned in the comfortable study in Franz Kneisel's  home; the autographed--in what affectionate and appreciative  terms--pictures of great fellow artists looked down above the book-cases  which hold the scores of those masters of what has been called \"the  noblest medium of music in existence,\" whose beauties the famous quartet  has so often disclosed on the concert stage. And Mr. Kneisel was  amiability personified when I asked him to give me his theory of the  perfect string _ensemble_, and the part virtuosity played in it.                 \"THE ARTIST RANKS THE VIRTUOSO IN CHAMBER MUSIC\"    \"The artist, the _Tonkuenstler_, to use a foreign phrase, ranks the  virtuoso in chamber music. Joachim was no virtuoso, he did not stress  technic, the less important factor in _ensemble_ playing. Sarasate was a  virtuoso in the best sense of the word; and yet as an _ensemble_ music  player he fell far short of Joachim. As I see it 'virtuoso' is a kind of  flattering title, no more. But a _Tonkuenstler_, a 'tone-artist,' though  he must have the virtuoso technic in order to play Brahms and Beethoven  concertos, needs besides a spiritual insight, a deep concept of their  nobility to do them justice--the mere technic demanded for a virtuoso  show piece is not enough.                        VIOLIN MASTERY IN THE STRING QUARTET    \"You ask me what 'Violin Mastery' means in the string quartet. It has an  altogether different meaning to me, I imagine, than to the violin  virtuoso. Violin mastery in the string _ensemble_ is as much mastery of  self as of technical means. The artist must sink his identity completely  in that of the work he plays, and though the last Beethoven quartets are  as difficult as many violin concertos, they are polyphony, the  combination and interweaving of individual melodies, and they call for a  mastery of repression as well as expression. I realized how keenly alive  the musical listener is to this fact once when our quartet had played in  Alma-Tadema's beautiful London home, for the great English painter was  also a music-lover and a very discriminating one. He had a fine piano in  a beautifully decorated case, and it was an open secret that at his  musical evenings, after an artist had played, the lid of the piano was  raised, and Sir Lawrence asked him to pencil his autograph on the soft  white wood of its inner surface--_but only if he thought the compliment  deserved_. There were some famous names written there--Joachim,  Sarasate, Paderewski, Neruda, Piatti, to mention a few. Naturally an  artist playing at Alma-Tadema's home for the first time could not help  speculating as to his chances. Many were called, but comparatively few  were chosen. We were guests at a dinner given by Sir Lawrence. There  were some fifty people prominent in London's artistic, musical and  social world present, and we had no idea of being asked to play. Our  instruments were at our hotel and we had to send for them. We played the  Schubert quartet in A minor and Dvorak's 'American' quartet and, of  course, my colleagues and myself forgot all about the piano lid the  moment we began to play. Yet, I'm free to confess, that when the piano  lid was raised for us we appreciated it, for it was no empty compliment  coming from Sir Lawrence, and I have been told that some very  distinguished artists have not had it extended to them. And I know that  on that evening the phrase 'Violin Mastery' in an _ensemble_ sense, as  the outcome of ceaseless striving for cooerdination in expression,  absolute balance, and all the details that go to make up the perfect  _ensemble_, seemed to us to have a very definite color and meaning.                      THE FIRST VIOLIN IN THE STRING QUARTET    \"What exactly does the first violin represent?\" Mr. Kneisel went on in  answer to another question. \"The first violin might be called the  chairman of the string meeting. His is the leading voice. Not that he  should be an autocrat, no, but he must hold the reins of discipline.  Many think that the four string players in a quartet have equal rights.  First of all, and above all, are the rights of the composer, Bach,  Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert,--as the case may be. But from the  standpoint of interpretation the first violin has some seventy per cent.  of the responsibility as compared with thirty per cent. for the  remaining voices. In all the famous quartet organizations, Joachim,  Hellmesberger, etc., the first violin has been the directing instrument  and has set the pace. As chairman it has been his duty to say when  second violin, viola and 'cello were entitled to hold the floor.  Hellmesberger, in fact, considered himself the _whole_ quartet.\" Mr.  Kneisel smiled and showed me a little book of Hellmesberger's Vienna  programs. Each program was headed:                             HELLMESBERGER QUARTET                             with the assistance of                       MESSRS. MATH. DURST, CARL HEISSLER,                              CARL SCHLESINGER    \"In other words, Hellmesberger was the quartet himself, the other three  artists merely 'assisted,' which, after all, is going too far!    \"Of course, quartets differ. Just as we have operas in which the alto  solo _role_ is the most important, so we have quartets in which the  'cello or the viola has a more significant part. Mozart dedicated  quartets to a King of Prussia, who played 'cello, and he was careful to  make the 'cello part the most important. And in Smetana's quartet _Aus  meinem Leben_, the viola plays a most important role. Even the second  violin often plays themes introducing principal themes of the first  violin, and it has its brief moments of prominence. Yet, though the  second violin or the 'cellist may be, comparatively speaking, a better  player than the first violin, the latter is and must be the leader.  Practically every composer of chamber music recognizes the fact in his  compositions. He, the first violin, should not command three slaves,  though; but guide three associates, and do it tactfully with regard to  their individuality and that of their instruments.                               \"ENSEMBLE\" REHEARSING    \"You ask what are the essentials of _ensemble_ practice on the part of  the artists? Real reverence, untiring zeal and punctuality at  rehearsals. And then, an absolute sense of rhythm. I remember  rehearsing a Volkmann quartet once with a new second violinist.\" [Mr.  Kneisel crossed over to his bookcase and brought me the score to  illustrate the rhythmic point in question, one slight in itself yet as  difficult, perhaps, for a player without an absolute sense of rhythm as  \"perfect intonation\" would be for some others.] \"He had a lovely tone, a  big technic and was a prize pupil of the Vienna Conservatory. We went  over this two measure phrase some sixteen times, until I felt sure he  had grasped the proper accentuation. And he was most amiable and willing  about it, too. But when we broke up he"]]]
