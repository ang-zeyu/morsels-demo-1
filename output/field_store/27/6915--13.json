Under the  sweeping hail the head of the British advance was shattered, and the  whole column stopped. Then it surged forward again, almost to the foot  of the breastworks; but not a man lived to reach them, and in a moment  more the troops broke and ran back. Mad with shame and rage, Pakenham  rode among them to rally and lead them forward, and the officers sprang  around him, smiting the fugitives with their swords and cheering on the  men who stood. For a moment the troops halted, and again came forward  to the charge; but again they were met by a hail of bullets from the  backwoods rifles. One shot struck Pakenham himself. He reeled and fell  from the saddle, and was carried off the field. The second and third  in command fell also, and then all attempts at further advance were  abandoned, and the British troops ran back to their lines. Another  assault had meanwhile been made by a column close to the river, the  charging soldiers rushing to the top of the breastworks; but they were  all killed or driven back. A body of troops had also been sent across  the river, where they routed a small detachment of Kentucky militia; but  they were, of course, recalled when the main assault failed.    At last the men who had conquered the conquerors of Europe had  themselves met defeat. Andrew Jackson and his rough riflemen had  worsted, in fair fight, a far larger force of the best of Wellington's  veterans, and had accomplished what no French marshal and no French  troops had been able to accomplish throughout the long war in the  Spanish peninsula. For a week the sullen British lay in their lines;  then, abandoning their heavy artillery, they marched back to the ships  and sailed for Europe.          JOHN QUINCY ADAMS AND THE RIGHT OF PETITION         He rests with the immortals; his journey has been long:       For him no wail of sorrow, but a paean full and strong!       So well and bravely has he done the work be found to do,       To justice, freedom, duty, God, and man forever true.                            --Whittier.      The lot of ex-Presidents of the United States, as a rule, has been  a life of extreme retirement, but to this rule there is one marked  exception. When John Quincy Adams left the White House in March, 1829,  it must have seemed as if public life could hold nothing more for him.  He had had everything apparently that an American statesman could hope  for. He had been Minister to Holland and Prussia, to Russia and England.  He had been a Senator of the United States, Secretary of State for  eight years, and finally President. Yet, notwithstanding all this, the  greatest part of his career, and his noblest service to his country,  were still before him when he gave up the Presidency.    In the following year (1830) he was told that he might be elected to  the House of Representatives, and the gentleman who made the proposition  ventured to say that he thought an ex-President, by taking such a  position, \"instead of degrading the individual would elevate the  representative character.\" Mr. Adams replied that he had \"in that  respect no scruples whatever. No person can be degraded by serving  the people as Representative in Congress, nor, in my opinion, would an  ex-President of the United States be degraded by serving as a selectman  of his town if elected thereto by the people.\" A few weeks later he was  chosen to the House, and the district continued to send him every two  years from that time until his death. He did much excellent work in the  House, and was conspicuous in more than one memorable scene; but here  it is possible to touch on only a single point, where he came forward  as the champion of a great principle, and fought a battle for the right  which will always be remembered among the great deeds of American public  men.    Soon after Mr. Adams took his seat in Congress, the movement for the  abolition of slavery was begun by a few obscure agitators. It did not at  first attract much attention, but as it went on it gradually exasperated  the overbearing temper of the Southern slaveholders. One fruit of this  agitation was the appearance of petitions for the abolition of slavery  in the House of Representatives. A few were presented by Mr. Adams  without attracting much notice; but as the petitions multiplied, the  Southern representatives became aroused. They assailed Mr. Adams for  presenting them, and finally passed what was known as the gag rule,  which prevented the reception of these petitions by the House. Against  this rule Mr. Adams protested, in the midst of the loud shouts of  the Southerners, as a violation of his constitutional rights. But  the tyranny of slavery at that time was so complete that the rule was  adopted and enforced, and the slaveholders, undertook in this way  to suppress free speech in the House, just as they also undertook to  prevent the transmission through the mails of any writings adverse to  slavery. With the wisdom of a statesman and a man of affairs, Mr. Adams  addressed himself to the one practical point of the contest. He did not  enter upon a discussion of slavery or of its abolition, but turned his  whole force toward the vindication of the right of petition. On every  petition day he would offer, in constantly increasing numbers, petitions  which came to him from all parts of the country for the abolition of  slavery, in this way driving the Southern representatives almost to  madness, despite their rule which prevented the reception of such  documents when offered. Their hatred of Mr. Adams is something difficult  to conceive, and they were burning to break him down, and, if possible,  drive him from the House. On February 6, 1837, after presenting the  usual petitions, Mr. Adams offered one upon which he said he should like  the judgment of the Speaker as to its propriety, inasmuch as it was a  petition from slaves. In a moment the House was in a tumult, and  loud cries of \"Expel him!\" \"Expel him!\" rose in all directions. One  resolution after another was offered looking toward his expulsion or  censure, and it was not until February 9, three days later, that he was  able to take the floor in his own defense. His speech was a masterpiece  of argument, invective, and sarcasm. He showed, among other things, that  he had not offered the petition, but had only asked the opinion of the  Speaker upon it, and that the petition itself prayed that slavery should  not be abolished. When he closed his speech, which was quite as savage  as any made against him, and infinitely abler, no one desired to reply,  and the idea of censuring him was dropped.    The greatest struggle, however, came five years later, when, on January  21, 1842, Mr. Adams presented the petition of certain citizens of  Haverhill, Massachusetts, praying for the dissolution of the Union  on account of slavery. His enemies felt that now, at last, he had  delivered himself into their hands. Again arose the cry for his  expulsion, and again vituperation was poured out upon him, and  resolutions to expel him freely introduced. When he got the floor to  speak in his own defense, he faced an excited House, almost unanimously  hostile to him, and possessing, as he well knew, both the will and the  power to drive him from its walls. But there was no wavering in Mr.  Adams. \"If they say they will try me,\" he said, \"they must try me. If  they say they will punish me, they must punish me. But if they say that  in peace and mercy they will spare me expulsion, I disdain and cast away  their mercy, and I ask if they will come to such a trial and expel me. I  defy them. I have constituents to go to, and they will have something  to say if this House expels me, nor will it be long before the gentlemen  will see me here again.\" The fight went on for nearly a fortnight,  and on February 7 the whole subject was finally laid on the table. The  sturdy, dogged fighter, single-handed and alone, had beaten all the  forces of the South and of slavery. No more memorable fight has ever  been made by one man in a parliamentary body, and after this decisive  struggle the tide began to turn. Every year Mr. Adams renewed his motion  to strike out the gag rule, and forced it to a vote. Gradually the  majority against it dwindled, until at last, on December 3, 1844, his  motion prevailed. Freedom of speech had been vindicated in the American  House of Representatives, the right of petition had been won, and the  first great blow against the slave power had been struck.    Four years later Mr. Adams fell, stricken with paralysis, at his place  in the House, and a few hours afterward, with the words, \"This is  the last of earth; I am content,\" upon his lips, he sank into  unconsciousness and died. It was a fit end to a great public career. His  fight for the right of petition is one to be studied and remembered, and  Mr. Adams made it practically alone. The slaveholders of the South and  the representatives of the North were alike against him. Against him,  too, as his biographer, Mr. Morse, says, was the class in Boston to  which he naturally belonged by birth and education. He had to  encounter the bitter resistance in his own set of the \"conscienceless  respectability of wealth,\" but the great body of the New England people  were with him, as were the voters of his own district. He was an old  man, with the physical infirmities of age. His eyes were weak and  streaming; his hands were trembling; his voice cracked in moments of  excitement; yet in that age of oratory, in the days of Webster and Clay,  he was known as the \"old man eloquent.\" It was what he said, more than  the way he said it, which told. His vigorous mind never worked more  surely and clearly than when he stood alone in the midst of an angry  House, the target of their hatred and "]]]
