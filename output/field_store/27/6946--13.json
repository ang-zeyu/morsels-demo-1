The Church revenue amounts to $800,000. There are more than four hundred  priests, monks, and nuns in the capital. The native ecclesiastics are  notorious for their ignorance and immorality. \"It is a very common thing  (says Dr. Terry) for a curate to have a whole flock of orphan nephews  and nieces, the children of an imaginary brother.\" There is one  ex-president who has the reputation of tying a spur on the leg of a  game-cock better even than a curate. The imported Jesuits are the most  intelligent and influential clergy. They control the universities and  colleges, and education generally. Active and intellectual, though not  learned, they have infused new life into the fat indolence of the  Spanish system. Men of this world rather than the next, they have  adopted a purely mundane policy, abjured the gloomy cowl, raised  gorgeous temples, and say, \"He that cometh unto us shall in no wise lose  heaven.\" Their chief merit, however, is the discovery of the turkey and  quinine.    The Protestant in Quito is annoyed by an everlasting jingling of bells  and blowing of bugles night and day. The latter are blown every third  hour. The bells are struck by boys, not rung. A bishop, returning from a  visit to London, was asked if there were any good bells in England.  \"Very fine,\" he replied, \"but there is not a man there who knows how to  ring them.\" Foreign machinery is sprinkled with holy water to neutralize  the inherent heresy; but a miller, for example, will charge more for his  flour after the baptism.    Lotteries are countenanced by both Church and State, and in turn help  support them; we saw one \"grand scheme\" carried out on the cathedral  terrace and defended by bayonets.    At half past nine in the morning all Quito is on its knees, as the great  bell of the cathedral announces the elevation of the Host. The effect is  astonishing. Riders stop their horses; foot-passengers drop down on the  pavement; the cook lets go her dishes and the writer his pen; the  merchant lays aside his measure and the artisan his tool; the  half-uttered oath (_carajo_!) dies on the lips of the Cholo; the arm of  the cruel Zambo, unmercifully beating his donkey, is paralyzed; and the  smart repartee of the lively donna is cut short. The solemn stillness  lasts for a minute, when the bell tolls again, and all rise to work or  play. Holidays are frequent. Processions led by a crucifix or wooden  image are attractive sights in this dull city, simply because little  else is going on. Occasionally a girl richly dressed to represent the  humble mother of God is drawn about in a carriage, and once a year the  figures of the Virgin belonging to different churches are borne with  much pomp to the Plaza, where they bow to each other like automatons.    \"This is a bad country to live in, and a worse one to die in,\" said Dr.  Jameson. But times have changed, even in fossil Quito. Through the  efforts of our late minister, Hon. W.T. Coggeshall, the bigoted  government has at last consented to inclose a quarter of an acre outside  the city for the subterranean burial of heretics. The cemetery is on the  edge of the beautiful plain of Inaquito, and on the right of the road  leading to Guapolo. \"What a shame,\" said a Quitonian lady of position,  \"that there should be a place to throw Protestant dogs!\"    On St. Nathaniel's day died Colonel Phineas Staunton, Vice-Chancellor of  Ingham University, New York. An artist by profession, and one of very  high order, Colonel Staunton joined our expedition to sketch the glories  of the Andes, but he fell a victim to the scourge of the lowlands one  week after his arrival in Quito. We buried him at noon-day[33] in the  new cemetery, \"wherein was never man laid,\" and by the act consecrated  the ground. Peace to his ashes; honor to his memory. That 8th of  September, 1867, was a new day in the annals of Quito. On that day the  imperial city beheld, for the first time in three centuries, the decent  burial of a Protestant in a Protestant cemetery. Somewhere, mingled with  the ashes of Pichincha, is the dust of Atahuallpa, who was buried in his  beloved Quito at his own request after his murder in Caxamarca. But  dearer to us is that solitary grave; the earth is yet fresh that covers  the remains of one of nature's noblemen.    [Footnote 33: This was a new thing under the sun. Quitonians \"bury at  dead of night, with lanterns dimly burning.\" The dirges sung as the  procession winds through the streets are extremely plaintive, and are  the most touching specimens of Ecuadorian music. The corpse, especially  of a child, is often carried in a chair in a sitting posture. The  wealthy class wall up their dead in niches on the side of Pichincha,  hypothetically till the resurrection, but really for two years, when,  unless an additional payment is made, the bones are thrown into a common  pit and the coffin burnt. To prevent this, a few who can afford it  embalm the deceased. One of the most distinguished citizens of Quito  keeps his mummified father at his hacienda, and annually dresses him up  in a new suit of clothes!]    Turn we now to a more delightful topic than the politics and religion of  Quito. The climate is perfect. Fair Italy, with her classic prestige and  ready access, will long be the land of promise to travelers expatriated  in search of health. But if ever the ancients had reached this Andean  valley, they would have located here the Elysian Fields, or the seat of  \"the blessed, the happy, and long-lived\" of Anacreon.[34] No torrid heat  enervates the inhabitant of this favored spot; no icy breezes send him  shivering to the fire. Nobody is sun-struck; nobody's buds are nipped by  the frost. Stoves and chimneys, starvation and epidemics, are unknown.  It is never either spring, summer, or autumn, but each day is a  combination of all three. The mean annual temperature of Quito is 58 deg..8,  the same as Madrid, or as the month of May in Paris. The average range  in twenty-four hours is about 10 deg.. The coldest hour is 6 A.M.; the  warmest between 2 and 3 P.M. The extremes in a year are 45 deg. and 70 deg.;  those of Moscow are-38 deg. and 89 deg.. It is a prevalent opinion that since  the great earthquake of 1797 the temperature has been lower. \"It was  suddenly reduced (says the _Encycl. Metropolitana_) from 66 deg. or 68 deg. to  40 deg. or 45 deg.\"--a manifest error. The natives say that since the  _terremote_ of 1859 the seasons have not commenced so regularly, nor are  they so well defined; there are more rainy days in summer than before.  It remains to be seen whether the late convulsion has affected the  climate.    [Footnote 34: In the mountain-town of Caxamarca, farther south, there  were living in 1792 seven persons aged 114, 117, 121, 131, 132, 141, and  147. One of them, when he died, left behind him eight hundred living  descendants to mourn his loss. We confess, however, that we saw very few  old persons in Quito. Foreigners outlive the natives, because they live  a more regular and temperate life.]    The mean diurnal variation of the barometer is only .084. So regular is  the oscillation, as likewise the variations of the magnetic needle, that  the hour may be known within fifteen minutes by the barometer or  compass. Such is the clock-like order of Nature under the equator, that  even the rains, the most irregular of all meteorological phenomena in  temperate zones, tell approximately the hour of the day. The winds, too,  have an orderly march--the ebb and flow of an aerial ocean. No wonder  watch-tinkers can not live where all the forces in nature keep time.  Nobody talks about the weather; conversation begins with benedictions or  compliments.    The greatest variations of the thermometer occur in autumn, and the  greatest quantity of rain falls in April.[35] While on the western side  of the Andes, south of the equator, the dry season extends from June to  January, on the eastern side of the Cordillera the seasons are reversed,  the rain lasting from March to November. The climate of the central  valley is modified by this opposition of seasons on either side of it,  as also by the proximity of snowy peaks. Nine such peaks stand around  Quito within a circle of thirty miles. The prevailing winds in summer  are from the northeast; in the winter the southwest predominate.    [Footnote 35:    The mean annual fall of rain at Quito is 70 inches.       \"     \"     \"       \"      Charleston is 45.9 inches.       \"     \"     \"       \"      New York is 42.23     \"       \"     \"     \"       \"      Albany is 40.93       \"       \"     \"     \"       \"      Montreal is 36        \"       \"     \"     \"       \"      Madrid is 10.         \"    ]    There are only three small drug-stores in the great city of Quito. The  serpent is used as the badge of apothecary art. Physicians have no  offices, nor do they, as a general rule, call upon their patients. When  an invalid is not able to go to the doctor, he is expected to die.  Yellow fever, cholera, and consumption are unknown; while intermittent  fevers, dysentery, and liver complaints, so prevalent on the coast, are  uncommon. The ordinary diseases are catarrhal affections and typhoid  fever. Cases of inflammation of the lungs are rare; more coughing may be  heard during a Sunday service in a New England meeting-house than in six  months in Quito. The diseases to which the monks of St. Bernard are  liable are pulmonary, and the greater number become asthmatic. Asthma is  also common in Quito, while phthisis increases as we descend to the sea.  Individuals are often seen with a handkerchief about the jaws, or bits  of plaster on the temples; these are afflicted with headache or  toothache, resulting from a gratified passion for sweetmeats, common to  all ages and classes. Digestive disorders are somewhat frequent  (contrary to the theory in Europe), but they spring from improper food  and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19211"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part A.

Selred, his successor, reigned thirty-eight years;  and was the last of the royal line; the failure of which threw the  kingdom into great confusion, and reduced it to dependence under  Mercia.[******] Switherd first acquired the crown, by the concession of  the Mercian princes; and his death made way for Sigeric, who ended his  life in a pilgrimage to Rome. His successor. Sigered, unable to defend  his kingdom, submitted to the victorious arms of Egbert.         [*** Chron. Sax. p. 24].         [**** Lib. ii. cap. 5.]         [***** H. Hunting, lib. iii. Brompton, p. 738,       743. Bede.]         [****** W Malms, lib. i. cap. 6.]          THE KINGDOM OF SUSSEX.    The history of this kingdom, the smallest in the Heptarchy, is still more  imperfect than that of Essex. AElla, the founder of the monarchy, left  the crown to his son Cissa, who is chiefly remarkable for his long reign  of seventy-six years. During his time, the South Saxons fell almost into  a total dependence on the kingdom of Wessex; and we scarcely know the  names of the princes who were possessed of this titular sovereignty.  Adelwalch, the last of them, was subdued in battle by Ceadwalla, king  of Wessex, and was slain in the action; leaving two infant sons, who,  falling into the hand of the conqueror, were murdered by him. The abbot  of Bedford opposed the order for this execution; but could only prevail  on Ceadwalla to suspend it till they should be baptized. Bercthun and  Audhum, two noblemen of character, resisted some time the violence  of the West Saxons; but their opposition served only to prolong the  miseries of their country; and the subduing of this kingdom was the  first step which the West Saxons made towards acquiring the sole  monarchy of England.[*]         [* Brompton, p. 800.]          THE KINGDOM OF WESSEX.    The kingdom of Wessex, which finally swallowed up all the other Saxon  states, met with great resistance on its first establishment; and  the Britons, who were now inured to arms, yielded not tamely their  possessions to those invaders. Cerdic, the founder of the monarchy, and  his son Kenric, fought many successful, and some unsuccessful battles,  against the natives; and the martial spirit, common to all the Saxons,  was, by means of these hostilities, carried to the greatest height among  this tribe. Ceaulin, who was the son and successor of Kenric, and who  began his reign in 560, was still, more ambitious and enterprising than  his predecessors; and by waging continual war against the Britons, he  added a great part of the counties of Devon and Somerset to his other  dominions. Carried along by the tide of success, he invaded the other  Saxon states in his neighborhood, and becoming terrible to all, he  provoked a general confederacy against him. This alliance proved  successful under the conduct of Ethelbert, king of Kent; and Ceaulin,  who had lost the affections of his own subjects by his violent  disposition, and had now fallen into contempt from his misfortunes, was  expelled the throne,[**]and died in exile and misery. Cuichelme, and  Cuthwin, his sons, governed jointly the kingdom, till the expulsion  of the latter in 591, and the death of the former in 593, made way  for Cealric, to whom succeeded Ceobaid in 593, by whose death, which  happened in 611, Kynegils inherited the crown.         [** Chron. Sax. p. 22.]    This prince embraced Christianity,[*] through the persuasion of Oswald,  king of Northumberland, who had married his daughter, and who had  Attained a great ascendant in the Heptarchy. Kenwalch next succeeded to  the monarchy, and dying in 672, left the succession so much disputed,  that Sexburga, his widow, a woman of spirit,[**] kept possession of the  government till her death, which happened two years after. Escwin then  peaceably acquired the crown; and, after a short reign of two years,  made way for Kentwin, who governed nine years. Ceodwalla, his successor,  mounted not the throne without opposition; but proved a great prince,  according to the ideas of those times; that is, he was enterprising,  warlike, and successful. He entirely subdued the kingdom of Sussex, and  annexed it to his own dominions He made inroads into Kent; but met with  resistance from Widred, the king, who proved successful against Mollo,  brother to Ceodwalla, and slew him in a skirmish. Ceodwalla at last,  tired with wars and bloodshed, was seized with a fit of devotion;  bestowed several endowments on the church; and made a pilgrimage to  Rome, where he received baptism, and died in 689. Ina, his successor,  inherited the military virtues of Ceodwalla, and added to them the more  valuable ones of justice, policy, and prudence. He made war upon the  Britons in Somerset; and, having finally subdued that province, he  treated the vanquished with a humanity hitherto unknown to the Saxon  conquerors. He allowed the proprietors to retain possession of their  lands, encouraged marriages and alliances between them and his ancient  subjects, and gave them the privilege of being governed by the same  laws. These laws he augmented and ascertained; and though he was  disturbed by some insurrections at home, his long reign of thirty-seven  years may be regarded as one of the most glorious and most prosperous of  the Heptarchy. In the decline of his age he made a pilgrimage to Rome;  and after his return, shut himself up in a cloister, where he died.         [* Higden, lib. v. Chron. Sax. p. 15. Alured       Beverl p. 94.]         [** Bede, lib. iv. cap., 12. Chron. Sax. p. 41.]    Though the kings of Wessex had always been princes of the blood,  descended from Cerdic, the founder of the monarchy, the order of  succession had been far from exact; and a more remote prince had often  found means to mount the throne, in preference to one descended from a  nearer branch of the royal family. Ina, therefore, having no children  of his own and lying much under the influence of Ethelburga, his queen,  left by will the succession to Adelard, her brother, who was his  remote kinsman; but this destination did not take place without some  difficulty. Oswald, a prince more nearly allied to the crown, took arms  against Adelard; but he being suppressed, and dying soon after, the  title of Adelard was not any further disputed; and in the year 741,  he was succeeded by his cousin Cudred. The reign of this prince was  distinguished by a great victory, which he obtained by means of Edelhun,  his general, over Ethelbald, king of Mercia. His death made way for  Sigebert, his kinsman, who governed so ill, that his people rose in  an insurrection, and dethroned him, crowning Cenulph in his stead. The  exiled prince found a refuge with Duke Cumbran, governor of Hampshire;  who, that he might add new obligations to Sigebert, gave him many  salutary counsels for his future conduct, accompanied with some  reprehensions for the past. But these were so much resented by the  ungrateful prince, that he conspired against the life of his protector,  and treacherously murdered him. After this infamous action, he was  forsaken by all the world; and skulking about in the wilds and forests,  was at last discovered by a servant of Cumbran's, who instantly took  revenge upon him for the murder of his master.[*]      Cenulph, who had obtained the crown on the expulsion of Sigebert, was  fortunate in many expeditions against the Britons of Cornwall; but  afterwards lost some reputation by his ill success against Offa, king  of Mercia.[**] Kynehard also, brother to the deposed Sigebert, gave  him disturbance; and though expelled the kingdom, he hovered on the  frontiers, and watched an opportunity for attacking his rival. The king  had an intrigue with a young woman, who lived at Merton, in Surrey,  whither having secretly retired, he was on a sudden environed, in the  night time, by Kynehard and his followers, and after making a vigorous  resistance, was murdered, with all his attendants. The nobility and  people of the neighborhood, rising next day in arms, took revenge on  Kynehard for the slaughter of their king, and put every one to the sword  who had been engaged in that criminal enterprise. This event happened in  784.         [* Higden, lib. v. W. Malms, lib. i. cap. 2.]         [** W. Malms, lib. i. cap. 2.]    Brthric next obtained possession of the government, though remotely  descended from the royal family; but he enjoyed not that dignity without  inquietude. Eoppa, nephew to King Ina, by his brother Ingild, who died  before that prince, had begot Eata, father to Alchmond, from whom sprung  Egbert,[*] a young man of the most promising hopes, who gave great  jealousy to Brithric, the reigning prince, both because he seemed by his  birth better entitled to the crown, and because he had acquired, to an  eminent degree, the affections of the people. Egbert, sensible of  his danger from the suspicions of Brithric, secretly withdrew into  France;[**] where he was well received by Charlemagne. By living in the  court, and serving in the armies of that prince, the most able and most  generous that had appeared in Europe during several ages, he acquired  those accomplishments which afterwards enabled him to make such a  shining figure on the throne. And familiarizing himself to the manners  of the French, who, as Malmsbury observes,[***] were eminent both for  valor and civility above all the western nations, he learned to polish  the rudeness and barbarity of the Saxon character: his early misfortunes  thus proved of singular advantage to him.      It was not long ere Egbert had opportunities of displaying his natural  and acquired talents. Brithric, king of Wessex, had married Eadburga,  natural daughter of Offa, king of Mercia, a profligate woman, equally  infamous for cruelty and for incontinence. Having great influence over  her husband, she often instigated him to destroy such of the nobility as  were obnoxious to her; and where this"]]]
