[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1557"],[0,"Men of Iron (#14)"],[1,"have stolen their  own water-tank, so that they might have no need for another fight over  the carrying of the water?\"    The bachelors made an obvious show of not having heard what he said, and  a general laugh went around. No one doubted that Wilkes had spoken the  truth in his taunt, and that the bachelors had indeed stolen their own  tank. So no more water was ever carried for the head squires, but it was  plain to see that the war for the upperhand was not yet over.    Even if Myles had entertained comforting thoughts to the contrary, he  was speedily undeceived. One morning, about a week after the fight, as  he and Gascoyne were crossing the armory court, they were hailed by  a group of the bachelors standing at the stone steps of the great  building.    \"Holloa, Falworth!\" they cried. \"Knowest thou that Blunt is nigh well  again?\"    \"Nay,\" said Myles, \"I knew it not. But I am right glad to hear it.\"    \"Thou wilt sing a different song anon,\" said one of the bachelors. \"I  tell thee he is hot against thee, and swears when he cometh again he  will carve thee soothly.\"    \"Aye, marry!\" said another. \"I would not be in thy skin a week hence for  a ducat! Only this morning he told Philip Mowbray that he would have thy  blood for the fall thou gavest him. Look to thyself, Falworth; he cometh  again Wednesday or Thursday next; thou standest in a parlous state.\"    \"Myles,\" said Gascoyne, as they entered the great quadrangle, \"I do  indeed fear me that he meaneth to do thee evil.\"    \"I know not,\" said Myles, boldly; \"but I fear him not.\" Nevertheless his  heart was heavy with the weight of impending ill.    One evening the bachelors were more than usually noisy in their end of  the dormitory, laughing and talking and shouting to one another.    \"Holloa, you sirrah, Falworth!\" called one of them along the length of  the room. \"Blunt cometh again to-morrow day.\"    Myles saw Gascoyne direct a sharp glance at him; but he answered nothing  either to his enemy's words or his friend's look.    As the bachelor had said, Blunt came the next morning. It was just after  chapel, and the whole body of squires was gathered in the armory waiting  for the orders of the day and the calling of the roll of those chosen  for household duty. Myles was sitting on a bench along the wall, talking  and jesting with some who stood by, when of a sudden his heart gave a  great leap within him.    It was Walter Blunt. He came walking in at the door as if nothing had  passed, and at his unexpected coming the hubbub of talk and laughter  was suddenly checked. Even Myles stopped in his speech for a moment, and  then continued with a beating heart and a carelessness of manner that  was altogether assumed. In his hand Blunt carried the house orders for  the day, and without seeming to notice Myles, he opened it and read the  list of those called upon for household service.    Myles had risen, and was now standing listening with the others. When  Blunt had ended reading the list of names, he rolled up the parchment,  and thrust it into his belt; then swinging suddenly on his heel, he  strode straight up to Myles, facing him front to front. A moment or two  of deep silence followed; not a sound broke the stillness. When Blunt  spoke every one in the armory heard his words.    \"Sirrah!\" said he, \"thou didst put foul shame upon me some time sin.  Never will I forget or forgive that offence, and will have a reckoning  with thee right soon that thou wilt not forget to the last day of thy  life.\"    When Myles had seen his enemy turn upon him, he did not know at first  what to expect; he would not have been surprised had they come to blows  there and then, and he held himself prepared for any event. He faced  the other pluckily enough and without flinching, and spoke up boldly in  answer. \"So be it, Walter Blunt; I fear thee not in whatever way thou  mayst encounter me.\"    \"Dost thou not?\" said Blunt. \"By'r Lady, thou'lt have cause to fear me  ere I am through with thee.\" He smiled a baleful, lingering smile, and  then turned slowly and walked away.    \"What thinkest thou, Myles?\" said Gascoyne, as the two left the armory  together.    \"I think naught,\" said Myles gruffly. \"He will not dare to touch me  to harm me. I fear him not.\" Nevertheless, he did not speak the full  feelings of his heart.    \"I know not, Myles,\" said Gascoyne, shaking his head doubtfully. \"Walter  Blunt is a parlous evil-minded knave, and methinks will do whatever evil  he promiseth.\"    \"I fear him not,\" said Myles again; but his heart foreboded trouble.    The coming of the head squire made a very great change in the condition  of affairs. Even before that coming the bachelors had somewhat recovered  from their demoralization, and now again they began to pluck up their  confidence and to order the younger squires and pages upon this personal  service or upon that.    \"See ye not,\" said Myles one day, when the Knights of the Rose were  gathered in the Brutus Tower--\"see ye not that they grow as bad as ever?  An we put not a stop to this overmastery now, it will never stop.\"    \"Best let it be, Myles,\" said Wilkes. \"They will kill thee an thou cease  not troubling them. Thou hast bred mischief enow for thyself already.\"    \"No matter for that,\" said Myles; \"it is not to be borne that they order  others of us about as they do. I mean to speak to them to-night, and  tell them it shall not be.\"    He was as good as his word. That night, as the youngsters were shouting  and romping and skylarking, as they always did before turning in, he  stood upon his cot and shouted: \"Silence! List to me a little!\" And  then, in the hush that followed--\"I want those bachelors to hear this:  that we squires serve them no longer, and if they would ha' some to wait  upon them, they must get them otherwheres than here. There be twenty of  us to stand against them and haply more, and we mean that they shall ha'  service of us no more.\"    Then he jumped down again from his elevated stand, and an uproar of  confusion instantly filled the place. What was the effect of his words  upon the bachelors he could not see. What was the result he was not slow  in discovering.    The next day Myles and Gascoyne were throwing their daggers for a  wager at a wooden target against the wall back of the armorer's smithy.  Wilkes, Gosse, and one or two others of the squires were sitting on  a bench looking on, and now and then applauding a more than usually  well-aimed cast of the knife. Suddenly that impish little page spoken of  before, Robin Ingoldsby, thrust his shock head around the corner of  the smithy, and said: \"Ho, Falworth! Blunt is going to serve thee out  to-day, and I myself heard him say so. He says he is going to slit thine  ears.\" And then he was gone as suddenly as he had appeared.    Myles darted after him, caught him midway in the quadrangle, and brought  him back by the scuff of the neck, squalling and struggling.    \"There!\" said he, still panting from the chase and seating the boy by no  means gently upon the bench beside Wilkes. \"Sit thou there, thou imp of  evil! And now tell me what thou didst mean by thy words anon--an thou  stop not thine outcry, I will cut thy throat for thee,\" and he made a  ferocious gesture with his dagger.    It was by no means easy to worm the story from the mischievous little  monkey; he knew Myles too well to be in the least afraid of his threats.  But at last, by dint of bribing and coaxing, Myles and his friends  managed to get at the facts. The youngster had been sent to clean the  riding-boots of one of the bachelors, instead of which he had lolled  idly on a cot in the dormitory, until he had at last fallen asleep. He  had been awakened by the opening of the dormitory door and by the sound  of voices--among them was that of his taskmaster. Fearing punishment for  his neglected duty, he had slipped out of the cot, and hidden himself  beneath it.    Those who had entered were Walter Blunt and three of the older  bachelors. Blunt's companions were trying to persuade him against  something, but without avail. It was--Myles's heart thrilled and his  blood boiled--to lie in wait for him, to overpower him by numbers,  and to mutilate him by slitting his ears--a disgraceful punishment  administered, as a rule, only for thieving and poaching.    \"He would not dare to do such a thing!\" cried Myles, with heaving breast  and flashing eyes.    \"Aye, but he would,\" said Gascoyne. \"His father, Lord Reginald Blunt,  is a great man over Nottingham way, and my Lord would not dare to punish  him even for such a matter as that. But tell me, Robin Ingoldsby, dost  know aught more of this matter? Prithee tell it me, Robin. Where do they  propose to lie in wait for Falworth?\"    \"In the gate-way of the Buttery Court, so as to catch him when he passes  by to the armory,\" answered the boy.    \"Are they there now?\" said Wilkes.    \"Aye, nine of them,\" said Robin. \"I heard Blunt tell Mowbray to go and  gather the others. He heard thee tell Gosse, Falworth, that thou wert  going thither for thy arbalist this morn to shoot at the rooks withal.\"    \"That will do, Robin,\" said Myles. \"Thou mayst go.\"    And therewith the little imp scurried off, pulling the lobes of his ears  suggestively as he darted around the corner.    The others looked at one another for a while in silence.    \"So, comrades,\" said Myles at last, \"what shall we do now?\"    \"Go, and tell Sir James,\" said Gascoyne, promptly.    \"Nay,\" said Myles, \"I take no such coward's part as that. I say an they  hunger to fight, give them their stomachful.\"    The others were very reluctant for such extreme measures, but Myles, as  usual, carried his way, and so a pitched battle was decided upon. It was  Gascoyne who suggested the plan which they afterwards followed.    Then Wilkes started away to gather together those of the Knights of the  Rose not upon household duty, and Myles, with the others, went to the  armor smith to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15580"],[0,"The Rustlers of Pecos County (#14)"],[1,"fight for your father,\" I went on.  \"Perhaps you don't understand. He has ruled here for long. He's  been--well, let's say, easy with the evil-doers. But times are changing.  He opposed the Ranger idea, which is also natural, I suppose. Still,  he's wrong about Steele, terribly wrong, and it means trouble.\"    \"Oh, I don't know what to believe!\"    \"It might be well for you to think things out for yourself.\"    \"Russ, I feel as though I couldn't. I can't make head or tail of life  out here. My father seems so strange. Though, of course, I've only seen  him twice a year since I was a little girl. He has two sides to him.  When I come upon that strange side, the one I never knew, he's like a  man I never saw.    \"I want to be a good and loving daughter. I want to help him fight his  battles. But he doesn't--he doesn't _satisfy_ me. He's grown impatient  and wants me to go back to Louisiana. That gives me a feeling of  mystery. Oh, it's _all_ mystery!\"    \"True, you're right,\" I replied, my heart aching for her. \"It's all  mystery--and trouble for you, too. Perhaps you'd do well to go home.\"    \"Russ, you suggest I leave here--leave my father?\" she asked.    \"I advise it. You struck a--a rather troublesome time. Later you might  return if--\"    \"Never. I came to stay, and I'll stay,\" she declared, and there her  temper spoke.    \"Miss Sampson,\" I began again, after taking a long, deep breath, \"I  ought to tell you one thing more about Steele.\"    \"Well, go on.\"    \"Doesn't he strike you now as being the farthest removed from a ranting,  brutal Ranger?\"    \"I confess he was at least a gentleman.\"    \"Rangers don't allow anything to interfere with the discharge of their  duty. He was courteous after you defamed him. He respected your wish. He  did not break up the dance.    \"This may not strike you particularly. But let me explain that Steele  was chasing an outlaw who had shot him. Under ordinary circumstances he  would have searched your house. He would have been like a lion. He would  have torn the place down around our ears to get that rustler.    \"But his action was so different from what I had expected, it amazed me.  Just now, when I was with him, I learned, I guessed, what stayed his  hand. I believe you ought to know.\"    \"Know what?\" she asked. How starry and magnetic her eyes! A woman's  divining intuition made them wonderful with swift-varying emotion.    They drew me on to the fatal plunge. What was I doing to her--to Vaughn?  Something bound my throat, making speech difficult.    \"He's fallen in love with you,\" I hurried on in a husky voice. \"Love at  first sight! Terrible! Hopeless! I saw it--felt it. I can't explain how  I know, but I do know.    \"That's what stayed his hand here. And that's why I'm on his side. He's  alone. He has a terrible task here without any handicaps. Every man is  against him. If he fails, you might be the force that weakened him. So  you ought to be kinder in your thought of him. Wait before you judge him  further.    \"If he isn't killed, time will prove him noble instead of vile. If he is  killed, which is more than likely, you'll feel the happier for a  generous doubt in favor of the man who loved you.\"    Like one stricken blind, she stood an instant; then, with her hands at  her breast, she walked straight across the patio into the dark, open  door of her room.          Chapter 5    CLEANING OUT LINROCK      Not much sleep visited me that night. In the morning, the young ladies  not stirring and no prospects of duty for me, I rode down to town.    Sight of the wide street, lined by its hitching posts and saddled  horses, the square buildings with their ugly signs, unfinished yet old,  the lounging, dust-gray men at every corner--these awoke in me a  significance that had gone into oblivion overnight.    That last talk with Miss Sampson had unnerved me, wrought strangely upon  me. And afterward, waking and dozing, I had dreamed, lived in a warm,  golden place where there were music and flowers and Sally's spritelike  form leading me on after two tall, beautiful lovers, Diane and Vaughn,  walking hand in hand.    Fine employment of mind for a Ranger whose single glance down a quiet  street pictured it with darkgarbed men in grim action, guns spouting  red, horses plunging!    In front of Hoden's restaurant I dismounted and threw my bridle. Jim was  unmistakably glad to see me.    \"Where've you been? Morton was in an' powerful set on seein' you. I  steered him from goin' up to Sampson's. What kind of a game was you  givin' Frank?\"    \"Jim, I just wanted to see if he was a safe rancher to make a stock deal  for me.\"    \"He says you told him he didn't have no yellow streak an' that he was a  rustler. Frank can't git over them two hunches. When he sees you he's  goin' to swear he's no rustler, but he _has_ got a yellow streak,  unless...\"    This little, broken-down Texan had eyes like flint striking fire.    \"Unless?\" I queried sharply.    Jim breathed a deep breath and looked around the room before his gaze  fixed again on mine.    \"Wal,\" he replied, speaking low, \"Me and Frank allows you've picked the  right men. It was me that sent them letters to the Ranger captain at  Austin. Now who in hell are you?\"    It was my turn to draw a deep breath.    I had taken six weeks to strike fire from a Texan whom I instinctively  felt had been prey to the power that shadowed Linrock. There was no one  in the room except us, no one passing, nor near.    Reaching into the inside pocket of my buckskin vest, I turned the lining  out. A star-shaped, bright, silver object flashed as I shoved it, pocket  and all, under Jim's hard eyes.    He could not help but read; United States Deputy Marshall.    \"By golly,\" he whispered, cracking the table with his fist. \"Russ, you  sure rung true to me. But never as a cowboy!\"    \"Jim, the woods is full of us!\"    Heavy footsteps sounded on the walk. Presently Steele's bulk darkened  the door.    \"Hello,\" I greeted. \"Steele, shake hands with Jim Hoden.\"    \"Hello,\" replied Steele slowly. \"Say, I reckon I know Hoden.\"    \"Nit. Not this one. He's the old Hoden. He used to own the Hope So  saloon. It was on the square when he ran it. Maybe he'll get it back  pretty soon. Hope so!\"    I laughed at my execrable pun. Steele leaned against the counter, his  gray glance studying the man I had so oddly introduced.    Hoden in one flash associated the Ranger with me--a relation he had not  dreamed of. Then, whether from shock or hope or fear I know not, he  appeared about to faint.    \"Hoden, do you know who's boss of this secret gang of rustlers  hereabouts?\" asked Steele bluntly.    It was characteristic of him to come sharp to the point. His voice,  something deep, easy, cool about him, seemed to steady Hoden.    \"No,\" replied Hoden.    \"Does anybody know?\" went on Steele.    \"Wal, I reckon there's not one honest native of Pecos who _knows_.\"    \"But you have your suspicions?\"    \"We have.\"    \"You can keep your suspicions to yourself. But you can give me your idea  about this crowd that hangs round the saloons, the regulars.\"    \"Jest a bad lot,\" replied Hoden, with the quick assurance of knowledge.  \"Most of them have been here years. Others have drifted in. Some of them  work odd times. They rustle a few steer, steal, rob, anythin' for a  little money to drink an' gamble. Jest a bad lot!    \"But the strangers as are always comin' an' goin'--strangers that never  git acquainted--some of them are likely to be _the_ rustlers. Bill an'  Bo Snecker are in town now. Bill's a known cattle-thief. Bo's no good,  the makin' of a gun-fighter. He heads thet way.    \"They might be rustlers. But the boy, he's hardly careful enough for  this gang. Then there's Jack Blome. He comes to town often. He lives up  in the hills. He always has three or four strangers with him. Blome's  the fancy gun fighter. He shot a gambler here last fall. Then he was in  a fight in Sanderson lately. Got two cowboys then.    \"Blome's killed a dozen Pecos men. He's a rustler, too, but I reckon  he's not the brains of thet secret outfit, if he's in it at all.\"    Steele appeared pleased with Hoden's idea. Probably it coincided with  the one he had arrived at himself.    \"Now, I'm puzzled over this,\" said Steele. \"Why do men, apparently  honest men, seem to be so close-mouthed here? Is that a fact or only my  impression?\"    \"It's sure a fact,\" replied Hoden darkly. \"Men have lost cattle an'  property in Linrock--lost them honestly or otherwise, as hasn't been  proved. An' in some cases when they talked--hinted a little--they was  found dead. Apparently held up an' robbed. But dead. Dead men don't  talk. Thet's why we're close-mouthed.\"    Steele's face wore a dark, somber sternness.    Rustling cattle was not intolerable. Western Texas had gone on  prospering, growing in spite of the horde of rustlers ranging its vast  stretches; but this cold, secret, murderous hold on a little struggling  community was something too strange, too terrible for men to stand long.    It had waited for a leader like Steele, and now it could not last.  Hoden's revived spirit showed that.    The ranger was about to speak again when the clatter of hoofs  interrupted him. Horses halted out in front.    A motion of Steele's hand caused me to dive through a curtained door  back of Hoden's counter. I turned to peep out and was in time to see  George Wright enter with the red-headed cowboy called Brick.    That was the first time I had ever seen Wright come into Hoden's. He  called for tobacco.    If his visit surprised Jim he did not show any evidence. But Wright  showed astonishment as he saw the Ranger, and then a dark glint flitted  from the eyes that shifted from Steele to Hoden and back again.    Steele leaned easily against the counter, and he said good morning  pleasantly. Wright deigned no reply, although he bent a curious and hard  scrutiny upon Steele. In fact, Wright evinced nothing that would lead  one to"]]]
