These events took place during the period of  military inaction which followed the victories of Arcola. The new  Republics hastened to repay Napoleon's favour by raising troops, and  placed at his disposal a force which he considered as sufficient to keep  the Papal army in check during the expected renewal of Alvinzi's  efforts.    Buonaparte at this period practised every art to make himself popular  with the Italians; nor was it of little moment that they in fact  regarded him more as their own countryman than a Frenchman; that their  beautiful language was his mother tongue; that he knew their manners and  their literature, and even in his conquering rapacity displayed his  esteem for their arts. He was wise enough too, on farther familiarity  with the state of the country, to drop that tone of hostility which he  had at first adopted towards the priesthood; and to cultivate the most  influential members of that powerful order by attentions which the  Directory heard of with wonder, and would have heard of, had he been any  other than Napoleon, with scorn and contempt.[12] Wherever he could  have personal intercourse with the priesthood, he seems to have  considerably softened their spleen. Meanwhile the clergy beyond the  Apennines, and the nobility of Romagna, were combining all their efforts  to rouse the population against him; and the Pope, pushed, as we have  seen, to despair by the French Directory, had no reason to complain that  his secular vassals heard such appeals with indifference.    Alvinzi's preparations were in the meantime rapidly advancing. The  enthusiasm of the Austrian gentry was effectually stirred by the  apprehension of seeing the conqueror of Italy under the walls of Vienna,  and volunteer corps were formed everywhere and marched upon the  frontier. The gallant peasantry of the Tyrol had already displayed their  zeal; nor did the previous reverses of Alvinzi prevent them from once  more crowding to his standard. Napoleon proclaimed that every Tyrolese  caught in arms should be shot as a brigand. Alvinzi replied, that for  every murdered peasant he would hang a French prisoner of war:  Buonaparte rejoined, that the first execution of this threat would be  instantly followed by the gibbeting of Alvinzi's own nephew, who was in  his hands. These ferocious threats were laid aside, when time had been  given for reflection; and either general prepared to carry on the war  according to the old rules, which are at least sufficiently severe.    Alvinzi sent a peasant across the country to find his way if possible  into the beleaguered city of Mantua, and give Wurmser notice that he was  once more ready to attempt his relief. The veteran was commanded to make  what diversion he could in favour of the approaching army; and if things  came to the worst, to fight his way out of Mantua, retire on Romagna,  and put himself at the head of the Papal forces. The spy who carried  these tidings was intercepted, and dragged into the presence of  Napoleon. The terrified man confessed that he had swallowed the ball of  wax in which the despatch was wrapped. His stomach was compelled to  surrender its contents; and Buonaparte prepared to meet his enemy.  Leaving Serrurier to keep up the blockade of Mantua, he hastened to  resume his central position at Verona, from which he could, according to  circumstances, march with convenience on whatever line the Austrian main  body might choose for their advance.    The Imperialists, as if determined to profit by no lesson, once more  descended from the Tyrol upon two different lines of march; Alvinzi  himself choosing that of the Upper Adige; while Provera headed a second  army, with orders to follow the Brenta, and then, striking across to the  Lower Adige, join the marshal before the walls of Mantua. Could they  have combined their forces there, and delivered Wurmser, there was  hardly a doubt that the French must retreat before so vast an army as  would then have faced them. But Napoleon was destined once more to  dissipate all these victorious dreams. He had posted Joubert at Rivoli,  to dispute that important position, should the campaign open with an  attempt to force it by Alvinzi; while Augereau's division was to watch  the march of Provera. He remained himself at Verona until he could learn  with certainty by which of these generals the first grand assault was to  be made. On the evening of the 13th of January, tidings were brought him  that Joubert had all that day been maintaining his ground with  difficulty; and he instantly hastened to what now appeared to be the  proper scene of action for himself.    Arriving about two in the morning (by another of his almost incredible  forced marches) on the heights of Rivoli, he, the moonlight being clear,  could distinguish five separate encampments, with innumerable  watch-fires, in the valley below. His lieutenant, confounded by the  display of this gigantic force, was in the very act of abandoning the  position. Napoleon instantly checked this movement; and bringing up more  battalions, forced the Croats from an eminence which they had already  seized on the first symptoms of the French retreat. Napoleon's keen eye,  surveying the position of the five encampments below, penetrated the  secret of Alvinzi; namely, that his artillery had not yet arrived,  otherwise he would not have occupied ground so distant from the object  of attack. He concluded that the Austrian did not mean to make his  grand assault very early in the morning, and resolved to force him to  anticipate that movement. For this purpose, he took all possible pains  to conceal his own arrival; and prolonged, by a series of petty  manoeuvres, the enemy's belief that he had to do with a mere outpost of  the French. Alvinzi swallowed the deceit; and, instead of advancing on  some great and well-arranged system, suffered his several columns to  endeavour to force the heights by insulated movements, which the real  strength of Napoleon easily enabled him to baffle. It is true that at  one moment the bravery of the Germans had nearly overthrown the French  on a point of pre-eminent importance; but Napoleon himself galloping to  the spot, roused by his voice and action the division of Massena, who,  having marched all night, had lain down to rest in the extreme of  weariness, and seconded by them and their gallant general,[13] swept  everything before him. The French artillery was in position: the  Austrian (according to Napoleon's shrewd guess) had not yet come up, and  this circumstance decided the fortune of the day. The cannonade from the  heights, backed by successive charges of horse and foot, rendered every  attempt to storm the summit abortive; and the main body of the  Imperialists was already in confusion, and, indeed, in flight, before  one of their divisions, which had been sent round to outflank  Buonaparte, and take higher ground in his rear, was able to execute its  errand. When, accordingly, this division (that of Lusignan) at length  achieved its destined object--it did so, not to complete the misery of a  routed, but to swell the prey of a victorious enemy. Instead of cutting  off the retreat of Joubert, Lusignan found himself insulated from  Alvinzi, and forced to lay down his arms to Buonaparte. \"Here was a good  plan,\" said Napoleon, \"but these Austrians are not apt to calculate the  value of minutes.\" Had Lusignan gained the rear of the French an hour  earlier, while the contest was still hot in front of the heights of  Rivoli, he might have made the 14th of January one of the darkest,  instead of one of the brightest days, in the military chronicles of  Napoleon.    He, who in the course of this trying day had three horses shot under  him, hardly waited to see Lusignan surrender, and to entrust his  friends, Massena, Murat, and Joubert, with the task of pursuing the  flying columns of Alvinzi. He had heard during the battle, that Provera  had forced his way to the Lago di Guarda, and was already, by means of  boats, in communication with Mantua. The force of Augereau having proved  insufficient to oppose the march of the Imperialists' second column, it  was high time that Napoleon himself should hurry with reinforcements to  the Lower Adige, and prevent Wurmser from either housing Provera, or  joining him in the open field, and so effecting the escape of his own  still formidable garrison whether to the Tyrol or the Romagna.    Having marched all night and all next day, Napoleon reached the vicinity  of Mantua late on the 15th. He found the enemy strongly posted, and  Serrurier's situation highly critical. A regiment of Provera's hussars  had but a few hours before nearly established themselves in the suburb  of St. George. This Austrian corps had been clothed in white cloaks,  resembling those of a well-known French regiment; and advancing towards  the gate, would certainly have been admitted as friends--but for the  sagacity of one sergeant, who could not help fancying that the white  cloaks had too much of the gloss of novelty about them, to have stood  the tear and wear of three Buonapartean campaigns. This danger had been  avoided, but the utmost vigilance was necessary. The French general  himself passed the night in walking about the outposts, so great was his  anxiety.    At one of these he found a grenadier asleep by the root of a tree; and  taking his gun, without wakening him, performed a sentinel's duty in his  place for about half an hour; when the man, starting from his slumbers,  perceived with terror and despair the countenance and occupation of his  general. He fell on his knees before him. \"My friend,\" said Napoleon,  \"here is your musket. You had fought hard, and marched long, and your  sleep is excusable; but a moment's inattention might at present ruin the  army. I happened to be awake, and have held your post"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17587"],[0,"Field Hospital and Flying Column (#14)"],[1,"of Warsaw. To  the casual observer it looks a busy, modern, rather gay capital, but  almost every inch of the city is interesting historically, and nearly  all the pages of that history are red with blood. War, revolutions, and  riots seem to have been almost its normal condition, and the great broad  Vistula that flows sluggishly through it has been many a time before  stained crimson with the blood of its citizens. But this time the war is  being fought under different conditions. Russians and Poles are for the  first time working together with a common aim in view. If the only  outcome of this war was the better mutual understanding of these two  great nations, it would not have been fought entirely in vain.    When we first arrived the Russians had beaten the Germans back to the  frontier, and every one was elated with the great victory. Now at the  end of October things did not look quite so happy. The people who knew  looked anxious and harassed. The newspapers, as usual, told nothing at  all, but the news which always filters in somehow from mouth to mouth  was not good. Terrific fighting was going on outside Lodz, it was said,  and enormous German reinforcements were being poured in. Warsaw was full  to overflowing with troops going through to reinforce on the Russian  side. A splendid set of men they looked, sturdy, broad-chested, and  hardy--not in the least smart, but practical and efficient in their warm  brown overcoats and big top boots.    There are two things one notices at once about the Russian soldier. One  is his absolute disregard of appearances. If he is cold he will tie a  red comforter round his head without minding in the least whether he is  in the most fashionable street in Warsaw or in camp at the front. The  other noticeable characteristic is the friendly terms he is on with his  officers. The Prussian soldiers rarely seem to like their officers, and  it is not to be wondered at, as they treat their men in a very harsh,  overbearing way. On duty the Russian discipline is strict, but off duty  an officer may be heard addressing one of his men as \"little pigeon\" or  \"comrade\" and other terms of endearment, and the soldier, on the other  hand, will call his officer \"little father\" or \"little brother.\" I  remember one most touching scene when a soldier servant accompanied his  wounded officer to hospital. The officer was quite a young,  delicate-looking boy, who had been shot through the chest. His servant  was a huge, rough Cossack, who would hardly let any of us touch his  master if he could help it, and stayed by his bed night and day till the  end, when, his great frame heaving with sobs and tears streaming down  the seamed and rugged face, he threw himself over the officer's body and  implored God to let him die too.    The hospital began to grow empty and the work slackened down, as every  possible patient was sent away to Moscow or Petrograd to make room for  the rush of wounded that must be coming from the Lodz direction. But no  patients arrived, and we heard that the railway communications had been  cut. But this proved to be untrue.    One Sunday afternoon Sister G. and I, being free, betook ourselves to  tea at the Hotel d'Europe--that well-named hostelry which has probably  seen more history made from its windows than any other hotel in Europe.  We favoured it always on Sunday when we could, for not only was a  particularly nice tea to be had, but one could also read there a not  _too_ old French newspaper. I think just at first we felt almost as cut  off from news of what was happening on the English side as we did in  Belgium. No English or French papers could be bought and the Polish and  Russian papers were as sealed books to us, and when I did succeed in  getting some long-suffering person to translate them to me, the news was  naturally chiefly of the doings of the Russian side. Later on I had  English papers sent out to me which kept me in touch with the western  front, and also by that time, too, I could make out the substance of the  Russian papers; but just at first it was very trying not to know what  was going on. We had had tea and had read of an Anglo-French success  near Ypres and returned rested and cheered to the hospital to find  Sister Superior asking for us. She had had a message from the Red Cross  Office that we were to go to Lodz next day, and were to go at once to  the Hotel Bristol to meet Prince V., who would give us full particulars.    We went off at once to the Bristol and saw Prince V., but did not get  any particulars--that was not the Prince's way. He was sitting reading  in the lounge when we arrived, a very tall, lean, handsome man with kind  brown eyes and a nose hooked like an eagle's. He greeted us very kindly  and said he would take us to Lodz next day in one of the Red Cross  automobiles, and that we must be ready at 10 A. M. I think we  earned his everlasting gratitude by asking no questions as to where and  how we were going to work, but simply said we would be ready at that  time and returned to hospital to pack, fully realizing what lucky people  we were to be going right into the thick of things, and only hoping that  we should rise to the occasion and do the utmost that was expected of  us.    We were now officially transferred from the hospital to the Flying  Column, of which Prince V. was the head. A flying column works directly  under the head of the Red Cross, and is supposed to go anywhere and do  anything at any hour of the day or night. Our Column consisted of five  automobiles that conveyed us and all our equipment to the place where we  were to work, and then were engaged in fetching in wounded, and taking  them on to the field hospital or ambulance train. The staff consisted of  Prince and Princess V., we two English Sisters, with generally, but not  always, some Russian ones in addition, an English surgeon, Colonel S.,  some Russian dressers and students, and some sanitars, or orderlies. The  luggage was a dreadful problem, and the Prince always groaned at the  amount we would take with us, but we could not reduce it, as we had to  carry big cases of cotton-wool, bandages and dressings, anaesthetics,  field sterilizer, operating-theatre equipment, and a certain amount of  stores--such as soap, candles, benzine and tinned food--as the column  would have been quite useless if it had not been to a large extent  self-supporting. Our Column was attached to the Second Army, which  operated on the eastern front of Warsaw. The Russian front changes so  much more rapidly than the Anglo-French front, where progress is  reckoned in metres, that these mobile columns are a great feature of  ambulance work here. Our front changed many miles in a week sometimes,  so that units that can move anywhere at an hour's notice are very  useful. The big base hospitals cannot quite fulfil the same need on such  a rapidly changing front.          VIII    THE BOMBARDMENT OF LODZ      It took us a long time to get to Lodz, though it is not much more than  200 kilometres away. Russian roads are villainously bad anyhow, and the  Germans, though their retreat had been hasty, had had time to destroy  the roads and bridges as they went. Another thing that delayed us were  the enormous reinforcements of troops going up from Warsaw to the front.  It was very interesting to watch the different groups as we passed,  first a Cossack regiment going up, then an immense convoy followed with  about 200 wagons of forage. Just ahead of that we passed the  remounts--sturdy, shaggy Siberian ponies. They are the most delightful  creatures in the world, as tame as a dog, and not much bigger, and many  of them of a most unusual and beautiful shade of golden cream. They have  been brought from Siberia by the thousand, and most of the little  things had never seen a motor-car before, and pranced and kicked and  jumped, and went through all kinds of circus tricks as we passed.    [Illustration: MAP OF THE POLISH FRONT]    As we grew nearer to Lodz it was sad to see a good many dead horses  lying by the roadside, mostly killed by shell-fire. The shells had made  great holes in the road too, and the last part of our journey was like a  ride on a switchback railway. It began to get dark as we came to  Breeziny, where a large number of Russian batteries were stationed. It  looked very jolly there, these large camps of men and horses having  their supper by the light of a camp-fire, with only the distant rumble  of the guns to remind them that they were at war. Two hours later we  jolted into the streets of Lodz.    Lodz is a large cotton manufacturing town--sometimes called the  Manchester of Poland--but now of course all the factories were closed,  and many destroyed by shell. I should not think it was a very festive  place at the best of times; it looked squalid and grimy, and the large  bulk of its population was made up of the most abject Jews I have ever  seen.    We had to make a long detour and get into the town by an unfrequented  country road, as Lodz was being heavily bombarded by the German guns. We  were put down at a large building which we were told was the military  hospital. Princess V., Colonel S., and a Russian student were working  hard in the operating-room, and we hastily put on clean overalls and  joined them. They all looked absolutely worn out, and the doctor dropped  asleep between each case; but fresh wounded were being brought in every  minute and there was no one else to help. Lodz was one big hospital. We  heard that there were more than 18,000 wounded there, and I can well  believe it. Every building of any size had been turned into a hospital,  and almost all the supplies of every kind had given out.    The building we were in had been a day-school, and the top floor was  made up of large airy schoolrooms that were quite suitable for wards.  But the shelling recommenced so violently that the wounded all had to be  moved down to the"]]]
