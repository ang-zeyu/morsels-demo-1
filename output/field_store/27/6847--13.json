CHAPTER V    TRANSITION FROM RITUAL TO ART: THE DROMENON (\"THING DONE\") AND THE DRAMA      Probably most people when they go to a Greek play for the first time  think it a strange performance. According, perhaps, more to their  temperament than to their training, they are either very much excited or  very much bored. In many minds there will be left a feeling that,  whether they have enjoyed the play or not, they are puzzled: there are  odd effects, conventions, suggestions.    For example, the main deed of the Tragedy, the slaying of hero or  heroine, is not done on the stage. That disappoints some modern minds  unconsciously avid of realism to the point of horror. Instead of a fine  thrilling murder or suicide before his very eyes, the spectator is put  off with an account of the murder done off the stage. This account is  regularly given, and usually at considerable length, in a \"messenger's  speech.\" The messenger's speech is a regular item in a Greek play, and  though actually it gives scope not only for fine elocution, but for real  dramatic effect, in theory we feel it undramatic, and a modern actor has  sometimes much ado to make it acceptable. The spectator is told that all  these, to him, odd conventions are due to Greek restraint, moderation,  good taste, and yet for all their supposed restraint and reserve, he  finds when he reads his Homer that Greek heroes frequently burst into  floods of tears when a self-respecting Englishman would have suffered in  silence.    Then again, specially if the play be by Euripides, it ends not with a  \"curtain,\" not with a great decisive moment, but with the appearance of  a god who says a few lines of either exhortation or consolation or  reconciliation, which, after the strain and stress of the action itself,  strikes some people as rather stilted and formal, or as rather flat and  somehow unsatisfying. Worse still, there are in many of the scenes long  dialogues, in which the actors wrangle with each other, and in which the  action does not advance so quickly as we wish. Or again, instead of  beginning with the action, and having our curiosity excited bit by bit  about the plot, at the outset some one comes in and tells us the whole  thing in the prologue. Prologues we feel, are out of date, and the  Greeks ought to have known better. Or again, of course we admit that  tragedy must be tragic, and we are prepared for a decent amount of  lamentation, but when an antiphonal lament goes on for pages, we weary  and wish that the chorus would stop lamenting and _do_ something.           *       *       *       *       *    At the back of our modern discontent there is lurking always this queer  anomaly of the chorus. We have in our modern theatre no chorus, and  when, in the opera, something of the nature of a chorus appears in the  ballet, it is a chorus that really dances to amuse and excite us in the  intervals of operatic action; it is not a chorus of doddering and  pottering old men, moralizing on an action in which they are too feeble  to join. Of course if we are classical scholars we do not cavil at the  choral songs; the extreme difficulty of scanning and construing them  alone commands a traditional respect; but if we are merely modern  spectators, we may be respectful, we may even feel strangely excited,  but we are certainly puzzled. The reason of our bewilderment is simple  enough. These prologues and messengers' speeches and ever-present  choruses that trouble us are ritual forms still surviving at a time when  the _drama_ has fully developed out of the _dromenon_. We cannot here  examine all these ritual forms in detail;[35] one, however, the chorus,  strangest and most beautiful of all, it is essential we should  understand.    Suppose that these choral songs have been put into English that in any  way represents the beauty of the Greek; then certainly there will be  some among the spectators who get a thrill from the chorus quite unknown  to any modern stage effect, a feeling of emotion heightened yet  restrained, a sense of entering into higher places, filled with a larger  and a purer air--a sense of beauty born clean out of conflict and  disaster.    A suspicion dawns upon the spectator that, great though the tragedies in  themselves are, they owe their peculiar, their incommunicable beauty  largely to this element of the chorus which seemed at first so strange.    Now by examining this chorus and understanding its function--nay, more,  by considering the actual _orchestra_, the space on which the chorus  danced, and the relation of that space to the rest of the theatre, to  the stage and the place where the spectators sat--we shall get light at  last on our main central problem: How did art arise out of ritual, and  what is the relation of both to that actual life from which both art and  ritual sprang?           *       *       *       *       *    The dramas of AEschylus certainly, and perhaps also those of Sophocles  and Euripides, were played not upon the stage, and not in the _theatre_,  but, strange though it sounds to us, in the _orchestra_. The _theatre_  to the Greeks was simply \"the place of seeing,\" the place where the  spectators sat; what they called the sk{-e}n{-e} or _scene_, was the  tent or hut in which the actors dressed. But the kernel and centre of  the whole was the _orchestra_, the circular _dancing-place_ of the  chorus; and, as the orchestra was the kernel and centre of the theatre,  so the chorus, the band of dancing and singing men--this chorus that  seems to us so odd and even superfluous--was the centre and kernel and  starting-point of the drama. The chorus danced and sang that Dithyramb  we know so well, and from the leaders of that Dithyramb we remember  tragedy arose, and the chorus were at first, as an ancient writer tells  us, just men and boys, tillers of the earth, who danced when they rested  from sowing and ploughing.    Now it is in the relation between the _orchestra_ or dancing-place of  the chorus, and the _theatre_ or place of the spectators, a relation  that shifted as time went on, that we see mirrored the whole development  from ritual to art--from _dromenon_ to drama.           *       *       *       *       *    The orchestra on which the Dithyramb was danced was just a circular  dancing-place beaten flat for the convenience of the dancers, and  sometimes edged by a stone basement to mark the circle. This circular  orchestra is very well seen in the theatre of Epidaurus, of which a  sketch is given in Fig. 1. The orchestra here is surrounded by a  splendid _theatron_, or spectator place, with seats rising tier above  tier. If we want to realize the primitive Greek orchestra or  dancing-place, we must think these stone seats away. Threshing-floors  are used in Greece to-day as convenient dancing-places. The dance  tends to be circular because it is round some sacred thing, at first a  maypole, or the reaped corn, later the figure of a god or his altar. On  this dancing-place the whole body of worshippers would gather, just as  now-a-days the whole community will assemble on a village green. There  is no division at first between actors and spectators; all are actors,  all are doing the thing done, dancing the dance danced. Thus at  initiation ceremonies the whole tribe assembles, the only spectators are  the uninitiated, the women and children. No one at this early stage  thinks of building a _theatre_, a spectator place. It is in the common  act, the common or collective emotion, that ritual starts. This must  never be forgotten.    [Illustration: Fig. 1. Theatre of Epidaurus Showing Circular Orchestra.]    The most convenient spot for a mere dancing-place is some flat place.  But any one who travels through Greece will notice instantly that all  the Greek theatres that remain at Athens, at Epidaurus, at Delos,  Syracuse, and elsewhere, are built against the side of hills. None of  these are very early; the earliest ancient orchestra we have is at  Athens. It is a simple stone ring, but it is built against the steep  south side of the Acropolis. The oldest festival of Dionysos was, as  will presently be seen, held in quite another spot, in the _agora_, or  market-place. The reason for moving the dance was that the wooden seats  that used to be set up on a sort of \"grand stand\" in the market-place  fell down, and it was seen how safely and comfortably the spectators  could be seated on the side of a steep hill.    The spectators are a new and different element, the dance is not only  danced, but it is watched from a distance, it is a spectacle; whereas in  old days all or nearly all were worshippers acting, now many, indeed  most, are spectators, watching, feeling, thinking, not doing. It is in  this new attitude of the spectator that we touch on the difference  between ritual and art; the _dromenon_, the thing actually done by  yourself has become a _drama_, a thing also done, but abstracted from  your doing. Let us look for a moment at the psychology of the spectator,  at his behaviour.           *       *       *       *       *    Artists, it is often said, and usually felt, are so unpractical. They  are always late for dinner, they forget to post their letters and to  return the books or even money that is lent them. Art is to most  people's minds a sort of luxury, not a necessity. In but recently bygone  days music, drawing, and dancing were no part of a training for ordinary  life, they were taught at school as \"accomplishments,\" paid for as  \"extras.\" Poets on their side equally used to contrast art and life, as  though they were things essentially distinct.        \"Art is long, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17132"],[0,"The Makers of Canada: Champlain (#14)"],[1,"Bay, 1615    From the painting by Humme]    On July 12th Father Le Caron celebrated mass and sang the _Te Deum_,  after which the Indians planted a cross near the small chapel which had  been erected under Champlain's direction. The reverend father occupied a  hut within the palisade which formed the rampart of the village, and he  spent the fall and winter with the Hurons of Carhagouha.    The Huron country was situated between the peninsula watered by Lake  Simcoe on the eastern side, and by the Georgian Bay on the western side.  It extended from north to south between the rivers Severn and  Nottawasaga. This land is twenty-five leagues in length and seven or  eight in width. The soil, though sandy, was fertile and produced in  abundance corn, beans, pumpkins and the annual helianth or sun-flower,  from which the Hurons extracted the oil. The neighbouring tribes, such  as the Ottawas and the Algonquins, used to procure their provisions from  the Hurons, as they were permanently cultivating their lands.    Champlain observed, in 1615, that there were eighteen _bourgades_ or  villages, of which he mentions five, namely: Carhagouha, Toanche,  Carmeron, Tequenonquiaye and Cahiague. Cahiague was the most important,  and had two hundred huts; it was also the chief _bourgade_ of the tribe  called de la Roche.    Four tribes of a common origin and a common language were living on the  Huron peninsula. They were: (1.) The Attignaouantans, or Tribe de  l'Ours; (2.) The Attignenonghacs, or Tribe de la Corde; (3.) The  Arendarrhonons, or Tribe de la Roche; (4.) The Tohontahenrats. The  general name given to these four tribes by the French was Ouendats.    The most numerous and the most respected of the tribes were the tribes  de l'Ours and de la Corde, which had taken possession of the country;  the first about the year 1589, and the second twenty years after. The  oldest men of these tribes related to the missionaries, in 1638, that  their ancestors for the past two hundred years had been obliged to  change their residence every ten years. These two tribes were very  friendly, and in their councils treated each other like brothers. All  their business was conducted through the medium of a captain of war and  a captain of council.    These tribes became popular and increased their numbers by adopting  members of other nations, so that in later years the Huron family became  one of the most powerful and redoubtable in North America. The identity  of language was a great factor in the accomplishment of this marvellous  result. The Andastes, of Virginia, were therefore speaking the Huron  language. The Tionnontates became so identified with their neighbours  that they were named the Hurons of the Petun. The savages of the Neutral  Nation had also adopted the Huron idiom. This uniformity of language  formed a league between these nations which would have been broken with  the utmost difficulty.    Father de Brebeuf calculated that, in his time, there were scattered  over the whole continent of North America about three hundred thousand  Indians who understood the Huron dialect. This was exaggerated, for the  aborigines covering the territory known to the Hurons from whom the  father had collected this information did not number three hundred  thousand persons. How could he rely upon these people, to whom a  thousand men represented simply an amazing number? How could the Hurons  make a census of an unsedentary people, wandering here and there  according to circumstances of war or other reasons, and recruiting  themselves with prisoners or with the remnants of conquered nations?    To give only one example of these strange recruitings, let us examine  the composition of the great family of the Iroquois in Champlain's time.  It was a collection of disbanded tribes, who had belonged to the Hurons,  to the Tionnontates, to the Neutral, to the Eries and du Feu tribes. The  Iroquois had separated themselves from the Hurons to form a branch which  acquired with time more vivacity than the tree from which it had sprung.  The Hurons were called the good Iroquois in order to distinguish them  from the wicked Iroquois who were reputed to be barbarous. They fought  against all the nations living in Canada, and their name was a subject  of general apprehension.    Returning to the Hurons, we find that the Attignaouantans, or the tribe  de l'Ours, was the most populous, forming half of the whole Huron  family, namely about fifteen thousand souls. They were considered,  erroneously, as the most perfidious of all. Father de Brebeuf, who knew  them well, says that they were mild, charitable, polite and courteous.  Some years later, the tribe de l'Ours occupied fourteen villages, with  thirteen missions under the charge of the Jesuits. The whole mission,  called Immaculate Conception, had its principal seat at Ossossane, which  had replaced Carhagouha, mentioned by Champlain. The French called it La  Rochelle. Ossossane was the nearest village of the Iroquois territory.  Father du Creux' map places it on the western coast of the Huron  peninsula.    The Attignenonghacs, or tribe de la Corde, were the oldest and the most  numerous, after the Attignaouantans. They praised their antiquity and  their traditions which had existed for two hundred years, and which had  been collected by word of mouth by the chiefs or captains. This  evidence, more or less valuable, seems to indicate that they had  preserved a family spirit, which is very laudable. The Attignenonghacs,  however, had founded a nationality, and their language was so developed  that, in 1635, Father de Brebeuf could recall to memory twelve nations  who spoke it. This tribe had no special features except that they were  very devoted to the French. The Jesuits opened in their midst two  missions called St. Ignace and St. Joseph. Teanaustayae was one of the  most important villages of the Attignenonghacs. When the village of  Ihonatiria ceased to exist, the Jesuits called it St. Joseph. Here  perished, in 1648, Father Daniel, together with seven hundred Hurons.    Toanche was another village of the same tribe. It has often changed its  name, and we may consider it as one of these flying _bourgades_ so  commonly found among the Hurons. Champlain had known the village of  Toanche under the name of Otouacha. When Father de Brebeuf came here for  the second time, in 1634, he was unable to recognize the village that he  had visited for the first time in 1626. It had been transported about  two miles from its former place. It was then situated at the western  entrance of a bay now Penetanguishene, on a point in the northern part  of Lake Huron, four leagues from Ossossane and seven from Teanaustayae.    The Arendarrhonons, or tribe de la Roche, were settled on the eastern  part of the peninsula. They were at first discovered by the French, and  they had, according to the laws of the country, the privilege of fur  trading. They were especially attached to Champlain, and twenty-two  years after his death they had not forgotten his remarkable virtues and  courage. The _bourgade_ of Cahiague, comprising two hundred and sixty  huts and two thousand souls, was the chief place of the Arendarrhonons.  It was situated near the lake Ouentaron, now lake Simcoe, at the  northern extremity, near the small town of Orillia. The Jesuits  established a mission here, and their principal residence was on the  right shore of a small river called the Wye, near Penetanguishene. The  remains of a fort built there in 1639 could be seen a few years ago.    Cahiague was distant from Carhagouha fourteen leagues. It was situated  near the village of Scanonahenrat, where the Tohontahenrats, the fourth  Huron tribe, resided. They were less numerous than the others.  Scanonahenrat was situated at about two leagues from Ihonatiria of the  Attignenonghacs, and at three leagues from the Ataronchronons, another  Huron group of small importance, where finally the Jesuits took up their  residence. When these missions were flourishing, the Jesuits could  enumerate twenty-five different places where they could pursue their  calling with zeal. The Recollets had continued their course with  vigorous activity; they had sown the divine seed, but they were not  permitted to reap the reward of their labours, as the Jesuits did in the  future.    Although the Hurons appeared to be happy, their mode of living was  miserable. Their principal articles of food were Indian corn and common  beans, which they prepared in various ways. Their clothing was made of  the skins of wild animals. Deer skin was used for their trousers, which  were cut loose, and their stockings were made of another piece of the  same skin, while their boots were formed of the skin of bears, beavers  and deer. They also wore a cloak in the Egyptian style, with sleeves  which were attached by a string behind. Most of them painted their faces  black and red, and dyed their hair, which some wore long, others short,  and others again on one side only. The women and girls were dressed  like men, except that they had their robes, which extended to the knee,  girt about them. They all dressed their hair in one uniform style,  carefully combed, dyed and oiled. For ornaments they wore quantities of  porcelain, chains and necklaces, besides bracelets and ear-rings.    These people were of a happy temperament generally, though some had a  sad and gloomy countenance. Physically they were well proportioned. Some  of the men and women had fine figures, strong and robust, and many of  the women were powerful and of unusual height. The greater portion of  the work fell to the lot of the women, who looked after the housework,  tilled the land, laid up a store of wood for the winter, beat the hemp  and spun it, and made fishing nets from the thread. They also gathered  in the harvest and prepared it for food. The occupation of the men was  hunting for deer, fishing, and building"]]]
