Unless these are pure fabrications, they would seem to prove something  of constant intercourse between the mother and daughter colonies of  north-west Europe and north-east America, and something of a permanent  Christian settlement of Northmen in the New Continent is made probable  by assuming such intercourse. Between 981-1000, both Iceland and  Greenland had become \"Catholic in name and Christian in surname\"; in  1126 the line of Bishops of Gardar begins with Arnold, and the clergy  would hardly have ventured on the Vinland voyage to convert Skraelings in  an almost deserted country.    The later story of the Greenland colonies, interesting as it is, and  traceable to the year 1418, is not part of the expansion but of the  contraction of Europe and Christendom. And the voyages of the Zeni in  1380-95 to Greenland and the Western islands Estotiland and Drogeo,  belong to another part; they are the last achievements of mediaeval  discovery before Henry of Portugal begins his work, and form the natural  end of an introduction to that work.    But it is curious to notice that just as the ice and the Esquimaux  between them were bringing to an end the last traces of Norse settlement  in the Arctic Continent, and just as all intercourse between Vinland,  Greenland, Iceland, and Norway entirely ceases--at any rate to record  itself--the Portuguese sailors, taking up the work of Eric and Leif and  Thorfinn, on another side, were rounding Cape Verde and nearing the  southern point of Africa, and so providing for the mind of Columbus  suggestions which resulted in the lasting discovery of the world that  the Vikings had sighted and colonised, but were not able to hold.    The Venetian, Welsh, and Arabic claims to have followed the Norsemen in  visits to America earlier than the voyage of 1492, belong rather to the  minute history of geographical controversy. It is a fairly certain fact  that the north-west line of Scandinavian migration reached about A.D.  1000 to Cape Cod and the coasts of Labrador. It is equally certain that  on this side the Norsemen never made any further advance, lasting or  recorded. Against all other mediaeval discoveries of a Western Continent,  one only verdict can stand:--Not Proven.    The other lines of Northern advance, though marked by equal daring and  far greater military exploits, have less of original discovery. There  was fighting in plenty, the giving and taking of hard knocks with every  nation from Archangel to Cordova and from Limerick to Constantinople;  and the Vikings, as they reached fresh ground, re-named most of the  capes and coasts, the rivers and islands and countries of Europe, of  North Africa, of Western Asia. Iberia became \"Spanland\"; Gallicia,  \"Jacobsland\"[18]; Gallia, \"Frankland\"; Britannia, \"England,\" \"Scotland,\"  \"Bretland\"; Hibernia, \"Irland\"; Islam, outside \"Spanland,\" passed into  \"Serkland\" or Saracenland. Greece was \"Grikland\"; Russia, \"Gardariki\";  the Pillars of Hercules, the Straits of Gibraltar, were \"Norva's Sound,\"  which later days derived from the first Northman who passed through  them. The city of Constantine was the Great Town--\"Miklagard\"; Novgorod  was \"Holmgard,\" the town of all others that most touched and influenced  the earlier, the Viking age, of Northern expansion. For was it not their  own proudest and strongest city-state, and \"Who can stand before God, or  the Great Novgorod?\" except the men who had built it, and would rush to  sack it if it turned against them?    [Footnote 18: From St. James of Compostella.]    But all this was only the passing of a more active race over ground  which had once been well known to Rome and to Christendom, even if much  of this was now being forgotten. It was only in upland Russia and in the  farthest North that the Norsemen sensibly enlarged the Western world to  east or north-east, as they did through their Iceland settlements on the  north-west.    On the south and south-west no Vikings or Royalist followers of Vikings,  like Sigurd the Crusader, sailed the seas beyond Norva's Sound and  Serkland,[19] and as pilgrims, traders, travellers, and conquerors in  the Mediterranean, their work was of course not one of exploration. They  bore a foremost share in breaking down the Moslem incubus on southern  Europe; they visited the Holy sites        \"When sacred Hierosolyma they'd relieved      And fed their eyes on Jordan's holy flood      Which the dear body of Lord God had laved\";[20]    they fought as Varangian body-guards in the armies of the great  Byzantines, Nikephoros Phokas, John Tzimiskes, Basil II. or Maniakes;  but in all this they discovered for themselves rather than for Europe.    [Footnote 19: Unless White Man's Land and Great Ireland are the  Canaries. See above, p. 63.]    [Footnote 20: Camoens, _Lusiads_, (Barton's trans.).]    But Russia, that is, Old Russia round Novgorod and Kiev, the White Sea,  the North Cape and Finland coasts, as well as the more outlying parts of  Scotland and Ireland, were first clearly known to Europe through the  Northmen. The same race did much to open up the modern Lithuania and  Prussia, and the conversion of the whole of Scandinavia, mother country  and colonies alike, in the tenth and eleventh centuries added our  Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, with all the Viking settlements, to the  civilised world and church of Rome.    First, on the eastern side, it was in 862 that the Russians invited help  from their less dreaded neighbours around Upsala against their more  vexatious neighbours around Kiev, and in September of the same year  Ruric arrived at Novgorod and founded the Mediaeval Kingdom of Russia,  which in the tenth century under Oleg, Igor, and Vladimir was first the  plunderer, then the open enemy, and finally the ally in faith and in  arms of the Byzantine Empire.    All through this time and afterwards, till the time of the Tartar  deluge, the intercourse of Swedes, Danes, and Northmen with Gardariki  was constant and close, and not least in the time of the Vinland  voyages, when Vladimir and Jaroslav reigned at Novgorod, and the two  Olafs, the son of Trygve and the Saint, found refuge at their court  before and after their hard rule in Norway.    Olaf Trygveson's uncle had grown old in exile at Novgorod when young  Olaf and his mother fled from Norway to join him there and were captured  by Vikings in the Baltic and kept six years in the Gulf of Riga before  they got to Holmgard (972).    In 1019 Ingigerd of Sweden was married to Jaroslav; ten years later St.  Olaf was driven from Norway by revolt, and flying into Russia, was  offered a Kingdom called Volgaria--the modern Casan, whose old  metropolis of Vulghar was known to the Arab travellers of the ninth  century, and whose ruins can still be seen. Olaf hesitated between this  and a pilgrim's death in Jerusalem and at last preferred to fight his  way back to Norway.    The next King of the Norsemen, Magnus the Good, came from Novgorod by  Ladoga to Trondhjem, when Olaf's son Harold Hardrada fled back to his  father's refuge, to the court of Jaroslav; while Magnus had been in  exile, men had asked news of him from all the merchants that traded to  Novgorod.    Last of these earlier kings, Harold Hardrada, during all the time of his  wild romance in East and South, before he went to Miklagard, and after  his flight, and all the time of his service in the Varangian Guard of  the Empress Zoe, made Novgorod his home. His pilgrim relics from Holy  Land and his war spoils from Serkland--Africa and Sicily--were all sent  back to Jaroslav's care till their master could come and claim them, and  when he came at last, flying from Byzantine vengeance across the Black  Sea into the Sea of Azov and \"all round the Eastern Realm\" of Kiev, he  found his wealth untouched and Princess Elizabeth ready to be his wife  and to help him with Russian men and money to win back Norway and to die  at Stamford Bridge for the Crown of England (1066).    Harold is the type of all Vikings, of the Norse race in its greatest,  most restless energy. William the Conqueror, or Cnut the Great, or  Robert Guiscard, or Roger of Sicily, are all greater and stronger men,  but there is no \"ganger,\" no rover, like the man who in fifty years,  after fighting in well-nigh every land of Christians or of the  neighbours and enemies of Christendom, yet hoped for time to sail off to  the new-found countries and so fulfil his oath and promise to perfect a  life of unmatched adventure by unmatched discovery. He had fought with  wild beasts in the Arena of Constantinople; he had bathed in the Jordan  and cleared the Syrian roads of robbers; he had stormed eighty castles  in Africa; he had succoured the Icelanders in famine and lived as a  prince in Russia and Northumberland; by his own songs he boasts that he  had sailed all round Europe; but he fell, the prototype of sea-kings  like Drake or Magellan, without one discovery. Men of his own nation and  time had been before him everywhere, but he united in himself the work  and adventures, the conquests and discoveries of many. He was the  incarnation of Northern spirit, and it was through the lives and records  of such as he that Europe became filled with that new energy of thought  and action, that new life and knowledge, which was the ground and  impulse of the movement led by Henry the Navigator, by Columbus, and the  Cabots.    Harold's wars kept him from becoming a great explorer, but Norse  captains who took service under peaceful kings did something of what he  aimed at doing.    We must retrace our steps to the voyages of Ohthere and Wulfstan under  King Alfred about the year 890, about the time when a Norse King, Harold  Fair-hair,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18767"],[0,"Stories about Animals: with Pictures to Match (#14)"],[1,"ess, as she crouched down  like a cat, and seemed to eye them very steadfastly. The man being  afraid to ascend the tree, decided on cutting it down; and having his  axe with him, he set actively to work, when the lioness seemed most  attentive to what he was doing. When the tree fell, she pounced upon the  baboon, and, after tearing her in pieces, she turned round, and licked  the cubs for some time. She then returned to the sailor, and fawned  round him, rubbing her head against him in great fondness, and in token  of her gratitude for the service done her. After this, she carried the  cubs away one by one, and the sailor rejoined his companions, much  pleased with the adventure.    A French gentleman relates a remarkable anecdote about a combat which he  saw on the banks of the Niger, between a Moorish chief and a lion. The  prince took the Frenchman and his company to a place adjoining a  large wood which was much infested with wild beasts, and directed them  all to climb the trees. They did so. Then, getting upon his horse, and  taking three spears and a dagger, he entered the forest, where he soon  found a lion, which he wounded with one of the spears. The enraged  animal sprang with great fury at his assailant, who, by a feigned  flight, led him near the spot where the company were stationed. He then  turned his horse, and in a moment darted another spear at the lion,  which pierced his body. He alighted, and the lion, now grown furious,  advanced with open jaws; but the prince received him on the point of his  third spear, which he forced into his throat. Then, at one leap,  springing across his body, he cut open his throat with his dagger. In  this contest, the Moor's skill was such, that he received only a slight  scratch on the thigh.    [Illustration: THE CONVENTION OF ANIMALS.]    Allow me, in concluding these stories about lions, to recite one from  the French. It is fabulous, as you will perceive; but fables are not to  be despised. The design of the fable is to illustrate the truth that in  a community, every one may be more or less useful. \"War having been  declared between two nations of animals (for, notwithstanding their  instinct, they are as foolish as men), the lion issued a proclamation of  the fact to his subjects, and ordered them to appear in person at his  camp. Among the great number of animals that obeyed the orders of their  sovereign, were some asses and hares. Each animal offered his services  for the campaign. The elephant agreed to transport the baggage of the  army. The bear took it upon him to make the assaults. The fox proposed  to manage the ruses and the stratagems. The monkey promised to amuse the  enemy by his tricks. 'Sire,' said the horse, 'send back the asses; they  are too lazy--and the hares; they are too timid, and subject to too  frequent alarms.' 'By no means,' said the king of the animals; 'our army  would not be complete without these. The asses will serve for  trumpeters, and the hares will make excellent couriers.'\"          [Illustration: THE GALAGO.]    The Galago.      From a recent English periodical, I have obtained some interesting facts  in relation to an animal to which naturalists have given the name of the  Galago. In the picture on the opposite page you have a portrait of the  animal, drawn from life. He is a very singular looking fellow, as you  perceive. Not long ago he was brought to England from Zanguebar, in  Africa. The specimen, now being exhibited in London, is the first of  this race of quadrupeds which has ever been introduced from its native  country into any part of Europe, and it is exciting a great deal of  interest among naturalists. Very little is known of the genus to which  the animal belongs, all its species being found only in the barbarous  countries, very little known, on the eastern coast of Africa. They all  climb upon trees, like the squirrel. Their habits are strictly  nocturnal. They never venture from their retreats while the faintest  gleam of daylight is visible; but at the approach of night they become  exceedingly active, springing from tree to tree with all the dexterity  of the squirrel. In the day time, they remain, for the most part, in the  holes of decayed trees. Their food is gum and pulpy fruits. The country  where they live is one of the hottest regions on the globe. On this  account, the animal sent to England is very sensitive to the sudden  changes of that comparatively northern latitude, and it requires much  care to preserve him from the influence of the cold. One of the striking  peculiarities of the animal is the appearance of his feet. They resemble  the hands of a man, as will be seen by the engraving. This peculiarity  admirably fits the galago for the life it leads, as it spends a great  part of its time in leaping on the boughs of trees. The specimen in  England is remarkably tame and frolicksome, and does not seem altogether  happy except when he is fondled and petted, when he enjoys himself  immensely. During the night he delights in active motion, climbing and  playing like a kitten, often uttering a loud, clucking noise, which ends  with a sharp, shrill call, of astonishing volume. The animal is not so  large as a fox.          The Bear.      That distinguished author, Oliver Goldsmith, in his \"Animated Nature,\"  has given a most interesting account of the habits of the bear, which I  wish, for the benefit of my readers, might be embodied in this chapter,  though, on the whole, I think the entire account is too long, and I am  forced to omit it. Besides, I suppose it would hardly be just to accord  such a civility to the bear, while it is denied to the other animals.  According to the description of this eminent practical naturalist, the  bear is not by any means the unamiable monster he has been represented  to be; but has, on the contrary, a great many good traits of character.  He has been slandered, grossly slandered, if we may credit Mr.  Goldsmith; and for one, I do credit him. He is exceedingly reliable in  most of his statements. Now that I am speaking of Mr. Goldsmith, I can  scarce refrain from adding that I have been greatly assisted, in the  preparation of this volume, by the work of his above alluded to. It is,  and ever will be, a valuable book in the library of those who are  interested in becoming acquainted with nature, in her varied aspects.    There are three species of bears--the black, the white, and the brown or  Syrian bear. The latter, represented in the engraving on the opposite  page, is the one to which allusion is made in Scripture.    [Illustration: THE BROWN BEAR.]    The bear is capable of strong and generous attachment. Many years ago,  Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, in Europe, owned a bear which had become very  tame, and which was remarkable for the strength of his love for those  whom he happened to fancy. In the winter of 1709, a poor Savoyard boy  had been placed in a barn to stay over night. This boy, finding that he  was near the hut occupied by the duke's bear, took it into his head to  go and pay the bear a visit. It was a singular fancy, to be sure. But as  the old proverb says, \"There is no accounting for tastes.\" He had no  sooner formed the determination, than off he started to see Marco--for  that was the name of the bear. He was cold, I think; and not having  any other way of warming himself, he thought he would see if Marco could  not be prevailed upon to let him share in the benefit of his shaggy coat  for awhile. So in he went, and he and the bear were soon on the best of  terms. Marco took him between his paws, and warmed him, by pressing him  to his breast, until the next morning, when he allowed him to depart, to  ramble about the city. In the evening, the young Savoyard returned to  the bear's den, and was received with the same marks of kindness and  affection. For several days, the boy made this den his home. The bear  saved a part of his food for his companion, and they lived together on  the most intimate and friendly terms. A number of days passed in this  manner, without the servants knowing any thing about the circumstance,  the boy not being in the den when the bear's food was brought. At  length, one day, when some one came to bring the generous animal his  supper, rather later than usual, the boy was there. The servant then saw  the fondness of the bear for the young Savoyard. The boy was asleep. The  bear rolled his eyes around, in a furious manner, and seemed to intimate  that as little noise as possible must be made, for fear of awaking the  child, whom he clasped to his breast. The bear did not move when the  food was placed before him. This extraordinary circumstance was related  to Leopold, the owner of the bear, who, with a good many others, went to  the bear's hut, where they found, with surprise, that the animal never  stirred as long as his guest manifested a disposition to sleep. When the  little fellow awoke in the morning, he was very much ashamed and alarmed  to find that he was discovered, thinking that he should be punished; and  he begged the duke's pardon for the liberty he had taken with the bear.  The bear, however, caressed his new friend, and tried to prevail upon  him to eat a part of the supper which had been brought the previous  evening, and which seemed untouched.    Bruin is famous for hugging his enemies so desperately, that they are  glad to get clear of him. But in these hugging fights, he sometimes gets  the worst of it, as in the following instance. Some years since, when  the western part of the State of New York was but slightly settled, some  enterprising emigrant from New England had built a saw-mill on the banks  of the Genesee river. One day, as he was eating his luncheon, sitting on  the log which was going through the sawing operation at the time, a huge  black bear came from the woods, toward the mill. The man, leaving his  bread and cold bacon on the log, made a spring, and climbed up to "]]]
