Where shall I find the dog, and a  horse swift enough for such a journey?\" And he was in great distress.    The White Cat comforted him, however, saying that the wooden horse  would take him to his journey's end sufficiently quickly, and that she  would herself also provide the little dog; then she handed to him  a walnut, saying, \"Put your ear to this shell and you will hear him  barking.\"    So the Prince met his brothers, and they came into the King's  presence.    [Illustration]    The two elder sons had brought little dogs so delicate and small that  one hardly dared to touch them, and none could decide which should  have the kingdom. Then the youngest took from his pocket the nut the  Cat had given to him, and there was seen a little dog so tiny that  it could go through a ring without touching it; he was also able to  dance, and play the castanets, while his ears touched the ground.  The King was embarassed, for it was impossible to find a flaw in this  lovely little creature.    However as he did not desire to part with his crown, he declared that  they had succeeded so well in their first quest that now he should  like them to search, by land and sea, for a piece of linen so fine  that it would pass through the eye of a very small needle.    Then the three Princes set out once more, but the youngest mounted his  wooden horse and repaired at once to the White Cat, who was rejoiced  to see him, and the second year passed by as the first had done.    When the day came round appointed by the King for the return of his  sons, the two elder appeared before him, and, without awaiting the  arrival of their brother, displayed their pieces of linen, which were  of a fineness quite astonishing. But although they would pass through  the eye of a large needle, through the small needle the King had  selected they would not go.    There was much murmuring at this, and while the brothers were  disputing the King's decision, a charming sound was heard of trumpets  and other musical instruments.    It was the youngest Prince who arrived in a chariot with out-riders  and numerous attendants, all of which had been provided for him by the  White Cat.    After respectfully greeting his father and embracing his brothers, he  took out of a jewelled box a nut which he broke. On breaking the  nut he found a cherry stone, the stone was broken and there was the  kernel, in the kernel was a grain of corn, in the grain of corn a  millet seed, and within that a piece of linen so fine that it passed  six times through the smallest needle's eye, and moreover on it were  exquisite paintings of people and places without number.    The King heaved a deep sigh, and turning to his children said,    \"Nothing pleases me, in my old age, so much as your deference to my  desires, and I wish to prove you once more. Travel for a year, and he  who at the end of the year brings home the most beautiful girl shall  marry her, and be crowned king on his marriage. I promise you that I  will not defer this reward any longer.\"    Our Prince saw the injustice of all this; his little dog and piece  of linen were worth ten kingdoms, not only one; but he was too well  brought up to go against his father's wishes, and, mounting into his  chariot, with his retinue, he returned to the White Cat's Castle.    \"Well! King's son!\" said the White Cat, \"you have returned once more  without your crown?\"    \"Madam,\" answered the Prince, \"your gifts should have gained it for  me, but I am convinced that the King would have more pain in giving it  up than I should have pleasure in possessing it!\"    \"Never mind,\" she replied, \"you shall not neglect anything that may  deserve it; and if you must conduct a beautiful girl to your father's  court, I will look for one so that you may gain the prize. Meanwhile  let us be happy.\"    [Illustration]    If the Cat had not taken pains to remember the time when he must  return to the court, the Prince would surely have forgotten it. On the  evening before, she told him that she would bring him to one of the  most beautiful Princesses in the world, that at last the hour had  arrived to destroy the fatal work of an evil fairy, and to do this he  must make up his mind to cut off her head and tail, which he was at  once to throw into the fire.    \"I,\" cried the Prince, \"Blanchette that I love: do you think I should  be cruel enough to kill you? No doubt, you wish to prove my heart  which will certainly never forget what I owe to you for your  kindness.\"    \"No! King's son,\" she continued, \"I don't think you are ungrateful. Do  this that I beseech you, and then we shall begin to be happy with one  another, by the faith and honour of a cat, believe that I am truly  your friend.\"    Tears flowed from the Prince's eyes even at the thought, and he said  all that he could to avoid it, but she urged him so vehemently that  at last he took his sword and tremblingly cut off the head and tail of  his dear friend the Cat.    In the same moment took place the most marvellous change imaginable.    The body of the White Cat grew large, and was transformed into that  of a girl; how, one could not say; one only knew it was so. Her figure  was majestic, her manners charming, her whole appearance beautiful  beyond words.    Then there entered an immense number of lords and ladies, who carrying  their cats' skins, or with them thrown across their shoulders, came  and cast themselves at the feet of the Queen, expressing their joy at  seeing her again in her rightful form.    She received them all with a kindness which showed the goodness of her  heart, and then turning to the Prince she told the story of her life,  and how by a wicked enchantment she had been transformed into a White  Cat.    \"But it is you, my Prince, who have freed me,\" she concluded; \"as soon  as I saw you I knew my troubles were at an end.\"    They set out forthwith in a splendid carriage. As they drew near the  castle, at the place where the three brothers were to meet, the Queen  entered into a little crystal rock ornamented with precious stones,  and this was carried by richly dressed young men.    The Prince who had remained in the carriage, saw his brothers,  approaching with wondrously beautiful ladies.    On being questioned he told them that all he had brought was a little  White Cat.    [Illustration: \"THE BODY OF THE WHITE CAT GREW LARGE AND WAS  TRANSFORMED INTO THAT OF A GIRL.\"]    They began to laugh at him, and drove on followed by the young Prince,  while after him was brought the crystal rock.    Arrived at the Palace the two elder Princes dismounted with their  marvellous Princesses.    The King received them graciously, and did not know to which to award  the prize.    He looked at his youngest son and said, \"This time, then, you have  come alone.\" \"Your Majesty will see in this rock a little White  Cat who mews sweetly and has soft little velvet paws,\" answered the  Prince.    The King smiled, and himself went to open the rock. But, as he came  near, the Queen, with a touch, made it shatter to pieces, and from out  of it she appeared like the sun that has been hidden by clouds; her  fair hair was spread over her shoulders, and fell in waves to her  feet, and she was robed in a gown of white and rose-colour.    She made a deep curtsey to the King who, struck with admiration, could  not help exclaiming,    \"Here is one who is matchless, and she deserves my crown.\"    \"Sire,\" she answered, \"I have not come to take away the throne that  you fill with such dignity; I was born heir to six kingdoms, allow  me to offer you one, and one of them I give to each of your sons. In  return all I ask of you is this young Prince for my husband. We shall  still have three kingdoms.\"    The King and all the Court uttered loud cries of joy. The marriage was  at once celebrated, also that of the other two Princes; and in such a  manner that the Court spent several months in fetes of all sorts.    Then each one of them departed to govern his kingdom, the White Cat  making herself ever remembered as much by her kindness and generosity  as by her rare merit and beauty.    [Illustration]          BLUEBEARD      In the long ago times, in a splendid house, surrounded by fine  gardens and a park, there lived a man who had riches in abundance, and  everything to make him popular except one, and that was his beard, for  his beard was neither black as a raven's wing, golden as the sunlight,  nor just an ordinary every-day colour, but it was blue, bright blue.    Of course had blue beards come into fashion his would have been  considered beautiful beyond words, but, as far as we know, blue beards  have never as yet been fashionable, nor are they likely to be so.    However, in spite of his blue beard this man had married several  times, though what had become of his wives nobody could say.    Now, not far from Bluebeard's house there dwelt a widow with two very  lovely daughters, and one of these Bluebeard wished to marry, but  which he did not mind, they might settle that between themselves.    Neither of these girls had the least desire to have a husband with a  blue beard, and also, not knowing the fate of the other wives, they  did not like to risk disappearing from the world as those had done,  but being very polite young women they would not refuse Bluebeard's  proposals outright. The younger said, \"I would not for a moment take  away Sister Anne's chance of marrying such a wealthy man,\" while  Sister Anne declared that, although the elder, she would much prefer  to give way to her sister. And so it went on for some time.    Then Bluebeard invited the widow and her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15147"],[0,"Beeton's Book of Needlework (#14)"],[1,"a button-hole worked round in button-hole stitch,  87 an eyelet-hole worked in overcast.    [Illustration: 86.--Button and Eyelet Holes.]    [Illustration: 87.--Button and Eyelet Holes.]      [Illustration: 88.--Shaded Button-hole.]    [Illustration: 89.--Shaded Button-hole.]    ILLUSTRATIONS 88 & 89.--Shaded button-holes are worked like the others,  only they are prepared, as can be seen in illustration 89, so as to mark  the thickness. The stitches must gradually get narrower or wider, and be  worked very close to each other.      [Illustration: 90.--Leaf in Raised Satin Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATIONS 90 & 91 (_Two Leaves in Raised Satin Stitch_).--In a leaf  like the one seen in 90 work first the outline and veining in overcast  stitch; work one half of the leaf in satin stitch, and the other half  between the overcast outline and veining in back stitch. The stem of a  leaf is always worked last.    [Illustration: 91.--Leaf in Raised Satin Stitch.]      [Illustration: 92.--Raised Leaf.]    ILLUSTRATIONS 92 & 93 (_Two Leaves in Satin Stitch and Point de  Plume_).--For leaves like the one seen in 93 begin with the veinings,  then work the inner points, then the outer ones, and lastly the raised  spots in the centre. The leaf seen in 92 is worked, one half in _point  de plume_, the other half in back stitch or _point d'or_.    [Illustration: 93.--Raised Leaf.]      [Illustration: 94.--Leaf.]    ILLUSTRATION 94.--- The outline of this leaf is embroidered in overcast  stitch; the open-work veining consists of eyelets; one half of the leaf  is worked in back stitch, the other half in a kind of satin stitch  worked without chain stitches underneath; the stitches are worked  across the leaf, leaving between two stitches an interval as wide as the  stitch itself. The next row is then worked in these intervals, and each  stitch begins half-way up the one before and after it.      [Illustration: 95.--Leaf Raised.]    [Illustration: 96.--Leaf Raised.]    [Illustration: 97.--Raised Leaf.]    ILLUSTRATIONS 95 to 97 (_Leaf in Raised Embroidery).--This kind of  embroidery is particularly beautiful, as it is worked separately and  sewn on the material with an outline in very fine cotton, this produces  the shade seen in 95 (see also illustrations 98 to 113). For such leaves  work first one half in overcast and satin stitch (illustration 96); the  other half is worked on a separate piece of material (see illustration  97); cut away the material along the overcast outline, and fasten it on  the foundation material along the outline which forms the veining on  illustration 96.      [Illustration: 98.--Raised Embroidered Leaf.]    [Illustration: 99.--Half of Leaf (98).]    [Illustration: 100.--Centre of Leaf (98).]    ILLUSTRATIONS 98 TO 100 show a similar leaf; both halves are worked  separately (see 99); the centre is worked in open lace stitch. The  latter (see No. 100) is traced, then make ladder stitches across, work  the outlines in overcast stitch, and cut away the material underneath  the ladder stitch. The cross stitches are then worked in darning stitch  with very fine cotton wherever two threads meet.      [Illustration: 101.--Blossom in Satin Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATION 101 (_Blossom in Satin Stitch_).--The eyelet is worked in  overcast stitch, then work the upper part of the blossom all in one  piece as far as the beginning of the veining, thence the blossom is  worked in two halves.      [Illustration: 102.--Blossom in Satin Stitch.]    [Illustration: 103.--Bead partly covered.]    ILLUSTRATIONS 102 & 103 (_Blossom in Satin Stitch_).--The raised centre  of this flower is formed by a bead, over which the embroidery is worked.  When the leaves have been worked one after the other, place a bead in  the centre, left free in such a manner that one hole lies on the  material, and work over the bead by inserting the needle into its upper  hole, then underneath the material, drawing it out above the material  close to the bead, and so on (see 103).      [Illustration: 104.--Star in Satin Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATION 104 (_Star Pattern in Satin Stitch_).--The centre, which  forms a wheel, is worked first. Draw the threads across the circle  marked by an outline; in the centre they are wound round, always taking  one thread _on the needle_ and leaving the next thread _under the  needle_, as can be seen in 122 on the half-finished pattern. The  material underneath the wheel is only cut away when the rest of the  pattern has been embroidered.      [Illustration: 105.--Star in Point de Reprise.]    ILLUSTRATIONS 105 & 106 (_Patterns in Back, Satin, and Ladder  Stitches_).--The small star in the centre of No. 105 is worked in _point  de reprise_.    [Illustration: 106.--Star.]      [Illustration: 107.--Flower in Satin Stitch.]    ILLUSTRATION 107 (_Flower in Satin Stitch_).--The fine veinings are  worked with fine black silk in _point russe_, which renders the effect  of the flower very beautiful.      [Illustration: 108--Rose in Satin Stitch.]    [Illustration: 109.--Petal for Rose.]    ILLUSTRATIONS 108 & 109 (_Rose in Satin Stitch_).--No. 109 shows one  petal larger than full size. The outer circle only is prepared with  chain stitches underneath, so as to appear raised; the inner circles are  worked flat. The centre of the rose is embroidered in open work.      [Illustration: 110.--Heartsease.]    ILLUSTRATION 110 (_Embroidered Heartsease_).--For the knotted stitch see  No. 75. for the _point croise_ see 71 and 72.

[Illustration: 113.--Bluebell.]    [Illustration: 114.--Inner part of Bluebell.]    ILLUSTRATIONS 113, 114, & 116 (_Bluebell in Raised Satin Stitch_).--This  flower is worked partly in separate pieces, as has been described.  Illustration 116 shows the raised part stretched out flat. When it is  finished it is fastened down along the dotted line on No. 114, which  shows the inner part of the flower.      [Illustration: 115.--Flower.]    ILLUSTRATION 115 (_Flower in Point de Minute_).--This stitch is here  worked over a thick foundation of chain stitches. For raised patterns it  looks very well.    [Illustration: 115.--Outer part of Bluebell.]      [Illustration: 117.--Flower appliqued on Net.]    ILLUSTRATIONS 116 & 117 (_Flower worked in Applique_).--To work in  applique, two materials, either similar or different, are needed. You  can work either in applique of muslin on muslin, or of muslin on net, or  of net on net. Muslin on Brussels net is the prettiest way of working in  applique; we will therefore describe it: the other materials are worked  in the same manner. Trace the pattern on the muslin, fasten the latter  on the net, and trace the outlines of the pattern with very small  stitches work them in overcast stitch with very fine cotton, taking care  not to pucker the material. The veinings are worked in overcast. When  the pattern has been embroidered cut away the muslin round the outlines  with sharp scissors, so that the net forms the grounding (see No. 117).  The greatest care is required in cutting out the muslin to avoid  touching the threads of the net.      [Illustration: 118.--Border.]    ILLUSTRATIONS 118 & 119 (_Narrow Borders_).--It will be easy to work  these borders from the above instructions. Observe only that on border  118 the outer row of scallops is worked first, then the button-hole  stitch row, and the rest afterwards. The spots are edged all round in  knotted stitch. The wheels in the centre of the eyelets of No. 119 are  worked with very fine cotton in loose button-hole stitch; they are wound  round with the cotton in a second row.    [Illustration: 119.--Border.]      [Illustration: 120.--Insertion.]    ILLUSTRATIONS 120 TO 122.--Three strips of insertion, which are worked  nearly like the ladder stitch. For No. 120, in tracing the outlines,  make two small knots at short distances by winding the cotton four times  round the needle, as can be seen in illustration; the windings are held  down with the thumb of the left hand, draw the needle through, and a  knot is formed. The outlines are worked in button-hole stitch only when  all the knots have been made, and then the material is cut away  underneath.    Illustration 121 is a variety of the slanting ladder stitch.    Illustration 122.--The cross threads are worked in two rows in the  common herring-bone stitch, as can be seen by the black lines on the  illustration. The straight lines at the top and at the bottom are worked  in double overcast; lastly, the wheels are worked in a row as described  for the star pattern, No. 104.

O]    ILLUSTRATIONS 123 To 129 (_Embroidered Initials_).--To learn to work  initials the Roman characters are the easiest to begin with. They must  be traced and prepared like other embroidery in satin stitch, only the  chain stitches underneath must not be too thick: it would take away the  shape of the letters. All depends on the fineness and regularity of the  stitches; they must be worked in overcast stitch. Work from left to  right, and the letter when completed must look rather like raised  printing than like embroidery. Gothic letters are much more difficult to  work on account of the many flourishes; it requires great practice in  needlework to embroider them well. Illustration 123.--The small black  dots are worked in black silk on the thick parts of the letter: the fine  strokes are covered with cross threads of black silk. Illustration  124.--The outlines of the letter and the fine strokes are worked in  black silk. Illustration 125.--This letter is embroidered in raised  satin stitch and _point de plume_.
