At that moment, my father entered the room; and, with his  assistance and the footman's, Victorien Mergy flung the loathsome  creature out of doors. Six weeks later, I married Victorien.\"    \"And Daubrecq?\" asked Lupin, interrupting her. \"Did he not try...\"    \"No, but on our wedding-day, Louis Prasville, who acted as my husband's  best man in defiance of Danbrecq's opposition, went home to find the  girl he loved, the opera-singer, dead, strangled...\"    \"What!\" said Lupin, with a start. \"Had Daubrecq...\"    \"It was known that Daubrecq had been persecuting her with his attentions  for some days; but nothing more was known. It was impossible to discover  who had gone in or out during Prasville's absence. There was not a trace  found of any kind: nothing, absolutely nothing.\"    \"But Prasville...\"    \"There was no doubt of the truth in Prasville's mind or ours. Daubrecq  had tried to run away with the girl, perhaps tried to force her, to  hustle her and, in the course of the struggle, maddened, losing his  head, caught her by the throat and killed her, perhaps without knowing  what he was doing. But there was no evidence of all this; and Daubrecq  was not even molested.\"    \"And what became of him next?\"    \"For some years we heard nothing of him. We knew only that he had lost  all his money gambling and that he was travelling in America. And, in  spite of myself, I forgot his anger and his threats and was only too  ready to believe that he had ceased to love me and no longer harboured  his schemes of revenge. Besides, I was so happy that I did not care  to think of anything but my happiness, my love, my husband's political  career, the health of my son Antoine.\"    \"Antoine?\"    \"Yes, Antoine is Gilbert's real name. The unhappy boy has at least  succeeded in concealing his identity.\"    Lupin asked, with some hesitation:    \"At what period did... Gilbert... begin?\"    \"I cannot tell you exactly. Gilbert--I prefer to call him that and not  to pronounce his real name--Gilbert, as a child, was what he is to-day:  lovable, liked by everybody, charming, but lazy and unruly. When he was  fifteen, we put him to a boarding-school in one of the suburbs, with the  deliberate object of not having him too much at home. After two years'  time he was expelled from school and sent back to us.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because of his conduct. The masters had discovered that he used to slip  out at night and also that he would disappear for weeks at a time, while  pretending to be at home with us.\"    \"What used he to do?\"    \"Amuse himself backing horses, spending his time in cafes and public  dancing-rooms.\"    \"Then he had money?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Who gave it him?\"    \"His evil genius, the man who, secretly, unknown to his parents, enticed  him away from school, the man who led him astray, who corrupted him, who  took him from us, who taught him to lie, to waste his substance and to  steal.\"    \"Daubrecq?\"    \"Daubrecq.\"    Clarisse Mergy put her hands together to hide the blushes on her  forehead. She continued, in her tired voice:    \"Daubrecq had taken his revenge. On the day after my husband turned our  unhappy child out of the house, Daubrecq sent us a most cynical letter  in which he revealed the odious part which he had played and the  machinations by which he had succeeded in depraving our son. And he  went on to say, 'The reformatory, one of these days... Later on, the  assize-court ... And then, let us hope and trust, the scaffold!'\"    Lupin exclaimed:    \"What! Did Daubrecq plot the present business?\"    \"No, no, that is only an accident. The hateful prophecy was just a wish  which he expressed. But oh, how it terrified me! I was ailing at the  time; my other son, my little Jacques, had just been born. And every  day we heard of some fresh misdeed of Gilbert's--forgeries, swindles--so  much so that we spread the news, in our immediate surroundings, of his  departure for abroad, followed by his death. Life was a misery; and it  became still more so when the political storm burst in which my husband  was to meet his death.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"A word will be enough: my husband's name was on the list of the  Twenty-seven.\"    \"Ah!\"    The veil was suddenly lifted from Lupin's eyes and he saw, as in a  flash of lightning, a whole legion of things which, until then, had been  hidden in the darkness.    Clarisse Mergy continued, in a firmer voice:    \"Yes, his name was on it, but by mistake, by a piece of incredible  ill-luck of which he was the victim. It is true that Victorien Mergy  was a member of the committee appointed to consider the question of the  Two-Seas Canal. It is true that he voted with the members who were in  favour of the company's scheme. He was even paid--yes, I tell you so  plainly and I will mention the sum--he was paid fifteen thousand francs.  But he was paid on behalf of another, of one of his political friends,  a man in whom he had absolute confidence and of whom he was the blind,  unconscious tool. He thought he was showing his friend a kindness; and  it proved his own undoing. It was not until the day after the suicide of  the chairman of the company and the disappearance of the secretary, the  day on which the affair of the canal was published in the papers, with  its whole series of swindles and abominations, that my husband knew  that a number of his fellow-members had been bribed and learnt that the  mysterious list, of which people suddenly began to speak, mentioned  his name with theirs and with the names of other deputies, leaders of  parties and influential politicians. Oh, what awful days those were!  Would the list be published? Would his name come out? The torture of it!  You remember the mad excitement in the Chamber, the atmosphere of terror  and denunciation that prevailed. Who owned the list? Nobody could  say. It was known to be in existence and that was all. Two names were  sacrificed to public odium. Two men were swept away by the storm. And it  remained unknown where the denunciation came from and in whose hands the  incriminating documents were.\"    \"Daubrecq,\" suggested Lupin.    \"No, no!\" cried Madame Mergy. \"Daubrecq was nothing at that time: he had  not yet appeared upon the scene. No, don't you remember, the truth came  out suddenly through the very man who was keeping it back: Germineaux,  the ex-minister of justice, a cousin of the chairman of the Canal  Company. As he lay dying of consumption, he wrote from his sick-bed to  the prefect of police, bequeathing him that list of names, which, he  said, would be found, after his death, in an iron chest in the corner of  his room. The house was surrounded by police and the prefect took up  his quarters by the sick man's bedside. Germineaux died. The chest was  opened and found to be empty.\"    \"Daubrecq, this time,\" Lupin declared.    \"Yes, Daubrecq,\" said Madame Mergy, whose excitement was momentarily  increasing. \"Alexis Daubrecq, who, for six months, disguised beyond  recognition, had acted as Germineaux's secretary. It does not matter  how he discovered that Germineaux was the possessor of the paper in  question. The fact remains that he broke open the chest on the night  before the death. So much was proved at the inquiry; and Daubrecq's  identity was established.\"    \"But he was not arrested?\"    \"What would have been the use? They knew well enough that he must have  deposited the list in a place of safety. His arrest would have involved  a scandal, the reopening of the whole case...\"    \"So...\"    \"So they made terms.\"    Lupin laughed:    \"That's funny, making terms with Daubrecq!\"    \"Yes, very funny,\" said Madame Mergy, bitterly. \"During this time he  acted and without delay, shamelessly, making straight for the goal. A  week after the theft, he went to the Chamber of Deputies, asked for my  husband and bluntly demanded thirty thousand francs of him, to be paid  within twenty-four hours. If not, he threatened him with exposure and  disgrace. My husband knew the man he was dealing with, knew him to be  implacable and filled with relentless hatred. He lost his head and shot  himself.\"    \"How absurd!\" Lupin could not help saying. \"How absurd! Daubrecq  possesses a list of twenty-seven names. To give up any one of those  names he is obliged, if he would have his accusation believed, to  publish the list itself--that is to say, to part with the document, or  at least a photograph of it. Well, in so doing, he creates a scandal, it  is true, but he deprives himself, at the same time, of all further means  of levying blackmail.\"    \"Yes and no,\" she said.    \"How do you know?\"    \"Through Daubrecq himself. The villain came to see me and cynically  told me of his interview with my husband and the words that had passed  between them. Well, there is more than that list, more than that famous  bit of paper on which the secretary put down the names and the amounts  paid and to which, you will remember, the chairman of the company,  before dying, affixed his signature in letters of blood. There is more  than that. There are certain less positive proofs, which the people  interested do not know of: the correspondence between the chairman  and the secretary, between the chairman and his counsel, and so on. Of  course, the list scribbled on the bit of paper is the only evidence  that counts; it is the one incontestable proof which it would be no good  copying or even photographing, for its genuineness can be tested most  absolutely. But, all the same, the other proofs are dangerous. They  have already been enough to do away with two deputies. And Daubrecq  is marvelously clever at turning this fact to account. He selects  his victim, frightens him out of his senses, points out to him the  inevitable scandal; and the victim pays the required sum. Or else he  kills himself, as my husband did. Do you understand now?\"    \"Yes,\" said Lupin.

'Perhaps he would let me kill a slave for my reservoir?' returned  Sallust, eagerly.    'Not unlikely,' said Glaucus; 'for he who grants a favor to one Roman,  must always do it at the expense of another.  Be sure, that for every  smile Titus has caused, a hundred eyes have wept.'    'Long live Titus!' cried Pansa, overhearing the emperor's name, as he  swept patronizingly through the crowd; 'he has promised my brother a  quaestorship, because he had run through his fortune.'    'And wishes now to enrich himself among the people, my Pansa,' said  Glaucus.    'Exactly so,' said Pansa.    'That is putting the people to some use,' said Glaucus.    'To be sure, returned Pansa.  'Well, I must go and look after the  aerarium--it is a little out of repair'; and followed by a long train of  clients, distinguished from the rest of the throng by the togas they  wore (for togas, once the sign of freedom in a citizen, were now the  badge of servility to a patron), the aedile fidgeted fussily away.    'Poor Pansa!' said Lepidus: 'he never has time for pleasure.  Thank  Heaven I am not an aedile!'    'Ah, Glaucus! how are you? gay as ever?' said Clodius, joining the  group.    'Are you come to sacrifice to Fortune?' said Sallust.    'I sacrifice to her every night,' returned the gamester.    'I do not doubt it.  No man has made more victims!'    'By Hercules, a biting speech!' cried Glaucus, laughing.    'The dog's letter is never out of your mouth, Sallust,' said Clodius,  angrily: 'you are always snarling.'    'I may well have the dog's letter in my mouth, since, whenever I play  with you, I have the dog's throw in my hand,' returned Sallust.    'Hist!' said Glaucus, taking a rose from a flower-girl, who stood  beside.    'The rose is the token of silence,' replied Sallust, 'but I love only to  see it at the supper-table.'    'Talking of that, Diomed gives a grand feast next week,' said Sallust:  'are you invited, Glaucus?'    'Yes, I received an invitation this morning.'    'And I, too,' said Sallust, drawing a square piece of papyrus from his  girdle: 'I see that he asks us an hour earlier than usual: an earnest of  something sumptuous.'    'Oh! he is rich as Croesus,' said Clodius; 'and his bill of fare is as  long as an epic.'    'Well, let us to the baths,' said Glaucus: 'this is the time when all  the world is there; and Fulvius, whom you admire so much, is going to  read us his last ode.'    The young men assented readily to the proposal, and they strolled to the  baths.    Although the public thermae, or baths, were instituted rather for the  poorer citizens than the wealthy (for the last had baths in their own  houses), yet, to the crowds of all ranks who resorted to them, it was a  favorite place for conversation, and for that indolent lounging so dear  to a gay and thoughtless people.  The baths at Pompeii differed, of  course, in plan and construction from the vast and complicated thermae  of Rome; and, indeed, it seems that in each city of the empire there was  always some slight modification of arrangement in the general  architecture of the public baths. This mightily puzzles the learned--as  if architects and fashion were not capricious before the nineteenth  century!  Our party entered by the principal porch in the Street of  Fortune.  At the wing of the portico sat the keeper of the baths, with  his two boxes before him, one for the money he received, one for the  tickets he dispensed.  Round the walls of the portico were seats crowded  with persons of all ranks; while others, as the regimen of the  physicians prescribed, were walking briskly to and fro the portico,  stopping every now and then to gaze on the innumerable notices of shows,  games, sales, exhibitions, which were painted or inscribed upon the  walls. The general subject of conversation was, however, the spectacle  announced in the amphitheatre; and each new-comer was fastened upon by a  group eager to know if Pompeii had been so fortunate as to produce some  monstrous criminal, some happy case of sacrilege or of murder, which  would allow the aediles to provide a man for the jaws of the lion: all  other more common exhibitions seemed dull and tame, when compared with  the possibility of this fortunate occurrence.    'For my part,' said one jolly-looking man, who was a goldsmith, 'I think  the emperor, if he is as good as they say, might have sent us a Jew.'    'Why not take one of the new sect of Nazarenes?' said a philosopher.  'I  am not cruel: but an atheist, one who denies Jupiter himself, deserves  no mercy.'    'I care not how many gods a man likes to believe in,' said the  goldsmith; 'but to deny all gods is something monstrous.'    'Yet I fancy,' said Glaucus, 'that these people are not absolutely  atheists. I am told that they believe in a God--nay, in a future state.'    'Quite a mistake, my dear Glaucus,' said the philosopher.  'I have  conferred with them--they laughed in my face when I talked of Pluto and  Hades.'    'O ye gods!' exclaimed the goldsmith, in horror; 'are there any of these  wretches in Pompeii?'    'I know there are a few: but they meet so privately that it is  impossible to discover who they are.'    As Glaucus turned away, a sculptor, who was a great enthusiast in his  art, looked after him admiringly.    'Ah!' said he, 'if we could get him on the arena--there would be a model  for you! What limbs! what a head! he ought to have been a gladiator!  A  subject--a subject--worthy of our art!  Why don't they give him to the  lion?'    Meanwhile Fulvius, the Roman poet, whom his contemporaries declared  immortal, and who, but for this history, would never have been heard of  in our neglectful age, came eagerly up to Glaucus. 'Oh, my Athenian, my  Glaucus, you have come to hear my ode!  That is indeed an honour; you, a  Greek--to whom the very language of common life is poetry.  How I thank  you. It is but a trifle; but if I secure your approbation, perhaps I may  get an introduction to Titus.  Oh, Glaucus! a poet without a patron is  an amphora without a label; the wine may be good, but nobody will laud  it!  And what says Pythagoras?--\"Frankincense to the gods, but praise to  man.\" A patron, then, is the poet's priest: he procures him the incense,  and obtains him his believers.'    'But all Pompeii is your patron, and every portico an altar in your  praise.'    'Ah! the poor Pompeians are very civil--they love to honour merit. But  they are only the inhabitants of a petty town--spero meliora! Shall we  within?'    'Certainly; we lose time till we hear your poem.'    At this instant there was a rush of some twenty persons from the baths  into the portico; and a slave stationed at the door of a small corridor  now admitted the poet, Glaucus, Clodius, and a troop of the bard's other  friends, into the passage.    'A poor place this, compared with the Roman thermae!' said Lepidus,  disdainfully.    'Yet is there some taste in the ceiling,' said Glaucus, who was in a  mood to be pleased with everything; pointing to the stars which studded  the roof.    Lepidus shrugged his shoulders, but was too languid to reply.    They now entered a somewhat spacious chamber, which served for the  purposes of the apodyterium (that is, a place where the bathers prepared  themselves for their luxurious ablutions).  The vaulted ceiling was  raised from a cornice, glowingly colored with motley and grotesque  paintings; the ceiling itself was paneled in white compartments bordered  with rich crimson; the unsullied and shining floor was paved with white  mosaics, and along the walls were ranged benches for the accommodation  of the loiterers.  This chamber did not possess the numerous and  spacious windows which Vitruvius attributes to his more magnificent  frigidarium.  The Pompeians, as all the southern Italians, were fond of  banishing the light of their sultry skies, and combined in their  voluptuous associations the idea of luxury with darkness.  Two windows  of glass alone admitted the soft and shaded ray; and the compartment in  which one of these casements was placed was adorned with a large relief  of the destruction of the Titans.    In this apartment Fulvius seated himself with a magisterial air, and his  audience gathering round him, encouraged him to commence his recital.    The poet did not require much pressing.  He drew forth from his vest a  roll of papyrus, and after hemming three times, as much to command  silence as to clear his voice, he began that wonderful ode, of which, to  the great mortification of the author of this history, no single verse  can be discovered.    By the plaudits he received, it was doubtless worthy of his fame; and  Glaucus was the only listener who did not find it excel the best odes of  Horace.    The poem concluded, those who took only the cold bath began to undress;  they suspended their garments on hooks fastened in the wall, and  receiving, according to their condition, either from their own slaves or  those of the thermae, loose robes in exchange, withdrew into that  graceful circular building which yet exists, to shame the unlaving  posterity of the south.    The more luxurious departed by another door to the tepidarium, a place  which was heated to a voluptuous warmth, partly by a movable fireplace,  principally by a suspended pavement, beneath which was conducted the  caloric of the laconicum.    Here this portion of the intended bathers, after unrobing themselves,  remained for some time enjoying the artificial warmth of the luxurious  air. And this room, as befitted its important rank in the long process  of ablution, was more richly and elaborately decorated than the rest;  the arched roof was beautifully carved and painted; the windows above,  of ground glass, admitted but wandering and uncertain rays; below the  massive cornices were rows of figures in massive and bold relief; the  walls glowed with crimson, the pavement was skillfully tessellated in  white mosaics."]]]
