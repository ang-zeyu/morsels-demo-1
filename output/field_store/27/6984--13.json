This piece of timber was  crooked and its bend determined the wall line, which is bowed outward,  as shown on the ground plan. This feature will be discussed later.    There were two circular kivas in the village, one of which was unusually  small, being only about 10 feet in diameter north and south; the  east-and-west diameter is a trifle smaller. There was apparently no  bench in the interior, but on the western or northwestern side there  is a bench-like recess of about a foot which occupies 7 feet of the  circumference. The whole interior was covered with a number of washes  of clay, applied one over another, forming a coating now nearly  three-quarters of an inch thick. This is cracked and peeled off  in places, and in the section eighteen coats, generally about one  thirty-second of an inch thick, may be counted. Each coat or plastering  is defined by a film of smoke-blackened surface.      [Illustration: Fig. 24--Ground plan of ruin No. 10.]    On a level about 2 feet above the bench and about 5 feet above the  present ground surface, there seems to have been some kind of roof. The  stones here project into the interior slightly beyond the wall surface,  and the plaster seems to curve inward. This point or level is from 6 to  18 inches below the top of the wall, and here there are remains of  occasional small sticks, about an inch in diameter, which projected into  the kiva. They are irregularly disposed and probably had no connection  with the roof, but there are no traces of heavier timbers above them. In  the interior a white band with points completely encircled the kiva. The  top of this band is about a foot above the present ground surface and  about 18 inches below the bench on the western side. It is illustrated  in figure 72.    The exterior wall of the kiva was very roughly laid up, and some of the  lower stones were set on edge, which is rather an anomalous feature.  There is no evidence that the structure was ever inclosed in rectangular  walls, as was the usual custom; in fact, the occurrence of other walls  near it would apparently preclude such an arrangement. The wall which  runs north or northwest from the kiva, joining it to the cliff wall  behind, is pierced by a doorway some feet above the ground, and in front  of or below this doorway there is a buttress or step of solid masonry,  shown on the plan. There was apparently an open space between this  doorway and the next wall to the north. The room entered through the  doorway was very small, and its roof, formed by the overhanging cliff,  is much blackened by smoke.    The main or north kiva was 15 feet in diameter on the floor, with a  bench a foot wide extending around it. The external diameter is over 20  feet. The interior was decorated by bands and dots in white, which are  described at length in another place (page 178). The roof was 51/2 feet  above the bench, and there is a suggestion that it rested on a series of  beams extending north and south, but this is not certain.    On the southeastern side, at the point where the kiva comes nearest the  edge of the cliff, there was a narrow opening or doorway not more than  15 inches wide. This was the only entrance to the interior, except  through the roof, and it opens directly on the edge of the cliff, so  that it is very difficult, although not impossible, to pass it. In front  of the opening a little platform was built on the sloping edge of the  cliff, as though entrance was had from the lower bench by artificial  means, but it is more probable that this feature is all that remains of  a chimney-like structure.    Above this kiva there was apparently a living room, the walls of which,  where they still remain on the north and west sides, were approximately  straight, but the corners were rounded. The roof was formed by the  overhanging cliff and the interior walls were whitewashed. The kiva  walls were about 18 inches thick, but on the west side, in the small  room between the kiva and the cliff, the masonry is much heavier, the  lower part extending into the room a foot farther than the upper. This  is caused by the wall of the second-story room above setting in toward  the east or center of the kiva. This upper wall was supported by a beam,  part of which is still in place. The small room behind is much blackened  by smoke.    The exterior wall of the main kiva on the northwest side is very rough.  On the northeast and southeast, however, it is covered by straight walls  which are well finished. The western end of the north wall is joined to  the exterior circular wall of the kiva, at the point shown on the plan,  by a short flying wall whose purpose is not clear. It extends to what  may have been the roof of the kiva, but underneath it is open. The  triangular cavity formed by it is too small to permit the passage of a  person, and was available only from the second story.    The site of these ruins commands an extensive prospect, including  several small areas of good bottom land, one of which lies directly in  front of it; but the number of other ruins in the cove suggests that  there was once a much larger area of bottom land here, and this  suggestion is supported by the presence of several large cottonwood  trees, now standing out in the midst of the sand, in the bed of the  stream, where these trees never grow. Some of these trees are not yet  entirely dead, indicating that the change in the bed of the stream was a  recent one. Against the foot of the talus, just above the ruin, there is  a narrow strip of bottom land, about 3 feet above the stream bed, and on  it a single tree, still alive, but inclined at an angle. In the stream  bed, above and below the ruin, there are large trees, of which only  one or a few branches are still alive. The position of the cove with  reference to the stream bed made the bottom lands here especially  subject to erosion when the stream assumed its present channel and they  were gradually worn away.    The western end of the ledge was occupied by a structure whose use at  first sight is not apparent. The wall, as shown on the plan, is curved,  very thick and heavy, and built partly over the sloping rock forming the  back of the cave. The front wall is 3 feet thick, and its top, now  level, is about 5 feet above a narrow bench in front of it. There is no  doorway or other opening into it, and access into its interior was had  over the steep sloping rock to the north by means of hand-holes in the  rock. These are shown in plate L. The interior appears to have been  plastered.    This structure measures 15 by 5 feet inside, there being no wall on the  north, as the east wall merges into the sloping rock. The foot-holes in  the rock, before referred to, are at this end, nearest the village, and  appear to be in several series. The structure is so situated that the  sun shines on it only a few hours each day, and it seems more than  probable that it was a reservoir. The bed of the stream, the channel  followed in low water, sweeps against the base of the cliff below this  point, and by carrying water 20 feet it would be directly beneath and  about 50 feet below it. Finally, the cliff wall above this point is  decorated with pictographs of tadpoles and other water symbols in common  use among the pueblos, and these do not occur elsewhere on this site. In  the southwestern corner of the structure, near the bottom, there was an  opening about 18 inches high, which was carefully filled up from the  inside and plastered. This may have been an outlet by which the water  was discharged when the reservoir was cleaned out. The wall has caved in  slightly above it. The mud mortar used in building this structure and  the other walls was necessarily brought from below.      [Illustration: Plate L    Reservoir in Ruin No. 10 ]    About 25 feet east of the reservoir there are remains of a small single  room, rectangular, with a circular addition, shown on the ground plan.  The walls are well chinked and well constructed, the mud mortar being  used when about the consistency of modeling clay. In front of this room,  about 5 feet distant and on the edge of the sloping rock, a hole has  been pecked into the solid rock of the ledge. This hole is 12 inches  wide on top, slightly tapering, 10 inches deep on the upper side, and  4 inches on the lower. Twelve feet to the northeast there is a similar  hole, and below it, distant 10 inches, another, and beyond this others,  distributed generally along the foot of the sloping rock forming the  back of the ledge, but sometimes farther out on the flat floor. Probably  these holes mark the sites of upright posts supporting a drying scaffold  or frame, the horizontal poles of which extended backward to the wall of  the cliff.      [Illustration: Fig. 25--Oven-like structure in ruin No. 10.]    Near the center of the ledge, at the point shown on the plan, there are  some remains which strongly suggest the Mexican oven. The bed rock,  which is here nearly flat, was removed to a depth of about 4 inches over  a rectangular area measuring 4 feet north, and south by 31/2 feet. There  were natural fissures in the rock on the north and west sides which left  clean edges. The southern edge appears to have been smashed off with a  rock. The eastern side required no dressing, as it was at a slightly  lower level, and it was to reach this level that the rock was removed.  In the rectangular space described there was a circular, dome-shape  structure, about 3 feet in diameter, composed of mud and sticks, with a  scant admixture of small stones. This is shown in figure 25, and in plan  in figure 26. The walls were about 3 inches thick, and from their slope  the structure could not have been over 3 feet high. The mud which  composed the walls was held together by thin sticks or branches,  incorporated in it and curved with the wall--apparently some kind of  a vine"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19726"],[0,"The Door Through Space (#14)"],[1,"to speak, and Kyral insisted, \"Will you bargain? End  this damned woman's farce which makes a mock of _shegri_?\"    The slant of sun told me there was light left. I found a shred of voice,  not knowing what I was going to say until I had said it, irrevocably.  \"This is between Dallisa and me.\"    Kyral glared at me in mounting rage. With four strides he was out of the  room, flinging back a harsh, furious \"I hope you kill each other!\" and  the door slammed.    Dallisa's face swam red, and again as before, I knew the battle which  was joined between us would be fought to a dreadful end. She touched my  chest lightly, but the touch jolted excruciating pain through my  shoulders.    \"Did you kill Cuinn?\"    I wondered, wearily, what this presaged.    \"Did you?\" In a passion, she cried, \"Answer! Did you kill him?\" She  struck me hard, and where the touch had been pain, the blow was a blaze  of white agony. I fainted.    \"Answer!\" She struck me again and the white blaze jolted me back to  consciousness. \"Answer me! Answer!\" Each cry bought a blow until I  gasped finally, \"He signaled ... set catmen on us....\"    \"No!\" She stood staring at me and her white face was a death mask in  which the eyes lived. She screamed wildly and the huge _chak_ came  running.    \"Cut him down! Cut him down! Cut him down!\"    A knife slashed the rope and I slumped, falling in a bone-breaking  huddle to the floor. My arms were still twisted over my head. The _chak_  cut the ropes apart, pulled my arms roughly back into place, and I  gagged with the pain as the blood began flowing painfully through the  chafed and swollen hands.    And then I lost consciousness. More or less permanently, this time.          CHAPTER NINE      When I came to again I was lying with my head in Dallisa's lap, and the  reddish color of sunset was in the room. Her thighs were soft under my  head, and for an instant I wondered if, in delirium, I had conceded to  her. I muttered, \"Sun ... not down....\"    She bent her face to mine, whispering, \"Hush. Hush.\"    It was heaven, and I drifted off again. After a moment I felt a cup  against my lips.    \"Can you swallow this?\"    I could and did. I couldn't taste it yet, but it was cold and wet and  felt heavenly trickling down my throat. She bent and looked into my  eyes, and I felt as if I were falling into those reddish and stormy  depths. She touched my scarred mouth with a light finger. Suddenly my  head cleared and I sat upright.    \"Is this a trick to force me into calling my bet?\"    She recoiled as if I had struck her, then the trace of a smile flitted  around her red mouth. Yes, between us it was battle. \"You are right to  be suspicious, I suppose. But if I tell you what I know of Rakhal, will  you trust me then?\"    I looked straight at her and said, \"No.\"    Surprisingly, she threw back her head and laughed. I flexed my freed  wrists cautiously. The skin was torn away and chafed, and my arms ached  to the bone. When I moved harsh lances of pain drove through my chest.    \"Well, until sunset I have no right to ask you to trust me,\" said  Dallisa when she had done laughing. \"And since you are bound by my  command until the last ray has fallen, I command that you lay your head  upon my knees.\"    I blazed, \"You are making a game of me!\"    \"Is that my privilege? Do you refuse?\"    \"Refuse?\" It was not yet sunset. This might be a torture more complex  than any which had yet greeted me. From the scarlet glint in her eyes I  felt she was playing with me, as the cat-things of the forest play with  their helpless victims. My mouth twitched in a grimace of humiliation as  I lowered myself obediently until my head rested on her fur-clad knees.    She murmured, smiling, \"Is this so unbearable, then?\"    I said nothing. Never, never for an instant could I forget that--all  human, all woman as she seemed--Dallisa's race was worn and old when the  Terran Empire had not left their home star. The mind of Wolf, which has  mingled with the nonhuman since before the beginnings of recorded time,  is unfathomable to an outsider. I was better equipped than most Earthmen  to keep pace with its surface acts, but I could never pretend to  understand its deeper motivations.    It works on complex and irrational logic. Mischief is an integral part  of it. Even the deadly blood-feud with Rakhal had begun with an  overelaborate practical joke--which had lost the Service, incidentally,  several thousand credits worth of spaceship.    And so I could not trust Dallisa for an instant. Yet it was wonderful to  lie here with my head resting against the perfumed softness of her body.    Then suddenly her arms were gripping me, frantic and hungry; the subdued  thing in her voice, her eyes, flamed out hot and wild. She was pressing  the whole length of her body to mine, breasts and thighs and long legs,  and her voice was hoarse.    \"Is this torture too?\"    Beneath the fur robe she was soft and white, and the subtle scent of her  hair seemed a deeper entrapment than any. Frail as she seemed, her arms  had the strength of steel, and pain blazed down my wrenched shoulders,  seared through the twisted wrists. Then I forgot the pain.    Over her shoulder the last dropping redness of the sun vanished and  plunged the room into orchid twilight.    I caught her wrists in my hands, prizing them backward, twisting them  upward over her head. I said thickly, \"The sun's down.\" And then I  stopped her wild mouth with mine.    And I knew that the battle between us had reached climax and victory  simultaneously, and any question about who had won it was purely  academic.           *       *       *       *       *    During the night sometime, while her dark head lay motionless on my  shoulder, I found myself staring into the darkness, wakeful. The  throbbing of my bruises had little to do with my sleeplessness; I was  remembering other chained girls from the old days in the Dry-towns, and  the honey and poison of them distilled into Dallisa's kisses. Her head  was very light on my shoulders, and she felt curiously insubstantial,  like a woman of feathers.    One of the tiny moons was visible through the slitted windows. I thought  of my rooms in the Terran Trade City, clean and bright and warm, and all  the nights when I had paced the floor, hating, filled to the teeth with  bitterness, longing for the windswept stars of the Dry-towns, the salt  smell of the winds and the musical clashing of the walk of the chained  women.    With a sting of guilt, I realized that I had half forgotten Juli and my  pledge to her and her misfortune which had freed me again, for this.    Yet I had won, and what they knew had narrowed my planet-wide search to  a pinpoint. Rakhal was in Charin.    I wasn't altogether surprised. Charin is the only city on Wolf, except  the Kharsa, where the Terran Empire has put down deep roots into the  planet, built a Trade City, a smaller spaceport. Like the Kharsa, it  lies within the circle of Terran law--and a million miles outside it.    A nonhuman town, inhabited largely by _chaks_, it is the core and center  of the resistance movement, a noisy town in a perpetual ferment. It was  the logical place for a renegade. I settled myself so that the ache in  my racked shoulders was less violent, and muttered, \"Why Charin?\"    Slight as the movement was, it roused Dallisa. She rolled over and  propped herself on her elbows, quoting drowsily, \"The prey walks safest  at the hunter's door.\"    I stared at the square of violet moonlight, trying to fit together all  the pieces of the puzzle, and asked half aloud, \"What prey and what  hunters?\"    Dallisa didn't answer. I hadn't expected her to answer. I asked the real  question in my mind: \"Why does Kyral hate Rakhal Sensar, when he doesn't  even know him by sight?\"    \"There are reasons,\" she said somberly. \"One of them is Miellyn, my twin  sister. Kyral climbed the steps of the Great House by claiming us both  as his consorts. He is our father's son by another wife.\"    That explained much. Brother-and-sister marriages, not uncommon in the  Dry-towns, are based on expediency and suspicion, and are frequently,  though not always loveless. It explained Dallisa's taunts, and it partly  explained, only partly, why I found her in my arms. It did not explain  Rakhal's part in this mysterious intrigue, nor why Kyral had taken me  for Rakhal, (but only after he remembered seeing me in Terran clothing).    I wondered why it had never occurred to me before that I might be  mistaken for Rakhal. There was no close resemblance between us, but a  casual description would apply equally well to me or to Rakhal. My  height is unusual for a Terran--within an inch of Rakhal's own--and we  had roughly the same build, the same coloring. I had copied his walk,  imitated his mannerisms, since we were boys together.    And, blurring minor facial characteristics, there were the scars of the  _kifirgh_ on my mouth, cheeks, and shoulders. Anyone who did not know us  by sight, anyone who had known us by reputation from the days when we  had worked together in the Dry-towns, might easily take one of us for  the other. Even Juli had blurted, \"You're so much like--\" before  thinking better of it.    Other odd bits of the puzzle floated in my mind, stubbornly refusing to  take on recognizable patterns, the disappearance of a toy-seller; Juli's  hysterical babbling; the way the girl--Miellyn?--had vanished into a  shrine of Nebran; and the taunts of Dallisa and the old man about a  mysterious \"Toymaker.\" And something, some random joggling of a memory,  in that eerie trading in the city of the Silent Ones. I knew all these  things fitted together somehow, but I had no real hope that Dallisa  could complete their pattern for me.    She said, with a vehemence that startled me, \"Miellyn is only the  excuse! Kyral hates Rakhal because Rakhal will compromise and because  he'll fight!\"    She rolled over and pressed herself"]]]
