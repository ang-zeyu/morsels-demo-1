I reminded him that a quick run in a clipper schooner could  carry directions to half these skippers of his, to whom, with an  infatuation which I could not and cannot conceive, he had left no  discretion, and who indeed were to be pardoned if they could use none,  seeing the tumult as they did with only half an eye. I talked to him for  half an hour, and went into details to show that my plans were not  impracticable. The old gentleman grew brighter and brighter, and Julia,  as I saw, whenever I stole a glance across the room, felt happier and  happier. The poor girl had had a hard time since he had first heard this  news whispered the evening before.    His difficulties were not over, however; for when I talked to him of the  necessity of sending out one or two skilful agents immediately to take  the personal superintendence of his complicated affairs, the old man  sighed, and said he had no skilful agents to send.    With his customary suspicion, he had no partners, and had never  intrusted his clerks with any general insight into his business.  Besides, he considered them all, like his captains, blunder-headed to  the last degree. I believe it was an idea of Julia's, communicated to me  in an eager, entreating glance, which induced me to propose myself as  one of these confidential agents, and to be responsible for the other.  I thought, as I spoke, of Singleton, to whom I knew I could explain my  plans in full, and whose mercantile experience would make him a valuable  coadjutor. The old gentleman accepted my offer eagerly. I told him that  twenty-four hours were all I wanted to prepare myself. He immediately  took measures for the charter of two little clipper schooners which lay  in port then; and before two days were past, Singleton and I were on our  voyage to South America. Imagine, if you can, how these two days were  spent. Then, as now, I could prepare for any journey in twenty minutes,  and of course I had no little time at my disposal for last words with  Mr. and--Miss Wentworth. How I won on the old gentleman's heart in those  two days! How he praised me to Julia, and then, in as natural affection,  how he praised her to me! And how Julia and I smiled through our tears,  when, in the last good-bys, he said he was too old to write or read any  but business letters, and charged me and her to keep up a close  correspondence, which on one side should tell all that I saw and did,  and on the other hand remind me of all at home.           *       *       *       *       *    I have neither time nor room to give the details of that South American  expedition. I have no right to. There were revolutions accomplished in  those days without any object in the world's eyes; and, even in mine,  only serving to sell certain cargoes of long cloths and flour. The  details of those outbreaks now told would make some patriotic presidents  tremble in their seats; and I have no right to betray confidence at  whatever rate I purchased it. Usually, indeed, my feats and Singleton's  were only obtaining the best information and communicating the most  speedy instructions to Mr. Wentworth's vessels, which were made to move  from port to port with a rapidity and intricacy of movement which none  besides us two understood in the least. It was in that expedition that I  travelled almost alone across the continent. I was, I think, the first  white man who ever passed through the mountain path of Xamaulipas, now  so famous in all the Chilian picturesque annuals. I was carrying  directions for some vessels which had gone round the Cape; and what a  time Burrows and Wheatland and I had a week after, when we rode into the  public square of Valparaiso shouting, \"Muera la Constitucion,--Viva  Libertad!\" by our own unassisted lungs actually raising a rebellion,  and, which was of more importance, a prohibition on foreign flour, while  Bahamarra and his army were within a hundred miles of us. How those  vessels came up the harbor, and how we unloaded them, knowing that at  best our revolution could only last five days! But as I said, I must be  careful, or I shall be telling other people's secrets.    The result of that expedition was that those thirteen vessels all made  good outward voyages, and all but one or two eventually made profitable  home voyages. When I returned home, the old gentleman received me with  open arms. I had rescued, as he said, a large share of that fortune  which he valued so highly. To say the truth, I felt and feel that he had  planned his voyages so blindly, that, without some wiser head than his,  they would never have resulted in anything. They were his last, as they  were almost his first, South American ventures. He returned to his old  course of more methodical trading for the few remaining years of his  life. They were, thank Heaven, the only taste of mercantile business  which I ever had. Living as I did, in the very sunshine of Mr. Went  worth's favor, I went through the amusing farce of paying my addresses  to Julia in approved form, and in due time received the old gentleman's  cordial assent to our union, and his blessing upon it. In six months  after my return, we were married; the old man as happy as a king. He  would have preferred a little that the ceremony should have been  performed by Mr. B----, his friend and pastor, but readily assented to  my wishes to call upon a dear and early friend of my own.    Harry Barry came from Topsham and performed the ceremony, \"assisted by  Rev. Mr. B.\"    G.H.    ARGUS COTTAGE, April 1, 1842.          THE OLD AND THE NEW, FACE TO FACE.    A THUMB-NAIL SKETCH.      [This essay was published in Sartain's Magazine, in 1852, as \"A  Thumb-nail Sketch,\" having received one of ten premiums which Mr.  Sartain offered to encourage young writers. It had been written a few  years earlier, some time before the studies of St. Paul's life by  Conybeare and Howson, now so well known, were made public. The  chronology of my essay does not precisely agree with that of these  distinguished scholars. But I make no attempt now either to recast the  essay or to discuss the delicate and complicated questions which belong  to the chronology of Paul's life or to that of Nero; for there is no  question with regard to the leading facts. At the end of twenty years I  may again express the wish that some master competent to the greatest  themes might take the trial of Paul as the subject of a picture.]           *       *       *       *       *    In a Roman audience-chamber, the old civilization and the new  civilization brought out, at the very birth of the new, their chosen  champions.    In that little scene, as in one of Rembrandt's thumb-nail studies for a  great picture, the lights and shades are as distinct as they will ever  be in the largest scene of history. The champions were perfect  representatives of the parties. And any man, with the soul of a man,  looking on, could have prophesied the issue of the great battle from the  issue of that contest.    The old civilization of the Roman Empire, just at that time, had reached  a point which, in all those outward forms which strike the eye, would  regard our times as mean indeed. It had palaces of marble, where even  modern kings would build of brick with a marble front to catch the eye;  it counted its armies by thousands, where we count ours by hundreds; it  surmounted long colonnades with its exquisite statues, for which modern  labor digs deep in ruined cities, because it cannot equal them from its  own genius; it had roads, which are almost eternal, and which, for their  purposes, show a luxury of wealth and labor that our boasted locomotion  cannot rival. These are its works of a larger scale. And if you enter  the palaces, you find pictures of matchless worth, rich dresses which  modern looms cannot rival, and sumptuous furniture at which modern times  can only wonder. The outside of the ancient civilization is unequalled  by the outside of ours, and for centuries will be unequalled by it. We  have not surpassed it there. And we see how it attained this  distinction, such as it was. It came by the constant concentration of  power. Power in few hands is the secret of its display and glory. And  thus that form of civilization attained its very climax in the moment of  the greatest unity of the Roman Empire. When the Empire nestled into  rest, after the convulsions in which it was born; when a generation had  passed away of those who had been Roman citizens; when a generation  arose, which, excepting one man, the emperor, was a nation of Roman  subjects,--then the Empire was at its height of power, its  centralization was complete, the system of its civilization was at the  zenith of its success.    At that moment it was that there dawned at Rome the first gray  morning-light of the new civilization.    At that moment it was that that short scene, in that one chamber,  contrasted the two as clearly as they can be contrasted even in long  centuries.    There is one man, the emperor, who is a precise type, an exact  representative, of the old. That man is brought face to face with  another who is a precise type, an exact representative, of the new.    Only look at them as they stand there! The man who best illustrates the  old civilization owes to it the most careful nurture. From his childhood  he has been its petted darling. Its principal is concentration under one  head. He is that head.

At this time the tide was  up within two or three feet of the spring, so that we judged, it might, in  some degree, be cooled by it. We were mistaken however, for on repeating  the experiment next morning, when the tide was out, the mercury rose no  higher than 187 deg.; but, at another spring, where the water bubbled out of  the sand from under the rock at the S.W. corner of the harbour, the mercury  in the same thermometer rose to 202 deg.-1/2, which is but little colder than  boiling water. The hot places before mentioned are from about three to four  hundred feet perpendicular above these springs, and on the slope of the  same ridge with the volcano; that is, there are no vallies between them,  but such as are formed in the ridge itself; nor is the volcano on the  highest part of the ridge, but on the S.E. side of it. This is, I have been  told, contrary to the general opinion of philosophers, who say that  volcanos must be on the summits of the highest hills. So far is this from  being the case on this island, that some of its hills are more than double  the height of that on which the volcano is, and close to it. To these  remarks I must add, that, in wet or moist weather, the volcano was most  violent. There seems to be room for some philosophical reasoning on these  phenomena of nature; but not having any talent that way, I must content  myself with stating facts as I found them, and leave the causes to men of  more abilities.    The tiller was now finished; but, as the wind was unfavourable for sailing,  the guard was sent on shore on the 19th as before, and a party of men to  cut up and bring off the remainder of the tree from which we had got the  tiller. Having nothing else to do, I went on shore with them, and finding a  good number of the natives collected about the landing-place as usual, I  distributed among them all the articles I had with me, and then went on  board for more. In less than an hour I returned, just as our people were  getting some large logs into the boat. At the same time four or five of the  natives stepped forward to see what we were about, and as we did not allow  them to come within certain limits, unless to pass along the beach, the  centry ordered them, back, which they readily complied with. At this time,  having my eyes fixed on them, I observed the sentry present his piece (as I  thought at these men,) and was just going to reprove him for it, because I  had observed that, whenever this was done, some of the natives would hold  up their arms, to let us see they were equally ready. But I was astonished  beyond measure when the sentry fired, for I saw not the least cause. At  this outrage most of the people fled; it was only a few I could prevail on  to remain. As they ran off, I observed one man to fall; and he was  immediately lifted up by two others, who took him into the water, and  washed his wound, and then led him off. Presently after, some came and  described to me the nature of his wound; and as I found he was not carried  far, I sent for the surgeon. As soon as he arrived, I went with him to the  man, whom, we found expiring. The ball had struck his left arm, which was  much shattered, and then entered his body by the short ribs, one of which  was broken. The rascal who fired, pretended that a man had laid an arrow  across his bow, and was going to shoot at him, so that he apprehended  himself in danger. But this was no more than they had always done, and with  no other view than to shew they were armed as well as we; at least I have  reason to think so, as they never went farther. What made this incident the  more unfortunate was, it not appearing to be the man who bent the bow, that  was shot, but one who stood by him. This affair threw the natives into the  utmost consternation; and a few that were prevailed on to stay, ran to the  plantations and brought cocoa-nuts, etc. which they laid down at our feet.  So soon, were those daring people humbled! When I went on board to dinner,  they all retired, and only a few appeared in the afternoon, amongst whom  were Paowang and Wha-a-gou. I had not seen this young man since the day he  had dined on board. Both he and Paowang promised to bring me fruit, etc. the  next morning, but our early departure put it out of their power.    CHAPTER VI.    _Departure from Tanna; with some Account of its Inhabitants, their  Manners and Arts._    1774 August    During the night the wind had veered round to S.E. As this was favourable  for getting out of the harbour, at four o'clock in the morning of the 20th,  we began to unmoor, and at eight, having weighed our last anchor, put to  sea. As soon as we were clear of the land, I brought-to, waiting for the  launch, which was left behind to take up a kedge-anchor and hawser we had  out, to cast by. About day-break a noise was heard in the woods, nearly  abreast of us, on the east side of the harbour, not unlike singing of  psalms. I was told that the like had been heard at the same time every  morning, but it never came to my knowledge till now, when it was too late  to learn the occasion of it. Some were of opinion, that at the east point  of the harbour (where we observed, in coming in, some houses, boats, etc.)  was something sacred to religion, because some of our people had attempted  to go to this point, and were prevented by the natives. I thought, and do  still think, it was owing to a desire they shewed on every occasion, of  fixing bounds to our excursions. So far as we had once been, we might go  again; but not farther with their consent. But by encroaching a little  every time, our country expeditions were insensibly extended without giving  the least umbrage. Besides, these morning ceremonies, whether religious or  not, were not performed down at that point, but in a part where some of our  people had been daily.    I cannot say what might be the true cause of these people shewing such  dislike to our going up into their country. It might be owing to a  naturally jealous disposition, or perhaps to their being accustomed to  hostile visits from their neighbours, or quarrels among themselves.  Circumstances seemed to shew that such must frequently happen; for we  observed them very expert in arms, and well accustomed to them; seldom or  never travelling without them. It is possible all this might be on our  account; but I hardly think it. We never gave them the least molestation,  nor did we touch any part of their property, not even the wood and water,  without first having obtained their consent. The very cocoa-nuts, hanging  over the heads of the workmen, were as safe as those in the middle of the  island. It happened rather fortunately, that there were so many cocoa-nut  trees, near the skirts of the harbour, which seemed not to be private  property; so that we could generally prevail on the natives to bring us  some of these nuts, when nothing would induce them to bring any out of the  country.    We were not wholly without refreshments; for besides the fish, which our  seine now and then provided us with, we procured daily some fruits or roots  from the natives, though but little in proportion to what we could consume.  The reason why we got no more might be our having nothing to give them in  exchange, which they thought valuable. They had not the least knowledge of  iron; consequently, nails and iron tools, beads, etc. which had so great a  run at the more eastern isles, were of no consideration here; and cloth can  be of no use to people who go naked.    The produce of this island is bread-fruit, plantains, cocoa-nuts, a fruit  like a nectarine, yams, tarra, a sort of potatoe, sugar-cane, wild figs, a  fruit like an orange, which is not eatable, and some other fruit and nuts  whose names I have not. Nor have I any doubt that the nutmeg before  mentioned was the produce of this island. The bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and  plantains, are neither so plentiful nor so good as at Otaheite; on the  other hand, sugar-canes and yams are not only in greater plenty, but of  superior quality, and much larger. We got one of the latter which weighed  fifty-six pounds, every ounce of which was good. Hogs did not seem to be  scarce; but we saw not many fowls. These are the only domestic animals they  have. Land-birds are not more numerous than at Otaheite, and the other  islands; but we met with some small birds, with a very beautiful plumage,  which we had never seen before. There is as great a variety of trees and  plants here, as at any island we touched at, where our botanists had time  to examine. I believe these people live chiefly on the produce of the land,  and that the sea contributes but little to their subsistence. Whether this  arises from the coast not abounding with fish, or from their being bad  fishermen, I know not; both causes perhaps concur. I never saw any sort of  fishing-tackle amongst them, nor any one out fishing, except on the shoals,  or along the shores of the harbour, where they would watch to strike with a  dart such fish as came within their reach; and in this they were expert.  They seemed much to admire our catching fish with the seine; and, I  believe, were not well pleased with it at last. I doubt not, they have  other methods of catching fish besides striking them.    We understood that the little isle of Immer was chiefly inhabited by  fishermen, and that the canoes we frequently saw pass, to and from that  isle and the east point of the harbour, were fishing canoes. These canoes  were of unequal sizes, some thirty feet long, two broad, and three deep;  and they are composed of several pieces of wood clumsily sewed together  with bandages. The joints are covered on the outside by a thin batten  champered off at the edges, over which the bandages pass. They are  navigated either by paddles or sails.
