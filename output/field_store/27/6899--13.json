[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18269"],[0,"Pascal's Pens√©es (#14)"],[1,"for man to yield to pain, and it is disgraceful to  yield to pleasure. This is not because pain comes to us from without,  and we ourselves seek pleasure; for it is possible to seek pain, and  yield to it purposely, without this kind of baseness. Whence comes it,  then, that reason thinks it honourable to succumb under stress of pain,  and disgraceful to yield to the attack of pleasure? It is because pain  does not tempt and attract us. It is we ourselves who choose it  voluntarily, and will it to prevail over us. So that we are masters of  the situation; and in this man yields to himself. But in pleasure it is  man who yields to pleasure. Now only mastery and sovereignty bring  glory, and only slavery brings shame.      161    _Vanity._--How wonderful it is that a thing so evident as the vanity of  the world is so little known, that it is a strange and surprising thing  to say that it is foolish to seek greatness!      162    He who will know fully the vanity of man has only to consider the causes  and effects of love. The cause is a _je ne sais quoi_ (Corneille),[76]  and the effects are dreadful. This _je ne sais quoi_, so small an object  that we cannot recognise it, agitates a whole country, princes, armies,  the entire world.    Cleopatra's nose: had it been shorter, the whole aspect of the world  would have been altered.      163    _Vanity._--The cause and the effects of love: Cleopatra.      164    He who does not see the vanity of the world is himself very vain. Indeed  who do not see it but youths who are absorbed in fame, diversion, and  the thought of the future? But take away diversion, and you will see  them dried up with weariness. They feel then their nothingness without  knowing it; for it is indeed to be unhappy to be in insufferable sadness  as soon as we are reduced to thinking of self, and have no diversion.      165    _Thoughts._--_In omnibus requiem quaesivi._[77] If our condition were  truly happy, we would not need diversion from thinking of it in order to  make ourselves happy.      166    _Diversion._--Death is easier to bear without thinking of it, than is  the thought of death without peril.      167    The miseries of human life have established all this: as men have seen  this, they have taken up diversion.      168    _Diversion._--As men are not able to fight against death, misery,  ignorance, they have taken it into their heads, in order to be happy,  not to think of them at all.      169    Despite these miseries, man wishes to be happy, and only wishes to be  happy, and cannot wish not to be so. But how will he set about it? To be  happy he would have to make himself immortal; but, not being able to do  so, it has occurred to him to prevent himself from thinking of death.      170    _Diversion._--If man were happy, he would be the more so, the less he  was diverted, like the Saints and God.--Yes; but is it not to be happy  to have a faculty of being amused by diversion?--No; for that comes from  elsewhere and from without, and thus is dependent, and therefore subject  to be disturbed by a thousand accidents, which bring inevitable griefs.      171    _Misery._--The only thing which consoles us for our miseries is  diversion, and yet this it the greatest of our miseries. For it is this  which principally hinders us from reflecting upon ourselves, and which  makes us insensibly ruin ourselves. Without this we should be in a state  of weariness, and this weariness would spur us to seek a more solid  means of escaping from it. But diversion amuses us, and leads us  unconsciously to death.      172    We do not rest satisfied with the present. We anticipate the future as  too slow in coming, as if in order to hasten its course; or we recall  the past, to stop its too rapid flight. So imprudent are we that we  wander in the times which are not ours, and do not think of the only one  which belongs to us; and so idle are we that we dream of those times  which are no more, and thoughtlessly overlook that which alone exists.  For the present is generally painful to us. We conceal it from our  sight, because it troubles us; and if it be delightful to us, we regret  to see it pass away. We try to sustain it by the future, and think of  arranging matters which are not in our power, for a time which we have  no certainty of reaching.    Let each one examine his thoughts, and he will find them all occupied  with the past and the future. We scarcely ever think of the present; and  if we think of it, it is only to take light from it to arrange the  future. The present is never our end. The past and the present are our  means; the future alone is our end.[78] So we never live, but we hope to  live; and, as we are always preparing to be happy, it is inevitable we  should never be so.      173    They say that eclipses foretoken misfortune, because misfortunes are  common, so that, as evil happens so often, they often foretell it;  whereas if they said that they predict good fortune, they would often be  wrong. They attribute good fortune only to rare conjunctions of the  heavens; so they seldom fail in prediction.      174    _Misery._--Solomon[79] and Job have best known and best spoken of the  misery of man; the former the most fortunate, and the latter the most  unfortunate of men; the former knowing the vanity of pleasures from  experience, the latter the reality of evils.      175    We know ourselves so little, that many think they are about to die when  they are well, and many think they are well when they are near death,  unconscious of approaching fever,[80] or of the abscess ready to form  itself.      176    Cromwell[81] was about to ravage all Christendom; the royal family was  undone, and his own for ever established, save for a little grain of  sand which formed in his ureter. Rome herself was trembling under him;  but this small piece of gravel having formed there, he is dead, his  family cast down, all is peaceful, and the king is restored.      177    [Three hosts.[82]] Would he who had possessed the friendship of the King  of England, the King of Poland, and the Queen of Sweden, have believed  he would lack a refuge and shelter in the world?      178    Macrobius:[83] on the innocents slain by Herod.      179    When Augustus learnt that Herod's own son was amongst the infants under  two years of age, whom he had caused to be slain, he said that it was  better to be Herod's pig than his son.--Macrobius, _Sat._, book ii,  chap. 4.      180    The great and the humble have the same misfortunes, the same griefs, the  same passions;[84] but the one is at the top of the wheel, and the other  near the centre, and so less disturbed by the same revolutions.      181    We are so unfortunate that we can only take pleasure in a thing on  condition of being annoyed if it turn out ill, as a thousand things can  do, and do every hour. He who should find the secret of rejoicing in the  good, without troubling himself with its contrary evil, would have hit  the mark. It is perpetual motion.      182    Those who have always good hope in the midst of misfortunes, and who are  delighted with good luck, are suspected of being very pleased with the  ill success of the affair, if they are not equally distressed by bad  luck; and they are overjoyed to find these pretexts of hope, in order to  show that they are concerned and to conceal by the joy which they feign  to feel that which they have at seeing the failure of the matter.      183    We run carelessly to the precipice, after we have put something before  us to prevent us seeing it.          SECTION III    OF THE NECESSITY OF THE WAGER      184    A letter to incite to the search after God.    And then to make people seek Him among the philosophers, sceptics, and  dogmatists, who disquiet him who inquires of them.      185    The conduct of God, who disposes all things kindly, is to put religion  into the mind by reason, and into the heart by grace. But to will to put  it into the mind and heart by force and threats is not to put religion  there, but terror, _terorrem potius quam religionem_.      186    _Nisi terrerentur et non docerentur, improba quasi dominatio videretur_  (Aug., Ep. 48 or 49), _Contra Mendacium ad Consentium_.      187    _Order._--Men despise religion; they hate it, and fear it is true. To  remedy this, we must begin by showing that religion is not contrary to  reason; that it is venerable, to inspire respect for it; then we must  make it lovable, to make good men hope it is true; finally, we must  prove it is true.    Venerable, because it has perfect knowledge of man; lovable, because it  promises the true good.      188    In every dialogue and discourse, we must be able to say to those who  take offence, \"Of what do you complain?\"      189    To begin by pitying unbelievers; they are wretched enough by their  condition. We ought only to revile them where it is beneficial; but this  does them harm.      190    To pity atheists who seek, for are they not unhappy enough? To inveigh  against those who make a boast of it.      191    And will this one scoff at the other? Who ought to scoff? And yet, the  latter does not scoff at the other, but pities him.      192    To reproach Miton[85] with not being troubled, since God will reproach  him.      193    _Quid fiet hominibus qui minima contemnunt, majora non credunt?_      194    ... Let them at least learn what is the religion they attack, before  attacking it. If this religion boasted of having a clear view of God,  and of possessing it open and unveiled, it would be attacking it to say  that we see nothing in the world which shows it with this clearness. But  since, on the contrary, it says that men are in darkness and estranged  from God, that He has hidden Himself from their knowledge, that this is  in fact the name which He gives Himself in the Scriptures, _Deus  absconditus_;[86] and finally, if it endeavours equally to establish  these two things:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18273"],[0,"The Wild Tribes of Davao District, Mindanao (#14)"],[1,"those who fail to show them respect, or who violate  the rules governing family life.    XII. Diwata. A class of numerous spirits who serve Eugpamolak Manobo.    XIII. Anito. A name applied to a great body of spirits, some of whom are  said formerly to have been people. They know all medicines and cures for  illness, and it is from them that the _mabalian_ secures her knowledge  and her power. They also assist the _tigyama_ in caring for the  families.    XIV. Buso. Mean, evil spirits who eat dead people and have some power to  injure the living. A young Bagobo described his idea of a _buso_ as  follows: \"He has a long body, long feet and neck, curly hair, and black  face, flat nose, and one big red or yellow eye. He has big feet and  fingers, but small arms, and his two big teeth are long and pointed.  Like a dog he goes about eating anything, even dead persons.\" As already  noted, the people of Malilla are inclined to identify the _gimokod_ of  the left side with this evil class.    XV. Tagamaling. Evil spirits who dwell in big trees.    XVI. Tigbanua. Ill disposed beings inhabiting rocks and cliffs in the  mountains. These last two classes are frequently confused with the  _buso_.    In addition to these, the old men of Malilla gave the following:    1. Tagareso. Low spirits who cause people to become angry and to do  little evil deeds. In some cases they cause insanity.    2. Sarinago. Spirits who steal rice. It is best to appease them,  otherwise the supply of rice will vanish rapidly.    3. Tagasoro. Beings who cause sudden anger which results in quarrels and  death. They are the ones who furnish other spirits with human flesh.    4 and 5. Balinonok and his wife Balinsogo. This couple love blood and  for this reason cause men and women to fight or to run amuck.    6. Siring. Mischievous spirits who inhabit caves, cliffs, and dangerous  places. They have long nails and can be distinguished by that  characteristic. They sometimes impersonate members of the family and  thus succeed in stealing women and children, whom they carry to their  mountain homes. The captives are not eaten but are fed on snakes and  worms, and should they try to escape the _siring_ will scratch them with  their long nails.    Other spirits were named and described by individuals, but as they are  not generally accepted by the people of the tribe they are not mentioned  here.    The stars, thunder and lightning, and similar phenomena are generally  considered as \"lights or signs\" belonging to the spirits, yet one  frequently hears hazy tales such as that \"the constellation Marara is a  one-legged and one-armed man who sometimes causes cloudy weather at  planting time so that people may not see his deformities,\" or we are  told that \"the sun was placed in the sky by the creator, and on it lives  an evil spirit who sometimes kills people. The sun is moved about by the  wind;\" again, \"the sun and moon were once married and all the stars are  their children.\"    Despite repeated assertions by previous writers that the Bagobo are  fire-worshippers no evidence was obtained during our visit to support  the statement. The older people insisted that it was not a spirit and  that no offerings were ever made to it. One _mabalian_ stated that fire  was injurious to a woman in her periods and hence it was best for her  not to cook at such times; she was also of the opinion that fire was of  two kinds, good and bad, and hence might belong to both good and bad  spirits.    A common method used by the spirits to communicate with mortals is  through the call of the _limokon_[44] All the people know the meaning of  its calls and all respect its warnings. If a man is starting to buy or  trade for an article and this bird gives its warning the sale is  stopped. Should the _limokon_ call when a person is on the trail he at  ones doubles his fist and thrusts it in the direction from which the  warning comes. If it becomes necessary to point backwards, it is a  signal to return, or should the arm point directly in front it is  certain that danger is there, and it is best to turn back and avoid it.  When it is not clear from whence the note came, the traveler looks  toward the right side. If he sees there strong, sturdy trees, he knows  that all is well, but if they are cut or weaklings, he should use great  care to avoid impending danger. When questioned as to why one should  look only to the right, an old man quickly replied: \"The right side  belongs to you; the left side is bad and belongs to someone else.\"    [44] See p. 63, note. [Transcriber's note: footnote above beginning, \"A  dove.\"]    Sneezing is a bad omen, and should a person sneeze when about to  undertake a journey, he knows that it is a warning of danger, and will  delay until another time.    Certain charms, or actions, are of value either in warding off evil  spirits, in causing trouble or death to an enemy, or in gaining an  advantage over another in trading and in games. One type of charm is a  narrow cloth belt in which \"medicines\" are tied. These medicines may be  peculiarly shaped stones, bits of fungus growth, a tooth, shell, or  similar object. Such belts are known as _pamadan_, or _lambos_, and are  worn soldier-fashion over one shoulder. They are supposed to protect  their owners in battle or to make it easy for them to get the best of  other parties in a trade, A little dust gathered from the footprint of  an enemy and placed in one of these belts will immediately cause the foe  to become ill.    It is a simple matter to cause a person to become insane. All that is  needed is to secure a piece of his hair, or clothing, place it in a dish  of water and stir in one direction for several hours.    Father GISBERT relates the following method of detecting theft:    \"There are not, as a rule, many thefts among the Bagobo, for they  believe that a thief can be discovered easily by means of their famous  _bongat_. That consists of two small joints of bamboo, which contain  certain mysterious powders. He who has been robbed and wishes to  determine the robber takes a hen's egg, makes a hole in it, puts a pinch  of the above said powder in it, and leaves it in the fire. If he wishes  the robber to die he has nothing else to do than to break the egg; but  since the thief may sometimes be a relative or a beloved person, the egg  is not usually broken, so that there may be or may be able to be a  remedy. For under all circumstances, when this operation is performed,  if the robber lives, wherever he may be, he himself must inform on  himself by crying out, 'I am the thief; I am the thief,' as he is  compelled to do (they say) by the sharp pain which he feels all through  his body. When he is discovered, he may be cured by putting powder from  the other joint into the water and bathing his body with it. This  practice is very common here among the heathens and Moros. A Bagobo,  named Anas, who was converted, gave me the _bongat_ with which he had  frightened many people when a heathen.\"    In Bansalan crab shells are hung over the doors of houses, for these  shells are distasteful to the _buso_ who will thus be kept at a  distance.    I was frequently told of persons who could foretell the future by means  of palmistry, but was never able to see a palmist at work, or to verify  the information.    MUSIC, DANCES AND CEREMONIES.    The music for the dances is generally furnished by one or more persons  beating on several _agongs_ of different sizes and notes, which are  suspended in regular order from the house rafters (Plate XXXa). The  player stands in front of the line and begins to beat the instruments  with a padded stick. Oftentimes he is accompanied by a man who strikes a  wooden drum with the palm of one hand and a stick held in the other. The  music grows faster, emphasizing certain beats, until it becomes a  compelling rhythm that starts the feet of the onlookers, and suddenly a  man or woman begins to dance. At first she keeps time to the music by  raising on her toes and heels, bending the knees and twisting the body  from side to side, but soon she becomes more animated, the feet are  raised high above the floor and brought down with a sort of shuffle  which reminds one of the sound made by the feet of a clog dancer. Still  swaying her body, she begins to circle, contra-clockwise, around the  gongs, and soon she is joined by others until all the dancing space is  filled. The scene is most picturesque, for these dances usually occur at  night, in rooms illuminated only by the flickering light of torches. The  rich clothing of the participants loses nothing of its beauty in this  dim light, while the bells and rattles with which each dancer surrounds  arms, legs and ankles, add to the din and weirdness of the occasion.  Before the dance has progressed far the musicians begin to keep time  with their feet and frequently dance away from their instruments,  circle, and then return to continue the music.    With slight variation, this is the dance used on all occasions. At  certain ceremonies small gongs, or the _bolang bolang_,[45] replace the  _agongs_, and at times also a single dancer will accompany himself on  the _kodlon_--a long wooden guitar with rattan strings (Plate XXXb).    [45] An instrument made by placing a small board on a rice mortar. This  is pounded or beaten with short sticks, or with the wooden pestles.    In this description we have named a large share of the musical  instruments used by the Bagobo. The women frequently play on a sort of  guitar made of a section of bamboo from the outside of which narrow  strings are cut. These are raised and made taut with small wooden  bridges and are then picked with a stick or the fingers (Fig. 33).  Bamboo Jew's-harps and mouth flutes are played by the men, but the nose  flute, so common in most parts of the Philippines, was not seen in use  here.    FIG. 33. TAW-GAU OR BAMBOO GUITAR.
