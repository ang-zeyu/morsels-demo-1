S: Then hasten on from the Place from which the people hasten on and ask  the forgiveness of Allah; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.    002.200  Y: So when ye have accomplished your holy rites, celebrate the praises  of Allah, as ye used to celebrate the praises of your fathers,- yea,  with far more Heart and soul. There are men who say: \"Our Lord! Give us  (Thy bounties) in this world!\" but they will have no portion in the  Hereafter.    P: And when ye have completed your devotions, then remember Allah as ye  remember your fathers or with a more lively remembrance. But of mankind  is he who saith: \"Our Lord! Give unto us in the world,\" and he hath no  portion in the Hereafter.    S: So when you have performed your devotions, then laud Allah as you  lauded your fathers, rather a greater lauding. But there are some  people who say, Our Lord! give us in the world, and they shall have no  resting place.    002.201  Y: And there are men who say: \"Our Lord! Give us good in this world and  good in the Hereafter, and defend us from the torment of the Fire!\"    P: And of them (also) is he who saith: \"Our Lord! Give unto us in the  world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and  guard us from the doom of Fire.\"    S: And there are some among them who say: Our Lord! grant us good in  this world and good in the hereafter, and save us from the chastisement  of the fire.    002.202  Y: To these will be allotted what they have earned; and Allah is quick  in account.    P: For them there is in store a goodly portion out of that which they  have earned. Allah is swift at reckoning.    S: They shall have (their) portion of what they have earned, and Allah  is swift in reckoning.    002.203  Y: Celebrate the praises of Allah during the Appointed Days. But if any  one hastens to leave in two days, there is no blame on him, and if any  one stays on, there is no blame on him, if his aim is to do right. Then  fear Allah, and know that ye will surely be gathered unto Him.    P: Remember Allah through the appointed days. Then whoso hasteneth (his  departure) by two days, it is no sin for him, and whoso delayeth, it is  no sin for him; that is for him who wardeth off (evil). Be careful of  your duty to Allah, and know that unto Him ye will be gathered.    S: And laud Allah during the numbered days; then whoever hastens off in  two days, there is no blame on him, and whoever remains behind, there  is no blame on him, (this is) for him who guards (against evil), and be  careful (of your duty) to Allah, and know that you shall be gathered  together to Him.    002.204  Y: There is the type of man whose speech about this world's life May  dazzle thee, and he calls Allah to witness about what is in his heart;  yet is he the most contentious of enemies.    P: And of mankind there is he whoso conversation on the life of this  world pleaseth thee (Muhammad), and he calleth Allah to witness as to  that which is in his heart; yet he is the most rigid of opponents.    S: And among men is he whose speech about the life of this world causes  you to wonder, and he calls on Allah to witness as to what is in his  heart, yet he is the most violent of adversaries.    002.205  Y: When he turns his back, His aim everywhere is to spread mischief  through the earth and destroy crops and cattle. But Allah loveth not  mischief.    P: And when he turneth away (from thee) his effort in the land is to  make mischief therein and to destroy the crops and the cattle; and  Allah loveth not mischief.    S: And when he turns back, he runs along in the land that he may cause  mischief in it and destroy the tilth and the stock, and Allah does not  love mischief-making.    002.206  Y: When it is said to him, \"Fear Allah\", He is led by arrogance to  (more) crime. Enough for him is Hell;-An evil bed indeed (To lie on)!    P: And when it is said unto him: Be careful of thy duty to Allah, pride  taketh him to sin. Hell will settle his account, an evil resting-place.    S: And when it is said to him, guard against (the punishment of) Allah;  pride carries him off to sin, therefore hell is sufficient for him; and  certainly it is an evil resting place.    002.207  Y: And there is the type of man who gives his life to earn the pleasure  of Allah: And Allah is full of kindness to (His) devotees.    P: And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of  Allah; and Allah hath compassion on (His) bondmen.    S: And among men is he who sells himself to seek the pleasure of Allah;  and Allah is Affectionate to the servants.    002.208  Y: O ye who believe! Enter into Islam whole-heartedly; and follow not  the footsteps of the evil one; for he is to you an avowed enemy.    P: O ye who believe! Come, all of you, into submission (unto Him); and  follow not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! he is an open enemy for you.    S: O you who believe! enter into submission one and all and do not  follow the footsteps of Shaitan; surely he is your open enemy.    002.209  Y: If ye backslide after the clear (Signs) have come to you, then know  that Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.    P: And if ye slide back after the clear proofs have come unto you, then  know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.    S: But if you slip after clear arguments have come to you, then know  that Allah is Mighty, Wise.    002.210  Y: Will they wait until Allah comes to them in canopies of clouds, with  angels (in His train) and the question is (thus) settled? but to Allah  do all questions go back (for decision).    P: Wait they for naught else than that Allah should come unto them in  the shadows of the clouds with the angels? Then the case would be  already judged. All cases go back to Allah (for judgment).    S: They do not wait aught but that Allah should come to them in the  shadows of the clouds along with the angels, and the matter has  (already) been decided; and (all) matters are returned to Allah.    002.211  Y: Ask the Children of Israel how many clear (Signs) We have sent them.  But if any one, after Allah's favour has come to him, substitutes  (something else), Allah is strict in punishment.    P: Ask of the Children of Israel how many a clear revelation We gave  them! He who altereth the grace of Allah after it hath come unto him  (for him), lo! Allah is severe in punishment.    S: Ask the Israelites how many a clear sign have We given them; and  whoever changes the favor of Allah after it has come to him, then  surely Allah is severe in requiting (evil).    002.212  Y: The life of this world is alluring to those who reject faith, and  they scoff at those who believe. But the righteous will be above them  on the Day of Resurrection; for Allah bestows His abundance without  measure on whom He will.    P: Beautified is the life of the world for those who disbelieve; they  make a jest of the believers. But those who keep their duty to Allah  will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. Allah giveth without  stint to whom He will.    S: The life of this world is made to seem fair to those who disbelieve,  and they mock those who believe, and those who guard (against evil)  shall be above them on the day of resurrection; and Allah gives means  of subsistence to whom he pleases without measure.    002.213  Y: Mankind was one single nation, and Allah sent Messengers with glad  tidings and warnings; and with them He sent the Book in truth, to judge  between people in matters wherein they differed; but the People of the  Book, after the clear Signs came to them, did not differ among  themselves, except through selfish contumacy. Allah by His Grace Guided  the believers to the Truth, concerning that wherein they differed. For  Allah guided whom He will to a path that is straight.    P: Mankind were one community, and Allah sent (unto them) prophets as  bearers of good tidings and as warners, and revealed therewith the  Scripture with the truth that it might judge between mankind concerning  that wherein they differed. And only those unto whom (the Scripture)  was given differed concerning it, after clear proofs had come unto  them, through hatred one of another. And Allah by His Will guided those  who believe unto the truth of that concerning which they differed.  Allah guideth whom He will unto a straight path.    S: (All) people are a single nation; so Allah raised prophets as bearers  of good news and as warners, and He revealed with them the Book with  truth, that it might judge between people in that in which they  differed; and none but the very people who were given it differed about  it after clear arguments had come to them, revolting among themselves;  so Allah has guided by His will those who believe to the truth about  which they differed and Allah guides whom He pleases to the right path.    002.214  Y: Or do ye think that ye shall enter the Garden (of bliss) without such  (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? they encountered  suffering and adversity, and were so shaken in spirit that even the  Messenger and those of faith who were with him cried: \"When (will come)  the help of Allah?\" Ah! Verily, the help of Allah is (always) near!    P: Or think ye that ye will enter paradise while yet there hath not come  unto you the like of (that which came to) those who passed away before  you? Affliction and adversity befell them, they were shaken as with  earthquake, till the messenger (of Allah) and those who believed along  with him said: When cometh Allah's help? Now surely Allah's help is  nigh.    S: Or do you think that you would enter the garden while yet the state  of those who have passed away before you has not come upon you;  distress and affliction befell them and they were shaken violently, so  that the Messenger and those who believed with him said: When will the  help of Allah come? Now surely the help of Allah is nigh!    002.215  Y: They ask thee what they should spend (In"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16957"],[0,"Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tour (#14)"],[1," Independently of the absurdity of a man risking his neck for the sake of  picking up a bunch of red herrings, Mr. Sponge, having beat everybody,  could afford a little humanity, more especially as he rode his horse on  sale, and there was now no one left to witness the further prowess of the  steed. Accordingly, he availed himself of a heavy, newly-ploughed fallow,  upon which he landed as he cleared the brook, for pulling up, and returned  just as Mr. Spareneck, assisted by one of the whips, succeeded in landing  Caingey on the taking-off side. Caingey was not a pretty boy at the best of  times--none but the most partial parents could think him one--and his  clumsy-featured, short, compressed face, and thick, lumpy figure, were  anything but improved by a sort of pea-green net-work of water-weeds with  which he arose from his bath. He was uncommonly well soaked, and had to be  held up by the heels to let the water run out of his boots, pockets, and  clothes. In this undignified position he was found by Mr. Waffles and such  of the field as had ridden the line.    'Why, Caingey, old boy! you look like a boiled porpoise with parsley  sauce!' exclaimed Mr. Waffles, pulling up where the unfortunate youth was  spluttering and getting emptied like a jug. 'Confound it!' added he, as  the water came gurgling out of his mouth, 'but you must have drunk the  brook dry.'    Caingey would have censured his inhumanity, but knowing the imprudence of  quarrelling with his bread and butter, and also aware of the laughable,  drowned-rat figure he must then be cutting, he thought it best to laugh,  and take his change out of Mr. Waffles another time. Accordingly, he  chuckled and laughed too, though his jaws nearly refused their office, and  kindly transferred the blame of the accident from the horse to himself.    [Illustration: MR. CAINGEY THORNTON DOESN'T 'PUT ON STEAM ENOUGH']    'He didn't put on steam enough,' he said.    Meanwhile, old Tom, who had gone on with the hounds, having availed himself  of a well-known bridge, a little above where Thornton went in, for getting  over the brook, and having allowed a sufficient time to elapse for the  proper completion of the farce, was now seen rounding the opposite hill,  with his hounds clustered about his horse, with his mind conning over one  of those imaginary runs that experienced huntsmen know so well how to  tell, when there is no one to contradict them.    Having quartered his ground to get at his old friend the bridge again, he  just trotted up with well-assumed gaiety as Caingey Thornton spluttered the  last piece of green weed out from between his great thick lips.    'Well, Tom!' exclaimed Mr. Waffles, 'what have you done with him?'    'Killed him, sir,' replied Tom, with a slight touch of his cap, as though  'killing' was a matter of every-day occurrence with them.    'Have you, indeed!' exclaimed Mr. Waffles, adopting the lie with avidity.    'Yes, sir,' said Tom gravely; 'he was nearly beat afore he got to the  brook. Indeed, I thought Vanquisher would have had him in it; but, however,  he got through, and the scent failed on the fallow, which gave him a  chance; but I held them on to the hedgerow beyond, where they hit it off  like wildfire, and they never stopped again till they tumbled him over at  the back of Mr. Plummey's farm-buildings, at Shapwick. I've got his brush,'  added Tom, producing a much tattered one from his pocket, 'if you'd like to  have it?'    'Thank you, no--yes--no,' replied Waffles, not wanting to be bothered with  it; 'yet stay,' continued he, as his eye caught Mr. Sponge, who was still  on foot beside his vanquished friend; 'give it to Mr. What-de-ye-call-'em,'  added he, nodding towards our hero.    'Sponge,' observed Tom, in an undertone, giving the brush to his master.    'Mr. Sponge, will you do me the favour to accept the brush?' asked Mr.  Waffles, advancing with it towards him; adding, 'I am sorry this unlucky  bather should have prevented your seeing the end.'    Mr. Sponge was a pretty good judge of brushes, and not a bad one of  camphire; but if this one had smelt twice as strong as it did--indeed, if  it had dropped to pieces in his hand, or the moths had flown up in his  face, he would have pocketed it, seeing it paved the way to what he  wanted--an introduction.    'I'm very much obliged, I'm sure,' observed he, advancing to take  it--'very much obliged, indeed; been an extremely good run, and fast.'    'Very fair--very fair,' observed Mr. Waffles, as though it were nothing in  their way; 'seven miles in twenty minutes, I suppose, or something of that  sort.'    '_One_-and-twenty,' interposed Tom, with a laudable anxiety for accuracy.    'Ah! one-and-twenty,' rejoined Mr. Waffles. 'I thought it would be  somewhere thereabouts. Well, I suppose we've all had enough,' added he,  'may as well go home and have some luncheon, and then a game at billiards,  or rackets, or something. How's the old water-rat?' added he, turning to  Thornton, who was now busy emptying his cap and mopping the velvet.    The water-rat was as well as could be expected, but did not quite like the  new aspect of affairs. He saw that Mr. Sponge was a first-rate horseman,  and also knew that nothing ingratiated one man with another so much as  skill and boldness in the field. It was by that means, indeed, that he had  established himself in Mr. Waffles' good graces--an ingratiation that had  been pretty serviceable to him, both in the way of meat, drink, mounting,  and money. Had Mr. Sponge been, like himself, a needy, penniless  adventurer, Caingey would have tried to have kept him out by some of those  plausible, admonitory hints, that poverty makes men so obnoxious to; but in  the case of a rich, flourishing individual, with such an astonishing stud  as Leather made him out to have, it was clearly Caingey's policy to knock  under and be subservient to Mr. Sponge also. Caingey, we should observe,  was a bold, reckless rider, never seeming to care for his neck, but he was  no match for Mr. Sponge, who had both skill and courage.    Caingey being at length cleansed from his weeds, wiped from his mud, and  made as comfortable as possible under the circumstances, was now hoisted on  to the renowned steeple-chase horse again, who had scrambled out of the  brook on the taking-off side, and, after meandering the banks for a certain  distance, had been caught by the bridle in the branch of a willow--Caingey,  we say, being again mounted, Mr. Sponge also, without hindrance from the  resolute brown horse, the first whip put himself a little in advance, while  old Tom followed with the hounds, and the second whip mingled with the now  increasing field, it being generally understood (by the uninitiated, at  least) that hounds have no business to go home so long as any gentleman is  inclined for a scurrey, no matter whether he has joined early or late. Mr.  Waffles, on the contrary, was very easily satisfied, and never took the  shine off a run with a kill by risking a subsequent defeat. Old Tom, though  keen when others were keen, was not indifferent to his comforts, and soon  came into the way of thinking that it was just as well to get home to his  mutton-chops at two or three o'clock, as to be groping his way about  bottomless bye-roads on dark winter nights.    As he retraced his steps homeward, and overtook the scattered field of the  morning, his talent for invention, or rather stretching, was again called  into requisition.    'What have you done with him, Tom?' asked Major Bouncer, eagerly bringing  his sturdy collar-marked cob alongside of our huntsman.    'Killed him, sir,' replied Tom, with the slightest possible touch of the  cap. (Bouncer was no tip.)    'Indeed!' exclaimed Bouncer, gaily, with that sort of sham satisfaction  that most people express about things that can't concern them in the least.  'Indeed! I'm deuced glad of that! Where did you kill him?'    'At the back of Mr. Plummey's farm-buildings, at Shapwick,' replied Tom;  adding, 'but, my word, he led us a dance afore we got there--up to  Ditchington, down to Somerby, round by Temple Bell Wood, cross Goosegreen  Common, then away for Stubbington Brooms, skirtin' Sanderwick Plantations,  but scarce goin' into 'em, then by the round hill at Camerton leavin' great  Heatherton to the right, and so straight on to Shapwick, where we killed,  with every hound up--'    'God bless me!' exclaimed Bouncer, apparently lost in admiration, though he  scarcely knew the country; 'God bless me!' repeated he, 'what a run! The  finest run that ever was seen.'    'Nine miles in twenty-five minutes,' replied Tom, tacking on a little both  for time and distance.    '_B-o-y_ JOVE!' exclaimed the major.    Having shaken hands with, and congratulated Mr. Waffles most eagerly and  earnestly, the major hurried off to tell as much as he could remember to  the first person he met, just as the cheese-bearer at a christening looks  out for some one to give the cheese to. The cheese-getter on this occasion  was Doctor Lotion, who was going to visit old Jackey Thompson, of  Woolleyburn. Jackey being then in a somewhat precarious state of health,  and tolerably advanced in life, without any very self-evident heir, was  obnoxious to the attentions of three distinct litters of cousins, some one  or other of whom was constantly 'baying him.' Lotion, though a sapient man,  and somewhat grinding in his practice, did not profess to grind old people  young again, and feeling he could do very little for the body corporate,  directed his attention to amusing Jackey's mind, and anything in the shape  of gossip was extremely acceptable to the doctor to retail to his patient.  Moreover, Jackey had been a bit of a sportsman, and was always extremely  happy to see the hounds--_on anybody's land but his own_.    So Lotion got primed with the story, and having gone through the usual  routine of asking his patient how he was, how he had"]]]
