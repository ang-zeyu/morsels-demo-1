Safer to move the bottle or cloth wet with ammonia            slowly back and forth near the nose. Good also for            insect bites.              One roll of adhesive plaster. Cut into lengths for            holding covered ointment or poultice in place, the            strips criss-cross over the poultice, but are not            attached, the ends only are pressed on the bare            skin to which they firmly adhere.              Two rolls of 2-1/2 or 3 inch wide surgeon bandages            (not gauze) for general use where bandages are            needed.              One small package of absorbent cotton.              Two mustard plasters, purchased at drug store;            good for stomachache.              One package of powdered licorice to use as a            laxative. Dissolve a little licorice in water and            drink it. To keep the bowels open means to ward            off a host of evils. It is even more essential            that the inside of the body be kept clean than it            is to have the outside clean. To this end make a            practise of drinking a great deal of pure water;            drink it before breakfast, between meals (not at            meals), and before retiring. If you do this, you            will probably not need other laxative, especially            if you eat fruit either fresh or stewed. Fruit            should form part of every day's fare. _Keep your            bowels open._              One tube of Carron oil, to use for burns or            scalds.              One small bottle of camphor, for headaches.              One small bag of salt--good dissolved in water, 1            teaspoonful to 1 pint of water, for bathing tired            or inflamed eyes, often effects a cure. Good for            bathing affected spots of ivy poison, good for            sore-throat gargle, also for nosebleed; snuff,            then plug nose. Good for brushing teeth. For all            these dissolve salt in water in proportion as            given above.              One white muslin 24-inch triangular bandage, for            arm sling or chest, jaw, and head bandage. A man's            large-sized white handkerchief can be used; never            bind broken skin with colored cloth.              One bottle of fly dope, warranted to keep off            pestiferous flies and mosquitoes. All these may be            kept in one-half of a linen case of pockets, your            toilet articles in the other half, and the case            can be opened out and hung to the side of your            tent or shelter.      =Check List for General Camp=              Two basins, of light metal, paper or collapsible            rubber. The last is easy to pack and light to            carry. One basin will serve for several girls. If            you camp near a body of fresh water let that be            your basin; it will always be ready filled. No            need then to bring water to your shelter, for a            delightful dip in the river or lake every morning            before breakfast will obviate all necessity, and            do away with the otherwise needful hand-basin.              One reliable map of location and surrounding            country for constant reference.              One water-pail, light weight, for every two or            three girls. Can be canvas, aluminum, paper,            rubber, or your own selection in other materials.              Six toilet-paper packages or more.              One or more tents of water-proof material.              One or more sod cloths for tent flooring.              One or more inner tents of cheesecloth for            protection from mosquitoes, etc. These can be made            at home or purchased with the tents at the regular            camp-outfitters'. There is on the market a spray,            claimed to be absolutely effective against            mosquitoes, etc., and to keep both tent and camp            free from pests. One quart is said to last two            weeks with daily use. Cost, fifty cents per quart.              One carborundum stone for sharpening all cutting            tools.              One or more lanterns. Folding candle lanterns may            be purchased, but the simple ten-cent kind with            lamp-chimney for protection of candle are good.            They can be had at country stores in Cresco, Pa.            May possibly be found at camp-outfitters'. If a            glass chimney is to be used, pack most carefully.            Fill the inside of the chimney with stockings,            handkerchiefs, etc.; then wrap the chimney all            over with other soft clothing and tie securely.            Have this outside wrap very thick.              One package of one-half length candles to use in            lantern.              One _tin_ box of one or two dozen safety-matches.            _Tin_ will not catch fire from the matches.              One strong tool-bag with separate labelled pockets            for different tools; each pocket with flap to            fasten securely with dress snaps. In this tool-bag            put assorted nails, mostly big, strong ones,            screws, awl, well-sealed bottle of strong glue,            ball of stout twine, a few rawhide thongs, three            or four yards of soft strong rope, a pair of            scissors, two spools of wire, and several yards of            cheesecloth.              One rope--long for mountain-climbing.      =Check List of Kitchen Utensils=              Two dish-pans, one for piping-hot sudsy water for            washing dishes, the other for scalding-hot rinsing            water. The last pan can also be used for mixing            and bread-making. Select pans strong and of light            weight--canvas, aluminum, or tin--and be sure they            nest or fold.              Two water-pails, fitted one within the other, both            light weight.              One coffee-pot, size to fit in pails, must not be            too high. Cocoa can be made in the coffee-pot.              One frying-pan, for corn-dodgers, flapjacks, fried            mush, eggs, etc.              One folding camp-oven, for hot biscuits, bread            puddings, and many other good things relished by            hungry campers.              One wash-basin, to be kept strictly for washing            hands, when cooking.              One large spoon, for stirring and general use.              One kitchen-knife, suitable for cutting bread,            carving meat, turning pancakes, etc.              One kitchen-fork, strong and big, but not a            toasting-fork.              One Dutch oven pot, a strong seamless pot with            cover, to use for baking, boiling, and stewing.              Three dish-towels, washed after every meal.              One dish mop or cloth, washed and dried after each            meal; dry in sun when possible.              Four large cakes of soap.              One thick holder, for lifting pots. Hang this up            in a certain place where it may always be found            when needed.              One pepper and one salt shaker, small and light in            weight.              One net air-bag, for meat, fish, and anything that            must be kept fresh (Fig. 33) and protected from            the flies. Use strong net and two or more hoops            for the air-bag. With pincers you can twist the            two ends of strong wire together and make the            hoops of size large enough to hold the net out            away from a large piece of meat. Cut the net long            enough to stand above and hang below the meat.            Gather the top edge tightly together and sew it            fast; then sew the hoop near the top of the bag.            Other hoops on either side of centre of bag and a            hoop near bottom of bag, or sew only one hoop at            the top and one at the bottom. Have strong            draw-strings in the bottom of the bag, and fasten            a pendent hook at the top to hold the meat hanging            free inside of the bag. With copper wire attach a            good-sized ring on top of the bag, wire it through            the handle of the pendent hook and weld them            together. When in use, the bag should be suspended            high from the ground by means of a rope pulley run            through the top ring and over the limb of a            near-by tree. Similar air-bags can be obtained, if            desired, from camp-outfitters.    When selecting cooking utensils for the camp, you will find those with  detachable handles pack better and for that reason are desirable.    Do not forget that every check-list given may be reduced; don't think  you must include all the items. For these lists give outfits for  permanent as well as temporary camps. If you can manage with _one towel_  by washing it every day, or evening, allowing it to dry during the  night, one towel will be sufficient; leave the others at home. Drop  from the various lists every article you can possibly dispense with and  still be comfortable in camp.    If you wear the camp suit travelling from home to camp, its weight and  bulk will be omitted from your camp pack, and be so much to your gain,  and you will maintain a good appearance notwithstanding, for if well  made and of proper fit the dress will be a suitable travelling costume.      =Camp Packs=    When you intend carrying your belongings and striking the trail either  part or all the way to camp, the easiest method for portage is to stow  the things in a regular pack and fasten the pack on your back by means  of strong, long straps attached to the pack, and passed over your  shoulders and under your arms.    A square of water-proof canvas makes a simple and good camp pack. Get a  nine-by-nine-feet (more or less) square of cloth, and it will be found  useful as shelter, fly, ground-cloth,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18544"],[0,"Narrative of a Mission to Central Africa Performed in the Years 1850-51, Volume (#14)"],[1,"to good herbage, could not bear comparison. But, of course,  the business, the support, the riches of Mousa, are his camels. They  occupy all his thoughts, and would appear, to a stranger, to be the end  of his existence.    _6th._--This morning at sunrise the thermometer was as low as 52 deg.  Fahrenheit. We shivered with cold.    Dr. Barth arrived early by way of Tintalous. He confirms the news that  the Sultans of Aghadez and Asoudee have completely chastised all those  tribes who stopped us on the road and levied black mail on us.    En-Noor paid us a visit in the morning. After shaking us all in a very  friendly manner by the hands, he expressed his regret that he could not  go with us now to Zinder. The country was not tranquil, and the people  would not consent to his going; but if we wished to proceed immediately  with his principal slave, Zangheema, he assured us we should go safely.  He then left us to reflect upon what we would do. We decided, without a  dissentient voice, that we could not venture to go with Zangheema, and  that we must wait for En-Noor, be the time ever so long. We forwarded  this decision to his highness, who seemed to receive it with  satisfaction. His wife sent us word, \"To be sure not to go without her  husband;\" a piece of advice from a lady we are anxious most religiously  to respect. Dr. Overweg made an application, through Daubala and Yusuf,  to go to the salt-mines of Bilma with the Kailouees. But either the  applicants betrayed the thing, or En-Noor was unwilling to grant  permission. Our friend, therefore, is disappointed of this most  interesting geological excursion.    We are to remove a little further to the west, to a valley more  convenient than this for pitching tents, and under some shelter. We  still hope we shall not be obliged to await the return of the  salt-caravan from Bilma (that is, a month, or forty days) before we  start. Probably, when good news comes from the camp in the west we shall  go on. It will be a sad trial for our patience to wait so long, after  having already dallied more than two months in Tintalous.    _7th._--The thermometer at sunrise stood at 51 deg.--very cold. There are no  signs yet of Zangheema's starting to Damerghou. The people, when sitting  over the fire in the evening, relate jocosely that the jackals, not  being able to come near the flame, and nevertheless feeling the cold  very much, hold up their fore-paws, in a sitting or squatting position,  in imitation of men, towards the fire, be they at ever so great a  distance, and so screw up their imaginations to the belief that they are  warming themselves. The language of gesticulation and signs, by the  movement of different parts of the body, is quite a study in this part  of the world. The most singular gesticulation, and yet the most  significant, is that by which a person begs a thing. He holds the object  in one hand (the left) before the owner, then gives the right hand and  arm a swing round, and at last places the right hand to his bosom--the  meaning of all which is, that he seeks to ascertain if the owner has any  other article of the same description as that which he holds in his left  hand, and whether he is willing to give it to him. When a Kailouee says  a thing is good, he puts the forefinger of his right hand into the  clasped palm of his left, and so, as he pronounces the thing good,  _nagari_, he turns his imprisoned finger round within the closed left  hand. When he says there are many persons, he clasps together the  fingers of his left hand, and forms a good English fist, holding the  hand thumb upwards. He then strikes, with the palm of his right hand,  the fist of his left hand, held in that particular position. This sign  also represents a more indelicate idea, and is used in the same way on  the coast.    The women, from the shepherdess to the princess, of Tintalous, are as  fond of the bustle as European dames; but the important difference is,  it is the natural bustle which they here delight to exhibit to the  admiring male population. If a woman be called to, going off to the well  for water, she does not turn round to see who is calling, but  immediately draws her frock tight round her form, and imparts to it a  most agitated and unnatural swinging motion, to the great satisfaction  of the admiring lookers-on. Thus we see how the coquettes of London and  Paris meet at opposite poles with these of the Sahara and Central  Africa.    Additional applications were made to En-Noor by my colleagues, to go  respectively to Bilma and to Zinder--Dr. Barth wishing to go on with  Zangheema--but without effect. The old Sheikh remained firm in his  refusals: Zangheema, however, was the first to start objections to  Barth's accompanying him. As to Overweg, we think he lost his  opportunity by not treating directly with En-Noor, instead of Hamma his  son-in-law. His highness will do nothing extra for us unless paid.    _8th._--We rose early, and found a large portion of the caravan destined  for Zinder already gone. This is very tiresome to see the people  starting with whom you were to have gone, and to know that you have  still thirty or forty days to wait; and as for expenses, living at  almost as dear a rate as in Tripoli. Our boat has gone with the caravan.    Hereabouts grow a great quantity of wild water-melons, _delaaah_. They  are very small and bitter, but the people, nevertheless, eat them  occasionally. If cultivated they would, of course, soon yield an  excellent supply. Barth represents the road between this and Aghadez as  very woody, and also that the country is everywhere mountainous. Baghzem  is not high, but is, nevertheless, a very large mountain, seen several  days' journey. The high plains without water are also covered with  trees. I hear, also, that the road between this and Damerghou is  exceedingly woody, and the trees of \"the scratching or rending  description,\" like the tholukh. Aheer also abounds in senna.    Yusuf says that all the people of Soudan are red, with the exception of  the inhabitants of Tesaoua, Kanou, Kashna, and Maradee.    Barth represents Gouber as stronger than ever, and united in alliance  with Maradee against the Sultan of Sakkatou. He has written all the  towns. Gouber appears amongst the towns described by Leo Africanus.    _9th._--This morning En-Noor paid us a visit, to tell us to move after  him in the wady near, under the shade of the trees. His highness was  very polite and friendly, as he has now been for some time past.    The weather continues cold--thermometer, 49 deg. at sunrise in the air. This  cold weather ought to strengthen or restore our health. It certainly  would do us good, much good, if we could get meat and soups.    I sent on our boat yesterday to Zinder, with three of our servants,  together with some other heavy baggage. I was occupied to-day in  compiling the Haussa dictionary. Kashna is represented to be the  fountain of the Haussa language, the Florence of Soudan. Kanou is a  place of foreigners, and the language of the city must be much  corrupted. According to En-Noor, _Kal_, in the names _Kal_fadai,  _Kal_tadak, _Kil_gris, and _Kail_ouee, signifies _country_. There are to  be added to the zoology of this country the monkey and the _mohur_, or  fine large gazelle, as large as a deer, called in Haussa _maraia_.  We already find great differences in the pronunciation of the Haussa  language, but especially in the following letters:--_sh_ is confounded  with _ch_ or _tch_, _l_ with _r_, and _r_ with _l_, _o_ with _u_, &c.  Letters are also frequently unnecessarily doubled. These differences,  however, will never much affect the conversation, when the parties are  well agreed upon what subject they are conversing.    _10th._--This morning we are removing to the shade of the trees, near  En-Noor. Dr. Barth describes the Kilgris as very fine, tall men, and  much lighter in complexion than the Kailouees: they dress very simply,  having only the black turkadee on their heads, having neither a bakin  zakee under it, nor any white shash, or fotah, to wind upon it, in the  fashion of the Kailouees. They are, like all these tribes, very proud,  and nourish a deadly enmity towards the Kailouees, of whom they take  precedence in Aghadez. Barth gave away a black-lead pencil in Aghadez,  and afterwards everybody came to ask him for one. A person got one  pencil, and begged another, saying, \"the two would last him his whole  life.\"    _11th._--The weather is increasingly cold in the morning; three-quarters  of an hour after sunrise the thermometer was 45 deg. in open air.    His highness vouchsafed this day to sleep in my tent, and yesterday he  did the Germans the honour of slaughtering lice in theirs. It is a grand  piece of etiquette in this country, that every man has the privilege of  murdering his own lice. If you pick a louse off a man's sleeve, you must  deliver it up instantly to him to be murdered, as his undoubted right  and privilege.    The Sultan of Aghadez has returned from his razzia against the people of  Seloufeeat, of Azgher, and the Kalfadai. Those whom he caught he  chastised: but most of the Fadeea fled. I register these varying  reports, because they show the state of uncertainty in which we were  always kept, now hearing one thing, now another. But the true state of  the case seems to be, that though the great Koku of Aghadez did take the  field for a razzia, the actual operations were conducted by the Sultan  of Asoudee. It must be remembered, however, that with their maharees  these desert-princes can march to and fro with surprising rapidity, and  that rumour finds it difficult to follow their footsteps. En-Noor now  thinks the country sufficiently tranquil to move on two days further. He  says he shall do so in the course of fifteen days.    _12th._--His highness paid me a visit as usual, and I gave him a box  containing a looking-glass, with a lid, on which is painted "]]]
