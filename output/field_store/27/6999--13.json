Therefore, on to the village of  Penetanguishene, which is twenty miles from Bruce's, or some say  twenty-four. We started from Bruce's at half-past three in the morning,  and reached \"The Village,\" as it is always called, at half-past twelve,  on the 30th of June, and the rain still continuing ever since we left  Toronto. Thus, with great expedition, it took the best portion of three  days for a transit of only 108 miles. This has been done in twenty-four  hours by another route, as I shall explain on my return.    Penetanguishene is a small village, which has not progressed in the same  ratio as the military road to it has done. It is peopled by French  Canadians, Indians, and half-breeds, and is very prettily situated at  the bottom of the harbour. Lieutenant-Colonel Phillpotts, of the Royal  Engineers, selected this site after the peace of 1815, when Drummond's  Island on Lake Huron was resigned to the Americans, for an asylum for  such of the Canadian French settled there as would not transfer their  allegiance. They migrated in a body.    This is the nearest point of Western Canada at which the traveller from  Europe can observe the unmixed Indian, the real wild man of the woods,  with medals hanging in his ears, as large as the bottom of a silver  saucepan, rings in his nose, the single tuft of hair on the scalp,  eagle's plumes, a row of human scalps about his neck, and the other  amiable etceteras of a painted and greased _sauvage_.    Here also you first see the half-breed, the offspring of the white and  red, who has all the bad qualities of both with very few of the good of  either, except in rare instances.          CHAPTER IV.      The French Canadian.      At Penetanguishene you see the original pioneer of the West, that  unmistakeable French Canadian, a good-natured, indolent man, who is  never active but in his canoe singing, or _a la chasse_, a true  _voyageur_, of which type of human society the marks are wearing out  fast, and the imprint will ere long be illegible. It makes me serious,  indeed, to contemplate the Canadian of the old dominant race, and I  shall enter a little into his history.    _Res ardua vetustis novitatem dare_; and never could an author impose  upon himself a greater task than that of endeavouring succinctly to  trace such a history, in this age of railroads and steam-vessels, or to  bring before the mind's eye events which have long slumbered in  oblivion, but which it behoves thinking minds not to lose sight of.    Man is now a locomotive animal, both as regards the faculties of mind  and of motion; unless in the schools, in the cabinet, or in amusing  fictions founded on fact, he rarely finds leisure to think about a  forgotten people.    Canada and Canadian affairs have, however, succeeded in interesting the  public of America and the public of Europe--the \"go-ahead\" English  reader in the New World--because Canada would be a very desirable  addition to the already overgrown Republic founded by the Pilgrim  Fathers and Europeans; because French interest looks with a somewhat  wistful eye to the race which at one time peopled and governed so large  a portion of the Columbian continent. Regrets, mingling with desires,  are powerful stimulants. An unconquerable and natural jealousy exists in  France that England should have succeeded in laying the foundations of  an empire, which bids fair to perpetuate the glories of the Anglo-Saxon  race in its Transatlantic dominion; whilst the true Briton, on the other  hand, regards Canada as the apple of his eye, and sees with pleasure and  with pride that his beloved country, forewarned by the grand error  committed at Boston, and so prophetically denounced by Chatham, has  obtained a fairer and more fertile field for British legitimate  ambition.    Tocqueville, a sensible and somewhat impartial writer, is the only  political foreign reasoner who has done justice to Canada; but it is  _par parenthese_ only; and even his powers of mind and of reasoning,  nurtured as they have been in republicanism, fail to convince fearless  hearts that democracy is a human necessity.    That the American nation will endeavour to put a wet blanket over the  nascent fires of Spanish ambition in the miserable new States of the  Northern Continent, and to absorb them in the stars of Columbia, there  can be no doubt. California, the most distant of the old American  settlements of Spain, has felt already the bald eagle's claw; Texas is  annexed; and unless European interests prevent it, which they must do,  Mexico, Guatemala, Yucatan, and all the petty priest-ridden republics of  the Isthmus, must follow, and that too very soon.    But what do the people of the United States, (for the government is not  a particeps, save by force,) pretend to effect by their enormous  sovereignty? The control probably of the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards  is the grand object, and, to effect this, Canada and Nova Scotia stand  in the way, and Canada and Nova Scotia are therefore marked down as  other Stars in the American galaxy.    The Russian empire is cited, as a case in point, for immense extension  being no obstacle to central coercion, or government, if the term be  more pleasing.    We forget that each individual State of the present Union repudiates  centralization, and acts independently. Little Maine wanted to go to  war with mighty England on its own bottom; and there was a rebellion in  Lesser Rhode Island, which puzzled all the diplomatists very  considerably. Now let us sketch a military picture, and bring out the  lights and shades boldly.    Suppose that the United States determines upon a war with Great Britain,  let us look to the consequences. Firstly, an immense re-action has taken  place in Canada, and a mass of growlers, who two years ago would perhaps  have been neutral, would readily take arms now in favour of British  institutions, simply because \"impartiality\" has been evinced in  governing them.    Next, the French Canadians have no idea of surrendering their homes,  their laws, their language, their altars, to the restless and  destructive people whose motto is \"Liberty!\" but whose mind is  \"Submission,\" without reservation of creed or colour.    Then, on the boundless West, innumerable Indians, disgusted by the  unceremonious manner in which the Big Knife has driven them out, are  ready, at the call of another Tecumseh, to hoist the red-cross flag.    In the South, the negro, already taught very carefully by the North a  lesson of emancipation, only waits the hour to commence a servile and  horrible war, worse than that exercised by the poor Cherokees and Creeks  in Florida, which, miserable as were the numbers, scanty the resources,  and indomitable the courage, defied the united means and skill of the  American armies to quell.    A person who ponders on these matters deplores the infatuation of the  mob, or of the western backwoodsmen, who advocate war to the knife with  England; for, should it unhappily occur and continue, war to the knife  it must be.    American orators have asserted that England, base as she is, dare not,  in this enlightened age, let loose the blacks. I fear that, self-defence  being the first law of Nature, rather than lose Canada, and rather than  not gain it, both England and the United States will have recourse to  every expedient likely to bring the matter to an issue, and will abide  by that Machiavelian axiom--the end sanctifies the means.    An abominable outcry was raised during the last war against the  employment of the savage Indians with our armies; but the loudest in  this vituperation forgot that the Americans did the same, as far as  their scanty control over the Red Man permitted, and that, where it  failed, the barbarous backwoodsman completed the tragedy.    Making razor-strops of Tecumsehs' skin was not a very Christian  employment, in retaliation for a scalp found wrapped up in paper in the  writing-desk of a clerk, when the public offices were sacked at Little  York. The poor man most likely thought it a very great curiosity; and I  dare say there are some in the British Museum, as well as preserved  heads of the South Sea islanders.    A war between England and the United States is a calamity affecting the  whole world, and, excepting for political interest, or that devouring  fire burning in the breasts of so many for change, I am persuaded that  the intelligence of the Union is opposed to it. America cannot sweep  England from the seas, or blot out its escutcheon from The Temple of  Fame. It is child's play even to dream of it. England is as vitally  essential to the prosperity of America as America is to the prosperity  of England; and, although American feelings are gaining ground in  England, by which I do not mean that the President of the United States  will ever govern our island, but independent notions and axioms similar  to those practised in the Union; yet the time has not, nor ever will,  arrive, that Britain will succumb to the United States, either from  policy or fear, any more than that her grandchildren, on this side of  the Atlantic, could pull down the Stars and Stripes, and run the meteor  flag up to the mast-head again.    The United States is a wonderful confederation, and Nature seems, in  creating that people, to have given them constitutions resembling the  summers of the northern portion of the New World, where she makes  things grow ten times as fast as elsewhere. A grain of wheat takes a  decent time to ripen in England, and requires the sweat of the brow and  the labour of the hands to bring it to perfection; but in North America  it becomes flour and food almost before it is in ear in the old country.  Nature marches quick in America, but is soon exhausted; so her people  there think and act ten times as fast as elsewhere, and die before they  are aged. The women are old at thirty, and boys of fifteen are men; and  so they ripe and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20023"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence (#14)"],[1,"on  the throne, but Dom Pedro, who had been expelled from Brazil by a  revolution, took active steps to recover the Portuguese throne for  his daughter, and equipped an expedition for that end with English and  French volunteers. In this way, Donna Maria, who had spent part of her  exile in England, and formed a friendship with the Princess Victoria,  was through British instrumentality placed on her throne, but still  could only maintain herself with difficulty against Miguel. She was a  few weeks older than the Princess Victoria, and had recently lost her  first husband, the Duc de Leuchtenberg. She was married by proxy on  the 1st of January 1836, and in person on the 9th of April, to Prince  Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg.    There was also a disputed succession in Spain, where by the ancient  law women might succeed to the throne. Ferdinand VII., who had revoked  the Pragmatic Sanction of 1711 and restored the former system, died in  1833, leaving no son. His elder daughter Isabella, then three years  of age, was proclaimed Queen (her mother Christina being appointed  Regent), and Isabella's claims were recognised by England and France.  The late King's brother, Don Carlos, taking his stand upon the Salic  Law as established by the Pragmatic Sanction, raised the standard of  revolt and allied himself with Dom Miguel, the young Queens Maria  and Isabella mutually recognising each other, and being supported by  France and England against the \"Holy Alliance\" of Austria, Russia, and  Prussia. A seven years' civil war resulted, which did not end  till, from sheer exhaustion, the Carlists had to cease fighting the  Christinos, as the loyal party was called. The English Government in  the previous year had sanctioned the enlistment of 10,000 men; who,  commanded by Colonel (afterwards Sir de Lacy) Evans, landed at San  Sebastian in August to assist the Christinos. A British auxiliary  contingent was already with the Spanish army, while a naval squadron  under Lord John Hay was active on the coast. Mendizabal was Prime  Minister at the beginning of the year 1836, and was succeeded in May  by Isturitz. Riots took place at Madrid, and Isturitz fled to France;  Calatrava succeeding him, assisted by Mendizabal. The Christino cause  did not much advance during the year.          CHAPTER V    1836      _The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._    _4th March 1836._    MY DEARLY BELOVED CHILD,--You wrote me again a long, _dear_, _good_  letter, like all those which I received from your kind hands. Time  approaches now for the arrival of the cousins, and most probably of  your Uncle Ferdinand also. He has informed me of his arrival for the  7th or 8th; notwithstanding this, I mean to leave everything settled  as it has been arranged. They will set off on the 7th, arrive at Paris  on the 8th, and leave it again on the 12th.... Fernando[1] has still a  very bad cold; change of air is likely to cure that. The stay here has  done Fernando a great deal of good, and it cannot be denied that he is  quite another person. It has given me some trouble, but I have written  down for him everything which he ought to know about the organisation  of a government _in general_, and what will be necessary in specie to  carry on successfully the Government in Portugal.... My inclinations,  as you are aware, would have led me to the East, but certainly the  only thing which reconciles me with my not having done so is that it  has made me to remain near you, and will enable me to see you and to  be useful to you.        [Footnote 1: The Queen's first cousin, Prince Ferdinand (son      of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg, who was brother of the      Duchess of Kent and the King of the Belgians), aged nineteen,      who married the Queen of Portugal on 9th April. He was at      this time visiting the King of the Belgians on his way to      Portugal.]          _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    KENSINGTON PALACE, _7th March 1836._    ... You are very kind, my dearest, best Uncle, to say that \"the only  thing which reconciles you\" for not having gone to Greece is, that you  are near me and can see me. Thank Heaven that you did not go there! it  would have been dreadful for me and for all your relations to be thus,  as it were, cut off from almost all intercourse! It is _hard_ enough,  that you are as far as you are, when I recollect the happy time when I  could see you, and be with you, _every_ day!...          _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    KENSINGTON PALACE, _29th March 1836._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,-- ... As concerning the \"fatigues\" we are said to  have undergone, they were none to me, and made me very happy; I only  wish they could have lasted longer, for all, all is over now, and our  _beloved_ Ferdinand[2] himself leaves our shores this _very_ morning.  We accompanied them all on Sunday, where we took a final leave of our  dear Ferdinand, and I cannot tell you how sorry I was, and am, to see  him go, for I love him dearly. He is so truly excellent, kind,  and good, and endears himself so much by his simplicity and  good-heartedness! I may venture to say, that no one has his prosperity  and happiness more at heart than I have. I am extremely sanguine about  his success. He goes there full of courage, spirits, and goodwill,  and being naturally clever and observant, I doubt not that with good  counsel, and prudence, he will do very well. _Your_ kind advice will  be of the greatest and most important use to him, the more so as he is  so exceedingly fond of you.... Ferdinand leaves behind him here a most  favourable impression on all parties, for _I_ have even _heard_ from  some great Tories themselves that there was a great feeling _for_ him  in this country.        [Footnote 2: See _ante_, p. 45. (Ch. V, Footnote 1).      He had latterly been visiting the Duchess of Kent.]          [Pageheading: THE PRINCES ERNEST AND ALBERT]      _The Princess Hohenlohe to the Princess Victoria._    STUTTGART, _16th April 1836._    ... You will like our two Coburg cousins also, I think; they are more  manly than I think the two others are, after the description. I am  very fond of them both. Ernest is my favourite, although Albert  is much handsomer, and cleverer too, but Ernest is so honest and  good-natured. I shall be very curious to hear your opinion upon  them....          _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    KENSINGTON PALACE, _26th April 1836._    MY DEAREST, BEST UNCLE,-- ... You will, I am sure, have been delighted  with M. de Neumann's[3] account of the complete success of our dear  Ferdinand. All has gone off better than even our most sanguine hopes  could have desired. He is much pleased with the good Queen, and she is  delighted with him, and M. de Neumann says that they are already quite  happy together. This is really a great blessing, but I fear that all  the _exterior_ affairs are not in quite _so_ good a state. I hope,  however, that the good people will not make any more difficulties  about Fernando's being Commander-in-Chief, as I hear from all accounts  it is necessary he should be so....    Uncle Ernest and my cousins will probably come here in the beginning  of next month, I hear, and will visit you on their return.    You ask me about Sully's Memoirs, and if I have finished them. I have  not finished them, but am reading them with great interest, and find  there is a great deal in them which applies to the present times, and  a great deal of good advice and reasoning in them. As you say, very  truly, it is extremely necessary for me to follow the \"events of the  day,\" and to do so impartially. I am always both grateful and happy  when you give me any advice, and hope you will continue to do so as  long as I live.    I am glad to hear you approve my singing, and I cannot tell you how  delightful it would be for me, if you could join with us. _A propos_,  dear Uncle, you did not answer what I said to you in a former letter  about your visiting us again. You know, dear Uncle, that this is a  subject upon which I am very _earnest_ and _very_ eager, and as the  summer approaches I grow more and more anxious about it. You know,  also, that _pleasure_ does more good than a hundred walks and rides.    Believe me always, my dearest Uncle, your truly devoted and attached  Niece,    VICTORIA.        [Footnote 3: Baron Neumann, who acted as Minister      Plenipotentiary during the absences of Prince Esterhazy,      succeeded him as Austrian Minister in 1842. He married Lady      Augusta Somerset in 1844.]          [Pageheading: THE PRINCE OF ORANGE]      _The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._    _13th May 1836._    MY DEAREST CHILD,--I got this time a very small letter from your good  little Ladyship, and I shall repay it probably in larger coin, as my  letter going through a messenger of my own will become longer, as it  will be more confidential than through the usual mode of conveyance.    I am really _astonished_ at the conduct of your old Uncle the King;  this invitation of the Prince of Orange and his sons, this forcing him  upon others, is very extraordinary.[4] It is so, because persons in  political stations and champions of great political passions cannot  put aside their known character as you would lay your hat upon a  table.    Not later than yesterday I got a half official communication from  England, insinuating that it would be _highly_ desirable that the  visit of _your_ relatives _should not take place, this year--qu'en  dites-vous_? The relations of the Queen and the King, therefore, to  the God-knows-what degree, are to come in shoals and rule the land,  when _your relations_ are to be _forbidden_ the country, and that  when, as you know, the whole of your relations have ever been very  dutiful and kind to the King. Really and truly I never heard or saw  anything like it, and I hope it will a _little rouse your spirit_;  now that slavery is"]]]
