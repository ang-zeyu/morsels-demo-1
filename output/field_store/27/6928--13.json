Several small birds, also, build their nests in the  bull's horn acacia, thus escaping from a predatory ant which is  capable of killing young birds. The trumpet tree, another plant of  South and Central America, is also protected by a standing army of  ants; and, like the above mentioned acacia, grows for its protectors  small food bodies containing oil, but instead of secreting nectar in  its leaves it harbors a small insect (coccus), whose sweet secretion  is much relished by the ants. Dr. Beccari mentions an epiphytal plant  growing on trees in Borneo, the seeds of which germinate, like those  of the mistletoe, on the branches of the tree; and the seedling stem,  crowned by the cotyledons, grows to about an inch in length, remaining  in that condition until a certain species of ant bites a hole in the  stem, which then produces a gall-like growth that ultimately  constitutes the home of the ants. If the plant is not fortunate enough  to be bitten by an ant it dies. These ants, then, protect their plant  home by rushing out fiercely on intruders, and thus are preserved the  sessile white flowers which, in this plant, are developed on the tuber  like body.           *       *       *       *       *      ADVANCE IN IRON.--At a meeting of the Philadelphia Iron Merchants'  Association, March 11, prices of all descriptions of merchant iron  were advanced fully 5 per cent.           *       *       *       *       *          THE ANEROID BAROMETER.      The aneroid barometer was invented by M. Vidi, of Paris. It consists  essentially of a circular box, the face of which is made of thin  elastic metal, rendered more elastic by being stamped and pressed into  concentric circular wave-like corrugations. This box is nearly  exhausted of air, and its elastic face supports the pressure of the  atmosphere, and yields to it with elastic resistance in proportion to  the amount of pressure. Thus, if the atmospheric pressure increases,  the face is pressed inward; if atmospheric pressure diminishes, the  elastic reaction of the metal moves the face outward. These movements  are communicated to an index by suitable and very delicate mechanism,  and registered in largely magnified dimensions, by the movements of  this index upon the face of the dial.    Aneroid barometers are now made of pocket size, compensated for  temperature, and with double scales, one reading the height of the  barometer column, the other the elevation obtained. I have, says Prof.  W. M. Williams, used one of these during many years, and find it a  very interesting traveling companion. It is sufficiently sensitive to  indicate the ascent from the ground floor to the upper rooms of a  three-storied house, or to enable the traveler sitting in a railway  train to tell, by watching its face, whether he is ascending or  descending an incline.    Such slight variations are more easily observed on the aneroid than on  the mercurial barometer, and therefore it is commonly stated that the  aneroid is the more sensitive instrument. This, however, is a  fallacious conclusion. It is not the superior sensitiveness of the  movements of the instrument, but the greater facility of reading them,  that gives this advantage to the aneroid, the index of which has a  needle point traveling nearly in contact with the foot of the  divisions; the readings are further aided by a needle point register  attached to a movable rim, which may be brought point to point against  the index, thus showing the slightest movement that human vision may  detect. A magnifying lens may be easily used in such a case.    It should be understood that the aneroid barometer is not an  independent instrument; it is merely a device for representing the  movements of the mercurial barometer. It is regulated by comparison  with the primary instrument, and this comparison should be renewed  from time to time, as the elastic properties of the metal may and do  vary.    An adjusting or regulating screw is attached to the back of the  instrument, and is usually movable by a watch key.    Besides this, the magnified reading of course magnifies any primary  error, and is largely dependent on the accuracy of the mechanism.           *       *       *       *       *          THE ALBO-CARBON LIGHT.      We need hardly remind our readers that numerous unsuccessful attempts  have been made at various times to enrich ordinary coal gas by the aid  of volatile oils. Upon the present occasion we have to place before  them particulars of a process having the same object in view, but  which is so far dissimilar in that it deals with a solid substance  instead of a liquid oil. The invention has been brought into its  present practical shape by Mr. James Livesey, C. E., of No. 9 Victoria  Chambers, Westminster, in conjunction with Mr. Kidd, with whom it  originated. The process consists in the employment of a substance  called albo-carbon, which is the solid residuum of creosote. This  material is moulded into the form of candles, which in large lamps are  placed in a metallic vessel or receiver near the gas burner. The  albo-carbon is warmed by the heat of the burning gas, the heat being  transmitted to the receiver by a metallic conductor. Upon the  albo-carbon being raised to the necessary temperature it volatilizes,  and as the coal gas passes over it to the burner its vapor becomes  mingled with the gas, and greatly raises its illuminating power. Of  course when first lighted the coal gas only is burned, but in a few  minutes the albo-carbon communicates its enriching vapor to it. The  only alteration necessary to the present gas fittings is the  vaporizing chamber, which is of simple construction, although at  present the details of the various arrangements necessary for the  different kinds of lights have not yet been fully worked out. This  invention is now being tried experimentally in the eastern section of  the Westminster Aquarium, where we recently examined it, and found it  to afford a marked improvement upon the ordinary system of gas  illumination, although a smaller number of burners is being used.  Tried alternately with ordinary coal gas, the higher illuminating  power of the albo-carbon light was very remarkable. It appears that  there are 200 burners fitted at the Aquarium with the new light, and  these successfully take the place of 500 ordinary gas burners  previously in use. The illuminating effect is stated to be doubled,  with an additional advantage as regards economy. The reduction of cost  arises from the smaller quantity of gas consumed with the albo-carbon  process than without it, and the very small cost of the enriching  material. According to our information, 1,000 cubic feet of ordinary  gas as generally used will, by the albo-carbon appliance, give as much  illumination as 3,000 cubic feet without it, and the cost of the  material to produce this result is only 1s. 6d. Experiments have been  made with this light by Mr. T. W. Keates, the consulting chemist to  the Metropolitan Board of Works, who reports very favorably upon it,  as does also Dr. Wallace, of Glasgow, who has obtained some very  satisfactory results with it. It is claimed for the albo-carbon  material that it is perfectly inexplosive, safe and portable, that it  causes no obstruction and leaves no residuum, and that the receivers  can be replenished almost indefinitely without any accumulation taking  place, so perfect is the evaporation of the albo-carbon. On the whole  the display at the Aquarium speaks greatly in favor of the new process  of gas enrichment, which, other things being equal, bids fair to find  its way into practice.--_Engineering._           *       *       *       *       *          ENGLISH AND AMERICAN HARDWARE.      Mr. Frederick Smith, Manager of the Union Land and Building Company  (limited), recently read a paper on the above subject before the  Manchester Scientific and Mechanical Society. Mr. H. Whiley,  Superintendent of the Manchester Health Department, presided. The  following is the text of the paper, as given in the London  _Ironmonger_. The lecturer said:    A spectator in any of our courts of justice will generally be struck  with the amount of hard swearing which is given to the court, under  the name of evidence. He will find one set of witnesses testifying,  under oath, to one thing, and another set, also under oath, to the  very opposite. Some prove too much, some too little, some are of a  totally negative character, proving nothing, and some are of no  character at all, and therefore are willing to prove anything. To some  extent the same phenomena are to be observed in reference to the  question of foreign competition. On the one hand the manufacturers  hold up to our affrighted vision the picture of our mills stopped, our  machine shops standing empty and idle, our hardware trade slipping  through our fingers, our ships rotting in our own and in foreign  ports, and our greatness as a producing nation for ever passed away.  On the other hand, the journalists who take the labor side of the  question, the trades-union leaders, and a large number of the workmen  themselves, hold that we have little or nothing to fear from our  foreign rivals; that the depression, like those atmospheric ones of  which our American cousins are constantly warning us, will pass away,  and leave us with better times to follow. I will, therefore, as far as  possible, keep out of the region of speculation, give you a few facts,  show you some examples, and leave you to draw your own inferences.  Some two or three years ago ordinary axle pulleys of English make were  difficult to get; the price was scandalously high, and the quality as  scandalously low. Out of a dozen probably four would not turn round  without sticking, and the casting was--well,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18880"],[0,"The New York Times Current History: the European War, February, 1915 (#14)"],[1,"y, public opinion was too strong for them. French people preferred  to sacrifice the main ideas on which their republican government is  based and made an alliance with Russia.    Religious, national, and political oppression in Russia against Pole,  Jew, and Finn, against workingman and intellectual, is propped up by the  help of liberal thinking France, whose conservatism threw a Western  glamour over Russian ill-deeds.    We have regretted more than words can say it that France has annihilated  herself as a power for the moral improvement of the universe by making  herself a tool of the Russian Juggernaut.    We read in the papers today that after a small frontier engagement in  Alsace-Lorraine the signs of mourning were taken off from the statues  representing Alsatian towns on Parisian squares.    We know in our innermost hearts that they will have to be attached for a  long time to come to those three emblems of human progress for which  France is supposed to stand, liberty, fraternity, equality, if our arms  are not successful.    We realize that the gallant spirit of the French people has furnished  the mainspring which has made this war possible.    We honor her for her courage. For we know well enough that it is she  alone among the partners who runs real risks. We know that she is not  moved by sordid motives. But as we know her unforgiving attitude, as we  knew that she was helping Russia and egging her on against us; that she  was instigating Britain and Belgium as well as Serb and Rumanian, we had  to take her attitude as what it was; as the firm policy of a patriotic  and passionate people, waiting for the moment when they could wipe out  the memory of 1870, putting nationality to the front, sacrificing their  own ideals of humanity.    Would France have given up this attitude if we had not stood by our  Austrian ally? Would she have broken her word to her Russian friend if  we had been a little more conciliatory?    I think we would commit a libel on French honor and on French patriotism  if we assumed that any step on our part could have prevented her from  trying to redress the state of affairs produced by the events of 1871.    [Illustration: decoration]          Fate of the Jews in Poland    By Georg Brandes.    [From The Day, Nov. 29, 1914.]         Georg Brandes, Denmark's critic and man of letters, has lived       in many European countries and spent the year 1886-87 in       Russian Poland. His books on \"Impressions of Poland\" and       \"Impressions of Russia\" show his interest in the political and       social conditions of the Russian Empire.      The war raging in and out of Europe does not give the experienced much  reason to hope. The immense mischief daily caused by it is certain  enough. The benefits which are believed to be the result of it and of  which the various nations dream differently are so uncertain that they  cannot possibly be reckoned upon. Before those whose sympathy was with  the deep national misfortune of the Polish people, there rose the image  of the reunion and emancipation of this tripartited people under  extensive autonomy, and most probably under the protection and supremacy  of a great power.    For the present we are far away from that goal. Poles are compelled by  necessity to fight in the Prussian, Austrian and Russian armies, against  each other. Not the smallest attempt at emancipation has been made  either in Prussian Posen or in the Russian \"Kingdom\" or in Austrian  Galicia. We might even say that the dismemberment at present is going  deeper than ever, as it is now cleaving the minds as well.    The only indication of a future union is the manifesto of the Grand Duke  Nikolai, the Russian Field Marshal, to the Poles, issued in the middle  of August. It began: \"Poles, the hour has struck in which the holy dream  of your fathers and grandfathers may be fulfilled. Let the borders  cutting asunder the Polish people be effaced; let them unite under the  sceptre of the Czar. Under this sceptre Poland will regenerate, free in  religion, language, and autonomy.\"    And it ended in the following way: \"The dawn of a new life is beginning  for you. In this dawn let the sign of the cross, the symbol of the  sufferings and the resurrection of the people, shine.\"    How clearly this manifesto, with its surprising love of liberty, its  pious reference to the cross, bore the stamp of having been enforced by  circumstances, and how accustomed one had become to disregard promises  from the Russian Government of full constitutional liberty and the like,  as those given before had not meant very much either in Finland or in  Russia itself. Still the manifesto, as a sign of the time, was well apt  to make an impression on the great masses who had always heard the  authorities stamp as criminal plots, as high treason, what was now  suddenly called from the supreme place \"the holy dream of the  forefathers.\"    The purpose of the proclamation was probably, above all, to prevent a  revolt in Russian Poland the moment hostile troops invaded it. On the  Austrian Poles the manifesto seems to have failed to produce its effect.  As these Poles enjoy full autonomy in Galicia, and for a century have  witnessed the severity and cruelty with which their kinsmen in Russian  Poland have been oppressed, they received the proclamation with loud  vows of faithfulness to the house of Hapsburg; nay, all the _sokol_  societies which in time of peace (keeping a decision in view) had  trained their members in games and the use of arms, placed themselves as  Polish legions at the disposal of the Government against the Russians.  But that was not all. The Ruthenian inhabitants of Galicia, one-half the  population of the country, founded _a League for the Release of Ukraine_  and flooded Europe from the 25th of August with notifications and  descriptions hostile to Russia. The founders did not withhold their  names. They are D. Donzow, W. Doroschenko, M. Melenewsky, A.  Skoropyss-Joltuchowsky, N. Zalizniak and A. Zuk.    And it has very soon proved that, in spite of the proclamation of the  independence of Poland, the Czar, at any rate, includes East Galicia in  Poland as little as the inhabitants are regarded or treated as Poles or  Ruthenians. The Russians were hardly in Lemberg, before this town and  the whole of East Galicia were called in the orders of the day old  Russian land and the inhabitants described as Russians, whom their  brothers had now come to set free.    What impression the imperial manifesto made in Posen can scarcely be  proved, as each hostile remark against Prussia would have been punished  as high treason.    The German Emperor has, however, no less than the Russian Czar, been  courting the favor of the Poles and trying to win them through promises.  One month after the issue of the Czar's manifesto, a proclamation from  von Morgen, the German Lieutenant General, was displayed in the  Governments of Lomza and Warsaw. In this the following sentences are to  be found: \"Arise and drive away with me those Russian barbarians who  made you slaves; drive them out of your beautiful country, which shall  now regain her political and religious liberty. That is the will of my  mighty and gracious King.\" Knowing the passion with which the Poles have  hitherto been driven away from their soil and persecuted because of  their language, we learn from this proclamation that the German  Government has felt the necessity of outbidding the Czar.    As far as may be seen, the Czar's manifesto made very little impression  on the intellectual in Russian Poland, who, of course, received it with  much suspicion. The masses in Russian, as in Austrian, Poland have for  some time stood passionately against each other, hurling accusations of  treason to the holy cause of their native country, until a new party has  now been formed which is politically most unripe, but for that very  reason has an enormous extension. Its password is this: \"We do not want  to hear of Russia or of Austria; we only want one thing: the Polish  State without guardianship from any side.\" In other words, we want the  quite impossible. Political oppression for almost one and one-half  centuries brings its own punishment to a people. In such a people  political skill too easily becomes local patriotism, or it remains in  the state of innocence.    Of what use is it to begin singing: _Polonia fara de se_? That Poland  cannot become free by itself is evident to anybody who has any political  idea.    Still I am inclined to say, never mind the forms which the Polish  independence and thirst of liberty are taking: they seem to pass like a  purifying storm through all Polish minds. Many times before this has a  glorious future risen before the Poles--1812, when Napoleon began the  second Polish campaign; 1830, when the Poles were buoyed up by the  sympathy of Europe; 1848 and 1863. But hardly has a change of  established conditions appeared so possible and painful barriers so near  the point of falling, as in this great and dreadful crisis.    He who for a generation has been busy with Polish and Russian affairs  can therefore, without much difficulty, imagine how many young Polish  hearts are now beating and burning with hope, expectation and the most  noble aspirations.    Nevertheless, the state of affairs in Russian Poland is at present more  desperate than it has ever been before, during war and revolt; and this  is not due to the pressure of the conditions or the horror of the  situation, but is due to the Poles themselves, to the overstimulation  of the national feeling which sends forth its breath of madness all over  Europe and now whirls round in Polish brains to drive out magnanimity  and humanity, not to speak of reason, which, on the whole, has no  jubilee in Europe in the year 1914.    I dare truthfully say that for no other people have I felt the  enthusiasm that I have felt for the Poles. I have revealed this "]]]
