I hope English  ladies will be much edified by the above instructions. The cries of  Paris at this period were constant and absolutely stunning; Guillaume de  la Villeneuve observes that the criers were braying in the streets of  Paris from morning to night. Amongst the vegetables, garlick was the  most prevalent, which was then eaten with almost every thing, people  being in the habit of rubbing their bread with it: the flour of peas and  beans made into a thick paste was sold all hot; onions, chervil,  turnips, aniseed, leeks, etc., a variety of pears and apples of sorts  that are now scarcely known, except Calville, services, medlers, hips  and other small fruits now no longer heard of; nuts, chesnuts of  Lombardy, Malta grapes, etc.; for beverage, wine at about a farthing a  quart; mustard vinegar, verjuice, and walnut oil; pastry, fresh and  salted meat, eggs and honey. Others went about offering their services  to mend your clothes, some to repair your tubs, or polish your pewter;  candles, cotton for lamps, foreign soup, and almost every article that  can be imagined was sold in the streets, sometimes the price demanded  was a bit of bread. The millers also went bawling about to know if you  had any corn to grind, and amongst those that demanded alms were the  scholars, the monks, the nuns, the prisoners and the blind.    It was the custom in those days, when a person wished to be revenged  upon another, to make an image of him in wax or mud, as much resembling  as possible. They then took it to a priest and had it named after the  person they wished to injure, with all the ceremonies of the church, and  anointed it, and lastly had certain invocations pronounced over the  unfortunate image. It was then supposed that the figure had some degree  of identity with the prototype, and any injury inflicted upon it would  be felt by the person they wished to harm; they therefore then set to  work to torture it according to their fancy, and at last would plunge a  sharp instrument into that part where the heart should be placed,  feeling quite satisfied they had wreaked their revenge on their enemy.  Sometimes persons were severely punished for the performance of this  farce, and when any individuals experienced some great misfortune, they  often imagined that it had arisen in consequence of their image having  been made by their enemy, and maltreated in the manner described.    When Charles V ascended the throne in 1364, he soon began to display his  taste for civilisation by collecting books to form a library in the  Louvre, and rewarding merit, however humble the station of the  individual by whom it was possessed; and although he received the reins  of government at a period when France was surrounded with enemies, and  her finances in a ruined state, such was the prudence of his measures  that he completely retrieved her losses, and well earned the appellation  he received of Charles the Wise; he built several churches, colleges,  and hotels, none of which if standing are now appropriated to the  purposes originally intended; he also had several bridges constructed,  and embellished Paris with many edifices that were both useful and  ornamental. But all his efforts were paralysed in the following reign of  Charles VI, justly called the Simple, partly mad, partly imbecile, and  coming to the throne at twelve years of age, every misfortune that might  have been expected from a country surrounded by foreign enemies without,  and torn by intestine broils within, happened in the fullest force. The  English and the Burgundians united together in besieging Paris, which  was ultimately entered by both their armies; what with riots amongst the  Parisians, the intrigues of the Queen Isabeau de Baviere, the  dissensions of the King's uncles, and the brigandage of the nobility who  overran the country, never was a nation reduced to a more pitiable  condition; yet some monuments were added to Paris even during this  turbulent reign, the Church of St. Gervais being entirely reconstructed  in 1420, and that of St. Germain l'Auxerrois so considerably repaired as  to be almost rebuilt in 1425, besides several colleges, hospitals and  bridges; companies of archers, cross-bow men and armourers were also  established. Theatrical representations were first performed in this  reign in the grand hall of the Hospital of the Trinity, _Rue  Saint-Denis_, corner of the _Rue Grenetat_. The theatrical company  styled themselves \"Masters, Governors and Brethren of the Passion and  Resurrection of our Lord.\" Under the reign of Charles VII, surnamed the  Victorious, France regained all she had lost, and was much indebted for  her success to the Maid of Orleans, and the gallant Dunois, who entered  Paris and defeated the English who retreated to the Bastille and  ultimately were allowed to retire to Rouen. But although more was  effected in this reign for the prosperity and glory of France, Paris  received no additions or embellishments: the King being wholly occupied  in vanquishing the enemies of his country; his son Lewis XI, who is  supposed to have conspired against the life of his father, ascended the  throne in 1461; notwithstanding his reign was disturbed by a series of  wars, he found time to occupy himself with useful institutions, and  founded that of the first society of printers in Paris; he also  established the School of Medicine, and the Post Office. Superstitious  and cruel, he first used iron cages as prisons, then instituted the  prayer styled the Angelus. Although he increased the power of France,  his tyranny, injustice, dissimulation, and avarice caused him to be  hated by his subjects. His successor Charles VIII was but thirteen when  called to the throne in 1483, inheriting the few virtues without the  many vices of his father, but showed much weakness in the administration  of his affairs; in the early part of his reign Anne his mother was the  person who principally governed as Regent, until he was of age, when he  passed the rest of his life in war, but was so beloved that two of his  servants died of grief for the loss of their master, who was surnamed  the Affable. He was succeeded by his cousin Lewis XII in 1498, who  obtained the title of Father of his People, certainly the most virtuous  monarch that ever swayed the sceptre of France; he observed that he  preferred seeing his courtiers laugh at his savings than to see his  people weep for his expenses. The Hotel de Cluny and _Le Pont_ (the  bridge) _Notre-Dame_ were constructed in his reign and are still  standing; being the most ancient bridge in Paris. He died much  regretted, in 1515, and all France felt deeply the loss of a monarch,  whose measures were such as must have ensured the happiness of his  people could he have been spared to have accomplished the good work he  had begun.    Francis I, his great nephew, succeeded him and was considered the _beau  ideal_ of chivalry; he had been conspicuous for his accomplishments  whilst Duke de Valois, although only twenty-one when he ascended the  throne, upon which he was no sooner installed than compelled to quit his  capital to oppose the enemies of France, leaving the management of the  state to his mother Louisa of Savoy, who was not destitute of talent,  but vain and intriguing, Francis, after performing prodigies of valour,  and killing many foes with his own hand at the battle of Pavia, was  taken prisoner and conveyed to Madrid. On returning to France he was  received with the utmost joy by his subjects; in this reign the  principles of protestantism were first promulgated and several persons  were burnt for subscribing to the tenets of Luther. Francis was occupied  constantly with war, from the commencement of his reign until the year  of his death. He had many virtues but they were sullied by infidelity to  his engagements, and his persecution of the protestants whom he  sacrificed as heretics. Notwithstanding that his time was so much  occupied by his enemies that a very short period of his reign was passed  at Paris, he found means to embellish that city; the Church of St-Merri  in the _Rue St-Martin_ was built by his orders, precisely as it now  stands, in the year 1520. The style is Sarrasenzic, much richness of  sculpture is displayed, particularly over and around the middle door,  well meriting the close attention of an amateur. At the same period were  many of the churches now standing extensively repaired and nearly  rebuilt, amongst which St. Eustache, St. Gervais, St.  Jacques-la-Boucherie, of which the tower only remains, St.  Germain-l'Auxerrois, etc., several colleges and hospitals were  instituted, fountains and hotels erected, but scarcely any of them are  now to be seen, or at any rate very few as constructed in their  original form. He was succeeded by his son Henry II in 1547, who like  his predecessors was constantly occupied with war, but gained one point,  that of taking the last place which the English retained in France,  being Calais, which surrendered to the Duke de Guise; after a reign of  thirteen years Henry was killed at a tournament held in the _Rue  St-Antoine_, by Montgomery, the captain of his guard. The cruelties of  which he was guilty towards the protestants entirely eclipse whatever  good qualities he possessed, which principally consisted in desperate  courage with extraordinary prowess; he was also zealous in his  friendships. According to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17763"],[0,"The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow (#14)"],[1," her  friends.\"    \"And is that all?\"    \"Almost, but not quite. The young girl had a bag too. It stood on a  table----\"    \"Well?\"    \"Empty. Everything had been tumbled out--turned upside down and the  contents scattered. I looked them carefully over. Nothing, positively  nothing, but what you would be likely to find in any young girl's  traveling-bag. There's but one conclusion to be drawn.\"    \"And what is that?\"    \"That all these things, such as they were, had been pushed hastily about  after being emptied out on the table. That was not the young girl's  work.\"    \"Madame Duclos'!\"    \"You've hit it. She was in search of some one thing she wanted, and she  took the quickest way of finding it. And----\"    \"Yes, Gryce?\"    \"She was in a desperate hurry, or she wouldn't have left the trunk open  or all those dainty things lying about. Frenchwomen are methodical and  very careful of their belongings. One other thing I noted. There was a  loose nail in the lock of the trunk. Sticking to this nail was a raveling  of brown wool. Here it is, sir. The woman--Madame Duclos--wore a dress of  brown serge. If my calculations are not wrong and we succeed in getting a  glimpse of that dress, we shall find a tear in the skirt--and what is  more, one very near the hem.\"    \"Made to-day?\"    \"Yes--another token of haste. She probably jerked at the skirt when  she found herself caught. She could not have been herself to have done  this--for which we may be glad.\"    \"You mean that by this thoughtless action she has left a clue in our  hands?\"    \"That and something more. That tear in her decent skirt will bother her.  She will either make an immediate attempt to mend it, or else do the  other obvious thing--buy a new one. In either case it gives us something  by which to trace her. I have put Sweetwater on that job. He never tires,  never wearies, never lets go. No report in yet from the terminals?\"    \"Not a word. But she will not get far. Sooner or later we shall find her  if she does not come forward herself after reading the evening papers.\"    \"She will never come forward.\"    \"I am not so sure. Something not a little peculiar happened at the  museum after you left. We had Reynolds up, and he made a most careful  examination of that bow for finger-prints. He did not find any. But  fortune favored us in another way almost as good.\"    \"Now you interest _me_.\"    \"We had brought the bow into the Curator's office, and it lay on the long  table in the middle of the room. I had been looking it over (this was  after Reynolds had gone, of course) and had already noted a certain  defect in it, when on chancing to look up, my eyes fell on a mirror  hanging in a closet the door of which stood wide open. A face was visible  in it--a very white face which altered under my scrutiny into a semblance  more natural. It was that of Correy--you remember Correy, one of the  assistants, and an honest fellow enough, but more troubled at this moment  than I had ever seen him. What could have happened?    \"Wheeling quickly about, I caught him just as he started to go. He had  openly declared that he did not know this bow; but it was evident that he  did, and I did not hesitate to say so. Taken unawares, he could not hide  his distress, which he proceeded to explain thus: He did remember the  bow, now that he had the opportunity of seeing it closer. He pointed to  the nick I had myself noticed and said that owing to this defect the bow  had been cast aside, and the last time he had handled it----Here he  caught his breath and stopped. Another memory had evidently returned to  embarrass him.\"    \"Did you succeed in getting him to acknowledge what it was?\"    \"Yes, after I had worked with him for some time. He didn't want to talk.  In a moment you will see why. Going back to the time he had seen it  before, he said that he had found it in the cellar in an old box, the  contents of which he had been pulling over in a search for something very  different. Amazed to find it there, he had taken it out, examined it  carefully, noted the nick I mentioned and tossed it back again into the  box. This he told, but reluctantly.    \"Why reluctantly, I was soon to find out. He was not alone in the cellar.  The shadow of some person at his back had fallen across the lid of the  box as he was closing it. He did not recognize the shadow and had not  given it at the time a second thought, but the remembrance of it came  back vividly when he saw the bow lying before him and realized the part  it had played in the morning's tragedy. Was it because he knew that only  a person actively connected with the museum would have access to that  part of the cellar? I asked. I did not expect an answer, and I did not  get it. We looked at each other for a moment, then I let him go.\"    A momentary silence, which the Inspector broke by saying:    \"Later I called the Curator in, and he also recognized the bow as  belonging to the museum. But he volunteered no explanations and in fact  had little to say on the subject. He was evidently too much startled by  the direct connection which had thus been made between the crime (or  accident, if you will) and the personnel of the museum.\"    \"That was natural. He should be the first to see that the bow which shot  the arrow must of necessity have been brought into the building by some  other door than those at which the doormen stood guard. I had a talk  with those men, and they both declared that no sticks or umbrellas or  anything of that nature ever went by them or would be allowed to go by  them, no matter how concealed or wrapped up. But to revert to the matter  in hand. So Correy made absolutely no attempt to explain how this weapon  had been carried from cellar to gallery without his knowledge?\"    \"No. He for one will have a sleepless night.\"    \"Not he alone. I must and will see a way through this maze. To-morrow may  bring luck. Ah, I forgot to say that I spent an hour of the three you  allowed me with the captain of the steamer which brought over these two  women. As might be expected, he had no information of any significance to  give me; nor could I obtain much from such members of the crew as I could  get hold of. One steward remembered the Englishman, chiefly because he  never showed himself unless the young lady was on deck. But he never saw  them speak.\"    \"Which bears out Travis' story to the last detail.\"    \"Exactly. I think we can depend upon _him_; otherwise we _should_ be at  sea.\"    \"Yet his story is a very strange one.\"    \"The whole affair is strange--the strangest I ever knew. But that isn't  against it. It's the commonplace case which baffles. We shall get the key  to the whole mystery yet.\"    \"I've no doubt. Is Mr. Travis to be detained?\"    \"Yes, as witness.\"    \"Does he object?\"    \"Not at all. Having spoken--told his whole story, as he says--he is  rather glad than otherwise to be relieved from the common curiosity of  strangers. He's a rare bird, Gryce. If he stops to think, he must see  that he stands in a more or less ticklish position. But he does not  betray by look or action any doubt of our entire belief in the truth of  all his statements. His only trouble seems to be that he has lost, by  these inhuman means, the girl upon whom he had set his heart. To-morrow  we will confront him with Mrs. Taylor. She should be able to say whether  he did or did not stand out in the open gallery at the moment Miss  Willetts fell.\"    But Mr. Gryce had no encouragement to give him on this head.    \"Mrs. Taylor is ill--very ill, as I take it. I stopped at her hotel to  inquire. I was anxious about her for more than one reason and the report  I got of her condition was far from favorable. She is suffering cruelly  from shock. How occasioned, whether by the peculiar and startling death  to which she was a witness or by the strangely coincident fancy to which  she herself attributes her deep emotion, will have to be decided by  further developments. Nothing which I was able to learn from doctor or  nurse settled this interesting question. Meanwhile, no one is allowed to  see her--or will be till she is on the direct road to recovery. Let us  hope that this may be soon, or the inquest may be delayed indefinitely.\"    \"I don't know as that is to be deplored. I imagine we shall find enough  to fill in our time.... Any communications made by her before she  collapsed? Did she send out or receive messages of any kind since her  return from the museum?\"    \"She received none; but it is impossible to say whether or not she sent  any out. There is a letter-chute very near her door. She may have dropped  a letter in that any time before a watch was put upon her. You are  thinking, of course, of the anxiety she expressed about her husband, and  whether she took any measures for ascertaining if her fears for him had  any foundation in fact?\"    \"I was, yes; but I presume this fancy had passed, or else she is too ill  to remember her own aberrations. Were you able to effect an understanding  with her nurse?\"    \"Yes; that's fixed. I had a short talk, too, with the proprietor of the  hotel. He thinks very highly of Mrs. Taylor. She has lived in the one  apartment for years, and he cannot say enough of her discreet and uniform  life. Though she made no secret of the fact that she does not live with  her husband, her conduct has always been such as to insure universal  respect. He did not even make mention of eccentricities. If she is crazy,  it is a late development. She seemed to have been all right up to this  morning. Whichever way you turn, you encounter mystery and a closed  door.\"    \"The papers may spring the lock of that door at any moment. Publication  does much in a case of this kind. To-morrow we may be in a much more  favorable position. Meantime, let us recount the facts it is our business  to clear up.\"    \"On what hypothesis?\"    \"On all hypotheses. We are not sure enough of our premises, as yet, to"]]]
