Third round of the Seventh Circle: of those who have  done violence to Art.--Geryon.--The Usurers.--Descent to the  Eighth Circle.    \"Behold the wild beast with the pointed tail, that passes  mountains, and breaks walls and weapons; behold him that infects  all the world.\"[1] Thus began my Leader to speak to me; and he  beckoned to him that he should come to shore near the end of the  trodden marbles.[2] And that loathsome image of fraud came  onward, and landed his head and his body, but drew not his tail  upon the bank. His face was the face of a just man (so benignant  was its skin outwardly), and of a serpent all the trunk beside;  he had two paws, hairy to the armpits; his back and breast and  both his sides were painted with nooses and circles. With more  colors of woof and warp Tartars or Turks never made cloth, nor  were such webs woven by Arachne.    [1] Dante makes Geryon the type and image of Fraud, thus  allegorizing the triple form (forma tricorperis umbrae: Aeneid  vi. 289; tergemini Geryonae; Id. viii. 292) ascribed to him by  the ancient poets.    [2] The stony margin of Phlegethon, on which Virgil and Dante  have crossed the sand.      As sometimes boats lie on the shore, so that they are partly in  water and partly on the ground, and as yonder, among the  gluttonous Germans, the beaver settles himself to make his  war,[1] so lay that worst of beasts upon the rim that closes in  the sand with stone. In the void all his tail was quivering,  twisting upwards its venomous fork, which like a scorpion's armed  the point.    [1] With his tail in the water to catch his prey, as was  popularly believed.      The Leader said: \"Now needs must our way bend a little toward  that wicked beast that is couching there.\" Therefore we descended  on the right hand and took ten steps upon the verge quite to  avoid the sand and flame. And when we had come to it, I see, a  little farther on, people sitting upon the sand near to the void  place.[1]    [1] These people are the third class of sinners punished in this  round of the Seventh Circle, those who have done violence to Art,  the usurers. (See Canto xi.)      Here the Master said to me: \"In order that thou mayst bear away  complete experience of this round, now go and see their  condition. Let thy discourse there be brief. Till thou returnest  I will speak with this one, that he may concede to us his strong  shoulders.\"    Thus, still up by the extreme head of that seventh circle, all  alone, I went where the sad people were sitting. Through the eyes  their woe was bursting forth. This way and that they helped with  their hands, sometimes against the vapors,[1] and sometimes  against the hot soil. Not otherwise do the dogs in summer, now  with muzzle, now with paw, when they are bitten either by fleas,  or flies, or gadflies. When I set my eyes on the face of some on  whom the woeful fire falls, not one of them I recognized;[2] but  I perceived that from the neck of each was hanging a pouch, that  had a certain color and a certain device,[3] and thereupon it  seems their eyes feed. And as I looking come among them, I saw  upon a yellow purse azure that had the face and bearing of a  lion.[4] Then as the current of my look proceeded I saw another,  red as blood, display a goose whiter than butter. And one, who  had his little white bag marked with an azure and pregnant  sow,[5] said to me, \"What art thou doing in this ditch? Now get  thee gone, and since thou art still alive, know that my neighbor,  Vitaliano, will sit here at my left side. With these Florentines  am I, a Paduan; often they stun my ears shouting, \"Let the  sovereign cavalier come who will bring the pouch with the three  goats.\"[1] Then he twisted his mouth, and stuck out his tongue,  like an ox that licks his nose.    [1] The falling flames.    [2] Dante thus indicates that they were not worthy to be known.    [3] The blazon of their arms, by which Dante learns who they are.    [4] This was the device of the Gianfigliazzi, a Guelph family of  Florence; the next was that of the Ubriachi, Ghibellines, also of  Florence.    [5] Arms of the Scrovigni of Padua.    [6] One Giovanni Buiamonte of Florence, \"who surpassed all others  of the time in usury,\" says Benvenuto da Imola.      And I, fearing lest longer stay might vex him who had admonished  me to stay but little, turned back from these weary souls. I  found my Leader, who had already mounted upon the croup of the  fierce animal, and he said to me, \"Now be strong and courageous;  henceforth the descent is by such stairs; [1] mount thou in  front, for I wish to be between, so that the tail cannot do thee  harm.\"    [1] Not by foot, nor by boat as heretofore, but carried by living  ministers of Hell.      As is he who hath the shivering fit of the quartan so near that  his nails are already pallid, and he is all of a tremble only  looking at the shade, such I became at these words uttered. But  his reproaches wrought shame in me, which in presence of a good  lord makes a servant strong.    I seated myself on those huge shoulders. I wished to speak thus,  \"Take heed that thou embrace me,\" but the voice came not as I had  thought. But he who other time had succored me, in other peril,  soon as I mounted, clasped and sustained me with his arms: and he  said, \"Geryon, move on now; let the circles be wide, and the  descending slow; consider the strange burden that thou hast.\"    As a little vessel goeth from its place, backward, backward, so  he thence withdrew; and when he felt himself quite at play, he  turned his tail to where his breast had been, and moved it,  stretched out like an eel, and with his paws gathered the air to  himself. Greater fear I do not think there was when Phaethon  abandoned the reins, whereby heaven, as is still apparent, was  scorched; nor when the wretched Icarus felt his flanks  unfeathering through the melting of the wax, his father shouting  to him, \"Ill way thou holdest,\" than mine was, when I saw that I  was in the air on every side, and saw every sight vanished,  except that of the beast. He goes along swimming very slowly,  wheels and descends, but I perceive it not, save by the wind upon  my face, and from below.    I heard now on the right hand the gorge making beneath us a  horrible roar; wherefore I stretch out my head, with my eyes  downward. Then I became more afraid to lean over, because I saw  fires and heard laments; whereat I, trembling, wholly cowered  back. And I saw then, what I had not seen before, the descending  and the wheeling, by the great evils that were drawing near on  diverse sides.    As the falcon which has been long on wing, that, without sight of  lure or bird, makes the falconer say, \"Ah me, thou stoopest!\"  descends weary, there whence he had set forth swiftly, through a  hundred circles, and lights far from his master, disdainful and  sullen; so Geryon set us at the bottom, at the very foot of the  scarped rock, and, disburdened of our persons, darted away as  arrow from the bowstring.        CANTO XVIII. Eighth Circle: the first pit: panders and seducers.--  Venedico Caccianimico.--Jason.--Second pit: false flatterers.--  Alessio Interminei.--Thais.    There is a place in Hell called Malebolge, all of stone of the  color of iron, as is the encircling wall that surrounds it. Right  in the middle of this field malign yawns an abyss exceeding wide  and deep, the structure of which I will tell of in its place.  That belt, therefore, which remains between the abyss and the  foot of the high bank is circular, and it has its ground divided  into ten valleys. Such an aspect as where, for guard of the  walls, many moats encircle castles, the place where they are  presents, such image did these make here. And as in such  strongholds from their thresholds to the outer bank are little  bridges, so from the base of the precipitous wall started crags  which traversed the dykes and the moats far as the abyss that  collects and cuts them off.    In this place, shaken off from the back of Geryon, we found  ourselves; and the Poet held to the left, and I moved on behind.  On the right hand I saw new sorrow, new torments, and new  scourgers, with which the first pit [1] was replete. At its  bottom were the sinners naked. This side the middle they came  facing us; on the farther side with us, but with swifter pace. As  the Romans, because of the great host in the year of Jubilee,[2]  have taken means upon the bridge for the passage of the people,  who on one side all have their front toward the Castle,[3] and go  to Saint Peter's, and on the other toward the Mount.[4]    [1] Bolgia, literally, budget, purse, sack, here used for  circular valley, or pit.    [2] The year 1299-1300, from Christmas to Easter.    [3] Of Sant' Angelo.    [4] The Capitoline.      Along the gloomy rock, on this side and on that, I saw horned  demons with great scourges, who were beating them cruelly from  behind. Ah! how they made them lift their heels at the first  blows; truly not one waited for the second, or the third.    While I was going on, my eyes encountered one, and I said  straightway, \"Ere now for sight of him I have not fasted;\"  wherefore to shape him out I stayed my feet, and the sweet Leader  stopped with ire, and assented to my going somewhat back. And  that scourged one thought to conceal himself by lowering his  face, but little it availed him, for I said: \"O thou that castest  thine eye upon "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19950"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part III (Tertia Pars) (#14)"],[1," they are one man on account of the one human  nature. Nor would \"one\" imply unity of person, but unity in human  nature; for it could not be argued that because the three Persons  were one man they were one simply. For nothing hinders our saying  that men, who are many simply, are in some respect one, e.g. one  people, and as Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 3): \"The Spirit of God  and the spirit of man are by nature different, but by inherence one  spirit results,\" according to 1 Cor. 6:17: \"He who is joined to the  Lord is one spirit.\"    Reply Obj. 2: In this supposition the human nature would be assumed  to the unity, not indeed of one Person, but to the unity of each  Person, so that even as the Divine Nature has a natural unity with  each Person, so also the human nature would have a unity with each  Person by assumption.    Reply Obj. 3: In the mystery of the Incarnation, there results a  communication of the properties belonging to the nature, because  whatever belongs to the nature can be predicated of the Person  subsisting in that nature, no matter to which of the natures it may  apply. Hence in this hypothesis, of the Person of the Father may be  predicated what belongs to the human nature and what belongs to the  Divine; and likewise of the Person of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.  But what belongs to the Person of the Father by reason of His own  Person could not be attributed to the Person of the Son or Holy Ghost  on account of the distinction of Persons which would still remain.  Therefore it might be said that as the Father was unbegotten, so the  man was unbegotten, inasmuch as \"man\" stood for the Person of the  Father. But if one were to go on to say, \"The man is unbegotten; the  Son is man; therefore the Son is unbegotten,\" it would be the fallacy  of figure of speech or of accident; even as we now say God is  unbegotten, because the Father is unbegotten, yet we cannot conclude  that the Son is unbegotten, although He is God.  _______________________    SEVENTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 3, Art. 7]    Whether One Divine Person Can Assume Two Human Natures?    Objection 1: It would seem that one Divine Person cannot assume two  human natures. For the nature assumed in the mystery of the  Incarnation has no other suppositum than the suppositum of the Divine  Person, as is plain from what has been stated above (Q. 2, AA. 3, 6).  Therefore, if we suppose one Person to assume two human natures,  there would be one suppositum of two natures of the same species;  which would seem to imply a contradiction, for the nature of one  species is only multiplied by distinct supposita.    Obj. 2: Further, in this hypothesis it could not be said that the  Divine Person incarnate was one man, seeing that He would not have  one human nature; neither could it be said that there were several,  for several men have distinct supposita, whereas in this case there  would be only one suppositum. Therefore the aforesaid hypothesis is  impossible.    Obj. 3: Further, in the mystery of the Incarnation the whole Divine  Nature is united to the whole nature assumed, i.e. to every part of  it, for Christ is \"perfect God and perfect man, complete God and  complete man,\" as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 7). But two  human natures cannot be wholly united together, inasmuch as the soul  of one would be united to the body of the other; and, again, two  bodies would be together, which would give rise to confusion of  natures. Therefore it is not possibly for one Divine Person to assume  two human natures.    _On the contrary,_ Whatever the Father can do, that also can the Son  do. But after the Incarnation the Father can still assume a human  nature distinct from that which the Son has assumed; for in nothing  is the power of the Father or the Son lessened by the Incarnation of  the Son. Therefore it seems that after the Incarnation the Son can  assume another human nature distinct from the one He has assumed.    _I answer that,_ What has power for one thing, and no more, has a  power limited to one. Now the power of a Divine Person is infinite,  nor can it be limited by any created thing. Hence it may not be said  that a Divine Person so assumed one human nature as to be unable to  assume another. For it would seem to follow from this that the  Personality of the Divine Nature was so comprehended by one human  nature as to be unable to assume another to its Personality; and this  is impossible, for the Uncreated cannot be comprehended by any  creature. Hence it is plain that, whether we consider the Divine  Person in regard to His power, which is the principle of the union,  or in regard to His Personality, which is the term of the union, it  has to be said that the Divine Person, over and beyond the human  nature which He has assumed, can assume another distinct human nature.    Reply Obj. 1: A created nature is completed in its essentials by its  form, which is multiplied according to the division of matter. And  hence, if the composition of matter and form constitutes a new  suppositum, the consequence is that the nature is multiplied by the  multiplication of supposita. But in the mystery of the Incarnation  the union of form and matter, i.e. of soul and body, does not  constitute a new suppositum, as was said above (A. 6). Hence there  can be a numerical multitude on the part of the nature, on account of  the division of matter, without distinction of supposita.    Reply Obj. 2: It might seem possible to reply that in such a  hypothesis it would follow that there were two men by reason of the  two natures, just as, on the contrary, the three Persons would be  called one man, on account of the one nature assumed, as was said  above (A. 6, ad 1). But this does not seem to be true; because we  must use words according to the purpose of their signification, which  is in relation to our surroundings. Consequently, in order to judge  of a word's signification or co-signification, we must consider the  things which are around us, in which a word derived from some form is  never used in the plural unless there are several supposita. For a  man who has on two garments is not said to be \"two persons clothed,\"  but \"one clothed with two garments\"; and whoever has two qualities is  designated in the singular as \"such by reason of the two qualities.\"  Now the assumed nature is, as it were, a garment, although this  similitude does not fit at all points, as has been said above (Q. 2,  A. 6, ad 1). And hence, if the Divine Person were to assume two human  natures, He would be called, on account of the unity of suppositum,  one man having two human natures. Now many men are said to be one  people, inasmuch as they have some one thing in common, and not on  account of the unity of suppositum. So likewise, if two Divine  Persons were to assume one singular human nature, they would be said  to be one man, as stated (A. 6, ad 1), not from the unity of  suppositum, but because they have some one thing in common.    Reply Obj. 3: The Divine and human natures do not bear the same  relation to the one Divine Person, but the Divine Nature is related  first of all thereto, inasmuch as It is one with It from eternity;  and afterwards the human nature is related to the Divine Person,  inasmuch as it is assumed by the Divine Person in time, not indeed  that the nature is the Person, but that the Person of God subsists in  human nature. For the Son of God is His Godhead, but is not His  manhood. And hence, in order that the human nature may be assumed by  the Divine Person, the Divine Nature must be united by a personal  union with the whole nature assumed, i.e. in all its parts. Now in  the two natures assumed there would be a uniform relation to the  Divine Person, nor would one assume the other. Hence it would not be  necessary for one of them to be altogether united to the other, i.e.  all the parts of one with all the parts of the other.  _______________________    EIGHTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 3, Art. 8]    Whether it was more fitting that the Person of the Son rather than  any other Divine Person should assume human nature?    Objection 1: It would seem that it was not more fitting that the Son  of God should become incarnate than the Father or the Holy Ghost. For  by the mystery of the Incarnation men are led to the true knowledge  of God, according to John 18:37: \"For this was I born, and for this  came I into the world, to give testimony to the truth.\" But by the  Person of the Son of God becoming incarnate many have been kept back  from the true knowledge of God, since they referred to the very  Person of the Son what was said of the Son in His human nature, as  Arius, who held an inequality of Persons, according to what is said  (John 14:28): \"The Father is greater than I.\" Now this error would  not have arisen if the Person of the Father had become incarnate, for  no one would have taken the Father to be less than the Son. Hence it  seems fitting that the Person of the Father, rather than the Person  of the Son, should have become incarnate.    Obj. 2: Further, the effect of the Incarnation would seem to be, as  it were, a second creation of human nature, according to Gal. 6:15:  \"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor  uncircumcision, but a new creature.\" But the power of creation is  appropriated to the Father. Therefore it would have been more  becoming to the Father than to the Son to become incarnate.    Obj. 3: Further, the Incarnation is ordained to the remission of  sins, according to Matt. 1:21: \"Thou shalt call His name Jesus. For  He shall save His people from their sins.\" Now the remission of sins  is attributed to the Holy Ghost according to John 20:22, 23: \"Receive  ye the Holy Ghost. Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven  them.\" Therefore it became the Person of the Holy Ghost rather than  the Person of the Son to become incarnate.    _On the contrary,_ Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 1): \"In the  "]]]
