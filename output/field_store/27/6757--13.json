Old Kaspar took it from the boy,       Who stood expectant by;     And then the old man shook his head,       And, with a natural sigh,     \" 'T is some poor fellow's skull,\" said he,     \"Who fell in the great victory.    4. \"I find them in the garden,       For there's many hereabout;     And often when I go to plow,       The plowshare turns them out;     For many thousand men,\" said he,     \"Were slain in that great victory.\"    5. \"Now tell us what 't was all about,\"       Young Peterkin he cries;     While little Wilhelmine looks up       With wonder-waiting eyes;     \"Now tell us all about the war,     And what they killed each other for.\"    6. \"It was the English,\" Kaspar cried,       \"Who put the French to rout,     But what they killed each other for,       I could not well make out;     But everybody said,\" quoth he,     \"That 't was a famous victory:    7, \"My father lived at Blenheim then,       Yon little stream, hard by;     They burnt his dwelling to the ground,       And he was forced to fly;     So, with his wife and child he fled,     Nor had he where to rest his head.    8. \"With fire and sword, the country round       Was wasted, far and wide;     And many a nursing mother then,       And newborn baby died;     But things like that, you know, must be     At every famous victory.    9. \"They say it was a shocking sight       After the field was won;     For many thousand bodies here       Lay rotting in the sun:     But things like that, you know, must be     After a famous victory.    10. \"Great praise the Duke of Marlboro' won,        And our young prince, Eugene.\"      \"Why, 't was a very wicked thing!\"        Said little Wilhelmine.      \"Nay, nay, my little girl!\" quoth he,      \"It was a famous victory.    11. \"And everybody praised the Duke        Who this great fight did win.\"      \"But what good came of it at last?\"        Quoth little Peterkin.      \"Why, that I can not tell,\" said he,      \"But 't was a glorious victory.\"    NOTES.--The Battle of Blenheim, in the \"War of the Spanish Succession,\"  was fought August 13, 1704, near Blenheim, in Bavaria, between the French  and Bavarians, on one Ride, and an allied army under the great English  general, the Duke of Marlborough, and Eugene, Prince of Savoy, on the  other. The latter won a decisive victory: 10,000 of the defeated army were  killed and wounded, and 13,000 were taken prisoners.        XXI. \"I PITY THEM.\"    1. A poor man once undertook to emigrate from Castine, Me., to Illinois.  When he was attempting to cross a river in New York, his horse broke  through the rotten timbers of the bridge, and was drowned. He had but this  one animal to convey all his property and his family to his new home.    2. His wife and children were almost miraculously saved from sharing the  fate of the horse; but the loss of this poor animal was enough. By its aid  the family, it may be said, had lived and moved; now they were left  helpless in a land of strangers, without the ability to go on or return,  without money or a single friend to whom to appeal. The case was a hard  one.    3. There were a great many who \"passed by on the other side.\" Some even  laughed at the predicament in which the man was placed; but by degrees a  group of people began to collect, all of whom pitied him.    4. Some pitied him a great deal, and some did not pity him very much,  because, they said, he might have known better than to try to cross an  unsafe bridge, and should have made his horse swim the river. Pity,  however, seemed rather to predominate. Some pitied the man, and some the  horse; all pitied the poor, sick mother and her six helpless children.    5. Among this pitying party was a rough son of the West, who knew what it  was to migrate some hundreds of miles over new roads to locate a destitute  family on a prairie. Seeing the man's forlorn situation, and looking  around on the bystanders, he said, \"All of you seem to pity these poor  people very much, but I would beg leave to ask each of you how much.\"    6. \"There, stranger,\" continued he, holding up a ten dollar bill, \"there  is the amount of my pity; and if others will do as I do, you may soon get  another pony. God bless you.\" It is needless to state the effect that this  active charity produced. In a short time the happy emigrant arrived at his  destination, and he is now a thriving farmer, and a neighbor to him who  was his \"friend in need, and a friend indeed.\"      DEFINITIONS.--1. Em'i-grate, to remove from one country or state to  another for the purpose of residence, to migrate. 2. Mi-rac'u-lous-ly, as  if by miracle, wonderfully. A-bil'i-ty, power, capability. 3.  Pre-dic'a-ment, condition, plight. 4. Pre-dom'i-nate, to prevail, to rule.  5. Lo'cate, to place. Des'ti-tute, needy, poor. 6. Des-ti-na'tion, end of  a journey. Thriv'ing, prosperous through industry, economy, and good  management.        XXII. AN ELEGY ON MADAM BLAIZE.    Oliver Goldsmith (b. 1728, d. 1774) was born at Pallas, or Pallasmore, in  the parish of Forney, Ireland. He received his education at several  schools, at Trinity College, Dublin, at Edinburgh, and at Leyden. He spent  some time in wandering over continental Europe, often in poverty and want.  In 1756 he became a resident of London, where he made the acquaintance of  several celebrated men, among whom were Dr. Johnson and Sir Joshua  Reynolds. His writings are noted for their purity, grace, and fluency. His  fame as a poet is secured by \"The Traveler,\" and \"The Deserted Village;\"  as a dramatist, by \"She Stoops to Conquer;\" and as a novelist, by \"The  Vicar of Wakefield.\" His reckless extravagance always kept him in  financial difficulty, and he died heavily in debt. His monument is in  Westminster Abbey.    1. Good people all, with one accord,       Lament for Madam Blaize,     Who never wanted a good word--       From those who spoke her praise.    2. The needy seldom passed her door,       And always found her kind;     She freely lent to all the poor--       Who left a pledge behind.    3. She strove the neighborhood to please,       With manner wondrous winning:     She never followed wicked ways--       Unless when she was sinning.    4. At church, in silks and satin new,       With hoop of monstrous size,     She never slumbered in her pew--       But when she shut her eyes.    5. Her love was sought, I do aver,       By twenty beaux and more;     The king himself has followed her       When she has walked before.    6. But now, her wealth and finery fled,       Her hangers-on cut short all,     Her doctors found, when she was dead--       Her last disorder mortal.    7. Let us lament, in sorrow sore;       For Kent Street well may say,     That, had she lived a twelvemonth more--       She had not died to-day.      DEFINITIONS.--1. Ac-cord', agreement of opinion, consent. 2. Pledge,  personal property delivered to another as a security for a debt. 6.  Hang'ers-on, followers. Mor'tal, destructive to life.      XXIII. KING CHARLES II AND WILLIAM PENN.    King Charles. Well, friend William! I have sold you a noble province in  North America; but still, I suppose you have no thoughts of going thither  yourself?    Penn. Yes, I have, I assure thee, friend Charles; and I am just come to  bid thee farewell.    K.C. What! venture yourself among the savages of North America! Why, man,  what security have you that you will not be in their war kettle in two  hours after setting foot on their shores?    P. The best security in the world.    K.C. I doubt that, friend William; I have no idea of any security against  those cannibals but in a regiment of good soldiers, with their muskets and  bayonets. And mind, I tell you beforehand, that, with all my good will for  you and your family, to whom I am under obligations, I will not send a  single soldier with you.    P. I want none of thy soldiers, Charles: I depend on something better than  thy soldiers.    K.C. Ah! what may that be?    P. Why, I depend upon themselves; on the working of their own hearts; on  their notions of justice; on their moral sense.    K.C. A fine thing, this same moral sense, no doubt; but I fear you will  not find much of it among the Indians of North America.    P. And why not among them as well as others?    K.C. Because if they had possessed any, they would not have treated my  subjects so barbarously as they have done.    P. That is no proof of the contrary, friend Charles. Thy subjects  were the aggressors. When thy subjects first went to North  America, they found these poor people the fondest and kindest  creatures in the world. Every day they would watch for them to  come ashore, and hasten to meet them, and feast them on the best  fish, and venison, and corn, which were all they had. In return for  this hospitality of the savages, as we call them, thy subjects,  termed Christians, seized on their country and rich hunting  grounds for farms for themselves. Now, is it to be wondered at,  that these much-injured people should have been driven to  desperation by such injustice; and that, burning with revenge, they  should have committed some excesses?    K C. Well, then, I hope you will not complain when they come to treat you  in the same manner.    P. I am not afraid of it.    K.C. Ah! how will you avoid it? You mean to get their hunting grounds,  too, I suppose?    P. Yes, but not by driving these poor people away from them.    K.C. No, indeed? How then will you get their lands?    P. I mean to buy their lands of them.    K.C. Buy their lands of them? Why, man, you have already bought them of  me!    P. Yes, I know I have, and at a dear rate, too; but I did it only to get  thy good will, not that I thought thou hadst any right to their lands.    K.C. How, man? no right to their lands?    P. No, friend Charles, no right; no right at all: what right hast thou to  their lands?    K.C. Why, the right of discovery, to be sure; the right which the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15043"],[0,"The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke, Vol. 01 (of 12) (#14)"],[1,"visions of religion, and vindicate ourselves into  perfect liberty.    You are, my lord, but just entering into the world; I am going out of  it. I have played long enough to be heartily tired of the drama. Whether  I have acted my part in it well or ill, posterity will judge with more  candor than I, or than the present age, with our present passions, can  possibly pretend to. For my part, I quit it without a sigh, and submit  to the sovereign order without murmuring. The nearer we approach to the  goal of life, the better we begin to understand the true value of our  existence, and the real weight of our opinions. We set out much in love  with both; but we leave much behind us as we advance. We first throw  away the tales along with the rattles of our nurses: those of the priest  keep their hold a little longer; those of our governors the longest of  all. But the passions which prop these opinions are withdrawn one after  another; and the cool light of reason, at the setting of our life, shows  us what a false splendor played upon these objects during our more  sanguine seasons. Happy, my lord, if instructed by my experience, and  even by my errors, you come early to make such an estimate of things, as  may give freedom and ease to your life. I am happy that such an estimate  promises me comfort at my death.      FOOTNOTES:    [8] Had his lordship lived to our days, to have seen the noble relief  given by this nation to the distressed Portuguese, he had perhaps owned  this part of his argument a little weakened; but we do not think  ourselves entitled to alter his lordship's words, but that we are bound  to follow him exactly.

A    PHILOSOPHICAL INQUIRY    INTO THE ORIGIN OF OUR IDEAS OF    THE SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL    WITH    AN INTRODUCTORY DISCOURSE    CONCERNING    TASTE,    AND SEVERAL OTHER ADDITIONS    *** _The first edition of this work was published in 1756;       the second with large additions, in the year 1757._          PREFACE.      I have endeavored to make this edition something more full and  satisfactory than the first. I have sought with the utmost care, and  read with equal attention, everything which has appeared in public  against my opinions; I have taken advantage of the candid liberty of my  friends; and if by these means I have been better enabled to discover  the imperfections of the work, the indulgence it has received, imperfect  as it was, furnished me with a new motive to spare no reasonable pains  for its improvement. Though I have not found sufficient reason, or what  appeared to me sufficient, for making any material change in my theory,  I have found it necessary in many places to explain, illustrate, and  enforce it. I have prefixed an introductory discourse concerning Taste;  it is a matter curious in itself; and it leads naturally enough to the  principal inquiry. This, with the other explanations, has made the work  considerably larger; and by increasing its bulk has, I am afraid, added  to its faults; so that notwithstanding all my attention, it may stand in  need of a yet greater share of indulgence than it required at its first  appearance.    They who are accustomed to studies of this nature will expect, and they  will allow too for many faults. They know that many of the objects of  our inquiry are in themselves obscure and intricate; and that many  others have been rendered so by affected refinements, or false learning;  they know that there are many impediments in the subject, in the  prejudices of others, and even in our own, that render it a matter of no  small difficulty to show in a clear light the genuine face of nature.  They know that whilst the mind is intent on the general scheme of  things, some particular parts must be neglected; that we must often  submit the style to the matter, and frequently give up the praise of  elegance, satisfied with being clear.    The characters of nature are legible, it is true; but they are not plain  enough to enable those who run, to read them. We must make use of a  cautious, I had almost said, a timorous method of proceeding. We must  not attempt to fly, when we can scarcely pretend to creep. In  considering any complex matter, we ought to examine every distinct  ingredient in the composition, one by one; and reduce everything to the  utmost simplicity; since the condition of our nature binds us to a  strict law and very narrow limits. We ought afterwards to re-examine the  principles by the effect of the composition, as well as the composition  by that of the principles. We ought to compare our subject with things  of a similar nature, and even with things of a contrary nature; for  discoveries may be, and often are made by the contrast, which would  escape us on the single view. The greater number of the comparisons we  make, the more general and the more certain our knowledge is likely to  prove, as built upon a more extensive and perfect induction.    If an inquiry thus carefully conducted should fail at last of  discovering the truth, it may answer an end perhaps as useful, in  discovering to us the weakness of our own understanding. If it does not  make us knowing, it may make us modest. If it does not preserve us from  error, it may at least from the spirit of error; and may make us  cautious of pronouncing with positiveness or with haste, when so much  labor may end in so much uncertainty.    I could wish that, in examining this theory, the same method were  pursued which I endeavored to observe in forming it. The objections, in  my opinion, ought to be proposed, either to the several principles as  they are distinctly considered, or to the justness of the conclusion  which is drawn from them. But it is common to pass over both the  premises and conclusion in silence, and to produce, as an objection,  some poetical passage which does not seem easily accounted for upon the  principles I endeavor to establish. This manner of proceeding I should  think very improper. The task would be infinite, if we could establish  no principle until we had previously unravelled the complex texture of  every image or description to be found in poets and orators. And though  we should never be able to reconcile the effect of such images to our  principles, this can never overturn the theory itself, whilst it is  founded on certain and indisputable facts. A theory founded on  experiment, and not assumed, is always good for so much as it explains.  Our inability to push it indefinitely is no argument at all against it.  This inability may be owing to our ignorance of some necessary  _mediums_; to a want of proper application; to many other causes besides  a defect in the principles we employ. In reality, the subject requires a  much closer attention than we dare claim from our manner of treating  it.    If it should not appear on the face of the work, I must caution the  reader against imagining that I intended a full dissertation on the  Sublime and Beautiful. My inquiry went no farther than to the origin of  these ideas. If the qualities which I have ranged under the head of the  Sublime be all found consistent with each other, and all different from  those which I place under the head of Beauty; and if those which compose  the class of the Beautiful have the same consistency with themselves,  and the same opposition to those which are classed under the  denomination of Sublime, I am in little pain whether anybody chooses to  follow the name I give them or not, provided he allows that what I  dispose under different heads are in reality different things in nature.  The use I make of the words may be blamed, as too confined or too  extended; my meaning cannot well be misunderstood.    To conclude: whatever progress may be made towards the discovery of  truth in this matter, I do not repent the pains I have taken in it. The  use of such inquiries may be very considerable. Whatever turns the soul  inward on itself, tends to concentre its forces, and to fit it for  greater and stronger flights of science. By looking into physical causes  our minds are opened and enlarged; and in this pursuit, whether we take  or whether we lose our game, the chase is certainly of service. Cicero,  true as he was to the academic philosophy, and consequently led to  reject the certainty of physical, as of every other kind of knowledge,  yet freely confesses its great importance to the human understanding:  \"_Est animorum ingeniorumque nostrorum naturale quoddam quasi pabulum  consideratio contemplatioque naturae_.\" If we can direct the lights we  derive from such exalted speculations upon the humbler field of the  imagination, whilst we investigate the springs, and trace the courses of  our passions, we may not only communicate to the taste a sort of  philosophical solidity, but we may reflect back on the severer sciences  some of the graces and elegances of taste, without which the greatest  proficiency in those sciences will always have the appearance of  something illiberal.
