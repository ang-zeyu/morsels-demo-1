By-and-by Ghamba woke him gently,  and, pointing to Whitson, whose revolver lay in the leather case close  to his hand, whispered:    \"Did he not tell you to keep awake?\"    Langley was grateful for this evidence of consideration, but he could  not quite make out how Ghamba had been able to understand what Whitson  had said. However, when the latter awoke, Langley said nothing to him  about having disobeyed instructions.    Ghamba said that about two hours' walk would now bring them to  Umhlonhlo's cave, so they started off briskly at dusk. Their course now  led for some distance along a mountain ledge covered with wild bamboo,  through which the pathway wound. Then they crossed a steep saddle  between two enormous peaks, after which they plunged into another deep  and winding gorge. This they followed until they reached a part where  it was so narrow that the sides seemed almost to touch over their heads.  Beyond the cliffs fell apart, and then apparently curved toward each  other again, thus forming an immense amphitheatre. At the entrance to  this Ghamba stopped, and said in a whisper that they were now close to  the cave.    They now held a consultation, in terms of which it was decided that  Ghamba should go forward and reconnoitre. So Whitson and Langley sat  down close together and waited, conversing in low tones.    Whitson felt very uneasy, but Langley tried to argue him out of  his fears. The more Whitson saw of Ghamba, the more he disliked and  distrusted him and his teeth. The instinct which detects danger in the  absence of any apparent evidence of its existence is a faculty developed  in some men by an adventurous life. This faculty Whitson possessed in a  high degree.    \"Did you keep awake all the time I slept this afternoon?\" he asked.    Langley feared Whitson and felt inclined to lie, but something impelled  him, almost against his will, to speak the truth now.    \"No,\" he replied; \"I slept for a few minutes.\"    Whitson drew his revolver and opened the breech.    \"By God!\" he said, \"the cartridges are gone!\"    Langley took his weapon out of the leather case and opened it. He found  the cartridges were there right enough.    \"Have you any spare cartridges?\" asked Whitson.    Whitson had already loaded his revolver with the five cartridges  which he had removed in the afternoon, but he again took these out and  replaced them in his waistcoat pocket, and then he reloaded with some  which Langley passed over to him with a trembling hand.    \"Look here,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"we are in a trap of some  kind. When that old scoundrel comes back, do not let him know that we  have found out anything. We will walk on with him for a short distance,  at all events, and then be guided by circumstances. Stand by when you  see me collar him, and slip a sack over his head.\"    \"Can we not go back now?\" said Langley.    \"Certainly not; we would never find our way at night. I guess we must  see this circus out. If you have to shoot, aim low.\"    In a few minutes Ghamba returned.    \"Come on,\" he said. \"He is sitting at the fire in front of the cave. I  have just seen him.\"    \"Where is the cave?\" asked Whitson. \"Is it far from here?\"    \"We will reach it very soon; you can see the light of the fire from a  few paces ahead.\"    They walked on for about fifty yards, and there, sure enough, over a  rocky slope to their left, and at the foot of a crag about three hundred  yards away, could be seen the bright and fitful glow from a fire which  was hidden from their view by a low ridge of piled-up rocks.    Whitson stood still and questioned Ghamba:    \"Now tell me,\" he asked, through Langley as interpreter, \"how we are to  approach.\"    \"The pathway leads up on the left side,\" replied Ghamba. \"We will walk  close up to the crag, where there is a narrow passage between it and  that big black rock which you see against the light. You two can lead,  and I will be close behind. I have just seen him. He is sitting at the  fire, eating, and only the women are with him.\"    The last words were hardly out of the speaker's mouth before Whitson had  seized him by the throat with a vice-like grasp.    \"Seize his hands and hold them,\" he hissed to Langley.    Ghamba struggled desperately, but could not release himself. Whitson  compressed his throat until he became unconscious, and then gagged him  with a pocket-handkerchief. Ghamba's hands were then tied tightly behind  his back with another pocket-handkerchief, and his feet were firmly  secured with a belt. An empty sack (from which they had removed their  provisions) was then drawn over his head and shoulders, and secured  round the waist.    \"Come on now, quickly,\" whispered Whitson, and he and Langley started  off in the direction of the fire, after first taking off their boots.    They did not approach by the course which Ghamba had indicated, but made  their way quietly up the slope, straight against the face of the crag.  They reached the heap of rocks, and crept in among them by means of  another narrow passage, close to the inner end of which the fire was;  and this is what they saw through the twigs of a scrubby bush which  effectually concealed them:    A large cave opened into the side of the mountain, and just before the  mouth was an open space about twenty yards in diameter, surrounded on  all sides, except that of the mountain itself, by a wall of loosely  piled rocks, through which passages led out in different directions.  Just in front of the cave burned a bright fire, around which crouched  four most hideous and filthy-looking old hags, and against which were  propped several large earthenware pots of native make, full of water.  Standing behind rocks, one at each side of the inner entrance to  the passage, which was evidently that communicating with the pathway  indicated by Ghamba as the one they were to approach by, were two  powerful-looking men, stark naked, and as black as ebony, their skins  shining in the light of the fire. Each man held a coiled thong in his  hands, after the manner of a sailor about to heave a line. While they  were looking, a woman, somewhat younger in appearance than any of those  who sat by the fire, came out of the cave carrying a strong club about  three feet long. She crouched down close to the man standing on the  left-side of the passage, who, as well as his companion, stood as still  as a marble statue, and in an expectant attitude.    Whitson and Langley, with their revolvers drawn, suddenly stepped out  of their concealment, and walked toward the fire. This evidently  disconcerted the men with the thongs, who apparently did not expect  their intended prey to approach by any course except the passage near  which they were standing; but after a slight pause of hesitancy the  thongs were whirling in the air, and descending, lasso-fashion, upon  the shoulders of the intruders. The noose caught Langley over his  arms, which were instantly drawn close against his body as the thong  tightened, so he was thus rendered completely powerless; but Whitson  sprang, quick as lightning, to one side, and escaped. Three shots  from his revolver rang out in as many seconds, and the two men and the  woman--who was in the act of lifting her club to brain Langley--lay  rolling on the ground, each with a bullet through the head.    The four old hags at the fire began to mow and scream, and got up and  hobbled into the cave. Whitson drew his knife and cut the thong with  which Langley was vainly struggling, and then the two men, pale as  death, looked silently at each other with staring eyes.    Whitson replaced his revolver, and then made a sort of torch out of dry  reeds, a pile of which lay close at hand. He then, leaving Langley to  guard the cave, carefully examined all the passages and spaces between  the rocks, but he could find no trace of any one. The two men thereupon  entered the cave, Whitson holding the torch high over his head. They  found that it ran straight in for about fifteen paces, and then curved  sharply to the left.    It was about four paces in width, and about eight feet high, the roof  being roughly arched. The walls and roof were covered with thick black  greasy soot; and an indescribably horrible stench, which increased the  farther they advanced, made them almost vomit. They found that where the  cave curved to the left it ended in a circular chamber about eight paces  in diameter, and at one side of this crouched the four old hags, huddled  together, and mowing and chattering horribly.    Across a cleft about two feet wide, in the right-hand wall of the cave,  a stick was fixed transversely, and hanging to this were some lumps of  half-dried and smoked flesh. Whitson went up close and examined these  carefully. He drew back with a shudder, and his face changed from pale  to ashen gray.    He and Langley then went outside and stood for a while in the fresh air.  They could endure, just then, no more of the fetid atmosphere inside.  After a short time they gathered up some dry twigs and reeds, and set  several little heaps alight at different spots inside. This had the  effect of making the atmosphere more bearable in the course of a few  minutes. They then made a larger fire in the middle of the cave, and  proceeded to examine it more closely.    They found several old iron picks, such as are used by natives  in cultivating their fields, some very filthy skins, a number of  earthenware pots, a few knives, and an axe; but nothing more.    The floor of the cave was of clay, and at one spot it appeared to have  been recently disturbed. Here Langley began to dig with a pick, which,  just below the surface, struck against some hard substance. This, when  uncovered, proved to be a bone. He threw it to one side and dug deeper,  uncovering more bones--some old, and others comparatively fresh, but  emitting a horrible smell. He stooped and picked one up, but dropped it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19800"],[0,"London and the Kingdom - Volume 1 (#14)"],[1," which  was granted by the young king extended to the Londoners, who became  reconciled and received back their lands,(209) but did not extend to the  clergy, who were left to the tender mercy of the papal legate.    (M137)    For some years to come there remained a party in the city who cherished  the memory of Louis, and the cry of \"Mountjoy!\" the war-cry of the French  king--was sufficient to cause a riot as late as 1222, when Constantine  Fitz-Athulf or Olaf, an ex-sheriff of London, raised the cry at a  tournament, in order to test the feeling of the populace towards Louis.  Any serious results that might have arisen were promptly prevented by  Hubert de Burgh, the justiciar, who very quickly sought out the  ringleader, and incontinently caused him and two of his followers to be  hanged at the Elms in Smithfield. Whilst the halter was round his neck,  Fitz-Athulf offered 15,000 marks of silver for his life. The offer was  declined. He was not to be allowed another chance of stirring up sedition  in the city.(210)    A more circumstantial account of this event is given us by another  chronicler,(211) who relates that the wrestling match which took place on  the festival of Saint James (25th July),--the same as that mentioned by  Matthew Paris--was held at Queen Matilda's hospital in the suburbs,(212)  and was a match between the citizens of London and those outside; that  victory declared itself in favour of the Londoners, and that their  opponents, and among them the steward of the Abbot of Westminster,  thereupon left in high dudgeon. With thoughts of revenge in their hearts,  the latter caused invitations to be issued for another match to be held at  Westminster, on the following feast of Saint Peter ad Vincula (1st  August).    It was at this second and later match that the trouble began. The steward  was not content with collecting the most powerful athletes he could find,  but caused them to seize weapons and to attack the defenceless citizens  who had come to take part in the games. The Londoners hurried home,  bleeding with wounds, and immediately took counsel as to what was best to  be done. Serlo, the mercer, who had held the office of mayor of the city  for the past five years, and was of a peaceable disposition, suggested  referring the matter to the abbot; and it was then that Constantine, who  had a large following, advocated an attack upon the houses of the abbot  and of his steward. No sooner said than done, and many houses had already  suffered before the justiciar appeared upon the scene with a large force.  As to the seizure of Constantine and his subsequent execution, the  chroniclers agree.    Constantine's fellow citizens were very indignant at the indecent haste  with which the justiciar had caused his execution to be carried out, and  did not fail to bring the matter up in judgment against him, when, some  ten years later, Hubert de Burgh himself fell into disgrace.(213) The  result was, that the justiciar took refuge in the Priory of Merton. When  the citizens received the king's orders to follow him there, and to take  him dead or alive, they obeyed with unconcealed joy. They allowed little  time to elapse, but set out at once, 20,000 strong, ready to tear him limb  from limb; but luckily they were stopped in time by another message from  the king, and Hubert obtained a respite.(214)    (M138)    At the time of Constantine's execution, there was real danger to be  anticipated from raising the cry in favour of any foreigner. The land was  already swarming with foreigners, and in that very year (viz. 1222), the  archbishop had been under the necessity of summoning a council of bishops  and nobles to be held in London, owing to dissensions that had arisen  between the Earl of Chester, William of Salisbury, the king's uncle, and  Hubert de Burgh, and to a rumour that had got abroad, that foreigners were  inciting the Earl of Chester to raise an insurrection.(215)    A few years later, the country was over-run by a brood of Italian usurers  who battened on the inhabitants, reducing many to beggary. When attempts  were made to rid the city of these pests, they sheltered themselves under  the protection of the Pope.(216)    Throughout the reign of Henry III, there was one continuous struggle  against foreign dominion, either secular or ecclesiastical. In this  struggle, none took a more active part than the citizens of London, and  \"when [in 1247], the nobles, clergy, and people of England put forth their  famous letter denouncing the wrongs which England suffered at the hands of  the Roman bishop, it was with the seal of the city of London, as the  centre of national life that the national protest was made.\"(217)    (M139)    Side by side with this struggle another was being carried on, a struggle  for the liberty of the subject against the tyranny and rapacity of the  king. More especially was this the case with the city. Henry was for ever  invading the rights and liberties of the citizens. Thus in 1239, he  insisted upon their admitting to the shrievalty one who had already been  dismissed from that office for irregular conduct, and because they refused  to forego their chartered right of election and to appoint the king's  nominee, the city was deprived of a mayor for three months and more.(218)    (M140)    The substitution of a _custos_ or warden appointed by the king for a mayor  elected by the citizens, and of bailiffs for sheriffs,--a procedure known  as \"taking the city into the king's hands,\"--was frequently resorted to  both by Henry and his successors, and notably by Edward I, in whose reign  the city was deprived of its mayor, and remained under government of a  _custos_ for thirteen consecutive years (1285-1298).(219)    Any pretext was sufficient for Henry's purpose. If the citizens harboured  a foreigner without warrant, not only was the city taken into the king's  hand, but the citizens were fined L1,000,(220) a sum equal to at least  L20,000 at the present day. A widow brings an action for a third part of  her late husband's goods in addition to her dower. The case goes against  her in the Court of Husting, and is heard on appeal before the king's  justiciar sitting at St. Martin's-le-Grand. The verdict is not set aside,  but some flaw is discovered in the mode of procedure; the explanation of  the citizens is deemed insufficient, and the mayor and sheriffs are  forthwith deposed, to be reinstated only on the understanding that they  will so far forego their chartered right--viz.: of not impleading nor being  impleaded without the walls of their city--as to consent to attend the  king's court at Westminster, where finally, and after considerable delay,  they are acquitted.(221)    Take another instance. The king had shown an interest in the Abbey Church  of Westminster, and had caused a new chapel to be built in 1220, he  himself laying the first stone. Thirty years later, or thereabouts, he  made certain concessions to the Abbot of Westminster--what they were we are  not told--but it is certain that they, in some way or other, infringed the  rights of the citizens of London in the County of Middlesex. The king  promised to compensate them for the loss they would sustain; but failing  to get their consent by fair promises, he resorted to his favourite  measure of taking the city into his own hands. For fifteen years the  dispute between the citizens and the Abbot as to their respective rights  in the County of Middlesex was kept alive, and was at last determined by a  verdict given by the barons of the exchequer, which completely  justified(222) the attitude taken up by the citizens of London.    (M141)    In 1230 he extorted a large sum of money from the citizens at a time when  he was meditating an expedition to the continent for the purpose of  recovering lost possessions. The citizens, however, were not the only  sufferers. The religious houses were heavily mulcted, as were also the  Jews, who, whether they would or not, were made to give up one third of  their chattels.(223) Again in 1244, the citizens of London and the Jews  were made to open their purse-strings that the king might the better be  able to pay his wine merchant, his wax chandler, and his tailor; but even  then his creditors were not paid in full.(224)    Only once does it appear that the king's conscience pricked him for the  extortions he was continually practising on the citizens. This was in  1250, when he called the citizens together at Westminster, and begged  their forgiveness for all trespasses, extortions of goods and victuals  under the name of \"prises,\" and for forced loans or talliages. Seeing no  other way out of it, the citizens acceded to his request.(225) As recently  as the previous year (1249) he had exacted from them a sum of L2,000.(226)    (M142)    Henry had been crowned at Gloucester soon after his accession.(227)  Nevertheless he was again crowned--this time in London in 1236, after his  marriage with Eleanor of Provence. The city excelled itself in doing  honour to the king and queen as they passed on their way to Westminster:  but the joy of the citizens was damped by the king refusing to allow  Andrew Bukerel the mayor to perform the customary service of assisting the  chief butler at the coronation banquet. It was not a time for raising  questions of etiquette, so the mayor pocketed the affront, preferring to  settle the question of the city's rights at some more convenient time,  rather than damp the general joy of the company by pressing his  claim.(228)    (M143)    Yet, notwithstanding his manifestly unjust treatment of the citizens of  London, and the cynical contempt with which he looked upon their ancient  claim to the title of \"barons,\" he usually went through the formality of  taking leave of them at Paul's Cross or at Westminster, before crossing  the sea to Gascony(229) and was not above making use of them when  compelled to sell his plate and jewels to"]]]
