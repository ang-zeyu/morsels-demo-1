The rings are strung on iron rods secured by metal-work at one end  of the bookcase. There are in this chamber eighty capacious oak cupboards,  which contain the whole of the deeds and documents belonging to the Dean  and Chapter, the accumulation of eight centuries.                           [Illustration: THE REREDOS.]                                   THE REREDOS.    _Photochrom Co., Ld., Photo._      Among the most remarkable printed books are:--A series of Bibles, 1480 to  1690; Caxton's _Legenda Aurea_, 1483; Higden's _Polychronicon_, by Caxton,  1495; Lyndewode, _Super Constitutiones Provinciales,_ 1475; Nonius  Marcellus, _De proprietate sermonum_, 1476, printed at Venice by Nicolas  Jenson; and the _Nuremberg Chronicle_, completed July 1493. Of the  manuscripts, the most interesting is an ancient _Antiphonarium_,  containing the old \"Hereford Use.\" One of the documents attached to this  volume states: \"The Dean and Chapter of Hereford purchased this book of Mr  William Hawes at the price of twelve guineas. It was bought by him some  years since at a book-stall in Drury Lane, London, and attracted his  notice from the quantity of music which appeared interspersed in it.\"    The date of the writing is probably about 1270, the obit of Peter de  Aquablanca being entered in the Kalendar in the hand of the original  scribe and the following obit in another hand.    The oldest of all the treasures preserved at Hereford Cathedral, being  certainly one thousand years old at least, is a Latin version of the Four  Gospels written in Anglo-Saxon characters.    The Rev. F. Havergal thus describes it: \"This MS. is written on stout  vellum, and measures about 9 x 7 inches. It consists of 135 leaves. Three  coloured titles remain, those to the Gospels of St. Matthew, St. Mark, and  St. John. Two illuminated leaves are missing--those that would follow folio  1 and folio 59. With the exception of these two lacunae, the MS. contains  the whole of the Four Gospels.    No exact date can be assigned, but several eminent authorities agree that  it is the work of the eighth or ninth century.    It does not exactly accord with any of the other well-known MS. of that  period, having a peculiar character of its own.    From the evidence of the materials it would appear to have been written in  the country, probably in Mercia, and not at any of the great monasteries.    The text of this MS. is ante-Hieronymian, and offers a valuable example of  the Irish (or British) recension of the original African text. Thus it has  a large proportion of readings in common with the Cambridge Gospels, St.  Chad's Gospels, the Rushworth Gospels, and the Book of Deir.    On the concluding leaves of this volume there is an entry of a deed in  Anglo-Saxon made in the reign of Canute, of which the following is a  translation:--    \"Note of a Shire-mote held at AEgelnoth's Stone in Herefordshire in the  reign of King Cnut, at which were present the Bishop Athelstan, the  Sheriff Bruning, and AEgelgeard of Frome, and Leofrine of Frome, and Godric  of Stoke, and all the thanes in Herefordshire. At which assembly Edwine,  son of Enneawne, complained against his mother concerning certain lands at  Welintone and Cyrdesley. The bishop asked who should answer for the  mother, which Thurcyl the White proffered to do if he knew the cause of  accusation.    \"Then they chose three thanes and sent to the mother to ask her what the  cause of complaint was. Then she declared that she had no land that  pertained in ought to her son, and was very angry with him, and calling  Leofloeda, her relative, she, in presence of the thanes, bequeathed to her  after her own death all her lands, money, clothes, and property, and  desired them to inform the Shire-mote of her bequest, and desire them to  witness it. They did so; after which Thurcyl the White (who was husband of  Leofloeda) stood up, and requested the thanes to deliver free (or clean) to  his wife all the lands that had been bequeathed to her, and they so did.  And after this Thurcyl rode to St. Ethelbert's Minster, and by leave and  witness of all the folk caused the transaction to be recorded in a book of  the Gospels.\"    *An Ancient Chasse or Reliquary* is shown among the treasures of the  cathedral, which was looked upon for a long time as a representation of  the murder of St. Ethelbert, but this is only an example of the many  traditional tales which modern study and research are compelled to  discard. It undoubtedly represents the martyrdom of St. Thomas of  Canterbury. On the lower part is the murder; on the upper, the entombment  of the saint, very similar in style to the later Limoges work of the  thirteenth century.    The Rev. Francis Havergal gives a detailed description, which we have  condensed to the following:--    This reliquary consists of oak, perfectly sound, covered with copper  plates overlaid with Limoges enamel. It is 8-1/4 inches high, 7 long and  3-1/2 broad. The back opens on hinges and fastens with a lock and key, and  the upper part sloped so as to form an acutely-pointed roof; above this is  a ridge-piece; the whole rests on four square feet. Front of Shrine:--Here  are two compartments; the lower one shows on the right side an altar, of  which the south end faces the spectator; it is supported on four legs and  has an antependium. Upon the altar stands a plain cross on a pyramidal  base, and in front of it a chalice covered with a paten. Before, or  technically speaking, in the midst of the altar stands a bishop  celebrating mass, having both hands extended towards the chalice, as if he  were about to elevate it. He has curly hair and a beard and moustache. He  wears a low mitre, a chasuble, fringed maniple, and an alb.    In the top right-hand corner is a cloud from which issues a hand pointing  towards the figure just described.    Behind, to the left, stand three figures. The foremost has just thrust the  point of a large double-edged sword, with a plain cross hilt, through the  neck of the bishop from back to front.               [Illustration: ANCIENT RELIQUARY IN THE CATHEDRAL.]                       ANCIENT RELIQUARY IN THE CATHEDRAL.      The upper compartment represents the entombment of the bishop. The middle  of the design is occupied by an altar tomb, into which the body, swathed  in a diapered winding-sheet, is being lowered.    The ends of the bier are supported by two kneeling figures.    On the side of the tomb furthest from the spectator is a bishop or abbot  without the mitre looking toward a figure on his right, who carries a  tablet or open book with some words upon it.    At either extremity of this panel stands a figure censing the corpse with  a circular thurible.    The border of each compartment is formed by a double invected pattern of  gold and enamel. The ridge-piece is of copper perforated with eight  keyhole ornaments.    The back of the shrine is also divided into two compartments, and is  decorated with quatrefoils.    It is pierced in the middle of the upper border by a keyhole communicating  with a lock on the inside.    The right-hand gable is occupied by the figure of a female saint. The left  gable is occupied by the figure of a male saint.    A border of small gilt quatrefoils on a chocolate ground runs round the  margins of the two ends and four back plates.    Those parts of the copper plates which are not enamelled are gilded, while  the colours used in the enamelling are blue, are light-blue, green,  yellow, red, chocolate, and white.    In the interior, on that side to which the lower front plate corresponds,  is a cross _pattee fitchee_ painted in red upon oak, which oak bears  traces of having been stained with blood or some other liquid. The wood at  the bottom is evidently modern. This reliquary is said to have been  originally placed upon the high altar. It appears to have been preserved  by some ancient Roman Catholic family until it came into the possession of  the late Canon Russell, and bequeathed by him to the authorities of the  cathedral.    The art of enamelling metals appears to have been introduced from  Byzantium through Venice into Western Europe at the close of the tenth  century. After this time Greek artists are known to have visited this  country, and to have carried on a lucrative trade in the manufacture of  sacred vessels, shrines, etc.    *Ancient Gold Rings.* One of pure gold, supposed to have been worn by a  knight templar, was ploughed up near Hereford. The device on the raised  besel is a cross pattee in a square compartment, on each side of which are  a crescent and a triple-thonged scourge.    Within the hoop is engraved in black-letter character \"_Sancte Michael_.\"  Date about 1380.    A massive ring set with a rough ruby of pale colour was found in the tomb  of Bishop Mayew. On each side a bold tan cross with a bell is engraved.  These were originally filled with green enamel. Inside is engraved and  enamelled \"Ave Maria.\"    A superb ring was also found in Bishop Stanbury's tomb, on the north side  of the altar. It contains a fine and perfect sapphire, and flowers and  foliage are beautifully worked in black enamel on each side of the stone.    A fine gold ring was discovered in Bishop Trilleck's grave in 1813, but  was stolen in 1838 from the cathedral. It was never recovered, though  _L_30 was offered as a reward.    *The Stained Glass* has survived only in a few fragments, scattered about  the eastern end of the cathedral.    Some of the best, apparently of early fourteenth century date, is in one  of the lancets on the south side of the Lady Chapel, west of the Audley  Chapel. The subjects are:    1. Christ surrounded by symbols of the four evangelists; 2. Lamb and flag;  3. Angel and Maries at the sepulchre; 4. Crucifixion; 5. Christ bearing  His cross.    In the north-east transept is an ancient glass window, restored and  entirely releaded by Warrington, at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19494"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Albans (#14)"],[1,"manor to the Abbey.    2. #Eadric.# He was elected in 796, according to the express wishes of  the founder, from among the inmates of the monastery. He was of royal  blood and had the King's support in some critical difficulties, and  ruled with discretion.    3. #Wulsig.# This Abbot, like his predecessor, a monk and akin to the  King, scandalized the house by hunting in lay attire; and by  entertaining noble ladies within the precincts. He wasted the substance  of the Abbey by bestowing it upon his relations. Most of the property  that he had alienated was recovered after his death, and those whom he  had fattened died miserably in poverty. It is said that he was much  hated by the monks and died of poison.    4. #Wulnoth.# He began well, but after a few years gave himself up to  sport habited as a layman. He is said to have ruled eleven years, and to  have repented when affected by paralysis, and to have made a happy end.  The chronicler adds with sly humour that his change to holiness was  brought about \"_faciendo de necessitate virtutem._\" In his time the  Danes plundered the Abbey of its treasures, vestments and sacred  vessels, and carried off the bones of St. Alban to Owense (probably  Odense in Funen). The sacrist Egwin was much distressed at the loss of  this his greatest treasure, and prayed that he might see the body  brought back. St. Alban appeared to him in a vision, and bade him go to  Owense and there await instructions. After a year's stay at the  monastery he was admitted into the brotherhood and became sacrist, never  revealing the fact that he had come from St. Albans. Long did he wait  for an opportunity of carrying away the sacred bones, until one winter's  night he found means of removing them from the shrine wherein they were  kept, and packing them in a chest, which he gave to an English merchant  whom he knew, bidding him take it to St. Albans. He said that it  contained books which the Abbot had lent him, and which he was now  returning; he added that he would shortly bring the key himself, or, if  he could not come himself, would send it by a messenger. Together with  the chest, which in due course was delivered, a letter was sent  detailing the circumstances of his pious fraud; this was read by the  Abbot in chapter, to the great joy of the brethren. Egwin shortly after  this obtained leave to make a journey to England, and when safely in the  Abbey he wrote to the monks at Owense, telling them what he had done.  Some of them denounced him as guilty of sacrilege, others justified his  action. When he opened the chest in the chapter-house at St. Albans  miraculous cures were wrought on many who were infirm, both in the Abbey  and in the town.    5. #Eadfrith.# This Abbot was handsome in person, but despicable in his  deeds. He never attended the services in the choir. During his time  Wulfa, the prior, built an oratory in honour of Germanus on the spot  where the rude dwelling he had occupied when visiting St. Albans lay in  ruins. After Wulfa's death Eadfrith saw the error of his ways, resigned  his office, became a hermit, and died a holy man.    No new Abbot was appointed for a year, as the monks were divided into  two parties in favour of rival candidates.    6. #Wulsin.# The bishop after a time intervened and put an end to the  dissension, and the monks unanimously elected Wulsin, or Ulsinus. He  helped the inhabitants of the town to build the three churches of St.  Michael, St. Stephen, and St. Peter (see Appendix). He died holy and  full of days.    7. #AElfric.# This Abbot purchased of King Eadgar a large fishpond which  was too near the Abbey to be pleasant; he drained it, leaving only a  small pool of water and a bed of reeds, converting the rest of it into  gardens. He translated into Saxon some of the historical books of the  Old Testament. His doctrine on the Lord's Supper, as expounded in a  letter to Wulfstan, Bishop of Sherborne, which is preserved at Exeter,  was identical with that of the twenty-eighth Article of Religion. He  died \"full of days, eminent for sanctity, after having achieved many  praiseworthy actions.\"    8. #Ealdred.# He ruled but for a short time, but was a benefactor to the  town. He cleared away much of the ruins of Verulamium, especially those  caverns which had become the abode of robbers and outlaws. He also  collected materials (chiefly from the Roman ruins)--tiles, stone, and  timber--with a view to the rebuilding of the abbey church.    9. #Eadmer.# He was pious, courteous, learned, but he left the monastery  much in debt, so that some possessions had to be sold and some timber to  be cut down.    10. #AElfric# is described as of singular and conspicuous merit. He wrote  a history of St. Alban, and arranged it for musical recitation. Being  afraid of a Danish invasion, and thinking that the relics of the  protomartyr, which had already been once carried away to Denmark, would  not be safe in the shrine as it stood, he hid them under the altar of  St. Nicholas, and at the same time pretended to send them to Ely for  safe custody, giving the authorities at Ely to understand that the true  relics were being committed to their charge; this, it is said, he did  being a prudent and circumspect man, and fearing that the men at Ely  would be blinded by covetousness, and refuse to return the true relics  if they once got them into their possession. The Danish invasion was  soon over, the King being drowned, and then AElfric demanded from the  monks of Ely the relics he had intrusted to their care. The caution he  had exercised was justified by the conduct of the Ely monks; for they,  thinking that the bones they had were really those of St. Alban, at  first refused to return them, but at last consented to do so. The bones,  however, that they sent back were not those they had received. It is  plain that these old monks were not always to be trusted to behave in an  honourable manner when precious relics were concerned. The chronicler,  however, who tells the story, considers the conduct of the monks of St.  Albans in sending spurious relics was \"pious,\" while the behaviour of  the monks of Ely was \"detestable and disgraceful\"--but then the  chronicler was a monk of St. Albans. AElfric bought the royal palace of  Kingsbury and its land near the Abbey, demolishing the whole of the  palace except one tower. AElfric in 995 was promoted to the office of  Archbishop of Canterbury.    11. #Leofric.#[10] This Abbot was half brother to AElfric. During a great  famine he spent large sums in the relief of the poor, devoting to this  purpose even some of the treasures that had been got together for the  rebuilding of the church, and many gold and silver vessels assigned to  his own use in the Abbey. The monks, however, objected to this  conversion of the property of the Abbey to uses for which it was not  originally intended.        [10] The \"Gesta Abbatum\" reverses the order of the two Abbots,           AElfric and Leofric, but this is probably wrong. It is recorded           that Leofric had the offer of the archbishopric, but declined,           saying that his brother AElfric was far more fit for the post           than he, and it is supposed that when AElfric became Archbishop           in 995, Leofric succeeded him as Abbot.    12. #Leofstan.# This Abbot was confessor to King Edward (the Confessor)  and his Queen Edith. He acquired much land for the Abbey, and cleared  away the woods between London and St. Albans, to make the roads safer  for travellers. To secure the good services of a knight as protector of  the Abbey he assigned him a certain manor; the service was faithfully  performed. The Normans, when they came, dispossessed the holder, and  conferred the manor upon Roger, a Norman knight, who, strange to say,  fulfilled the conditions on which his predecessor had held the land. At  Leofstan's death the Abbey was in a state of the greatest prosperity.    13. #Frithric.# This Abbot was chosen in the reign of Harold as leader  of the southerners against the Normans, just as Aldred, Archbishop of  York, was chosen as the leader of the northcountrymen. William  accordingly ravaged the possessions of the monastery. After the  Conquest, when William was accepted as King, Frithric administered to  him the oath that he would keep inviolate all the laws of the realm,  which former kings, especially Edward, had established. Needless to say,  William soon began to disregard this oath, and despoiled the Abbey of  St. Alban's more and more, till Frithric in despair resigned his office  as Abbot and retired to Ely, where he soon died. The monks of Ely  pretended that he took with him to their monastery the precious relics  of St. Alban the Martyr.    14. #Paul of Caen# (1077-1093). A great change now comes over the  history of the monastery. The new Abbot was a Norman and a kinsman of  Lanfranc, the first Norman Archbishop of Canterbury. Like Lanfranc, who  had been Abbot of Caen, he resolved to rebuild his church, and, like  Lanfranc, adopted in England the style he had been accustomed to at  Caen; but his ideas on the matter of size were far grander than that of  his former Abbot, for St. Alban's Abbey Church far surpassed in its  dimensions the cathedral church which the new archbishop built at  Canterbury. As we have already seen (Chap. I.), he used the Roman bricks  from the ruined city of Verulamium as building material. Important as  this work was, the account of it occupies but a few lines in the  Chronicles. In these it is mentioned that Lanfranc contributed 1,000  marks towards the cost. Paul was an energetic man, as may be seen by the  short time occupied in building this large church; but it was not only  in providing a new church that he was active, for it is recorded that he  reformed the lives and manners of the monks, secured the restoration of  land that had been alienated, founded cells as occasion demanded, and  persuaded lay donors to "]]]
