The next quotation is also of 'morning music,' but with a different  object--not a lady, but a soldier, and of a somewhat rough and ready  kind, to judge by the Clown's critical remarks.    The passage seems to indicate the use of Bagpipes; for 'they speak  in the _nose_' (see _Merchant_ IV, i, 48), and are called  _wind_-instruments, and are mentioned under the name 'pipes' in the  last two lines. Moreover, there is the remark of the Clown,  represented here by stars, which is terribly appropriate to that  instrument.    _Othello_ III, i. Cassio brings musicians to salute Othello.         _Cass._ Masters, _play here_; I will content your pains:       Something that's brief; and bid \"Good morrow, general.\"         [_Music._]         _Enter Clown._         _Clo._ Why, masters, _have your instruments been in Naples_,       that they _speak i' the nose_ thus?         _1 Mus._ How, sir, how?         _Clo._ Are these, I pray you, called _wind_-instruments?         _1 Mus._ Ay, marry, are they, sir.           *       *       *       *       *         _Clo._ ... masters, here's money for you; and _the general       so likes your music_, that _he desires you_, for love's       sake, _to make no more noise with it_.         _1 Mus._ Well, sir, we will not.         _Clo._ If you have _any music that may not be heard_, to't       again; but, as they say, to _hear_ music the general does       not greatly care.         _1 Mus._ _We have none such_, sir.         _Clo._ Then _put up your pipes in your bag_, for I'll away.       Go; vanish into air, away!    Pandarus appears to be a capital musician. In the following we find  him questioning a musical servant of Priam's palace about some  instrumental music which is going on within, 'at the request of  Paris.' The servant amuses himself by giving 'cross' answers to  Pandarus' crooked questions, and in the process gets out two or three  musical jokes--_e.g._, '_partly_ know,' 'music _in parts_,' '_wholly_,  sir.' Further on, Paris also plays on the term 'broken' music.    _Troilus and Cressida_ III, i, 19.         _Pandarus._ What music is this?         _Servant._ I do but _partly_ know, sir; it is _music in       parts_.         _Pandarus._ Know you the _musicians_?         _Serv._ _Wholly_, sir.         _Pan._ Who play they to?         _Serv._ To the hearers, sir.         _Pan._ At whose pleasure, friend?         _Serv._ At mine, sir, and _theirs that love music_.           *       *       *       *       *         L. 52.         _Pan._ Fair prince, here is _good broken music_.         _Paris._ _You_ have _broke_ it, cousin; and, by my life, you       shall make it whole again: you shall _piece_ it out with a       _piece_ of your performance. [To _Helen_] Nell, he       [_Pandarus_] is _full of harmony_.           *       *       *       *       *         L. 95.         _Pan._ ... Come, _give me an instrument_. [And at Helen's       request, Pandarus sings, 'Love, love, nothing but love.']    The custom of having instrumental music in taverns has already been  referred to in the Introduction, near the end, where we learn that the  charge for playing before the guests was twenty shillings for two  hours in Shakespeare's time; also that a man could hardly go into a  public house of entertainment without being followed by two or three  itinerant musicians, who would either sing or play for his pleasure,  while he was at dinner. Accordingly, we find Sir John Falstaff  enjoying such a performance at the Boar's Head, Eastcheap.    _H. 4. B._ II, iv, 10.         _1 Drawer._ Why then, cover, and set them down: and see if       thou canst find out _Sneak's noise_; Mistress Tearsheet       would fain have _some music_. (After supper, in a cooler       room.)         _Id._ l. 227.         _Page._ The _music_ is come, sir.         _Falstaff._ Let them _play_.---- _Play_, sirs.         _Id._ l. 380.         _Fal._ _Pay the musicians_, sirrah.    The term 'Sneak's noise' is most interesting. 'Noise' means a company  of musicians, and Mr Sneak was the gentleman who gave his name to the  particular band of instrumentalists who favoured the Boar's Head.    Milton uses the word, in this sense, in the poem 'At a Solemn Music,'  where the 'saintly shout' of the seraphic choir, with 'loud uplifted  angel-trumpets,' 'immortal harps of golden wires,' and the singing of  psalms and hymns, are collectively called 'that melodious _noise_.'  Also in his Hymn on the Nativity, verse ix., he has 'stringed  _noise_'--_i.e._, band of stringed instruments. The Prayer-book  Version (Great Bible) of the Psalms, which was made in 1540, has the  word in Ps. lxxxi. 1, 'Make a cheerful _noise_ unto the God of  Jacob,' and this in the next verses is said to consist of various  musical instruments--_e.g._, the tabret, harp, lute, and trumpet. Also  in the Authorised Version of 1611, Ps. xxxiii. 3, 'play skilfully with  a loud _noise_,' which was the instrumental accompaniment to a 'new  song.' The same word is used in several other places, with the meaning  of 'music'--_e.g._, Pss. lxvi. 1; xcv. 1, 2; xcviii. 4, 6; c. 1; where  'to make a joyful noise' is represented in the original by the same  verb, except in one of the two cases in Ps. xcviii. 4.    The word was still in use in 1680, when Dr Plot was present at the  annual Bull-running held by the Minstrels of Tutbury, one of the  features of which festivity was a banquet, with 'a Noise of musicians  playing to them.'    The reputed cure of the Tarantula's bite by music has already been  mentioned. The next three examples are of somewhat similar cases.    In the first, Henry IV. in sickness asks for music; the second is an  account of Cerimon's attempt to rouse the half-drowned Thaisa with at  least partial assistance from music; while the third represents  Prospero using a solemn air to remove the magic spell which he had  cast on Alonso and his other enemies.    _H. 4. B._ IV, iv, 133. K. Hen. on his sick-bed.         _K. Hen._ Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;            Unless some _dull and favourable hand_            Will _whisper music_ to my wearied spirit.         _Warwick._ Call for the _music_ in the other room.    _Pericles_ III, ii, 87. Cerimon's house at Ephesus. Thaisa, cast up by  the sea, is brought to life by his directions.         _Cerimon._ Well said, well said; the fire and the cloths.            The _rough and woful music_ that we have,            _Cause it to sound_, beseech you.            The vial once more;--how thou stirr'st, thou block!--            _The music there!_ I pray you, give her air.    _Tempest_ V, i, 51. Prospero employs music to disenchant Alonso,  Antonio, etc.         _Pro._ ... and, _when I have required            Some heavenly music_ (which even now I do),            _To work mine end upon their senses_....         L. 58.              _A solemn air_; and the _best comforter            To an unsettled fancy_, cure thy brains.    Next we have two examples of 'Music at Home.' In the case of the Duke  in Twelfth Night, it is 'concerted' music, and the players seem to be  performing such a quaint old piece as 'The Lord of Salisbury his  Pavin,' by Gibbons, in _Parthenia_, the last 'strain' of which has  just such a 'dying fall' as is mentioned in line 4. [See the remarks  on the passage from _Lucrece_ in Section I. on the _technical_ meaning  of 'strain.']    _Twelfth Night_ I, i.         _Duke._ If _music_ be the _food of love_, play on;            Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,            The appetite may sicken, and so die.--            _That strain again!_ it had a _dying fall_:            O! it came o'er my ear like the _sweet sound_            That breathes upon a bank of violets,            Stealing and giving odour.--Enough! no more:            'Tis not so sweet now, as it was before.    Brutus' musical establishment is on a smaller scale than the Duke's.  He keeps a 'good boy,' who can sing to his own accompaniment on the  lute, and is such a willing servant as to perform when almost overcome  by sleep.    _Julius Caesar_ IV, iii, 256. Brutus and his servant Lucius.         _Bru._ Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.            Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,            And _touch_ thy _instrument_ a _strain_ or two?         _Luc._ Ay, my lord, an't please you.         _Bru._                              It does, my boy.            I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.                *       *       *       *       *         [Boy sings to lute.]         _Bru._ This is a _sleepy tune_: [Boy drops off]--O murderous slumber!            Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,            _That plays thee music_?--Gentle knave, good night;            I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.            If thou dost nod, thou _break'st thy instrument:            I'll take it from thee_; and, good boy, good night.--         [Ghost of Caesar appears.]         L. 290.         _Bru._ Boy!--Lucius!--Varro!

'Orpheus.']    The next passage brings us to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19699"],[0,"Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, \"Bréquigny, Louis Georges Oudard Feudrix (#14)"],[1,"tered, heated and run into casks, and is then  known as _sake_. The interest of this process consists in the fact that a  single micro-organism--a mould--is able to exercise the combined functions  of saccharification and fermentation. It replaces the diastase of malted  grain and also the yeast of a European brewery. Another liquid of interest  is _Weissbier_. This, which is largely produced in Berlin (and in some  respects resembles the _wheat-beer_ produced in parts of England), is  generally prepared from a mash of three parts of wheat malt and one part of  barley malt. The fermentation is of a symbiotic nature, two organisms,  namely a yeast and a fission fungus (the _lactic acid bacillus_) taking  part in it. The preparation of this peculiar double ferment is assisted by  the addition of a certain quantity of white wine to the yeast prior to  fermentation.    BREWING CHEMISTRY.--The principles of brewing technology belong for the  most part to physiological chemistry, whilst those of the cognate industry,  malting, are governed exclusively by that branch of knowledge. Alike in  following the growth of barley in field, its harvesting, maturing and  conversion into malt, as well as the operations of mashing malt, fermenting  wort, and conditioning beer, physiological chemistry is needed. On the  other hand, the consideration of the saline matter in waters, the  composition of the extract of worts and beers, and the analysis of brewing  materials and products generally, belong to the domain of pure chemistry.  Since the extractive matters contained in wort and beer consist for the  most part of the transformation products of starch, it is only natural that  these should have received special attention at the hands of scientific men  associated with the brewing industry. It was formerly believed that by the  action of diastase on starch the latter is first converted into a gummy  substance termed dextrin, which is then subsequently transformed into a  sugar--glucose. F.A. Musculus, however, in 1860, showed that sugar and  dextrin are simultaneously produced, and between the years 1872 and 1876  Cornelius O'Sullivan definitely proved that the sugar produced was maltose.  When starch-paste, the jelly formed by treating starch with boiling water,  is mixed with iodine solution, a deep blue coloration results. The first  product of starch degradation by either acids or diastase, namely soluble  starch, also exhibits the same coloration when treated with iodine. As  degradation proceeds, and the products become more and more soluble and  diffusible, the blue reaction with iodine gives place first to a purple,  then to a reddish colour, and finally the coloration ceases altogether. In  the same way, the optical rotating power decreases, and the cupric reducing  power (towards Fehling's solution) increases, as the process of hydrolysis  proceeds. C. O'Sullivan was the first to point out definitely the influence  of the temperature of the mash on the character of the products. The work  of Horace T. Brown (with J. Heron) extended that of O'Sullivan, and (with  G.H. Morris) established the presence of an intermediate product between  the higher dextrins and maltose. This product was termed maltodextrin, and  Brown and Morris were led to believe that a large number of these  substances existed in malt wort. They proposed for these substances the  generic name \"amyloins.\" Although according to their view they were  compounds of maltose and dextrin, they had the properties of mixtures of  these two substances. On the assumption of the existence of these  compounds, Brown and his colleagues formulated what is known as the  maltodextrin or amyloin hypothesis of starch degradation. C.J. Lintner, in  1891, claimed to have separated a sugar, isomeric with maltose, which is  termed isomaltose, from the products of starch hydrolysis. A.R. Ling and  J.L. Baker, as well as Brown and Morris, in 1895, proved that this  isomaltose was not a homogeneous substance, and evidence tending to the  same conclusion was subsequently brought forward by continental workers.  Ling and Baker, in 1897, isolated the following compounds from the products  of starch hydrolysis--maltodextrin-[alpha], C_{36}H_{62}O_{31}, and  maltodextrin-[beta], C_{24}H_{42}O_{21} (previously named by Prior,  achroodextrin III.). They also separated a substance, C_{12}H_{22}O_{11},  isomeric with maltose, which had, however, the characteristics of a  dextrin. This is probably identical with the so-called dextrinose isolated  by V. Syniewski in 1902, which yields a phenylosazone melting at 82-83 deg. C.  It has been proved by H. Ost that the so-called isomaltose of Lintner is a  mixture of maltose and another substance, maltodextrin, isomeric with Ling  and Baker's maltodextrin-[beta].    The theory of Brown and Morris of the degradation of starch, although based  on experimental evidence of some weight, is by no means universally  accepted. Nevertheless it is of considerable interest, as it offers a  rational and consistent explanation of the phenomena known to accompany the  transformation of starch by diastase, and even if not strictly correct it  has, at any rate, proved itself to be a practical working hypothesis, by  which the mashing and fermenting operations may be regulated and  controlled. According to Brown and Morris, the starch molecule consists of  five amylin groups, each of which corresponds to the molecular formula  (C_{12}H_{20}O_{10})_{20}. Four of these amylin radicles are grouped  centrally round the fifth, thus:--      (C_{12}H_{20}O_{10})_{20}                       (C_{12}H_{20}O_{10})_{20}                            \\                       /                            (C_{12}H_{20}O_{10})_{20}                            /                       \\    (C_{12}H_{20}O_{10})_{20}                       (C_{12}H_{20}O_{10})_{20}    By the action of diastase, this complex molecule is split up, undergoing  hydrolysis into four groups of amyloins, the fifth or central group  remaining unchanged (and under brewing conditions unchangeable), forming  the substance known as stable dextrin. When diastase acts on starch-paste,  hydrolysis proceeds as far as the reaction represented by the following  equation:--      5(C_{12}H_{20}O_{10})_{20} + 80 H_2O          starch.                 water.          = 80 C_{12}H_{22}O_{11} + (C_{12}H_{20}O_{10})_{20}                 maltose.                  stable dextrin.    The amyloins are substances containing varying numbers of amylin (original  starch or dextrin) groups in conjunction with a proportional number of  maltose groups. They are not separable into maltose and dextrin by any of  the ordinary means, but exhibit the properties of mixtures of these  substances. As the process of hydrolysis proceeds, the amyloins become  gradually poorer in amylin and relatively richer in maltose-groups. The  final products of transformation, according to Brown and J.H. Millar, are  maltose and glucose, which latter is derived from the hydrolysis of the  stable dextrin. This theory may be applied in practical brewing in the  following manner. If it is desired to obtain a beer of a stable  character--that is to say, one containing a considerable proportion of  high-type amyloins--it is necessary to restrict the action of the diastase  in the mash-tun accordingly. On the other hand, for mild running ales,  which are to \"condition\" rapidly, it is necessary to provide for the  presence of sufficient maltodextrin of a low type. Investigation has shown  that the type of maltodextrin can be regulated, not only in the mash-tun  but also on the malt-kiln. A higher type is obtained by low kiln and high  mashing temperatures than by high kiln and low mashing heats, and it is  possible therefore to regulate, on scientific lines, not only the quality  but also the type of amyloins which are suitable for a particular beer.    The chemistry of the nitrogenous constituents of malt is equally important  with that of starch and its transformations. Without nitrogenous compounds  of the proper type, vigorous fermentations are not possible. It may be  remembered that yeast assimilates nitrogenous compounds in some of their  simpler forms--amides and the like. One of the aims of the maltster is,  therefore, to break down the protein substances present in barley to such a  degree that the wort has a maximum nutritive value for the yeast. Further,  it is necessary for the production of stable beer to eliminate a large  proportion of nitrogenous matter, and this is only done by the yeast when  the proteins are degraded. There is also some evidence that the presence of  albumoses assists in producing the foaming properties of beer. It has now  been established definitely, by the work of A. Fernbach, W. Windisch,  F.Weiss and P. Schidrowitz, that finished malt contains at least two  proteolytic enzymes (a peptic and a pancreatic enzyme).    [Illustration: BREWING    PLATE I.

Hubert, and by P.E. Petit and G.  Labourasse. The number of enzymes which are now known to take part in the  brewing process is very large. They may with utility be grouped "]]]
