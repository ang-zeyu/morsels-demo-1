The  moment his head was turned away, I stretched out my arm. Scarcely a  leaf moved with the motion, yet he whirled like a flash and crouched  to spring, his eyes glaring straight into mine with an intensity that  I could scarce endure. Perhaps I was mistaken, but in that swift  instant the hard glare in his eyes seemed to soften with fear, as he  recognized me as the one thing in the wilderness that dared to hunt  him, the king. My hand touched him fair on the shoulder; then he shot  into the air, and went sweeping in great circles over the tree-tops,  still looking down at the man, wondering and fearing at the way in  which he had been brought into the man's power.    But one thing he did not understand. Standing erect on the log, and  looking up at him as he swept over me, I kept thinking, \"I did it, I  did it, Cheplahgan, old Cloud Wings. And I had grabbed your legs, and  pinned you down, and tied you in a bag, and brought you to camp, but  that I chose to let you go free. And that is better than shooting you.  Now I shall find your little ones and touch them too.\"    For several days I had been watching Old Whitehead's lines of flight,  and had concluded that his nest was somewhere in the hills northwest  of the big lake. I went there one afternoon, and while confused in the  big timber, which gave no outlook in any direction, I saw, not Old  Whitehead, but a larger eagle, his mate undoubtedly, flying straight  westward with food towards a great cliff, that I had noticed with my  glass one day from a mountain on the other side of the lake.    When I went there, early next morning, it was Cheplahgan himself who  showed me where his nest was. I was hunting along the foot of the  cliff when, glancing back towards the lake, I saw him coming far  away, and hid in the underbrush. He passed very near, and following, I  saw him standing on a ledge near the top of the cliff. Just below him,  in the top of a stunted tree growing out of the face of the rock was a  huge mass of sticks that formed the nest, with a great mother-eagle  standing by, feeding the little ones. Both birds started away silently  when I appeared, but came back soon and swept back and forth over me,  as I sat watching the nest and the face of the cliff through my glass.  No need now of caution. Both birds seemed to know instinctively why I  had come, and that the fate of the eaglets lay in my hands if I could  but scale the cliff.    It was scaring business, that three-hundred-foot climb up the sheer  face of the mountain. Fortunately the rock was seamed and scarred with  the wear of centuries; bushes and stunted trees grew out of countless  crevices, which gave me sure footing, and sometimes a lift of a dozen  feet or more on my way up. As I climbed, the eagles circled lower and  lower; the strong rustling of their wings was about my head  continually; they seemed to grow larger, fiercer, every moment, as my  hold grew more precarious, and the earth and the pointed tree-tops  dropped farther below. There was a good revolver in my pocket, to use  in case of necessity; but had the great birds attacked me I should  have fared badly, for at times I was obliged to grip hard with both  hands, my face to the cliff, leaving the eagles free to strike from  above and behind. I think now that had I shown fear in such a place,  or shouted, or tried to fray them away, they would have swooped upon  me, wing and claw, like furies. I could see it in their fierce eyes as  I looked up. But the thought of the times when I had hunted him, and  especially the thought of that time when I had reached out of the  bushes and touched him, was upon Old Whitehead and made him fear. So I  kept steadily on my way, apparently giving no thought to the eagles,  though deep inside I was anxious enough, and reached the foot of the  tree in which the nest was made.    I stood there a long time, my arm clasping the twisted old boll,  looking out over the forest spread wide below, partly to regain  courage, partly to reassure the eagles, which were circling very near  with a kind of intense wonder in their eyes, but chiefly to make up my  mind what to do next. The tree was easy to climb, but the nest--a huge  affair, which had been added to year after year--filled the whole  tree-top, and I could gain no foothold, from which to look over and  see the eaglets, without tearing the nest to pieces. I did not want to  do that, and I doubted whether the mother-eagle would stand it. A  dozen times she seemed on the point of dropping on my head to tear it  with her talons; but always she veered off as I looked up quietly, and  Old Whitehead, with the mark of my bullet strong upon him, swept  between her and me and seemed to say, \"Wait, wait. I don't understand;  but he can kill us if he will--and the little ones are in his power.\"  Now he was closer to me than ever, and the fear was vanishing. But so  also was the fierceness.    From the foot of the tree the crevice in which it grew led upwards to  the right, then doubled back to the ledge above the nest, upon which  Cheplahgan was standing when I discovered him. The lip of this crevice  made a dizzy path that one might follow by moving crabwise, his face  to the cliff, with only its roughnesses to cling to with his fingers.  I tried it at last, crept up and out twenty feet, and back ten, and  dropped with a great breath of relief to a broad ledge covered with  bones and fish scales, the relics of many a savage feast. Below me,  almost within reach, was the nest, with two dark, scraggly young birds  resting on twigs and grass, with fish, flesh and fowl in a gory,  skinny, scaly ring about them--the most savage-looking household into  which I ever looked unbidden.    But even as I looked and wondered, and tried to make out what other  game had been furnished the young savages I had helped to feed, a  strange thing happened, which touched me as few things ever have among  the wild creatures. The eagles had followed me close along the last  edge of rock, hoping no doubt in their wild hearts that I would slip,  and end their troubles, and give my body as food to the young. Now, as  I sat on the ledge, peering eagerly into the nest, the great  mother-bird left me and hovered over her eaglets, as if to shield them  with her wings from even the sight of my eyes. But Old Whitehead still  circled over me. Lower he came, and lower, till with a supreme effort  of daring he folded his wings and dropped to the ledge beside me,  within ten feet, and turned and looked into my eyes. \"See,\" he seemed  to say, \"we are within reach again. You touched me once; I don't know  how or why. Here I am now, to touch or to kill, as you will; only  spare the little ones.\"    A moment later the mother-bird dropped to the edge of the nest. And  there we sat, we three, with the wonder upon us all, the young eagles  at our feet, the cliff above, and, three hundred feet below, the  spruce tops of the wilderness reaching out and away to the mountains  beyond the big lake. I sat perfectly still, which is the only way to  reassure a wild creature; and soon I thought Cheplahgan had lost his  fear in his anxiety for the little ones. But the moment I rose to go  he was in the air again, circling restlessly above my head with his  mate, the same wild fierceness in his eyes as he looked down. A  half-hour later I had gained the top of the cliff and started eastward  towards the lake, coming down by a much easier way than that by which  I went up. Later I returned several times, and from a distance watched  the eaglets being fed. But I never climbed to the nest again.    One day, when I came to the little thicket on the cliff where I used  to lie and watch the nest through my glass, I found that one eaglet  was gone. The other stood on the edge of the nest, looking down  fearfully into the abyss, whither, no doubt, his bolder nest mate had  flown, and calling disconsolately from time to time. His whole  attitude showed plainly that he was hungry and cross and lonesome.  Presently the mother-eagle came swiftly up from the valley, and there  was food in her talons. She came to the edge of the nest, hovered over  it a moment, so as to give the hungry eaglet a sight and smell of  food, then went slowly down to the valley, taking the food with her,  telling the little one in her own way to come and he should have it.  He called after her loudly from the edge of the nest, and spread his  wings a dozen times to follow. But the plunge was too awful; his heart  failed him; and he settled back in the nest, and pulled his head down  into his shoulders, and shut his eyes, and tried to forget that he was  hungry. The meaning of the little comedy was plain enough. She was  trying to teach him to fly, telling him that his wings were grown and  the time was come to use them; but he was afraid.    In a little while she came back again, this time without food, and  hovered over the nest, trying every way to induce the little one to  leave it. She succeeded at last, when with a desperate effort he  sprang upward and flapped to the ledge above, where I had sat and  watched him with Old Whitehead. Then, after surveying the world  gravely from his new place, he flapped back to the nest, and turned a  deaf ear to all his mother's assurances that he could fly just as  easily to the tree-tops below, if he only would.    Suddenly, as if discouraged, she rose well above him. I held my  breath, for I knew what was coming. The little fellow stood on the  edge of the nest, looking down at the plunge which he dared not take.  There was a sharp cry from behind, which made him alert, tense as a  watch-spring. The next instant the mother-eagle had swooped, striking  the nest at his feet, sending his support of twigs and himself with  them out into the air together.    He was afloat now, afloat on the blue air in spite of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15955"],[0,"A Short History of Scotland (#14)"],[1,"by Henry VIII., Mary, of the great Catholic house of Lorraine, widow of  the Duc de Longueville, and sister of the popular and ambitious Guises.  The pair were wedded on June 10, 1538; there was fresh offence to Henry  and a closer tie to the Catholic cause.  The appointment of Cardinal  Beaton (1539) to the see of St Andrews, in succession to his uncle, gave  James a servant of high ecclesiastical rank, great subtlety, and  indomitable resolution, but remote from chastity of life and from  clemency to heretics.  Martyrdoms became more frequent, and George  Buchanan, who had been tutor of James's son by Margaret Erskine, thought  well to open a window in a house where he was confined, walk out, and  depart to the Continent.  Meanwhile Henry, no less than Beaton, was  busily burning his own martyrs.  In 1539 Henry renewed his intercourse  with James, attempting to shake his faith in David Beaton, and to make  him rob his Church.  James replied that he preferred to try to reform it;  and he enjoyed, in 1540, Sir David Lyndsay's satirical play on the vices  of the clergy, and, indeed, of all orders of men.  In 1540 James ratified  the College of Justice, the fifteen Lords of Session, sitting as judges  in Edinburgh.    In 1541 the idea of a meeting between James and Henry was again mooted,  and Henry actually went to York, where James did not appear.  Henry, who  had expected him, was furious.  In August 1542, on a futile pretext, he  sent Norfolk with a great force to harry the Border.  The English had the  worse at the battle of Hadden Rig; negotiations followed; Henry  proclaimed that Scottish kings had always been vassals of England, and  horrified his Council by openly proposing to kidnap James.  Henry's  forces were now wrecking an abbey and killing women on the Border.  James  tried to retaliate, but his levies (October 31) at Fala Moor declined to  follow him across the Border: they remembered Flodden, moreover they  could not risk the person of a childless king.  James prepared, however,  for a raid on a great scale on the western Border, but the fact had been  divulged by Sir George Douglas, Angus's brother, and had also been sold  to Dacre, cheap, by another Scot.  The English despatches prove that  Wharton had full time for preparation, and led a competent force of  horse, which, near Arthuret, charged on the right flank of the Scots, who  slowly retreated, till they were entangled between the Esk and a morass,  and lost their formation and their artillery, with 1200 men: a few were  slain, most were drowned or were taken prisoners.  The raid was no secret  of the king and the priests, as Knox absurdly states; nobles of the  Reforming no less than of the Catholic party were engaged; the English  had full warning and a force of 3000 men, not of 400 farmers; the Scots  were beaten through their own ignorance of the ground in which they had  been burning and plundering.  As to confusion caused by the claim of  Oliver Sinclair to be commander, it is not corroborated by contemporary  despatches, though Sir George Douglas reports James's lament for the  conduct of his favourite, \"Fled Oliver! fled Oliver!\"  The misfortune  broke the heart of James.  He went to Edinburgh, did some business,  retired for a week to Linlithgow, {89} where his queen was awaiting her  delivery, and thence went to Falkland, and died of nothing more specific  than shame, grief, and despair.  He lived to hear of the birth of his  daughter, Mary (December 8, 1542).  \"It came with a lass and it will go  with a lass,\" he is said to have muttered.    On December 14th James passed away, broken by his impossible task, lost  in the bewildering paths from which there was no outgait.    James was personally popular for his gaiety and his adventures while he  wandered in disguise.  Humorous poems are attributed to him.  A man of  greater genius than his might have failed when confronted by a tyrant so  wealthy, ambitious, cruel, and destitute of honour as Henry VIII.;  constantly engaged with James's traitors in efforts to seize or slay him  and his advisers.  It is an easy thing to attack James because he would  not trust Henry, a man who ruined all that did trust to his seeming  favour.          CHAPTER XVI.  THE MINORITY OF MARY STUART.      When James died, Henry VIII. seemed to hold in his hand all the winning  cards in the game of which Scotland was the stake.  He held Angus and his  brother George Douglas; when he slipped them they would again wield the  whole force of their House in the interests of England and of Henry's  religion.  Moreover, he held many noble prisoners taken at  Solway--Glencairn, Maxwell, Cassilis, Fleming, Grey, and others,--and all  of these, save Sir George Douglas, \"have not sticked,\" says Henry  himself, \"to take upon them to set the crown of Scotland on our head.\"  Henry's object was to get \"the child, the person of the Cardinal, and of  such as be chief hindrances to our purpose, and also the chief holds and  fortresses into our hands.\"  By sheer brigandage the Reformer king hoped  to succeed where the Edwards had failed.  He took the oaths of his  prisoners, making them swear to secure for him the child, Beaton, and the  castles, and later released them to do his bidding.    Henry's failure was due to the genius and resolution of Cardinal Beaton,  heading the Catholic party.    What occurred in Scotland on James's death is obscure.  Later, Beaton was  said to have made the dying king's hand subscribe a blank paper filled up  by appointment of Beaton himself as one of a Regency Council of four or  five.  There is no evidence for the tale.  What actually occurred was the  proclamation of the Earls of Arran, Argyll, Huntly, Moray, and of Beaton  as Regents (December 19, 1542).  Arran, the chief of the Hamiltons, was,  we know, unless ousted by Henry VIII., the next heir to the throne after  the new-born Mary.  He was a good-hearted man, but the weakest of  mortals, and his constant veerings from the Catholic and national to the  English and reforming side were probably caused by his knowledge of his  very doubtful legitimacy.  Either party could bring up the doubt; Beaton,  having the ear of the Pope, could be specially dangerous, but so could  the opposite party if once firmly seated in office.  Arran, in any case,  presently ousted the Archbishop of Glasgow from the Chancellorship and  gave the seals to Beaton--the man whom he presently accused of a  shameless forgery of James's will. {91}    The Regency soon came into Arran's own hands: the Solway Moss prisoners,  learning this as they journeyed north, began to repent of their oaths of  treachery, especially as their oaths were known or suspected in Scotland.  George Douglas prevailed on Arran to seize and imprison Beaton till he  answered certain charges; but no charges were ever made public, none were  produced.  The clergy refused to christen or bury during his captivity.  Parliament met (March 12, 1543), and still there was silence as to the  nature of the accusations against Beaton; and by March 22 George Douglas  himself released the Cardinal (of course for a consideration) and carried  him to his own strong castle of St Andrews.    Parliament permitted the reading but forbade the discussion of the Bible  in English.  Arran was posing as a kind of Protestant.  Ambassadors were  sent to Henry to negotiate a marriage between his son Edward and the baby  Queen; but Scotland would not give up a fortress, would never resign her  independence, would not place Mary in Henry's hands, would never submit  to any but a native ruler.    The airy castle of Henry's hopes fell into dust, built as it was on the  oaths of traitors.  Love of such a religion as Henry professed, retaining  the Mass and making free use of the stake and the gibbet, was not, even  to Protestants, so attractive as to make them run the English course and  submit to the English Lord Paramount.  Some time was needed to make  Scots, whatever their religious opinions, lick the English rod.  But the  scale was soon to turn; for every reforming sermon was apt to produce the  harrying of religious houses, and every punishment of the robbers was  persecution intolerable against which men sought English protection.    Henry VIII. now turned to Arran for support.  To Arran he offered the  hand of his daughter, the Princess Elizabeth, who should later marry the  heir of the Hamiltons.  But by mid-April Arran was under the influence of  his bastard brother, the Abbot of Paisley (later Archbishop Hamilton).  The Earl of Lennox, a Stuart, and Keeper of Dumbarton Castle, arrived  from France.  He was hostile to Arran; for, if Arran were illegitimate,  Lennox was next heir to the crown after Mary: he was thus, for the  moment, the ally of Beaton against Arran.  George Douglas visited Henry,  and returned with his terms--Mary to be handed over to England at the age  of ten, and to marry Prince Edward at twelve; Arran (by a prior  arrangement) was to receive Scotland north of Forth, an auxiliary English  army, and the hand of Elizabeth for his son.  To the English contingent  Arran preferred 5000 pounds in ready money--that was his price.    Sadleyr, Henry's envoy, saw Mary of Guise, and saw her little daughter  unclothed; he admired the child, but could not disentangle the cross-webs  of intrigue.  The national party--the Catholic party--was strongest,  because least disunited.  When the Scottish ambassadors who went to Henry  in spring returned (July 21), the national party seized Mary and carried  her to Stirling, where they offered Arran a meeting, and (he said) the  child queen's hand for his son.  But Arran's own partisans, Glencairn and  Cassilis, told Sadleyr that he fabled freely.  Representatives of both  parties accepted Henry's terms, but delayed the ratification.  Henry  insisted that it should be ratified by August 24, but on August 16 he  seized six Scottish merchant ships.  Though the"]]]
