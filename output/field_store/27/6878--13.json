Training the  hand in the skilful use of the hammer is of the utmost importance and  comes only by continued practice, but when it is trained, one can  virtually \"feel\" the tones with the hammer.    At first, the young tuner is almost invariably discouraged by his slow  progress. He must remember that, however fine his ear and however  great his mechanical ability, he has much to acquire by training in  both, and he must expect to be two or three times longer in finishing  off a job of tuning at the outset than will be necessary after he has  had a few months' practice. You can be your own trainer in these  things if you will do a little rational thinking and be content to  \"hasten slowly.\" And as to using the left hand, we would not advise it  in any event.      SETTING THE MUTES OR WEDGES IN THE UPRIGHT.    As stated in a previous lesson, the mutes should be so placed that  only two strings are heard at one time: the one the tuner is tuning,  and the one he is tuning by. It is true that this is an easy matter,  but it is also true that very few tuners know how to do it in a way to  save time and avoid placing the mutes two or more times in the same  place. By using a little inventive genius during early practice the  author succeeded in formulating a system of muting by which he  accomplished the ends as stated above, and assures the reader that a  great deal of time can be saved by following it.    After removing the muffler or any other instrumental attachment which  may be in the piano in the way of placing the mutes, the first thing  to do is to place the continuous mute so that all the outside strings  of the trios are damped. The temperament is then set by tuning the  middle strings, of the twenty-five trios comprised in the two-octave  temperament as demonstrated in a previous lesson. After satisfying  yourself by trials or test that the temperament is true, you then  remove the continuous mute and proceed to bring the outside strings in  unison with the middle one. Now, your 1C is sometimes found to be the  first pair in the over-strung bass, which usually has two strings to a  key, while in other pianos, 1C is the first trio in the treble  stringing, and in many cases it is the second trio in the treble. For  illustration, we will say it is the second in the treble. In speaking  of the separate strings of a trio we will number them 1st, 2d, and 3d,  from left to right, as in foot-note, page 89, Lesson IX. Setting the  mutes in bringing up the unisons in the temperament is exceedingly  simple.    The following diagram will, we think, demonstrate clearly the method  employed:    Upper row----  o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o    Tim-    Middle row---   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   ing    Lower row----    o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o   o  Pins.               ------------------------------------------ Bridge.                 * 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 * &c             /// /// /// /// /// /// /// /// /// ///    Treble stringing.             B   C  C[#] D  D[#] E   F  F[#] G  G[#] &c    The upper row of O's represents the upper row of tuning pins. To these  are attached the first string of each unison. To the middle row are  attached the second or middle strings, and to the lower row are  attached the third strings. The diagonal lines represent the three  strings of the unison (trio). The asterisk on the middle one indicates  that it has been tuned.    But one mute is used in tuning these unisons. It is inserted between  the trios in the order indicated by the figures 1, 2, 3, etc. When  inserted in place 1, between unisons B and C, it will mute the first  string of C; so the first string of the trio to tune is always the  third. Then place your mute in place 2 and tune the first string of C.  Then, without moving your mute, bring up third string of C[#], then  third string of D and so on. By this method, you tune two strings  every time you reset your mute.    When through with the temperament, the next step is usually that of  tuning the bass; but while we are in the treble we will proceed to  give the method of setting the mutes in the upper treble beyond the  temperament. All three strings have yet to be tuned here, and we have  to use two mutes. The unisons are tuned in regular succession upward  the same as in the example above. The mute that is kept farthest to  the left, is indicated by the letter A, and the one kept to the right,  by the letter B, as in diagram below.    (T e m p e r a m e n t )   1   2   3   4   5   6   7    &c.   *** *** *** *** *** ***   A   B  /// /// /// /// /// /// /// /// /// /// /// /// /// ///                             C[#] D  D[#] E   F  [F#] G   &c.    The mutes are first placed in the places indicated by the figures 1  and 2, thereby muting first and third strings of the first unison  beyond the temperament, which is 3C[#]. The middle string of this  unison is now tuned by its octave below. (If you have left imperfect  unisons in your temperament, rendering it difficult to tune octaves by  them, it will be well to replace your continuous mute so as to tune  from a single string.) Having tuned the middle string of C[#], move  mute B to place 3 and tune third string of C[#]. Then, move mute A to  place 2 and tune first string of C[#]. Your mutes are now already set  for tuning the middle string of D. After this is done, proceed to move  mute B first, then mute A; tuning middle string, then third, then  first, moving step by step as indicated in example above until the  last unison is reached. By this system you tune three strings every  time the mutes are set twice.    The over-strung bass usually has but two strings to a unison and only  one mute is needed. In the extreme low or contra-bass, pianos have but  one string, in tuning which the mute is discarded. Set the mute as  indicated by the figures 1, 2, 3, etc., in the diagram below, always  tuning the string farthest to the right by its octave above; then move  the mute to its next place and tune the left string by the right.  Here, again, you tune two strings every time you reset your mute. The  I's represent bass strings.                              9    8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1  I   I   I   I   I   I   I   II   II   II   II   II   II   II   II   II                      C  C[#] D   D[#]  E    F   F[#]  G   G[#]  A   A[#]  B  C   Contra-Bass.                              Bass.                        Treble.      SETTING THE MUTES IN THE SQUARE PIANO.    In setting the temperament in the square piano, simply mute the string  farthest to the left and tune the one to the right until the  temperament is finished, then set the mutes in the bass the same as in  the upright. In tuning the treble, if the piano has three strings, the  same system is used as has been described for the upright. When the  piano has but two strings to a unison, as is usually the case, employ  the system described for the bass of the upright, but reversed, as you  are proceeding to the right instead of to the left.    Remove the shade before beginning to tune a square piano, and if  necessary, lay the dampers back and trace the strings to their pins so  as to mark them. Certain pins are marked to guide the tuner in placing  his hammer. The way we have always marked them is as follows:    Mark both pins of each pair of C strings with white crayon. Mark only  one pin of each pair of G's. Knowing the intervals of the other keys  from the marked ones, you can easily calculate correctly, upon which  pin to set your hammer to tune any string desired. For instance, if  you are striking D[#], next above middle C, you calculate that, as  D[#] is the third chromatic interval from middle C, you are to set the  hammer on one or the other of the pins belonging to the third pair to  the right of the pair marked as middle C. B would be first pair to the  left, F[#] would be first pair to the left of the marked G, and so on.  It is usually necessary to mark only those pairs near the middle of  the piano, but we advise the beginner to mark throughout the scale, as  by so doing he may avoid breaking a string occasionally by pulling on  some other than the one he is sounding. This will occur in your early  practice if you do not use caution. And for safety, some tuners always  mark throughout.      QUESTIONS ON LESSON XI.        1. By what means is the tuner enabled to make the strings draw      through the bridges and equalize the tension throughout their      entire length?        2.

Do not write so near the margins of the paper that the binder will cut  off the writing when he comes to trim them.          CHAPTER XII.    \"HOW TO DO IT.\"      The following advice by Rev. Edward Everett Hale is so good that I have  appropriated it. You will find more good advice in the same book.[27]              \"First, never walk before breakfast. If you like            you may make two breakfasts, and take a mile or            two between; but be sure to eat something before            you are on the road.              \"Second, do not walk much in the middle of the            day. It is dusty and hot then; and the landscape            has lost its special glory. By ten o'clock you            ought to have found some camping-ground for the            day,--a nice brook running through a grove; a            place to draw, or paint, or tell stories, or read            them or write them; a place to make waterfalls and            dams, to sail chips, or build boats; a place to            make a fire and a cup of tea for the oldsters.            Stay here till four in the afternoon, and then            push on in the two or three hours which are left            to the sleeping-place agreed upon. Four or five            hours on the road is all you want in each day.            Even resolute idlers, as it is to be hoped you all            are on such occasions, can get eight miles a day            out of that; and that is enough for a true            walking-party. Remember all along that you are not            running a race with the railway-train. If you            were, you would be beaten certainly; and the less            you think you are, the better. You are travelling            in a method of which the merit is that it is not            fast, and that you see every separate detail of            the glory of the world. What a fool you are, then,            if you tire yourself to death, merely that you may            say that you did in ten hours what the locomotive            would gladly have finished in one, if by that            effort you have lost exactly the enjoyment of            nature and society that you started for!\"    The advice to rest in the heat of the day is good for very hot weather;  young people, however, are too impatient to follow it unless there is an  apparent necessity. The feeling at twelve o'clock that you have yet to  walk as far as you have come is not so pleasant as that of knowing you  have all the afternoon for rest. For this reason nearly every one will  finish the walk as soon as possible; still Mr. Hale's plan is a good  one--the best for very hot weather.      STILL ANOTHER WAY TO TRAVEL.    Mr. Hale also tells an amusing story of his desire when young to sail  down the Connecticut River; but he was dissuaded from doing so when the  chance finally came, by people who thought the road was the only place  to travel in. And now he is sorry he did not sail.    The reading of his story brings to mind a similar experience that I had  when young, and it is now one of the keen regrets of my manhood, that I  likewise was laughed out of a boyish plan that would have given me  untold pleasure and profit had it been carried out. I loved to walk, and  I wanted to see the towns within a circuit of twenty or thirty miles of  home; but I could not afford to pay hotel-bills, and I was not strong  enough to carry a camping-outfit. But I had an old cart, strong and  large enough to hold all I should need. I could load it with the same  food that I should eat if I staid at home; could wear my old clothes,  take my oilcloth overcoat, an axe, frying-pan, pail, and a borrowed tent  and poles; and I would learn the county by heart before vacation was  over, and not cost my father a cent more than if I staid at home. Oh,  why didn't I go! Simply because I was laughed out of it. I was told that  people did not travel in that way; I should be arrested; the boys would  hoot at and stone me; the men would set their dogs on me; I should be  driven out of my camping-place; thieves would steal my seventy-five cent  cart; dogs would eat up my stock of food; and the first man who overtook  me would tell the people that a crazy boy from Portland was coming along  the road dragging a baby-wagon, whereupon every woman would leave her  kitchen, and every man his field, to see and laugh at me. But, above  all, the thing would be known in our neighborhood, and the boys and  girls would join in their abuse of the county explorer.    That was the end of it; the being made sport of by _my own friends_, and  hearing the _small boys in our street_ sing out \"How's your cart?\" and  to be known all through life perhaps as \"_one-horse John_\"--the  punishment would be too severe.    But, my young friends, I made a great mistake; and I want to caution you  _not_ to surrender to any such nonsense as I did. If you wish to go to  sea in a skiff, it is well to give in to a fisherman's advice to stay at  home, for he can assure you that winds and waves will be the death of  you; but if you have a good hand-wagon, and are willing to stand a few  taunts, by all means go on your walk, and pull your wagon after you. You  will learn a lesson in independence that will be of value to you, if you  learn nothing else.    FOOTNOTES:    [27] How to Do It. Published by Roberts Brothers, Boston.          CHAPTER XIII.    HYGIENIC NOTES.              [This chapter is taken in full from a work on            ornithology, written by Dr. Coues of the            Smithsonian Institution. It is the advice of an            accomplished naturalist and sportsman to his            fellow-naturalists, but is equally adapted to the            young camper. Hardly any one can write more            understandingly on the subjects here presented            than the doctor, who has had long experience with            the army, both in the field and garrison, and is            an enthusiastic student of natural history            besides. The remarks upon alcoholic stimulants are            especially recommended to the reader, coming as            they do from an army officer, and not a temperance            reformer.              Those who wish to become familiar with the details            of bird-collecting will find a treasure in the            doctor's book, \"Field Ornithology, comprising a            Manual of Instruction for procuring, preparing,            and preserving Birds; and a check list of North            American Birds. By Dr. Elliott Coues, U.S.A.            Salem: Naturalists' Agency.\"]      ACCIDENTS.    The secret of safe _climbing_ is never to relax one hold until another  is secured; it is in spirit equally applicable to scrambling over rocks,  a particularly difficult thing to do safely with a loaded gun. Test  rotten, slippery, or otherwise suspicious holds, before trusting them.  In lifting the body up anywhere, keep the mouth shut, breathe through  the nostrils, and go slowly.    In _swimming_ waste no strength unnecessarily in trying to stem a  current; yield partly, and land obliquely lower down; if exhausted,  float: the slightest motion of the hands will ordinarily keep the face  above water; in any event keep your wits collected. In fording deeply, a  heavy stone [in the hands, above water] will strengthen your position.    Never sail a boat experimentally: if you are no sailor, take one with  you, or stay on land.    In crossing a high narrow foot-path, never look lower than your feet;  the muscles will work true if not confused with faltering instructions  from a giddy brain. On soft ground see what, if any thing, has preceded  you; large hoof-marks generally mean that the way is safe: if none are  found, inquire for yourself before going on. Quicksand is the most  treacherous because far more dangerous than it looks; but I have seen a  mule's ears finally disappear in genuine mud.    Cattle-paths, however erratic, commonly prove the surest way out of a  difficult place, whether of uncertain footing or dense undergrowth.      \"TAKING COLD.\"    This vague \"household word\" indicates one or more of a long varied train  of unpleasant affections nearly always traceable to one or the other of  only two causes,--_sudden change_ of temperature, and _unequal  distribution_ of temperature. No extremes of heat or cold can alone  affect this result: persons frozen to death do not \"take cold\" during  the process. But if a part of the body be rapidly cooled, as by  evaporation from a wet article of clothing, or by sitting in a draught  of air, the rest of the body remaining at an ordinary temperature; or if  the temperature of the whole be suddenly changed by going out into the  cold, or especially by coming into a warm room,--there is much liability  of trouble.    There is an old saying,--              \"When the air comes through a hole,             Say your prayers to save your soul.\"    And I should think almost any one could get a \"cold\" with a spoonful of  water on the wrist held to a key-hole. Singular as it may seem, sudden  warming when cold is more dangerous than the reverse: every one has  noticed how soon the handkerchief is required on entering a heated room  on a cold day. Frost-bite is an extreme illustration of this. As the  Irishman said on picking himself up, it was not the fall, but stopping  so quickly, that hurt him: it is not the lowering of the temperature to  freezing point, but its subsequent elevation, that devitalizes the  tissue. This is why rubbing with snow, or bathing in cold water, is  required to restore safely a frozen part: the arrested circulation must  be"]]]
