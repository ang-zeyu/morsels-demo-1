[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18274"],[0,"A Book of Natural History (#14)"],[1,"on: CENTIPEDE.]    All those found in the Northern States are perfectly harmless, the  true centipede, whose bite is reputed much more venomous than it  really is, being found only in the South. True, some of the centipede  group can pinch rather sharply with their beetle-like jaws; and one,  our largest and most common species, a brownish red fellow about three  inches long and without eyes, can even draw blood if its jaws happen  to strike a tender place. When handled it always tries to bite,  perhaps out of revenge for the abominably long Latin name given it by  its describer. In fact the name is longer than the animal  itself--_Sco-lo-po-cryp-tops sex-spi-no-sus_ (Say)--being its cognomen  in full. With such a handle attached to it, who can blame it for  attempting to bite? Yet, to the scientist up on his Latin, each part  of the above name bears a definite and tangible meaning. All the  myriapods found in the woods and fields feed upon decaying vegetation,  such as leaves, stems of weeds, and rotten wood, and in winter three  or four species can usually be found within or beneath every decaying  log or stump. One species with very long legs, _Scutigera forceps_  (Raf.), is often found in damp houses or in cellars. It is sometimes  called the \"wall-sweeper,\" on account of its rapid ungainly gait, and  is even reputed to prey upon cockroaches and other household pests.    Spiders, which do not undergo such changes as do most of the common,  six-footed insects, winter either as eggs or in the mature form. The  members of the \"sedentary\" or web-spinning group, as a rule, form  nests in late autumn, in each of which are deposited from fifty to  eighty eggs, which survive the winter and hatch in the spring, as soon  as the food supply of gnats, flies, and mosquitoes appear. The  different forms of spiders' nests are very interesting objects of  study. Some are those close-spun, flat, button-shaped objects, about  half an inch in diameter, which are so common in winter on the under  side of bark, chunks and flat rocks. Others are balloon-shaped and  attached to weeds. Within the latter the young spiders often hatch in  early winter, make their first meal off their empty egg cases, and  then begin a struggle for existence, the stronger preying upon the  weaker until the south winds blow again, when they emerge and scatter  far and wide in search of more nutritious sustenance.    The \"wandering\" spiders never spin webs, but run actively about and  pounce upon their prey with a tiger-like spring. Six or eight of the  larger species of this group winter in the mature form beneath logs  and chunks, being often frozen solid during cold weather, but thawing  out as healthy as ever when the temperature rises. Retiring beneath  the loose-fitting bark of hickory or maple trees, a number of the  smaller tube-weaving spiders construct about themselves a protecting  web of many layers of the finest silk. Within this snug retreat they  lie from November until April--a handsome, small, black fellow, with  green jaws and two orange spots on his abdomen, being the most common  species found motionless within this seeming shroud of silk on a day  in mid-winter.    In any Northern State as many as four hundred different kinds of the  six-footed or true insects, in the winged or adult stage, may be taken  in winter by any one who is so disposed, and knows where to search for  them. Among the _Orthoptera_, the \"grouse grasshoppers\" live during  the cold season beneath the loose bark of logs, or beneath the bottom  rails of the old Virginia worm fences. From these retreats every warm,  sunny day tempts them forth in numbers. On such occasions the earth  seems to swarm with them, as they leap before the intruder, their hard  bodies striking the dead leaves with a sound similar to that produced  by falling hail. The common field cricket belongs also to the  _Orthoptera_, and the young of various sizes winter under rails and  logs, bidding defiance to Jack Frost from within a little burrow or  pit beneath the protecting shelter.    [Illustration: CHINCH BUG.]    The true bugs, or _Hemiptera_, hibernate in similar places; squash  bugs, chinch bugs, \"stink\" bugs, and others being easily found in  numbers beneath loose bark or hidden between the root leaves of  mullein and other plants.    Nearly three hundred species of _Coleoptera_, or beetles, occupy  similar positions. Almost any rotten log or stump when broken open  discloses a half dozen or more \"horn\" or \"bess beetles,\" _Passalus  cornutus_ L., great, shining, clumsy, black fellows with a curved horn  on the head. They are often utilized as horses by country children,  the horn furnishing an inviting projection to which may be fastened,  by a thread or cord, chips and pieces of bark to be dragged about by  the strong and never lagging beast of burden. When tired of \"playing  horse\" they can make of the insect an instrument of music; for, when  held by the body, it emits a creaking, hissing noise, produced by  rubbing the abdomen up and down against the inside of the hard, horny  wing covers. This beetle passes its entire life in cavities in the  rotten wood on which it feeds, and when it wishes a larger or more  commodious home it has only to eat the more.    [Illustration: THIRTEEN-SPOTTED LADY BEETLE.]    The handsome and beneficial lady beetles winter beneath fallen leaves  or between and beneath the root leaves of the mullein and the thistle.  Our most common species, the thirteen-spotted lady beetle, _Megilla  maculata_ De G., is gregarious, collecting together by thousands on  the approach of cold weather, and lying huddled up like sheep until a  breath of spring gives them the signal to disperse. Snout beetles  galore can be found beneath piles of weeds near streams and the  borders of ponds or beneath chunks and logs in sandy places. All are  injurious, and the farmer by burning their hibernating places in  winter can cause their destruction in numbers. Rove beetles, ground  beetles, and many others live deep down in the vegetable mould beneath  old logs, where they are, no doubt, as secure from the ice king as if  they followed the swallow to the tropics.    Of the _Diptera_, or flies, but few forms winter in the perfect state,  yet the myriads of house flies and their kin, which next summer will  distract the busy house-wife, are represented in winter by a few  isolated individuals which creep forth occasionally from crevice or  cranny and greet us with a friendly buzz.    In mid-winter one may also see in the air swarms of small, gnat-like  insects. They belong to this order and live beneath the bark of  freshly fallen beech and other logs. On warm, sunny days they go forth  in numbers for a sort of rhythmical courtship; their movements while  in the air being peculiar in that they usually rise and fall in the  same vertical line--performing a curious aerial dance which is long  continued.    Among the dozen or more butterflies and moths which winter in the  perfect state, the most common and the most handsome is the  \"Camberwell beauty\" or \"mourning cloak,\" _Vanessa antiopa_ L., a large  butterfly whose wings are a rich purplish brown above, duller beneath,  and broadly margined with a yellowish band. It is often found in  winter beneath chunks which are raised a short distance above the  ground, or in the crevices of old snags and fence rails. It is then  apparently lifeless, with the antennae resting close along the back,  above which the wings are folded. But one or two warm days are  necessary to restore it to activity, and I have seen it on the wing as  early as the 2d of March, hovering over the open flowers of the little  snow trillium.    All the species of ants survive the winter as mature forms, either in  their nests in the ground or huddled groups in half rotten logs and  stumps; while here and there beneath logs a solitary queen bumble-bee,  bald hornet, or yellow jacket is found--the sole representatives of  their races.    Thus insects survive the winter in many ways and in many places, some  as eggs, others as larvae, still others as pupae, and a large number as  adults--all being able to withstand severe cold and yet retain  vitality sufficient to recover, live, grow, and replenish the earth  with their progeny when the halcyon days of spring appear once more.    In the scale of animal life the vertebrates or back-boned animals  succeed the insects. Beginning with the fishes, we find that in late  autumn they mostly seek some deep pool in pond or stream at the bottom  of which the water does not freeze. Here the herbivorous forms eke out  a precarious existence by feeding upon the innumerable diatoms and  other small plants which are always to be found in water, while the  carnivorous prey upon the herbivorous, and so maintain the struggle  for existence. The moving to these deeper channels and pools in autumn  and the scattering in the spring of the assembly which has gathered  there constitute the so-called \"migration of fishes,\" which is far  from being so extensive and methodical as that practiced by the  migratory birds.    Many of the smaller species of fishes, upon leaving these winter  resorts, ascend small, clear brooks in large numbers for the purpose  of depositing their eggs; as, when hatched in such a place, the young  will be comparatively free from the attacks of the larger carnivorous  forms. Among the lowest vertebrate often found in numbers in early  spring in these meadow rills and brooks is the lamprey, _Ammocoetes  branchialis_ (L.), or \"lamper eel,\" as it is sometimes called. It has  a slender eel-like body, of a uniform leaden or blackish color, and  with seven purse-shaped gill openings on each side. The mouth is  fitted for sucking rather than biting, and with it they attach  themselves to the bodies of fishes and feed on their flesh, which they  scrape off with their rasp-like teeth.

Anthony, on the Charge of (#14)"],[1," in her behalf, and testified that he gave her such  advice, and that he gave it in good faith, believing that she had such  right.    It also appeared that when she offered to vote, the question whether as  a woman she had a right to vote, was raised by the inspectors, and  considered by them in her presence, and they decided that she had a  right to vote, and received her vote accordingly.    It was also shown on the part of the government, that on the examination  of the defendant before the commissioner, on whose warrant she was  arrested, she stated that she should have voted, if allowed to vote,  without reference to the advice she had received from the attorney whose  opinion she had asked; that she was not influenced to vote by that  opinion; that she had before determined to offer her vote, and had no  doubt about her right to vote.    At the close of the testimony the defendant's counsel proceeded to  address the jury, and stated that he desired to present for  consideration three propositions, two of law and one of fact:    First--That the defendant had a lawful right to vote.    Second--That whether she had a lawful right to vote or not, it she  honestly believed that she had that right and voted in good faith in  that belief, she was guilty of no crime.    Third--That when she gave her vote she gave it in good faith, believing  that it was her right to do so.    That the two first propositions presented questions for the Court to  decide, and the last for the jury.    When the counsel had proceeded thus far, the Court suggested that the  counsel had better discuss in the first place the questions of law;  which the counsel proceeded to do, and having discussed the two legal  questions at length, asked leave then to say a few words to the jury on  the question of fact. The Court then said to the counsel that he thought  that had better be left until the views of the Court upon the legal  questions should be made known.    The District Attorney thereupon addressed the Court at length upon the  legal questions, and at the close of his argument the Court delivered an  opinion adverse to the positions of the defendant's counsel upon both of  the legal questions presented, holding that the defendant was not  entitled to vote; and that if she voted in good faith in the belief in  fact that she had a right to vote, it would constitute no defense--the  grounds of the decision on the last point being that she was bound to  know that by law she was not a legal voter, and that even if she voted  in good faith in the contrary belief, it constituted no defense to the  crime with which she was charged. The decision of the Court upon these  questions was read from a written document.    At the close of the reading, the Court said that the decision of these  questions disposed of the case and left no question of fact for the  jury, and that he should therefore direct the jury to find a verdict of  guilty, and proceeded to say to the jury that the decision of the Court  had disposed of all there was in the case, and that he directed them to  find a verdict of guilty, and he instructed the clerk to enter a verdict  of guilty.    At this point, before any entry had been made by the clerk, the  defendant's counsel asked the Court to submit the case to the jury, and  to give to the jury the following several instructions:    First--That if the defendant, at the time of voting, believed that she  had a right to vote, and voted in good faith in that belief, she is not  guilty of the offence charged.    Second--In determining the question whether she did or did not believe  that she had a right to vote, the jury may take into consideration, as  bearing upon that question, the advice which she received from the  counsel to whom she applied.    Third--That they may also take into consideration as bearing upon the  same question, the fact that the inspectors considered the question, and  came to the conclusion that she had a right to vote.    Fourth--That the jury have a right to find a general verdict of guilty  or not guilty, as they shall believe that she has or has not been guilty  of the offense described in the statute.    The Court declined to submit the case to the jury upon any question  whatever, and directed them to render a verdict of guilty against the  defendant.    The defendant's counsel excepted to the decision of the Court upon the  legal questions to its refusal to submit the case to the jury: to its  refusal to give the instructions asked; and to its direction to the jury  to find a verdict of guilty against the defendant--the counsel insisting  that it was a direction which no Court had a right to give in a criminal  case.    The Court then instructed the clerk to take the verdict, and the clerk  said, \"Gentlemen of the jury, hearken to the verdict as the Court hath  recorded it. You say you find the defendant guilty of the offence  charged. So say you all.\"    No response whatever was made by the jury, either by word or sign. They  had not consulted together in their seats or otherwise. Neither of them  had spoken a word. Nor had they been asked whether they had or had not  agreed upon a verdict.    The defendant's counsel then asked that the clerk be requested to poll  the jury. The Court said, \"that cannot be allowed. Gentlemen of the  jury, you are discharged,\" and the jurors left the box. No juror spoke a  word during the trial, from the time they were impanelled to the time of  their discharge.    Now I respectfully submit, that in these proceedings the defendant has  been substantially denied her constitutional right of trial by jury. The  jurors composing the panel have been merely silent spectators of the  conviction of the defendant by the Court. They have had no more share in  her trial and conviction than any other twelve members of the jury  summoned to attend this Court, or any twelve spectators who have sat by  during the trial. If such course is allowable in this case, it must be  equally allowable in all criminal cases, whether the charge be for  treason, murder or any minor grade of offence which can come under the  jurisdiction of a United States court; and as I understand it, if  correct, substantially abolishes the right of trial by jury.    It certainly does so in all those cases, where the judge shall be of the  opinion that the facts which he may regard as clearly proved, lead  necessarily to the guilt of the defendant. Of course by refusing to  submit any question to the jury, the judge refuses to allow counsel to  address the jury in the defendant's behalf.    The constitutional provisions which I insist are violated by this  proceeding are the following:    Constitution of the United States, article 3, section 2. \"The trial of  all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury.\"    Amendments to Constitution, article 6. \"In all criminal prosecutions,  the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an  impartial jury of the State and District wherein the crime shall have  been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by  law; and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to  be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process  for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of  counsel for his defense.\"    In accordance with these provisions, I insist that in every criminal  case, where the party has pleaded not guilty, whether upon the trial the  guilt of such party appears to the Judge to be clear or not, the  response to the question, guilty or not guilty, must come from the jury,  must be their voluntary act, and cannot be imposed upon them by the  Court.    No opportunity has been given me to consult precedents on this subject,  but a friend has referred me to an authority strongly supporting my  position, from which I will quote, though I deem a reference to  precedents unnecessary to sustain the plain declarations of the  Constitution: I refer to the case of the _State vs. Shule_, (_10  Iredell, 153_,) the substance of which is stated in _2 Graham &  Waterman_ on New Trials, page 363. Before stating that case I quote from  the text of G. & W.         \"The verdict is to be the result of the deliberation of the jury       upon all the evidence in the case. The Court has no right to       anticipate the verdict by an expression of opinion calculated so to       influence the jury as to take from them their independence of       action.\"    In the _State vs. Shule_, two defendants were indicted for an affray.  \"The jury remaining out a considerable time, at the request of the  prosecuting attorney they were sent for by the Court. The Court then  charged them that although Jones, (the other defendant,) had first  commenced a battery upon Shule, yet, if the jury believed the evidence,  the defendant, Shule, was also guilty. Thereupon, one of the jurors  remarked that they had agreed to convict Jones, but were about to acquit  Shule. The Court then charged the jury again, and told them that they  could retire if they thought proper to do so. The jury consulted  together a few minutes in the Court room. The prosecuting attorney  directed the clerk to enter a verdict of guilty as to both defendants.  When the clerk had entered the verdict, the jury were asked to attend to  it, as it was about to be read by the clerk. The clerk then read the  verdict in the hearing of the jury. The jury, upon being requested, if  any of them disagreed to the verdict to make, it known by a nod, seemed  to express their unanimous assent; and no juror expressed his dissent.\"  In reviewing the case the Court say: \"The error complained of is, that  before the jury had announced their verdict, and in fact after they had  intimated an intention to acquit the defendant, Shule, the Court allowed  the clerk to be directed to enter a verdict finding him guilty, and  after the verdict was so entered,"]]]
