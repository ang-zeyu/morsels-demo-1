But the prohibition against the use of  animals for food was revoked in Noah's time, after the deluge.  Nevertheless, Adam was not cut off from the enjoyment of meat  dishes. Though he was not permitted to slaughter animals for the  appeasing of his appetite, the angels brought him meat and wine,  serving him like attendants.[56] And as the angels ministered to  his wants, so also the animals. They were wholly under his  dominion, and their food they took out of his hand and out of  Eve's.[57] In all respects, the animal world had a different  relation to Adam from their relation to his descendants. Not only  did they know the language of man,[58] but they respected the  image of God, and they feared the first human couple, all of  which changed into the opposite after the fall of man.[59]      THE FALL OF MAN    Among the animals the serpent was notable. Of all of them he had  the most excellent qualities, in some of which he resembled man.  Like man he stood upright upon two feet, and in height he was  equal to the camel. Had it not been for the fall of man, which  brought misfortune to them, too, one pair of serpents would have  sufficed to perform all the work man has to do, and, besides,  they would have supplied him with silver, gold, gems, and pearls.  As a matter of fact, it was the very ability of the serpent that  led to the ruin of man and his own ruin. His superior mental  gifts caused him to become an infidel. It likewise explains his  envy of man, especially of his conjugal relations. Envy made him  meditate ways and means of bringing about the death of Adam.[60]  He was too well acquainted with the character of the man to  attempt to exercise tricks of persuasion upon him, and he  approached the woman, knowing that women are beguiled easily. The  conversation with Eve was cunningly planned, she could not but be  caught in a trap. The serpent began, \"Is it true that God hath  said, Ye shall not eat of every tree in the garden?\" \"We may,\"  rejoined Eve, \"eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden,  except that which is in the midst of the garden, and that we may  not even touch, lest we be stricken with death.\" She spoke thus,  because in his zeal to guard her against the transgressing of the  Divine command, Adam had forbidden Eve to touch the tree, though  God had mentioned only the eating of the fruit. It remains a  truth, what the proverb says, \"Better a wall ten hands high that  stands, than a wall a hundred ells high that cannot stand.\" It  was Adam's exaggeration that afforded the serpent the possibility  of persuading Eve to taste of the forbidden fruit. The serpent  pushed Eve against the tree, and said: \"Thou seest that touching  the tree has not caused thy death. As little will it hurt thee to  eat the fruit of the tree. Naught but malevolence has prompted  the prohibition, for as soon as ye eat thereof, ye shall be as  God. As He creates and destroys worlds, so will ye have the power  to create and destroy. As He doth slay and revive, so will ye  have the power to slay and revive.[61] He Himself ate first of  the fruit of the tree, and then He created the world. Therefore  doth He forbid you to eat thereof, lest you create other worlds.  Everyone knows that 'artisans of the same guild hate one  another.' Furthermore, have ye not observed that every creature  hath dominion over the creature fashioned before itself? The  heavens were made on the first day, and they are kept in place by  the firmament made on the second day. The firmament, in turn, is  ruled by the plants, the creation of the third day, for they take  up all the water of the firmament. The sun and the other  celestial bodies, which were created on the fourth day, have  power over the world of plants. They can ripen their fruits and  flourish only through their influence. The creation of the fifth  day, the animal world, rules over the celestial spheres. Witness  the ziz, which can darken the sun with its pinions. But ye are  masters of the whole of creation, because ye were the last to be  created. Hasten now and eat of the fruit of the tree in the midst  of the garden, and become independent of God, lest He bring forth  still other creatures to bear rule over you.\"[62]    To give due weight to these words, the serpent began to shake the  tree violently and bring down its fruit. He ate thereof, saying:  \"As I do not die of eating the fruit, so wilt thou not die.\" Now  Eve could not but say to herself, \"All that my master\"--so she  called Adam--\"commanded me is but lies,\" and she determined to  follow the advice of the serpent.[63] Yet she could not bring  herself to disobey the command of God utterly. She made a  compromise with her conscience. First she ate only the outside  skin of the fruit, and then, seeing that death did not fell her,  she ate the fruit itself.[64] Scarce had she finished, when she  saw the Angel of Death before her. Expecting her end to come  immediately, she resolved to make Adam eat of the forbidden  fruit, too, lest he espouse another wife after her death.[65] It  required tears and lamentations on her part to prevail upon Adam  to take the baleful step. Not yet satisfied, she gave of the  fruit to all other living beings, that they, too, might be  subject to death.[66] All ate, and they all are mortal, with the  exception of the bird malham, who refused the fruit, with the  words: \"Is it not enough that ye have sinned against God, and  have brought death to others? Must ye still come to me and seek  to persuade me into disobeying God's command, that I may eat and  die thereof? I will not do your bidding.\" A heavenly voice was  heard then to say to Adam and Eve: \"To you was the command given.  Ye did not heed it; ye did transgress it, and ye did seek to  persuade the bird malham. He was steadfast, and he feared Me,  although I gave him no command. Therefore he shall never taste of  death, neither he nor his descendants--they all shall live  forever in Paradise.\"[67]    Adam spoke to Eve: \"Didst thou give me of the tree of which I  forbade thee to eat? Thou didst give me thereof, for my eyes are  opened, and the teeth in my mouth are set on edge.\" Eve made  answer, \"As my teeth were set on edge, so may the teeth of all  living beings be set on edge.\"[68] The first result was that Adam  and Eve became naked. Before, their bodies had been overlaid with  a horny skin, and enveloped with the cloud of glory. No sooner  had they violated the command given them than the cloud of glory  and the horny skin dropped from them, and they stood there in  their nakedness, and ashamed.[69] Adam tried to gather leaves  from the trees to cover part of their bodies, but he heard one  tree after the other say: \"There is the thief that deceived his  Creator. Nay, the foot of pride shall not come against me, nor  the hand of the wicked touch me. Hence, and take no leaves from  me!\" Only the fig-tree granted him permission to take of its  leaves. That was because the fig was the forbidden fruit itself.  Adam had the same experience as that prince who seduced one of  the maid-ser vants in the palace. When the king, his father,  chased him out, he vainly sought a refuge with the other  maid-servants, but only she who had caused his disgrace would  grant him assistance.[70]      THE PUNISHMENT    As long as Adam stood naked, casting about for means of escape  from his embarrassment, God did not appear unto him, for one  should not \"strive to see a man in the hour of his disgrace.\" He  waited until Adam and Eve had covered themselves with fig  leaves.[71] But even before God spoke to him, Adam knew what was  impending. He heard the angels announce, \"God betaketh Himself  unto those that dwell in Paradise.\" He heard more, too. He heard  what the angels were saying to one another about his fall, and  what they were saying to God. In astonishment the angels  exclaimed: \"What! He still walks about in Paradise? He is not yet  dead?\" Whereupon God: \"I said to him, 'In the day that thou  eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die!' Now, ye know not what  manner of day I meant--one of My days of a thousand years, or one  of your days. I will give him one of My days. He shall have nine  hundred and thirty years to live, and seventy to leave to his  descendants.\"[72]    When Adam and Eve heard God approaching, they hid among the  trees--which would not have been possible before the fall. Before  he committed his trespass, Adam's height was from the heavens to  the earth, but afterward it was reduced to one hundred ells.[73]  Another consequence of his sin was the fear Adam felt when he  heard the voice of God: before his fall it had not disquieted him  in the least.[74] Hence it was that when Adam said, \"I heard Thy  voice in the garden, and I was afraid,\" God replied, \"Aforetime  thou wert not afraid, and now thou art afraid?\"[75]    God refrained from reproaches at first. Standing at the gate of  Paradise, He but asked, \"Where art thou, Adam?\" Thus did God  desire to teach man a rule of polite behavior, never to enter the  house of another without announcing himself.[76] It cannot be  denied, the words \"Where art thou?\" were pregnant with meaning.  They were intended to bring home to Adam the vast difference  between his latter and his former state--between his supernatural  size then and his shrunken size now; between the lordship of God  over him then and the lordship of the serpent over him now.[77]  At the same time, God wanted to give Adam the opportunity of  repenting of his sin, and he would have received Divine  forgiveness for it. But so far from repenting of it, Adam  slandered God, and uttered blasphemies against Him.[78] When God  asked him, \"Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee  thou shouldst not eat?\" he did not confess his sin, but excused  himself with the words: \"O Lord of the world! As long"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1494"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 2 (#14)"],[1,"one, on account of her pious, perfect  deeds.[188]    Asenath had saved Joseph's life while she was still an  infant in arms. When Joseph was accused of immoral conduct  by Potiphar's wife and the other women, and his master  was on the point of having him hanged, Asenath approached  her foster-father, and she assured him under oath that the  charge against Joseph was false. Then spake God, \"As  thou livest, because thou didst try to defend Joseph, thou  shalt be the woman to bear the tribes that he is appointed  to beget.[189]    Asenath bore him two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, during  the seven years of plenty, for in the time of famine  Joseph refrained from all indulgence in the pleasures of  life.[190] They were bred in chastity and fear of God by their  father, and they were wise, and well-instructed in all knowledge  and in the affairs of state, so that they became the  favorites of the court, and were educated with the royal  princes.    Before the famine broke over the land, Joseph found an  opportunity of rendering the king a great service. He  equipped an army of four thousand six hundred men, providing  all the soldiers with shields and spears and bucklers  and helmets and slings. With this army, and aided by the  servants and officers of the king, and by the people of Egypt,  he carried on a war with Tarshish in the first year after his  appointment as viceroy. The people of Tarshish had invaded  the territory of the Ishmaelites, and the latter, few  in number at that time, were sore pressed, and applied to  the king of Egypt for help against their enemies. At the  head of his host of heroes, Joseph marched to the land of  Havilah, where he was joined by the Ishmaelites, and with  united forces they fought against the people of Tarshish,  routed them utterly, settled their land with the Ishmaelites,  while the defeated men took refuge with their brethren in  Javan. Joseph and his army returned to Egypt, and not a  man had they lost.    In a little while Joseph's prophecy was confirmed: that  year and the six following years were years of plenty, as  he had foretold.[191] The harvest was so ample that a single  ear produced two heaps of grain,[192] and Joseph made circumspect  arrangements to provide abundantly for the years of  famine. He gathered up all the grain, and in the city situated  in the middle of each district he laid up the produce  from round about, and had ashes and earth strewn on the  garnered food from the very soil on which it had been  grown;[193] also he preserved the grain in the ear; all these  being precautions taken to guard against rot and mildew.  The inhabitants of Egypt also tried, on their own account,  to put aside a portion of the superabundant harvest of the  seven fruitful years against the need of the future, but when  the grievous time of dearth came, and they went to their  storehouses to bring forth the treasured grain, behold, it  had rotted, and become unfit for food.[194] The famine broke  in upon the people with such suddenness that the bread gave  out unexpectedly as they sat at their tables, they had not  even a bite of bran bread.    Thus they were driven to apply to Joseph and beseech his  help, and he admonished them, saying, \"Give up your allegiance  to your deceitful idols, and say, Blessed is He who  giveth bread unto all flesh.\" But they refused to deny their  lying gods, and they betook themselves to Pharaoh, only  to be told by him, \"Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you,  do!\" For this Pharaoh was rewarded. God granted him  long life and a long reign, until he became arrogant, and  well-merited punishment overtook him.[195]    When the Egyptians approached Joseph with the petition  for bread, he spoke, saying, \"I give no food to the  uncircumcised. Go hence, and circumcise yourselves, and then  return hither.\" They entered the presence of Pharaoh, and  complained to him regarding Joseph, but he said as  before, \"Go unto Joseph!\" And they replied, \"We come  from Joseph, and he hath spoken roughly unto us, saying,  Go hence and circumcise yourselves! We warned thee in  the beginning that he is a Hebrew, and would treat us in  such wise.\" Pharaoh said to them: \"O ye fools, did he not  prophesy through the holy spirit and proclaim to the whole  world, that there would come seven years of plenty to be  followed by seven years of dearth? Why did you not save  the yield of one or two years against the day of your need?\"    Weeping, they made reply: \"The grain that we put  aside during the good years hath rotted.\"    Pharaoh: \"Have ye nothing over of the flour of yesterday?\"    The Egyptians: \"The very bread in the basket rotted!\"    Pharaoh: \"Why?\"    The Egyptians: \"Because Joseph willed thus!\"    Pharaoh: \"O ye fools, if his word hath power over the  grain, making it to rot when he desireth it to rot, then also  must we die, if so be his wish concerning us. Go, therefore,  unto him, and do as he bids you.\"[196]      JOSEPH'S BRETHREN IN EGYPT    The famine, which inflicted hardships first upon the  wealthy among the Egyptians, gradually extended its ravages  as far as Phoenicia, Arabia, and Palestine.[197] Though  the sons of Jacob, being young men, frequented the streets  and the highways, yet they were ignorant of what their old  home-keeping father Jacob knew, that corn could be procured in  Egypt. Jacob even suspected that Joseph was in  Egypt. His prophetic spirit, which forsook him during the  time of his grief for his son, yet manifested itself now and  again in dim visions, and he was resolved to send his sons  down into Egypt.[198] There was another reason. Though he  was not yet in want, he nevertheless had them go thither for  food, because he was averse from arousing the envy of the  sons of Esau and Ishmael by his comfortable state.[199] For  the same reason, to avoid friction with the surrounding  peoples, he bade his sons not appear in public with bread in  their hands, or in the accoutrements of war.[200] And as he  knew that they were likely to attract attention, on account  of their heroic stature and handsome appearance, he cautioned  them against going to the city all together through  the same gate, or, indeed, showing themselves all together  anywhere in public, that the evil eye be not cast upon them.[201]    The famine in Canaan inspired Joseph with the hope of  seeing his brethren. To make sure of their coming, he  issued a decree concerning the purchase of corn in Egypt,  as follows: \"By order of the king and his deputy, and the  princes of the realm, be it enacted that he who desireth to  buy grain in Egypt may not send his slave hither to do his  bidding, but he must charge his own sons therewith. An  Egyptian or a Canaanite that hath bought grain and then  selleth it again shall be put to death, for none may buy more  than he requireth for the needs of his household. Also, who  cometh with two or three beasts of burden, and loads them  up with grain, shall be put to death.\"    At the gates of the city of Egypt, Joseph stationed guards,  whose office was to inquire and take down the name of all  that should come to buy corn, and also the name of their  father and their grandfather, and every evening the list of  names thus made was handed to Joseph. These precautions  were bound to bring Joseph's brethren down to Egypt, and  also acquaint him with their coming as soon as they entered  the land.    On their journey his brethren thought more of Joseph  than of their errand. They said to one another: \"We know  that Joseph was carried down into Egypt, and we will make  search for him there, and if we should find him, we will  ransom him from his master, and if his master should refuse  to sell him, we will use force, though we perish ourselves.\"[202]    At the gates of the city of Egypt, the brethren of Joseph  were asked what their names were, and the names of their  father and grandfather. The guard on duty happened to be  Manasseh, the son of Joseph. The brethren submitted to  being questioned, saying \"Let us go into the town, and we  shall see whether this taking down of our names be a matter  of taxes. If it be so, we shall not demur; but if it be something  else, we shall see to-morrow what can be done in the  case.\"[203]    On the evening of the day they entered Egypt, Joseph  discovered their names in the list, which he was in the  habit of examining daily, and he commanded that all  stations for the sale of corn be closed, except one only.  Furthermore, even at this station no sales were to be negotiated  unless the name of the would-be purchaser was first  obtained. His brethren, with whose names Joseph furnished  the overseer of the place, were to be seized and brought to  him as soon as they put in appearance.    But the first thought of the brethren was for Joseph, and  their first concern, to seek him. For three days they made  search for him everywhere, even in the most disreputable  quarters of the city. Meantime Joseph was in communication  with the overseer of the station kept open for the sale  of corn, and, hearing that his brethren had not appeared  there, he dispatched some of his servants to look for them,  but they found them neither in Mizraim, the city of Egypt,  nor in Goshen, nor in Raamses. Thereupon he sent sixteen  servants forth to make a house to house search for them in  the city, and they discovered the brethren of Joseph in a  place of ill-fame and haled them before their master.      JOSEPH MEETS HIS BRETHREN    A large crown of gold on his head, apparelled in byssus  and purple, and surrounded by his valiant men, Joseph was  seated upon his throne in his palace. His brethren fell down  before him in great admiration of his beauty, his stately  appearance, and his majesty.[204] They did not know him, for  when Joseph was sold into slavery, he was a beardless youth.  But he knew his brethren, their appearance had not changed  in aught, for they were bearded men when he was separated  "]]]
