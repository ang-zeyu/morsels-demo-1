(#14)"],[1," usual to write and even pronounce cubic centimetre  shortly as c.c., and the only other denomination of volume we shall have  occasion to use is the \"litre,\" which measures 1000 c.c., and is roughly  1-3/4 pints.    The weights used are kept in boxes in a definite order, so that the  weights on the balance can be counted as well by noting those which are  absent from the box as by counting those present on the scale-pan. The  weights run 50, 20, 10, 10, 5, 2, 1, 1 and 1 grams, and are formed of  brass. The fractions of the gram are generally made of platinum or of  aluminium, and are arranged in the following order:--0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1,  and 0.05, 0.02, 0.01, 0.01. These may be marked in this way, or they may  be marked 500, 200, 100, 100, 50, 20, 10, 10; the 500 meaning 500  milligrams.    Some makers send out weights in the series 50, 20, 20, 10, &c.    Weights of less than 0.01 gram are generally present in a box, but it is  much more convenient to work with a rider. This is a piece of wire which  in the pan weighs 0.01 gram; it is made in such a form that it will ride  on the beam, and its effective weight decreases as it approaches the  centre. If the arm of the beam is divided into tenths, then each tenth  counting from the centre outward equals 0.001 gram or 1 milligram, and  if these tenths be further subdivided the fractions of a milligram are  obtained; and these give figures in the fourth place of decimals. A  fairly good balance should be sensitive to 0.0001 gram. The weights must  never be touched with the fingers, and the forceps for moving them is  used for no other purpose. When not in actual use the box is kept  closed. The weights must not be allowed to remain on the pan of the  balance. The balance-case must not be open without some reason. It must  be fixed level, and, once fixed, must not be needlessly moved. The bench  on which it stands should be used for no other purpose, and no one  should be allowed to lean upon it.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.]    When using a balance sit directly in front of it. Ordinarily the  substance to be weighed is best put on the pan to the user's left; the  weights and the rider are then easily manipulated. Powders, &c., should  not be weighed directly on the balance; a counterpoised watch-glass or  metal scoop (fig. 25) should be used. In some cases it is advisable to  use a weighing-bottle. This is a light, well-stoppered bottle (fig. 3)  containing the powdered ore. It is first filled and weighed; then some  of the substance is carefully poured from it into a beaker or other  vessel, and it is weighed again; the difference in the two weighings  gives the weight of substance taken. A substance must always be cold  when weighed, and large glass vessels should be allowed to stand in the  balance-box a little while before being weighed. Always have the balance  at rest when putting on or taking off anything from the pans. Put the  weights on systematically. In using the rider (except you have a reason  to the contrary), put it on at the 5; if this is too much, then try it  at the 3; if then the weights are too little, try at the 4, if still not  enough, the correct weight must be between the 4 and 5; try half-way  between.    It is best to work with the balance vibrating; equilibrium is  established when the vibration to the left is the mean of the preceding  and succeeding vibrations to the right. For example, if it vibrates 6  divisions to the right on one swing, and 5 divisions on the next, the  intermediate vibration to the left should have been 5-1/2.    Note whether the substance increases in weight whilst on the balance. If  it does it may be because it was put on warm, and is cooling, or it may  be because it is taking up moisture from the air. Substances which take  up moisture rapidly should be weighed in clipped watch-glasses or in  light-weighing bottles or tubes.    Students, in recording the weights, should first read off those missing  from the box, writing down each order of figures as determined; first  tens, then units, and so on. Remember that the first four platinum  weights give the figures of the first place of decimals, the second four  give the second place, and that the third and fourth places are given by  the rider. Having taken down the figures, confirm them by reading off  the weights as you put them back into the box. Do not rest a weight on  the palm of your hand for convenience in reading the mark upon it.  Remember one weight lost from a box spoils the set. Do not take it for  granted that the balance is in equilibrium before you start weighing:  try it.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.]    ~Measuring Liquids.~--For coarse work, such as measuring acids for  dissolving ores, graduated glasses similar to those used by druggists  may be used. It is well to have two sizes--a smaller graduated into  divisions of 5 c.c. (fig. 26), and a larger with divisions equal to 10  c.c. No measurement of importance should be made in a vessel of this  kind, as a slight variation in level causes a serious error.    ~Graduated flasks~ must be used when anything has to be made up to a  definite bulk, or when a fixed volume has to be collected. If, for  example, a certain weight of substance has to be dissolved and diluted  to a litre, or if the first 50 c.c. of a distillate has to be collected,  a flask should be used. Each flask is graduated for one particular  quantity; the most useful sizes are 1000 c.c., 500 c.c., 200 c.c., 100  c.c., and 50 c.c. The mark should be in the narrowest part of the neck,  and should be tangential to the curved surface of the liquid when the  flask _contains_ the exact volume specified. The level of a curved  surface of liquid is at first somewhat difficult to read: the beginner  is in doubt whether the surface should be taken at A, B, or C (fig. 27).  It is best to take the lowest reading C. In some lights it is difficult  to find this; in such cases a piece of white paper or card held behind  and a little below, so as to throw light up and against the curved  surface, will render it clear. In reading, one should look neither up at  nor down upon the surface, but the eye should be on the same level with  it. It must be kept in mind that flasks _contain_ the quantity  specified, but deliver less than this by the amount remaining in them  and damping the sides. If it is desired to transfer the contents say of  a 100 c.c. flask to a beaker, it will be necessary to complete the  transfer by rinsing out the flask and adding the washings; otherwise  there will be a sensible loss. Graduated cylinders (fig. 28) are  convenient for preparing standard solutions.    [Illustration: FIG. 27.]    [Illustration: FIG. 28.]    [Illustration: FIG. 29.]    ~Pipettes~ and burettes are graduated to _deliver_ the quantities  specified. The principle of the pipette, and the advantages and  disadvantages of its various forms, may be understood by considering the  first form shown in fig. 29. It is essentially a bulbed tube drawn out  to a jet at its lower end, and having on each side of the bulb a mark so  placed that when the surface of the liquid falls from the upper to the  lower mark the instrument shall deliver exactly 100 c.c. The bore of the  jet should be of such a size as will allow the level of the liquid to  fall at the rate of about one foot in two minutes. If it runs more  quickly than this, an appreciable error arises from the varying amount  of liquid remaining, and damping the sides of the bulb. The flow of  liquid from a pipette must not be hastened by blowing into it. The lower  tube or nose of the pipette should be long enough to reach into the  bottle or flask containing the liquid about to be measured. The pipette  is filled by sucking at the open end with the mouth; this method of  filling renders the use of the instrument dangerous for such liquids as  strong acids, ammonia, and such poisonous solutions as that of potassic  cyanide. One attempt with a fairly strong solution of ammonia will teach  the beginner a very useful lesson. As soon as the liquid rises above the  upper mark in the pipette, the mouth is withdrawn, and the pipette  quickly closed by pressing the upper aperture with the index finger of  the right hand; it is well to have the finger slightly moist, but not  damp. The neck of the pipette should be long enough to allow its being  firmly grasped by the fingers and thumb of the right hand without  inconvenience. The pipette is first held in a vertical position long  enough to allow any moisture outside the tube to run down, and then the  liquid is allowed to run out to the level of the upper mark; this is  easily effected by lessening the pressure. If the finger is wet, the  flow will be jerky, and good work impossible. The pipette is next held  over the vessel into which the 100 c.c. are to be put, and the liquid  allowed to run out. When the bulb is nearly empty, the flow should be  checked by replacing the finger, and the liquid allowed to escape slowly  until the lower mark is reached. The pipette is then withdrawn; it is in  the withdrawing that the disadvantage of this particular form[5] makes  itself felt. It must be withdrawn very steadily, as the slightest shock  causes the remaining column of liquid to vibrate, whereby air is drawn  in and the liquid is forced out.    This disadvantage is got rid of by making the mouth of the jet the lower  limit, or, in other words, allowing the instrument to empty itself.  There are two forms of such pipettes; in the one generally recommended  in Gay-Lussac's silver assay (the last shown in fig. 29) the nose is  replaced by a jet. This is most conveniently filled by stopping the jet  with the finger, and allowing the liquid to flow in a fine stream into  the neck until the pipette is filled, and then working as just  described. The other form is the one in general use; in fact, a long  nose to a pipette is so convenient that it may almost be said to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18755"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part II-II (Secunda Secundae) (#14)"],[1,"its end: and this good which is the end of  faith, viz. the Divine Good, is the proper object of charity.  Therefore charity is called the form of faith in so far as the act  of faith is perfected and formed by charity.    Reply Obj. 1: Charity is called the form of faith because it quickens  the act of faith. Now nothing hinders one act from being quickened by  different habits, so as to be reduced to various species in a certain  order, as stated above (I-II, Q. 18, AA. 6, 7; I-II, Q. 61, A. 2)  when we were treating of human acts in general.    Reply Obj. 2: This objection is true of an intrinsic form. But it is  not thus that charity is the form of faith, but in the sense that it  quickens the act of faith, as explained above.    Reply Obj. 3: Even obedience, and hope likewise, and whatever other  virtue might precede the act of faith, is quickened by charity, as  we shall show further on (Q. 23, A. 8), and consequently charity is  spoken of as the form of faith.  _______________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 4, Art. 4]    Whether Lifeless Faith Can Become Living, or Living Faith, Lifeless?    Objection 1: It would seem that lifeless faith does not become  living, or living faith lifeless. For, according to 1 Cor. 13:10,  \"when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be  done away.\" Now lifeless faith is imperfect in comparison with living  faith. Therefore when living faith comes, lifeless faith is done  away, so that they are not one identical habit.    Obj. 2: Further, a dead thing does not become a living thing. Now  lifeless faith is dead, according to James 2:20: \"Faith without works  is dead.\" Therefore lifeless faith cannot become living.    Obj. 3: Further, God's grace, by its advent, has no less effect in a  believer than in an unbeliever. Now by coming to an unbeliever it  causes the habit of faith. Therefore when it comes to a believer, who  hitherto had the habit of lifeless faith, it causes another habit of  faith in him.    Obj. 4: Further, as Boethius says (In Categ. Arist. i), \"accidents  cannot be altered.\" Now faith is an accident. Therefore the same  faith cannot be at one time living, and at another, lifeless.    _On the contrary,_ A gloss on the words, \"Faith without works is dead\"  (James 2:20) adds, \"by which it lives once more.\" Therefore faith  which was lifeless and without form hitherto, becomes formed and  living.    _I answer that,_ There have been various opinions on this question.  For some [*William of Auxerre, Sum. Aur. III, iii, 15] have said that  living and lifeless faith are distinct habits, but that when living  faith comes, lifeless faith is done away, and that, in like manner,  when a man sins mortally after having living faith, a new habit of  lifeless faith is infused into him by God. But it seems unfitting  that grace should deprive man of a gift of God by coming to him, and  that a gift of God should be infused into man, on account of a mortal  sin.    Consequently others [*Alexander of Hales, Sum. Theol. iii, 64] have  said that living and lifeless faith are indeed distinct habits, but  that, all the same, when living faith comes the habit of lifeless  faith is not taken away, and that it remains together with the habit  of living faith in the same subject. Yet again it seems unreasonable  that the habit of lifeless faith should remain inactive in a person  having living faith.    We must therefore hold differently that living and lifeless faith are  one and the same habit. The reason is that a habit is differentiated  by that which directly pertains to that habit. Now since faith is a  perfection of the intellect, that pertains directly to faith, which  pertains to the intellect. Again, what pertains to the will, does not  pertain directly to faith, so as to be able to differentiate the habit  of faith. But the distinction of living from lifeless faith is in  respect of something pertaining to the will, i.e. charity, and not in  respect of something pertaining to the intellect. Therefore living and  lifeless faith are not distinct habits.    Reply Obj. 1: The saying of the Apostle refers to those imperfect  things from which imperfection is inseparable, for then, when the  perfect comes the imperfect must needs be done away. Thus with the  advent of clear vision, faith is done away, because it is essentially  \"of the things that appear not.\" When, however, imperfection is not  inseparable from the imperfect thing, the same identical thing which  was imperfect becomes perfect. Thus childhood is not essential to man  and consequently the same identical subject who was a child, becomes  a man. Now lifelessness is not essential to faith, but is accidental  thereto as stated above. Therefore lifeless faith itself becomes  living.    Reply Obj. 2: That which makes an animal live is inseparable from an  animal, because it is its substantial form, viz. the soul:  consequently a dead thing cannot become a living thing, and a living  and a dead thing differ specifically. On the other hand that which  gives faith its form, or makes it live, is not essential to faith.  Hence there is no comparison.    Reply Obj. 3: Grace causes faith not only when faith begins anew to  be in a man, but also as long as faith lasts. For it has been said  above (I, Q. 104, A. 1; I-II, Q. 109, A. 9) that God is always  working man's justification, even as the sun is always lighting up  the air. Hence grace is not less effective when it comes to a  believer than when it comes to an unbeliever: since it causes faith  in both, in the former by confirming and perfecting it, in the latter  by creating it anew.    We might also reply that it is accidental, namely on account of the  disposition of the subject, that grace does not cause faith in one  who has it already: just as, on the other hand, a second mortal sin  does not take away grace from one who has already lost it through a  previous mortal sin.    Reply Obj. 4: When living faith becomes lifeless, faith is not  changed, but its subject, the soul, which at one time has faith  without charity, and at another time, with charity.  _______________________    FIFTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 4, Art. 5]    Whether Faith Is a Virtue?    Objection 1: It would seem that faith is not a virtue. For virtue  is directed to the good, since \"it is virtue that makes its subject  good,\" as the Philosopher states (Ethic. ii, 6). But faith is  directed to the true. Therefore faith is not a virtue.    Obj. 2: Further, infused virtue is more perfect than acquired virtue.  Now faith, on account of its imperfection, is not placed among the  acquired intellectual virtues, as the Philosopher states (Ethic. vi,  3). Much less, therefore, can it be considered an infused virtue.    Obj. 3: Further, living and lifeless faith are the same species, as  stated above (A. 4). Now lifeless faith is not a virtue, since it is  not connected with the other virtues. Therefore neither is living  faith a virtue.    Obj. 4: Further, the gratuitous graces and the fruits are distinct  from the virtues. But faith is numbered among the gratuitous graces  (1 Cor. 12:9) and likewise among the fruits (Gal. 5:23). Therefore  faith is not a virtue.    _On the contrary,_ Man is justified by the virtues, since \"justice  is all virtue,\" as the Philosopher states (Ethic. v, 1). Now man is  justified by faith according to Rom. 5:1: \"Being justified therefore  by faith let us have peace,\" etc. Therefore faith is a virtue.    _I answer that,_ As shown above, it is by human virtue that human  acts are rendered good; hence, any habit that is always the principle  of a good act, may be called a human virtue. Such a habit is living  faith. For since to believe is an act of the intellect assenting to  the truth at the command of the will, two things are required that  this act may be perfect: one of which is that the intellect should  infallibly tend to its object, which is the true; while the other is  that the will should be infallibly directed to the last end, on  account of which it assents to the true: and both of these are to be  found in the act of living faith. For it belongs to the very essence  of faith that the intellect should ever tend to the true, since  nothing false can be the object of faith, as proved above (Q. 1, A.  3): while the effect of charity, which is the form of faith, is that  the soul ever has its will directed to a good end. Therefore living  faith is a virtue.    On the other hand, lifeless faith is not a virtue, because, though  the act of lifeless faith is duly perfect on the part of the  intellect, it has not its due perfection as regards the will: just as  if temperance be in the concupiscible, without prudence being in the  rational part, temperance is not a virtue, as stated above (I-II, Q.  65, A. 1), because the act of temperance requires both an act of  reason, and an act of the concupiscible faculty, even as the act of  faith requires an act of the will, and an act of the intellect.    Reply Obj. 1: The truth is itself the good of the intellect, since it  is its perfection: and consequently faith has a relation to some good  in so far as it directs the intellect to the true. Furthermore, it  has a relation to the good considered as the object of the will,  inasmuch as it is formed by charity.    Reply Obj. 2: The faith of which the Philosopher speaks is based on  human reasoning in a conclusion which does not follow, of necessity,  from its premisses; and which is subject to be false: hence such like  faith is not a virtue. On the other hand, the faith of which we are  speaking is based on the Divine Truth, which is infallible, and  consequently its object cannot be anything false; so that faith of  this kind can be a virtue.    Reply Obj. 3: Living and lifeless faith do not differ specifically,  as though they belonged to different species. But they differ as  perfect and imperfect within the same species. Hence lifeless faith,  being"]]]
