His  swollen tongue moved a pebble back and forth in his dry mouth. He  stared dimly down the slope to that beckoning platter of water open  under the sun, rimmed with the deadly woodland.    What had happened? They had gone to sleep that first night under the  ledge of the dried waterfall. And all of the next day was only a haze  to him now. They must have moved on, though he could remember nothing,  save Hume's odd behavior--dull-eyed silence while stumbling on as a  brainless servio-robot, incoherent speech wherein all the words came  fast, running together unintelligibly. And for himself--patches of  blackout.    At some time they had come to the cave and Hume had collapsed, not  rousing in answer to any of Vye's struggles to awaken him. How long  they had been there Vye could not tell now. He had the fear of being  left alone in this place. With water perhaps Hume could be returned to  consciousness, but that was all gone.    Vye believed he could scent the lake, that every breeze up slope  brought its compelling enticement. Just in case Hume might awake to a  state of semi-consciousness and wander off, Vye tethered him with  blanket bonds.    Vye fingered Hume's knife, which had been painstakingly lashed to a  trimmed shaft of wood. Since he had emerged from that clouding of mind  which still gripped the Hunter, he had done what he could to prepare  for another attack from any roving beast. And he also had Hume's ray  tube--its single charge to be used only in dire need.    Water! His cracked lips moved, ejected the pebble. Their four empty  water bulbs were in the front of his blanket tunic, pressing against  his ribs. It was now--or die, because soon he would be too weak to  make the attempt at all. He darted for the first stand of bush  downhill.    As the brooding silence of the valley continued, he reached the edge  of the wood unhindered, intent on his mission with a concentration  which shut out everything save his need and the manner of satisfying  it.    He squatted in the bush, eyeing the length of woodland ahead. Then he  tried the only action he had been able to think out. That beast Hume  had killed had been too heavy to swing up in trees. But Vye's own  weight now did not prohibit that form of travel.    With spear and ray tube firmly attached to him, Vye climbed into the  first tree. A slim chance--but his only defense against a possible  ambush. A wild outward swing brought him, heart-thudding, to the next  set of limbs. Then he had a piece of luck, a looped vine tied together  a whole group of branches from one treetop to the next.    Hand grips, balance, sometimes a walk along a branch--he threaded  towards the lake. Then he came to a gap. With hands laced into  tendrils, Vye hunched to look down on a beaten ribbon of gray earth--a  trail well used by the evidence of its pounded surface.    That area had to be crossed on foot, but his passage through the brush  below would leave traces. Only--there was no other way. Vye checked  the lashings of his weapons again before leaping. Almost in the same  instant his sandals hit the packed earth he was running. His palms  skinned raw on rough bark as he somehow scrambled aloft once more.    No more vines, but broad limbs shooting well out. He dropped from one  to another-stopped for breath--listened.    The dark gloom of the wood was broken by sunlight. He was at the final  ring of trees. To get to the water he must descend again. A dead trunk  extended over the water. If he could run out on that and lower the  bulb, it could work.    Eerie silence. No flying things, no tree dwelling reptiles or animals,  no disturbance of any water creature on the unruffled surface of the  lake. Yet the sensation of life, inimical life, lurking in the depths  of the wood, under the water, bore in upon him.    Vye made the light leap to the bole of the dead tree, balanced out on  it over the water, moving slowly as the trunk settled a little under  his weight. He hunkered down, brought out the first bulb tied fast to  a blanket string.    The water of the river had been brown, opaque. But here the liquid was  not so cloudy. He could see snags of dead branches below its surface.    And something else!    Down in those turgid depths he made out a straight ridge running with  a trueness of line which could not be nature's unassisted product.  That ridge joined another in a squared corner. He leaned over,  strained his eyes to follow through the murk the farther extent of  those two ridges. Looked along both pointed protuberances aimed at the  surfaces of the lake, like fangs in an open jaw. Down there was  something--something artificially fashioned which might be the answer  to all their questions. But to venture into the lake himself--he could  not do it! If he could bring the Out-Hunter to his senses the other  might find the solution to this puzzle.    Vye filled his bulbs, working speedily, but still studying what he  could see of the strange erection under the lake. He thought it was  curiously free of silt, and its color, as far as he could distinguish,  allowing for the dark hue of the water, was light gray--perhaps even  white. He lowered his last bulb.    Down in the bleached forest of dead branches, well to one side of the  mysterious walls, there was movement, a slow rolling of a shadow so  hidden by a stirring of bottom mud that Vye could not make out its  true form. But it was rising to the bulb.    Vye hated to lose a single precious drop. Once he might have the luck  to make this journey unmolested, a second time the odds could be too  high.    A flash--the slowly rising shadow was transformed into a whizzing  spear of attack. Vye snapped the bulb out of the water just as a  nightmarish, armored head arose on a whiplash of coiled, scaled neck,  and a blunt nose thudded against the tree trunk with a hollow boom.  Vye clung to his perch as the thing flopped back into deeper water  from a froth of beaten foam, leaving a patch of odorous scum and slime  to bracelet the waterlogged wood.    He ran for the shelter of the trees to get away. This time there was  no rear, no thump of feet in warning. Out of the ground itself, or so  it seemed to Vye's startled terror, reared one of the tusked beasts.  To reach his tree and its dubious safety he had to wind past that  chimera. And the creature waited with a semblance of ease for him to  come to it.    Vye brought around his spear. The length of the haft might afford him  a fighting chance if he could send the point home in some vulnerable  spot. Yet he knew that the beasts were hard to kill.    The mouth opened in a wide grin of menace. Vye noted a telltale  tightening of shoulder muscles. It was going to rush for him now with  those clawed forepaws out to rip.    To wait was to court disaster. Vye shouted, his battle cry piercing  the silence of the lake and wood. He sprang, aiming the spear point at  the beast's protuberant belly, and then swerved to the side as the  knife bit home, raking his weapon to open a gaping wound.    The spear was jerked from Vye's hold as both those taloned paws closed  on it. Then the creature pulled it free, snapped the haft in two. Vye  fired a short blast from the ray tube before it could turn on him, saw  fur-fuzz afire, as he ran for the tree.    Beneath its branches he looked back. The beast was pawing at the  burning fur on its head, and he had perhaps a second or two. He jumped  and his fingers caught on the low hanging branch, then he made a  superhuman effort, was up out of the path of the thing which rushed  blindly for the tree, shrieking in frenzied complaint.    The huge body crashed against the trunk with force which nearly shook  Vye from his hold. As the giant forepaws belabored the wood, strove to  lift the body from the ground, Vye worked his way out on another  branch. In the end it was the shaking of that limb under him which  aided his swing to the next tree. And from there he traveled  recklessly, intent only on getting out of the woods as fast as he  could.    By the noise the beast was still assaulting the tree, and Vye marveled  at its vitality, for the belly wound would long ago have killed any  creature he knew. Whether it could trace his flight aloft, or whether  its howls would bring more of its kind, he could not guess, but every  second he could gain was all important now.    At the gap over the trail he hesitated. That path ran in the direction  of the open, and to go on foot meant the possibility of greater speed.  Vye slipped from the bough, hit the ground, and ran. His ragged  lungsful of air came in great gasps and he doubted if he could take  the exertion of more tree travel now. He raced down the path.    Those mewling cries were louder, he was sure of it. Now he heard the  thump of the beast's blundering pursuit behind him. But its bulk and  hurts slowed it. In the open he could find cover behind a rock, use  the ray again.    The trees began to thin. Vye summoned power for a last burst of speed,  came out of the shadow of the wood as might a dart expelled from a  needler. Before him, up slope, was the closed door of the valley. And  moving in from the left was another of the blue beasts.    He could not retreat to the trees. But the newcomer was moving with  the same ponderous self-confidence its fellow had shown earlier. Vye  dodged right, headed for the rocks by the gap. As he pulled himself  into that temporary fortification, the wounded beast dragged out of  the woods below. He thought it was blind, yet some instinct drove it  after him.    Shaking from fatigue, Vye steadied his forearm on the top of the rock,  brought up the ray tube. Less than two yards away now was the  deceptively open mouth of the gap. If he threw himself at that, would  the elasticity of the unseen curtain hurl him back into the claws of  the enemy?

After Matins and Midnight  Mass at Santa Maria Maggiore, the Pope went in procession to Sant'  Anastasia for Lauds and the Mass of the Dawn. The third Mass, at St.  Peter's, was an event of great solemnity, and at it took place in the  year 800 that profoundly significant event, the coronation of Charlemagne  by Leo III.--a turning-point in European history.{13}    Later it became the custom for the Pope, instead of proceeding to St.  Peter's, to return to Santa Maria Maggiore for the third Mass. On his  arrival he was given a cane with a lighted candle affixed to it; with  this he had to set fire to some tow placed on the capitals of the  columns.{14} The ecclesiastical explanation of this strange ceremony was  that it symbolised the end of the world by fire, but one may conjecture  that some pagan custom lay at its root. Since 1870 the Pope, as \"the  prisoner of the Vatican,\" has of course ceased to celebrate at Santa  Maria Maggiore or Sant' Anastasia. The Missal, however, still shows a  trace of the papal visit to Sant' Anastasia in a commemoration of this  saint which comes as a curious parenthesis in the Mass of the Dawn.    On Christmas Day in the Vatican the Pope blesses a hat and a sword, and  these are sent as gifts to some prince. The practice is said to have  arisen from the mediaeval custom for the Holy Roman Emperor or some other  sovereign to read one of the lessons at Christmas Matins, in the papal  chapel, with his sword drawn.{15}    Celebrated in countries as distant from one another, both geographically  and in character, as Ireland and Sicily, Poland and South America, the  Midnight Mass naturally varies greatly in its tone and setting. Sometimes  it is little more than a fashionable function, sometimes the devotion of  those who attend is shown by a tramp over miles of snow through the  darkness and the bitter wind.    In some charming memories of the Christmas of her childhood, Madame Th.  Bentzon thus describes the walk to the Midnight Mass in a French country  place about sixty years ago:-- |97|        \"I can see myself as a little girl, bundled up to the tip of      my nose in furs and knitted shawls, tiny wooden shoes on my feet, a      lantern in my hand, setting out with my parents for the Midnight Mass      of Christmas Eve.... We started off, a number of us, together in a      stream of light.... Our lanterns cast great shadows on the white      road, crisp with frost. As our little group advanced it saw others on      their way, people from the farm and from the mill, who joined us, and      once on the Place de l'Eglise we found ourselves with all the      parishioners in a body. No one spoke--the icy north wind cut short      our breath; but the voice of the chimes filled the silence.... We      entered, accompanied by a gust of wind that swept into the porch at      the same time we did; and the splendours of the altar, studded with      lights, green with pine and laurel branches, dazzled us from the      threshold.\"{16}    In devout Tyrol, the scenes on Christmas Eve before the Midnight Mass are  often extremely impressive, particularly in narrow valleys where the  houses lie scattered on the mountain slopes. Long before midnight the  torches lighting the faithful on their way to Mass begin to twinkle;  downward they move, now hidden in pine-woods and ravines, now reappearing  on the open hill-side. More and more lights show themselves and throw  ruddy flashes on the snow, until at last, the floor of the valley  reached, they vanish, and only the church windows glow through the  darkness, while the solemn strains of the organ and chanting break the  silence of the night.{17}    Not everywhere has the great Mass been celebrated amid scenes so still  and devotional. In Madrid, says a writer of the early nineteenth century,  \"the evening of the vigil is scarcely dark when numbers of men, women,  and boys are seen traversing the streets with torches, and many of them  supplied with tambourines, which they strike loudly as they move along in  a kind of Bacchanal procession. There is a tradition here that the  shepherds who visited Bethlehem on the day of the Nativity had  instruments of this sort upon which they expressed the sentiment of joy  that animated them when they received the intelligence that a Saviour was  born.\" At the Midnight Mass crowds of people who, perhaps, had been  traversing the streets the whole night, came into the church |98| with  their tambourines and guitars, and accompanied the organ. The Mass over,  they began to dance in the very body of the church.{18} A later writer  speaks of the Midnight Mass in Madrid as a fashionable function to which  many gay young people went in order to meet one another.{19} Such is the  character of the service in the Spanish-American cities. In Lima the  streets on Christmas Eve are crowded with gaily dressed and noisy folks,  many of them masked, and everybody goes to the Mass.{20} In Paris the  elaborate music attracts enormous and often not very serious crowds. In  Sicily there is sometimes extraordinary irreverence at the midnight  services: people take provisions with them to eat in church, and from  time to time go out to an inn for a drink, and between the offices they  imitate the singing of birds.{21} We may see in such things the licence  of pagan festivals creeping within the very walls of the sanctuary.    In the Rhineland Midnight Mass has been abolished, because the  conviviality of Christmas Eve led to unseemly behaviour at the solemn  service, but Mass is still celebrated very early--at four or five--and  great crowds of worshippers attend. It is a stirring thing, this first  Mass of Christmas, in some ancient town, when from the piercing cold, the  intense stillness of the early morning, one enters a great church  thronged with people, bright with candles, warm with human fellowship,  and hears the vast congregation break out into a slow solemn chorale,  full of devout joy that       \"In Bethlehem geboren      Ist uns ein Kindelein.\"    It is interesting to trace survivals of the nocturnal Christmas offices  in Protestant countries. In German \"Evangelical\" churches, midnight or  early morning services were common in the eighteenth century; but they  were forbidden in some places because of the riot and drunkenness which  accompanied them. The people seem to have regarded them as a part of  their Christmas revellings rather than as sacred functions; one writer  compares the congregation to a crowd of wild drunken sailors in a |99|  tavern, another gives disgusting particulars of disorders in a church  where the only sober man was the preacher.{22}    In Sweden the Christmas service is performed very early in the morning,  the chancel is lighted up with many candles, and the celebrant is vested  in a white chasuble with golden orphreys.{23}    A Midnight Mass is now celebrated in many Anglican churches, but this is  purely a modern revival. The most distinct British _survival_ is to be  found in Wales in the early service known as _Plygain_ (dawn), sometimes  a celebration of the Communion. At Tenby at four o'clock on Christmas  morning it was customary for the young men of the town to escort the  rector with lighted torches from his house to the church. Extinguishing  their torches in the porch, they went in to the early service, and when  it was ended the torches were relighted and the procession returned to  the rectory. At St. Peter's Church, Carmarthen, an early service was  held, to the light of coloured candles brought by the congregation. At  St. Asaph, Caerwys, at 4 or 5 a.m., _Plygain_, consisting of carols sung  round the church in procession, was held.{24} The _Plygain_ continued in  Welsh churches until about the eighteen-fifties, and, curiously enough,  when the Established Church abandoned it, it was celebrated in  Nonconformist chapels.{25}    In the Isle of Man on Christmas Eve, or _Oiel Verry_ (Mary's Eve), \"a  number of persons used to assemble in each parish church and proceed to  shout carols or 'Carvals.' There was no unison or concert about the  chanting, but a single person would stand up with a lighted candle in his  or her hand, and chant in a dismal monotone verse after verse of some old  Manx 'Carval,' until the candle was burnt out. Then another person would  start up and go through a similar performance. No fresh candles might be  lighted after the clock had chimed midnight.\"{26}    One may conjecture that the common English practice of ringing bells  until midnight on Christmas Eve has also some connection with the  old-time Midnight Mass.           *       *       *       *       *    For the Greek Church Christmas is a comparatively unimportant festival by  the side of the Epiphany, the celebration of |100| Christ's Baptism;  the Christmas offices are, however, full of fine poetry. There is far  less restraint, far less adherence to the words of Scripture, far greater  richness of original composition, in the Greek than in the Roman  service-books, and while there is less poignancy there is more amplitude  and splendour. Christmas Day, with the Greeks, is a commemoration of the  coming of the Magi as well as of the Nativity and the adoration of the  shepherds, and the Wise Men are very prominent in the services. The  following hymn of St. Anatolius (fifth century), from the First Vespers  of the feast, is fairly typical of the character of the Christmas  offices:--       \"When Jesus Our Lord was born of Her,      The Holy Virgin, all the universe      Became enlightened.      For as the shepherds watched their flocks,      And as the Magi came to pray,      And as the Angels sang their hymn      Herod was troubled; for God in flesh appeared,      The Saviour of our souls.        Thy kingdom, Christ our God, the kingdom is      Of all the worlds, and Thy dominion      O'er every generation bears the sway,      Incarnate of the Holy Ghost,      Man of the Ever-Virgin"]]]
