It was very  thoughtful and kind, and my daughter seems quite to have fallen in  love with him.    \"I hope that in a few days my husband will be able to see you. He  does not know that you are here. If he did, I am sure that he would  wish to see you now; but the surgeons have insisted so strongly on  absolute quiet, that I dare not let him hear of your coming.\"    \"I am delighted to learn that he is going on so well, madame. I  sincerely trust that he will not long remain an invalid.\"    \"I suppose you would not have recognized me?\" the countess asked.    \"I should not, indeed. Of course, I could do nothing to aid you,  and was chiefly occupied by the count. But indeed, you were then so  pale that I might well be excused for not knowing you again.\"    The countess was a very handsome woman, of some seven or eight and  thirty, with a noble figure and a gracious air; and bore no  resemblance to the almost distraught woman, with her hair falling  over her face, whom he had seen before.    \"I am not a coward, Mr. Drummond,\" she said, \"and when those  villains first ran in and attacked my husband, I struggled  desperately with the two who seized me; until I saw him drop, as I  believed, dead. Then my strength suddenly left me, and I should  have fallen to the ground, had the men not thrown me back into the  chair. I have a vague recollection of seeing Thirza, who had  retired for the night but a minute or two previously, carried in  bound and gagged. They asked me several questions, but I could not  reply; and I think they learned from the frightened servants where  the family jewels were kept. The clashing of swords and the firing  of pistols roused me a little, and after it was all over, and I  heard you say that my husband was still living, my heart gave one  bound, and I knew nothing more of what happened until next day.\"    After chatting for a short time longer Fergus took his leave, well  pleased to have got through a visit he had somewhat dreaded.    The king remained for nearly a month at Dresden, engaged in  carrying on negotiations with the Elector. By this delay he lost  most of the advantages that his sudden movement had given him; but  he was most anxious to detach Saxony and Poland from the  confederacy against him, as he would then be able to turn his  attention wholly to Austria, aided by the Saxons, while the Poles  would aid his army in the east to keep the Russians in check. The  Elector of Saxony--who was also King of Poland--however, was only  negotiating in order to give time for Austria to gather an army in  Bohemia; and so to relieve the Saxons, who were watched by the  eastern column, which had crossed the defiles into Bohemia and  taken post near Koeniggraetz; while that of Prince Maurice of  Brunswick pushed forward farther, to threaten their line of retreat  from the west.    The king at last became convinced that the King of Poland was but  trifling with him, and in the last week of September started to  take the command of the centre, which was facing the entrance to  the defile, at Pirna. Marshal Keith had been sent, a week after  Fergus was wounded, to assume the command of the western column,  hitherto commanded by Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick.    Fergus remained behind for ten days, at the end of which time he  felt perfectly fit for service again. He still carried his arm in a  sling, but a generous diet and good wine had filled his veins  again, and upon the day the king left he rode with Karl to rejoin  the marshal.    He had been several times over to the chateau, and had on the last  occasion seen the count; who, although still terribly weak, was now  out of danger, and able to sit on a couch, propped up by pillows.  His thanks were as earnest as those of the countess had been and,  having heard that Fergus was to start on the following morning to  join the army on the frontier, he said to him:    \"There is no saying how far your king may carry his arms, nor where  you may find yourself. The countess will, therefore, write letters  addressed to intimate friends at various large towns; telling them  that you have placed us under a vast obligation, and praying them  to do, for our sake, all in their power for you, under whatever  circumstances you may arrive there. She will write them on small  pieces of paper, each with its name and address on the back, so  that they will make a small and compact packet, not much bigger  than an ordinary letter.    \"I trust that when you return to Dresden, lieutenant, I shall be  able, myself, to do my best to prove my gratitude for your  services.\"    After taking leave of the count, his wife, and daughter, Fergus  rode back to the royal quarters. As Karl took his horse, he said:    \"Herr lieutenant, I know not how we are going to manage.\"    \"In what way, Karl?\"    \"Two magnificent horses, complete with saddlery, holsters, and  pistols, arrived here half an hour since. The man who brought them  said they were from Count Eulenfurst, and handed me this note:    \"'Pray accept the horses we send you, as a feeble token of our  gratitude. May they, by their speed and staunchness, carry you  unharmed through dangers well nigh as great as those you faced for  us.'\"    Fergus walked by the side of the soldier as he led the horse round  to the stable.    \"There, sir,\" Karl said, pointing to a pair of splendid animals;  \"they are fit for a king.\"    \"'Tis a noble gift, and indeed, I doubt whether the king himself  has such horses in his stables. The question is, what is to be done  with them? My present charger is an excellent one and, as a gift of  the marshal, I could not part with it. As to the others, it is out  of the question that I can take both. It would be altogether  contrary to rules. I am entitled to forage for two horses--that is,  when forage is to be had.    \"Ah! I see what had best be done. Come to my room with me. I will  give you a letter to the count.\"    He wrote as follows:    \"Dear Count Eulenfurst,    \"I cannot refuse the noble gift that you have made me, and thank  you and the countess for it, with all my heart. At present,  however, it places me in a difficulty. Aides-de-camp are allowed to  take only two horses; indeed, my orderly could not take with him  more than one led horse. The animal I have was the gift of Marshal  Keith. That being so, you will see that I could not part with it.  The only solution, therefore, that occurs to me is to beg you to  add to your kindness, by taking care of the one that I send back to  you by the bearer, until I return to Dresden; or find means to send  for it, in the event of one of the others being killed.    \"The only fault with your gifts is that they ought to be kept for  state reviews, or grand occasions; for it seems wrong to take such  noble creatures into the midst of a heavy fire. I am sure that I  shall feel more nervous, lest a ball should injure my horse, than I  shall do for my own safety.\"    When he had folded and sealed this, he handed it to Karl, who had  followed shortly after him.    \"I am sending back one of the horses, Karl, and asking the count to  take care of it for me, until I return or send for it. Do you see  any difference between them?\"    \"It would be hard to pick the best, lieutenant. They both struck me  as being perfect in all points--both are four years old.\"    \"Well then, you must take one at random, Karl. Had one been better  than the other, I should have left it behind. As it is, take  whichever you choose.\"    \"The man who brought them told me, sir, that both were bred on the  count's estates; and that he prided himself on having some of the  best blood in Europe, both for beauty and stamina. He thought this  pair were the pick of the stables.\"    \"I almost wish I could leave them both behind, but I could not do  so without hurting the feelings of the count and countess. But they  are too good for an aide-de-camp's work.\"    \"I don't think anything can be too good for that, sir. An  aide-de-camp wants a horse that will stop at nothing; and sometimes  he has to ride for his life, pursued by the enemy's cavalry. You  will be the envy of the division, on one of those horses.\"    Karl returned an hour later with a message from the countess,  saying that she could not disturb her husband, who was then  resting, but that she understood Mr. Drummond's difficulty, and  they should be very glad to take care of the horse for him, until  he wanted it.    \"You did not see the countess, I suppose, Karl?\"    \"Yes, sir, I saw her. She had me taken upstairs to her room. She  asked if I was your servant, and when I said yes, she told me that  she hoped I would take great care of you. I said that was my duty.    \"'Nevertheless, do more than your duty,' she said. 'His life is a  very precious one to us.    \"'Is it not, Thirza?'    \"The young lady nodded.    \"'Here are five gold crowns for yourself,' she went on, handing me  the money. 'They may help to make your bivouac more comfortable.    \"'And now,' she said, 'there is something else, but I do not wish  you to tell your master.'    \"What am I to do, your honour?\"    \"You had better keep it to yourself, Karl,\" Fergus laughed. \"I  daresay I shall hear of it, someday.\"    \"Very well, lieutenant, then that is all there is to report.\"    The next morning Fergus started early. Two days previously, a  Prussian governor had been appointed to Dresden, and three thousand  men were left under his command. Similar appointments were also  made to all the fortified towns in Saxony; for now that the  negotiations were broken off, and the King of Poland had declared  finally for the Confederates, Saxony was to be treated as a  conquered country. Nevertheless, strict injunctions were given that  all cattle, wheat, and other provisions taken for the use of the  garrisons, or for storing up in fortresses whence it might be  forwarded to the army, were to be paid for; and that any act of  pillage or ill treatment was to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19715"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Norwich (#14)"],[1,"e, and for having usurped to himself the deanery of  the church of Salisbury.\"    The dispute was referred to the Pope at Sens, where John of Oxford, with  his fellow-ambassador, Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of London, repaired; John  of Oxford was rebuked by the Pontiff for his misconduct, but  diplomatically managed to effect his end and retain his deanery. Henry  had met Becket at Chaumont, through the mediation of the Archbishop of  Sens, and, the quarrel being patched up, John of Oxford was sent to  escort him to England. He landed, December 1, at Sandwich, in the year  1170, and within the month was murdered at Canterbury.    In 1175, the incursion of William of Scotland was checked, and the king  himself taken prisoner by Ranulph de Glanville. John of Oxford and  others were commissioned to settle terms of peace; and they executed the  treaty of Falaice, afterwards ratified by King Henry at York, by which  the Scottish king and his barons were under the necessity of doing  homage for their possessions. John of Oxford, who had rendered good  service to his sovereign, was rewarded by promotion to the vacant see of  Norwich; and during his episcopate sent by the king on an embassy to  William, King of Sicily, to convey his majesty's consent to the marriage  of his daughter Joan with that monarch.    An important step in the administration of justice was taken during this  reign--the king divided the country into six circuits, to which certain  prelates and nobles were to be sent at certain times to hear suits and  save litigants the trouble of attending the king's court at Westminster.  John of Oxford was one of a company of five to whom was given  jurisdiction over a portion of the country, from Norwich down to Sussex,  and from Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire eastward to the coast.    On the 9th of July 1189, King Henry died, and was succeeded by his third  son, Richard: John of Oxford assisting at the coronation. Richard had  no sooner been crowned than he led the crusade to the Holy Land, which  had been preparing in Henry's time, and John of Oxford was forced to  proceed to the Pope to ask for his absolution of the oath he had taken  to follow the Cross, on account of his old age and infirmity. This  request being granted, for which he had to pay 10,000 marks, he returned  to England.    The last public act of John of Oxford--who was one of the most  remarkable men who have held the see of Norwich--was most probably his  attendance at the coronation of King John. He died June 2, 1200.    #John de Grey# (1200-1214) was elected by the monks, and his election  being confirmed by King John, he was consecrated by Hubert, Archbishop  of Canterbury. It was during his episcopate, and through the quarrel  between King John and the Pope, that the power of the latter was at  length firmly established--a supremacy that was unquestioned until the  sixteenth century.    The metropolitan see of Canterbury fell vacant in 1205; the sub-prior,  who was surreptitiously elected by the monks, and unknown to the king,  travelled to Rome for the Pope's sanction of his appointment. When the  king became aware of this he was enraged, and despatched an embassy  upholding his nominee, John de Grey. The Pope pleased neither party, and  named Stephen Langton as Hubert's successor. The Pope, Innocent, sent  two legates, of whom Pandulph was one, in 1211 to England, and on John  declining to recognise the Papal claims, he was deposed, and his crown  offered to the French king Philip.    The country had been placed under an interdict, and most of the bishops  had left the country. John de Grey remained faithful to the king, and  actually invaded France with a small force to attack the invading  Philip, but soon was forced to retreat. In the end, John submitted,  resigned his crown, which was restored to him, and was compelled to pay  to the Church as damages 40,000 marks. John de Grey, who had been sent  to Rome to arrange this, died on the return journey at S. Jean d'Angelo,  near Poictiers, 18th October 1214.    #Pandulph Masca# (1222-1226) was consecrated Bishop of Norwich by  Honorius, 29th May 1222. He is supposed to have been a member of a noble  Pisan family, and in 1211 had been sent by Pope Innocent to humble King  John, which he successfully did. He was again employed as Papal Legate  during the young King Henry II.'s minority, and died in Italy, 16th  September 1226, having played a prominent part as politician and  mediator.    #Thomas de Blunville# (1226-1236), the nephew of Hubert de Burgh, Lord  Chief-Justice of England, was consecrated in St. Catherine's Chapel at  Westminster by Stephen, Archbishop of Canterbury. He died in 1236, and  was succeeded by #Ralph de Norwich#, of whom but little is known; and is  even supposed to have died before his consecration.    #William de Ralegh# was consecrated on the 25th September 1239 at St.  Paul's by Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury. He had been a chaplain  of King Henry, and having received the education of a lawyer, from  1224-35 he visited various parts of the kingdom as a justiciary. On the  death of Peter de Rupibus he was elected to the see at Winchester by the  monks, in direct defiance of the king. The Pope's intervention in the  end secured him his see. He died at Tours in 1250.    #Walter de Suffield# (1245-57) was elected bishop by the monks after  Ralegh's translation. He chiefly busied himself in building and  beautifying the cathedral, and there is no record that he took any  prominent part in politics. He superintended a general inquisition  (known as the Norwich taxation) into the value of the Church revenues  throughout the whole of England. He died May 18, 1257, during a visit to  Colchester.    #Simon de Walton# (1258-66) was consecrated by Boniface, Archbishop of  Canterbury, on March 10, 1258. He held (in 1246) the office of  justice-itinerant. Of his administration little is known. He was past  seventy when he assumed the charge of the diocese. The barons under De  Montfort had beaten the king's army at Lewes, in 1264, and in 1266, from  their encampment in the Isle of Ely, attacked and sacked the city. Simon  de Walton died January 2, 1266.    #Roger de Skerming# (1266-78) was elected by the monks, and was  consecrated by Geoffrey Rages in St. Paul's Cathedral in April 1266. It  was during his episcopate that the disturbance occurred between the  monks and citizens over the annual fair held on Trinity Sunday, in  Tombland. He died January 2, 1278.    [Illustration: The Guildhall.]    #William de Middleton# (1278-88) was consecrated at Lambeth by the  Archbishop of Canterbury on May 29, 1278, and was enthroned, and the  Cathedral re-dedicated after the sacrilege and fire, on Advent Sunday,  1278, when Edward I. and his queen were present. He was appointed a  guardian of the realm, 1279, during the king's absence in France;  Archdeacon of Canterbury in 1276; and also steward of Bordeaux. He died  September 1, 1288, at Terling, in Essex, and his remains were carried in  state to Norwich, and there buried in the Lady Chapel.    #Ralph de Walpole# (1289-99) was of Norfolk extraction, and an  archdeacon of Ely. He was consecrated to the see on Mid-lent Sunday,  1289, at Canterbury, by John Peckham archbishop. His election, however,  was displeasing to the diocese. He was translated to Ely in 1299.    #John Salmon# (1299-1325), prior of Ely, had been elected bishop by the  monks, but was appointed to the see at Norwich at the same time that  Walpole was translated to Ely. He was consecrated by Archbishop  Winchelsey October 3, at Canterbury, and was one of the envoys sent to  the Court of Philip the Fair King of France, to arrange the marriage of  the young king Edward II. (1307). He was appointed chancellor of the  realm in 1320. He also went to France again in 1325; and it was on his  return that he died July 6, 1325.    #William de Ayerminne# (1325-36) was elected to the see by papal bull in  1325, and this overruled the election by the monks of Robert de Baldock.  Ayerminne was consecrated to the see September 15, 1325. He had held a  prebendal stall at St. Paul's in 1313 and in the next year at Lincoln.  In 1324 he was sent as ambassador to Robert Bruce to treat for peace. He  died at Charing, March 27, 1336; and was buried in the cathedral before  the high altar. He appears to have been cunning and crafty, and not  above changing his political views when occasion demanded.    #Anthony de Beck# (1337-43) was nominated by the Pope, the monks having  chosen Thomas de Hemenhale, who however, went to Worcester. Both were  consecrated to their respective dioceses by the Pope at Avignon March  30, 1337. He had been Dean of Lincoln. In 1342 he resisted the  Archbishop Stratford's visitation; this must have been a foretaste to  the monks of his imperious temper. In 1343 he was poisoned by his own  servants.    #William Bateman# (1344-54), of a Norwich family, had been archdeacon of  Norwich, chaplain to the Pope, and dean of Lincoln. He was consecrated  by the Pope at Avignon, 23rd May 1344. During his episcopate in (Edward  III.'s reign) 1349, Norwich was visited by \"Black Death\"; over 51,000  are supposed to have fallen victims to the dread plague. He founded  Trinity Hall at Cambridge, 1350; was sent to Rome on an embassy there.  He died January 6, 1354. He was buried at the church of St. Mary of  Avignon.    #Thomas Percy# (1355-69), brother of Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland,  against the wishes of the monks, was elected to the see. He was  consecrated January 3, 1355, at Waverly, in Surrey, by the Bishops of  Winchester, Sarum, and Chichester. The nobility at this time were  securing church preferments for their families to keep pace with the  formation of the professions and general advance of learning. He died  August 8, 1369, and was buried in the cathedral, before the rood loft.    #Henry le Dispencer# (1370-1406) was consecrated at Rome, 21st"]]]
