The end of this development forms the so-called  normal sexual life of the adult in which the acquisition of pleasure has  been put into the service of the function of propagation, and the  partial impulses, under the primacy of one single erogenous zone, have  formed a firm organization for the attainment of the sexual aim in a  strange sexual object.    *Pregenital Organizations.*--The study, with the help of  psychoanalysis, of the inhibitions and disturbances in this course of  development now permits us to recognize additions and primary stages of  such organization of the partial impulses which likewise furnish a sort  of sexual regime. These phases of the sexual organization normally will  pass over smoothly and will only be recognizable by slight indications.  Only in pathological cases do they become active and discernible to  coarse observation.    Organizations of the sexual life in which the genital zones have not yet  assumed the dominating role we would call the _pregenital_ phase. So far  we have become acquainted with two of them which recall reversions to  early animal states.    One of the first of such pregenital sexual organizations is the _oral_,  or if we wish, the cannibalistic. Here the sexual activity is not yet  separated from the taking of nourishment, and the contrasts within the  same not yet differentiated. The object of the one activity is also that  of the other, the sexual aim consists in the _incorporating_ into one's  own body of the object, it is the prototype of that which later plays  such an important psychic role as _identification_. As a remnant of this  fictitious phase of organization forced on us by pathology we can  consider thumbsucking. Here the sexual activity became separated from  the nourishment activity and the strange object was given up in favor of  one from his own body.    A second pregenital phase is the sadistic-anal organization. Here the  contrasts which run through the whole sexual life are already developed,  but cannot yet be designated as _masculine_ and _feminine_, but must be  called _active_ and _passive_. The activity is supplied by the  musculature of the body through the mastery impulse; the erogenous  mucous membrane of the bowel manifests itself above all as an organ with  a passive sexual aim, for both strivings there are objects present,  which however do not merge together. Besides them there are other  partial impulses which are active in an autoerotic manner. The sexual  polarity and the strange object can thus already be demonstrated in this  phase. The organization and subordination under the function of  propagation are still lacking.    *Ambivalence.*--This form of the sexual organization could be retained  throughout life and continue to draw to itself a large part of the  sexual activity. The prevalence of sadism and the role of the cloaca of  the anal zone stamps it with an exquisitely archaic impression. As  another characteristic belonging to it we can mention the fact that the  contrasting pair of impulses are developed in almost the same manner, a  behavior which was designated by Bleuler with the happy name of  _ambivalence_.    The assumption of the pregenital organizations of the sexual life is  based on the analysis of the neuroses and hardly deserves any  consideration without a knowledge of the same. We may expect that  continued analytic efforts will furnish us with still more disclosures  concerning the structure and development of the normal sexual function.    To complete the picture of the infantile sexual life one must add that  frequently or regularly an object selection takes place even in  childhood which is as characteristic as the one we have represented for  the phase of development of puberty. This object selection proceeds in  such a manner that all the sexual strivings proceed in the direction of  one person in whom they wish to attain their aim. This is then the  nearest approach to the definitive formation of the sexual life after  puberty, that is possible in childhood. It differs from the latter only  in the fact that the collection of the partial impulses and their  subordination to the primacy of the genitals is very imperfectly or not  at all accomplished in childhood. The establishment of this primacy in  the service of propagation is therefore the last phase through which the  sexual organization passes.    *The Two Periods of Object Selection.*--That the object selection takes  place in two periods, or in two shifts, can be spoken of as a typical  occurrence. The first shift has its origin between the age of three and  five years, and is brought to a stop or to retrogression by the latency  period; it is characterized by the infantile nature of its sexual aims.  The second shift starts with puberty and determines the definitive  formation of the sexual life.    The fact of the double object selection which is essentially due to the  effect of the latency period, becomes most significant for the  disturbance of this terminal state. The results of the infantile object  selection reach into the later period; they are either preserved as such  or are even refreshed at the time of puberty. But due to the development  of the repression which takes place between the two phases they turn out  as unutilizable. The sexual aims have become softened and now represent  what we can designate as the _tender_ streams of the sexual life. Only  psychoanalytic investigation can demonstrate that behind this  tenderness, such as honoring and esteeming, there is concealed the old  sexual strivings of the infantile partial impulses which have now become  useless. The object selection of the pubescent period must renounce the  infantile objects and begin anew as a sensuous stream. The fact that the  two streams do not meet often enough has as a result that one of the  ideals of the sexual life, namely, the union of all desires in one  object, can not be attained.      THE SOURCES OF THE INFANTILE SEXUALITY    In our effort to follow up the origins of the sexual impulse, we have  thus far found that the sexual excitement originates (_a_) as an imitation  of a gratification which has been experienced in conjunction with other  organic processes; (_b_) through the appropriate peripheral stimulation of  erogenous zones; (_c_) and as an expression of some \"impulse,\" like the  looking and cruelty impulses, the origin of which we do not yet fully  understand. The psychoanalytic investigation of later life which leads  back to childhood and the contemporary observation of the child itself  cooeperate to reveal to us still other regularly-flowing sources of the  sexual excitement. The observation of childhood has the disadvantage of  treating easily misunderstood material, while psychoanalysis is made  difficult by the fact that it can reach its objects and conclusions only  by great detours; still the united efforts of both methods achieve a  sufficient degree of positive understanding.    In investigating the erogenous zones we have already found that these  skin regions merely show the special exaggeration of a form of  sensitiveness which is to a certain degree found over the whole surface  of the skin. It will therefore not surprise us to learn that certain  forms of general sensitiveness in the skin can be ascribed to very  distinct erogenous action. Among these we will above all mention the  temperature sensitiveness; this will perhaps prepare us for the  understanding of the therapeutic effects of warm baths.    *Mechanical Excitation.*--We must, moreover, describe here the  production of sexual excitation by means of rhythmic mechanical shaking  of the body. There are three kinds of exciting influences: those acting  on the sensory apparatus of the vestibular nerves, those acting on the  skin, and those acting on the deep parts, such as the muscles and  joints. The sexual excitation produced by these influences seems to be  of a pleasurable nature--it is worth emphasizing that for some time we  shall continue to use indiscriminately the terms \"sexual excitement\" and  \"gratification\" leaving the search for an explanation of the terms to a  later time--and that the pleasure is produced by mechanical stimulation  is proved by the fact that children are so fond of play involving  passive motion, like swinging or flying in the air, and repeatedly  demand its repetition.[20] As we know, rocking is regularly used in  putting restless children to sleep. The shaking sensation experienced in  wagons and railroad trains exerts such a fascinating influence on older  children, that all boys, at least at one time in their lives, want to  become conductors and drivers. They are wont to ascribe to railroad  activities an extraordinary and mysterious interest, and during the age  of phantastic activity (shortly before puberty) they utilize these as a  nucleus for exquisite sexual symbolisms. The desire to connect railroad  travelling with sexuality apparently originates from the pleasurable  character of the sensation of motion. When the repression later sets in  and changes so many of the childish likes into their opposites, these  same persons as adolescents and adults then react to the rocking and  rolling with nausea and become terribly exhausted by a railroad journey,  or they show a tendency to attacks of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14970"],[0,"Academica (#14)"],[1,"de  sensibus ipsis quaedam dixit nova, quos iunctos esse censuit e quadam quasi  impulsione oblata extrinsecus, quam ille [Greek: phantasian], nos visum  appellemus licet, et teneamus hoc verbum quidem: erit enim utendum in  reliquo sermone saepius. Sed ad haec, quae visa sunt et quasi accepta  sensibus, adsensionem adiungit animorum, quam esse volt in nobis positam et  voluntariam. 41. Visis non omnibus adiungebat fidem, sed iis solum, quae  propriam quandam haberent declarationem earum rerum, quae viderentur: id  autem visum, cum ipsum per se cerneretur, comprehendibile--feretis hoc? Nos  vero, inquit. Quonam enim modo [Greek: katalepton] diceres?--Sed, cum  acceptum iam et approbatum esset, comprehensionem appellabat, similem iis  rebus, quae manu prehenderentur: ex quo etiam nomen hoc duxerat, cum eo  verbo antea nemo tali in re usus esset, plurimisque idem novis verbis--nova  enim dicebat--usus est. Quod autem erat sensu comprehensum, id ipsum sensum  appellabat, et si ita erat comprehensum, ut convelli ratione non posset,  scientiam: sin aliter, inscientiam nominabat: ex qua exsisteret etiam  opinio, quae esset imbecilla et cum falso incognitoque communis. 42. Sed  inter scientiam et inscientiam comprehensionem illam, quam dixi,  collocabat, eamque neque in rectis neque in pravis numerabat, sed soli  credendum esse dicebat. E quo sensibus etiam fidem tribuebat, quod, ut  supra dixi, comprehensio facta sensibus et vera esse illi et fidelis  videbatur, non quod omnia, quae essent in re, comprehenderet, sed quia  nihil quod cadere in eam posset relinqueret quodque natura quasi normam  scientiae et principium sui dedisset, unde postea notiones rerum in animis  imprimerentur, e quibus non principia solum, sed latiores quaedam ad  rationem inveniendam viae reperiuntur. Errorem autem et temeritatem et  ignorantiam et opinationem et suspicionem et uno nomine omnia, quae essent  aliena firmae et constantis adsensionis, a virtute sapientiaque removebat.  Atque in his fere commutatio constitit omnis dissensioque Zenonis a  superioribus.    XII. 43. Quae cum dixisset: Breviter sane minimeque obscure exposita est,  inquam, a te, Varro, et veteris Academiae ratio et Stoicorum: verum esse  [autem] arbitror, ut Antiocho, nostro familiari, placebat, correctionem  veteris Academiae potius quam aliquam novam disciplinam putandam. Tunc  Varro: Tuae sunt nunc partes, inquit, qui ab antiquorum ratione desciscis  et ea, quae ab Arcesila novata sunt, probas, docere quod et qua de causa  discidium factum sit, ut videamus satisne ista sit iusta defectio. 44. Tum  ego: Cum Zenone, inquam, ut accepimus, Arcesilas sibi omne certamen  instituit, non pertinacia aut studio vincendi, ut mihi quidem videtur, sed  earum rerum obscuritate, quae ad confessionem ignorationis adduxerant  Socratem et iam ante Socratem Democritum, Anaxagoram, Empedoclem, omnis  paene veteres: qui nihil cognosci, nihil percipi, nihil sciri posse  dixerunt: angustos sensus, imbecillos animos, brevia curricula vitae et, ut  Democritus, in profundo veritatem esse demersam, opinionibus et institutis  omnia teneri, nihil veritati relinqui, deinceps omnia tenebris circumfusa  esse dixerunt. 45. Itaque Arcesilas negabat esse quicquam quod sciri  posset, ne illud quidem ipsum, quod Socrates sibi reliquisset: sic omnia  latere censebat in occulto: neque esse quicquam quod cerni aut intellegi  posset: quibus de causis nihil oportere neque profiteri neque adfirmare  quemquam neque adsensione approbare, cohibereque semper et ab omni lapsu  continere temeritatem, quae tum esset insignis, cum aut falsa aut incognita  res approbaretur, neque hoc quicquam esse turpius quam cognitioni et  perceptioni adsensionem approbationemque praecurrere. Huic rationi quod  erat consentaneum faciebat, ut contra omnium sententias dicens in eam  plerosque deduceret, ut cum in eadem re paria contrariis in partibus  momenta rationum invenirentur, facilius ab utraque parte adsensio  sustineretur. 46.

Carneades autem nullius philosophiae  partis ignarus et, ut cognovi ex iis, qui illum audierant, maximeque ex  Epicureo Zenone, qui cum ab eo plurimum dissentiret, unum tamen praeter  ceteros mirabatur, incredibili quadam fuit facultate....           *       *       *       *       *    ACADEMICORUM POSTERIORUM FRAGMENTA.
