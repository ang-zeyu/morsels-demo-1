Floss and Elinor  made merry over some verses Margaret had handed up with a blush. Helen  apparently lapsed into a brooding abstraction. And presently Dorothy  excused herself, and kissing Margaret good-bye, left for home.    The instant she had gone Margaret's gay and reminiscent mood underwent  a change.    \"Girls, I want to know what Daren Lane did or said on Friday night at  Fanchon's,\" spoke up Margaret. \"You know mother dragged me home. Said  I was tired. But I wasn't. It was only because I'm a wall-flower....  So I missed what happened. But I've heard talk enough to make me crazy  to know about this scandal. Kit Benson was here and she hinted things.  I met Bessy Bell. She asked me if I knew. She's wild about Daren. That  yellow-legged broiler! He doesn't even know her.... My brother Blair  would not tell me anything. He's strong for Daren. But mother told me  Daren had lost his standing in Middleville. She always hated Daren.  Afraid I'd fall in love with him. The idea! I liked him, and I like  him better now--poor fellow!... And last, when El mentioned Daren, did  you see Dal's face? I never saw Dal look like that.\"    \"Neither did I,\" replied Elinor.    \"Well, I have,\" spoke up Helen, with all of her mother's bluntness.  \"Dal always was love-sick over Daren, when she was a mere kid. She  never got over it and never will.\"    \"Still water runs deep,\" sapiently remarked Elinor. \"There's a good  deal in Dal. She's fine as silk. Of course we all remember how jealous  she was of other girls when Daren went with her. But I think now it's  because she's sorry for Daren. So am I. He was such a fool. Fanchon  swears no nice girl in Middleville will ever dance that new camel-walk  dance in public again.\"    \"What did Daren say?\" demanded Margaret, with eyes lighting.    \"I was standing with Helen, and Fanchon when Daren came up. He  looked--I don't know how--just wonderful. We all knew something was  doing. Daren bowed to Fanchon and said to her in a perfectly clear  voice that everybody heard: 'I'd like to try your camel-walk. I'm out  of practice and not strong, but I can go once around, I'm sure. Will  you?'\"    'You're on, Dare,' replied Fanchon.    Then he asked. 'Do you like it?'    'I'll say so, Dare--crazy about it.'    'Of course you know why it's danced--and how it's interpreted by  men,' said Daren.    'What do you mean?' asked Fanchon, growing red and flustered.    \"Then Daren said: 'I'll tell your mother. If she lets you dance with  that understanding--all right.' He bent over Mrs. Smith and said  something. Mrs. Wrapp heard it. And so did Mrs. Mackay, who looked  pretty sick. Mrs. Smith nearly _fainted_!... but she recovered enough  to order Daren to leave.\"    \"Do you know what Daren said?\" demanded Margaret, in a frenzy of  excitement.    \"No. None of the girls know. We can only imagine. That makes it worse.  If Fanchon knows she won't tell. But it is gossip all over town. We'll  hear it soon. All the girls in town are imagining. It's spread like  wildfire. And what _do_ you think, Margie? In church--on  Sunday--Doctor Wallace spoke of it. He mentioned no names. But he said  that as the indecent dress and obscene dance of the young women could  no longer be influenced by the home or the church it was well that one  young man had the daring to fling the truth into the faces of their  mothers.\"    \"Oh, it was rotten of Daren,\" replied Margaret, with tears in her  eyes. She was ashamed, indignant, incredulous. \"For him to do a thing  like that! He's always been the very prince of gentlemen. What on  earth possessed him? Heaven knows the dances are vile, but that  doesn't excuse Daren Lane. What do I care what Doctor Wallace said?  Never in a thousand years will Mrs. Smith or mother or any one forgive  him. Fanchon Smith is a little snob. I always hated her. She's  spiteful and catty. She's a flirt all the way. She would dance any old  thing. But that's not the point. Daren's disgraced himself. It was  rotten--of him. And--I'll never--forgive--him, either.\"    \"Don't cry, Margie,\" said Elinor. \"It always makes your eyes red and  gives you a headache. Poor Daren made a blunder. But some of us will  stick to him. Don't take it so badly.\"    \"Margie, it was rotten of Daren, one way you look at it--our way,\"  added Flossie. \"But you have to hand it to him for that stunt.\"    Helen Wrapp preserved her sombre mood, silent and brooding.    \"Margie,\" went on Elinor, \"there's a lot back of this. If Dare Lane  could do that there must be some reason for it. Maybe we all needed a  jolt. Well, we've got it. Let's stand by Daren. I will. Helen will.  Floss will. You will. And surely Dal will.\"    \"If you ask _me_ I'll say Dare Lane ought to hand something to the  men!\" burst out Floss Dickerson, with fire in her eyes.    \"You said a mouthful, kiddo,\" responded Helen, with her narrow  contracted gaze upon Margaret. \"Daren gave me the once over--and then  the icepick!\"    \"Wonder what he gave poor Mel--when he heard about her,\" murmured  Elinor, thoughtfully.    \"Mel Iden ought to be roasted,\" retorted Helen. \"She was always so  darned superior. And all the time....\"    \"Helen, don't you say a word against Mel Iden,\" burst out Margaret,  hotly. \"She was my dearest friend. She was lovely. Her ruin was a  horrible shock. But it wasn't because she was bad.... Mel had some  fanatical notion about soldiers giving all--going away to be  slaughtered. She said to me, 'A woman's body is so little to give,'\"    \"Yes, I know Mel was cracked,\" replied Helen. \"But she needn't have  been a damn fool. She didn't need to have had that baby!\"    \"Helen, your idea of sin is to be found out,\" said Elinor, with  satire.    Again Floss Dickerson dropped her trenchant personality into the  breach.    \"Aw, come off!\" she ejaculated. \"Let somebody roast the men once, will  you? I'm the little Jane that _knows_, believe me. All this talk about  the girls going to hell makes me sick. We may be going--and going in  limousines--but it's the men who're stepping on the gas.\"    \"Floss, I love to hear you elocute,\" drawled Helen. \"Go to it! For  God's sake, roast the men.\"    \"You always have to horn in,\" retorted Floss. \"Let me get this off my  chest, will you?... We girls are getting talked about. There's no use  denying it. Any but a blind girl could see it. And it's because we do  what the men want. Every girl wants to go out--to be attractive--to  have fellows. But the price is getting high. They say in Middleville  that I'm rushed more than any other girl. Well, if I am I know what it  costs.... If I didn't 'pet'--if I didn't mush, if I didn't park my  corsets at dances--if I didn't drink and smoke, and wiggle like a  jelly-fish, I'd be a dead one--an egg, and don't you overlook that. If  any one says I _want_ to do these things he's a fool. But I do love to  have good times, and little by little I've been drawn on and on....  I've had my troubles staving off these fellows. Most of them get half  drunk. Some of the girls do, too. I never went that far. I always kept  my head. I never went the limit. But you can bet your sweet life it  wasn't their fault I didn't fall for them.... I'll say I've had to  walk home from more than one auto ride. There's something in the gag,  'I know she's a good girl because I met her walking home from an auto  ride.' That's one thing I intend to cut out this summer--the auto  rides. Nothing doing for little Flossie!\"    \"Oh, can't we talk of something else!\" complained Margaret, wearily,  with her hands pressing against her temples.          CHAPTER VI      Mrs. Maynard slowly went upstairs and along the hall to her daughter's  room. Margaret sat listlessly by a window. The girls had gone.    \"You were going for a long walk,\" said Mrs. Maynard.    \"I'm tired,\" replied Margaret. There was a shadow in her eyes.    The mother had never understood her daughter. And of late a subtle  change in Margaret had made her more of a puzzle.    \"Margaret, I want to talk seriously with you,\" she began.    \"Well?\"    \"Didn't I tell you I wanted you to break off your--your friendship  with Holt Dalrymple?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Margaret, with a flush. \"I did not--want to.\"    \"Well, the thing which concerns you now is--he can't be regarded as a  possibility for you.\"    \"Possibility?\" echoed Margaret.    \"Just that, exactly. I'm not sure of your thoughts on the matter, but  it's time I knew them. Holt is a ne'er-do-well. He's gone to the bad,  like so many of these army boys. No nice girl will ever associate with  him again.\"    \"Then I'm not nice, for I will,\" declared Margaret, spiritedly.    \"You will persist in your friendship for him in the face of my  objection?\"    \"Certainly I will if I have any say about it. But I know Holt. I--I  guess he has taken to drink--and carrying on. So you needn't worry  much about our friendship.\"    Mrs. Maynard hesitated. She had become accustomed to Margaret's little  bursts of fury and she expected one here. But none came; Margaret  appeared unnaturally calm; she sat still with her face turned to the  window. Mrs. Maynard was a little afraid of this cold, quiet girl.    \"Margaret, you can't help seeing now that your mother's judgment was  right. Holt Dalrymple once may have been very interesting and  attractive for a friend, but as a prospective husband he was  impossible. The worst I hear of him is that he drinks and gambles. I  know you liked him and I don't want to be unjust. But he has kept  other and better young men away from you.\"    Margaret's hand clenched and her face sank against the window-pane.    \"We need say no more about him,\" went on Mrs. Maynard. \"Margaret,  you've been brought up in luxury. If your father happened to die  now--he's far from well--we'd be left penniless. We've lived up every  dollar.... We have our poor crippled Blair to care for. You know you  must marry well. I've brought you up with that end in view."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15675"],[0,"A Voyage to New Holland, Etc. in the Year 1699 (#14)"],[1,"y. The  27th of April we saw a small brigantine under the shore plying to the  southward. We also saw many men-of-war-birds and boobies, and abundance  of albicore-fish. Having still fair weather, small gales, and some calms,  I had the opportunity of trying the current, which I found to set  sometimes northerly and sometimes southerly: and therefore knew I was  still within the verge of the tides. Being now in the latitude of the  Abrolho Shoals, which I expected to meet with, I sounded, and had water  lessening from 40 to 33 and so to 25 fathom: but then it rose again to  33, 35, 37, etc., all coral rocks. Whilst we were on this shoal (which we  crossed towards the further part of it from land, where it lay deep, and  so was not dangerous) we caught a great many fish with hook and line: and  by evening amplitude we had 6 degrees 38 minutes east variation. This was  the 27th of April; we were then in latitude 18 degrees 13 minutes south  and east longitude from Cape Salvador 31 minutes. On the 29th, being then  in latitude 18 degrees 39 minutes south, we had small gales from the  west-north-west to the west-south-west often shifting. The 30th we had  the winds from west to south-south-east, squalls and rain: and we saw  some dolphins and other fish about us. We were now out of sight of land  and had been so 4 or 5 days: but the winds now hanging in the south was  an apparent sign that we were still too nigh the shore to receive the  true general east trade; as the easterly winds we had before showed that  we were too far off the land to have the benefit of the coasting south  trade: and the faintness of both these winds, and their often shifting  from the south-south-west to the south-east with squalls, rain and small  gales, were a confirmation of our being between the verge of the south  coasting trade and that of the true trade; which is here regularly  south-east.    The 3rd of May, being in latitude 20 degrees 00 minutes and meridian  distance west from Cape Salvador 234 miles, the variation was 7 degrees  00 minutes. We saw no fowl but shearwaters, as our seamen call them,  being a small black fowl that sweep the water as they fly, and are much  in the seas that lie without either of the tropics: they are not eaten.  We caught 3 small sharks, each 6 foot 4 inches long; and they were very  good food for us. The next day we caught 3 more sharks of the same size,  and we ate them also, esteeming them as good fish, boiled and pressed,  and then stewed with vinegar and pepper.    EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF BIRDS ABOUT A DEAD WHALE; OF THE PINTADO BIRD, AND  THE PETREL, ETC.    We had nothing of remark from the 3rd of May to the 10th, only now and  then seeing a small whale spouting up the water. We had the wind easterly  and we ran with it to the southward, running in this time from the  latitude of 20 degrees 00 minutes to 29 degrees 5 minutes south, and  having then 7 degrees 3 minutes east longitude from Cape Salvador; the  variation increasing upon us at present, notwithstanding we went east. We  had all along a great difference between the morning and evening  amplitudes; usually a degree or two, and sometimes more. We were now in  the true trade, and therefore made good way to the southward to get  without the verge of the general tradewind into a westerly wind's way  that might carry us towards the Cape of Good Hope. By the 12th of May,  being in latitude 31 degrees 10 minutes we began to meet with westerly  winds, which freshened on us, and did not leave us till a little before  we made the Cape. Sometimes it blew so hard that it put us under a  fore-course; especially in the night; but in the daytime we had commonly  our main topsail reefed. We met with nothing of moment; only we passed by  a dead whale, and saw millions (as I may say) of sea-fowls about the  carcass (and as far round about it as we could see) some feeding, and the  rest flying about, or sitting on the water, waiting to take their turns.  We first discovered the whale by the fowls; for indeed I did never see so  many fowls at once in my life before, their numbers being inconceivably  great: they were of divers sorts, in bigness, shape and colour. Some were  almost as big as geese, of a grey colour, with white breasts, and with  such bills, wings, and tails. Some were pintado-birds, as big as ducks,  and speckled black and white. Some were shearwaters; some petrels; and  there were several sorts of large fowls. We saw of these birds,  especially pintado-birds, all the sea over from about 200 leagues distant  from the coast of Brazil to within much the same distance of New Holland.  The pintado is a southern bird, and of that temperate zone; for I never  saw of them much to the northward of 30 degrees south. The pintado-bird  is as big as a duck; but appears, as it flies, about the bigness of a  tame pigeon, having a short tail, but the wings very long, as most  sea-fowls have; especially such as these that fly far from the shore, and  seldom come nigh it; for their resting is sitting afloat upon the water;  but they lay, I suppose, ashore. There are three sorts of these birds,  all of the same make and bigness, and are only different in colour. The  first is black all over: the second sort are grey, with white bellies and  breasts. The third sort, which is the true pintado, or painted-bird, is  curiously spotted white and black. Their heads and the tips of their  wings and tails are black for about an inch; and their wings are also  edged quite round with such a small black list; only within the black on  the tip of their wings there is a white spot seeming as they fly (for  then their spots are best seen) as big as a half-crown. All this is on  the outside of the tails and wings; and, as there is a white spot in the  black tip of the wings, so there is in the middle of the wings which is  white, a black spot; but this, towards the back of the bird, turns  gradually to a dark grey. The back itself, from the head to the tip of  the tail, and the edge of the wings next to the back, are all over  spotted with fine small, round, white and black spots, as big as a silver  twopence, and as close as they can stick one by another: the belly,  thighs, sides, and inner part of the wings, are of a light grey. These  birds, of all these sorts, fly many together, never high, but almost  sweeping the water. We shot one a while after on the water in a calm, and  a water-spaniel we had with us brought it in: I have given a picture of  it, but it was so damaged that the picture doth not show it to advantage;  and its spots are best seen when the feathers are spread as it flies.    The petrel is a bird not much unlike a swallow, but smaller, and with a  shorter tail. It is all over black, except a white spot on the rump. They  fly sweeping like swallows, and very near the water. They are not so  often seen in fair weather; being foul-weather birds, as our seamen call  them, and presaging a storm when they come about a ship; who for that  reason don't love to see them. In a storm they will hover close under the  ship's stern in the wake of the ship (as it is called) or the smoothness  which the ship's passing has made on the sea; and there as they fly  (gently then) they pat the water alternately with their feet as if they  walked upon it; though still upon the wing. And from hence the seamen  give them the name of petrels in allusion to St. Peter's walking upon the  Lake of Gennesareth.    We also saw many bunches of seaweeds in the latitude of 39 32 and, by  judgment near, the meridian of the island Tristan d'Acunha: and then we  had about 2 degrees 20 minutes east variation: which was now again  decreasing as we ran to the eastward, till near the meridian of  Ascension; where we found little or no variation: but from thence, as we  ran farther to the east, our variation increased westerly.    OF A BIRD THAT SHOWS THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE TO BE NEAR: OF THE  SEA-RECKONINGS, AND VARIATIONS: AND A TABLE OF ALL THE VARIATIONS  OBSERVED IN THIS VOYAGE.    Two days before I made the Cape of Good Hope my variation was 7 degrees  58 minutes west. I was then in 43 degrees 27 minutes east longitude from  Cape Salvador, being in latitude 35 degrees 30 minutes, this was the  first of June. The second of June I saw a large black fowl, with a  whitish flat bill, fly by us; and took great notice of it, because in the  East India Waggoner, pilot-book, there is mention made of large fowls, as  big as ravens, with white flat bills and black feathers, that fly not  above 30 leagues from the Cape, and are looked on as a sign of one's  being near it. My reckoning made me then think myself above 90 leagues  from the Cape, according to the longitude which the Cape hath in the  common sea-charts: so that I was in some doubt whether these were the  right fowls spoken of in the Waggoner; or whether those fowls might not  fly farther off shore than is there mentioned; or whether, as it proved,  I might not be nearer the Cape than I reckoned myself to be; for I found,  soon after, that I was not then above 25 or 30 leagues at most from the  Cape. Whether the fault were in the charts laying down the Cape too much  to the east from Brazil, or were rather in our reckoning, I could not  tell: but our reckonings are liable to such uncertainties from steerage,  log, currents, half-minute-glasses; and sometimes want of care, as in so  long a run cause often a difference of many leagues in the whole account.    Most of my men that kept journals imputed it to the half-minute-glasses:  and indeed we had not a good glass in the ship beside the half-watch or  two-hour-glasses. As for our half-minute-glasses we tried them all at  several times, and we found those that we had used from Brazil as much  too short, as others we had used before were too long; which might well  make great errors in those several reckonings. A ship ought therefore to  have its glasses very exact; and besides, an"]]]
