For  not only does Fortune, as the old proverb says, assist the bold, but  reason does so in a still greater degree; for it, by certain precepts,  as it were, strengthens even courage itself. You were born naturally  great and soaring, and with a contempt for all things which pertain to  man alone; therefore a discourse against death took easy possession of  a brave soul. But do you imagine that these same arguments have any  force with those very persons who have invented, and canvassed, and  published them, excepting indeed some very few particular persons? For  how few philosophers will you meet with whose life and manners are  conformable to the dictates of reason! who look on their profession,  not as a means of displaying their learning, but as a rule for their  own practice! who follow their own precepts, and comply with their own  decrees! You may see some of such levity and such vanity, that it would  have been better for them to have been ignorant; some covetous of  money, some others eager for glory, many slaves to their lusts; so that  their discourses and their actions are most strangely at variance; than  which nothing in my opinion can be more unbecoming: for just as if one  who professed to teach grammar should speak with impropriety, or a  master of music sing out of tune, such conduct has the worst appearance  in these men, because they blunder in the very particular with which  they profess that they are well acquainted. So a philosopher who errs  in the conduct of his life is the more infamous because he is erring in  the very thing which he pretends to teach, and, while he lays down  rules to regulate life by, is irregular in his own life.    V. _A._ Should this be the case, is it not to be feared that you are  dressing up philosophy in false colors? For what stronger argument can  there be that it is of little use than that some very profound  philosophers live in a discreditable manner?    _M._ That, indeed, is no argument at all, for as all the fields which  are cultivated are not fruitful (and this sentiment of Accius is false,  and asserted without any foundation,        The ground you sow on is of small avail;      To yield a crop good seed can never fail),    it is not every mind which has been properly cultivated that produces  fruit; and, to go on with the comparison, as a field, although it may  be naturally fruitful, cannot produce a crop without dressing, so  neither can the mind without education; such is the weakness of either  without the other. Whereas philosophy is the culture of the mind: this  it is which plucks up vices by the roots; prepares the mind for the  receiving of seeds; commits them to it, or, as I may say, sows them, in  the hope that, when come to maturity, they may produce a plentiful  harvest. Let us proceed, then, as we began. Say, if you please, what  shall be the subject of our disputation.    _A._ I look on pain to be the greatest of all evils.    _M._ What, even greater than infamy?    _A._ I dare not indeed assert that; and I blush to think I am so soon  driven from my ground.    _M._ You would have had greater reason for blushing had you persevered  in it; for what is so unbecoming--what can appear worse to you, than  disgrace, wickedness, immorality? To avoid which, what pain is there  which we ought not (I will not say to avoid shirking, but even) of our  own accord to encounter, and undergo, and even to court?    _A._ I am entirely of that opinion; but, notwithstanding that pain is  not the greatest evil, yet surely it is an evil.    _M._ Do you perceive, then, how much of the terror of pain you have  given up on a small hint?    _A._ I see that plainly; but I should be glad to give up more of it.    _M._ I will endeavor to make you do so; but it is a great undertaking,  and I must have a disposition on your part which is not inclined to  offer any obstacles.    _A._ You shall have such: for as I behaved yesterday, so now I will  follow reason wherever she leads.    VI. _M._ First, then, I will speak of the weakness of many  philosophers, and those, too, of various sects; the head of whom, both  in authority and antiquity, was Aristippus, the pupil of Socrates, who  hesitated not to say that pain was the greatest of all evils. And after  him Epicurus easily gave in to this effeminate and enervated doctrine.  After him Hieronymus the Rhodian said, that to be without pain was the  chief good, so great an evil did pain appear to him to be. The rest,  with the exceptions of Zeno, Aristo, Pyrrho, were pretty much of the  same opinion that you were of just now--that it was indeed an evil, but  that there were many worse. When, then, nature herself, and a certain  generous feeling of virtue, at once prevents you from persisting in the  assertion that pain is the chief evil, and when you were driven from  such an opinion when disgrace was contrasted with pain, shall  philosophy, the preceptress of life, cling to this idea for so many  ages? What duty of life, what praise, what reputation, would be of such  consequence that a man should be desirous of gaining it at the expense  of submitting to bodily pain, when he has persuaded himself that pain  is the greatest evil? On the other side, what disgrace, what ignominy,  would he not submit to that he might avoid pain, when persuaded that it  was the greatest of evils? Besides, what person, if it be only true  that pain is the greatest of evils, is not miserable, not only when he  actually feels pain, but also whenever he is aware that it may befall  him. And who is there whom pain may not befall? So that it is clear  that there is absolutely no one who can possibly be happy. Metrodorus,  indeed, thinks that man perfectly happy whose body is free from all  disorders, and who has an assurance that it will always continue so;  but who is there who can be assured of that?    VII. But Epicurus, indeed, says such things that it should seem that  his design was only to make people laugh; for he affirms somewhere that  if a wise man were to be burned or put to the torture--you expect,  perhaps, that he is going to say he would bear it, he would support  himself under it with resolution, he would not yield to it (and that by  Hercules! would be very commendable, and worthy of that very Hercules  whom I have just invoked): but even this will not satisfy Epicurus,  that robust and hardy man! No; his wise man, even if he were in  Phalaris's bull, would say, How sweet it is! how little do I regard it!  What, sweet? Is it not sufficient, if it is not disagreeable? But those  very men who deny pain to be an evil are not in the habit of saying  that it is agreeable to any one to be tormented; they rather say that  it is cruel, or hard to bear, afflicting, unnatural, but still not an  evil: while this man who says that it is the only evil, and the very  worst of all evils, yet thinks that a wise man would pronounce it  sweet. I do not require of you to speak of pain in the same words which  Epicurus uses--a man, as you know, devoted to pleasure: he may make no  difference, if he pleases, between Phalaris's bull and his own bed; but  I cannot allow the wise man to be so indifferent about pain. If he  bears it with courage, it is sufficient: that he should rejoice in it,  I do not expect; for pain is, beyond all question, sharp, bitter,  against nature, hard to submit to and to bear. Observe Philoctetes: We  may allow him to lament, for he saw Hercules himself groaning loudly  through extremity of pain on Mount Oeta. The arrows with which Hercules  presented him were then no consolation to him, when        The viper's bite, impregnating his veins      With poison, rack'd him with its bitter pains.    And therefore he cries out, desiring help, and wishing to die,        Oh that some friendly hand its aid would lend,      My body from this rock's vast height to send      Into the briny deep! I'm all on fire,      And by this fatal wound must soon expire.    It is hard to say that the man who was obliged to cry out in this  manner was not oppressed with evil, and great evil too.    VIII. But let us observe Hercules himself, who was subdued by pain at  the very time when he was on the point of attaining immortality by  death. What words does Sophocles here put in his mouth, in his  Trachiniae? who, when Deianira had put upon him a tunic dyed in the  centaur's blood, and it stuck to his entrails, says,        What tortures I endure no words can tell,      Far greater these, than those which erst befell      From the dire terror of thy consort, Jove--      E'en stern Eurystheus' dire command above;      This of thy daughter, Oeneus, is the fruit,      Beguiling me with her envenom'd suit,      Whose close embrace doth on my entrails prey,      Consuming life; my lungs forbid to play;      The blood forsakes my veins; my manly heart      Forgets to beat; enervated, each part      Neglects its office, while my fatal doom      Proceeds ignobly from the weaver's loom.      The hand of foe ne'er hurt me, nor the fierce      Giant issuing from his parent earth.      Ne'er could the Centaur such a blow enforce,      No barbarous foe, nor all the Grecian force;      This arm no savage people could withstand,      Whose realms I traversed to reform the land.      Thus, though I ever bore a manly heart,      I fall a victim to a woman's art.  IX. Assist, my son, if thou that name dost hear,      My groans preferring to thy mother's tear:      Convey her here, if, in thy pious heart,      Thy mother shares not an unequal part:      Proceed, be bold, thy father's fate bemoan,      Nations will join, you will not weep alone.      Oh, what a sight is this same briny source,      Unknown before, through all my labors' course!      That virtue, which could brave each toil but late,      With woman's weakness now bewails its fate.      Approach, my son; behold thy father laid,  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14990"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement No. 819, September 12, 1891 (#14)"],[1,"of the cantonment of  Mandalay. The engine is placed vertically in front of the boiler, and  consists of a double acting pump with valves which can be taken out  for renewal or examination in two or three minutes. The capacity is  200 gallons per minute, and the height of jet 140 ft. As shown in the  engraving, the fore part of the machine forms a hose reel and tool  box, and can be instantly separated from the engine to allow of the  independent use of the latter at a fire.    [Illustration: IMPROVED STEAM FIRE ENGINE.]    The engine is constructed with wrought iron side frames, fore carriage  and wheels, and steel axles, springs, etc. The tool box, coachman's  seat, and other parts are of teak. It is provided with Messrs. Shand,  Mason & Co.'s quick steaming boiler, in which 100 lb. pressure can be  raised from cold water in from five to seven minutes, an extra large  fire box for burning wood, with fire door at the back, feed pump, and  injector, fresh water tank, coal bunker, and other fittings and  arrangements for carrying the suction pipe. A pole and sway bars are  fitted for two ponies, and wood cross bars to pass over the backs of  the animals at the tops of the collars. Two men are carried on the  machine, a coachman on the box seat and a stoker on the footboard at  the rear of the engine.

It  will suffice to say that sixty-four balloons crossed the Prussian  lines during the war of 1870-1871, carrying with them 360 pigeons, 302  of which were afterward sent back to Paris, during a terrible winter,  without previous training, and from localities often situated at a  distance of over 120 miles. Despite the shooting at them by the enemy,  98 returned to their cotes, 75 of them carrying microscopic  dispatches. They thus introduced into the capital 150,000 official  dispatches and a million private ones reduced by photo-micrographic  processes. The whole, printed in ordinary characters, would have  formed a library of 500 volumes. One of these carriers, which reached  Paris on the 21st of January, 1871, a few days previous to the  armistice, carried alone nearly 40,000 dispatches.    The pigeon that brought the news of the victory of Coulmiers started  from La Loupe at ten o'clock in the morning on the tenth of November,  and reached Paris a few minutes before noon. The account of the  Villejuif affair was brought from Paris to Tourcoing (Nord) by a white  pigeon belonging to Mr. Descampes. This pigeon is now preserved in a  stuffed state in the museum of the city. The carrier pigeon service  was not prolonged beyond the 1st of February, and our winged brothers  of arms were sold at a low price at auction by the government, which,  once more, showed itself ungrateful to its servants as soon as it no  longer had need of their services. After the commune, Mr. La Perre de  Roo submitted to the president of the republic a project for the  organization of military dove cotes for connecting the French  strongholds with each other. Mr. Thiers treated the project as  chimerical, so the execution of it was delayed up to the time at which  we saw it applied in foreign countries.    In 1877, the government accepted a gift of 420 pigeons from Mr. De  Roo, and had the Administration of Post Offices construct in the  Garden of Acclimatization a model pigeon house, which was finished in  1878, and was capable of accommodating 200 pairs.    At present, the majority of our fortresses contain dove cotes, which  are perfectly organized and under the direction of the engineer corps  of the army.    The map in Fig. 1 gives the approximate system such as it results from  documents consulted in foreign military reviews.    According to Lieutenant Grigot, an officer of the Belgian army, who  has written a very good book entitled _Science Colombophile_, a  rational organization of the French system requires a central station  at Paris and three secondary centers at Langres, Lyons and Tours, the  latter being established in view of a new invasion.    As the distance of Paris from the frontier of the north is but 143  miles at the most, the city would have no need of any intermediate  station in order to communicate with the various places of the said  frontier. Langres would serve as a relay between Paris and the  frontier of the northeast. For the places of the southeast it would  require at least two relays, Lyons and Langres, or Dijon.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--THEORETIC MAP OF THE FRENCH SYSTEM OF MILITARY  DOVE COTES.]    As Paris has ten directions to serve, it should therefore possess ten  different dove cotes, of 720 birds each, and this would give a total  of 7,200 pigeons. According to the same principle, Langres, which has  five directions to provide for, should have 3,600 pigeons.    Continuing this calculation, we find that it would require 25,000  pigeons for the dove cotes as a whole appropriated to the frontiers of  the north, northeast, east, and southeast, without taking into account  our frontiers of the ocean and the Pyrenees.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--BASKET FOR CARRYING PIGEONS.]    A law of the 3d of July, 1877, supplemented by a decree of the 15th of  November, organized the application of carrier pigeons in France.    One of the last enumerations shows that there exist in Paris 11,000  pigeons, 5,000 of which are trained, and, in the suburbs, 7,000, of  which 3,000 are trained. At Roubaix, a city of 100,000 inhabitants,  there are 15,000 pigeons. Watrelos, a small neighboring city of 10,000  inhabitants, has no less than 3,000 carrier pigeons belonging to three  societies, the oldest of which, that of Saint-Esprit, was founded in  1869.    In entire France, there are about 100,000 trained pigeons, and  forty-seven departments having pigeon-fancying societies.    _Germany._--After the war of 1870, Prussia, which had observed the  services rendered by pigeons during the siege of Paris, was the first  power to organize military dove cotes.    In the autumn of 1871, the Minister of War commissioned Mr. Leutzen, a  very competent amateur of Cologne, to study the most favorable  processes for the recruitment, rearing, and training of carrier  pigeons, as well as for the organization of a system of stations upon  the western frontier.    In 1872, Mr. Bismarck having received a number of magnificent Belgian  pigeons as a present, a rearing station was established at the  Zoological Garden of Berlin, under the direction of Dr. Bodinas.    In 1874 military dove cotes were installed at Cologne, Metz,  Strassburg, and Berlin. Since that time there have been organized, or  at least projected, about fifteen new stations upon the frontier of  France, upon the maritime coasts of the north, or upon the Russian  frontier.    Berlin remains the principal rearing station, with two pigeon houses  of 500 pigeons each; but it is at Cologne that is centralized the  general administration of military dove cotes under Mr. Leutzen's  direction. The other stations are directly dependent upon the  commandant of the place, under the control of the inspector of  military telegraphy. The Wilhelmshaven dove cote, by way of exception,  depends upon the Admiralty. In each dove cote there is a subofficer of  the engineer corps and an experienced civil pigeon fancier, on a  monthly salary of ninety marks, assisted by two orderlies. In time of  war, this _personnel_ has to be doubled and commanded by an officer.    The amount appropriated to the military dove cotes, which in 1875 was  about 13,000 francs, rose in 1888 to more than 60,000 francs.    As a rule, each dove cote should be provided with 1,000 pigeons, but  this number does not appear to have been yet reached except at Thorn,  Metz, and Strassburg.    Germany has not confined herself to the organization of military dove  cotes, but, like other nations, has endeavored to aid and direct  pigeon fancying, so as to be able, when necessary, to find ready  prepared resources in the civil dove cotes. The generals make it their  duty to be present, as far as possible, at the races of private  societies, and the Emperor awards gold medals for flights of more than  120 miles.    On the 13th of January, 1881, nineteen of these societies, at the head  of which must be placed the Columbia, of Cologne, combined into a  federation. At the end of the year the association already included  sixty-six societies. On the 1st of December, 1888, it included  seventy-eight, with 52,240 carrier pigeons ready for mobilization.    The first two articles of the statutes of the Federation are as  follows:    \"I. The object of the Federation is to unite in one organization all  societies of pigeon fanciers in order to improve the service of  carrier pigeons, which, in case of war, the country must put to  profit.    \"II. The Federation therefore proposes: (a) To aid the activity of  pigeon-fancying societies and to direct the voyages of the societies  according to a determined plan; (b) to form itinerent societies and on  this occasion to organize expositions and auction sales of pigeons;  (c) to maintain relations with the Prussian Minister of War; (d) to  obtain diminutions and favors for transportation; (e) to make efforts  for the extermination of vultures; (f) to obtain a legal protection  for pigeons; and (g) to publish a special periodical for the  instruction of fanciers.\"    _Italy._--The first military dove cote in Italy was installed in 1876  at Ancona by the twelfth regiment of artillery.
