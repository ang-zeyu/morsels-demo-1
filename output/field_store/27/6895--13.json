Kellogg ten years ago]    _Preparation._ Preparation for the best strawberries should be started  three years before planting. Using soil from sand to clay, well drained,  well manured, sowed to clover, take off the first cutting of clover,  then more manure plowed under deep with the second crop of clover, as  late as can before freezing up, to kill insects and make the soil  friable and ready for a crop of potatoes the next spring. After  harvesting 300 bushels of potatoes to the acre use a heavy coat of well  rotted manure without weed seed, plowed under late in fall. The  following spring, as soon as the ground will work, thoroughly disk and  harrow, and harrow twice more. Then roll or plank it, mark both ways two  by four feet, set by hand either with dibble or spade, no machine work.  Crown even with the surface, with best of plants from new beds, leaving  on but two leaves, and if the roots are not fresh dug, trim them a  little. Firm them good.    Now start the weeder and go over the field every week till the runners  start, then use the nine-tooth cultivator with the two outside teeth two  inches shorter than the others. Cultivate every week till the middle of  October. Use the hoe to keep out all weeds and hoe very lightly about  the plants. Weeds are a blessing to the lazy man, but I don't like to  have it overdone. Don't let the soil bake after a rain. Keep the  cultivator running. In garden work a steel tooth rake is a splendid  garden tool.    Volume 1905, page 230 (An. Report Minn. State Hort. Society). Mr. Schwab  gets an ideal strawberry bed, then kills it with twelve inches of mulch.  If the ice and snow had not come perhaps the plants would have pulled  through. Volume 41, page 390. Mr. Wildhagen gives an ideal paper on  strawberries, it will pay you to read it again and again. Instead of one  year's preparation, I would have three.    _Winter Protection._ Unless in an exposed place, marsh hay is the best  and cleanest mulch, but high winds may roll it off. Clean straw away  from the tailings of the machine is next best. For small acreage if one  inch can be put on as soon as the ground is frozen a half inch, it will  save the many freezings and thawings before winter sets in. For large  acreage it is not practical to cover till frost will hold up a loaded  wagon. Two inches of mulch, that covers the plants and paths from sight  is enough, but I see you cover deeper, from four to twelve inches in  Minnesota, and often smother the plants. If we could have a snow blanket  come early and stay on late in spring, that would protect the plants,  but we want the mulch also to protect from drouth and keep the berries  clean. A January thaw is liable to kill out any field that is not  properly mulched.    A two inch mulch will not hinder the plants coming through in spring;  four inches will require part of the mulch raked into the paths; if  plants don't get through readily loosen the mulch. I have known some  successful growers to take off all the mulch from the paths in spring  and cultivate lightly but thoroughly, then replace the mulch to protect  from drouth and to keep the berries clean, but I don't think it pays.    _Weeds._ In the best fields and beds I ever saw there will come up an  occasional weed in spring, and it pays to go over the ground with a  spade or butcher knife and take out such weeds. We almost always get a  drouth at picking time, better a drought than too much rain. A good  straw mulch will usually carry us through.    _Irrigation._ If irrigation is attempted the fields must be prepared  before planting to run water through between the rows. Sprinkling will  not do except at sundown. Rain always comes in cloudy weather; you  cannot wet foliage in sun in hot weather without damage. A good rainfall  is one inch, which is a thousand barrels to the acre, so what can you do  with a sprinkling cart? Showers followed by bright sunshine damage the  patch.    If your plants are set too deep they rot, if too high they dry, if not  well firmed they fail. When I have used a tobacco planter I have had to  put my heel on every plant. Of course you know that newly planted June  varieties must have the blossom buds cut out, and everbears bearing must  also till July.    _Picking._ The man who has acres to pick must secure his boxes the  winter before and have at least part of them made up if they are to be  tacked. I have found a boy can make up boxes as fast as thirty pickers  can fill. If you use the folding box no tacks are needed. Too many boxes  made up ahead are liable to be damaged by the mice.    _Pickers._ Engage your pickers ahead; agree on the price and that a part  of the pay is to be kept back till the close of the season, which is  forfeited if quitting before time. If pickers are too far away,  transportation must be furnished--free boxes of berries are appreciated  by the pickers.    _Marketing._ Sometimes the marketing of the fruit is harder than the  growing of it. If enough is grown form an association to sell it, get  advice from a successful association how to form and how to run it.  Sometimes a well made wagon, a good team and a good man can sell from  house to house in the country and city and make good returns. In this  way you get back your crates and part of the boxes. I know a successful  grower in Iowa, who sold his crop of ten acres to the farmers and city  people, they doing their own picking and furnishing their own boxes, at  a given price. All the proprietor had to do was sit at the gate and take  in the cash. It is worth a good deal to know how to grow the best of  strawberries and often it is worth more to know how to turn them into  cash.    _What Varieties?_ Dunlap and Warfield have a general reputation for  profit, can be picked together and sell well; dark color, good canners  and good shippers. If you want a third variety take Lovett. Some of your  growers want nothing but Bederwood, but it is too light and too soft to  ship, though it is a good family berry. I expect Minnesota No. 3 will  soon be the only variety you will want of the June kinds.    _Insects._ Winter drouth often injures the roots and some lay it to  insects. The winter of 1899 was the worst winter drouth I ever knew; it  killed every thing. If you are troubled with the crown borer, root lice,  leaf roller or rust, grow one crop and plow under, or move your fields a  good distance from the old bed. What shall be done with the old bed? If  you have insects or rust plow under and get the best place to start a  new bed, and don't set any of your own plants if you have insects or  rust--and be sure you buy of a reliable grower.    _Old Beds._ If the first crop is big, plow under, if light and you have  a good stand of plants, no insects or rust, you can mow and teddy up the  mulch and in a high wind burn it over--a quick fire will do no harm.  Then you can plow two furrows between rows and drag it every way till  not a plant is seen. Soon, if the rows are left a foot wide, the plants  will come through. Then manure (better be manured before plowing), and  you may get a good second crop. Some mow and rake off and burn outside  the bed, then with a two horse cultivator dig up the paths and cultivate  and get the ground in condition. Put on the manure and hoe out part of  the old plants.    I like the plan of Wildhagen; mow, burn and then cover three inches deep  with one hundred big loads of manure to the acre and don't go near the  patch till picking time next year. He gets a nice early crop, and if  berries are a little small it pays better than any other way. Try it! I  have known some fields carried to fourth crop, and amateur beds kept up  for ten years. It takes lots of work to keep an old bed in good  condition. J.M. Smith, of Green Bay, Wis., almost always took one crop  and plowed under. If the first crop was injured by frost, he took a  second crop. He raised four hundred bushels to the acre.    Wm. Von Baumbach, of Wauwatosa, Wis., raised from five acres less ten  square rods seventeen hundred bushels big measure beside quantities  given the pickers. I have had beds and fields where I have timed my boys  picking a quart a minute. I had one small boy that picked 230 quarts a  day. But in all my sixty years growing strawberries I never properly  prepared an acre of ground before planting. I could take a five acre  patch now, as young as I am, and beat anything I have ever done.    _Mulch._--For mulch for small beds, if straw or marsh hay is not handy,  use an inch of leaves, then cut your sweet corn and lay the stalks on  three inches apart and your plants will come up between in spring and  give you clean fruit. Cut cornstalks are good for field covering, also  shredded cornstalks. I have used the begass from the cane mill, but it  is too heavy. Evergreen boughs are very good if well put on for small  beds.    In my paper, Vol. 1911, page 180 (Minn. Report), it should read five  bushels to the square _rod, not acre_. Who ever heard of five bushels an  acre!    _Big Yields._--You all know of Friend Wedge's 74-3/4 quarts from one  square rod of Everbearers the season of planting. I believe that can be  beaten. Let our society put a few hundred dollars in premiums for best  yield of square rod of everbearers and of June varieties, and of a  quarter of an acre; also the best product of one hill, and the best  product of one plant, and its runners fourteen months from planting. I  believe one plant of everbearers can produce a quart the season of  setting. I know of the five bushels to the square rod, and the other  fellow had four and a half bushel of Wilson.          Surprise Plum a Success.    C. A. PFEIFFER, WINONA.      I realize at the outset that I am treading on delicate ground in  undertaking to defend the Surprise plum, on account of it having been  discarded by our fruit list committee, but after seeing our young trees "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18187"],[0,"Hebrew Life and Times (#14)"],[1,"was willing to drive out the priests of the Phoenician Baal, and he  offered many sacrifices to Jehovah. But his chief ambition was for  himself. Instead of bringing peace and justice to the poor, suffering,  war-scourged people, his reign was horrible for its bloody killings.  No one was safe from his murderous jealousy.    There was needed something more than a mere revival of the \"old time  religion\" of Moses. There had to be purer and nobler ideas of Jehovah,  a better knowledge of the real nature of Jehovah and of what Jehovah  demanded of men, and of the kind of worship which would please him.  Till then there was little hope of happiness for men and women and  little children.      STUDY TOPICS    1. Read 2 Kings 6. 24-30 for a vivid picture of the sufferings of the  common people of Israel, as a result of constant wars.    2. Read 1 Kings 20. 1-34 for some light on Ahab as an able king. What  qualities are displayed by him, in the narrative of this chapter?    3. Look up Rechabites in the Bible dictionary for a more complete  narrative about them.    4. Is war more of a curse to the common people to-day than in ancient  times, or less? Why? What classes still suffer most from war, the rich  and powerful or the common people?          CHAPTER XV    A NEW KIND OF RELIGION      Among all ancient peoples, including the Hebrews, a large part of  religion was the burning of animal sacrifices on altars. Whenever a  sheep or lamb or kid was slaughtered for food the blood was poured out  on the sacred rock, or altar, in which the god was supposed to dwell.  Afterward the fat was burned on the same rock. It was believed that  the god in the rock drank the blood and smelled the fragrant odor of  the burning fat.    =Whole burnt offerings.=--On special occasions, such as a wedding, the  birth of a child, the beginning of a war, or the celebration of a  victory, the entire animal was burned on the altar. The first-born  calves, or lambs, or kids of any animal mother were also regarded by  the Hebrews as sacred and were burned as whole burnt-offerings to  Jehovah.      SACRIFICES IN CANAAN    After the Hebrews settled in Canaan they adopted other kinds of  sacrifices. Grains and fruits were offered as well as animals. Wine  and oil were poured on the altars. Baked cakes were burned. One sheaf  from every harvest field of wheat or barley was supposed to be waved  back and forth before an altar of Jehovah. This was a sort of  religious drama by which Jehovah was thought to receive a share of the  grain.    =Religious feasts.=--In Canaan also the Hebrews observed certain  religious festivals, which corresponded to the early, middle, and late  harvest seasons; they were called respectively, the \"Feast of  Unleavened Bread,\" the \"Feast of Weeks\" (or Pentecost), and the \"Feast  of Tabernacles.\" All of these were joyous occasions somewhat like our  Thanksgiving Day, and at all of them each family offered to Jehovah  some part of the products of their fields.      PRIESTS AND THEIR DUTIES    The altars where these sacrifices were offered were in charge of a  special class of men, the priests. In the early days, in Canaan, there  was a little temple, or shrine, outside each town and village with one  or more priests in charge of it. Sometimes wealthy men had private  shrines and hired their own special priests. It was the business of  these men to know just how a sacrifice must be offered in order that  it might be pleasing to Jehovah. There were certain rules and  regulations handed down from generation to generation. There were  certain kinds of animals which could not be offered. It was important  to know just what parts of each victim were to be burned. The various  meal offerings had to be prepared in a certain way. Yeast could not be  used, nor honey.    =The increasing number of priestly rules.=--As the centuries passed  more and more rules were worked out by the priests. This was their  whole business in life, and, of course, they made much of it. More and  more different kinds of offerings were invented; for example, incense,  which was the burning of herbs which made a sweet-smelling smoke. The  books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, especially Leviticus, are  largely composed of these rules for sacrifices. The animals had to be  washed, killed, and skinned, according to certain directions. The  blood had to be disposed of according to strict rule--some placed in  the horns of the altar, some on the priests, some on the worshiper  bringing the offering, and so on. And the more there were of these  rules, the more priests there had to be to remember and enforce them.  Thus it came about that all too frequently sacrifices came to be the  chief thing in religion. Religion meant sacrifices and not much else.      THE REIGN OF JEROBOAM II    Jeroboam II, who reigned over the northern kingdom of Israel for some  forty years, beginning about B.C. 790, was in some ways like Ahab, who  lived a century earlier. He was victorious in war and brought peace  and prosperity to his nation. These years of peace brought little  happiness, however, to the common people of Israel. They had already  become so poverty-stricken during the long years of petty but cruel  wars, under the earlier kings since Solomon, that they were  practically at the mercy of a small class of nobles and wealthy  merchants who grew richer all the time while the people grew poorer.    =Evil days.=--These rich men used false weights and measures. In  buying wheat from the farmer they would use heavy weights, and get  more than was right; in selling to the poor of the cities they used  light weights, and so gave out little for much. They corrupted courts  and judges, so that no poor man could get his rights. They charged  enormous rates of interest for the money which the poor were obliged  to borrow. All over the land the mass of the people were living in  hovels and selling their sons and their daughters into slavery to keep  from starving, while the rich men and their families lived in luxury  and in wasteful, extravagant display.    None of this shameful injustice seemed to weigh heavily on any man's  conscience, for they were careful to keep up all the sacrifices to  Jehovah. And was not Jehovah showing his pleasure by granting them  these long years of peace and prosperity? They forgot the old lessons  of Jehovah's justice which the nation had learned from Moses. Even  Moses, according to their traditions, had given laws about sacrifices  and offerings. These seemed to be the essential thing. So they kept on  offering up costly sacrifices at their great temples and shrines, with  stately and gorgeous ceremonials, and thought to themselves, \"How  pleased Jehovah must be!\"      AMOS    There came one day to King Jeroboam's own shrine at Bethel a man in  the garb of a shepherd and speaking in the name of Jehovah, like the  prophets. But what strange words are these which he utters?        =\"I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight      in your solemn assemblies. Yea, though ye offer me your ...      meal-offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard      the peace-offerings of your fat beasts. Take away from me the      noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy      viols. But let judgment roll down as waters, and      righteousness as a mighty stream.\"=    What this shepherd prophet was proclaiming was a religion in which  burnt-offerings, or sacrificial ceremonies of any kind had little or  no place, but which expressed itself in justice and righteousness  toward one's fellow men. What Jehovah wants is not sacrifices at all,  he said, but to stop cheating the poor: to throw away your false  balances, and set free the slave.    =Amos' dire forebodings.=--In many addresses, as reported in the book  which bears his name, with bitter and thrilling eloquence Amos tried  to drive home this great message to the hearts of his fellow  countrymen. He warned them that unless they heeded, disaster would  come to the nation. For as surely as Jehovah demanded justice, so  surely would he punish injustice. Terrible are his pictures of the  calamities with which the guilty Israelites would be visited. Nor did  he appeal wholly to fear. There is now and then a pleading note in  Amos. Honest and burning indignation and threats are indeed most  common in the pages of his book; yet listen to this:        =\"Thus the Lord God showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts      in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ...      and ... when they made an end of eating the grass of the      land, then I said, O Lord God, forgive, I beseech thee: how      shall Jacob stand? for he is small.\"=    There speaks the shepherd pleading for his little sheep--\"How can  Jacob stand, for he is small?\"      THE RESULTS OF AMOS' WORDS    Amos' mission to the northern kingdom seemed to be a failure. He had  come up from his sheep tending, in his home in Tekoa, in Judah,  because he felt burning within him a message for his people. But he  soon went home. The chief priest at Bethel drove him out. And  apparently the people did not care. No doubt even the poor people in  whose cause Amos had so eloquently spoken were shocked by his words.  \"What, are not our sacrifices holy and pleasing to Jehovah? Would he  have us stop offering up burnt-offerings? That is almost blasphemous.\"    =Bread upon the waters.=--Yet there were some who listened. And the  proof is found in the existence of the book of Amos in the Bible. Some  one cared enough to preserve and copy the first manuscript of Amos'  sermons and to make still other copies. Another proof is the fact that  within that same century three other supremely great religious  teachers caught up his great idea of a new kind of religion and  repeated it in new and wonderfully convincing ways. Of these other  prophets we shall learn more in the chapters to follow.      STUDY TOPICS    1. Glance "]]]
