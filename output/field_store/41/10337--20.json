Huerta  lists six works in Tagalog by him, all of them devotionary tracts,  the last of which he notes was printed at Manila in 1617, and is  listed by Medina, no. 20, pp. 14-5. His works are also recorded by  Leon Pinelo, _op. cit._, 1737-38, II, f. 919r.    [77] Santa Ines (written originally in 1676), p. 211. Virtually the  same information is given by San Antonio, I, pp. 532-3 & 563.    [78] Juan de la Concepcion, _Historia general de Philipinas_, Manila,  1788-92, II, pp. 45-6. Schilling, p. 203n, maintains that the early  writers were mistaken in believing that the Synod was held in 1581. On  October 16, 1581 the Bishop called a meeting of ten priests at the  Convent of Tondo to discuss the execution of the decree about slaves,  Torres, II, pp. cxliv-v. No laymen were present and no other topic was  discussed. The decisions of this meeting were sent in a letter from  Salazar to the King, dated from Tondo, October 17, 1581, translated  in B. & R., XXXIV, pp. 325-31, from the original MS. in the A. of  I. (68-1-42), Torres, II, no. 2686, p. 95. The following year a real  Synod was held, this time including lay government officials as well  as priests, at which was discussed a variety of subjects. Robert  Streit, _Bibliotheca Missionum_, Aachen, 1928, IV, pp. 327-31, cites  a MS. account of it by the Jesuit father Sanchez who was present; and  Valentin Marin, _Ensayo de una Sintesis de los trabajos realizados  por las Corporaciones Religiosas Espanoles de Filipinas_, Manila,  1901, I, pp. 192 et seqq., cites another MS., then in the Archives  of the Archiepiscopal Palace of Manila, _Memoria de una junta que  se hizo a manera de concilio el ano de 1582, para dar asiento a las  cosas tocantes al aumento de la fe, y justificacion de las conquistas  hechas y que adelante se hicieron por los espanoles_, from which he  quotes extensively. With reference to the Synod see further Lorenzo  Perez, _Origen de las Misiones Franciscanas en el extremo oriente_,  in Archivo Ibero-Americano, 1915, III, pp. 386-400.    [79] Santa Ines, p. 212. Again similar accounts are to be found in  San Antonio, I, pp. 563-6, in far more detail and phrased in even  more laudatory terms, and the fullest early biography of Plasencia  is given by San Antonio, II, pp. 512-79. Modern surveys appear in  Marin, _op. cit._, II, pp. 573-82, and Lorenzo Perez, _op. cit._,  pp. 378 et seqq.    [80] Chirino, _Primera parte_, quoted by Retana, col. 24, implied that  Quinones and Plasencia wrote at about the same time: \"The first who  wrote in these languages were, in Visayan, P. Fr. Martin de Rada, and  in Tagalog, Fr. Juan de Quinones, both of the Order of St. Augustine,  and at the same time Fr. Juan de Oliver and Fr. Juan de Plasencia  of the Order of St. Francis, of whom the latter began first, but the  former [wrote] many more things and very useful ones.\" However, San  Antonio, I, p. 532, wrote perhaps with bias in favor of his own order,  \"Although the Augustinian fathers had come earlier and did not lack  priests fluent in the idiom, the language had not yet been reduced to  a grammar, so that it could be learned by common grammatical rules,  nor was there a general vocabulary of speech; except that each one  had his own notes, to make himself understood, and everything was  unsystematized.\"    [81] _Entrada de la seraphica Religion de nuestro P. S. Francisco  en las Islas Philipinas_, MS. of 1649, first published in Retana,  _Archivo_, I, no. III, translated in B. & R., XXXV, p. 311.    [82] Medina, p. 15, quoting from Martinez whom we are unable to trace.    [83] Huerta, pp. 492-3. Oliver died in 1599. San Antonio, II, p. 531,  says that Plasencia was the first to write a catechism (called  in Tagalog \"Tocsohan\"), and Oliver was the first to translate the  explanation of the Doctrina. Oliver's works are noted by Leon Pinelo,  _op. cit._, 1737-38, II, col. 730, and Barrantes, _op. cit._, p. 187.    [84] Sebastian de Totanes, _Arte de la Lengua Tagala_, Manila, 1850,  p. v, (first edition printed in 1745) says of Oliver that \"up to  the present day our province reveres him as the first master of  this idiom.\"    [85] See note 42.    [86] Huerta, p. 517. Nothing is known of Diego de la Asuncion  except that he wrote five works in Tagalog including an _Arte_ and  _Diccionario_. Huerta was unable to find any record of him in the  mission lists, the capitularies or the death records, but that he was  in the Philippines before 1649 we can be sure of from the notice of  him in the manuscript of that date.    [87] Huerta, p. 495. Montes y Escamilla came to the islands in 1583  and remained there until his death in 1610. Five works in Tagalog  are attributed to him, an _Arte_, _Diccionario_, _Confesionario_,  _Devocional tagalog_, and a _Guia de Pecadores_. The _Devocional_  is listed by Medina, no. 16, p. 12.    [88] Pablo Rojo, _Fr. Juan de Plasencia_, _Escritor_, Appendix 3 of  Santa Ines, II, p. 590. An early reference by Fernandez, _Historia  Eclesiastica_, p. 300, speaking of the Franciscan missionary successes  among the natives, says, \"They learned the Doctrina Christiana which  the priests translated into Tagalog.\"    [89] Rojo, in Santa Ines, II, pp. 590-1, says that the Doctrina  then being used among the Tagalogs was the same as that written by  Plasencia except for modernization in accordance with the changes  which had taken place in the language since his time.    [90] Medina, no. 15, p. 11.    [91] Chirino, p. 14.    [92] Colin, II, p. 325.    [93] Chirino, p. 27.    [94] Chirino, chaps. XV-XVII, pp. 34-41.    [95] On May 13, 1579, Philip II wrote to the Governor of the  Philippines, \"Fray Domingo de Salazar, of the Dominican order, and  bishop of the said islands, has reported to us that he is going to  reside in these islands; and that he will take with him religious of  his order to found monasteries, and to take charge of the conversion  and instruction of the natives,\" B. & R., IV, p. 141, translated  from the original MS. in the Archivo-Historico Nacional, _Cedulario  indico_, t. 31, f. 132V, no. 135. Twelve of the twenty who set out  from Europe with Salazar died before reaching Mexico, and the others  were so sick that all but one remained there, so when Salazar landed  at Manila in March 1581 he was accompanied by twenty Augustinians,  eight Franciscans, and only one Dominican, Christoval de Salvatierra.    [96] For these and other general facts I have used Aduarte and  Remesal where they are supported by the other historians, Juan de  la Concepcion, San Antonio, San Agustin, Juan de Medina and Santa  Ines. It should be noted that Remesal acknowledged as his source for  much of the material on the Philippines the unpublished MS. history  of the Franciscan, Francisco de Montilla. The fifteen Dominicans were  Juan de Castro, Alonso Ximenez, Miguel de Benavides, Pedro Bolanos,  Bernardo Navarro, Diego de Soria, Juan de Castro the younger, Marcos  Soria de San Antonio, Juan de San Pedro Martyr (or Maldonado), Juan  Ormaza de Santo Tomas, Pedro de Soto, Juan de la Cruz, Gregorio de  Ochoa, Domingo de Nieva, and Pedro Rodriguez.    [97] By a bull of October 20, 1582 Pope Gregory XIII confirmed the  appointment already obtained from Pablo Constable de Ferrara, General  of the Dominican Order, making Juan Chrisostomo vicar-general of the  Philippine Islands and China, and giving him authority to establish  a province there, B. & R., V, pp. 199--200, translated from Hernaez,  _Coleccion de bulas_, Brussels, 1879, I, p. 527, where it is printed  from the original MS. in the Vatican, Bular. Dom., t. 15, p. 412.    [98] In 1580 the Dominicans of Mexico had begun plans for  the establishment of a province in the Orient, and sent Juan  Chrisostomo to Europe to obtain the necessary permission from lay  and ecclesiastical authorities. The Jesuit Alonso Sanchez, who had  been sent to Spain to explain the situation in the Philippines,  was at court, and told the King and Council of the Indies--quite  subverting his mission--that there was no need for more priests  and particularly no need for a new order there. Chrisostomo was  discouraged, but the scheme was revivified by Juan de Castro who  finally secured a letter from Philip II on September 20, 1585 endorsing  the plan. Twenty-two volunteers sailed from Spain on July 17, 1586. In  Mexico the Dominicans again found Sanchez propagandizing against the  mission and also encountered the efforts of the Viceroy to persuade  the friars to remain there. Notwithstanding, twenty friars subscribed  to a set of ordinances at the Convent of Santo Domingo in Mexico on  December 17, 1586. Of the twenty, fifteen went to the Philippines,  three went directly to China, and Juan Chrisostomo, who was ill and  weak, and Juan Cobo, who had business there, stayed behind in Mexico.    [99] Aduarte, I, p. 9.    [100] Aduarte, I, p. 70.    [101] Juan Cobo had stayed behind in Mexico on business, and during  his stay had been so moved by the scandals of the government there  that he preached publicly against them, as a result of which he  was banished by the Viceroy. He brought with him from Mexico a  fellow-reformer and exile, Luis Gandullo, and four other recruits  for the Philippine mission.    [102] These are printed in the _Ordinationes_ of 1604, see note 127,  and by Remesal, pp. 677--8, who says that \"these ordinances were  printed in as fine characters and as correctly as if in Rome or Lyon,  by Francisco de Vera, a Chinese Christian, in the town of Binondo in  the year 1604 through the diligence of Fr. Miguel Martin.\"    [103] Sangley, a term used by the natives to designate Chinese,  was derived from the Cantonese _hiang_ (or _xiang_) and _ley_  meaning a \"travelling merchant.\" It was adopted by the Spaniards  and in most instances used interchangeably with Chinese. If any  distinction existed it was that a Sangley was a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16130"],[0,"Judgments of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand on Proceedings to Review Aspects (#17)"],[1,"before the Commission. He explained that his  involvement in all post-accident matters was as a welfare officer for  the association; and in that capacity he had been given by the police  personal property for distribution to next-of-kin. When asked about  pages which normally would have been within the ring-binder covers he  said that most of the recovered items had been damaged considerably by  water and kerosene, and in answer to the Commissioner, who had asked  \"How could the ring-binder cover itself be intact and yet the pad of  writing paper disappear?\", he said, \"I suggest the cover survived the  water and kerosene but the paper contents didn't\". He added in answer to  questions by counsel--         \"If papers were removed from the ring binder who would have done       that.... I would have myself I presume.         Do you recall doing that.... No not specifically. I was involved in       destroying a lot of papers that were damaged and would have caused       distress some because of that and some because it was the obvious       thing to do.\"    As a further sample of the kind of material that might have been  provided by the criticized officers had they been given the opportunity  we were referred to a signed statement by Captain Crosbie forwarded to  the police (who by then were investigating the allegations of  conspiracy) on 5th May 1981. In the statement he has said after he had  given evidence before the Inquiry he recalled that because of the poor  condition of the notebook and severely damaged paper inside it and  \"rather than present this to Mrs Collins\" he had disposed of the pages  himself. Then having cleaned the cover he dried it in the sun and  returned it to Mrs Collins. It would seem to be an understandable  reaction although once again the effect this kind of material might have  had if it had been put forward is not for us to assess. In any event,  concerning this matter the Commissioner said in paragraph 352--         \"As to the ring-binder notebook, it had been returned to Mrs       Collins by an employee of the airline, but all the pages of the       notebook were missing. _Captain Gemmell_ was asked about this in       evidence. He suggested that the pages might have been removed       because they had been damaged by kerosene. However, the ring-binder       notebook itself, which was produced at the hearing, was entirely       undamaged.\" (Emphasis added.)    It is clear that the Commissioner has wrongly attributed the explanation  given by Captain Crosbie concerning the removal of missing pages to  Captain Gemmell. The latter was never questioned at all about possible  reasons for the missing pages. The fifth and sixth respondents have  formally acknowledged that the reference to Captain Gemmell in that  paragraph is wrong.      Contents of Flight Bags    It has been explained that the Commissioner was satisfied that Captain  Collins had used the New Zealand Atlas to plot the last leg of the  flight path from Cape Hallett to McMurdo and may have used a chart of  his own for the same purpose. In addition there were his briefing  documents and those received by First Officer Cassin. Those received by  the latter have been discussed. The Commissioner held that they had not  been taken aboard the aircraft. But he was concerned with whatever else  may have been carried onto the DC10 by First Officer Cassin in his  flight bag; and about the contents of Captain Collin's flight bag which  he believed would include the atlas and briefing documents. In fact the  only evidence concerning the possible survival of the first officer's  flight bag, let alone its contents, was a name-tag which finally reached  Mrs Cassin through Captain Crosbie, the welfare representative. Since  there is no description of the contents and it has been held that the  briefing material was left behind anyway, the fate of the bag itself  would seem to be immaterial.    On the other hand it is known that after the accident Captain Collins'  bag was seen on Mt. Erebus. The matter has been mentioned. The bag did  not reach his widow as it would normally have done if it had been  received and returned to New Zealand and this fact is the focus of  attention in the Royal Commission report.    In order to examine the matter it will be remembered that the  mountaineer, Mr Woodford, arrived by helicopter searching for survivors  on the morning of 29th November. In the letter he sent to the Royal  Commission he said he found the bag then and: \"My recollection is that  it was empty when I first inspected it. It certainly contained no  diaries or briefing material.\" Apparently the bag had been thrown from  the disintegrating aircraft at the time of impact and its contents lost  in the snow or scattered by winds before the arrival of the  mountaineers. But whatever the reason for their absence from the bag it  is the contents that matter in this case--not the flight bag itself. And  according to the letter they had already disappeared from the bag three  days before the New Zealand party arrived there. So like the bag of  First Officer Cassin it might be thought that this item too was  immaterial. However, it is discussed by the Commissioner in the  following way.    First there is listed a series of documents \"which clearly had been  carried in the flight bag of Captain Collins\" and which had not been  recovered. The items comprise the New Zealand Atlas and a chart; the  briefing documents; and the ring-binder notebook. Those three items  have been mentioned. And finally a topographical map issued on the  morning of the flight. The suggested significance of these various  documents is explained by reference to the view of counsel for the  Airline Pilots Association that they \"would have tended to support the  proposition that Captain Collins had relied upon the incorrect  co-ordinates\" (paragraph 344).    There follows reference to the blue envelope and the matter of Captain  Eden after which paragraph 349 speaks of the flight bag:         \"Then, as the Inquiry proceeded, there were other queries raised.       It seemed that Captain Collins' flight bag had been discovered on       the crash site. It was a bag in which he was known to have carried       all his flight documents. It was said to have been empty when       found, a fact which was incidentally confirmed by a mountaineer who       had seen the flight bag before Captain Gemmell arrived at the crash       site. The flight bag was rectangular, and constructed of either       hard plastic or leather, and had the name of Captain Collins       stamped on it in gold letters. It was evidently undamaged.\"    There is mention as well of First Officer Cassin's flight bag and the  ring-binder notebook (both of which matters have now been discussed) and  then it is said in paragraph 353 that after the taking of evidence the  Commissioner asked counsel assisting the Commission to make inquiries  about the two flight bags \"which had been located on the site but which  had not been returned to Mrs Collins or Mrs Cassin\".    It appears from the following paragraph 354 that among others  interviewed by counsel or asked for comment upon this matter were Mr  Chippindale (the chief inspector of air accidents), and the senior  sergeant of police who had been in charge of the property collected from  the crash site when it was brought to McMurdo. It is said in that  paragraph that the police officer--         \"... recollected either one or two flight bags among other property       awaiting packing for return to New Zealand. He said that personnel       from Air New Zealand had access to the store, as well as the chief       inspector, and the senior sergeant said that he thought that he had       given the flight bags to the chief inspector and that the chief       inspector was the sole person to whom he had released any property.       The chief inspector was then interviewed on 11 December 1980 by       telephone, being at that time in Australia, but he said that no       flight bags were ever handed to him.\"    Thus the inquiries that were made in this fashion were inconclusive.  However, the Commissioner was satisfied that--         \"The two flight bags were lodged in the Police store at McMurdo and       would have been returned in due course to Mrs Collins and Mrs       Cassin by the Police. But they were taken away from the store by       someone and have not since been seen.\" (Paragraph 359 (1))    Then in the same context he said in sub-paragraph 359 (4):         \"Captain Gemmell had brought back some quantity of documents with       him from Antarctica, and certain documents had been recovered from       him by First Officer Rhodes on behalf of the chief inspector.\"    And then--         \"It therefore appears that there were sundry articles and perhaps       documents which had been in possession of the aircrew which came       back to New Zealand otherwise than in the custody of the Police or       the chief inspector\" (paragraph 360).    In evidence Captain Gemmell had denied knowledge of the change that had  been made to the McMurdo waypoint but the Commissioner did not accept  that answer; and he is linked with the matters mentioned in paragraph  360 on the basis that he had known \"about the changed co-ordinates  before he went to Antarctica\" and that because he--         \"... plainly kept this significant fact to himself, (he) was to be       the arbiter of which documents were relevant. The opportunity was       plainly open for Captain Gemmell to comply with the chief       executive's instructions to collect all documents relevant to this       flight, wherever they might be found, and to hand them over to the       airline management.\"    The next sentence of that paragraph contains the finding already  mentioned:         \"However, there is not sufficient evidence to justify any finding       on my part that Captain Gemmell recovered documents from"]]]
