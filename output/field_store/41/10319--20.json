This was to bait a hook with a joint of pork and throw it into the water  at a point where the current would carry it out into mid-stream; then to  take a live pig to the river-side, and belabour him well with a stick  till he set up the squeal familiar to most ears. Any crocodile within  hearing was sure to come to the sound, and falling in with the pork on  the way, would instantly swallow it down. Upon this the hunters hauled  at the rope to which the hook was attached, and, notwithstanding his  struggles, drew \"leviathan\" to shore. Amenemhat, having thus \"made the  crocodile a prisoner,\" may have carried his captive in triumph to his  capital, and exhibited him before the eyes of the people.    Amenemhat, having reigned as sole king for twenty years, was induced to  raise his eldest son, Usurtasen, to the royal dignity, and associate him  with himself in the government of the empire. Usurtasen was a prince of  much promise, He \"brought prosperity to the affairs of his father. He  was, as a god, without fears; before him was never one like to him. Most  skilful in affairs, beneficent in his mandates, both in his going out  and in his coming in he made Egypt flourish.\" His courage and his  warlike capacity were great. Already, in the lifetime of his father, he  had distinguished himself in combats with the Petti and the Sakti. When  he was settled upon the throne, he made war upon the Cushite tribes who  bordered Egypt upon the south, employing the services of a general named  Ameni, but also taking a part personally in the campaign. The Cushites  or Ethiopians, who in later times became such dangerous neighbours to  Egypt, were at this early period weak and insignificant. After the king  had made his expedition, Ameni was able with a mere handful of four  hundred troops to penetrate into their country, to \"conduct the golden  treasures\" which it contained to the presence of his master, and to  capture and carry off a herd of three thousand cattle.    It was through his sculptures and his architectural works that the first  Usurtasen made himself chiefly conspicuous. Thebes, Abydos, Heliopolis  or On, the Fayoum and the Delta, were equally the scenes of his  constructive activity, and still show traces of his presence. At Thebes,  he carried to its completion the cell, or _naos_, of the great temple of  Ammon, in later times the innermost sanctuary of the building, and  reckoned so sacred, that when Thothmes III. rebuilt and enlarged the  entire edifice he reproduced the structure of Usurtasen, unchanged in  form, and merely turned from limestone into granite. At Abydos and  other cities of Middle Egypt, he constructed temples adorned with  sculptures, inscriptions, and colossal statues. At Tanis, he set up his  own statue, exhibiting himself as seated upon his throne. In the Fayoum  he erected an obelisk forty-one feet high to the honour of Ammon,  Phthah, and Mentu, which now lies prone upon the ground near the Arab  village of Begig. Indications of his ubiquitous activity are found also  at the Wady Magharah, in the Sinaitic peninsula, and at Wady Haifa in  Nubia, a little above the Second Cataract; but his grandest and most  elaborate work was his construction of the great temple of the Sun at  Heliopolis, and his best memorial is that tall finger pointing to the  sky which greets the traveller approaching Egypt from the east as the  first sample of its strange and mystic wonders. This temple the king  began in his third year. After a consultation with his lords and  counsellors, he issued the solemn decree: \"It is determined to execute  the work; his majesty chooses to have it made. Let the superintendent  carry it on in the way that is desired; let all those employed upon it  be vigilant; let them see that it is made without weariness; let every  due ceremony be performed; let the beloved place arise.\" Then the king  rose up, wearing a diadem, and holding the double pen; and all present  followed him. The scribe read the holy book, and extended the measuring  cord, and laid the foundations on the spot which the temple was to  occupy. A grand building arose; but it has been wholly demolished by the  ruthless hand of time and the barbarity of conquerors. Of all its  glories nothing now remains but the one taper obelisk of pink  granite, which rises into the soft sleepy air above the green cornfields  of Matariyeh, no longer tipped with gold, but still catching on its  summit the earliest and latest sun-rays, while wild-bees nestle in the  crannies of the weird characters cut into the stone.    [Illustration: OBELISK OF USURTASEN I. ON THE SITE OF HELIOPOLIS.]    Usurtasen, after reigning ten years in conjunction with his father and  thirty-two years alone, associated his son, Amenemhat II., who became  sole king about three years later. His reign, though long, was  undistinguished, and need not occupy our attention. He followed the  example of his predecessors in associating a son in the government; and  this son succeeded him, and is known as Usurtasen II. One event of  interest alone belongs to this time. It is the reception by one of his  great officials of a large family or tribe of Semitic immigrants from  Asia, who beg permission to settle permanently in the fertile Egypt  under the protection of its powerful king. Thirty-seven Amu, men, women,  and children, present themselves at the court which the great noble  holds near the eastern border, and offer him their homage, while they  solicit a favourable hearing. The men are represented draped in long  garments of various colours, and wearing sandals unlike the  Egyptian--more resembling, in fact, open shoes with many straps. Their  arms are bows, arrows, spears, and clubs. One plays on a seven-stringed  lyre by means of a plectrum. Four women, wearing fillets round their  heads, with garments reaching below the knee, and wearing anklets but no  sandals, accompany them. A boy, armed with a spear, walks at the side  of the women; and two children, seated in a kind of pannier placed on  the back of an ass, ride on in front. Another ass, carrying a spear, a  shield, and a pannier, precedes the man who plays on the lyre. The great  official, who is named Khnum-hotep, receives the foreigners, accompanied  by an attendant who carries his sandals and a staff, and who is followed  by three dogs. A scribe, named Nefer-hotep, unrolls before his master a  strip of papyrus, on which are inscribed the words, \"The sixth year of  the reign of King Usurtasen Sha-khepr-ra: account rendered of the Amu  who in the lifetime of the chief, Khnum-hotep, brought to him the  mineral, _mastemut_, from the country of Pit-shu--they are in all  thirty-seven persons.\" The mineral _mastemut_ is thought to be a species  of stibium or antimony, used for dying the skin around the eyes, and so  increasing their beauty. Besides this offering, the head of the tribe,  who is entitled _khak_, or \"prince,\" and named Abusha, presents to  Khnum-hotep a magnificent wild-goat, of the kind which at the present  day frequents the rocky mountain tract of Sinai. He wears a richer dress  than his companions, one which is ornamented with a fringe, and has a  wavy border round the neck. The scene has been generally recognized as  strikingly illustrating the coming of Jacob's family into Egypt (Gen.  xlvi. 28-34), and was at one time thought by some to represent that  occurrence; but the date of Abusha's coming is long anterior to the  arrival in Egypt of Jacob's family, the number is little more than half  that of the Hebrew immigrants, the names do not accord; and it is now  agreed on all hands, that the interest of the representation is  confined to its illustrative force.    Usurtasen II. reigned for nineteen years. He does not seem to have  associated a son, but was succeeded by another Usurtasen, most probably  a nephew. The third Usurtasen was a conquering monarch, and advanced the  power and glory of Egypt far more than any other ruler belonging to the  Old Empire. He began his military operations in his eighth year, and  starting from Elephantine in the month Epiphi, or May, moved southward,  like another Lord Wolseley, with a fixed intention, which he expressed  in writing upon the rocks of the Elephantine island, of permanently  reducing to subjection \"the miserable land of Cush.\" His expedition was  so far successful that in the same year he established two forts, one on  either side of the Nile, and set up two pillars with inscriptions  warning the black races that they were not to proceed further northward,  except with the object of importing into Egypt cattle, oxen, goats, or  asses. The forts are still visible on either bank of the river a little  above the Second Cataract, and bear the names of Koommeh and Semneh.  They are massive constructions, built of numerous squared blocks of  granite and sandstone, and perched upon two steep rocks which rise up  perpendicularly from the river. Usurtasen, having made this beginning,  proceeded, from his eighth to his sixteenth year, to carry on the war  with perseverance and ferocity in the district between the Nile and the  Red Sea--to kill the men, fire the crops, and carry off the women and  children, much as recently did the Arab traders whom Baker and Gordon  strove to crush. The memory of his razzias was perpetuated upon stone  columns set up to record his successes. Later on, in his nineteenth year  he made a last expedition, to complete the conquest of \"the miserable  Kashi,\" and recorded his victory at Abydos.    The effect of these inroads was to advance the Egyptian frontier one  hundred and fifty miles to the south, to carry it, in fact, from the  First to above the Second Cataract. Usurtasen drew the line between  Egypt and Ethiopia at this period, very much where the British  Government drew it between Egypt and the Soudan in 1885. The boundary is  a somewhat artificial one, as any boundary must be on the course of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15665"],[0,"New Latin Grammar (#17)"],[1,"es._  audi, _hear thou_;          audite, _hear ye_.    _Fut._   audito, _thou shalt hear_,  auditote, _ye shall hear_,             audito, _he shall hear_;    audiunto, _they shall hear_.
