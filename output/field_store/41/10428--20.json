Before their  time, even the greatest of the leaders of Israel had thought of  Jehovah as for the most part the God of Israel only. But now in the  midst of the terror of cruel armies and ruined cities and smoking  fields, when no one knew what to believe or where to look for comfort  and protection, this great Isaiah was able to realize that Jehovah,  the God of righteousness and justice and love, was _the God of all  humanity_. There were no limits to his realm. All tribes and kingdoms  and races were subject to his holy law. The Assyrians are but \"the axe  that he hews with.\" His providence rules over all. Whatever wicked men  may say or do, his will is done in the end. His plans are brought to  pass.    =Isaiah's faith.=--With such a God as this in whom to trust, Isaiah  was able to show himself to his countrymen as a wonderful example of  the power of faith. When they were panic-stricken he was calm. \"Thus  saith the Lord God, ... In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in  quietness and confidence shall be your strength.\" Do not rush off to  other nations and other gods. They will fail you. Most likely they  will selfishly betray you. Only do the will of the just God, who rules  the nations, and quietly trust him. Do that and no evil can befall  you. He is all-wise and all-powerful, and he is good.    So at last, the religion of the one All-Father, which we call  _monotheism_, was born in the mind and heart of a man, and began to be  clearly proclaimed by human lips.      STUDY TOPICS    1. Look up \"Isaiah\" in the Bible dictionary.    2. Read Isaiah 6. 1-8 for his own story of the experience which led  him to be a prophet.    3. What parts of this story in Isaiah 6. 1-8 express the idea of one  great God of all nations? Look up \"Monotheism\" in the dictionary.    4. Read chapter one or chapter five of the book of Isaiah for a good  example of his eloquent preaching.          CHAPTER XIX    A REVISED LAW OF MOSES      Amos and the great prophets who followed him met with the same fate as  many other pioneers--only a few of their hearers heeded their words,  or even understood them. But four great leaders in one century--Amos,  Hosea, Micah, and Isaiah--could hardly fail to make some real  impression on the minds and lives of their nation. Isaiah was perhaps  the most influential, partly because the others before them had  prepared the way and partly because he himself lived and preached to  the people during a long period of time--more than forty years.    =Isaiah's disciples.=--Another reason why Isaiah exerted so great an  influence was that he organized little groups of his disciples into  circles for study. These groups met together from time to time, and  read aloud the sermons of Isaiah and the other prophets, and talked  about how to apply them to their lives. We can see them seated in a  circle in the evening on the floor of one of those little homes  opening into a narrow Jerusalem street. There would be a candlestick  in the center, or an upturned bushel measure, with a candle on top of  it. The circle would be composed of men; but on the outside eagerly  listening would be women and children. One of the men in the circle  would be seated by the candle reading from a roll of papyrus on which  were written the sermons of one of the prophets.      THE EVIL DAYS OF MANASSEH'S REIGN    It is well that these reading circles were started, for they kept  alive the new truth of the reformer-prophets during the reign of a bad  king, Manasseh. This man's father, Hezekiah, had favored the prophets.  But Manasseh, who became king when Isaiah was an old man, was opposed  to all these new ideas. Most of the people of Judah probably agreed  with him. They still clung to the belief that the one sure way for a  nation to be prosperous was to offer sacrifices to the most powerful  gods. Now the kingdom of Judah, in spite of all their worship of  Jehovah, was still subject to the empire of Assyria. Great sums had to  be paid every year as tribute. \"What fools those prophets are!\" men  said, as they talked together in the streets. \"See how much stronger  the Assyrian gods are than Jehovah!\" \"Last month I had to pay ten  shekels for the tribute!\" \"If we want to prosper, we must worship the  gods of Assyria.\"    =Manasseh's persecution.=--Manasseh therefore proceeded to introduce  the worship of the moon-god, and the sun-god, and other deities of  Nineveh. He even set up altars to these divinities in the temple of  Jehovah at Jerusalem. When the disciples of the prophets spoke against  all this he had them seized and killed, until he had \"filled Jerusalem  with innocent blood.\" Many a good man who had listened to the reading  of Isaiah by candlelight in one of those reading circles now had to  hide himself in some closet or cistern from the soldiers of Manasseh.  There is a tradition that the aged Isaiah himself was put to death  during this persecution.    Not all of those who opposed Manasseh were killed, although they were  finally compelled to keep silence. Those little study circles still  held meetings in secret to read and talk and pray; and they kept  looking forward to a time when a different kind of a man would be  king, and when they would be able once more to lead the people into  the way of justice and true worship.    In one of these little groups a remarkably wise plan was suggested.  Let us take the laws which have been handed down to us from Moses, it  was said, and work them up into a sermon. Every one reverences Moses.  Let it include the farewell address which Moses is said to have spoken  to his people just before he died, and put into it all the laws of  Moses, and let us show what they really mean. And by and by when  Manasseh is dead we may be able to read it to the people, and perhaps  they will listen.      THE WRITTEN LAW    =The new law book--Deuteronomy.=--So they wrote the new book, and it  is preserved in our Bible as the book of Deuteronomy. We find in it  all the old laws which had been handed down from early times, and  which were called the \"laws of Moses.\" And we find on every page  sentences which show the influence of the great prophets, from Amos to  Isaiah. Isaiah's influence is perhaps the most plainly seen,  especially his teaching that the people should worship Jehovah alone  as the one ruler of the world. In Deuteronomy also we find a very  solemn and emphatic commandment bidding us love and worship only  Jehovah, the one true God. This is the commandment which Jesus called  the first and greatest of all.        =\"Hear, O Israel. The Lord our God is one Lord; and thou      shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with      all thy soul, and with all thy might.\"=    Such a law as this of course forbade all those covenants with other  gods which Isaiah denounced.    =Laws helping the oppressed.=--All the prophets had been on the side  of the poor and the weak, against the rich and powerful who oppressed  them. The authors of the book of Deuteronomy tried to shape this new  law so as more fully to protect the poor. They made stronger all the  older laws which were intended to make life a little easier for the  weak and unfortunate, and they added others: for example, laws  protecting debtors against greedy and merciless creditors, and laws  forbidding the extremely harsh penalties which poor men were sometimes  made to suffer by rich judges.    There was an ancient law requiring that any Hebrew who had fallen into  a state of slavery on account of debt must be set free after seven  years. The new law book included this law, and added that the master  must not send him away emptyhanded at the end of the seven years, but  must give him food and clothes enough to keep him alive while he  looked for a chance to work and earn money for himself. The new law  also protected fugitive slaves from other countries. They were not to  be returned to their owners.    =A compromise.=--All of the four reformer-prophets whom we have  studied had condemned the offerings and animal sacrifices of the old  worship, not only because of the idolatry and other heathen and  immoral practices connected with them, but also on the ground that  Jehovah did not want sacrifices anyway, but only justice and love.    But the authors of the new law did not abolish sacrifices altogether.  They provided that all the small shrines, called \"high places,\" such  as at Hebron or Gibeon, and all up and down the country should be  destroyed, but that sacrifices should be offered at Jerusalem and only  there. The old-time religious feasts, such as the Passover, could no  longer be celebrated at home. All the people must come up to Jerusalem  for them. No doubt it was thought that this would help to put down  idolatry.      THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW LAW    Manasseh reigned fifty-five years. It was a long, weary time of  waiting for the disciples of the prophets. The new law book was put  away in one of the closets of the temple for safe-keeping. The years  went by and most of the men who helped to write it died. At last,  however, the end came for Manasseh. After a short period his grandson,  Josiah, who was only eight years old, became king. The boy's older  relatives and friends were all against the ideas of old Manasseh and  on the side of the prophets. Little by little the principles of the  prophets were put in practice. Among other things, orders were given  to tear out from the Jerusalem temple the images and altars to the  sun-god and the moon-god and other emblems of Assyrian worship. The  temple was also cleaned and renovated. While the carpenters were at  work the new law-book was discovered in the chest where it had been  hidden and was brought to the young king and read before him.    =Josiah's reforms.=--Josiah was deeply impressed and gave orders that  the reforms called for by the new law should be carried out. Officers  went all up and down the villages and towns of Judah"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18193"],[0,"Ways of Wood Folk (#17)"],[1,"been lost when from far up the ridges comes a  deep, sudden, ugly roar that penetrates the woods like a rifle-shot.  Again it comes, and nearer! Down in the canoe a paddle blade touches  the water noiselessly from the stern; and over the bow there is the  glint of moonlight on a rifle barrel. The roar is now continuous on  the summit of the last low ridge. Twigs crackle, and branches snap.  There is the thrashing of mighty antlers among the underbrush, the  pounding of heavy hoofs upon the earth; and straight down the great  bull rushes like a tempest, nearer, nearer, till he bursts with  tremendous crash through the last fringe of alders out onto the grassy  point.--And then the heavy boom of a rifle rolling across the startled  lake.    Such is moose calling, in one of its phases--the most exciting, the  most disappointing, the most trying way of hunting this noble game.    The call of the cow moose, which the hunter always uses at first, is a  low, sudden bellow, quite impossible to describe accurately. Before  ever hearing it, I had frequently asked Indians and hunters what it  was like. The answers were rather unsatisfactory. \"Like a tree  falling,\" said one. \"Like the sudden swell of a cataract or the rapids  at night,\" said another. \"Like a rifle-shot, or a man shouting  hoarsely,\" said a third; and so on till like a menagerie at feeding  time was my idea of it.    One night as I sat with my friend at the door of our bark tent, eating  our belated supper in tired silence, while the rush of the salmon  pool near and the sigh of the night wind in the spruces were lulling  us to sleep as we ate, a sound suddenly filled the forest, and was  gone. Strangely enough, we pronounced the word _moose_ together,  though neither of us had ever heard the sound before. 'Like a gun in a  fog' would describe the sound to me better than anything else, though  after hearing it many times the simile is not at all accurate. This  first indefinite sound is heard early in the season. Later it is  prolonged and more definite, and often repeated as I have given it.    The answer of the bull varies but little. It is a short, hoarse,  grunting roar, frightfully ugly when close at hand, and leaving no  doubt as to the mood he is in. Sometimes when a bull is shy, and the  hunter thinks he is near and listening, though no sound gives any idea  of his whereabouts, he follows the bellow of the cow by the short roar  of the bull, at the same time snapping the sticks under his feet, and  thrashing the bushes with a club. Then, if the bull answers, look out.  Jealous, and fighting mad, he hurls himself out of his concealment and  rushes straight in to meet his rival. Once aroused in this way he  heeds no danger, and the eye must be clear and the muscles steady to  stop him surely ere he reaches the thicket where the hunter is  concealed. Moonlight is poor stuff to shoot by at best, and an  enraged bull moose is a very big and a very ugly customer. It is a  poor thicket, therefore, that does not have at least one good tree  with conveniently low branches. As a rule, however, you may trust your  Indian, who is an arrant coward, to look out for this very carefully.    The trumpet with which the calling is done is simply a piece of birch  bark, rolled up cone-shaped with the smooth side within. It is fifteen  or sixteen inches long, about four inches in diameter at the larger,  and one inch at the smaller end. The right hand is folded round the  smaller end for a mouthpiece; into this the caller grunts and roars  and bellows, at the same time swinging the trumpet's mouth in sweeping  curves to imitate the peculiar quaver of the cow's call. If the bull  is near and suspicious, the sound is deadened by holding the mouth of  the trumpet close to the ground. This, to me, imitates the real sound  more accurately than any other attempt.    So many conditions must be met at once for successful calling, and so  warily does a bull approach, that the chances are always strongly  against the hunter's seeing his game. The old bulls are shy from much  hunting; the younger ones fear the wrath of an older rival. It is only  once in a lifetime, and far back from civilization, where the moose  have not been hunted, that one's call is swiftly answered by a savage  old bull that knows no fear. Here one is never sure what response his  call will bring; and the spice of excitement, and perhaps danger, is  added to the sport.    In illustration of the uncertainty of calling, the writer recalls with  considerable pride his first attempt, which was somewhat startling in  its success. It was on a lake, far back from the settlements, in  northern New Brunswick. One evening, late in August, while returning  from fishing, I heard the bellow of a cow moose on a hardwood ridge  above me. Along the base of the ridge stretched a bay with grassy  shores, very narrow where it entered the lake, but broadening out to  fifty yards across, and reaching back half a mile to meet a stream  that came down from a smaller lake among the hills. All this I noted  carefully while gliding past; for it struck me as an ideal place for  moose calling, if one were hunting.    The next evening, while fishing alone in the cold stream referred to,  I heard the moose again on the same ridge; and in a sudden spirit of  curiosity determined to try the effect of a roar or two on her, in  imitation of an old bull. I had never heard of a cow answering the  call; and I had no suspicion then that the bull was anywhere near. I  was not an expert caller. Under tuition of my Indian (who was  himself a rather poor hand at it) I had practised two or three times  till he told me, with charming frankness, that possibly a _man_ might  mistake me for a moose, if he hadn't heard one very often. So here was  a chance for more practice and a bit of variety. If it frightened her  it would do no harm, as we were not hunting.    [Illustration]    Running the canoe quietly ashore below where the moose had called, I  peeled the bark from a young birch, rolled it into a trumpet, and,  standing on the grassy bank, uttered the deep grunt of a bull two or  three times in quick succession. The effect was tremendous. From the  summit of the ridge, not two hundred yards above where I stood, the  angry challenge of a bull was hurled down upon me out of the woods.  Then it seemed as if a steam engine were crashing full speed through  the underbrush. In fewer seconds than it takes to write it the canoe  was well out into deep water, lying motionless with the bow inshore. A  moment later a huge bull plunged through the fringe of alders onto the  open bank, gritting his teeth, grunting, stamping the earth savagely,  and thrashing the bushes with his great antlers--as ugly a picture as  one would care to meet in the woods.    He seemed bewildered at not seeing his rival, ran swiftly along the  bank, turned and came swinging back again, all the while uttering his  hoarse challenge. Then the canoe swung in the slight current; in  getting control of it again the movement attracted his attention, and  he saw me for the first time. In a moment he was down the bank into  shallow water, striking with his hoofs and tossing his huge head up  and down like an angry bull. Fortunately the water was deep, and he  did not try to swim out; for there was not a weapon of any kind in the  canoe.    When I started down towards the lake, after baiting the bull's fury  awhile by shaking the paddle and splashing water at him, he followed  me along the bank, keeping up his threatening demonstrations. Down  near the lake he plunged suddenly ahead before I realized the danger,  splashed out into the narrow opening in front of the canoe--and there  I was, trapped.    It was dark when I at last got out of it. To get by the ugly beast in  that narrow opening was out of the question, as I found out after a  half-hour's trying. Just at dusk I turned the canoe and paddled slowly  back; and the moose, leaving his post, followed as before along the  bank. At the upper side of a little bay I paddled close up to shore,  and waited till he ran round, almost up to me, before backing out into  deep water. Splashing seemed to madden the brute, so I splashed him,  till in his fury he waded out deeper and deeper, to strike the  exasperating canoe with his antlers. When he would follow no further,  I swung the canoe suddenly, and headed for the opening at a racing  stroke. I had a fair start before he understood the trick; but I never  turned to see how he made the bank and circled the little bay. The  splash and plunge of hoofs was fearfully close behind me as the canoe  shot through the opening; and as the little bark swung round on the  open waters of the lake, for a final splash and flourish of the  paddle, and a yell or two of derision, there stood the bull in the  inlet, still thrashing his antlers and gritting his teeth; and there I  left him.    The season of calling is a short one, beginning early in September and  lasting till the middle of October. Occasionally a bull will answer as  late as November, but this is unusual. In this season a perfectly  still night is perhaps the first requisite. The bull, when he hears  the call, will often approach to within a hundred yards without making  a sound. It is simply wonderful how still the great brute can be as he  moves slowly through the woods. Then he makes a wide circuit till he  has gone completely round the spot where he heard the call; and if  there is the slightest breeze blowing he scents the danger, and is off  on the instant. On a still night his big trumpet-shaped ears are  marvelously acute. Only absolute silence on the hunter's part can  insure success.    Another condition quite as essential is moonlight. The moose sometimes  calls just before dusk and just before sunrise; but the bull is more  wary at such times, and very loth to show himself in the open. Night  diminishes his extreme caution, and"]]]
