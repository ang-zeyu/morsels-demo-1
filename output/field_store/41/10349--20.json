Now, I've had a  lairge experience o' life, and I never saw yet a sensible man  insensible to the touch of yellow metal. If there may be such a  man, it is demonstrable that he is no sensible man. Fideelity!  quotha, it's sheer obstinacy. They just see that ye want  something oot o' them, and they're so damned selfish and thrawn  they winna pairt. And with the natural inabeelity o' their brains  to hold mair than one idea at a time they canna see that in  return you could put something into their palms far more  profitable. (_Sits again at table._) Aweel, bring Mistress Stewart  up.    (_Old woman is placed before him where son had been._)    CAMPBELL (_more ingratiatingly_). Weel noo, Mistress Stewart, good  woman, this is a sair predeecament for ye to be in. I would jist  counsel ye to be candid. Doubtless yer mind is a' in a swirl. Ye  kenna what way to turn. Maybe ye are like the Psalmist and say:  \"I lookit this way and that, and there was no man to peety me, or  to have compassion upon my fatherless children.\" But, see now, ye  would be wrong; and, if ye tell me a' ye ken, I'll stand freends  wi' ye. Put your trust in Erchie Campbell.    MARY STEWART. I trust no Campbell.    CAMPBELL. Weel, weel noo, I'm no' jist that set up wi' them  myself. There's but ae Campbell that I care muckle aboot, after  a'. But, good wife, it's no' the Campbells we're trying the noo;  so as time presses we'll jist \"_birze yont_,\" as they say  themselves. Noo then, speak up.    (MARY STEWART _is silent._)    CAMPBELL (_beginning grimly and passing through astonishment,  expostulation, and a feigned contempt for mother and pity for  son, to a pretence of sadness which, except at the end, makes his  words come haltingly_). Ah! ye also. I suppose ye understand,  woman, how it will go wi' your son? (_To his clerk_) Here's a fine  mother for ye, James! Would you believe it? She kens what would  save her son--the very babe she nursed at her breast; but will  she save him? Na! na! Sir, he may look after himself! A mother, a  mother! Ha! ha!    (CAMPBELL _laughs._ MACKENZIE _titters foolishly._ CAMPBELL _pauses to  watch effect of his words._)    Aye, you would think, James, that she would remember the time  when he was but little and afraid of all the terrors that walk in  darkness, and how he looked up to her as to a tower of safety,  and would run to her with outstretched hands, hiding his face  from his fear, in her gown. The darkness! It is the dark night  and a long journey before him now.    (_He pauses again._)    You would think, James, that she would mind how she happit him  from the cold of winter and sheltered him from the summer heats,  and, when he began to find his footing, how she had an eye on a'  the beasts of the field and on the water and the fire that were  become her enemies--And to what purpose all this care?--tell me  that, my man, to what good, if she is to leave him at the last to  dangle from a tree at the end of a hempen rope--to see his flesh  given to be meat for the fowls of the air--her son, her little  son!    MARY STEWAET. My son is guilty of no crime!    CAMPBELL. Is he no'! Weel, mistress, as ye'll no' take my word  for it, maybe ye'll list to Mr. Mackenzie here. What say ye,  James?    MACKENZIE. He is guilty of aiding and abetting in the concealment  of proscribed persons; likewise with being found in the  possession of arms, contrary to statute, both very heinous  crimes.    CAMPBELL. Very well said, James! Forby, between ourselves, Mrs.  Stewart, the young man in my opeenion is guilty of another crime  (_snuffs_)--he is guilty of the heinous crime of not knowing on  which side his bread is buttered.--Come now--    MARY STEWART. Ye durst not lay a finger on the lad, ye durst not  hang him.    MACKENZIE. And why should the gentleman not hang him if it  pleesure him?    (CAMPBELL _taps snuff-box and takes pinch._)    MARY STEWART (_with intensity_). Campbell of Kilmhor, lay but one  finger on Dugald Stewart and the weight of Ben Cruachan will be  light to the weight that will be laid on your soul. I will lay  the curse of the seven rings upon your life: I will call up the  fires of Ephron, the blue and the green and the gray fires, for  the destruction of your soul: I will curse you in your homestead  and in the wife it shelters and in the children that will never  bear your name. Yea, and ye shall be cursed.    CAMPBELL. (_Startled--betrays agitation--the snuff is spilled from  his trembling hand._) Hoot toot, woman! ye're, ye're--(_Angrily_) Ye  auld beldame, to say such things to me! I'll have ye first  whippet and syne droont for a witch. Damn thae stubborn and  supersteetious cattle! (_To_ SANDEMAN) We should have come in here  before him and listened in the barn, Sandeman!    SANDEMAN. Ah, listen behind the door you mean! Now I never  thought of that!    CAMPBELL. Did ye not! Humph! Well, no doubt there are a good many  things in the universe that yet wait for your thought upon them.  What would be your objections, now?    SANDEMAN. There are two objections, Kilmhor, that you would  understand.    CAMPBELL. Name them.    SANDEMAN. Well, in the first place, we have not wings like crows  to fly--and the footsteps on the snow--Second point--the woman  would have told him we were there.    CAMPBELL. Not if I told her I had power to clap her in Inverness  jail.    MARY STEWART (_in contempt_). Yes, even if ye had told me ye had  power to clap me in hell, Mr. Campbell.    CAMPBELL. Lift me that screeching Jezebel oot o' here; Sandeman,  we'll mak' a quick finish o' this. (_Soldiers take her towards  barn._) No, not there; pitch the old girzie into the snow.    MARY STEWART. Ye'll never find him, Campbell, never, never!    CAMPBELL (_enraged_). Find him! Aye, by God I'll find him, if I  have to keek under every stone on the mountains from the Boar of  Badenoch to the Sow of Athole. (_Old woman and soldiers go  outside._) And now, Captain Sandeman, you an' me must have a word  or two. I noted your objection to listening ahint doors and so  on. Now, I make a' necessary allowances for youth and the grand  and magneeficent ideas commonly held, for a little while, in that  period. I had them myself. But, man, gin ye had trod the floor of  the Parliament Hoose in Edinburry as long as I did, wi' a pair o'  thin hands at the bottom o' toom pockets, ye'd ha'e shed your  fine notions, as I did. Noo, fine pernickety noansense will no'  do in this business--    SANDEMAN. Sir!    CAMPBELL. Softly, softly, Captain Sandeman, and hear till what I  have to say. I have noticed with regret several things in your  remarks and bearing which are displeasing to me. I would say just  one word in your ear; it is this. These things, Sandeman, are not  conducive to advancement in His Majesty's service.    SANDEMAN. Kilmhor, I am a soldier, and if I speak out my mind,  you must pardon me if my words are blunt. I do not like this  work, but I loathe your methods.    CAMPBELL. Mislike the methods you may, but the work ye must do!  Methods are my business. Let me tell you the true position. In ae  word it is no more and no less than this. You and me are baith  here to carry out the proveesions of the Act for the Pacification  of the Highlands. That means the cleaning up of a very big mess,  Sandeman, a very big mess. Now, what is your special office in  this work? I'll tell ye, man; you and your men are just beesoms  in the hands of the law-officers of the Crown. In this district,  I order and ye soop! (_He indicates door of barn._) Now soop,  Captain Sandeman.    SANDEMAN (_in some agitation_). What is your purpose? What are you  after? I would give something to see into your mind.    CAMPBELL. Ne'er fash aboot my mind: what has a soldier to do with  ony mental operations? It's His Grace's orders that concern you.  Oot wi' your man and set him up against the wa'.    SANDEMAN. Kilmhor, it is murder--murder, Kilmhor!    CAMPBELL. Hoots, awa', man, it's a thing o' nae special  significance.    SANDEMAN. I must ask you for a warrant.    CAMPBELL. Quick then: Mackenzie will bring it out to you.    (CLERK _begins writing._ SANDEMAN _and soldiers lead_ STEWART  _outside_, CAMPBELL _sits till they are out._ CLERK _finishes_,  CAMPBELL _signs warrant--and former goes._ CAMPBELL _is alone,  save for_ MORAG CAMERON, _who is sitting huddled up on stool by  fire, and is unnoticed by_ CAMPBELL.)    CAMPBELL (_as one speaking his thoughts aloud_). I've been beaten  for a' that. A strange thing, noo. Beforehand I would ha'e said  naething could be easier. And yet--and yet--there it is!... It  would have been a grand stroke for me.... Cluny--Keppoch--Lochiel,  and maybe ... maybe--Hell! when I think of it! Just a whispered  word--a mere pointed finger would ha'e telled a'. But no! their  visions, their dreams beat me. \"You'll be adding to your  experience to-night, Mr. Campbell, and have something to put to  the other side of it,\" says he; aye, and by God I have added  something to it, and it is a thing I like but little--that a  dream can be stronger than a strong man armed.--Here come I,  Archibald Campbell of Kilmhor, invested with authority as  law-officer of the Crown, bearing in my hand the power of life  and death, fire and the sword, backed up by the visible authority  of armed men, and yet I am powerless before the dreams of an old  woman and a half-grown lad--soldiers and horses and the gallows  and yellow gold are less than the wind blowing in their  faces.--It is a strange thing that: it is a thing I do not  understand.--It is a thing fit to sicken a man against the notion  that there are probabeelities on this earth.--have been beaten  for a' that. Aye, the pair o' them have beat me--though it's a  matter of seconds till one of them be dead.    MORAG (_starting into upright position and staring at him; her  voice is like an echo to his_). Dead!    CAMPBELL (_turning hastily_). What is that!    MORAG. Is he dead?

Note, That if you make Hydromel by fermentation in the hot Sun (which will  last about fourty days, and requireth the greater heat) you must take it  thence, before it be quite ended working; and stop it up very close, and  set it in a cold Cellar, and not pierce it in two months, at the soonest.  It will be very good this way, if you make it so strong, as to bear an Egge  very boyant. It is best made by taking all the Canicular days into your  fermentation.      A VERY GOOD MEATH    Put three parts of water to one of honey. When the Honey is dissolved, it  is to bear an Egge boyant. Boil it and skim it perfectly clear. You may  boil in it Pellitory of the wall, Agrimony, or what herbs you please. To  every ten Gallons of water, take Ginger, Cinnamon, _ana_, one Ounce,  Nutmegs half an Ounce. Divide this quantity (sliced and bruised) into two  parts. Boil the one in the Meath, severing it from the Liquor, when it is  boiled, by running through a strainer; and hang the other parcel in the  barrel by the bung in a bag with a bullet in it. When it is cold, Tun it.  And then you may work it with barm if you please; but it is most commended  without.      TO MAKE WHITE METHEGLIN    Take the Honey-combs, that the Honey is run out from them, and lay them in  water over night; next day strain them, and put the Liquor a boiling; Then  take the whites of two or three Eggs, and clarifie the Liquor. When you  have so done, skim it clean. Then take a handful of Peny-royal; four  handfuls of Angelica; a handful of Rosemary; a handful of Borrage; a  handful of Maidenhair, a handful of Harts-tongue; of Liverwort, of  Water-cresses, of Scurvy-grass, _ana_, a handful; of the Roots of  Marshmallows, Parsley, Fennel, _ana_, one Ounce. Let all these boil  together in the Liquor, the space of a quarter of an hour. Then strain the  Liquor from them, and let it cool, till it be Blood-warm. Put in so much  honey, until an Egge swim on it; and when your honey is melted, then put it  into the Barrel. When it is almost cold, put a little Ale barm to it; And  when it hath done working, put into your barrel a bag of Spice of Nutmegs,  Ginger, Cloves and Mace, and grains good store; and if you will, put into a  Lawn-bag two grains of Ambergreece and two grains of Musk, and fasten it in  the mouth of your barrel, and so let it hang in the Liquor.      A MOST EXCELLENT METHEGLIN    Take one part of honey, to eight parts of Rain or River-water; let it boil  gently together, in a fit vessel, till a third part be wasted, skiming it  very well. The sign of being boiled enough is, when a New-laid-egg swims  upon it. Cleanse it afterwards by letting it run through a clean  Linnen-cloth, and put it into a woodden Runlet, where there hath been wine  in, and hang in it a bag with Mustard-seeds by the bung, that so you may  take it out, when you please. This being done, put your Runlet into the hot  Sun, especially during the Dog-days, (which is the onely time to prepare  it) and your Metheglin will boil like Must; after which boiling take out  your Mustard-seeds, and put your vessel well stopped into a Cellar. If you  will have it the taste of wine, put to thirty measures of Hydromel, one  measure of the juyce of hops, and it will begin to boil without any heat.  Then fill up your vessel, and presently after this ebullition you will have  a very strong Metheglin.      TO MAKE WHITE METHEGLIN OF THE COUNTESS OF DORSET    Take Rosemary, Thyme, Sweet-bryar, Peny-royal, Bays, Water-cresses,  Agrimony, Marshmallow leaves, Liver-wort, Maiden-hair, Betony, Eye-bright,  Scabious, the bark of the Ash-tree, Eringo-roots, Green-wild-Angelica,  Ribwort, Sanicle, Roman-worm-wood, Tamarisk, Mother-thyme, Sassafras,  Philipendula, of each of these herbs a like proportion; or of as many of  them as you please to put in. But you must put in all but four handfuls of  herbs, which you must steep one night, and one day, in a little bowl of  water, being close covered; the next day take another quantity of fresh  water, and boil the same herbs in it, till the colour be very high; then  take another quantity of water, and boil the same herbs in it, until they  look green; and so let it boil three or four times in several waters, as  long as the Liquor looketh any thing green. Then let it stand with these  herbs in it a day and night. Remember the last water you boil it in to this  proportion of herbs, must be twelve gallons of water, and when it hath  stood a day and a night, with these herbs in it, after the last boiling,  then strain the Liquor from the herbs, and put as much of the finest and  best honey into the Liquor, as will make it bear an Egg. You must work and  labour the honey and liquor together one whole day, until the honey be  consumed. Then let it stand a whole night, and then let it be well laboured  again, and let it stand again a clearing, and so boil it again a quarter of  an hour, with the whites of six New-laid-eggs with the shells, the yolks  being taken out; so scum it very clean, and let it stand a day a cooling.  Then put it into a barrel, and take Cloves, Mace, Cinamon, and Nutmegs, as  much as will please your taste, and beat them altogether; put them into a  linnen bag, and hang it with a thread in the barrel. Take heed you put not  too much spice in; a little will serve. Take the whites of two or three  New-laid-eggs, a spoonful of barm, and a spoonful of Wheat-flower, and beat  them altogether, and put it into your Liquor into the barrel, and let it  work, before you stop it. Then afterwards stop it well, and close it well  with clay and Salt tempered together, and let it be set in a close place;  and when it hath been settled some six weeks, draw it into bottles, and  stop it very close, and drink it not a month after: but it will keep well  half a year, and more.      ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE WHITE METHEGLIN    Take ten Gallons of water; then take six handfuls of Sweet-bryar; as much  of Sweet-marjoram; and as much of Muscovy. Three handfuls of the best  Broad-thyme. Boil these together half an hour; then strain them. Then take  two Gallons of English-honey, and dissolve it in this hot Liquor, and brew  it well together; then set it over the fire to boil again, and skim it very  clean; then take the whites of thirty Eggs wel beaten, and put them into  the Liquor, and let it boil an hour; then strain it through a jelly bag,  and let it stand 24 hours cooling: then put it up in a vessel. Then take  six Nutmegs, six fair Races of Ginger, a quarter of an Ounce of Cloves,  half an Ounce of Cinamon; bruise all these together, and put them into a  Linnen-bag, with a little Pebble-stone to make it sink. Then hang it in the  vessel. You may adde to it, if you please, two grains of Ambergreece, and  one grain of Musk. Stop the vessel with a Cork, but not too close, for six  days; then taste it: and if it taste enough of the Spice, then take out the  bag; if not, let the bag hang in it, and stop it very close, and meddle  with it no more. It will be ready to drink in nine or ten weeks.      A RECEIPT TO MAKE GOOD MEATH    Take as many Gallons of water, as you intend to make of Meath; and to every  Gallon put a quart of honey, and let it boil till it bear an Egg. To every  Gallon you allow the white of an Egg, which white you must remove and break  with your hands, and put into the Kettle, before you put it over the fire.  Before it boileth, there will arise a skum, which must be taken off very  clean, as it riseth. Put to every Gallon two Nutmegs sliced, and when it  hath boiled enough, take it off, and set it a cooling in clean  wort-vessels: And when it is as cold as wort, put in a little barm, and  work it like Beer, and when it hath done working, stop it up, and let it  stand two months.      ANOTHER TO MAKE MEATH    To every quart of honey allow six Wine-quarts of water; half an Ounce of  Nutmegs, and the Peel of a Limon, and the meat of two or three, as you make  the quantity. Boil these together, till the scum rise no more; It must  stand till it be quite cold, and when you Tun it, you squeese into it the  juyce of some Limons, and this will make it ripen quickly. It will be ready  in less then a month.      ANOTHER RECIPE    Take twelve Gallons of water, a handful of Muscovy (which is an herb, that  smelleth like Musk), a handful of Sweet-Marjoram, and as much of  Sweet-bryar. Boil all these in the water, till all the strength be out.  Then take it off and strain it out, and being almost cold, sweeten it with  honey very strong, more then to bear an Egg, (the meaning of this is, that  when there is honey enough to bear an Egg, which will be done by one part  of honey to three or four quarts of water: then you add to it a pretty deal  of honey more, at least 1/4 or 1/3 of what you did put in at first to make  it bear an Egg: then it is to be boiled and scummed: when it is thus  strong, you may keep it four years before you drink it. But at the end of  two years you may draw it out into bottles) just above it, else it will not  keep very long: for the more honey the better. Then set it over the fire  till it boils, and scum it very clean. Then take it from the fire, and let  it stand, till it be cold: then put it into your vessel. Take Mace, Cloves,  Nutmegs, Ginger, of each a quarter of an Ounce: beat them small, and hang  them in your vessel (being stopped close) in a little bag.    Note, when any Meath or Metheglin grows hard or sower with keeping too  long, dissolve in it a good quantity of fresh honey, to make it pleasantly  Sweet; (but boil it no more, after it hath once fermented, as it did at the  first Tunning) and with that it will ferment again, and become very good  and pleasant and quick.      TO MAKE METHEGLIN    Take of Rosemary three handfuls, of Winter-savory a Peck by measure, Organ  and Thyme, as much, White-wort two handfuls, Blood-wort half a peck, Hyssop  two handfuls, Marygolds, Borage, Fennil, of each two handfuls;"]]]
