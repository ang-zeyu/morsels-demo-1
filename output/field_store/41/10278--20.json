The Child Welfare Act should be broadened to provide for the doing  of preventive work. At present it provides only for the correction of  children who have committed offences or who are delinquents. There are  also grave weaknesses in this statute and in the whole procedure for  dealing with offending and delinquent children.          _XVIII. Recommendations_      =(1) Proposals for Legislation=      (_a_) The definition of \"obscene\" and \"indecent\" in the statute law  relating to printed and published matter should be enlarged so as to  cover all productions which are harmful in that they place undue  emphasis on sex, crime, or horror.      (_b_) All distributors of books, magazines, and periodical (other than  newspapers and educational or scientific publications) should be  required to register their names and the names of their various  publications. If they offend against the proposed law regarding  objectionable publications, their licences to produce or distribute  should be cancelled.      (_c_) A new offence should be created whereunder boys and girls who are  guilty of indecent conduct with one another should both be liable to be  charged as delinquents in the Children's Court and the practice of  recording the names of boys in the _Police Gazette_ as having been  summarily dealt with should cease.      (_d_) In all cases where children are summoned to Court their parents  (if available) should be required to attend with them.      (_e_) The Court should have the power to require the parent or guardian  of an offending or delinquent child to pay the fine or costs and to give  security for the future good behaviour of the child unless the Court is  satisfied that the conduct of the parent or guardian has not conduced to  the child's wrong doing.      (_f_) The Court should also be given power to direct that the children's  benefit or family benefit payable to any parent or guardian by the  Social Security Commission be suspended until he gives the security  required by the Court or for such further or other period as the Court  may order. The material interests of the child should be preserved by  enabling the Court to suspend the operation of the order, or to cancel  it upon being satisfied that the parent or guardian has given the  required security to exercise due care and control.      (_g_) Effect should be given to the recommendations regarding enrolment  or expulsion of children as set out in Section XVI (5) (_d_) and (_e_)  of this report.      (_h_) The Child Welfare Act should be completely recast in such a way as  to remove the weaknesses indicated in this report and to suit modern  needs. \"Child welfare\" should be given an autonomous status under the  Minister of Social Welfare.      =(2) Proposals for Administrative Action=    The following outlines of administrative action are not dependent upon  the amending of any Acts of Parliament such as were recommended above:      _(a) Police Department_    The training and duties of policewomen should be considered with a view  to deciding the best method of dealing with girls involved in sexual  offences.      _(b) Department of Internal Affairs (Films)_    To facilitate the practical working of film censorship steps should be  taken to gazette the outstanding regulations empowered under the  relevant Acts of 1934 and 1953.      _(c) Broadcasting Service_    It is suggested:      (i) That the service ensure that the concept \"Crime must never    pay\" is more prominently featured in crime serials.      (ii) That a married woman be immediately appointed to the    auditioning panel.      _(d) Censoring Authorities_    Any Departments concerned with censorship should maintain a liaison to  produce as far as possible a uniform interpretation of public opinion  and taste.      _(e) Department of Education_    (i) The Department of Education should discuss with the Department of  Health the respective duties of public health nurses and visiting  teachers to prevent overlapping and to ensure the best possible  employment of these officers.    (ii) Following upon the conference outlined in the previous paragraph  the appointment of additional visiting teachers should be accorded  priority.    (iii) The Department should consider what type of officer is best suited  to help with problem pupils in post-primary schools.    (iv) The Department should request that residences be set aside for some  teachers in housing settlements.    (v) In areas where there is a lack of facilities for recreation and  entertainment the Department should consider the possibility of making  school grounds and buildings available to responsible organizations.      _(f) Research into Juvenile Delinquency_    A long-term project for the investigation of juvenile delinquency in all  aspects should be undertaken.      =(3) Parental Example=    New laws, new regulations, and the prospect of stricter administration  may help to allay the well-founded fears of many parents for the future  of their children. It would, however, be a pity if parents were thereby  led into any relaxation of their own efforts. Wise parenthood implies  firm control and continual interest in the doings of sons and daughters.  But what is most needed is that all people should, by right living and  by the regularity of their own conduct, afford the best example for the  conduct of the rising generation.          _XIX. Appreciation_    As a supplement to this report the Committee desires to place on record  its thanks to all those who have assisted it in discharging its  responsibilities.    The many organizations and witnesses who have expressed their views have  been most helpful, and the Committee is also obliged to all those who  have sent letters, books, and papers for consideration. The many press  clippings of editorials, news articles, and letters to editors have  enabled the Committee to obtain an understanding of public sentiment on  various matters.    The heads of Government Departments have answered every inquiry for  information which has been submitted to them.    The Public Service Commission has placed facilities at the disposal of  the Committee and has released stenographers and typists from their  ordinary duties to enable this report to be presented on the date fixed  by the Committee early in its deliberations.    In particular, the Committee expresses its great appreciation of the  manner in which Mr L.J. Greenberg has performed the secretarial duties.  He has dealt with correspondence, and has shown a splendid sense of  timing in arranging for the appearance of witnesses.          =APPENDIX A=    =Table of Sexual Offences for Which Proceedings Were Taken in New Zealand=                         _1920  1925  1930  1935  1940  1941  1942  1943  1944_  Rape and   attempted rape        11    16    16    19    12     6    22    40    34    Carnally knowing    girls under 16       14    55    68    86    99    41    69    69    71    Attempts to carnally    know girls under 16   7     9     8    14    15     6     5     5     2    Indecent assault:    Females              63    98   107   122   153   113   171   105   134    Indecent assault:    Males                12    47    38    46   103   104   118    68    61                             _1945  1946  1947  1948  1949  1950  1951  1952  1953_  Rape and   attempted rape        27    14    32    14    24    31    29    35    19    Carnally knowing    girls under 16       59    73    66    61    82    90    81   106   109    Attempts to carnally    know girls under 16  17    18    14    13     7    27    23    36    33    Indecent assault:    Females             112   104   147   164   153   149   183   175   311    Indecent assault:    Males               119    89   109   110    86    82    91   122   183          =APPENDIX B=      =List of Witnesses, Submissions, and Order of Appearance=    One hundred and forty-five (145) witnesses appeared before the Committee  in Wellington, Christchurch, or Auckland, and 18 of these witnesses were  recalled on one or more occasion.    _(a) Witnesses_    Witnesses are grouped as follows:    _Government Officials_--      Departmental Heads: Broadcasting, Education, Police.

That was yesterday afternoon, and this  morning the superintendent sends me to see how he is.\"    I looked more blankly ignorant than before.    \"He's kept it dark, I see, sir. There isn't a bigger fool alive than  Robins when he's drunk--which he mostly--what is--and he acted yesterday  up to the usual form of drunks. He _would_ go on the ice just below  the locks, when it would hardly bear a sparrer, let alone a drunk Robin,  and he naturally goes under before he'd gone a dozen yards. Mr. Todd went  for him without, I fancy, considering the risks. He broke the ice up to  that forsaken Robins, and waded in after him. When _we_ got there he  was up to his neck in water, and he'd got the fool by the collar; then we  pulled 'em both out. Mind, up to his chin in that frozen water! We  thought Robins was a goner from cold when we landed 'im, and asked Mr.  Todd's name as bein' likely to be required at the inquest. But, bless  you, sir, Robins pulled through all right; that sort generally does.\"    \"Was there any one to help Todd, when he went for the fellow?\"    \"No, sir; he just waded in and took his chance. I wouldn't--at least not  for an ord'nary drunk. Mr. Todd just ran home as he was: said the sprint  would warm him to rights. How is he?\"    \"Got a vile cold; he was barking pretty well all chapel.\"    \"And Robins,\" said the policeman, in disgust, \"doesn't own up to a  snuffle. This Mr. Todd's house, sir?\"    \"Yes. I'd just ask to see Mr. Taylor, the house-master, first. I fancy  he'll be pleased to see you.\"    The constable's plain, unvarnished tale gave the Rev. E. Taylor as  pleasant a ten minutes as he had enjoyed for some time, and he passed on  the worthy man to the butler with instructions as to \"something hot.\"  Then he rapped on Todd's door.    Decidedly the ship _Agustus Vernon Robert Todd_ \"had found herself.\"          CHAPTER XVII    RAFFLES' BILL      It was with hearty thankfulness at the idea of being finally rid of  Raffles that Jack walked over to the \"Lodestone\" by himself on the  Thursday, jingling his last few shillings in his pockets. Raffles was  waiting for him in the stables, and he was very friendly and familiar,  which always annoyed Jack immensely.    \"Glad you're in time, sir, and to 'ear the dibs a-rattlin' in your  pockets.\"    \"Because they'll rattle in yours, soon, I suppose. I make out I owe you  about ten shillings, Raffles.\"    \"'Ow do you make that out, Mr. Bourne?\"    \"Rabbits, cartridges, and dummy pigeons. I'm about right, I fancy?\"    \"Right as far as they go.\"    \"As far as they go, of course--not farther. Then here you are.\"    \"And the gun,\" said Raffles, calmly, looking into vacancy, and not  seeing Jack's coins--\"leastwise, wot was a gun.\"    \"Am I to pay for that filthy article?\" said Jack, angrily. \"Why, it  nearly blew my brains out!\"    \"'As'e to pay for that breech-loader gun?\" said Raffles, laughing  softly as at some good joke. \"Why, of course you have.\"    \"My opinion is, Raffles, that that gun was rotten. It wasn't worth a  sovereign. I don't believe it was ever fit to shoot with, now.\"    \"Of course, _now_,\" said Raffles, with a sneer. \"_Now_, when you've got  to pay for it.\"    \"I don't know so much about 'have got to pay for it' at all. That grin  of yours doesn't improve your looks, Raffles,\" said Jack, who was rather  nettled by Raffles' sneer.    \"Well, my bantam cock,\" said Raffles, savagely, \"I only 'opes as this  'ere bill won't spoil yours. And let me tell you, young shaver, I want  the money.\"    Jack calmly took the piece of note-paper which Raffles hurriedly fished  out of his pocket, and flourished dramatically before Bourne. There was  a touching simplicity about Raffles' bill-making that would in ordinary  times have made Jack split with laughter, but, naturally, at the present  time he did not feel in a very jovial frame of mind. Hence he read  through the farrago with only one very strong desire--to kick Raffles  neck and crop out of the stable. This was the bill:--      Mr. burn owes me daniel raffles this money.      To bunneys at sixpence each... 2 0    To 50 cartrigges......         6 6    To pidgins.........            1 6    1 gunn breech loder......  L7  0 0                               _______    totel                      L7 10 0    \"Now, Raffles,\" said Jack, in a white heat, \"what do you mean by this  rotten foolery?\"    \"There's no foolery about it,\" said Raffles, sulkily. \"That's my bill.\"    \"Why, you unspeakable rascal, did you fancy I'd pay it?\"    \"I did, and I do.\"    Something in the fellow's tone made Jack a trifle uneasy, and he  considered within himself for a moment what he had better do. That the  rascal had made up his mind to be nasty was evident, and when Jack  thought that the gun, poor as it was, was destroyed, though through no  fault of his own, he thought perhaps he might give his old jackal  something as a solatium.    \"All right, Raffles! I'll pay you for what I owe you now, and I'll give  you a sovereign for the gun. I'll send you that in a day or two. I've no  more money with me now.\"    \"That ain't the bill. I want this 'ere bill paid.\"    \"'This 'ere bill' is sheer rot!\" retorted Jack.    \"Rot or not, it's what I want from you. You pay up that seven odd, or it  will be the worse for you. What is seven odd to a young gent like you?  Aren't you all millionaires at St. Amory's?\"    \"Not by a long chalk.\"    \"Well, I don't want to be unpleasant, my buck, but if you won't pay over  I'll show you up.\"    \"Show me up, you beast--what do you mean?\"    \"I'll write to Corker and blow the gaff.\"    \"If you did that,\" said Bourne, grimly, \"I'd kill you first day I could  do it.\"    [Illustration: \"I'M GOING TO HAVE THE SEVEN TEN, OR SHOW YOU UP.\"]    \"Or I'd write to your brother.\"    \"And he'd do it now, you skunk!\"    \"No names, young gent. That won't pay my bill. You don't seem to imagine  I mean what I say.\"    \"No, I don't, for you wouldn't be any _nearer_ getting the money.\"    \"But then you say you aren't going to pay anyhow, so I may as well touch  you up a bit. You've most every time told me not to be so beastly  friendly, and I ain't going to be. I'm going to have the seven ten or  show you up. That's straight.\"    \"Show me up,\" repeated Jack, blankly. \"You miserable blackmailer!\"  Bourne felt then the beautiful feelings of being in the grasp of a  low-bred cad who could play with him as a cat with a mouse. He sat  staring in front of him livid with rage, and Raffles, who was watching  him covertly, and with no small anxiety, could see he was digesting the  whole situation. Jack would indeed then and there have let Raffles do  his worst, and would have stood the racket from Corker--and his  brother--rather than be blackmailed by the villain by his side, but he  said hopelessly to himself, \"How can I do it without bringing Acton into  it? When this comes out all his training with the Coon must come out  too; perhaps he'll lose his monitorship for not keeping his hand on me,  and Phil's done him a bad enough turn already. I can't round on him.  Heavens! I can't do that.\"    This reads rather pitiful, doesn't it, under the circumstances?    Jack at the end of his resources tried a desperate bluff.    \"I'll put Acton on your track, my beauty, and perhaps he'll make you  see--or feel--reason.\"    \"That game's no good, young shaver. I don't want to see Mr. Acting no  more than you want to tell him of your little blow-outs. Look here, are  you going to pay? Yes or no?\"    \"I haven't got the money,\" said Jack, at his wits' end.    \"Ho! that's very likely,\" said Raffles, with a sneer; \"anyhow, you could  mighty soon get it if you wanted to.\"    \"How?\"    \"Why, borrow it, of course. Ask your chum, Mr. Acting. _He_ 'as money.  No end of brass, the Coon says.\"    \"I can't do that,\" said Jack, in utter despair.    \"Orl right,\" said Raffles, seeing his shot had told. \"I see you ain't  got the money on you now, and I don't want to be too 'ard on you. I'll  give you a chance. I'll give you till Saturday to turn it over. My  advice is to borrow from Mr. Acting. He'll lend it you, I should think;  anyhow, I can't stand shilly-shallying here all night, no more than I  can stand the loss of that grand gun, so I'm off. Have the money by  Saturday at three, or I blow the gaff and you can be hung up or cut up  for all I care. I'm not going to be more beastly friendly nor more  chummy than that.\"    Raffles lurched off with a savage leer, and Jack staggered back to St.  Amory's.    Jack's life was a burden to him for the next few hours, his head nearly  split with the hatching of impossible plans with loopholes to escape the  weasel on his track, but the end was as Acton had foreseen. Acton got a  note through Grim.    \"DEAR ACTON,    \"Could you give me ten minutes in your study to-night?--Yours,  \"J. BOURNE.\"    \"DEAR BOURNE,    \"Twenty, if you like.--Yours,  \"J. ACTON.\"    Jack went, and when Acton put him into the easy-chair and noticed his  white, fagged face, he felt genuinely sorry for him.    \"You look seedy, young 'un.\"    \"I hope I don't look as seedy as I feel, that's all.\"    \"What's the matter?\"    Jack boggled over what he'd come to say, but finally blurted out:  \"Acton, would you lend me seven pounds? I'm in a hole, the deuce of a  hole; in fact, I'm pretty well hopelessly stumped. I'll tell you why if  you ask me, but I hope you won't. I've been an ass, but I've collared  some awful luck, and I'm not quite the black sheep I seem. I don't"]]]
