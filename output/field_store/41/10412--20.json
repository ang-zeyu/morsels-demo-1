Their deliberations were unceasing; their schemes innumerable; their  hearts divided and unnerved. Those secret chambers, from which that  haughty oligarchy had for so many ages excluded every eye and every  voice but their own, were invaded with impunity by strange-faced men,  who boldly criticised their measures, and heaped new terrors on their  heads, by announcing that the mass of the people had ceased to consider  the endurance of their sway as synonymous with the prosperity of Venice.  Popular tumults filled the streets and canals; universal confusion  prevailed. The commanders of their troops and fleets received  contradictory orders, and the city which        \"--had held the gorgeous East in fee,\"    seemed ready to yield everything to a ruthless and implacable enemy,  without even striking a blow in defence.    Buonaparte appeared, while the confusion was at its height, on the  opposite coast of the Lagoon. Some of his troops were already in the  heart of the city, when (31st May) a hasty message reached him,  announcing that the Senate submitted wholly. He exacted severe revenge.  The leaders who had aided the Lombard insurgents were delivered to him.  The oligarchy ceased to rule, and a democratical government was formed,  provisionally, on the model of France. Venice consented to surrender to  the victor large territories on the mainland of Italy; five ships of  war; 3,000,000 francs in gold, and as many more in naval stores; twenty  of the best pictures, and 500 manuscripts. Lastly, the troops of the  conqueror were to occupy the capital until tranquillity was established.  It will be seen in what that tranquillity was destined to consist.    Such was the humiliation of this once proud and energetic, but now  worn-out and enfeebled, oligarchy: so incapable was that hoary polity of  contending with the youthful vigour of Napoleon.    [Footnote 17: The armorial bearing of Venice.]          CHAPTER IX         Pichegru--The Directory appeal to Buonaparte--The 18th       Fructidor--The Court of Montebello--Josephine--The Treaty of       Campo-Formio--Buonaparte leaves Italy.      In their last agony the Venetian Senate made a vain effort to secure the  personal protection of the general, by offering him a purse of seven  millions of francs. He rejected this with scorn. He had already treated  in the same style a bribe of four millions, tendered on the part of the  Duke of Modena. The friend employed to conduct the business reminded him  of the proverbial ingratitude of all popular governments, and of the  little attention which the Directory had hitherto paid to his personal  interests. \"That is all true enough,\" said Napoleon, \"but for four  millions I will not place myself in the power of this duke.\" Austria  herself, it is said, did not hesitate to tamper in the same manner,  though far more magnificently, as became her resources, with his  republican virtue. He was offered, if the story be true, an independent  German principality for himself and his heirs. \"I thank the emperor,\" he  answered, \"but if greatness is to be mine, it shall come from France.\"    The Venetian Senate were guilty, in their mortal struggle, of another  and a more inexcusable piece of meanness. They seized the person of  Count D'Entraigues, a French emigrant, who had been living in their city  as agent for the exiled house of Bourbon; and surrendered him and all  his papers to the victorious general. Buonaparte discovered among these  documents ample evidence that Pichegru, the French general on the Rhine,  and universally honoured as the conqueror of Holland, had some time  before this hearkened to the proposals of the Bourbon princes, and,  among other efforts in favour of the royal cause, not hesitated even to  misconduct his military movements with a view to the downfall of the  government which had entrusted him with his command.    This was a secret, the importance of which Napoleon could well  appreciate;[18] and he forthwith communicated it to the Directory at  Paris.    The events of the last twelve months in France had made Pichegru a  person of still higher importance than when he commenced his intrigues  with the Bourbons as general on the Rhine. Some obscure doubts of his  fidelity, or the usual policy of the Directory, which rendered them  averse (wherever they could help it) to continue any one general very  long at the head of one army, had induced them to displace Pichegru, and  appoint Hoche, a tried republican, in his room. Pichegru, on returning  to France, became a member of the Council of Five Hundred, and (the  royalist party having at this season recovered all but a preponderance)  was, on the meeting of the chambers, called to the chair of that in  which he had his place.    The Five Directors had in truth done everything to undermine their own  authority. They were known to be divided in opinion among themselves;  three only of their number adhered heartily to the existing  constitution: one was a royalist: another was a democrat of the  Robespierre school. One of these new and uncourtly men excited laughter  by affecting a princely state and splendour of demeanour and equipage.  Another disgusted one set of minds, and annoyed all the rest, by  procuring a law for the observation of the tenth day as the day of  repose, and declaring it a crime to shut up shops on the Sabbath. A  ridiculous ritual of an avowedly heathen worship followed, and was  received with partial horror, universal contempt. A tyrannical law about  the equalisation of weights and measures spread confusion through all  mercantile transactions, and was especially unpopular in the provinces.  A contemptible riot, set on foot by one who called himself Gracchus  Barboeuf, for the purpose of bringing back the reign of _terrorism_ was  indeed suppressed; but the mere occurrence of such an attempt recalled  too vividly the days of Robespierre, and by so doing tended to  strengthen the cause of the royalists in public opinion. The truth is,  that a vast number of the emigrants had found their way back again to  Paris after the downfall of Robespierre, and that the old sway of  elegant manners and enlightened saloons was once more re-establishing  itself where it had so long been supreme. The royalist club of Clichy  corresponded with the exiled princes, and with the imperial government,  and was gaining such influence as to fill Buonaparte himself with alarm.  Everything indicated that the Directory (the _five majesties_ of the  Luxembourg, as they were called in derision) held their thrones by a  very uncertain tenure; and those gentlemen, nothing being left them but  a choice among evils, were fain to throw themselves on the protection of  the armies which they dreaded, and of Hoche and Buonaparte--which last  name in particular had long filled them with jealousy proportioned to  its splendour and popularity.    Napoleon's recent conduct, in more important points than one, had  excited powerfully the resentment of the Directory, which now appealed  to him for aid. He had taken upon himself the whole responsibility of  the preliminary treaty of Leoben, although the French government had  sent General Clarke into Italy for the express purpose of controlling  him, and acting as his equal at least in the negotiation. A clause in  that treaty, by which Mantua, the strongest fortress in Italy, was to be  surrendered back to Austria, had been judged necessary at the time by  the general, in order to obtain from the emperor the boundary of the  Rhine and the cession of Belgium. But the Directory thought the  conqueror underrated the advantages of his own position and theirs in  consenting to it, and but for Carnot would never have ratified it.[19]  At the other side of the Italian Peninsula, again, the victorious  general, immediately after the fall of Venice, had to superintend the  revolution of Genoa; in which great city also the democratic party  availed themselves of the temper and events of the time, to emancipate  themselves from their hereditary oligarchy. They would fain have  excluded the nobility from all share in the remodelled government; and  Napoleon rebuked and discountenanced this attempt in terms little likely  to be heard with approbation by the \"_Sires_ of the Luxembourg.\" He told  the Genoese, that to exclude the nobles was in itself as unjust as  unwise, and that they ought to be grateful for the means of  re-organising their constitution, without passing _like France_ through  the terrible ordeal of a revolution. The rulers of France might be  excused for asking at this moment--Does the lecturer of the Ligurian  Republic mean to be our Washington, our Monk, or our Cromwell?    He, however, received with alacrity the call of the trembling Directory.  He harangued his soldiery, and made himself secure of their readiness to  act as he might choose for them. He not only offered large pecuniary  supplies, and sent his lieutenant Augereau to Paris to command the  National Guard for the government, should they find it necessary to  appeal immediately to force, but announced that he was himself prepared  to \"pass the Rubicon,\" (an ominous phrase) and march to their  assistance, with 15,000 of his best troops.    The Directory, meanwhile, had in their extremity ventured to disregard  the law against drawing regular troops within a certain distance of the  capital, and summoned Hoche to bring a corps of his Rhenish army for  their instant protection.    It was by this means that the new revolution, as it may be called, of  the 18th Fructidor was effected. On that day, (Sept. 4, 1797,) the  majority of the Directory, marching their army into Paris, dethroned"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17587"],[0,"Field Hospital and Flying Column (#17)"],[1,"Monsieur Goochkoff did their  business. The old, dark hall, with armour hanging on the walls and  worm-eaten furniture covered with priceless tapestry, would have made a  splendid picture. A huge log fire burning on the open hearth lighted up  the dark faces of the two Turkestan soldiers who were standing on guard  at the door. In one corner a young lieutenant was taking interminable  messages from the field telephone, and under the window another  Turkestan soldier stood sharpening his dagger. The Prince asked him  what he was doing, and his dark face lighted up. \"Every night at eight,\"  he said, still sharpening busily, \"I go out and kill some Germans.\" The  men of this Turkestan regiment are said to be extraordinarily brave men.  They do not care at all about a rifle, but prefer to be at closer  quarters with the enemy with their two-edged dagger, and the Germans  like them as little as they like our own Gurkhas and Sikhs.    The next day the wounded began to arrive in Skiernevice, and in two  days' time the temporary hospital was full.    The Tsar had a private theatre at Skiernevice with a little separate  station of its own about 200 yards farther down the line than the  ordinary station, and in many ways this made quite a suitable hospital  except for the want of a proper water-supply.    The next thing we heard was that the Russian General had decided to fall  back once more, and we must be prepared to move at any moment.    All that day we heard violent cannonading going on and all the next  night, though the hospital was already full, the little country carts  came in one after another filled with wounded. They were to only stay  one night, as in the morning ambulance trains were coming to take them  all away, and we had orders to follow as soon as the last patient had  gone. Another operating- and dressing-room was quickly improvised, but  even with the two going hard all night it was difficult to keep pace  with the number brought in.    The scenery had never been taken down after the last dramatic  performance played in the theatre, and wounded men lay everywhere  between the wings and drop scenes. The auditorium was packed so closely  that you could hardly get between the men without treading on some one's  hands and feet as they lay on the floor. The light had given out--in the  two dressing-rooms there were oil-lamps, but in the rest of the place we  had to make do with candle-ends stuck into bottles. The foyer had been  made into a splendid kitchen, where hot tea and boiling soup could be  got all night through. This department was worked by the local Red  Cross Society, and was a great credit to them.    About eight o'clock in the morning the first ambulance train came in,  and was quickly filled with patients. We heard that the Germans were now  very near, and hoped we should manage to get away all the wounded before  they arrived.    The second train came up about eleven, and by that time a fierce rifle  encounter was going on. From the hospital window we could see the  Russian troops firing from the trenches near the railway. Soon there was  a violent explosion that shook the place; this was the Russians blowing  up the railway bridge on the western side of the station.    The second train went off, and there were very few patients left now,  though some were still being brought in at intervals by the Red Cross  carts. Our automobiles had started off to Warsaw with some wounded  officers, but the rest of the column had orders to go to Zyradow by the  last train to leave Skiernevice.    The sanitars now began to pack up the hospital; we did not mean to leave  anything behind for the enemy if we could help it. The few bedsteads  were taken to pieces and tied up, the stretchers put together and the  blankets tied up in bundles. When the last ambulance train came up about  2 P. M. the patients were first put in, and then every portable  object that could be removed was packed into the train too. At the last  moment, when the train was just about to start, one of the sanitars ran  back and triumphantly brought out a pile of dirty soup plates to add to  the collection. Nothing was left in the hospital but two dead men we had  not time to bury.    The wounded were all going to Warsaw and the other Russian Sisters went  on in the train with them. But our destination was Zyradow, only the  next station but one down the line.    When we arrived at Zyradow about three o'clock we were looking forward  to a bath and tea and bed, as we had been up all night and were very  tired; but the train most unkindly dropped us about a quarter of a mile  from the station, and we had to get out all our equipment and heavy  cases of dressings, and put them at the side of the line, while Julian,  the Prince's soldier servant, went off to try and find a man and a cart  for the things. There was a steady downpour of rain, and we were soaked  by the time he came back saying that there was nothing to be had at all.  The station was all in crumbling ruins, so we could not leave the things  there, and our precious dressings were beginning to get wet. Finally we  got permission to put them in a closed cinema theatre near the station,  but it was dark by that time, and we were wet and cold and began once  more to centre our thoughts on baths and tea. We were a small  party--only six of us--Princess, we two Sisters, Colonel S., a Russian  dresser, and Julian. We caught a local Red Crosser. \"Where is the  hotel?\" \"There is no hotel here.\" \"Where can we lodge for to-night?\" \"I  don't know where you could lodge.\" \"Where is the Red Cross Bureau?\"  asked Princess, in desperation. \"About a quarter of an hour's walk. I  will show you the way.\"    We got to the Red Cross Bureau to find that Monsieur Goochkoff had not  yet arrived, though he was expected, and they could offer no solution of  our difficulties, except to advise us to go to the Factory Hospital and  see if they could make any arrangement for us. The Matron there was  _very_ kind, and telephoned to every one she could think of, and finally  got a message that we were expected, and were to sleep at the Reserve.  So we trudged once more through the mud and rain. The \"Reserve\" was two  small, empty rooms, where thirty Sisters were going to pass the night.  They had no beds, and not even straw, but were just going to lie on the  floor in their clothes. There was obviously no room for six more of us,  and finally we went back once more to the Red Cross Bureau. Princess  seized an empty room, and announced that we were going to sleep in it.  We were told we couldn't, as it had been reserved for somebody else; but  we didn't care, and got some patients' stretchers from the depot and lay  down on them in our wet clothes just as we were. In the middle of the  night the \"somebody\" for whom the room had been kept arrived, strode  into the room, and turned up the electric light. The others were really  asleep, and I pretended to be. He had a good look at us, and then strode  out again grunting. We woke up every five minutes, it was so dreadfully  cold, and though we were so tired, I was not sorry when it was time to  get up.    We had breakfast at a dirty little restaurant in the town, and then got  a message from the Red Cross that there would be nothing for us to do  that day, but that we were probably going to be sent to Radzowill the  following morning. So we decided to go off to the Factory Hospital and  see if we could persuade the Matron to let us have a bath there.    Zyradow is one very large cotton and woollen factory, employing about  5000 hands. In Russia it is the good law that for every hundred workmen  employed there shall be one hospital bed provided. In the small  factories a few beds in the local hospital are generally subsidized, in  larger ones they usually find it more convenient to have their own. So  here there was a very nice little hospital with fifty beds, which had  been stretched now to hold twice as many more, as a great many wounded  had to be sent in here. The Matron is a Pole of Scottish extraction, and  spoke fluent but quite foreign English with a strong Scotch accent.  There are a good many Scotch families here, who came over and settled in  Poland about a hundred years ago, and who are all engaged in different  departments in the factory. She was kindness itself, and gave us tea  first and then prepared a hot bath for us all in turn. We got rid of  most of our tormentors and were at peace once more.    As we left the hospital we met three footsore soldiers whose boots were  absolutely worn right through. They were coming up to the hospital to  see if the Matron had any dead men's boots that would fit them. It  sounded rather gruesome--but she told us that that was quite a common  errand. The Russian military boots are excellent, but, of course, all  boots wear out very quickly under such trying circumstances of roads and  weather. They are top boots, strong and waterproof, and very often made  by the men themselves. The uniform, too, is very practical and so strong  that the men have told me that carpets are made from the material. The  colour is browner than our own khaki--and quite different both from the  German, which is much greyer, and the Austrian, which is almost blue. I  heard in Belgium that at the beginning of the war German soldiers were  constantly mistaken for our men.          X    BY THE TRENCHES AT RADZIVILOW      The next morning we went up to Radzivilow. It is the next station to  Skiernevice, and there was very heavy fighting going on there when we  went up. We were told we were going up on an armoured train, which  sounded very thrilling, but when we got to the station we only found a  quite ordinary carriage put on to the engine to take us up. The Russian  battery was at that time at the south of the railway line, the German  battery on the north of it--and we were in the centre of the sandwich.  At Zyradow these cannon"]]]
