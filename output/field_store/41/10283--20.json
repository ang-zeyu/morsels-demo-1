[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1487"],[0,"The Perfect Wagnerite: A Commentary on the Niblung's Ring (#17)"],[1,"ayed, there is not a bar in the work which moves  us as the same themes moved us in The Valkyries, nor is anything but  external splendor added to the life and humor of Siegfried.    In the original poem, Brynhild delays her self-immolation on the pyre of  Siegfried to read the assembled choristers a homily on the efficacy of  the Love panacea. \"My holiest wisdom's hoard,\" she says, \"now I make  known to the world. I believe not in property, nor money, nor godliness,  nor hearth and high place, nor pomp and peerage, nor contract and  custom, but in Love. Let that only prevail; and ye shall be blest in  weal or woe.\" Here the repudiations still smack of Bakoonin; but the  saviour is no longer the volition of the full-grown spirit of Man, the  Free Willer of Necessity, sword in hand, but simply Love, and not even  Shelleyan love, but vehement sexual passion. It is highly significant  of the extent to which this uxorious commonplace lost its hold of Wagner  (after disturbing his conscience, as he confesses to Roeckel, for years)  that it disappears in the full score of Night Falls On The Gods, which  was not completed until he was on the verge of producing Parsifal,  twenty years after the publication of the poem. He cut the homily out,  and composed the music of the final scene with a flagrant recklessness  of the old intention. The rigorous logic with which representative  musical themes are employed in the earlier dramas is here abandoned  without scruple; and for the main theme at the conclusion he selects a  rapturous passage sung by Sieglinda in the third act of The Valkyries  when Brynhild inspires her with a sense of her high destiny as the  mother of the unborn hero. There is no dramatic logic whatever in the  recurrence of this theme to express the transport in which Brynhild  immolates herself. There is of course an excuse for it, inasmuch as both  women have an impulse of self-sacrifice for the sake of Siegfried; but  this is really hardly more than an excuse; since the Valhalla theme  might be attached to Alberic on the no worse ground that both he and  Wotan are inspired by ambition, and that the ambition has the same  object, the possession of the ring. The common sense of the matter is  that the only themes which had fully retained their significance in  Wagner's memory at the period of the composition of Night Falls On The  Gods are those which are mere labels of external features, such as  the Dragon, the Fire, the Water and so on. This particular theme of  Sieglinda's is, in truth, of no great musical merit: it might easily  be the pet climax of a popular sentimental ballad: in fact, the gushing  effect which is its sole valuable quality is so cheaply attained that  it is hardly going too far to call it the most trumpery phrase in the  entire tetralogy. Yet, since it undoubtedly does gush very emphatically,  Wagner chose, for convenience' sake, to work up this final scene with it  rather than with the more distinguished, elaborate and beautiful themes  connected with the love of Brynhild and Siegfried.    He would certainly not have thought this a matter of no consequence had  he finished the whole work ten years earlier. It must always be borne  in mind that the poem of The Ring was complete and printed in 1853,  and represents the sociological ideas which, after germinating in the  European atmosphere for many years, had been brought home to Wagner,  who was intensely susceptible to such ideas, by the crash of 1849 at  Dresden. Now no man whose mind is alive and active, as Wagner's was to  the day of his death, can keep his political and spiritual opinions,  much less his philosophic consciousness, at a standstill for quarter  of a century until he finishes an orchestral score. When Wagner first  sketched Night Falls On The Gods he was 35. When he finished the score  for the first Bayreuth festival in 1876 he had turned 60. No wonder he  had lost his old grip of it and left it behind him. He even  tampered with The Rhine Gold for the sake of theatrical effect when  stage-managing it, making Wotan pick up and brandish a sword to give  visible point to his sudden inspiration as to the raising up of a  hero. The sword had first to be discovered by Fafnir among the Niblung  treasures and thrown away by him as useless. There is no sense in this  device; and its adoption shows the same recklessness as to the original  intention which we find in the music of the last act of The Dusk of the  Gods. [*]         * Die Gotterdammerung means literally Godsgloaming. The       English versions of the opera are usually called The Dusk of       the Gods, or The Twilight of the Gods. I have purposely       introduced the ordinary title in the sentence above for the       reader's information.          WHY HE CHANGED HIS MIND    Wagner, however, was not the man to allow his grip of a great  philosophic theme to slacken even in twenty-five years if the theme  still held good as a theory of actual life. If the history of Germany  from 1849 to 1876 had been the history of Siegfried and Wotan transposed  into the key of actual life Night Falls On The Gods would have been the  logical consummation of Das Rheingold and The Valkyrie instead of the  operatic anachronism it actually is.    But, as a matter of fact, Siegfried did not succeed and Bismarck did.  Roeckel was a prisoner whose imprisonment made no difference; Bakoonin  broke up, not Walhall, but the International, which ended in an  undignified quarrel between him and Karl Marx. The Siegfrieds of 1848  were hopeless political failures, whereas the Wotans and Alberics and  Lokis were conspicuous political successes. Even the Mimes held their own  as against Siegfried. With the single exception of Ferdinand Lassalle,  there was no revolutionary leader who was not an obvious impossibilist  in practical politics; and Lassalle got himself killed in a romantic  and quite indefensible duel after wrecking his health in a titanic  oratorical campaign which convinced him that the great majority of the  working classes were not ready to join him, and that the minority who  were ready did not understand him. The International, founded in 1861  by Karl Marx in London, and mistaken for several years by nervous  newspapers for a red spectre, was really only a turnip ghost. It  achieved some beginnings of International Trade Unionism by inducing  English workmen to send money to support strikes on the continent, and  recalling English workers who had been taken across the North Sea to  defeat such strikes; but on its revolutionary socialistic side it was a  romantic figment. The suppression of the Paris Commune, one of the  most tragic examples in history of the pitilessness with which capable  practical administrators and soldiers are forced by the pressure of  facts to destroy romantic amateurs and theatrical dreamers, made an end  of melodramatic Socialism. It was as easy for Marx to hold up Thiers  as the most execrable of living scoundrels and to put upon Gallifet the  brand that still makes him impossible in French politics as it was for  Victor Hugo to bombard Napoleon III from his paper battery in Jersey.  It was also easy to hold up Felix Pyat and Delescluze as men of much  loftier ideals than Thiers and Gallifet; but the one fact that could not  be denied was that when it came to actual shooting, it was Gallifet who  got Delescluze shot and not Delescluze who got Gallifet shot, and that  when it came to administering the affairs of France, Thiers could in  one way or another get it done, whilst Pyat could neither do it nor stop  talking and allow somebody else to do it. True, the penalty of following  Thiers was to be exploited by the landlord and capitalist; but then the  penalty of following Pyat was to get shot like a mad dog, or at best get  sent to New Caledonia, quite unnecessarily and uselessly.    To put it in terms of Wagner's allegory, Alberic had got the ring back  again and was marrying into the best Walhall families with it. He had  thought better of his old threat to dethrone Wotan and Loki. He had  found that Nibelheim was a very gloomy place and that if he wanted to  live handsomely and safely, he must not only allow Wotan and Loki to  organize society for him, but pay them very handsomely for doing it. He  wanted splendor, military glory, loyalty, enthusiasm, and patriotism;  and his greed and gluttony were wholly unable to create them, whereas  Wotan and Loki carried them all to a triumphant climax in Germany in  1871, when Wagner himself celebrated the event with his Kaisermarsch,  which sounded much more convincing than the Marseillaise or the  Carmagnole.    How, after the Kaisermarsch, could Wagner go back to his idealization of  Siegfried in 1853? How could he believe seriously in Siegfried slaying  the dragon and charging through the mountain fire, when the immediate  foreground was occupied by the Hotel de Ville with Felix Pyat endlessly  discussing the principles of Socialism whilst the shells of Thiers were  already battering the Arc de Triomphe, and ripping up the pavement of  the Champs Elysees? Is it not clear that things had taken an altogether  unexpected turn--that although the Ring may, like the famous Communist  Manifesto of Marx and Engels, be an inspired guest at the historic laws  and predestined end of our capitalistic-theocratic epoch, yet  Wagner, like Marx, was too inexperienced in technical government  and administration and too melodramatic in his hero-contra-villain  conception of the class struggle, to foresee the actual process by which  his generalization would work out, or the part to be played in it by the  classes involved?    Let us go back for a moment to the point at which the Niblung legend  first becomes irreconcilable with Wagner's allegory. Fafnir in the  allegory becomes a capitalist; but Fafnir in the legend is a mere  hoarder. His gold does not bring him in any revenue. It does not even  support him: he "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14874"],[0,"Elsie's Womanhood (#17)"],[1,"colored man, bowing, scraping, and  grinning from ear to ear, in whom she perceived a faint resemblance to the  lad Simon of four years ago.    \"You hain't forgot me, miss?\" he said. \"I'm still at de ole place wid Miss  Wealthy.\"    She gave him a smile and a nod, dropping a gold dollar into his hand along  with her checks; the gentlemen said, \"How d'ye do,\" and were equally  generous, and he went off chuckling.    As they drew near their destination, a quaint little figure could be seen  standing at the gate in the shade of a maple tree, whose leaves of mingled  green and scarlet, just touched by the September frosts, made a brilliant  contrast to the sober hue of her dress.    \"There she is! our dear old auntie!\" cried Elsie with eager delight, that  brought a flush of pleasure to Harry's face.    Miss Stanhope's greetings were characteristic. \"Elsie! my darling! I have  you again after all these years! Mrs. Vanilla too! how kind! but you tell  me your face is always that. Horace, nephew, this _is_ good of you! And  Mr. Torville, I'm as glad as the rest to see you. Come in, come in, all of  you, and make yourselves at home.\"    \"Does Mrs. Schilling still live opposite to you, Aunt Wealthy?\" asked  Elsie as they sat about the tea-table an hour later.    \"Yes, dearie; though she's lost all commercial value,\" laughed the old  lady; \"she's taken a second wife at last; not Mr. Was though, but a  newcomer, Mr. Smearer.\"    \"Dauber, auntie,\" corrected Harry, gravely.    \"Well, well, child, the meaning's about the same,\" returned Miss Stanhope,  laughing afresh at her own mistake, \"and I'd as soon be the other as one.\"    \"Mrs. Dauber wouldn't though,\" said Harry. \"I noticed her face grow as red  as a beet the other day when you called her Mrs. Smearer.\"    \"She didn't mind being Mrs. Sixpence, I think,\" said Elsie.    \"Oh yes, she did; it nettled her a good deal at first, but she finally got  used to it; after finding out how innocent auntie was, and how apt to  miscall other names.\"    \"But I thought she would never be content with anybody but Mr. Wert.\"    \"Well, she lost all hope there, and dropped him at once as soon as Dauber  made his appearance.\"    Mr. Dinsmore inquired about the Kings. Elsie had done so in a private chat  with her aunt, held in her room directly after their arrival.    \"The doctor's as busy as ever, killing people all round the country; he's  very successful at it,\" replied Miss Stanhope; \"I've the utmost confidence  in his skill.\"    \"You are a warm friend of his, I know, aunt,\" said Mr. Dinsmore, smiling,  \"but I would advise you not to try to assist his reputation among  strangers.\"    \"Why not, nephew?\"    \"Lest they should take your words literally, auntie.\"    \"Ah, yes, I must be careful how I use my stumbling tongue,\" she answered  with a good-humored smile. \"I ought to have always by, somebody to correct  my blunders. I've asked Harry to do me that kindness, and he often does.\"    \"It is quite unnecessary with us; for we all know what you intend to say,\"  remarked Mrs. Travilla, courteously.    \"Thank you, dear madam,\" said Miss Stanhope; \"I am not at all sensitive  about it, fortunately, as my nephew knows, and my blunders afford as much  amusement to any one else as to me; when I'm made aware of them.\"    \"Nettie King is married, papa,\" said Elsie.    \"Ah! Lottie also?\"    \"No, she's at home and will be in, with her father and mother, this  evening,\" said Aunt Wealthy. \"I've been matching to make a hope between  her and Harry, but find it's quite useless.\"    \"No, we're the best of friends, but don't care to be anything more,\"  remarked the young gentleman, coloring and laughing.    \"No,\" said Mr. Travilla, \"it is said by some one that two people with hair  and eyes of the same color should beware of choosing each other as  partners for life.\"    \"And I believe it,\" returned Harry. \"Lottie and I are too much alike in  disposition. I must look for a blue-eyed, fair-haired maiden, whose mental  and moral characteristics will supply the deficiencies in mine.\"    \"Gray eyes and brown; that will do very well, won't it?\" said the old lady  absently, glancing from Elsie to Mr. Travilla and back again.    Both smiled, and Elsie cast down her eyes with a lovely blush, while Mr.  Travilla answered cheerily, \"We think so, Miss Stanhope.\"    \"Call me Aunt Wealthy; almost everybody does, and you might as well begin  now as any time.\"    \"Thank you, I shall avail myself of the privilege in future.\"    The weather was warm for the time of year, and on leaving the table the  whole party repaired to the front porch, where Harry quickly provided  every one with a seat.    \"That is a beautiful maple yonder,\" remarked Mr. Travilla.    \"Yes, sir,\" returned Harry; \"we have a row of them all along the front of  the lot; and as Mrs. Dauber says, they are 'perfectly gordeous' in the  fall.\"    \"The maple is my favorite among the shade leaves,\" remarked Miss Stanhope,  joining in the talk, \"from the time it trees out in the spring till the  bare become branches in the fall. Through this month and next they're a  perpetual feast to the eye.\"    \"Aunt, how did you decide in regard to that investment you wrote to  consult me about?\" asked Mr. Dinsmore, turning to her.    \"Oh, I concluded to put in a few hundreds, as you thought it safe, on the  principle of not having all my baskets in one egg.\"    \"Small baskets they would have to be, auntie,\" Harry remarked quietly.    \"Yes, my eggs are not so many, but quite enough for an old lady like me.\"    As the evening shadows crept over the landscape the air began to be  chilly, and our friends adjourned to the parlor.    Here all was just as when Elsie last saw it; neat as wax, everything in  place, and each feather-stuffed cushion beaten up and carefully smoothed  to the state of perfect roundness in which Miss Stanhope's soul delighted.    Mrs. Travilla, who had heard descriptions of the room and its appointments  from both her son and Elsie, looked about her with interest: upon the old  portraits, the cabinet of curiosities, and the wonderful sampler worked by  Miss Wealthy's grandmother. She examined with curiosity the rich  embroidery of the chair cushions, but preferred a seat upon the sofa.    \"Dr. and Mrs. King and Miss Lottie!\" announced Simon's voice from the  doorway, and the three entered.    Lively, cordial greetings followed, especially on the part of the two  young girls. Mrs. Travilla was introduced, and all settled themselves for  a chat; Lottie and Elsie, of course, managing to find seats side by side.    \"You dearest girl, you have only changed by growing more beautiful than  ever,\" cried Lottie, squeezing Elsie's hand which she still held, and  gazing admiringly into her face.    Elsie laughed low and musically.    \"Precisely what I was thinking of you, Lottie. It must be your own fault  that you are still single. But we won't waste time in flattering each  other, when we have so much to say that is better worth while.\"    \"No, surely; Aunt Wealthy has told me of your engagement.\"    \"That was right; it is no secret, and should not be from you if it were  from others. Lottie, I want you to be one of my bridesmaids. We're going  to carry Aunt Wealthy off to spend the winter with us, and I shall not be  content unless I can do the same by you.'    \"A winter in the 'sunny South!' and with you; how delightful! you dear,  kind creature, to think of it, and to ask me. Ah, if I only could!\"    \"I think you can; though of course I know your father and mother must be  consulted; and if you come, you will grant my request?\"    \"Yes, yes indeed! gladly.\"    Aunt Chloe, always making herself useful wherever she went, was passing  around the room with a pile of plates, Phillis following with cakes and  confections, while Simon brought in a waiter with saucers and spoons, and  two large moulds of ice cream.    \"Will you help the cream, Harry?\" said Miss Stanhope. \"There are two  kinds, you see, travilla and melon. Ask Mrs. Vanilla which she'll have; or  if she'll take both.\"    \"Mrs. Travilla, may I have the pleasure of helping you to ice cream?\" he  asked. \"There are two kinds, vanilla and lemon. Let me give you both.\"    \"If you please,\" she answered, with a slightly amused look; for though  Aunt Wealthy had spoken in an undertone, the words had reached her ear.    \"Which will you have, dearies?\" said the old lady, drawing near the young  girls' corner, \"travilla cream or melon?\"    \"Lemon for me, if you please, Aunt Wealthy,\" replied Lottie.    \"And I will take Travilla,\" Elsie said, low and mischievously, and with a  merry twinkle in her eye.    \"But you have no cake! your plate is quite empty and useless,\" exclaimed  the aunt. \"Horace,\" turning towards her nephew, who was chatting with the  doctor at the other side of the room, \"some of this cake is very plain;  you don't object to Elsie eating a little of it?\"    \"She is quite grown up now, aunt, and can judge for herself in such  matters,\" he answered smiling, then turned to finish what he had been  saying to the doctor.    \"You will have some then, dear, won't you?\" Miss Stanhope inquired in her  most coaxing tone.    \"A very small slice of this sponge cake, if you please, auntie.\"    \"How young Mr. Travilla looks,\" remarked Lottie, \"younger I think, than he  did four years ago. Happiness, I presume; it's said to have that effect. I  believe I was vexed when I first heard you were engaged to him, because I  thought he was too old; but really he doesn't look so; a man should be  considerably older than his wife, that she may find it easier to look up  to him; and he know the better how to take care of her.\"    \"I would not have him a day younger, except that he would like to be  nearer my age, or different in any way from what he is,\" Elsie said, her  eyes involuntarily turning in Mr. Travilla's direction.    They met the ardent gaze of his. Both smiled, and rising he crossed the  room and"]]]
