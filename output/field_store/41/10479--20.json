These politics were now  embraced by Charles; a sure proof that a secret revolution had happened  in the constitution, and had necessitated the prince to adopt new maxims  of government.[**]         * May, p 21.         ** Sir Edw. Walker, p. 328.    But the views of the king were at this time so repugnant to those of  the Puritans, that the leaders whom he gained, lost from that moment  all interest with their party, and were even pursued as traitors with  implacable hatred and resentment. This was the case with Sir Thomas  Wentworth, whom the king created, first a baron, then a viscount, and  afterwards earl of Strafford; made him president of the council of  York, and deputy of Ireland; and regarded him as his chief minister and  counsellor. By his eminent talents and abilities, Strafford merited  all the confidence which his master reposed in him: his character  was stately and austere; more fitted to procure esteem than love:  his fidelity to the king was unshaken; but as he now employed all his  counsels to support the prerogative, which he had formerly bent all his  endeavors to diminish his virtue seems not to have been entirely pure,  but to have been susceptible of strong impressions from private interest  and ambition. Sir Dudley Digges was about the same time created master  of the rolls; Noy, attorney-general; Littleton, solicitor-general. All  these had likewise been parliamentary leaders, and were men eminent in  their profession.[*]         * Whitlocke, p. 13. May, p. 20.    [Illustration: 1-647-strafford.jpg EARL OF STRAFFORD]    In all ecclesiastical affairs, and even in many civil, Laud, bishop of  London, had great influence over the king. This man was virtuous, if  severity of manners alone, and abstinence from pleasure, could deserve  that name. He was learned, if polemical knowledge could entitle him  to that praise. He was disinterested; but with unceasing industry he  studied to exalt the priestly and prelatical character, which was his  own. His zeal was unrelenting in the cause of religion; that is, in  imposing by rigorous measures his own tenets and pious ceremonies on  the obstinate Puritans, who had profanely dared to oppose him.  In prosecution of his holy purposes, he overlooked every human  consideration; or, in other words, the heat and indiscretion of his  temper made him neglect the views of prudence and rules of good manners.  He was in this respect happy, that all his enemies were also imagined  by him the declared enemies to loyalty and true piety, and that every  exercise of his anger by that means became in his eyes a merit and  a virtue. This was the man who acquired so great an ascendant over  Charles, and who led him, by the facility of his temper, into a conduct  which proved so fatal to himself and to his kingdoms.    The humor of the nation ran at that time into the extreme opposite to  superstition; and it was with difficulty that the ancient ceremonies  to which men had been accustomed, and which had been sanctified by the  practice of the first reformers, could be retained in divine service:  yet was this the time which Laud chose for the introduction of new  ceremonies and observances. Besides that these were sure to displease  as innovations, there lay, in the opinion of the public, another very  forcible objection against them. Laud, and the other prelates who  embraced his measures, were generally well instructed in sacred  antiquity, and had adopted many of those religious sentiments which  prevailed during the fourth and fifth centuries; when the Christian  church, as is well known, was already sunk into those superstitions  which were afterwards continued and augmented by the policy of Rome. The  revival, therefore, of the ideas and practices of that age, could not  fail of giving the English faith and liturgy some resemblance to the  Catholic superstition, which the kingdom in general, and the Puritans in  particular, held in the greatest horror and detestation. Men also were  apt to think, that, without some secret purpose, such insignificant  observances would not be imposed with such unrelenting zeal on the  refractory nation; and that Laud's scheme was, to lead back the English  by gradual steps to the religion of their ancestors. They considered  not, that the very insignificancy of these ceremonies recommended them  to the superstitious prelate, and made them appear the more peculiarly  sacred and religious, as they could serve to no other purpose. Nor was  the resemblance to the Romish ritual any objection, but rather a merit  with Laud and his brethren; who bore a much greater kindness to  the mother church, as they called her, than to the sectaries and  Presbyterians, and frequently recommended her as a true Christian  church; an appellation which they refused, or at least scrupled to give  to the others.[*] So openly were these tenets espoused, that not only  the discontented Puritans believed the church of England to be relapsing  fast into Romish superstition: the court of Rome itself entertained  hopes of regaining its authority in this island; and, in order to  forward Laud's supposed good intentions, an offer was twice made him in  private of a cardinal's hat, which he declined accepting.[**] His answer  was, as he says himself, \"That something dwelt within him, which would  not suffer his compliance, till Rome were other than it is.\"[***]         * May, p. 25.         ** Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 190. Welwood, p. 61.         *** Rushworth, vol. iii. p. 1327. Whitlocke, p. 97.    A court lady, daughter of the earl of Devonshire, having turned  Catholic, was asked by Laud the reason of her conversion: \"'Tis  chiefly,\" said she, \"because I hate to travel in a crowd.\" The meaning  of this expression being demanded, she replied, \"I perceive your grace  and many others are making haste to Rome; and therefore, in order to  prevent my being crowded, I have gone before you.\" It must be confessed,  that though Laud deserved not the appellation of Papist, the genius of  his religion was, though in a less degree, the same with that of  the Romish: the same profound respect was exacted to the sacerdotal  character, the same submission required to the creeds and decrees of  synods and councils; the same pomp and ceremony was affected in  worship; and the same superstitious regard to days, postures, meats, and  vestments. No wonder, therefore, that this prelate was every where among  the Puritans regarded with horror, as the forerunner of Antichrist.    As a specimen of the new ceremonies to which Laud sacrificed his own  quiet and that of the nation, it may not be amiss to relate those which  he was accused of employing in the consecration of St. Catharine's  church, and which were the object of such general scandal and offence.    On the bishop's approach to the west door of the church, a loud voice  cried, \"Open, open, ye everlasting doors, that the king of glory may  enter in!\" Immediately the doors of the church flew open, and the bishop  entered. Falling upon his knees, with eyes elevated and arms expanded,  he uttered these words: \"This place is holy; the ground is holy: in the  name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I pronounce it holy.\"    Going towards the chancel, he several times took up from the floor  some of the dust, and threw it in the air. When he approached, with his  attendants, near to the communion table, he bowed frequently towards  it; and on their return, they went round the church, repeating, as they  marched along, some of the psalms; and then said a form of prayer, which  concluded with these words: \"We consecrate this church, and separate it  unto thee as holy ground, not to be profaned any more to common uses.\"    After this, the bishop, standing near the communion table solemnly  pronounced many imprecations upon such as should afterwards pollute that  holy place by musters of soldiers, or keeping in it profane law-courts,  or carrying burdens through it. On the conclusion of every curse, he  bowed towards the east, and cried, \"Let all the people say, Amen.\"    The imprecations being all so piously finished, there were poured out  a number of blessings upon such as had any hand in framing and building  that sacred and beautiful edifice, and on such as had given, or should  hereafter give to it, any chalices, plate, ornaments, or utensils. At  every benediction he in like manner bowed towards the east, and cried,  \"Let all the people say, Amen.\"    The sermon followed; after which the bishop consecrated and administered  the sacrament in the following manner.    As he approached the communion table, he made many lowly reverences;  and coming up to that part of the table where the bread and wine lay, he  bowed seven times. After the reading of many prayers, he approached the  sacramental elements, and gently lifted up the corner of the napkin in  which the bread was placed. When he beheld the bread, he suddenly let  fall the napkin, flew back a step or two, bowed three several times  towards the bread; then he drew nigh again, opened the napkin, and bowed  as before.    Next he laid his hand on the cup, which had a cover upon it, and was  filled with wine. He let go the cup, fell back, and bowed thrice towards  it. He approached again; and lifting op the cover, peeped into the  cup. Seeing the wine, he let fall the cover, started back, and bowed as  before. Then he received the sacrament, and gave it to others. And many  prayers being said, the solemnity of the consecration ended. The walls,  and floor, and roof of the fabric were then supposed to be sufficiently  holy.[*]    Orders were given, and rigorously insisted on, that the communion table  should be removed from the middle of the area where it hitherto stood in  all churches, except in cathedrals.[**] "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19216"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part F. (#17)"],[1,"De Wit with an aversion to a strict union with England, he  generously resolved to sacrifice all private considerations to the  public service.    Temple insisted on an offensive league between England and Holland, in  order to oblige France to relinquish all her conquests: but De Wit told  him, that this measure was too bold and precipitate to be agreed to by  the states. He said that the French were the old and constant allies of  the republic; and till matters came to extremities, she never would  deem it prudent to abandon a friendship so well established, and rely  entirely on a treaty with England, which had lately waged so cruel a war  against her: that ever since the reign of Elizabeth, there had been such  a fluctuation in the English councils, that it was not possible, for two  years together, to take any sure or certain measures with that  kingdom: that though the present ministry, having entered into views  so conformable to national interest, promised greater firmness and  constancy, it might still be unsafe, in a business of such consequence,  to put entire confidence in them: that the French monarch was young,  haughty, and powerful; and if treated in so imperious a manner, would  expose himself to the greatest extremities rather than submit: that it  was sufficient, if he could be constrained to adhere to the offers which  he himself had already made, and if the remaining provinces of the Low  Countries could be thereby saved from the danger with which they were at  present threatened: and that the other powers in Germany and the north,  whose assistance they might expect, would be satisfied with putting a  stop to the French conquests, without pretending to recover the places  already lost.    The English minister was content to accept of the terms proposed by the  pensionary. Lewis had offered to relinquish all the queen's rights,  on condition either of keeping the conquests which he had made last  campaign, or of receiving, in lieu of them, Franche Compte, together  with Cambray, Aire, and St. Omers. De Wit and Temple founded their  treaty upon this proposal. They agreed to offer their mediation to the  contending powers, and oblige France to adhere to this alternative, and  Spain to accept of it. If Spain refused, they agreed that France should  not prosecute her claim by arms, but leave it entirely to England  and Holland to employ force for making the terms effectual. And the  remainder of the Low Countries they thenceforth guarantied to Spain. A  defensive alliance was likewise concluded between Holland and England.    The articles of this confederacy were soon adjusted by such candid and  able negotiators: but the greatest difficulty still remained. By the  constitution of the republic, all the towns in all the provinces must  give their consent to every alliance; and besides that this formality  could not be despatched in less than two months, it was justly to be  dreaded that the influence of France would obstruct the passing of the  treaty in some of the smaller cities. D'Estrades, the French ambassador,  a man of abilities, hearing of the league which was on the carpet,  treated it lightly. \"Six weeks hence,\" said he, \"we shall speak to it.\"  To obviate this difficulty, De Wit had the courage, for the public  good, to break through the laws in so fundamental an article; and by  his authority, he prevailed with the states general at once to sign and  ratify the league: though they acknowledged that, if that measure  should displease their constituents, they risked their heads by this  irregularity. After sealing, all parties embraced with great cordiality.  Temple cried out, \"At Breda, as friends: here, as brothers.\" And De Wit  added, that now the matter was finished, it looked like a miracle.    Room had been left in the treaty for the accession of Sweden, which  was soon after obtained; and thus was concluded in five days the triple  league; an event received with equal surprise and approbation by the  world. Notwithstanding the unfortunate conclusion of the last war,  England now appeared in her proper station, and, by this wise conduct,  had recovered all her influence and credit in Europe. Temple likewise  received great applause; but to all the compliments made him on the  occasion, he modestly replied, that to remove things from their centre,  or proper element, required force and labor; but that of themselves they  easily returned to it.    The French monarch was extremely displeased with this measure. Not only  bounds were at present set to his ambition; such a barrier was also  raised as seemed forever impregnable. And though his own offer was made  the foundation of the treaty, he had prescribed so short a time for the  acceptance of it that he still expected, from the delays and reluctance  of Spain, to find some opportunity of eluding it. The court of Madrid  showed equal displeasure. To relinquish any part of the Spanish  provinces, in lieu of claims so apparently unjust, and these urged with  such violence and haughtiness, inspired the highest disgust. Often did  the Spaniards threaten to abandon entirely the Low Countries, rather  than submit to so cruel a mortification; and they endeavored, by this  menace, to terrify the mediating powers into more vigorous measures for  their support. But Temple and De Wit were better acquainted with the  views and interests of Spain. They knew that she must still retain the  Low Countries, as a bond of connection with the other European powers,  who alone, if her young monarch should happen to die without issue,  could insure her independency against the pretensions of France. They  still urged, therefore, the terms of the triple league, and threatened  Spain with war in case of refusal. The plenipotentiaries of all the  powers met at Aix-la-Chapelle. Temple was minister for England; Van  Beuninghen for Holland; D'Ohna for Sweden.    Spain at last, pressed on all hands, accepted of the alternative  offered; but in her very compliance, she gave strong symptoms of ill  humor and discontent. It had been apparent that the Hollanders, entirely  neglecting the honor of the Spanish monarchy, had been anxious only for  their own security; and, provided they could remove Lewis to a distance  from their frontier, were more indifferent what progress he made  in other places. Sensible of these views, the queen regent of Spain  resolved still to keep them in an anxiety, which might for the future  be the foundation of a union more intimate than they were willing at  present to enter into Franche Compte, by a vigorous and well-concerted  plan of the French king, had been conquered in fifteen days, during  a rigorous season, and in the midst of winter. She chose therefore  to recover this province, and to abandon all the towns conquered in  Flanders during the last campaign. By this means Lewis extended his  garrisons into the heart of the Low Countries; and a very feeble barrier  remained to the Spanish provinces.    But notwithstanding the advantages of his situation, the French monarch  could entertain small hopes of ever extending his conquests on that  quarter, which lay the most exposed to his ambition, and where his  acquisitions were of most importance. The triple league guarantied the  remaining provinces to Spain; and the emperor and other powers of  Germany, whose interest seemed to be intimately concerned, were invited  to enter into the same confederacy. Spain herself, having about this  time, under the mediation of Charles, made peace on equal terms with  Portugal, might be expected to exert more vigor and opposition to  her haughty and triumphant rival. The great satisfaction expressed in  England on account of the counsels now embraced by the court, promised  the hearty concurrence of parliament in every measure which could be  proposed for opposition to the grandeur of France. And thus all Europe  seemed to repose herself with security under the wings of that powerful  confederacy which had been so happily formed for her protection. It is  now time to give some account of the state of affairs in Scotland and in  Ireland.    The Scottish nation, though they had never been subject to the arbitrary  power of their prince, had but very imperfect notions of law and  liberty; and scarcely in any age had they ever enjoyed an administration  which had confined itself within the proper boundaries. By their final  union alone with England, their once hated adversary, they have happily  attained the experience of a government perfectly regular, and exempt  from all violence and injustice. Charles, from his aversion to business,  had intrusted the affairs of that country to his ministers, particularly  Middleton; and these could not forbear making very extraordinary  stretches of authority.    There had been intercepted a letter, written by Lord Lorne to Lord  Duffus, in which, a little too plainly, but very truly, he complained,  that his enemies had endeavored by falsehood to prepossess the king  against him. But he said, that he had now discovered them, had defeated  them, and had gained the person, meaning the earl of Clarendon, upon  whom the chief of them depended. This letter was produced before the  parliament; and Lorne was tried upon an old, tyrannical, absurd law  against leasing-making; by which it was rendered criminal to belie the  subjects to the king, or create in him an ill opinion of them. He was  condemned to die: but Charles was much displeased with the sentence, and  granted him a pardon.[*]         * Burnet, p. 149.    It was carried in parliament, that twelve persons, without crime,  witness, trial, or accuser, should be declared incapable of all trust or  office; and to render this injustice more egregious, it was agreed,  that these persons should be named by ballot; a method of voting which  several republics had adopted at elections, in order to prevent faction  and intrigue; but which could serve only as a"]]]
