[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18854"],[0,"The Gourmet's Guide to Europe (#17)"],[1,"_, and  to give them some hours' notice. The manager is M. Anjema. It is  advisable to secure a table near the window, especially in summer. Some  of the best wines are not put on the wine-list.    In former years the proprietor of Van der Pyl's was possessed of a  puritanical conscience, and would not allow any two people to dine alone  in his private salons. So strictly did he adhere to his rule on this  subject, that when a well-known man-about-town insisted on his right to  dine in the _petit salon_ alone with his wife, the inexorable proprietor  turned him out of the restaurant. There was, however, another well-known  member of Hague society who succeeded where the gentleman who thought  that matrimony overrode all rules had failed. The hero of the little  story had made a bet that, in spite of the puritanical proprietor, he  would dine _a deux_ with a lady in the _petit salon_. He won his bet by  subtlety. He ordered a dinner for three, and when he and the lady  arrived they waited a quarter of an hour for the other imaginary guest.  Then, remarking that he was sure Mr. X. would not mind the dinner being  begun without him, the host ordered the soup to be brought up; and so,  with constant allusions to the man that never came, the dinner was  served, course by course, and the bet won before the proprietor had the  least idea that a trick had been played upon him.    A somewhat similar story, it will be remembered, is told of Delmonico's  and its proprietor in the early history of that great New York  restaurant. In the American story, the youth who had dined in a _cabinet  particulier_ with a lady, in contravention of the rules of the house,  had not the sense to hold his tongue until after he had paid his bill.  When that document did make its appearance, some of the items were  astonishing. \"You don't expect me to pay this bill?\" said the astonished  diner to the proprietor, who had made his appearance. \"No, I do not,\"  said Mr. Delmonico, \"but until you do you will not come into my  restaurant again.\"    The following are some of the dishes Van der Pyl's makes a speciality  of:--_Poule au pot Henri IV._, _Sole Normande_, _Cote de Boeuf a la  Russe_, _Homards a l'Americaine_, _Poularde a la Parisienne_, _Perdreaux  au choux_, _Omelette Siberienne_, _Souffle Palmyre_, _Poires Alaska_,  most of them standard dishes of the usual _cuisine Francaise_, though  the _Omelette Siberienne_ was invented to please a British diplomat who  preferred a _soupcon_ of absinthe to either rum or Kuemmel with his  omelette. And this is a typical menu drawn up by M. Anjema, a menu which  reads as though it were for a French banquet:--                  Huitres de Zelande.                     Caviar.               Consomme Diplomate.           Truite Saumonee a la Nantua.             Poularde a l'Imperiale.      Noisettes de Chevreuil a la St-Hubert.        Delice de foie gras au Champagne.       Becassines roties. Salade St-Clair.         Tartelettes aux Haricots Verts.                Mousse Antoinette.              Sandwiches au Parmesan.                     Dessert.    The Cafe Royal, in the Vijberberg, with an American luncheon bar on the  ground floor and a restaurant upstairs, is fairly good.    Of the hotels to which restaurants are attached, the Hotel des Indes and  Hotel Vieux Doelen have a reputation for good cookery. The former was in  olden times the town house of the Barons van Brienen, and in winter many  people of Dutch society, coming to the capital from the country for the  season, take apartments there, and during that period of the year the  restaurant is often filled by very brilliant gatherings. The manager,  Mr. Haller, has been made a director of Claridge's Hotel in London, and  divides his attention between the two hotels.    The following menu is a typical one of a dinner of ceremony at the Hotel  des Indes; it was composed for a banquet given by Count Henri Stuergkh:--                      Huitres.              Consomme Bagration.          Filets de Soles Joinville.          Carre de Mouton Nesselrode.      Parfait de foie gras de Strasbourg.      Fonds d'Artichauts a la Barigoule.          Grouse rotis sur Croutons.             Compote de Montreuil.              Coeurs de Laitues.         Creme au Chocolat et Vanille.            Paillettes au Fromage.    The Vieux Doelen has a beautiful old dining-room, and it is here that  every year the smartest balls in the capital take place, given by the  Societe du Casino, and generally attended by Their Majesties and the  Court.    Hock's fish shop in the market has a room where excellent oyster suppers  are served, but this is not a place to which ladies should be taken at  night, for it is then patronised by damsels who take the courtesy title  of actresses, and the students from Leiden.      Amsterdam    The Restaurant Riche is managed by a Frenchman, and the cuisine is  French. It is necessary to order dinner in advance, and it is well to be  particular. Under these circumstances an excellent dinner is obtainable.  There is a cellar of good wine, the Burgundies being especially to be  recommended.    The Restaurant van Laar, in the Kalverstraat, has a celebrity for its  fish dinners, and excellent oyster suppers are to be had there.      Scheveningen    Curiously enough, this important seaside resort has no restaurant with  any claim to celebrity. The dinners to be obtained in the hotels have to  suffice for the wants of the visitors to the place.      Rotterdam    The Stroomberg here deserves a word of commendation, the food to be  obtained there being excellent.      The Food of the People    The cuisine of the country, the food the people of the country eat, is  not recommended to the experimenting gourmet; for the favourite dish is  a sort of Kedjeree, in which dried stock-fish, rice, potatoes, butter,  and anchovies all play their part. Sauerkraut and sausages, soused  herrings and milk puddings also have claims to be considered the  national dishes.          CHAPTER VI    GERMAN TOWNS         The cookery of the country--Rathskeller and beer-cellars--       Dresden--Muenich--Nueremburg--Hanover--Leipsic--Frankfurt--       Duesseldorf--The Rhine valley--\"Cure\" places--Kiel--Hamburg.      A German housewife who is a good cook can do marvels with a goose,  having half-a-dozen stuffings for it, and she knows many other ways of  treating a hare than roasting it or \"jugging\" it. She also is cunning in  the making of the bitter-sweet salads and _purees_ which are eaten with  the more tasteless kinds of meat; but, unfortunately, the good German  housewife does not as a rule control the hotel or restaurant that the  travelling gourmet is likely to visit, but rules in her own comfortable  home. The German Delikatessen, which form the \"snacks\" a Teuton eats at  any time to encourage his thirst, are excellent; and the smoked sprats,  and smoked and soused herrings, the various sausages and innumerable  pickles, are the best edible products of the Fatherland. The German meat  is as a rule poor. The best beef and mutton in the north has generally  been imported from Holland. The German is a great eater of fresh-water  fish,--pike, carp, perch, salmon, and trout all being found on his  menus, the trout being cooked _au bleu_. Zander, a fish which is partly  of the pike, partly of the trout species, is considered a great dainty.  The vegetables are generally spoiled in the cooking, being converted  into a _puree_ which might well earn the adjective \"eternal.\" Even the  asparagus is spoilt by the native cook, being cut into inch cubes and  set afloat in melted butter. _Compotes_ sweet and sour, are served at  strange times during the repast, and lastly, as a sort of \"old guard,\"  the much-beloved but deadly Sauerkraut, made from both red and white  cabbage, is always brought up to complete the cook's victory. The  potatoes in Germany are generally excellent, the sandy soil being  suitable for their cultivation.    The cookery in the big hotels on much-frequented routes in Germany is  now almost universally a rather heavy version of the French art, with  perhaps a _compote_ with the veal to give local colour. In the small  hotels in little provincial towns the meals are served at the times that  the middle-class German of the north usually eats them, and are an  inferior copy of what he gets in his own home. As a warning I give what  any enterprising traveller looking for the food of the country from the  kitchen of a little inn may expect:--    Coffee at 8 A.M. with rolls, _Kaffee Broedchen_, and butter, and this  meal he will be expected to descend to the dining-room to eat.    A slight lunch at 11 A.M., at which the German equivalent for a  sandwich, a Broedchen cut and buttered, with a slice of uncooked ham,  lachs, or cheese between the halves, makes its appearance, and a glass  of beer or wine is drunk.    Dinner (Mittagessen) is announced between 1 and 2 o'clock, and is a long  meal consisting of soup, which is the water in which the beef has been  boiled; fish; a messy entree, probably of Frankfurt sausage; the beef  boiled to rags with a _compote_ of plums or wortleberries and mashed  apples; and, as the sweet, pancakes.    Coffee is served at 4 P.M. with _Kaffee Kuechen_, its attendant cake, and  at supper (Abendessen) one hot dish, generally veal, is given with a  choice of cold viands or sausages in thin slices--_leber Wuerst,  Goettinger Wuerst_, hot _Frankfurter Wuerst_, and black pudding.    If the above gruesome list does not warn the over-zealous inquirer, his  indigestion be on his own head.    In the south the cookery, though still indifferent, approximates more  nearly to the French bourgeois cookery.    A dinner-party at a private house of well-to-do German people is always  a very long feast, lasting at least two hours, and the cookery, though  good, is heavy and rich, and too many sauces accompany the meats. Many  of the dishes are not served"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18857"],[0,"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (#17)"],[1,"packet which preceded us in our  descent?\"    I smilingly pointed it out to my uncle. Hans had not seen it, and  believed it caught somewhere above us: \"Huppe\" as he phrased it.    \"Now,\" said my uncle, \"let us breakfast, and break fast like people who  have a long day's work before them.\"    Biscuit and dried meat, washed down by some mouthfuls of water flavored  with Schiedam, was the material of our luxurious meal.    As soon as it was finished, my uncle took from his pocket a notebook  destined to be filled by memoranda of our travels. He had already placed  his instruments in order, and this is what he wrote:           Monday, June 29th         Chronometer, 8h. 17m. morning.         Barometer, 29.6 inches.         Thermometer, 6 degrees [43 degrees Fahr.]         Direction, E.S.E.        This last observation referred to the obscure gallery, and was indicated  to us by the compass.    \"Now, Harry,\" cried the Professor, in an enthusiastic tone of voice, \"we  are truly about to take our first step into the Interior of the Earth;  never before visited by man since the first creation of the world. You  may consider, therefore, that at this precise moment our travels really  commence.\"    As my uncle made this remark, he took in one hand the Ruhmkorff coil  apparatus, which hung round his neck, and with the other he put the  electric current into communication with the worm of the lantern. And a  bright light at once illumined that dark and gloomy tunnel!    The effect was magical!    Hans, who carried the second apparatus, had it also put into operation.  This ingenious application of electricity to practical purposes enabled  us to move along by the light of an artificial day, amid even the flow  of the most inflammable and combustible gases.    \"Forward!\" cried my uncle. Each took up his burden. Hans went first, my  uncle followed, and I going third, we entered the somber gallery!    Just as we were about to engulf ourselves in this dismal passage, I  lifted up my head, and through the tubelike shaft saw that Iceland sky I  was never to see again!    Was it the last I should ever see of any sky?    The stream of lava flowing from the bowels of the earth in 1219 had  forced itself a passage through the tunnel. It lined the whole of the  inside with its thick and brilliant coating. The electric light added  very greatly to the brilliancy of the effect.    The great difficulty of our journey now began. How were we to prevent  ourselves from slipping down the steeply inclined plane? Happily some  cracks, abrasures of the soil, and other irregularities, served the  place of steps; and we descended slowly; allowing our heavy luggage to  slip on before, at the end of a long cord.    But that which served as steps under our feet became in other places  stalactites. The lava, very porous in certain places, took the form of  little round blisters. Crystals of opaque quartz, adorned with limpid  drops of natural glass suspended to the roof like lusters, seemed to  take fire as we passed beneath them. One would have fancied that the  genii of romance were illuminating their underground palaces to receive  the sons of men.    \"Magnificent, glorious!\" I cried in a moment of involuntary enthusiasm,  \"What a spectacle, Uncle! Do you not admire these variegated shades of  lava, which run through a whole series of colors, from reddish brown to  pale yellow--by the most insensible degrees? And these crystals, they  appear like luminous globes.\"    \"You are beginning to see the charms of travel, Master Harry,\" cried my  uncle. \"Wait a bit, until we advance farther. What we have as yet  discovered is nothing--onwards, my boy, onwards!\"    It would have been a far more correct and appropriate expression, had he  said, \"let us slide,\" for we were going down an inclined plane with  perfect ease. The compass indicated that we were moving in a  southeasterly direction. The flow of lava had never turned to the right  or the left. It had the inflexibility of a straight line.    Nevertheless, to my surprise, we found no perceptible increase in heat.  This proved the theories of Humphry Davy to be founded on truth, and  more than once I found myself examining the thermometer in silent  astonishment.    Two hours after our departure it only marked fifty-four degrees  Fahrenheit. I had every reason to believe from this that our descent was  far more horizontal than vertical. As for discovering the exact depth to  which we had attained, nothing could be easier. The Professor as he  advanced measured the angles of deviation and inclination; but he kept  the result of his observations to himself.    About eight o'clock in the evening, my uncle gave the signal for  halting. Hans seated himself on the ground. The lamps were hung to  fissures in the lava rock. We were now in a large cavern where air was  not wanting. On the contrary, it abounded. What could be the cause of  this--to what atmospheric agitation could be ascribed this draught? But  this was a question which I did not care to discuss just then. Fatigue  and hunger made me incapable of reasoning. An unceasing march of seven  hours had not been kept up without great exhaustion. I was really and  truly worn out; and delighted enough I was to hear the word Halt.    Hans laid out some provisions on a lump of lava, and we each supped with  keen relish. One thing, however, caused us great uneasiness--our water  reserve was already half exhausted. My uncle had full confidence in  finding subterranean resources, but hitherto we had completely failed in  so doing. I could not help calling my uncle's attention to the  circumstance.    \"And you are surprised at this total absence of springs?\" he said.    \"Doubtless--I am very uneasy on the point. We have certainly not enough  water to last us five days.\"    \"Be quite easy on that matter,\" continued my uncle. \"I answer for it we  shall find plenty of water--in fact, far more than we shall want.\"    \"But when?\"    \"When we once get through this crust of lava. How can you expect springs  to force their way through these solid stone walls?\"    \"But what is there to prove that this concrete mass of lava does not  extend to the centre of the earth? I don't think we have as yet done  much in a vertical way.\"    \"What puts that into your head, my boy?\" asked my uncle mildly.    \"Well, it appears to me that if we had descended very far below the  level of the sea--we should find it rather hotter than we have.\"    \"According to your system,\" said my uncle; \"but what does the  thermometer say?\"    \"Scarcely fifteen degrees by Reaumur, which is only an increase of nine  since our departure.\"    \"Well, and what conclusion does that bring you to?\" inquired the  Professor.    \"The deduction I draw from this is very simple. According to the most  exact observations, the augmentation of the temperature of the interior  of the earth is one degree for every hundred feet. But certain local  causes may considerably modify this figure. Thus at Yakoust in Siberia,  it has been remarked that the heat increases a degree every thirty-six  feet. The difference evidently depends on the conductibility of certain  rocks. In the neighborhood of an extinct volcano, it has been remarked  that the elevation of temperature was only one degree in every  five-and-twenty feet. Let us, then, go upon this calculation--which is  the most favorable--and calculate.\"    \"Calculate away, my boy.\"    \"Nothing easier,\" said I, pulling out my notebook and pencil. \"Nine  times one hundred and twenty-five feet make a depth of eleven hundred  and twenty-five feet.\"    \"Archimedes could not have spoken more geometrically.\"    \"Well?\"    \"Well, according to my observations, we are at least ten thousand feet  below the level of the sea.\"    \"Can it be possible?\"    \"Either my calculation is correct, or there is no truth in figures.\"    The calculations of the Professor were perfectly correct. We were  already six thousand feet deeper down in the bowels of the earth than  anyone had ever been before. The lowest known depth to which man had  hitherto penetrated was in the mines of Kitzbuhel, in the Tirol, and  those of Wurttemberg.    The temperature, which should have been eighty-one, was in this place  only fifteen. This was a matter for serious consideration.          CHAPTER 16    THE EASTERN TUNNEL      The next day was Tuesday, the 30th of June--and at six o'clock in the  morning we resumed our journey.    We still continued to follow the gallery of lava, a perfect natural  pathway, as easy of descent as some of those inclined planes which, in  very old German houses, serve the purpose of staircases. This went on  until seventeen minutes past twelve, the precise instant at which we  rejoined Hans, who, having been somewhat in advance, had suddenly  stopped.    \"At last,\" cried my uncle, \"we have reached the end of the shaft.\"    I looked wonderingly about me. We were in the centre of four cross  paths--somber and narrow tunnels. The question now arose as to which it  was wise to take; and this of itself was no small difficulty.    My uncle, who did not wish to appear to have any hesitation about the  matter before myself or the guide, at once made up his mind. He pointed  quietly to the eastern tunnel; and, without delay, we entered within its  gloomy recesses.    Besides, had he entertained any feeling of hesitation it might have been  prolonged indefinitely, for there was no indication by which to  determine on a choice. It was absolutely necessary to trust to chance  and good fortune!    The descent of this obscure and narrow gallery was very gradual and  winding. Sometimes we gazed through a succession of arches, its course  very like the aisles of a Gothic cathedral. The great artistic sculptors  and builders of the Middle Ages might have here completed their studies  with advantage. Many most beautiful and suggestive ideas of  architectural beauty would have been discovered by them. "]]]
