General  Lei Yu-chung caused to be shot into the besieged town arrows to which  notices were attached inviting the inhabitants to surrender. Suddenly  a man mounted a ladder, and pointing to the rebels cried in a loud  voice: \"The Spirit of Tzu T'ung has sent me to inform you that the  town will fall into the hands of the enemy on the twentieth day of  the ninth moon, and not a single person will escape death.\" Attempts  to strike down this prophet of evil were in vain, for he had already  disappeared. The town was captured on the day indicated. The general,  as a reward, caused the temple of Tzu T'ung's Spirit to be repaired,  and sacrifices offered to it.    The object of worship nowadays in the temples dedicated to Wen Ch'ang  is Tzu T'ung Ti Chuen, the God of Tzu T'ung. The convenient elasticity  of dualism enabled Chang to have as many as seventeen reincarnations,  which ranged over a period of some three thousand years.    Various emperors at various times bestowed upon Wen Ch'ang honorific  titles, until ultimately, in the Yuean, or Mongol, dynasty, in the reign  Yen Yu, in A.D. 1314, the title was conferred on him of Supporter of  the Yuean Dynasty, Diffuser of Renovating Influences, Ssu-lu of Wen  Ch'ang, God and Lord. He was thus apotheosized, and took his place  among the gods of China. By steps few or many a man in China has  often become a god.      Wen Ch'ang and the Great Bear    Thus we have the God of Literature, Wen Ch'ang Ti Chuen, duly installed  in the Chinese pantheon, and sacrifices were offered to him in the  schools.    But scholars, especially those about to enter for the public  competitive examinations, worshipped as the God of Literature, or as  his palace or abode (Wen Ch'ang), the star K'uei in the Great Bear,  or Dipper, or Bushel--the latter name derived from its resemblance in  shape to the measure used by the Chinese and called _tou_. The term  K'uei was more generally applied to the four stars forming the body  or square part of the Dipper, the three forming the tail or handle  being called Shao or Piao. How all this came about is another story.    A scholar, as famous for his literary skill as his facial deformities,  had been admitted as first academician at the metropolitan  examinations. It was the custom that the Emperor should give with  his own hand a rose of gold to the fortunate candidate. This scholar,  whose name was Chung K'uei, presented himself according to custom to  receive the reward which by right was due to him. At the sight of  his repulsive face the Emperor refused the golden rose. In despair  the miserable rejected one went and threw himself into the sea. At  the moment when he was being choked by the waters a mysterious fish  or monster called _ao_ raised him on its back and brought him to the  surface. K'uei ascended to Heaven and became arbiter of the destinies  of men of letters. His abode was said to be the star K'uei, a name  given by the Chinese to the sixteen stars of the constellation or  'mansion' of Andromeda and Pisces. The scholars quite soon began  to worship K'uei as the God of Literature, and to represent it on a  column in the temples. Then sacrifices were offered to it. This star  or constellation was regarded as the palace of the god. The legend  gave rise to an expression frequently used in Chinese of one who  comes out first in an examination, namely, _tu chan ao t'ou_, \"to  stand alone on the sea-monster's head.\" It is especially to be noted  that though the two K'ueis have the same sound they are represented  by different characters, and that the two constellations are not the  same, but are situated in widely different parts of the heavens.    How then did it come about that scholars worshipped the K'uei in  the Great Bear as the abode of the God of Literature? (It may be  remarked in passing that a literary people could not have chosen  a more appropriate palace for this god, since the Great Bear,  the 'Chariot of Heaven,' is regarded as the centre and governor  of the whole universe.) The worship, we saw, was at first that of  the star K'uei, the apotheosized 'homely,' successful, but rejected  candidate. As time went on, there was a general demand for a sensible,  concrete representation of this star-god: a simple character did not  satisfy the popular taste. But it was no easy matter to comply with the  demand. Eventually, guided doubtless by the community of pronunciation,  they substituted for the star or group of stars K'uei (1),  venerated in ancient times, a new star or group of stars K'uei (2),  forming the square part of the Bushel, Dipper, or Great Bear. But for  this again no bodily image could be found, so the form of the written  character itself was taken, and so drawn as to represent a _kuei_  (3) (disembodied spirit, or ghost) with its foot raised, and bearing  aloft a _tou_ (4) (bushel-measure). The adoration was thus misplaced,  for the constellation K'uei (2) was mistaken for K'uei (1), the proper  object of worship. It was due to this confusion by the scholars that  the Northern Bushel came to be worshipped as the God of Literature.      Wen Ch'ang and Tzu T'ung    This worship had nothing whatever to do with the Spirit of Tzu T'ung,  but the Taoists have connected Chang Ya with the constellation in  another way by saying that Shang Ti, the Supreme Ruler, entrusted Chang  Ya's son with the management of the palace of Wen Ch'ang. And scholars  gradually acquired the habit of saying that they owed their success  to the Spirit of Tzu T'ung, which they falsely represented as being an  incarnation of the star Wen Ch'ang. This is how Chang Ya came to have  the honorific title of Wen Ch'ang, but, as a Chinese author points  out, Chang belonged properly to Ssuch'uan, and his worship should  be confined to that province. The _literati_ there venerated him as  their master, and as a mark of affection and gratitude built a temple  to him; but in doing so they had no intention of making him the God of  Literature. \"There being no real connexion between Chang Ya and K'uei,  the worship should be stopped.\" The device of combining the personality  of the patron of literature enthroned among the stars with that of the  deified mortal canonized as the Spirit of Tzu T'ung was essentially a  Taoist trick. \"The thaumaturgic reputation assigned to the Spirit of  Chang Ya Tzu was confined for centuries to the valleys of Ssuch'uan,  until at some period antecedent to the reign Yen Yu, in A.D. 1314,  a combination was arranged between the functions of the local god  and those of the stellar patron of literature. Imperial sanction  was obtained for this stroke of priestly cunning; and notwithstanding  protests continually repeated by orthodox sticklers for accuracy in the  religious canon, the composite deity has maintained his claims intact,  and an inseparable connexion between the God of Literature created by  imperial patent and the spirit lodged among the stars of Ursa Major is  fully recognized in the State ceremonial of the present day.\" A temple  dedicated to this divinity by the State exists in every city of China,  besides others erected as private benefactions or speculations.    Wherever Wen Ch'ang is worshipped there will also be found a separate  representation of K'uei Hsing, showing that while the official deity  has been allowed to 'borrow glory' from the popular god, and even  to assume his personality, the independent existence of the stellar  spirit is nevertheless sedulously maintained. The place of the latter  in the heavens above is invariably symbolized by the lodgment of his  idol in an upper storey or tower, known as the K'uei Hsing Ko or K'uei  Hsing Lou. Here students worship the patron of their profession with  incense and prayers. Thus the ancient stellar divinity still largely  monopolizes the popular idea of a guardian of literature and study,  notwithstanding that the deified recluse of Tzu T'ung has been added in  this capacity to the State pantheon for more than five hundred years.      Heaven-deaf and Earth-dumb    The popular representations of Wen Ch'ang depict the god himself and  four other figures. The central and largest is the demure portrait of  the god, clothed in blue and holding a sceptre in his left hand. Behind  him stand two youthful attendants. They are the servant and groom  who always accompany him on his journeys (on which he rides a white  horse). Their names are respectively Hsuean T'ung-tzu and Ti-mu, 'Sombre  Youth' and 'Earth-mother'; more commonly they are called T'ien-lung,  'Deaf Celestial,' and Ti-ya, 'Mute Terrestrial,' or 'Deaf as Heaven'  and 'Mute as Earth.' Thus they cannot divulge the secrets of their  master's administration as he distributes intellectual gifts, literary  skill, etc. Their cosmogonical connexion has already been referred  to in a previous chapter.      Image of K'uei Hsing    In front of Wen Ch'ang, on his left, stands K'uei Hsing. He is  represented as of diminutive stature, with the visage of a demon,  holding a writing-brush in his right hand and a _tou_ in his left,  one of his legs kicking up behind--the figure being obviously intended  as an impersonation of the character _k'uei_ (2). [16] He is regarded  as the distributor of literary degrees, and was invoked above all  in order to obtain success at the competitive examinations. His  images and temples are found in all towns. In the temples dedicated  to Wen Ch'ang there are always two secondary altars, one of which is  consecrated to his worship.      Mr Redcoat    The other is dedicated to Chu I, 'Mr Redcoat.' He and K'uei Hsing  are represented as the two inseparable companions of the God of  Literature. The legend related of Chu I is as follows:    During the T'ang dynasty, in the reign-period Chien Chung (A.D. 780-4)  of the Emperor Te Tsung, the Princess T'ai Yin noticed that Lu Ch'i,  a native of Hua Chou, had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15255"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 1 (#17)"],[1,"India as wholly unorthodox. Yet orthodoxy admits  that the existence of the world is due to the coexistence of Maya  (illusion) with Brahman (spirit) and also states that the task of the  soul is to pass beyond Maya to Brahman. If this is so, there is either a  real duality (Brahman and Maya) or else Maya is an aspect of Brahman,  but an aspect which the soul should transcend and avoid, and for whose  existence no reason whatever is given. The more theistic forms of Indian  religion, whether Sivaite or Vishnuite, tend to regard individual souls  and matter as eternal. By the help of God souls can obtain release from  matter. But here again there is no explanation why the soul is  contaminated by matter or ignorance.    It is clearly illogical to condemn the Infinite as bad or a mistake.  Buddhism is perhaps sometimes open to this charge because on account of  its exceedingly cautious language about nirvana it fails to set it up as  a reality contrasted with the world of suffering. But many varieties of  Indian religion do emphatically point to the infinite reality behind and  beyond Maya. It is only Maya which is unsatisfactory because it is  partial.    Another attempt to make the Universe intelligible regards it as an  eternal rhythm playing and pulsing outwards from spirit to matter  (pravritti) and then backwards and inwards from matter to spirit  (nirvritti). This idea seems implied by Sankara's view that creation is  similar to the sportive impulses of exuberant youth and the  Bhagavad-gita is familiar with _pravritti_ and _nirvritti_, but the  double character of the rhythm is emphasized most clearly in Sakta  treatises. Ordinary Hinduism concentrates its attention on the process  of liberation and return to Brahman, but the Tantras recognize and  consecrate both movements, the outward throbbing stream of energy and  enjoyment (bhukti) and the calm returning flow of liberation and peace.  Both are happiness, but the wise understand that the active outward  movement is right and happy only up to a certain point and under certain  restrictions.    That great poet Tulsi Das hints at an explanation of the creation or of  God's expansion of himself which will perhaps commend itself to  Europeans more than most Indian ideas, namely that the bliss enjoyed by  God and the souls whom he loves is greater than the bliss of solitary  divinity[76].      20. _Church and State_    I will now turn to another point, namely the relations of Church and  State. These are simplest in Buddhism, which teaches that the truth is  one, that all men ought to follow it and that all good kings should  honour and encourage it. This is also the Christian position but  Buddhism has almost always been tolerant and has hardly ever  countenanced the doctrine that error should be suppressed by force[77].  Buddhism does not claim to cover the whole field of religion as  understood in Europe: if people like to propitiate spirits in the hope  of obtaining wealth and crops, it permits them to do so. In Japan and  Tibet Buddhism has played a more secular role than in other countries,  analogous to the struggles of the mediaeval European church for temporal  authority. In Japan the great monasteries very nearly became the chief  military as well as the chief political power and this danger was  averted only by the destruction of Hieizan and other large  establishments in the sixteenth century. What was prevented in Japan did  actually happen in Tibet, for the monasteries became stronger than any  of the competing secular factions and the principal sect set up an  ecclesiastical government singularly like the Papacy. In southern  countries, such as Burma and Ceylon, Buddhism made no attempt to  interfere in politics. This aloofness is particularly remarkable in Siam  and Camboja, where state festivals are usually conducted by Brahmans not  by Buddhist ecclesiastics. In Siam, as formerly in Burma, the king being  a Buddhist is in some ways the head of the Church. He may reform lax  discipline or incorrect observances, but apparently not of his own  authority but merely as an executive power enforcing the opinion of the  higher clergy.    Buddhism and Hinduism both have the idea that the monk or priest is a  person who in virtue of ordination or birth lives on a higher level than  others. He may teach and do good but irrespective of that it is the duty  of the laity to support the priesthood. This doctrine is preached by  Hinduism in a stronger form than by Buddhism. The intellectual  superiority of the Brahmans as a caste was sufficiently real to ensure  its acceptance and in politics they had the good sense to rule by  serving, to be ministers and not kings. In theory and to a considerable  extent in practice, the Brahmans and their gods are not an _imperium in  imperio_ but an _imperium super imperium_. The position was possible  only because, unlike the Papacy and unlike the Lamas of Tibet, they had  no Pope and no hierarchy. They produced no a'Beckets or Hildebrands and  no Inquisition. They did not quarrel with science but monopolized it.    In India kings are expected to maintain the priesthood and the temples  yet Hinduism rarely assumes the form of a state religion[78] nor does it  admit, as state religions generally have to admit, that the secular arm  has a co-ordinate jurisdiction in ecclesiastical matters. Yet it affects  every department of social life and a Hindu who breaks with it loses his  social status. Hindu deities are rarely tribal gods like Athene of  Athens or the gods of Mr Kipling and the German Emperor. There are  thousands of shrines specially favoured by a divine presence but the  worshippers think of that presence not as the protector of a race or  city but as a special manifestation of a universal though often  invisible power. The conquests of Mohammedans and Christians are not  interpreted as meaning that the gods of Hinduism have succumbed to alien  deities.    The views prevalent in China and Japan as to the relations of Church and  State are almost the antipodes of those described. In those countries it  is the hardly dissembled theory of the official world that religion is a  department of government and that there should be regulations for gods  and worship, just as there are for ministers and etiquette. If we say  that religion is identified with the government in Tibet and forms an  _imperium super imperium_ in India, we may compare its position in the  Far East to native states under British rule. There is no interference  with creeds provided they respect ethical and social conventions:  interesting doctrines and rites are appreciated: the Government accepts  and rewards the loyal co-operation of the Buddhist and Taoist  priesthoods but maintains the right to restrict their activity should it  take a wrong political turn or should an excessive increase in the  number of monks seem a public danger. The Chinese Imperial Government  successfully claimed the strangest powers of ecclesiastical discipline,  since it promoted and degraded not only priests but deities. In both  China and Japan there has often been a strong current of feeling in the  official classes against Buddhism but on the other hand it often had the  support of both emperors and people, and princes not infrequently joined  the clergy, especially when it was desirable for them to live in  retirement. Confucianism and Shintoism, which are ethical and ceremonial  rather than doctrinal, have been in the past to some extent a law to the  governments of China and Japan, or more accurately an aspect of those  governments. But for many centuries Far Eastern statesmen have rarely  regarded Buddhism and Taoism as more than interesting and legitimate  activities, to be encouraged and regulated like educational and  scientific institutions.      21. _Public Worship and Ceremonial_    In no point does Hinduism differ from western religions more than in its  public worship and, in spite of much that is striking and interesting,  the comparison is not to the advantage of India. It is true that temple  worship is not so important for the Hindus as Church services are for  the Christian. They set more store on home ceremonies and on  contemplation. Still the temples of India are so numerous, so  conspicuous and so crowded that the religion which maintains them must  to some extent be judged by them.    At any rate they avoid the faults of public worship in the west. The  practice of arranging the congregation in seats for which they pay seems  to me more irreligious than the slovenliness of the heathen and makes  the whole performance resemble a very dull concert.    Protestant services are in the main modelled on the ritual of the  synagogue. They are meetings of the laity at which the scriptures are  read, prayers offered, sermons preached and benedictions pronounced. The  clergy play a principal but not exclusive part. The rites of the Roman  and Eastern Churches have borrowed much from pagan ceremonial but still  they have not wholly departed from the traditions of the synagogue.  These have also served as a model for Mohammedan ritual which differs  from the Jewish in little but its almost military regularity.    But with all this the ordinary ritual of Hindu temples[79] has nothing  in common. It derives from another origin and follows other lines. The  temple is regarded as the court of a prince and the daily ceremonies are  the attendance of his courtiers on him. He must be awakened, fed, amused  and finally put to bed. This conception of ritual prevailed in Egypt but  in India there is no trace of it in Vedic literature and perhaps it did  not come into fashion until Gupta times. Although the laity may be  present and salute the god, such worship cannot be called  congregational. Yet in other ways a Hindu temple may provide as much  popular worship as a Nonconformist chapel.
