In these distresses, some, for want of help to hold them  down in their beds or to look to them, laid hands upon themselves as  above; some broke out into the streets, perhaps naked, and would run  directly down to the river, if they were not stopped by the watchmen or  other officers, and plunge themselves into the water wherever they found  it.    It often pierced my very soul to hear the groans and cries of those who  were thus tormented. But of the two, this was counted the most promising  particular in the whole infection: for if these swellings could be  brought to a head, and to break and run, or, as the surgeons call it, to  \"digest,\" the patient generally recovered; whereas those who, like the  gentlewoman's daughter, were struck with death at the beginning, and had  the tokens come out upon them, often went about indifferently easy till  a little before they died, and some till the moment they dropped down,  as in apoplexies and epilepsies is often the case. Such would be taken  suddenly very sick, and would run to a bench or bulk, or any convenient  place that offered itself, or to their own houses, if possible, as I  mentioned before, and there sit down, grow faint, and die. This kind of  dying was much the same as it was with those who die of common  mortifications,[140] who die swooning, and, as it were, go away in a  dream. Such as died thus had very little notice of their being infected  at all till the gangrene was spread through their whole body; nor could  physicians themselves know certainly how it was with them till they  opened their breasts, or other parts of their body, and saw the tokens.    We had at this time a great many frightful stories told us of nurses and  watchmen who looked after the dying people (that is to say, hired  nurses, who attended infected people), using them barbarously, starving  them, smothering them, or by other wicked means hastening their end,  that is to say, murdering of them. And watchmen being set to guard  houses that were shut up, when there has been but one person left, and  perhaps that one lying sick, that[141] they have broke in and murdered  that body, and immediately thrown them out into the dead cart; and so  they have gone scarce cold to the grave.    I cannot say but that some such murders were committed, and I think two  were sent to prison for it, but died before they could be tried; and I  have heard that three others, at several times, were executed for  murders of that kind. But I must say I believe nothing of its being so  common a crime as some have since been pleased to say; nor did it seem  to be so rational, where the people were brought so low as not to be  able to help themselves; for such seldom recovered, and there was no  temptation to commit a murder, at least not equal to the fact, where  they were sure persons would die in so short a time, and could not live.    That there were a great many robberies and wicked practices committed  even in this dreadful time, I do not deny. The power of avarice was so  strong in some, that they would run any hazard to steal and to plunder;  and, particularly in houses where all the families or inhabitants have  been dead and carried out, they would break in at all hazards, and,  without regard to the danger of infection, take even the clothes off the  dead bodies, and the bedclothes from others where they lay dead.    This, I suppose, must be the case of a family in Houndsditch, where a  man and his daughter (the rest of the family being, as I suppose,  carried away before by the dead cart) were found stark naked, one in one  chamber and one in another, lying dead on the floor, and the clothes of  the beds (from whence it is supposed they were rolled off by thieves)  stolen, and carried quite away.    It is indeed to be observed that the women were, in all this calamity,  the most rash, fearless, and desperate creatures. And, as there were  vast numbers that went about as nurses to tend those that were sick,  they committed a great many petty thieveries in the houses where they  were employed; and some of them were publicly whipped for it, when  perhaps they ought rather to have been hanged for examples,[142] for  numbers of houses were robbed on these occasions; till at length the  parish officers were sent to recommend nurses to the sick, and always  took an account who it was they sent, so as that they might call them to  account if the house had been abused where they were placed.    But these robberies extended chiefly to wearing-clothes, linen, and what  rings or money they could come at, when the person died who was under  their care, but not to a general plunder of the houses. And I could give  you an account of one of these nurses, who several years after, being on  her deathbed, confessed with the utmost horror the robberies she had  committed at the time of her being a nurse, and by which she had  enriched herself to a great degree. But as for murders, I do not find  that there was ever any proofs of the fact in the manner as it has been  reported, except as above.    They did tell me, indeed, of a nurse in one place that laid a wet cloth  upon the face of a dying patient whom she tended, and so put an end to  his life, who was just expiring before; and another that smothered a  young woman she was looking to, when she was in a fainting fit, and  would have come to herself; some that killed them by giving them one  thing, some another, and some starved them by giving them nothing at  all. But these stories had two marks of suspicion that always attended  them, which caused me always to slight them, and to look on them as mere  stories that people continually frighted one another with: (1) That  wherever it was that we heard it, they always placed the scene at the  farther end of the town, opposite or most remote from where you were to  hear it. If you heard it in Whitechapel, it had happened at St.  Giles's, or at Westminster, or Holborn, or that end of the town; if you  heard it at that end of the town, then it was done in Whitechapel, or  the Minories, or about Cripplegate Parish; if you heard of it in the  city, why, then, it happened in Southwark; and, if you heard of it in  Southwark, then it was done in the city; and the like.    In the next place, of whatsoever part you heard the story, the  particulars were always the same, especially that of laying a wet double  clout[143] on a dying man's face, and that of smothering a young  gentlewoman: so that it was apparent, at least to my judgment, that  there was more of tale than of truth in those things.    A neighbor and acquaintance of mine, having some money owing to him from  a shopkeeper in Whitecross Street or thereabouts, sent his apprentice, a  youth about eighteen years of age, to endeavor to get the money. He came  to the door, and, finding it shut, knocked pretty hard, and, as he  thought, heard somebody answer within, but was not sure: so he waited,  and after some stay knocked again, and then a third time, when he heard  somebody coming downstairs.    At length the man of the house came to the door. He had on his breeches,  or drawers, and a yellow flannel waistcoat, no stockings, a pair of slip  shoes, a white cap on his head, and, as the young man said, death in his  face.    When he opened the door, says he, \"What do you disturb me thus for?\" The  boy, though a little surprised, replied, \"I come from such a one; and my  master sent me for the money, which he says you know of.\"--\"Very well,  child,\" returns the living ghost; \"call, as you go by, at Cripplegate  Church, and bid them ring the bell,\" and with these words shut the door  again, and went up again, and died the same day, nay, perhaps the same  hour. This the young man told me himself, and I have reason to believe  it. This was while the plague was not come to a height. I think it was  in June, towards the latter end of the month. It must have been before  the dead carts came about, and while they used the ceremony of ringing  the bell for the dead, which was over for certain, in that parish at  least, before the month of July; for by the 25th of July there died five  hundred and fifty and upwards in a week, and then they could no more  bury in form[144] rich or poor.    I have mentioned above, that, notwithstanding this dreadful calamity,  yet that[145] numbers of thieves were abroad upon all occasions where  they had found any prey, and that these were generally women. It was one  morning about eleven o'clock, I had walked out to my brother's house in  Coleman Street Parish, as I often did, to see that all was safe.    My brother's house had a little court before it, and a brick wall and a  gate in it, and within that several warehouses, where his goods of  several sorts lay. It happened that in one of these warehouses were  several packs of women's high-crowned hats, which came out of the  country, and were, as I suppose, for exportation, whither I know not.    I was surprised that when I came near my brother's door, which was in a  place they called Swan Alley, I met three or four women with  high-crowned hats on their heads; and, as I remembered afterwards, one,  if not more, had some hats likewise in their hands. But as I did not see  them come out at my brother's door, and not knowing that my brother had  any such goods in his warehouse, I did not offer to say anything to  them, but went across the way to shun meeting them, as was usual to do  at that time, for fear of the plague. But when I came nearer to the  gate, I met another woman, with more hats, come out of the gate. \"What  business, mistress,\" said I, \"have you had there?\"--\"There are more  people there,\" said she. \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1723"],[0,"Cow-Country (#17)"],[1,"a voracious attack upon the  heaped platters of chicken and dumplings and the bowls of vegetables.  Bud found a place at the end where he could look into the kitchen,  and his eyes went that way as often as they dared, following the swift  motions of the little woman who poured coffee and filled empty dishes  and said never a word to anyone.    He was on the point of believing her a daughter of the house when a  square-jawed man of thirty, or thereabout, who sat at Bud's right hand,  called her to him as he might have called his dog, by snapping his  fingers.    She came and stood beside Bud while the man spoke to her in an arrogant  undertone.    \"Marian, I told yuh I wanted tea for dinner after this. D'you bring me  coffee on purpose, just to be onery? I thought I told yuh to straighten  up and quit that sulkin'. I ain't going to have folks think----\"    \"Oh, be quiet! Shame on you, before everyone!\" she whispered fiercely  while she lifted the cup and saucer.    Bud went hot all over. He did not look up when she returned presently  with a cup of tea, but he felt her presence poignantly, as he had never  before sensed the presence of a woman. When he was able to swallow his  wrath and meet calmly the glances of these strangers he turned his head  casually and looked the man over.    Her husband, he guessed the fellow to be. No other relationship could  account for that tone of proprietorship, and there was no physical  resemblance between the two. A mean devil, Bud called him mentally,  with a narrow forehead, eyes set too far apart and the mouth of a brute.  Someone spoke to the man, calling him Lew, and he answered with rough  good humor, repeating a stale witticism and laughing at it just as  though he had not heard others say it a hundred times.    Bud looked at him again and hated him, but he did not glance again at  the little woman named Marian; for his own peace of mind he did not  dare. He thought that he knew now what it was he had seen in the depth  of her eyes, but there seemed to be nothing that he could do to help.    That evening after supper Honey Krause called to him when he was  starting down to the bunk-house with the other men. What she said  was that she still had his guitar and mandolin, and that they needed  exercise. What she looked was the challenge of a born coquette. In the  kitchen dishes were rattling, but after they were washed there would be  a little leisure, perhaps, for the kitchen drudge. Bud's impulse to make  his sore hands an excuse for refusing evaporated. It might not be wise  to place himself deliberately in the way of getting a hurt--but youth  never did stop to consult a sage before following the lure of a woman's  eyes.    He called back to Honey that those instruments ought to have been put in  the hayfield, where there was more exercise than the men could use. \"You  boys ought to come and see me safe through with it,\" he added to the  loitering group around him. \"I'm afraid of women.\"    They laughed and two or three went with him. Lew went on to the corral  and presently appeared on horseback, riding up to the kitchen and  leaving his horse standing at the corner while he went inside and talked  to the woman he had called Marian.    Bud was carrying his guitar outside, where it was cooler, when he heard  the fellow's arrogant voice. The dishes ceased rattling for a  minute, and there was a sharp exclamation, stifled but unmistakable.  Involuntarily Bud made a movement in that direction, when Honey's voice  stopped him with a subdued laugh.    \"That's only Lew and Mary Ann,\" she explained carelessly. \"They have a  spat every time they come within gunshot of each other.\"    The lean fellow who had driven the mower, and whose name was Jerry  Myers, edged carelessly close to Bud and gave him a nudge with his  elbow, and a glance from under his eyebrows by way of emphasis. He  turned his head slightly, saw that Honey had gone into the house, and  muttered just above a whisper, \"Don't see or hear anything. It's all the  help you can give her. And for Lord's sake don't let on to Honey like  you--give a cuss whether it rains or not, so long 's it don't pour too  hard the night of the dance.\"    Bud looked up at the darkening sky speculatively, and tried not to hear  the voices in the kitchen, one of which was brutally harsh while the  other told of hate and fear suppressed under gentle forbearance. The  harsh voice was almost continuous, the other infrequent, reluctant to  speak at all. Bud wanted to go in and smash his guitar over the fellow's  head, but Jerry's warning held him. There were other ways, however, to  help; if he must not drive off the tormentor, then he would call him  away. He ignored his bruised knuckles and plucked the guitar strings as  if he held a grudge against them, and then began to sing the first song  that came into his mind--one that started in a rollicky fashion.    Men came straggling up from the bunk-house before he had finished the  first chorus, and squatted on their heels to listen, their cigarettes  glowing like red fingertips in the dusk. But the voice in the kitchen  talked on. Bud tried another--one of those old-time favorites, a  \"laughing coon\" song, though he felt little enough in the mood for it.  In the middle of the first laugh he heard the kitchen door slam, and  Lew's footsteps coming around the corner. He listened until the song  was done, then mounted and rode away, Bud's laugh following him  triumphantly--though Lew could not have guessed its meaning.    Bud sang for two hours expectantly, but Marian did not appear, and Bud  went off to the bunk-house feeling that his attempt to hearten her had  been a failure. Of Honey he did not think at all, except to wonder if  the two women were related in any way, and to feel that if they were  Marian was to be pitied. At that point Jerry overtook him and asked for  a match, which gave him an excuse to hold Bud behind the others.    \"Honey like to have caught me, to-night,\" Jerry observed guardedly.  \"I had to think quick. I'll tell you the lay of the land, Bud, seeing  you're a stranger here. Marian's man, Lew, he's a damned bully and  somebody is going to draw a fine bead on him some day when he ain't  looking. But he stands in, so the less yuh take notice the better.  Marian, she's a fine little woman that minds her own business, but she's  getting a cold deck slipped into the game right along. Honey's jealous  of her and afraid somebody'll give her a pleasant look. Lew's jealous,  and he watches her like a cat watches a mouse it's caught and wants to  play with. Between the two of 'em Marian has a real nice time of it. I'm  wising you up so you won't hand her any more misery by trying to take  her part. Us boys have learned to keep our mouths shut.\"    \"Glad you told me,\" Bud muttered. \"Otherwise----\"    \"Exactly,\" Jerry agreed understandingly. \"Otherwise any of us would.\"    He stopped and then spoke in a different tone. \"If Lew stays off the  ranch long enough, maybe you'll get to hear her sing. Wow-ee, but that  lady has sure got the meadow-larks whipped! But look out for Honey,  old-timer.\"    Bud laughed unmirthfully. \"Looks to me as if you aren't crazy over  Honey,\" he ventured. \"What has she done to you?\"    \"Her?\" Jerry inspected his cigarette, listened to the whisper of  prudence in his ear, and turned away. \"Forget it. I never said a word.\"  He swept the whole subject from him with a comprehensive gesture, and  snorted. \"I'm gettin' as bad as Pop,\" he grinned. \"But lemme tell yuh  something. Honey Krause runs more 'n the post-office.\"        CHAPTER ELEVEN: GUILE AGAINST THE WILY    Bud liked to have his life run along accustomed lines with a more or  less perfect balance of work and play, friendships and enmities. He  had grown up with the belief that any mystery is merely a synonym for  menace. He had learned to be wary of known enemies such as Indians  and outlaws, and to trust implicitly his friends. To feel now, without  apparent cause, that his friends might be enemies in disguise, was a new  experience that harried him.    He had come to Little Lost on Tuesday, straight from the Muleshoe  where his presence was no longer desired for some reason not yet  satisfactorily explained to him. You know what happened on Tuesday. That  night the land crouched under a terrific electric storm, with crackling  swords of white death dazzling from inky black clouds, and ear-splitting  thunder close on the heels of it. Bud had known such storms all his  life, yet on this night he was uneasy, vaguely disturbed. He caught  himself wondering if Lew Morris's wife was frightened, and the  realization that he was worrying about her fear worried him more than  ever and held him awake long after the fury of the storm had passed.    Next day, when he came in at noon, there was Hen, from the Muleshoe,  waiting for dinner before he rode back with the mail. Hen's jaw dropped  when he saw Bud riding on a Little Lost hay-wagon, and his eyes bulged  with what Bud believed was consternation. All through the meal Bud had  caught Hen eyeing him miserably, and looking stealthily from him to the  others. No one paid any attention, and for that Bud was rather thankful;  he did not want the Little Lost fellows to think that perhaps he had  done something which he knew would hang him if it were discovered,  which, he decided, was the mildest interpretation a keen observer would  be apt to make of Hen's behavior.    When he went out, Hen was at his heels, trying to say something in his  futile, tongue-tied gobble. Bud stopped and looked at him tolerantly.  \"Hen, It's no use--you might as well be talking Chinese, for all I  know. If it's important, write it down or I'll never know what's on your  mind.\"    He pulled a note-book and a pencil from his vest-pocket and gave them  to Hen, who looked at him dumbly, worked his Adam's apple violently and  retreated to his horse, fumbled the mail which was"]]]
