The spirit of their art was entirely opposed to that of  the renaissance architects, for the success of whose designs uniformity  and continuity of plan and detail were absolutely necessary. It is  curious, also, that these very builders who were so daring and so  profuse of ornament, were often very careless in matters of structure,  and at times were even guilty of something very like jerry-building, as  the account of the restoration of the south transept will show. The  vaulting of the transepts is also most unusual and well worthy of  attention. It raises many problems which have been little noticed by  most investigators of the history of the minster.    Like the vault of the nave, it is of wood, and dates probably from the  beginning of the fifteenth century. In the north transept it is covered  with plaster; in the south this has been removed by Mr Street, and oak  panelling inserted. It has been stated that the vault of the nave and  choir, though wooden, resembles a stone vault in form and structure. Not  so that of the transepts, which is a curious compromise between the form  of the ordinary vault of stone and the simple barrel roof. It is an  attempt, in fact, to combine the advantages of both.    It is the merit of groined vaulting that it emphasises the division into  bays, and is capable of great richness of structural decoration. On the  other hand, it involves a great loss of height, for the ridge of the  vault can be little higher than the top of the clerestory windows, and  it cuts off the whole space covered by the roof above it from the  building which it covers. The structure of the vault will be perhaps  most easily understood if it is conceived as a flat roof of stone of the  same height as the top of the clerestory, supported by fan-shaped  brackets springing from a point between the clerestory windows, and  rising and spreading out until they reach the central ridge of the  vault. As the vault is, but for these brackets, in its essence flat,  there must of necessity be a great sacrifice of space between it and the  roof above it. This sacrifice of space is obviated by the barrel roof,  which nearly approaches to the shape of the outside roof, and fits into  it without the loss of space entailed by the vault. But the barrel roof  does not readily submit to a structural division into bays, or a  structural decoration by means of ribs and bosses such as ornament and  emphasise the divisions of the intersecting vault.    Wishing, as has been said, to combine the advantages of both forms, the  designers of the transept roof have given it the shape of a barrel roof,  and have covered it with a network of ribs, some of which converge  between the bays of the building and meet at a point on a level with the  bottom of the clerestory. The roof, therefore, has at first sight the  appearance of a vault, but it remains a barrel roof divided by ribs all  the same; and this will be evident so soon as it is remarked that the  top of the roof is not on a level with the top of the clerestory, but  some way above it. It is, therefore, not to be conceived as a flat roof  supported by brackets, but as an almost circular roof ornamented and  divided by structurally unnecessary ribs. Indeed, it would be altogether  impossible to combine a vault with such a clerestory as is found in  these transepts, for a vault is a roof designed to fit a pointed arch.  Its spreading supports make it impossible to adapt it to any other than  an arched clerestory; and the clerestory of these transepts, consisting  as it does of a row of five lancet windows, is flat at the top. A barrel  roof, on the contrary, will fit any kind of buildings, but,  unfortunately, it is seldom successful, except in round-arched churches.  To some of these--as, for example, in Auvergne--it has been applied with  magnificent effect. It is very rare in England. It is always very  difficult to decorate. The fifteenth century builders having for some  reason or other decided on the form, and being but little accustomed to  it, determined to treat it like a vault. They covered it with a network  of ribs, and where these ribs met they placed bosses. They also caused  these ribs, as far as possible, to take the same direction that the  structure of a real vault would give to them. No doubt the ribs serve  some useful purpose as a support to the roof, especially as that roof is  slightly pointed and not circular, like the barrel roof proper; but the  whole effect is unfortunate. The artistic merits of the real vault are  evident. It is logical, capable of much structural decoration, and it  determines and explains the whole plan of the bays both inside and out.  The merits of the barrel roof are also evident. It also is logical,  though in a less degree than the vault. It does not determine or explain  the plan of the building below it, but it is easily adaptable, and it  has a simplicity and a marked grandeur of its own. The roof at York has  none of this simplicity. To the most casual visitor it is puzzling and  complicated. To the eye which looks farther, which seeks for the logic  of its construction, it is still more puzzling. It may deceive the  careless observer with the idea that it is a vault, but it will not  convince him that it is a good one. It is a work of great ingenuity, but  not of great art. It is impossible to say what was there before it. If  we knew, we might be able to understand why the builders of the  fifteenth century hit upon such a form; and it may be that they were  forced by structural necessities to do so. Some space may perhaps be  allowed to a conjecture on the subject. It will be remembered that when  the present transept was built no part of the present nave or choir was  existing; and only the core of the piers supporting the present tower.  The tower itself as we see it, the arches over the pier, and the casing  of those piers, all date from a period later than the transepts. The  Norman nave and choir, existing when these transepts were begun, were,  of course, much less lofty than the present nave and choir. If,  therefore, the roof of the transept was of its present height, it must  also have been far higher than the roof of the then existing nave; and,  consequently, of the four arches supporting the central tower, those to  the north and south must have been very much higher than those to the  east and west. If the transepts had had a vault originally, this  arrangement would have been plainly impossible, as a vault would have  covered up a great part of the east and west arches. But, though the  shape of the clerestory makes it plain that a vault was never even  intended, it seems very unlikely that the north and south arches were  originally loftier than those east and west. If we suppose that they  were all originally designed and built of the same height, we shall find  a very plausible reason for the form which the present roof has taken.  In such a case the transept must have had a flat wooden roof, the  natural covering to a clerestory of such a design, and must have looked,  with its great width, very squat and low. But when the new and far  loftier nave was built, it, of course, became necessary to heighten the  western of the four arches supporting the tower, and afterwards to go  through the same process with regard to the eastern arch. At such a  time, when the choir was completed, the two arches east and west would  be much loftier than the two north and south. Before rebuilding the  tower it would naturally occur to the builders to raise the north and  south arches to a level with the others, and to do this it would be  necessary to raise the roof. In such a case it would be quite natural  for the builders to hit upon such a roof as at present exists. They  would have before them already the example of a wooden vault in the  nave, and for the sake of uniformity they would be inclined to make  their new roof as much like that vault as possible. Having the size and  height of their arch settled before they designed their roof, the roof  would of necessity be shaped to fit the arch, and this would be the most  convenient roof for the purpose under the circumstances. This theory  will explain why a new roof was required in the fifteenth century, and  it also helps to explain other difficulties. For example, it is hard to  understand why the transepts, being so wide, are not loftier, and why  their original design made a vault impossible. But if we remember that  they were originally additions to a much lower nave and choir, we shall  see that their architect, having determined on a plan of great width,  was in a difficulty. If he made his transepts much higher than his nave,  the effect, both inside and out, would be very irregular. If he made  them of the same height, and vaulted them, they would be far too wide  for their height. He therefore determined, we will suppose, to make a  wooden roof which would sacrifice as little of the height of his  transepts as possible, and yet allow them to fit on to his nave without  any appearance of incongruity.    He may also have expected that a loftier nave would soon be built, and  set a temporary roof on his transepts which could be easily removed and  adapted to new requirements.    Be that as it may, the transepts are altogether a curious patchwork, yet  when entered from the south end they seem almost entirely satisfactory,  since the eye is so engrossed by the magnificence of the five great  lancets of the north front, and the great height of the lantern, that it  is unable to take note of any smaller and less satisfactory details.    The two transepts are alike in the arrangement of their bays and in the  general lines of their design, though they differ wholly in the  arrangement of their fronts, and in many little points of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19423"],[0,"The Story of Porcelain (#17)"],[1,"of Mr. Croyden, Theo,\" laughed  Dr. Swift good-naturedly. \"I am coming to fear that if you go to  visit him as he wants you to, you never will come back home.\"    Theo smiled.    \"You can't lose me so easily, Dad,\" he answered. \"Just the same, I  know if I do go and visit the Croydens I'll have a bully time. But I'd  like to wait until I get rid of these crutches so I won't be a bother  to anybody.\"    \"That is wise. I should not feel easy if you started out on a visit  before you were quite well,\" replied Dr. Swift. \"However, it won't be  long now before you can cast your crutches into the rubbish heap. In  the meantime your own family can have a visit with you. I rather fancy  your mother will be thankful to have you home again; she has been  pretty anxious about you. No mother likes having her boy where she  cannot get to him when he is ill.\"    \"But you were there, Dad.\"    Dr. Swift smiled into the eyes that met his.    \"Yes, I was there, to be sure,\" he assented. \"But a doctor is not  necessarily a good nurse.\"    \"I don't see how anybody could be a better nurse than you, Father.\"    The Doctor shook his head.    \"I'm afraid I did not fuss much over you,\" he answered. \"At least I  did not smother you with attention the way your mother would have  done. You got no spoiling from me. I expect, though, that when your  mother gets hold of you she won't be able to do enough for you. I can  see her to-day flying round the house ordering all the things you like  to eat, and getting everything ready for your coming. I shall have no  attention at all.\"    Theo beamed.    \"You will have all the attention you want, and more too, Dad, I  guess,\" he remarked drily. \"Probably a string of patients as long as  this car will be waiting to pounce on you the minute you set foot in  New York.\"    \"I expect so, son. However, I shall not begrudge that sort of a  welcome now, for I feel like a fighting cock.\"    \"You really are rested, aren't you, Father?\"    \"I am like another man,\" was the vehement reply. \"I was about all in  when we went into camp. Thanks to you and Mr. Croyden I have had a  fine chance to pull myself together and prepare for whatever comes  next. You have been very thoughtful and unselfish, Theo, in leaving me  free to get all I could out of my vacation. It has meant everything.\"    \"I wanted to help you, Dad.\"    \"You've certainly proved that, my boy. I've appreciated every bit of  it.\"    A quick glance passed between the two.    They understood each other very well, Theo and his father.    \"Here is Mr. Croyden,\" observed Theo. \"He has been getting off some  mail and telegrams.\"    \"That is precisely what I must do,\" declared the Doctor rising. \"I'll  leave you to have one of your china-making talks while I am gone.\"    As the Doctor passed through into the next car Mr. Croyden sauntered  down the aisle and dropped into the seat he had just vacated.    \"There,\" announced the merchant with a satisfied sigh, \"I have done my  duty. I have sent off three telegrams and a lot of letters. How funny  it seems to get busy after being so idle! Next week will see us all  back at the grind, I suppose, and rushing about as if we had never  been away.\"    \"Are you sorry?\"    \"No,\" was the hearty response. \"I like to play when I play; but I like  also to work. I enjoy my business very much. It is an interesting and  useful one, and I like to think that in my small way I am helping to  furnish the world with things that are necessary, and tend toward  comfort and convenience as well as toward beauty. People cannot get on  without dishes--you and I have proved that.\"    \"Not unless we all go back to being savages,\" said Theo humorously.    \"We shall not do that, I hope,\" returned Mr. Croyden gravely. \"Each  century should see the race farther ahead--a more honest, kindlier,  Christian nation. That is the motto we must bring with us out of this  war. Not more territory, more money, more power; but truer manhood and  purer souls. If the conflict does this for our people all the  sacrifice and loss of life it has meant will not have been in  vain. Out of the wreck a better America should arise, and we each must  help it to arise--you as well as I, for we need not only good men and  women but good boys and girls, if we are to have a fine country.\"    \"A boy can't do much toward it, I'm afraid,\" Theo said.    \"On the contrary, a boy can do a great deal,\" replied Mr. Croyden. \"It  is the boys of to-day who are going to be the men of to-morrow; and  there is no such thing as suddenly becoming a good man, any more than  there is such a thing as a seed suddenly becoming a full-blown plant.  Everything has to grow, and grow slowly, too. So if you wish to be a  wise, honest citizen who will help forward this glorious country we  all love so much, you want to be setting about it right now, you and  every other boy. And you want to go at the work earnestly, too, for  you will be a man before you know it.\"    \"It looks a long way off to me now,\" mused Theo.    \"Such things always do; but time flies pretty fast. You will find  yourself in college the next thing you know; and after that you will  be beginning to plan your career. What are you going to be, Theo?\"    \"I don't know, sir,\" was the uncertain answer. \"I'd just like to do  something that really needs to be done; something that people cannot  get on without.\"    \"That is a splendid ambition,\" came heartily from Mr. Croyden. \"I  thought perhaps you'd be thinking of taking up your father's job.\"    \"I be a surgeon!\" gasped Theo.    \"Why not?\"    \"Oh, because I'd be no good at it,\" the boy said. \"I should never  know what to do with sick people. I'd be scared to death. It seems to  me now that I would rather go into making something; but I do not just  know what.\"    \"You want to be a business man, eh?\"    \"That is what I'd rather do.\"    \"Humph!\"    There was an interval of silence; then Mr. Croyden said:    \"Well, if when you are through your education, Theo, we are out of  this war and you are still of the same mind, you come to me. Who knows  but you might end your days in my factories?\"    The boy's eyes sparkled.    \"Croyden and Swift--how would that sound?\"    \"It would sound all right,\" chuckled Theo, \"but I am afraid the sound  would be the best part of it. Why, I'd never be able to learn all you  know about china if I lived to be a hundred years old.\"    \"Aren't you learning things about china right now? Haven't you already  learned about the pottery and porcelain of almost every nation under  the sun?\"    \"I have liked to have you tell me about it,\" replied Theo modestly.    \"Well, isn't that making a beginning?\" queried the pottery  merchant. \"We have discussed the china output of almost every country,  haven't we?\"    Theo reflected.    \"All the big countries except England.\"    \"How did we happen to leave England out?\"    \"I guess you did not have time to get round to England,\" answered  Theo. \"Still all the time isn't gone yet, you know; you might tell me  about England now.\"    They both laughed.    \"I believe you are something of a diplomat, Theo,\" observed  Mr. Croyden. \"You are either a diplomat or you are a schemer.  Sometimes it is very hard to tell the one from the other. In either  case you seem determined to give me no peace, so I fancy I may as well  tell you about English porcelain and have done with it. If I do not do  it now I shall have to do it some other time, I suppose.\"    \"I suppose you will,\" came delightedly from Theo.    \"Well, here goes, then!\"    The elder man settled back into a comfortable position and Theo  wriggled contentedly into the opposite corner of the seat.    \"As you can well understand,\" began Mr. Croyden, \"the discovery of  kaolin set England as eagerly to experimenting at porcelain-making as  it had the other nations. Contrary, however, to other countries the  English Government lent no helping hand to the industry, offering  neither money nor inducements to those who would take it up. Therefore  only those persons who were sufficiently interested in the new  venture, and could afford to make the attempt with their own capital,  dared go into it. Fortunately there were at hand some of these  ambitious manufacturers. Their early experiences are interesting not  so much because of the quality of their work though much of it was  good, as because they were the forerunners of later workers. The paste  they used was not as fine as that of the Chinese or Japanese; or in  fact, that of the early Dresden or Sevres ware. Gradually, however, it  became better, until now--although England turns out almost no true  porcelain, that is, the scientifically blended kaolin and petuntse  clays--she makes some of the most beautiful and durable china  manufactured anywhere.\"    \"What is it made of?\" inquired Theo, much puzzled.    \"Different combinations of kaolin clays and phosphates; a ware which  in the porcelain trade is known as bone china,\" replied Mr. Croyden.  \"The phosphate of lime that is mixed with the kaolin renders the body  of the ware more porous and elastic. On such china the glaze does not  blend with the body and become an actual part of it as is the case  with a true porcelain, but on the contrary is an outer coating which  can be scratched through. But bone china is very strong, and does not  chip as does a more brittle variety. For that reason where wear and  durability are desired it is often preferred.\"    Mr. Croyden stopped a second.    \"When I tell you these facts you must not think I am crying down the  English wares,\" he said. \"I could show you beautiful varieties of  English porcelain. I merely wish you to understand that it has not the  qualities of the Chinese, Japanese, Sevres, Dresden, or even the more  modern Limoges ware. But what it loses in delicacy and translucence it  makes up in strength, and perhaps after all strength is as desirable  as any other quality.\"    \"Didn't the English ever make any real hard "]]]
