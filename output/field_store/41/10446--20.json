Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#17)"],[1," up Elizabeth to be led in chains to the feet  of the rightful Lord of Creation, the Old Man of the Seven Hills.  And this fair hope, which has been skipping just in front of them for  centuries, always a step farther off, like the place where the rainbow  touches the ground, they used to announce at times, in language which  terrified old Mr. Leigh. One day, indeed, as Eustace entered his  father's private room, after his usual visit to the mill, he could  hear voices high in dispute; Parsons as usual, blustering; Mr. Leigh  peevishly deprecating, and Campian, who was really the sweetest-natured  of men, trying to pour oil on the troubled waters. Whereat Eustace (for  the good of the cause, of course) stopped outside and listened.    \"My excellent sir,\" said Mr. Leigh, \"does not your very presence here  show how I am affected toward the holy cause of the Catholic faith? But  I cannot in the meanwhile forget that I am an Englishman.\"    \"And what is England?\" said Parsons: \"A heretic and schismatic Babylon,  whereof it is written, 'Come out of her, my people, lest you be partaker  of her plagues.' Yea, what is a country? An arbitrary division of  territory by the princes of this world, who are naught, and come to  naught. They are created by the people's will; their existence depends  on the sanction of him to whom all power is given in heaven and  earth--our Holy Father the Pope. Take away the latter, and what is a  king?--the people who have made him may unmake him.\"    \"My dear sir, recollect that I have sworn allegiance to Queen  Elizabeth!\"    \"Yes, sir, you have, sir; and, as I have shown at large in my writings,  you were absolved from that allegiance from the moment that the bull of  Pius the Fifth declared her a heretic and excommunicate, and thereby to  have forfeited all dominion whatsoever. I tell you, sir, what I thought  you should have known already, that since the year 1569, England has had  no queen, no magistrates, no laws, no lawful authority whatsoever; and  that to own allegiance to any English magistrate, sir, or to plead in an  English court of law, is to disobey the apostolic precept, 'How dare you  go to law before the unbelievers?' I tell you, sir, rebellion is now not  merely permitted, it is a duty.\"    \"Take care, sir; for God's sake, take care!\" said Mr. Leigh. \"Right or  wrong, I cannot have such language used in my house. For the sake of my  wife and children, I cannot!\"    \"My dear brother Parsons, deal more gently with the flock,\" interposed  Campian. \"Your opinion, though probable, as I well know, in the eyes of  most of our order, is hardly safe enough here; the opposite is at least  so safe that Mr. Leigh may well excuse his conscience for accepting it.  After all, are we not sent hither to proclaim this very thing, and to  relieve the souls of good Catholics from a burden which has seemed to  them too heavy?\"    \"Yes,\" said Parsons, half-sulkily, \"to allow all Balaams who will to  sacrifice to Baal, while they call themselves by the name of the Lord.\"    \"My dear brother, have I not often reminded you that Naaman was allowed  to bow himself in the house of Rimmon? And can we therefore complain of  the office to which the Holy Father has appointed us, to declare to such  as Mr. Leigh his especial grace, by which the bull of Pius the Fifth  (on whose soul God have mercy!) shall henceforth bind the queen and the  heretics only; but in no ways the Catholics, at least as long as the  present tyranny prevents the pious purposes of the bull?\"    \"Be it so, sir; be it so. Only observe this, Mr. Leigh, that our brother  Campian confesses this to be a tyranny. Observe, sir, that the bull does  still bind the so-called queen, and that she and her magistrates are  still none the less usurpers, nonentities, and shadows of a shade. And  observe this, sir, that when that which is lawful is excused to the  weak, it remains no less lawful to the strong. The seven thousand who  had not bowed the knee to Baal did not slay his priests; but Elijah did,  and won to himself a good reward. And if the rest of the children of  Israel sinned not in not slaying Eglon, yet Ehud's deed was none the  less justified by all laws human and divine.\"    \"For Heaven's sake, do not talk so, sir! or I must leave the room. What  have I to do with Ehud and Eglon, and slaughters, and tyrannies? Our  queen is a very good queen, if Heaven would but grant her repentance,  and turn her to the true faith. I have never been troubled about  religion, nor any one else that I know of in the West country.\"    \"You forget Mr. Trudgeon of Launceston, father, and poor Father Mayne,\"  interposed Eustace, who had by this time slipped in; and Campian added  softly--    \"Yes, your West of England also has been honored by its martyrs, as well  as my London by the precious blood of Story.\"    \"What, young malapert?\" cried poor Leigh, facing round upon his son,  glad to find any one on whom he might vent his ill-humor; \"are you too  against me, with a murrain on you? And pray, what the devil brought  Cuthbert Mayne to the gallows, and turned Mr. Trudgeon (he was always a  foolish hot-head) out of house and home, but just such treasonable talk  as Mr. Parsons must needs hold in my house, to make a beggar of me and  my children, as he will before he has done.\"    \"The Blessed Virgin forbid!\" said Campian.    \"The Blessed Virgin forbid? But you must help her to forbid it, Mr.  Campian. We should never have had the law of 1571, against bulls, and  Agnus Deis, and blessed grains, if the Pope's bull of 1569 had not made  them matter of treason, by preventing a poor creature's saving his soul  in the true Church without putting his neck into a halter by denying the  queen's authority.\"    \"What, sir?\" almost roared Parsons, \"do you dare to speak evil of the  edicts of the Vicar of Christ?\"    \"I? No. I didn't. Who says I did? All I meant was, I am sure--Mr.  Campian, you are a reasonable man, speak for me.\"    \"Mr. Leigh only meant, I am sure, that the Holy Father's prudent  intentions have been so far defeated by the perverseness and invincible  misunderstanding of the heretics, that that which was in itself meant  for the good of the oppressed English Catholics has been perverted to  their harm.\"    \"And thus, reverend sir,\" said Eustace, glad to get into his father's  good graces again, \"my father attaches blame, not to the Pope--Heaven  forbid!--but to the pravity of his enemies.\"    \"And it is for this very reason,\" said Campian, \"that we have brought  with us the present merciful explanation of the bull.\"    \"I'll tell you what, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Leigh, who, like other weak  men, grew in valor as his opponent seemed inclined to make peace, \"I  don't think the declaration was needed. After the new law of 1571 was  made, it was never put in force till Mayne and Trudgeon made fools of  themselves, and that was full six years. There were a few offenders,  they say, who were brought up and admonished, and let go; but even that  did not happen down here, and need not happen now, unless you put my son  here (for you shall never put me, I warrant you) upon some deed which  had better be left alone, and so bring us all to shame.\"    \"Your son, sir, if not openly vowed to God, has, I hope, a due sense  of that inward vocation which we have seen in him, and reverences his  spiritual fathers too well to listen to the temptations of his earthly  father.\"    \"What, sir, will you teach my son to disobey me?\"    \"Your son is ours also, sir. This is strange language in one who owes a  debt to the Church, which it was charitably fancied he meant to pay in  the person of his child.\"    These last words touched poor Mr. Leigh in a sore point, and breaking  all bounds, he swore roundly at Parsons, who stood foaming with rage.    \"A plague upon you, sir, and a black assizes for you, for you will come  to the gallows yet! Do you mean to taunt me in my own house with that  Hartland land? You had better go back and ask those who sent you where  the dispensation to hold the land is, which they promised to get me  years ago, and have gone on putting me off, till they have got my money,  and my son, and my conscience, and I vow before all the saints, seem now  to want my head over and above. God help me!\"--and the poor man's eyes  fairly filled with tears.    Now was Eustace's turn to be roused; for, after all, he was an  Englishman and a gentleman; and he said kindly enough, but firmly--    \"Courage, my dearest father. Remember that I am still your son, and not  a Jesuit yet; and whether I ever become one, I promise you, will depend  mainly on the treatment which you meet with at the hands of these  reverend gentlemen, for whom I, as having brought them hither, must  consider myself as surety to you.\"    If a powder-barrel had exploded in the Jesuits' faces, they could not  have been more amazed. Campian looked blank at Parsons, and Parsons at  Campian; till the stouter-hearted of the two, recovering his breath at  last--    \"Sir! do you know, sir, the curse pronounced on those who, after putting  their hand to the plough, look back?\"    Eustace was one of those impulsive men, with a lack of moral courage,  who dare raise the devil, but never dare fight him after he has been  raised; and he now tried to pass off his speech by winking and making  signs in the direction of his father, as much as to say that he was only  trying to quiet the old man's fears. But Campian was too frightened,  Parsons too angry, to take his hints: and he had to carry his part  through.    \"All I read is, Father Parsons, that such are not fit for the kingdom of  God; of which high honor I have for some time past felt myself unworthy.  I have much doubt just now as to my vocation; and in the meanwhile have  not forgotten that I am a citizen of a free country.\" And so saying, he  took his father's arm, and walked out.    His last words had hit the Jesuits hard. They had put the poor "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18613"],[0,"The Golden Scorpion (#17)"],[1,"it was Fate again!    \"Well, I suppose I am, sir,\" I said, and asked him where he wanted  to go.    He gave an address not five hundred yards from my own rooms! I thought  this so curious that I hesitated no longer.    \"Jump in,\" I said; and still seeking in my mind for a link between the  scorpion case and China, I drove off, and in less than half an hour,  for the streets were nearly empty, arrived at my destination.    The passenger, whose name was Dr. Keppel Stuart, very kindly suggested  a glass of hot grog, and I did not refuse his proferred hospitality.  When I came out of his house again, the rain had almost ceased, and  just as I stooped to crank the car I thought I saw a shadowy figure  moving near the end of a lane which led to the tradesmen's entrance of  Dr. Stuart's house. A sudden suspicion laid hold upon me--a horrible  doubt.    Having driven some twenty yards along the road, I leaned from my seat  and looked back. A big man wearing a black waterproof overall was  standing looking after me!    Remembering how cleverly I had been trailed from Miguel's cafe to my  flat, in Paris (for I no longer doubted that someone had followed me  on that occasion), I now perceived that I might again be the object of  the same expert's attention. Stopping my engine half-way along the  next road, I jumped out and ran back, hiding in the bushes which grew  beside the gate of a large empty house. I had only a few seconds to  wait.    A big closed car, running almost silently, passed before me ... and  \"Le Balafre\" was leaning out of the window!    At last I saw my chance of finding the headquarters of \"The Scorpion.\"  Alas! The man of the scar was as swift to recognize that possibility  as I. A moment after he had passed my stationary cab, and found it to  be deserted, his big car was off like the wind, and even before I  could step out from the bushes the roar of the powerful engine was  growing dim in the distance!    I was detected. I had to deal with dangerously clever people.          CHAPTER II    BAITING THE TRAP      The following morning I spent at home, in my modest rooms, reviewing  my position and endeavouring to adjust my plans in accordance with the  latest development. \"The Scorpion\" had scored a point. What had aroused  the suspicions \"Le Balafre,\" I knew not; but I was inclined to think  that he had been looking from some window or peep-hole in the narrow  street with the wooden houses when I had, injudiciously, followed him  there.    On the other hand, the leakage might be in Paris--or in my  correspondence system. The man of the scar might have been looking for  me as I was looking for him. That he was looking for someone on the  cross-channel boat I had not doubted.    He was aware, then that Charles Malet, cabman, was watching him. But  was he aware that Charles Malet was Gaston Max? And did he know where  I lived? Also--did he perchance think that my meeting with Dr. Stuart  in Limehouse had been prearranged? Clearly he had seen Dr. Stuart  enter my cab, for he had pursued us to Battersea.    This course of reflection presently led me to a plan. It was a  dangerous plan, but I doubted if I should ever find myself in greater  danger than I was already. _Nom d'un nom!_ I had not forgotten the  poor Jean Sach!    That night, well knowing that I carried my life in my hands, I drove  again to Limehouse Town Hall, and again leaving my cab outside went  into the bar where I had preciously me \"Le Balafre.\" If I had doubted  that my movements were watched I must now have had such doubts  dispelled; for two minutes later the man with the scar came in and  greeted me affably!    I had learned something else. He did not know that I had recognized  him as the person who had tracked me to Dr. Stuart's house!    He invited me to drink with him, and I did so. As we raised our  glasses I made a move. Looking all about me suspiciously:    \"Am I right in supposing that you have business in this part of  London?\" I asked.    \"Yes,\" he replied \"My affairs bring me here sometimes.\"    \"You are well acquainted with the neighbourhood?\"    \"Fairly well. But actually of course I am a stranger to London.\"    I tapped him confidentially upon the breast.    \"Take my advice, as a friend,\" I said, \"and visit these parts as  rarely as possible.\"    \"Why do you say that?\"    \"It is dangerous. From the friendly manner in which you entered into  conversation with me, I perceived that you were of a genial and  unsuspicious nature. Very well. I warn you. Last night I was followed  from a certain street not far from here to the house of a medical man  who is a specialist in certain kinds of criminology, you understand.\"    He stared at me very hard, his teeth bared by that fearful snarl. \"You  are a strange cabman.\"    \"Perhaps I am. No matter. Take my advice. I have things written  here\"--I tapped the breast of my tunic--\"which will astonish all the  world shortly. I tell you, my friend, my fortune is made.\"    I finished my drink and ordered another for myself and one for my  acquaintance. He was watching me doubtfully. Taking up my replenished  glass, I emptied it at a draught and ordered a third. I leaned over  towards the scarred man, resting my hand heavily upon his shoulder.    \"Five thousand pounds,\" I whispered thickly, \"has been offered for the  information which I have here in my pocket. It is not yet complete,  you understand, and because they may murder me before I obtain the  rest of the facts, do you know what I am going to do with this?\"    Again I tapped my tunic pocket. \"Le Balafre\" frowned perplexedly.    \"I don't even know what you are talking about, my friend,\" he replied.    \"_I_ know what I am talking about,\" I assured him, speaking more and  more huskily. \"Listen, then: I am going to take all my notes to my  friend, the doctor, and leave them with him, sealed--sealed, you  follow me? If I do not come back for them, In a week, shall we say?--he  sends them to the police. _I_ do not profit, you think? No._morbleu!_  but there are some who hang!\"    Emptying my third glass, I ordered a fourth and one for my companion.  He checked me.    \"No more for me, thank you,\" he said. \"I have--business to attend to.  I will wish you good-night.\"    \"Good-night!\" I cried boisterously--\"good-night, friend! take heed of  my good advice!\"    As he went out, the barman brought me my fourth glass of cognac, staring  at me doubtfully. Our conversation had been conducted in French, but  the tone of my voice had attracted attention.    \"Had about enough, ain't you, mate?\" he said. \"Your ugly pal jibbed!\"    \"Quite enough!\" I replied, in English now of course. \"But I've had a  stroke of luck to-night and I feel happy. Have one with me. This is a  final.\"    On going out into the street I looked cautiously about me, for I did  not expect to reach the house of Dr. Stuart unmolested. I credited  \"Le Balafre\" with sufficient acumen to distrust the genuineness of  my intoxication, even if he was unaware of my real identity. I never  make the mistake of underestimating an opponent's wit, and whilst  acting on the assumption that the scarred man knew me to be forcing  his hand, I recognized that whether he believed me to be drunk or  sober, Gaston Mas or another, his line of conduct must be the same.  He must take it for granted that I actually designed to lodge my notes  with Dr. Stuart and endeavour to prevent me doing so.    I could detect no evidence of surveillance whatever and cranking the  engine I mounted and drove off. More than once, as I passed along  Commercial Road, I stopped and looked back. But so far as I could  make out no one was following me. The greater part of my route lay  along populous thoroughfares, and of this I was not sorry; but I did  not relish the prospect of Thames Street, along which presently my  course led me.    Leaving the city behind me, I turned into that thoroughfare, which at  night is almost quite deserted, and there I pulled up. _Pardieu!_ I  was disappointed! It seemed as though my scheme had miscarried. It  could not understand why I had been permitted to go unmolested, and I  intended to walk back to the corner for a final survey before  continuing my journey. This survey was never made.    As I stopped the cab and prepared to descend, a faint--a very faint--  sound almost in my ear, set me keenly on the alert. Just in the nick  of time I ducked ... as the blade of a long knife flashed past my  head, ripping its way through my cloth cap!    Yes! That movement had saved my life, for otherwise the knife must  have entered my shoulder--and pierced to my heart!    Someone was hidden in the cab!    He had quietly opened one of the front windows and had awaited a  suitable opportunity to stab me. Now, recognizing failure, he leapt  out on the near side as I lurched and stumbled from my seat, and ran  off like the wind. I never so much as glimpsed him.    \"_Mon Dieu!_\" I muttered, raising my hand to my head, from which blood  was trickling down my face, \"the plan succeeds!\"    I bound a handkerchief as tightly as possible around the wound in my  scalp and put my cap on to keep the bandage in place. The wound was  only a superficial one, and except for the bleeding I suffered no  inconvenience from it. But I had now a legitimate reason for visiting  Dr. Stuart, and as I drove on towards Battersea I was modifying my  original plan in accordance with the unforeseen conditions.    It was long past Dr. Stuart's hours of consultation when I arrived at  his house, and the servant showed me into a waiting-room, informing me  that the doctor would join me in a few minutes. Directly she had gone  out I took from the pocket of my tunic the sealed envelope which I had  intended to lodge with the doctor. Pah! it was stained with blood  which had trickled down from the wound in my scalp!    Actually, you will say, there was no reason why I should place a  letter in the hand of Dr. Stuart; my"]]]
