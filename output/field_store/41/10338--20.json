The  hardships and privations they themselves undergo without murmuring, in  order to assist their husbands, brothers, and lovers, is worthy of being  chronicled in the pages of history, for they are the Spartans of the  nineteenth century. They are swift to help those who need help, but  unsparing with their scorn for those who are unworthy. The treatment meted  out to the grumbler and mischief-maker usually presents more of the  elements of comedy than anything else, and it is his own fault if he does  not get off lightly. But if he cuts up rough, tries to strike or kick his  drivers or tormentors, or if he goes in for a course of sulks, and flops  himself down, refusing to be driven, then the comic element disappears from  the scene. Out come the sjamboks, and he is treated precisely as a vicious  or sulky horse would be treated under similar circumstances. As a rule, it  does not take long to bring a man of that kind to his proper senses. Should  he talk of deserting or of avenging himself later on, he is watched, and a  deserter soon learns that a rifle bullet can travel faster than he can. As  for revenge, the sooner he forgets desires or designs of that kind the  better for his own health.    For minor offences, such as laziness, neglecting to keep the rifle clean  and in good shooting order, attempting to strike up a flirtation with a  married woman, to the annoyance of the lady, or any other little matter of  the kind, the wayward one is \"tossed.\" Tossing is not the sort of pastime  any fellow would choose for fun, not if he were the party to be tossed,  though it is a beanfeast for the onlookers. They manage it this way. A  hide, freshly stripped from a bullock, smoking, bloody, and limber as a  bowstring, is requisitioned; the hairy side is turned downwards, two strong  men get hold of each corner, cutting holes in the green hide for their  hands to have a good grip; they allow the hide to sag until it forms a sort  of cradle, into which the unlucky one is dumped neck and crop. Then the  signal is given, the hide sways to and fro for a few seconds, and then,  with a skilful jerk, it is drawn as taut as eight pairs of strong arms can  draw it. If the executioners are skilful at the business the victim shoots  upwards from the blood-smeared surface like a dude's hat in a gale of wind.  Sometimes he comes down on his feet, sometimes on his head, or he may  sprawl face downwards, clutching at the slimy surface as eagerly as a  politician clutches at a place in power. But his efforts are vain; a couple  more swings and another jerk, and up he goes, turning and twisting like a  soiled shirt on a wire fence. This time he comes down on his hands and  knees, and promptly commences to plead for pity, but before he can open his  heart a neat little jerk sends him out on his back, where he claws and  kicks like a jackal in a gin case, whilst the more ribald amongst the  onlookers sing songs appropriate to the occasion, but the more devout chant  some such hymn as this:                        Lord, let me linger here,                      For this is bliss.    A man is very seldom hurt at this game, though how he escapes without a  broken neck is one of the wonders of gravitation to me. One second you see  the poor beggar in mid air, going like a circular saw through soft pine.  Just when you are beginning to wonder if he has converted himself into a  catherine-wheel or a corkscrew, he straightens himself out horizontally,  remains poised for the millionth part of a second like a he-angel that has  moulted his wings; then down he dives perpendicularly like a tornado in  trousers, skinning forehead, nose, and chin as he kisses the drum-like  surface of the hide. No, on the whole, I do not consider it healthy to try  to fool with a married woman in a Boer fighting laager, apart altogether  from the moral aspect of the affair. If some of the amorous dandies I wot  of, who claim kindred with us, got the same sort of treatment in Old  England, many a merry matron would be saved much annoyance.    For rank disobedience of orders, brutality of conduct, cowardice in the  face of the enemy, flagrant neglect of the wounded, or any other very  serious military crime, the punishment is sjamboking, which is simply  flogging, as it existed in our Army and Navy not so many years ago. On  board ship they used to use the \"cat,\" a genteel instrument with a handle  attached. The Boer sjambok is a different article altogether; it has not  nine tails, but it gets there just the same. The sjambok dear to the Boer  soul is that made out of rhinoceros hide. It is a plain piece of hide, not  twisted in any way; just clean cut out and trimmed round all the way down.  It is about three feet long, and at the end which the flogger holds it is  about two and a half inches in circumference, tapering down gradually to a  rat-tail point. It is a terrible weapon when the person who wields it is  bent on business, and is not manufacturing poetry or mingling thoughts of  home and mother with the flogging. Truth to tell, I don't think they do  much flogging--not half as much as they are credited with--but when they do  flog, the party who gets it wants a soft shirt for a month after, and it's  quite a while before he will lie on his back for the mere pleasure of  seeing the moon rise.                                       BATTLE OF CONSTANTIA FARM.                                                                    THABA NCHU.      The Battle of Constantia Farm will not rank as one of the big events of  this war, but it is worthy of a full description, because in this battle  the Briton for the first time laid himself out from start to finish to  fight the Boer pretty much on his own lines, instead of following  time-honoured British rules of war. Before attempting to portray the actual  fighting, I think a brief sketch of our movements from the time we left the  railway line to cross the country will be of interest to those readers of  _The Daily News_ who desire to follow the progress of the war with due  care.    The Third Division, which had been at Stormberg, and had done such  excellent, though almost bloodless, work by sweeping the country between  the last-named place and Bethany, rested at the latter place, and built up  its full strength by incorporating a large number of men and guns. General  Gatacre, who had retrieved his reverse at Stormberg by forcing Commandant  Olivier to vacate his almost impregnable position without striking a blow,  and later by his masterly move in swooping down on Bethulie Bridge and  preventing the Boers from wrecking the line of communication between Lord  Roberts and his supplies from Capetown, only remained long enough with his  old command to see them equipped in a manner fit to take the field, and  then retired in favour of General Chermside. It was under this officer that  we marched away from the railway line across country known to be hostile to  us. Almost due east we moved to Reddersburg, about twelve and a half miles.  We had to move slowly and cautiously, because no living man can tell when,  where, or how a Boer force will attack. They follow rules of their own, and  laugh at all accepted theories of war, ancient or modern, and no general  can afford to hold them cheap. A day and a half was spent at Reddersburg,  and then the Third Division continued its eastward course in wretched  weather, until Rosendal was arrived at. This is the spot where the Royal  Irish Rifles and Northumberland Fusiliers had to surrender to the Boers. We  had to camp there for the best part of three days on account of the  continuous downpour of rain, which rendered the veldt tracks impassable for  our transport. To push onward meant the absolute destruction of mules and  oxen, and the consequent loss of food supplies, without which we were  helpless, for in that country every man's hand was against us, not only in  regard to actual warfare, but in regard to forage for man and beast.    Here we were joined by General Rundle with the Eighth Division, which  brought our force up to about thirteen thousand men, thirty big guns, and a  number of Maxims. When the weather cleared slightly we moved onward slowly,  the ground simply clinging to the wheels of the heavily laden waggons,  until it seemed as if the very earth, as well as all that was on top of it,  was opposed to our march. Our scouts constantly saw the enemy hovering on  our front and flanks, and more than once exchanged shots with them. General  Rundle, who was in supreme command, thus knew that he could not hope to  surprise the wily foe, for it was evident to the merest tyro that the Boer  leader was keeping a sharp eye upon our movements, and would not be taken  at a disadvantage. We expected to measure the enemy's fighting force at any  hour, but it was not until about half-past ten on the morning of Friday,  the 20th of April, that we were certain that he meant to measure his arms  with ours, though early on that morning our scouts had brought in news that  a commando, believed to be about two thousand five hundred strong, with  half a dozen guns, commanded by General De Wet, was strongly posted right  on our line of march. Slowly we crept across the open veldt, our men  stretching from east to west for fully six miles. There was no moving of  solid masses of men, no solid grouping of troops; no two men marched  shoulder to shoulder, a gap showed plainly between each of the khaki-clad  figures as we moved on to the rugged, broken line of kopjes. There was no  hurry, no bustle, the men behaved admirably, each individual soldier  seeming to have his wits about him, and proving it by taking advantage of  every bit of cover that came in his way. If they halted near an ant-hill,  they at once put it between themselves and the enemy.    Slowly but steadily they rolled onward, like a great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16140"],[0,"The Curious Book of Birds (#17)"],[1,".    Then Coora fell to weeping most sorely, for she knew that she could not  trust the word of her father and mother; and that is a most terrible  thing. At last she rose and wiped away the tears and looked about the  little cottage where she had been patient through so many  disappointments. And she said to herself, \"I can bear it no longer. It  is not right that I should be made to suffer like this when a little  thing would make me so happy. I must see the rice field; I will go  to-day.\"    Coora tidied the cottage, putting everything in its place and making it  look as beautiful as she could. Then she took up the little sister who  had fallen asleep on the floor, and kissing her tenderly placed her in  the hammock which swung from wall to wall of the hut. Lastly Coora took  off the golden bracelets and earrings and the tinkling anklets which she  wore like other little Malay girls, and left them in a shining heap  behind the door. But she kept her necklace about her pretty little neck.    Now Coora had learned a little magic from a witch, just enough magic to  serve her turn. She went out and picked two palm leaves which she  fastened on her shoulders and changed herself into a bird, a bright,  beautiful Ground-Pigeon, with many-colored metallic feathers. But the  necklace still made a band about her pretty little neck, as you may see  on every Ground-Pigeon to this day.    Coora the Ground-Pigeon fluttered away through the forest until she came  to the rice plantation where her parents were at work. She alighted on a  dead tree close by them and called out, \"Mother, O Mother! I have left  my earrings and bracelets behind the door and have put my little sister  in the hammock.\"    Astonished at these words her mother looked up, but saw no one, only a  Ground-Pigeon perched on the tree over her head. \"Father,\" she cried to  her husband who was at work beside her, \"did you not hear Coora's voice  just now?\"    \"Yes, I thought so,\" answered the father angrily. \"The wicked girl must  have disobeyed me and have followed us here after all. I will punish her  if this is so.\" They called to her, \"Coora, Coora!\" until the forest  reechoed. But no one appeared or answered.    \"I will go home and see if she is there,\" said the mother. \"Either I  heard Coora speak or there is some magic in the forest.\" And she  hastened back to the cottage. There she found the baby in the hammock  and the bracelets and earrings in a shining heap behind the door, as the  voice had said, but there was no Coora anywhere. Surprised and anxious,  once more the mother ran back to the plantation.    \"Coora is gone, husband!\" she cried. \"It must have been her own voice  which we heard just now. Hark! She speaks again!\"    Again from the tree they heard a sweet voice calling, \"Mother, O Mother,  I have left my earrings and bracelets behind the door and my little  sister in the hammock. Good-by, Coo-o-o-ra!\" As she spoke her own name  Coora's voice warbled and crooned into the soft _coo_ of a  Ground-Pigeon's note, and her parents glancing up saw that this bird  must be their child, their Coora, magically changed.    \"Let us cut down the tree and catch the wicked girl!\" cried the father.  And seizing his axe he chopped away lustily until the tree fell with a  crash. But even at that moment the Pigeon fluttered away to another  tree, crooning again the soft syllables which she has spoken ever since,  \"Coo-ra, coo-ra, coo!\"    From tree to tree about the rice plantation the distracted parents  pursued the Pigeon; but it was in vain to try to capture her. Ever she  escaped them when they seemed about to lay hands upon her soft feathers.  After following her flight for many miles they were obliged to return  home, sad and sorry and repentant. For they knew now that it was their  own unkindness and their broken promises which had driven their daughter  away from the cottage, never to return.    The beautiful Ground-Pigeon still lingers near the rice plantations  which she had so longed to visit. Still she plaintively calls her name,  and still she wears the necklace about her pretty little neck. And the  little Malay maidens love her very dearly because she was once a girl  like them.          SISTER HEN AND THE CROCODILE      The Crocodile is one of the hungriest bodies that ever lived. When he is  looking for a dinner he will eat almost anything that comes within  reach. Sometimes the greedy fellow swallows great stones and chunks of  wood, in his hurry mistaking them for something more digestible. And  when he is smacking his great jaws over his food he makes such a greedy,  terrible noise that the other animals steal away nervously and hide  until it shall be Master Crocodile's sleepy-time. He is too lazy to  waddle in search of a dinner far from the river where he lives. But any  animal or even a man-swimmer had best be careful how he ventures into  the water near the Crocodile's haunts. For what seems to be a  greenish-brown, knobby log of wood floating on the water, has little  bright eyes which are on the lookout for anything which moves. And below  the water two great jaws are ready to open and swallow in the prey of  Mr. Hungry-Mouth.    But no matter how hungry the Crocodile may be, he will not touch the  Hen, even if she should venture into his very jaws; at least, that is  what the Black Men of the Congo River will tell you. And surely, as they  are the nearest neighbors of the big reptile they ought to know if any  one does. Now this is the story which they tell to explain why the  Crocodile will not eat the Hen.    Once upon a time there was a Hen, a common, plump, clucky mother Hen,  who used every day to go down to the river and pick up bits of food on  the moist banks, where luscious insects were many. She did not know that  this Congo River was the home of the Crocodile, the biggest, fiercest,  scaliest, hungriest Crocodile in all Africa. But one day when she went  down to the water as usual she hopped out onto what looked like a mossy  log, saying to herself:--    \"Aha! This is a fine old timber-house. It is full of juicy bugs, I know.  I shall have a great feast!\"    Tap-tap! Pick-pick! The Hen began to scratch and peck upon the rough  bark of the log, but Oh dear me! suddenly she began to feel very  seasick. The log was rolling over! The log was teetering up on end like  a boat in a storm! And before she knew what was really happening the  poor Hen found herself floundering in the water in the very jaws of the  terrible Crocodile.    \"Ha, ha!\" cried the Crocodile in his harsh voice. \"You took me for a  log, just as the other silly creatures do. But I am no log, Mrs. Hen, as  you shall soon see. I am Hungry Crocodile, and you will make the fifth  dinner which I have had this evening.\"    The Hen was frightened almost to death, but she kept her presence of  mind and gasped frantically as she saw the great jaws opening to swallow  her:--    \"O _Brother_, don't!\"    Now the Crocodile was so surprised at hearing the Hen call him Brother  that he kept his jaws wide open and forgot to swallow his dinner. He  kept them open for some time, gaping foolishly, wondering what the Hen  could mean, and how he could possibly be her brother. And by the time he  had remembered how hungry he was, there was nothing for him to eat. For  the Hen had skipped away just as fast as her feet would take her.    \"Pouf!\" snorted the Crocodile. \"Her brother, indeed! I am not her  brother, and she knows it very well. What a fool I was to be caught by  such a word! Just wait till I catch her again and we will see. I will  _brother_ her!\" And he swam sulkily away to hide his mortification in  the Congo mud, with only the end of his long nose poking out as a  ventilator for his breathing.    Now, though the Hen had had so narrow an escape, it had not sufficiently  taught her a lesson. A few days afterwards once more she went down to  the river, for she could not resist the temptation of the bug-dinner  which she knew she should find there. But she kept her eyes open sharply  for any greeny log which might be floating on the water, saying to  herself, \"Old Hungry-Mouth shall not catch me napping this time. I know  his wicked tricks!\"    But this time the Crocodile was not floating on the water like a greeny  log. He was lying still as still, sunning himself on the river bank  behind some tall reeds. Mrs. Hen came trotting down to the water, a  plump and tempting sight, cocking her head knowingly on one side as she  spied a real log floating out beyond, which she took to be her enemy.  And as she scratched in the soft mud, chuckling to think how sly she  was, with a rush and a rustle down pounced the Crocodile upon her, and  once more, before she knew it, she found herself in the horrid gateway  of his jaws, threatened by the double rows of long, white teeth.    [Illustration: \"_O Brother, don't!_\"]    \"Oho!\" snapped the Crocodile. \"You shall not escape me this time. I  am a log, am I? Look at me again, Mrs. Hen. Am I a log?\" And he came at  her to swallow her at once.    But again the Hen squawked, \"O _Brother_, don't!\"    Again the Crocodile paused, thunderstruck by this extraordinary word.  \"Oh, bother the Hen!\" he cried, \"what can she mean, really? How can I be  her brother? She lives in a town on the land, and I live in my kingdom  of mud and water. How could two creatures possibly be more unlike?  How\"--but while he had been thinking of these hows, once more the Hen  had managed to escape, and was pelting back to her barnyard as fast as  she could go.    Then indeed the Crocodile was angry. He determined to go and see Nzambi,  the wise witch princess, about the matter. She would tell him what it  all meant. But it was a long journey to her palace and he was awkward  and slow in traveling upon land. Before he had gone very far he was  tired and out of breath, and stopped to rest under a banana tree.    As he lay panting in the shade he saw his friend"]]]
