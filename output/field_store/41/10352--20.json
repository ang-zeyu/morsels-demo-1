Alban's Hall in Oxford, 1601, where, though he was  encouraged in his studies (says Mr. Wood) by the earl of Pembroke, yet  he applied his mind more to poetry and romances, than to logic and  philosophy. He afterwards quitted the university without a degree, and  being impatient to move in a public sphere, he came to London, in  order to improve his poetic fancy, and polite studies by conversation,  and reading the world. He soon applied himself to the stage, and wrote  several tragedies and comedies with applause, which were admired for  the purity of their stile, and the oeconomy of their plots: he was  held in the highest esteem by the poets of that age, and there were  few who did not reckon it an honour to write in conjunction with him,  as Fletcher, Middleton, Rowley, Field and Decker did[2]. He is said to  have been a man of great modesty. He died suddenly at his house on the  bank side in Southwark, near to the then playhouse, for he went to bed  well, and was dead before morning. His body was interred in St.  Saviour's church-yard, and was attended to the grave by all the  comedians then in town, on the 18th of March, 1669. Sir Aston  Cokain[e] has an epitaph on Mr. John Fletcher, and Mr. Philip  Massinger, who, as he says, both lie buried in one grave. He prepared  several works for the public, and wrote a little book against  Scaliger, which many have ascribed to Scioppius, the supposed author  of which Scaliger, uses with great contempt. Our author has published  14 plays of his own writing, besides those in which he joined with  other poets, of which the following is the list,    1. The Bashful Lover, a Tragi-Comedy, often acted at a private house  in Black Fryars, by his Majesty's Servants, with success, printed in  8vo. 1655.    2. The Bondman, an ancient Story, often acted at the Cockpit in Drury  Lane, by the Lady Elizabeth's servants, printed in 4to. London, 1638,  and dedicated to Philip, Earl of Montgomery.    3. The City Madam, a Comedy, acted at a private house in Black-fryars,  with applause, 4to. 1659, for Andrew Pennywick one of the actors, and  dedicated by him to Anne, Countess of Oxford.    4. The Duke of Milan, a Tragedy printed in 4to. but Mr. Langbaine has  not been able to find out when it was acted.    5. The Emperor of the East, a Tragi-Comedy, acted at the Black Fryars,  and Globe Playhouse, by his Majesty's Servants, printed in 4to.  London, 1632, and dedicated to John, Lord Mohune, Baron of Okehampton;  this play is founded on the History of Theodosius the younger; see  Socrates, lib. vii.    6. The Fatal Dowry, a Tragedy, often acted at private house in Black  Fryars, by his Majesty's servants, printed in 4to. London, 1632; this  play was written by our author, in conjunction with Nathaniel Field.  The behaviour of Charlois in voluntarily chusing imprisonment to  ransom his father's corpse, that it might receive the funeral rites,  is copied from the Athenian Cymon, so much celebrated by Valerius  Maximus, lib. v. c. 4. ex. 9. Plutarch and Cornelius Nepos,  notwithstanding, make it a forced action, and not voluntary.    7. The Guardian, a comical History, often acted at a private house in  Black Fryars, by the King's Servants, 1665. Severino's cutting off  Calipso's nose in the dark, taking her for his wife Jolantre, is  borrowed from the Cimerian Matron, a Romance, 8vo. the like story is  related in Boccace. Day 8. Novel 7.    7 [sic]. The Great Duke of Florence, a comical History, often  presented with success, at the Phaenix in Drury Lane, 1636; this play  is taken from our English Chronicles, that have been written in the  reign of Edgar.    9. The Maid of Honour, a Tragi-Comedy, often acted at the Phaenix in  Drury Lane, 1632.    10. A New Way to pay Old Debts, a Comedy, acted 1633; this play met  with great success on its first representation, and has been revived  by Mr. Garrick, and acted on the Theatre-Royal in Drury Lane, 1750.    11. Old Law, a New Way to please You, an excellent Comedy, acted  before the King and Queen in Salisbury-house, printed in 4to. London,  1656. In this play our author was assisted by Mr. Middleton, and Mr.  Rowley.    12. The Picture, a Tragi-Comedy, often presented at the Globe and  Black Fryars Playhouse, by the King's servants, printed in London,  1636, and dedicated to his selected friends, the noble Society of the  Inner-Temple; this play was performed by the most celebrated actors of  that age, Lowin, Taylor, Benfield.    13. The Renegado, a Tragi-Comedy, often acted by the Queen's Servants,  at the private Playhouse in Drury Lane, printed in 4to. London, 1630.    14. The Roman Actor, performed several times with success, at a  private house in the Black-Fryars, by the King's Servants; for the  plot read Suetonius in the Life of Domitian, Aurelius Victor,  Eutropius, lib. vii. Tacitus, lib. xiii.    15. Very Woman, or the Prince of Tarent, a Tragi-Comedy, often acted  at a private house in Black Fryars, printed 1655.    16. The Virgin Martyr, a Tragedy, acted by his Majesty's Servants,  with great applause, London, printed in 4to. 1661. In this play our  author took in Mr. Thomas Decker for a partner; the story may be met  with in the Martyrologies, which have treated of the tenth persecution  in the time of Dioclesian, and Maximian.    17. The Unnatural Combat, a Tragedy, presented by the King's Servants  at the Globe, printed at London 1639. This old Tragedy, as the author  tells his patron, has neither Prologue nor Epilogue, \"it being  composed at a time, when such by-ornaments were not advanced above the  fabric of the whole work.\"    Footnotes:  1.

This gentleman was the third son of Richard Stapleton, esq; of  Carleton, in Mereland in Yorkshire, and was educated a Roman Catholic,  in the college of the English Benedictines, at Doway in Flanders, but  being born with a poetical turn, and consequently too volatile to be  confined within the walls of a cloister, he threw off the restraint of  his education, quitted a recluse life, came over to England, and  commenced Protestant[1]. Sir Robert having good interest, found the  change of religion prepared the way to preferment; he was made  gentleman usher of the privy chamber to King Charles II. then Prince  of Wales; we find him afterwards adhering to the interest of his Royal  Master, for when his Majesty was driven out of London, by the  threatnings and tumults of the discontented rabble, he followed him,  and on the 13th of September, 1642, he received the honour of  knighthood. After the battle of Edgehill, when his Majesty was obliged  to retire to Oxford, our author then attended him, and was created Dr.  of the civil laws. When the Royal cause declined, Stapleton thought  proper to addict himself to study, and to live quietly under a  government, no effort of his could overturn, and as he was not amongst  the most conspicuous of the Royalists, he was suffered to enjoy his  solitude unmolested. At the restoration he was again promoted in the  service of King Charles II. and held a place in that monarch's esteem  'till his death. Langbaine, speaking of this gentleman, gives him a  very great character; his writings, says he, have made him not only  known, but admired throughout all England, and while Musaeus and  Juvenal are in esteem with the learned, Sir Robert's fame will still  survive, the translation of these two authors having placed his name  in the temple of Immortality. As to Musaeus, he had so great a value  for him, that after he had translated him, he reduced the story into a  dramatic poem, called Hero and Leander, a Tragedy, printed in 4to.  1669, and addressed to the Duchess of Monmouth. Whether this play was  ever acted is uncertain, though the Prologue and Epilogue seem to  imply that it appeared on the stage.    Besides these translations and this tragedy, our author has written    The slighted Maid, a Comedy, acted at the Theatre in Little  Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, by the Duke of York's Servants, printed in  London 1663, and dedicated to the Duke of Monmouth.

Our author paid the last  debt to nature on the eleventh day of July, 1669, and was buried in  the Abbey of St. Peter at Westminster. He was uncle to Dr. Miles  Stapleton of Yorkshire, younger brother to Dr. Stapleton, a  Benedictine Monk, who was president of the English Benedictines at  Delaware in Lorraine, where he died, 1680.

This poet was born at Hatherleigh, in the Reign of King James I. He  was a man of reputation, as well for his natural parts, as his  acquired accomplishments. He received his education at Westminster  school, where he continued 'till he was removed to Christ Church,  Oxon, and in the year 1624 admitted student. He made some figure at  the university, in the study of arts and sciences, and was sollicited  by men of eminence, who esteemed him for his abilities, to enter into  holy orders; this he was not long in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16494"],[0,"The Transvaal from Within: A Private Record of Public Affairs (#17)"],[1,"-cornets were barely able to write; they had no 'offices,' and  would accept taxes and registrations at any time and in any place.  The chances of correct entry were therefore remote. The result of  this is very serious. The records are either 'lost' when they might  prove embarrassing, or so incorrectly or imperfectly kept as to be of  no use whatever; and settlers in the Transvaal from 1882 to 1890 are  in most cases unable to prove their registration as the law requires,  and this through no fault of their own.    In the country districts justice was not a commodity intended for the  Britisher. Many cases of gross abuse, and several of actual murder  occurred; and in 1885 the case of Mr. Jas. Donaldson, then residing  on a farm in Lydenburg--lately one of the Reform prisoners--was  mentioned in the House of Commons, and became the subject of a demand  by the Imperial Government for reparation and punishment. He had been  ordered by two Boers (one of whom was in the habit of boasting that  he had shot an unarmed Englishman in Lydenburg since the war, and  would shoot others) to abstain from collecting hut taxes on his own  farm; and on refusing had been attacked by them. After beating them  off single-handed, he was later on again attacked by his former  assailants, reinforced by three others. They bound him with reims  (thongs), kicked and beat him with sjamboks (raw-hide whips) and  clubs, stoned him, and left him unconscious and so disfigured that he  was thought to be dead when found some hours later. On receipt of the  Imperial Government's representations, the men were arrested, tried  and fined. The fines were stated to have been remitted at once by  Government, but in the civil action which followed Mr. Donaldson  obtained L500 damages. The incident had a distinctly beneficial  effect, and nothing more was heard of the maltreatment of defenceless  men simply because they were Britishers. Moreover, with the  improvement in trade which followed the gold discoveries of 1885  and 1886 at Moodies and Barberton, the relations between the two  races also improved. Frequent intercourse and commercial relations  begot a better knowledge of each other, and the fierce hatred of the  Britisher began to disappear in the neighbourhood of the towns and  the goldfields.    In 1886 the wonderful richness of the Sheba Mine in Barberton  attracted a good deal of attention, and drew a large number of  persons--prospectors, speculators, traders, etc.--to the Transvaal.  Before the end of 1887 ten or twelve thousand must have poured into  the country. The effect was magical. The revenue which had already  increased by 50 per cent. in 1886, doubled itself in 1887, and then  there came unto the Boer Government that which they had least  expected--ample means to pursue their greater ambitions. But unmixed  good comes to few, and with the blessings of plenty came the cares of  Government, the problem of dealing with people whose habits,  thoughts, ambitions, methods, language, and logic differed utterly  from their own. Father Abraham on the London Stock Exchange would not  be much more 'at sea' than the peasant farmers of the Volksraad were  in dealing with the requirements of the new settlers.    Agitations for reforms commenced early in Barberton. At first it was  only roads and bridges that were wanted, or the remission of certain  taxes, or security of title for stands and claims. Later on a  political association named the Transvaal Republican Union was formed  in Barberton, having a constitution and programme much the same as  those of the Transvaal National Union, formed some five years later  in Johannesburg. The work of this body was looked on with much  disfavour by the Government, and it was intimated to some of the  prominent members that if they did not cease to concern themselves  with politics they would suffer in their business relations, and  might even be called upon to leave the country. Many reforms were  specified as desirable, and the franchise question was raised, with  the object of getting the Government to make some reasonable  provision in lieu of the registration clause, which was found in most  cases to be an absolute bar.    The discovery of the Witwatersrand conglomerate formation soon  helped to swell the flowing tide of prosperity. In the middle of  1887 the regular output of gold commenced, and the fields have never  'looked back' since. Johannesburg--named after Mr. Johannes Rissik,  the Surveyor-General of the Transvaal--was soon a far greater problem  than Barberton had been. The shareholders in the mines soon found it  necessary to have some organization to protect their interests and  give unison to their policy, and to preserve the records and collect  information for the industry. The Witwatersrand Chamber of Mines was  then formed, a voluntary business association of unique interest and  efficiency. The organization includes all the representative and  influential men, and every company of any consequence connected with  the mining industry; and it has, through its committee and officials,  for eight years represented to the Volksraad the existence of abuses  and grievances, the remedies that are required, and the measures  which are felt to be necessary or conducive to the progress of the  industry in particular, or the welfare of the State in general. The  President, Executive and Volksraad, by neglect of their obvious  duties, by their ignorance of ordinary public affairs, by their  wilful disregard of the requirements of the Uitlanders, have given  cohesion to a people about as heterogeneous as any community under  the sun, and have trained them to act and to care for themselves. The  refusal year after year to give a charter of incorporation to the  Chamber, on the grounds that it would be creating an _imperium in  imperio_, and the comments of Volksraad members on the petition, have  made it clear that the Government view the Chamber with no friendly  eye. The facts that in order to get a workable pass law at all the  Chamber had to prepare it in every detail, together with plans for  the creation and working of a Government department; and that in  order to diminish the litigation under the gold law, and to make that  fearful and wonderful agglomeration of erratic, experimental, crude,  involved, contradictory and truly incomprehensible enactments at all  understandable, the Chamber had to codify it at its own expense and  on its own initiative, illustrate both the indispensable character of  the organization, and the ignorance and ineptitude of the Government.    The records of the Volksraad for the last ten years may be searched  in vain for any measure calculated constructively to advance the  country, or to better the conditions of the workers in it, with the  few--very few--exceptions of those proposed by the Chamber of Mines.  The country has, in fact, run the Government, and the Government has  been unable to ruin it.    Shortly after the discovery of the Rand conglomerates, it became  clear that a railway would have to be built between the coalfields  and the mines--some forty miles. But it was a fixed principle of the  Boers that no railways (with the exception of the Delagoa Bay line,  which, as the means of diverting trade from British channels, was  regarded as a necessary evil) should be built, since they could  compete successfully with the ox-waggon, and thus deprive the 'poor  burgher' of his legitimate trade spoil; and great difficulty was  experienced in getting the consent of the Raad. As a matter of fact,  the permission to build it was only obtained by subterfuge; for it  was explained to the worthy law-makers that it was not a railway at  all--only a _steam tram_. And the Rand Steam Tram it is called to  this day.    The Delagoa Railway--the darling scheme of Presidents Burgers and  Kruger in turn--was taken seriously in hand as soon as it was  possible to raise money on almost any terms. The concession for all  railways in the State was granted on April 16, 1884, to a group of  Hollander and German capitalists, and confirmed by the Volksraad on  August 23 following. The President's excuse for granting and  preserving this iniquitous bond on the prosperity of the State is,  that when the country was poor and its credit bad, friends in Holland  came forward and generously helped it, and this must not be forgotten  to them. As a matter of fact, friends accepted the concession when  the State was poor and its credit bad, but did nothing until the  State's credit improved to such an extent as to be mortgageable.  _Then_ the friends granted certain favourable terms under their  concession to other friends, who built the first section of the line  at preposterous rates, and repaid themselves out of moneys raised on  the State's credit.    A well-known South African politician, distinguished alike for his  ability and integrity, who visited the Transvaal during the progress  of the reformers' trial, and was anxious in the interests of all  South Africa to find a solution of the differences, put the position  thus to some of the leading men of the Rand: 'You can see for  yourselves that this is no time to ask for the franchise; for the  time being, Jameson's invasion has made such a suggestion impossible.  Now, tell me in a word, Is there any one thing that you require more  than anything else, which we can help you to get?' The answer was:  'The one thing which we must have--not for its own sake, but for the  security it offers for obtaining and retaining other reforms--_is_  the franchise. No promise of reform, no reform itself, will be worth  an hour's purchase unless we have the status of voters to make our  influence felt. But, if you want the chief economic grievances, they  are: the Netherlands Railway Concession, the dynamite monopoly, the  liquor traffic, and native labour, which, together, constitute an  unwarrantable burden of indirect taxation on"]]]
