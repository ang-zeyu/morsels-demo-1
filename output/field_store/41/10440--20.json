A GUIDE FOR THE IDENTIFICATION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF AGARICS,  COMPRISED IN FOUR TABLES, ARRANGED WITH REFERENCE TO THE COLORS  OF THE SPORES, VIZ.:      Table I.   White spores.  Table II.  Red and pink spores.  Table III. Ochraceous spores.  Table IV.  Dark purple and black spores.    NOTE.    In using this table the student should first ascertain the color of the  spores of the specimen under investigation. This will determine the  particular table to be applied to its further examination. If, for  instance, he finds its spores to be white, he will know that Table I.  is the one to be consulted. Turning to that table, he should recall the  place of its growth, its habitat. Now, suppose it to have been found  growing on a stump, he will, by looking at the first column, Habitat,  of Table I., be informed that it must be one of the four genera named  in the column with the heading \"On Stumps.\" Let him then examine its  \"gills.\" If he finds them to be \"adnate,\" he will be assured that it  must be an \"Armillaria,\" as no other genus is shown in the column as  growing \"on stumps\" and which has gills that are adnate. But to make  assurance doubly sure, he may proceed further to discover whether the  specimen has also the ring called for in column headed \"Ring.\" If it  has, and was found growing in the summer, he may feel quite safe in  classifying it as Armillaria. Sometimes the same genus will be found in  more than one column. This ought not to mislead or confuse the beginner.  In Table I., column headed \"Volva,\" Amanita is mentioned, and also in  the column headed \"Ring,\" but this indicates that an Amanita has both  the Volva (the universal veil) and the Ring. So in the columns headed by  \"Stem,\" Pleurotus is represented as having a lateral or eccentric stem,  and also as having no stem. The meaning is, that some species of the  genus have no stem, while there are others in which the stem is lateral  or eccentric.      [Transcriber's Note:    In this e-text, empty categories have been omitted from each table.    Variations in spelling and phrasing are as in the original. The    complete structure, with all options included, would be:        Size of plants, small.      Plants deliquescent.      Time of growth,        summer.        autumn.

And I tell  you\"--in his earnestness the merman laid his hand once more on  Dalgard's arm--\"to turn back now is out of the question. The death  which haunts the darkness is still sniffing out our trail.\"    Dalgard glanced involuntarily over his shoulder. By the faint and  limited light of the purple disks he could see little or nothing. An  army might creep there undetected.    \"But--\" His protest was in answer to the merman's seeming unconcern.    Sssuri at the first intimation that the hunters were behind them had  shown wariness. Now he did not appear to care.    \"They had fed,\" he replied. \"Scouts follow because we are something  new and thus suspect. When hunger rises once more in them, and their  scouts report that we are meat, then is the time to draw knives and  prepare for battle. But before that hour we may have won free. Let us  search for the gate we now need.\"    However confident the merman might be, Dalgard could not match that  confidence. In the open air he would have faced a snake-devil four  times his size without any more emotion than a hunter's instinctive  caution. But here in the dark, unable to rid himself of the belief  that thousands of tons of sea water hung over his head, he found  himself starting at any sound, his knife bare and ready in his  sweating hand.    He noted that Sssuri had stepped up the pace, passing into his  sure-footed glide which made Dalgard exert himself to keep up. Before  them the corridor stretched without a break. The merman's promised  exit, if it existed, was still out of sight.    It was difficult to gauge time in this dark hall, but Dalgard thought  that they were at least an hour farther on their way when Sssuri  paused abruptly once more, his head cocked in a listening attitude, as  if he caught some whisper of sound too rarefied for his human  companion.    \"Now--\" the thought hissed as if he spat the words, \"they hunger--and  they hunt!\"    He bounded forward with a spurt, which Dalgard copied, and they ran  lightly, the dust undisturbed in years puffing up beneath the merman's  bare, scaled feet and Dalgard's hide boots. Still the unbroken walls,  the feeble patches of violet in the ceiling. But no exit. And what  good would any exit do him, Dalgard thought, if it opened under the  sea?    \"There are islands off the coast--many islands--\" Sssuri caught him  up. \"It is in my mind that we shall find our door on one of those.  But--run now, knife brother, for those at our heels awake and thirst  for flesh and blood. They have decided that we are not to be feared  but may be run down for their pleasure.\"    Dalgard weighed his knife in his hand. \"They shall find us with  fangs,\" he promised grimly.    \"It will be better if they do not find us at all,\" returned Sssuri.    A burning arch of pain encased Dalgard's lower ribs, and his breath  came in gusts of hastily sucked air as their flight kept on, down the  endless corridor. Sssuri was also showing signs of the grueling pace,  his round head bent forward, his furred legs pumping as if only his  iron will kept them moving. And the determination which kept him going  was communicated to the scout as a graver warning than any thought  message of fear.    They were passing under one of the infrequent violet lights when  Dalgard got something else--a mental thrust so quick and sharp it was  as if a sword had cut through the daze of fatigue to reach his brain.  Yet that had not come from Sssuri, for it was totally alien, wavering  on a band so near the extreme edge of his consciousness that it  pricked, receded, and pricked again as a needle might.    This was no message of fear or warning, but of implacable stubbornness  and ravening hunger. And in that instant Dalgard knew that it came  from what was sniffing out their trail, and he no longer wondered that  the hunters were immune to other mental contact. One could not reason  with--that!    He spurted forward, matching the merman's acceleration of speed. But  to Dalgard's horror he saw that his companion now ran with one hand  brushing along the wall, as if he needed that support.    \"Sssuri!\"    His thought met a wall of concentration through which he could not  break. In a way he was reassured--for a moment, until another of those  stabs from their pursuers struck him. He longed to look back, to see  what hunted them. But he dared not break stride to do that.    \"Ahhhh!\" The welcoming cry from Sssuri brought his attention back to  his companion as the merman broke into a wild run.    Dalgard summoned up his last rags of energy and coursed after him.  Sssuri had halted before a dark lump which protruded from the side of  the corridor.    \"A sea lock!\" Sssuri's claws were clicking over the surface of the  hatch, seeking the secret of its latch.    Panting, Dalgard leaned against the opposite wall. Just as a protest  formed in his mind he heard something else, the pad of feet, many  feet, echoing down the corridor. And somehow he was able now to look.    Round spots of light, dull, greenish, close to the ground, as if  someone had flung a handful of phosphorescence into the dark. But this  was no phosphorescence! Eyes! Eyes--he tried to count and knew it was  impossible to so reckon the number of the pack that ran mute but  ready. Nor could he distinguish more than a very shadowy glimpse of  forms which glided close to the ground with an unpleasant sinuosity.    \"Ahhhhh!\" Again Sssuri's paean of triumph.    There was the grate of unwilling metal forced to move, a puff of air  redolent with the sea striking their bodies in chill threat, the  brightness of violet light stepped up to a point far beyond the lamps  in the corridor.    With it came no rush of drowning water as Dalgard had half expected,  and when the merman clambered through the hatch he prepared to follow,  well aware that the eyes, and the pattering feet which bore them, were  now almost within range.    There was a snarl from the passage, and a black thing sprang at the  scout. Without clear sight of what he was fighting, he struck down  with his knife and felt it slit flesh. The snarl was a scream of rage  as the creature twisted in midair for a second try at him. In that  instant Sssuri, leaning halfway out of the hatch, struck in his turn,  thrusting his bone knife into shadows which now boiled with life.    Dalgard leaped for the lock door, kicking out swiftly and feeling the  toe of his boot contact with a crunch against one of those darting  shades, sending it back end over end into the press where its fellows  turned snapping upon it. Then Sssuri grabbed at him, bringing him in,  and together they slammed the hatch, feeling it shake with the shock  of thudding bodies as the pack outside went mad in their frustration.    While the merman fastened the locking bar, bringing out of the  long-motionless metal another protesting screech, Dalgard had a chance  to look about him. They were in a room some eight or nine feet long,  the violet light showing up well tangles of equipment hanging from  pegs on the walls, a pile of small cylinders on the floor. At the far  end of the chamber was another hatch door, locked with the same type  of bar as Sssuri had just lowered to seal the inner one. The merman  nodded to it.    \"The sea--\"    Dalgard slid his knife back into its sheath. So the sea lay beyond. He  did not welcome the thought of passing through that door. Like all of  his race he could swim--perhaps his feats in the water would have  astonished the men of the planet from which his tribe had emigrated.  But unlike the mermen, he was not sea-born, nor equipped by nature  with a secondary breathing apparatus to make him as free in the world  of water as he was on land. Sssuri might crawl through that hatch  without fear. For Dalgard it was as big a test as to turn and face  what now raged in the corridor on the inner side.    \"There is no hope that they will go now,\" Sssuri answered his vague  question. \"They are stubborn. And hours--or even days--will mean  nothing. Also they can leave a guard there and rove at will, to return  upon signal. That is their way.\"    This left only the sea door. Sssuri padded across the chamber and  reached up to free one of the strange objects dangling from the wall  pegs. Like all things made of the marvelous substance used by Those  Others for any article which might be exposed to the elements, it  seemed as perfect as on the day it had first been hung there, though  that date might be a hundred or more Astran years earlier. The merman  uncoiled a length of thin, flexible piping which joined a two-foot  canister with a flat piece of metallic fabric.    \"Those Others could not breathe under the water, as you cannot,\" he  explained as he worked deftly and swiftly. \"Within my own memory we  have trapped their scouts wearing aids such as these so that they  might spy upon our safe places. But their last foray was some years  ago and at that time we taught them such a lesson that they have not  dared to return. Since they are not unlike you in body and since you  breathe the same air aboveground, there is no reason why this should  not take you out of here.\"    Dalgard accepted the apparatus. A couple of elastic metal bands  fastened the canister to the chest of the wearer. The fabric molded  into a perfect, tight face mask as it touched the skin.    Sssuri went to the pile of cylinders. Choosing one he tinkered with  its pointed cone, to be rewarded with a thin hiss.    \"Ahhhh--\" again his recognition of the rightness of things. \"These  still contain air.\" He tested two more and then brought all three back  to where Dalgard stood, the canister strapped into place, the mask  ready in his hand. With infinite care the merman fitted two of the  cylinders into the canister and then was forced to set the other  aside.    \"We could not"]]]
