Evidently other  lynxes had come in to the kill beside the five I had followed. Then  all the big cats crouched in the snow and stared at me steadily out of  their wild yellow eyes.    It was only for a moment. The big lynx on my side of the log was in a  fighting temper; he snarled continuously. Another sprang over the log  and crouched beside him, facing me. Then began a curious scene, of  which I could not wait to see the end. The two lynxes hitched nearer  and nearer to where I stood motionless, watching. They would creep  forward a step or two, then crouch in the snow, like a cat warming her  feet, and stare at me unblinkingly for a few moments. Then another  hitch or two, which brought them nearer, and another stare. I could  not look at one steadily, to make him waver; for the moment my eyes  were upon him the others hitched closer; and already two more lynxes  were coming over the log. I had to draw the curtain hastily with a  bullet between the yellow eyes of the biggest lynx, and a second  straight into the chest of his fellow-starer, just as he wriggled down  into the snow for a spring. The others had leaped away snarling as the  first heavy report rolled through the woods.    Another time, in the same region, a solitary lynx made me  uncomfortable for half an afternoon. It was Sunday, and I had gone for  a snowshoe tramp, leaving my rifle behind me. On the way back to camp  I stopped for a caribou head and skin, which I had _cached_ on the  edge of a barren the morning before. The weather had changed; a bitter  cold wind blew after me as I turned toward camp. I carried the head  with its branching antlers on my shoulder; the skin hung down, to keep  my back warm, its edges trailing in the snow.    Gradually I became convinced that something was following me; but I  turned several times without seeing anything. \"It is only a fisher,\" I  thought, and kept on steadily, instead of going back to examine my  trail; for I was hoping for a glimpse of the cunning creature whose  trail you find so often running side by side with your own, and who  follows you if you have any trace of game about you, hour after hour  through the wilderness, without ever showing himself in the light.  Then I whirled suddenly, obeying an impulse; and there was Upweekis, a  big, savage-looking fellow, just gliding up on my trail in plain  sight, following the broad snowshoe track and the scent of the fresh  caribou skin without difficulty, poor trailer though he be.    He stopped and sat down on his feet, as a lucivee generally does when  you surprise him, and stared at me steadily. When I went on again I  knew that he was after me, though he had disappeared from the trail.    Then began a double-quick of four miles, the object being to reach  camp before night should fall and give the lucivee the advantage. It  was already late enough to make one a bit uneasy. He knew that I was  hurrying he grew bolder, showing himself openly on the trail behind  me. I turned into an old swamping road, which gave me a bit of open  before and behind. Then I saw him occasionally on either side, or  crouching half hid until I passed. Clearly he was waiting for night;  but to this day I am not sure whether it was the man or the caribou  skin upon which he had set his heart. The scent of flesh and blood was  in his nose, and he was too hungry to control himself much longer.    I cut a good club with my big jack-knife, and, watching my chance,  threw off the caribou head and jumped for him as he crouched in the  snow. He leaped aside untouched, but crouched again instantly, showing  all his teeth, snarling horribly. Three times I swung at him warily.  Each time he jumped aside and watched for his opening; but I kept the  club in play before his eyes, and it was not yet dark enough. Then I  yelled in his face, to teach him fear, and went on again.    Near camp I shouted for Simmo to bring my rifle; but he was slow in  understanding, and his answering shout alarmed the savage creature  near me. His movements became instantly more wary, more hidden. He  left the open trail; and once, when I saw him well behind me, his head  was raised high, listening. I threw down the caribou head to keep him  busy, and ran for camp. In a few minutes I was stealing back again  with my rifle; but Upweekis had felt the change in the situation and  was again among the shadows, where he belongs. I lost his trail in the  darkening woods.    There was another lynx which showed me, one day, a different side to  Upweekis' nature. It was in summer, when every creature in the  wilderness seems an altogether different creature from the one you  knew last winter, with new habits, new duties, new pleasures, and even  a new coat to hide him better from his enemies. Opposite my island  camp, where I halted a little while, in a summer's roving, was a  burned ridge; that is, it had been burned over years before; now it  was a perfect tangle, with many an open sunny spot, however, where  berries grew by handfuls. Rabbits swarmed there, and grouse were  plenty. As it was forty miles back from the settlements, it seemed a  perfect place for Upweekis to make a den in. And so it was. I have no  doubt there were a dozen litters of kittens on that two miles of  ridge; but the cover was so dense that nothing smaller than a deer  could be seen moving.    For two weeks I hunted the ridge whenever I was not fishing, stealing  in and out among the thickets, depending more upon ears than eyes, but  seeing nothing of Upweekis, save here and there a trampled fern, or a  blood-splashed leaf, with a bit of rabbit fur, or a great round cat  track, to tell the story. Once I came upon a bear and two cubs among  the berries; and once, when the wind was blowing down the hill, I  walked almost up to a bull caribou without seeing him. He was watching  my approach curiously, only his eyes, ears, and horns showing above  the tangle where he stood. Down in the coverts it was always intensely  still, with a stillness that I took good care not to break. So when  the great brute whirled with a snort and a tremendous crash of  bushes, almost under my nose, it raised my hair for a moment, not  knowing what the creature was, nor which way he was heading. But  though every day brought its experience, and its knowledge, and its  new wonder at the ways of wild things, I found no trace of the den,  nor of the kittens I had hoped to watch. All animals are silent near  their little ones, so there was never a cry by night or day to guide  me.    Late one afternoon, when I had climbed to the top of the ridge and was  on my way back to camp, I ran into an odor, the strong, disagreeable  odor that always hovers about the den of a carnivorous animal. I  followed it through a thicket, and came to an open stony place, with a  sharp drop of five or six feet to dense cover below. The odor came  from this cover, so I jumped down; when--_yeow, karrrr, pft-pft!_  Almost under my feet a gray thing leaped away snarling, followed by  another. I had the merest glimpse of them; but from the way they  bristled and spit and arched their backs, I knew that I had stumbled  upon a pair of the lynx kittens, for which I had searched so long in  vain.    They had, probably, been lying out on the warm stones, until, hearing  strange footsteps, they had glided away to cover. When I crashed down  near them they had been scared into showing their temper; else I had  never seen them in the underbrush. Fortunately for me, the fierce old  mother was away. Had she been there, I should undoubtedly have had  more serious business on hand than watching her kittens.    They had not seen more of me than my shoes and stockings; so when I  stole after them, to see what they were like, they were waiting under  a bush to see what I was like. They jumped away again, spitting,  without seeing me, alarmed by the rustle which I could not avoid  making in the cover. So I followed them, just a quiver of leaves here,  a snarl there, and then a rush away, until they doubled back towards  the rocky place, where, parting the underbrush cautiously, I saw a  dark hole among the rocks of a little opening. The roots of an  upturned tree arched over the hole, making a broad doorway. In this  doorway stood two half-grown lucivees, fuzzy and gray and  savage-looking, their backs still up, their wild eyes turned in my  direction apprehensively. Seeing me they drew farther back into the  den, and I saw nothing more of them save now and then their round  heads, or the fire in their yellow eyes.    It was too late for further observation that day. The fierce old  mother lynx would presently be back; they would let her know of the  intruder in some way; and they would all keep close in the den. I  found a place, some dozen yards above, where it would be possible to  watch them, marked the spot by a blasted stub, to which I made a  compass of broken twigs; and then went back to camp.    Next morning I omitted the early fishing, and was back at the place  before the sun looked over the ridge. Their den was all quiet, in deep  shadow. Mother Lynx was still away on the early hunting. I intended to  kill her when she came back. My rifle lay ready across my knees. Then  I would watch the kittens a little while, and kill them also. I wanted  their skins, all soft and fine with their first fur. And they were too  big and fierce to think of taking them alive. My vacation was over.  Simmo was already packing up, to break camp that morning. So there  would be no time to carry out my long-cherished plan of watching young  lynxes at play, as I had before watched young foxes and bears and owls  and fish-hawks, and indeed almost everything, except Upweekis, in the  wilderness.    Presently one of the lucivees came out, yawned, stretched, raised  himself against a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15955"],[0,"A Short History of Scotland (#17)"],[1,"the preachers to Perth: Erskine  of Dun went as an envoy to the Regent at Stirling; she is accused by Knox  of treacherous dealing (other contemporary Protestant evidence says  nothing of treachery); at all events, on May 10 the preachers were  outlawed for non-appearance to stand their trial.  The Brethren, \"the  whole multitude with their preachers,\" says Knox, who were in Perth were  infuriated, and, after a sermon from the Reformer, wrecked the church,  sacked the monasteries, and, says Knox, denounced death against any  priest who celebrated Mass (a circumstance usually ignored by our  historians), at the same time protesting, \"We require nothing but liberty  of conscience\"!    On May 31 a composition was made between the Regent and the insurgents,  whom Argyll and James Stewart promised to join if the Regent broke the  conditions.  Henceforth the pretext that she had broken faith was made  whenever it seemed convenient, while the Congregation permitted itself a  godly liberty in construing the terms of treaties.  A \"band\" was signed  for \"the destruction of idolatry\" by Argyll, James Stewart, Glencairn,  and others; and the Brethren scattered from Perth, breaking down altars  and \"idols\" on their way home.  Mary of Guise had promised not to leave a  French garrison in Perth.  She did leave some Scots in French pay, and on  this slim pretext of her treachery, Argyll and James Stewart proclaimed  the Regent perfidious, deserted her cause, and joined the crusade against  \"idolatry.\"        NOTE.      It is far from my purpose to represent Mary of Guise as a kind of  stainless Una with a milk-white lamb.  I am apt to believe that she  caused to be forged a letter, which she attributed to Arran.  See my  'John Knox and the Reformation,' pp. 280, 281, where the evidence is  discussed.  But the critical student of Knox's chapters on these events,  generally accepted as historical evidence, cannot but perceive his  personal hatred of Mary of Guise, whether shown in thinly veiled hints  that Cardinal Beaton was her paramour; or in charges of treacherous  breach of promise, which rest primarily on his word.  Again, that \"the  Brethren\" wrecked the religious houses of Perth is what he reports to a  lady, Mrs Locke; that \"the rascal multitude\" was guilty is the tale he  tells \"to all Europe\" in his History.  I have done my best to compare  Knox's stories with contemporary documents, including his own letters.  These documents throw a lurid light on his versions of events, as given  in this part of his History, which is merely a partisan pamphlet of  autumn 1559.  The evidence is criticised in my 'John Knox and the  Reformation,' pp. 107-157 (1905).  Unhappily the letter of Mary of Guise  to Henri II., after the outbreak at Perth, is missing from the archives  of France.          CHAPTER XIX.  THE GREAT PILLAGE.      The revolution was now under weigh, and as it had begun so it continued.  There was practically no resistance by the Catholic nobility and gentry:  in the Lowlands, apparently, almost all were of the new persuasion.  The  Duc de Chatelherault might hesitate while his son, the Protestant Earl of  Arran, who had been in France as Captain of the Scots Guard, was escaping  into Switzerland, and thence to England; but, on Arran's arrival there,  the Hamiltons saw their chance of succeeding to the crown in place of the  Catholic Mary.  The Regent had but a small body of professional French  soldiers.  But the other side could not keep their feudal levies in the  field, and they could not coin the supplies of church plate which must  have fallen into their hands, until they had seized the Mint at  Edinburgh, so money was scarce with them.  It was plain to Knox and  Kirkcaldy of Grange, and it soon became obvious to Maitland of  Lethington, who, of course, forsook the Regent, that aid from England  must be sought,--aid in money, and if possible in men and ships.    Meanwhile the reformers dealt with the ecclesiastical buildings of St  Andrews as they had done at Perth, Knox urging them on by his sermons.  We  may presume that the boys broke the windows and images with a sanctified  joy.  A mutilated head of the Redeemer has been found in a _latrine_ of  the monastic buildings.  As Commendator, or lay Prior, James Stewart may  have secured the golden sheath of the arm-bone of the Apostle, presented  by Edward I., and the other precious things, the sacred plate of the  Church in a fane which had been the Delphi of Scotland.  Lethington  appears to have obtained most of the portable property of St Salvator's  College except that beautiful monument of idolatry, the great silver mace  presented by Kennedy, the Founder, work of a Parisian silversmith, in  1461: this, with maces of rude native work, escaped the spoilers.  The  monastery of the Franciscans is now levelled with the earth; of the  Dominicans' chapel a small fragment remains.  Of the residential part of  the abbey a house was left: when the lead had been stripped from the roof  of the church it became a quarry.    \"All churchmen's goods were spoiled and reft from them . . . for every  man for the most part that could get anything pertaining to any churchmen  thought the same well-won gear,\" says a contemporary Diary.  Arran  himself, when he arrived in Scotland, robbed a priest of all that he had,  for which Chatelherault made compensation.    By the middle of June the Regent was compelled to remove almost all her  French soldiers out of Fife.  Perth was evacuated.  The abbey of Scone  and the palace were sacked.  The Congregation entered Edinburgh: they  seem to have found the monasteries already swept bare, but they seized  Holyrood, and the stamps at the Mint.  The Regent proclaimed that this  was flat rebellion, and that the rebels were intriguing with England.    Knox denied it, in the first part of his History (in origin a  contemporary tract written in the autumn), but the charge was true, and  Knox and Kirkcaldy were, since June, the negotiators.  Already his party  were offering Arran (the heir of the crown after Mary) as a husband for  Elizabeth, who saw him but rejected his suit.  Arran's father,  Chatelherault, later openly deserted the Regent (July 1).  The death of  Henri II., wounded in a tournament, did not accelerate the arrival of  French reinforcements for the Regent.  The weaker Brethren, however,  waxed weary; money was scarce, and on July 24, the Congregation evacuated  Edinburgh and Leith, after a treaty which they misrepresented, broke, and  accused the Regent of breaking. {111a}    Knox visited England, about August 1, but felt dissatisfied with his  qualification for diplomacy.  Nothing, so far, was gained from Elizabeth,  save a secret supply of 3000 pounds.  On the other hand, fresh French  forces arrived at Leith: the place was fortified; the Regent was again  accused of perfidy by the perfidious; and on October 21 the Congregation  proclaimed her deposition on the alleged authority of her daughter, now  Queen of France, whose seal they forged and used in their documents.  One  Cokky was the forger; he saw Arran use the seal on public papers. {111b}  Cokky had made a die for the coins of the Congregation--a crown of  thorns, with the words _Verbum Dei_.  Leith, manned by French soldiers,  was, till in the summer of 1560 it surrendered to the Congregation and  their English allies, the centre of Catholic resistance.    In November the Congregation, after a severe defeat, fled in grief from  Edinburgh to Stirling, where Knox reanimated them, and they sent  Lethington to England to crave assistance.  Lethington, who had been in  the service of the Regent, is henceforth the central figure of every  intrigue.  Witty, eloquent, subtle, he was indispensable, and he had one  great ruling motive, to unite the crowns and peoples of England and  Scotland.  Unfortunately he loved the crafty exercise of his dominion  over men's minds for its own sake, and when, in some inscrutable way, he  entered the clumsy plot to murder Darnley, and knew that Mary could prove  his guilt, his shiftings and changes puzzle historians.  In Scotland he  was called Michael Wily, that is, Macchiavelli, and \"the necessary evil.\"    In his mission to England Lethington was successful.  By December 21 the  English diplomatist, Sadleyr, informed Arran that a fleet was on its way  to aid the Congregation, who were sacking Paisley Abbey, and issuing  proclamations in the names of Francis and Mary.  The fleet arrived while  the French were about to seize St Andrews (January 23, 1560), and the  French plans were ruined.  The Regent, who was dying, found shelter in  Edinburgh Castle, which stood neutral.  On February 27, 1560, at Berwick,  the Congregation entered into a regular league with England, Elizabeth  appearing as Protectress of Scotland, while the marriage of Mary and  Francis endured.    Meanwhile, owing to the Huguenot disturbances in France (such as the  Tumult of Amboise, directed against the lives of Mary's uncles the  Cardinal and Duc de Guise), Mary and Francis could not help the Regent,  and Huntly, a Catholic, presently, as if in fear of the western clans,  joined the Congregation.  Mary of Guise had found the great northern  chief treacherous, and had disgraced him, and untrustworthy he continued  to be.  On May 7 the garrison of Leith defeated with heavy loss an Anglo-  Scottish attack on the walls; but on June 16 the Regent made a good end,  in peace with all men.  She saw Chatelherault, James Stewart, and the  Earl Marischal; she listened patiently to the preacher Willock; she bade  farewell to all, and died, a notable woman, crushed by an impossible  task.  The garrison of Leith, meanwhile, was starving on rats and  horseflesh: negotiations began, and ended in the Treaty of Edinburgh  (July 6, 1560).    This Treaty, as between Mary, Queen of France and Scotland, on one hand,  and England on the other, was never ratified by Mary Stuart: "]]]
