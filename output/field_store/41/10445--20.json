These finally reached her brother, Leif, and he  thought it a most shameful story. He thereupon took three of the men, who  had been of Freydis's party, and forced them all at the same time to a  confession of the affair, and their stories entirely agreed. \"I have no  heart,\" says Leif, \"to punish my sister, Freydis, as she deserves, but  this I predict of them, that there is little prosperity in store for  their offspring.\" Hence it came to pass, that no one from that time  forward thought them worthy of aught but evil. It now remains to take up  the story from the time when Karlsefni made his ship ready, and sailed  out to sea. He had a successful voyage, and arrived in Norway safe and  sound. He remained there during the winter, and sold his wares, and both  he and his wife were received with great favor by the most distinguished  men of Norway. The following spring he put his ship in order for the  voyage to Iceland; and when all his preparations had been made, and his  ship lying at the wharf, awaiting favorable winds, there came to him a  Southerner, a native of Bremen in the Saxonland, who wished to buy his  \"house-neat.\"[65-1] \"I do not wish to sell it,\" said he. \"I will give  thee half a 'moerk' in gold for it,\" says the Southerner. This Karlsefni  thought a good offer, and accordingly closed the bargain. The Southerner  went his way, with the \"house-neat,\" and Karlsefni knew not what wood it  was, but it was \"moesur,\" come from Wineland.    Karlsefni sailed away, and arrived with his ship in the north of  Iceland, in Skagafirth. His vessel was beached there during the winter,  and in the spring he bought Glaumboeiar-land, and made his home there,  and dwelt there as long as he lived, and was a man of the greatest  prominence. From him and his wife, Gudrid, a numerous and goodly  lineage is descended. After Karlsefni's death, Gudrid, together with her  son, Snorri, who was born in Wineland, took charge of the farmstead; and  when Snorri was married, Gudrid went abroad, and made a pilgrimage to  the South, after which she returned again to the home of her son,  Snorri, who had caused a church to be built at Glaumboer. Gudrid then  took the veil and became an anchorite, and lived there the rest of her  days. Snorri had a son, named Thorgeir, who was the father of Ingveld,  the mother of Bishop Brand. Hallfrid was the name of the daughter of  Snorri, Karlsefni's son; she was the mother of Runolf, Bishop Thorlak's  father. Biorn was the name of [another] son of Karlsefni and Gudrid; he  was the father of Thorunn, the mother of Bishop Biorn. Many men are  descended from Karlsefni, and he has been blessed with a numerous and  famous posterity; and of all men Karlsefni has given the most exact  accounts of all these voyages, of which something has now been    recounted.    FOOTNOTES:    [45-1] Reeves's translation. In _Origines Islandicae_, Vol. II., p. 598,  this saga is called \"The Story of the Wineland Voyages, commonly called  The Story of Eric the Red.\"    [45-2] The original word for \"Brief History\" also means \"section,\"  \"episode,\" \"little story,\" _i.e._, extract or abbreviated account.    [46-1] About 985 (983-986). One vellum of the _Landnama-bok_ (Book of  Settlements) says sixteen, the other fifteen years.    [46-2] Bishop Frederick was from \"Saxland\" (Saxony). According to the  Kristni-Saga he came to Iceland \"in the summer when the land had been  settled one-hundred-and-seven winters,\" _i.e._, in 981. He made but  little headway in preaching Christianity.    [47-1] _Hafgerdingar_ (sea-rollers) are supposed to have been earthquake  waves, and the lines evidently refer to such tidal-waves caused by an  unusually severe earthquake in the year 986. See Reeves, p. 180, (63).  The prose sense of the stave is: \"I beg the blessed friend of the monks  to further our voyage. May the Lord of the heavens hold his hand over  me.\"    [49-1] \"Certainly a marvellous coincidence, but it is quite in character  with the no less surprising accuracy with which the explorers of this  history [_i.e._, the Flat Island Book narrative] succeeded in finding  'Leif's-booths' in a country which was as strange to them as Greenland to  Biarni.\" (Reeves.)    [50-1] Earl Eric ruled in Norway from 1000 to 1015.    [52-1] These two words designate positions of the sun at two points of  time. Early commentators got much more definite results from this  observation than later ones, with scientific assistance, have succeeded  in getting. Largely on the basis of it, Rafn (in _Antiquitates  Americanae_), concluded that Vinland was in Rhode Island. Both Storm and  Reeves, after detailed investigation, declare that it cannot be shown  from this passage how far to the south Vinland was located. Captain  Phythian, U.S.N., who has given the question careful consideration, says:  \"The data furnished are not sufficiently definite to warrant a more  positive assertion than that the explorers could not have been, when the  record was made, farther north than Lat. [say] 49 deg..\" See Reeves, p. 181,  (66).    [56-1] Evidently an incorrect statement. _Landnama-bok_, the authority on  genealogical matters, says: \"His son was Thorbiorn, father of Gudrid who  married Thorstein, son of Eric the Red, and afterwards Thorfinn  Karlsefni.\" Thori Eastman (the Norwegian) is not mentioned in the  _Landnama-bok_.    [62-1] This cruel virago plays a much less conspicuous part in the  version of Hauk's Book and AM. 557.    [65-1] \"A weather-vane, or other ornament at the point of the gable of a  house or upon a ship.\" (Fritzner.)          FROM ADAM OF BREMEN'S[67-1] DESCRIPTIO INSULARUM AQUILONIS      Moreover he[67-2] spoke of an island in that ocean[67-3] discovered by  many, which is called Vinland, for the reason that vines grow wild there,  which yield the best of wine. Moreover that grain unsown[67-4] grows  there abundantly, is not a fabulous fancy, but, from the accounts of the  Danes, we know to be a fact. Beyond this island, it is said, that there  is no habitable land in that ocean, but all those regions which are  beyond are filled with insupportable ice and boundless gloom, to which  Martian thus refers: \"One day's sail beyond Thile the sea is frozen.\"  This was essayed not long since by that very enterprising Northmen's  prince, Harold,[68-1] who explored the extent of the northern ocean with  his ship, but was scarcely able by retreating to escape in safety from  the gulf's enormous abyss, where before his eyes the vanishing bounds of  earth were hidden in gloom.    FOOTNOTES:    [67-1] Adam of Bremen was a prebendary and writer on ecclesiastical  history. The _Descriptio Insularum Aquilonis_ is an appendix to his  _Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum_. For the preparation of his  work on the \"Northern Islands,\" Adam spent some time at the Danish court,  where he obtained much information from the king, Svend Estridson  (1047-1076), an unusually well informed monarch. Adam's work was  undoubtedly completed before the king's death, which occurred in 1076.  The _Descriptio_ was first printed in Lindenbrog's edition of Adam's  work, published in 1595, which thus contains the first printed allusions  to Vinland. Rafn gives a facsimile of one of the manuscripts, for part of  the passage.    [67-2] Svend Estridson, king of Denmark.    [67-3] Immediately before this extract, the author describes the islands  in the northern seas--among them Iceland--and then proceeds to speak of  newer lands \"deeper in the ocean,\" first of all Greenland, \"far up  towards the Swedish or Riphaean mountains,\" distant five or seven days'  sailing from Norway, then Halagland, somewhat nearer, where the sun is  above the horizon fourteen days in summer, and lastly Vinland. That is,  according to Adam, Vinland was in a northern region.    [67-4] The reference to the \"unsown grain,\" and vines in the preceding  sentence, are sufficiently characteristic to have enabled any one  familiar with the \"Saga of Eric the Red\" to identify the new land as  Vinland, even though it had not been named. It is interesting to note  that the reference to \"unsown grain\" does not appear in the Flat Island  Book saga.    [68-1] Evidently a reference to Harold the Stern-ruler (Haardraade). He  was a contemporary of Svend Estridson, and ruler in Norway from 1047 to  1066. The saga of Harold Haardraade in Snorri Sturlason's \"Saga of the  Kings of Norway\" contains no reference to any such expedition. Yet it  would be quite in keeping with the other adventures of this  much-travelled king to have undertaken such an expedition. It is to be  noted that he did not, according to Adam, go in search of Vinland.          FROM THE ICELANDIC ANNALS[69-1]      ANNALES REGII    A.D. 1121. Bishop Eric[69-2] of Greenland went in search of Vinland.      FROM THE ELDER SKALHOLT[69-3] ANNALS    A.D. 1347. There came also a ship from Greenland, less in size than small  Icelandic trading vessels. It came into the outer Stream-firth.[69-4] It  was without an anchor. There were seventeen men on board, and they had  sailed to Markland,[69-5] but had afterwards been driven hither by storms  at sea.    FOOTNOTES:    [69-1] Besides the Annales Regii, which are the most important, there are  several other Icelandic annals. All have, under the year 1121, the entry  given here, (facsimile in Rafn). It is the only information that they  give concerning Vinland, and is the last surviving mention of Vinland in  the older Icelandic records. It must be remarked, however, that there  were no contemporary annals as early as 1121; the earliest entries on  Scandinavian events are gleaned from various sources, especially the  early historians.    [69-2] According to the _Landnama-bok_ he was an Icelander, his full name  being Eric Gnupson. He is also known as Eric Uppsi. He was, according to  some accounts, the first"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18581"],[0,"Adrift in New York: Tom and Florence Braving the World (#17)"],[1,"his head, such as those who have gone to sea will readily recall.    Dodger became more and more bewildered.    \"If it's a dream, it's the most real dream I ever had,\" he said to  himself.    \"This seems like a ship's cabin,\" he continued, looking about him. \"I  think if I got up I should be seasick. I wonder if people ever get  seasick in dreams?\"    There was another pitch, and Dodger instinctively clung to the edge of  his berth, to save himself from being thrown out.    \"Let me see,\" he said, trying to collect his scattered recollection.  \"I went to sleep in a house uptown--a house to which Curtis Waring  lured me, and then made me a prisoner. The house was somewhere near  One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street. Now it seems as if I was on board  a ship. How could I get here? I wish somebody would come in that I  could ask.\"    As no one came in, Dodger got out of the berth, and tried to stand on  the cabin floor.    But before he knew it he was staggering like one intoxicated, and his  head began to feel bad, partly, no doubt, on account of the sleeping  potion which he had unconsciously taken.    At this moment the steward entered the cabin. \"Hello, young man! Have  you got up?\" he asked.    \"Where am I?\" asked Dodger, looking at him with a dazed expression.    \"Where are you? You're on the good ship _Columbia_, to be sure?\"    \"Are we out to sea?\"    \"Of course you are.\"    \"How far from land?\"    \"Well, about fifty miles, more or less, I should judge.\"    \"How long have I been here?\"    \"It seems to me you have a poor memory. You came on board last  evening.\"    \"I suppose Curtis Waring brought me,\" said Dodger, beginning to get  his bearings.    \"There was a gentleman came with you--so the mate told me. I don't  know his name.\"    \"Where is the ship bound?\"    \"To San Francisco, around Cape Horn. I supposed you knew that.\"    \"I never heard of the ship _Columbia_ before, and I never had any idea  of making a sea voyage.\"    The steward looked surprised.    \"I suppose your guardian arranged about that. Didn't he tell you?\"    \"I have no guardian.\"    \"Well, you'll have to ask Capt. Barnes about that. I know nothing,  except that you are a passenger, and that your fare has been paid.\"    \"My fare paid to San Francisco?\" asked Dodger, more and more at sea,  both mentally and physically.    \"Yes; we don't take any deadheads on the _Columbia_.\"    \"Can you tell me what time it is?\"    \"About twelve o'clock. Do you feel hungry?\"    \"N--not very,\" returned Dodger, as a ghastly expression came over his  face, and he tumbled back into his berth, looking very pale.    The steward smiled.    \"I see how it is,\" he said; \"you are getting initiated.\"    \"What's that?\" muttered Dodger, feebly.    \"You're going to be seasick. You'll hardly be able to appear at the  dinner table.\"    \"It makes me sick to think of eating,\" said Dodger, feebly.    As he sank back into his berth, all thoughts of his unexpected  position gave way to an overpowering feeling of seasickness.    He had never been tried in this way before, and he found the sensation  far from agreeable.    \"If only the vessel would stop pitching,\" he groaned. \"Oh, how happy I  should be if I were on dry land.\"    But the vessel wouldn't stop--even for a minute.    The motion, on the other hand, seemed to increase, as was natural, for  they were getting farther and farther from land and were exposed to  the more violent winds that swept the open ocean.    There is something about seasickness that swallows up and draws away  all minor cares and anxieties, and Dodger was too much affected to  consider how or why it was that he so unexpectedly found himself a  passenger to California.    \"Lie flat on your back,\" said the steward. \"You will feel better if  you do.\"    \"How long is it going to last?\" groaned Dodger, feeling quite  miserable.    \"Oh, you'll feel better to-morrow. I'll bring you some porridge  presently. You can get that clown, and it is better to have something  on your stomach.\"    He was right. The next day Dodger felt considerably better, and  ventured to go upon deck. He looked about him in surprise.    There had been a storm, and the waves were white with foam.    As far as the eye could see there was a tumult and an uproar.    The ship was tossed about like a cockle shell. But the sailors went  about their work unruffled. It was no new sight for them.    Though his head did not feel exactly right, the strong wind entered  Dodger's lungs, and he felt exhilarated. His eyes brightened, and he  began to share in the excitement of the scene.    Pacing the deck was a stout, bronzed seaman, whose dress made it clear  even to the inexperienced eyes of Dodger that he was the captain.    \"Good-morning, Master Grant,\" he said, pleasantly. \"Are you getting  your sea legs on?\"    The name was unfamiliar to Dodger, but he could see that the remark  was addressed to him.    \"Yes, sir,\" he answered.    \"Ever been to sea before?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"You'll get used to it. Bless me, you'll stand it like an old sailor  before we get to 'Frisco.\"    \"Is it a long voyage, captain?\" asked Dodger.    \"Five months, probably. We may get there a little sooner. It depends  on the winds and weather.\"    \"Five months,\" said Dodger to himself, in a tone of dismay.    The captain laughed.    \"It'll be a grand experience for a lad like you, Arthur!\" said the  captain, encouragingly.    Arthur! So his name was Arthur! He had just been called Master Grant,  so Arthur Grant was his name on board ship.    Dodger was rather glad to have a name provided, for he had only been  known as Dodger heretofore, and this name would excite surprise. He  had recently felt the need of a name, and didn't see why this wouldn't  answer his purpose as well as any other.    \"I must write it down so as not to forget it,\" he resolved. \"It would  seem queer if I forgot my own name.\"    \"I shouldn't enjoy it much if I were going to be seasick all the  time,\" he answered.    \"Oh, a strong, healthy boy like you will soon be all right. You don't  look like an invalid.\"    \"I never was sick in my life.\"    \"But your guardian told me he was sending you on a sea voyage for your  health.\"    \"Did Mr. Waring say that?\"    \"Yes; didn't you know the object of your sea trip?\" asked Capt.  Barnes, in surprise.    \"No.\"    \"There may be some tendency to disease in your system--some hereditary  tendency,\" said the captain, after a pause.    \"Were your parents healthy?\"    \"They--died young,\" answered Dodger, hesitatingly.    \"That accounts for your guardian's anxiety. However, you look strong  enough, in all conscience; and if you're not healthy, you will be  before the voyage ends.\"    \"I don't know what I am to do for clothes,\" said Dodger, as a new  source of perplexity presented itself. \"I can't get along with one  shirt and collar for five months.\"    \"You will find plenty of clothes in your valise. Hasn't it been given  you?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"You may ask the steward for it. You didn't think your guardian would  send you on a five-months' voyage without a change of clothing, did  you?\"    And the captain laughed heartily.    \"I don't know Mr. Waring very well,\" said Dodger, awkwardly.    As he went downstairs to inquire about his valise, this question  haunted him:    \"Why did Curtis Waring send him on a sea voyage?\"          Chapter XXII.  The Other Passenger.      Dodger sought the steward, and asked for his valise.    \"Isn't it in your stateroom?\" asked that functionary.    \"I haven't seen it.\"    \"I remember now. It was put with the luggage of the other passenger. I  will show it to you.\"    He took Dodger to a part of the ship where freight was stored, and  pointed to a sizable valise with a card attached to it on which was  inscribed the name: \"Arthur Grant.\"    \"This must be yours,\" he said.    \"Yes, I suppose so,\" answered Dodger, glad to have found out the new  name which had been given him, otherwise he would have supposed the  valise belonged to some other person.    He took the valise to his stateroom, and, finding a key tied to the  handles, he opened it at once.    It proved to contain a very fair supply of underclothing, socks,  handkerchiefs, etc., with a tooth brush, a hair brush and comb, and a  sponge. Never in his life had Dodger been so well supplied with  clothing before. There were four white shirts, two tennis shirts, half  a dozen handkerchiefs and the same number of socks, with three changes  of underclothing.    \"I begin to feel like a gentleman,\" said Dodger to himself,  complacently.    That was not all. At the bottom of the valise was an envelope, sealed,  on which was inscribed the name: \"Dodger.\"    \"That is for me, at any rate,\" thought our hero. \"I suppose it is from  Curtis Waring.\"    He opened the envelope, and found inclosed twenty-five dollars in  bills, with a few lines written on a half-sheet of paper. These Dodger  read, with interest and curiosity. They were as follows:        \"Dodger:--The money inclosed is for you. When you reach      California you will find it of use. I have sent you out there      because you will find in a new country a better chance to      rise than in the city of New York. I advise you to stay there      and grow up with the country. In New York you were under the      influence of a bad man, from whom it is best that you should      be permanently separated. I know something of the early      history of Tim Bolton. He was detected in a crime, and fled      to escape the consequences. You are not his son, but his      nephew. Your mother was his sister, but quite superior to      himself. Your right name is Arthur Grant, and it will be well      for you to assume it hereafter. I have entered you in the      list of passengers under that name.        \"I thought you had taken the will from my uncle's desk, but I      am inclined to think you had nothing to do with it. If you      know where it is, or whether Bolton has it, I expect you to"]]]
