The command  of the expedition was entrusted to Antonius Novellus and Suedius  Clemens, both senior centurions,[188] and to Aemilius Pacensis, to  whom Otho had restored his commission,[189] of which Galba had  deprived him. In charge of the fleet he still retained the freedman  Moschus[190] to keep an eye on his betters. In command of the cavalry  and infantry he placed Suetonius Paulinus, Marius Celsus, and Annius  Gallus, but the man in whom he put most faith was the Prefect of the  Guards, Licinius Proculus. This officer had shown himself efficient in  garrison service, but was without any experience of warfare. He  maligned the characteristic virtues of his colleagues, Paulinus' power  of influence, Celsus' energy, Gallus' ripe judgement, and being a  knave and no fool, he easily got the better of men who were both  honest and loyal.    It was about this time that Cornelius Dolabella[191] was banished       88  to the colony of Aquinum,[192] though not kept in close or  dishonourable confinement. There was no charge against him: the stigma  upon him was his ancient name and kinship[193] to Galba. Otho issued  orders that several of the magistrates and a large number of  ex-consuls were to join the expedition, not to take part in the  campaign or to assist in any way, but simply as a friendly escort.  Among these was Lucius Vitellius, whom he treated neither as an  emperor's brother nor as the brother of an enemy, but just like  anybody else. Much anxiety was aroused for the safety of the city,  where all classes feared danger. The leading members of the senate  were old and infirm, and enervated by a long period of peace: the  aristocracy were inefficient and had forgotten how to fight: the  knights knew nothing of military service. The more they all tried to  conceal their alarm, the more obvious it became. Some of them, on the  other hand, went in for senseless display, and purchased beautiful  armour and fine horses: others procured as provisions of war elaborate  dinner-services or some other contrivance to stimulate a jaded taste.  Prudent men were concerned for the country's peace: the frivolous,  without a thought for the future, were inflated by empty hopes: a good  many, whose loss of credit made peace unwelcome, were delighted at the  general unrest, feeling safer among uncertainties. Though the           89  cares of state were too vast to arouse any interest in the masses, yet  as the price of food rose, and the whole revenue was devoted to  military purposes, the common people gradually began to realize the  evils of war. During the revolt of Vindex they had not suffered so  much. Being carried on in the provinces between the legionaries and  the natives of Gaul it was to all intents a foreign war, and the city  had not been affected. For from the time when the sainted Augustus  organized the rule of the Caesars the wars of the Roman people had  been fought in distant countries: all the anxiety and all the glory  fell to the emperor alone. Under Tiberius and Caligula the country  only suffered from the evils of peace.[194] Scribonianus' rising  against Claudius was no sooner heard of than crushed.[195] Nero had  been dethroned more by rumours and dispatches than by force of arms.  But now not only the legions and the fleet, but, as had seldom  happened before, the Guards and the City Garrison were called out for  the campaign. Behind them were the East and the West and all the  forces of the empire, material for a long war under any other  generals. An attempt was made to delay Otho's departure by pointing  out the impiety of his not having replaced the sacred shields in the  temple of Mars.[196] But delay had ruined Nero: Otho would have none  of it. And the knowledge that Caecina had already crossed the  Alps[197] acted as a further stimulus.    Accordingly, on the fourteenth of March he commended the                90  government of the country to the senate, and granted to the restored  exiles all the rest of the property confiscated by Nero which had not  yet been sold for the imperial treasury.[198] The gift was a just one,  and made a very good impression, but as a matter of fact it was  nullified by the haste with which the work of collecting the money had  been conducted.[199] He then summoned a public meeting, and, after  extolling the majesty of Rome and praising the wholehearted adherence  of the senate and people to his cause, he used very moderate language  against the Vitellian party, criticizing the legions more for folly  than treason, and making no mention of Vitellius himself. This may  have been due to his own moderation, or it may be that the writer of  the speech felt some qualms for his own safety, and therefore  refrained from insulting Vitellius. For it was generally believed that  as in strategy he took the advice of Suetonius Paulinus and Marius  Celsus, so too in political matters he employed the talents of  Galerius Trachalus.[200] Some people even thought they could  recognize Trachalus' style of oratory, fluent and sonorous, well  adapted to tickle the ears of the crowd: and as he was a popular  pleader his style was well known. The crowd's loud shouts of applause  were in the best style of flattery, excessive and insincere. Men vied  with each other in their enthusiasm and prayers for his success, much  as though they were sending off the dictator Caesar or the emperor  Augustus. Their motive was neither fear nor affection, but a sheer  passion for servility. One can see the same in households of slaves,  where each obeys his own interest and the common welfare counts for  nothing. On his departure Otho entrusted the peace of the city and the  interests of the empire to his brother Salvius Titianus.

BOOK II      VESPASIAN AND THE EAST    Meanwhile, on the other side of Europe, Fortune was already sowing       1  the seeds of a dynasty, the varying fortunes of which were destined to  bring at one time happiness to the country and success to its rulers,  at another misery to the country and to the rulers destruction.[201]  Before Galba's fall Titus Vespasianus had been dispatched by his  father from Judaea to Rome.[202] The ostensible reason of his journey  was to show respect to the new emperor, and to solicit some post for  which his years now fitted him.[203] However, the popular passion for  invention suggested that he had been summoned to be adopted. This  rumour was based on the fact that Galba was old and childless: the  public never wearies of appointing successors until the choice is  made. The character of Titus gave still more colour to it. He seemed  capable of filling any position. His appearance lacked neither charm  nor dignity. Vespasian's successes also and the utterances of certain  oracles further endorsed the rumour, to say nothing of the chance  occurrences which pass for omens where the wish is father to the  thought. It was at Corinth in Achaia that Titus received the news of  Galba's murder, and was assured by people in the town that Vitellius  had declared war. In great perplexity he summoned a few of his friends  and discussed all the possibilities of the situation. If he continued  his journey to Rome he would earn no gratitude for compliments  addressed to another sovereign,[204] and would be held as a hostage  either for Vitellius or for Otho: on the other hand, if he returned to  Judaea he would inevitably offend the victor. However, the struggle  was still undecided, and the father's adherence to the successful  party would excuse the conduct of the son. Or if Vespasian himself  assumed sovereignty, they would have to plan war and forget all about  giving offence.    Such considerations held him balanced between hope and fear; but         2  ultimately hope prevailed. Some people believed that his longing to  get back to Queen Berenice[205] fired him to return. True, the young  man's fancy was attracted by Berenice, but he did not allow this to  interfere with business. Still his youth was a time of gay  self-indulgence, and he showed more restraint in his own reign than in  his father's.

Judicial activity encouraged the recording of royal legislation  in writing which both looked to the past and attempted to set  down law current in Henry's own day. The \"Liberi Quadripartitus\"  aimed to include all English law of the time. This showed an  awareness of the ideal of written law as a statement of judicial  principles as well as of the practice of kingship. In this way,  concepts of Roman law used by the Normans found their way into  English law.    Church law required that only consent between a man and woman was  necessary for marriage. There needn't be witnesses, ceremony,  nor consummation. Consent could not be coerced. Penalties in  marriage contracts were deemed invalid. Villeins and slaves  could marry without their lords' or owners' permission. A couple  living together could be deemed married. Relatives descended from  the same great great grandfather could not marry, nor could  relatives by marriage of the same degree of closeness. A legal  separation could be given for adultery, cruelty, or heresy.  Fathers were usually ordered to provide some sustenance and  support for their illegitimate children. The court punished  infanticide and abortion.      Judicial Procedure    Courts extant now are the Royal Court, the King's Court of the  Exchequer, shire courts, and hundred courts, which were under  the control of the King. His appointed justices administered  justice in these courts on regular circuits. Also there are  manor courts, borough courts, and ecclesiastical courts.    The King's Royal Court heard issues concerning the Crown and  breaches of the King's peace, which included almost all criminal  matters. The most serious offenses: murder, robbery, rape,  abduction, arson, treason, and breach of fealty, were now called  felonies. Other offenses were: housebreaking, ambush, certain  kinds of theft, premeditated assault, and harboring outlaws or  excommunicants. Henry personally presided over hearings of  important legal cases. He punished crime severely. Offenders  were brought to justice not only by the complaint of an  individual or local community action, but by official  prosecutors. A prosecutor was now at trials as well as a judge.  Trial is still by compurgation.    These offenses against the King placed merely personal property  and sometimes land at the King's mercy. Thus the Crown increased  the range of offenses subject to its jurisdiction and arrogated  to itself profits from the penalties imposed.    The Royal Court also heard these offenses against the King:  fighting in his dwelling, contempt of his writs or commands,  encompassing the death or injury of his servants, contempt or  slander of the King, and violation of his protection or his law.  It heard these offenses against royal authority: complaints of  default of justice or unjust judgment, pleas of shipwrecks,  coinage, treasure- trove [money buried when danger approached],  forest prerogatives, and control of castle building.    Henry began the use of writs to intervene in civil matters. These  writs allowed people to come to the Royal Court on certain  issues. He had some locally based justices, called justiciars.  Also, he sent justices out on eyres [journeys],with wide  responsibilities, to hear and decide all manner of Crown pleas.  This brought royal authority into the localities and served to  check baronial power over the common people. He created the  office of chief justiciar, which carried out judicial and  administrative functions.    The Royal Court also decided land disputes between barons. There  was a vigorous interventionism in the land law subsequent to  appeals to the King in landlord- tenant relations, brought by a  lord or by an undertenant. Assizes [those who sit together] of  local people who knew relevant facts were put together to assist  the court.    Records of the verdicts of the Royal Court were sent with  traveling justices for use as precedent in shire and hundred  courts.    The King's Court of the Exchequer reviewed the accounts of  sheriffs, including receipts and expenditures on the Crown's  behalf as well as sums due to the Treasury, located still at  Winchester. These sums included rent from royal estates, the  Danegeld land tax, the fines from local courts, and aid from  baronial estates. It was called the \"Exchequer\" because it used a  chequered cloth on the table to facilitate calculation in Roman  numerals of the amount due and the amount paid. It's records  were the \"Pipe Rolls\", so named because sheets of parchment were  fastened at the top, each of which dropped into a roll at the  bottom and so assumed the shape of a pipe.    The shire and hundred courts assessed the personal property of  individuals and their taxes due to the King. The shire court  decided land disputes between people who had different barons as  their respective lords.    The Crown used its superior coercive power to enforce the legal  decisions of other courts.    The shire courts heard cases of theft, brawling, beating, and  wounding, for which the penalties could be exposure in the  pillory or stocks where the public could scorn and hit the  offender. It met twice yearly. If an accused failed to appear  after four successive shire courts, he was declared outlaw at the  fifth and forfeited his civil rights and all his property. He  could be slain by anyone at will.    The hundred court heard neighborhood disputes, for instance  concerning pastures, meadows and harvests. It policed the duty  of frankpledge, which was required for those who did not have a  lord to answer for him. It met once a month.    The free landholders were expected to attend shire, hundred, and  baronage courts. They owed \"suit\" to it. The suitors found the  dooms [laws] by which the presiding officer pronounced the  sentence.    The barons held court on their manors for issues arising between  people living on the manor, such as bad ploughing on the lord's  land or letting a cow get loose on the lord's land, and land  disputes. They also made the decision of whether or not a person  was a villein or free. The manor court took over issues which  had once been heard in the vill or hundred court. The baron  charged a fee for hearing a case and received any fines he  imposed, which amounted to significant \"profits of justice\".    Boroughs held court on trading and marketing issues in their  towns such as measures and weights, as well as issues between  people who lived in the borough. The borough court was presided  over by a reeve who was a burgess as well as a royal official.    Wealthy men could employ professional pleaders to advise them and  to speak for them in a court.    The ecclesiastical courts dealt with family matters such as  marriage, annulments, marriage portions, legitimacy,  wife-beating, child abuse, orphans, bigamy, adultery, incest,  fornication, personal possessions, slander, usury, mortuaries,  sanctuary, sacrilege, blasphemy, heresy, tithe payments, church  fees, certain offences on consecrated ground, and breaches of  promises under oath, e.g. to pay a debt, provide services, or  deliver goods. It decided inheritance and will issues which did  not concern land, but only personal property. This developed  from the practice of a priest usually hearing a dying person's  will as to the disposition of his goods and chattel when he made  his last confession. It provided guardianship of infants during  probate of their personal property. Trial was by compurgation.  An alleged offender could be required to answer questions under  oath, thus giving evidence against himself. The ecclesiastical  court's penalties were intended to reform and determined on a  case-by-case basis. They could include confession and public  repentance of the sin before the parish, making apologies and  reparation to persons affected, public embarrassment such as  being dunked in water (e.g. for women scolds), walking a route  barefoot and clad only in one's underwear, whippings, extra  work, fines, and imprisonment in a \"penitentiary\" to do penance.  The ultimate punishment was excommunication with social  ostracism. Then no one could give the person drink, food, or  shelter and the only people he could speak to were his spouse  and servants. Excommunication included denial of the sacraments  of baptism, penance, eucharist, and extreme unction at death;  which were necessary for salvation of the soul; and the  sacrament of confirmation. However, the person could still marry  "]]]
