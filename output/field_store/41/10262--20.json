He wishes to communicate with  his public in the spirit of this experience. With Scott it was the old  associations of places, with du Maurier the associations of \"old times,\"  of personal memory. This was the frame of mind the interpretation of  which absorbed him in his literary art, distinguishing it, except in  his early _Cornhill_ work, from his art with the pencil.    There is not much in the remaining part of the gold-mine narrative which  can be shown to bear upon the artist's career. The conclusion of the  story shows his forfeiture of the regard of the directors by openness of  speech to the shareholders as to the proceedings at the mine.    Such was his experience of a mine in Devonshire and of relationship with  the miners, who, with the limited experience of the mining classes in  those days, had some difficulty in \"placing\" du Maurier with his, to  them, unusual physical delicacy and yet more unusual personal charm.      Section 4    The literary gift in the above narration will, we think, be evident even  in our quotations. But during the greater part of his life du Maurier's  literary gift remained unknown to the general public, though more than  one editor under whom he served on _Punch_ urged him to take a writer's  salary and be on the literary as well as on the artistic staff. It was  said that he relied with comfort upon this second talent to support him  in the event of his sight failing him altogether. There was a space of  thirty years between the above contribution to _Once a Week_ and the  writing of his first novel, _Peter Ibbetson_. But it is in that novel  that he again returns to the story of his career, through boyhood and  youth, leading up to the period in which his father started him in the  laboratory.    Du Maurier had in 1856, when his father died, practically the choice of  two arts, painting and singing, in both of which he seemed to have a  chance of distinguishing himself. And as the essay of 1861 was so soon  afterwards to prove, there was really another alternative, that of  authorship, for the gifted analytical chemist. He decided then to  forsake the chemistry to which he had been trained, but remained  undecided about everything else.    In 1856, at the age of twenty-two, he returned to Paris with his mother,  to live in the Rue Paradis-Poissoniere, very poor, very dull, and very  miserable, as he himself has said; but almost at the entrance of what he  describes as the best time of his life--that period in which, deciding  to follow art as a profession, he entered the studio of Gleyre. Those  were the joyous Quartier Latin days. He has described Gleyre's studio  in _Trilby_. The happy life there lasted a year: Whistler and Poynter,  as is well known, were his fellow-students.    [Illustration: Honour Where Honour is Due    _Sir Gorgius Midas (who has not been made a Peer_). \"Why, it's enough to  make a man turn _Radical_, 'anged if it ain't, to think of sich services  as mine bein' rewarded with no 'igher title than what's bestowed on a  heminent Sawbones, or a Hingerneer, or a Littery Man, or even a  successful Hartist!\"    _Mrs. Ponsonby de Tomkyns (sympathetically_). \"It does seem hard! But  you've only to bide your time, Sir Gorgius. No man of _your_ stamp need  ever despair of a Peerage!\" (And Mrs. Ponsonby de Tomkyns is, as usual,  quite right.)    _Punch_, May 15, 1880.]    The studio of Gleyre was inherited from Delaroche, and afterwards handed  down to Gerome. Whistler, Poynter, du Maurier, Lamont, and Thomas  Armstrong were the group of _Trilby_, Lamont was \"the Laird,\" Aleco  Ionides \"the Greek,\" and Rowley is supposed to have been \"Taffy.\"[4]    In 1857 du Maurier went on to the Antwerp Academy, where the masters  were De Keyser and Van Lerins. It was in the latter's studio that the  disaster of his life occurred. He was drawing from a model, when  suddenly the girl's head seemed to him to dwindle to the size of a  walnut. He clapped his hand over his left eye, and wondered if he had  been mistaken. He could see as well as ever. But when in its turn he  covered his right eye he learned what had happened. His left eye had  failed him. It might be altogether lost. It grew worse, until the fear  of blindness overtook him. In the spring of 1859 he went to a specialist  in Dusseldorf, who, while deciding that the left eye was lost, said that  with care there was no reason to fear losing the other. Du Maurier was  never able to shake off the terror of apprehension. He was apparently a  hopeless invalid at Christmas-time in 1859, \"in some dreary, deserted,  dismal Flemish town,\" in hospital. Turning over _Punch's Almanack_, the  delight the paper afforded him in such unhappy circumstances was \"a  thing not to be forgotten.\" It fired him with a new ambitious dream. The  astonishing thing was that before another year was over the dream was  beginning to come true: he was in England, making friends with Keene,  who introduced him to John Leech, whom he was destined to succeed at  _Punch's_ table.    The artist left Antwerp in 1860, and for several months he and Whistler  lived together in Newman Street. Their studio has been described.  Stretched across it was a rope like a clothes-line, from which floated a  bit of brocade, their curtain to shut off the corner used as a bedroom.  There was hardly even a chair to sit on, and often with the brocade a  towel hung from the line.      Section 5    In the autumn of 1860 the artist began to contribute to _Once a Week_.  Then followed a contribution to _Punch_ for which he continued to draw  as an occasional contributor chiefly of initial letters and the like,  until he reached the stage of contributing regular \"Pictures\" with  legends beneath in 1864. It was not until 1865, however, that his full  pages in _Punch_ became frequent. In that year he succeeded Leech at the  _Punch_ table.    His career practically began with his marriage to Miss Emma Wightwick.  Following the example of his master, Thackeray, he courageously married  upon \"prospects,\" as soon as ever the promise of regular employment for  his pencil seemed to be secure. This was the year in which he  illustrated Mrs. Gaskell's _Sylvia's Lovers_. \"My life,\" he once said,  \"was a very prosperous one from the outset in London; I was married in  1863, and my wife and I never once knew financial troubles. My only  trouble has been my fear about my eyes. Apart from that I have been very  happy.\"    Upon marrying, du Maurier moved to Great Russell Street, and, later, to  rooms in Earl's Terrace, Kensington, the house where Walter Pater died.    In the days when he was living in Great Russell Street the journalistic  world of London was very Bohemian. It is true that Leech had not made a  good Bohemian, but it was not until some time after du Maurier's  accession to the _Punch_ table that the weekly dinner lost an uproarious  gaiety that is recognised as the true Bohemian note. Mr. Punch and his  staff all improved their tone, Bohemia is now only a memory. It is the  very genius of Mr. Punch that makes him respond to the moment and become  the most decorous figure in the world in decorous times.    One cannot help being struck by a resemblance between the coming to town  and the almost immediate success there of du Maurier and Thackeray. The  comparison has its interest in the fact that as every man has his  master, beyond all dispute Thackeray was du Maurier's master. Both  quitted Bohemia, but in Society always retained the detachment of  artists. It was near to Thackeray's initials that du Maurier was  destined to cut his own on the great _Punch_ table. He himself described  the glamour Thackeray's name possessed for him, inspiring him as he  climbed out of the despair that followed the sudden partial deprivation  of his sight. The only time he met his master he was too diffident to  accept an invitation to be introduced. Thackeray seemed so great. But  all that evening he remained as close to him as possible, greedily  listening to his words. Like Thackeray, du Maurier thought that the  finest thing in the world was to live without fear and without reproach.  It is probable that Thackeray would not at all have minded not being  taken for a genius, but he would violently have resented not being  accounted a gentleman. For him that implied the great heart and the  scrupulous honour which Bohemia does not insist upon if you have great  spirits.      Section 6    Of du Maurier's great friendship with Canon Ainger, which commenced in  the seventies, light is to be obtained from Edith Sichel's _Life and  Letters of Alfred Ainger_.[5]    \"For fifteen years,\" says Miss Sichel, \"they always met once, and  generally twice a day. Hampstead knew their figures as every afternoon  they walked round the pond on the Heath, deep in conversation. Edward  Fitzgerald himself never had a closer friendship than had these two men  for one another. Their mental climates suited; they were akin, yet had  strong differences. Perhaps in the quickness of their mutual attraction  Frenchman recognised Frenchman. But Ainger was the French Huguenot and  du Maurier the French sceptic. Both had mercurial perceptions, and  exercised them on much the same objects. Both were wits and humorists,  but Ainger was more of a wit than a humorist, and du Maurier was more of  a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14400"],[0,"Manual of Egyptian Archaeology and Guide to the Study of Antiquities in Egypt (#17)"],[1," own. This was, however, a special favour,  and such monuments always bear an inscription stating that it is \"by the  king's grace\" that they occupy that position. Rarely as this privilege was  granted, it resulted in a vast accumulation of votive statues, so that in  the course of centuries the courts of some temples became crowded with  them. At Karnak, the sanctuary enclosure was furnished outside with a kind  of broad bench, breast high, like a long base. Upon this the statues were  placed, with their backs to the wall. Attached to each was an oblong block  of stone, with a projecting spout on one side; these are known as \"tables  of offerings\" (fig. 110). The upper face is more or less hollowed, and is  often sculptured with bas-relief representations of loaves, joints of beef,  libation vases, and other objects usually presented to the dead or to the  gods. Those of King Ameni Entef Amenemhat, at Gizeh, are blocks of red  granite more than three feet in length, the top of which is hollowed out in  regular rows of cup-holes, each cup-hole being reserved for one particular  offering. There was, in fact, an established form of worship provided for  statues, and these tables were really altars upon which were deposited  sacrificial offerings of meat, cakes, fruits, vegetables, and the like.    [Illustration: Fig. 110.--Table of offerings, Karnak.]    [Illustration: Fig. 111.--Limestone altar.]    [Illustration: Fig.112.--Naos of wood in the Museum at Turin.]    The sanctuary and the surrounding chambers contained the objects used in  the ceremonial of worship. The bases of altars varied in shape, some being  square and massive, others polygonal or cylindrical. Some of these last are  in form not unlike a small cannon, which is the name given to them by the  Arabs. The most ancient are those of the Fifth Dynasty; the most beautiful  is one dedicated by Seti I., now in the Gizeh Museum. The only perfect  specimen of an altar known to me was discovered at Menshiyeh in 1884 (fig.  111). It is of white limestone, hard and polished like marble. It stands  upon a pedestal in the form of a long cone, having no other ornament than a  torus about half an inch below the top. Upon this pedestal, in a hollow  specially prepared for its reception, stands a large hemispherical basin.  The shrines are little chapels of wood or stone (fig. 112), in which the  spirit of the deity was supposed at all times to dwell, and which, on  ceremonial occasions, contained his image. The sacred barks were built  after the model of the Bari, or boat, in which the sun performed his daily  course. The shrine was placed amidship of the boat, and covered with a  veil, or curtain, to conceal its contents from all spectators. The crew  were also represented, each god being at his post of duty, the pilot at the  helm, the look-out at the prow, the king upon his knees before the door of  the shrine. We have not as yet discovered any of the statues employed in  the ceremonial, but we know what they were like, what part they played,  and of what materials they were made. They were animated, and in addition  to their bodies of stone, metal, or wood, they had each a soul magically  derived from the soul of the divinity which they represented. They spoke,  moved, acted--not metaphorically, but actually. The later Ramessides  ventured upon no enterprises without consulting them. They stated their  difficulties, and the god replied to each question by a movement of the  head. According to the Stela of Bakhtan,[24] a statue of Khonsu places its  hands four times on the nape of the neck of another statue, so transmitting  the power of expelling demons. It was after a conversation with the statue  of Amen in the dusk of the sanctuary, that Queen Hatshepsut despatched her  squadron to the shores of the Land of Incense.[25] Theoretically, the  divine soul of the image was understood to be the only miracle worker;  practically, its speech and motion were the results of a pious fraud.  Interminable avenues of sphinxes, gigantic obelisks, massive pylons, halls  of a hundred columns, mysterious chambers of perpetual night--in a word,  the whole Egyptian temple and its dependencies--were built by way of a  hiding-place for a performing puppet, of which the wires were worked by a  priest.      [21] That is, the spirits of the North, represented by On (Heliopolis), and      of the South (Khonu).--A.B.E.    [22] At Tanis there seems to have been a close succession of obelisks and      statues along the main avenue leading to the Temple, without the usual      corresponding pylons. These were ranged in pairs; _i.e._, a pair      of obelisks, a pair of statues; a pair of obelisks, a pair of shrines;      and then a third pair of obelisks. See _Tanis_, Part I., by      W.M.F. Petrie, published by the Egypt Exploration Fund, 1884.--A.B.E.    [23] This fact is recorded in the hieroglyphic inscription upon the      obelisks.--A.B.E.    [24] This celebrated tablet, preserved in the Bibliotheque Nationale,      Paris, has been frequently translated, and is the subject of a      valuable treatise by the late Vicomte de Rouge. It was considered      authentic till Dr. Erman, in an admirable paper contributed to the      _Zeitschrift,_ 1883, showed it to have been a forgery concocted      by the priests of Khonsu during the period of the Persian rule in      Egypt, or in early Ptolemaic times. (See Maspero's _Hist. Ancienne      des Peuples de l'Orient_, chap, vi., pp. 287, 288. Fourth      Edition.)--A.B.E.    [25] The Land of Incense, called also in the inscriptions \"The Land of      Punt,\" was the country from which the Egyptians imported spices,      precious woods, gums, etc. It is supposed to represent the southern      coasts of the Red Sea, on either side the Bab el Mandeb. Queen      Hatshepsut's famous expedition is represented in a series of coloured      bas-relief sculptures on the walls of her great temple at Deir el      Bahari, reproduced in Dr. Duemichen's work, _The Fleet of an Egyptian      Queen_, and in Mariette's _Deir el Bahari_. For a full account      of this temple, its decoration, and the expedition of Hatshepsut, see      the _Deir el Bahari_ publications of the Egypt Exploration Fund.                CHAPTER III.    _TOMBS_.    The Egyptians regarded man as composed of various different entities, each  having its separate life and functions. First, there was the body; then the  _Ka_ or double, which was a less solid duplicate of the corporeal form--a  coloured but ethereal projection of the individual, reproducing him feature  for feature. The double of a child was as a child; the double of a woman  was as a woman; the double of a man was as a man. After the double (_Ka_)  came the Soul (_Bi_ or _Ba_), which was popularly represented as a human-  headed bird; after the Soul came the \"_Khu_,\" or \"the Luminous,\" a spark  from the divine fire. None of these elements were in their own natures  imperishable. Left to themselves, they would hasten to dissolution, and the  man would thus die a second time; that is to say, he would be annihilated.  The piety of the survivors found means, however, to avert this catastrophe.  By the process of embalmment, they could for ages suspend the decomposition  of the body; while by means of prayer and offerings, they saved the Double,  the Soul, and the \"Luminous\" from the second death, and secured to them all  that was necessary for the prolongation of their existence. The Double  never left the place where the mummy reposed: but the Soul and the \"_Khu_\"  went forth to follow the gods. They, however, kept perpetually returning,  like travellers who come home after an absence. The tomb was therefore a  dwelling-house, the \"Eternal House\" of the dead, compared with which the  houses of the living were but wayside inns; and these Eternal Houses were  built after a plan which exactly corresponded to the Egyptian idea of the  after-life. The Eternal House must always include the private rooms of the  Soul, which were closed on the day of burial, and which no living being  could enter without being guilty of sacrilege. It must also contain the  reception rooms of the Double, where priests and friends brought their  wishes or their offerings; the two being connected by a passage of more or  less length. The arrangement of these three parts[26] varied according to  the period, the place, the nature of the ground, and the caprice of each  person. The rooms accessible to the living were frequently built above  ground, and formed a separate edifice. Sometimes they were excavated in the  mountain side, as well as the tomb itself. Sometimes, again, the vault  where the mummy lay hidden, and the passages leading to that vault, were in  one place, while the place of prayer and offering stood far off in the  plain. But whatever variety there may be found as to detail and  arrangement, the principle is always the same. The tomb is a dwelling, and  it is constructed in such wise as may best promote the well-being, and  ensure the preservation, of the dead.      [26] These three parts are (l) the chapel, (2) the passage, or shaft, (3)      the sepulchral vault. If the latter was below the level of the chapel,      as in the time of the Ancient Empire, the communication was by a      sloping or vertical shaft.--A.B.E.          I.--Mastabas.      The most ancient monumental tombs are found in the necropolis of Memphis,  between Abu Roash and Dahshur, and in that of Medum;[27] they belong to the  mastaba type (Note 12). The mastaba (fig. 113) is a quadrangular building,  which from a distance might be taken for a truncated pyramid. Many mastabas  are from 30 to 40-feet in height, 150 feet in length, and 80 feet in width;  while others do not exceed 10 feet in height or 15 feet in length. The  faces are symmetrically inclined and generally smooth, though sometimes the  courses retreat like steps. The materials employed are stone or brick. "]]]
