I do not regard the greatness of  any pain from which, by reason of the shortness of its continuance, I  shall be delivered almost before it reaches me. But if the pain be as  great as that of Philoctetes, it will appear great indeed to me, but  yet not the greatest that I am capable of bearing; for the pain is  confined to my foot. But my eye may pain me, I may have a pain in the  head, or sides, or lungs, or in every part of me. It is far, then, from  being excessive. Therefore, says he, pain of a long continuance has  more pleasure in it than uneasiness. Now, I cannot bring myself to say  so great a man talks nonsense; but I imagine he is laughing at us. My  opinion is that the greatest pain (I say the greatest, though it may be  ten atoms less than another) is not therefore short, because acute. I  could name to you a great many good men who have been tormented many  years with the acutest pains of the gout. But this cautious man doth  not determine the measure of that greatness or of duration, so as to  enable us to know what he calls excessive with regard to pain, or short  with respect to its continuance. Let us pass him by, then, as one who  says just nothing at all; and let us force him to acknowledge,  notwithstanding he might behave himself somewhat boldly under his colic  and his strangury, that no remedy against pain can be had from him who  looks on pain as the greatest of all evils. We must apply, then, for  relief elsewhere, and nowhere better (if we seek for what is most  consistent with itself) than to those who place the chief good in  honesty, and the greatest evil in infamy. You dare not so much as  groan, or discover the least uneasiness in their company, for virtue  itself speaks to you through them.    XX. Will you, when you may observe children at Lacedaemon, and young men  at Olympia, and barbarians in the amphitheatre, receive the severest  wounds, and bear them without once opening their mouths--will you, I  say, if any pain should by chance attack you, cry out like a woman?  Will you not rather bear it with resolution and constancy? and not cry,  It is intolerable; nature cannot bear it! I hear what you say: Boys  bear this because they are led thereto by glory; some bear it through  shame, many through fear, and yet are we afraid that nature cannot bear  what is borne by many, and in such different circumstances? Nature not  only bears it, but challenges it, for there is nothing with her  preferable, nothing which she desires more than credit, and reputation,  and praise, and honor, and glory. I choose here to describe this one  thing under many names, and I have used many that you may have the  clearer idea of it; for what I mean to say is, that whatever is  desirable of itself, proceeding from virtue, or placed in virtue, and  commendable on its own account (which I would rather agree to call the  only good than deny it to be the chief good) is what men should prefer  above all things. And as we declare this to be the case with respect to  honesty, so we speak in the contrary manner of infamy; nothing is so  odious, so detestable, nothing so unworthy of a man. And if you are  thoroughly convinced of this (for, at the beginning of this discourse,  you allowed that there appeared to you more evil in infamy than in  pain), it follows that you ought to have the command over yourself,  though I scarcely know how this expression may seem an accurate one,  which appears to represent man as made up of two natures, so that one  should be in command and the other be subject to it.    XXI. Yet this division does not proceed from ignorance; for the soul  admits of a twofold division, one of which partakes of reason, the  other is without it. When, therefore, we are ordered to give a law to  ourselves, the meaning is, that reason should restrain our rashness.  There is in the soul of every man something naturally soft, low,  enervated in a manner, and languid. Were there nothing besides this,  men would be the greatest of monsters; but there is present to every  man reason, which presides over and gives laws to all; which, by  improving itself, and making continual advances, becomes perfect  virtue. It behooves a man, then, to take care that reason shall have  the command over that part which is bound to practise obedience. In  what manner? you will say. Why, as a master has over his slave, a  general over his army, a father over his son. If that part of the soul  which I have called soft behaves disgracefully, if it gives itself up  to lamentations and womanish tears, then let it be restrained, and  committed to the care of friends and relations, for we often see those  persons brought to order by shame whom no reasons can influence.  Therefore, we should confine those feelings, like our servants, in safe  custody, and almost with chains. But those who have more resolution,  and yet are not utterly immovable, we should encourage with our  exhortations, as we would good soldiers, to recollect themselves, and  maintain their honor. That wisest man of all Greece, in the Niptrae,  does not lament too much over his wounds, or, rather, he is moderate in  his grief:        Move slow, my friends; your hasty speed refrain,      Lest by your motion you increase my pain.    Pacuvius is better in this than Sophocles, for in the one Ulysses  bemoans his wounds too vehemently; for the very people who carried him  after he was wounded, though his grief was moderate, yet, considering  the dignity of the man, did not scruple to say,        And thou, Ulysses, long to war inured,      Thy wounds, though great, too feebly hast endured.    The wise poet understood that custom was no contemptible instructor how  to bear pain. But the same hero complains with more decency, though in  great pain:        Assist, support me, never leave me so;      Unbind my wounds, oh! execrable woe!    He begins to give way, but instantly checks himself:        Away! begone! but cover first the sore;      For your rude hands but make my pains the more.    Do you observe how he constrains himself? not that his bodily pains  were less, but because he checks the anguish of his mind. Therefore, in  the conclusion of the Niptrae, he blames others, even when he himself is  dying:        Complaints of fortune may become the man,      None but a woman will thus weeping stand.    And so that soft place in his soul obeys his reason, just as an abashed  soldier does his stern commander.    XXII. The man, then, in whom absolute wisdom exists (such a man,  indeed, we have never as yet seen, but the philosophers have described  in their writings what sort of man he will be, if he should exist);  such a man, or at least that perfect and absolute reason which exists  in him, will have the same authority over the inferior part as a good  parent has over his dutiful children: he will bring it to obey his nod  without any trouble or difficulty. He will rouse himself, prepare and  arm himself, to oppose pain as he would an enemy. If you inquire what  arms he will provide himself with, they will be contention,  encouragement, discourse with himself. He will say thus to himself:  Take care that you are guilty of nothing base, languid, or unmanly. He  will turn over in his mind all the different kinds of honor. Zeno of  Elea will occur to him, who suffered everything rather than betray his  confederates in the design of putting an end to the tyranny. He will  reflect on Anaxarchus, the pupil of Democritus, who, having fallen into  the hands of Nicocreon, King of Cyprus, without the least entreaty for  mercy or refusal, submitted to every kind of torture. Calanus the  Indian will occur to him, an ignorant man and a barbarian, born at the  foot of Mount Caucasus, who committed himself to the flames by his own  free, voluntary act. But we, if we have the toothache, or a pain in the  foot, or if the body be anyways affected, cannot bear it. For our  sentiments of pain as well as pleasure are so trifling and effeminate,  we are so enervated and relaxed by luxuries, that we cannot bear the  sting of a bee without crying out. But Caius Marius, a plain  countryman, but of a manly soul, when he had an operation performed on  him, as I mentioned above, at first refused to be tied down; and he is  the first instance of any one's having had an operation performed on  him without being tied down. Why, then, did others bear it afterward?  Why, from the force of example. You see, then, that pain exists more in  opinion than in nature; and yet the same Marius gave a proof that there  is something very sharp in pain for he would not submit to have the  other thigh cut. So that he bore his pain with resolution as a man;  but, like a reasonable person, he was not willing to undergo any  greater pain without some necessary reason. The whole, then, consists  in this--that you should have command over yourself. I have already  told you what kind of command this is; and by considering what is most  consistent with patience, fortitude, and greatness of soul, a man not  only restrains himself, but, somehow or other, mitigates even pain  itself.    XXIII. Even as in a battle the dastardly and timorous soldier throws  away his shield on the first appearance of an enemy, and runs as fast  as he can, and on that account loses his life sometimes, though he has  never received even one wound, when he who stands his ground has  nothing of the sort happen to him, so they who cannot bear the  appearance of pain throw themselves away, and give themselves up to  affliction and dismay. But they that oppose it, often come off more  than a match for it. For the body has a certain resemblance to the  soul: as burdens are more easily borne the more the body is exerted,  while"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14990"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement No. 819, September 12, 1891 (#17)"],[1,"the  same manner. The mixture of the two acids in B now represents the  volume of acid to be employed for dissolving and settling the next  charge of 800 pounds of bullion in A A. In this reservoir, B, the  cloud of lead sulphate mentioned above finds an opportunity for  settling.    The crystals of silver sulphate are detached from C by an iron shovel  and thrown into D. D is a lead lined tank about 4 ft. by 4 ft. and 3  ft. deep. It is divided into two compartments by means of a  horizontal, perforated false bottom made of wood. From the lower  compartment a lead pipe discharges into the lead lined reservoir, E.  Warm distilled water is allowed to percolate the crystals until the  usual ammonia test indicates that the copper sulphate has been  sufficiently dissolved. Then the outflow is closed, sheets of iron are  thrown on and into the crystals, the apparatus is filled with hot  distilled water, and steam is moderately admitted into the lower  compartment. Ferrous sulphate is formed, and in connection with the  iron rapidly reduces the silver sulphate to the metallic state, the  reduced silver retaining the heavy compact character of the crystals.  When the reaction is completed, as indicated by the chlorine test, the  liquid is discharged into E, the iron sheets are removed and the  silver is sweetened either in the same vessel, D, or in a special  filtering vessel which rests on wheels and may be run directly to the  hydraulic press.    The vat, E, is the great reservoir where all liquids holding silver  sulphate in solution are collected; for instance, that from sweetening  the gold and from washing the tools. Sheets of iron here precipitate  all silver and copper, and the resulting solution of ferrous sulphate  is, with the usual precautions, discharged into the sewer.  Occasionally when copper and silver have accumulated in E in  sufficient amount the mass is thrown into D, silver sulphate crystals  are added and sheet copper is thrown in, instead of sheet iron. There  results a hot, neutral, concentrated solution of copper sulphate,  which may be run at once into a crystallizing vat for the separation  of commercial crystals of copper sulphate. It will be readily  understood, of course, that if there should be any advantage in  manufacturing that commercial article, besides the amount prepared as  described, which represents merely the copper contained in the  bullion, copper sheets may be regularly employed for reducing the  silver sulphate in D. The author trusts that the practical refiner  will recognize that the manufacture of commercial copper sulphate is  thus effected in a more rational and economical manner than by the  present method of evaporating from 25 deg. B. to 35 deg. B., and of saturating  by oxidized copper, generally in a very incomplete manner, the large  amount of free acid left from the refining by the usual process.  However, the sale of copper sulphate is but rarely so profitable that  a refinery should not gladly dispense with that troublesome and bulky  manufacture, especially the government establishments, which, besides,  waste much valuable space with the crystallizing vats.    The great saving in sulphuric acid, amounting to about 50 per cent. of  the present consumption, has already been pointed out. Another  advantage the author merely mentions, namely, the easier condensation  of the sulphurous fumes in refineries situated in cities, because the  larger amount of acid available for dissolving greatly facilitates  working and makes the usual frequent admission of air into the  refining pot for the purpose of stirring and testing unnecessary.    The more air is excluded from the refining fumes the easier they can  be condensed.    Work may be carried on continuously, the vessels C and D being empty  by the time a new solution is finished in A A. Thus, the plant shown  in the diagram, covering 26 ft. by 16 ft., allows the refining of  40,000 ounces of fine silver in 24 hours; that is, four charges in A A  of 800 pounds each.--_F. Gutzkow, Eng. and Mining J._           *       *       *       *       *          A CASE OF DROWNING, WITH RESUSCITATION.    By F.A. BURRALL, M.D., New York.      As is usual at this season, casualties from drowning are of frequent  occurrence. No class of emergencies is of a more startling character,  and I think that a history of the case which I now present offers some  peculiar features, and will not be without interest to physicians.    The accident which forms the subject of this paper occurred August 29,  1890, at South Harpswell, Casco Bay, Me., where I was passing my  vacation.    At about 9.30 A.M., M. B----, an American, aged eighteen, the son of a  fisherman, a young man of steady habits and a good constitution, with  excellent muscular development, and who had never before required the  aid of a physician, was seen by the residents of the village to fall  forward from a skiff into the water and go down with uplifted hands. I  could not learn that he rose at all after the first submersion. Two  men were standing near a bluff which overlooked the bay, and after an  instant's delay in deciding that an accident had occurred, they ran  over an uneven and undulating pasture for a distance of two hundred  and fifty paces to the shore. One of them, after a quick decision not  to swim out to where the young man had fallen in and dive for him,  removed trousers and boots and waded out five yards to a boat, which  he drew into the shore and entered with his companion, taking him to a  yacht which lay two hundred and forty yards from the shore, in the  padlocked cabin of which was a boat hook. The padlock was unfastened,  the boat hook taken, and they proceeded by the boat directly to where  the young man lay. He was seen through the clear water, lying at a  depth of nine feet at the bottom of the bay, on his back, with  upturned face and arms extended from the sides of the body. He was  quickly seized by the boat hook, drawn head upward to the surface, and  with the inferior portion of the body hanging over the stern of the  boat, and the superior supported in the arms of his rescuer, was rowed  rapidly to the shore, where he was rolled a few times, and then placed  prone upon a tub for further rolling. I was told that much water came  from his mouth. Meantime I had been sent for to where I was sitting,  one hundred and fifty-one yards from the scene, and I arrived to find  him apparently lifeless on the tub, and to be addressed with the  remark, \"Well, doctor, I suppose we are doing all that can be done.\"    I have given these details, as from a study of them I was aided in  deciding the time of submersion, as well as the intervals which  transpired before the intelligent use of remedies. It is also  remarkable that, notwithstanding all which has been written about  ready remedies for drowning, no one present knew anything about them,  although living in a seafaring community.    I immediately directed that the patient should at once be placed upon  the ground, which was sloping, and arranged his rubber boots under the  back of the head and nape of the neck, so that the head should be  slightly elevated and the neck extended, while the head was turned  somewhat upon the side, that fluids might drain from the mouth. The  day was clear and moderately warm. Respiration had ceased, but no time  was lost in commencing artificial respiration. The patient had on a  shirt and pantaloons, which were immediately unbuttoned and made  loose, and placing myself at his head, I used the Silvester method,  because I was more accustomed to it than any other. It seems to me  more easy of application than any other, and I have often found it of  service in the asphyxia of the newly born.    The patient's surface was cold, there was extensive cyanosis, and his  expression was so changed that he was not recognized by his fellow  townsmen, but supposed to be a stranger. The eyelids were closed, the  pupils contracted, and the inferior maxilla firmly set against the  superior. One of the men who had brought him ashore had endeavored to  find the heart's impulse by placing his hand upon the chest, but was  unable to detect any motion.    I continued the artificial respiration from 9.45 until 10, when I  directed one of his rescuers to make pressure upon the ribs, as I  brought the arms down upon the chest. This assistance made expiration  more complete. When nature resumed the respiratory act I am unable to  say, but the artificial breathing was continued in all its details for  three-quarters of an hour, and then expiration was aided by pressure  on the chest for half an hour longer. Friction upward was also applied  to the lower extremities, and the surface became warm about half an  hour after the beginning of treatment.    About twenty minutes after ten, two hypodermic syringefuls of brandy  were administered, but I did not repeat this, since I think alcohol is  likely to increase rather than diminish asphyxia, if given in any  considerable quantity. A thermometer, with the mercury shaken down  below the scale, at this time did not rise. At 11.8 the pulse was 82;  respiration, 27; temperature, 97.    After a natural respiration had commenced, the wet clothing was  removed, and the patient was placed in blankets. Ammonia was  occasionally applied to the nostrils, since, although respiration had  returned, there was no sign of consciousness; the natural respiration  was at first attended by the expulsion of frothy fluid from the lips,  which gradually diminished, and auscultation revealed the presence of  a few pulmonary rales, which also passed away. There were efforts at  vomiting, and pallor succeeded cyanosis; there were also clonic  contractions of the flexors of the forearm. The pupils dilated  slightly at about one hour after beginning treatment. Unconsciousness  was still profound, and loud shouting into the ear elicited no  response. Mustard sinapisms "]]]
