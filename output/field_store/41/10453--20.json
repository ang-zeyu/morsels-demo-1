And as for the robins, the blue jays, and all the small birds, they do  more to save the growing plants, than all the soap suds and kerosene  emulsion that were ever made.    No one should ever shoot a bird. The birds are our natural protectors  against the vast armies of insects, that, but for the birds, would soon  destroy us by eating up our food plants.    What is that, May? You belong to an Audubon Society for the protection  of the birds?    Yes, I know you do, and so do John and Ned and Mollie and little Nell.    I wish every child in the United States belonged to the Audubon Society.  Then our birds would be safe. They would never be killed as they are now  for foolish women to wear on their hats.    When the Audubon Society children grew up they would not wear dead  birds, of course, and their children would be taught better, so that  after a while the Audubon Society people would be the only ones left,  and so the birds would be safe.    Let us get as many people to belong to the Audubon Society as we can.    What is that, Amy? You have learned more interesting things about birds  in the Audubon Society than you ever knew in your life before?    Yes, I am sure you have, and what could be lovelier to study about than  the birds.    What is that you are saying, Ned? You love to go bird hunting? Ah, I see  your eyes twinkle, sir; I know how you go hunting. You hunt with your  mother's opera glass! That is the proper way to hunt birds.    We can learn more from watching one bird with a glass than we could from  shooting a hundred.    But you do shoot them, John? Yes, I know about that, too. I know what  kind of a shooting instrument you got for Christmas, sir, and I have  seen the birds you shot!    Yes, nearly all of us have seen them, and how well he does it!    What, Amy, you think John ought to be ashamed of himself to go about  shooting birds, and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves to talk so about  it?    There, now, don't be vexed with Amy, children. She has known us but a  little while, and she has not seen John's birds, so I do not wonder she  feels indignant.    What is that, May? You have one of John's birds right here in your  school-bag? Show it to Amy.    Isn't it pretty! It is a very charming photograph of a catbird on its  nest.    You see John shoots birds with a camera! His father gave him a beautiful  one for Christmas, and he has made good use of it.    How long did it take you to get that bird, John?    Just hear! He spent more than a week getting acquainted with the bird so  it would sit still on the nest while he took its picture.    I am sure that was a week well spent.    John says he feels better acquainted with the catbird than he would have  been if he had read fifty books about it.    And I am sure he is right. The only way to enjoy a bird and to know it,  is to watch it alive.    A camera is the very best gun in the world for catching birds. And it is  really much better fun to take their pictures than to shoot and kill  them.    It seems to me we have strayed a long way from bugs.    May says she thinks birds are much more interesting than bugs.    That may be, but still we want to know about bugs, too.    Do you think you will know a bug when you see it now?    No, I do not believe you can be sure of that. But at least you know  something about a few bugs.    Some day you will study more carefully how insects are formed, and then  you will understand better how we decide what order they belong to.    We group together the insects that are most like each other.    [Illustration]           ~NEUROPTERA~     ~TRICHOPTERA~          THE HORNED CORYDALUS      No more bugs, if you please.    We are to make the acquaintance of another order of insect folk this  time.    [Illustration]    I think we can find some worthy members of this new order if we go with  John to a brook he knows of.    Here we are, and it certainly is a lovely brook, whether we find a  dobson in it or not.    Yes, Nell, the dobson is the new insect we shall try to find.    Now, be careful and not get your clothes too wet, but we have to turn  over the stones along the edge of the brook until we find what we are  after.    Mollie wants to know how she is to know it if she finds it.    Well, Mollie, whatever you find that is interesting you must show us.  Even though it is not what we are searching for, we shall enjoy seeing  it.    Look at little Nell! She has tumbled into the brook. Her foot slipped,  and down she went.    Don't cry, deary, you are not wet enough to do any harm. The warm sun  will soon dry you.    No, indeed, you will not have to go home.    [Illustration]    Perhaps you will be the first one to find a dobson after all.    Hurrah! hurrah! hear John shout!    He must have found the first dobson.    Yes, he has.    What, May? It is a horrid monster, and you have a good mind to scream?    Well, scream if you want to; that won't do any harm.    It _isn't_ pretty! but we shall like to look at it. You see it is a  larva and a big one, dark gray in color and with a thick leathery skin.    Mollie says it reminds her a little of the larva of the May fly; that  is, in shape.    Let us look at a picture of the May-fly larva.    You see it has a head, a thorax to which is attached the six legs and  the rudimentary wings, and an abdomen, all distinctly separated from  each other.    [Illustration]    The dobson has a head, but no thorax.    The body behind the head is divided into segments that all look very  much alike, and there is a pair of legs attached to each of the first  three segments.    The dobson eats other larvae that it chews up with its strong jaws.    It lives almost three years in the larval state, so you see it has  plenty of time in which to grow. Of course it moults. It is usually to  be found under stones in swift, running water. Those two pairs of hooks  at the tip of its body are its anchors.    It clasps them about a bit of stone or a stick that is firmly lodged,  and then it can bid defiance to the swirling stream.    Ned wonders why it is always found hiding under stones.    Listen to John, he says fishes are very fond of dobsons, and that is why  they hide away.    Fishermen hunt the dobsons for bait; so you see they have a hard time in  spite of their large size and their strong jaws.    When they have lived nearly three years in the water they crawl out on  the bank and hollow out a place under a stone.    Here they lie, apparently dead, but they are not dead.    They are undergoing a wonderful transformation.    It takes about a month for this transformation, or _metamorphosis_, as  it is called, to be completed.    All of our other insect friends have changed gradually from larval to  adult form. At each moult they became a little more like their parents,  and finally at the last moult, without any resting period, out sprang  the perfect insect.    Not so the dobson. It goes into its hole in the bank a larva, almost  exactly like the larva that hatched from the egg, only, of course, it is  larger. There is no hint of wings. It has no separate thorax and  abdomen. Could we see under the bank where it has crept, to undergo its  great metamorphosis, we should find, not a larva, but a strange-looking,  motionless object.    [Illustration]    Here is the picture of one. See its little wing pads. And now it has a  thorax and an abdomen.    It seems to have changed and been turned to some hard substance.    In this state it is called the _pupa_, which means doll. Is it not a  cunning insect doll? But it is not really a doll. Although so still and  apparently lifeless, yet it lives.    Some day it will burst its pupa shell and pull itself out--not a larva  now, not a pupa, but a strong-winged insect.    In its adult form, it is known as the horned corydalus.    There! I thought John was saving one for us. He had it in a box in his  pocket. Now see what a--a--what shall I say? A beauty? or a monster?  That is just as you feel about it.    It certainly is an alarming-looking insect.    This one is a male, as we can tell by the long, curved jaws that look  very dangerous; but in this instance the creature's appearance is worse  than its bite, and the real biter is the female whose jaws are smaller  but very useful in nipping tormentors or biting prey.    Now here she is--a fit mate for her formidable-looking companion.    [Illustration: MALE CORYDALUS.]    [Illustration: FEMALE CORYDALUS.]    John, you were fortunate in your hunting.    In spite of its terrifying appearance, see what wonderful wings the  corydalus has.    See! John has spread out the wings of the female.    They are indeed beautiful.    May cannot understand how those great wings came out of those little  wing pads.    When the wings were first pulled out of the wing pads they were small,  but they rapidly expanded and became thin and broad and long as the air  touched them.    You will understand that better after a while.    The corydalus differs from all the other insects we have studied, in its  metamorphosis.    It begins life far more unlike its parents than the other insects we  have been looking at, for they had the thorax and abdomen distinct from  the beginning. Instead of changing gradually and remaining active all  the time up to the final metamorphosis, our corydalus goes into the pupa  state, and in that motionless condition transforms to the perfect  insect.    This is called a complete metamorphosis.    When the change is gradual, without any pupa form, any stopping place as  it were, the change is said to be an incomplete metamorphosis.    Yes, the metamorphosis of the grasshoppers is incomplete, and of the  katydids and the crickets and all the other insects we have studied  until we came to the dobson.    Another name for the larva of insects that undergo an incomplete  metamorphosis is _nymph_. Some books speak of the nymph of the  grasshopper, and never of the larva of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18794"],[0,"Three Years' War (#17)"],[1," was to make the best of  every little chance we got of hampering the enemy. If fortune should  desert us, it only remained to flee.    To flee--what could be more bitter than that? Ah! many a time when I was  forced to yield to the enemy, I felt so degraded that I could scarcely  look a child in the face! Did I call myself a man? I asked myself, and  if so, why did I run away? No one can guess the horror which overcame  me when I had to retreat, or to order others to do so--there! I have  poured out my whole soul. If I did fly, it was only because one man  cannot stand against twelve.    After the Transvaalers had crossed the Vaal River, I took twelve hundred  men to Heilbron, where there was already a party of my burghers. General  Roux with other Free-Staters was stationed east of Senekal, and the  remainder of our forces lay near Lindley. But the commandos from Vrede  and Harrismith, with part of the Bethlehem commando, still remained as  watchers on the Drakensberg.    When I arrived at Heilbron, late at night, I received a report that  fighting was taking place on the Rhenoster River, between Heilbron and  Lindley, and that General J.B. Wessels and Commandant Steenekamp had  been driven back. But on the following morning, when the outposts came  in, they stated that they had seen nothing of this engagement. I  immediately sent out scouts, but hardly had they gone, before one of  them came galloping back with the news that the enemy had approached  quite close to the town. It was impossible for me to oppose a force of  five or six thousand men on the open plain; and I could not move to  suitable positions, for that would involve having the women and children  behind me when the enemy were bombarding me. I had therefore to be off  without a moment's delay. I had not even time to send my wife and my  children into a place of safety.    Our whole stock of ammunition was on the rail at Wolvehoek. I had given  orders to Mr. Sarel Wessels, who had charge of the ammunition, to hold  himself in readiness to proceed with it by rail, through the Transvaal,  to Greylingstad as soon as he received orders to do so.    But now the ammunition could not remain there, as Sir Redvers Buller was  gaining ground day by day towards the veldt on the Natal frontier and  the ammunition would thus be in danger of being taken. Therefore there  was nothing left for me but to get it through by way of Greylingstad  Station. It had to be done, and,--I had no carriages by which I could  convey it, as I had not sufficient hands to take carriages from the  trucks.[41] There was only one way (course) open; the commandos from  Smithfield, Wepener and Bethulie still had, contrary to the Kroonstad  resolution, carriages with them at Frankfort; I hastened to that village  and sent the necessary number of these carriages under a strong escort,  to fetch the ammunition from Greylingstad.    In order to do this responsible work I required a man whom I could  trust. Captain Danie Theron was no longer with me, because he, being a  Transvaaler, had gone with General Louis Botha. But there was another:  Gideon J. Scheepers.[42] To him I entrusted the task of reconnoitring  the British, so that the carriages which were going to fetch the  ammunition could do in safety what they were required to do, and I knew  that he would do it.    [Footnote 37: This \"granary\" lay in the Ladybrand, Ficksburg and  Bethlehem districts, and not only supplied the Free State, but also the  greater part of the Transvaal. If the districts of Wepener, Rouxville,  Bloemfontein, and Thaba'Nchu be included, this \"granary\" was the source  of a very large yield of corn, and there had been an especially rich  harvest that year. As the men were away on commando, the Kaffirs reaped  the corn under the supervision of the Boer women; and where Kaffirs were  not obtainable the women did the work with their own hands, and were  assisted by their little sons and daughters. The women had provided such  a large supply, that had not the English burnt the corn by the thousand  sacks, the war could have been continued. It was hard indeed for them to  watch the soldiers flinging the corn on the ground before their horses'  hoofs. Still harder was it to see that which had cost them so much  labour thrown into the flames.    In spite of the fact that the English, in order to destroy our crops,  had let their horses and draught oxen loose upon the land, there was  still an abundant harvest--perhaps the best that we had ever seen. And  so it happened that whilst the men were at the front, the housewives  could feed the horses in the stable. But Lord Roberts, acting on the  advice of unfaithful burghers, laid his hand upon the housewives' work,  and burnt the grain that they had stored.]    [Footnote 38: This Court was not composed of officers, but consisted of  three persons, one of whom was a lawyer.]    [Footnote 39: Township.]    [Footnote 40: Police Agent.]    [Footnote 41: Railway trucks.]    [Footnote 42: Everyone will know him, this brave man of pure Afrikander  blood, subsequently a famous Commander, a martyr. I appointed him  Captain of Scouts, and from the moment that he commenced his work I saw  that a _man_ had come forward. It was sad to think in what manner such a  man was deprived of his life. I shall speak more of him later on, for,  as our proverb says, \"I had eaten too much salt\" to pass over his career  unnoticed]          CHAPTER XIII    Our Position at the End of May, 1900      Once more it became necessary that the seat of Government should be  changed, and towards the latter part of May our administrative  headquarters were established at a place between Frankfort and Heilbron.  The object of our Government in choosing this position was to be able to  keep up telegraphic communication with the Transvaal. And their choice  was soon to be justified, for after Johannesburg had been taken on May  31st and Pretoria on July 5th, the only telegraphic connexion between  the Free State and the South African Republic was via Frankfort,  Greylingstad and Middlesburg. The terminus, at the Transvaal end, was  situated not far from Pretoria.    But, for the moment, it looked as if fortune were again going to smile  on us, after our long spell of ill luck. On May the 31st Lindley and its  garrison of Yeomanry fell into the hands of General Piet de Wet. The  Yeomanry lost heavily, and five hundred of them, including, as I was  told, several noblemen, were taken prisoner. These were the last  prisoners of war that we were able to send into the South African  Republic. Soon afterwards, when Pretoria was on the point of falling  into the enemy's hands, the prisoners there had to be sent further east,  but--owing either to the stupidity of the Transvaal Government, or to  the treachery of the guards--a great many of them were left behind for  Lord Roberts to release and re-arm against us. Our burghers grumbled  much at this, and blamed the negligence of the Transvaalers.    Before we had had time to get the captured Yeomanry through into the  Transvaal, Sir Redvers Buller had forced his way over the Natal  frontier, crossing the Drakensberg between Botha's Pass and Laing's Nek.  This event, which happened on June the 17th, caused yet another panic  among our commandos.    \"We are now,\" they said, \"surrounded on all sides. Resistance and escape  are equally impossible for us.\"    Never during the whole course of the war were President Steyn and I so  full of care and anxiety as at this time. With Buller across our  frontier, and the enemy within the walls of Johannesburg and Pretoria,  it was as much as we could do to continue the contest at all. However  brave and determined many of our burghers and officers might be, and, in  fact, were, our numerical weakness was a fact that was not to be got  over, and might prove an insuperable obstacle to our success. Moreover,  the same thing was now going on in the Transvaal after the capture of  Pretoria, as we had witnessed in the Free State after the fall of  Bloemfontein--nearly all the burghers were leaving their commandos and  going back to their farms. Plenty of officers, but no troops! This was  the pass to which we were come.    It was only the remembrance of how the tide had turned in the Free State  that gave us the strength to hold out any longer.    President Steyn and I sent telegram after telegram to the Government and  to the chief officers, encouraging them to stand fast. Meanwhile the two  Generals, De la Rey and Louis Botha, were giving us all a splendid  example of fortitude. Gazing into the future unmoved, and facing it as  it were with clenched teeth, they prosecuted the war with invincible  determination.           *       *       *       *       *    That the reader may the better appreciate the actual condition of our  affairs at this time, I think it well to make a short statement as to  the various districts of the Orange Free State, and the number of men  in each on whom we could still rely!    The burghers of Philippolis and Kaapstad had surrendered _en masse_ to  the English. In the first named of these districts, only Gordon Fraser  and Norval, in the second only Cornelius du Preez and another, whose  name has escaped my memory, remained loyal to our cause. I mention these  men here, because their faithfulness redounds to their everlasting  honour.    In the district of Boshof, we could still reckon on Veldtcornet  Badenhorst,[43] and twenty-seven men.    Jacobsdal was represented by Commandant Pretorius (who had succeeded  Commandant Lubbe, after the latter had been wounded and taken prisoner  at Tabaksberg), and forty men.    In the district of Fauresmith, Commandant Visser and some seventy men  had remained faithful.    In Bethulie, Commandant Du Plooij, with nearly a hundred men, were still  in arms.    Bloemfontein was represented by Commandant Piet Fourie and two hundred  burghers.    The commandos of Rouxville,"]]]
