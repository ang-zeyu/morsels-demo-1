[2] Dozy, ii. 287.        [3] Val du Junqueras, 920 A.D.        [4] Johannes Vasaeus ex Commentariis Resendi. Romey, iv. 257,      disbelieves this version of the story. Perhaps Al Makk., ii.      154, is referring to the same Pelagius when he mentions the      king's liking for a handsome Christian page.        [5] Sampiro, secs. 26-28.    In the death of Argentea (Ap. 28, 931) we have the last instance in  Spain of a Christian seeking martyrdom. She was the daughter of the  great rebel Omar ibn Hafsun,[1] and his wife Columba, and was born at  that chieftain's stronghold of Bobastro. Upon her mother's death Omar  wished her to take up her mother's duties in the palace, for Omar had  become a sort of king on his own domain. She declined, asking only for a  quiet retreat, where she might prepare her soul for martyrdom; and she  wrote to a devout Christian, whose wishes inclined him in the same  direction, suggesting that they should seek the crown of martyrdom  together.[2] On the destruction of Bobastro by Abdurrahman in 928, she  went to Cordova.[3] She there met with a Gaul named Vulfura, who had  been warned in a dream that in that city he should find a virgin, with  whom he was to suffer martyrdom. However, his object becoming known,  Vulfura is cast into prison by the governor of the city. Argentea goes  to visit him there, and is stopped by the guards, who, finding she is a  Christian, take her before the judge as a renegade, and she is  imprisoned with Vulfura. The alternative of Islam instead of death being  refused, they are both executed, but Argentea, as being an \"insolens  rebellis,\" is first scourged with 1000 stripes, and her tongue cut out.  Her body was buried at the church of the three saints.    In the year 934[4] we hear of two hundred monks of Cardena being  massacred by the Berbers in Abdurrahman's army; and in some sense they  can be regarded as martyrs to their faith.        [1] Who on becoming a Christian, took the name of Samuel.      Florez, x. p. 564, ff.        [2] See \"Life of Argentea,\" by an anonymous author.        [3] _Ibid._, sec. 4.        [4] Dozy, iii. 52. Mariana, viii. 6, gives 993, but says it may      have occurred in 893.    In 953 a martyr named Eugenia is said to have perished;[1] and thirty  years later, the last martyrs of whom we have any record under the Arab  rule. Dominicus Sarracinus, son of John, and his companions taken  prisoners at the capture of Simancas, were kept for two years and a-half  in prison.[2] They were then brought out and put to death, just when  Ramiro III., or his successor, had sent to ransom them.[3]    There is no evidence whatever to show that there was a persecution of  the Christians under the great Abdurrahman, and the statements of those  writers who intimate the contrary may be set aside as unsupported by  evidence.[4]    We will now turn back and take a general view of the Christian Church  and its condition under the Arabs in Spain, especially--for our  information is greatest as to those periods--under the two kings  Abdurrahman II. and III.    Under the former of these sovereigns the condition of the Christians,  until the persecution, which they themselves provoked, began, was very  tolerable, and the majority of the Christians were quite content with  their lot. They served in the army, both free men and slaves; they held  lucrative posts at Court, or in the houses of the Arab nobles, or as  government officials. But though the lay community was well off, the  clergy and stricter churchmen had something to complain of; for the  Church[5] could not be said to be free, though the worship was, since  the power of summoning councils had now passed to the Arab executive,  who, as we have seen, made even Moslems and Jews sit at these councils.  Sees were also put up to auction, and the scandalous spectacle was not  unknown, of atheists and heretics holding the titles, and drawing the  emoluments, of bishops.[6]        [1] Schott., iv. 246.        [2] Rohrbacher, xii. 192.        [3] Charter, apud Florez, xiv. 397.        [4] See above, p. 36, note 1. A letter also is mentioned of      John Servus Dei, Bishop of Toledo, to the Muzarabes with regard      to the late martyrdoms and apostasies, purporting to have been      written in 937.        [5] Dozy, ii. 47.        [6] Alvar, \"Ep.,\" xiii. 3. Samson, \"Apol.,\" ii. cc. ii.-iv.    As was to be expected, Arabic soon began to displace Latin throughout  the country, and even before the ninth century the Scriptures were  translated into the tongue of the conquerors [1] by Odoarius, Bishop of  Accita, and John of Seville. Hischem I. (788-796) forbade the use of any  language but Arabic, so that his Christian subjects had to use Arabic  Gospels;[2] and the Spaniards were soon not even permitted to write in  Latin.[3] Even if this statement be doubtful, we know that Latin came  gradually to be neglected and forgotten. Alvar utters an eloquent  protest against this: \"Alas, the Christians are ignorant of their own  tongue, and Latins neglect their language, so that in all the College of  Christ[4] there is scarcely to be found one who can write an address of  welcome to his brother intelligibly in Latin, while numbers can be found  competent to mouth the flowery rhetoric of the Chaldeans.\"[5] In the  department of poetry--the peculiar boast of the Arabs--the Christians  seem even to have surpassed their masters; and to the rivalry of the two  nations in this art we may attribute the excellence and abundance of  native ballads of which Spain can boast.    We have seen how Eulogius did his best to check this neglect of Latin,  by introducing into Spain some of the masterpieces in that language; but  it is doubtful whether his efforts had much result. We can see from the  remains of the Spanish writers which we possess that the structure of  that language had considerably degenerated in Spain.[6]        [1] Murphy, \"Hist. Mahom. Empire in Spain,\" p. 309.        [2] Yonge, p. 60.        [3] Conde, i. 239.        [4] \"Omni Christi collegio.\"        [5] Alvar, \"Ind. Lum.,\" sec. 35.        [6] See Elipandus and Alvar passim. Alcuin, on the other hand,      writes wonderfully good Latin.    Some sentences are so ungrammatical as to be scarcely intelligible.  Moreover, we find Samson[1] directly accusing Hostegesis, Bishop of  Malaga, of not being able to write Latin; and similarly Jonas of Orleans  (839) accusing Claudius, Bishop of Turin, who was himself a Spaniard, of  the same defect.    The neglect of Latin was accompanied by an increasing indifference to  the doctrinal basis of Christianity, educated Christians being led to  devote their time, which might have been more profitably spent on their  own Scriptures, to becoming acquainted with the Mohammedan religion, and  even to unravelling the intricacies of the controversial theology which  had grown up round, and overlaid, the original simplicity of the  Koran.[2] The great Fathers of the Church were laid aside unread, and  even the Prophets and Apostles, and the Gospel itself, found few to  study them. While the higher classes were indifferent to religion, the  lower were sunk in poverty[3] and ignorance.[4] The inevitable result of  this indifference, ignorance, and poverty, was a visible deterioration  in the character of Spanish Christianity, of which there are only too  many proofs.        [1] Samson, \"Apol.,\" c. vii.        [2] Alvar, \"Ind. Lum.,\" sec. 35--\"Ac dum illorum sacramenta      inquirimus, et philosophorum sectas scire non pro ipsorum      convincendis erroribus sed pro elegantia leporis et locutione      luculenter diserta. Quis rogo hodie solers in nostris fidelibus      laicis invenitur, qui Scripturis sanctis intentus volumina      quorumcunque Doctorum Latine conscripta respiciat? Quis      Evangelico, quis Prophetico, quis Apostolico ustus tenetur      amore? Nonne omnes iuvenes Christiani vultu decori, linguae      diserti, habitu gestuque conspicui, Gentilicia eruditione      praeclari, Arabico eloquio sublimati, volumina Chaldaeorum      avidissime tractunt?\"        [3] Florez, xix. 383, Charter of 993; see also \"Dozy,\" iii. 31;      and for the condition of Christians in the Free States, Buckle,      \"Hist. of Civiliz.,\" i. 443.        [4] Dozy (l.l.).    We find the abbot Samson distinctly accusing Hostegesis, Bishop of  Malaga, of simony, asserting that he sold the priesthood to low and  unworthy people;[1] while Alvar charges Saul, Bishop of Cordova, with  obtaining his bishopric by bribery.[2] Other irregularities imputed to  Hostegesis were that he held his see from his twentieth year, contrary  to the canons of the church, and that he beat priests, in order to  extort money from them, till they died under his hands.    Besides the election to the priesthood, by unworthy means, of unworthy  men, whose ignorance and impudence the congregation had to endure in  silence,[3] many were informally ordained without vouchers for character  being given, or the assent of their fellow-clergy and flocks being  obtained.[4] Many churches presented the unseemly spectacle of two rival  pastors, contrary to the ordinances received from the Fathers.[5]    Changes, too, were made in doctrine and ritual, for which no authority  could be alleged, in contravention of established custom and the  teaching of the Church. So far was this carried that Samson was accused  by his opponents of being a heretic and an idolator because he permitted  the marriage of cousins; dissented from the view that God was ever  enclosed in the chambers of the Virgin's heart;[6] asserted the  omnipresence of God, even in idols and the Devil, and this in an actual,  not a metaphysical, sense;[7] and denied that God sat upon an exalted  throne above his creatures. From this it is clear that Hostegesis and  those who thought with him[8] were infected with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15263"],[0,"The Underground Railroad (#17)"],[1,"the only spot that would be perfectly  safe. This was glorious news to Anthony; but it was well for him that he  was ignorant of the situation that awaited him on the boat, or his heart  might have failed him. He was willing, however, to risk his life for  freedom, and, therefore, went joyfully.    The hiding-place was small and he was large. A sitting attitude was the  only way he could possibly occupy it. He was contented. This place was  \"near the range, directly over the boiler,\" and of course, was very  warm. Nevertheless, Anthony felt that he would not murmur, as he knew  what suffering was pretty well, and especially as he took it for granted  that he would be free in about a day and a half--the usual time it took  the steamer to make her trip. At the appointed hour the steamer left  Norfolk for Philadelphia, with Anthony sitting flat down in his U.G.R.R.  berth, thoughtful and hopeful. But before the steamer had made half her  distance the storm was tossing the ship hither and thither fearfully.  Head winds blew terribly, and for a number of days the elements seemed  perfectly mad. In addition to the extraordinary state of the weather,  when the storm subsided the fog took its place and held the mastery of  the ship with equal despotism until the end of over seven days, when  finally the storm, wind, and fog all disappeared, and on the eighth day  of her boisterous passage the steamship City of Richmond landed at the  wharf of Philadelphia, with this giant and hero on board who had  suffered for ten months in his concealment on land and for eight days on  the ship.    Anthony was of very powerful physical proportions, being six feet three  inches in height, quite black, very intelligent, and of a temperament  that would not submit to slavery. For some years his master, Col.  Cunnagan, had hired him out in Washington, where he was accused of being  in the schooner Pearl, with Capt. Drayton's memorable \"seventy fugitives  on board, bound for Canada.\" At this time he was stoker in a machine  shop, and was at work on an anchor weighing \"ten thousand pounds.\" In  the excitement over the attempt to escape in the Pearl, many were  arrested, and the officers with irons visited Anthony at the machine  shop to arrest him, but he declined to let them put the hand-cuffs on  him, but consented to go with them, if permitted to do so without being  ironed. The officers yielded, and Anthony went willingly to the jail.  Passing unnoticed other interesting conflicts in his hard life, suffice  it to say, he left his wife, Ann, and three children, Benjamin, John and  Alfred, all owned by Col. Cunnagan. In this brave-hearted man, the  Committee felt a deep interest, and accorded him their usual  hospitalities.        PERRY JOHNSON, OF ELKTON, MARYLAND.      EYE KNOCKED OUT, ETC.      Perry's exit was in November, 1853. He was owned by Charles Johnson, who  lived at Elkton. The infliction of a severe \"flogging\" from the hand of  his master awakened Perry to consider the importance of the U.G.R.R.  Perry had the misfortune to let a \"load of fodder upset,\" about which  his master became exasperated, and in his agitated state of mind he  succeeded in affixing a number of very ugly stationary marks on Perry's  back. However, this was no new thing. Indeed he had suffered at the  hands of his mistress even far more keenly than from these \"ugly marks.\"  He had but one eye; the other he had been deprived of by a terrible  stroke with a cowhide in the \"hand of his mistress.\" This lady he  pronounced to be a \"perfect savage,\" and added that \"she was in the  habit of cowhiding any of her slaves whenever she felt like it, which  was quite often.\" Perry was about twenty-eight years of age and a man of  promise. The Committee attended to his wants and forwarded him on North.             *       *       *       *       *        ISAAC FORMAN, WILLIAM DAVIS, AND WILLIS REDICK.      HEARTS FULL OF JOY FOR FREEDOM--VERY ANXIOUS FOR WIVES IN SLAVERY.          These passengers all arrived together, concealed, per steamship City of  Richmond, December, 1853. Isaac Forman, the youngest of the  party--twenty-three years of age and a dark mulatto--would be considered  by a Southerner capable of judging as \"very likely.\" He fled from a  widow by the name of Mrs. Sanders, who had been in the habit of hiring  him out for \"one hundred and twenty dollars a year.\" She belonged in  Norfolk, Va.; so did Isaac. For four years Isaac had served in the  capacity of steward on the steamship Augusta. He stated that he had a  wife living in Richmond, and that she was confined the morning he took  the U.G.R.R. Of course he could not see her. The privilege of living in  Richmond with his wife \"had been denied him.\" Thus, fearing to render  her unhappy, he was obliged to conceal from her his intention to escape.  \"Once or twice in the year was all the privilege allowed\" him to visit  her. This only added \"insult to injury,\" in Isaac's opinion; wherefore  he concluded that he would make one less to have to suffer thus, and  common sense said he was wise in the matter. No particular charges are  found recorded on the U.G.R.R. books against the mistress. He went to  Canada.    In the subjoined letters (about his wife) is clearly revealed the  sincere gratitude he felt towards those who aided him: at the same time  it may be seen how the thought of his wife being in bondage grieved his  heart. It would have required men with stone hearts to have turned deaf  ears to such appeals.

WILLIAM STILL:--_Sir_--Your kind letter arrived safe at hand      on the 18th, and I was very happy to receive it. I now feel that      I should return you some thanks for your kindness. Dear sir I do      pray from the bottom of my heart, that the high heavens may      bless you for your kindness; give my love to Mr. Bagnel and Mr.      Minkins, ask them if they have heard anything from my brother,      tell Mr. Bagnel to give my love to my sister-in-law and mother      and all the family. I am now living at Russell's Hotel; it is      the first situation I have had since I have been here and I like      it very well. Sir you would oblige me by letting me know if Mr.      Minkins has seen my wife; you will please let me know as soon as      possible. I wonder if Mr. Minkins has thought of any way that he      can get my wife away. I should like to know in a few days.        Your well wisher,        ISAAC FORMAN.      Another letter from Isaac. He is very gloomy and his heart is almost  breaking about his wife.        SECOND LETTER.            TORONTO, May 7,1854.        MR. W. STILL:--_Dear Sir_--I take this opportunity of writing      you these few lines and hope when they reach you they will find      you well. I would have written you before, but I was waiting to      hear from my friend, Mr. Brown. I judge his business has been of      importance as the occasion why he has not written before. Dear      sir, nothing would have prevented me from writing, in a case of      this kind, except death.        My soul is vexed, my troubles are inexpressible. I often feel as      if I were willing to die. I must see my wife in short, if not, I      will die. What would I not give no tongue can utter. Just to      gaze on her sweet lips one moment I would be willing to die the      next. I am determined to see her some time or other. The thought      of being a slave again is miserable. I hope heaven will smile      upon me again, before I am one again. I will leave Canada again      shortly, but I don't name the place that I go, it may be in the      bottom of the ocean. If I had known as much before I left, as I      do now, I would never have left until I could have found means      to have brought her with me. You have never suffered from being      absent from a wife, as I have. I consider that to be nearly      superior to death, and hope you will do all you can for me, and      inquire from your friends if nothing can be done for me. Please      write to me immediately on receipt of this, and say something      that will cheer up my drooping spirits. You will oblige me by      seeing Mr. Brown and ask him if he would oblige me by going to      Richmond and see my wife, and see what arrangements he could      make with her, and I would be willing to pay all his expenses      there and back. Please to see both Mr. Bagnel and Mr. Minkins,      and ask them if they have seen my wife. I am determined to see      her, if I die the next moment. I can say I was once happy, but      never will be again, until I see her; because what is freedom to      me, when I know that my wife is in slavery? Those persons that      you shipped a few weeks ago, remained at St. Catherine, instead      of coming over to Toronto. I sent you two letters last week and      I hope you will please attend to them. The post-office is shut,      so I enclose the money to pay the post, and please write me in      haste.        I remain evermore your obedient servant,        I. FORMAN.          WILLIS REDICK.      He was owned by S.J. Wilson, a merchant, living in Portsmouth, Va.  Willis was of a very dark hue, thick set, thirty-two years of age, and  possessed of a fair share of mind. The owner had been accustomed to hire  Willis out for \"one hundred dollars a year.\" Willis thought his lot  \"pretty hard,\" and his master rather increased this notion by his  severity, and especially by \"threatening\" to sell him. He had enjoyed,  as far as it was expected for a slave to do, \"five months of married  life,\" but he loved slavery no less on this account. In fact he had just  begun to consider what it was to have a wife and children that he \"could  not own or protect,\" and who were claimed as another's property.  Consequently he became quite restive under these reflections"]]]
