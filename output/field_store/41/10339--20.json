The men cut and cooked some  greens but found no water. Travelled twelve or fourteen miles along the  beach.    Sunday April 14.    They shot a pigeon, two red-bills, and a hawk. In the afternoon it  rained, and they travelled along the beach and got some cockles, and  found a fine stream of water running out from under the rocks. They then  got under the scrub to keep the rain off, having made about eight miles.    April 15.    They again came out on the beach and kept along it. Good travelling. Made  a march of nearly twenty miles.    EXTREME DISTRESS FROM HUNGER AND THIRST.    April 16.    They continued on the beach till they came to a good place for fishing  and caught eighteen. Mr. Walker shot a bird. After eating the fish, they  were all very thirsty.    April 17.    Went into the interior about midday and found a native well six miles  inland; also a large cave in the rocks. The party here procured and ate  some Zamia nuts.    April 18.    They were all sick from the nuts, and turned back to the beach about four  miles but did not reach it.    April 19.    This morning they reached the beach and travelled on until they came to  some high rocks from whence they saw an immense tract of sand. Again this  evening they went into the interior to find water. Boiled some young  trees and ate them.    April 20.    They were travelling into the interior along the steep banks of a river  running nearly east. Got plenty of green stuff to eat. They had now two  guns and the means of getting fire, but the powder and shot was nearly  expended. The axe I left with them had been lost soon after.    April 21.    Woods left the others to proceed alone.    April 22.    Being the day after Woods left they went into the interior about six  miles from the coast and there found a river, which Mr. Walker and Mr.  Smith thought was the Karpan (the Moore). This river was standing in  pools, and there was a great rush of water from the hills; they traced  the bed up for two or three miles, where it came out from some very high  hills, when Mr. Smith said he was certain that it was not the Karpan.  They then made a south by west course, and thought where they came out  was 12 miles below where Woods left them; and that the river was nearly  halfway between these two points.    They now again turned into the interior, being, as they thought, at the  bay to the south of Jurieu Bay.    April 23.    They returned and kept along the beach, made about fifteen miles, when  they halted close to it.    April 24.    They went on for five or six miles, then halted and made a fire with the  end of a spar.    April 25.    They travelled two or three hundred yards. Mr. Walker went back for the  end of the spar and Mr. Smith cut some firewood. There they halted,  catching fish and crabs.    April 26 and 27.    Still halted at this spot, fishing, and caught parrot-fish, rock-cod,  etc.; so that they had as much fish as they could use, and found fresh  water in the holes of the rocks.    April 28.    They started at dawn and went on for a mile. Ruston was taken ill from  the number of crabs he had eaten, and Mr. Walker stopped with him whilst  the other three went on a mile ahead and got fish and periwinkles. Mr.  Smith, Stiles, and Clotworthy had a little water left; Ruston and Mr.  Walker had canteens half-full. Ruston got better in the evening but they  did not proceed until the next morning.    April 29.    Mr. Walker moved on with Ruston about a mile and there found Mr. Smith  clambering up some rocks, and having plenty of periwinkles, of which he  gave them some. Clotworthy had stopped up all night and had picked up  enough for four or five days. At night at low tide they got nearly fresh  water running out from under the rocks.    April 30.    They still halted, living on the periwinkles; but this evening the water  was more salt.    May 1.    This day the party separated into two portions and did not meet again  until the 2nd, on which day Mr. Walker left them by agreement, he being  the strongest of the party. His object was to proceed as expeditiously as  he could to Fremantle and send from thence a boat and fresh water for the  relief of the rest. The party he left behind having agreed to keep a  constant look out on the beach and hoist concerted signals.    For two days after Mr. Walker left them it appears they wandered about to  look for water and then fished. They fortunately fell in with a cask of  water, washed up on the beach, from which they filled their canteens,  roasted the fish and started on again, but made no distance. This lasted  for several days. They subsisted by picking up a few shellfish and some  dead birds which had been washed ashore, and they ate a sort of cane that  grows near the beach, and the Hottentot fig.    DEATH OF MR. SMITH.    Mr. Smith now gradually became exhausted, and at last one evening sat  down on a bank, and said he could not go on. He was behind the party with  Ruston, who thought he was dying, and went on and told the other men. The  next morning Ruston went back to try and find where Mr. Smith was, but  was so weak that (as he thought) he did not go far enough, and did not  find him. Mr. Smith seems to have crawled up into the bush, a little on  one side of their route, and there died.    TIMELY DISCOVERY OF THE REST BY MR. ROE. MR. ROE'S REPORT.    Four days after the rest were picked up by Mr. Roe's party, whose  proceedings I shall now relate from his own interesting report; premising  that the men had then been three days without water and four days without  food, and had nothing to eat but the sweet cane that grows near the  beach.    MR. ROE PROCEEDS IN SEARCH OF THE MISSING MEN.    Mr. Roe says:    Leaving Perth early on the 8th instant, accompanied by Mr. E. Spofforth  and four men, with the native youths Warrup and Wyip, and five horses, we  travelled in a north by west direction along a chain of beautiful lakes,  from three to ten miles apart, and surrounded by good soil and grass to a  short distance; and in the middle of the third day reached Neergabby on  the Garban River, about 52 miles distant. Giving our horses an hour's  rest, I rode forward twelve miles with Mr. Spofforth and Warrup to the  mouth of the river, where we hoped to find some traces of the absentees;  but to our disappointment and regret not a footmark was to be seen on the  sand except those of Woods, and the written directions which had been  placed conspicuously on sticks so as to intercept the track of the  wanderers were either untouched or washed down by the high tides.  Replacing these with full instructions how to proceed, we returned to our  camp at Neergabby, where we were joined by some natives of the district,  from whom however no information whatever could be obtained respecting  the objects of our search. Inferring from these circumstances that they  could not yet have reached so far south, and that they might probably  have quitted the beach for the purpose of seeking fresh water inland, we  lost no time in pushing on to the northward, and at sunset of the 11th  took up our bivouac at Barrumbur on the Moore River, seventeen miles in  advance, where excellent water was found in deep pools and our horses  revelled in luxuriant pasturage. Between the two rivers there is a great  extent of level country, so much under water in wet weather as to be then  totally impassable with horses or carts, and the beds of the rivers (near  which there is generally good cattle feed) assume the form of deep sandy  pools, a few yards apart and grooved to the depth of 25 or 30 feet below  the level of the banks.    Being desirous of penetrating the country further to the north before we  again visited the beach, which was computed to be about fifteen miles  distant with no water or feed for our horses in the intermediate space,  we buried half our provisions, etc., in a hole beneath our temporary  shelter, which was then fired in order to lull the suspicion of the  natives; and our sable companions having secreted the pannier-baskets and  packsaddles among the adjoining bushes in such a way as to defy  discovery, we trusted to Providence for the result, and next morning  resumed our northern route. Leaving the extensive shallow lakes of  Garbanup, at this time quite dry, about two miles on our left, we  traversed a more hilly and dry sandy district than before, and had an  elevated mountainous country fifteen or twenty miles to the eastward. We  had now entered upon the inhospitable tract in which Mr. Grey and his  party had been so much distressed for water on the homeward journey, and  their feet-marks were distinctly recognised by our natives around a  swampy space in search of some. At the end of sixteen miles we reached  Nowergup, a small rushy lake, at this time quite dry and dusty at the  surface, but having at its north end a small well, seven feet deep,  containing about a gallon of stinking water. Although this proved very  palatable after a dry day's journey, it was by no means adapted to the  wants of five horses, and we gladly accepted the services of one of the  natives of the district to conduct us to a larger quantity. Our way to it  led over a mile and a quarter of nearly level country, entirely under  water in winter, and covered with rushes and tea-trees. At the lowest  level was a well with abundance of water two feet below the surface, near  which we immediately took up our quarters and learnt that the spot was  called by them Bookernyup. We were also given to understand that the  country to the northward and westward was at this time of the year  entirely without water, and that none was to be found nearer than a river  \"far away\" in the north-east.    This account by no means lessened our fears for the poor fellows of whom  we were in search, and led us to determine on leaving the party here, and  making a forced march of two or three days to the north-west with the  smallest possible"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16160"],[0,"The Treasury of Ancient Egypt (#17)"],[1," sexes. During the voyage       several women strike the cymbals, some men play the       flute, the rest singing and clapping their hands. As they       pass near a town they bring the boat close to the bank.       Some of the women continue to sing and play the cymbals;       others cry out as long as they can, and utter mocking       jests against the people of the town, who begin to dance,       while the former pull up their clothes before them in a       scoffing manner. The same is repeated at every town they       pass upon the river. Arrived at Bubastis, they celebrate       the festival of Bast, sacrificing a great number of       victims, and on that occasion a greater consumption of       wine takes place than during the whole of the year.\"    At this festival of Bast half the persons taking part in the  celebrations must have become intoxicated. The Egyptians were always  given to wine-drinking, and Athenaeus goes so far as to say that they  were a nation addicted to systematic intemperance. The same writer, on  the authority of Hellanicus, states that the vine was cultivated in the  Nile valley at a date earlier than that at which it was first grown by  any other people; and it is to this circumstance that Dion attributes  the Egyptian's love of wine. Strabo and other writers speak of the wines  of Egypt as being particularly good, and various kinds emanating from  different localities are mentioned. The wines made from grapes were of  the red and white varieties; but there were also fruit wines, made from  pomegranates and other fruits. In the lists of offerings inscribed on  the walls of temples and tombs one sees a large number of varieties  recorded--wines from the north, wines from the south, wines provincial,  and wines foreign. Beer, made of barley, was also drunk very largely,  and this beverage is heartily commended by the early writers. Indeed,  the wine and beer-bibber was so common an offender against the dignity  of the nation, that every moralist who arose had a word to say against  him. Thus, for example, in the Maxims of Ani one finds the moralist  writing--         \"Do not put thyself in a beer-house. An evil thing are       words reported as coming from thy mouth when thou dost       not know that they have been said by thee. When thou       fallest thy limbs are broken, and nobody giveth thee a       hand. Thy comrades in drink stand up, saying, 'Away with       this drunken man.'\"    The less thoughtful members of society, however, considered drunkenness  as a very good joke, and even went so far as to portray it in their tomb  decorations. One sees men carried home from a feast across the shoulders  of three of their companions, or ignominiously hauled out of the house  by their ankles and the scruff of their neck. In the tomb of Paheri at  El Kab women are represented at a feast, and scraps of their  conversation are recorded, such, for instance, as \"Give me eighteen cups  of wine, for I should love to drink to drunkenness: my inside is as dry  as straw.\" There are actually representations of women overcome with  nausea through immoderate drinking, and being attended by servants who  have hastened with basins to their assistance. In another tomb-painting  a drunken man is seen to have fallen against one of the delicate  pillars of the pavilion with such force that it has toppled over, to the  dismay of the guests around.    In the light of such scenes as these one may picture the life of an  Egyptian in the elder days as being not a little depraved. One sees the  men in their gaudy raiment, and the women luxuriously clothed, staining  their garments with the wine spilt from the drinking-bowls as their  hands shake with their drunken laughter; and the vision of Egyptian  solemnity is still further banished at the sight. It is only too obvious  that a land of laughter and jest, feasting and carouse, must be situated  too near a Pompeian volcano to be capable of endurance, and the  inhabitants too purposeless in their movements to avoid at some time or  other running into the paths of burning lava. The people of Egypt went  merrily through the radiant valley in which they lived, employing all  that the gods had given them,--not only the green palms, the thousand  birds, the blue sky, the hearty wind, the river and its reflections, but  also the luxuries of their civilisation,--to make for themselves a frail  feast of happiness. And when the last flowers, the latest empty  drinking-cup, fell to the ground, nothing remained to them but that  sodden, drunken night of disgrace which shocks one so at the end of the  dynastic history, and which inevitably led to the fall of the nation.  Christian asceticism came as the natural reaction and Muhammedan  strictness followed in due course; and it required the force of both  these movements to put strength and health into the people once more.      [Illustration: PL. XI. An Egyptian noble of the Eighteenth Dynasty                         hunting birds with a boomerang and decoys.                         He stands in a reed-boat which floats amidst                         the papyrus clumps, and a cat retrieves the                         fallen birds. In the boat with him are his                         wife and son.                         --FROM A THEBAN TOMB-PAINTING, BRITISH MUSEUM.]    One need not dwell, however, on this aspect of the Egyptian temperament.  It is more pleasing, and as pertinent to the argument, to follow the old  lords of the Nile into the sunshine once more, and to glance for a  moment at their sports. Hunting was a pleasure to them, in which they  indulged at every opportunity. One sees representations of this with  great frequency upon the walls of the tombs. A man will be shown  standing in a reed boat which has been pushed in amongst the waving  papyrus. A boomerang is in his hand, and his wife by his side helps him  to locate the wild duck, so that he may penetrate within  throwing-distance of the birds before they rise. Presently up they go  with a whir, and the boomerang claims its victims; while all manner of  smaller birds dart from amidst the reeds, and gaudy butterflies pass  startled overhead. Again one sees the hunter galloping in his chariot  over the hard sand of the desert, shooting his arrows at the gazelle as  he goes. Or yet again with his dogs he is shown in pursuit of the  long-eared Egyptian hare, or of some other creature of the desert. When  not thus engaged he may be seen excitedly watching a bullfight, or  eagerly judging the merits of rival wrestlers, boxers, and fencers. One  may follow him later into the seclusion of his garden, where, surrounded  by a wealth of trees and flowers, he plays draughts with his friends,  romps with his children, or fishes in his artificial ponds. There is  much evidence of this nature to show that the Egyptian was as much given  to these healthy amusements as he was to the mirth of the feast.  Josephus states that the Egyptians were a people addicted to pleasure,  and the evidence brought together in the foregoing pages shows that his  statement is to be confirmed. In sincere joy of living they surpassed  any other nation of the ancient world. Life was a thing of such delight  to the Egyptian, that he shrank equally from losing it himself and from  taking it from another. His prayer was that he might live to be a  centenarian. In spite of the many wars of the Egyptians, there was less  unnecessary bloodshed in the Nile valley than in any other country which  called itself civilised. Death was as terrible to them as it was  inevitable, and the constant advice of the thinker was that the living  should make the most of their life. When a king died, it was said that  \"he went forth to heaven having spent life in happiness,\" or that \"he  rested after life, having completed his years in happiness.\" It is true  that the Egyptians wished to picture the after-life as one of continuous  joy. One sees representations of a man's soul seated in the shade of the  fruit-trees of the Underworld, while birds sing in the branches above  him, and a lake of cool water lies before him; but they seemed to know  that this was too pleasant a picture to be the real one. A woman, the  wife of a high priest, left upon her tombstone the following  inscription, addressed to her husband:--         \"O, brother, husband, friend,\" she says, \"thy desire to       drink and to eat hath not ceased. Therefore be drunken,       enjoy the love of women--make holiday. Follow thy desire       by night and by day. Put not care within thy heart. Lo!       are not these the years of thy life upon earth? For as       for the Underworld, it is a land of slumber and heavy       darkness, a resting-place for those who have passed       within it. Each sleepeth there in his own form, they       never awake to see their fellows, they behold not their       fathers nor their mothers, their heart is careless of       their wives and children.\"    She knows that she will be too deeply steeped in the stupor of the  Underworld to remember her husband, and unselfishly she urges him to  continue to be happy after the manner of his nation. Then, in a passage  which rings down the years in its terrible beauty, she tells of her  utter despair, lying in the gloomy Underworld, suffocated with the mummy  bandages, and craving for the light, the laughter, and the coolness of  the day.         \"The water of life,\" she cries, \"with which every mouth       is moistened, is corruption to me, the water that is by       me corrupteth me. I know not what to do since I came into       this valley. Give me running water, say to me, 'Water       shall not cease to be brought to thee.' Turn my face to       the north wind upon the edge of the water. Verily thus       shall my heart be cooled and refreshed from its pain.\"    It is, however, the glory of life, rather than the horror of death,  which is the dominant note in the"]]]
