They claimed the offering of human sacrifices  by their tribe to be an old custom and, as far as they knew the only way  to appease the wrath of the evil spirits, but said if they were ordered  to give the custom up they would do so even if the devil got them all.\"    Then follows the statement of an eye-witness to the ceremony:    \"My name is Modesta Barrera; I live in the town of Santa Cruz, my father  being a Visayan, my mother a Bagobo. I cannot read or write, and I think  that I am about twenty-three years old, although I am not certain on  that point.    \"On the 8th instant myself, Baon, Otoy, and Oton left Santa Cruz early  in the morning to go to Talun, a day's march from Santa Cruz, for the  purpose of trading with the natives of Talun, and also to collect some  debts which they owed Baon. We remained that night at Saculampula, near  Talun, where Ungon and Ido, two Bagobos, live with their families. There  we found two children the only persons at the house who informed us that  we should go to the house of Ambing, at Talun, where we could sell our  merchandise. On the morning of the 9th we got up about 7 or 8 o'clock  and started for Ambing's house. When within about an hour's walk of the  house, we found a great many people congregated together. We were told  that a human sacrifice had just taken place and on approaching to  discover what had happened, we saw a little boy about eight or nine  years old, the upper half of whose body was suspended by the wrists to a  tree, the lower half lying on the ground. The child had been thus tied  up while alive and had been cut into two parts at the waist; this was  about the position of the body when we saw it.    \"Immediately about twenty persons began to chop the body into small  pieces; and Ansig, the datto of Talun, came over to us and gave Baon two  pieces of the victim's hair attached to the scalp, which is a sign of  the sacrifice. The victim was a slave owned and sacrificed by Datto  Ansig. The first bolo cut which severs the body at the waist and which  in this case we were told was done by Ansig is always performed by the  person making the sacrifice. The people present were guests of Ansig and  were not responsible for the killing, though it is the custom for the  more favored ones to assist in chopping the victim into small pieces  after death.\"    In the letters written by Father GISBERT in 1886, are many references to  the religious practices of the Bagobo, from which the following are  extracts:    \"The feast which they hold before the sowing is a criminal and repugnant  trago-comedy. The tragical part is the first thing that is done. When  they have assembled in the middle of the woods * * * they tightly bind  the slave whom they are going to sacrifice. All armed with sharp knives,  leap and jump about their victim striking him, one after the other, or  several at one time, amid infernal cries and shouts, until the body of  the victim sacrificed has been cut to bits. From the place of the  sacrifice they then go to the house of their chief or the master of the  feast, holding branches in their hands which they place in a large  bamboo, which is not only the chief adornment but the altar of the house  in which they meet * * * The principal part is reserved for the old man  or master of the feast, he standing near the bamboo which I have  mentioned above, holding the vessel of wine in his hand, and, talking  with his comrades, addresses the great demon called _Darago_, whose  feast they are celebrating, in the following words: 'Darago, we are  making you this feast, with great good will and gladness, offering you  the blood of the sacrifice which we have made and this wine which we  drink so that you may be our friend, accompany us, and be propitious in  our wars.' * * * * * * * * * * *    \"When they marry, if the lovers think that it will be of any use they  make a human sacrifice so that they may have a good marriage, so that  the weather may be good, so that they may have no storm, sickness, etc.,  all things which they attribute to the devil. In the same way also when  they learn that there is any contagious disease, or fear death, several  of them assemble and make a human sacrifice, asking the devil to let  them live, since they generously offer him that victim. They also  believe that the disease can be conjured. But the time that it is  necessary to make a sacrifice, according to the law of the Bagobos, is  at the death of anyone of the family, before they can remove the  _lalaoan_ or mourning * * * At the point and on the day assigned, all  the sacrificers assemble, or possibly one member of each of the families  who are in mourning, at times fifty or more. The value of the slave  sacrificed is paid among them all, and he who pays most has the right to  sacrifice first.\"[**]    [**] In BLAIR and ROBERTSON, Vol. XLIII. pp. 244-51, will be found a  very interesting letter from FATHER GISBERT, in which he describes the  sacrifice of a Bagabo[sic] half-blood who had fallen in debt.    The official files in the Governor's office at Davao contain an account,  written by Gov. Bolton, of the sacrifice at Cataloonan, July 1, 1904.  This was held to secure the return to health of Chief Obo, who later  died.    [Transcriber's note: The two paragraphs immediately above both comprise  a single footnote.]    By the side of the trail, or in the forests, little shrines or platforms  about 3 ft. high and a foot square at the top, are frequently seen.  These are known as _buis_ and are erected for the _buso_, in order to  avert their displeasure and to keep them at a distance from the  dwellings. When the family has been subjected to petty annoyances, or  when for any other reason, the _mabalian_ thinks an offering should be  made, she orders the family to provide her with betel nut, a piece of  iron, and bits of broken dishes, or castoff clothing. These are placed  on the platform and the _buso_ are exhorted to come and accept them.  Good offerings are never made to this class of spirits, for \"they do not  expect to be treated like the more powerful.\" A shrub known as  _dalingding_ is planted by the side of the shrine so that its location  may be known even after the platform has fallen, and all passersby will  make some small offering, hoping thus to keep these evil beings in good  humor.    Rain can be stopped by placing an offering of a leg ring, or prepared  betel nut beside the trail and presenting them to the _Gimokod_, at the  same time asking them to stop the downpour.    DECORATIVE ART.    To a stranger entering a Bagobo house, in the absence of its owners, it  appears that the people have little artistic development. He sees no  paintings, no drawings, and few, if any, attempts to beautify the house  with carvings. The pots sitting by the fire, show no decoration nor do  the other household utensils exhibit embellishment of any kind. A closer  study of the field baskets, however, shows a slight attempt to produce  ornamentation by changing the weave of the central band from that at the  top and bottom, or by adding a few rude lines in pitch. The moment the  people enter, however, all is changed. The clothing they wear is covered  with intricate patterns, some realistic, others highly conventionalized  (Plate XXXI). Wonderful designs in beads or shell disks appear on coats,  jackets, and carrying bags, while at neck, waist, shoulder, and at the  bottom of sleeves and trousers are other figures in fine embroidery or  applique. Strands of beads and seeds exhibiting a great variety of  designs surround the necks of both men and women, while rings, armlets,  leglets, and anklets of beads, plaited material or metal, are common.  Combs are covered with pitch and inlaid with beads, or patterns are  incised in the wood and filled with lime. Ear plugs exhibit beautiful  delicate patterns inlaid with brass or silver.    A glance at the weapons carried by the man shows that his knife has been  ornamented with caps of brass (Plate XXXII), the metal guard has cut or  cast patterns in its surface, while sheath and carrying belt are covered  with thin brass plates, painted lines, or a beaded cloth (Plate XXXIII)  with bells attached. Fronts and backs of shields are covered with  incised designs, while the metal ferrule next to the spear head seldom  lacks in conventionalized figures. So the list might be extended to  cover the women's knives and their pocket and carrying baskets, as well  as the betel boxes and lime holders used by both sexes. In short, there  seems to be no end to the list of personal ornaments and equipment which  may be improved by carvings, arrangements of beads or metal castings"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18274"],[0,"A Book of Natural History (#17)"],[1,"le. In vain he strutted around  her and displayed his fine feathers; every now and then she would make  at him in a most spiteful manner. He followed her to the ground,  poured into her ear a fine, half-suppressed warble, offered her a  worm, flew back to the tree again with a great spread of plumage,  hopped around her on the branches, chirruped, chattered, flew  gallantly at an intruder, and was back in an instant at her side. No  use,--she cut him short at every turn.    The _denouement_ I cannot relate, as the artful bird, followed by her  ardent suitor, soon flew away beyond my sight. It may not be rash to  conclude, however that she held out no longer than was prudent.    On the whole, there seems to be a system of Women's Rights prevailing  among the birds, which, contemplated from the standpoint of the male,  is quite admirable. In almost all cases of joint interest, the female  bird is the most active. She determines the site of the nest, and is  usually the most absorbed in its construction. Generally, she is more  vigilant in caring for the young, and manifests the most concern when  danger threatens. Hour after hour I have seen the mother of a brood of  blue grossbeaks pass from the nearest meadow to the tree that held her  nest, with a cricket or grasshopper in her bill, while her  better-dressed half was singing serenely on a distant tree or pursuing  his pleasure amid the branches.    Yet among the majority of our song birds, the male is most conspicuous  both by his color and manners and by his song, and is to that extent a  shield to the female. It is thought that the female is humbler clad  for her better concealment during incubation. But this is not  satisfactory, as in some cases she is relieved from time to time by  the male. In the case of the domestic dove, for instance, promptly at  mid-day the cock is found upon the nest. I should say that the dull or  neutral tints of the female were a provision of nature for her greater  safety at all times, as her life is far more precious to the species  than that of the male. The indispensable office of the male reduces  itself to little more than a moment of time, while that of his mate  extends over days and weeks, if not months.    In migrating northward, the males precede the females by eight or ten  days; returning in the fall, the females and young precede the males  by about the same time.    [Illustration: NEST OF THE CHICADEE.]    After the woodpeckers have abandoned their nests, or rather chambers,  which they do after the first season, their cousins, the nut-hatches,  chickadees, and brown creepers, fall heir to them. These birds,  especially the creepers and nut-hatches, have many of the habits of  the _picidae_, but lack their powers of bill, and so are unable to  excavate a nest for themselves. Their habitation, therefore, is always  second-hand. But each species carries in some soft material of various  kinds, or, in other words, furnishes the tenement to its liking. The  chickadee arranges in the bottom of the cavity a little mat of a  light, felt-like substance, which looks as if it came from the  hatter's, but which is probably the work of numerous worms or  caterpillars. On this soft lining the female deposits six white eggs.    I recently discovered one of these nests in a most interesting  situation. The tree containing it, a variety of the wild cherry, stood  upon the brink of the bald summit of a high mountain. Gray, time-worn  rocks lay piled loosely about, or overtoppled the just visible by-ways  of the red fox. The trees had a half-scared look, and that  indescribable wildness which lurks about the tops of all remote  mountains possessed the place. Standing there, I looked down upon the  back of the red-tailed hawk as he flew out over the earth beneath me.  Following him, my eye also took in farms, and settlements, and  villages, and other mountain ranges that grew blue in the distance.    The parent birds attracted my attention by appearing with food in  their beaks, and by seeming much put out. Yet so wary were they of  revealing the locality of their brood, or even of the precise tree  that held them, that I lurked around over an hour without gaining a  point on them. Finally a bright and curious boy who accompanied me  secreted himself under a low, projecting rock close to the tree in  which we supposed the nest to be, while I moved off around the  mountain-side. It was not long before the youth had their secret. The  tree, which was low and wide branching, and overrun with lichens,  appeared at a cursory glance to contain not one dry or decayed limb.  Yet there was one a few feet long, in which, when my eyes were piloted  thither, I detected a small round orifice.    As my weight began to shake the branches, the consternation of both  old and young was great. The stump of a limb that held the nest was  about three inches thick, and at the bottom of the tunnel was  excavated quite to the bark. With my thumb I broke in the thin wall,  and the young, which were full-fledged, looked out upon the world for  the first time. Presently one of them, with a significant chirp, as  much as to say, \"It is time we were out of this,\" began to climb up  toward the proper entrance. Placing himself in the hole, he looked  around without manifesting any surprise at the grand scene that lay  spread out before him. He was taking his bearings and determining how  far he could trust the power of his untried wings to take him out of  harm's way. After a moment's pause, with a loud chirrup, he launched  out, and made tolerable headway. The others rapidly followed. Each  one, as it started upward, from a sudden impulse, contemptuously  saluted the abandoned nest with its excrement.    [Illustration: BARN SWALLOW AND NEST.]    Though generally regular in their habits and instincts, yet the birds  sometimes seem as whimsical and capricious as superior beings. One is  not safe, for instance, in making any absolute assertion as to their  place or mode of building. Ground builders often get up into a bush,  and tree builders sometimes get upon the ground or into a tussock of  grass. The song-sparrow, which is a ground builder, has been known to  build in the knot-hole of a fence rail, and a chimney swallow once got  tired of soot and smoke, and fastened its nest on a rafter in a hay  barn. A friend tells me of a pair of barn swallows which, taking a  fanciful turn, saddled their nest in the loop of a rope that was  pendent from a peg in the peak, and liked it so well that they  repeated the experiment next year. I have known the social sparrow, or  \"hair bird,\" to build under a shed, in a tuft of hay that hung down,  through the loose flooring, from the mow above. It usually contents  itself with a half a dozen stalks of dry grass and a few long hairs  from a cow's tail, loosely arranged on the branch of an apple-tree.  The rough-winged swallow builds in the wall and in old stone heaps,  and I have seen the robin build in similar localities. Others have  found its nest in old, abandoned wells. The house wren will build in  anything that has an accessible cavity, from an old boot to a  bombshell. A pair of them once persisted in building their nest in the  top of a certain pump-tree, getting in through the opening above the  handle. The pump being in daily use, the nest was destroyed more than  a score of times. This jealous little wretch has the wise forethought,  when the box in which he builds contains two compartments, to fill up  one of them, so as to avoid the risk of troublesome neighbors.    The less skilful builders sometimes depart from their usual habit, and  take up with the abandoned nest of some other species. The blue-jay  now and then lays in an old crow's-nest or cuckoo's-nest. The  crow-blackbird, seized with a fit of indolence, drops its eggs in the  cavity of a decayed branch. I heard of a cuckoo that dispossessed a  robin of its nest; of another that set a blue-jay adrift. Large, loose  structures, like the nests of the osprey and certain of the herons,  have been found with half a dozen nests of the blackbird set in the  outer edges, like so many parasites, or, as Audubon says, like the  retainers about the rude court of a feudal baron.    [Illustration: BALTIMORE ORIOLE AND NEST.]    The same birds breeding in a southern climate construct far less  elaborate nests than when breeding in a northern climate. Certain  species of water-fowl that abandon their eggs to the sand and the sun  in the warmer zones, build a nest and sit in the usual way in  Labrador. In Georgia, the Baltimore oriole places its nest upon the  north side of the tree; in the Middle and Eastern States, it fixes it  upon the south or east side, and makes it much thicker and Warner. I  have seen one from the South that had some kind-of coarse reed or  sedge woven into it, giving it an open-work appearance, like a  basket.    Very few species use the same material uniformly. I have seen the nest  of the robin quite destitute of mud. In one instance, it was composed  mainly of long, black horse-hairs, arranged in a circular manner, with  a lining of fine yellow grass; the whole presenting quite a novel  appearance. In another case, the nest was chiefly constructed of a  species of rock moss.    The nest for the second brood during the same season is often a mere  make-shift. The haste of the female to deposit her eggs as the season  advances seems very great, and the structure is apt to be prematurely  finished. I was recently reminded of this fact by happening, about the  last of July, to meet with several nests of the wood or bush sparrow  in a remote blackberry field. The nests with eggs were far less  elaborate and compact than the earlier nests, from which the young had  flown.    Day after day, as I go to a certain piece of woods, I observe a male  indigo-bird sitting on precisely the same part of a high branch, and  singing in his most vivacious style. "]]]
