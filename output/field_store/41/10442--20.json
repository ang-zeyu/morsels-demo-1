When  I sot down to dat weddin' supper I flung de chicken bones over my  shoulder, 'cause I didn't know no better. I don't 'member what gals  played when I was little, but boys played ball all day long if dey was  'lowed to. One boy, named Sam, played and run so hard he tuk his bed  Monday and never got up no more.    \"I heared tell of Raw Haid and Bloody Bones. Old folkses would skeer us  most nigh to death tellin' us he was comin'. Mankind! Us made for de  house den. Missy, please mam, don't ax me 'bout dem ha'nts. I sees 'em  all de time. Atter she had done died out, Old Miss used to come back all  de time. She didn't lak it 'cause day wropped her in a windin' sheet and  buried her by de doorsteps, but I reckon dey done fixed her by now,  'cause she don't come back no more. Dere's a house in Athens, called de  Bell House, dat nobody kin live in, 'cause a man run his wife from home  and atter she died, she come back and ha'nted dat house.    \"Lawd have mercy! Look here, don't talk lak dat. I ain't told you before  but part o' dis here yard is conjured. A man comes here early evvy  mornin' and dresses dis yard down wid conjuration. Soon as I sot down  here to talk to you, a pain started in my laigs, and it is done gone all  over me now. I started to leave you and go in de house. Come on. Let's  leave dis yard right now. Hurry!\" On reaching the kitchen Addie hastily  grasped the pepper box and shook its contents over each shoulder and on  her head, saying: \"Anything hot lak dis will sho drive dis spell away.  De reason I shakes lak I does, one day I was in de yard and somepin  cotch me. It helt fast to my footses, den I started to shake all over,  and I been shakin' ever since. A white 'oman gimme some white soap, and  evvy mornin' I washes myself good wid dat soap 'fore I puts on my  clothes.\"    Leaving the kitchen, Addie entered the front room which serves as a  bedroom. \"Lawdy, Missy!\" she exclaimed, \"Does you smell dat funny scent?  Oh, Good Lawd! Jus' look at dem white powders on my doorstep! Let me git  some hot water and wash 'em out quick! Now Missy, see how dese Niggers  'round here is allus up to deir meanness? Dere's a man in de udder room  bilin' his pizen right now. I has to keep a eye on him all de time or  dis here old Nigger would be in her grave. I has to keep somepin hot all  de time to keep off dem conjure spells. I got three pids of pepper most  ready to pick, and I'se gwine to tie 'em 'round my neck, den dese here  spells folkses is all de time tryin' to put on me won't do me no harm.\"    Addie now lowered her voice to a stage whisper. \"I found a folded up  piece of white paper under our back doorstep dis very mornin'. Bless  your life, I got a stick from de kitchen quick and poked it in a crack  in de steps and got it out 'fore I put my foots down on dem steps. I sho  did.\"    Here Addie reverted to her story of the plantation. \"Old Marster was  mighty good to his Niggers,\" she said. When any of 'em got sick Old Miss  sont to town for him, and he allus come right out and fetched a doctor.  Old Miss done her very best for Pappy when he was tuk sick, but he died  out jus' de same. Pappy used to drive a oxcart and, when he was bad off  sick and out of his haid, he hollered out: 'Scotch dat wheel! Scotch dat  wheel!' In his mind, he was deep in de bad place den, and didn't know  how to pray. Old Miss, she would say: 'Pray, Pete, Pray.' Old Miss made  a heap of teas from diff'unt things lak pennyroyal, algaroba wood,  sassafras, flat tobacco, and mullein. Us wore rabbits foots, little bags  of asfiddy (asafetida), and garlic tabs 'round our necks to keep off  mis'ries. I wishes I had a garlic tab to wear 'round my neck now.    \"One day Old Miss called us togedder and told us dat us was free as jay  birds. De Niggers started hollerin': 'Thank de Lawd, us is free as de  jay birds.' 'Bout dat time a white man come along and told dem Niggers  if he heared 'em say dat again he would kill de last one of 'em. Old  Miss axed us to stay on wid her and dar us stayed for 'bout three years.  It paid us to stay dere 'stead of runnin' off lak some udder Niggars dat  played de fool done. T'warn't long 'fore dem Yankees come 'long, and us  hustled off to town to see what dey looked lak. I never seed so many  mens at one time in my life before. When us got back to de plantation de  overseer told us not to drink no water out of de well, 'cause somebody  had done put a peck of pizen in dar. He flung a whole bushel of salt in  de well to help git rid of de pizen.    \"Atter de end of de war, I went to wuk as a plow-hand. I sho did keep  out of de way of dem Ku Kluxers. Folkses would see 'em comin' and holler  out: 'De Ku Kluxers is ridin' tonight. Keep out of deir way, or dey will  sho kill you.' Dem what was skeered of bein' cotched and beat up, done  deir best to stay out of sight.    \"It was a long time atter de war was done over 'fore schools for Niggers  was sot up, and den when Nigger chillun did git to go to school dey  warn't 'lowed to use de old blue-back spellin' book 'cause white folkses  said it larn't 'em too much.    \"It was two or three years atter de war 'fore any of de Niggers could  save up enough money to start buyin' land, and den, if dey didn't watch  dey steps mighty keerful, de white folkses would find a way to git dat  land back from de Niggers.    \"What! Is I got to tell you 'bout dat old Nigger I got married up wid? I  don't want to talk 'bout dat low down, no 'count devil. Anyhow, I  married Ed Griffeth and, sho dat, I had a weddin'. My weddin' dress was  jus' de purtiest thing; it was made out of parade cloth, and it had a  full skirt wid ruffles from de knees to de hem. De waist fitted tight  and it was cut lowneck wid three ruffles 'round de shoulder. Dem puff  sleeves was full from de elbow to de hand. All dem ruffles was aidged  wid lace and, 'round my waist I wore a wide pink sash. De underskirt was  trimmed wid lace, and dere was lace on de bottom of de drawers laigs.  Dat was sho one purty outfit dat I wore to marry dat no 'count man in. I  had bought dat dress from my young Mist'ess.    \"Us had seven chillun and ten grandchillun. Most of 'em is livin' off up  in Detroit. If Ed ain't daid by now he ought to be; he was a good match  for de devil.    \"I reckon Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Jeff Davis done right as fur as dey knowed  how and could. If dem northern folkses hadn't fotched us here, us sho  wouldn't never have been here in de fust place. Den dey hauled off and  said de South was mean to us Niggers and sot us free, but I don't know  no diffunce. De North sho let us be atter dat war, and some of de old  Niggers is still mad 'cause dey is free and ain't got no Marster to feed  'em and give 'em good warm clothes no more.    \"Oh! You gits happy when you jines up wid de church. I sho don't want to  go to de bad place. Dere ain't but two places to go to, Heaven and hell,  and I'se tryin' to head for Heaven. Folkses says dat when Old Dives done  so bad he had to go to de bad place, a dog was sot at his heels for to  keep him in dar. No Mam, if it's de Good Lawd's will to let me git to  Heaven, I is sho gwine to keep out of hell, if I kin.    \"Goodbye, Missy. Next time you comes fetch me a garlic tab to keep de  conjure spells 'way from me,\" was Addie's parting request.          PLANTATION LIFE AS VIEWED BY AN EX-SLAVE    EMMA VIRGEL, Age 73  1491 W.

[Date Stamp: MAY 13 1938]      Hurrying for shelter from a sudden shower, the interviewer heard a  cheerful voice singing \"Lord I'se Comin' Home,\" as she rushed up the  steps of Aunt Emma's small cabin. Until the song was ended she quietly  waited on the tiny porch and looked out over the yard which was  attractive with roses and other old-fashioned flowers; then she knocked  on the door.    Dragging footsteps and the tap, tap of a crutch sounded as Aunt Emma  approached the door. \"Come in out of dat rain, chile, or you sho' will  have de pneumony,\" she said. \"Come right on in and set here by my fire.  Fire feels mighty good today. I had to build it to iron de white folkses  clothes.\" Aunt Emma leaned heavily on her crutch as she wielded the iron  with a dexterity attainable only by long years of experience. Asked if  her lameness and use of a crutch made her work difficult, she grinned  and answered: \"Lawsy chile, I'se jus' so used to it, I don't never think  'bout it no more. I'se had to wuk all of my life, no matter what was in  de way.\" The comfort, warmth and cheer of the small kitchen encouraged  intimate conversation and when Aunt Emma was asked for the story of her  childhood days and her recollections of slavery, she replied: \"I was too  little to 'member much, but I'se heared my Ma tell 'bout dem days.    \"My Pa and Ma was Louis and Mary Jackson. Dey b'longed to Marse John  Montgomery, way down in Oconee County. Marse John didn't have no wife  den, 'cause he didn't git married 'til atter de War. He had a big place  wid lots of slaves. He was sho' good to 'em, and let 'em have plenty of  evvything. De slave quarters was log cabins wid big fireplaces, whar dey  done de cookin'. Dey had racks to hang pots on to bile and dey baked in  ovens set on de harth (hearth). Dat was powerful good eatin'. Dey had a  big old gyarden whar dey raised plenty of corn, peas, cabbages,  potatoes, collards, and turnip greens. Out in de fields dey growed  mostly corn, wheat, and cotton. Marster kep' lots of chickens, cows,  hogs, goats, and sheep; and he fed 'em all mighty good.    \"Marster let his slaves dance, and my Ma was sho' one grand dancer in  all de breakdown's.

This farm, now a classic spot, is  about six miles up the river from Dumfries; it extends to upwards of a  hundred acres: the soil is kindly; the holmland portion of it loamy  and rich, and it has at command fine walks on the river side, and  views of the Friar's Carse, Cowehill, and Dalswinton. For a while the  poet had to hide his head in a smoky hovel; till a house to his fancy,  and offices for his cattle and his crops were built, his accommodation  was sufficiently humble; and his mind taking its hue from his  situation, infused a bitterness into the letters in which he first  made known to his western friends that he had fixed his abode in  Nithsdale. \"I am here,\" said he, \"at the very elbow of existence: the  only things to be found in perfection in this country are stupidity  and canting; prose they only know in graces and prayers, and the value  of these they estimate as they do their plaiden-webs, by the ell: as  for the muses, they have as much an idea of a rhinoceros as of a  poet.\" \"This is an undiscovered clime,\" he at another period exclaims,  \"it is unknown to poetry, and prose never looked on it save in drink.  I sit by the fire, and listen to the hum of the spinning-wheel: I  hear, but cannot see it, for it is hidden in the smoke which eddies  round and round me before it seeks to escape by window and door. I  have no converse but with the ignorance which encloses me: No kenned  face but that of my old mare, Jenny Geddes--my life is dwindled down  to mere existence.\"    When the poet's new house was built and plenished, and the atmosphere  of his mind began to clear, he found the land to be fruitful, and its  people intelligent and wise. In Riddel, of Friar's Carse, he found a  scholar and antiquarian; in Miller, of Dalswinton, a man conversant  with science as well as with the world; in M'Murdo, of Drumlanrig, a  generous and accomplished gentleman; and in John Syme, of Ryedale, a  man much after his own heart, and a lover of the wit and socialities  of polished life. Of these gentlemen Riddel, who was his neighbour,  was the favourite: a door was made in the march-fence which separated  Ellisland from Friar's Carse, that the poet might indulge in the  retirement of the Carse hermitage, a little lodge in the wood, as  romantic as it was beautiful, while a pathway was cut through the  dwarf oaks and birches which fringed the river bank, to enable the  poet to saunter and muse without lot or interruption. This attention  was rewarded by an inscription for the hermitage, written with  elegance as well as feeling, and which was the first fruits of his  fancy in this unpoetic land. In a happier strain he remembered Matthew  Henderson: this is one of the sweetest as well as happiest of his  poetic compositions. He heard of his friend's death, and called on  nature animate and inanimate, to lament the loss of one who held the  patent of his honours from God alone, and who loved all that was pure  and lovely and good. \"The Whistle\" is another of his Ellisland  compositions: the contest which he has recorded with such spirit and  humour took place almost at his door: the heroes were Fergusson, of  Craigdarroch, Sir Robert Laurie, of Maxwelltown, and Riddel, of the  Friar's Carse: the poet was present, and drank bottle and bottle about  with the best, and when all was done he seemed much disposed, as an  old servant at Friar's Carse remembered, to take up the victor.    Burns had become fully reconciled to Nithsdale, and was on the most  intimate terms with the muse when he produced Tam O' Shanter, the  crowning glory of all his poems. For this marvellous tale we are  indebted to something like accident: Francis Grose, the antiquary,  happened to visit Friar's Carse, and as he loved wine and wit, the  total want of imagination was no hinderance to his friendly  intercourse with the poet: \"Alloway's auld haunted kirk\" was  mentioned, and Grose said he would include it in his illustrations of  the antiquities of Scotland, if the bard of the Doon would write a  poem to accompany it. Burns consented, and before he left the table,  the various traditions which belonged to the ruin were passing through  his mind. One of these was of a farmer, who, on a night wild with  wind and rain, on passing the old kirk was startled by a light  glimmering inside the walls; on drawing near he saw a caldron hung  over a fire, in which the heads and limbs of children were simmering:  there was neither witch nor fiend to guard it, so he unhooked the  caldron, turned out the contents, and carried it home as a trophy. A  second tradition was of a man of Kyle, who, having been on a market  night detained late in Ayr, on crossing the old bridge of Doon, on his  way home, saw a light streaming through the gothic window of Alloway  kirk, and on riding near, beheld a batch of the district witches  dancing merrily round their master, the devil, who kept them \"louping  and flinging\" to the sound of a bagpipe. He knew several of the old  crones, and smiled at their gambols, for they were dancing in their  smocks: but one of them, and she happened to be young and rosy, had on  a smock shorter than those of her companions by two spans at least,  which so moved the farmer that he exclaimed, \"Weel luppan, Maggie wi'  the short sark!\" Satan stopped his music, the light was extinguished,  and out rushed the hags after the farmer, who made at the gallop for  the bridge of Doon, knowing that they could not cross a stream: he  escaped; but Maggie, who was foremost, seized his horse's tail at the  middle of the bridge, and pulled it off in her efforts to stay him.    This poem was the work of a single day: Burns walked out to his  favourite musing path, which runs towards the old tower of the Isle,  along Nithside, and was observed to walk hastily and mutter as he  went. His wife knew by these signs that he was engaged in composition,  and watched him from the window; at last wearying, and moreover  wondering at the unusual length of his meditations, she took her  children with her and went to meet him; but as he seemed not to see  her, she stept aside among the broom to allow him to pass, which he  did with a flushed brow and dropping eyes, reciting these lines  aloud:--        \"Now Tam! O, Tum! had thae been queans,      A' plump and strapping in their teens,      Their sacks, instead o' creeshie flannen,      Been snaw-white seventeen hunder linen!      Thir breeks o' mine, my only pair,      That ance were plush, o' gude blue hair,      I wad hae gien them off my hurdies,      For ae blink o' the bonnie burdies!\"    He embellished this wild tradition from fact as well as from fancy:  along the road which Tam came on that eventful night his memory  supplied circumstances which prepared him for the strange sight at the  kirk of Alloway. A poor chapman had perished, some winters before, in  the snow; a murdered child had been found by some early hunters; a  tippling farmer had fallen from his horse at the expense of his neck,  beside a \"meikle stane\"; and a melancholy old woman had hanged herself  at the bush aboon the well, as the poem relates: all these matters the  poet pressed into the service of the muse, and used them with a skill  which adorns rather than oppresses the legend. A pert lawyer from  Dumfries objected to the language as obscure: \"Obscure, sir!\" said  Burns; \"you know not the language of that great master of your own  art--the devil. If you had a witch for your client you would not be  able to manage her defence!\"    He wrote few poems after his marriage, but he composed many songs: the  sweet voice of Mrs. Burns and the craving of Johnson's Museum will in  some measure account for the number, but not for their variety, which  is truly wonderful. In the history of that mournful strain, \"Mary in  Heaven,\" we read the story of many of his lyrics, for they generally  sprang from his personal feelings: no poet has put more of himself  into his poetry than Burns, \"Robert, though ill of a cold,\" said his  wife, \"had been busy all day--a day of September, 1789, with the  shearers in the field, and as he had got most of the corn into the  stack-yard, was in good spirits; but when twilight came he grew sad  about something, and could not rest: he wandered first up the  waterside, and then went into the stack-yard: I followed, and begged  him to come into the house, as he was ill, and the air was sharp and  cold. He said, 'Ay, ay,' but did not come: he threw himself down on  some loose sheaves, and lay looking at the sky, and particularly at a  large, bright star, which shone like another moon. At last, but that  was long after I had left him, he came home--the song was already  composed.\" To the memory of Mary"]]]
