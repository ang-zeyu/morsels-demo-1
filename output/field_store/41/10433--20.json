A magnificent Stradivarius violin, with an  exceedingly romantic history, belongs to Carl Gaertner, the veteran  violinist and musician of Philadelphia, and could not be purchased at  any price.    Another violin-builder from Nicolo Amati's workshop was Andrea  Guarnerius (1630-1695), whose sons, Giuseppe and Pietro, followed in his  footsteps. The family name reached its highest distinction in his  nephew, Giuseppe (Joseph) Guarnerius (1683-1745), called del Gesu,  because on his labels the initials I. H. S., surmounted by a Roman  cross, were placed after his name, indicating that he belonged to a  Jesuit society.    This Joseph of Cremona figures in story as a man of fascinating,  restless personality, who for weeks would squander time and talents and  then set to work with a zeal equalling that of Master Stradivarius.  Tradition has it that he was once imprisoned for some bit of  lawlessness, and was saved from despair by the jailor's daughter who  brought him the tools and materials required for violin-building. What  he esteemed the masterpiece of his lonely cell he presented as a  souvenir to his gentle friend.    The violin about which this legend is woven, dated 1742, was bought by  Ole Bull from the famous Tarisio collection, and is now the property of  his son, Mr. Alexander Bull. It has an unusually rich, sonorous tone and  splendid carrying powers. Similar qualities are attributed to the  Paganini Guarnerius del Gesu, 1743, known as the \"Canon\" and kept under  glass at the Genoa Museum. Mr. Hart, a violin authority, places highest  in this make the \"King Joseph,\" 1737, long in the private collections of  Mr. Hawley, Hartford, Connecticut, and of Mr. Ralph Granger, Paradise  Valley, California, and recently put on the market by Lyon & Healy, of  Chicago.    An interesting Nicolo Amati pupil was Jacob Steiner (1621-1683), a  Tyrolese, who, although bearing a glittering title, \"violin maker to the  Austrian Emperor,\" was harassed with financial perplexities and died  insane. His most noted violins were the sixteen \"Elector Steiners,\" one  sent to each of the Electors and four to the Emperor. During his life  the average price of his violins was six florins. A century after his  death the Duke of Orleans, Louis Philippe's grandfather, paid 3,500  florins for one of them. It is also recorded that an American gentleman  on La Fayette's staff, in the Revolutionary War, exchanged for a Steiner  1,500 acres of the tract where Pittsburg now stands. Mozart's violin, in  the Mozarteum at Salzburg, is a Steiner.    Many violin-makers did good work in the past, many are achieving success  to-day. It has been confidently asserted that the violin reached its  highest possibilities in the old Brescian and Cremona days. Why should  this be the case? The same well-defined principles, based on acoustics  and other modern sciences, that have led to the steady improvement of  other musical instruments ought surely to be of some advantage to the  violin. Indeed, who knows but the day may come when the present will be  considered its golden age.    While the men of Cremona were still fashioning their models the want of  good strings was felt. This was met by Angelo Angelucci, known as the  string-maker of Naples, a man who loved music and passed much time with  violinists. Through his painstaking efforts such perfection was reached  that Tartini, who was born the same year as he, 1692, could play his  most difficult compositions two hundred times on the Angelucci strings,  whereas he was continually interrupted by the snapping of others.  Improvements in the bow, often called the tongue of the violin, are due  to the house of Tourte, in Paris, in the eighteenth century, lightness,  elasticity and spring coming to it from Francis Tourte, Jr.    Three eminent virtuosi, Corelli, Tartini and Viotti, whose united  careers spanned a period of 150 years, prepared the way for modern  methods of violin-playing. Arcangelo Corelli (1653-1713) left his home  in Fusignano, near Bologna, a young violinist, for an extended concert  tour. His gentle, sensitive disposition proving unfitted to cope with  the jealousy of Lully, chief violinist in France, and with sundry  annoyances in other lands, he returned to Italy and entered the service  of Cardinal Ottoboni in Rome. In the private apartments of the prelate  there gathered a choice company of music lovers every Monday afternoon  to hear his latest compositions. Besides his solos these comprised  groups of idealized dance tunes with harmony of mood for their bond of  union, and played by two violins, a viola, violoncello and harpsichord.  They were the parents of modern Chamber Music, the place of assemblage  furnishing the name.    Refined taste and purity of tone, we are told, distinguished the playing  of Corelli, and to him are attributed the systematization of bowing and  the introduction of chord-playing. He heads the list of musicians who  protest against talking where there is music. On one occasion when his  patron was addressing some remarks to another person, he laid down his  violin, and on being asked the reason said \"he feared the music was  disturbing the conversation.\" This did not prevent him from being held  in the highest esteem. After his death Cardinal Ottoboni had a costly  monument erected over his grave in the Pantheon, and for many years a  solemn service, consisting of selections from his works, was performed  there on the anniversary of his funeral.    It was during a period of retirement in the monastery of Assisi that  Giuseppi Tartini (1692-1770) resolved to quit the law course in the  University of Padua and seek a career with his violin. He became a great  master of this, a composer of works still regarded as classics, and a  scientific writer on musical physics. His letter to his pupil, Signora  Maddelena Lombardini, contains invaluable advice on violin practice and  study, especially on the use of the bow, and his treatise on the  acoustic phenomenon known as \"the third sound,\" together with his work  on musical embellishments, may at any time be read with profit.    It was after hearing the eccentric violinist Veracini that His Satanic  Majesty appeared to Tartini in a dream and played for him a violin solo  surpassing in marvelous character anything that he had ever heard or  imagined. Trying to write it down in the morning he produced his famous  \"Devil's Sonata,\" with its double shakes and sinister laugh, a favorite  of the violinist, but to the composer ever inferior to the music of his  dreams. It is rather curious that anything of a diabolic nature should  be associated with this man of amiable and gentle disposition, whose  care of his scholars, according to Dr. Burney, was constantly paternal.  Nardini, his favorite and most famous pupil, came from Leghorn to Padua  to attend him, with filial devotion, in his last illness.    The talents of Corelli and Tartini seem to have been combined in the  Piedmontese, Giovanni Battiste Viotti (1753-1824), a man of poetic,  philanthropic mind, whose sensitive, retiring disposition unfitted him  for public life. Wherever he appeared he outshone all other performers,  yet there was constantly something occurring to wound him. At the Court  of Versailles he left the platform in disgust because the noisy entrance  of a distinguished guest interrupted his concerto. In London, after his  means had been crippled by the French Revolution, he was accused of  political intrigue.    While living in seclusion near Hamburg he composed some of his finest  works, among them six violin duets, which he prefaced with the words:  \"This work is the fruit of leisure afforded me by misfortune. Some of  the pieces were dictated by trouble, others by hope.\" At one time he  embarked in a mercantile enterprise, in London, his transactions being  regulated by the strictest integrity, but, as was inevitable, he soon  returned to Paris and his art. After he had abandoned the concert room  one of his greatest pleasures was in improvising violin parts to the  piano performances of his friend, Madame Montegerault, to the delight  of all present. He never had more than seven or eight pupils, but his  influence has been widely felt. Many anecdotes are told of his kindness  and generosity, and it is an interesting fact that among those who  sought his advice and patronage was no less a personage than Rossini.    It must be because genius is little understood that its manifestations  have so often been attributed to evil influences. The popular mind could  only explain the achievements of the Genoese wizard of the bow, Nicolo  Paganini (1784-1840) by the belief that he had sold himself body and  soul to the devil who stood ever at his elbow when he played. When,  after a taxing concert season, the weary violinist retired to a Swiss  monastery for rest and practice amid peaceful surroundings, rumor had it  that he was imprisoned for some dark deed. To crown the delusion, his  spectre was long supposed to stalk abroad, giving fantastic performances  on the violin. It is his apparition Gilbert Parker conjures up in \"The  Tall Master.\"    Paganini is described as a man of tall, gaunt figure, melancholy  countenance and highly wrought nervous temperament. His successors have  all profited by his development of the violin's resources, the result of  combined genius and labor. He was practically a pioneer in the effective  use of chords, arpeggio passages, octaves and tenths, double and triple  harmonics and succession of harmonics in thirds and in sixths. His long  fingers were of invaluable service to him in unusual stretches, and his  fondness for pizzicato passages may be traced to his familiarity with  the twang of his father's mandolin. He shone chiefly in his own  compositions, which were written in keys"]]]
