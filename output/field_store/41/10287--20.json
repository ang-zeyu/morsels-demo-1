Follow me, and I will show you.\" The sultan  then took Aladdin into the apartment from whence he was wont to look at  and admire his palace, and said, \"You ought to know where your palace  stood; look, mind, and tell me what has become of it.\" Aladdin did so,  and being utterly amazed at the loss of his palace, was speechless. At  last recovering himself, he said, \"It is true, I do not see the palace.  It is vanished; but I had no concern in its removal. I beg you to give  me forty days, and if in that time I cannot restore it, I will offer my  head to be disposed of at your pleasure.\" \"I give you the time you ask,  but at the end of the forty days, forget not to present yourself before  me.\"    Aladdin went out of the sultan's palace in a condition of exceeding  humiliation. The lords who had courted him in the days of his splendour,  now declined to have any communication with him. For three days he  wandered about the city, exciting the wonder and compassion of the  multitude by asking everybody he met if they had seen his palace, or  could tell him anything of it. On the third day he wandered into the  country, and as he was approaching a river, he fell down the bank with  so much violence that he rubbed the ring which the magician had given  him so hard by holding on the rock to save himself, that immediately the  same genie appeared whom he had seen in the cave where the magician had  left him. \"What wouldst thou have?\" said the genie, \"I am ready to obey  thee as thy slave, and the slave of all those that have that ring on  their finger; both I and the other slaves of the ring.\"    Aladdin, agreeably surprised at an offer of help so little expected,  replied, \"Genie, show me where the palace I caused to be built now  stands, or transport it back where it first stood.\" \"Your command,\"  answered the genie, \"is not wholly in my power; I am only the slave of  the ring, and not of the lamp.\" \"I command thee, then,\" replied Aladdin,  \"by the power of the ring, to transport me to the spot where my palace  stands, in what part of the world soever it may be.\" These words were no  sooner out of his mouth, than the genie transported him into Africa, to  the midst of a large plain, where his palace stood, at no great distance  from a city, and placing him exactly under the window of the princess's  apartment, left him.    Now it so happened that shortly after Aladdin had been transported by  the slave of the ring to the neighbourhood of his palace, that one of  the attendants of the Princess Buddir al Buddoor, looking through the  window, perceived him and instantly told her mistress. The princess, who  could not believe the joyful tidings, hastened herself to the window,  and seeing Aladdin, immediately opened it. The noise of opening the  window made Aladdin turn his head that way, and perceiving the princess,  he saluted her with an air that expressed his joy. \"To lose no time,\"  said she to him, \"I have sent to have the private door opened for you;  enter and come up.\"    The private door, which was just under the princess's apartment, was  soon opened, and Aladdin conducted up into the chamber. It is impossible  to express the joy of both at seeing each other, after so cruel a  separation. After embracing and shedding tears of joy, they sat down,  and Aladdin said, \"I beg of you, princess, to tell me what is become of  an old lamp which stood upon a shelf in my robing-chamber.\"    \"Alas!\" answered the princess, \"I was afraid our misfortune might be  owing to that lamp; and what grieves me most is, that I have been the  cause of it. I was foolish enough to change the old lamp for a new one,  and the next morning I found myself in this unknown country, which I am  told is Africa.\"    \"Princess,\" said Aladdin, interrupting her, \"you have explained all by  telling me we are in Africa I desire you only to tell me if you know  where the old lamp now is.\" \"The African magician carries it carefully  wrapt up in his bosom,\" said the princess; \"and this I can assure you,  because he pulled it out before me, and showed it to me in triumph.\"    \"Princess,\" said Aladdin, \"I think I have found the means to deliver you  and to regain possession of the lamp, on which all my prosperity  depends; to execute this design it is necessary for me to go to the  town. I shall return by noon, and will then tell you what must be done  by you to insure success. In the mean time, I shall disguise myself, and  beg that the private door may be opened at the first knock.\"    When Aladdin was out of the palace, he looked round him on all sides,  and perceiving a peasant going into the country, hastened after him; and  when he had overtaken him, made a proposal to him to change clothes,  which the man agreed to. When they had made the exchange, the countryman  went about his business, and Aladdin entered the neighbouring city.  After traversing several streets, he came to that part of the town where  the merchants and artisans had their particular streets according to  their trades. He went into that of the druggists; and entering one of  the largest and best furnished shops, asked the druggist if he had a  certain powder, which he named.    The druggist, judging Aladdin by his habit to be very poor, told him he  had it, but that it was very dear; upon which Aladdin, penetrating his  thoughts, pulled out his purse, and showing him some gold, asked for  half a dram of the powder; which the druggist weighed and gave him,  telling him the price was a piece of gold. Aladdin put the money into  his hand, and hastened to the palace, which he entered at once by the  private door. When he came into the princess's apartments, he said to  her, \"Princess, you must take your part in the scheme which I propose  for our deliverance. You must overcome your aversion to the magician,  and assume a most friendly manner toward him, and ask him to oblige you  by partaking of an entertainment in your apartments. Before he leaves,  ask him to exchange cups with you, which he, gratified at the honour you  do him, will gladly do, when you must give him the cup containing this  powder. On drinking it he will instantly fall asleep, and we will obtain  the lamp, whose slaves will do all our bidding, and restore us and the  palace to the capital of China.\"    The princess obeyed to the utmost her husband's instructions. She  assumed a look of pleasure on the next visit of the magician, and asked  him to an entertainment, which he most willingly accepted. At the close  of the evening, during which the princess had tried all she could to  please him, she asked him to exchange cups with her, and giving the  signal, had the drugged cup brought to her, which she gave to the  magician. He drank it out of compliment to the princess to the very last  drop, when he fell backward lifeless on the sofa.    The princess, in anticipation of the success of her scheme, had so  placed her women from the great hall to the foot of the staircase, that  the word was no sooner given that the African magician was fallen  backward, than the door was opened, and Aladdin admitted to the hall.  The princess rose from her seat, and ran, overjoyed, to embrace him; but  he stopped her, and said, \"Princess, retire to your apartment; and let  me be left alone, while I endeavour to transport you back to China as  speedily as you were brought from thence.\"    When the princess, her women, and slaves were gone out of the hall,  Aladdin shut the door, and going directly to the dead body of the  magician, opened his vest, took out the lamp which was carefully wrapped  up, and rubbing it, the genie immediately appeared. \"Genie,\" said  Aladdin, \"I command thee to transport this palace instantly to the place  from whence it was brought hither.\" The genie bowed his head in token of  obedience, and disappeared. Immediately the palace was transported into  China, and its removal was only felt by two little shocks, the one when  it was lifted up, the other when it was set down, and both in a very  short interval of time.    On the morning after the restoration of Aladdin's palace, the sultan was  looking out of his window, and mourning over the fate of his daughter,  when he thought that he saw the vacancy created by the disappearance of  the palace to be again filled up.    On looking more attentively, he was convinced beyond the power of doubt  that it was his son-in-law's palace. Joy and gladness succeeded to  sorrow and grief. He at once ordered a horse to be saddled, which he  mounted that instant, thinking he could not make haste enough to the  place.    Aladdin rose that morning by daybreak, put on one of the most  magnificent habits his wardrobe afforded, and went up into the hall of  twenty-four windows, from whence he perceived the sultan approaching,  and received him at the foot of the great staircase, helping him to  dismount.    He led the sultan into the princess's apartment. The happy father  embraced her with tears of joy; and the princess, on her side, afforded  similar testimonies of her extreme pleasure. After a short interval,  devoted to mutual explanations of all that had happened, the sultan  restored Aladdin to his favour, and expressed his regret for the  apparent harshness with which he had treated him. \"My son,\" said he, \"be  not displeased at my proceedings against you; they arose from my  paternal love, and therefore you ought to forgive the excesses to which  it hurried me.\" \"Sire,\" replied Aladdin, \"I have not the least reason to  complain of your conduct, since you did nothing but what your duty  required. This infamous magician, the basest of men, was the sole cause  of my misfortune.\"    The African magician, who was thus twice foiled in his endeavour to ruin  Aladdin, had a younger brother, who was as skilful a magician as  himself, and exceeded him in wickedness and hatred of mankind. By mutual  agreement they communicated with each other once a year, however"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1493"],[0,"The Legends of the Jews — Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"penitence? How couldst thou let our adversary seduce thee  again--him who robbed us of our sojourn in Paradise and all  spiritual joy?\" Thereupon Eve, too, began to weep and cry out:  \"Woe unto thee, O Satan! Why strivest thou against us without any  reason? What have we done unto thee that thou shouldst pursue us  so craftily?\" With a deep-fetched sigh, Satan told them how that  Adam, of whom he had been jealous, had been the real reason of  his fall. Having lost his glory through him, he had intrigued to  have him driven from Paradise.    When Adam heard the confession of Satan, he prayed to God: \"O  Lord my God! In Thy hands is my life. Remove from me this  adversary, who seeks to deliver my soul to destruction, and grant  me the glory he has forfeited.\" Satan disappeared forthwith, but  Adam continued his penance, standing in the waters of the Jordan  for forty days.[106]    While Adam stood in the river, he noticed that the days were  growing shorter, and he feared the world might be darkened on  account of his sin, and go under soon. To avert the doom, he  spent eight days in prayer and fasting. But after the winter  solstice, when he saw that the days grew longer again, he spent  eight days in rejoicing, and in the following year he celebrated  both periods, the one before and the one after the solstice. This  is why the heathen celebrate the calends and the saturnalia in  honor of their gods, though Adam had consecrated those days to  the honor of God.[107]    The first time Adam witnessed the sinking of the sun be was also  seized with anxious fears. It happened at the conclusion of the  Sabbath, and Adam said, \"Woe is me! For my sake, because I  sinned, the world is darkened, and it will again become void and  without form. Thus will be executed the punishment of death which  God has pronounced against me!\" All the night he spent in tears,  and Eve, too, wept as she sat opposite to him. When day began to  dawn, he understood that what he had deplored was but the course  of nature, and he brought an offering unto God, a unicorn whose  horn was created before his hoofs,[108] and he sacrificed it on  the spot on which later the altar was to stand in Jerusalem.[109]      THE BOOK OF RAZIEL    After Adam's expulsion from Paradise, he prayed to God in these  words: \"O God, Lord of the world! Thou didst create the whole  world unto the honor and glory of the Mighty One, and Thou didst  as was pleasing unto Thee. Thy kingdom is unto all eternity, and  Thy reign unto all generations. Naught is hidden from Thee, and  naught is concealed from Thine eyes. Thou didst create me as Thy  handiwork, and didst make me the ruler over Thy creatures, that I  might be the chief of Thy works. But the cunning, accursed  serpent seduced me with the tree of desire and lusts, yea, he  seduced the wife of my bosom. But Thou didst not make known unto  me what shall befall my children and the generations after me. I  know well that no human being can be righteous in Thine eyes, and  what is my strength that I should step before Thee with an  impudent face? I have no mouth wherewith to speak and no eye  wherewith to see, for I did sin and commit a trespass, and, by  reason of my sins, I was driven forth from Paradise. I must  plough the earth whence I was taken, and the other inhabitants of  the earth, the beasts, no longer, as once, stand in awe and fear  of me. From the time I ate of the tree of knowledge of good and  evil, wisdom departed from me, and I am a fool that knoweth  naught, an ignorant man that understandeth not. Now, O merciful  and gracious God, I pray to Thee to turn again Thy compassion to  the head of Thy works, to the spirit which Thou didst instil into  him, and the soul Thou didst breathe into him. Meet me with Thy  grace, for Thou art gracious, slow to anger, and full of love. O  that my prayer would reach unto the throne of Thy glory, and my  supplication unto the throne of Thy mercy, and Thou wouldst  incline to me with lovingkindness. May the words of my mouth be  acceptable, that Thou turn not away from my petition. Thou wert  from everlasting, and Thou wilt be unto everlasting; Thou wert  king, and Thou wilt ever be king. Now, have Thou mercy upon the  work of Thy hands. Grant me knowledge and understanding, that I  may know what shall befall me, and my posterity, and all the  generations that come after me, and what shall befall me on every  day and in every month, and mayest Thou not withhold from me the  help of Thy servants and of Thy angels.\"    On the third day after he had offered up this prayer, while he  was sitting on the banks of the river that flows forth out of  Paradise, there appeared to him, in the heat of the day, the  angel Raziel, bearing a book in his hand. The angel addressed  Adam thus: \"O Adam, why art thou so fainthearted? Why art thou  distressed and anxious? Thy words were heard at the moment when  thou didst utter thy supplication and entreaties, and I have  received the charge to teach thee pure words and deep  understanding, to make thee wise through the contents of the  sacred book in my hand, to know what will happen to thee until  the day of thy death. And all thy descendants and all the later  generations, if they will but read this book in purity, with a  devout heart and an humble mind, and obey its precepts, will  become like unto thee. They, too, will foreknow what things shall  happen, and in what month and on what day or in what night. All  will be manifest to them--they will know and understand whether a  calamity will come, a famine or wild beasts, floods or drought;  whether there will be abundance of grain or dearth; whether the  wicked will rule the world; whether locusts will devastate the  land; whether the fruits will drop from the trees unripe; whether  boils will afflict men; whether wars will prevail, or diseases or  plagues among men and cattle; whether good is resolved upon in  heaven, or evil; whether blood will flow, and the death-rattle of  the slain be heard in the city. And now, Adam, come and give heed  unto what I shall tell thee regarding the manner of this book and  its holiness.\"    Raziel, the angel, then read from the book, and when Adam heard  the words of the holy volume as they issued from the mouth of the  angel, he fell down affrighted. But the angel encouraged him.  \"Arise, Adam,\" he said, \"be of good courage, be not afraid, take  the book from me and keep it, for thou wilt draw knowledge from  it thyself and become wise, and thou wilt also teach its contents  to all those who shall be found worthy of knowing what it  contains.\"    In the moment when Adam took the book, a flame of fire shot up  from near the river, and the angel rose heavenward with it. Then  Adam knew that he who had spoken to him was an angel of God, and  it was from the Holy King Himself that the book had come, and he  used it in holiness and purity. It is the book out of which all  things worth knowing can be learnt, and all mysteries, and it  teaches also how to call upon the angels and make them appear  before men, and answer all their questions. But not all alike can  use the book, only he who is wise and God-fearing, and resorts to  it in holiness. Such an one is secure against all wicked  counsels, his life is serene, and when death takes him from this  world, he finds repose in a place where there are neither demons  nor evil spirits, and out of the hands of the wicked he is  quickly rescued.[110]      THE SICKNESS OF ADAM    When Adam had lived to be nine hundred and thirty years old, a  sickness seized him, and he felt that his days were drawing to an  end. He summoned all his descendants, and assembled them before  the door of the house of worship in which he had always offered  his prayers to God, to give them his last blessing. His family  were astonished to find him stretched out on the bed of sickness,  for they did not know what pain and suffering were.[111] They  thought he was overcome with longing after the fruits of  Paradise, and for lack of them was depressed. Seth announced his  willingness to go to the gates of Paradise and beg God to let one  of His angels give him of its fruits. But Adam explained to them  what sickness and pain are, and that God had inflicted them upon  him as a punishment for his sin.[112] Adam suffered violently;  tears and groans were wrung from him. Eve sobbed, and said,  \"Adam, my lord, give me the half of thy sickness, I will gladly  bear it. Is it not on account of me that this hath come upon  thee? On account of me thou undergoest pain and anguish.\"    Adam bade Eve go with Seth to the gates of Paradise and entreat  God to have mercy upon him, and send His angel to catch up some  of the oil of life flowing from the tree of His mercy and give it  to his messengers. The ointment would bring him rest, and banish  the pain consuming him. On his way to Paradise, Seth was attacked  by a wild beast. Eve called out to the assailant, \"How durst thou  lay hand on the image of God?\" The ready answer came: \"It is  thine own fault. Hadst thou not opened thy mouth to eat of the  forbidden fruit, my mouth would not be opened now to destroy a  human being.\" But Seth remonstrated: \"Hold thy tongue! Desist  from the image of God until the day of judgment.\" And the beast  gave way, saying, \"See, I refrain myself from the image of God,\"  and it slunk away to its covert.[113]    Arrived at the gates of Paradise, Eve and Seth began to cry  bitterly, and they besought God with many lamentations to give  them oil from the tree of His mercy. For hours they prayed thus.  At last the archangel Michael appeared, and informed them that he  came as the messenger of God to tell them that their petition  could not be granted. Adam would die in a few days, and as he was  subject to death, so would be all his descendants. Only at the  time of the resurrection, and then only to the pious, the oil of  life would be dispensed, together with all"]]]
