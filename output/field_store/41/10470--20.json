[Illustration]    Suppose A B to be a Hemispheare of one earth, C D to be the upper part  of the highest region, in which there might be either a contracted  vapour, as G, or else a dilated one, as H I. Suppose E F likewise to  represent halfe the heavens, wherein was this appearing Comet at K. Now  I say, that a contracted vapour, as G, could not cause this appearance,  because an inhabitant at M could not discerne the same starre with this  brightnesse, but perhaps another at L, betwixt which the vapour is  directly interposed. Nor could it be caused by a dilated vapour, as H I,  because then all the starres that were discerned through it would be  perceived with the same brightnesse.    Tis necessary therefore that the cause of this appearance should be in  the heavens. And this is granted by the most and best Astronomers. But,  say some, this doth not argue any naturall alteration in those purer  bodies, since tis probable that the concourse of many little vagabond  starres by the union of their beames may cause so great a light. Of this  opinion were _Anaxagoras_ and _Zeno_ amongst the ancient, and _Baptista  Cisatus_, _Blancanus_, with others amongst our moderne Astronomers. For,  say they, when there happens to be a concourse of some few starres, then  doe many other flie unto them from all the parts of heaven like so many  Bees unto their King. But 1. tis not likely that amongst those which wee  count the fixed starres there should be any such uncertaine motions,  that they can wander from all parts of the heavens, as if Nature had  neglected them, or forgot to appoint them a determinate course. 2. If  there be such a conflux of these, as of Bees to their King, then what  reason is there that they doe not still tarry with it, that so the Comet  may not be dissolved? But enough of this. You may commonly see it  confuted by many other arguments. Others there are, who affirme these to  be some new created stars, produced by an extraordinary supernaturall  power. I answer, true indeed, tis possible they might be so, but however  tis not likely they were so, since such appearances may be salved some  other way, wherefore to fly unto a miracle for such things, were a great  injury to nature, and to derogate from her skill, an indignitie much  mis-becomming a man who professes himselfe to be a Philosopher,  _Miraculum_ (saith one) _est ignorantiae Asylum_, a miracle often serves  for the receptacle of a lazy ignorance which any industrious Spirit  would be ashamed of, it being but an idle way to shift off the labour of  any further search. But here's the misery of it, wee first tie our  selves unto _Aristotles_ Principles, and then conclude, that nothing  could contradict them but a miracle, whereas 'twould be much better for  the Common-wealth of learning, if we would ground our Principles rather  upon the frequent experiences of our owne, then the bare authority of  others.    Some there are, who thinke that these Comets are nothing else, but  exhalations from our earth, carried up into the higher parts of the  Heaven. So _Peno_, _Rothmannus_ & _Galilaeus_,[1] but this is not  possible, since by computation 'tis found that one of them is above 300  times bigger than the whole Globe of Land and Water. Others therefore  have thought that they did proceed from the body of the Sun, and that  that Planet onely is      _Cometarum officina, unde tanquam emissarii & exploratores    emitterentur, brevi ad solem redituri_:    The shop or forge of Comets from whence they were sent, like so many  spies, that they might in some short space returne againe, but this  cannot be, since if so much matter had proceeded from him alone, it  would have made a sensible diminution in his body. The Noble _Tycho_  therefore thinkes that they consist of some such fluider parts of the  Heaven, as the milkie way is framed of, which being condenst together,  yet not attaining to the consistency of a Starre, is in some space of  time rarified againe into its wonted nature. But this is not likely, for  if there had beene so great a condensation as to make them shine so  bright, and last so long, they would then sensibly have moved downewards  towards some center of gravity, because whatsoever is condenst must  necessarily grow heavier, whereas these rather seemed to ascend higher,  as they lasted longer. But some may object, that a thing may be of the  same weight, when it is rarified, as it had while it was condenst: so  metalls, when they are melted, and when they are cold: so water also  when it is frozen, and when it is fluid, doth not differ in respect of  gravity. But to these I answer: First, Metalls are not rarified by  melting, but molified. Secondly, waters are not properly condensed, but  congealed into a harder substance, the parts being not contracted closer  together, but still possessing the same extension.      [Sidenote 1: _Tycho Progym. l. 1. cap. 9._]    And beside, what likely cause can we conceive of this condensation,  unlesse there be such qualities there, as there are in our ayre, and  then why may not the Planets have the like qualities, as our earth? and  if so, then 'tis more probable that they are made by the ordinary way of  nature, as they are with us, and consist of exhalations from the bodies  of the Planets. Nor is this a singular opinion; but it seemed most  likely to _Camillus Gloriosus_, _Th. Campanella_, _Fromondus_,[1] with  some others. But if you aske whither all these exhalations shall  returne, I answer, every one into his owne Planet: if it be againe  objected,[2] that then there will be so many centers of gravity, and  each severall Planet will be a distinct world; I reply, perhaps all of  them are so except the Sunne, though _Cusanus_ thinkes there is one  also, and later times have discovered some lesser Planets moving round  about him. But as for _Saturne_, he hath two Moones on each side.  _Jupiter_ hath foure, that incircle his body with their motion. _Venus_  is observed to increase and decrease as the Moone. _Mars_, and all the  rest, derive their light from the Sunne onely. Concerning _Mercury_,  there hath beene little or no observation, because for the most part,  he lies hid under the Sunne beames, and seldome appeares by himselfe.  So that if you consider their quantity, their opacity, or these other  discoveries, you shall finde it probable enough, that each of them may  be a severall world. But this would be too much for to vent at the  first: the chiefe thing at which I now ayme in this discourse, is to  prove that there may be one in the Moone.      [Sidenote 1: _De Comet. l. 5. c. 4._    _Apolog._    _Meteor. l. 3. c. 2. Art. 6._]      [Sidenote 2: _Iohan. Fabr._    _Carolus Malaptius de Heliocyc._    _Scheiner. Rosa Vrsina._]    It hath beene before confirmed that there was a spheare of thicke  vaporous aire encompasing the Moone, as the first and second regions doe  this earth. I have now shewed, that thence such exhalations may proceede  as doe produce the Comets: now from hence it may probably follow, that  there may be wind also and raine, with such other Meteors as are common  amongst us. This consequence is so dependant, that _Fromondus_[1] dares  not deny it, though hee would (as hee confesses himselfe) for if the  Sunne be able to exhale from them such fumes as may cause Comets, why  not then such as may cause winds, and why not such also as cause raine,  since I have above shewed, that there is Sea and Land as with us. Now  raine seemes to be more especially requisite for them, since it may  allay the heate and scorchings of the Sunne, when he is over their  heads. And nature hath thus provided for those in _Peru_, with the other  inhabitants under the line.      [Sidenote 1: _De meteor. l. 3. c. 2. Art. 6._]    But if there be such great, and frequent alterations in the Heavens, why  cannot wee discerne them?    I answer:    1. There may be such, and we not able to perceive them, because of the  weaknesse of our eye, and the distance of those places from us, they are  the words of _Fienus_, as they are quoted by _Fromondus_ in the above  cited place,      _Possunt maximae permutationes in coelo fieri, etiamsi a nobis non    conspiciantur, hoc visus nostri debilitas & immensa coeli distantia    faciunt._    And unto him assents _Fromondus_ himselfe, when a little after hee  saies,      _Si in sphaeris planetarum degeremus, plurima forsan coelestium    nebularum vellere toto aethere passim dispersa videremus, quorum    species jam evanescit nimia spatii intercapedine._      \"If we did live in the spheares of the Planets, wee might there,    perhaps, discerne many great clouds dispersed through the whole    Heavens, which are not now visible by reason of this great distance.\"    2. _Maeslin_ and _Keplar_ affirme, that they have seene some of these  alterations. The words of _Maeslin_ are these (as I finde them cited.)[1]      _In eclipsi Lunari vespere Dominicae Palmarum Anni 1605, in corpore    Lunae versus Boream, nigricans quaedam macula conspecta fuit, obscurior    caetero toto corpore, quod candentis ferri figuram repraesentabat;    dixisses nubila in multam regionem extensa pluviis & tempestuosis    imbribus gravida, cujusmodi ab excelsorum montium jugis in humiliora    convallium loca videre non raro contingit._      \"In that lunary eclipse which happened in the even of Palme-sunday,    in the yeere 1605, there was a certaine blackish spot discerned in    the Northerly part of the Moone, being darker than any other part of    her body, and representing the colour of red hot yron; you might    conjecture that it was some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19116"],[0,"How to Sing (#17)"],[1,"bring them a rich return on their  voices. I often take fifty minutes to go through it only once, for I  let no tone pass that is lacking in any degree in pitch, power, and  duration, or in a single vibration of the propagation form.          SECTION XXXIII    VELOCITY      Singers, male and female, who are lacking velocity and the power of  trilling, seem to me like horses without tails. Both of these things  belong to the art of song, and are inseparable from it. It is a matter  of indifference whether the singer has to use them or not; he must be  able to. The teacher who neither teaches nor can teach them to his  pupils is a _bad teacher_; the pupil who, notwithstanding the urgent  warnings of his teacher, neglects the exercises that can help him to  acquire them, and fails to perfect himself in them, is a _bungler_.  There is no excuse for it but lack of talent, or laziness; and neither  has any place in the higher walks of art.    To give the voice velocity, practise first slowly, then faster and  faster, figures of five, six, seven, and eight notes, etc., upward  and downward.    If one has well mastered the great, slow scale, with the nasal  connection, skill in singing rapid passages will be developed quite of  itself, because they both rest on the same foundation, and without the  preliminary practice can never be understood.    Put the palate into the nasal position, the larynx upon _oe_; attack  the lowest tone of the figure with the thought of the highest; force  the breath, as it streams very vigorously forth from the larynx,  toward the nose, but allow the head current entire freedom, without  entirely doing away with the nasal quality; and then run up the scale  with great firmness.    In descending, keep the form of the highest tone, even if there should  be eight to twelve tones in the passage, so that the scale slides  down, not a pair of stairs, but a smooth track, the highest tone  affording, as it were, a guarantee that on the way there shall be no  impediment or sudden drop. The resonance form, kept firm and tense,  must adapt itself with the utmost freedom to the thought of every  tone, and with it, to the breath. The pressure of the breath against  the chest must not be diminished, but must be unceasing.    To me it is always as if the pitch of the highest tone were already  contained in the lowest, so strongly concentrated upon the whole  figure are my thoughts at the attack of a single tone. By means of  _ah-e-[=a]_, larynx, tongue, and palatal position on the lowest tone  are in such a position that the vibrations of breath for the highest  tones are already finding admission into the head cavities, and as far  as possible are in sympathetic vibration there.    The higher the vocal figures go the more breath they need, the less  can the breath and the organs be pressed. The higher they are, the  more breath must stream forth from the epiglottis; therefore the  _[=a]_ and the thought of _e_, which keep the passages to the head  open. But because there is a limit to the scope of the movement of  larynx and tongue, and they cannot rise higher and higher with a  figure that often reaches to an immense height, the singer must resort  to the aid of the auxiliary vowel _oo_, in order to lower the larynx  and so make room for the breath:    [Music illustration]    A run or any other figure must never sound thus:    [Music illustration]    but must be nasally modified above, and tied; and because the breath  must flow out unceasingly in a powerful stream from the vocal cords,  an _h_ can only be put in beneath, which makes us sure of this  powerful streaming out of the breath, and helps only the branch  stream of breath into the cavities of the head. Often singers hold the  breath, concentrated on the nasal form, firmly on the lowest tone of a  figure, and, without interrupting this nasal form, or the head tones,  that is, the breath vibrating in the head cavities, finish the figure  alone. When this happens the muscular contractions of the throat,  tongue, and palate are very strong.    [Music illustration: L'oiselet. Chopin-Viardat]    The turn, too, based on the consistent connection of the tonal figure  with the nasal quality,--which is obtained by pronouncing the _oo_  toward the nose,--and firmly held there, permits no interruption for  an instant to the vowel sound.    How often have I heard the _ha-ha-ha-haa_, etc.,--a wretched tumbling  down of different tones, instead of a smooth decoration of the  cantilena. Singers generally disregard it, because no one can do it  any more, and yet even to-day it is of the greatest importance. (See  _Tristan und Isolde_.)    The situation is quite the same in regard to the appoggiatura. In  this the resonance is made nasal and the flexibility of the  larynx,--which, without changing the resonance, moves quickly up and  down--accomplishes the task alone. Here, too, it can almost be  imagined that the _thought_ alone is enough, for the connection  of the two tones cannot be too close. But this must be practised, and  done _consciously_.    [Music illustration: Adelaide, by Beethoven    A-bend-lueft-chen im zar-ten Lau-be flue-stern]    [Transcriber's Note: Corrected \"L'au-be\" in original to \"Lau-be\"]          SECTION XXXIV    TRILL      There still remains the trill, which is best practised in the  beginning as follows:--    [Music illustration]    The breath is led very far back against the head cavities by the  _[=a]_, the larynx kept as stiff as possible and placed high. Both  tones are connected as closely, as heavily as possible, upward  nasally, downward _on_ the larynx, for which the _y_, again, is  admirably suited. They must be attacked as high as possible, and very  strongly. The trill exercise must be practised almost as a scream.  The upper note must always be strongly _accented_. The exercise is  practised with an even strength, without decrescendo to the end; the  breath streams out more and more strongly, uninterruptedly to the  finish.    Trill exercises must be performed with great energy, on the whole  compass of the voice. They form an exception to the rule in so far  that in them more is given to the throat to do--always, however, under  the control of the chest--than in other exercises. That relates,  however, to the muscles.    The breath vibrates _above_ the larynx, but does not stick in it,  consequently this is not dangerous.    The exercise is practised first on two half, then on two whole, tones  of the same key (as given above), advancing by semitones, twice a day  on the entire compass of the voice. It is exhausting because it  requires great energy; but for the same reason it gives strength.  Practise it first as slowly and vigorously as the strength of the  throat allows, then faster and faster, till one day the trill  unexpectedly appears. With some energy and industry good results  should be reached in from six to eight weeks, and the larynx should  take on the habit of performing its function by itself. This function  gradually becomes a habit, so that it seems as if only _one_ tone were  attacked and held, and as if the second tone simply vibrated with it.  As a matter of fact, the larynx will have been so practised in the  minute upward and downward motion, that the singer is aware only of  the vibrations of the breath that lie _above_ it, while he remains  mindful all the time only of the pitch of the upper note.    One has the feeling then as of singing or holding only the _lower_  tone (which must be placed very high), while the upper one vibrates  with it simply through the habitude of the accentuation. The union of  the two then comes to the singer's consciousness as if he were  singing the lower note somewhat too high, halfway toward the upper  one. This is only an aural delusion, produced by the high vibrations.  But the trill, when fully mastered, should always be begun, as in the  exercise, on the _upper_ note.    Every voice must master the trill, after a period, longer or shorter,  of proper practice. Stiff, strong voices master it sooner than small,  weak ones. I expended certainly ten years upon improving it, because  as a young girl I had so very little strength, although my voice was  very flexible in executing all sorts of rapid passages.    To be able to use it anywhere, of course, requires a long time and  much practice. For this reason it is a good plan to practise it on  syllables with different vowels, such as can all be supported on  _[=a]_, and on words, as soon as the understanding needed for this is  in some degree assured.    If the larynx has acquired the habit properly, the trill can be  carried on into a _piano_ and _pianissimo_ and prolonged almost  without end with _crescendi_ and _decrescendi_, as the old Italians  used to do, and as _all Germans_ do who have learned anything.          SECTION XXXV    HOW TO HOLD ONE'S SELF WHEN PRACTISING      In practising the singer should always stand, if possible, before a  large mirror, in order to be able to watch himself closely. He should  stand upright, quietly but not stiffly, and avoid everything that  looks like restlessness. The hands should hang quietly, or rest  lightly on something, without taking part in the interpretation of the  expression. The first thing needed is to bring the body under control,  that is, to remain quiet, so that later, in singing, the singer can do  everything intentionally.    The pupil must always stand in such a way that the teacher can watch  his face, as well as his whole body. Continual movements of the  fingers, hands, or feet are not permissible.    The body must serve the singer's purposes freely and must acquire no  bad habits. The singer's self-possession is reflected in a feeling of  satisfaction on the part of the listener. The quieter the singer or  artist, the more significant is every expression he gives; the fewer  motions he makes, the more importance they have. So he can scarcely be"]]]
