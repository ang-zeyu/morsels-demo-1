'If it be said that the departure of the  pra/n/as from the body of the dying sage is denied (viz. in B/ri/. Up.  IV, 4, 5, na tasya pra/n/a utkramanti, of him the pra/n/as do not pass  out); we reply that in that passage the genitive \"tasya\" has the sense  of the ablative \"tasmat,\" so that the sense of the passage is, \"from  him, i.e. from the jiva of the dying sage, the pra/n/as do not depart,  but remain with it.\"'--This objection /S/a@nkara supposes to be disposed  of in Sutra 13. 'By some there is given a clear denial of the departure  of the pra/n/as in the case of the dying sage,' viz. in the passage  B/ri/. Up. III, 2, 11, where Yaj/n/avalkya instructs Artabhaga that,  when this man dies, the pra/n/as do not depart from it (asmat; the  context showing that asmat means 'from it,' viz. from the body, and not  'from him,' viz. the jiva).--The same view is, moreover, confirmed by  Sm/ri/ti passages.    According to Ramanuja the three Sutras forming /S/a@nkara's sixth  adhikara/n/a do not constitute a new adhikara/n/a at all, and, moreover,  have to be combined into two Sutras. The topic continuing to be  discussed is the utkranti of the vidvan. If, Sutra 12 says, the utkranti  of the pra/n/as is not admitted, on the ground of the denial supposed to  be contained in B/ri/. Up. IV, 4, 5; the reply is that the sense of the  tasya there is '/s/arirat' (so that the passage means, 'from him, i.e.  the jiva, the pra/n/as do not depart'); for this is clearly shown by the  reading of some, viz. the Madhyandinas, who, in their text of the  passage, do not read 'tasya' but 'tasmat.'--With reference to the  instruction given by Yaj/n/avalkya to Artabhaga, it is to be remarked  that nothing there shows the 'ayam purusha' to be the sage who knows  Brahman.--And, finally, there are Sm/ri/ti passages declaring that the  sage also when dying departs from the body.    Adhik. VII and VIII (15, 16) teach, according to /S/a@nkara, that, on  the death of him who possesses the higher knowledge, his pra/n/as,  elements, &c. are merged in Brahman, so as to be no longer distinct from  it in any way.    According to Ramanuja the two Sutras continue the teaching about the  pra/n/as, bhutas, &c. of the vidvan in general, and declare that they  are finally merged in Brahman, not merely in the way of conjunction  (sa/m/yoga), but completely.[21]    Adhik. IX (17).--/S/a@nkara here returns to the owner of the apara  vidya, while Ramanuja continues the description of the utkranti of his  vidvan.--The jiva of the dying man passes into the heart, and thence  departs out of the body by means of the na/d/is; the vidvan by means of  the na/d/i called sushum/n/a, the avidvan by means of some other na/d/i.    Adhik. X (18, 19).--The departing soul passes up to the sun by means of  a ray of light which exists at night as well as during day.    Adhik. XI (20, 21).--Also that vidvan who dies during the dakshi/n/ayana  reaches Brahman.      PADA III.      Adhik. I, II, III (1-3) reconcile the different accounts given in the  Upanishads as to the stations of the way which leads the vidvan up to  Brahman.    Adhik. IV (4-6)--By the 'stations' we have, however, to understand not  only the subdivisions of the way but also the divine beings which lead  the soul on.    The remaining part of the pada is by /S/a@nkara divided into two  adhikara/n/as. Of these the former one (7-14) teaches that the Brahman  to which the departed soul is led by the guardians of the path of the  gods is not the highest Brahman, but the effected (karya) or qualified  (/s/agu/n/a) Brahman. This is the opinion propounded in Sutras 7-11 by  Badari, and, finally, accepted by /S/a@nkara in his commentary on Sutra  14. In Sutras 12-14 Jaimini defends the opposite view, according to  which the soul of the vidvan goes to the highest Brahman, not to the  karyam brahma. But Jaimini's view, although set forth in the latter part  of the adhikara/n/a, is, according to /S/a@nkara, a mere purvapaksha,  while Badari's opinion represents the siddhanta.--The latter of the two  adhikara/n/as (VI of the whole pada; 15, 16) records the opinion of  Badaraya/n/a on a collateral question, viz. whether, or not, all those  who worship the effected Brahman are led to it. The decision is that  those only are guided to Brahman who have not worshipped it under a  pratika form.    According to Ramanuja, Sutras 7-16 form one adhikara/n/a only, in which  the views of Badari and of Jaimini represent two purvapakshas, while  Badaraya/n/a's opinion is adopted as the siddhanta. The question is  whether the guardians of the path lead to Brahman only those who worship  the effected Brahman, i.e. Hira/n/yagarbha, or those who worship the  highest Brahman, or those who worship the individual soul as free from  Prak/ri/ti, and having Brahman for its Self (ye pratyagatmana/m/  prak/ri/tiviyukta/m/ brahmatmakam upasate).--The first view is  maintained by Badari in Sutra 7, 'The guardians lead to Brahman those  who worship the effected Brahman, because going is possible towards the  latter only;' for no movement can take place towards the highest and as  such omnipresent Brahman.--The explanation of Sutra 9 is similar to that  of /S/a@nkara; but more clearly replies to the objection (that, if  Hira/n/yagarbha were meant in the passage, 'purusho /s/a manava/h/ sa  etan brahma gamayati,' the text would read 'sa etan brahma/n/am  gamayati') that Hira/n/yagarbha is called Brahman on account of his  nearness to Brahman, i.e. on account of his prathamajatva.--The  explanation of 10, 11 is essentially the same as in /S/a@nkara; so also  of l2-l4.--The siddhanta view is established in Sutra 13, 'It is the  opinion of Badaraya/n/a that it, i.e. the ga/n/a of the guardians, leads  to Brahman those who do not take their stand on what is pratika, i.e.  those who worship the highest Brahman, and those who meditate on the  individual Self as dissociated from prak/ri/ti, and having Brahman for  its Self, but not those who worship Brahman under pratikas. For both  views--that of Jaimini as well as that of Badari--are faulty.' The karya  view contradicts such passages as 'asma/k/ charirat samutthaya para/m/  jyotir upasampadya,' &c.; the para view, such passages as that in the  pa/nk/agni-vidya, which declares that ya ittha/m/ vidu/h/, i.e. those  who know the pa/nk/agni-vidya, are also led up to Brahman.      PADA IV.      Adhik. I (1-3) returns, according to /S/a@nkara, to the owner of the  para vidya, and teaches that, when on his death his soul obtains final  release, it does not acquire any new characteristics, but merely  manifests itself in its true nature.--The explanation given by Ramanuja  is essentially the same, but of course refers to that vidvan whose going  to Brahman had been described in the preceding pada.    Adhik. II (4) determines that the relation in which the released soul  stands to Brahman is that of avibhaga, non-separation. This, on  /S/a@nkara's view, means absolute non-separation, identity.--According  to Ramanuja the question to be considered is whether the released soul  views itself as separate (p/ri/thagbhuta) from Brahman, or as  non-separate because being a mode of Brahman. The former view is  favoured by those /S/ruti and Sm/ri/ti passages which speak of the soul  as being with, or equal to, Brahman; the latter by, such passages as tat  tvam asi and the like.[22]    Adhik. III (5-7) discusses the characteristics of the released soul  (i.e. of the truly released soul, according to /S/a@nkara). According to  Jaimini the released soul, when manifesting itself in its true nature,  possesses all those qualities which in Ch. Up. VIII, 7, 1 and other  places are ascribed to Brahman, such as apahatapapmatva,  satyasa/m/kalpatva, &c., ai/s/varya.--According to Au/d/ulomi the only  characteristic of the released soul is /k/aitanya.--According to  Badarayana the two views can be combined (/S/a@nkara remarking that  satyasa/m/kalpatva, &c. are ascribed to the released soul  vyavaharapekshaya).    Adhik. IV (8-9) returns, according to /S/a@nkara, to the apara vidya,  and discusses the question whether the soul of the pious effects its  desires by its mere determination, or uses some other means. The former  alternative is accepted--According to Ramanuja the adhikara/n/a simply  continues the consideration of the state of the released, begun in the  preceding adhikara/n/a. Of the released soul it is said in Ch. Up. VIII,  12, 3 that after it has manifested itself in its true nature it moves  about playing and rejoicing with women, carriages, and so on. The  question then arises whether it effects all this by its mere sa/m/kalpa  (it having been shown in the preceding adhikara/n/a that the released  soul is, like the Lord, satyasa/m/kalpa), or not. The answer is in  favour of the former alternative, on account of the explicit declaration  made in Ch. Up. VIII, 2, 'By his mere will the fathers come to receive  him.'    Adhik. V (10-14) decides that the released are embodied or disembodied  according to their wish and will.    Adhik. VI (11, 12) explains how the soul of the released can animate  several bodies at the same time.--Sutra 12 gives, according to  /S/a@nkara, the additional explanation that those passages which declare  the absence of all specific cognition on the part of the released soul  do not refer to the partly released soul of the devotee, but either to  the soul in the state of deep sleep (svapyaya = sushupti), or to the  fully released soul of the sage (sampatti = kaivalya).--Ramanuja  explains that the passages speaking of absence of consciousness refer  either to the state of deep sleep, or to the time of dying (sampatti =  mata/n/am according to 'van manasi sampadyate,' &c.).

This is the real significance of this appalling struggle, all  the rest is immaterial. Russia's attitude alone has forced us to go to  war with France and with their great ally.    The German Nation is serious and conscientious. Never would a German  Government dare to contemplate a war for the sake of dynastic interest,  or for the sake of glory. This would be against the entire bent of our  character. Firmly believing in the justice of our cause, all parties,  the Conservatives and the Clericals, the Liberals and the Socialists,  have joined hands. All disputes are forgotten, one duty exists for all,  the duty of defending our country and vanquishing the enemy.    Will not this calm, self-reliant and unanimous readiness to sacrifice  all, to die or to win, appeal to other nations and force them to  understand our real character and the situation in which we are placed?    The war has severed us from the rest of the world, all our cable  communications are destroyed. But the winds will carry the mighty voice  of justice even across the ocean. We trust in God, we have confidence in  the judgment of right-minded men. And through the roar of battle, we  call to you all. Do not believe the mischievous lies that our enemies  are spreading about! We do not know if victory will be ours, the Lord  alone knows. We have not chosen our path, we must continue doing our  duty, even to the very end. We bear the misery of war, the death of our  sons, believing in Germany, believing in duty.    And we know that Germany cannot be wiped from the face of the earth.             *       *       *       *       *          [05]         \"Athenwood,\" Newport, R.I.,         Sept. 17, 1914.         Today I have received from Germany a pamphlet entitled \"Truth About       Germany, Facts About the War.\" The correctness and completeness of       its statements are vouched for by thirty-four persons, whose names       are recorded therein as members of an Honorary Committee. I know       personally seventeen of these thirty-four persons, and have known       them for years, some of them intimately. With six of them I have       labored as a colleague in university work. I have been introduced       into their homes, have broken bread at their tables and have       conversed with them long and often upon the problems of life and       culture. They are among the greatest thinkers, moralists and       philanthropists of the age. They are the salt of the earth! The       great theologian Harnack, the sound and accomplished political       scientist and economist von Schmoller, the distinguished       philologian von Wilamowitz, the well-known historian Lamprecht, the       profound statesman von Posadowsky, the brilliant diplomatist von       Buelow, the great financier von Gwinner, the great promoter of trade       and commerce Ballin, the great inventor Siemens, the brilliant       preacher of the Gospel Dryander, the indispensable Director in the       Ministry of Education Schmidt. Two of them are, in a sense, our own       countrywomen, the Baroness Speck von Sternburg and Frau       Staats-minister von Trott zu Solz. The latter is the granddaughter       of our own John Jay. I have known her, her mother and her       grandfather. No statement was ever issued which was vouched for by       more solid, intelligent, and conscientious people. Its correctness,       completeness and veracity cannot be doubted. As I read it the       emotions which it arouses make both speech and sight difficult. I       wish it might come into the hands of every man, woman, and child in       the United States.         (Signed) JOHN W.

Under the head of \"An Anti-British Pamphlet,\" The London Times of Aug.  23, 1914, noted as follows:         The Vossischezeitung gives extracts from a brochure issued under       the auspices of a committee of such prominent Germans as Prince       Buelow, Herr Ballin, Dr. von Gwinner, and Field Marshal von der       Goltz, for the purpose of \"opening the eyes\" of the United States       regarding the causes of the present war. Copies of this pamphlet       are being given to all Americans returning home from Germany. One       chapter, headed \"Neutrality by Grace of England,\" scoffs at the       idea of England today being the defender of neutral States and       declares that it was England who in 1911 was ready to land 160,000       men at Antwerp to help the French against the Germans.         As to who will ultimately win in the war, the pamphlet asks whether       it will be the striving nation, the young strength, or the old       peoples, France and England, with their flagging civilization in       alliance with Muscovite retrogression.                 *       *       *       *       *          HOW THE WAR CAME ABOUT.      Who is responsible for the war?--Not Germany! England's policy! Her  shifting of responsibility and promoting the struggle while alone  possessing power to avert it.      It is an old and common experience that after the outbreak of a war the  very parties and persons that wanted the war, either at once or later,  assert that the enemy wanted and began it. The German Empire especially  always had to suffer from such untruthful assertions, and the very first  days of the present terrible European war confirm again this old  experience. Again Russian, French, and British accounts represent the  German Empire as having wanted the war.    Only a few months ago influential men and newspapers of Great Britain as  well as of Paris could be heard to express the opinion that nobody in  Europe wanted war and that especially the German Emperor and his  Government had sincerely and effectively been working for peace.  Especially the English Government, in the course of the last two years,  asserted frequently and publicly, and was supported by The Westminster  Gazette and a number of influential English newspapers in the assertion,  that Great Britain and the German Empire during the Balkan crisis of the  last few years had always met on the same platform for the preservation  of peace. The late Secretary of State, von Kiderlen-Waechter, his  successor, Mr. von Jagow, and the Imperial Chancellor, von  Bethmann-Hollweg, likewise declared repeatedly in the Reichstag, how  great their satisfaction was that a close and confidential diplomatic  co-operation with Great Britain, especially in questions concerning the  Near East, had become a fact. And it has to be acknowledged today that  at that time the German and British interests in the Near East were  identical or at any rate ran in parallel lines.    The collapse of European Turkey in the war against the Balkan Alliance  created an entirely new situation. At first Bulgaria was victorious and  great, then it was beaten and humiliated by the others with the  intellectual help of Russia. There could be no doubt about Russia's  intentions: she was preparing for the total subjection of weakened  Turkey and for taking possession of the Dardanelles and Constantinople  in order to rule from this powerful position Turkey and the other Balkan  States. Great Britain and the German Empire, which only had economic  interests in Turkey, were bound to wish to strengthen Turkey besides  trying to prevent the Muscovite rule on the whole Balkan peninsula.    Servia had come out of the second Balkan war greatly strengthened and  with her territory very much increased. Russia had done everything to  strengthen this bitter enemy of our ally, Austria-Hungary. For a great  number of years Servian politicians and conspirators had planned to  undermine the southeastern provinces of Austria-Hungary and to separate  them from the Dual Monarchy. In Servia as well as in Russia prevailed  the opinion that, at the first attack, Austria-Hungary would fall to  pieces. In this case Servia was to receive South Austria and Russia was  to dictate the peace in Vienna. The Balkan war had ruined Turkey almost  entirely, had paralyzed Bulgaria, that was friendly, and had  strengthened the Balkan States that were hostile to Austria. At the same  time there began in Rumania a Russian and French propaganda, that  promised this country, if it should join the dual alliance, the  Hungarian Province of Siebenbuergen.    Thus it became evident in Germany and in Austria that at St. Petersburg,  first by diplomatic and political, then also by military, action a  comprehensive attack of Slavism under Russian guidance was being  prepared. The party of the Grand Dukes in St. Petersburg, the party of  the Russian officers, always ready for war, and the Pan-Slavists, the  brutal and unscrupulous representatives of the idea that the Russian  Czarism was destined to rule Europe--all these declared openly that  their aim was the destruction of Austria-Hungary. In Russia the army,  already of an immense size, was increased secretly but comprehensively  and as quick as possible; in Servia the same was done, and the Russian  Ambassador in Belgrade, Mr. von Hartwig, was, after the second Balkan  war, the principal promoter of the plan to form against Austria a new  Balkan alliance. In Bosnia, during all this time, the Servian propaganda  was at work with high treason, and in the end with revolver and the  bomb.    In Vienna and in Berlin the greatness and the purpose of the new danger  could not remain doubtful, especially as it was openly said in St.  Petersburg, in Belgrade, and elsewhere that the destruction of  Austria-Hungary was imminent. As soon as the Balkan troubles began  Austria-Hungary had been obliged to put a large part of her army in  readiness for war, because the "]]]
