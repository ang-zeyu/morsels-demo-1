And she further sayth, that one _Iohn Nutter_ of the _Bulhole_ in  _Pendle_ aforesaid, had a Cow which was sicke, & requested this  examinats Grand-mother to amend the said Cow; and her said  Graund-mother said she would, and so her said Graund-mother about ten  of the clocke in the night, desired this examinate to lead her foorth;  which this Examinate did, being then blind: and her Graund-mother did  remaine about halfe an houre foorth: and this Examinates sister did  fetch her in againe; but what she did when she was so foorth, this  Examinate cannot tell. But the next morning this Examinate heard that  the sayd Cow was dead. And this Examinate verily thinketh, that her  sayd Graund-mother did bewitch the sayd Cow to death.    And further, this Examinate sayth, that about two yeares agon, this  Examinate hauing gotten a Piggin full[C_b_] of blew Milke by begging,  brought it into the house of her Graund-mother, where (this Examinate  going foorth presently, and staying about halfe an houre) there was  Butter to the quantity of a quarterne of a pound in the said milke,  and the quantitie of the said milke still remayning; and her  Graund-mother had no Butter in the house when this Examinate went  foorth: duering which time, this Examinates Graund-mother still lay in  her bed.    And further this Examinate sayth, that _Richard Baldwin_ of _Weethead_  within the Forrest of _Pendle_, about 2. yeeres agoe, fell out with  this Examinates Graund-mother, & so would not let her come vpon his  Land: and about foure or fiue dayes then next after, her said  Graund-mother did request this Examinate to lead her foorth about ten  of the clocke in the night: which this Examinate accordingly did, and  she stayed foorth then about an houre, and this Examinates sister  fetched her in againe. And this Examinate heard the next morning, that  a woman Child of the sayd _Richard Baldwins_ was fallen sicke; and as  this Examinate did then heare, the sayd Child did languish afterwards  by the space of a yeare, or thereaboutes, and dyed: And this Examinate  verily thinketh, that her said Graund-mother did bewitch the sayd  Child to death.    And further, this Examinate sayth, that she heard her sayd  Graund-mother say presently after her falling out with the sayd  _Baldwin_, shee would pray for the sayd _Baldwin_ both still and  loude: and this Examinate heard her cursse the sayd _Baldwin_ sundry  times.           *       *       *       *       *    The Examination of _Iames Deuice_ of the Forrest of  _Pendle_, in the Countie of _Lancaster_ Labourer, taken the  27. day of April, _Annoq; Regni Regis Iacobi, Angliae, &c._  _Decimo: ac Scotie Quadragesimo quinto_: Before  _Roger Nowell and Nicholas Banister, Esq._[C2_a_]  two of his Maiesties Iustices of Peace within  the sayd Countie.    The sayd Examinate _Iames Deuice_ sayth, that about a month agoe,  as this Examinate was comming towards his Mothers house, and at  day-gate of the same night, [Sidenote: _Euening_] this Examinate mette  a browne Dogge comming from his Graund-mothers house, about tenne  Roodes distant from the same house: and about two or three nights  after, that this Examinate heard a voyce of a great number of Children  screiking and crying pittifully, about day-light gate; and likewise,  about ten Roodes distant of this Examinates sayd Graund-mothers house.  And about fiue nights then next following, presently after daylight,  within 20. Roodes of the sayd _Elizabeth Sowtherns_ house, he heard a  foule yelling like vnto a great number of Cattes: but what they were,  this Examinate cannot tell. And he further sayth, that about three  nights after that, about midnight of the same, there came a thing, and  lay vpon him very heauily about an houre, and went then from him out  of his Chamber window, coloured blacke, and about the bignesse of a  Hare or Catte. And he further sayth, that about _S. Peter's_ day last,  one _Henry Bullocke_ came to the sayd _Elizabeth Sowtherns_ house, and  sayd, that her Graund-child _Alizon Deuice_, had bewitched a Child of  his, and desired her that she would goe with him to his house; which  accordingly she did: And therevpon she the said _Alizon_ fell downe on  her knees, & asked the said _Bullocke_ forgiuenes, and confessed to  him, that she had bewitched the said child, as this Examinate heard  his said sister confesse vnto him this Examinate.      [Illustration: decoration]    The Examination of Elizabeth  Deuice, Daughter of old Demdike, taken  at _Read_ before _Roger Nowell_ Esquire, one of  his Maiesties Iustices of Peace within the  Countie of _Lancaster_ the xxx. day  of March, _Annoq; Regni Jacobi_  _Decimo, ac Scotie xlv._    The sayd _Elizabeth Deuice_ the Examinate, sayth, that the sayd  _Elizabeth Sowtherns_, alias _Demdike_, hath had a place on her left  side by the space of fourty yeares, in such sort, as was to be seene  at this Examinates Examination taking, at this present time.    Heere this worthy Iustice M. _Nowell_, out of these particular  Examinations, or rather Accusations, finding matter to proceed; and  hauing now before him old _Demdike_, old _Chattox_, _Alizon Deuice_,  and _Redferne_ both old and young, _Reos confitentes, et Accusantes  Inuicem_. About the second of Aprill last past, committed and sent  them away to the Castle at _Lancaster_, there to remaine vntill the  comming of the Kinges Maiesties Iustices of Assise, then to receiue  their tryall.    But heere they had not stayed a weeke, when their Children and  Friendes being abroad at libertie, laboured a speciall meeting at  _Malking Tower_ in the Forrest of _Pendle_,[C3_a_] vpon Good-fryday,  within a weeke after they were committed, of all the most dangerous,  wicked, and damnable Witches in the County farre and neere. Vpon  Good-fryday they met, according to solemne appoyntment, solemnized  this great Feastiuall day according to their former order, with great  cheare, merry company, and much conference.    In the end, in this great Assemblie, it was decreed M. _Couell_ by  reason of his Office, shall be slaine before the next Assises: The  Castle of _Lancaster_ to be blowen vp, and ayde and assistance to be  sent to kill M. _Lister_, with his old Enemie and wicked Neighbour  _Iennet Preston_; with some other such like practices: as vpon their  Arraignement and Tryall, are particularly set foorth, and giuen in  euidence against them.    This was not so secret, but some notice of it came to M. _Nowell_, and  by his great paines taken in the Examination of _Iennet Deuice_, al  their practises are now made knowen. Their purpose to kill M.  _Couell_, and blow vp the Castle, is preuented. All their Murders,  Witchcraftes, Inchauntments, Charmes, & Sorceries, are discouered; and  euen in the middest of their consultations, they are all confounded,  and arrested by Gods Iustice: brought before M. _Nowell_, and M.  _Bannester_, vpon their voluntary confessions, Examinations, and other  Euidence accused, and so by them committed to the Castle: So as now  both old and young, haue taken vp their lodgings with M. _Couell_,  vntill the next Assises, expecting their Tryall and deliuerance,  according to the Lawes prouided for such like.    In the meane time, M. _Nowell_ hauing knowledge by this discouery of  their meeting at _Malkeing Tower_, and their resolution to execute  mischiefe, takes great paines to apprehend such as were at libertie,  and prepared Euidence against all such as were in question for  Witches.    Afterwardes sendes some of these Examinations, to the Assises at  Yorke, to be giuen in Evidence against _Iennet Preston_, who for the  murder of M. _Lister_, is condemned and executed.    The Circuite of the North partes being now almost ended.      The 16. of August.    Vpon Sunday in the after noone, my honorable Lords the Iudges of  Assise, came from _Kendall_ to _Lancaster_.    Wherevpon M. _Couell_, presented vnto their Lordships a Calender,  conteyning the Names of the Prisoners committed to his charge, which  were to receiue their Tryall at the Assises: Out of which, we are  onely to deale with the proceedings against Witches, which were as  followeth.    _Viz._    The Names of the  Witches committed to the  Castle of _Lancaster_.      _Elizabeth Sowtherns._ } Who dyed before       alias             }     shee  _Old Demdike._         } came to her tryall.    _Anne Whittle_, alias _Chattox._  _Elizabeth Deuice_, Daughter of old _Demdike._  _Iames Deuice_, Sonne of _Elizabeth Deuice._  _Anne Readfearne_, Daughter of _Anne Chattox._  _Alice Nutter._  _Katherine Hewytte._  _Iohn Bulcocke._  _Iane Bulcocke._  _Alizon Deuice_, Daughter of _Elizabeth Deuice._  _Isabell Robey._  _Magaret Pearson._      The Witches of Salmesbury.    _Iennet Bierley._  }  { _Elizabeth Astley._  _Elen Bierley._    }  { _Alice Gray._  _Iane Southworth._ }  { _Isabell Sidegraues._  _Iohn Ramesden._   }  { _Lawrence Haye._    The next day, being Monday, the 17. of August, were the Assises holden  in the Castle of _Lancaster_, as followeth.           *       *       *       *       *    Placita Coronae.

Will he say, \"Perhaps they  are forged?\" and neglect to examine them?      218    _Dungeon._--I approve of not examining the opinion of Copernicus; but  this...! It concerns all our life to know whether the soul be mortal or  immortal.      219    It is certain that the mortality or immortality of the soul must make an  entire difference to morality. And yet philosophers have constructed  their ethics independently of this: they discuss to pass an hour.    Plato, to incline to Christianity.      220    The fallacy of philosophers who have not discussed the immortality of  the soul. The fallacy of their dilemma in Montaigne.      221    Atheists ought to say what is perfectly evident; now it is not perfectly  evident that the soul is material.      222    _Atheists._--What reason have they for saying that we cannot rise from  the dead? What is more difficult, to be born or to rise again; that what  has never been should be, or that what has been should be again? Is it  more difficult to come into existence than to return to it? Habit makes  the one appear easy to us; want of habit makes the other impossible. A  popular way of thinking!    Why cannot a virgin bear a child? Does a hen not lay eggs without a  cock? What distinguishes these outwardly from others? And who has told  us that the hen may not form the germ as well as the cock?      223    What have they to say against the resurrection, and against the  child-bearing of the Virgin? Which is the more difficult, to produce a  man or an animal, or to reproduce it? And if they had never seen any  species of animals, could they have conjectured whether they were  produced without connection with each other?      224    How I hate these follies of not believing in the Eucharist, etc.! If the  Gospel be true, if Jesus Christ be God, what difficulty is there?      225    Atheism shows strength of mind, but only to a certain degree.      226    Infidels, who profess to follow reason, ought to be exceedingly strong  in reason. What say they then? \"Do we not see,\" say they, \"that the  brutes live and die like men, and Turks like Christians? They have their  ceremonies, their prophets, their doctors, their saints, their monks,  like us,\" etc. (Is this contrary to Scripture? Does it not say all  this?)    If you care but little to know the truth, here is enough of it to leave  you in repose. But if you desire with all your heart to know it, it is  not enough; look at it in detail. This would be sufficient for a  question in philosophy; but not here, where it concerns your all. And  yet, after a trifling reflection of this kind, we go to amuse ourselves,  etc. Let us inquire of this same religion whether it does not give a  reason for this obscurity; perhaps it will teach it to us.      227    _Order by dialogues._--What ought I to do? I see only darkness  everywhere. Shall I believe I am nothing? Shall I believe I am God?    \"All things change and succeed each other.\" You are mistaken; there  is ...      228    Objection of atheists: \"But we have no light.\"      229    This is what I see and what troubles me. I look on all sides, and I see  only darkness everywhere. Nature presents to me nothing which is not  matter of doubt and concern. If I saw nothing there which revealed a  Divinity, I would come to a negative conclusion; if I saw everywhere the  signs of a Creator, I would remain peacefully in faith. But, seeing too  much to deny and too little to be sure, I am in a state to be pitied;  wherefore I have a hundred time wished that if a God maintains nature,  she should testify to Him unequivocally, and that, if the signs she  gives are deceptive, she should suppress them altogether; that she  should say everything or nothing, that I might see which cause I ought  to follow. Whereas in my present state, ignorant of what I am or of what  I ought to do, I know neither my condition nor my duty. My heart  inclines wholly to know where is the true good, in order to follow it;  nothing would be too dear to me for eternity.    I envy those whom I see living in the faith with such carelessness, and  who make such a bad use of a gift of which it seems to me I would make  such a different use.      230    It is incomprehensible that God should exist, and it is incomprehensible  that He should not exist; that the soul should be joined to the body,  and that we should have no soul; that the world should be created, and  that it should not be created, etc.; that original sin should be, and  that it should not be.      231    Do you believe it to be impossible that God is infinite, without  parts?--Yes. I wish therefore to show you an infinite and indivisible  thing. It is a point moving everywhere with an infinite velocity; for it  is one in all places, and is all totality in every place.    Let this effect of nature, which previously seemed to you impossible,  make you know that there may be others of which you are still ignorant.  Do not draw this conclusion from your experiment, that there remains  nothing for you to know; but rather that there remains an infinity for  you to know.      232    Infinite movement, the point which fills everything, the moment of rest;  infinite without quantity, indivisible and infinite.      233    _Infinite_--_nothing._--Our soul is cast into a body, where it finds  number, time, dimension. Thereupon it reasons, and calls this nature,  necessity, and can believe nothing else.    Unity joined to infinity adds nothing to it, no more than one foot to an  infinite measure. The finite is annihilated in the presence of the  infinite, and becomes a pure nothing. So our spirit before God, so our  justice before divine justice. There is not so great a disproportion  between our justice and that of God, as between unity and infinity.    The justice of God must be vast like His compassion. Now justice to the  outcast is less vast, and ought less to offend our feelings than mercy  towards the elect.    We know that there is an infinite, and are ignorant of its nature. As we  know it to be false that numbers are finite, it is therefore true that  there is an infinity in number. But we do not know what it is. It is  false that it is even, it is false that it is odd; for the addition of a  unit can make no change in its nature. Yet it is a number, and every  number is odd or even (this is certainly true of every finite number).  So we may well know that there is a God without knowing what He is. Is  there not one substantial truth, seeing there are so many things which  are not the truth itself?    We know then the existence and nature of the finite, because we also are  finite and have extension. We know the existence of the infinite, and  are ignorant of its nature, because it has extension like us, but not  limits like us. But we know neither the existence nor the nature of God,  because He has neither extension nor limits.    But by faith we know His existence; in glory we shall know His nature.  Now, I have already shown that we may well know the existence of a  thing, without knowing its nature.    Let us now speak according to natural lights.    If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible, since, having  neither parts nor limits, He has no affinity to us. We are then  incapable of knowing either what He is or if He is. This being so, who  will dare to undertake the decision of the question? Not we, who have no  affinity to Him.    Who then will blame Christians for not being able to give a reason for  their belief, since they profess a religion for which they cannot give a  reason? They declare, in expounding it to the world, that it is a  foolishness, _stultitiam_;[90] and then you complain that they do not  prove it! If they proved it, they would not keep their word; it is in  lacking proofs, that they are not lacking in sense. \"Yes, but although  this excuses those who offer it as such, and takes away from them the  blame of putting it forward without reason, it does not excuse those who  receive it.\" Let us then examine this point, and say, \"God is, or He is  not.\" But to which side shall we incline? Reason can decide nothing  here. There is an infinite chaos which separated us. A game is being  played at the extremity of this infinite distance where heads or tails  will turn up. What will you wager? According to reason, you can do  neither the one thing nor the other; according to reason, you can defend  neither of the propositions.    Do not then reprove for error those who have made a choice; for you know  nothing about it. \"No, but I blame them for having made, not this  choice, but a choice; for again both he who chooses heads and he who  chooses tails are equally at fault, they are both in the wrong. The true  course is not to wager at all.\"    Yes; but you must wager. It is not optional. You are embarked. Which  will you choose then? Let us see. Since you must choose, let us see  which interests you least. You have two things to lose, the true and the  good; and two things to stake, your reason and your will, your  knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to shun,  error and misery. Your reason is no more shocked in choosing one rather  than the other, since you must of necessity choose. This is one point  settled. But your happiness? Let us weigh the gain and the loss in  wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain,  you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without  hesitation that He is.--\"That is very fine. Yes, I must wager; but I may  perhaps wager too much.\"--Let us see. Since there is an equal risk of  gain and of loss, if you had only to gain two lives, instead of one, you  might still wager. But"]]]
