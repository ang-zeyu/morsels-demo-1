[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19042"],[0,"Animal Figures in the Maya Codices (#17)"],[1,"mestication.[359-[+]] We have included among the  figures of dogs two in which the eye is differently represented and  which are unspotted (Pl. 37, figs. 4, 6). These modifications may have  some special significance, but otherwise the animals appear most closely  to represent dogs.    We have already suggested that the animal attired in man's clothing, and  walking erect in Dresden 25a-28a is likewise a dog, though Stempell  believes it to represent the opossum in support of which he calls  attention to its prominent vibrissae and slightly curled tail.    The dog played a large part in the religion both of the Mayas and the  Mexican peoples. It was connected especially with the idea of death and  destruction. The Lacandones of the present time make a small figure of a  dog to place on the grave (Tozzer, 1907, p. 47). This is but one of the  many survivals of the ancient pre-Columbian religion found among this  people. The dog was regarded as the messenger to prepare the way to the  other world. Seler (1900-1901, pp. 82-83) gives an interesting parallel  of the Nahua idea of the dog and his connection with death. He  paraphrases Sahagun as follows: \"The native Mexican dogs barked, wagged  their tails, in a word, behaved in all respects like our own dogs, were  kept by the Mexicans not only as house companions, but above all, for  the shambles, and also in Yucatan and on the coast land for sacrifice.  The importance that the dog had acquired in the funeral rites may  perhaps have originated in the fact that, as the departed of both sexes  were accompanied by their effects, the prince by the women and slaves in  his service, so the dog was assigned to the grave as his master's  associate, friend, and guard, and that the persistence of this custom in  course of time created the belief that the dog stood in some special  relation to the kingdom of the dead. It may also be that, simply because  it was the practice to burn the dead, the dog was looked on as the Fire  God's animal and the emblem of fire, the natives got accustomed to speak  of him as the messenger to prepare the way in the kingdom of the dead,  and thus eventually to regard him as such. At the time when the  Spaniards made their acquaintance, it was the constant practice of the  Mexicans to commit to the grave with the dead a dog who had to be of a  red-yellow color, and had a string of unspun cotton round his neck, and  was first killed by the thrust of a dart in his throat. The Mexicans  believed that four years after death, when the soul had already passed  through many dangers on its way to the underworld, it came at last to  the bank of a great river, the Chicunauhapan, which encircled the  underworld proper. The souls could get across this river only when they  were awaited by their little dog, who, recognizing his master on the  opposite side, rushed into the water to bring him over.\" (Sahagun, 3  Appendix, Chap. 1.)    As might be expected from the foregoing, there are abundant evidences in  the manuscripts of the presence of the dog in the various religious  rites and especially those which have to do with the other world, the  Kingdom of the Dead. In Tro-Cortesianus 35b, 36b, 37a, 37b, the pages  showing the rites of the four years, the dog appears in various  attitudes. In 35b and 36b, it bears on his back the _Imix_ and _Kan_  signs, in 37a (Pl. 37, fig. 8) it is shown as beating a drum and  singing, in 37b (Pl. 36, fig. 2) it is beside a bowl containing _Kan_  signs. In all of these places, the dogs seem to be represented among the  various birds and animals which are to be sacrificed for the new years.  Landa (1864, p. 216)[361-*] states that in the _Kan_ year a dog was  sacrificed. In the _Muluc_ year, Landa (1864, p. 222)[361-[+]] records  that they offered dogs made of clay with bread upon their backs and a  _perrito_ which had black shoulders and was a virgin. It has already  been noted that two of the dogs represented in Tro-Cortesianus 35b and  36b have a _Kan_ and _Imix_ sign fastened to the back. Moreover, we have  also pointed out that the _Kan_ sign frequently seems to have the  meaning of maize or bread. It will be noted that in Tro-Cortesianus 36b  two human feet are shown on each of which is a dog-like  animal.[361-[++]] These may indicate the dance in which dogs were  carried as noted by Landa. Cogolludo (1688, p. 184)[361-Sec.] also mentions  a similar dance. Still another reference in Landa (1864, p. 260)[362-*]  mentions that in the months _Muan_ and _Pax_ dogs were sacrificed to the  deities.    Reference has already been made to the identification of the four  priests at the top of Dresden 25-28 as having the heads of dogs rather  than of opossums. It may be suggested that in the role of the conductor  to the other world the dog is represented as carrying on his back in  each case the year which has just been completed and therefore is dead.  This, of course, would necessitate the identification of god B, the  jaguar, god E, and god A as representing in turn the four years.    The dog, according to Sahagun's account (p. 360) was looked upon as the  \"Fire God's animal,\" and as an emblem of fire. This idea is seen  frequently in the Maya manuscripts where the dog with firebrands in his  paws or attached to his tail is coming head downward from a line of  constellation signs, as in Dresden 36a (Pl. 37, fig. 3), 40b (Pl. 37,  fig. 1) or is standing beneath similar signs as in Dresden 39a (Pl. 37,  fig. 2) and probably in Tro-Cortesianus 13a. His tail alone has the  firebrand in Tro-Cortesianus 36b. Firebrands are carried by figures  which have been identified by us as dogs in Tro-Cortesianus 24c (Pl. 37,  fig. 6), 25c, and 90a. Here the animal is represented as in the air  holding his firebrands over a blazing altar beside which god F is  seated. In two out of the four cases, F is shown as dead. The dog in  these latter examples has his eye composed of the _Akbal_ sign. This  same glyph can also be made out with difficulty on the forehead of the  dog shown in Dresden 36a (Pl. 37, fig. 3). As has been noted, _Akbal_  means night and possibly death as well. It is certain that destruction  is indicated in the preceding examples as well as in Tro-Cortesianus 87a  and 88a (Pl. 37, fig. 4) where the dog is holding four human figures by  the hair.    Beyer (1908, pp. 419-422) has identified the dog as the Pleiades and  various other suggestions have been made that the dog represents some  constellation. The more common form of spotted dog is shown as a single  _tonalamatl_ figure in Tro-Cortesianus 25d and 27d (Pl. 36, fig. 14) and  an unspotted variety in Dresden 7a (Pl. 37, fig. 10). The dog is  frequently shown as copulating with another animal or with a female  figure. In Dresden 13c (Pl. 37, fig. 7) the second figure is a vulture,  in Dresden 21b (Pl. 37, fig. 5) it is a woman and also in  Tro-Cortesianus 91c (Pl. 36, fig. 12).    The same animal appears also in a number of scenes not included in the  preceding. In Tro-Cortesianus 88c (Pl. 36, fig. 1) a dog is seated on a  crab and seems to be connected with the idea of the north as this sign  is noted above the figure; in Tro-Cortesianus 66b (Pl. 36, fig. 3) a dog  and another animal (Pl. 32, fig. 3) are seated back to back under a  shelter; in Tro-Cortesianus 30b a dog is seated on the right foot of the  woman from whose breasts water is streaming; in Dresden 29a (Pl. 37,  fig. 12) god B is shown seated on a dog; and, finally, in Dresden 30a  (Pl. 37, fig. 9) god B holds the bound dog by the tail over an altar.    The dog appears from numerous references to be used in connection with a  prayer for rain. Comargo (1843) in his history of Tlaxcallan states that  when rain failed, a procession was held in which a number of hairless  dogs were carried on decorated litters to a place devoted to their use.  There they were sacrificed to the god of water and the bodies were  eaten.    The glyphs associated with the dog are interesting as we have, as in the  case with the deer, one showing a realistic drawing of a dog's head in  Tro-Cortesianus 91d (Pl. 37, fig. 13) and several others far more  difficult of interpretation. Pl. 37, fig. 11, seems to stand for the dog  as it is found in several places where the dog appears below, Dresden  21b, 40b. It is thought by some to represent the ribs of a dog which  appear in somewhat similar fashion in Pl. 37, fig. 8. Some of the  glyphs in the codices for the month _Kankin_ show the same element (text  figs. 8-10).    [Illustration: Figs. 8, 9, 10.  GLYPHS FOR MAYA MONTH KANKIN (RIBS OF DOG).]    The Nahua day sign _Itzcuintli_ signifies dog and corresponds to the  Maya Oc (Pl. 36, figs. 9-11). This in turn is considered by many to  stand for the dog as the animal of death and signifies the end. The  sore, cropped ears of the domesticated dog are supposed to be  represented in this sign, Oc. Nahua and other day signs for _Itzcuintli_  (dog) are shown in Pl. 36, figs. 4, 6, 13.    BEAR (_Ursus machetes_; _U. horriaeus_). In northern Mexico, in  Chihuahua and Sonora, occur a black bear (_Ursus machetes_) and the  Sonoran grizzly (_U. horriaeus_). It is unlikely that the Mayas had much  acquaintance with these animals since they range more to the northward  than the area of Maya occupation. Stempell has identified as a bear, a  figure in Dresden 37a (Pl. 35, fig. 3). This represents a creature with  the body of a man walking erect but with the head apparently of some  carnivorous mammal, as shown by the prominent canine tooth. This appears  as a _tonalamatl_ figure. The resemblance to a bear is not very clear.  Less doubt attaches to the figure shown in Pl. 35, fig. 4, which seems  almost certainly to depict a bear. The stout body, absence of a tail,  the plantigrade hind feet, and stout claws, all seem to proclaim it a  bear of one of the two species above mentioned. This picture is found in  connection with one of the warriors shown in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1906"],[0,"Erewhon; Or, Over the Range (#17)"],[1,".  For they regard bodily ailments as the more  venial in proportion as they have been produced by causes independent of  the constitution.  Thus if a person ruin his health by excessive  indulgence at the table or by drinking, they count it to be almost a part  of the mental disease which brought it about, and so it goes for little,  but they have no mercy on such illnesses as fevers or catarrhs or lung  diseases, which to us appear to be beyond the control of the individual.  They are only more lenient towards the diseases of the young--such as  measles, which they think to be like sowing one's wild oats--and look  over them as pardonable indiscretions if they have not been too serious,  and if they are atoned for by complete subsequent recovery.    It is hardly necessary to say that the office of straightener is one  which requires long and special training.  It stands to reason that he  who would cure a moral ailment must be practically acquainted with it in  all its bearings.  The student for the profession of straightener is  required to set apart certain seasons for the practice of each vice in  turn, as a religious duty.  These seasons are called \"fasts,\" and are  continued by the student until he finds that he really can subdue all the  more usual vices in his own person, and hence can advise his patients  from the results of his own experience.    Those who intend to be specialists, rather than general practitioners,  devote themselves more particularly to the branch in which their practice  will mainly lie.  Some students have been obliged to continue their  exercises during their whole lives, and some devoted men have actually  died as martyrs to the drink, or gluttony, or whatever branch of vice  they may have chosen for their especial study.  The greater number,  however, take no harm by the excursions into the various departments of  vice which it is incumbent upon them to study.    For the Erewhonians hold that unalloyed virtue is not a thing to be  immoderately indulged in.  I was shown more than one case in which the  real or supposed virtues of parents were visited upon the children to the  third and fourth generation.  The straighteners say that the most that  can be truly said for virtue is that there is a considerable balance in  its favour, and that it is on the whole a good deal better to be on its  side than against it; but they urge that there is much pseudo-virtue  going about, which is apt to let people in very badly before they find it  out.  Those men, they say, are best who are not remarkable either for  vice or virtue.  I told them about Hogarth's idle and industrious  apprentices, but they did not seem to think that the industrious  apprentice was a very nice person.          CHAPTER XI: SOME EREWHONIAN TRIALS      In Erewhon as in other countries there are some courts of justice that  deal with special subjects.  Misfortune generally, as I have above  explained, is considered more or less criminal, but it admits of  classification, and a court is assigned to each of the main heads under  which it can be supposed to fall.  Not very long after I had reached the  capital I strolled into the Personal Bereavement Court, and was much both  interested and pained by listening to the trial of a man who was accused  of having just lost a wife to whom he had been tenderly attached, and who  had left him with three little children, of whom the eldest was only  three years old.    The defence which the prisoner's counsel endeavoured to establish was,  that the prisoner had never really loved his wife; but it broke down  completely, for the public prosecutor called witness after witness who  deposed to the fact that the couple had been devoted to one another, and  the prisoner repeatedly wept as incidents were put in evidence that  reminded him of the irreparable nature of the loss he had sustained.  The  jury returned a verdict of guilty after very little deliberation, but  recommended the prisoner to mercy on the ground that he had but recently  insured his wife's life for a considerable sum, and might be deemed lucky  inasmuch as he had received the money without demur from the insurance  company, though he had only paid two premiums.    I have just said that the jury found the prisoner guilty.  When the judge  passed sentence, I was struck with the way in which the prisoner's  counsel was rebuked for having referred to a work in which the guilt of  such misfortunes as the prisoner's was extenuated to a degree that roused  the indignation of the court.    \"We shall have,\" said the judge, \"these crude and subversionary books  from time to time until it is recognised as an axiom of morality that  luck is the only fit object of human veneration.  How far a man has any  right to be more lucky and hence more venerable than his neighbours, is a  point that always has been, and always will be, settled proximately by a  kind of higgling and haggling of the market, and ultimately by brute  force; but however this may be, it stands to reason that no man should be  allowed to be unlucky to more than a very moderate extent.\"    Then, turning to the prisoner, the judge continued:--\"You have suffered a  great loss.  Nature attaches a severe penalty to such offences, and human  law must emphasise the decrees of nature.  But for the recommendation of  the jury I should have given you six months' hard labour.  I will,  however, commute your sentence to one of three months, with the option of  a fine of twenty-five per cent. of the money you have received from the  insurance company.\"    The prisoner thanked the judge, and said that as he had no one to look  after his children if he was sent to prison, he would embrace the option  mercifully permitted him by his lordship, and pay the sum he had named.  He was then removed from the dock.    The next case was that of a youth barely arrived at man's estate, who was  charged with having been swindled out of large property during his  minority by his guardian, who was also one of his nearest relations.  His  father had been long dead, and it was for this reason that his offence  came on for trial in the Personal Bereavement Court.  The lad, who was  undefended, pleaded that he was young, inexperienced, greatly in awe of  his guardian, and without independent professional advice.  \"Young man,\"  said the judge sternly, \"do not talk nonsense.  People have no right to  be young, inexperienced, greatly in awe of their guardians, and without  independent professional advice.  If by such indiscretions they outrage  the moral sense of their friends, they must expect to suffer  accordingly.\"  He then ordered the prisoner to apologise to his guardian,  and to receive twelve strokes with a cat-of-nine-tails.    But I shall perhaps best convey to the reader an idea of the entire  perversion of thought which exists among this extraordinary people, by  describing the public trial of a man who was accused of pulmonary  consumption--an offence which was punished with death until quite  recently.  It did not occur till I had been some months in the country,  and I am deviating from chronological order in giving it here; but I had  perhaps better do so in order that I may exhaust this subject before  proceeding to others.  Moreover I should never come to an end were I to  keep to a strictly narrative form, and detail the infinite absurdities  with which I daily came in contact.    The prisoner was placed in the dock, and the jury were sworn much as in  Europe; almost all our own modes of procedure were reproduced, even to  the requiring the prisoner to plead guilty or not guilty.  He pleaded not  guilty, and the case proceeded.  The evidence for the prosecution was  very strong; but I must do the court the justice to observe that the  trial was absolutely impartial.  Counsel for the prisoner was allowed to  urge everything that could be said in his defence: the line taken was  that the prisoner was simulating consumption in order to defraud an  insurance company, from which he was about to buy an annuity, and that he  hoped thus to obtain it on more advantageous terms.  If this could have  been shown to be the case he would have escaped a criminal prosecution,  and been sent to a hospital as for a moral ailment.  The view, however,  was one which could not be reasonably sustained, in spite of all the  ingenuity and eloquence of one of the most celebrated advocates of the  country.  The case was only too clear, for the prisoner was almost at the  point of death, and it was astonishing that he had not been tried and  convicted long previously.  His coughing was incessant during the whole  trial, and it was all that the two jailors in charge of him could do to  keep him on his legs until it was over.    The summing up of the judge was admirable.  He dwelt upon every point  that could be construed in favour of the prisoner, but as he proceeded it  became clear that the evidence was too convincing to admit of doubt, and  there was but one opinion in the court as to the impending verdict when  the jury retired from the box.  They were absent for about ten minutes,  and on their return the foreman pronounced the prisoner guilty.  There  was a faint murmur of applause, but it was instantly repressed.  The  judge then proceeded to pronounce sentence in words which I can never  forget, and which I copied out into a note-book next day from the report  that was published in the leading newspaper.  I must condense it  somewhat, and nothing which I could say would give more than a faint idea  of the solemn, not to say majestic, severity with which it was delivered.  The sentence was as follows:-    \"Prisoner at the bar, you have been accused of the great crime of  labouring under pulmonary consumption, and after an impartial trial  before a jury of your countrymen, you have been found guilty.  Against  the justice of the verdict I can say nothing: the evidence against you  was conclusive,"]]]
