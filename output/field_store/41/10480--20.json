The tories were now reduced to a very perplexed  situation. They could not oppose the bill without hazarding the  interest they had so lately acquired, nor assent to it without solemnly  renouncing their former arguments and distinctions. They made no great  objections to the first part, and even proposed to enact, That those  should be deemed good laws for the time to come; but they refused to  declare them valid for that which was past. After a long debate, the  bill was committed; yet the whigs lost their majority on the report;  nevertheless, the bill was recovered, and passed with some alteration in  the words; in consequence of a nervous spirited protest, signed Bolton,  Macclesfield, Stamford, Newport, Bedford, Her bert, Suffolk, Monmouth,  Delamere, and Oxford. The whole interest of the court was thrown into  the scale with this bill, before it would preponderate against the  tories; the chiefs of whom, with the earl of Nottingham at their head,  protested in their turn. The same party in the house of commons were  determined upon a vigorous opposition; and in the mean time some  trifling objections were made, that it might be committed for amendment;  but their design was prematurely discovered by one of their faction,  who chanced to question the legality of the convention, as it was not  summoned by the king's writ. This insinuation was answered by Somers the  solicitor general, who observed, that if it was not a legal parliament,  they who were then met, and who had taken the oaths enacted by that  parliament, were guilty of high treason; the laws repealed by it were  still in force: it was their duty therefore to return to king James; and  all concerned in collecting and paying the money levied by the acts of  that parliament were highly criminal. The tories were so struck with  these arguments that the bill passed without further opposition, and  immediately received the royal assent. Thus the settlement was confirmed  by those very people who had so loudly exclaimed against it as illegal;  but the whigs, with all their management, would not have gained their  point had not the court been interested in the dispute.    {WILLIAM AND MARY, 1688--1701.}        ANOTHER VIOLENT CONTEST.    There was another violent contest between the two parties, on the import  of a bill requiring all subjects in office to abjure king James on pain  of imprisonment. Though the clergy were at first exempted from this  test, the main body of the tories opposed it with great vehemence; while  the whigs, under countenance of the ministry, supported it with equal  vigour. It produced long and violent debates; and the two factions  seemed pretty equally balanced. At length the tories represented to  the king that a great deal of precious time would be lost in fruitless  altercation; that those who declared against the bill would grow sullen  and intractable, so as to oppose every other motion that might be made  for the king's service; that, in case of its being carried, his majesty  must fall again into the hands of the whigs, who would renew their  former practices against the prerogative; and many individuals, who  were now either well affected to him, or at least neutral, would become  Jacobites from resentment. These suggestions had such weight with king  William, that he sent an intimation to the commons, desiring they would  drop the debate and proceed to matters that were more pressing. The  whigs in general were disgusted at this interposition; and the earl of  Shrewsbury, who had interested himself warmly in behalf of the bill,  resented it so deeply that he insisted on resigning his office of  secretary of state. The king, who revered his talents and integrity,  employed Dr. Tillotson and others, who were supposed to have credit with  the earl, to dissuade him from quitting his employment; but he continued  deaf to all their remonstrances, and would not even comply with the  request of his majesty, who pressed him to keep the seals until he  should return from Ireland. Long debates were likewise managed in the  house of lords upon the bill of abjuration, or rather an oath of special  fidelity to William, in opposition to James. The tories professed  themselves willing to enter into a negative engagement against the late  king and his adherents; but they opposed the oath of abjuration with all  their might: and the house was so equally divided that neither side was  willing to hazard a decision, so that all the fruit of their debates was  a prolongation of the session.          KING WILLIAM LANDS IN IRELAND.    An act was prepared for investing the queen with the administration  during the king's absence; another for reversing the judgment on a _quo  warranto_ against the city of London, and restoring it to its ancient  rights and privileges; at length the bill of indemnity so cordially  recommended by the king passed both houses. [021] _[See note G, at the  end of this Vol.]_ On the twenty-first day of May, the king closed the  session with a Short speech, in which he thanked them for the supplies  they had granted, and recommended to them a punctual discharge of their  duties in their respective counties, that the peace of the nation might  not be interrupted in his absence. The houses were adjourned to the  seventh day of July, when the parliament was prorogued and adjourned  successively. As a further security for the peace of the kingdom, the  deputy-lieutenants were authorized to raise the militia in case of  necessity. All papists were prohibited to stir above five miles from  their respective places of abode; a proclamation was published for  apprehending certain disaffected persons; sir John Cochran and Ferguson  were actually arrested on suspicion of treasonable practices. On the  fourth day of June the king set out for Ireland, attended by prince  George of Denmark, the duke of Ormond, the earls of Oxford, Scarborough,  Manchester, and many other persons of distinction: on the fourteenth  day of the month he landed at Carrickfergus, from whence he immediately  proceeded to Belfast, where he was met by the duke of Schomberg, the  prince of Wirtemberg, major-general Kirke, and other officers. By this  time colonel Wolsey, at the head of a thousand men, had defeated a  strong detachment of the enemy near Belturbat; sir John Lanier had  taken Bedloe castle; and that of Charlemont, a strong post of great  importance, together with Balingary near Cavan, had been reduced. King  William having reposed himself for two or three days at Belfast, visited  the duke's head-quarters at Lis-burne; then advancing to Hillsborough,  published an order against pressing horses, and committing violence on  the country people. When some of his general officers proposed cautious  measures, he declared he did not come to Ireland to let the grass  grow under his feet. He ordered the army to encamp and be reviewed  at Loughbrilland, where he found it amount to six-and-thirty thousand  effective men, well appointed. Then he marched to Dundalk; and  afterwards advanced to Ardee, which the enemy had just abandoned.          JAMES MARCHES TO THE BOYNE.    King James trusted so much to the disputes in the English parliament,  that he did not believe his son-in-law would be able to quit that  kingdom; and William had been six days in Ireland before he received  intimation of his arrival. This was no sooner known than he left  Dublin under the guard of the militia commanded by Luttrel, and with  a reinforcement of six thousand infantry, which he had lately received  from France, joined the rest of his forces, which now almost equalled  William's army in number, exclusive of about fifteen thousand men who  remained in different garrisons. He occupied a very advantageous post  on the bank of the Boyne, and, contrary to the advice of his general  officers, resolved to stand battle. They proposed to strengthen their  garrisons and retire to the Shannon to wait the effect of the operations  at sea. Louis had promised to equip a powerful armament against the  English fleet, and send over a great number of small frigates to destroy  William's transports, as soon as their convoy should be returned to  England. The execution of this scheme was not at all difficult, and must  have proved fatal to the English army; for their stores and ammunition  were still on board; the ships sailed along the coast as the troops  advanced in their march; and there was not one secure harbour into  which they could retire on any emergency. James, however, was bent upon  hazarding an engagement; and expressed uncommon confidence and alacrity.  Besides the river which was deep, his front was secured by a morass and  a rising ground, so that the English army could not attack him without  manifest disadvantage.          WILLIAM RESOLVES TO GIVE HIM BATTLE    King William marched up to the opposite bank of the river, and, as  he reconnoitred their situation, was exposed to the fire of some  field-pieces which the enemy purposely planted against his person.  They killed a man and two horses close by him; and the second bullet,  rebounding from the earth, grazed upon his right shoulder so as to carry  off part of his clothes and skin, and produce a considerable contusion.  This accident, which he bore without the least emotion, created some  confusion among his attendants, which the enemy perceiving, concluded  he was killed, and shouted aloud in token of their joy. The whole camp  resounded with acclamation; and several squadrons of their horse  were drawn down towards the river as if they had intended to pass  it immediately and attack the English army. The report was instantly  communicated from place to place until it reached Dublin; from thence  it was conveyed to Paris, where, contrary to the custom of the French  court, the people were encouraged to celebrate the event with bonfires  and illuminations."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19218"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.III. (#17)"],[1," the rest.\" Pitt then said,  that in all our wants of money, no minister, since the revolution,  had ever thought of taxing the American colonies; that he had, when in  office, refused to burn his fingers with an American Stamp Act; and he  recapitulated his arguments to prove that legislation and taxation were  two different things, and that while we had a right to regulate the  trade of the colonists, we could not legally or justly impose taxes upon  them. He then asserted, that the profits to Great Britain from the trade  of the colonies were two millions a year, and that this was the sum  which carried England triumphantly through the last war, and the price  America paid us for protection. \"And shall,\" he asked, \"a miserable  financier come with a boast, that he can fetch a peppercorn into the  exchequer by the loss of millions to the nation?\" He added--\"I am  convinced the whole commercial system of America may be altered to  advantage: you have prohibited where you ought to have encouraged,  and you have encouraged where you ought to have prohibited: improper  restraints have been laid on the Continent in favour of the islands. Let  the acts of parliament, in consequence of treaties, remain; but let not  an English minister become a custom-house officer for Spain or for any  foreign power. Much is wrong; much may be amended for the general  good of the whole. The gentleman must not wonder that he was not  contradicted, when, as a minister, he asserted the right of parliament  to tax America. I know not how it is, but there is a modesty in this  house which does not choose to contradict a minister--even your chair,  sir, looks towards St. James's. I wish gentlemen would think better of  this modesty; if they do not, perhaps the collective body may begin to  abate of its respect for the representative. A great deal has been said  without doors of the power, the strength of America--it is a topic that  ought to be cautiously meddled with. In a good cause, on a sound bottom,  the force of this country can crush America to atoms; but on this  ground, on the Stamp Act, when so many here will think it a crying  injustice, I am one who will lift up my hands against it;--in such a  cause your success would be hazardous. America, if she fell, would fall  like a strong man; she would embrace the pillars of the state, and  pull down the constitution along with her.\" Pitt, then deprecating  the conduct of those who judged the Americans with an eye of severity,  said--\"I acknowledge they have not acted in all things with prudence  and temper; they have been wronged; they have been driven to madness  by injustice. Will you punish them for the madness you have occasioned?  Rather let prudence and temper come first from this side. I will  undertake for America that she will follow the example. There are  two lines in a ballad of Prior, on a man's behaviour to his wife,  so applicable to you and your colonies, that I cannot help repeating  them:--         'Be to her faults a little blind;        Be to her virtues very kind.'\"    Pitt concluded by proposing that the Stamp Act should be repealed,  absolutely, totally, and immediately; but at the same time he advised,  that the repeal should be accompanied by the strongest declaration of  the sovereign authority of this country over the colonies, in everything  that relates to trade and manufactures--in fact, in everything except  taking their money out of their pockets without their consent.    This speech of Mr. Pitt had a potent effect upon the administration and  the country at large. Nearly all the ministers coincided in his views,  and petitions, which poured into the house from all parts against the  stamp act, and which had been imperiously rejected by the late cabinet,  were received with all due deference. Burke made two speeches against  it, which were commended by Pitt, and filled the town with wonder. So  great was the change in public opinion upon the subject, that a bill was  brought in by the ministers for the repeal of the act, which bill was  passed by a great majority. It was accompanied by a declaratory bill,  setting forth the supreme right, sovereignty, &c. of Great Britain over  her colonies in all other matters of legislation, and reprobating the  tumultuous proceedings of the colonists. The repeal act was sent up  to the lords, where it encountered a violent opposition, but it passed  toward the end of March, when it received the reluctant consent of the  crown. Sixty-one peers entered a strong protest against its non-taxing  principle, and it was observed that in both houses the members belonging  to the royal household voted with the opposition: a strong proof of his  majesty's feeling upon this subject.    It was asserted by some that ministers were \"bullied\" into the repeal  of the stamp act by Pitt. This was manifestly unjust, both to the  great orator and the ministers themselves. In this session they showed  themselves equally ready to redress grievances at home as in America.  Thus they proposed and carried a repeal of the obnoxious cider-tax,  laying on a different duty, and the mode of collecting it; they passed  an act for restraining the importation of foreign silks; and they  abolished the old duties on houses and windows, and settled the rates  with greater equity toward the middle and lower classes of society. They  also appeased the general apprehension of a scarcity of bread, by  orders to prevent the exportation of corn, and by enforcing the old laws  against monopoly, forestalling, and regrating. Moreover, they passed a  bill for opening free ports in the islands of Dominica and Jamaica; made  several new and important regulations in the commercial system of the  colonies; and took off some burdensome restrictions. Finally, they  promoted the extension of trade in general by a commercial treaty with  Russia, and they obtained from France a liquidation of those bills which  had been left unsettled since the cession of Canada.    Still, though the legislative acts of this administration were of great  importance to the country, and were calculated to insure popularity,  its doom was sealed. By a large portion of the community, the members of  which it was composed were considered as intruders, who kept Pitt out  of office, and they had lost the confidence of the king by the repeal  of the Stamp Act. The resentment of the king was also excited by their  omitting to procure a supply of money for his younger brothers. Sensible  of their weakness, the Duke of Grafton resigned office, and the seals  which he resigned were given to the Duke of Richmond. When he resigned  he declared that he had no fault to find with his colleague's, except  that they wanted strength, and that his opinion was, Mr. Pitt alone  could give vigour and solidity to any administration in the present  state of affairs. Under him, his grace said, he was \"willing to serve  in any capacity, not merely as a general officer, but as a pioneer:  under him he would take up a spade or a mattock.\" Such was the situation  in which the ministers found themselves at the close of this session,  which was prorogued early in June.          SENTIMENTS OF THE AMERICANS ON THE DECLARATORY ACT.    The manner in which the repeal of the Stamp Act was received in America  seemed to justify the measure. Although accompanied with the Declaratory  Act, it was welcomed by many persons among the higher classes, of honest  and upright mind, with great satisfaction. Washington declared that  those who were instrumental in procuring the repeal were entitled to the  thanks of all well-wishers to Great Britain and her colonies. There  were fierce republican spirits, however, in New England, who viewed the  Declaratory Act in the same light which they had viewed the Stamp Act;  and as soon as the first burst of joy had subsided, this was made the  subject of their declamation, and a stimulus to popular excitement.  Public writers were employed to prevent a return of harmony between  Great Britain and her colonies, and though addresses of thanks were  voted by the assemblies to the king, this was but an evanescent show  of gratitude. The same temper was found especially to prevail in the  assembly of Massachusets against the Declaratory Act, as had been  displayed against the Stamp Act, and the spirit of resistance soon  spread to the other colonies. The right of legislative authority assumed  by Great Britain over her colonies was loudly questioned, and bills were  passed in the assemblies independently of the British parliament, and  in defiance of our declared sovereign legislative right. One breach was  therefore healed by the repeal of the Stamp Act, but another was opened  by the scarcely less obnoxious act with which it was accompanied. A tree  of liberty had been planted, and there was a universal disposition  to preserve its leaves and its fruits from the touch of kingly and  sovereign power.          THE DISSOLUTION OF THE ROCKINGHAM CABINET.    The seeds of the dissolution of the ministry, as before shown, were  thickly scattered, and it was easy to foresee that the event was at  no great distance. Its fall, however, might have been retarded for a  little space, had it not been for the intrigues of the chancellor, Henry  Earl of Northington. In order to discredit the cabinet, that nobleman  started numerous difficulties on some legal points that were submitted  to his judgment, and set on foot several intrigues, which accelerated  its downfall. The first token of his defection appeared in the strong  dissatisfaction which he exhibited on account of the commercial treaty  with Russia, and it was soon after made more fully manifest in a meeting  of ministers on the subject of the government of Canada. There appears  to have been no good ground for his opposition, but Northington panted  for retirement, and longed to serve his ancient friend Pitt; whence it  pleased him to denounce a"]]]
