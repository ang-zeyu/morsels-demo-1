If you can promise to take  the place of this widow's son and support the woman in her old age, I am  quite willing to spare you from a disgraceful death. What say you, will  you accept my offer?\"    [Illustration: \"THE TIGER GRAVELY NODDED HIS HEAD.\"]    The gaping people craned their necks to see what would happen, and once  more they were surprised to see the savage beast nod his head in silent  agreement.    \"Very well, then, you are free to return to your mountain home; only, of  course, you must remember your promise.\"    The chains were taken from the tiger's neck, and the great animal walked  silently out of the yamen, down the street, and through the gate opening  towards his beloved mountain cave.    Once more the old woman was very angry. As she hobbled from the room,  she cast sour glances at the judge, muttering over and over again, \"Who  ever heard of a tiger taking the place of a son? A pretty game this is,  to catch the brute, and then to set him free.\" There was nothing for her  to do, however, but to return home, for the judge had given strict  orders that on no account was she to appear before him again.    Almost broken-hearted she entered her desolate hovel at the foot of the  mountain. Her neighbours shook their heads as they saw her. \"She cannot  live long,\" they said. \"She has the look of death on her wrinkled face.  Poor soul! she has nothing to live for, nothing to keep her from  starving.\"    But they were mistaken. Next morning when the old woman went outside to  get a breath of fresh air she found a newly killed deer in front of her  door. Her tiger-son had begun to keep his promise, for she could see the  marks of his claws on the dead animal's body. She took the carcass into  the house and dressed it for the market. On the city streets next day  she had no trouble in selling the flesh and skin for a handsome sum of  money. All had heard of the tiger's first gift, and no one was anxious  to drive a close bargain.    Laden with food, the happy woman went home rejoicing, with money enough  to keep her for many a day. A week later the tiger came to her door  with a roll of cloth and some money in his mouth. He dropped these new  gifts at her feet and ran away without even waiting for her thank-you.  The Widow T'ang now saw that the judge had acted wisely. She stopped  grieving for her dead son and began to love in his stead the handsome  animal that had come to take his place so willingly.    The tiger grew much attached to his foster-mother and often purred  contentedly outside her door, waiting for her to come and stroke his  soft fur. He no longer had the old desire to kill. The sight of blood  was not nearly so tempting as it had been in his younger days. Year  after year he brought the weekly offerings to his mistress until she was  as well provided for as any other widow in the country.    At last in the course of nature the good old soul died. Kind friends  laid her away in her last resting place at the foot of the great  mountain. There was money enough left out of what she had saved to put  up a handsome tombstone, on which this story was written just as you  have read it here. The faithful tiger mourned long for his dear  mistress. He lay on her grave, wailing like a child that had lost its  mother. Long he listened for the voice he had loved so well, long he  searched the mountain-slopes, returning each night to the empty cottage,  but all in vain. She whom he loved was gone for ever.    One night he vanished from the mountain, and from that day to this no  one in that province has ever seen him. Some who know this story say  that he died of grief in a secret cave which he had long used as a  hiding-place. Others add, with a wise shrug of the shoulders, that, like  Shanwang, he was taken to the Western Heaven, there to be rewarded for  his deeds of virtue and to live as a fairy for ever afterwards.          THE PRINCESS KWAN-YIN    [Illustration]      Once upon a time in China there lived a certain king who had three  daughters. The fairest and best of these was Kwan-yin, the youngest.  The old king was justly proud of this daughter, for of all the women who  had ever lived in the palace she was by far the most attractive. It did  not take him long, therefore, to decide that she should be the heir to  his throne, and her husband ruler of his kingdom. But, strange to say,  Kwan-yin was not pleased at this good fortune. She cared little for the  pomp and splendour of court life. She foresaw no pleasure for herself in  ruling as a queen, but even feared that in so high a station she might  feel out of place and unhappy.    Every day she went to her room to read and study. As a result of this  daily labour she soon went far beyond her sisters along the paths of  knowledge, and her name was known in the farthest corner of the kingdom  as \"Kwan-yin, the wise princess.\" Besides being very fond of books,  Kwan-yin was thoughtful of her friends. She was careful about her  behaviour both in public and in private. Her warm heart was open at all  times to the cries of those in trouble. She was kind to the poor and  suffering. She won the love of the lower classes, and was to them a sort  of goddess to whom they could appeal whenever they were hungry and in  need. Some people even believed that she was a fairy who had come to  earth from her home within the Western Heaven, while others said that  once, long years before, she had lived in the world as a prince instead  of a princess. However this may be, one thing is certain--Kwan-yin was  pure and good, and well deserved the praises that were showered upon  her.    One day the king called this favourite daughter to the royal bedside,  for he felt that the hour of death was drawing near. Kwan-yin kowtowed  before her royal father, kneeling and touching her forehead on the floor  in sign of deepest reverence. The old man bade her rise and come closer.  Taking her hand tenderly in his own, he said, \"Daughter, you know well  how I love you. Your modesty and virtue, your talent and your love of  knowledge, have made you first in my heart. As you know already, I chose  you as heir to my kingdom long ago. I promised that your husband should  be made ruler in my stead. The time is almost ripe for me to ascend upon  the dragon and become a guest on high. It is necessary that you be given  at once in marriage.\"    \"But, most exalted father,\" faltered the princess, \"I am not ready to be  married.\"    \"Not ready, child! Why, are you not eighteen? Are not the daughters of  our nation often wedded long before they reach that age? Because of your  desire for learning I have spared you thus far from any thought of a  husband, but now we can wait no longer.\"    \"Royal father, hear your child, and do not compel her to give up her  dearest pleasures. Let her go into a quiet convent where she may lead  a life of study!\"    The king sighed deeply at hearing these words. He loved his daughter and  did not wish to wound her. \"Kwan-yin,\" he continued, \"do you wish to  pass by the green spring of youth, to give up this mighty kingdom? Do  you wish to enter the doors of a convent where women say farewell to  life and all its pleasures? No! your father will not permit this. It  grieves me sorely to disappoint you, but one month from this very day  you shall be married. I have chosen for your royal partner a man of many  noble parts. You know him by name already, although you have not seen  him. Remember that, of the hundred virtues filial conduct is the chief,  and that you owe more to me than to all else on earth.\"    Kwan-yin turned pale. Trembling, she would have sunk to the floor, but  her mother and sisters supported her, and by their tender care brought  her back to consciousness.    Every day of the month that followed, Kwan-yin's relatives begged her to  give up what they called her foolish notion. Her sisters had long since  given up hope of becoming queen. They were amazed at her stupidity. The  very thought of any one's choosing a convent instead of a throne was to  them a sure sign of madness. Over and over again they asked her reason  for making so strange a choice. To every question, she shook her head,  replying, \"A voice from the heavens speaks to me, and I must obey it.\"    On the eve of the wedding day Kwan-yin slipped out of the palace, and,  after a weary journey, arrived at a convent called, \"The Cloister of the  White Sparrow.\" She was dressed as a poor maiden. She said she wished to  become a nun. The abbess, not knowing who she was, did not receive her  kindly. Indeed, she told Kwan-yin that they could not receive her into  the sisterhood, that the building was full. Finally, after Kwan-yin had  shed many tears, the abbess let her enter, but only as a sort of  servant, who might be cast out for the slightest fault.    Now that Kwan-yin found herself in the life which she had long dreamt  of leading, she tried to be satisfied. But the nuns seemed to wish to  make her stay among them most miserable. They gave her the hardest tasks  to do, and it was seldom that she had a minute to rest. All day long  she was busy, carrying water from a well at the foot of the convent hill  or gathering wood from a neighbouring forest. At night when her back  was almost breaking, she was given many extra tasks, enough to have  crushed the spirit of any other woman than this brave daughter of  a king. Forgetting her grief, and trying to hide the lines of pain  that sometimes wrinkled her fair forehead, she tried to make these  hard-hearted women love her. In return for their rough words, she  spoke to them kindly, and never did she give way to anger.    One day while poor Kwan-yin was picking up brushwood in the forest she  heard a tiger making his way through the bushes. Having no means of  defending herself, she breathed a silent prayer to the gods for help,  and calmly awaited the coming of the great beast.

He moved on to the next row of shelves. \"The Drama. The  Restoration dramatists. You can have most of them. Still, as you well  remark, many people seem to love them. Shaw, Wilde, Robertson--I like  reading plays, Bill. There are not many people who do, but those who do  are usually very keen. Let us pass on.\"    \"I say, we haven't too much time,\" said Bill restlessly.    \"We haven't. That's why we aren't wasting any. Poetry. Who reads poetry  nowadays? Bill, when did you last read 'Paradise Lost'?\"    \"Never.\"    \"I thought not. And when did Miss Calladine last read 'The Excursion'  aloud to you?\"    \"As a matter of fact, Betty--Miss Calladine--happens to be jolly keen on  --what's the beggar's name?\"    \"Never mind his name. You have said quite enough. We pass on.\"    He moved on to the next shelf.    \"Biography. Oh, lots of it. I love biographies. Are you a member of the  Johnson Club? I bet Mark is. 'Memories of Many Courts'--I'm sure Mrs.  Calladine reads that. Anyway, biographies are just as interesting as  most novels, so why linger? We pass on.\" He went to the next shelf, and  then gave a sudden whistle. \"Hallo, hallo!\"    \"What's the matter?\" said Bill rather peevishly.    \"Stand back there. Keep the crowd back, Bill. We are getting amongst it.  Sermons, as I live. Sermons. Was Mark's father a clergyman, or does Mark  take to them naturally?\"    \"His father was a parson, I believe. Oh, yes, I know he was.\"    \"Ah, then these are Father's books. 'Half-Hours with the Infinite'--I  must order that from the library when I get back. 'The Lost Sheep,'  'Jones on the Trinity,' 'The Epistles of St. Paul Explained.' Oh, Bill,  we're amongst it. 'The Narrow Way, being Sermons by the Rev. Theodore  Ussher'--hal-LO!\"    \"What is the matter?\"    \"William, I am inspired. Stand by.\" He took down the Reverend Theodore  Ussher's classic work, looked at it with a happy smile for a moment, and  then gave it to Bill.    \"Here, hold Ussher for a bit.\"    Bill took the book obediently.    \"No, give it me back. Just go out into the hall, and see if you can hear  Cayley anywhere. Say 'Hallo' loudly, if you do.\"    Bill went out quickly, listened, and came back.    \"It's all right.\"    \"Good.\" He took the book out of its shelf again. \"Now then, you can hold  Ussher. Hold him in the left hand so. With the right or dexter hand,  grasp this shelf firmly so. Now, when I say 'Pull,' pull gradually. Got  that?\"    Bill nodded, his face alight with excitement.    \"Good.\" Antony put his hand into the space left by the stout Ussher, and  fingered the back of the shelf. \"Pull,\" he said.    Bill pulled.    \"Now just go on pulling like that. I shall get it directly. Not hard,  you know, but just keeping up the strain.\"    His fingers went at it again busily.    And then suddenly the whole row of shelves, from top to bottom, swung  gently open towards them.    \"Good Lord!\" said Bill, letting go of the shelf in his amazement.    Antony pushed the shelves back, extracted Ussher from Bill's fingers,  replaced him, and then, taking Bill by the arm, led him to the sofa and  deposited him in it. Standing in front of him, he bowed gravely.    \"Child's play, Watson,\" he said; \"child's play.\"    \"How on earth--\"    Antony laughed happily and sat down on the sofa beside him.    \"You don't really want it explained,\" he said, smacking him on the knee;  \"you're just being Watsonish. It's very nice of you, of course, and I  appreciate it.\"    \"No, but really, Tony.\"    \"Oh, my dear Bill!\" He smoked silently for a little, and then went on,  \"It's what I was saying just now--a secret is a secret until you have  discovered it, and as soon as you have discovered it, you wonder why  everybody else isn't discovering it, and how it could ever have been a  secret at all. This passage has been here for years, with an opening at  one end into the library, and at the other end into the shed. Then Mark  discovered it, and immediately he felt that everybody else must discover  it. So he made the shed end more difficult by putting the croquet-box  there, and this end more difficult by--\" he stopped and looked at the  other \"by what, Bill?\"    But Bill was being Watsonish.    \"What?\"    \"Obviously by re-arranging his books. He happened to take out 'The Life  of Nelson' or 'Three Men in a Boat,' or whatever it was, and by the  merest chance discovered the secret. Naturally he felt that everybody  else would be taking down 'The Life of Nelson' or 'Three Men in a  Boat.' Naturally he felt that the secret would be safer if nobody ever  interfered with that shelf at all. When you said that the books had been  re-arranged a year ago--just about the time the croquet-box came into  existence--of course, I guessed why. So I looked about for the dullest  books I could find, the books nobody ever read. Obviously the collection  of sermon-books of a mid-Victorian clergyman was the shelf we wanted.\"    \"Yes, I see. But why were you so certain of the particular place?\"    \"Well, he had to mark the particular place by some book. I thought  that the joke of putting 'The Narrow Way' just over the entrance to the  passage might appeal to him. Apparently it did.\"    Bill nodded to himself thoughtfully several times. \"Yes, that's very  neat,\" he said. \"You're a clever devil, Tony.\"    Tony laughed.    \"You encourage me to think so, which is bad for me, but very  delightful.\"    \"Well, come on, then,\" said Bill, and he got up, and held out a hand.    \"Come on where?\"    \"To explore the passage, of course.\"    Antony shook his head.    \"Why ever not?\"    \"Well, what do you expect to find there?\"    \"I don't know. But you seemed to think that we might find something that  would help.\"    \"Suppose we find Mark?\" said Antony quietly.    \"I say, do you really think he's there?\"    \"Suppose he is?\"    \"Well, then, there we are.\"    Antony walked over to the fireplace, knocked out the ashes of his pipe,  and turned back to Bill. He looked at him gravely without speaking.    \"What are you going to say to him?\" he said at last.    \"How do you mean?\"    \"Are you going to arrest him, or help him to escape?\"    \"I--I--well, of course, I--\" began Bill, stammering, and then ended  lamely, \"Well, I don't know.\"    \"Exactly. We've got to make up our minds, haven't we?\"    Bill didn't answer. Very much disturbed in his mind, he walked  restlessly about the room, frowning to himself, stopping now and then  at the newly discovered door and looking at it as if he were trying to  learn what lay behind it. Which side was he on, if it came to choosing  sides--Mark's or the Law's?    \"You know, you can't just say, 'Oh er hallo!' to him,\" said Antony,  breaking rather appropriately into his thoughts.    Bill looked up at him with a start.    \"Nor,\" went on Antony, \"can you say, 'This is my friend Mr. Gillingham,  who is staying with you. We were just going to have a game of bowls.'\"    \"Yes, it's dashed difficult. I don't know what to say. I've been rather  forgetting about Mark.\" He wandered over to the window and looked out on  to the lawns. There was a gardener clipping the grass edges. No reason  why the lawn should be untidy just because the master of the house had  disappeared. It was going to be a hot day again. Dash it, of course he  had forgotten Mark. How could he think of him as an escaped murderer,  a fugitive from justice, when everything was going on just as it did  yesterday, and the sun was shining just as it did when they all drove  off to their golf, only twenty-four hours ago? How could he help feeling  that this was not real tragedy, but merely a jolly kind of detective  game that he and Antony were playing?    He turned back to his friend.    \"All the same,\" he said, \"you wanted to find the passage, and now you've  found it. Aren't you going into it at all?\"    Antony took his arm.    \"Let's go outside again,\" he said. \"We can't go into it now, anyhow.  It's too risky, with Cayley about. Bill, I feel like you--just a little  bit frightened. But what I'm frightened of I don't quite know. Anyway,  you want to go on with it, don't you?\"    \"Yes,\" said Bill firmly. \"We must.\"    \"Then we'll explore the passage this afternoon, if we get the chance.  And if we don't get the chance, then we'll try it to-night.\"    They walked across the hall and out into the sunlight again.    \"Do you really think we might find Mark hiding there?\" asked Bill.    \"It's possible,\" said Antony. \"Either Mark or--\" He pulled himself up  quickly. \"No,\" he murmured to himself, \"I won't let myself think  that--not yet, anyway. It's too horrible.\"          CHAPTER XII. A Shadow on the Wall      In the twenty hours or so at his disposal Inspector Birch had been busy.  He had telegraphed to London a complete description of Mark in the brown  flannel suit which he had last been seen wearing; he had made inquiries  at Stanton as to whether anybody answering to this description had  been seen leaving by the 4.20; and though the evidence which had been  volunteered to him had been inconclusive, it made it possible that  Mark had indeed caught that train, and had arrived in London before the  police at the other end had been ready to receive him. But the fact that  it was market-day at Stanton, and that the little town would be more  full than usual of visitors, made it less likely that either the  departure of Mark by the 4.20, or the arrival of Robert by the 2.10  earlier in the afternoon, would have been particularly noticed. As  Antony had said to Cayley, there would always be somebody ready to hand  the police a circumstantial story of the movements of any man in whom  the police were interested.    That Robert had come by the 2.10 seemed fairly certain. To find out more  about him in time for the inquest would be difficult. All that was known  about him in the village where he and Mark had lived as boys bore out  the evidence "]]]
