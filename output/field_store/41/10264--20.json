We  had a poem, of about 500 lines, lying by us--one quite as good as  new--one, at all events, that we considered would answer sufficiently  well for an audience of Transcendentalists. _That_ we gave them--it was  the best that we had--for the price--and it _did_ answer remarkably  well. Its name was _not_ 'The Messenger-Star'--who but Miss Walter would  ever think of so delicious a little bit of invention as that? We had no  name for it at all. The poem is what is occasionally called a 'juvenile  poem,' but the fact is it is anything but juvenile now, for we wrote it,  printed it, and published it, in book form, before we had completed our  tenth year. We read it _verbatim_, from a copy now in our possession, and  which we shall be happy to show at any moment to any of our inquisitive  friends. We do not, ourselves, think the poem a remarkably good one: it  is not sufficiently transcendental. Still it did well enough for the  Boston audience--who evinced characteristic discrimination in  understanding, and especially applauding all those knotty passages which  we ourselves have not yet been able to understand.    \"As regards the auger of _The Boston Times_, and one or two other  absurdities--as regards, we say the wrath of Achilles--we incurred it-or  rather its manifestation--by letting some of our cat out of the bag a few  hours sooner than we had intended. Over a bottle of champagne, that  night, we confessed to Messrs. Cushing, Whipple, Hudson, Fields, and a  few other natives who swear not altogether by the frog-pond-we  confessed, we say, the soft impeachment of the hoax. _Et hine ille irae_.  We should have waited a couple of days.\"    It is scarcely necessary to suggest that this must have been written  before he had quite recovered from the long intoxication which maddened  him at the time to which it refers--that he was not born in Boston-that  the poem was not published in his tenth year, and that the \"hoax\" was all  an after-thought. Two weeks later he renewed the discussion of the  subject in _The Broadway Journal_, commenting as follows upon allusions  to it by other parties:    \"Were the question demanded of us--'What is the most exquisite of  sublunary pleasures?' we should reply, without hesitation, the making a  fuss, or in the classical words of a western friend, the 'kicking up a  bobbery.' Never was a 'bobbery' more delightful than that which we have  just succeeded in 'kicking up' all around about Boston Common. We never  saw the Frogpondians so lively in our lives. They seem absolutely to be  upon the point of waking up. In about nine days the puppies may get open  their eyes. That is to say, they may get open their eyes to certain facts  which have long been obvious to all the world except themselves-the  facts that there exist other cities than Boston--other men of letters  than Professor Longfellow--other vehicles of literary information than  the _Down-East Review_.'    \"We had _tact_ enough not to be 'taken in and done for' by the  Bostonians. _Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes_--(for _timeo_ substitute  _contemno_ or _turn-up-your-nose-o_.) We knew very well that among a  certain _clique_ of the Frogpondians, there existed a predetermination to  abuse us under _any_ circumstances. We knew, that write what we would,  they would swear it to be worthless. We knew, that were we to compose for  them a 'Paradise Lost,' they would pronounce it an indifferent poem. It  would have been very weak in us, then, to put ourselves to the trouble of  attempting to please these people. We preferred pleasing ourselves. We  read before them a 'juvenile'--a _very_ 'juvenile' poem--and thus the  Frogpondians were _had_--were delivered up to the enemy bound hand and  foot. Never were a set of people more completely demolished. They have  blustered and flustered--but what have they done or said that has not  made them more thoroughly ridiculous? What, in the name of Momus, is it  _possible_ for them to do or say? We 'delivered' them the 'juvenile  poem,' and they received it with applause. This is accounted for by the  fact, that the _clique_ (contemptible in numbers as in everything else)  were overruled by the rest of the assembly. These malignants did not  _dare_ to interrupt by their preconcerted hisses, the respectful and  profound attention of the majority. We have been told, indeed, that as  many as three or four of the personal friends of the little old lady  entitled Miss Walter, did actually leave the hall during the  recitation--but, upon the whole, this was the very best thing they could  do. We have been told this, we say--we did not _see_ them take their  departure:--the fact is, they belong to a class of people that we make it  a point _never to see_. The poem being thus well received, in spite of  this ridiculous little cabal--the next thing to be done was to abuse it  in the papers. Here, they imagined, they were sure of their game. But  what have they accomplished? The poem, they say, is bad. We admit it. We  insisted upon this fact in our prefatory remarks, and we insist upon it  now, over and over again. It _is_ bad--it is wretched--and what then? We  wrote it at ten years of age--had it been worth even a pumpkin-pie,  undoubtedly we should not have 'delivered' it to _them_. To demonstrate  its utter worthlessness, _The Boston Star_ has copied the poem in full,  with two or three columns of criticism (we suppose), by way of explaining  that we should have been hanged for its perpetration. There is no doubt  of it whatever--we should. The _Star_, however, (a dull luminary,) has  done us more honor than it intended; it has copied our _third_ edition of  the poem, revised and improved. We considered this too good for the  occasion by one-half, and so 'delivered' our _first_ edition with all its  imperfections on its head. It is the first--the original edition--the  _delivered_ edition--which we now republish in our collection of Poems.\"    When he accepted the invitation of the Lyceum he intended to write an  original poem, upon a subject which he said had haunted his imagination  for years; but cares, anxieties, and feebleness of will, prevented; and a  week before the appointed night he wrote to a friend imploring  assistance. \"You compose with such astonishing facility,\" he urged in his  letter, \"that you can easily furnish me, quite soon enough, a poem that  shall be equal to my reputation. For the love of God I beseech you to  help me in this extremity.\" The lady wrote him kindly, advising him  judiciously, but promising to attempt the fulfillment of his wishes  She was, however, an invalid, and so failed.[C] At last, instead of  pleading illness himself, as he had previously done on a similar  occasion, he determined to read his poem of \"Al Aaraaf,\" the original  publication of which, in 1829, has already been stated.    The last number of the _Broadway Journal_ was published on the third of  January,1846, and Poe soon after commenced the series of papers entitled  \"The Literati of New-York City,\" which was published in _The Lady's Book_  in six numbers, from May to October. Their spirit, boldness, and  occasional causticity caused them to be much talked about, and three  editions were necessary to supply the demand for some numbers of the  magazine containing them. They however led to a disgraceful quarrel, and  this to a premature conclusion. Dr. Thomas Dunn English, who had at one  time sustained the most intimate relations with Poe, chose to evince his  resentment of the critic's unfairness by the publication of a card in  which he painted strongly the infirmities of Poe's life and character,  and alleged that he had on several occasions inflicted upon him personal  chastisement. This was not a wise confession, for a gentleman never  appeals to his physical abilities except for defense. But the entire  publication, even if every word of it were true, was unworthy of Dr.  English, unnecessary, and not called for by Poe's article, though that,  as every one acquainted with the parties might have seen, was entirely  false in what purported to be its facts. The statement of Dr. English  appeared in the New York _Mirror_ of the twenty-third of June, and on the  twenty-seventh Mr. Poe sent to Mr. Godey for publication in the _Lady's  Book_ his rejoinder, which would have made about five of the large pages  of that miscellany. Mr. Godey very properly declined to print it, and  observed, in the communication of his decision, that the tone of the  article was regarded as unsuitable for his work and as altogether wrong.  In compliance with the author's wishes, however, he had caused its  appearance in a daily paper. Poe then wrote to him:    \"The man or men who told you that there was anything wrong in _the tone_  of my reply, were either my enemies, or your enemies, or asses. When you  see them, tell them so, from me. I have never written an article upon  which I more confidently depend for _literary_ reputation than that  Reply. Its merit lay in its being precisely adapted to its purpose. In  this city I have had upon it the favorable judgments of the best men. All  the error about it was yours. You should have done as I  requested--published it in the _Book_. It is of no use to conceive a plan  if you have to depend upon another for its execution.\"    Nevertheless, I agree with Mr. Godey. Poe's article was as bad as that of  English. Yet a part of one of its paragraphs is interesting, and it is  here transcribed:    --\"Let me not permit any profundity of disgust to induce, even for an  instant, a violation of the dignity of truth. What is _not false_, amid  the scurrility of this man's statements, it is not in my nature to brand  as false, although oozing from the filthy lips of which a lie is the  only natural language.

Our only possible plan, in the circumstances, was to recruit the men  outside the town, to camp them somewhere, march them across country to a  way station, and there embark them. Our goods and safari stores we  could then ship out to them by train.    Accordingly we rode on bicycles out to the Swahili village.    This is, as I have said, composed of large \"beehive\" houses thatched  conically with straw. The roofs extend to form verandas beneath which  sit indolent damsels, their hair divided in innumerable tiny parts  running fore and aft like the stripes on a water melon; their figured  'Mericani garments draped gracefully. As befitted the women of  plutocrats, they wore much jewellery, some of it set in their noses.  Most of them did all of nothing, but some sat half buried in narrow  strips of bright-coloured tissue paper. These they were pasting together  like rolls of tape, the coloured edges of the paper forming concentric  patterns on the resultant discs--an infinite labour. The discs, when  completed, were for insertion in the lobes of the ears.    When we arrived the irregular \"streets\" of the village were nearly  empty, save for a few elegant youths, in long kanzuas, or robes of  cinnamon colour and spotless white, on their heads fezzes or turbans, in  their hands slender rattan canes. They were very busy talking to each  other, and of course did not notice the idle beauties beneath the  verandas.    Hardly had we appeared, however, when mysteriously came forth the  headman--a bearded, solemn, Arab-like person with a phenomenally ugly  face but a most pleasing smile. We told him we wanted porters. He  clapped his hands. To the four young men who answered this summons he  gave a command. From sleepy indolence they sprang into life. To the four  cardinal points of the compass they darted away, running up and down the  side streets, beating on the doors, screaming at the tops of their lungs  the word \"Cazi\"[10] over and over again.    The village hummed like a wasps' nest. Men poured from the huts in  swarms. The streets were filled; the idle sauntering youths were  swamped, and sunk from view. Clamour and shouting arose where before had  been a droning silence. The mob beat up to where we stood, surrounding  us, shouting at us. From somewhere some one brought an old table and two  decrepit chairs, battered and rickety in themselves, but symbols of  great authority in a community where nobody habitually used either. Two  naked boys proudly took charge of our bicycles.    We seated ourselves.    \"Fall in!\" we yelled.    About half the crowd fell into rough lines. The rest drew slightly to  one side. Nobody stopped talking for a single instant.    We arose and tackled our job. The first part of it was to segregate the  applicants into their different tribes.    \"Monumwezi hapa!\" we yelled; and the command was repeated and repeated  again by the headman, by his four personal assistants, by a half-dozen  lesser headmen. Slowly the Monumwezi drew aside. We impressed on them  emphatically they must stay thus, and went after, in turn, the Baganda,  the Wakamba, the Swahilis, the Kavirondo, the Kikuyu. When we had them  grouped, we went over them individually. We punched their chests, we ran  over all their joints, we examined their feet, we felt their muscles.  Our victims stood rigidly at inspection, but their numerous friends  surrounded us closely, urging the claims of the man to our notice. It  was rather confusing, but we tried to go at it as though we were alone  in a wilderness. If the man passed muster we motioned him to a rapidly  growing group.    When we had finished we had about sixty men segregated. Then we went  over this picked lot again. This time we tried not only to get good  specimens, but to mix our tribes. At last our count of twenty-nine was  made up, and we took a deep breath. But to us came one of them  complaining that he was a Monumwezi, and that we had picked only three  Monumwezi, and--We cut him short. His contention was quite correct. A  porter tent holds five, and it does not do to mix tribes.  Reorganization! Cut out two extra Kavirondos, and include two more  Monumwezi. \"Bass! finished! Now go get your effects. We start  immediately.\"    As quickly as it had filled, the street cleared. The rejected dived back  into their huts, the newly enlisted carriers went to collect their  baggage. Only remained the headman and his fierce-faced assistants, and  the splendid youths idling up and down--none of them had volunteered,  you may be sure--and the damsels of leisure beneath the porticos. Also  one engaging and peculiar figure hovering near.    This individual had been particularly busy during our recruiting. He had  hustled the men into line, he had advised us for or against different  candidates, he had loudly sung my praises as a man to work for,  although, of course, he knew nothing about me. Now he approached,  saluted, smiled. He was a tall, slenderly-built person, with  phenomenally long, thin legs, slightly rounded shoulders, a forward  thrust, keen face, and remarkably long, slim hands. With these he  gesticulated much, in a right-angled fashion, after the manner of  Egyptian hieroglyphical figures. He was in no manner shenzi. He wore a  fez, a neat khaki coat and shorts, blue puttees and boots. Also a belt  with leather pockets, a bunch of keys, a wrist watch, and a seal ring.  His air was of great elegance and social ease. We took him with us as  C.'s gunbearer. He proved staunch, a good tracker, an excellent hunter,  and a most engaging individual. His name was Kongoni, and he was a  Wakamba.    But now we were confronted with a new problem: that of getting our  twenty-nine chosen ones together again. They had totally disappeared. In  all directions we had emissaries beating up the laggards. As each man  reappeared carrying his little bundle, we lined him up with his  companions. Then when we turned our backs we lost him again; he had  thought of another friend with whom to exchange farewells. At the long  last, however, we got them all collected. The procession started, the  naked boys proudly wheeling our bikes alongside. We saw them fairly  clear of everything, then turned them over to Kongoni, while we returned  to Nairobi to see after our effects.    FOOTNOTES:    [10] Work.          PART IV. A LION HUNT ON KAPITI.          XVII.    AN OSTRICH FARM AT MACHAKOS.      This has to do with a lion hunt on the Kapiti Plains. On the veranda at  Nairobi I had some time previous met Clifford Hill, who had invited me  to visit him at the ostrich farm he and his cousin were running in the  mountains near Machakos. Some time later, a visit to Juja Farm gave me  the opportunity. Juja is only a day's ride from the Hills'. So an  Africander, originally from the south, Captain D., and I sent across a  few carriers with our personal effects, and ourselves rode over on  horseback.    Juja is on the Athi Plains. Between the Athi and Kapiti Plains runs a  range of low mountains around the end of which one can make his way as  around a promontory. The Hills' ostrich farm was on the highlands in the  bay on the other side of the promontory.    It was towards the close of the rainy season, and the rivers were up.  We had to swim our horses within a half-mile of Juja, and got pretty  wet. Shortly after crossing the Athi, however, five miles on, we emerged  on the dry, drained slopes from the hills. Here the grass was long, and  the ticks plentiful. Our horses' legs and chests were black with them;  and when we dismounted for lunch we ourselves were almost immediately  alive with the pests. In this very high grass the game was rather  scarce, but after we had climbed by insensible grades to the shorter  growth we began to see many hartebeeste, zebra, and gazelles, and a few  of the wildebeeste, or brindled gnus. Travel over these great plains and  through these leisurely low hills is a good deal like coastwise  sailing--the same apparently unattainable landmarks which, nevertheless,  are at last passed and left astern by the same sure but insensible  progress. Thus we drew up on apparently continuous hills, found wide  gaps between them, crossed them, and turned to the left along the other  side of the promontory. About five o'clock we came to the Hills'.    The ostrich farm is situated on the very top of a conical rise that  sticks up like an island close inshore to the semicircle of mountains in  which end the vast plains of Kapiti. Thus the Hills have at their backs  and sides these solid ramparts and face westward the immensities of  space. For Kapiti goes on over the edge of the world to unknown,  unguessed regions, rolling and troubled like a sea. And from that  unknown, on very still days, the snowy peak of Kilimanjaro peers out,  sketched as faintly against the sky as a soap bubble wafted upward and  about to disappear. Here and there on the plains kopjes stand like  islands, their stone tops looking as though thrust through the smooth  prairie surface from beneath. To them meandered long, narrow ravines  full of low brush, like thin, wavering streaks of gray. On these  kopjes--each of which had its name--and in these ravines we were to hunt  lions.    We began the ascent of the cone on which dwelt our hosts. It was one of  those hills that seem in no part steep, and yet which finally succeed in  raising one to a considerable height. We passed two ostrich herds in  charge of savages, rode through a scattered native village, and so came  to the farm itself, situated on the very summit.    The house consisted of three large circular huts, thatched neatly with  papyrus stalks, and with conical roofs. These were arranged as a  triangle, just touching each other; and the space between had been  roofed over to form a veranda. We were ushered into one of these  circular rooms. It was spacious and contained two"]]]
