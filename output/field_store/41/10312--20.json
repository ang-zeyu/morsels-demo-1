Sometimes the devil distorts Christ to my vision. But thanks be to God,  who keeps us in His Word, in faith, and in prayer.    The spiritual witchery of the devil creates in the heart a wrong idea  of Christ. Those who share the opinion that a person is justified by the  works of the Law, are simply bewitched. Their belief goes against faith  and Christ.      VERSE 1. That ye should not obey the truth.    Paul incriminates the Galatians in worse failure. \"You are so bewitched  that you no longer obey the truth. I fear many of you have strayed so  far that you will never return to the truth.\"    The apostasy of the Galatians is a fine indorsement of the Law, all  right. You may preach the Law ever so fervently; if the preaching of the  Gospel does not accompany it, the Law will never produce true conversion  and heartfelt repentance. We do not mean to say that the preaching of  the Law is without value, but it only serves to bring home to us the  wrath of God. The Law bows a person down. It takes the Gospel and the  preaching of faith in Christ to raise and save a person.        VERSE 1. Before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth.    Paul's increasing severity becomes apparent as he reminds the Galatians  that they disobeyed the truth in defiance of the vivid description he  had given them of Christ. So vividly had he described Christ to them  that they could almost see and handle Him. As if Paul were to say: \"No  artist with all his colors could have pictured Christ to you as vividly  as I have pictured Him to you by my preaching. Yet you permitted  yourselves to be seduced to the extent that you disobeyed the truth of  Christ.\"        VERSE 1. Crucified among you.    \"You have not only rejected the grace of God, you have shamefully  crucified Christ among you.\" Paul employs the same phraseology in  Hebrews 6:6: \"Seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh,  and put him to an open shame.\"    It should make any person afraid to hear Paul say that those who seek  to be justified by the Law, not only deny Christ, but also crucify Him  anew. If those who seek to be justified by the Law and its works are  crucifiers of Christ, what are they, I like to know, who seek salvation  by the filthy rags of their own work-righteousness?    Can there be anything more horrible than the papacy, an alliance of  people who crucify Christ in themselves, in the Church, and in the  hearts of the believers?    Of all the diseased and vicious doctrines of the papacy the worst is  this: \"If you want to serve God you must earn your own remission of sins  and everlasting life, and in addition help others to obtain salvation by  giving them the benefit of your extra work-holiness.\" Monks, friars, and  all the rest of them brag that besides the ordinary requirements common  to all Christians, they do the works of supererogation, i.e., the  performance of more than is required. This is certainly a fiendish  illusion.    No wonder Paul employs such sharp language in his effort to recall the  Galatians from the doctrine of the false apostles. He says to them:  \"Don't you realize what you have done? You have crucified Christ anew  because you seek salvation by the Law.\"    True, Christ can no longer be crucified in person, but He is crucified  in us when we reject grace, faith, free remission of sins and endeavor  to be justified by our own works, or by the works of the Law.    The Apostle is incensed at the presumptuousness of any person who thinks  he can perform the Law of God to his own salvation. He charges that  person with the atrocity of crucifying anew the Son of God.        VERSE 2. This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the    works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?    There is a touch of irony in these words of the Apostle. \"Come on now,  my smart Galatians, you who all of a sudden have become doctors, while  I seem to be your pupil: Received ye the Holy Ghost by the works of  the Law, or by the preaching of the Gospel?\" This question gave them  something to think about, because their own experience contradicted  them.    \"You cannot say that you received the Holy Spirit by the Law. As long as  you were servants of the Law, you never received the Holy Ghost. Nobody  ever heard of the Holy Ghost being given to anybody, be he doctor or  dunce, as a result of the preaching of the Law. In your own case, you  have not only learned the Law by heart, you have labored with all your  might to perform it. You most of all should have received the Holy Ghost  by the Law, if that were possible. You cannot show me that this ever  happened. But as soon as the Gospel came your way, you received the Holy  Ghost by the simple hearing of faith, before you ever had a chance to do  a single good deed.\" Luke verifies this statement of Paul in the Book  of Acts: \"While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all  them which heard the word.\" (Acts 10:44.) \"And as I began to speak, the  Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.\" (Acts 11:15.)    Try to appreciate the force of Paul's argument which is so often  repeated in the Book of Acts. That Book was written for the express  purpose of verifying Paul's assertion, that the Holy Ghost comes upon  men, not in response to the preaching of the Law, but in response to  the preaching of the Gospel. When Peter preached Christ at the first  Pentecost, the Holy Ghost fell upon the hearers, \"and the same day there  were added unto them about three thousand souls.\" Cornelius received the  Holy Ghost while Peter was speaking of Christ. \"The Holy Ghost fell on  all of them which heard the word.\" These are actual experiences that  cannot very well be denied. When Paul and Barnabas returned to Jerusalem  and reported what they had been able to accomplish among the Gentiles,  the whole Church was astonished, particularly when it heard that the  uncircumcised Gentiles had received the Holy Ghost by the preaching of  faith in Christ.    Now as God gave the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles without the Law by the  simple preaching of the Gospel, so He gave the Holy Ghost also to the  Jews, without the Law, through faith alone. If the righteousness of the  Law were necessary unto salvation, the Holy Ghost would never have come  to the Gentiles, because they did not bother about the Law. Hence the  Law does not justify, but faith in Christ justifies.    How was it with Cornelius? Cornelius and his friends whom he had invited  over to his house, do nothing but sit and listen. Peter is doing the  talking. They just sit and do nothing. The Law is far removed from their  thoughts. They burn no sacrifices. They are not at all interested in  circumcision. All they do is to sit and listen to Peter. Suddenly the  Holy Ghost enters their hearts. His presence is unmistakable, \"for they  spoke with tongues and magnified God.\"    Right here we have one more difference between the Law and the Gospel.  The Law does not bring on the Holy Ghost. The Gospel, however, brings  on the gift of the Holy Ghost, because it is the nature of the Gospel to  convey good gifts. The Law and the Gospel are contrary ideas. They have  contrary functions and purposes. To endow the Law with any capacity to  produce righteousness is to plagiarize the Gospel. The Gospel brings  donations. It pleads for open hands to take what is being offered. The  Law has nothing to give. It demands, and its demands are impossible.    Our opponents come back at us with Cornelius. Cornelius, they point out,  was \"a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which  gave much alms to the people and prayed God always.\" Because of these  qualifications, he merited the forgiveness of sins, and the gift of the  Holy Ghost. So reason our opponents.      I answer: Cornelius was a Gentile. You cannot deny it. As a Gentile he    was uncircumcised. As a Gentile he did not observe the Law. He never    gave the Law any thought. For all that, he was justified and received    the Holy Ghost. How can the Law avail anything unto righteousness?  Our opponents are not satisfied. They reply: \"Granted that Cornelius was  a Gentile and did not receive the Holy Ghost by the Law, yet the text  plainly states that he was a devout man who feared God, gave alms, and  prayed. Don't you think he deserved the gift of the Holy Ghost?\"      I answer: Cornelius had the faith of the fathers who were saved by    faith in the Christ to come. If Cornelius had died before Christ, he    would have been saved because he believed in the Christ to come. But    because the Messiah had already come, Cornelius had to be apprized of    the fact. Since Christ has come we cannot be saved by faith in the    Christ to come, but we must believe that he has come. The object of    Peter's visit was to acquaint Cornelius with the fact that Christ was    no longer to be looked for, because He is here.    As to the contention of our opponents that Cornelius deserved grace and  the gift of the Holy Ghost, because he was devout and just, we say  that these attributes are the characteristics of a spiritual person who  already has faith in Christ, and not the characteristics of a Gentile  or of natural man. Luke first praises Cornelius for being a devout and  God-fearing man, and then Luke mentions the good works, the alms and  prayers of Cornelius. Our opponents ignore the sequence of Luke's words.  They pounce on this one sentence, \"which gave much alms to the people,\"  because it serves their assertion that merit precedes grace. The fact  is that Cornelius gave alms and prayed to God because he had faith.  And because of his faith in the Christ to come, Peter was delegated to  preach unto Cornelius faith in the Christ who had already come. This  argument is convincing enough. Cornelius was justified without the Law,  therefore the Law cannot justify.    Take the case of Naaman, the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15535"],[0,"Violin Mastery: Talks with Master Violinists and Teachers (#17)"],[1,"exists. This is far more difficult and complicated than one  might at first believe. For example, let us take one of the simplest  violin chords,\" said Mr. Betti [and he rapidly set it down in pencil].                       [Illustration: Musical Notation]    \"Now let us begin by fixing the B so that it is perfectly in tune with  the E, then _without at all changing_ the B, take the interval D-B. You  will see that the sixth will not be in tune. Repeat the experiment,  inverting the notes: the result will still be the same. Try it yourself  some time,\" added Mr. Betti with a smile, \"and you will see. What is the  reason? It is because the middle B has not been adjusted, tempered! Give  the same notes to the first and second violins and the viola and you  will have the same result. Then, when the 'cello is added, the problem  is still more complicated, owing to the difference in _timbre_ and  register. Yet it is a problem which can be solved, and is solved in  practically everything we play.    \"Another difficulty, especially in the case of some of the _very daring_  chords encountered in modern compositions, is the matter of balance  between the individual notes. There are chords which only _sound well_  if certain notes are thrown into relief; and others only if played very  softly (almost as though they were overtones). To overcome such  difficulties means a great deal of work, real musical instinct and,  above all, great familiarity with the composer's harmonic processes. Yet  with time and patience the true balance of tone can be obtained.                                       TEMPO    \"All four individual players must be able to _feel_ the tempo they are  playing in the same way. I believe it was Mahler who once gave out a  beat very distinctly--one, two, three--told his orchestra players to  count the beat silently for twenty measures and then stop. As each  _felt_ the beat differently from the other, every one of them stopped at  a different time. So _tempo_, just like intonation, must be 'tempered'  by the four quartet players in order to secure perfect rhythmic  inflection.                                     DYNAMICS    \"Modern composers have wonderfully improved dynamic expression. Every  little shade of meaning they make clear with great distinctness. The  older composers, and occasionally a modern like Emanuel Moor, do not use  expression marks. Moor says, 'If the performers really have something to  put into my work the signs are not needed.' Yet this has its  disadvantages. I once had an entirely unmarked Sonata by Sammartini. As  most first movements in the sonatas of that composer are _allegros_ I  tried the beginning several times as an _allegro_, but it sounded  radically wrong. Then, at last, it occurred to me to try it as a _largo_  and, behold, it was beautiful!                                  INTERPRETATION    \"If the leader of the quartet has lived himself into and mastered a  composition, together with his associates, the result is sure. I must  live in the music I play just as an actor must live the character he  represents. All higher interpretation depends on solving technical  problems in a way which is not narrowly mechanical. And while the  _ensemble_ spirit must be preserved, the freedom of the individual  should not be too much restrained. Once the style and manner of a modern  composer are familiar, it is easier to present his works: when we first  played the Reger quartet here some twenty years ago, we found pages  which at first we could not at all understand. If one has fathomed  Debussy, it is easier to play Milhaud, Roger-Ducasse, Samazeuil--for the  music of the modern French school has much in common. One great cultural  value the professional quartet has for the musical community is the fact  that it gives a large circle a measure of acquaintance with the mode of  thought and style of composers whose symphonic and larger works are  often an unknown quantity. This applies to Debussy, Reger, the modern  Russians, Bloch and others. When we played the Stravinsky pieces here,  for instance, his _Petrouschka_ and _Firebird_ had not yet been heard.                                   SOME IDEALS    \"We try, as an organization, to be absolutely catholic in taste. Nor do  we neglect the older music, because we play so much of the new. This  year we are devoting special attention to the American composers.  Formerly the Kneisels took care of them, and now we feel that we should  assume this legacy. We have already played Daniel Gregory Mason's fine  _Intermezzo_, and the other American numbers we have played include  David Stanley Smith's _Second Quartet_, and movements from quartets by  Victor Kolar and Samuel Gardner. We are also going to revive Charles  Martin Loeffler's _Rhapsodies_ for viola, oboe and piano.    \"I have been for some time making a collection of sonatas _a tre_, two  violins and 'cello--delightful old things by Sammartini, Leclair, the  Englishman Boyce, Friedemann Bach and others. This is material from  which the amateur could derive real enjoyment and profit. The Leclair  sonata in D minor we have played some three hundred times; and its slow  movement is one of the most beautiful _largos_ I know of in all chamber  music. The same thing could be done in the way of transcription for  chamber music which Kreisler has already done so charmingly for the solo  violin. And I would dearly love to do it! There are certain 'primitives'  of the quartet--Johann Christian Bach, Gossec, Telemann, Michel  Haydn--who have written music full of the rarest melodic charm and  freshness. I have much excellent material laid by, but as you know,\"  concluded Mr. Betti with a sigh, \"one has so little time for anything in  America.\"                                             XII                                      HANS LETZ                              THE TECHNIC OF BOWING      Hans Letz, the gifted Alsatian violinist, is well fitted to talk on any  phase of his Art. A pupil of Joachim (he came to this country in 1908),  he was for three years concertmaster of the Thomas orchestra, appearing  as a solo artist in most of our large cities, and was not only one of  the Kneisels (he joined that organization in 1912), but the leader of a  quartet of his own. As a teacher, too, he is active in giving others an  opportunity to apply the lessons of his own experience.                                   VIOLIN MASTERY    When asked for his definition of the term, Mr. Letz said: \"There can be  no such thing as an _absolute_ mastery of the violin. Mastery is a  relative term. The artist is first of all more or less dependent on  circumstances which he cannot control--his mood, the weather, strings,  a thousand and one incidentals. And then, the nearer he gets to his  ideal, the more apt his ideal is to escape him. Yet, discounting all  objections, I should say that a master should be able to express  perfectly the composer's idea, reflected by his own sensitive soul.                              THE KEY TO INTERPRETATION    \"The bow is the key to this mastery in expression, in interpretation: in  a lesser degree the left hand. The average pupil does not realize this  but believes that mere finger facility is the whole gist of technic. Yet  the richest color, the most delicate _nuance_, is mainly a matter of  bowing. In the left hand, of course, the _vibrato_ gives a certain  amount of color effect, the intense, dramatic tone quality of the rapid  _vibrato_ is comparable on the violin to the _tremulando_ of the singer.  At the same time the _vibrato_ used to excess is quite as bad as an  excessive _tremulando_ in the voice. But control of the bow is the key  to the gates of the great field of declamation, it is the means of  articulation and accent, it gives character, comprising the entire scale  of the emotions. In fact, declamation with the violin bow is very much  like declamation in dramatic art. And the attack of the bow on the  string should be as incisive as the utterance of the first accented  syllable of a spoken word. The bow is emphatically the means of  expression, but only the advanced pupil can develop its finer, more  delicate expressional possibilities.                               THE TECHNIC OF BOWING    \"Genius does many things by instinct. And it sometimes happens that very  great performers, trying to explain some technical function, do not know  how to make their meaning clear. With regard to bowing, I remember that  Joachim (a master colorist with the bow) used to tell his students to  play largely with the wrist. What he really meant was with an  elbow-joint movement, that is, moving the bow, which should always be  connected with a movement of the forearm by means of the elbow-joint.  The ideal bow stroke results from keeping the joints of the right arm  loose, and at the same time firm enough to control each motion made. A  difficult thing for the student is to learn to draw the bow across the  strings _at a right angle_, the only way to produce a good tone. I find  it helps my pupils to tell them not to think of the position of the  bow-arm while drawing the bow across the strings, but merely to follow  with the tips of the fingers of the right hand an imaginary line running  at a right angle across the strings. The whole bow then moves as it  should, and the arm motions unconsciously adjust themselves.                                 RHYTHM AND COLOR    \"Rhythm is the foundation of all music--not rhythm in its metronomic  sense, but in the broader sense of proportion. I lay the greatest stress  on the development of rhythmic sensibility in the student. Rhythm gives  life to every musical phrase.\" Mr. Letz had a Brahms' quartet open on  his music stand. Playing the following passage, he said:                       [Illustration: Musical Notation]    \"In order to give this phrase its proper rhythmic value, to express it  clearly, plastically, there must be "]]]
