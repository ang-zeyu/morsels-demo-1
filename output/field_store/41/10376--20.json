Look upon them, I entreat Thee, with the eyes of Thy  mercy. Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate. Do with them  as beseemeth Thy glory, and Thy majesty, and Thy greatness, and Thy  bounteousness and Thy grace. Deal not with them according to the  limitations imposed upon them, or the manifold vicissitudes of their  earthly life.    Thou knowest, O my Lord, that I am but one of Thy servants. I have tasted  of the sweetness of Thy speech, and acknowledged Thy unity and Thy  singleness, and set my face towards the Source of Thy most excellent names  and the Day-Spring of Thy transcendent attributes, and wished to be  enabled by Thee to immerse myself beneath the ocean of Thy oneness and to  be submerged by the mighty waters of Thy unity.    Assist me, by Thy strengthening grace, O my Lord, to do what Thou didst  will, and withhold not from me the things Thou dost possess. So enravish  me with the wonders of Thine utterances that the noise and distraction of  this world may be powerless to deter me from turning unto Thee, and may  fail to shake my constancy in Thy Cause, or to distract my gaze from the  horizon of Thy grace. Aid me, then, O my God, to do what pleaseth Thee,  and to carry out Thy will. Write down for me, moreover, the good of this  world and of the world which is to come, and ordain for me a seat of truth  in Thy presence. Potent art Thou to do what Thou willest, and to rule as  Thou pleasest. No God is there but Thee, the Inaccessible, the  All-Glorious, the Most Great.    All-praise to Thee, O Lord of the worlds and the Object of the adoration  of the entire creation!            LXX: \"FADED NOW IS ALL THAT ERSTWHILE FLOURISHED IN THE...\"      Faded now is all that erstwhile flourished in the Paradise of Thy  transcendent oneness, O my God! Where are the rain-giving clouds of Thy  mercy? Shorn are the branches of the Tree of Thy unity of the vesture of  Thy majesty and wisdom; where is the spring-time of Thy gifts and  bounties? Motionless lies the Ark of Thy Cause on the sea of Thy creation;  where are the winds of Thy grace and favors? Encompassed on every side is  Thy Lamp by the tempests of discord blowing from every land; where is the  globe of Thy graciousness and protection?    Thou seest, O my God, how the eyes of these poor creatures are bent upon  the horizon of Thy riches, how the hearts of these helpless ones are set  in the direction of Thy might. I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the sole  Desire of them that have recognized Thee, and the Object of the adoration  of the entire creation, not to suffer them, now that Thou hast attracted  them by Thy most exalted Word, to be far removed from the Tabernacle which  Thou hast reared up by Thy name, the All-Glorious.    They are sore pressed with cares, O my Lord, and are encompassed about by  the wicked. Send down, therefore, from the heaven of Thy behest Thine  invisible hosts, that, holding aloft the ensigns of Thy victory, they may  help them in Thy land, and may shield them against Thine adversaries.    I entreat Thee, O my God, by Thy name through which the clouds have rained  down their rain, and the streams have flowed, and the fire of Thy love  hath been kindled throughout Thy dominion, to assist Thy servant who hath  turned towards Thee, and hath spoken forth Thy praise, and determined to  help Thee. Fortify, then, his heart, O my God, in Thy love and in Thy  Faith. Better is this for him than all that hath been created on Thine  earth, for the world and whatsoever is therein must perish, and what  pertaineth unto Thee must endure as long as Thy most excellent names  endure. By Thy Glory! Were the world to last as long as Thine own kingdom  will last, to set their affections upon it would still be unseemly for  such as have quaffed, from the hands of Thy mercy, the wine of Thy  presence; how much more when they recognize its fleetingness and are  persuaded of its transience. The chances that overtake it, and the changes  to which all things pertaining unto it are continually subjected, attest  its impermanence.    Whosoever hath recognized Thee will turn to none save Thee, and will seek  from Thee naught else except Thyself. Thou art the sole Desire of the  heart of him whose thoughts are fixed on Thee, and the highest Aspiration  of whosoever is wholly devoted unto Thee.    No God is there beside Thee, the Almighty, the Help in Peril, the  All-Glorious, the Most Powerful.            LXXI: \"MAGNIFIED BE THY NAME, O MY GOD, FOR THAT THOU...\"      Magnified be Thy name, O my God, for that Thou hast manifested the Day  which is the King of Days, the Day which Thou didst announce unto Thy  chosen Ones and Thy Prophets in Thy most excellent Tablets, the Day  whereon Thou didst shed the splendor of the glory of all Thy names upon  all created things. Great is his blessedness whosoever hath set himself  towards Thee, and entered Thy presence, and caught the accents of Thy  voice.    I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by the name of Him round Whom circleth in  adoration the kingdom of Thy names, that Thou wilt graciously assist them  that are dear to Thee to glorify Thy word among Thy servants, and to shed  abroad Thy praise amidst Thy creatures, so that the ecstasies of Thy  revelation may fill the souls of all the dwellers of Thine earth.    Since Thou hast guided them, O my Lord, unto the living waters of Thy  grace, grant, by Thy bounty, that they may not be kept back from Thee; and  since Thou hast summoned them to the habitation of Thy throne, drive them  not out from Thy presence, through Thy loving-kindness. Send down upon  them what shall wholly detach them from aught else except Thee, and make  them able to soar in the atmosphere of Thy nearness, in such wise that  neither the ascendancy of the oppressor nor the suggestions of them that  have disbelieved in Thy most august and most mighty Self shall be capable  of keeping them back from Thee.            LXXII: \"LAUDED BE THY NAME, O THOU IN WHOSE HANDS IS...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O Thou in Whose hands is the kingdom of all names, and  in the grasp of Whose might are all that are in heaven and all that are on  earth! I entreat Thee, by Him Who is Thy Most Effulgent Name Whom Thou  hast made a target for the darts of Thy decree in Thy path, O Thou the  King of eternity, to rend asunder the veils that have shut off Thy  creatures from the horizon of Thy glory, that haply they may turn their  faces in the direction of Thy mercy, and draw nigh unto the Day-Spring of  Thy loving-kindness.    Leave not Thy servants to themselves, O my Lord! Draw them through the  influence of Thine utterances unto the Dawning-Place of Thine inspiration,  and to the Fountain of Thy Revelation, and to the Treasury of Thy wisdom.  Thou art He to Whose strength and power all things have testified, Whose  Purpose nothing whatsoever of all that hath been created in Thy heaven and  on Thy earth hath been able to frustrate.    Render, then, victorious, O my God, Thy servants who have set their faces  towards Thee, and directed their steps to the seat of Thy grace. Send  down, then, upon them what will keep them safe from the danger of turning  to any one but Thee, and from fixing their eyes upon aught else except  Thyself.    Potent art Thou to do what Thou willest, and to rule as Thou pleasest.  There is no God but Thee, the God of glory and wisdom.            LXXIII: \"GLORIFIED ART THOU, O LORD MY GOD! I BESEECH...\"      Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Name, the  Restrainer, to withhold from us the maleficence of Thine adversaries who  have disbelieved in Thy testimony, and caviled at Thy beauty. Overpower by  Thy Name, the All-Subduing, such as have wronged Thy Previous  Manifestation Who hath now appeared invested with Thy title, the  All-Glorious. Lay hold, by Thy name, the Chastiser, on them that have  treated Thy Cause with scorn, have jested at Thy most mighty utterances,  and were hindered from attaining this most exalted station. Enable Thy  loved ones, by Thy Name, the Victorious, to prevail against Thine enemies  and the infidels among Thy creatures. Rend asunder, by Thy Name, the  Cleaver, the veil that hideth the doings of them that have besmirched  Thine honor and undermined Thy Faith among Thy people. Bind, by Thy Name,  the Restorer, the broken hearts of them that love Thee, and graciously  bless them in their affairs. Teach them, by Thy Name, the All-Knowing, the  wonders of Thy wisdom, that they may cleave steadfastly to Thy Faith and  walk in the ways of Thy pleasure. Keep them safe, by Thy Name, the  Withholder, from the tyranny of the oppressor and the wickedness of the  evil-doers and the malice of the stirrers of mischief. Shield them, by Thy  Name, the Preserver, within the stronghold of Thy might and power, that  haply they may be protected from the darts of doubt that are hurled by  such as have rebelled against Thee. Sanctify for Thy servants, by Thy Name  which Thou hast blessed above all other names, which Thou hast singled out  for Thy favor, and by which Thou didst reveal Thy beauty, these days of  which the Pen of Thy decree hath distinctly written, and which, according  to Thy will and wisdom, have been preordained in Thine irrevocable Tablet.  Subject to Thy rule, by Thy Name, the Conqueror, the people of Thy realm,  that all may turn towards Thy face and forsake their all for love of Thee  and for the sake of Thy pleasure.    Abase Thou, O my Lord, Thine enemies, and lay hold on them with Thy power  and might, and let them be stricken by the blast of Thy wrath. Make them  taste, O my God, of Thine awful majesty and vengeance, for they have  repudiated the truth of the One in Whom they had believed, Who came unto  them with Thy signs and Thy clear tokens and the evidences of Thy power  and the manifold revelations of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16996"],[0,"Two Old Faiths (#17)"],[1,"into the family or to penetrate the  domestic soil where alone they could take root, grow into the national  mind, live, and be perpetuated. Under such conditions the seeds of  civilization refuse to germinate. No real growth is possible in free and  useful institutions, nor any permanent and healthy force in those great  movements which elsewhere tend to uplift the masses and elevate mankind.  There may, it is true, be some advance, from time to time, in science  and in material prosperity; but the social groundwork for the same is  wanting, and the people surely relapse into the semi-barbarism forced  upon them by an ordinance which is opposed to the best instincts of  humanity. Sustained progress becomes impossible. Such is the outcome of  an attempt to improve upon nature and banish woman, the help-meet of  man, from the position assigned by God to her in the world.    [Sidenote: Yet the veil necessary under existing circumstances.]  At the same time I am not prepared to say that in view of the laxity of  the conjugal relations inherent in the institutions of Islam some such  social check as that of the veil (apart from the power to confine and  castigate) is not needed for the repression of license and the  maintenance of outward decency. There is too much reason to apprehend  that free social intercourse might otherwise be dangerous to morality  under the code of Mohammed, and with the example before men and women of  the early worthies of Islam. So long as the sentiments and habits of the  Moslem world remain as they are some remedial or preventive measure of  the kind seems indispensable. But the peculiarity of the Mussulman  polity, as we have seen, is such that the sexual laws and institutions  which call for restrictions of the kind as founded on the Koran are  incapable of change; they must co-exist with the faith itself, and last  while it lasts. So long, then, as this polity prevails the depression of  woman, as well as her exclusion from the social circle, must injure the  health and vitality of the body politic, impair its purity and grace,  paralyze vigor, retard progress in the direction of freedom,  philanthropy, and moral elevation, and generally perpetuate the normal  state of Mohammedan peoples, as one of semi-barbarism.    To recapitulate, we have seen:    [Sidenote: Recapitulation.]  _First._ That Islam was propagated mainly by the sword. With the tide of  conquest the religion went forward; where conquest was arrested made no  advance beyond; and at the withdrawal of the Moslem arms the faith also  commonly retired.    _Second._ The inducements, whether material or spiritual, to embrace  Islam have proved insufficient of themselves (speaking broadly) to  spread the faith, in the absence of the sword, and without the influence  of the political or secular arm.    _Third._ The ordinances of Islam, those especially having respect to the  female sex, have induced an inherent weakness, which depresses the  social system and retards its progress.    [Sidenote: Contrast with Christianity.]  If the reader should have followed me in the argument by which these  conclusions have been reached the contrast with the Christian faith has  no doubt been suggesting itself at each successive step.    [Sidenote: Christianity not propagated by force.]  Christianity, as Al Kindy has so forcibly put it, gained a firm footing  in the world without the sword, and without any aid whatever from the  secular arm. So far from having the countenance of the State it  triumphed in spite of opposition, persecution, and discouragement. \"My  kingdom,\" said Jesus, \"is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this  world, then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to  the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence.... For this end came I  into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one that  is of the truth, heareth my voice.\"[78]    [Sidenote: Nor by worldly inducements.]  The religion itself, in its early days, offered no worldly attractions  or indulgences. It was not, like Islam, an \"easy way.\" Whether in  withdrawal from social observances deeply tainted with idolatry, the  refusal to participate in sacrificial ceremonies insisted on by the  rulers, or in the renunciation of indulgences inconsistent with a  saintly life, the Christian profession required self-denial at every  step.    [Sidenote: Adaptive principles and plastic faculty of Christianity.]  But otherwise the teaching of Christianity nowhere interfered with the  civil institutions of the countries into which it penetrated or with any  social customs or practices that were not in themselves immoral or  idolatrous. It did not, indeed, neglect to guide the Christian life. But  it did so by the enunciation of principles and rules of wide and  far-reaching application. These, no less than the injunctions of the  Koran, served amply for the exigencies of the day. But they have done a  vast deal more. They have proved themselves capable of adaptation to the  most advanced stages of social development and intellectual elevation.  And, what is infinitely more, it may be claimed for the lessons embodied  in the Gospel that they have been themselves promotive, if indeed they  have not been the immediate cause, of all the most important reforms and  philanthropies that now prevail in Christendom. The principles thus laid  down contained germs endowed with the power of life and growth which,  expanding and flourishing, slowly it may be, but surely, have at the  last borne the fruits we see.    [Sidenote: Examples: slavery.  Relations between the sexes.]  Take, for example, the institution of slavery. It prevailed in the Roman  Empire at the introduction of Christianity, as it did in Arabia at the  rise of Islam. In the Moslem code, as we have seen, the practice has  been perpetuated. Slavery must be held permissible so long as the Koran  is taken to be the rule of faith. The divine sanction thus impressed  upon the institution, and the closeness with which by law and custom it  intermingles with social and domestic life, make it impossible for any  Mohammedan people to impugn slavery as contrary to sound morality or for  any body of loyal believers to advocate its abolition upon the ground  of principle. There are, moreover, so many privileges and gratifications  accruing to the higher classes from its maintenance that (excepting  under the strong pressure of European diplomacy) no sincere and hearty  effort can be expected from the Moslem race in the suppression of the  inhuman traffic, the horrors of which, as pursued by Moslem  slave-traders, their Prophet would have been the first to denounce. Look  now at the wisdom with which the Gospel treats the institution. It is  nowhere in so many words proscribed, for that would, under the  circumstances, have led to the abnegation of relative duties and the  disruption of society. It is accepted as a prevailing institution  recognized by the civil powers. However desirable freedom might be,  slavery was not inconsistent with the Christian profession: \"Art thou  called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made  free, use it rather.\"[e] The duty of obedience to his master is enjoined  upon the slave, and the duty of mildness and urbanity toward his slave  is enjoined upon the master. But with all this was laid the seed which  grew into emancipation. \"_Our Father_,\" gave the key-note of freedom.  \"Ye are _all_ the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.\" \"There is  neither bond nor free, ... for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\"[f] \"He that  is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman.\"[g] The  converted slave is to be received \"not now as a servant, but above a  servant, a brother beloved.\"[h] The seed has borne its proper harvest. Late  in time, no doubt, but by a sure and certain development, the grand  truth of the equality of the human race, and the right of every man and  woman to freedom of thought and (within reasonable limit of law) to  freedom of action, has triumphed; and it has triumphed through the  Spirit and the precepts inculcated by the Gospel eighteen hundred years  ago. Nor is it otherwise with the relations established between the  sexes. Polygamy, divorce, and concubinage with bondmaid's have been  perpetuated, as we have seen, by Islam for all time; and the ordinances  connected therewith have given rise, in the laborious task of defining  the conditions and limits of what is lawful, to a mass of prurient  casuistry defiling the books of Mohammedan law. Contrast with this our  Saviour's words, \"_He which made them at the beginning made them male  and female.... What therefore God hath joined together let not man put  asunder_.\"[i] From which simple utterance have resulted monogamy and (in  the absence of adultery) the indissolubility of the marriage bond. While  in respect of conjugal duties we have such large, but sufficiently  intelligible, commands as \"to render due benevolence,\"[j] whereby, while  the obligations of the marriage state are maintained, Christianity is  saved from the impurities which, in expounding the ordinances of  Mohammed, surround the sexual ethics of Islam, and cast so foul a stain  upon its literature.    [Sidenote: Elevation of woman.]  Take, again, the place of woman in the world. We need no injunction of  the veil or the harem. As the temples of the Holy Ghost, the body is to  be kept undefiled, and every one is \"to possess his vessel in  sanctification and honor.\"[k] Men are to treat \"the elder women as mothers;  the younger as sisters, with all purity.\"[l] Women are to \"adorn themselves  in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety.\"[m] These, and such  like maxims embrace the whole moral fitness of the several relations and  duties which they define. They are adapted for all ages of time and for  all conditions of men. They are capable of being taken by every  individual for"]]]
