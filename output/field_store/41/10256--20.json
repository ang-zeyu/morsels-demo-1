Cook about 5       minutes, take it off and brown it with a salamander.    There are two schools of salamandering among turophiles. One holds  that it toughens the cheese and makes it less digestible; the other  that it's simply swell. Some of the latter addicts have special  cheese-branding irons made with their monograms, to identify their  creations, whether they be burned on the skins of Welsh Rabbits or  Frying Pan Ramekins. Salamandering with an iron that has a gay,  carnivalesque design can make a sort of harlequin Ramekin.       Casserole Ramekin         Here is the Americanization of a French original: In a deep       casserole lay alternate slices of white bread and Swiss cheese,       with the cheese slices a bit bigger all around. Beat 2 eggs with       2 cups of milk, season with salt and--of all things--nutmeg!       Proceed to bake like individual Ramekins.          [Illustration]    _Chapter Eight_    Pizzas, Blintzes, Pastes, Cheese Cakes, etc.      No matter how big or hungry your family, you can always appease them  with pizza.       Pizza--The Tomato Pie of Sicily    DOUGH    1 package yeast, dissolved in warm water  2 cups sifted flour  1 teaspoon salt  2 tablespoons olive oil         Make dough of this. Knead 12 to 20 minutes. Pat into a ball,       cover it tight and let stand 3 hours in warm place until twice       the size.    TOMATO PASTE    3 tablespoons olive oil  2 large onions, sliced thin  1 can Italian tomato paste  8 to 10 anchovy filets, cut small  1/2 teaspoon oregano  Salt  Crushed chili pepper  2-1/2 cups water         In the oil fry onion tender but not too brown, stir in tomato       paste and keep stirring 3 or 4 minutes. Season, pour water over       and simmer slowly 25 to 30 minutes. Add anchovies when sauce is       done.    CHEESE    1/2 cup grated Italian, Parmesan, Romano or Pecorino, depending  on your pocketbook         Procure a low, wide and handsome tin pizza pan, or reasonable       substitute, and grease well before spreading the well-raised       dough 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Poke your finger tips haphazardly       into the dough to make marks that will catch the sauce when you       pour it on generously. Shake on Parmesan or Parmesan-type cheese       and bake in hot oven 1/2 hour, then 1/4 hour more at lower heat       until the pizza is golden-brown. Cut in wedges like any other pie       and serve.    The proper pans come all tin and a yard wide, down to regular  apple-pie size, but twelve-inch pans are the most popular.       Miniature Pizzas         Miniature pizzas are split English muffins rubbed with garlic or       onion and brushed with olive oil. Cover with tomato sauce and a       slice of Mozzarella cheese, anchovy, oregano and grated Parmesan,       and heat 8 minutes.       Italian-Swiss Scallopini    1 pound paper-thin veal cutlets  1/2 cup flour  1/2 cup grated Swiss and Parmesan, mixed  1 egg yolk, lightly beaten with water  Butter  Salt  Paprika         Moisten veal with egg and roll in flour mixed with cheese,       quickly brown, lower flame and cook 4 to 5 minutes till tender.       Dust with paprika and salt.       Neapolitan Baked Lasagne, or Stuffed Noodles    1 pound lasagne, or other wide noodles  1-1/2 cups cooked thick tomato sauce with meat  1/2 pound Ricotta or cottage cheese  1 pound Mozzarella or American Cheddar  1/4 pound grated Parmesan, Romano or Pecorino  Salt  Pepper, preferably crushed red pods  A shaker filled with grated Parmesan, or reasonable substitute         Cook wide or broad noodles 15 to 20 minutes in rapidly boiling       salted water until tender, but not soft, and drain. Pour 1/2 cup       of tomato sauce in baking dish or pan, cover with about 1/2 of       the noodles, sprinkle with grated Parmesan, a layer of sauce, a       layer of Mozzarella and dabs of Ricotta. Continue in this       fashion, alternating layers and seasoning each, ending with a       final spread of sauce, Parmesan and red pepper. Bake firm in       moderate oven, about 15 minutes, and served in wedges like pizza,       with canisters of grated Parmesan, crushed red pepper pods and       more of the sauce to taste.       Little Hats, Cappelletti         Freshly made and still moist Cappelletti, little hats, contrived       out of tasty paste, may be had in any Little Italy macaroni shop.       These may be stuffed sensationally in four different flavors       with only two cheeses.         Brown slices of chicken and ham separately, in butter. Mince each       very fine and divide in half, to make four mixtures in equal       amounts. Season these with salt, pepper and nutmeg and a binding       of 2 parts egg yolk to I part egg white.         With these meat mixtures you can make four different-flavored       fillings:         Ham and Mozzarella Chicken and Mozzarella Ham and Ricotta Chicken       and Ricotta         Fill the little hats alternately, so you'll have the same number       of each different kind. Pinch edges tight together to keep the       stuffings in while boiling fast for 5 minutes in chicken broth       (or salted water, if you must).         Since these Cappelletti are only a pleasing form and shape of       ravioli, they are served in the same way on hot plates, with       plain tomato sauce and Parmesan or reasonable substitute. If we       count this final seasoning as an ingredient, this makes three       cheeses, so that each of half a dozen taste buds can be getting       individual sensations without letting the others know what it's       doing.       Dauphiny Ravioli         This French variant of the famous Italian pockets of pastry       follows the Cappelletti pattern, with any fresh goat cheese and       Gruyere melted with butter and minced parsley and boiled in       chicken broth.       Italian Fritters    1/4 cup flour  2 tablespoons sugar  1/4 pound fresh Ricotta  2 eggs, beaten  1/2 cup shredded Mozzarella  Rind of 1/2 lemon, grated  3 tablespoons brandy  Salt         Stir and mix well together in the order given and let stand 1       hour or more to thicken the batter so it will hold its shape       while cooking.         Shape batter like walnuts and hold one at a time in the bowl of a       long-handled spoon dipped for 10 seconds in boiling hot oil.       Fritter the \"walnuts\" so, and serve at once with powdered sugar.         To make fascinating cheese croquettes, mix several contrasting       cheeses in this batter.       Italian Asparagus and Cheese         This gives great scope for contrasting cheeses in one and the       same dish. In a shallow baking pan put a foundation layer of       grated Cheddar and a little butter. Cover with a layer of tender       parts of asparagus, lightly salted; next a layer of grated       Gruyere with a bit of butter, and another of asparagus. From here       you can go as far as you like with varied layers of melting       cheeses alternating with asparagus, until you come to the top,       where you add two more kinds of cheese, a mixture of powdered       Parmesan with Sapsago to give the new-mown hay scent.       Garlic on Cheese         For one sandwich prepare 30 or 40 garlic cloves by removing skins       and frying out the fierce pungence in smoking olive oil. They       skip in the hot pan like Mexican jumping beans. Toast one side of       a thickish slice of bread, put this side down on a grilling pan,       cover it with a slice of imported Swiss Emmentaler or Gruyere, of       about the same size, shape and thickness. Stick the cooked garlic       cloves, while still blistering hot, in a close pattern into the       cheese and brown for a minute under the grill. Salt lightly and       dash with paprika for the color. (Recipe by Bob Brown in Merle       Armitage's collection _Fit for a King_.)    Spaniards call garlic cloves teeth, Englishmen call them toes. It was  cheese and garlic together that inspired Shakespeare to Hotspur's  declaration in _King Henry IV_:        I had rather live      With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,      Than feed on cates and have him talk to me      In any summer-house in Christendom.    Some people can take a mere _soupcon_ of the stuff, while others can  down it by the soup spoon, so we feel it necessary in reprinting our  recipe to point to the warning of another early English writer:  \"Garlic is very dangerous to young children, fine women and hot young  men.\"       Blintzes         This snow white member of the crepes suzette sorority is the most       popular deb in New York's fancy cheese dishes set. Almost unknown       here a decade or two ago, it has joined blinis, kreplach and       cheeseburgers as a quick and sustaining lunch for office workers.    2 eggs  1 cup water  1 cup sifted flour  Salt  Cooking oil  1/2 pound cottage cheese  2 tablespoons butter  2 cups sour cream         Beat 1 egg light and make a batter with the water, flour and salt       to taste. Heat a well-greased small frying pan and make little       pancakes with 2 tablespoons of batter each. Cook the cakes over       low heat and on one side only. Slide each cake off on a white       cloth, with the cooked side down. While these are cooling make       the blintz-filling by beating together the second egg, cottage       cheese and butter. Spread each pancake thickly with the mixture       and roll or make into little pockets or envelopes with the end       tucked in to hold the filling. Cook in foil till golden-brown and       serve at once with sufficient sour cream to smother them.       Vatroushki         Russia seems to have been the cradle of all sorts of blinis and       blintzes, and perhaps the first, of them to be made was       vatroushki, a variant of the blintzes above. The chief       difference is that rounds of puff paste dough are used instead of       the hot cakes, 1 teaspoon of sugar is added to the cottage cheese       filling, and the sour"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14297"],[0,"The Congo and Coasts of Africa (#17)"],[1,"stop at an uptown office, and on a diagram of the  ship's insides, as though you were playing roulette, point at a  number. Instead, as you are to occupy your cabin, not for one, but  for six, weeks, you search, as vigilantly as a navy officer looking  for contraband, the ship herself and each cabin.    But going aboard was a simple ceremony. The Hotel Splendide stands  on the bank of the Congo River. After saying \"Good-by\" to her  proprietor, I walked to the edge of the water and waved my helmet.  In the Congo, a white man standing in the sun without a hat is a  spectacle sufficiently thrilling to excite the attention of all, and  at once Captain Hughes of the _Nigeria_ sent a cargo boat to the  rescue, and on the shoulders of naked Kroo boys Mrs. Davis and the  maid, and the trunks, spears, tents, bathtubs, carved idols, native  mats, and a live mongoos were dropped into it, and we were paddled  to the gangway.    \"If that's all, we might as well get under way,\" said Captain  Hughes. The anchor chains creaked, from the bank the proprietor of  the Splendide waved his hand, and the long voyage to Liverpool had  begun. It was as casual as halting and starting a cable-car.    According to schedule, after leaving the Congo, we should have gone  south and touched at Loanda. But on this voyage, outward bound, the  _Nigeria_ had carried, to help build the railroad at Lobito Bay, a  deckload of camels. They had proved trying passengers, and instead  of first touching at the Congo, Captain Hughes had continued on  south and put them ashore. So we were robbed of seeing both Loanda  and the camels.    This line, until Calabar is reached, carries but few passengers,  and, except to receive cargo, the ship is not fully in commission.  During this first week she is painted, and holystoned, her carpets  are beaten, her cabins scrubbed and aired, and the passengers mess  with the officers. So, of the ship's life, we acquired an intimate  knowledge, her interests became our own, and the necessity of  feeding her gaping holds with cargo was personal and acute. On a  transatlantic steamer, when once the hatches are down, the captain  need think only of navigation; on these coasters, the hatches never  are down, and the captain, that sort of captain dear to the heart of  the owners, is the man who fills the holds.    A skipper going ashore to drum up trade was a novel spectacle.  Imagine the captain of one of the Atlantic greyhounds prying among  the warehouses on West Street, demanding of the merchants:  \"Anything going my way, this trip?\" He would scorn to do it. Before  his passengers have passed the custom officers, he is in mufti, and  on his way to his villa on Brooklyn Heights, or to the Lambs Club,  and until the Blue Peter is again at the fore, little he cares for  passengers, mails, or cargo. But the captain of a \"coaster\" must be  sailor and trader, too. He is expected to navigate a coast, the  latest chart of which is dated somewhere near 1830, and at which the  waves rush in walls of spray, sometimes as high as a three-story  house. He must speak all the known languages of Europe, and all the  unknown tongues of innumerable black brothers. At each port he must  entertain out of his own pocket the agents of all the trading  houses, and, in his head, he must keep the market price, \"when laid  down in Liverpool,\" of mahogany, copra, copal, rubber, palm oil, and  ivory. To see that the agent has not overlooked a few bags of ground  nuts, or a dozen puncheons of oil, he must go on shore and peer into  the compound of each factory, and on board he must keep peace  between the Kroo boys and the black deck passengers, and see that  the white passengers with a temperature of 105, do not drink more  than is good for them. At least, those are a few of the duties the  captains on the ships controlled by Sir Alfred Jones, who is Elder  and Dempster, are expected to perform. No wonder Sir Alfred is  popular.    Our first port of call was Landana, in Portuguese territory, but two  ships of the Woermann Line were there ahead of us and had gobbled up  all the freight. So we could but up anchor and proceed to  Libreville, formerly the capital of the French Congo. At five in the  morning by the light of a ship's lantern, we were paddled ashore to  drum up trade. We found two traders, Ives and Thomas, who had  waiting for the _Nigeria_ at the mouth of the Gabun River six  hundred logs of mahogany, and, in consequence, there was general  rejoicing, and Scotch and \"sparklets,\" and even music from a German  music-box that would burst into song only after it had been fed with  a copper. One of the clerks said that Ives had forgotten how to  extract the coppers and in consequence was using the music-box as a  savings bank.    In the French Congo the natives are permitted to trade; in the  Congo Free State they are not, or, rather, they have nothing with  which to trade, and the contrast between the empty \"factories\" of  the Congo and those of Libreville, crowded with natives buying and  selling, was remarkable. There also was a conspicuous difference in  the quality and variety of the goods. In Leopold's Congo \"trade\"  goods is a term of contempt. It describes articles manufactured only  for those who have no choice and must accept whatever is offered.  When your customers must take what you please to give them the  quality of your goods is likely to deteriorate. Salt of the poorest  grade, gaudy fabrics that neither \"wear\" nor \"wash,\" bars of coarse  soap (the native is continually washing his single strip of cloth),  and axe-heads made of iron, are what Leopold thinks are a fair  exchange for the forced labor of the black.    But the articles I found in the factories in Libreville were what,  in the Congo, are called \"white man's goods\" and were of excellent  quality and in great variety. There were even French novels and  cigars. Some of the latter, called the Young American on account of  the name and the flag on the lid, tempted me, until I saw they were  manufactured by Dusseldorffer and Vanderswassen, and one suspected  Rotterdam.    In Ives's factory I saw for the first time a \"trade\" rifle, or Tower  musket. In the vernacular of the Coast, they are \"gas-pipe\" guns.  They are put together in England, and to a white man are a most  terrifying weapon. The original Tower muskets, such as, in the days  of '76, were hung over the fireplace of the forefathers of the Sons  of the Revolution, were manufactured in England, and stamped with  the word \"Tower,\" and for the reigning king G.R. I suppose at that  date at the Tower of London there was an arsenal; but I am ready to  be corrected. To-day the guns are manufactured at Birmingham, but  they still have the flint lock, and still are stamped with the word  \"Tower\" and the royal crown over the letters G.R., and with the  arrow which is supposed to mark the property of the government. The  barrel is three feet four inches long, and the bore is that of an  artesian well. The native fills four inches of this cavity with  powder and the remaining three feet with rusty nails, barbed wire,  leaden slugs, and the legs and broken parts of iron pots. An officer  of the W.A.F.F.'s, in a fight in the bush in South Nigeria, had one  of these things fired at him from a distance of fifteen feet. He  told me all that saved him was that when the native pulled the  trigger the recoil of the gun \"kicked\" the muzzle two feet in the  air and the native ten feet into the bush. I bought a Tower rifle at  the trade price, a pound, and brought it home. But although my  friends have offered to back either end of the gun as being the more  destructive, we have found no one with a sufficient sporting spirit  to determine the point.    Libreville is a very pretty town, but when it was laid out the  surveyors just missed placing the Equator in its main street. It is  easy to understand why with such a live wire in the vicinity  Libreville is warm. From the same cause it also is rich in flowers,  vines, and trees growing in generous, undisciplined abundance,  making of Libreville one vast botanical garden, and burying the town  and its bungalows under screens of green and branches of scarlet  and purple flowers. Close to the surf runs an avenue bordered by  giant cocoanut palms and, after the sun is down, this is the  fashionable promenade. Here every evening may be seen in their  freshest linen the six married white men of Libreville, and, in the  latest Paris frocks, the six married ladies, while from the verandas  of the factories that line the sea front and from under the paper  lanterns of the Cafe Guion the clerks and traders sip their absinthe  and play dominoes, and cast envious glances at the six fortunate  fellow exiles.    For several days we lay a few miles south of Libreville, off the  mouth of the Gabun River, taking in the logs of mahogany. It was a  continuous performance of the greatest interest. I still do not  understand why all those engaged in it were not drowned, or pounded  to a pulp. Just before we touched at the Gabun River, two tramp  steamers, chartered by Americans, carried off a full cargo of this  mahogany to the States. It was an experiment the result of which the  traders of Libreville are awaiting with interest. The mahogany that  the reader sees in America probably comes from Hayti, Cuba, or  Belize, and is of much finer quality than that of the Gabun River,  which latter is used for making what the trade calls \"fancy\"  cigar-boxes and cheap furniture. But before it becomes a cigar-box  it passes through many adventures. Weeks before the steamer arrives  the trader, followed by his black boys, explores the jungle and  blazes the trees. Then the boys cut trails through the forest, and,  using logs for rollers, drag and push the tree trunks to the bank of  the river. There the tree is cut into huge cubes, weighing about a  ton, and measuring twelve to fifteen feet in length and three "]]]
