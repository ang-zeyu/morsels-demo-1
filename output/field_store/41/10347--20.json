Bruised nutmeg, cloves, angelica root, and   camphor, each,                                     1/4 oz.  Alcohol (rectified),                                  4 oz.  Concentrated acetic acid,                            16 oz.    Macerate the materials for a day in the spirit; then add the acid, and  digest for a week longer, at a temperature of about 14 deg. C. or 15 deg. C.  Finally, press out the new aromatized acid, and filter it.    As this mixture must not go into the ordinary metallic tincture press,  for the obvious reason of the chemical action that would ensue, it is  best to drain as much of the liquor away as we can, by means of a common  funnel, and then to save the residue from the interstices of the herbs,  by tying them up in a linen cloth, and subjecting them to pressure by  means of an ordinary lemon-squeezer, or similar device.    VINAIGRE A LA ROSE.    Concentrated acetic acid,           1 oz.  Otto of roses,                1/2 drachm.    Well shaken together.    It is obvious that vinegars differently perfumed may be made in a  similar manner to the above, by using other ottos in place of the otto  of roses. All these concentrated vinegars are used in the same way as  perfumed ammonia, that is, by pouring three or four drachms into an  ornamental \"smelling\" bottle, previously filled with crystals of  sulphate of potash, which forms the \"sel de vinaigre\" of the shops; or  upon sponge into little silver boxes, called vinaigrettes, from their  French origin. The use of these vinegars had their origin in the  presumption of keeping those who carried them from the effects of  infectious disease, doubtless springing out of the story of the \"four  thieves' vinegar,\" which is thus rendered in Lewis's Dispensatory:    \"It is said that during the plague at Marseilles, four persons, by the  use of this preservative, attended, unhurt, multitudes of those that  were affected; that under the color of these services, they robbed both  the sick and the dead; and that being afterwards apprehended, one of  them saved himself from the gallows by disclosing the composition of the  prophylactic (a very likely story!!), which was as follows:--    VINAIGRE DES QUATRE VOLEURS, OR FOUR THIEVES' VINEGAR.    Take fresh tops of common wormwood, Roman   wormwood, rosemary, sage, mint, and rue, of   each,                                               3/4 oz.  Lavender flowers,                                      1 oz.  Garlic, calamus aromaticus, cinnamon, cloves,   and nutmeg, each,                                 1 drachm.  Camphor,                                             1/2 oz.  Alcohol or brandy,                                     1 oz.  Strong vinegar,                                     4 pints.    Digest all the materials, except the camphor and spirit, in a closely  covered vessel for a fortnight, at a summer heat; then express and  filter the vinaigre produced, and add the camphor previously dissolved  in the brandy or spirit.\"    A very similar and quite as effective a preparation may be made by  dissolving the odorous principle of the plants indicated in a mixture of  alcohol and acetic acid. Such preparations, however, are more within the  province of the druggist than perfumer. There are, however, several  preparations of vinegar which are sold to some extent for mixing with  the water for lavatory purposes and the bath, their vendors endeavoring  to place them in competition with Eau de Cologne, but with little  avail. Among them may be enumerated--    HYGIENIC OR PREVENTIVE VINEGAR.    Brandy,                    1 pint.  Otto of cloves,          1 drachm.   \"      lavender,        1   \"   \"      marjoram,      1/2 drachm.  Gum benzoin,                 1 oz.    Macerate these together for a few hours, then add--    Brown vinegar,            2 pints.    and strain or filter, if requisite, to be bright.    TOILET VINEGAR (_a la Violette_).    Extract of cassie,            1/2 pint.    \"        orris,             1/4  \"  Esprit de rose, triple,       1/4  \"  White wine vinegar,            2 pints.    TOILET VINEGAR (_a la Rose_).    Dried rose-leaves,               4 oz.  Esprit de rose, triple,      1/2 pint.  White wine vinegar,           2 pints.    Macerate in a close vessel for a fortnight, then filter and bottle for  sale.    VINAIGRE DE COLOGNE.    To eau de Cologne,            1 pint,  Add, strong acetic acid,      1/2 oz.    Filter if necessary.    Without unnecessarily repeating similar formulae, it will be obvious to  the reader that vinegar of any flower may be prepared in a similar way  to those above noticed; thus, for vinaigre a la jasmine, or for vinaigre  a la fleur d'orange, we have only to substitute the esprit de jasmine,  or the esprit de fleur d'orange, in place of the Eau de Cologne, to  produce orange-flower or jasmine vinegars; however, these latter  articles are not in demand, and our only reason for explaining how such  preparations may be made, is in order to suggest the methods of  procedure to any one desirous of making them leading articles in their  trade.    We perhaps may observe, _en passant_, that where economy in the  production of any of the toilet vinegars is a matter of consideration,  they have only to be diluted with rose-water down to the profitable  strength required.    Any of the perfumed vinegars that are required to produce opalescence,  when mixed with water, must contain some gum-resin, like the hygienic  vinegar, as above. Either myrrh, benzoin, storax, or tolu, answer  equally well.          SECTION VI.    BOUQUETS AND NOSEGAYS.      In the previous articles we have endeavored to explain the mode of  preparing the primitive perfumes--the original odors of plants. It will  have been observed, that while the majority can be obtained under the  form of otto or essential oil, there are others which hitherto have not  been isolated, but exist only in solution in alcohol, or in a fatty  body. Of the latter are included all that are most prized, with the  exception of otto of rose--that diamond among the odoriferous gems.  Practically, we have no essential oils or ottos of Jasmine, Vanilla,  Acacia, Tuberose, Cassie, Syringa, Violets, and others. What we know of  these odors is derived from esprits, obtained from oils or fats, in  which the several flowers have been repeatedly infused, and afterwards  infusing such fats or oils in alcohol. Undoubtedly, these odors are the  most generally pleasing, while those made from the essential oils  (_i.e._ otto), dissolved in spirit, are of a secondary character. The  simple odors, when isolated, are called ESSENTIAL OILS or  OTTOS; when dissolved or existing in solution in alcohol, by  the English they are termed ESSENCES, and by the French  EXTRAITS or ESPRITS; a few exceptions prove this rule.  Essential oil of orange-peel, and of lemon-peel, are frequently termed  in the trade \"Essence\" of orange and \"Essence\" of lemons, instead of  essential oil or otto of lemons, &c. The sooner the correct nomenclature  is used in perfumery, as well as in the allied arts, the better, and the  fewer blunders will be made in the dispensatory. It appears to the  writer, that if the nomenclature of these substances were revised, it  would be serviceable; and he would suggest that, as a significant,  brief, and comprehensive term, Otto be used as a prefix to denote that  such and such a body is the odoriferous principle of the plant. We  should then have otto of lavender instead of essential oil of lavender,  &c. &c. In this work it will be seen that the writer has generally used  the word OTTO in place of \"essential oil,\" in accordance with  his views. Where there exists a solution of an essential oil in a fat  oil, the necessity of some such significant distinction is rendered  obvious, for commercially such articles are still called \"oils\"--oil of  jasmine, oil of roses, &c. It cannot be expected that the public will  use the words \"fat\" oil and \"essential\" oil, to distinguish these  differences of composition.    There are several good reasons why the odoriferous principle of plants  should not be denominated oils. In the first place, it is a bad  principle to give any class of substances the same signification as  those belonging to another. Surely, there are enough distinguishing  qualities in their composition, their physical character, and chemical  reaction, to warrant the application of a significant name to that large  class of substances known as the aroma of plants!    When the chemical nomenclature was last revised, the organic bodies  were little dealt with. We know that we owe this universal \"oil\" to the  old alchemist, much in the same way as \"spirit\" has been used, but a  little consideration quickly indicates the folly of its continued use.  We can no longer call otto of rosemary, or otto of nutmegs, essential  oil of rosemary or nutmegs, with any more propriety than we can term  sulphuric acid \"oil\" of vitriol. All the chemical works speak of the  odoriferous bodies as \"essential\" or \"volatile\" oils, and of the greasy  bodies as \"fat\" or \"unctuous\" oils. Oils, properly so called, unite with  salifiable bases and form soap; whereas the essential or volatile oils,  _i.e._ what we would please to call the ottos, do no such thing. On the  contrary, they unite with acids in the majority of instances.    The word oil must hereafter be confined to those bodies to which its  literal meaning refers--fat, unctuous, inodorous (when pure), greasy  substances--and can no longer be applied to those odoriferous materials  which possess qualities diametrically opposite to oil. We have grappled  with \"spirit,\" and fixed its meaning in a chemical sense; we have no  longer \"spirit\" of salt, or \"spirit\" of hartshorn. Let us no longer have  almond oil \"essential,\" almond oil \"unctuous,\" and the like.

Sir Frederick Young, who was most warmly received, said in he first       place he must tender his hearty thanks to the Chairman for the very       kind manner in which he had introduced him. The attention of the       audience this evening would be directed to the desirability of       promoting the unity of the British Empire. Before commencing his       address, he wished to emphasize what the Chairman had already       expressed with regard to the rules of the association on political       subjects. In connection with that, he would say that the subject he       was about to speak upon did not touch upon party politics in any       way, as it was a National question, and might be excepted from       their rigid rule. The subject of Imperial Federation was, to his       mind, of so vast and vital a character, and of such importance to       the whole nation collectively, that it impressed him with the       responsibility he incurred in speaking upon it, and the feeling he       had of being unable to do full justice to it. He spoke with some       confidence on the subject, because he claimed to be one of the       pioneers of the idea of Imperial Federation, which meant \"the       government of the Empire by the Empire.\" He wished to take his       hearers back to the origin of English parliaments, when the first       idea of representation occurred to our early kings, and when the       scattered portions of England were at last drawn into one focus of       representation by Edward III., and gradually that kind of       representation succeeded in effecting the Union of England and       Scotland, and subsequently Ireland, things remaining in that form       until the present day. Latterly, our Colonial Empire had grown up       to wonderful and vast dimensions, but as far as the principle of       representation was concerned there had been no great change, though       it was perfectly true that during the past few years a certain       number of the Colonies had obtained what was called       self-government, or what he called the shadow of English government       on the parliamentary system, as retained in its original principle       and plan up to our own times. The Imperial policy of the British       Empire was entirely conducted at Home, and Imperial Federation       meant that this system should be changed, and that those who were       living outside the borders of the British Isles should have their       true participation in the government of the Empire. This led him to       a point on which there was very much misunderstanding on the part       of those who had heard the subject of Imperial Federation       mentioned, and who thought there must be some idea of those who       advocated it at Home getting some advantage over their colonial       brethren, and draw them into a net, by which they would have to       part with their rights of local self-government. He utterly denied       that there were any such intentions--on the contrary, this was an       invitation to them, a cry from the Old Country, asking them to come       and assist in governing the Empire. This could only be effected by       Imperial Federation, which would mean the termination of what was       called the rule of Downing Street, which would be superseded by       something far different, and, in his opinion, be far more       acceptable to the colonists themselves. They would not have to       suffer, as they had in the past, in many ways, from ignorance,       prejudice, and narrow views, but they would have an opportunity of       taking part in the policy of the Empire, particularly in that which       affected themselves. In consequence of the agitation at Home during       the past few years a successful attempt had been made to establish       what was called the Imperial Federation League, of which he was an       active member, and which took no part in party politics, and was at       the present moment presided over by Lord Rosebery, with the Hon. E.       Stanhope, the present Minister of War, as Vice-President, who, so       far as party politics were concerned, were on totally different       sides. That would prove that in England they did not regard this       great question as one of party politics. One of the most important       results in connection with that League had been the celebrated       Colonial Conference, which the League had been able to induce the       Government to summon two years ago at Westminster. They all knew       what a remarkable gathering that was, which was presided over by       Lord Knutsford (then Sir Henry Holland), the summons being       responded to by the self-governing Colonies of the Empire sending       their foremost men to represent their interests. From South Africa       were sent such men as Sir Thomas Upington, Sir John Robinson, and       Mr. Hofmeyr, and he confessed that, when he had the honour of being       at the first meeting of the Conference, and seeing these men       gathered in the Foreign Office, and having present the Prime       Minister, Lord Salisbury, if his dream of Imperial Federation was       to be anything more than a dream, he felt that these were the first       symptoms of its realization. It was the first time in history that       the Colonies of Great Britain had come to the Mother Country to       consult on great National questions. He had read nearly the whole       of the large Blue Book which contained the reports of the       Conference, and all he could say was that he challenged any       assembly of public men to meet together and show more ability and       statesmanlike thought in the discussion of the questions submitted       to them than was shown by that Conference during its short reign.       He was delighted with the noble words of Lord Salisbury, when he       expressed his satisfaction, and said he hoped this would be only       the first of many similar Conferences, but Lord Salisbury, like       other public men, sometimes saw occasion to change his views,       because not long ago he said, on a public occasion, that all he       knew about Federation was, that it was a word spelt with ten       letters, which was somewhat of a wet blanket to some of those who       had reckoned upon Lord Salisbury as an ardent supporter. More       recently he said, in reply to a question put to him at a public       meeting at the East End of London, that geographical considerations       would prevent the realization of such a scheme; but his allusions       to geographical difficulties vanished before modern science. Was it       not in their cognizance that in South Africa, through the medium of       the telegraph, they were able to know what was taking place in       England within twenty-four hours? Geographical considerations,       indeed! that might have been all very well some years ago, when it       took three or four months to reach the Cape, but now it took only       two or three weeks, and that time would even be probably reduced as       time wore on. Such being the case, geographical considerations had       nothing whatever to do with the matter. He had no desire to speak       unfairly of the gentleman who occupied the position of Prime       Minister of the Empire, but he felt sure the time would come when       Lord Salisbury would think that Imperial Federation was something       more than a word of ten letters; and that his geographical       considerations would vanish also, as having no reason in them. In       contrast to Lord Salisbury, he would read a short extract from a       speech, made only a few months ago at Leeds by Lord Rosebery, when       he said: \"For my part, if you will forgive me this little bit of       egotism, I can say from the bottom of my heart that it is the       dominant passion of my public life. Ever since I traversed those       great regions which own the sway of the British Crown outside these       islands, I have felt that there was a cause, which merited all the       enthusiasm and energy that man could give to it. It is a cause for       which any one might be content to live; it is a cause for which, if       needs be, any one might be content to die.\" Lord Rosebery was at       this moment the President of the Imperial Federation League, and       only recently he addressed a letter, on behalf of the League, to       Lord Salisbury, asking that the Government would summon another       Conference like the one which took place with such wonderful       results two years ago, and which Lord Salisbury had said he hoped       would be the first of many more. The answer he gave, however, was       something to the effect that he did not think it desirable that the       Government should move in the matter, but that the Colonies should       take the initiative. With all humility he would ask how anything of       this kind could be moved, except by some motor? There must be       something to move the colonists, and who could do that so well as       Her Majesty's Government, by inviting, in a courteous and       sympathetic spirit, the Colonies to come again and consult on       Imperial subjects. He would now touch upon some of the errors       prevalent on this great question of Imperial Federation. In some of       the Colonies, New Zealand in particular, something had been said       that in course of time independence must be the inevitable result.       But he asked why should this be the case? He would also like to say       something about what were Imperial questions? Some of the subjects       which would be dealt with by the Imperial Federated Parliament       would be those of National defence, peace and war, and all subjects       in which national interests are concerned.
