The Patrol won't be here tomorrow at  sunrise, no matter how much we wish a scouter would planet then.\"    Vye was quiet as he stowed in the flitter again. As Hume had said,  events moved fast. A little while ago he had wanted to settle with  this Out-Hunter, wring out of him not only an explanation for his  being here, but claim satisfaction for the humiliation of being moved  about to suit some others' purposes. Now he was willing to defeat  Wass, bring in the Patrol, go up against whatever hid in that lake up  there, providing Hume was not the loser. He tried to think why that  was so and could not, he only knew it was the truth.    They were both silent as they took off from Wass' deserted camp, sped  away over the black blot of the woodland towards the safari  headquarters on the plains. There were stars above again but no  globes. Just as they had won their freedom from the valley, so they  moved without escort on the plains.    But the lights were there--not impinging on the flitter, or patrolling  along its line of flight. No, they hung in a glowing cluster ahead  when in the dawn the flitter shot away from the woods, headed for the  landmark of the safari camp. A crown of lights circled over the camp  site, as if those below were in a state of siege.    Hume aimed straight for them and this time the bobbing circle split  wide open, broke to left and right. Vye looked below. Though the  grayness of the morning was still hardly more than dusk he could not  miss those humps spaced at intervals on the land, just beyond the  unseen line of the force barrier. The lights above, the beasts below,  the safari camp was under guard.          12      \"There is only one way they could be moving--toward the mountains.\"  Hume stood in the open space among the bubble tents, facing him the  four men of the camp, the three civs and Rovald. \"You say it's been  seven days, planet time, since I left here. They may have been five  days on that trail. If possible we have to stop them before they reach  that valley.\"    \"A fantastic story.\" Chambriss wore the affronted expression of a man  who expected no interference with his own concerns. Then catching  Hume's eye he added, \"Not that we doubt you, Hunter. We have the  evidence in those dumb brutes waiting out there. However, by your own  story, this Wass is an outside-the-law Veep, on this planet secretly  for criminal purposes. Surely there is no reason for us to risk our  safety in his behalf. Are you certain he is in any danger at all? You  and this young man here have, by your testimony, been into the  enemies' territory and have been able to get out again.\"    \"Through a series of fortunate chances which might never occur again.\"  Hume was patient, too patient, Rovald seemed to think. His hand moved,  he was holding a ray tube so that a simple movement of the wrist could  send a crisping blast across all the rest of the party.    \"I say, stop this yapping and get out there and pick up the Veep!\"    \"I intend to--after I call the Patrol.\"    Rovald's tube was now aimed directly at Hume. \"No Patrol!\" he  ordered.    \"This wrangling has gone far enough.\" It was Yactisi who spoke with an  authority which startled them all. And as their attention swung to  him, he was already in action.    Rovald cried out, the weapon spun from his fingers, fingers which were  slowly reddening. Yactisi nodded with satisfaction and he held his  electo pole ready for a second attack. Vye scooped up the tube which  had whirled across the ground to strike against his borrowed boot.    \"I'll set the call for the Patrol, then I'll try to locate Wass,\" Hume  stated.    \"Sensible procedure,\" Yactisi approved in his dry voice. \"You believe  that you are now immune to whatever force this alien installation  controls?\"    \"It would seem so.\"    \"Then, of course, you must go.\"    \"Why?\" Chambriss countered for the second time. \"Suppose he isn't so  immune after all? Suppose he gets out there and is captured again?  He's our pilot--do you want to be planet bound _here_?    \"This man is also a pilot.\" Starns indicated Rovald, who was nursing  his numb hand.    \"Since he, too, is one of these criminals, he's not to be trusted!\"  Chambriss shot back. \"Hunter, I demand that you take us off planet at  once! And it is only fair to inform you that I also intend to prefer  charges against you and against the Guild. Empty world! Just how empty  have we found this world?\"    \"But, Gentlehomo,\" Starns showed no signs of any emotion but eager  curiosity, \"to be here at this time is a privilege we could not hope  to equal except by good fortune! The T-Casts will be avid for our  stories.\"    What had that to do with the matter, puzzled Vye. But he saw Starns'  reminder produce a quick change in Chambriss.    \"The T-Casts,\" he repeated, his expression of anger smoothing away.  \"Yes, of course, this is, in a manner of speaking, a truly historic  occasion. We are in a unique position!\"    Had Yactisi smiled? That change of lip line had been so slight Vye  could not call it a smile. But Starns appeared to have found the right  way to handle Chambriss. And it was the same little man who offered  his services in another way when he said, diffidently to Hume:    \"I have some experience with coms, Hunter. Do you wish me to send your  message and take over the unit until you return? I gather,\" he added  with a certain delicacy, \"that it will not be expedient for your  gearman to engage in that duty now.\"    So it was that Starns was installed in the com cabin of the spacer,  sending out the request for Patrol aid, while Rovald was locked in the  storage compartment of the same ship, pending arrival of those same  authorities. As Hume sorted out supplies and Vye loaded them into the  waiting flitter, Yactisi approached the Hunter.    \"You have a definite plan of search?\"    \"Just to cast north from their camp. If they've been gone long enough  to hit the foothills we may be able to sight them climbing. Otherwise,  we'll go all the way up to the valley, wait for them there.\"    \"You don't believe that they will be released after they have  been--processed?\"    Hume shook his head. \"I don't think we would have been free,  Gentlehomo, if it hadn't been for a series of fortunate accidents.\"    \"Yes, though you didn't give us many details about that, Hunter.\"    Hume put down the needler he had been charging. He studied Yactisi  across that weapon.    \"Who are you?\" His voice was soft but carried a snap.    For the first time Vye saw the tall, lean civ really smile.    \"A man of many interests, Hunter--shall we let it go at that for the  present? Though I assure you that Wass is not one of them in the way  you might believe.\"    Gray eyes met brown, held so straightly. Then Hume spoke. \"I believe  you. But I have told you the truth.\"    \"I have never doubted that--only the amount of it. There must be more  talking later on--you understand that?\"    \"I never thought otherwise.\" Hume set the needler inside the flitter.  The civ smiled again, this time including Vye in that evidence of good  will before he walked away.    Hume made no comment. \"That does it,\" he told his companion. \"Still  want to go?\"    \"If you do--and you can't do it alone.\" No man could take on the  valley and Wass and his men.    Hume made no comment. They had rested briefly after their return to  the safari camp, and Vye had been supplied with clothing from Hume's  bags, so that now he wore the uniform of the Guild. He went armed,  too, with the equipment belt taken from Rovald and that other's  weapons, needler and tube. At least they started on their dubious  rescue mission with every aid the safari camp could muster.    It was mid-afternoon when the flitter took to the air once again,  scattering the hovering globes. There was no alteration in the ranks  of the blue watchers waiting--for the barrier to go down, or someone  in the camp to step beyond that protection?    \"They're stupid,\" Vye said.    \"Not stupid, just geared to one set of actions,\" Hume returned.    \"Which could mean that what sends them here can't change its orders.\"    \"Good guess. I'd say that they were governed by something akin to our  tapes. No provision made for any innovations.\"    \"So the guiding intelligence could be long gone.\"    \"I think it has been.\" Hume then changed the subject sharply.    \"How did you get into service at the Starfall?\"    It was hard now to think back to Nahuatl--as if the Vye Lansor who had  been swamper in that den of the port town was a different person  altogether. In that patch of memories into which Rynch Brodie still  intruded he hunted for the proper answer.    \"I couldn't hold the state jobs. And once you get the habit of eating,  you don't starve willingly.\"    \"Why not the state jobs?\"    \"Without premium they're all low-rung tenders' places. I tried hard  enough. But to sit pressing buttons when a light flashed, hour after  hour--\" Vye shook his head. \"They said I was too erratic and gave me  the shove. One more move on and it would have been compulsive  conditioning. I turned port-drift instead.\"    \"Ever thought of trying for a loan premium?\"    Vye laughed shortly. \"Loan premium? That's a true fantasy if you've  been job hopping. None of the companies will take a chance on a man  with an in and out record. Oh, I tried....\" That memory arose to the  surface, clear and very chilling. Yes, he had tried to break out of  the net the law and custom had put around him from the day he had  been made a state child. \"No--it was conditioning, or port-drift.\"    \"And you chose port-drift?\"    \"I was still me--as long as I stayed away from conditioning.\"    \"Then you became Rynch Brodie in spite of your flight.\"    \"No--well, maybe, for a while. But I'm still Vye Lansor here.\"    \"Yes, here.

It had  become naturalized, but had lost in the process its very core. The  preparation for a life after death, which was its Alpha and Omega, had  passed into the background. It was not joy at the promised 'Redemption'  that expressed itself in the dance around the cradle; for the German has  never learnt to feel himself utterly vile and sinful: it was joy at the  simple fact that a human being, a particular human being in peculiar  circumstances, was born into the world.... The Middle Ages showed in the  cradle-rocking 'a true German and most lovable childlikeness.' The Christ  Child was the 'universal little brother of all children of earth,' and  they acted accordingly, they lulled Him to sleep, they fondled and rocked  Him, they danced before Him and leapt around Him _in dulci jubilo_.\"{51}  There is much here that is true of the cult of the Christ Child in other  countries than Germany, though perhaps Dr. Tille underestimates the  religious feeling that is often joined to the human sentiment.    The fifteenth century was the great period for the _Kindelwiegen_, the  time when it appears to have been practised in all the churches of  Germany; in the sixteenth it began to seem |111| irreverent to the  stricter members of the clergy, and the figure of the infant Jesus was in  many places no longer rocked in the cradle but enthroned on the  altar.{52} This usage is described by Naogeorgus (1553):--             \"A woodden childe in clowtes is on the aultar set,      About the which both boyes and gyrles do daunce and trymly jet,      And Carrols sing in prayse of Christ, and, for to helpe them heare,      The organs aunswere every verse with sweete and solemne cheare.      The priestes do rore aloude; and round about the parentes stande      To see the sport, and with their voyce do helpe them and their            hande.\"{53}    The placing of a \"Holy Child\" above the altar at Christmas is still  customary in many Roman Catholic churches.    Protestantism opposed the _Kindelwiegen_, on the grounds both of  superstition and of the disorderly proceedings that accompanied it, but  it was long before it was utterly extinguished even in the Lutheran  churches. In Catholic churches the custom did not altogether die out,  though the unseemly behaviour which often attended it--and the growth of  a pseudo-classical taste--caused its abolition in most places.{54}    At Tuebingen as late as 1830 at midnight on Christmas Eve an image of the  Christ Child was rocked on the tower of the chief church in a small  cradle surrounded with lights, while the spectators below sang a  cradle-song.{55} According to a recent writer the \"rocking\" is still  continued in the Upper Innthal.{56} In the Tyrolese cathedral city of  Brixen it was once performed every day between Christmas and Candlemas by  the sacristan or boy-acolytes. That the proceedings had a tendency to be  disorderly is shown by an eighteenth-century instruction to the  sacristan: \"Be sure to take a stick or a thong of ox-hide, for the boys  are often very ill-behaved.\"{57}    There are records of other curious ceremonies in German or Austrian  churches. At St. Peter am Windberge in Muehlkreis in Upper Austria, during  the service on Christmas night a life-sized wooden figure of the Holy  Child was offered in |112| a basket to the congregation; each person  reverently kissed it and passed it on to his neighbour. This was done as  late as 1883.{58} At Crimmitschau in Saxony a boy, dressed as an angel,  used to be let down from the roof singing Luther's \"Vom Himmel hoch,\" and  the custom was only given up when the breaking of the rope which  supported the singer had caused a serious accident.{59}           *       *       *       *       *    It is in Italy, probably, that the cult of the Christ Child is most  ardently practised to-day. No people have a greater love of children than  the Italians, none more of that dramatic instinct which such a form of  worship demands. \"Easter,\" says Countess Martinengo-Cesaresco, \"is the  great popular feast in the eastern Church, Christmas in the  Latin--especially in Italy. One is the feast of the next world, and the  other of this. Italians are fond of this world.\"{60} Christmas is for  the poorer Italians a summing up of human birthdays, an occasion for  pouring out on the _Bambino_ parental and fraternal affection as well as  religious worship.    In Rome, Christmas used to be heralded by the arrival, ten days before  the end of Advent, of the Calabrian minstrels or _pifferari_ with their  sylvan pipes (_zampogne_), resembling the Scottish bagpipe, but less  harsh in sound. These minstrels were to be seen in every street in Rome,  playing their wild plaintive music before the shrines of the Madonna,  under the traditional notion of charming away her labour-pains. Often  they would stop at a carpenter's shop \"per politezza al messer San  Giuseppe.\"{61} Since 1870 the _pifferari_ have become rare in Rome, but  some were seen there by an English lady quite recently. At Naples, too,  there are _zampognari_ before Christmas, though far fewer than there used  to be; for one _lira_ they will pipe their rustic melodies before any  householder's street Madonna through a whole _novena_.{62}    [Illustration:    CALABRIAN SHEPHERDS PLAYING IN ROME AT CHRISTMAS.    _After an Etching by D. Allan._    From Hone's \"Every-day Book\" (London, 1826).]    In Sicily, too, men come down from the mountains nine days before  Christmas to sing a _novena_ to a plaintive melody accompanied by 'cello  and violin. \"All day long,\" writes Signora Caico about Montedoro in  Caltanissetta, \"the melancholy dirge  |113| was sung round the village,  house after house, always the same minor tune, the words being different  every day, so that in nine days the whole song was sung out.... I often  looked out of the window to see them at a short distance, grouped before  a house, singing their stanzas, well muffled in shawls, for the air is  cold in spite of the bright sunshine.... The flat, white houses all  round, the pure sky overhead, gave an Oriental setting to the scene.\"    Another Christmas custom in the same place was the singing of a _novena_  not outside but within some of the village houses before a kind of altar  gaily decorated and bearing at the top a waxen image of the Child Jesus.  \"Close to it the orchestra was grouped--a 'cello, two violins, a guitar,  and a tambourine. The kneeling women huddled in front of the altar. All  had on their heads their black _mantelline_. They began at once singing  the _novena_ stanzas appointed for that day; the tune was primitive and  very odd: the first half of the stanza was quick and merry, the second  half became a wailing dirge.\" A full translation of a long and very  interesting and pathetic _novena_ is given by Signora Caico.[39]{63}    The _presepio_ both in Rome and at Naples is the special Christmas symbol  in the home, just as the lighted tree is in Germany. In Rome the Piazza  Navona is the great place for the sale of little clay figures of the holy  persons. (Is there perchance a survival here of the _sigillaria_, the  little clay dolls sold in Rome at the _Saturnalia_?) These are bought in  the market for two _soldi_ each, and the _presepi_ or \"Bethlehems\" are  made at home with cardboard and moss.{64} The home-made _presepi_ at  Naples are well described by Matilde Serao; they are pasteboard models of  the landscape of Bethlehem--a hill with the sacred cave beneath it and  two or three paths leading down to the grotto, a little tavern, a  shepherd's hut, a few trees, sometimes a stream in glittering glass. The  ground is made verdant with moss, and there is |114| straw within the  cave for the repose of the infant Jesus; singing angels are suspended by  thin wires, and the star of the Wise Men hangs by an invisible thread.  There is little attempt to realize the scenery of the East; the Child is  born and the Magi adore Him in a Campanian or Calabrian setting.{66}    Italian churches, as well as Italian homes, have their _presepi_.  \"Thither come the people, bearing humble gifts of chestnuts, apples,  tomatoes, and the like, which they place as offerings in the hands of the  figures. These are very often life-size. Mary is usually robed in blue  satin, with crimson scarf and white head-dress. Joseph stands near her  dressed in the ordinary working-garb. The onlookers are got up like  Italian contadini. The Magi are always very prominent in their grand  clothes, with satin trains borne by black slaves, jewelled turbans, and  satin tunics all over jewels.\"{67}    [Illustration:    ST. FRANCIS INSTITUTES THE \"PRESEPIO\" AT GRECCIO.    _By Giotto._    (Upper Church of St Francis, Assissi)]    [Illustration: THE \"BAMBINO\" OF ARA COELI.]    In Rome the two great centres of Christmas devotion are the churches of  Santa Maria Maggiore, where are preserved the relics of the cradle of  Christ, and Ara Coeli, the home of the most famous _Bambino_ in the  world. A vivid picture of the scene at Santa Maria Maggiore in the early  nineteenth century is given by Lady Morgan. She entered the church at  midnight on Christmas Eve to wait for the procession of the _culla_, or  cradle. \"Its three ample naves, separated by rows of Ionic columns of  white marble, produced a splendid vista. Thousands of wax tapers marked  their form, and contrasted their shadows; some blazed from golden  candlesticks on the superb altars of the lateral chapels.... Draperies of  gold and crimson decked the columns, and spread their shadows from the  inter-columniations over the marble pavement. In the midst of this  imposing display of church magnificence, sauntered or reposed a  population which displayed the most squalid misery.
