The five times repeated \"Bless the Lord, O my soul\" (Ps. ciii. civ.),  were said by David with reference both to God and the soul. As God fills  the whole world, so does the soul fill the whole body; as God sees and  is not seen, so the soul sees and is not seen; as God nourishes the  whole world, so does the soul nourish the whole body; as God is pure, so  also is the soul pure; as God dwelleth in secret, so does the soul dwell  in secret. Therefore let him who possesses these five properties praise  Him to whom these five attributes belong.    _Berachoth_, fol. 10, col. 1.    Five things have in them a sixtieth part of five other things:--Fire,  honey, the Sabbath, sleep, and dreams. Fire is a sixtieth of hell, honey  a sixtieth of manna, the Sabbath a sixtieth of the rest in the world to  come, sleep the sixtieth of death, and a dream the sixtieth of prophecy.    _Berachoth_, fol. 57, col. 2.    There are five weak things that are a source of terror to the  strong:--The mosquito is a terror to the lion, the gnat is a terror to  the elephant, the ichneumon-fly is a terror to the scorpion, the  flycatcher is a terror to the eagle, and the stickleback is a terror to  the leviathan.    _Shabbath_, fol. 77, col. 2.    These five should be killed even on the Sabbath:--The fly of Egypt, the  wasp of Nineveh, the scorpion of Hadabia, the serpent of the land of  Israel, and the mad dog anywhere and everywhere.    Ibid., fol. 121, col. 2.    Five things did Canaan teach his children:--To love one another, to  perpetrate robbery, to practice wantonness, to hate their masters, and  not to speak the truth.      _P'sachim_, fol. 113, col. 2.    Five things were in the first Temple which were not in the second:--The  ark and its cover, with the cherubim; the fire; the Shechinah; the Holy  Spirit; and the Urim and Thummim.    _Yoma_, fol. 21, col. 2.    Five things are said respecting the mad dog:--Its mouth gapes wide, it  drops its saliva, its ears hang down, its tail is curled between its  legs, and it slinks along the side of the road. Rav says that a dog's  madness is caused by witches sporting with it. Samuel says it is because  an evil spirit rests upon it.    Ibid., fol. 83, col. 2.    When a man has betrothed one of five women, and does not remember which  of the five it is, while each of them claims the right of betrothment,  then he is duty bound to give to each a bill of divorcement, and to  distribute the dowry due to one among them all. This decision is  according to Rabbi Tarphon, but Rabbi Akiva holds that he must not only  divorce each, but give to each the legal dowry, otherwise he fails in  his duty.    _Yevamoth_, fol. 118, col. 2.    When a person having robbed one of five does not remember which of the  five it was he had robbed, and each claims to have been the victim of  the robbery, then he is to part the stolen property (or the value of it)  among them all, and go his way. So says Rabbi Tarphon, but Rabbi Akiva  argues that the defaulter does not in this way fully exonerate himself;  he must restore to each and all the full value of the plunder.    _Yevamoth_, fol. 118, col. 2.    These things are said concerning garlic:--It nourishes, it glows  inwardly, it brightens the complexion, and increases virility. Some say  that it is a philtre for love, and that it exterminates jealousy.    _Bava Kama_, fol. 82, col. 1.    Five things cause forgetfulness:--Partaking of what has been gnawed by a  mouse or a cat, eating bullock's heart, habitual use of olives, drinking  water that has been washed in, and placing the feet one upon the other  while bathing.    _Horayoth_, fol. 13, col. 2.    Five things restore the memory again:--Bread baked upon coals,  soft-boiled eggs without salt, habitual use of olive oil, mulled wine,  and plenty of salt.    Ibid.    He who does not cheer the bridegroom whose wedding breakfast he has  enjoyed transgresses against the five voices (mentioned in Jer. xxxiii.  II):--\"The voice of joy, the voice of gladness, the voice of the  bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say  'Praise ye the Lord of Hosts.'\"    _Berachoth_, fol. 6, col. 2.    Mount Sinai had five names:--(1.) Wilderness of Zin, because on it the  Israelites were commanded to observe the law; (2.) Wilderness of Kadesh,  because on it the Israelites were consecrated to receive the law; (3.)  Wilderness of Kedemoth, because precedence was there given to Israel  over all other nations; (4.) Wilderness of Paran, because there the  Israelites were fruitful and multiplied; (5.) Wilderness of Sinai,  because from it enmity came to be cherished to the Gentiles. It was  denominated Horeb according to Rabbi Abhu, because from it came down  destruction to the Gentiles.    _Shabbath_, fol. 89, cols, 1, 2.    Mar (the master) has said, \"From dawn to the appearance of the sun is  five miles.\" How is this proved? It is written (Gen. xix. 15), \"When the  dawn arose the angels hurried Lot;\" and it is added (verse 25), \"The sun  was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\" And Rabbi Chanena  said, \"I myself have seen that place, and the distance is five miles.\"    _P'sachim_, fol. 93, col. 2.    He that cooks in milk the ischiadic sinew on an annual festival is to be  scourged five times forty stripes save one:--For cooking the sinew, for  eating the sinew, for cooking flesh in milk, for eating flesh cooked in  milk, and for lighting the fire.    _Baitza_, fol. 12, col. 1.        To this very day this sinew is extracted from the hind quarters      of all animals before it is allowable for a Jew to eat them.      This operation, in popular parlance, is termed porging.    The mysteries of the law are not to be communicated except to those who  possess the faculties of these five in combination:--\"The captain of  fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the cunning  artificer, and the eloquent orator\" (see Isa. iii. 3).    _Chaggigah_, fol. 13, col. 1.    \"Captain of fifty.\" This should be read, not captain of fifty, but  captain of five, that is, such as knew how to manage the five-fifths of  the law (or Pentateuch).    Ibid., fol. 14, col. 1.    Five characteristics were ascribed to the fire upon the altar:--It  crouched there like a lion, it shone as the sun, it was perceptible to  the touch, it consumed liquids as though they were dry materials, it  caused no smoke.    _Yoma_, fol. 21, col. 2.    How is it that the word signifying \"And I will be glorified,\" occurs in  Hag. i. 8 without the letter which is the symbol for five, though it is  sounded as if that letter was there? It indicates the absence of five  things from the second Temple which were to be found in the first, (1.)  The ark, i.e., the mercy-seat of the cherubim; (2.) the fire from heaven  upon the altar; (3.) the visible presence; (4.) the Holy Spirit (of  prophecy, says Rashi); and (5.) the Urim and Thummim.    Ibid.        How then, it may be asked, if these five tokens of the Divine      presence and favor which rendered the first Temple so glorious      were wanting in the second could it be said (Hag. ii. 9), \"The      glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former\"?      It is a question which it is natural to ask, and it should be      ingenuously answered. Is it that these were tending to usurp the      place of the spiritual, of which they were but the assurance and      the symbol, and darken rather than reveal the eternal reality      they adumbrated?    The Israelites relished any flavor they fancied in the manna except the  flavor of these five things (mentioned in Num. xi. 59):--\"Cucumbers,  melons, leeks, onions, and garlic.\"    _Yoma_, fol. 75, col. 1.    Five things happened to our forefathers on the 17th of Tammuz, and five  on the 9th of Ab. On the 17th of Tammuz (1.) the tables of the covenant  were broken; (2.) the daily sacrifice was done away with; (3.) the city  walls were cleft asunder; (4.) Apostumes burned the roll of the law;  (5.) and set up an idol in the temple. On the 9th of Ab (1.) the decree  was uttered that our ancestors should not enter the land of Canaan; both  the (2.) first and the (3.) second Temple were destroyed; (4.) Byther  was subjugated and (5.) the city was plowed up.    _Taanith_, fol. 26, cols, 1, 2.    The Rabbis have taught where it is we learn that if one has five sons by  five wives he is bound to redeem each and all of them. It is from what  is taught in Exod. xxxiv. 20, where it is said, \"All the first born of  thy sons shalt thou redeem.\"    _Kiddushin_. fol. 29. col. 2.    If Israel had not sinned they would have had no other Scriptures than  the five-fifths of the law (that is, the Pentateuch) and the book of  Joshua, which last is indispensable, because therein is recorded how the  land was distributed among the sons of Israel; but the remainder was  added, \"Because in much wisdom is much grief\" (Eccles. i. 18).    _Nedarim_, fol. 22, col. 2.    \"If a man steal an ox or a sheep and kill it or sell it, five oxen shall  be given in restitution for one ox, and four sheep for one sheep\" (Exod.  xxii. 1). From this observe the value put upon work. For the loss of an  ox, because it involves the loss of labor, the owner is recompensed with  five oxen; but for the loss of a sheep, which does no work, he is only  recompensed with four.    _Bava Kama_, fol. 79, col. 2.    \"And Esau came from the field, and he was faint\" (Gen. xxv. 29). Rabbi  Yochanan said that wicked man committed on that day five  transgressions:--He committed rape, committed murder, denied the being  of God, denied the resurrection from the dead, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14378"],[0,"Five Years of Theosophy (#17)"],[1,"Row          The Twelve Signs of the Zodiac      The division of the Zodiac into different signs dates from immemorial  antiquity.  It has acquired a world-wide celebrity and is to be found in  the astrological systems of several nations. The invention of the Zodiac  and its signs has been assigned to different nations by different  antiquarians.  It is stated by some that, at first, there were only ten  signs, that one of these signs was subsequently split up into two  separate signs, and that a new sign was added to the number to render  the esoteric significance of the division more profound, and at the same  time to conceal it more perfectly from the uninitiated public.  It is  very probable that the real philosophical conception of the division  owes its origin to some particular nation, and the names given to the  various signs might have been translated into the languages of other  nations.  The principal object of this article, however, is not to  decide which nation had the honour of inventing the signs in question,  but to indicate to some extent the real philosophical meaning involved  therein, and the way to discover the rest of the meaning which yet  remains undisclosed. But from what is herein stated, an inference may  fairly be drawn that, like so many other philosophical myths and  allegories, the invention of the Zodiac and its signs owes its origin to  ancient India.    What then is its real origin, what is the philosophical conception which  the Zodiac and its signs are intended to represent?  Do the various  signs merely indicate the shape or configuration of the different  constellations included in the divisions, or, are they simply masks  designed to veil some hidden meaning?  The former supposition is  altogether untenable for two reasons, viz.:--    I.  The Hindus were acquainted with the precession of the equinoxes, as  may he easily seen from their work on Astronomy, and from the almanacs  published by Hindu astronomers.  Consequently they were fully aware of  the fact that the constellations in the various Zodiacal divisions were  not fixed.  They could not, therefore, have assigned particular shapes  to these shifting groups of fixed stars with reference to the divisions  of the Zodiac.  But the names indicating the Zodiacal signs have all  along remained unaltered.  It is to be inferred, therefore, that the  names given to the various signs have no connection whatever with the  configurations of the constellations included in them.    II. The names assigned to these signs by the ancient Sanskrit writers  and their exoteric or literal meanings are as follows:--    The Names of the Signs ....... Their Exoteric or Literal Meanings    1. Mesha ........................... Ram, or Aries.  2. Rishabha .......................Bull, or Taurus.  3. Mithunam ................... Twins, or Gemini (male and female).  4. Karkataka ...................... Crab, or Cancer.  5. Simha .............................. Lion, or Leo.  6. Kanya ............................. Virgin or Virgo.*  7. Tula .......................... Balance, or Libra.  8. Vrischika ..................... Scorpion, or Scorpio.  9. Dhanus ....................... Archer, or Sagittarius.  10. Makara ........... The Goat, or Capricornus (Crocodile, in Sanskrit).  11. Kumbha .................. Water-bearer, or Aquarius.  12. Meenam ................. Fishes, or Pisces.    The figures of the constellations included in the signs at the time the  division was first made do not at all resemble the shapes of the  animals, reptiles and other objects denoted by the names given them.  The truth of this assertion can be ascertained by examining the  configurations of the various constellations. Unless the shape of the  crocodile** or the crab is called up by the observer's imagination,  there is very little chance of the stars themselves suggesting to his  idea that figure, upon the blue canopy of the starry firmament.    --------  * Virgo-Scorpio, when none but the initiates knew there were twelve  signs.  Virgo-Scorpio was then followed for the profane by Sagittarius.  At the middle or junction-point where now stands Libra and at the sign  now called Virgo, two mystical signs were inserted which remained  unintelligible to the profane.--Ed. Theos.    ** This constellation was never called Crocodile by the ancient Western  astronomers, who described it as a horned goat and called it so--  Capricornus.--Ed. Theos.  --------    If, then, the constellations have nothing to do with the origin of the  names by which the Zodiacal divisions are indicated, we have to seek for  some other source which might have given rise to these appellations.  It  becomes my object to unravel a portion of the mystery connected with  these Zodiacal signs, as also to disclose a portion of the sublime  conception of the ancient Hindu philosophy which gave rise to them.  The  signs of the Zodiac have more than one meaning.  From one point of view  they represent the different stages of evolution up to the time the  present material universe with the five elements came into phenomenal  existence. As the author of \"Isis Unveiled\" has stated in the second  volume of her admirable work, \"The key should be turned seven times\" to  understand the whole philosophy underlying these signs.  But I shall  wind it only once and give the contents of the first chapter of the  History of Evolution.  It is very fortunate that the Sanskrit names  assigned to the various divisions by Aryan philosophers contain within  themselves the key to the solution of the problem.  Those of my readers  who have studied to some extent the ancient \"Mantra\" and the \"Tantra  Sastras\" * of India, would have seen that very often Sanskrit words are  made to convey a certain hidden meaning by means of well-known  pre-arranged methods and a tacit convention, while their literal  significance is something quite different from the implied meaning.    ---------  * Works on Incantation and Magic.  ---------    The following are some of the rules which may help an inquirer in  ferreting out the deep significance of ancient Sanskrit nomenclature to  be found in the old Aryan myths and allegories:    1. Find out the synonyms of the word used which have other meanings.    2. Find out the numerical value of the letters composing the word  according to the methods given in ancient Tantrika works.    3. Examine the ancient myths or allegories, if there are any, which have  any special connection with the word in question.    4. Permute the different syllables composing the word and examine the  new combinations that will thus be formed and their meanings, &c. &c.    I shall now apply some of the above given rules to the names of the  twelve signs of the Zodiac.    I. Mesha.--One of the synonyms of this word is Aja.  Now, Aja literally  means that which has no birth, and is applied to the Eternal Brahma in  certain portions of the Upanishads. So,  the first sign is intended to  represent Parabrahma, the self-existent, eternal, self-sufficient cause  of all.    II. Rishabham.--This word is used in several places in the Upanishads  and the Veda to mean Pranava (Aum).  Sankaracharya has so interpreted it  in several portions of his commentary.*    --------  * Example, \"Rishabhasya--Chandasam Rishabhasya Pradhanasya  Pranavasya.\"  --------    III. Mithuna.--As the word plainly indicates, this sign is intended to  represent the first androgyne, the Ardhanareeswara, the bisexual  Sephira--Adam Kadmon.    IV. Karkataka.--When the syllables are converted into the corresponding  numbers, according to the general mode of transmutation so often alluded  to in Mantra Shastra, the word in question will be represented by ////.  This sign then is evidently intended to represent the sacred Tetragram;  the Parabrahmadharaka;  the Pranava resolved into four separate entities  corresponding to its four Matras;  the four Avasthas indicated by  Jagrata (waking) Avastha, Swapna (dreaming) Avastha, Sushupti (deep  sleep) Avastha, and Turiya (the last stage, i.e., Nirvana) Avastha (as  yet in potentiality);  the four states of Brahma called Vaiswanara,  Taijasa (or Hiranyagarbha), Pragna, and Iswara, and represented by  Brahma, Vishna, Maheswara, and Sadasiva;  the four aspects of  Parabrahma, as Sthula (gross), Sukshma (subtle), Vija (seed), and Sakshi  (witness);  the four stages or conditions of the Sacred Word, named  Para, Pasyanti, Madhyama and Vaikhari;  Nadam, Bindu, Sakti and Kala.  This sign completes the first quaternary.    V. Simha.--This word contains a world of occult meaning within itself;  and it may not be prudent on my part to disclose the whole of its  meaning now.  It will be sufficient for the present purpose to give a  general indication of its significance.    Two of its synonymous terms are Panchasyam and Hari, and its number in  the order of the Zodiacal divisions (being the fifth sign) points  clearly to the former synonym.  This synonym--Panchasyam--shows that  the sign is intended to represent the five Brahmas--viz., Isanam,  Aghoram, Tatpurusham, Vamadevam, and Sadyojatam:--the five Buddhas.  The  second synonym shows it to be Narayana, the Jivatma or Pratyagatma.  The  Sukarahasy Upanishad will show that the ancient Aryan philosophers  looked upon Narayana as the Jivatma.* The Vaishnavites may not admit it.  But as an Advaiti, I look upon Jivatma as identical with Paramatma in  its real essence when stripped of its illusory attributes created by  Agnanam or Avidya--ignorance.    ---------  * In its lowest or most material state, as the life-principle which  animates the material bodies of the animal and vegetable worlds, &c.  --Ed. Theos.  ---------    The Jivatma is correctly placed in the fifth sign counting from Mesham,  as the fifth sign is the putrasthanam or the son's house according to  the rules of Hindu Astrology.  The sign in question represents Jivatma--  the son of Paramatma as it were.  (I may"]]]
