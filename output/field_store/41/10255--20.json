Then  slowly she shut her hand, and the new world faded as she murmured  slowly, \"No, never in that way.\" But he had scarcely time to feel  anything before she walked quickly away, and he followed her down the  steps, along the garden path, under the pink rose arches, across the  lawn. There, with the gay herbaceous border behind her, Anne faced  Reginald. \"It isn't that I'm not awfully fond of you,\" she said. \"I  am. But\"--her eyes widened--\"not in the way\"--a quiver passed over her  face--\"one ought to be fond of--\" Her lips parted, and she couldn't stop  herself. She began laughing. \"There, you see, you see,\" she cried, \"it's  your check t-tie. Even at this moment, when one would think one really  would be solemn, your tie reminds me fearfully of the bow-tie that cats  wear in pictures! Oh, please forgive me for being so horrid, please!\"    Reggie caught hold of her little warm hand. \"There's no question of  forgiving you,\" he said quickly. \"How could there be? And I do believe I  know why I make you laugh. It's because you're so far above me in every  way that I am somehow ridiculous. I see that, Anne. But if I were to--\"    \"No, no.\" Anne squeezed his hand hard. \"It's not that. That's all wrong.  I'm not far above you at all. You're much better than I am. You're  marvellously unselfish and... and kind and simple. I'm none of those  things. You don't know me. I'm the most awful character,\" said Anne.  \"Please don't interrupt. And besides, that's not the point. The point  is\"--she shook her head--\"I couldn't possibly marry a man I laughed at.  Surely you see that. The man I marry--\" breathed Anne softly. She broke  off. She drew her hand away, and looking at Reggie she smiled strangely,  dreamily. \"The man I marry--\"    And it seemed to Reggie that a tall, handsome, brilliant stranger  stepped in front of him and took his place--the kind of man that Anne  and he had seen often at the theatre, walking on to the stage from  nowhere, without a word catching the heroine in his arms, and after one  long, tremendous look, carrying her off to anywhere...    Reggie bowed to his vision. \"Yes, I see,\" he said huskily.    \"Do you?\" said Anne. \"Oh, I do hope you do. Because I feel so horrid  about it. It's so hard to explain. You know I've never--\" She stopped.  Reggie looked at her. She was smiling. \"Isn't it funny?\" she said.  \"I can say anything to you. I always have been able to from the very  beginning.\"    He tried to smile, to say \"I'm glad.\" She went on. \"I've never known any  one I like as much as I like you. I've never felt so happy with any one.  But I'm sure it's not what people and what books mean when they talk  about love. Do you understand? Oh, if you only knew how horrid I feel.  But we'd be like... like Mr. and Mrs. Dove.\"    That did it. That seemed to Reginald final, and so terribly true that he  could hardly bear it. \"Don't drive it home,\" he said, and he turned away  from Anne and looked across the lawn. There was the gardener's cottage,  with the dark ilex-tree beside it. A wet, blue thumb of transparent  smoke hung above the chimney. It didn't look real. How his throat  ached! Could he speak? He had a shot. \"I must be getting along home,\" he  croaked, and he began walking across the lawn. But Anne ran after him.  \"No, don't. You can't go yet,\" she said imploringly. \"You can't possibly  go away feeling like that.\" And she stared up at him frowning, biting  her lip.    \"Oh, that's all right,\" said Reggie, giving himself a shake. \"I'll...  I'll--\" And he waved his hand as much to say \"get over it.\"    \"But this is awful,\" said Anne. She clasped her hands and stood in front  of him. \"Surely you do see how fatal it would be for us to marry, don't  you?\"    \"Oh, quite, quite,\" said Reggie, looking at her with haggard eyes.    \"How wrong, how wicked, feeling as I do. I mean, it's all very well for  Mr. and Mrs. Dove. But imagine that in real life--imagine it!\"    \"Oh, absolutely,\" said Reggie, and he started to walk on. But again Anne  stopped him. She tugged at his sleeve, and to his astonishment, this  time, instead of laughing, she looked like a little girl who was going  to cry.    \"Then why, if you understand, are you so un-unhappy?\" she wailed. \"Why  do you mind so fearfully? Why do you look so aw-awful?\"    Reggie gulped, and again he waved something away. \"I can't help it,\" he  said, \"I've had a blow. If I cut off now, I'll be able to--\"    \"How can you talk of cutting off now?\" said Anne scornfully. She stamped  her foot at Reggie; she was crimson. \"How can you be so cruel? I can't  let you go until I know for certain that you are just as happy as you  were before you asked me to marry you. Surely you must see that, it's so  simple.\"    But it did not seem at all simple to Reginald. It seemed impossibly  difficult.    \"Even if I can't marry you, how can I know that you're all that  way away, with only that awful mother to write to, and that you're  miserable, and that it's all my fault?\"    \"It's not your fault. Don't think that. It's just fate.\" Reggie took her  hand off his sleeve and kissed it. \"Don't pity me, dear little Anne,\" he  said gently. And this time he nearly ran, under the pink arches, along  the garden path.    \"Roo-coo-coo-coo! Roo-coo-coo-coo!\" sounded from the veranda. \"Reggie,  Reggie,\" from the garden.    He stopped, he turned. But when she saw his timid, puzzled look, she  gave a little laugh.    \"Come back, Mr. Dove,\" said Anne. And Reginald came slowly across the  lawn.          5. THE YOUNG GIRL.    In her blue dress, with her cheeks lightly flushed, her blue, blue eyes,  and her gold curls pinned up as though for the first time--pinned up  to be out of the way for her flight--Mrs. Raddick's daughter might have  just dropped from this radiant heaven. Mrs. Raddick's timid, faintly  astonished, but deeply admiring glance looked as if she believed it,  too; but the daughter didn't appear any too pleased--why should she?--to  have alighted on the steps of the Casino. Indeed, she was bored--bored  as though Heaven had been full of casinos with snuffy old saints for  croupiers and crowns to play with.    \"You don't mind taking Hennie?\" said Mrs. Raddick. \"Sure you don't?  There's the car, and you'll have tea and we'll be back here on this  step--right here--in an hour. You see, I want her to go in. She's not  been before, and it's worth seeing. I feel it wouldn't be fair to her.\"    \"Oh, shut up, mother,\" said she wearily. \"Come along. Don't talk so  much. And your bag's open; you'll be losing all your money again.\"    \"I'm sorry, darling,\" said Mrs. Raddick.    \"Oh, do come in! I want to make money,\" said the impatient voice. \"It's  all jolly well for you--but I'm broke!\"    \"Here--take fifty francs, darling, take a hundred!\" I saw Mrs. Raddick  pressing notes into her hand as they passed through the swing doors.    Hennie and I stood on the steps a minute, watching the people. He had a  very broad, delighted smile.    \"I say,\" he cried, \"there's an English bulldog. Are they allowed to take  dogs in there?\"    \"No, they're not.\"    \"He's a ripping chap, isn't he? I wish I had one. They're such fun. They  frighten people so, and they're never fierce with their--the people they  belong to.\" Suddenly he squeezed my arm. \"I say, do look at that old  woman. Who is she? Why does she look like that? Is she a gambler?\"    The ancient, withered creature, wearing a green satin dress, a black  velvet cloak and a white hat with purple feathers, jerked slowly, slowly  up the steps as though she were being drawn up on wires. She stared in  front of her, she was laughing and nodding and cackling to herself; her  claws clutched round what looked like a dirty boot-bag.    But just at that moment there was Mrs. Raddick again with--her--and  another lady hovering in the background. Mrs. Raddick rushed at me. She  was brightly flushed, gay, a different creature. She was like a woman  who is saying \"good-bye\" to her friends on the station platform, with  not a minute to spare before the train starts.    \"Oh, you're here, still. Isn't that lucky! You've not gone. Isn't that  fine! I've had the most dreadful time with--her,\" and she waved to  her daughter, who stood absolutely still, disdainful, looking down,  twiddling her foot on the step, miles away. \"They won't let her in. I  swore she was twenty-one. But they won't believe me. I showed the man  my purse; I didn't dare to do more. But it was no use. He simply  scoffed... And now I've just met Mrs. MacEwen from New York, and she just  won thirteen thousand in the Salle Privee--and she wants me to go back  with her while the luck lasts. Of course I can't leave--her. But if  you'd--\"    At that \"she\" looked up; she simply withered her mother. \"Why can't  you leave me?\" she said furiously. \"What utter rot! How dare you make  a scene like this? This is the last time I'll come out with you. You  really are too awful for words.\" She looked her mother up and down.  \"Calm yourself,\" she said superbly.    Mrs. Raddick was desperate, just desperate. She was \"wild\" to go back  with Mrs. MacEwen, but at the same time...    I seized my courage. \"Would you--do you care to come to tea with--us?\"    \"Yes, yes, she'll be delighted. That's just what I wanted, isn't it,  darling? Mrs. MacEwen... I'll be back here in an hour... or less... I'll--\"    Mrs. R. dashed up the steps. I saw her bag was open again.    So we three were left. But really it wasn't my fault. Hennie looked  crushed to the earth, too. When the car was there she wrapped her dark  coat round her--to escape contamination. Even her little feet looked as  though they scorned to carry her down the steps to us.    \"I am so awfully sorry,\" I murmured as the car started.    \"Oh, I don't mind,\" said she. \"I don't want to look twenty-one.

The crew of the _Trinidad_ were seized and made  prisoners, and ultimately only four of them reached Spain again,  after many adventures. Thirteen others, who had landed at the Cape  de Verde Islands from the _Victoria_, may also be included among  the survivors of the fleet, so that a total number of thirty-five  out of two hundred and seventy sums up the number of the first  circumnavigators of the globe.    The importance of this voyage was unique when regarded from the  point of view of geographical discovery. It decisively clinched  the matter with regard to the existence of an entirely New World  independent from Asia. In particular, the backward voyage of the  _Trinidad_ (which has rarely been noticed) had shown that there  was a wide expanse of ocean north of the line and east of Asia,  whilst the previous voyage had shown the enormous extent of sea  south of the line. After the circumnavigation of the _Victoria_  it was clear to cosmographers that the world was much larger than  had been imagined by the ancients; or rather, perhaps one may say  that Asia was smaller than had been thought by the mediaeval writers.  The dogged persistence shown by Magelhaens in carrying out his  idea, which turned out to be a perfectly justifiable one, raises  him from this point of view to a greater height than Columbus,  whose month's voyage brought him exactly where he thought he would  find land according to Toscanelli's map. After Magelhaens, as will  be seen, the whole coast lines of the world were roughly known,  except for the Arctic Circle and for Australia.    [Illustration: THE WORLD ACCORDING TO PTOLEMY OF 1548.]    The Emperor was naturally delighted with the result of the voyage.  He granted Del Cano a pension, and a coat of arms commemorating  his services. The terms of the grant are very significant: _or_,  two cinnamon sticks _saltire proper_, three nutmegs and twelve  cloves, a chief _gules_, a castle _or; crest_, a globe, bearing  the motto, \"Primus circumdedisti me\" (thou wert the first to go  round me); _supporters_, two Malay kings crowned, holding in the  exterior hand a spice branch proper. The castle, of course, refers  to Castile, but the rest of the blazon indicates the importance  attributed to the voyage as resting mainly upon the visit to the  Spice Islands. As we have already seen, however, the Portuguese  recovered their position in the Moluccas immediately after the  departure of the _Victoria_, and seven years later Charles V. gave  up any claims he might possess through Magelhaens' visit.    But for a long time afterwards the Spaniards still cast longing  eyes upon the Spice Islands, and the Fuggers, the great bankers  of Augsburg, who financed the Spanish monarch, for a long time  attempted to get possession of Peru, with the scarcely disguised  object of making it a \"jumping-place\" from which to make a fresh  attempt at obtaining possession of the Moluccas. A modern parallel  will doubtless occur to the reader.    There are thus three stages to be distinguished in the successive  discovery and delimitation of the New World:--    (i.) At first Columbus imagined that he had actually reached Zipangu  or Japan, and achieved the object of his voyage.    (ii.) Then Amerigo Vespucci, by coasting down South America, ascertained  that there was a huge unknown land intervening even between Columbus'  discoveries and the long-desired Spice Islands.    (iii.) Magelhaens clinches this view by traversing the Southern  Pacific for thousands of miles before reaching the Moluccas.    There is still a fourth stage by which it was gradually discovered  that the North-west of America was not joined on to Asia, but this  stage was only gradually reached and finally determined by the  voyages of Behring and Cook.    [_Authorities:_ Justin Winsor, _Christopher Columbus_, 1894; Guillemard,  _Ferdinand Magellan_, 1894.]          CHAPTER VIII    TO THE INDIES NORTHWARD--ENGLISH, FRENCH, DUTCH, AND RUSSIAN ROUTES    The discovery of the New World had the most important consequences  on the relative importance of the different nations of Europe.  Hitherto the chief centres for over two thousand years had been  round the shores of the Mediterranean, and, as we have seen, Venice,  by her central position and extensive trade to the East, had become  a world-centre during the latter Middle Ages. But after Columbus,  and still more after Magelhaens, the European nations on the Atlantic  were found to be closer to the New World, and, in a measure, closer  to the Spice Islands, which they could reach all the way by ship,  instead of having to pay expensive land freights. The trade routes  through Germany became at once neglected, and it is only in the  present century that she has at all recovered from the blow given  to her by the discovery of the new sea routes in which she could  not join. But to England, France, and the Low Countries the new  outlook promised a share in the world's trade and affairs generally,  which they had never hitherto possessed while the Mediterranean  was the centre of commerce. If the Indies could be reached by sea,  they were almost in as fortunate a position as Portugal or Spain.  Almost as soon as the new routes were discovered the Northern nations  attempted to utilise them, notwithstanding the Bull of Partition,  which the French king laughed at, and the Protestant English and  Dutch had no reason to respect. Within three years of the return  of Columbus from his first voyage, Henry VII. employed John Cabot,  a Venetian settled in Bristol, with his three sons, to attempt  the voyage to the Indies by the North-West Passage. He appears to  have re-discovered Newfoundland in 1497, and then in the following  year, failing to find a passage there, coasted down North America  nearly as far as Florida.    In 1534 Jacques Cartier examined the river St. Lawrence, and his  discoveries were later followed up by Samuel de Champlain, who  explored some of the great lakes near the St. Lawrence, and established  the French rule in Canada, or Acadie, as it was then called.    Meanwhile the English had made an attempt to reach the Indies,  still by a northern passage, but this time in an easterly direction.  Sebastian Cabot, who had been appointed Grand Pilot of England by  Edward VI., directed a voyage of exploration in 1553, under Sir  Hugh Willoughby. Only one of these ships, with the pilot (Richard  Chancellor) on board, survived the voyage, reaching Archangel, and  then going overland to Moscow, where he was favourably received  by the Czar of Russia, Ivan the Terrible. He was, however, drowned  on his return, and no further attempt to reach Cathay by sea was  attempted.    The North-West Passage seemed thus to promise better than that by  the North-East, and in 1576 Martin Frobisher started on an exploring  voyage, after having had the honour of a wave of Elizabeth's hand  as he passed Greenwich. He reached Greenland, and then Labrador,  and, in a subsequent voyage next year, discovered the strait named  after him. His project was taken up by Sir Humphrey Gilbert, on  whom, with his brother Adrian, Elizabeth conferred the privilege of  making the passage to China and the Moluccas by the north-westward,  north-eastward, or northward route. At the same time a patent was  granted him for discovering any lands unsettled by Christian princes.  A settlement was made in St. John's, Newfoundland, but on the return  voyage, near the Azores, Sir Humphrey's \"frigate\" (a small boat  of ten men), disappeared, after he had been heard to call out,  \"Courage, my lads; we are as near heaven by sea as by land!\" This  happened in 1583.    Two years after, another expedition was sent out by the merchants  of London, under John Davis, who, on this and two subsequent voyages,  discovered several passages trending westward, which warranted  the hope of finding a northwest passage. Beside the strait named  after him, it is probable that on his third voyage, in 1587, he  passed through the passage now named after Hudson. His discoveries  were not followed up for some twenty years, when Henry Hudson was  despatched in 1607 with a crew of ten men and a boy. He reached  Spitzbergen, and reached 80 deg. N., and in the following year reached  the North (Magnetic) Pole, which was then situated at 75.22 deg. N. Two  of his men were also fortunate enough to see a mermaid--probably  an Eskimo woman in her _kayak_. In a third voyage, in 1609, he  discovered the strait and bay which now bear his name, but was  marooned by his crew, and never heard of further. He had previously,  for a time, passed into the service of the Dutch, and had guided  them to the river named after him, on which New York now stands. The  course of English discovery in the north was for a time concluded  by the voyage of William Baffin in 1615, which resulted in the  discovery of the land named after him, as well as many of the islands  to the north of America.    Meanwhile the Dutch had taken part in the work of discovery towards  the north. They had revolted against the despotism of Philip II., who  was now monarch of both Spain and Portugal. At first they attempted  to adopt a route which would not bring them into collision with  their old masters; and in three voyages, between 1594 and 1597,  William Barentz attempted the North-East Passage, under the auspices  of the States-General. He discovered Cherry Island, and touched  on Spitzbergen, but failed in the main object of his search; and  the attention of the Dutch was henceforth directed to seizing the  Portuguese route, rather than finding a new one for themselves.    The reason they were able to do this is a curious instance of Nemesis  in history. Owing to the careful series of intermarriages planned  out by Ferdinand of Arragon, the Portuguese Crown and all its  possessions became joined to Spain in 1580 under Philip II., just  a year after "]]]
