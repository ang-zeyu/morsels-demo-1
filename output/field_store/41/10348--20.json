[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/164"],[0,"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea (#17)"],[1,"are covered with a case of steel,  and weighted with a pellet of lead; they are real Leyden bottles, into  which the electricity is forced to a very high tension.  With the  slightest shock they are discharged, and the animal, however strong it  may be, falls dead.  I must tell you that these cases are size number  four, and that the charge for an ordinary gun would be ten.\"    \"I will argue no longer,\" I replied, rising from the table.  \"I have  nothing left me but to take my gun.  At all events, I will go where you  go.\"    Captain Nemo then led me aft; and in passing before Ned's and Conseil's  cabin, I called my two companions, who followed promptly.  We then came  to a cell near the machinery-room, in which we put on our walking-dress.        CHAPTER XV    A WALK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA    This cell was, to speak correctly, the arsenal and wardrobe of the  Nautilus.  A dozen diving apparatuses hung from the partition waiting  our use.    Ned Land, on seeing them, showed evident repugnance to dress himself in  one.    \"But, my worthy Ned, the forests of the Island of Crespo are nothing  but submarine forests.\"    \"Good!\" said the disappointed harpooner, who saw his dreams of fresh  meat fade away.  \"And you, M. Aronnax, are you going to dress yourself  in those clothes?\"    \"There is no alternative, Master Ned.\"    \"As you please, sir,\" replied the harpooner, shrugging his shoulders;  \"but, as for me, unless I am forced, I will never get into one.\"    \"No one will force you, Master Ned,\" said Captain Nemo.    \"Is Conseil going to risk it?\" asked Ned.    \"I follow my master wherever he goes,\" replied Conseil.    At the Captain's call two of the ship's crew came to help us dress in  these heavy and impervious clothes, made of india-rubber without seam,  and constructed expressly to resist considerable pressure.  One would  have thought it a suit of armour, both supple and resisting.  This suit  formed trousers and waistcoat.  The trousers were finished off with  thick boots, weighted with heavy leaden soles.  The texture of the  waistcoat was held together by bands of copper, which crossed the  chest, protecting it from the great pressure of the water, and leaving  the lungs free to act; the sleeves ended in gloves, which in no way  restrained the movement of the hands.  There was a vast difference  noticeable between these consummate apparatuses and the old cork  breastplates, jackets, and other contrivances in vogue during the  eighteenth century.    Captain Nemo and one of his companions (a sort of Hercules, who must  have possessed great strength), Conseil and myself were soon enveloped  in the dresses.  There remained nothing more to be done but to enclose  our heads in the metal box.  But, before proceeding to this operation,  I asked the Captain's permission to examine the guns.    One of the Nautilus men gave me a simple gun, the butt end of which,  made of steel, hollow in the centre, was rather large.  It served as a  reservoir for compressed air, which a valve, worked by a spring,  allowed to escape into a metal tube.  A box of projectiles in a groove  in the thickness of the butt end contained about twenty of these  electric balls, which, by means of a spring, were forced into the  barrel of the gun.  As soon as one shot was fired, another was ready.    \"Captain Nemo,\" said I, \"this arm is perfect, and easily handled: I  only ask to be allowed to try it.  But how shall we gain the bottom of  the sea?\"    \"At this moment, Professor, the Nautilus is stranded in five fathoms,  and we have nothing to do but to start.\"    \"But how shall we get off?\"    \"You shall see.\"    Captain Nemo thrust his head into the helmet, Conseil and I did the  same, not without hearing an ironical \"Good sport!\" from the Canadian.  The upper part of our dress terminated in a copper collar upon which  was screwed the metal helmet.  Three holes, protected by thick glass,  allowed us to see in all directions, by simply turning our head in the  interior of the head-dress. As soon as it was in position, the  Rouquayrol apparatus on our backs began to act; and, for my part, I  could breathe with ease.    With the Ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt, and the gun in my hand, I  was ready to set out.  But to speak the truth, imprisoned in these  heavy garments, and glued to the deck by my leaden soles, it was  impossible for me to take a step.    But this state of things was provided for.  I felt myself being pushed  into a little room contiguous to the wardrobe room.  My companions  followed, towed along in the same way.  I heard a water-tight door,  furnished with stopper plates, close upon us, and we were wrapped in  profound darkness.    After some minutes, a loud hissing was heard.  I felt the cold mount  from my feet to my chest.  Evidently from some part of the vessel they  had, by means of a tap, given entrance to the water, which was invading  us, and with which the room was soon filled.  A second door cut in the  side of the Nautilus then opened.  We saw a faint light.  In another  instant our feet trod the bottom of the sea.    And now, how can I retrace the impression left upon me by that walk  under the waters?  Words are impotent to relate such wonders!  Captain  Nemo walked in front, his companion followed some steps behind.  Conseil and I remained near each other, as if an exchange of words had  been possible through our metallic cases.  I no longer felt the weight  of my clothing, or of my shoes, of my reservoir of air, or my thick  helmet, in the midst of which my head rattled like an almond in its  shell.    The light, which lit the soil thirty feet below the surface of the  ocean, astonished me by its power.  The solar rays shone through the  watery mass easily, and dissipated all colour, and I clearly  distinguished objects at a distance of a hundred and fifty yards.  Beyond that the tints darkened into fine gradations of ultramarine, and  faded into vague obscurity.  Truly this water which surrounded me was  but another air denser than the terrestrial atmosphere, but almost as  transparent.  Above me was the calm surface of the sea.  We were  walking on fine, even sand, not wrinkled, as on a flat shore, which  retains the impression of the billows.  This dazzling carpet, really a  reflector, repelled the rays of the sun with wonderful intensity, which  accounted for the vibration which penetrated every atom of liquid.  Shall I be believed when I say that, at the depth of thirty feet, I  could see as if I was in broad daylight?    For a quarter of an hour I trod on this sand, sown with the impalpable  dust of shells.  The hull of the Nautilus, resembling a long shoal,  disappeared by degrees; but its lantern, when darkness should overtake  us in the waters, would help to guide us on board by its distinct rays.    Soon forms of objects outlined in the distance were discernible.  I  recognised magnificent rocks, hung with a tapestry of zoophytes of the  most beautiful kind, and I was at first struck by the peculiar effect  of this medium.    It was then ten in the morning; the rays of the sun struck the surface  of the waves at rather an oblique angle, and at the touch of their  light, decomposed by refraction as through a prism, flowers, rocks,  plants, shells, and polypi were shaded at the edges by the seven solar  colours.  It was marvellous, a feast for the eyes, this complication of  coloured tints, a perfect kaleidoscope of green, yellow, orange,  violet, indigo, and blue; in one word, the whole palette of an  enthusiastic colourist!  Why could I not communicate to Conseil the  lively sensations which were mounting to my brain, and rival him in  expressions of admiration?  For aught I knew, Captain Nemo and his  companion might be able to exchange thoughts by means of signs  previously agreed upon.  So, for want of better, I talked to myself; I  declaimed in the copper box which covered my head, thereby expending  more air in vain words than was perhaps wise.    Various kinds of isis, clusters of pure tuft-coral, prickly fungi, and  anemones formed a brilliant garden of flowers, decked with their  collarettes of blue tentacles, sea-stars studding the sandy bottom.  It  was a real grief to me to crush under my feet the brilliant specimens  of molluscs which strewed the ground by thousands, of hammerheads,  donaciae (veritable bounding shells), of staircases, and red  helmet-shells, angel-wings, and many others produced by this  inexhaustible ocean.  But we were bound to walk, so we went on, whilst  above our heads waved medusae whose umbrellas of opal or rose-pink,  escalloped with a band of blue, sheltered us from the rays of the sun  and fiery pelagiae, which, in the darkness, would have strewn our path  with phosphorescent light.    All these wonders I saw in the space of a quarter of a mile, scarcely  stopping, and following Captain Nemo, who beckoned me on by signs.  Soon the nature of the soil changed; to the sandy plain succeeded an  extent of slimy mud which the Americans call \"ooze,\" composed of equal  parts of silicious and calcareous shells.  We then travelled over a  plain of seaweed of wild and luxuriant vegetation.  This sward was of  close texture, and soft to the feet, and rivalled the softest carpet  woven by the hand of man.  But whilst verdure was spread at our feet,  it did not abandon our heads.  A light network of marine plants, of  that inexhaustible family of seaweeds of which more than two thousand  kinds are known, grew on the surface of the water.    I noticed that the green plants kept nearer the top of the sea, whilst  the red were at a greater depth, leaving to the black or brown the care  of forming gardens and parterres in the remote beds of the ocean.    We had quitted the Nautilus about an hour and a half.  It was near  noon; I knew by the perpendicularity of the sun's rays, which were no  longer refracted.  The magical colours disappeared by degrees, and the  shades"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410"],[0,"The Life-Story of Insects (#17)"],[1,"by the fossils entombed in them, are arranged in 'descending'  order, the more recent formations above, the more ancient below, as  newer deposits necessarily lie over older beds.
