For I perceive  them to be born of the foes of the Burg.\"    Now the townsmen had let their talk drop a while to listen to the talk  of the aliens; and Roger answered still in a loud voice: \"Nay, nay, it  is not so.  These queens are indeed war-taken thralls, but not from  them of the Dry Tree, or they would have been slain at once, like as  the carles of those accursed ones.  But these are of the folk of the  Wheat-wearers, even as those whom thou sawest brought to-day amidst the  other spoil.  And to this folk the Burg showeth mercy, and whenso the  host goeth against them and over-cometh (and that is well-nigh whenever  they meet) these worthy lords slay no woman of them, but the men only,  whether they be old or young or youngest.  As for their women they are  brought hither and sold at the market-cross to the highest bidder.  And  this honour they have, that such of them as be fair, and that is the  more part of the younger ones, fetch no ill penny.  Yet for my part I  were loth to cheapen such wares:  for they make but evil servants,  being proud, and not abiding stripes lightly, or toiling the harder for  them; and they be somewhat too handy with the knife if they deem  themselves put upon.  Speak I sooth, my masters?\" quoth he, turning  toward them of the town.    Said a burgher somewhat stricken in years, \"Nought but sooth; peaceable  men like to me eschew such servants; all the more because of this, that  if one of these queens misbehave with the knife, or strayeth from her  master's bed, the laws of the Burg meddle not therein.  For the wise  men say that such folk are no more within the law than kine be, and may  not for their deeds be brought before leet or assize any more than  kine.  So that if the master punish her not for her misdoings,  unpunished she needs must go; yea even if her deed be mere murder.\"    \"That is sooth,\" said a somewhat younger man; \"yet whiles it fareth ill  with them at the hands of our women.  To wit, my father's brother has  even now come from the war to find his thrall all spoilt by his wife:  and what remedy may he have against his wife? his money is gone, even  as if she had houghed his horse or his best cow.\"    \"Yea,\" said a third, \"we were better without such cattle.  A thrust  with a sword and all the tale told, were the better way of dealing with  them.\"    Said another; \"Yet are the queens good websters, and, lacking them,  figured cloth of silk would be far-fetched and dear-bought here.\"    A young man gaily clad, who had been eyeing the speakers disdainfully,  spake next and said:  \"Fair sirs, ye are speaking like hypocrites, and  as if your lawful wives were here to hearken to you; whereas ye know  well how goodly these thralls be, and that many of them can be kind  enough withal; and ye would think yourselves but ill bestead if ye  might not cheapen such jewels for your money.  Which of you will go to  the Cross next Saturday and there buy him a fairer wife than he can wed  out of our lineages? and a wife withal of whose humours he need take no  more account of than the dullness of his hound or the skittish temper  of his mare, so long as the thong smarts, and the twigs sting.\"    One or two grinned as he spake, but some bent their brows at him, yet  scarce in earnest, and the talk thereover dropped, nor did Ralph ask  any more questions; for he was somewhat down-hearted, calling to mind  the frank and free maidens of Upmead, and their friendly words and  hearty kisses.  And him seemed the world was worse than he had looked  to find it.    Howsoever, the oldest and soberest of the guests, seeing that he was a  stranger and of noble aspect, came unto him and sat by him, and fell to  telling him tales of the wars of the men of the Burg with the  Wheat-wearers; and how in time past, when the town was but little  fenced, the Wheat-wearers had stormed their gates and taken the city,  and had made a great slaughter; but yet had spared many of the  fighting-men, although they had abided there as the masters of them,  and held them enthralled for three generations of men: after which time  the sons' sons of the old Burg-dwellers having grown very many again,  and divers of them being trusted in sundry matters by the conquerors,  who oppressed them but little, rose up against them as occasion served,  in the winter season and the Yule feast, and slew their masters, save  for a few who were hidden away.    \"And thereafter,\" quoth he, \"did we make the Burg strong and hard to  win, as ye see it to-day; and we took for our captain the Forest Lord,  who ere-while had dwelt in the clearings of the wildwood, and he wedded  the Fair Lady who was the son's daughter of him who had been our lord  ere the Wheat-wearers overcame us; and we grew safe and free and mighty  again.  And the son of the Forest Lord, he whom we call the War-smith,  he it was who beheld the Burg too much given to pleasure, and  delighting in the softness of life; and he took order to harden our  hearts, and to cause all freemen to learn the craft of war and battle,  and let the women and thralls and aliens see to other craftsmanship and  to chaffer; and even so is it done as he would; and ye shall find us  hardy of heart enough, though belike not so joyous as might be.  Yet at  least we shall not be easy to overcome.\"    \"So indeed it seemeth,\" said Ralph.  \"Yet will I ask of you first one  question, and then another.\"    \"Ask on,\" said the burgher.    Said Ralph:  \"How is it that ye, being so strong, should still suffer  them of the Dry Tree, taking a man here and a man there, when ye might  destroy them utterly?\"    The Burgher reddened and cleared his throat and said: \"Sir, it must be  made clear to you that these evil beasts are no peril to the Burg of  the Four Friths; all the harm they may do us, is as when a cur dog  biteth a man in the calf of the leg; whereby the man shall be grieved  indeed, but the dog slain.  Such grief as that they have done us at  whiles:  but the grief is paid for thus, that the hunting and slaying  of them keeps our men in good trim, and pleasures them; shortly to say  it, they are the chief deer wherewith our wood is stocked.\"    He stopped awhile and then went on again and said:  \"To say sooth they  be not very handy for crushing as a man crushes a wasp, because sorcery  goes with them, and the wiles of one who is their Queen, the evilest  woman who ever spat upon the blessed Host of the Altar: yet is she  strong, a devouring sea of souls, God help us!\" And he blessed himself  therewith.    Said Ralph:  \"Yet a word on these Wheat-wearers; it seemeth that ye  never fail to overcome them in battle?\"    \"But seldom at least,\" quoth the Burgher.    Said Ralph:  \"Then it were no great matter for you to gather a host  overwhelming, and to take their towns and castles, and forbid them  weapons, and make them your thralls to till the land for you which now  they call theirs; so that ye might have of their gettings all save what  were needful for them to live as thralls.\"    \"I deem it were an easy thing,\" said the burgher.    Quoth Ralph:  \"Then why do ye not so?\"    \"It were but a poor game to play,\" said the burgher.  \"Such of their  wealth as we have a mind to, we can have now at the cost of a battle or  two, begun one hour and ended the next: were we their masters sitting  down amidst of their hatred, and amidst of their plotting, yea, and in  the very place where that were the hottest and thickest, the battle  would be to begin at every sun's uprising, nor would it be ended at any  sunset.  Hah! what sayest thou?\"    Said Ralph:  \"This seemeth to me but the bare truth; yet it is little  after the manner of such masterful men as ye be.  But why then do ye  slay all their carles that are taken; whereas ye bear away the women  and make thralls of them at home, that is to say, foes in every house?\"    \"It may be,\" said the Burgher, \"that this is not amongst the wisest of  our dealings.  Yet may we do no otherwise; for thus we swore to do by  all the greatest oaths that we might swear, in the days when we first  cast off their yoke, and yet were not over strong at the first; and now  it hath so grown into a part of our manners, yea, and of our very  hearts and minds, that the slaying of a Wheat-wearer is to us a lighter  matter than the smiting of a rabbit or a fowmart.  But now, look you,  fair sir, my company ariseth from table; so I bid thee a good night.  And I give thee a good rede along with the good wish, to wit, that thou  ask not too many questions in this city concerning its foemen: for here  is the stranger looked upon with doubt, if he neither will take the  wages of the Burg for battle, nor hath aught to sell.\"    Ralph reddened at his word, and the other looked at him steadily as he  spoke, so that Ralph deemed that he mistrusted him: he deemed moreover  that three or four of the others looked hard at him as they went  towards the door, while Roger stood somewhat smiling, and humming a  snatch of an old song.    But when the other guests had left the hostelry, Roger left his  singing, and turned to Ralph and said:  \"Master, meseems that they  mistrust us, and now maybe is that peril that I spake of nigher than I  deemed when we came into the Burg this morning.  And now I would that  we were well out of the Burg and in the merry greenwood again, and it  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16921"],[0,"Plague Ship (#17)"],[1,"slowly.    \"We've been _what?_\" Dane demanded.    \"Look here, we three--with Weeks--drank that brew of the Salariki, didn't  we? And we--\"    \"Were as sick as Venusian gobblers afterwards,\" agreed Rip.    Light dawned. \"Do you mean--\" began Dane.    \"So that's it!\" flashed Rip.    \"It might just be,\" Ali said. \"Do you remember how the settlers on  Camblyne brought their Terran cattle through the first year? They fed  them salt mixed with fansel grass. The result was that the herds didn't  take the fansel grass fever when they turned them out to pasture in the  dry season. All right, maybe we had our 'salt' in that drink. The  fansel-salt makes the cattle filthy sick when it's forced down their  throats, but after they recover they're immune to the fever. And nobody  on Camblyne buys unsalted cattle now.\"    \"It sounds logical,\" admitted Rip. \"But how are we going to prove it?\"    Ali's face was black once more. \"Probably by elimination,\" he said  morosely. \"If we keep our feet and all the rest go down--that's our  proof.\"    \"But we ought to be able to do something--\" protested Shannon.    \"Just how?\" Ali's slender brows arched. \"Do you have a gallon of that  Salariki brew on board you can serve out? We don't know what was in it.  Nor are we sure that this whole idea has any value.\"    All of them had had first aid and basic preventive medicine as part of  their training, but the more advanced laboratory experimentation was  beyond their knowledge and skill. Had Tau still been on his feet perhaps  he could have traced that lead and brought order out of the chaos which  was closing in upon the Solar Queen. But, though they reported their  suggestion to the Captain, Jellico was powerless to do anything about it.  If the four who had shared that upsetting friendship cup were immune to  the doom which now overhung the ship, there was no possible way for them  to discover why or how.    Ship's time came to have little meaning. And they were not surprised when  Steen Wilcox slipped from his seat before the computer--to be stowed away  with what had become a familiar procedure. Only Jellico withstood the  contagion apart from the younger four, taking his turn at caring for the  helpless men. There was no change in their condition. They neither roused  nor grew worse as the hours and then the days sped by. But each of those  units of time in passing brought them nearer to greater danger. Sooner or  later they must make the transition out of Hyper into system space, and  the jump out of warp was something not even a veteran took lightly. Rip's  round face thinned while they watched. Jellico was still functioning. But  if the Captain collapsed the whole responsibility for the snap-out would  fall directly on Shannon. An infinitesimal error would condemn them to  almost hopeless wandering--perhaps for ever.    Dane and Ali relieved Rip of all duty but that which kept him chained in  Wilcox's chair before the computers. He went over and over the data of  the course the Astrogator had set. And Captain Jellico, his eyes sunk in  dark pits, checked and rechecked.    When the fatal moment came Ali manned the engine room with Weeks at his  elbow to tend the controls the acting-Engineer could not reach. And Dane,  having seen the sick all safely stowed in crash webbing, came up to the  control cabin, riding out the transfer in Tang Ya's place.    Rip's voice hoarsened into a croak, calling out the data. Dane, though he  had had basic theory, was completely lost before Shannon had finished the  first set of co-ordinates. But Jellico replied, hands playing across the  pilot's board.    \"Stand-by for snap-out--\" the croak went down to the engines where Ali  now held Stotz's post.    \"Engines ready!\" The voice came back, thinned by its journey from the  Queen's interior.    \"Ought-five-nine--\" That was Jellico.    Dane found himself suddenly unable to watch. He shut his eyes and braced  himself against the vertigo of snap-out. It came and he whirled  sickeningly through unstable space. Then he was sitting in the laced  Com-tech's seat looking at Rip.    Runnels of sweat streaked Shannon's brown face. There was a damp patch  darkening his tunic between his shoulder blades, a patch which it would  take both of Dane's hands to cover.    For a moment he did not raise his head to look at the vision plate which  would tell him whether or not they had made it. But when he did familiar  constellations made the patterns they knew. They were out--and they  couldn't be too far off the course Wilcox had plotted. There was still  the system run to make--but snap-out was behind them. Rip gave a deep  sigh and buried his head in his hands.    With a throb of fear Dane unhooked his safety belt and hurried over to  him. When he clutched at Shannon's shoulder the Astrogator-apprentice's  head rolled limply. Was Rip down with the illness too? But the other  muttered and opened his eyes.    \"Does your head ache?\" Dane shook him.    \"Head? No--\" Rip's words came drowsily. \"Jus' sleepy--so sleepy--\"    He did not seem to be in pain. But Dane's hands were shaking as he  hoisted the other out of his seat and half carried-half led him to his  cabin, praying as he went that it was only fatigue and not the disease.  The ship was on auto now until Jellico as pilot set a course--    Dane got Rip down on the bunk and stripped off his tunic. The fine-drawn  face of the sleeper looked wan against the foam rest, and he snuggled  into the softness like a child as he turned over and curled up. But his  skin was clear--it was real sleep and not the plague which had claimed  him.    Impulse sent Dane back to the control cabin. He was not an experienced  pilot officer, but there might be some assistance he could offer the  Captain now that Rip was washed out, perhaps for hours.    Jellico hunched before the smaller computer, feeding pilot tape into its  slot. His face was a skull under a thin coating of skin, the bones  marking it sharply at jaw, nose and eye socket.    \"Shannon down?\" His voice was a mere whisper of its powerful self, he did  not turn his head.    \"He's just worn out, sir,\" Dane hastened to give reassurance. \"The marks  aren't on him.\"    \"When he comes around tell him the co-ords are in,\" Jellico murmured.  \"See he checks course in ten hours--\"    \"But, sir--\" Dane's protest failed as he watched the Captain struggle to  his feet, pulling himself up with shaking hands. As Thorson reached  forward to steady the other, one of those hands tore at tunic collar,  ripping loose the sealing--    There was no need for explanation--the red splotch signaled from  Jellico's sweating throat. He kept his feet, holding out against the  waves of pain by sheer will power. Then Dane had a grip on him, got him  away from the computer, hoping he could keep him going until they reached  Jellico's cabin.    Somehow they made that journey, being greeted with raucous screams from  the Hoobat. Furiously Dane slapped the cage, setting it to swinging and  so silencing the creature which stared at him with round, malignant eyes  as he got the Captain to bed.    Only four of them on their feet now, Dane thought bleakly as he left the  cabin. If Rip came out of it in time they could land--Dane's breath  caught as he made himself face up to the fact that Shannon might be ill,  that it might be up to him to bring the Queen in for a landing. And in  where? The Terra quarantine was Luna City on the Moon. But let them  signal for a set-down there--let them describe what had happened and they  might face death as a plague ship.    Wearily he climbed down to the mess cabin to discover Weeks and Ali there  before him. They did not look up as he entered.    \"Old Man's got it,\" he reported.    \"Rip?\" was Ali's crossing question.    \"Asleep. He passed out--\"    \"What!\" Weeks swung around.    \"Worn out,\" Dane amended. \"Captain fed in a pilot tape before he gave  up.\"    \"So--now we are three,\" was Ali's comment. \"Where do we set down--Luna  City?\"    \"If they let us,\" Dane hinted at the worst.    \"But they've got to let us!\" Weeks exclaimed. \"We can't just wander  around out here--\"    \"It's been done,\" Ali reminded them brutally and that silenced Weeks.    \"Did the Old Man set Luna?\" After a long pause Ali inquired.    \"I didn't check,\" Dane confessed. \"He was giving out and I had to get him  to his bunk.\"    \"It might be well to know.\" The Engineer-apprentice got up, his movements  lacking much of the elastic spring which was normally his. When he  climbed to control both the others followed him.    Ali's slender fingers played across a set of keys and in the small screen  mounting on the computer a set of figures appeared. Dane took up the  master course book, read the connotation and blinked.    \"Not Luna?\" Ali asked.    \"No. But I don't understand. This must be for somewhere in the asteroid  belt.\"    Ali's lips stretched into a pale caricature of a smile. \"Good for the Old  Man, he still had his wits about him, even after the bug bit him!\"    \"But why are we going to the asteroids?\" Weeks asked reasonably enough.  \"There're Medics at Luna City--they can help us--\"    \"They can handle known diseases,\" Ali pointed out. \"But what of the  Code?\"    Weeks dropped into the Com-tech's place as if some of the stiffening had  vanished from his thin but sturdy legs. \"They wouldn't do that--\" he  protested, but his eyes said that he knew that they might--they well  might.    \"Oh, no? Face the facts, man,\" Ali sounded almost savage. \"We come from a  frontier planet, we're a plague ship--\"    He did not have to underline that. They all knew too well the danger in  which they now stood.    \"Nobody's died yet,\" Weeks tried to find an opening in the net being  drawn about them.    \"And nobody's recovered,\" Ali crushed that thread of hope. \"We don't know  what it is, how it is contracted--anything about it. Let us make a report  saying that and you know what will happen--don't you?\"    They weren't"]]]
