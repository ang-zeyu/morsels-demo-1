Cheap,--to be had at  a low price--small value. Ah! I hev (have) it,\" said he, stamping and  knitting his brows, \"sacre-e-e-e-e nom de Dieu,\" and the first word  being drawn out to its usual longitude, three strides brought him and  the conclusion of the oath into the office together. He then opened out  upon the book-keeper, in a tremendous volley of French, English and  Hanoverian oaths, for he was a cross between the first and last named  countries, the purport of which was \"dat he had paid de best price,  and he be dem if he vod ride on de Cheapside of de coach.\" In vain  the clerks and book-keepers tried to convince him he was wrong in his  interpretation. With the full conviction of a foreigner that he was  about to be cheated, he had his cloak shifted to the opposite side of  the coach, and the knapsack placed on the roof. The fourth inside having  cast up, the outside passengers mounted, the insides took their places,  three-pences and sixpences were pulled out for the porters, the guard  twanged his horn, the coachman turned out his elbow, flourished his  whip, caught the point, cried \"All right! sit tight!\" and trotted out of  the yard.    Jorrocks and the Yorkshireman sat opposite each other, the Baron and old  Sam Spring, the betting man, did likewise. Who doesn't know old Sam,  with his curious tortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles, his old drab hat  turned up with green, careless neckcloth, flowing robe, and comical cut?  He knew Jorrocks--though--tell it not in Coram Street, he didn't know  his name; but concluded from the disparity of age between him and his  companion, that Jorrocks was either a shark or a shark's jackal, and  the Yorkshireman a victim. With due professional delicacy, he contented  himself with scrutinising the latter through his specs. The Baron's  choler having subsided, he was the first to break the ice of silence.  \"Foine noight,\" was the observation, which was thrown out promiscuously  to see who would take it up. Now Sam Spring, though he came late, had  learned from the porter that there was a Baron in the coach, and being a  great admirer of the nobility, for whose use he has a code of signals  of his own, consisting of one finger to his hat for a Baron Lord as he  calls them, two for a Viscount, three for an Earl, four for a Marquis,  and the whole hand for a Duke, he immediately responded with \"Yes, my  lord,\" with a fore-finger to his hat. There is something sweet in the  word \"Lord\" which finds its way home to the heart of an Englishman.  No sooner did Sam pronounce it, than the Baron became transformed in  Jorrocks's eyes into a very superior sort of person, and forthwith he  commences ingratiating himself by offering him a share of a large paper  of sandwiches, which the Baron accepted with the greatest condescension,  eating what he could and stuffing the remainder into his hat. His  lordship was a better hand at eating than speaking, and the united  efforts of the party could not extract from him the precise purport of  his journey. Sam threw out two or three feasible offers in the way of  bets, but they fell still-born to the bottom of the coach, and Jorrocks  talked to him about hunting and had the conversation all to himself,  the Baron merely replying with a bow and a stare, sometimes diversified  with, or \"I tank you--vare good.\" The conversation by degrees resolved  itself into a snore, in which they were all indulging, when the raw  morning air rushed in among them, as a porter with a lanthorn opened the  door and announced their arrival at Newmarket. Forthwith they turned  into the street, and the outside passengers having descended, they all  commenced straddling, yawning, and stretching their limbs while the  guard and porters sorted their luggage. The Yorkshireman having an eye  to a bed, speedily had Mr. Jorrocks's luggage and his own on the back  of a porter on its way to the \"Rutland Arms,\" while that worthy citizen  followed in a sort of sleepy astonishment at the smallness of the place,  inquiring if they were sure they had not stopped at some village by  mistake. Two beds had been ordered for two gentlemen who could not get  two seats by the mail, which fell to the lot of those who did, and into  these our heroes trundled, having arranged to be called by the early  exercising hour.    Whether it was from want of his usual night-cap of brandy and water, or  the fatigues of travelling, or what else, remains unknown, but no sooner  was Mr. Jorrocks left alone with his candle, than all at once he was  seized with a sudden fit of trepidation, on thinking that he should have  been inveigled to such a place as Newmarket, and the tremor increasing  as he pulled four five-pound bank-notes out of his watch-pocket, besides  a vast of silver and his great gold watch, he was resolved, should an  attempt be made upon his property, to defend it with his life, and  having squeezed the notes into the toe of his boots, and hid the silver  in the wash-hand stand, he very deliberately put his watch and the poker  under the pillow, and set the heavy chest of drawers with two stout  chairs and a table against the door, after all which exertions he got  into bed and very soon fell sound asleep.    Most of the inmates of the house were up with the lark to the early  exercises, and the Yorkshireman was as early as any of them. Having  found Mr. Jorrocks's door, he commenced a loud battery against it  without awaking the grocer; he then tried to open it, but only succeeded  in getting it an inch or two from the post, and after several holloas of  \"Jorrocks, my man! Mr. Jorrocks! Jorrocks, old boy! holloa, Jorrocks!\"  he succeeded in extracting the word \"Wot?\" from the worthy gentleman as  he rolled over in his bed. \"Jorrocks!\" repeated the Yorkshireman, \"it's  time to be up.\" \"Wot?\" again was the answer. \"Time to get up. The  morning's breaking.\" \"Let it break,\" replied he, adding in a mutter, as  he turned over again, \"it owes me nothing.\"    Entreaties being useless, and a large party being on the point of  setting off, the Yorkshireman joined them, and spent a couple of hours  on the dew-bespangled heath, during which time they not only criticised  the figure and action of every horse that was out, but got up tremendous  appetites for breakfast. In the meantime Mr. Jorrocks had risen, and  having attired himself with his usual care, in a smart blue coat with  metal buttons, buff waistcoat, blue stocking-netted tights, and Hessian  boots, he turned into the main street of Newmarket, where he was lost in  astonishment at the insignificance of the place. But wiser men than  Mr. Jorrocks have been similarly disappointed, for it enters into  the philosophy of few to conceive the fame and grandeur of Newmarket  compressed into the limits of the petty, outlandish, Icelandish place  that bears the name. \"Dash my vig,\" said Mr. Jorrocks, as he brought  himself to bear upon Rogers's shop-window, \"this is the werry  meanest town I ever did see. Pray, sir,\" addressing himself to a  groomish-looking man in a brown cut-away coat, drab shorts and  continuations, who had just emerged from the shop with a race list in  his hand, \"Pray, sir, be this your principal street?\" The man eyed him  with a mixed look of incredulity and contempt. At length, putting his  thumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat, he replied, \"I bet a crown  you know as well as I do.\" \"Done,\" said Mr. Jorrocks holding out his  hand. \"No--I won't do that,\" replied the man, \"but I'll tell you what  I'll do with you,--I'll lay you two to one, in fives or fifties if you  like, that you knew before you axed, and that Thunderbolt don't win the  Riddlesworth.\" \"Really,\" said Mr. Jorrocks, \"I'm not a betting man.\"  \"Then, wot the 'ell business have you at Newmarket?\" was all the answer  he got. Disgusted with such inhospitable impertinence, Mr. Jorrocks  turned on his heel and walked away. Before the \"White Hart\" Inn was a  smartish pony phaeton, in charge of a stunted stable lad. \"I say, young  chap,\" inquired Jorrocks, \"whose is that?\" \"How did you know that I  was a young chap?\" inquired the abortion turning round. \"Guessed it,\"  replied Jorrocks, chuckling at his own wit. \"Then guess whose it is.\"    \"Pray, are your clocks here by London time?\" he asked of a respectable  elderly-looking man whom he saw turn out of the entry leading to the  Kingston rooms, and take the usual survey first up the town and then  down it, and afterwards compose his hands in his breeches-pockets, there  to stand to see the \"world.\" [17] \"Come now, old 'un--none o' your tricks  here--you've got a match on against time, I suppose,\" was all the answer  he could get after the man (old R--n the ex-flagellator) had surveyed  him from head to foot.    [Footnote 17: Newmarket or London--it's all the same--\"The world\" is but  composed of one's own acquaintance.]    We need hardly say after all these rebuffs that when Mr. Jorrocks met  the Yorkshireman, he was not in the best possible humour; indeed, to say  nothing of the extreme sharpness and suspicion of the people, we know of  no place where a man, not fond of racing, is so completely out of his  element as at Newmarket, for with the exception of a little \"elbow  shaking\" in the evening, there is literally and truly nothing else  to do. It is \"Heath,\" \"Ditch in,\" \"Abingdon mile,\" \"T.Y.C. Stakes,\"  \"Sweepstakes,\" \"Handicaps,\" \"Bet,\" \"Lay,\" \"Take,\" \"Odds,\" \"Evens,\"  morning, noon and night.    Mr. Jorrocks made bitter complaints during the breakfast, and some  invidious comparisons between racing men and fox-hunters, which,  however, became softer towards the close, as he got deeper in the  delicacy of a fine Cambridge brawn.

I wept very  bitterly for some time: and began to think that I must have done  something to displease the Lord, that he thus punished me so severely.  This filled me with painful reflections on my past conduct; I  recollected that on the morning of our arrival at Deptford I had  rashly sworn that as soon as we reached London I would spend the day  in rambling and sport. My conscience smote me for this unguarded  expression: I felt that the Lord was able to disappoint me in all  things, and immediately considered my present situation as a judgment  of Heaven on account of my presumption in swearing: I therefore, with  contrition of heart, acknowledged my transgression to God, and poured  out my soul before him with unfeigned repentance, and with earnest  supplications I besought him not to abandon me in my distress, nor  cast me from his mercy for ever. In a little time my grief, spent with  its own violence, began to subside; and after the first confusion of  my thoughts was over I reflected with more calmness on my present  condition: I considered that trials and disappointments are sometimes  for our good, and I thought God might perhaps have permitted this in  order to teach me wisdom and resignation; for he had hitherto shadowed  me with the wings of his mercy, and by his invisible but powerful hand  brought me the way I knew not. These reflections gave me a little  comfort, and I rose at last from the deck with dejection and sorrow in  my countenance, yet mixed with some faint hope that the _Lord would  appear_ for my deliverance.    Soon afterwards, as my new master was going ashore, he called me to  him, and told me to behave myself well, and do the business of the  ship the same as any of the rest of the boys, and that I should fare  the better for it; but I made him no answer. I was then asked if I  could swim, and I said, No. However I was made to go under the deck,  and was well watched. The next tide the ship got under way, and soon  after arrived at the Mother Bank, Portsmouth; where she waited a few  days for some of the West India convoy. While I was here I tried every  means I could devise amongst the people of the ship to get me a boat  from the shore, as there was none suffered to come alongside of the  ship; and their own, whenever it was used, was hoisted in again  immediately. A sailor on board took a guinea from me on pretence of  getting me a boat; and promised me, time after time, that it was  hourly to come off. When he had the watch upon deck I watched also;  and looked long enough, but all in vain; I could never see either the  boat or my guinea again. And what I thought was still the worst of  all, the fellow gave information, as I afterwards found, all the while  to the mates, of my intention to go off, if I could in any way do it;  but, rogue like, he never told them he had got a guinea from me to  procure my escape. However, after we had sailed, and his trick was  made known to the ship's crew, I had some satisfaction in seeing him  detested and despised by them all for his behaviour to me. I was still  in hopes that my old shipmates would not forget their promise to come  for me to Portsmouth: and, indeed, at last, but not till the day  before we sailed, some of them did come there, and sent me off some  oranges, and other tokens of their regard. They also sent me word they  would come off to me themselves the next day or the day after; and a  lady also, who lived in Gosport, wrote to me that she would come and  take me out of the ship at the same time. This lady had been once very  intimate with my former master: I used to sell and take care of a  great deal of property for her, in different ships; and in return she  always shewed great friendship for me, and used to tell my master that  she would take me away to live with her: but, unfortunately for me, a  disagreement soon afterwards took place between them; and she was  succeeded in my master's good graces by another lady, who appeared  sole mistress of the AEtna, and mostly lodged on board. I was not so  great a favourite with this lady as with the former; she had conceived  a pique against me on some occasion when she was on board, and she did  not fail to instigate my master to treat me in the manner he did[O].    However, the next morning, the 30th of December, the wind being brisk  and easterly, the Oeolus frigate, which was to escort the convoy,  made a signal for sailing. All the ships then got up their anchors;  and, before any of my friends had an opportunity to come off to my  relief, to my inexpressible anguish our ship had got under way. What  tumultuous emotions agitated my soul when the convoy got under sail,  and I a prisoner on board, now without hope! I kept my swimming eyes  upon the land in a state of unutterable grief; not knowing what to do,  and despairing how to help myself. While my mind was in this situation  the fleet sailed on, and in one day's time I lost sight of the  wished-for land. In the first expressions of my grief I reproached my  fate, and wished I had never been born. I was ready to curse the tide  that bore us, the gale that wafted my prison, and even the ship that  conducted us; and I called on death to relieve me from the horrors I  felt and dreaded, that I might be in that place        \"Where slaves are free, and men oppress no more.      Fool that I was, inur'd so long to pain,      To trust to hope, or dream of joy again.               *       *       *       *       *        Now dragg'd once more beyond the western main,      To groan beneath some dastard planter's chain;      Where my poor countrymen in bondage wait      The long enfranchisement of ling'ring fate:      Hard ling'ring fate! while, ere the dawn of day,      Rous'd by the lash they go their cheerless way;      And as their souls with shame and anguish burn,      Salute with groans unwelcome morn's return,      And, chiding ev'ry hour the slow-pac'd sun,      Pursue their toils till all his race is run.      No eye to mark their suff'rings with a tear;      No friend to comfort, and no hope to cheer:      Then, like the dull unpity'd brutes, repair      To stalls as wretched, and as coarse a fare;      Thank heaven one day of mis'ry was o'er,      Then sink to sleep, and wish to wake no more[P].\"    The turbulence of my emotions however naturally gave way to calmer  thoughts, and I soon perceived what fate had decreed no mortal on  earth could prevent. The convoy sailed on without any accident, with a  pleasant gale and smooth sea, for six weeks, till February, when one  morning the Oeolus ran down a brig, one of the convoy, and she  instantly went down and was ingulfed in the dark recesses of the  ocean. The convoy was immediately thrown into great confusion till it  was daylight; and the Oeolus was illumined with lights to prevent  any farther mischief. On the 13th of February 1763, from the  mast-head, we descried our destined island Montserrat; and soon after  I beheld those        \"Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace      And rest can rarely dwell. Hope never comes      That comes to all, but torture without end      Still urges.\"    At the sight of this land of bondage, a fresh horror ran through all  my frame, and chilled me to the heart. My former slavery now rose in  dreadful review to my mind, and displayed nothing but misery, stripes,  and chains; and, in the first paroxysm of my grief, I called upon  God's thunder, and his avenging power, to direct the stroke of death  to me, rather than permit me to become a slave, and be sold from lord  to lord.    In this state of my mind our ship came to an anchor, and soon after  discharged her cargo. I now knew what it was to work hard; I was made  to help to unload and load the ship. And, to comfort me in my distress  in that time, two of the sailors robbed me of all my money, and ran  away from the ship. I had been so long used to an European climate  that at first I felt the scorching West India sun very painful, while  the dashing surf would toss the boat and the people in it frequently  above high water mark. Sometimes our limbs were broken with this, or  even attended with instant death, and I was day by day mangled and  torn.    About the middle of May, when the ship was got ready to sail for  England, I all the time believing that Fate's blackest clouds were  gathering over my head, and expecting their bursting would mix me with  the dead, Captain Doran sent for me ashore one morning, and I was told  by the messenger that my fate was then determined. With fluttering  steps and trembling heart I came to the captain, and found with him  one Mr. Robert King, a quaker, and the first merchant in the place.  The captain then told me my former master had sent me there to be  sold; but that he had desired him to get me the best master he could,  as he told him I was a very deserving boy, which Captain Doran said he  found to be true; and if he were to stay in the West Indies he would  be glad to keep me himself; but he could not venture to take me to  London, for he was very sure that when I came there I would leave him.  I at that instant burst out a crying, and begged much of him to take  me to England with him, but all to no purpose. He told me he had got  me the very best master in the"]]]
