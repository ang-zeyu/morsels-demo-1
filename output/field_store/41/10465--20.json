They ain't any other way they can get out of here.  Pass that down the line, Mat.\"    Before the whisper had trailed out half its course, a woman screamed in  the house. It sent a jag of lightning through the brain of Vic Gregg; he  started up.    \"Get down,\" commanded the sheriff 'curtly. \"Or they'll plant you.\"    \"For God's sake, Pete, he's killin' his wife--an'--he's gone mad--I seen  it comin' in his eyes!\"    \"Shut up,\" muttered Glass, \"an' listen.\"    A pulse of sound floated out to them, and stopped the breath of Gregg;  it was a deep, stifled sobbing.    \"She's begged him to stay with her; he's gone,\" said the sheriff. \"Now  it'll come quick.\"    But the sheriff was wrong. There was not a sound, not a sign of a rush.    Presently: \"What sort of a lass is she, Gregg?\"    \"All yaller hair, Pete, and the softes' blue eyes you ever see.\"    The sheriff made no answer, but Vic saw the little bony hand tense about  the barrel of the rifle. Still that utter quiet, with the pulse of the  sobbing lying like a weight upon the air, and the horror of the waiting  mounted and grew, like peak upon peak before the eyes of the climber.    \"Watch for 'em sneakin' up on us through the rocks. Watch for 'em close,  lads. It ain't goin' to be a rush.\"    Once more the sibilant murmur ran down the line, and the voice of Sliver  Waldron brought it faintly to a period.    \"Three of 'em,\" continued the sheriff, \"and most likely they'll come at  us three ways.\"    Through the shadow Vic watched the lips of Glass work and caught the end  of his soft murmur to himself: \".... all three!\"    He understood; the sheriff had offered up a deep prayer that all three  might fall by his gun.    Up from the farther end of the line the whisper ran lightly, swiftly,  with a stammer of haste in it: \"To the right!\"    Ay, there to the right, gliding from the corner of the house, went a  dark form, and then another, and disappeared among the rocks. They had  offered not enough target for even chance shooting.    \"Hold for close range\" ordered the sheriff, and the order was repeated.  However much he might wish to win all the glory of the fray, the sheriff  took no chances--threw none of his odds away. He was a methodical man.    A slight patter caught the ear of Vic, like the running of many small  children over a heavy carpet, and then two shades blew around the side  of the house, one small and scudding close to the ground, the other  vastly larger--a man on horseback. It seemed a naked horse at first, so  close to the back did the rider lean, and before Vic could see clearly  the vision burst on them all. Several things kept shots from being fired  earlier.    The first alarm had called attention to the opposite side of the house  from that on which the rider appeared; then, the moon gave only a  vague, treacherous light, and the black horse blended into it--the grass  lightened the fall of his racing feet.    Like a ship driving through a fog they rushed into view, the black  stallion, and Bart fleeting in front, and the surprise was complete. Vic  could see it work even in the sheriff, for the latter, having his rifle  trained towards his right jerked it about with a short curse and blazed  at the new target, again, again, and the line of the posse joined the  fire. Before the crack of their guns went from the ears of Vic, long  before the echoes bellowed back from the hills, Satan leaped high up.  Perhaps that change of position saved both it and its rider. Straight  across the pale moon drove the body with head stretched forth, ears  back, feet gathered close--a winged horse with a buoyant figure upon it.  It cleared a five foot rock, and rushed instantly out of view among  the boulders. The fugitive had fired only one shot, and that when the  stallion was at the crest of its leap.        Chapter XVII. The Second Man    The sheriff was on his feet, whining with eagerness and with the rest of  his men he sent a shower of lead splashing vainly into the deeper night  beside the mountain, where the path wound down.    \"It's done! Hold up, lads!\" called Pete Glass. \"He's beat us!\"    The firing ceased, and they heard the rush of the hoofs along the  graveled slope and the clanging on rocks.    \"It's done,\" repeated the sheriff. \"How?\"    And he stood staring blankly, with a touch or horror in his face.    \"By God, Mat's plugged.\"    \"Mat Henshaw? Wha--?\"    \"Clean through the head.\"    He lay in an oddly twisted heap, as though every bone in his body were  broken, and when they drew him about they found the red mark in his  forehead and even made out the dull surprise in his set face. There had  been no pain in that death, the second for the sake of Grey Molly.    \"The other two!\" said the sheriff, more to himself than to Vic, who  stood beside him.    \"Easy, Pete,\" he cautioned. \"You got nothin' agin Haines and Daniels.\"    The sheriff flashed at him that hungry, baffled glance.    \"Maybe I can find something. You Gregg, keep your mouth shut and stand  back. Halloo!\"    He sent a long call quavering between the lonely mountains.    \"You yonder--Lee Haines! D'you give up to the law?\"    A burst of savage laughter flung back at him, and then: \"Why the hell  should I?\"    \"Haines, I give you fair warnin'! For resistin' the law and interferin',  I ask you, do you surrender?\"    \"Who are you?\"    The big voice fairly swallowed the rather shrill tone of the sheriff.    \"I'm sheriff Pete Glass.\"    \"You lie. Whoever heard of a sheriff come sneakin' round like a coyote  lookin' for dead meat?\"    Pete Glass grinned with rage.    \"Haines, you ain't much better'n spoiled meat if you keep back. I gave  you till I count ten--\"    \"Why, you bob-tailed skunk,\" shouted a new voice. \"You bone-spavined,  pink-eyed rat-catcher,\" continued this very particular describer, \"what  have you got on us? Come out and dicker and we'll do the same!\"    The sheriff sighed, softly, deeply.    \"I thought maybe they wouldn't get down to talk,\" he murmured. But since  the last chance for a battle was gone, he stepped fearlessly from behind  his rock and advanced into the open. Two tall figures came to meet him.    \"Now,\" said Lee Haines, stalking forward. \"One bad move, just the glint  of a single gun from the rest of you sheep thieves, and I'll tame your  pet sheriff and send him to hell for a model.\"    They halted, close to each other, the two big men, Haines in the front,  and the sheriff.    \"You're Lee Haines?\"    \"You've named me.\"    \"And you're Buck Daniels?\"    \"That's me.\"    \"Gents, you've resisted an officer of the law in the act of makin' an  arrest. I s'pose you know what that means?\"    Big Lee Haines laughed.    \"Don't start a bluff, sheriff. I know a bit about the law.\"    \"Maybe by experience?\"    It was an odd thing to watch the three, every one of them a practiced  fighter, every one of them primed for trouble, but each ostentatiously  keeping his hands away from the holsters.    \"What we might have done if we had come to a pinch,\" said Haines, \"is  one thing, and what we did do is another. Barry was started and off  before we had a chance to show teeth, my friend, and you never even  caught the flash of our guns. If he'd waited but he didn't. There's  nothing left for us to do except say good-by.\"    The little dusty man stroked his moustaches thoughtfully. He had gone  out there hoping against hope that his chance might come--to trick the  two into violence, even to start an arrest for reasons which he knew his  posse would swear to; but it must be borne in mind that Pete Glass was a  careful man by instinct. Taking in probable speed of hand and a thousand  other details at a glance, Pete sensed the danger of these two and felt  in his heart of hearts that he was more than master of either of them,  considered alone; better than Buck Daniels by an almost safe margin of  steadiness; better than Lee Haines by a flickering instant of speed. Had  either of them alone faced him, he would have taken his chance, perhaps,  to kill or be killed, for the long trail and the escape had fanned that  spark within him to a cold, hungry fire; but to attempt a play with both  at the same time was death, and he knew it. Seeing that the game was up,  he laid his cards on the table with characteristic frankness.    \"Gents,\" he said, \"I reckon you've come clean with me. You ain't my meat  and I ain't goin' to clutter up your way. Besides\"--even in the dull  moonshine they caught the humorous glint of his eyes--\"a friend is a  friend, and I'll say I'm glad that you didn't step into the shady side  of the law while Barry was gettin' away.\"    No one could know what it cost Pete Glass to be genial at that instant,  for this night he felt that he had just missed the great moment which  he had yearned for since the day when he learned to love the kick of a  six-shooter against the heel of his hand. It was the desire to meet face  to face one whose metal of will and mind was equal to his own, whose  nerves were electric energies perfectly under command, whose muscles  were fine spun steel. He had gone half a lifetime on the trail of  fighters and always he had known that when the crisis came his hand  would be the swifter, his eyes the more steady; the trailing was a  delight always, but the actual kill was a matter of slaughter rather  than a game of hazard. Only the rider of the black stallion had given  him the sense of equal power, and his whole soul had risen for the  great chance of All. That chance was gone; he pushed the thought of it  away--for the time--and turned back to the business at hand.    \"They's only one thing,\" he went on. \"Sliver! Ronicky! Step along,  gents, and we'll have a look at the insides of that house.\"    \"Steady!\" broke in Haines. He barred the path to the front door.  \"Sheriff, you don't know me, but I'm going to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18993"],[0,"History  of the World War: An Authentic Narrative of the World's Greatest War (#17)"],[1,"soldier had just been killed by a shot fired from the house of  Mr. David Fishbach. Addressing the soldiers, Dr. Berghausen said: 'The  blood of the entire population of Louvain is not worth a drop of the  blood of a German soldier!' Then one of the soldiers threw into the  interior of the house of Mr. Fishbach one of the pastils which the  German soldiers carried and immediately the house flared up. It  contained paintings of a high value. The old coachman, Joseph  Vandermosten, who had re-entered the house to try to save the life of  his master, did not return. His body was found the next day amidst the  ruins. . . .    \"The Germans made the usual claim that the civil population had fired  upon them and that it was necessary to take these measures, i. e., burn  the churches, the library and other public monuments, burn and pillage  houses, driving out and murdering the inhabitants, sacking the city in  order to punish and to spread terror among the people, and General von  Luttwitz had told me that it was reported that the son of the  burgomaster had shot one of their generals. But the burgomaster of  Louvain had no son and no officer was shot at Louvain. The story of a  general shot by the son of a burgomaster was a repetition of a tragedy  that had occurred at Aerschot, on the 19th, where the fifteen-year-old  son of the burgomaster had been killed by a firing squad, not because he  had shot a general, but because an officer had been shot, probably by  Belgian soldiers retreating through the town. The story of this tragedy  is told by the boy's mother, under oath, before the Belgian Commission,  and is so simple, so touching, so convincing in its verisimilitude, that  I attach a copy of it in extenso to this report. It seems to afford an  altogether typical example of what went on all over the stricken land  during those days of terror. (In other places it was the daughter of the  burgomaster who was said to have shot a general.)    \"The following facts may be noted: From the avowal of Prussian officers  themselves, there was not one single victim, among their men at the  barracks of St. Martin, Louvain, where it was claimed that the first  shot had been fired from a house situated in front of the Caserne. This  would appear to be impossible had the civilians fired upon them point  blank from across the street. It was said that when certain houses near  the barracks were burning, numerous explosions occurred, revealing the  presence of cartridges; but these houses were drinking houses much  frequented by German soldiers. It was said that Spanish students shot  from the schools in the Rue de la Station, but Father Catala, rector of  the school, affirms that the schools were empty. . . .    \"If it was necessary, for whatever reason, to do what was done at Vise,  at Dinant, at Aerschot, at Louvain, and in a hundred other towns that  were sacked, pillaged and burned, where masses were shot down because  civilians had fired on German troops, and if it was necessary to do this  on a scale never before witnessed in history, one might not unreasonably  assume that the alleged firing by civilians was done on a scale, if not  so thoroughly organized, at least somewhat in proportion to the rage of  destruction that punished it. And hence it would seem to be a simple  matter to produce at least convincing evidence that civilians had fired  on the soldiers; but there is no testimony to that effect beyond that of  the soldiers who merely assert it: Man hat geschossen. If there were no  more firing on soldiers by civilians in Belgium than is proved by the  German testimony, it was not enough to justify the burning of the  smallest of the towns that was overtaken by that fate. And there is not  a scintilla of evidence of organized bands of francs-tireurs, such as  were found in the war of 1870.\"    Under date of September 12, 1917, Minister Whitlock, in a report to the  State Department of the United States, made the following summary: \"As  one studies the evidence at hand, one is struck at the outset by the  fact so general that it must exclude the hypothesis of coincidence, and  that is that these wholesale massacres followed immediately upon some  check, some reverse, that the German army had sustained. The German army  was checked by the guns of the forts to the east of Liege, and the  horrors of Vise, Verviers, Bligny, Battice, Hervy and twenty villages  follow. When they entered Liege, they burned the houses along two  streets and killed many persons, five or six Spaniards among them.  Checked before Namur they sacked Andenne, Bouvignies, and Champignon,  and when they took Namur they burned one hundred and fifty houses.  Compelled to give battle to the French army in the Belgian Ardennes they  ravaged the beautiful valley of the Semois; the complete destruction of  the village of Rossignlo and the extermination of its entire male  population took place there. Checked again by the French on the Meuse,  the awful carnage of Dinant results. Held on the Sambre by the French,  they burn one hundred houses at Charleroi and enact the appalling  tragedy of Tamines. At Mons, the English hold them, and after that all  over the Borinage there is a systematic destruction, pillage and murder.  The Belgian army drive them back from Malines and Louvain is doomed. The  Belgian army failing back and fighting in retreat took refuge in the  forts of Antwerp, and the burning and sack of Hougaerde, Wavre,  Ottignies, Grimde, Neerlinter, Weert, St. George, Shaffen and Aerschot  follow.

[Illustration: Photograph of King and soldiers parading on horses.]    Photo by Trans-Atlantic News Service    KING ALBERT AT THE HEAD OF THE HEROIC SOLDIERS OF BELGIUM    It is universally agreed that the Belgian monarch was no figurehead    general but a real leader of his troops. It was these men, facing    annihilation, who astonished the world by opposing the German military    machine successfully enough to allow France to get her armies into    shape and prevent the immediate taking of Paris that was planned by    Germany.    [Illustration: Painting of soldiers dragging large guns through mud;  shells are exploding in the background; in the foreground a dead  soldier lies face down in the mud.]    THE TERRIBLE FLANDERS MUD    A German battery endeavoring to escape from a British advance sinks in    the mud. The gunners are endeavoring to pull the gun out with ropes.      \"The Belgian troops inflicted serious losses on the Germans in the South  of the Province of Limbourg, and the towns of Lummen, Bilsen, and  Lanaeken are partially destroyed. Antwerp held out for two months, and  all about its outer line of fortifications there was blood and fire,  numerous villages were sacked and burned and the whole town of Termonde  was destroyed. During the battles of September the village of  Boortmeerbeek near Malines, occupied by the Germans, was retaken by the  Belgians, and when the Germans entered it again they burned forty  houses. Three times occupied by the Belgians and retaken by the Germans  Boortmeerbeek was three times punished in the same way. That is to say,  everywhere the German army met with a defeat it took it out, as we say  in America, on the civil population. And that is the explanation of the  German atrocities in Belgium.\"    A committee of the highest honor and responsibility was appointed by the  British Government to investigate the whole subject of atrocities in  Belgium and Northern France. Its chairman was the Rt. Hon. Viscount  James Bryce, formerly British Ambassador to the United States. Its other  members were the Rt. Hon. Sir Frederick Pollock, the Rt. Hon. Sir Edward  Clark, Sir Alfred Hopkinson, Mr. H. A. L. Fisher, Vice-Chancellor of the  University of Sheffield, Mr. Harold Cox and Sir Kenelm E. Digby.    The report of the commission bears upon its face the stamp of  painstaking search for truth, substantiates every statement made by  Minister Whitlock and makes known many horrible instances of cruelty and  barbarity. It makes the following deductions as having been proved  beyond question:    1. That there were in many parts of Belgium deliberate and  systematically organized massacres of the civil population, accompanied  by many isolated murders and other outrages.    2. That in the conduct of the war generally innocent civilians, both men  and women, were murdered in large numbers, women violated, and children  murdered.    3. That looting, house burning, and the wanton destruction of property  were ordered and countenanced by the officers of the German army, that  elaborate provision had been made for systematic incendiarism at the  very outbreak of the war, and that the burnings and destruction were  frequent where no military necessity could be alleged, being, indeed,  part of a system of general terrorization.    4. That the rules and usages of war were frequently broken, particularly  by the using of civilians, including women and children, as a shield for  advancing forces exposed to fire, to a less degree by killing the  wounded and prisoners and in the frequent abuse of the Red Cross and the  white flag.      The Bryce Commission's report on the destruction of Dinant is an example of  testimony laid before them. It follows:      \"A clear statement of the outrages at Dinant, which many travelers will  recall as a singularly picturesque town on the Meuse, is given by one  witness, who says that the Germans began burning houses in the Rue St.  Jacques on the 21st of August, and that every house in the street was  burned. On the following day an engagement took place between the French  and the Germans, and the witness spent the whole day in the cellar of a  bank with his wife and children. On the morning of "]]]
