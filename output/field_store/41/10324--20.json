The functions of  the directorates shall include the registration of the Jewish  population, the management of the communal finances, the dispensation of  charity, and the opening of secular schools for Jewish children. A  certificate of graduation from such a school shall be required from  every young man who applies for a marriage license or for a permit to  engage in a craft or to acquire property. \"All Jews fulfilling the  obligations imposed by the present statute shall be accorded full  citizenship,\" while those who distinguish themselves in science an art  may even be deemed worthy of political rights, not excluding membership  in the Polish Diet. For the immediate future Novosiltzev advises to  refrain from economic restrictions, such as the prohibition of the  liquor traffic, though he concedes the advisability of checking its  growth, and advocates the adoption of a system of economic reforms by  stimulating crafts and agriculture among the Jews. In the beginning of  1817 Novosiltzev's project was laid before the Polish Council of State.  It was opposed with great stubbornness by Chartoryski, the Polish  viceroy Zayonchek, Stashitz, and other Polish dignitaries, whose  hostility was directed not so much against the pro-Jewish plan as  against its Russian author. The Council of State appointed a special  committee which, after examining Novosiltzev's project, arrived at the  following conclusions:      1. It is impossible to carry out a reorganization of Jewish life    through the Jews themselves.      2. The establishment of a separate cultural organization for the    Jews will only stimulate their national aloofness.      3. The complete civil and political emancipation of the Jews is at    variance with the Polish Constitution which vouchsafes special    privileges to the professors of the dominant religion.    In the plenary session of the Polish Council of State the debate about  Novosiltzev's project was exceedingly stormy. The Polish members of the  Council scented in the project \"political aims in opposition to the  national element of the country.\" They emphasized the danger which the  immediate emancipation of the Jews would entail for Poland. \"Let the  Jews first become real Poles,\" exclaimed the referee Kozhmyan, \"then  will it be possible to look upon them as citizens.\" When the same  gentleman declared that it was impossible to accord citizenship to  hordes of people who first had to be accustomed to cleanliness and cured  from \"leprosy and similar diseases,\" Zayonchek burst out laughing and  shouted: \"Hear, hear! These sluts won't get rid of their scab so  easily.\" After such elevating \"criticism,\" Novosiltzev's project was  voted down. The Council inclined to the belief that \"the psychological  moment\" for bringing about a radical reorganization of the inner life of  the Jews had not yet arrived, and, therefore, resolved to limit itself  to isolated measures, principally of a \"correctional\" and repressive  character.      2. POLITICAL REACTION AND LITERARY ANTI-SEMITISM    Such \"measures\" were not long in coming. The only restriction the  Government of Warsaw failed to carry through was the enforcement of the  law of 1812 forbidding the Jews to deal in liquor. This drastic measure  was vetoed by Alexander I., owing to the representations of the Jewish  deputies in St. Petersburg, and in 1816 the Polish viceroy was compelled  to announce the suspension of this cruel law which had hung like the  sword of Damocles over the heads of hundreds of thousands of Jews.    On the other hand, the Polish Government managed in the course of a few  years (1816-1823) to put into operation a number of other restrictive  laws. Several cities which boasted of the ancient right _de non  tolerandis Judaeis_[1] secured the confirmation of this shameful  privilege, with the result that the Jews who had settled there during  the existence of the duchy of Warsaw were either expelled or confined to  separate districts. In Warsaw a number of streets were closed to Jewish  residents, and all Jewish visitors to the capital were forced to pay a  heavy tax for their right of sojourn, the so-called \"ticket impost,\"  amounting to fifteen kopecks (71/2c) a day. Finally the Jews were  forbidden to settle within twenty-one versts of the Austrian and  Prussian frontiers. [2]    [Footnote 1: See Vol. I, pp. 85 and 95.]    [Footnote 2: The law in question was passed by the Polish Government on  January 31, 1823, barring the Jews from nearly one hundred towns. It was  repealed by Alexander II. in 1862. See below, p. 181.]    At the same time, the Polish legislators were fair-minded enough to  refrain from forcing the Jews, these disfranchised pariahs, into  military service. In 1817 an announcement was made to the effect that,  so long as the Jews were barred from the enjoyment of civil rights, they  would be released from personal military service in Poland, in lieu  whereof they were to pay a fixed conscription tax. About the same time,  during the third decade of the nineteenth century, was also realized the  old-time policy of curtailing the Jewish Kahal autonomy, though, as will  be seen later, this \"reform\" did not proceed from the Government  spheres, but was rather the product of contemporary social movements  among the Poles and the Jews.    The political literature of Poland manifested at that time a tendency  similar to the one which had prevailed during the Quadrennial Diet.[1]  Scores of pamphlets and magazine articles discussed with polemical ardor  the Jewish problem, the burning question of the day. The old Jew-baiter  Stashitz, a member of the Warsaw Government who served on the Commission  of Public Instruction and Religious Denominations, resumed his attacks  on Judaism. In 1816 he published an article under the title \"Concerning  the Causes of the Obnoxiousness of the Jews,\" in which he asserted that  the Jews were responsible for Poland's decline. They multiplied with  incredible rapidity, forming now no less than an eighth of the  population. Should this process continue, the Kingdom of Poland would be  turned into a \"Jewish country\" and become \"the laughing-stock of the  whole of Europe.\" The Jewish religion is antagonistic to Catholicism: we  call them \"Old Testament believers,\" [2] while they brand us as  \"pagans.\" It being impossible to expel the Jews from Poland, they ought  to be isolated like carriers of disease. They should be concentrated in  separate quarters in the cities to facilitate the supervision over them.  Only well-deserving merchants and craftsmen, who have plied their trade  honestly for five or ten years, should be allowed to reside outside the  ghetto. The same category of Jews, in addition to those married to  Christian women, should also be granted the right of acquiring landed  property. The ghetto on the one end of the line, and baptism on the  other--this medieval policy did not in the least abash the patriotic  reformers of the type of Stashitz.    [Footnote 1: Compare Vol. I, p. 279 et seq.]    [Footnote 2: Referring to the term _Starozakonni_, the Polish  designation for Jews.]    Stashitz's point of view was supported by certain publicists and opposed  by others, but all were agreed on the necessity of a system of  correction for the Jews. The discussion became particularly heated in  1818, after the convocation and during the sessions of the first [1]  Polish Diet in Warsaw. Three different tendencies asserted themselves: a  moderate, an anti-Jewish, and a pro-Jewish tendency. The first was  represented by General Vincent Krasinski, a member of the Diet. In his  \"Observations on the Jews of Poland,\" he proceeds from the following  twofold premise: \"The voice of the whole nation is raised against the  Jews, and it demands their transformation.\" This titled publicist  declares himself an opponent of the Jews as they are at present. He  shares the popular dread of their multiplication, the fear of a \"Jewish  Poland,\" and is somewhat sceptical about their being corrigible.  Nevertheless he proposes liberal methods of correction, such as the  encouragement of big Jewish capital, the promotion of agriculture and  handicrafts among the Jewish masses, and the bestowal of the rights of  citizenship upon those worthy of it.    [Footnote 1: i.e., the first to be convoked after the reconstitution of  Poland in 1815.]    Krasinski was attacked by an anonymous writer in an anti-Semitic  pamphlet entitled \"A Remedy against the Jews.\" Proceeding from the  conviction that no reforms, however well conceived, could have any  effect on the Jews, the writer puts the question in a simplified form:  \"Shall we sacrifice the welfare of three million Poles to that of  300,000 Jews, or _vice versa?_\" His answer is just as simple: the Jews  should be forced to leave Poland. Emperor Alexander I., \"the benefactor  of Poland,\" ought to be petitioned to rid the country of the Jews by  transferring them to the uninhabited steppes in the South of Russia or  even \"on the borders of Great Tartary.\" The 300,000 Jews might be  divided into 300 parties and settled there in the course of one year.  The means for expelling and settling the Jews should be furnished by the  Jews themselves.    This barbarous project aroused the ire of a noble-minded Polish army  officer, Valerian Lukasinski, a radical in politics, who subsequently  landed in the dungeon of the Schlueselburg fortress. [1] In his  \"Reflections of an Army Officer Concerning the Need of Organizing the  Jews,\" published in 1818, Lukasinski advances the thought that the  oppression and disfranchisement of the Jews are alone responsible for  their demoralized condition. They were useful citizens in the golden age  of Casimir the Great and Sigismund the Old [2] when they were treated  with kindness.

And look!  There's another! and another! and another!\"    The Panther and Obed now saw the black specks also. The three stopped on  the crest of a swell and watched them attentively.    \"One! two! three! four! five! six! seven! eight! nine! ten! eleven!  twelve! thirteen!\" counted the far-sighted boy.    \"An' them thirteen specks are thirteen men on horseback,\" continued the  Panther, \"an' now I wonder who in the name of the great horn spoon they  are!\"    \"Suppose we see,\" said Obed. \"All things are revealed to him who  looks--at least most of the time. It is true that they are more than  four to our one, but our horses are swift, and we can get away.\"    \"That's right,\" said the Panther. \"Still, we oughtn't to take the risk  unless everybody is willin'. What do you say, Ned?\"    \"I reply 'yes,' of course,\" said the boy, \"especially as I've an idea  that those are not Mexicans. They look too big and tall, and they sit  too straight up in their saddles for Mexicans.\"    \"Them ideas of yours are ketchin',\" said the Panther. \"Them fellers may  be Mexicans, but they don't look like Mexicans, they don't act like  Mexicans, an' they ain't Mexicans.\"    \"Take out what isn't, and you have left what is,\" said Obed.    \"We'll soon see,\" said Ned.    A few minutes more and there could be no further doubt that the thirteen  were Texans or Americans. One rode a little ahead of the others, who  came on in an even line. They were mounted on large horses, but the man  in front held Ned's attention.    The leader was tall and thin, but evidently muscular and powerful. His  hair was straight and black like an Indian's. His features were angular  and tanned by the winds of many years. His body was clothed completely  in buckskin, and a raccoon skin cap was on his head. Across his shoulder  lay a rifle with a barrel of unusual length.    \"Never saw any of them before,\" said the Panther. \"By the great horn  spoon, who can that feller in front be? He looks like somebody.\"    The little band rode closer, and its leader held up his hand as a sign  of amity.    \"Good friends,\" he said, in a deep clear voice, \"we don't have very  close neighbors out here, and that makes a meeting all the pleasanter.  You are Texans, I guess.\"    \"You guess right,\" said the Panther, in the same friendly tone. \"An' are  you Texans, too?\"    \"That point might be debated,\" replied the man, in a whimsical tone,  \"and after a long dispute neither I nor my partners here could say which  was right and which was wrong. But while we may not be Texans, yet we  will be right away.\"    His eyes twinkled as he spoke, and Ned suddenly felt a strong liking for  him. He was not young and, despite his buckskin dress and careless  grammar, there was something of the man of the world about him. But he  seemed to have a certain boyishness of spirit that appealed strongly to  Ned.    \"I s'pose,\" he continued, \"that a baptism will make us genuine Texans,  an' it 'pears likely to me that we'll get that most lastin' of all  baptisms, a baptism of fire. But me an' Betsy here stand ready for it.\"    He patted lovingly the stock of his long rifle as he spoke the word  \"Betsy.\" It was the same word \"Betsy\" that gave Ned his sudden  knowledge.    \"I'm thinking that you are Davy Crockett,\" he said.    The man's face was illumined with an inimitable smile.    \"Correct,\" he said. \"No more and no less. Andy Jackson kept me from  going back to Washington, an' so me an' these twelve good friends of  mine, Tennesseans like myself, have come here to help free Texas.\"    He reached out his hand and Ned grasped it. The boy felt a thrill. The  name of Davy Crockett was a great one in the southwest, and here he was,  face to face, hands gripped with the great borderer.    \"This is Mr. Palmer, known all over Texas as the Panther, and Mr. Obed  White, once of Maine, but now a Texan,\" said Ned, introducing his  friends.    Crockett and the Panther shook hands, and looked each other squarely in  the eye.    \"Seems to me,\" said Crockett, \"that you're a man.\"    \"I was jest thinkin' the same of you,\" said the Panther.    \"An' you,\" said Crockett to Obed White, \"are a man, too. But they  certainly do grow tall where you come from.\"    \"I'm not as wide as a barn door, but I may be long enough to reach the  bottom of a well,\" said Obed modestly. \"Anyway, I thank you for the  compliment. Praise from Sir Davy is sweet music in my ear, indeed. And  since we Texans have to stand together, and since to stand together we  must know about one another, may I ask you, Mr. Crockett, which way you  are going?\"    \"We had an idea that we would go to San Antonio,\" said Crockett, \"but  I'm never above changin' my opinion. If you think it better to go  somewhere else, an' can prove it, why me an' Betsy an' the whole crowd  are ready to go there instead.\"    \"What would you say?\" asked the Panther, \"if we told you that Santa Anna  an' 7,000 men were on the Rio Grande ready to march on San Antonio?\"    \"If you said it, I'd say it was true. I'd also say that it was a thing  the Texans had better consider. If I was usin' adjectives I'd call it  alarmin'.\"    \"An' what would you say if I told you there wasn't a hundred Texan  soldiers in San Antonio to meet them seven thousand Mexicans comin'  under Santa Anna?\"    \"If you told me that I'd say it was true. I'd say also, if I was usin'  adjectives, that it was powerful alarmin'. For Heaven's sake, Mr.  Panther, the state of affairs ain't so bad as that, is it?\"    \"It certainly is,\" replied the Panther. \"Ned Fulton here was all through  their camp last night. He can talk Mexican an' Spanish like lightnin'  an' he makes up wonderful--an' he saw their whole army. He saw old Santa  Anna, too, an' fifty or a hundred generals, all covered with gold lace.  If we don't get a lot of fightin' men together an' get 'em quick, Texas  will be swept clean by that Mexican army same as if a field had been  crossed by millions of locusts.\"    It was obvious that Crockett was impressed deeply by these blunt  statements.    \"What do you wish us to do?\" he asked the Panther.    \"You an' your friends come with us. We've got some good men at a cabin  in the woods that we can reach to-night. We'll join with them, raise as  many more as we can, spread the alarm everywhere, an' do everything  possible for the defence of San Antonio.\"    \"A good plan, Mr. Panther,\" said Crocket. \"You lead the way to this  cabin of yours, an' remember that we're servin' under you for the time  bein'.\"    The Panther rode on without another word and the party, now raised from  three to sixteen, followed. Crockett fell in by the side of Ned, and  soon showed that he was not averse to talking.    \"A good country,\" he said, nodding at the landscape, \"but it ain't like  Tennessee. It would take me a long time to git used to the lack of hills  an' runnin' water an' trees which just cover the state of Tennessee.\"    \"We have them here, too,\" replied Ned, \"though I'll admit they're  scattered. But it's a grand country to fight for.\"    \"An' as I see it we'll have a grand lot of fightin' to do,\" said Davy  Crockett.    They continued at good speed until twilight, when they rested their  horses and ate of the food that they carried. The night promised to be  cold but clear, and the crisp air quickened their blood.    \"How much further is it?\" asked Crockett of Ned.    \"Fifteen or eighteen miles, but at the rate we're going we should be  there in three hours. We've got a roof. It isn't a big one, and we don't  know who built it, but it will shelter us all.\"    \"I ain't complainin' of that,\" rejoined Davy Crockett. \"I'm a lover of  fresh air an' outdoors, but I don't object to a roof in cold weather.  Always take your comfort, boy, when it's offered to you. It saves wear  an' tear.\"    A friendship like that between him and Bowie was established already  between Ned and Crockett. Ned's grave and serious manner, the result of  the sufferings through which he had gone, invariably attracted the  attention and liking of those far older than himself.    \"I'll remember your advice, Mr. Crockett,\" he said.    A rest of a half hour for the horses and they started riding rapidly.  After a while they struck the belt of forest and soon the cabin was not  more than a mile away. But the Panther, who was still in the lead,  pulled up his horse suddenly.    \"Boys,\" he exclaimed, \"did you hear that?\"    Every man stopped his horse also and with involuntary motion bent  forward a little to listen. Then the sound that the Panther had heard  came again. It was the faint ping of a rifle shot, muffled by the  distance. In a moment they heard another and then two more. The sounds  came from the direction of their cabin.    \"The boys are attacked,\" said the Panther calmly, \"an' it's just as well  that we've come fast. But I can't think who is after 'em. There was  certainly no Mexicans in these parts yesterday, an' Urrea could not  possibly have got ahead of us with a raidin' band. But at any rate we'll  ride on an' soon see.\"    They proceeded with the utmost caution, and they heard the faint ping of  the rifles a half dozen times as they advanced. The nostrils of the  Panther began to distend, and streaks of red appeared on his eyeballs.  He was smelling the battle afar, and his soul rejoiced. He had spent his  whole life amid scenes of danger, and this was nature to him. Crockett  rode up by his side, and he, too, listened eagerly. He no longer carried  Betsy over his shoulder but held the long rifle across the pommel of his  saddle, his hand upon hammer and trigger.    \"What do you think it is, Panther?\" he asked. Already he had fallen into  the easy familiarity of the frontier.    \"I can't make it out yet,\" replied the Panther, \"but them shots shorely  came from the cabin an' places about it. Our fellows are besieged, but  I've got to"]]]
