Someone had been here with  Rivers for some time; the dealer and another man had sat by the fire,  drinking and smoking. On the low table was a fifth of Haig & Haig, a  siphon, two glasses, a glass bowl containing water that had evidently  melted from ice-cubes, and an ashtray. In the ashtray were a number of  River's cigarette butts, all holder-crimped, and a quantity of ash, some  of it cigar-ash. There was no cigar-butt, and no band or cellophane  wrapper.    The fire on the hearth had burned out and the ashes were cold. They were  not all wood-ashes; a considerable amount of paper--no, cardboard--had  been burned there also. Poking gently with the point of a sword he took  from a rack, Rand discovered that what had been burned had been a number  of cards, about six inches by four, one of which had, somehow, managed to  escape the flames with nothing more than a charred edge. Improvising  tweezers from a pipe-cleaner, he picked this up and looked at it. It had  been typewritten:    4850:    English Screw-Barrel F/L Pocket Pistol. _Queen Anne type, side  hammer with pan attached to barrel, steel barrel and frame. Marked:  Wilson, Minories, London. Silver masque butt-cap, hallmarked for 1723.  4-1/2\" barrel; 9-1/4\" O.A.; cal. abt .44. Taken in trade, 3/21/'38, from  V. Sparling, for Kentuck #2538, along with 4851, 4852, 4853. App. cost,  RLss; Replacement, do. NLss, OSss, LSss._    To this had been added, in pen:    _Sold, R. Kingsley, St. Louis, Mo., Mail order, 12/20/'42, OSss._    Rand laid the card on the cocktail-table, along with the drinking  equipment. At least, he knew what had gone into the fire: Arnold Rivers's  card-index purchase and sales record. He doubted very strongly if that  would have been burned while its owner was still alive. Going over to the  desk, he checked; the drawer from which he had seen Cecil Gillis get the  card for the Leech & Rigdon had been cleaned out.    Picking up the phone in an awkward, unnatural manner, he used a pencil  from his pocket to dial a number with which he was familiar, a number  that meant the same thing on any telephone exchange in the state.    \"State Police, Corporal Kavaalen,\" a voice singsonged out of the  receiver.    \"My name is Rand,\" he identified himself. \"I am calling from Arnold  Rivers's antique-arms shop on Route 19, about a mile and a half east of  Rosemont. I am reporting a homicide.\"    \"Yeah, go ahead--Hey! Did you say homicide?\" the other voice asked  sharply. \"Who?\"    \"Rivers himself. I called at his shop a few minutes ago, found the front  door open, and walked in. I found Rivers lying dead on the floor, just  inside the door. He had been killed with a Mauser rifle--not shot;  clubbed with the butt, and bayoneted. The body is cold, beginning to  stiffen; a pool of blood on the floor is almost completely dried.\"    \"That's a good report, mister,\" the corporal approved. \"You stick around;  we'll be right along. You haven't touched anything, have you?\"    \"Not around the body. How long will it take you to get here?\"    \"About ten minutes. I'll tell Sergeant McKenna right away.\"    Rand hung up and glanced at his watch. Ten twenty-two; he gave himself  seven minutes and went around the room rapidly, looking only at pistols.  He saw nothing that might have come from the Fleming collection. Finally,  he opened the front door, just as a white State Police car was pulling up  at the end of the walk.    Sergeant Ignatius Loyola McKenna--customarily known and addressed as  Mick--piled out almost before it had stopped. The driver, a stocky,  blue-eyed Finn with a corporal's chevrons, followed him, and two privates  got out from behind, dragging after them a box about the size and shape  of an Army footlocker. McKenna was halfway up the drive before he  recognized Rand. Then he stopped short.    \"Well, Jaysus-me-beads!\" He turned suddenly to the corporal. \"My God,  Aarvo; you said his name was Grant!\"    \"That's what I thought he said.\" Rand recognized the singsong accent he  had heard on the phone. \"You know him?\"    \"Know him?\" McKenna stepped aside quickly, to avoid being overrun by the  two privates with the equipment-box. He sighed resignedly. \"Aarvo, this  is the notorious Jefferson Davis Rand. Tri-State Agency, in New Belfast.\"  He gestured toward the Finn. \"Corporal Aarvo Kavaalen,\" he introduced.  \"And Privates Skinner and Jameson.... Well, where is it?\"    \"Right inside.\" Rand stepped backward, gesturing them in. \"Careful; it's  just inside the doorway.\"    McKenna and the corporal entered; the two privates set down their box  outside and followed. They all drew up in a semicircle around the late  Arnold Rivers and looked at him critically.    \"Jesus!\" Kavaalen pronounced the _J_-sound as though it were _Zh_; he  gave all his syllables an equally-accented intonation. \"Say, somebody  gave him a good job!\"    \"Somebody's been seeing too many war-movies.\" McKenna got a cigarette out  of his tunic pocket and lit it in Rand's pipe-bowl. \"Want to confess now,  or do you insist on a third degree with all the trimmings?\"    Kavaalen looked wide-eyed at Rand, then at McKenna, and then back at  Rand. Rand laughed.    \"Now, Mick!\" he reproved. \"You know I never kill anybody unless I have  a clear case of self-defense, and a flock of witnesses to back it up.\"    McKenna nodded and reassured his corporal. \"That's right, Aarvo; when  Jeff Rand kills anybody, it's always self-defense. And he doesn't  generally make messes like this.\" He gave the body a brief scrutiny, then  turned to Rand. \"You looked around, of course; what do you make of it?\"    \"Last night, sometime,\" Rand reconstructed, \"Rivers had a visitor. A man,  who smoked cigars. He and Rivers were on friendly, or at least sociable,  terms. They sat back there by the fire for some time, smoking and  drinking. The shades were all drawn. I don't know whether that was  standard procedure, or because this conference was something clandestine.  Finally, Rivers's visitor got up to leave.    \"Now, of course, he could have left, and somebody else could have come  here later, been admitted, and killed Rivers. That's a possibility,\" Rand  said, \"but it's also an assumption without anything to support it. I  rather like the idea that the man who sat back there drinking and smoking  with Rivers was the killer. If so, Rivers must have gone with him to the  door and was about to open it when this fellow picked up that rifle,  probably from that rack, over there, and clipped him on the jaw with  the butt. Then he gave him the point three times, the second and third  probably while Rivers was down. Then he swung it up and slammed down with  it, and left it sticking through Rivers and in the floor.\"    McKenna nodded. \"Lights on when you got here?\" he asked.    \"No; I put them on when I came in. The killer must have turned them off  when he left, but the deadlatch on the door wasn't set, and he doesn't  seem to have bothered checking on that.\"    \"Think he left right after he killed Rivers?\"    Rand shook his head. \"No, that was just the first part of it. After he'd  finished Rivers, he went back to that desk and got all the cards Rivers  used to record his transactions on--an individual card for every item. He  destroyed the lot of them, or at least most of them, in the fireplace.  Now, I'm only guessing, here, but I think he took out a card or cards in  which he had some interest, and then dumped the rest in the fire to  prevent anybody from being able to determine which ones he was interested  in. I am further guessing that the cards which the killer wanted to  suppress were in the 'sold' file. But I am not guessing about the  destruction of the record-file; I found the fireplace full of ashes,  found one card that had escaped unburned--you can be sure that one  wasn't important--and found the drawer where the record-system was kept  empty.\"    \"Think he might have stolen something, and covered up by burning the  cards?\" McKenna asked.    Rand shook his head again. \"I was here yesterday; bought a pistol from  Rivers. That's how I noticed this card-index system. Of course, I didn't  look at everything, while I was here, but I can't see where any quantity  of arms have been removed, and Rivers didn't have any single item that  was worth a murder. Fact is, no old firearm is. There are only a very few  old arms that are worth over a thousand dollars, and most of them are  well-known, unique specimens that would be unsaleable because every  collector would know where it came from.\"    \"We can check possible thefts with Rivers's clerk, when he gets here,\"  McKenna said. \"Now, suppose you show me these things you found, back at  the rear ... Aarvo, you and the boys start taking pictures,\" he told  the corporal, then he followed Rand back through the shop.    He tested the temperature of the water in the ice-bowl with his finger.  He looked at the ashtray, and bent over and sniffed at each of the two  glasses.    \"I see one of them's been emptied out,\" he commented. \"Want to bet it  hasn't been wiped clean, too?\"    \"Huh-unh.\" Rand smiled slightly. \"Even the tiny tots wipe off the  cookie-jar, after they've raided it,\" he said.    A flash-bulb lit the front of the shop briefly. Corporal Kavaalen said  something to the others. McKenna picked up the card Rand had found by the  edges and looked at it.    \"What in hell's this all about, Jeff?\" he asked.    \"Rivers made it out for one of his pistols. An English flintlock  pocket-pistol; I can show you one almost like it, up front. He'd gotten  it and three others, back in 1938, in trade for a Kentucky rifle. The  numbers are reference-numbers; the letters are Rivers's private  price-code. Those three at the end are, respectively, what he absolutely  had to get for it, what he thought was a reasonable price, and the most  he thought the traffic would"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17897"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part I-II (Pars Prima Secundae) (#17)"],[1,"for them that love  Him.\" Therefore man cannot attain Happiness by his natural powers.    _I answer that,_ Imperfect happiness that can be had in this life,  can be acquired by man by his natural powers, in the same way as  virtue, in whose operation it consists: on this point we shall speak  further on (Q. 63). But man's perfect Happiness, as stated above (Q.  3, A. 8), consists in the vision of the Divine Essence. Now the  vision of God's Essence surpasses the nature not only of man, but  also of every creature, as was shown in the First Part (Q. 12, A. 4).  For the natural knowledge of every creature is in keeping with the  mode of his substance: thus it is said of the intelligence (De  Causis; Prop. viii) that \"it knows things that are above it, and  things that are below it, according to the mode of its substance.\"  But every knowledge that is according to the mode of created  substance, falls short of the vision of the Divine Essence, which  infinitely surpasses all created substance. Consequently neither man,  nor any creature, can attain final Happiness by his natural powers.    Reply Obj. 1: Just as nature does not fail man in necessaries,  although it has not provided him with weapons and clothing, as it  provided other animals, because it gave him reason and hands, with  which he is able to get these things for himself; so neither did it  fail man in things necessary, although it gave him not the wherewithal  to attain Happiness: since this it could not do. But it did give him  free-will, with which he can turn to God, that He may make him happy.  \"For what we do by means of our friends, is done, in a sense, by  ourselves\" (Ethic. iii, 3).    Reply Obj. 2: The nature that can attain perfect good, although it  needs help from without in order to attain it, is of more noble  condition than a nature which cannot attain perfect good, but attains  some imperfect good, although it need no help from without in order  to attain it, as the Philosopher says (De Coel. ii, 12). Thus he is  better disposed to health who can attain perfect health, albeit by  means of medicine, than he who can attain but imperfect health,  without the help of medicine. And therefore the rational creature,  which can attain the perfect good of happiness, but needs the Divine  assistance for the purpose, is more perfect than the irrational  creature, which is not capable of attaining this good, but attains  some imperfect good by its natural powers.    Reply Obj. 3: When imperfect and perfect are of the same species,  they can be caused by the same power. But this does not follow of  necessity, if they be of different species: for not everything, that  can cause the disposition of matter, can produce the final  perfection. Now the imperfect operation, which is subject to man's  natural power, is not of the same species as that perfect operation  which is man's happiness: since operation takes its species from its  object. Consequently the argument does not prove.  ________________________    SIXTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 5, Art. 6]    Whether Man Attains Happiness Through the Action of Some Higher  Creature?    Objection 1: It would seem that man can be made happy through the  action of some higher creature, viz. an angel. For since we observe a  twofold order in things--one, of the parts of the universe to one  another, the other, of the whole universe to a good which is outside  the universe; the former order is ordained to the second as to its end  (Metaph. xii, 10). Thus the mutual order of the parts of an army is  dependent on the order of the parts of an army is dependent on the  order of the whole army to the general. But the mutual order of the  parts of the universe consists in the higher creatures acting on the  lower, as stated in the First Part (Q. 109, A. 2): while happiness  consists in the order of man to a good which is outside the universe,  i.e. God. Therefore man is made happy, through a higher creature, viz.  an angel, acting on him.    Obj. 2: Further, that which is such in potentiality, can be reduced  to act, by that which is such actually: thus what is potentially hot,  is made actually hot, by something that is actually hot. But man is  potentially happy. Therefore he can be made actually happy by an  angel who is actually happy.    Obj. 3: Further, Happiness consists in an operation of the intellect  as stated above (Q. 3, A. 4). But an angel can enlighten man's  intellect as shown in the First Part (Q. 111, A. 1). Therefore an  angel can make a man happy.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Ps. 83:12): \"The Lord will give  grace and glory.\"    _I answer that,_ Since every creature is subject to the laws of  nature, from the very fact that its power and action are limited:  that which surpasses created nature, cannot be done by the power of  any creature. Consequently if anything need to be done that is above  nature, it is done by God immediately; such as raising the dead to  life, restoring sight to the blind, and such like. Now it has been  shown above (A. 5) that Happiness is a good surpassing created  nature. Therefore it is impossible that it be bestowed through the  action of any creature: but by God alone is man made happy, if we  speak of perfect Happiness. If, however, we speak of imperfect  happiness, the same is to be said of it as of the virtue, in whose  act it consists.    Reply Obj. 1: It often happens in the case of active powers ordained  to one another, that it belongs to the highest power to reach the  last end, while the lower powers contribute to the attainment of that  last end, by causing a disposition thereto: thus to the art of  sailing, which commands the art of shipbuilding, it belongs to use a  ship for the end for which it was made. Thus, too, in the order of  the universe, man is indeed helped by the angels in the attainment of  his last end, in respect of certain preliminary dispositions thereto:  whereas he attains the last end itself through the First Agent, which  is God.    Reply Obj. 2: When a form exists perfectly and naturally in  something, it can be the principle of action on something else: for  instance a hot thing heats through heat. But if a form exist in  something imperfectly, and not naturally, it cannot be the principle  whereby it is communicated to something else: thus the _intention_ of  color which is in the pupil, cannot make a thing white; nor indeed  can everything enlightened or heated give heat or light to something  else; for if they could, enlightening and heating would go on to  infinity. But the light of glory, whereby God is seen, is in God  perfectly and naturally; whereas in any creature, it is imperfectly  and by likeness or participation. Consequently no creature can  communicate its Happiness to another.    Reply Obj. 3: A happy angel enlightens the intellect of a man or of a  lower angel, as to certain notions of the Divine works: but not as to  the vision of the Divine Essence, as was stated in the First Part (Q.  106, A. 1): since in order to see this, all are immediately  enlightened by God.  ________________________    SEVENTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 5, Art. 7]    Whether Any Good Works Are Necessary That Man May Receive Happiness  from God?    Objection 1: It would seem that no works of man are necessary that he  may obtain Happiness from God. For since God is an agent of infinite  power, He requires before acting, neither matter, nor disposition of  matter, but can forthwith produce the whole effect. But man's works,  since they are not required for Happiness, as the efficient cause  thereof, as stated above (A. 6), can be required only as  dispositions thereto. Therefore God who does not require dispositions  before acting, bestows Happiness without any previous works.    Obj. 2: Further, just as God is the immediate cause of Happiness, so  is He the immediate cause of nature. But when God first established  nature, He produced creatures without any previous disposition or  action on the part of the creature, but made each one perfect  forthwith in its species. Therefore it seems that He bestows  Happiness on man without any previous works.    Obj. 3: Further, the Apostle says (Rom. 4:6) that Happiness is of the  man \"to whom God reputeth justice without works.\" Therefore no works  of man are necessary for attaining Happiness.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (John 13:17): \"If you know these  things, you shall be blessed if you do them.\" Therefore Happiness is  obtained through works.    _I answer that,_ Rectitude of the will, as stated above (Q. 4, A. 4),  is necessary for Happiness; since it is nothing else than the right  order of the will to the last end; and it is therefore necessary for  obtaining the end, just as the right disposition of matter, in order  to receive the form. But this does not prove that any work of man  need precede his Happiness: for God could make a will having a right  tendency to the end, and at the same time attaining the end; just as  sometimes He disposes matter and at the same time introduces the  form. But the order of Divine wisdom demands that it should not be  thus; for as is stated in _De Coelo_ ii, 12, \"of those things that  have a natural capacity for the perfect good, one has it without  movement, some by one movement, some by several.\" Now to possess the  perfect good without movement, belongs to that which has it  naturally: and to have Happiness naturally belongs to God alone.  Therefore it belongs to God alone not to be moved towards Happiness  by any previous operation. Now since Happiness surpasses every  created nature, no pure creature can becomingly gain Happiness,  without the movement of operation, whereby it tends thereto. But the  angel, who is above man in the natural order, obtained it, according  to the order of Divine wisdom, by one movement of a meritorious work,  as was explained in the First Part (Q. 62, A. 5); whereas man obtains  it by many movements of works which"]]]
