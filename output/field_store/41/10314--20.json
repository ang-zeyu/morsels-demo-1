[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1557"],[0,"Men of Iron (#17)"],[1,"in the  crisp brown autumn grass of the paddock, and shooting with the long-bow  at wildfowl, which, when the east wind was straining, flew low overhead  to pitch to the lake in the forbidden precincts of the deer park beyond  the brow of the hill. More than once a brace or two of these wildfowl,  shot in their southward flight by the lads and cooked by fat,  good-natured Mother Joan, graced the rude mess-table of the squires in  the long hall, and even the toughest and fishiest drake, so the fruit  of their skill, had a savor that, somehow or other, the daintiest fare  lacked in after-years.    Then fall passed and winter came, bleak, cold, and dreary--not winter as  we know it nowadays, with warm fires and bright lights to make the long  nights sweet and cheerful with comfort, but winter with all its grimness  and sternness. In the great cold stone-walled castles of those days the  only fire and almost the only light were those from the huge blazing  logs that roared and crackled in the great open stone fireplace, around  which the folks gathered, sheltering their faces as best they could from  the scorching heat, and cloaking their shoulders from the biting cold,  for at the farther end of the room, where giant shadows swayed and  bowed and danced huge and black against the high walls, the white frost  glistened in the moonlight on the stone pavements, and the breath went  up like smoke.    In those days were no books to read, but at the best only rude stories  and jests, recited by some strolling mummer or minstrel to the listening  circle, gathered around the blaze and welcoming the coarse, gross jests,  and coarser, grosser songs with roars of boisterous laughter.    Yet bleak and dreary as was the winter in those days, and cold and  biting as was the frost in the cheerless, windy halls and corridors of  the castle, it was not without its joys to the young lads; for then, as  now, boys could find pleasure even in slushy weather, when the sodden  snow is fit for nothing but to make snowballs of.    Thrice that bitter winter the moat was frozen over, and the lads, making  themselves skates of marrow-bones, which they bought from the hall cook  at a groat a pair, went skimming over the smooth surface, red-checked  and shouting, while the crows and the jackdaws looked down at them from  the top of the bleak gray walls.    Then at Yule-tide, which was somewhat of a rude semblance to the Merry  Christmas season of our day, a great feast was held in the hall, and all  the castle folk were fed in the presence of the Earl and the Countess.  Oxen and sheep were roasted whole; huge suet puddings, made of barley  meal sweetened with honey and stuffed with plums, were boiled in great  caldrons in the open courtyard; whole barrels of ale and malmsey were  broached, and all the folk, gentle and simple, were bidden to the feast.  Afterwards the minstrels danced and played a rude play, and in the  evening a miracle show was performed on a raised platform in the north  hall.    For a week afterwards the castle was fed upon the remains of the good  things left from that great feast, until everyone grew to loathe fine  victuals, and longed for honest beef and mustard again.    Then at last in that constant change the winter was gone, and even the  lads who had enjoyed its passing were glad when the winds blew warm once  more, and the grass showed green in sunny places, and the leader of the  wild-fowl blew his horn, as they who in the fall had flown to the south  flew, arrow-like, northward again; when the buds swelled and the leaves  burst forth once more, and crocuses and then daffodils gleamed in the  green grass, like sparks and flames of gold.    With the spring came the out-door sports of the season; among others  that of ball--for boys were boys, and played at ball even in those  faraway days--a game called trap-ball. Even yet in some parts of England  it is played just as it was in Myles Falworth's day, and enjoyed just as  Myles and his friends enjoyed it.    So now that the sun was warm and the weather pleasant the game of  trap-ball was in full swing every afternoon, the play-ground being an  open space between the wall that surrounded the castle grounds and that  of the privy garden--the pleasance in which the ladies of the Earl's  family took the air every day, and upon which their apartments opened.    Now one fine breezy afternoon, when the lads were shouting and playing  at this, then their favorite game, Myles himself was at the trap  barehanded and barearmed. The wind was blowing from behind him, and,  aided perhaps by it, he had already struck three of four balls nearly  the whole length of the court--an unusual distance--and several of the  lads had gone back almost as far as the wall of the privy garden to  catch any ball that might chance to fly as far as that. Then once more  Myles struck, throwing all his strength into the blow. The ball shot up  into the air, and when it fell, it was to drop within the privy garden.    The shouts of the young players were instantly stilled, and Gascoyne,  who stood nearest Myles, thrust his hands into his belt, giving a long  shrill whistle.    \"This time thou hast struck us all out, Myles,\" said he. \"There be no  more play for us until we get another ball.\"    The outfielders came slowly trooping in until they had gathered in a  little circle around Myles.    \"I could not help it,\" said Myles, in answer to their grumbling. \"How  knew I the ball would fly so far? But if I ha' lost the ball, I can get  it again. I will climb the wall for it.\"    \"Thou shalt do naught of the kind, Myles,\" said Gascoyne, hastily.  \"Thou art as mad as a March hare to think of such a venture! Wouldst get  thyself shot with a bolt betwixt the ribs, like poor Diccon Cook?\"    Of all places about the castle the privy garden was perhaps the most  sacred. It was a small plot of ground, only a few rods long and wide,  and was kept absolutely private for the use of the Countess and her  family. Only a little while before Myles had first come to Devlen,  one of the cook's men had been found climbing the wall, whereupon the  soldier who saw him shot him with his cross bow. The poor fellow dropped  from the wall into the garden, and when they found him, he still held  a bunch of flowers in his hand, which he had perhaps been gathering for  his sweetheart.    Had Myles seen him carried on a litter to the infirmary as Gascoyne  and some of the others had done, he might have thought twice before  venturing to enter the ladies' private garden. As it was, he only shook  his stubborn head, and said again, \"I will climb the wall and fetch it.\"    Now at the lower extremity of the court, and about twelve or fifteen  feet distant from the garden wall, there grew a pear-tree, some of the  branches of which overhung into the garden beyond. So, first making sure  that no one was looking that way, and bidding the others keep a sharp  lookout, Myles shinned up this tree, and choosing one of the thicker  limbs, climbed out upon it for some little distance. Then lowering his  body, he hung at arm's-length, the branch bending with his weight, and  slowly let himself down hand under hand, until at last he hung directly  over the top of the wall, and perhaps a foot above it. Below him he  could see the leafy top of an arbor covered with a thick growth of  clematis, and even as he hung there he noticed the broad smooth  walks, the grassy terrace in front of the Countess's apartments in the  distance, the quaint flower-beds, the yew-trees trimmed into odd shapes,  and even the deaf old gardener working bare-armed in the sunlight at a  flower-bed in the far corner by the tool-house.    The top of the wall was pointed like a house roof, and immediately below  him was covered by a thick growth of green moss, and it flashed through  his mind as he hung there that maybe it would offer a very slippery  foothold for one dropping upon the steep slopes of the top. But it was  too late to draw back now.    Bracing himself for a moment, he loosed his hold upon the limb above.  The branch flew back with a rush, and he dropped, striving to grasp the  sloping angle with his feet. Instantly the treacherous slippery moss  slid away from beneath him; he made a vain clutch at the wall, his  fingers sliding over the cold stones, then, with a sharp exclamation,  down he pitched bodily into the garden beneath! A thousand thoughts  flew through his brain like a cloud of flies, and then a leafy greenness  seemed to strike up against him. A splintering crash sounded in his  ears as the lattice top of the arbor broke under him, and with one final  clutch at the empty air he fell heavily upon the ground beneath.    He heard a shrill scream that seemed to find an instant echo; even as  he fell he had a vision of faces and bright colors, and when he sat up,  dazed and bewildered, he found himself face to face with the Lady Anne,  the daughter of the house, and her cousin, the Lady Alice, who clutching  one another tightly, stood staring at him with wide scared eyes.        CHAPTER 18    For a little time there was a pause of deep silence, during which the  fluttering leaves came drifting down from the broken arbor above.    It was the Lady Anne who first spoke. \"Who art thou, and whence comest  thou?\" said she, tremulously.    Then Myles gathered himself up sheepishly. \"My name is Myles Falworth,\"  said he, \"and I am one of the squires of the body.\"    \"Oh! aye!\" said the Lady Alice, suddenly. \"Me thought I knew thy face.  Art thou not the young man that I have seen in Lord George's train?\"    \"Yes, lady,\" said Myles, wrapping and twining a piece of the broken vine  in and out among his fingers. \"Lord George hath often had me of late  about his person.\"    \"And what dost thou do here, sirrah?\" said Lady Anne, angrily. \"How  darest thou come so into our garden?\"    \"I meant not to come as I did,\" said Myles, clumsily, and with a face  hot "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15580"],[0,"The Rustlers of Pecos County (#17)"],[1,",\" I burst out. \"Let me show you.\"    Deftly I made the dealer's guilt plain to all, and then I seconded the  cattleman's angry claim for lost money. The players from other tables  gathered round, curious, muttering.    And just then Martin strolled in. His appearance was not prepossessing.    \"What's this holler?\" he asked, and halted as he saw the cattleman's gun  still in line with the dealer.    \"Martin, you know what it's for,\" replied Steele. \"Take your dealer and  dig--unless you want to see me clean out your place.\"    Sullen and fierce, Martin stood looking from Steele to the cattleman  and then the dealer. Some men in the crowd muttered, and that was a  signal for Steele to shove the circle apart and get out, back to the  wall.    The cattleman rose slowly in the center, pulling another gun, and he  certainly looked business to me.    \"Wal, Ranger, I reckon I'll hang round an' see you ain't bothered none,\"  he said. \"Friend,\" he went on, indicating me with a slight wave of one  extended gun, \"jest rustle the money in sight. We'll square up after the  show.\"    I reached out and swept the considerable sum toward me, and, pocketing  it, I too rose, ready for what might come.    \"You-all give me elbow room!\" yelled Steele at Martin and his cowed  contingent.    Steele looked around, evidently for some kind of implement, and, espying  a heavy ax in a corner, he grasped it, and, sweeping it to and fro as if  it had been a buggy-whip, he advanced on the faro layout. The crowd fell  back, edging toward the door.    One crashing blow wrecked the dealer's box and table, sending them  splintering among the tumbled chairs. Then the giant Ranger began to  spread further ruin about him.    Martin's place was rough and bare, of the most primitive order, and like  a thousand other dens of its kind, consisted of a large room with adobe  walls, a rude bar of boards, piles of kegs in a corner, a stove, and a  few tables with chairs.    Steele required only one blow for each article he struck, and he  demolished it. He stove in the head of each keg.    When the dark liquor gurgled out, Martin cursed, and the crowd followed  suit. That was a loss!    The little cattleman, holding the men covered, backed them out of the  room, Martin needing a plain, stern word to put him out entirely. I went  out, too, for I did not want to miss any moves on the part of that gang.    Close behind me came the cattleman, the kind of cool, nervy Texan I  liked. He had Martin well judged, too, for there was no evidence of any  bold resistance.    But there were shouts and loud acclamations; and these, with the  crashing blows of Steele's ax, brought a curious and growing addition to  the crowd.    Soon sodden thuds from inside the saloon and red dust pouring out the  door told that Steele was attacking the walls of Martin's place. Those  adobe bricks when old and crumbly were easily demolished.    Steele made short work of the back wall, and then he smashed out half of  the front of the building. That seemed to satisfy him.    When he stepped out of the dust he was wet with sweat, dirty, and  disheveled, hot with his exertion--a man whose great stature and  muscular development expressed a wonderful physical strength and energy.  And his somber face, with the big gray eyes, like open furnaces,  expressed a passion equal to his strength.    Perhaps only then did wild and lawless Linrock grasp the real  significance of this Ranger.    Steele threw the ax at Martin's feet.    \"Martin, don't reopen here,\" he said curtly. \"Don't start another place  in Linrock. If you do--jail at Austin for years.\"    Martin, livid and scowling, yet seemingly dazed with what had occurred,  slunk away, accompanied by his cronies. Steele took the money I had  appropriated, returned to me what I had lost, did likewise with the  cattleman, and then, taking out the sum named by Mrs. Price, he divided  the balance with the other players who had been in the game.    Then he stalked off through the crowd as if he knew that men who slunk  from facing him would not have nerve enough to attack him even from  behind.    \"Wal, damn me!\" ejaculated the little cattleman in mingled admiration  and satisfaction. \"So thet's that Texas Ranger, Steele, hey? Never seen  him before. All Texas, thet Ranger!\"    I lingered downtown as much to enjoy the sensation as to gain the  different points of view.    No doubt about the sensation! In one hour every male resident of  Linrock and almost every female had viewed the wreck of Martin's place.  A fire could not have created half the excitement.    And in that excitement both men and women gave vent to speech they might  not have voiced at a calmer moment. The women, at least, were not afraid  to talk, and I made mental note of the things they said.    \"Did he do it all alone?\"    \"Thank God a _man's_ come to Linrock.\"    \"Good for Molly Price!\"    \"Oh, it'll make bad times for Linrock.\"    It almost seemed that all the women were glad, and this was in itself a  vindication of the Ranger's idea of law.    The men, however--Blandy, proprietor of the Hope So, and others of his  ilk, together with the whole brood of idle gaming loungers, and in fact  even storekeepers, ranchers, cowboys--all shook their heads sullenly or  doubtfully.    Striking indeed now was the absence of any joking. Steele had showed his  hand, and, as one gambler said: \"It's a hard hand to call.\"    The truth was, this Ranger Service was hateful to the free-and-easy  Texan who lived by anything except hard and honest work, and it was  damnably hateful to the lawless class. Steele's authority, now obvious  to all, was unlimited; it could go as far as he had power to carry it.    From present indications that power might be considerable. The work of  native sheriffs and constables in western Texas had been a farce, an  utter failure. If an honest native of a community undertook to be a  sheriff he became immediately a target for rowdy cowboys and other  vicious elements.    Many a town south and west of San Antonio owed its peace and prosperity  to Rangers, and only to them. They had killed or driven out the  criminals. They interpreted the law for themselves, and it was only such  an attitude toward law--the stern, uncompromising, implacable  extermination of the lawless--that was going to do for all Texas what it  had done for part.    Steele was the driving wedge that had begun to split Linrock--split the  honest from dominance by the dishonest. To be sure, Steele might be  killed at any moment, and that contingency was voiced in the growl of  one sullen man who said: \"Wot the hell are we up against? Ain't somebody  goin' to plug this Ranger?\"    It was then that the thing for which Steele stood, the Ranger  Service--to help, to save, to defend, to punish, with such somber menace  of death as seemed embodied in his cold attitude toward resistance--took  hold of Linrock and sunk deep into both black and honest hearts.    It was what was behind Steele that seemed to make him more than an  officer--a man.    I could feel how he began to loom up, the embodiment of a powerful  force--the Ranger Service--the fame of which, long known to this lawless  Pecos gang, but scouted as a vague and distant thing, now became an  actuality, a Ranger in the flesh, whose surprising attributes included  both the law and the enforcement of it.    When I reached the ranch the excitement had preceded me. Miss Sampson  and Sally, both talking at once, acquainted me with the fact that they  had been in a store on the main street a block or more from Martin's  place.    They had seen the crowd, heard the uproar; and, as they had been  hurriedly started toward home by their attendant Dick, they had  encountered Steele stalking by.    \"He looked grand!\" exclaimed Sally.    Then I told the girls the whole story in detail.    \"Russ, is it true, just as you tell it?\" inquired Diane earnestly.    \"Absolutely. I know Mrs. Price went to Steele with her trouble. I was in  Martin's place when he entered. Also I was playing in the crooked game.  And I saw him wreck Martin's place. Also, I heard him forbid Martin to  start another place in Linrock.\"    \"Then he does do splendid things,\" she said softly, as if affirming to  herself.    I walked on then, having gotten a glimpse of Colonel Sampson in the  background. Before I reached the corrals Sally came running after me,  quite flushed and excited.    \"Russ, my uncle wants to see you,\" she said. \"He's in a bad temper.  Don't lose yours, please.\"    She actually took my hand. What a child she was, in all ways except that  fatal propensity to flirt. Her statement startled me out of any further  thought of her. Why did Sampson want to see me? He never noticed me. I  dreaded facing him--not from fear, but because I must see more and more  of the signs of guilt in Diane's father.    He awaited me on the porch. As usual, he wore riding garb, but evidently  he had not been out so far this day. He looked worn. There was a furtive  shadow in his eyes. The haughty, imperious temper, despite Sally's  conviction, seemed to be in abeyance.    \"Russ, what's this I hear about Martin's saloon being cleaned out?\" he  asked. \"Dick can't give particulars.\"    Briefly and concisely I told the colonel exactly what had happened. He  chewed his cigar, then spat it out with an unintelligible exclamation.    \"Martin's no worse than others,\" he said. \"Blandy leans to crooked faro.  I've tried to stop that, anyway. If Steele can, more power to him!\"    Sampson turned on his heel then and left me with a queer feeling of  surprise and pity.    He had surprised me before, but he had never roused the least sympathy.  It was probably that Sampson was indeed powerless, no matter what his  position.    I had known men before who had become involved in crime, yet were too  manly to sanction a crookedness they could not help.    Miss Sampson had been standing in her door. I could tell she"]]]
