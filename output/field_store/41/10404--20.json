Up and up it still went, with  poor Snoop dangling helplessly at the end of the swaying tail.    At last Bert ran past the old barn which I have already mentioned. Just  as he did this he happened to look up at the kite.    \"Hullo, what's on the tail?\" he yelled. \"Is that a cat?\"    \"It's Snoop!\" called out Freddie, who was rushing after his big brother.  \"Oh, Bert, do let him down. If he falls, he'll be killed.\"    \"Well, I never!\" ejaculated Bert.    He stopped running and gradually the kite began to settle close to the  top of the barn. Poor Snoop was swinging violently at the end of the  ragged tail. The swinging brought the frightened creature closer still  to the barn, and all of a sudden Snoop let go of the kite tail and  landed on the shingles.    \"Snoop is on the barn!\" cried Bert, as the kite settled on the grass a  few yards away.    \"Oh, Snoop! Snoop! are you hurt?\" cried Freddie, running back a  distance, so that he might get a view of the barn top.    Evidently Snoop was not hurt. But he was still scared, for he stood on  the edge of the roof, with his tail standing straight up.    \"Meow! meow! meow!\" he said plaintively.    \"He is asking for somebody to take him down,\" said Freddie. \"Aren't you,  Snoop?\"    \"Meow!\" answered the black kitten.    \"Oh, dear me, what will you do now?\" cried Flossie, as she came chasing  up.    \"Perhaps I can get to the roof from the inside,\" said Bert, and he  darted quickly into the barn.    There were a rickety pair of stairs leading to the barn loft and these  he mounted. In the loft all was dark and full of cobwebs. Here and there  were small holes through the roof, through which the water came every  time it rained.    \"Snoop! Snoop!\" he called, putting his mouth close to one of the holes.    The kitten turned around in surprise. He hardly knew from whence the  voice came, but he evidently knew Bert was calling, for he soon came in  that direction.    As the barn was an old one and not fit to use, Bert felt it would do no  harm to knock a shingle or two from the roof. Looking around, he espied  a stout stick of wood lying on the floor and with this he began an  attack on the shingles and soon had two of them broken away.    \"Come, Snoop!\" he called, looking out of the hole. \"Come here!\"    But the sound of the blows had frightened the kitten, and Snoop had fled  to the slope of the roof on the opposite side of the barn.    \"Where is he?\" called the boy, to the twins below.    \"Gone to the other side,\" said Freddie. \"Don't like the noise, I guess.\"    \"Chase him over here,\" returned Bert.    Both Freddie and Flossie tried to do so. But Snoop would not budge, but  stood on the very edge of the roof, as if meditating a spring to the  ground.    \"Don't jump, please don't jump, Snoop!\" pleaded Flossie. \"If you jump  you'll surely break a leg, or maybe your back!\"    Whether Snoop understood this or not, it would be hard to say. But he  did not jump, only stayed where he was and meowed louder than ever.    \"Can't you drive him over?\" asked Bert, after a long wait.    \"Won't come,\" said Freddie. \"Wants to jump down, I guess.\"    Hearing this, Bert ran down to the lower floor and outside.    \"Can't you get a ladder?\" asked Flossie. \"Perhaps Mr. Roscoe will lend  you one.\"    Mr. Roscoe lived at the other end of the common. He was a very old and  very quiet man, and the majority of the girls and boys in Lakeport were  afraid of him. He lived all alone and was thought to be queer.    \"I--I can see,\" said Bert hesitatingly.    He ran across the common to Mr. Roscoe's house and rapped on the door.  Nobody came and he rapped again, and then a third time.    \"Who's there?\" asked a voice from within.    \"Please, Mr. Roscoe, is that you?\" asked Bert.    \"Yes.\"    \"Well, our kitten is on the top of your old barn and can't get down. Can  you lend me a ladder to get him down with?\"    \"Kitten on my barn? How did he get there?\" and now the old man opened  the door slowly and cautiously. He was bent with age and had white hair  and a long white beard.    \"He went up with a kite,\" said Bert, and explained the case, to which  the old man listened with interest.    \"Well! well! well!\" exclaimed Mr. Roscoe, in a high piping voice. \"Going  to take a sail through the air, was he? You'll have to build him a  balloon, eh?\"    \"I think he had better stay on the ground after this.\"    \"He must be a high-flyer of a cat,\" and the old man chuckled over his  joke.    \"Will you lend me a ladder?\" went on Bert.    \"Certainly, my lad. The ladder is in the cow-shed yonder. But you'll  have to raise it yourself, or get somebody to raise it for you. My back  is too old and stiff for such work.\"    \"I'll try it alone first,\" answered the boy.    He soon had the long ladder out and was dragging it across the common.  It was very heavy and he wondered who he could get to help him raise it.  Just then Danny Rugg came along.    \"What are you doing with old Roscoe's ladder?\" he asked.    Bert was on the point of telling Danny it was none of his business, but  he paused and reflected. He wanted no more quarrels with the big boy.    \"I am going to get our cat down from the barn roof,\" he answered.    \"Humph!\"    \"Do you want to help me raise the ladder, Danny?\"    \"Me? Not much! You can raise your own ladder.\"    \"All right, I will, if you don't want to help me,\" said Bert, the blood  rushing to his face.    \"So that's your cat, is it?\" cried Danny, looking toward the barn. \"I  wouldn't have such a black beast as that! We've got a real Maltese at  our house.\"    \"We like Snoop very much,\" answered Bert, and went on with his ladder.    Danny hunted for a stone, and watching his chance threw it at Snoop. It  landed close to the kitten's side and made Snoop run to the other side  of the barn roof.    \"Stop that, Danny Rugg!\" cried a voice from the other end of the common,  and Nan appeared. She had just heard about the happening to Snoop and  was hurrying to the spot to see if she could be of assistance.    \"Oh, go on with your old cat!\" sneered Danny, and shuffled off past Mr.  Roscoe's house.    The old man had come out to see what Bert was going to do with the  ladder, and now he came face to face with Danny Rugg.    \"Well, is it possible!\" murmured the old man to himself. \"That boy must  belong around here after all!\"    When Bert reached the barn he found a dozen boys collected, and several  volunteered to assist him in raising the long ladder. It was hard work,  and once the ladder slipped, but in the end it rested against the barn  roof and then Bert went up in a hurry.    \"Come, Snoop!\" he called, and the kitten came and perched himself on  Bert's shoulder.    When Bert came down the ladder those standing around set up a cheer, and  Freddie and Flossie clapped their hands in delight.    \"Oh, I'm so glad you got him back!\" said Freddie and hugged the kitten  almost to death.    \"What boy was that who threw the stone?\" asked Mr. Roscoe of Nan, while  Bert was returning the ladder to the cow-shed.    \"That was Danny Rugg,\" answered Nan. \"He is a bad boy.\"    \"I know he is a bad boy,\" said Mr. Roscoe. \"A very bad boy indeed.\" And  then the old man hurried off without another word. What he said meant a  good deal, as we shall soon see.          CHAPTER XXII    THE LAST OF THE GHOST--GOOD-NIGHT      The rescue of the kitten was the main subject of conversation that  evening in the Bobbsey household.    \"I never dreamed he would go up with the kite,\" said Flossie. \"After  this we'll have to keep him in the house when Bert and Freddie do their  kite-flying.\"    Bert had seen Danny Rugg throw the stone at the kitten and was very  angry over it. He had also seen Danny talk to Nan.    \"I think he's an awful boy,\" declared Nan. \"And Mr. Roscoe thinks he is  bad, too.\"    \"He had better stop throwing things or he'll get himself into trouble  before long,\" said Bert.    \"It's queer Mr. Ringley never heard about the window,\" whispered his  twin sister.    \"So it is. But it may come out yet,\" replied the brother.    That evening the Bobbseys had their first strawberry shortcake of the  season. It was a beautiful cake--one of Dinah's best--and the  strawberries were large and luscious.    \"Want another piece,\" said Freddie, smacking his lips. \"It's so good,  mamma!\"    \"Freddie, I think you have had enough,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.    \"Oh, mamma, just a little piece more!\" pleaded Freddie, and received the  piece, much to his satisfaction.    \"Strawberries is beautiful,\" he declared. \"I'm going to raise a whole  lot on the farm this summer.\"    \"Oh, mamma, are we going to Uncle Dan's farm this summer?\" burst out Nan  eagerly.    \"Perhaps, Nan,\" was the reply. \"I expect a letter very shortly.\"    \"Meadow Brook is a dandy place,\" said Bert. \"Such a fine swimming hole  in the brook!\"    \"Oh, I love the flowers, and the chickens and cows!\" said Flossie.    \"I like the rides on the loads of hay,\" said Nan.    The children talked the subject over until it was time to go to bed.  Their Uncle Dan and Aunt Sarah lived at Meadow Brook, and so did their  cousin Harry, a boy a little older than Bert, and one who was full of  fun and very good-natured in the bargain.    Bert went to bed with his head full of plans for the summer. What  glorious times they could have after school closed if they went to their  uncle's farm!    It was a full hour before Bert got to sleep. The room was quite bright,  for the moon was shining in the corner window. The moon made him think  of the ghost he had once seen and he gave a little shudder. He never  wanted to see that ghost again.    Bert had been asleep less than an hour when he awoke with a start. He  felt sure somebody had touched him on the foot. He opened his eyes at  once and looked toward the end of his bed.    _The ghost was standing there!_    At first Bert could scarcely believe that he saw aright. But it was true  and he promptly dove under the covers.    Then he"]]]
