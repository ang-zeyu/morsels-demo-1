One of the College servants, on  entering Mr. Maguire's rooms to call him, found that gentleman half  dressed and lying on the floor.    \"Terrified beyond measure, the servant bent over him and discovered he  was dead, obviously stabbed with the same weapon that had put an end to  Bob Anderson.    \"The factotum at once gave the alarm. Everyone in the College came  trooping to the room, and for the second time within three days a  general hue and cry was raised. All, again, to no purpose--the murderer  had left no traces as to his identity. However, one thing at least was  established, and that was the innocence of Dean Kelly and Denis  O'Farroll. They were both liberated.    \"Then Hartnoll, who seems to have been a regular Sherlock Holmes, got to  work in grim earnest. On the floor in Maguire's room he picked up a  diminutive silver-topped pencil, which had rolled under the fender and  had so escaped observation. He asked several of Maguire's most intimate  friends if they remembered seeing the pencil-case in Maguire's  possession, but they shook their heads. He enquired in other quarters,  too, but with no better result, and finally resolved to ask Brady, who  belonged to quite a different set from himself. With that object in view  he set off to Brady's room shortly after supper. As there was no  response to his raps, he at length opened Brady's door. In front of the  hearth in a big easy chair sat a figure.    \"'Brady, by all that's holy,' Hartnoll exclaimed. 'By Jupiter, the  beggar's asleep. That's what comes of swotting too hard! Brady!'    \"Approaching the chair he called again, 'Brady!' and getting no reply,  patted the figure gently on the back.    \"'Be jabbers, you sleep soundly, old fellow!' he said. 'How about that!'  and he shook him heartily by the shoulder. The instant he let go the  figure collapsed. In order to get a closer view Hartnoll then struck a  light with the tinder box.    \"The flickering of the candle flame fell on Brady's face. It was  white--ghastly white; there was no animation in it; the jaw dropped.    \"With a cry of horror Hartnoll sprang back, and as he did so a great  yellow dog dashed across the hearth in front of him, whilst from  somewhere close at hand came a laugh--long, low and satirical. A cold  terror gripped Hartnoll, and for a moment or so he was on the verge of  fainting. However, hearing voices in the quadrangle, he pulled himself  together, approached the window on tiptoe, and, peering through the  glass, perceived to his utmost joy two of his friends directly beneath  him. 'I say, you fellows,' he called in low tones, 'come up here  quickly--Brady's rooms. I've seen the phantom dog. There's been another  tragedy, and the murderer is close at hand. Come quietly and we may  catch him!'    \"He then retraced his steps to the centre of the room and listened.  Again there came the laugh--subtle, protracted, hellish--and it seemed  to him as if it must originate in the room overhead.    \"A noise in the direction of the hearth made him look round. Some loose  plaster had fallen, and whilst he still gazed, more fell. The truth of  the whole thing then dawned on him. The murderer was in the chimney.    \"Hartnoll was a creature of impulse. In the excitement of the moment he  forgot danger, and the dastardly nature of the crimes gave him more than  his usual amount of courage. He rushed at the chimney, and, regardless  of soot and darkness, began an impromptu ascent.    \"Half-way up something struck him--once, twice, thrice,--sharply, and  there was a soft, malevolent chuckle.    \"At this juncture the two undergraduates arrived in Brady's room. No one  was there--nothing save a hunched-up figure on a chair.    \"'Hartnoll!' they whispered. 'Hartnoll!' No reply. They called  again--still no reply. Again and again they called, until at length,  through sheer fatigue, they desisted, and seized with a sudden panic  fled precipitately downstairs and out into the quadrangle.    \"Once more the alarm was given, and once again the whole College, wild  with excitement, hastened to the scene of the outrage.    \"This time there was a double mystery. Brady had been murdered--Hartnoll  had disappeared. The police were summoned and the whole building  ransacked; but no one thought of the chimney till the search was nearly  over, and half the throng--overcome with fatigue--had retired. O'Farroll  was the discoverer. Happening to glance at the hearth he saw something  drop.    \"'For Heaven's sake, you fellows!' he shouted. 'Look! Blood! You may  take it from me there's a corpse in the chimney.'    \"A dozen candles invaded the hearth, and a herculean policeman undertook  the ascent. In breathless silence the crowd below waited, and, after a  few seconds of intense suspense, two helpless legs appeared on the hob.  Bit by bit, the rest of the body followed, until, at length, the whole  figure of Hartnoll, black, bleeding, bloodstained, was disclosed to  view.    \"At first it was thought that he was dead; but the surgeon who had  hurried to the scene pronouncing him still alive, there arose a  tremendous cheer. The murderer had at all events been foiled this time.    \"'Begorrah!' cried O'Farroll, 'Hartnoll was after the murderer when he  was struck, and shure I'll be after him the same way myself.' And before  anyone could prevent him O'Farroll was up the chimney. Up, up, up, until  he found himself going down, down, down; and then--bedad--he stepped  right out on to the floor of Belton's room.    \"'Hulloa!' the latter exclaimed, looking not a bit disconcerted, 'that's  a curious mode of making your entrance into my domain! Why didn't you  come by the door?'    \"'Because,' O'Farroll replied, pointing to a patch of soot near the  washstand, 'I followed you. Own up, Dicky Belton. You're the  culprit--you did for them all.' And Belton laughed.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Yes, it was true; overwork had turned Belton's brain, and he was  subsequently sent to a Criminal Lunatic Asylum for the rest of his life.  But there were moments when he was comparatively sane, and in these  interims he confessed everything. Anderson had told him that he was  going to hoax the Dean, and filled with indignation at the idea of such  a trick being played on a College official--for he, Belton, was a great  favourite with the 'Beaks'--he had accompanied Anderson on the plea of  helping him, intending, in reality, to frustrate him. It was not till he  was in the chimney, crouching behind Anderson, that the thought of  killing his fellow-students had entered his mind. The heat of his  hiding-place, acting on an already overworked brain, hastened on the  madness; and his fingers closing on a clasped knife in one of his  pockets, inspired him with a desire to kill.    \"The work once begun, he had argued with himself, would have to be  continued, and he had then and there decided that all unruly  undergraduates should be exterminated.    \"With what measure of success this determination was carried out need  not be recapitulated here; but with regard to the phantom dog a few  words may be added. Since it appeared immediately before the committal  of each of the three murders I have just recorded (it was seen by Mr.  Kelly before the death of Bob Anderson; by Brady, before the murder of  Maguire; and by Hartnoll, before Brady was murdered), I think there can  neither be doubts as to its existence nor as to the purport of its  visits.    \"Moreover, its latest appearance in the University, reported to me quite  recently, preceded a serious outbreak of fire.\"      _National Ghosts in the form of Dogs_    One of the most notorious dog ghosts is the Gwyllgi in Wales. This  apparition, which is of a particularly terrifying appearance, chiefly  haunts the lane leading from Mousiad to Lisworney Crossways.    Belief in a spectral dog, however, is common all over the British Isles.  The apparition does not belong to any one breed, but appears equally  often as a hound, setter, terrier, shepherd dog, Newfoundland and  retriever. In Lancashire it is called the \"Trash\" or \"Striker\"; Trash,  because the sound of its tread is thought to resemble a person walking  along a miry, sloppy road, with heavy shoes; Striker, because it is said  to utter a curious screech which may be taken as a warning of the  approaching death of some relative or friend. When followed the phantom  retreats, glaring at its pursuer, and either sinks into the ground with  a harrowing shriek, or disappears in some equally mysterious manner.    In Norfolk and Cambridgeshire this spectre is named the \"Shuck,\" the  local name for Shag--and is reported to haunt churchyards and other  dreary spots.    In the parish of Overstrand, there used to be a lane called \"Shuck's  Lane,\" named after this phantasm.    Round about Leeds the spectre dog is called \"Padfoot,\" and is about the  size of a donkey, with shaggy hair and large eyes like saucers. My  friend Mr. Barker tells me there was, at one time, a ghost in the  Hebrides called the Lamper, which was like a very big, white dog with no  tail. It ran sometimes straight ahead, but usually in circles, and to  see it was a prognostication of death. Mr. Barker, going home by the  sea-coast, saw the Lamper in the hedge. He struck at it, and his stick  passed right through it. The Lamper rushed away, whining and howling  alternately, and disappeared. Mr. Barker was so scared that he ran all  the way home. On the morrow, he learned of his father's death.    In Northumberland, Durham, and various parts of Yorkshire, the  ghost-dog, which is firmly believed in, is styled Barguest, Bahrgeist,  or Boguest; whilst in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18237"],[0,"A Bird Calendar for Northern India (#17)"],[1,"Bengal. The fantail or full-snipe (_G.  coelestis_) is at least one week later in arriving. This species has  been shot as early as the 24th August, but there is no general  immigration of even the advance-guard until quite the end of the  month.    The jack-snipe (_G. gallinula_) seems never to appear before  September.    Most of the monsoon broods of the Indian cliff-swallow emerge from the  eggs in August. The \"rains\" breeding season of the amadavats or red  munias is now over, and the bird-catcher issues forth to snare them.    His stock-in-trade consists of some seed and two or three amadavats in  one of the pyramid-shaped wicker cages that can be purchased for a few  annas in any bazaar. To the base of one of the sides of the cage a  flap is attached by a hinge. The flap, which is of the same shape and  size as the side of the cage, is composed of a frame over which a  small-meshed string net is stretched. A long string is fastened to the  apex of the flap and passed through a loop at the top of the cage.  Selecting an open space near some tall grass in which amadavats are  feeding, the bird-catcher sets down the cage and loosens the string so  that the flap rests on the earth. Some seed is sprinkled on the flap.  Then the trapper squats behind a bush, holding the end of the string  in his hand. The cheerful little _lals_ inside the cage soon begin to  twitter and sing, and their calls attract the wild amadavats in the  vicinity. These come to the cage, alight on the flap, and begin to eat  the seed. The bird-catcher gives the string a sharp pull and thus  traps his victims between the flap and the side of the cage. He then  disentangles them, places them in the cage, and again sets the trap.    Almost all the birds that rear up their young in the spring have  finished nesting duties for the year by August. Here and there a pair  of belated rollers may be seen feeding their young. Before the  beginning of the month nearly all the young crows and koels have  emerged from the egg, and the great majority of them have left the  nest. Young house-crows are distinguished from adults by the  indistinctness of the grey on the neck. They continually open their  great red mouths to clamour for food.    The wire-tailed swallows, swifts, pied crested-cuckoos,  crow-pheasants, butcher-birds, cuckoo-shrikes, fantail flycatchers,  babblers, white-necked storks, wren-warblers, weaver-birds, common and  pied mynas, peafowl, and almost all the resident water-birds, waders  and swimmers, except the terns and the plovers, are likely to have  eggs or young. The nesting season of the swifts and butcher-birds is  nearly over. In the case of the others it is at its height. The  wire-tailed swallows and minivets are busy with their second broods.  The nests of most of these birds have already been described.    The Indian peafowl (_Pavo cristatus_) usually lay their large white  eggs on the ground in long grass or thick undergrowth. Sometimes they  nestle on the grass-grown roofs of deserted buildings or in other  elevated situations. Egrets, night-herons, cormorants, darters,  paddy-birds, openbills, and spoonbills build stick nests in trees.  These birds often breed in large colonies. In most cases the site  chosen is a clump of trees in a village which is situated on the  border of a tank. Sometimes all these species nest in company. Hume  described a village in Mainpuri where scores of the above-mentioned  birds, together with some whistling teal and comb-ducks, nested  simultaneously. After a site has been selected by a colony the birds  return year after year to the place for nesting purposes. The majority  of the eggs are laid in July, the young appearing towards the end of  that month or early in the present one.    The nest of the sarus crane (_Grus antigone_) is nearly always an  islet some four feet in diameter, which either floats in shallow water  or rises from the ground and projects about a foot above the level of  the water. The nest is composed of dried rushes. It may be placed in a  _jhil_, a paddy field, or a borrow pit by the railway line. A  favourite place is the midst of paddy cultivation in some low-lying  field where the water is too deep to admit of the growing of rice. Two  very large white eggs, rarely three, are laid. This species makes no  attempt to conceal its nest. In the course of a railway journey in  August numbers of incubating saruses may be seen by any person who  takes the trouble to look for them.    \"Raoul\" makes the extraordinary statement that incubating sarus cranes  do not sit when incubating, but hatch the eggs by standing over them,  one leg on each side of the nest! Needless to say there is no truth  whatever in this statement. The legs of the sitting sarus crane are  folded under it, as are those of incubating flamingos and other  long-legged birds.    Throughout the month of August two of the most interesting birds in  India are busy with their nests. They are the pheasant-tailed and the  bronze-winged jacana. These birds live, move and have their being on  the surface of lotus-covered tanks. Owing to the great length of their  toes jacanas are able to run about with ease over the surface of the  floating leaves of water-lilies and other aquatic plants, or over  tangled masses of rushes and water-weeds.    In the monsoon many tanks are so completely covered with vegetation  that almost the only water visible to a person standing on the bank  consists of the numerous drops that have been thrown on to the flat  surfaces of the leaves, where they glisten in the sun like pearls.    Two species of jacana occur in India: the bronze-winged (_Motopus  indicus_) and the pheasant-tailed jacana or the water-pheasant  (_Hydrophasianus chirurgus_). They are to be found on most tanks in  the well-watered parts of the United Provinces. They occur in small  flocks and are often put up by sportsmen when shooting duck. They emit  weird mewing cries. The bronze-winged jacana is a black bird with  bronze wings. It is about the size of a pigeon, but has much longer  legs. The pheasant-tailed species is a black-and-white bird. In winter  the tail is short, but in May both sexes grow long pheasant-like  caudal feathers which give the bird its popular name. The  bronze-winged jacana does not grow these long tail feathers.    The nests of jacanas are truly wonderful structures. They are just  floating pads of rushes and leaves of aquatic plants. Sometimes  practically the whole of the pad is under water, so that the eggs  appear to be resting on the surface of the tank. The nest of the  bronze-winged species is usually larger and more massive than that of  the water-pheasant. The latter's nest is sometimes so small as hardly  to be able to contain the eggs--a little, shallow, circular cup of  rushes and water-weeds or floating lotus leaves or tufts of  water-grass. The eggs of the two species show but little similarity.  Both, however, are very beautiful and remarkable. The eggs of the  bronze-winged jacana have a rich brownish-bronze background, on which  black lines are scribbled in inextricable confusion, so that the egg  looks as though Arabic texts had been scrawled over it. This species  might well be called \"the Arabic writing-master.\" The eggs of the  water-pheasant are in shape like pegtops without the peg. They are of  a dark rich green-bronze colour, and devoid of any markings.    The nest of the handsome, but noisy, purple coot (_Porphyrio  poliocephalus_) is a platform of rushes and reeds which is sometimes  placed on the ground in a rice field, but is more often floating, and  is then tethered to a tree or some other object. From six to ten eggs  are laid. These are very beautiful objects. The ground colour is  delicate pink. This is spotted and blotched with crimson; beneath  these spots there are clouds of pale purple which have the appearance  of lying beneath the surface of the shell.    The white-breasted water-hen (_Gallinula phoenicura_) is a bird that  must be familiar to all. One pair, at least, is to be found in every  village which boasts of a tank and a bamboo clump, no matter how small  these be. The water-hen is a black bird about the size of the average  bazaar fowl, with a white face, throat and breast. It carries its  short tail almost erect, and under this is a patch of brick-red  feathers. During most seasons of the year it is a silent bird, but  from mid-May until the end of the monsoon it is exceedingly noisy,  and, were it in the habit of haunting our gardens and compounds, its  cries would attract as much attention as do those of the koel and the  brain-fever bird. As, however, water-hens are confined to tiny hamlets  situated far away from cities, many people are not acquainted with  their calls, which \"Eha\" describes as \"roars, hiccups and cackles.\"  The nest is built in a bamboo clump or other dense thicket. The eggs  are stone-coloured, with spots of brown, red and purple. The young  birds, when first hatched, are covered with black down, and look like  little black ducklings. They can run, swim and dive as soon as they  leave the egg. Little parties of them are to be seen at the edge of  most village tanks in August.    The resident ducks are all busy with their nests. The majority of them  lay their eggs in July, so that in August they are occupied with their  young.    The cotton-teal (_Nettopus coromandelianus_) usually lays its eggs in  a hole in a mango or other tree. The hollow is sometimes lined with  feathers and twigs. It is not very high up as a rule, from six to  twelve feet above the ground being the usual level. The tree selected  for the nesting site is not necessarily close to water. Thirteen or  fourteen eggs seem to be the usual clutch, but as many as twenty-two  have been taken from one nest. Young teal, when they emerge from the  egg, can swim and walk, but they are unable to fly. No European seems  to have actually observed the process"]]]
