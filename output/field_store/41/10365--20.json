I was delighted to go to Rome; but I could quite understand people  crediting Papa with the hope that in this way I should be brought  to change my mind about the religious life. It might certainly  have upset a vocation that was not very strong.    To begin with, Celine and I found ourselves in the company of many  distinguished people. In fact, there were scarcely any others in  the pilgrimage; but, far from being dazzled thereby, titles seemed  to us but a \"vapour of smoke,\"[1] and I understood the words of  the _Imitation:_ \"Be not solicitous for the shadow of a great  name.\"[2] I understood that true greatness is not found in a name  but in the soul. The Prophet Isaias tells us: \"The Lord shall call  His servants by another name,\"[3] and we read in St. John: \"To him  that overcometh I will give a white counter, and on the counter a  new name written which no man knoweth but he that receiveth  it.\"[4] In Heaven, therefore, we shall know our titles of  nobility, and \"then shall every man have praise from God,\"[5] and  he who on earth chose to be poorest and least known for love of  his Saviour, he will be the first, the noblest, and the richest.    The second thing I learnt had to do with Priests. Up to this time  I had not understood the chief aim of the Carmelite Reform. To  pray for sinners delighted me; to pray for Priests, whose souls  seemed pure as crystal, that indeed astonished me. But in Italy I  realised my vocation, and even so long a journey was a small price  to pay for such valuable knowledge. During that month I met with  many holy Priests, and yet I saw that even though the sublime  dignity of Priesthood raises them higher than the Angels, they are  still but weak and imperfect men. And so if holy Priests, whom Our  Lord in the Gospel calls the salt of the earth, have need of our  prayers, what must we think of the lukewarm? Has not Our Lord  said: \"If the salt lose its savour wherewith shall it be  salted?\"[6] Oh, dear Mother, how beautiful is our vocation! We  Carmelites are called to preserve \"the salt of the earth.\" We  offer our prayers and sacrifices for the apostles of the Lord; we  ourselves ought to be their apostles, while they, by word and  example, are preaching the Gospel to our brethren. Have we not a  glorious mission to fulfill? But I must say no more, for I feel  that on this subject my pen would run on for ever.    Now let me describe my journey in some detail. At three o'clock in  the morning of November 4, we passed through the silent streets.  Lisieux still lay shrouded in the darkness of night. I felt that I  was going out into the unknown, and that great things were  awaiting me in Rome. When we reached Paris, Papa took us to see  all the sights. For me there was but one--Our Lady of Victories. I  can never tell you what I felt at her shrine; the graces Our Lady  granted me were like those of my First Communion Day. I was filled  with peace and happiness. In this holy spot the Blessed Virgin, my  Mother, told me plainly that it was really she who had smiled on  me and cured me. With intense fervour I entreated her to keep me  always, and to realise my heart's desire by hiding me under her  spotless mantle, and I also asked her to remove from me every  occasion of sin.    I was well aware that during this journey I should come across  things that might disturb me; knowing nothing of evil, I feared I  might discover it. As yet I had not experienced that \"to the pure  all things are pure,\"[7] that a simple and upright soul does not  see evil in anything, because evil only exists in impure hearts  and not in inanimate objects. I prayed specially to St. Joseph to  watch over me; from my childhood, devotion to him has been  interwoven with my love for our Blessed Lady. Every day I said the  prayer beginning: \"St. Joseph, Father and Protector of Virgins\"  . . . so I felt I was well protected and quite safe from danger.    We left Paris on November 7, after our solemn Consecration to the  Sacred Heart in the Basilica of Montmartre.[8] Each compartment of  the train was named after a Saint, and the selection was made in  honour of some Priest occupying it--his own patron or that of his  parish being chosen. But in the presence of all the pilgrims our  compartment was named after St. Martin! My Father, deeply touched  by this compliment, went at once to thank Mgr. Legoux,  Vicar-General of Coutances and director of the pilgrimage. From  this onwards he was often called \"Monsieur Saint Martin.\"    Father Reverony watched my behaviour closely. I could tell that he  was doing so; at table, if I were not opposite to him, he would  lean forward to look at me and listen to what I was saying. I  think he must have been satisfied with his investigations, for,  towards the end of the journey, he seemed more favourably  disposed. I say towards the end, for in Rome he was far from being  my advocate, as I will tell you presently. Still I would not have  it thought he deceived me in any way by falling short of the good  will he had shown at Bayeux. On the contrary, I am sure that he  always felt kindly towards me, and that if he opposed my wishes it  was only to put me to the test.    On our way into Italy we passed through Switzerland, with its high  mountains, their snowy peaks lost in the clouds, its rushing  torrents, and its deep valleys filled with giant ferns and purple  heather. Great good was wrought in my soul by these beauties of  nature so abundantly scattered abroad. They lifted it to Him Who  had been pleased to lavish such masterpieces upon this transient  earth.    Sometimes we were high up the mountain side, while at our feet an  unfathomable abyss seemed ready to engulf us. A little later we  were passing through a charming village with its cottages and  graceful belfry, above which light fleecy clouds floated lazily.  Farther on a great lake with its blue waters, so calm and clear,  would blend with the glowing splendour of the setting sun. I  cannot tell you how deeply I was impressed with this scenery so  full of poetry and grandeur. It was a foretaste of the wonders of  Heaven. Then the thought of religious life would come before me,  as it really is, with its constraints and its little daily  sacrifices made in secret. I understood how easily one might  become wrapped in self and forget the sublime end of one's  vocation, and I thought: \"Later on, when the time of trial comes,  when I am enclosed in the Carmel and shall only be able to see a  little bit of sky, I will remember this day and it will encourage  me. I will make light of my own small interests by thinking of the  greatness and majesty of God; I will love Him alone, and will not  be so foolish as to attach myself to the fleeting trifles of this  world, now that my heart has had a glimpse of what is reserved for  those who love Him.\"    After having contemplated the works of God, I turned next to  admire those of His creatures. Milan was the first Italian town we  visited, and we carefully studied its Cathedral of white marble,  adorned with countless statues. Celine and I left the timid ones,  who hid their faces in fear after climbing to the first stage,  and, following the bolder pilgrims, we reached the top, from  whence we viewed the city below. When we came down we started on  the first of our expeditions; these lasted the whole month of the  pilgrimage, and quite cured me of a desire to be always lazily  riding in a carriage.    The \"Campo Santo\"[9] charmed us. The whole vast enclosure is  covered with marble statues, so exquisitely carved as to be  life-like, and placed with an apparent negligence that only  enhances their charm. You feel almost tempted to console the  imaginary personages that surround you, their expression so  exactly portrays a calm and Christian sorrow. And what works of  art! Here is a child putting flowers on its father's grave--one  forgets how solid is marble--the delicate petals appear to slip  through its fingers. Sometimes the light veils of the widows, and  the ribbons of the young girls, seem floating on the breeze.    We could not find words to express our admiration, but an old  gentleman who followed us everywhere--regretting no doubt his  inability to share our sentiments--said in a tone of ill-temper:  \"Oh, what enthusiasts these French people are!\" and yet he also  was French. I think the poor man would have done better to stay at  home. Instead of enjoying the journey he was always grumbling:  nothing pleased him, neither cities, hotels, people, nor anything  else. My Father, whose disposition was the exact opposite, was  quite content, no matter what happened, and tried to cheer our  friend, offering him his place in the carriage or elsewhere, and  with his wonted goodness encouraging him to look on the bright  side of things. But nothing could cheer him. How many different  kinds of people we saw and how interesting it is to study the  world when one is just about to leave it!    In Venice the scene changed completely. Instead of the bustle of a  large city, silence reigned, broken only by the lapping of the  waters and the cries of the gondoliers as they plied their oars;  it is a city full of charm but full of sadness. Even the Palace of  the Doges, splendid though it be, is sad; we walked through halls  whose vaulted roofs have long since ceased to re-echo the voices  of the governors in their sentences of life and death. Its dark  dungeons are no longer a living tomb for unfortunate prisoners to  pine within.    While visiting these dreadful prisons I fancied myself in the  times of the martyrs, and gladly would I have chosen this sombre  abode for my dwelling if there had been any question of confessing  my faith. Presently the guide's voice roused me from my reverie,  and I crossed the \"Bridge of Sighs,\" so called because of the  sighs"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/168"],[0,"The History and Practice of the Art of Photography (#17)"],[1,"to take a sheet of photographic paper (the bromide paper is the best),  and place it in contact with a calotype picture previously rendered  transparent by wax or oil as before directed.  Fix it in the frame,  Fig. 29, expose it in the sunshine for a short time, and an image or  copy will be formed on the photogenic paper.  The calotype paper itself  may be used to take the second, or positive, picture, but this Mr.  Talbot does not recommend, for although it takes a much longer time to  take a copy on the photogenic paper, yet the tints of such copy are  generally more harmonious and agreeable.  After a calotype picture has  furnished a number of copies it sometimes grows faint, and the  subsequent copies are inferior.  This may be prevented by means of a  process which revives the strength of the calotype pictures.  In order  to do this, it is only necessary to wash them by candlelight with  gallo-nitrate of silver, and then warm them.  This causes all the  shades of the picture to darken considerably, while the white parts are  unaffected.  After this the picture is of course to be fixed a second  time.  It will then yield a second series of copies, and, in this way,  a great number may frequently be made.    The calotype pictures when prepared as we have stated, possess a  yellowish tint, which impedes the process of taking copies from them.  In order to remedy this defect, Mr. Talbot has devised the following  method.  The calotype picture is plunged into a solution consisting of  hyposulphite of soda dissolved in about ten times its weight of water,  and heated nearly to the boiling point.  The picture should remain in  about ten minutes; it must then be removed, washed and dried.  By this  process the picture is rendered more transparent, and its lights become  whiter.  It is also rendered exceedingly permanent.  After this process  the picture may be waxed, and thus its transparency increased.  This  process is applicable to all photographic papers prepared with  solutions of silver.    Having thus fully, and it is hoped clearly, considered the process, it  may be necessary before dismissing the calotype from notice, to add one  or two remarks from the observations and labors of some who have  experimented in this art.  Dr. Ryan in his lectures before the Royal  Polytechnic Institution, has observed, that in the iodizing process the  sensitiveness of the paper is materially injured by keeping it too long  in the solution of iodide of potassium, owing to the newly formed  iodide of silver being so exceedingly solvable in excess of iodide of  potassium as in a few minutes to be completely removed.  The paper  should be dipped in the solution and instantly removed.  There is  another point, too, in the preparation of the iodized paper in which  suggestions for a slight deviation from Mr. Talbot's plan have been  made.  In the first instance, it is recommended that the paper be  brushed over with the iodide of potassium, instead of the nitrate of  silver, transposing, in fact, the application of the first two  solutions.  The paper, having been brushed over with the iodide of  potassium in solution, is washed in distilled water and dried.  It is  then brushed over with nitrate of silver, and after drying is dipped  for, a moment in a fresh solution of iodide of potassium of only  one-fourth the strength of the first, that is to say, one hundred and  twenty-five grains of the salt to a pint of water.  After this it is  again washed and dried.  The advantage derived from this method, is a  more sensitive paper, and a more even distribution of the compounds  over the surface.    Another deviation from Mr. Talbot's method has been suggested, as  follows:    Brush the paper over with a solution of one hundred grains of nitrate  of silver to an ounce of water.  When nearly, but not quite, dry, dip  it into a solution of twenty-five grains of iodide of potassium to one  ounce of distilled water, drain it, wash it in distilled water and  again drain it.  Now brush it over with aceto-nitrate of silver, made  by dissolving fifty grains of nitrate of silver in one ounce of  distilled water, to which is added one sixth of its volume of strong  acetic acid.  Dry it with bibulous paper, and it is ready for receiving  the image.  When the impression has been received, which will require  from one to five minutes according to the state of the weather, it must  be washed with a saturated solution of gallic acid to which a few drops  of the aceto-nitrate of silver, made as above, have been added.  The  image will thus be gradually brought out, and may be fixed with  hyposulphite of soda.  To obtain the positive picture, paper must be  used brushed over with an ammonio-nitrate of silver, made thus: forty  grains of nitrate of silver is to be dissolved in one ounce of  distilled water, and liquid ammonia cautiously added till it  re-dissolves the precipitate.    A pleasing effect may be given to calotype, or indeed to all  photographic pictures, by waxing them at the back, and mounting them on  white paper, or if colored paper be used, various beautiful tones of  color are produced.    POSITIVE CALOTYPE.    At a meeting of the British Association, Professor Grove described a  process by which positive calotype pictures could be directly obtained;  and thus the necessity to transfer by which the imperfections of the  paper are shown, and which is moreover a troublesome and tedious  process, is avoided.  As light favors most chemical actions, Mr. Grove  was led to believe that a paper darkened by the sun (which darkening is  supposed to result from the precipitation of silver) might be bleached  by using a solvent which would not attack the silver in the dark, but  would do so in the light.  The plan found to be the most successful is  as follows: ordinary calotype paper is darkened till it assumes a deep  brown color, almost amounting to black; it is then redipped into the  ordinary solution of iodide of potassium, and dried.  When required for  use it is drawn over dilute nitric acid--one part acid to two and a  half parts water.  In this state, those parts exposed to the light are  rapidly bleached, while the parts not exposed remain unchanged.  It is  fixed by washing in water, and subsequently in hyposulphite of soda, or  bromide of potassium.    Mr. Grove also describes a process for converting a negative calotype  into a positive one, which promises, when carried out, to be of great  utility.    Let an ordinary calotype image or portrait be taken in the camera, and  developed by gallic acid; then drawn over iodide of potassium and  dilute nitric acid and exposed to full sunshine; while bleaching the  dark parts, the light is redarkening the newly precipitated iodide in  the lighter portions and thus the negative picture is converted into a  positive one.    The calotype process has been applied to the art of printing, in  England, but it possesses no advantages whatever over the method, with  type, now so gloriously brought to perfection; and I can hardly think  it will ever be made of any utility.  For the benefit of the curious,  however, I will give Mr. Talbot's method.    Some pages of letter-press are taken printed on one side only; and  waxed, to render them more transparent; the letters are then cut out  and sorted.  To compose a new page lines are ruled on a sheet of white  paper, and the words are formed by fixing the seperate letters in their  proper order.  The page being ready, a negative photograph is produced  from it, from which the requisite number of positive photogenic copies  may be obtained.    Another method, which requires the use of the camera, consists in  employing large letters painted on rectangular pieces of wood, colored  white.  These are arranged in lines on a tablet or board, by slipping  them into grooves which keep them steady and upright, thus forming a  page on an enlarged scale.  It is now placed before a camera, and a  reduced image of it of the required size is thrown upon the sensitive  paper.  The adjustments must be kept invariable, so that the  consecutive pages may not vary from one another in the size of the  type.  Mr. Talbot has patented his process, but what benefit he expects  to derive from it, I am at a loss to determine.    Enlarged copies of calotype or Daguerreotype portraits may be obtained  by throwing magnified images of them, by means of lenses, upon calotype  paper.    THE CHRYSOTYPE.    A modification of Mr. Talbot's process, to which the name of Chrysotype  was given by its discoverer, Sir John Herschel, was communicated in  June 1843 to the Royal Society, by that distinguished philosopher.  This modification would appear to unite the simplicity of photography  with all the distinctness and clearness of calotype.  This preparation  is as follows.    The paper is to be washed in a solution of ammonio-citrate of iron; it  must then be dried, and subsequently brushed over with a solution of  the ferro-sesquicyanuret of potassium.  This paper, when dried in a  perfectly dark room, is ready for use in the same manner as if  otherwise prepared, the image being subsequently brought out by any  neutral solution of gold.  Such was the first declaration of his  discovery, but he has since found that a neutral solution of silver is  equally useful in bringing out the picture.  Photographic pictures  taken on this paper are distinguished by a clearness of outline foreign  to all other methods.        CHAP. X.
