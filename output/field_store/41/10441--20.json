Naomi could no more be taken in  proof of the one assertion than of the other. When she came to us, it  was agreed that she should go to school; but she overruled her mother in  this as in everything else, and never went. Except Sunday-school  lessons, she had no other instruction than that her mistress gave her in  the evenings, when a heavy day's play and the natural influences of the  hour conspired with original causes to render her powerless before words  of one syllable.    The first week of her services she was obedient and faithful to her  duties; but, relaxing in the atmosphere of a house which seems to  demoralize all menials, she shortly fell into disorderly ways of lying  in wait for callers out of doors, and, when people rang, of running up  the front steps, and letting them in from the outside. As the season  expanded, and the fine weather became confirmed, she modified even this  form of service, and spent her time in the fields, appearing at the  house only when nature importunately craved molasses....    In her untamable disobedience, Naomi alone betrayed her sylvan blood,  for she was in all other respects negro and not Indian. But it was of  her aboriginal ancestry that Mrs. Johnson chiefly boasted,--when not  engaged in argument to maintain the superiority of the African race. She  loved to descant upon it as the cause and explanation of her own  arrogant habit of feeling; and she seemed indeed to have inherited  something of the Indian's hauteur along with the Ethiop's supple cunning  and abundant amiability. She gave many instances in which her pride had  met and overcome the insolence of employers, and the kindly old creature  was by no means singular in her pride of being reputed proud.    She could never have been a woman of strong logical faculties, but she  had in some things a very surprising and awful astuteness. She seldom  introduced any purpose directly, but bore all about it, and then  suddenly sprung it upon her unprepared antagonist. At other times she  obscurely hinted a reason, and left a conclusion to be inferred; as when  she warded off reproach for some delinquency by saying in a general way  that she had lived with ladies who used to come scolding into the  kitchen after they had taken their bitters. \"Quality ladies took their  bitters regular,\" she added, to remove any sting of personality from her  remark; for, from many things she had let fall, we knew that she did not  regard us as quality. On the contrary, she often tried to overbear us  with the gentility of her former places; and would tell the lady over  whom she reigned, that she had lived with folks worth their three and  four hundred thousand dollars, who never complained as she did of the  ironing. Yet she had a sufficient regard for the literary occupations of  the family, Mr. Johnson having been an author. She even professed to  have herself written a book, which was still in manuscript, and  preserved somewhere among her best clothes.    It was well, on many accounts, to be in contact with a mind so original  and suggestive as Mrs. Johnson's. We loved to trace its intricate yet  often transparent operations, and were perhaps too fond of explaining  its peculiarities by facts of ancestry,--of finding hints of the Pow-wow  or the Grand Custom in each grotesque development. We were conscious of  something warmer in this old soul than in ourselves, and something  wilder, and we chose to think it the tropic and the untracked forest.  She had scarcely any being apart from her affection; she had no  morality, but was good because she neither hated nor envied; and she  might have been a saint far more easily than far more civilized people.    There was that also in her sinuous yet malleable nature, so full of  guile and so full of goodness, that reminded us pleasantly of lowly  folks in elder lands, where relaxing oppressions have lifted the  restraints of fear between master and servant, without disturbing the  familiarity of their relation. She advised freely with us upon all  household matters, and took a motherly interest in whatever concerned  us. She could be flattered or caressed into almost any service, but no  threat or command could move her. When she erred she never acknowledged  her wrong in words, but handsomely expressed her regrets in a pudding,  or sent up her apologies in a favorite dish secretly prepared. We grew  so well used to this form of exculpation, that, whenever Mrs. Johnson  took an afternoon at an inconvenient season, we knew that for a week  afterwards we should be feasted like princes. She owned frankly that she  loved us, that she never had done half so much for people before, and  that she never had been nearly so well suited in any other place; and  for a brief and happy time we thought that we never should part.    One day, however, our dividing destiny appeared in the basement, and was  presented to us as Hippolyto Thucydides, the son of Mrs. Johnson, who  had just arrived on a visit to his mother from the State of New  Hampshire. He was a heavy and loutish youth, standing upon the borders  of boyhood, and looking forward to the future with a vacant and listless  eye. I mean this was his figurative attitude; his actual manner, as he  lolled upon a chair beside the kitchen window, was so eccentric that we  felt a little uncertain how to regard him, and Mrs. Johnson openly  described him as peculiar. He was so deeply tanned by the fervid suns  of the New Hampshire winter, and his hair had so far suffered from the  example of the sheep lately under his charge, that he could not be  classed by any stretch of comparison with the blonde and straight-haired  members of Mrs. Johnson's family.    He remained with us all the first day until late in the afternoon, when  his mother took him out to get him a boarding-house. Then he departed in  the van of her and Naomi, pausing at the gate to collect his spirits,  and, after he had sufficiently animated himself by clapping his palms  together, starting off down the street at a hand-gallop, to the manifest  terror of the cows in the pasture, and the confusion of the less  demonstrative people of our household. Other characteristic traits  appeared in Hippolyto Thucydides within no very long period of time, and  he ran away from his lodgings so often during the summer that he might  be said to board round among the outlying cornfields and turnip-patches  of Charlesbridge. As a check upon this habit, Mrs. Johnson seemed to  have invited him to spend his whole time in our basement; for whenever  we went below we found him there, balanced--perhaps in homage to us, and  perhaps as a token of extreme sensibility in himself--upon the low  window-sill, the bottoms of his boots touching the floor inside, and his  face buried in the grass without.    We could formulate no very tenable objection to all this, and yet the  presence of Thucydides in our kitchen unaccountably oppressed our  imaginations. We beheld him all over the house, a monstrous eidolon,  balanced upon every window-sill; and he certainly attracted unpleasant  notice to our place, no less by his furtive and hangdog manner of  arrival than by the bold displays with which he celebrated his  departures. We hinted this to Mrs. Johnson, but she could not enter into  our feeling. Indeed, all the wild poetry of her maternal and primitive  nature seemed to cast itself about this hapless boy; and if we had  listened to her we should have believed there was no one so agreeable in  society, or so quick-witted in affairs, as Hippolyto, when he chose....    At last, when we said positively that Thucydides should come to us no  more, and then qualified the prohibition by allowing him to come every  Sunday, she answered that she never would hurt the child's feelings by  telling him not to come where his mother was; that people who did not  love her children did not love her; and that, if Hippy went, she went.  We thought it a masterstroke of firmness to rejoin that Hippolyto must  go in any event; but I am bound to own that he did not go, and that his  mother stayed, and so fed us with every cunning propitiatory dainty,  that we must have been Pagans to renew our threat. In fact, we begged  Mrs. Johnson to go into the country with us, and she, after long  reluctation on Hippy's account, consented, agreeing to send him away to  friends during her absence.    We made every preparation, and on the eve of our departure Mrs. Johnson  went into the city to engage her son's passage to Bangor, while we  awaited her return in untroubled security.    But she did not appear till midnight, and then responded with but a sad  \"Well, sah!\" to the cheerful \"Well, Mrs. Johnson!\" that greeted her.    \"All right, Mrs. Johnson?\"    Mrs. Johnson made a strange noise, half chuckle and half death-rattle,  in her throat. \"All wrong, sah. Hippy's off again; and I've been all  over the city after him.\"    \"Then you can't go with us in the morning?\"    \"How _can_ I, sah?\"    Mrs. Johnson went sadly out of the room. Then she came back to the door  again, and opening it, uttered, for the first time in our service, words  of apology and regret: \"I hope I ha'n't put you out any. I _wanted_ to  go with you, but I ought to _knowed_ I couldn't. All is, I loved you too  much.\"          PASS    BY IRONQUILL          A father said unto his hopeful son,      \"Who was Leonidas, my cherished one?\"      The boy replied, with words of ardent nature,      \"He was a member of the legislature.\"      \"How?\" asked the parent; then the youngster saith:      \"He got a pass, and held her like grim death.\"      \"Whose pass? what pass?\" the anxious father cried;      \"'Twas the'r monopoly,\" the boy replied.        In deference to the public, we must state,      That boy has been an orphan since that date.          TEACHING BY EXAMPLE    BY JOHN G. SAXE          \"W"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18477"],[0,"The Science of Human Nature (#17)"],[1," there comes to  be established the definite response, tipping the hat. A similar habit  is that of turning to the right when we meet a person. For the definite  situation, meeting a person on the road or street or sidewalk, there is  established the definite response, turning to the right. The response  becomes automatic, immediate, certain.    There is another type of habit that may properly be called an  intellectual habit, such as voting a certain party ticket, say the  Democratic. When one is a boy, one hears his father speak favorably of  the Democratic party. His father says, \"Hurrah for Bryan,\" so he comes  to say, \"Hurrah for Bryan.\" His father says, \"I am a Democrat,\" so he  says he is a Democrat. He takes the side that his father takes. In a  similar way we take on the same religious notions that our parents have.  It does not always happen this way, but this is the rule. But no matter  how we come to do it, we do adopt the creed of some party or some  church. We adopt a certain way of looking at public questions, and a  certain way of looking at religious questions. For certain rather  definite situations, we come to take definite stands. When we go to the  booth to vote, we look at the top of the ballot to find the column  marked \"Democratic,\" and the definite response is to check the  \"Democrat\" column. Of course, some of us form a different habit and  check the \"Republican\" column, but the psychology of the act is the  same. The point is that we form the Democratic habit or we form the  Republican habit; and the longer we practice the habit, the harder it is  to change it.    In the presidential campaign of 1912, Roosevelt \"bolted\" from the  Republican party. It was hard for the older Republicans to follow him.  While one occasionally found a follower of Roosevelt who was gray, one  usually found the old Republicans standing by the old party, the younger  ones joining the Progressive party. It is said that when Darwin  published \"The Origin of Species,\" very few old men accepted the  doctrine of evolution. The adherents of the new doctrine were nearly  all young men. So there is such a thing as an intellectual habit. One  comes to take a definite stand when facing certain definite intellectual  situations.    Similar to the type of habits which we have called intellectual is  another type which may be called \"moral.\" When we face the situation of  reporting an occurrence, we can tell the truth or we can lie. We can  build up the habit of meeting such situations by telling the truth on  all occasions. We can learn to follow the maxim \"Tell the truth at all  times, at all hazards.\" We can come to do this automatically, certainly,  and without thought of doing anything else.    Most moral situations are fairly definite and clear-cut, and for them we  can establish definite forms of response. We can form the habit of  helping a person in distress, of helping a sick neighbor, of speaking  well of a neighbor; we can form habits of industry, habits of  perseverance. These and other similar habits are the basis of morality.    The various kinds of habits which we have enumerated are alike in  certain fundamental particulars. In all of them there is a definite  situation followed by a definite response. One sees the switch and turns  off the light; he sees the expression \"nine times nine\" and says  \"eighty-one\"; he sees a lady he knows and tips his hat; in meeting a  carriage on the road, he turns to the right; when he has to vote, he  votes a certain ticket; when he has to report an occurrence, he tells it  as it happened. There is, in every case, a definite situation followed  by a definite response.    Another characteristic is common to all the cases mentioned above,  _i.e._ the response is acquired, it does not come at first. In every  instance we might have learned to act differently. We could form the  habit of always leaving the light burning; could just as easily say  \"nine times nine equals forty\"; we could turn to the left; we could vote  the Republican ticket. We can form bad moral habits as well as good  ones, perhaps more easily. The point is, however, that we acquire  definite ways of acting for the same situations, and these definite ways  of acting are called habits.    =Habit and Nerve-Path.= It has already been stated that a habit is a  tendency toward a certain type of action in a certain situation. The  basis of this tendency is in the nervous system. In order to understand  it we must consider what the nervous system is like. Nerves terminate at  one end in a sense organ and at the other end ultimately in a muscle.    In Figure II, A is a sense organ, B a nerve going from the sense organ  to the brain C. D, E, F, G, and H are motor nerves going from the brain  to the muscles. Now, let us show from the diagram what organization  means and what tendency means. At first when the child sees the  expression \"nine times nine,\" he does not say \"eighty-one.\" The stimulus  brings about no definite action. It is as likely to go out through E or  F as through D. But suppose we can get the child to say \"nine times nine  equals eighty-one.\" We can write the expression on the blackboard and  have the child look at it and say \"nine times nine equals eighty-one.\"  Suppose the act of saying \"eighty-one\" is brought about by the  nerve-current going out through nerve-chain D. By repetition, we  establish a bond. A stimulus of a particular kind comes through A, goes  over B to C, and out over D, making muscles at M bring about a very  definite action in saying \"eighty-one.\"    [Illustration: FIGURE II.--THE ORGANIZATION OF TENDENCIES]    From the point of view of physiology, the process of habit-formation  consists in securing a particular nerve coupling, establishing a  particular nerve path, so that a definite form of stimulation will bring  about a definite form of response. A nerve tendency is simply the  likelihood that a stimulus will take a certain course rather than any  other. This likelihood is brought about by getting the stimulus to take  the desired route through the nervous system to a group of muscles and  to continue following this route. The more times it passes the same way,  the greater is the probability that at any given time the stimulus will  take the accustomed route and bring about the usual response. At first  any sort of action is possible. A nerve stimulus can take any one of the  many routes to the different muscles. By chance or by conscious  direction, the stimulus takes a certain path, and by repetition we fix  and make permanent this particular route. This constitutes a nerve  tendency or habit.    =Plasticity.= Our discussion should have made it clear that habit is  acquired nature, while instinct is inherited nature. Habit is acquired  tendency while instinct is inherited tendency. The possibility of  acquiring habits is peculiarly a human characteristic. While inanimate  things have a definite nature, a definite way of reacting to forces  which act upon them, they have little, if any, possibility of varying  their way of acting. Water might be said to have habits. If one cools  water, it turns to ice. If we heat it, it turns to steam. But it  _invariably_ does this. We cannot teach it any different way of acting.  Under the same conditions it always does the same thing.    Plants are very much like inanimate things. Plants have definite ways of  acting. A vine turns around a support. A leaf turns its upper surface to  the light. But one cannot teach plants different ways of acting. The  lower forms of animals are somewhat like plants and inanimate objects.  But to a very slight extent they are variable and can form habits. Among  the higher animals, such as dogs and other domestic animals, there is a  greater possibility of forming habits. In man there are the greatest  possibilities of habit-formation. In man the learned acts or habits are  many as compared to the unlearned acts or instincts; while among the  lower animals the opposite is the case--their instincts are many as  compared to their habits.    We may call this possibility of forming habits _plasticity_. Inanimate  objects such as iron, rocks, sulphur, oxygen, etc., have no plasticity.  Plants have very little possibility of forming habits. Lower animals  have somewhat more, and higher animals still more, while man has the  greatest possibility of forming habits. This great possibility of  forming habits is one of the main characteristics of man. Let us  illustrate the contrast between man and inanimate objects by an example.  If sulphur is put into a test tube and heated, it at first melts and  becomes quite thin like water. If it is heated still more, it becomes  thick and will not run out of the tube. It also becomes dark. Sulphur  _always_ does this when so treated. It cannot be taught to act  differently. Now the action of sulphur when heated is like the action of  a man when he turns to the right upon meeting a person in the street.  But the man has to acquire this habit, while the sulphur does not have  to learn its way of acting. Sulphur always acted in this way, while man  did not perform his act at first, but had to learn it by slow  repetition.    Everything in the world has its own peculiar nature, but man is unique  in that his nature can be very much changed. To a large extent, a man is  _made_, his nature is _acquired_. After we become men and women, we have  hundreds and thousands of tendencies to action, definite forms of  action, that we did not have when young. Man's nature might be said to  consist in his tendencies to action. Some of these tendencies he  inherits; these are his instincts. Some of these he acquires; these are  his habits.    =What Habits Do for Us.= We have found out what habits are like; let us  now see what they do for us. What good do they accomplish for us? How  are we different after forming a habit from what we were before? We can  best answer these questions"]]]
