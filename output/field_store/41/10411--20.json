The two  denominators are taken in this case to show the ratio of the variance;  so the octave obtained from the circle of fifths is sharper than the  true octave in the ratio expressed by 531441 to 524288, which ratio is  called the _ditonic comma_. This comma is equal to one-fifth of a  half-step.    We are to conclude, then, that if octaves are to remain perfect, and  we desire to establish an equal temperament, the above-named  difference is best disposed of by dividing it into twelve equal parts  and depressing each of the fifths one-twelfth part of the ditonic  comma; thereby dispersing the dissonance so that it will allow perfect  octaves, and yet, but slightly impair the consonance of the fifths.    We believe the foregoing propositions will demonstrate the facts  stated therein, to the student's satisfaction, and that he should now  have a pretty thorough knowledge of the mathematics of the  temperament. That the equal temperament is the only practical  temperament, is confidently affirmed by Mr. W.S.B. Woolhouse, an  eminent authority on musical mathematics, who says:--    \"It is very misleading to suppose that the necessity of temperament  applies only to instruments which have fixed tones. Singers and  performers on perfect instruments must all temper their intervals, or  they could not keep in tune with each other, or even with themselves;  and on arriving at the same notes by different routes, would be  continually finding a want of agreement. The scale of equal  temperament obviates all such inconveniences, and continues to be  universally accepted with unqualified satisfaction by the most eminent  vocalists; and equally so by the most renowned and accomplished  performers on stringed instruments, although these instruments are  capable of an indefinite variety of intonation. The high development  of modern instrumental music would not have been possible, and could  not have been acquired, without the manifold advantages of the  tempered intonation by equal semitones, and it has, in consequence,  long become the established basis of tuning.\"      NUMERICAL COMPARISON OF THE DIATONIC SCALE WITH THE TEMPERED SCALE.    The following table, comparing vibration numbers of the diatonic scale  with those of the tempered, shows the difference in the two scales,  existing between the thirds, fifths and other intervals.    Notice that the difference is but slight in the lowest octave used  which is shown on the left; but taking the scale four octaves higher,  shown on the right, the difference becomes more striking.         |DIATONIC.|TEMPERED.| |DIATONIC.|TEMPERED.|      C|32.      |32.      |C|512.     |512.     |      D|36.      |35.92    |D|576.     |574.70   |      E|40.      |40.32    |E|640.     |645.08   |      F|42.66    |42.71    |F|682.66   |683.44   |      G|48.      |47.95    |G|768.     |767.13   |      A|53.33    |53.82    |A|853.33   |861.08   |      B|60.      |60.41    |B|960.     |966.53   |      C|64.      |64.      |C|1024.    |1024.    |    Following this paragraph we give a reference table in which the  numbers are given for four consecutive octaves, calculated for the  system of equal temperament.

To do this, select two notes and ascertain what  interval the higher forms to the lower; then, by the fraction in the  table below corresponding to that interval, multiply the vibration  number of the lower note.    EXAMPLE.--Say we select the first C, 128, and the G in the  same column. We know this to be an interval of a perfect fifth.  Referring to the table below, we find that the vibration of the fifth  is 3/2 of, or 3/2 times, that of its fundamental; so we simply  multiply this fraction by the vibration number of C, which is 128, and  this gives 192 as the exact fifth. Now, on referring to the above  table of equal temperament, we find this G quoted a little less  (flatter), viz., 191.78. To find a fourth from any note, multiply its  number by 4/3, a major third, by 5/4, and so on as per table below.    TABLE SHOWING RELATIVE VIBRATION OF INTERVALS BY IMPROPER FRACTIONS.

What would be the vibration per second of an exact (not      tempered) fifth, from C-512?        4. Give the figures and the process used in finding the vibration      number of the _exact_ major third to C-256.        5. If we should tune the whole circle of twelve fifths exactly as      detailed in Proposition III, how much too sharp would the last C      be to the first C tuned?          LESSON XIV.    ~MISCELLANEOUS TOPICS PERTAINING TO THE PRACTICAL WORK OF TUNING.~      ~Beats.~--The phenomenon known as \"beats\" has been but briefly alluded  to in previous lessons, and not analytically discussed as it should  be, being so important a feature as it is, in the practical operations  of tuning. The average tuner hears and considers the beats with a  vague and indefinite comprehension, guessing at causes and effects,  and arriving at uncertain results. Having now become familiar with  vibration numbers and ratios, the student may, at this juncture, more  readily understand the phenomenon, the more scientific discussion of  which it has been thought prudent to withhold until now.    In speaking of the unison in Lesson VIII, we stated that \"the cause of  the waves in a defective unison is the alternate recurring of the  periods when the condensations and the rarefactions correspond in the  two strings, and then antagonize.\" This concise definition is  complete; but it may not as yet have been fully apprehended. The  unison being the simplest interval, we shall use it for consideration  before taking the more complex intervals into account.    Let us consider the nature of a single musical tone: that it consists  of a chain of sound-waves; that each sound-wave consists of a  condensation and a rarefaction, which are directly opposed to each  other; and that sound-waves travel through air at a specific rate per  second. Let us also remark, here, that in the foregoing lessons, where  reference is made to vibrations, the term signifies sound-waves. In  other words, the terms, \"vibration\" and \"sound-wave,\" are synonymous.    If two strings, tuned to give forth the same number of vibrations per  second, are struck at the same time, the tone produced will appear to  come from a single source; one sweet, continuous, smooth, musical  tone. The reason is this: The condensations sent forth from each of  the two strings occur exactly together; the rarefactions, which, of  course, alternate with the condensations, are also simultaneous. It  necessarily follows, therefore, that the condensations from each of  the two strings travel with the same velocity. Now, while this  condition prevails, it is evident that the two strings assist each  other, making the condensations more condensed, and, consequently, the  rarefactions more rarefied, the result of which is, the two allied  forces combine to strengthen the tone.    In opposition to the above, if two strings, tuned to produce the same  tone, could be so struck that the condensation of one would occur at  the same "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17575"],[0,"How to Camp Out (#17)"],[1,"ladies, 94.      illustration of, 129.
