Then said Bassanio, \"In Belmont is a lady richly left, and from all  quarters of the globe renowned suitors come to woo her, not only because  she is rich, but because she is beautiful and good as well. She looked  on me with such favor when last we met, that I feel sure that I should  win her away from all rivals for her love had I but the means to go to  Belmont, where she lives.\"    \"All my fortunes,\" said Antonio, \"are at sea, and so I have no ready  money; but luckily my credit is good in Venice, and I will borrow for  you what you need.\"    There was living in Venice at this time a rich money-lender, named  Shylock. Antonio despised and disliked this man very much, and treated  him with the greatest harshness and scorn. He would thrust him, like a  cur, over his threshold, and would even spit on him. Shylock submitted  to all these indignities with a patient shrug; but deep in his heart he  cherished a desire for revenge on the rich, smug merchant. For Antonio  both hurt his pride and injured his business. \"But for him,\" thought  Shylock, \"I should be richer by half a million ducats. On the market  place, and wherever he can, he denounces the rate of interest I charge,  and--worse than that--he lends out money freely.\"    So when Bassanio came to him to ask for a loan of three thousand ducats  to Antonio for three months, Shylock hid his hatred, and turning to  Antonio, said--\"Harshly as you have treated me, I would be friends with  you and have your love. So I will lend you the money and charge you no  interest. But, just for fun, you shall sign a bond in which it shall be  agreed that if you do not repay me in three months' time, then I shall  have the right to a pound of your flesh, to be cut from what part of  your body I choose.\"    \"No,\" cried Bassanio to his friend, \"you shall run no such risk for me.\"    \"Why, fear not,\" said Antonio, \"my ships will be home a month before the  time. I will sign the bond.\"    Thus Bassanio was furnished with the means to go to Belmont, there to  woo the lovely Portia. The very night he started, the money-lender's  pretty daughter, Jessica, ran away from her father's house with her  lover, and she took with her from her father's hoards some bags of  ducats and precious stones. Shylock's grief and anger were terrible to  see. His love for her changed to hate. \"I would she were dead at my  feet and the jewels in her ear,\" he cried. His only comfort now was in  hearing of the serious losses which had befallen Antonio, some of whose  ships were wrecked. \"Let him look to his bond,\" said Shylock, \"let him  look to his bond.\"    Meanwhile Bassanio had reached Belmont, and had visited the fair Portia.  He found, as he had told Antonio, that the rumor of her wealth and  beauty had drawn to her suitors from far and near. But to all of them  Portia had but one reply. She would only accept that suitor who would  pledge himself to abide by the terms of her father's will. These were  conditions that frightened away many an ardent wooer. For he who would  win Portia's heart and hand, had to guess which of three caskets held  her portrait. If he guessed aright, then Portia would be his bride; if  wrong, then he was bound by oath never to reveal which casket he chose,  never to marry, and to go away at once.    The caskets were of gold, silver, and lead. The gold one bore this  inscription:--\"Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;\"  the silver one had this:--\"Who chooseth me shall get as much as he  deserves;\" while on the lead one were these words:--\"Who chooseth me  must give and hazard all he hath.\" The Prince of Morocco, as brave as he  was black, was among the first to submit to this test. He chose the  gold casket, for he said neither base lead nor silver could contain her  picture. So be chose the gold casket, and found inside the likeness of  what many men desire--death.    After him came the haughty Prince of Arragon, and saying, \"Let me have  what I deserve--surely I deserve the lady,\" he chose the silver one, and  found inside a fool's head. \"Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?\"  he cried.    Then at last came Bassanio, and Portia would have delayed him from  making his choice from very fear of his choosing wrong. For she loved  him dearly, even as he loved her. \"But,\" said Bassanio, \"let me choose at  once, for, as I am, I live upon the rack.\"    Then Portia bade her servants to bring music and play while her gallant  lover made his choice. And Bassanio took the oath and walked up to the  caskets--the musicians playing softly the while. \"Mere outward show,\" he  said, \"is to be despised. The world is still deceived with ornament, and  so no gaudy gold or shining silver for me. I choose the lead casket;  joy be the consequence!\" And opening it, he found fair Portia's portrait  inside, and he turned to her and asked if it were true that she was his.    \"Yes,\" said Portia, \"I am yours, and this house is yours, and with them  I give you this ring, from which you must never part.\"    And Bassanio, saying that he could hardly speak for joy, found words to  swear that he would never part with the ring while he lived.    Then suddenly all his happiness was dashed with sorrow, for messengers  came from Venice to tell him that Antonio was ruined, and that Shylock  demanded from the Duke the fulfilment of the bond, under which he was  entitled to a pound of the merchant's flesh. Portia was as grieved as  Bassanio to hear of the danger which threatened his friend.    \"First,\" she said, \"take me to church and make me your wife, and then  go to Venice at once to help your friend. You shall take with you money  enough to pay his debt twenty times over.\"    But when her newly-made husband had gone, Portia went after him, and  arrived in Venice disguised as a lawyer, and with an introduction from  a celebrated lawyer Bellario, whom the Duke of Venice had called in  to decide the legal questions raised by Shylock's claim to a pound of  Antonio's flesh. When the Court met, Bassanio offered Shylock twice the  money borrowed, if he would withdraw his claim. But the money-lender's  only answer was--       \"If every ducat in six thousand ducats,      Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,      I would not draw them,--I would have my bond.\"    It was then that Portia arrived in her disguise, and not even her own  husband knew her. The Duke gave her welcome on account of the great  Bellario's introduction, and left the settlement of the case to her.  Then in noble words she bade Shylock have mercy. But he was deaf to her  entreaties. \"I will have the pound of flesh,\" was his reply.    \"What have you to say?\" asked Portia of the merchant.    \"But little,\" he answered; \"I am armed and well prepared.\"    \"The Court awards you a pound of Antonio's flesh,\" said Portia to the  money-lender.    \"Most righteous judge!\" cried Shylock. \"A sentence: come, prepare.\"    \"Tarry a little. This bond gives you no right to Antonio's blood, only  to his flesh. If, then, you spill a drop of his blood, all your property  will be forfeited to the State. Such is the Law.\"    And Shylock, in his fear, said, \"Then I will take Bassanio's offer.\"    \"No,\" said Portia sternly, \"you shall have nothing but your bond. Take  your pound of flesh, but remember, that if you take more or less, even  by the weight of a hair, you will lose your property and your life.\"    Shylock now grew very much frightened. \"Give me my three thousand ducats  that I lent him, and let him go.\"    Bassanio would have paid it to him, but said Portia, \"No! He shall have  nothing but his bond.\"    \"You, a foreigner,\" she added, \"have sought to take the life of a  Venetian citizen, and thus by the Venetian law, your life and goods are  forfeited. Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.\"    Thus were the tables turned, and no mercy would have been shown to  Shylock had it not been for Antonio. As it was, the money-lender  forfeited half his fortune to the State, and he had to settle the other  half on his daughter's husband, and with this he had to be content.    Bassanio, in his gratitude to the clever lawyer, was induced to part  with the ring his wife had given him, and with which he had promised  never to part, and when on his return to Belmont he confessed as much to  Portia, she seemed very angry, and vowed she would not be friends with  him until she had her ring again. But at last she told him that it was  she who, in the disguise of the lawyer, had saved his friend's life, and  got the ring from him. So Bassanio was forgiven, and made happier  than ever, to know how rich a prize he had drawn in the lottery of the  caskets.          TIMON OF ATHENS        Four hundred years before the birth of Christ, a man lived in Athens  whose generosity was not only great, but absurd. He was very rich, but  no worldly wealth was enough for a man who spent and gave like Timon. If  anybody gave Timon a horse, he received from Timon twenty better horses.  If anybody borrowed money of Timon and offered to repay it, Timon was  offended. If a poet had written a poem and Timon had time to read it, he  would be sure to buy it; and a painter had only to hold up his canvas in  front of Timon to receive double its market price.    Flavius, his steward, looked with dismay at his reckless mode of life.  When Timon's house was full of noisy lords drinking and spilling costly  wine, Flavius would sit in a cellar and cry. He would say to himself,  \"There are ten thousand candles burning in this house, and each of those  singers braying in the concert-room costs a poor man's yearly income a  night;\" and he would remember a terrible thing said by Apemantus, one of  his master's friends, \"O what a number of men eat Timon, and Timon sees  them not!\"    Of course, Timon was much praised.    A jeweler who sold him a diamond pretended that it was not quite perfect  till Timon wore it. \"You mend"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14300"],[0,"The Life of Napoleon I (Complete) (#17)"],[1,"   For the exercise of all these gifts what land was so fitted as the  mosaic of States which was dignified with the name of Italy?    That land had long been the battle-ground of the Bourbons and the  Hapsburgs; and their rivalries, aided by civic dissensions, had  reduced the people that once had given laws to Europe into a condition  of miserable weakness. Europe was once the battle-field of the Romans:  Italy was now the battle-field of Europe. The Hapsburgs dominated the  north, where they held the rich Duchy of Milan, along with the great  stronghold of Mantua, and some scattered imperial fiefs. A scion of  the House of Austria reigned at Florence over the prosperous Duchy of  Tuscany. Modena and Lucca were under the general control of the Court  of Vienna. The south of the peninsula, along with Sicily, was swayed  by Ferdinand IV., a descendant of the Spanish Bourbons, who kept his  people in a condition of mediaeval ignorance and servitude; and this  dynasty controlled the Duchy of Parma. The Papal States were also sunk  in the torpor of the Middle Ages; but in the northern districts of  Bologna and Ferrara, known as the \"Legations,\" the inhabitants still  remembered the time of their independence, and chafed under the  irritating restraints of Papal rule. This was seen when the leaven of  French revolutionary thought began to ferment in Italian towns. Two  young men of Bologna were so enamoured of the new ideas, as to raise  an Italian tricolour flag, green, white, and red, and summon their  fellow-citizens to revolt against the rule of the Pope's legate  (November, 1794). The revolt was crushed, and the chief offenders were  hanged; but elsewhere the force of democracy made itself felt,  especially among the more virile peoples of Northern Italy. Lombardy  and Piedmont throbbed with suppressed excitement. Even when the King  of Sardinia, Victor Amadeus III., was waging war against the French  Republic, the men of Turin were with difficulty kept from revolt; and,  as we have seen, the Austro-Sardinian alliance was powerless to  recover Savoy and Nice from the soldiers of liberty or to guard the  Italian Riviera from invasion.    In fact, Bonaparte--for he henceforth spelt his name thus--detected  the political weakness of the Hapsburgs' position in Italy. Masters of  eleven distinct peoples north of the Alps, how could they hope  permanently to dominate a wholly alien people south of that great  mountain barrier? The many failures of the old Ghibelline or Imperial  party in face of any popular impulse which moved the Italian nature to  its depths revealed the artificiality of their rule. Might not such an  impulse be imparted by the French Revolution? And would not the hopes  of national freedom and of emancipation from feudal imposts fire these  peoples with zeal for the French cause? Evidently there were vast  possibilities in a democratic propaganda. At the outset Bonaparte's  racial sympathies were warmly aroused for the liberation of  Italy; and though his judgment was to be warped by the promptings of  ambition, he never lost sight of the welfare of the people whence he  was descended. In his \"Memoirs written at St. Helena\" he summed up his  convictions respecting the Peninsula in this statesmanlike utterance:  \"Italy, isolated within its natural limits, separated by the sea and  by very high mountains from the rest of Europe, seems called to be a  great and powerful nation.... Unity in manners, language, literature  ought finally, in a future more or less remote, to unite its  inhabitants under a single government.... Rome is beyond doubt the  capital which the Italians will one day choose.\" A prophetic saying:  it came from a man who, as conqueror and organizer, awakened that  people from the torpor of centuries and breathed into it something of  his own indomitable energy.    And then again, the Austrian possessions south of the Alps were  difficult to hold for purely military reasons. They were separated  from Vienna by difficult mountain ranges through which armies  struggled with difficulty. True, Mantua was a formidable stronghold,  but no fortress could make the Milanese other than a weak and  straggling territory, the retention of which by the Court of Vienna  was a defiance to the gospel of nature of which Rousseau was the  herald and Bonaparte the militant exponent.    The Austro-Sardinian forces were now occupying the pass which  separates the Apennines from the Maritime Alps north of the town of  Savona. They were accordingly near the headwaters of the Bormida and  the Tanaro, two of the chief affluents of the River Po: and roads  following those river valleys led, the one north-east, in the  direction of Milan, the other north-west towards Turin, the Sardinian  capital. A wedge of mountainous country separated these roads as they  diverged from the neighbourhood of Montenotte. Here obviously was the  vulnerable point of the Austro-Sardinian position. Here therefore  Bonaparte purposed to deliver his first strokes, foreseeing that,  should he sever the allies, he would have in his favour every  advantage both political and topographical.    All this was possible to a commander who could overcome the initial  difficulties. But these difficulties were enormous. The position of  the French Army of Italy in March, 1796, was precarious. Its  detachments, echelonned near the coast from Savona to Loano, and  thence to Nice, or inland to the Col di Tende, comprised in all  42,000 men, as against the Austro-Sardinian forces amounting to  52,000 men.[36] Moreover, the allies occupied strong positions on the  northern slopes of the Maritime Alps and Apennines, and, holding the  inner and therefore shorter curve, they could by a dextrous  concentration have pushed their more widely scattered opponents on to  the shore, where the republicans would have been harassed by the guns  of the British cruisers. Finally, Bonaparte's troops were badly  equipped, worse clad, and were not paid at all. On his arrival at Nice  at the close of March, the young commander had to disband one  battalion for mutinous conduct.[37] For a brief space it seemed  doubtful how the army would receive this slim, delicate-looking youth,  known hitherto only as a skilful artillerist at Toulon and in the  streets of Paris. But he speedily gained the respect and confidence of  the rank and file, not only by stern punishment of the mutineers, but  by raising money from a local banker, so as to make good some of the  long arrears of pay. Other grievances he rectified by prompt  reorganization of the commissariat and kindred departments. But, above  all, by his burning words he thrilled them: \"Soldiers, you are half  starved and half naked. The Government owes you much, but can do  nothing for you. Your patience and courage are honourable to you, but  they procure you neither advantage nor glory. I am about to lead you  into the most fertile valleys of the world: there you will find  flourishing cities and teeming provinces: there you will reap honour,  glory, and riches. Soldiers of the Army of Italy, will you lack  courage?\" Two years previously so open a bid for the soldiers'  allegiance would have conducted any French commander forthwith to the  guillotine.    [Illustration: MAP TO ILLUSTRATE THE CAMPAIGNS IN NORTH ITALY.]    But much had changed since the days of Robespierre's supremacy;  Spartan austerity had vanished; and the former insane jealousy of  individual pre-eminence was now favouring a startling reaction which  was soon to install the one supremely able man as absolute master of  France.    Bonaparte's conduct produced a deep impression alike on troops and  officers. From Massena his energy and his trenchant orders extorted  admiration: and the tall swaggering Augereau shrank beneath the  intellectual superiority of his gaze. Moreover, at the beginning of  April the French received reinforcements which raised their total to  49,300 men, and gave them a superiority of force; for though the  allies had 52,000, yet they were so widely scattered as to be inferior  in any one district. Besides, the Austrian commander, Beaulieu, was  seventy-one years of age, had only just been sent into Italy, with  which land he was ill acquainted, and found one-third of his troops  down with sickness.[38]    Bonaparte now began to concentrate his forces near Savona. Fortune  favoured him even before the campaign commenced. The snows of winter,  still lying on the mountains, though thawing on the southern slopes,  helped to screen his movements from the enemy's outposts; and the  French vanguard pushed along the coastline even as far as Voltri. This  movement was designed to coerce the Senate of Genoa into payment of a  fine for its acquiescence in the seizure of a French vessel by a  British cruiser within its neutral roadstead; but it served to alarm  Beaulieu, who, breaking up his cantonments, sent a strong column  towards that city. At the time this circumstance greatly annoyed  Bonaparte, who had hoped to catch the Imperialists dozing in their  winter quarters. Yet it is certain that the hasty move of their left  flank towards Voltri largely contributed to that brilliant opening of  Bonaparte's campaign, which his admirers have generally regarded as  due solely to his genius.[39] For, when Beaulieu had thrust his column  into the broken coast district between Genoa and Voltri, he severed it  dangerously far from his centre, which marched up the valley of the  eastern branch of the Bormida to occupy the passes of the Apennines  north of Savona. This, again, was by no means in close touch with the  Sardinian allies encamped further to the west in and beyond Ceva.  Beaulieu, writing at a later date to Colonel Graham, the English  _attache_ at his headquarters, ascribed his first disasters to  Argenteau, his lieutenant at Montenotte, who employed only a third of  the forces placed under his command. But division of forces was"]]]
