This is now an accomplished fact, as is generally known, and can  therefore be explained in some detail without detriment. Mention will  also be made of the gradual development up to Oct. 20 in the nature of  the operations in this quarter of the theatre of war, which has recently  come into such prominence.    In its broad lines the transfer of strength by one combatant during the  course of a great battle which has just been accomplished is somewhat  remarkable. It can best be compared with the action of the Japanese  during the battle of Mukden, when Gen. Oku withdrew a portion of his  force from his front, moved it northward behind the line, and threw it  into the fight again near the extreme left of the Japanese armies.    In general direction, though not in scope or possible results, owing to  the coast line being reached by the Allies, the parallel [Transcriber:  original 'parellel'] is complete. The Japanese force concerned, however,  was much smaller than ours and the distance covered by it was less than  that from the Aisne to the Franco-Belgian frontier. Gen. Oku's troops,  moreover, marched, whereas ours were moved by march, rail, and motor.    What was implied in the actual withdrawal from contact with the enemy  along the Aisne will be appreciated when the conditions under which we  were then situated are recalled.    In places the two lines were not one hundred yards apart, and for us no  movement was possible during daylight. In some of the trenches which  were under enfilade fire our men had to sit all day long close under the  traverses--as are called those mounds of earth which stretch like  partitions at intervals across a trench so as to give protection from  lateral fire. Even where there was cover, such as that afforded by  depressions or sunken roads, on the hillside below and behind our firing  line, any attempt to cross the intervening space was met by fierce  bursts of machine gun and shell fire.    The men in the firing line were on duty for twenty-four hours at a time,  and brought rations and water with them when they came on duty, for none  could be sent up to them during the day. Even the wounded could not be  removed until dark.    The preliminary retirement of the units was therefore carried out  gradually, under cover of darkness. That the Germans only once opened  fire on them while so engaged was due to the care with which the  operation was conducted, and also, probably, to the fact that the enemy  were so accustomed to the recurrence of the sounds made by the reliefs  of the men in the firing line and by the movement of the supply trains  below that they were misled as to what was actually taking place.    What the operation amounted to on our part was the evacuation of the  trenches, under carefully made arrangements with the French who had to  take our place in the trenches; the retirement to the river below--in  many cases down a steep slope; the crossing of the river over the noisy  plank roadways of floating or repaired bridges, which were mostly  commanded by the enemy's guns--and the climb up to the top of the  plateau on the south side.    The rest of the move was a complicated feat of transportation which cut  across some of the lines of communication of our allies; but it requires  no description here. In spite of the various difficulties, the whole  strategic operation of transferring the large number of troops from the  Aisne was carried out without loss and practically without a hitch.    As regards the change in the nature of the fighting in which we have  recently been engaged, it has already been pointed out that the  operations had up till then been of a preparatory nature and that the  Germans were obviously seeking to delay us by advanced troops while  heavier forces were being got ready and brought up to the scene of  action. It was known that they were raising a new army, consisting of  corps formed of Ersatz, (supernumerary reserves), volunteers, and other  material which had not yet been drawn upon, and that part of it would in  all probability be sent to the western theatre, either to cover the  troops laying siege to Antwerp, in case that place should hold out, or,  in the event of the capture of the fortress, to act in conjunction with  the besieging force in a violent offensive movement toward the coast.    After the fall of Antwerp and the release of the besieging troops there  was a gradual increase in the strength of the opposition met with by us.    The resistance of the detachments--which beyond the right extreme of the  German fortified line near Bethune a fortnight ago consisted almost  entirely of cavalry--grew more and more determined as more infantry and  guns came into the front line, until Tuesday, Oct. 20, when the arrival  opposite us of a large portion of the new formations and a considerable  number of heavy guns enabled the enemy to assume the offensive  practically against the whole of our line at the same time that they  attacked the Belgians between us and the coast.    The operations then really assumed a fresh complexion.    Since that date, up to the 25th, apart from the operations on either  side of us, there has been plenty of action to chronicle on our  immediate front, where some of the heaviest fighting in which we have  yet been engaged has taken place, resulting in immense loss to the  Germans.    On Wednesday, the 21st, the new German formations again pressed forward  in force vigorously all along our line. On our right, south of the Lys,  an attack on Violaines was repulsed with loss to the assailants.    On the other hand, we were driven from some ground close by, to the  north, but regained it by a counter attack.    Still further north the Germans gained and retained some points.    Their total casualties to the southeast of Armentieres are estimated at  over 6,000.    On the north of the Lys, in our centre, a fiercely contested action took  place near La Gheir, which village was captured in the morning by the  enemy and then retaken by us. In this direction the German casualties  were also extremely heavy. They came on with the greatest bravery, in  swarms, only to be swept away by our fire. One battalion of their 104th  Regiment was practically wiped out, some 400 dead being picked up by us  in our lines alone.    Incidentally, by our counter attack, we took 130 prisoners and released  some forty of our own men who had been surrounded and captured,  including a subaltern of artillery who had been cut off while observing  from a point of vantage.    It is agreeable to record that our men were very well treated by their  captors, who were Saxons, being placed in cellars for protection from  the bombardment of our own guns.    On our left our troops advanced against the German 26th Reserve Corps  near Passchendaele, and were met by a determined counter offensive,  which was driven back with great loss. At night the Germans renewed  their efforts unsuccessfully in this quarter.    At one point they tried a ruse which is no longer new. As they came up  in a solid line two deep they shouted out: \"Don't fire; we are the  Coldstream Guards.\"    But our men are getting used to tricks of this kind, and the only result  of this \"slimness\" was that they allowed the enemy's infantry to  approach, quite close before they swept them down with magazine fire.    Apart from the 400 dead found near our lines in our centre, our patrols  afterwards discovered some 300 dead further out in front of our left,  killed by our artillery.    Thursday, the 22d, saw a renewal of the pressure against us. We  succeeded, however, in holding our ground in nearly every quarter.    South of the Lys the enemy attacked from La Bassee, and gained Violaines  and another point, but their effort against a third village was repulsed  by artillery fire alone, the French and British guns working together  very effectively. On the north of the river it was a day of minor  attacks against us, which were all beaten back.    The Germans advanced in the evening against our centre and left, and  were again hurled back, though they gained some of our trenches in the  latter quarter. By this time the enemy had succeeded in bringing up  several heavy howitzers, and our casualties were considerable.    On Friday, the 23d, all action south of the Lys on our right was  confined to that of the artillery, several of the hostile batteries  being silenced by our fire? In the centre their infantry again  endeavored to force their way forward, and were only repulsed after  determined fighting, leaving many dead on the ground and several  prisoners in our hands. North of the Lys attacks at different points  were repulsed.    On our left the 23d was a bad day for the Germans. Advancing in our  turn, we drove them from some of the trenches out of which they had  turned us on the previous evening, captured 150 prisoners, and released  some of our men whom they had taken.    As the Germans retreated our guns did great execution among them.    They afterwards made five desperate assaults on our trenches, advancing  in mass and singing \"Die Wacht am Rhein\" as they came on. Each assault  was easily beaten back, our troops waiting until the enemy came to very  close range before they opened fire with rifles and Maxims, causing  terrible havoc in the solid masses.    During the fighting in this quarter on the night of the 22d and on the  23d the German losses were again extremely heavy. We made over 600  prisoners during that time and picked up 1,500 dead, killed on the  latter day alone.    Much of the slaughter was due to the point blank magazine fire of our  men against the German assaults, while our field guns and howitzers,  working in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16370"],[0,"Lameness of the Horse (#17)"],[1,"to employ the  sling.    Braces and other mechanical appliances intended to immobilize the parts  are not of practical benefit in the horse. Unlike the dog, the horse as  yet has not been successfully subjected to tolerating rigid braces for  the shoulder and hip.    Everything possible must be done that will make for the patient's  comfort. If the subject turns out to be a good self nurse, and the  nature of the fracture is such that practical apposition of the broken  ends of bone may be maintained, recovery will occur in some cases.      Inflammation of the Elbow.  (Arthritis.)    Affections of this articulation other than those which are produced by  traumatism are rare. This joint has wide articular surfaces, and  securely joined as they are by the heavy medial and lateral ligaments  (internal and external lateral ligaments), luxation is practically  impossible. When luxation does occur, irreparable injury is usually  done. Castagne as quoted by Liautard[15], reports a case of true  luxation of the elbow joint in a horse where reduction was effected and  complete recovery took place at the end of twenty-five days. This is an  unusual case. The average practitioner does not meet with such  instances.    Anatomy.--The condyles of the humerus articulate with the glenoid  cavities of the radius and a portion of the ulna. Two strong collateral  ligaments pass from the distal end of the humerus to the head of the  radius. The capsular ligament is a large, loose membrane which encloses  the articular portion of the humerus with the radius and ulna and also  the radioulnar articulation. It is attached anteriorly to the tendon of  the biceps brachii (flexor brachii). The capsule extends downward  beneath the origin of these digital flexors. This fact should be  remembered in dealing with puncture wounds in the region, lest an error  be made in estimating their extent and an open joint be overlooked at  the initial examination.    Etiology and Occurrence.--Exclusive of specific or metastatic  arthritis, which is seldom observed except in young animals,  inflammation of the elbow joint is usually caused by injury. This  articulation is not subject to pathologic changes due to concussion or  sprains as occasioned by ordinary service, but is frequently injured by  contusion from falls, blows from the wagon-pole and kicks. Wounds which  affect the elbow joint, then, may be thought of in most cases, as  resultant from external violence. They may be contused wounds or  penetrant wounds. Sharp shoe-calks afford a means of infliction of  penetrant wounds which may occasion open joint and infectious arthritis.    Classification.--A practical manner of classifying inflammation of the  elbow is on an etiological basis. Eliminating the forms of elbow  inflammation, such as are caused by metastatic infection and other  conditions which properly belong to the domain of theory of practice, we  may consider this affection under the classification of _contusive  wounds_ and _penetrative wounds_.    Symptomatology.--Any injury which is of sufficient violence to  occasion inflammation of the elbow causes marked lameness and  manifestation of pain. The degree of lameness and distress manifested by  the subject, depends upon the nature and extent of the involvement. A  contusion suffered as the result of a fall, which occasions a  circumscribed inflammation of the structures covering this joint and  where little inflammation of the articulating parts exists, marked  evidence of pain and lameness might be absent. On the other hand, if a  true arthritis is incited, there will be evident distress manifested,  such as hurried respiration, accelerated pulse, inappetence, mixed  lameness, local evidence of inflammation and particularly marked  supersensitiveness of the affected parts. Considering these two extremes  of manifested distress and injury, one may readily conclude that in the  frequently seen case, wherein contusion has occasioned a moderate  degree of injury, prognosis is favorable and recovery ordinarily  follows in the course of a few weeks' treatment.    In cases of arthritis due to penetrative wounds (because of the  important function of this joint and its large capsule, which when  inflamed discharges synovia in a manner that closure of such an open  joint is seldom possible) a very grave condition results.    Treatment.--Inflammation of the elbow, such as is frequently seen in  general practice where horses are turned out together and exposed to  kicks and other injuries, yields to treatment readily, if an open joint  does not exist.    Hot packs supported in contact with the elbow and kept around the  inflamed articulation for a few days, materially decrease pain and tend  to reduce inflammation. The subject must be kept quiet in a comfortable  stall and, if necessary, a sling used. Where it is impossible for the  animal to support much weight with the injured member the sling should  be employed.    As inflammation abates, which it does in the course of from one to three  weeks in uncomplicated cases, the subject may be allowed the freedom of  a comfortable box stall. Vesication of the parts is in order, and this  may be repeated in the course of two weeks, if it is deemed necessary.    Penetrative wounds resulting in open joint are not treated with success  as a rule, and because of the handicap under which veterinarians labor,  methods of handling such cases, where large, important articulations are  affected, are not being rapidly improved. Prognosis is usually  unfavorable, and for humane and economic reasons, animals so affected  should be destroyed.    Ordinary wounds of the region of the elbow are treated along general  lines usually employed. They merit no special consideration, except that  it may be mentioned that with such injuries concomitant contusion of the  parts occasions injury that does not recover quickly.      Fracture of the Ulna.    Etiology and Occurrence.--Fractures of the ulna in the horse are not  common in spite of the exposed position of the olecranon. This bone when  broken, is usually fractured by heavy blows and any form of ulnar  fracture is serious because of its function and position in relation to  the joint capsule. Transverse fractures do not readily unite because of  the tension of the triceps muscles, which prevent close approximation of  the broken ends of the bone.    Thompson[16], however, reports a case of transverse simple fracture of  the ulna in a mare, the result of a kick, in which complete recovery  took place. He kept the subject in a sling for six weeks and then  allowed six months rest.    Symptomatology.--The position assumed by a horse suffering from a  transverse fracture of the ulna, is similar to that in radial paralysis.  Crepitation may be detected by manipulating the parts, and in some  instances of fracture of the olecranon, there occurs marked displacement  of the broken portions of the bone. Lameness is intense and the parts  are swollen and supersensitive. The capsular ligament of the elbow joint  is usually involved in the injury because fracture of the ulna may  directly extend within the capsular ligament. In such cases, there is  synovitis, and later arthritis causes a fatal termination.    Treatment.--The impossibility of applying a bandage in any way to  practically immobilize these parts in fracture of the ulna, prevents our  employing bandages and splints. Therefore, one can do little else than  to put the patient in a sling and try to keep it quiet and as nearly  comfortable as circumstances allow.      Fracture of the Radius.    Etiology and Occurrence.--From heavy blows received such as kicks,  collision with trees or in falls in runaway accidents, the radius is  occasionally fractured. In very young foals, fracture of the radius, as  well as of the tibia and other bones, results from their being trampled  upon by the mother.    Symptomatology.--Excepting in some cases of radial fracture of foals  where considerable swelling has taken place, there is no difficulty in  readily recognizing this condition. The heavy brachial fascia materially  contributes to the support of the radius, and in cases where swelling  is marked, crepitation may not be readily detected. In fact, a  sub-periosteal fracture may exist for several days or a week or more and  then, with subsequent fracture of the periosteum, crepitation and  abnormal mobility of the member are to be recognized. In such cases, the  subject will bear some weight upon the affected member, but this causes  much distress. In one instance the author observed a transverse fracture  of the lower third of the radius which was not positively diagnosed  until about ten days after injury was inflicted. In this case, without  doubt, the subject originally suffered a sub-periosteal fracture of the  bone and because the animal was a good self nurse, the brachial fascia  supported the radius until the periosteum gave way and the leg dangled.  In this instance infection took place and suppuration resulted. It was  deemed advisable to destroy this animal.    Prognosis.--In adult animals, radial fracture constitutes a grave  condition; generally speaking, prognosis, in such cases, is unfavorable.  Because of the leverage afforded by the extremity, immobilization of the  radius is difficult. Any sort of mechanical appliance, which will  immobilize these parts, is likely to produce pressure-necrosis of the  soft structures so contacted. There is occasioned thereby much pain and  the subject becomes restive, unmanageable and sometimes the splints are  completely deranged because of the animal's struggles, and much  additional injury to the leg is done. Occasionally, an otherwise  favorable case is thus rendered hopelessly impossible to handle, and the  subject must be destroyed several days after treatment has been  instituted.    Consequently, unless all conditions are good, and the affected animal a"]]]
