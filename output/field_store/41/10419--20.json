He was  angry with James; angry with the squire, who evidently viewed with  satisfaction the good understanding between his granddaughter and  nephew; angry, for the first time in his life, with Aggie herself.    \"You are growing a downright little flirt, Miss Aggie,\" he said one  day, when the girl came in from the garden, where she had been laughing  and chatting with her cousin.    He had intended to speak playfully, but there was an earnestness in his  tone which the girl, at once, detected.    \"Are you really in earnest, grampa?\" she asked, for she still retained  the childish name for her grandfather--so distinguishing him from the  squire, whom she always called grandpapa.    \"No; I don't know that I am in earnest, Aggie,\" he said, trying to  speak lightly; \"and yet, perhaps, to some extent I am.\"    \"I am sure you are,\" the girl said. \"Oh, grampa! You are not really  cross with me, are you?\" and the tears at once sprang into her eyes. \"I  have not been doing anything wrong, have I?\"    \"No, my dear, not in the least wrong,\" her grandfather said hastily.  \"Still, you know, I don't like seeing Jim, who has always been so good  and kind to you, quite neglected, now this young fellow, who is not fit  to hold a candle to him, has turned up.\"    \"Well, I haven't neglected him, grampa. He has neglected me. He has  never been near since that first day, and you know I can't very well go  round to Sidmouth, and say to him, 'Please come up to the Hall.'\"    \"No, my dear, I know you can't, and he is behaving like a young fool.\"    \"Why is he?\" Aggie asked, surprised. \"If he likes sailing about better  than coming up here, why shouldn't he?\"    \"I don't think it's for that he stays away, Aggie. In fact, you see,  Jim has only just left school, and he feels he can't laugh, and talk,  and tell you stories about foreign countries, as this young fellow can,  and having been so long accustomed to have you to himself, he naturally  would not like the playing second fiddle to Richard Horton.\"    \"But he hasn't been here much,\" the girl said, \"ever since I came here.  He used to be so nice, and so kind, in the old days when I lived down  there, that I can't make out why he has changed so.\"    \"My dear, I don't think he has changed. He has been only a boy, and the  fact is, he is only a boy still. He is fond of sailing, and of the  amusements boys take to, and he doesn't feel at home, and comfortable  here, as he did with you when you were a little girl at his mother's.  But mind, Aggie, James is true as steel. He is an honourable and  upright young fellow. He is worth fifty of this self-satisfied,  pleasant-spoken young sailor.\"    \"I know James is good and kind, grampa,\" the girl said earnestly; \"but  you see, he is not very amusing, and Richard is very nice.\"    \"Nice! Yes,\" the old soldier said; \"a fair weather sort of niceness,  Aggie. Richard Horton is the squire's nephew, and I don't wish to say  anything against him; but mark my words, and remember them, there's  more goodness in James's little finger, than there is in his whole  body. But there, I am a fool to be talking about it. There is your  cousin calling you, in the garden. Go along with you.\"    The girl went off slowly, wondering at her grandfather's earnestness.  She knew she liked her old playmate far better than Richard Horton,  although the latter's attentions pleased and flattered her. The old  soldier went straight off to the squire's study.    \"Squire,\" he said, \"you remember that talk we had, three years ago,  when your nephew's answer came to your letter, telling him that Aggie  was found. I told you that I would wager he had made up his mind to  marry her. You laughed at me; but I was right. Child though she still  is, he is already paving the way for the future.\"    \"Master Richard certainly is carrying on a sort of flirtation with the  little witch,\" the squire said, smiling; \"but as she is such a mere  child as you say, what does it matter?\"    \"I think it matters a great deal,\" the old soldier said seriously. \"I  see, squire, the young fellow has quite regained your good opinion; and  unless I am mistaken, you have already thought, to yourself, that it  would not be a bad thing if they were to come together someday.    \"I have thought it over, and have made up my mind that, in spite of  your four years' continued kindness to me, and of the warm friendship  between us, I must go away for a time. My box is still lying at Exeter,  and I would rather tramp the country again, and live on it and my  pension, than stay here and see my darling growing up a woman with that  future before her. I am sorry to say, squire, that what you call my  prejudice is as strong as ever. I doubt that young fellow as strongly  as I did before he came home. Then, I only had his past conduct and his  letter to go by. Now I have the evidence of my own senses. You may ask  me what I have against him. I tell you--nothing; but I misdoubt him  from my heart. I feel that he is false, that what he was when a boy, he  is now. There is no true ring about him.\"    The squire was silent for a minute or two. He had a very sincere  friendship and liking for his companion, a thorough confidence in his  judgment and principles. He knew his self-sacrificing nature, and that  he was only speaking from his love for his grandchild.    \"Do not let us talk about it now, old friend,\" he said quietly. \"You  and I put, before all other things, Aggie's happiness. Disagreement  between us there can be none on the subject. Give me tonight to think  over what you have said, and we will talk about it again tomorrow.\"        Chapter 6: A Storm.      After breakfast next morning, the squire asked his friend to go with  him into his study.    \"I have been thinking this matter over,\" he said, \"very seriously, and,  upon reflection, I agree with you that it is undesirable that Aggie  should see much of Richard, until she is of an age to form a fair  opinion for herself, and to compare him with other young men. I agree  with you, also, that we have not yet sufficient proofs that he is  completely changed. I hope that he is. You think he is not. At any  rate, he must have a longer trial, and until it is proved to your  satisfaction, as well as mine, that he is in every way a desirable  husband for Aggie, the less they see of each other, the better. I  therefore propose to write at once to my friend Admiral Hewson, to ask  him to use his influence, at the admiralty, to get the young fellow  appointed to a ship. Does that meet your approval, my friend?\"    \"Quite so,\" the other said cordially. \"Nothing could be better. In the  meantime, as you say, should Richard turn out well, and the young  people take a liking for each other, no match could be more  satisfactory. What I want is that she should take no girlish fancy for  him, at present.\"    \"So be it, then,\" the squire said. \"I think, you know, that we are a  couple of old fools, to be troubling ourselves about Aggie's future, at  present. Still, in a matter which concerns us both so nearly, we cannot  be too careful. If we had a woman with us, we could safely leave the  matter in her hands; as it is, we must blunder on, as best we may.\"    And so it was settled, and a week later, Richard Horton received an  official letter from the admiralty, ordering him to proceed at once to  Portsmouth to join the Thetis, to which he was appointed as fourth  lieutenant. The order gave Richard extreme satisfaction. He was  beginning to find his life desperately dull, and he was heartily sick  of playing the attentive nephew. He was well content with the progress  he had made; nothing had gone wrong since he returned, his uncle had  clearly taken him back into his favour, and he had no doubt that Aggie  quite appreciated the pains he had bestowed to gain her liking.    He detested the squire's companion, for he felt that the latter  disliked and distrusted him, and that his projects would meet with a  warm opposition on his part. Still, with the squire and Aggie herself  on his side, he did not fear the result. As to James Walsham, whom he  had come home prepared to regard as a possible rival, from his early  intimacy with the child, and the fact that his mother was her  governess, he now regarded him with contempt, mingled with a revengeful  determination to pay off the old score, should a chance ever present  itself.    He therefore started next day in high spirits, assuming, however, a  great reluctance to tear himself away. A few days later a letter came  from him, saying that he hoped that he should be able to come back,  sometimes, for a day or two, as the Thetis was at present to be  attached to the Channel squadron, and it was not expected that she  would, for some time, proceed on foreign service.    Early in October, James Walsham was to go up to London, to commence his  medical course. A week before he was to start, Mr. Wilks went down in  the morning, intending to insist on his returning with him to the Hall.  As he went down towards Sidmouth, the old soldier noticed how strongly  the wind was blowing, the trees were swaying and thrashing in the wind,  the clouds were flying past overhead. Everything portended a severe  gale.    Finding, at Mrs. Walsham's, that James was down on the beach, he  continued his course until he joined him there. James was standing with  a group of fishermen, who were looking seaward. Now that he was exposed  to the full force of the wind, Mr. Wilks felt that, not only was it  going to blow a gale, but that it was blowing one already. The heavy  clouds on the horizon seemed to lie upon the water, the waves were  breaking with great force upon the beach, and the fishermen had hauled  their boats up across the road.    \"It's blowing hard, Jim,\" he said, laying his hand on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17770"],[0,"Christmas Stories And Legends (#17)"],[1,"ly. \"They're all  waitin' in the front room yonder. I'll slip in the back way, whilst  you go round and give a good thump at the front door and mom'll let  you in.\"    Trembling with eagerness, Tom tiptoed round the house, managing to  slip an oblong package into the capacious depths of the big sack as  he did so. Thump, thump! how his knock reechoed in the frosty air! The  door swung wide, and Mrs. McGinnis' gaunt figure stood before him.    \"Good evenin', Santy, come right in,\" she said.    Tom had always thought what a homely woman Harvey's mother was when he  happened to meet her at the grocery, with her thin red hair drawn  severely back from her gaunt face, and a black shawl over her head.  But as he looked up into her big, kind face, so full of Christmas  sunshine, he wondered he could ever have thought her anything but  lovely. The room was small and bare, but wonderfully gay with pine and  bits of red and green crepe paper, saved from the 'fixins' at the  store. And on a large bed in the corner sat the three little girls,  Kitty with her bright curls bobbing, Josephine with her black braids  sticking straight out, and the baby with tiny blue eyes that twinkled  and shone like Harvey's.    The fine speech that Tom had been saying over to himself for the past  two hours seemed to vanish into thin air before this excited little  audience. But in faltering, stammering tones, which everyone was too  excited to notice, he managed to say something about \"Merry Christmas\"  and \"good children\" and then proceeded to open the magic sack. \"Miss  Kitty McGinnis!\" he called, in deep, gruff tones. Kitty took the box  he offered with shy embarrassment, slowly drew back the lid and gave a  cry of amazement and delight. \"A doll, O the loveliest doll that ever  was!\" she cried. Then turning to her brother, she whispered as softly  as excitement would permit, \"O Harvey, I'm afeard ye paid too much!\"    \"Aw, go on!\" said Harvey, his face more like a full moon than ever.  \"Don't ye know that Santy kin do whatever he wants to?\"    The other dolls were received with raptures, Josephine stroking the  golden curls of the Lady Matilda with wondering fingers, and the baby  dancing round and round, waving the pink-robed Lady Clarabel above her  head.    \"Mr. Harvey McGinnis!\" came the gruff tones of Santa Claus; and Harvey  smiled over to his mother as he drew out a pair of stout cloth gloves.    \"Mrs. McGinnis!\" And that good lady smiled back, as she shook out a  dainty white apron with a coarse embroidery ruffle.    \"I reckon Santy wanted you to wear that of a Sunday afternoon,\" said  Harvey, awkwardly.    \"And I'll be proud to do it!\" said his mother.    Little sacks of candy were next produced and everyone settled down to  enjoy it, thinking that the bottom of the big sack must be reached,  when Santa called out in tones that trembled beneath the gruffness,  \"Another package for Mr. Harvey McGinnis!\"    \"Fer me--why--what--\" said Harvey, taking the heavy oblong bundle;  then, as the sparkling \"Club House\" skates met his view, his face lit  up with a glory that Tom never forgot. The glory lasted but a moment,  then he turned a troubled face toward the bulky old saint.    \"You never ought to a done it,\" he said. \"These must have cost a lot!\"    \"Aw, go on,\" was the reply in a distinctly boyish tone, \"don't you  know that Santy can do whatever he wants to?\" and, with a prodigious  bow, old Santa was gone.    A few minutes later, a slender boy with a bundle under his arm, was  skating swiftly down the shining river in the moonlight. As he rounded  the bend, a tall figure in a fur-trimmed coat came skimming slowly  toward him, and a voice called out in Ralph Evans' condescending  tones, \"Well, how are the 'Jolly Ramblers' doing tonight?\"    But the answer, this time, was clear and glad and triumphant. \"The  best in the world,\" said Tom, \"and isn't this the glorious night for  skating?\"          THE WORKER IN SANDALWOOD[*]    By Marjorie L. C. Pickthall      The good cure of Terminaison says that this tale of Hyacinthe's is all  a dream. But then Madame points triumphantly to the little cabinet of  sandalwood in the corner of her room. It had stood there for many  years now, and the dust has gathered in the fine lines of the little  birds' feathers, and softened the petals of the lilies carved at the  corners. And the wood has taken on a golden gleam like the memory of a  sunset.    \"What of that, my friend?\" says Madame, pointing to the cabinet. And  the old cure bows his head.    \"It may be so. God is very good,\" he says gently. But he is never  quite sure what he may believe.    On that winter day long ago, Hyacinthe was quite sure of one thing and  that was that the workshop was very cold. There was no fire in it, and  only one little lamp when the early dark drew on. The tools were so  cold they scorched his fingers, and feet were so cold he danced  clumsily in the shavings to warm them. He was a great clumsy boy of  fourteen, dark-faced, dull-eyed, and uncared for. He was clumsy  because it is impossible to be graceful when you are growing very fast  and have not enough to eat. He was dull-eyed because all eyes met his  unlovingly. He was uncared for because no one knew the beauty of his  soul. But his heavy young hands could carve things like birds and  flowers perfectly. On this winter evening he was just wondering if he  might lay aside the tools, and creep home to the cold loft where he  slept, when he heard Pierre L'Oreillard's voice shouting outside.    \"Be quick, be quick, and open the door, thou _imbecile_. It is I, thy  master.\"    \"_Oui, mon maitre_,\" said Hyacinthe, and he shambled to the door and  opened it.    \"Slow worm!\" cried Pierre, and he cuffed Hyacinthe as he passed in.  Hyacinthe rubbed his head and said nothing. He was used to blows. He  wondered why his master was in the workshop at that time of day  instead of drinking brandy at the Cinq Chateaux.    Pierre L'Oreillard had a small heavy bundle under his arm, wrapped in  sacking, and then in burlap, and then in fine soft cloths. He laid it  on a pile of shavings, and unfolded it carefully; and a dim sweetness  filled the dark shed and hung heavily in the thin winter sunbeams.    \"It is a piece of wood,\" said Hyacinthe in slow surprise. He knew that  such wood had never been seen in Terminaison.    Pierre L'Oreillard rubbed the wood respectfully with his knobby  fingers.    \"It is sandalwood,\" he explained to Hyacinthe, pride of knowledge  making him quite amiable, \"a most precious wood that grows in warm  countries, thou great goblin. Smell it, idiot. It is sweeter than  cedar. It is to make a cabinet for the old Madame at the big house.\"    \"_Oui, mon maitre_,\" said the dull Hyacinthe.    \"Thy great hands shall shape and smooth the wood, _nigaud_, and I  will render it beautiful,\" said Pierre, puffing out his chest.    \"Yes, Master,\" answered Hyacinthe humbly, \"and when is it to be ready  for Madame?\"    \"Madame will want it perhaps next week, for that is Christmas. It is  to be finished and ready on the holy festival, great sluggard. Hearest  thou?\" and he cuffed Hyacinthe's ears again furiously.    Hyacinthe knew that the making of the cabinet would fall to him, as  most of the other work did. When Pierre L'Oreillard was gone he  touched the strange sweet wood and at last laid his cheek against it,  while the fragrance caught his breath. \"How it is beautiful!\" said  Hyacinthe, and for a moment his eyes glowed, and he was happy. Then  the light passed and with bent head he shuffled back to his bench  through a foam of white shavings curling almost to his knees.    \"Madame will want the cabinet for Christmas,\" repeated Hyacinthe to  himself, and fell to work harder than ever, though it was so cold in  the shed that his breath hung in the air like a little silvery cloud.  There was a tiny window on his right, through which, when it was clear  of frost, one looked on Terminaison; and that was cheerful, and made  him whistle. But to the left, through the chink of the ill-fitting  door, there was nothing to be seen but the forest, and the road dying  under the snow.    Brandy was good at the Cinq Chateaux and Pierre L'Oreillard gave  Hyacinthe plenty of directions, but no further help with the cabinet.    \"That is to be finished for Madame at the festival, sluggard,\" said he  every day, cuffing Hyacinthe about the head, \"finished, and with a  prettiness about the corners, hearest thou, _ourson_?\"    \"Yes, Monsieur,\" said Hyacinthe in his slow way; \"I will try to finish  it. But if I hurry I shall spoil it.\"    Pierre's little eyes flickered. \"See that it is done, and done  properly. I suffer from a delicacy of the constitution and a little  feebleness of the legs these days, so that I cannot handle the tools  properly. I must leave this work to thee, _gacheur_. And stand up and  touch a hand to thy cap when I speak to thee, slow-worm.\"    \"Yes, monsieur,\" said Hyacinthe wearily.    It is hard to do all the work and to be beaten into the bargain. And  fourteen is not very old. Hyacinthe worked on at the cabinet with his  slow and exquisite skill. But on Christmas eve he was still at work,  and the cabinet unfinished.    \"The master will beat me,\" thought Hyacinthe, and he trembled a  little, for Pierre's beatings were cruel. \"But if I hurry, I shall  spoil the wood, and it is too beautiful to be spoiled.\"    But he trembled again when Pierre came into the workshop, and he stood  up and touched his cap.    \"Is the cabinet finished, _imbecile_?\" asked Pierre. And Hyacinthe  answered in a low voice, \"No, it is not finished yet, monsieur.\"    \"Then work on it all night, and show it to me completed in the  morning, or thy bones shall mourn thine idleness,\" said Pierre, with a  wicked look in his little eyes. And he shut Hyacinthe into the shed  with a smoky lamp, his tools, and the sandalwood cabinet.    It was nothing unusual. He had been often left before to "]]]
