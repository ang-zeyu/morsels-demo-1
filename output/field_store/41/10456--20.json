She may be a real  success if she can only convince herself that this is her forte. If not,  and she dreams of other fields of service, her concentration on the  thing at hand is not perfect enough for her to compete successfully with  the \"born nurse.\"    Whatever it is, the thing that gets our chief attention is the most  important to us. It may be lack of appetite, or pain in the side,  indigestion, general disability, discomfort, the mistreatment we once  received, the mistake we once made, or the sin we committed--whatever it  is that holds our attention, it is the most absorbing and interesting  thing in the universe, though it may be an utterly morbid interest, an  unhappy attention. But it blots out for the time the rest of the world.  A big hint for the nurse exists therein. Let her try in every lawful way  to divert her patient's attention from the disease-breeding stimuli  toward the happy and wholesome ones.    For the nurse herself in the care of patients let us draw some  conclusions from these laws of the mind's working:    1. Have a goal in view for the patient's health of both body and mind.    2. Work toward instilling in your patient a health ambition--a pride in  health.    3. Remember that overcrowding the mind defeats your purpose of making  one clear impression.    4. Win interest by any legitimate means to the next step toward the  goal, and only the next.    5. Work for attention to hopeful, courageous, and happy things.    Let us as nurses remember always that it is for the patient's sake and  not for our own that certain results must be obtained. Our work is  usually in helping the doctor to get the best possibilities out of the  material at hand, and we cannot hope to change the fabric. But we can  help to repair it; we can sometimes influence the color and suggest some  details of the pattern, or assist in the \"making over\" process; and when  the fabric is substantial and beautiful we may assist in preventing its  marring. So we may help to evolve a body-health and mind-health attitude  from what seemed the wreckage of a disease-accepting mind; or we may  have the great privilege of warding off the disease-accepting attitude.  But always, in all our care of patients, let us not neglect or fail to  use wisely this central fact of psychology; that anything that gains  attention, even for a moment, leaves its impress on the mind; that the  direction of attention determines our general reaction to life.          CHAPTER XI    GETTING THE PATIENT'S POINT OF VIEW      WHAT DETERMINES THE POINT OF VIEW    The point of view of any individual depends upon temperament, present  conditions--mental and physical--and the aim of the life. That is, it  depends upon his inherited tendencies plus a unique personal something,  plus all the facts of his environment and experience, plus what he lives  for.    Richard and Jim both live in Philadelphia, Richard on Walnut Street and  Jim on Sansom Street. Richard's father is of the best Quaker stock, with  hundreds of years of gentle and aristocratic ancestry behind him. He  followed his father and his grandfather into the profession of medicine,  and is a well-known specialist, alert, keen, expert, and deservedly  honored. He is at home in Greek and Latin, French, and the sciences. He  selects at a glance only the conservative best in art and music and  literature. His world is a gentleman's world, a scholar's world, and the  world of a scientist and a humanitarian. And Richard, his son, is true  to type.    Jim's father is the ash man. His world is in the alleys and basements.  His pastime, cheap movies, and the park on Sundays. When he is not  working he is too \"dead tired\" for anything heavier than the Sunday  Supplement or perhaps the socialist club-rooms, where he talks about the  down-trodden working man and learns to hate the \"idle\" rich. He spends  his money on food and cheap shows and showy clothes. He talks loudly,  eats ravenously, works hard, is honest, and wants something better for  his children than he and the \"old woman\" have had. His music is the  street-organ, the movie piano, and the band--some of it excellent  too--but none of your dreamy stuff--good and lively. And his son, Jim,  is true to type.    After the Armistice Jim and Richard, who have fought for months side by  side, go to Paris together. Richard may \"have a fling\" at Jim's  amusements for the sake of playing the game and \"seeing how the other  half lives\" and all that--but before long we shall find him in the  high-class theaters and restaurants, visiting the wonderful art  collections and libraries, riding in luxurious automobiles, and staying  in the best hotels he can find. And even though Jim may have saved  Richard's life and Richard is eternally grateful, and loves Jim as a  \"dandy good scout,\" their ways will inevitably drift apart when the one  big common interest of fighting together for a free world is over. They  will always remember each other. Jim will decide that a \"highbrow\" can  be a real man, and Richard will ever after have a fellow-feeling for the  \"other half\" and think of them now as \"folks.\" But Jim is not at home in  Richard's neighborhood and circle; and Richard is a fish out of water in  Jim's. The point of view of each has been largely determined by his  heredity and his environment.    But suppose Jim isn't true to type. From the time he was a mere  youngster the ash-man life did not appeal to him. In school he liked the  highbrow crowd; he \"took to\" Latin and literature. He has a feeling of  vague disgust when he sees a vulgar picture, a shudder when the  street-organ grinds. There is something in Jim different. He isn't in  tune with either his immediate heredity or his environment. The  contribution from some remote ancestor has overbalanced the rest, and  Jim becomes a professional man.    Or perhaps Richard breaks his father's heart. Instead of following the  trail already made, he cuts loose, frequents vulgar resorts, hates his  school work, becomes a loafer and a bum--and, finally, a second-rate day  laborer. Again, what he is himself, his \"vital spark\" has been stronger  than immediate heredity and environment, and has broken through.      GETTING THE OTHER MAN'S POINT OF VIEW    Our points of view are very frequently merely hereditary or acquired  prejudices, hence altogether emotional rather than rational. We only  with great difficulty see things through another man's eyes. It  necessitates comprehending his background fully, and standing exactly  where he stands, so mind and eyes can both look out from the same  conditions that confront him. And this is only possible for the man or  woman possessed of a vicarious imagination. Such an imagination,  however, can be cultivated.    You hate my father. He injured yours--unjustly, to your mind, of course,  for yours can do no wrong. From my point of view this father of mine is  a great, good man. From your point of view he is wicked and cruel. We  are both honest in our emotion-directed opinions. Until you can know my  father as I know him, and I can know yours as you know him, we shall  never agree about them. But I _can_ learn to understand _why_ you feel  as you do, and you _can_ learn to understand _why_ I feel as I do. I can  put myself, in imagination, in your place, and see that other man as my  father, and pretty well grasp your point of view, and you can likewise  get mine.    After all, the law is very simple. Each man is the result of the things  he puts his attention chiefly upon; and he puts it naturally upon the  things which his forebears and his surroundings have held before him.  The rare person and the trained person can assert the \"vital spark\" of  his own personality and tear attention away from the easy direction and  force, and hold it somewhere else. So he can change his points of view  by learning that there are other vantage grounds which direct to better  results. With some one else to lead the way and give a bit of help, or  with the urge of desire to understand the new viewpoint, or by the drive  of his will, he can change his own.    Let us not forget that what we see depends on whether or not our eyes  are normal, on where we look, or on what kind of spectacles we wear. Two  things we can change--where we look, and the spectacles. If our eyes  were made wrong we probably cannot change that, but we can often correct  poor vision by right artificial lenses. There are people doomed to live  in most unattractive, crowded surroundings who make a flower-garden of  charm and sweetness there, or, without grounds, keep a window-box of  fragrance. The normal person can pretty largely either make the most  impossible environment serve his ends or get into a better one. So we  can usually look to something constructive, helpful, attractive, or  beautiful; and we can refuse to wear blue spectacles.    We nurses soon realize that there are just about as many points of view  as there are people, and that if we would help cure attitudes as well as  bodies, and so lessen the tendency to sickness, it behooves us to learn  to see what the other man sees through his eyes or by the use of his  glasses, from where he stands.    Let us try just a few experiments. Hold your pain and suffering from  your appendix operation, and disappointment because you can't be  bridesmaid at your chum's wedding, up close to your eyes, and you cannot  see anything else. They crowd the whole field of vision. Look at the  world from the eyes of a spoiled woman of wealth who for twenty years  has had husband, friends, and servants obedient to her every whim. She  has grown selfish and demanding. What she has asked for, hitherto, has  been immediately forthcoming. Now she is ill, and she naturally  considers the doctors and nurses mere agents to secure her relief from  discomfort. She is willing to pay any price for that--and still she is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18845"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 7 (#17)"],[1,"lics. Athens under Pericles, and Rome under the  first Scipio cherished no prouder sentiments. At each step, here as  elsewhere, in texts and in monuments, is found, in Italy, the traces,  the renewal and the spirit of classic antiquity.    Let us, accordingly, look at the celebrated Duomo--but, the difficulty  is to see it. It stands upon flat ground, and, in order that the eye  might embrace its mass it would be necessary to level three hundred  buildings. Herein appears the defect of the great medieval structure;  even to-day, after so many openings, effected by modern demolishers,  most of the cathedrals are visible only on paper. The spectator catches  sight of a fragment, some section of a wall, or the facade; but the  whole escapes him; man's work is no longer proportioned to his organs.  It was not thus in antiquity; temples were small or of mediocre  dimensions, and were almost always erected on an eminence; their general  form and complete profile could be enjoyed from twenty different points  of view.    After the advent of Christianity, men's conceptions transcended their  forces, and the ambition of the spirit no longer took into account the  limitations of the body. The human machine lost its equilibrium. With  forgetfulness of the moderate there was established a love of the odd.  Without either reason or symmetry campaniles or bell-towers were  planted, like isolated posts, in front or alongside of cathedrals; there  is one of these alongside of the Duomo, and this change of human  equipoise must have been potent, since even here, among so many Latin  traditions and classic aptitudes, it declares itself.    In other respects, save the ogive arcades, the monument is not Gothic,  but Byzantine, or, rather, original; it is a creature of a new and mixed  form like the new and mixed civilization of which it is the offspring.  You feel power and invention in it with a touch of quaintness and fancy.  Walls of enormous grandeur are developed or expanded without the few  windows in them happening to impair their massiveness or diminish their  strength. There are no flying buttresses; they are self-sustaining.  Marble panels, alternately yellow and black, cover them with a  glittering marquetry, and curves of arches let into their masses seem to  be the bones of a robust skeleton beneath the skin.    The Latin cross, which the edifice figures, contracts at the top, and  the chancel and transepts bubble out into rotundities and projections,  in petty domes behind the church in order to accompany the grand dome  which ascends above the choir, and which, the work of Brunnelleschi,  newer and yet more antique than that of St. Peter, lifts in the air to  an astonishing height its elongated form, its octagonal sides and its  pointed lantern. But how can the physiognomy of a church be conveyed by  words? It has one nevertheless; all its portions appearing together are  combined in one chord and in one effect. If you examine the plans and  old engravings you will appreciate the bizarre and captivating harmony  of these grand Roman walls overlaid with Oriental fancies; of these  Gothic ogives arranged in Byzantine cupolas; of these light Italian  columns forming a circle above a bordering of Grecian caissons; of this  assemblage of all forms, pointed, swelling, angular, oblong, circular  and octagonal. Greek and Latin antiquity, the Byzantine and Saracenic  Orient, the Germanic and Italian middle-age, the entire past, shattered,  amalgamated and transformed, seems to have been melted over anew in the  human furnace in order to flow out in fresh forms in the hands of the  new genius of Giotto, Arnolfo, Brunnelleschi and Dante.    Here the work is unfinished, and the success is not complete. The facade  has not been constructed; all that we see of it is a great naked,  scarified wall similar to a leper's plaster.[31] There is no light  within. A line of small round bays and a few windows fill the immensity  of the edifice with a gray illumination; it is bare, and the  argillaceous tone in which it is painted depresses the eye with its wan  monotony. A \"Pieta\" by Michael Angelo and a few statues seem like  spectres; the bas-reliefs are only vague confusion. The architect,  hesitating between medieval and antique taste, fell only upon a lifeless  light, that between a pure light and a colored light.    The more we contemplate architectural works the more do we find them  adapted to express the prevailing spirit of an epoch. Here, on the flank  of the Duomo, stands the Campanile by Giotto, erect, isolated, like St.  Michael's tower at Bordeaux, or the tower of St. Jacques at Paris; the  medieval man, in fact, loves to build high; he aspires to heaven, his  elevations all tapering off into pointed pinnacles; if this one had been  finished a spire of thirty feet would have surmounted the tower, itself  two hundred and fifty feet high. Hitherto the northern architect and the  Italian architect are governed by the same instinct, and gratify the  same penchant; but while the northern artist, frankly Gothic, embroiders  his tower with delicate moldings, and complex flower-work, and a stone  lacework infinitely multiplied and intersected, the southern artist,  half-Latin through his tendencies and his reminiscences, erects a  square, strong and full pile, in which a skilful ornamentation does not  efface the general structure, which is not frail sculptured bijou, but a  solid durable monument, its coating of red, black and white marble  covering it with royal luxuriance, and which, through its healthy and  animated statues, its bas-reliefs framed in medallions, recalls the  friezes and pediments of an antique temple.    In these medallions Giotto has symbolized the principal epochs of human  civilization; the traditions of Greece near those of Judea; Adam,  Tubal-Cain, and Noah, Daedalus, Hercules, and Antaeus, the invention of  plowing, the mastery of the horse, and the discovery of the arts and the  sciences; laic and philosophic sentiment live freely in him side by side  with a theological and religious sentiment. Do we not already see in  this renaissance of the fourteenth century that of the sixteenth? In  order to pass from one to another, it will suffice for the spirit of the  first to become ascendant over the spirit of the second; at the end of a  century we are to see in the adornment of the edifice, in these statues  of Donatello, in their baldness so expressive, in the sentiment of the  real and natural life displayed among the goldsmiths and sculptors,  evidence of the transformation begun under Giotto having been already  accomplished.    Every step we take we encounter some sign of this persistency or  precocity of a Latin and classic spirit. Facing the Duomo is the  baptistery, which at first served as a church, a sort of octagonal  temple surmounted by a cupola, built, doubtless, after the model of the  Pantheon of Rome, and which, according to the testimony of a  contemporary bishop, already in the eighth century projected upward the  pompous rotundities of its imperial forms. Here, then, in the most  barbarous epoch of the Middle Ages, is a prolongation, a renewal, or, at  least, an imitation of Roman architecture. You enter, and find that the  decoration is not all Gothic; a circle of Corinthian columns of precious  marbles with, above these, a circle of smaller columns surmounted by  loftier arcades, and, on the vault, a legion of saints, and angels  peopling the entire space, gathering in four rows around a grand, dull,  meager, melancholy Byzantine Christ. On these three superposed stories  the three gradual distortions of antique art appear; but, distorted or  intact, it is always antique art. A significant feature, this,  throughout the history of Italy; she did not become Germanic. In the  tenth century the degraded Roman still subsisted distinct and intact  side by side with the proud barbarian....    Sculpture, which, once before under Nicholas of Pisa, had anticipated  painting, again anticipated it in the fifteenth century; these very  doors of the baptistery enable one to see with what sudden perfection  and brilliancy. Three men then appeared, Brunelleschi, the architect of  the Duomo, Donatello, who decorated the Campanile with statues, and  Ghiberti, who cast the two gates of the baptistery, all three friends  and rivals, all three having commenced with the goldsmith's art and a  study of the living model, and all three passionately devoted to the  antique; Brunelleschi drawing and measuring Roman monuments, Donatello  at Rome copying statues and bas-reliefs and Ghiberti importing from  Greece torsos, vases and heads which he restored, imitated and  worshiped.          AN ASCENT OF THE GREAT DOME[32]    BY MR. AND MRS. EDWIN H. BLASHFIELD      The traveler who, turning his back to the gates of Ghiberti, passes, for  the first time, under the glittering new mosaics and through the main  doors of Santa Maria Del Fiore experiences a sensation. He leaves behind  him the facade, dazzling in its patterns of black and white marble, all  laced with sculpture, he enters to dim, bare vastness--surely, never was  bleaker lining to a splendid exterior. Across a floor that seems  unending, he makes long journeys, from monument to monument; to gigantic  condottieri, riding ghost-like in the semi-darkness against the upper  walls; to Luca's saints and angels in the sacristies; to Donatellos's  Saint John, grand and tranquil in his niche, and to Michelangelo's  group, grand and troubled in its rough-hewn marble.    At length, in the north transept, he comes to a small door, and entering  there, he may, if legs and wind hold out, climb five hundred and fifteen  steps to the top of the mightiest dome in the world, the widest in span,  and the highest from spring to summit. For the first one hundred and  fifty steps or so, there are square turnings, and the stone looks sharp,  and new, and solid; a space"]]]
