Suffolk, astonished at this instance of perfidy, finding  that even the duchess of Burgundy, tired with so many fruitless  attempts, had become indifferent to his cause, fled secretly into  France, thence into Germany, and returned at last into the Low  Countries; where he was protected, though not countenanced, by Philip,  then in close alliance with the king.    Henry neglected not the present opportunity of complaining to his guest  of the reception which Suffolk had met with in his dominions. \"I really  thought,\" replied the king of Castile, \"that your greatness and felicity  had set you far above apprehensions from any person of so little  consequence: but, to give you satisfaction, I shall banish him my  state.\" \"I expect that you will carry your complaisance further,\" said  the king; \"I desire to have Suffolk put into my hands, where alone I can  depend upon his submission and obedience.\" \"That measure,\" said Philip,  \"will reflect dishonor upon you as well as myself. You will be thought  to have treated me as a prisoner.\" \"Then the matter is at an end,\"  replied the king; \"for I will take that dishonor upon me; and so your  honor is saved.\"[*] The king of Castile found himself under a necessity  of complying; but he first exacted Henry's promise that he would spare  Suffolk's life. That nobleman was invited over to England by Philip; as  if the king would grant him a pardon, on the intercession of his friend  and ally. Upon his appearance, he was committed to the Tower; and  the king of Castile, having fully satisfied Henry, as well by this  concession as by signing a treaty of commerce between England and  Castile, which was advantageous to the former kingdom,[*] was at last  allowed to depart, after a stay of three months.         * Bacon, p. 633.         ** Rymer, vol. xiii. p. 142.    He landed in Spain, was joyfully received by the Castilians, and pit in  possession of the throne.    {1507.} He died soon after; and Joan, his widow, falling into deep  melancholy Ferdinand was again enabled to reinstate himself in  authority, and to govern, till the day of his death, the whole Spanish  monarchy.    The king survived these transactions two years; but nothing memorable  occurs in the remaining part of his reign, except his affiancing his  second daughter, Mary, to the young archduke Charles, son of Philip of  Castile.    {1508.} He entertained also some intentions of marriage for himself,  first with the queen dowager of Naples, relict of Ferdinand; afterwards  with the duchess dowager of Savoy, daughter of Maximilian, and sister of  Philip. But the decline of his health put an end to all such thoughts;  and he began to cast his eye towards that future existence which the  iniquities and severities of his reign rendered a very dismal prospect  to him. To allay the terrors under which he labored, he endeavored, by  distributing alms and founding religious houses, to make atonement for  his crimes, and to purchase, by the sacrifice of part of his ill-gotten  treasures, a reconciliation with his offended Maker. Remorse even seized  him at intervals for the abuse of his authority by Empson and Dudley;  but not sufficient to make him stop the rapacious hand of those  oppressors. Sir William Capel was again fined two thousand pounds under  some frivolous pretence, and was committed to the Tower for daring  to murmur against the iniquity. Harris, an alderman of London, was  indicted, and died of vexation before his trial came to an issue.  Sir Laurence Ailmer, who had been mayor, and his two sheriffs, were  condemned in heavy fines, and sent to prison till they made payment.  The king gave countenance to all these oppressions; till death, by its  nearer approaches, impressed new terrors upon him; and he then ordered,  by a general clause in his will, that restitution should be made to  all those whom he had injured.    {1509.} He died of a consumption at his favorite palace of Richmond,  after a reign of twenty-three years and eight months, and in the  fifty-second year of his age.[*]         * Dagd. Baronage, ii. p. 237.    The reign of Henry VII. was, in the main, fortunate for his people at  home, and honorable abroad. He put an end to the civil wars with which  the nation had long been harassed, he maintained peace and order in the  state, he depressed the former exorbitant power of the nobility, and,  together with the friendship of some foreign princes, he acquired the  consideration and regard of all. He loved peace without fearing war  though agitated with continual suspicions of his servants and ministers,  he discovered no timidity, either in the conduct of his affairs, or in  the day of battle; and though often severe in his punishments, he was  commonly less actuated by revenge than by maxims of policy. The services  which he rendered the people were derived from his views of private  advantage, rather than the motives of public spirit; and where he  deviated from interested regards, it was unknown to himself, and ever  from the malignant prejudices of faction, or the mean projects of  avarice; not from the sallies of passion, or allurements of pleasure;  still less from the benign motives of friendship and generosity. His  capacity was excellent, but somewhat contracted by the narrowness of his  heart; he possessed insinuation and address, but never employed these  talents, except where some great point of interest was to be gained; and  while he neglected to conciliate the affections of his people, he often  felt the danger of resting his authority on their fear and reverence  alone. He was always extremely attentive to his affairs; but possessed  not the faculty of seeing far into futurity; and was more expert at  providing a remedy for his mistakes than judicious in avoiding them.  Avarice was, on the whole, his ruling passion;[*] and he remains an  instance, almost singular, of a man placed hi a high station,  and possessed of talents for great affairs, in whom that passion  pre-dominated above ambition. Even among private persons, avarice is  commonly nothing but a species of ambition, and is chiefly incited  by the prospect of that regard, distinction, and consideration, which  attend on riches.         * As a proof of Henry's attention to the smallest profits,       Bacon tells us, that he had seen a book of accounts kept by       Empson, and subscribed in almost every leaf by the king's       own hand. Among other articles was the following: \"Item.       Received of such a one five marks for a pardon, which if it       do not pass, the money to be repaid, or the party otherwise       satisfied.\" Opposite to the memorandum, the king had writ       with his own hand, \"Otherwise satisfied.\" Bacon, p. 630.    The power of the kings of England had always been somewhat irregular  or discretionary; but was scarcely ever so absolute during any former  reign, at least after the establishment of the Great Charter, as during  that of Henry Besides the advantages derived from the personal character  of the man, full of vigor, industry, and severity, deliberate in all  projects, steady in every purpose, and attended with caution as well as  good fortune in every enterprise; he came to the throne after long and  bloody civil wars, which had destroyed all the great nobility, who alone  could resist the encroachments of his authority; the people were  tired with discord and intestine convulsions, and willing to submit to  usurpations, and even to injuries, rather than plunge themselves anew  into like miseries: the fruitless efforts made against him served  always, as is usual, to confirm his authority: as he ruled by a faction,  and the lesser faction, all those on whom he conferred offices, sensible  that they owed every thing to his protection, were willing to support  his power, though at the expense of justice and national privileges.  These seem the chief causes which at this time bestowed on the crown so  considerable an addition of prerogative, and rendered the present reign  a kind of epoch in the English constitution.    This prince, though he exalted his prerogative above law is celebrated  by his historian for many good laws, which he made be enacted for the  government of his subjects. Several considerable regulations, indeed,  are found among the statutes of this reign, both with regard to the  police of the kingdom, and its commerce: but the former are generally  contrived with much better judgment than the latter. The more simple  ideas of order and equity are sufficient to guide a legislator in every  thing that regards the internal administration of justice: but the  principles of commerce are much more complicated, and require long  experience and deep reflection to be well understood in any state. The  real consequence of a law or practice is there often contrary to first  appearances. No wonder that during the reign of Henry VII.[*,] these  matters were frequently mistaken; and it may safely be affirmed, that  even in the age of Lord Bacon, very imperfect and erroneous ideas were  formed on that subject.    Early in Henry's reign, the authority of the star chamber, which was  before founded on common law and ancient practice, was in some cases  confirmed by act of parliament: [*] [2] Lord Bacon extols the utility of  this court; but men began even during the age of that historian, to feel  that so arbitrary a jurisdiction was incompatible with liberty; and  in proportion as the spirit of independence still rose higher in the  nation, the aversion to it increased, till it was entirely abolished  by act of parliament in the reign of Charles I., a little before the  commencement of the civil wars.         * See note B, at the end of the volume.    Laws were passed in this reign, ordaining the king's suit for murder to  be carried on within a year and a day.[*] Formerly it did not usually  commence till"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19214"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part D. (#17)"],[1,"her perform; and when Melvil, as if ravished with  the harmony, broke into the queen's apartment, she pretended to be  displeased with his intrusion; but still took care to ask him whether he  thought Mary or her the best performer on that instrument.[*] From the  whole of her behavior, Melvil thought he might, on his return, assure  his mistress, that she had no reason ever to expect any cordial  friendship from Elizabeth, and that all her professions of amity were  full of falsehood and dissimulation.         * Melvil, p, 49, 50., Keith, p 264.    After two years had been spent in evasions and artifices, Mary's  subjects and counsellors, and probably herself, began to think it full  time that some marriage were concluded; and Lord Darnley, son of the  earl of Lenox, was the person in whom most men's opinions and wishes  centred. He was Mary's cousin-german, by the lady Margaret Douglas,  niece to Henry VIII., and daughter of the earl of Angus, by Margaret,  queen of Scotland. He had been born and educated in England, where the  earl of Lenox had constantly resided, since he had been banished by the  prevailing power of the house of Hamilton; and as Darnley was now in  his twentieth year, and was a very comely person, tall and delicately  shaped, it was hoped that he might soon render himself agreeable to the  queen of Scots. He was also by his father a branch of the same family  with herself; and would, in espousing her, preserve the royal dignity  in the house of Stuart: he was, after her, next heir to the crown of  England; and those who pretended to exclude her on account of her being  a foreigner, had endeavored to recommend his title, and give it the  preference. It seemed no inconsiderable advantage, that she could,  by marrying him, unite both their claims; and as he was by birth an  Englishman, and could not by his power or alliances give any ground of  suspicion to Elizabeth, it was hoped that the proposal of this marriage  would not be unacceptable to that jealous princess.    Elizabeth was well informed of these intentions;[*] and was secretly not  displeased with the projected marriage between Darnley and the queen of  Scots.[**] She would rather have wished that Mary had continued forever  in a single life; but finding little probability of rendering this  scheme effectual, she was satisfied with a choice which freed her at  once from the dread of a foreign alliance, and from the necessity  of parting with Leicester, her favorite. In order to pave the way to  Darnley's marriage, she secretly desired Mary to invite Lenox into  Scotland, to reverse his attainder, and to restore him to his honors and  fortune.[***] And when her request was complied with, she took care,  in order to preserve the friendship of the Hamiltons and her other  partisans in Scotland, to blame openly this conduct of Mary.[****]         * Keith, p. 261.         ** Keith, p. 280, 282. Jebb, vol. ii. p. 46.         *** Keith, p. 255, 259, 272.         **** Melvil, p. 42.    {1565.} Hearing that the negotiation for Darnley's marriage advanced  apace, she gave that nobleman permission, on his first application, to  follow his father into Scotland: but no sooner did she learn that  the queen of Scots was taken with his figure and person, and that all  measures were fixed for espousing him, than she exclaimed against  the marriage; sent Throgmorton to order Darnley immediately, upon his  allegiance, to return to England; threw the countess of Lenox and her  second son into the Tower, where they suffered a rigorous confinement;  seized all Lenox's English estate; and, though it was impossible for her  to assign one single reason for her displeasure,[*] she menaced, and,  protested, and complained, as if she had suffered the most grievous  injury in the world.         * Keith, p. 274, 275.    The politics of Elizabeth, though judicious, were usually full of  duplicity and artifice; but never more so than in her transactions with  the queen of Scots, where there entered so many little passions and  narrow jealousies, that she durst not avow to the world the reasons of  her conduct, scarcely to her ministers, and scarcely even to herself.  But besides a womanish rivalship and envy against the marriage of this  princess, she had some motives of interest for feigning a displeasure  on the present occasion. It served her as a pretence for refusing to  acknowledge Mary's title to the succession of England; a point to which,  for good reasons, she was determined never to consent. And it was  useful to her for a purpose still more unfriendly and dangerous, for  encouraging the discontents and rebellion of the Scottish nobility and  ecclesiastics.[*]    Nothing can be more unhappy for a people than to be governed by a  sovereign attached to a religion different from the established; and  it is scarcely possible that mutual confidence can ever, in such a  situation, have place between the prince and his subjects. Mary's  conduct had been hitherto in every respect unexceptionable, and even  laudable; yet had she not made such progress in acquiring popularity,  as might have been expected from her gracious deportment and agreeable  accomplishments. Suspicions every moment prevailed on account of her  attachment to the Catholic faith, and especially to her uncles, the open  and avowed promoters of the scheme for exterminating the professors of  the reformed religion throughout all Europe. She still refused to ratify  the acts of parliament which had established the reformation; she made  attempts for restoring to the Catholic bishops some part of their civil  jurisdiction;[**] and she wrote a letter to the council of Trent, in  which, besides professing her attachment to the Catholic faith, she took  notice of her title to succeed to the crown of England, and expressed  her hopes of being able, in some period, to bring back all her dominions  to the bosom of the church.[***] The zealots among the Protestants were  not wanting, in their turn, to exercise their insolence against her,  which tended still more to alienate her from their faith. A law was  enacted, making it capital, on the very first offence, to say mass any  where, except in the queen's chapel;[****] and it was with difficulty  that even this small indulgence was granted her: the general assembly  importuned her anew to change her religion; to renounce the blasphemous  idolatry of the mass, with the tyranny of the Roman Antichrist; and to  embrace the true religion of Christ Jesus.[v]         * Keith, p. 290.         ** Spotswood, p. 198.         *** Father Paul, lib. vii.         **** Keith, p. 268.         v Keith, p, 545. Knox. p. 374.    As she answered in temper, that she was not yet convinced of the falsity  of her religion or the impiety of the mass, and that her apostasy would  lose her the friendship of her allies on the continent, they replied  by assuring her, that their religion was undoubtedly the same which had  been revealed by Jesus Christ, which had been preached by the apostles,  and which had been embraced by the faithful in the primitive ages; that  neither the religion of Turks, Jews, nor Papists was built on so solid  a foundation as theirs; that they alone, of all the various species of  religionists spread over the face of the earth, were so happy as to be  possessed of the truth; that those who hear, or rather who gaze on the  mass, allow sacrilege, pronounce blasphemy, and commit most abominable  idolatry; and that the friendship of the King of kings was preferable to  all the alliances in the world.[*]    The marriage of the queen of Scots had kindled afresh the zeal of the  reformers, because the family of Lenox was believed to adhere to the  Catholic faith; and though Darnley, who now bore the name of King Henry,  went often to the established church, he could not, by this exterior  compliance, gain the confidence and regard of the ecclesiastics. They  rather laid hold of the opportunity to insult him to his face; and Knox  scrupled not to tell him from the pulpit, that God, for punishment of  the offences and ingratitude of the people, was wont to commit the rule  over them to boys and women.[**] The populace of Edinburgh, instigated  by such doctrines, began to meet and to associate themselves against  the government.[***] But what threatened more immediate danger to  Mary's authority, were the discontents which prevailed among some of the  principal nobility.         * Keith, p. 550, 551.         ** Keith, p. 546. Knox, p. 381.         *** Knox, p. 377.    The duke of Chatelrault was displeased with the restoration, and still  more with the aggrandizement of the family of Lenox, his hereditary  enemies; and entertained fears lest his own eventual succession to the  crown of Scotland should be excluded by his rival, who had formerly  advanced some pretensions to it. The earl of Murray found his credit at  court much diminished by the interest of Lenox and his son; and began  to apprehend the revocation of some considerable grants which he  had obtained from Mary's bounty. The earls of Argyle, Rothes, and  Glencairne, the lords Boyde and Ochiltry, Kirkaldy of Grange, Pittarow,  were instigated by like motives; and as these were the persons who had  most zealously promoted the reformation, they were disgusted to find  that the queen's favor was entirely engrossed by a new cabal, the earls  of Bothwell, Athole, Sutherland, and Huntley; men who were esteemed  either lukewarm in religious controversy, or inclined to the Catholic  party. The same ground of discontent which in other courts is the source  of intrigue, faction, and opposition, commonly produced in Scotland  either projects of assassination or of rebellion; and besides mutual  accusations of the former kind, which it is difficult to clear up,[*]  [7] the malecontent lords, as soon as they saw the queen's marriage  entirely resolved on, entered into a confederacy for taking arms against"]]]
