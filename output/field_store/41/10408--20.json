Certain it is, Sir George Grove to the  contrary notwithstanding, that the sense of a disturbance of the  symphonic plan is not so vivid at a performance of the \"Pastoral\" as  at one of Schumann's \"Rhenish,\" in which either the third movement or  the so-called \"Cathedral Scene\" is most distinctly an interloper.    [Sidenote: _Further extension of boundaries._]    [Sidenote: _Saint-Saens's C minor symphony._]    Usually it is deference to the demands of a \"programme\" that  influences composers in extending the formal boundaries of a symphony,  and when this is done the result is frequently a work which can only  be called a symphony by courtesy. M. Saint-Saens, however, attempted  an original excursion in his symphony in C minor, without any  discoverable, or at least confessed, programmatic idea. He laid the  work out in two grand divisions, so as to have but one pause.  Nevertheless in each division we can recognize, though as through a  haze, the outlines of the familiar symphonic movements. In the first  part, buried under a sequence of time designations like this:  _Adagio_--_Allegro moderato_--_Poco adagio_, we discover the customary  first and second movements, the former preceded by a slow  introduction; in the second division we find this arrangement:  _Allegro moderato_--_Presto_--_Maestoso_--_Allegro_, this multiplicity  of terms affording only a sort of disguise for the regulation scherzo  and finale, with a cropping out of reminiscences from the first part  which have the obvious purpose to impress upon the hearer that the  symphony is an organic whole. M. Saint-Saens has also introduced the  organ and a pianoforte with two players into the instrumental  apparatus.    [Sidenote: _The Symphonic Poem._]    [Sidenote: _Its characteristics._]    Three characteristics may be said to distinguish the Symphonic Poem,  which in the view of the extremists who follow the lead of Liszt is  the logical outcome of the symphony and the only expression of its  aesthetic principles consonant with modern thought and feeling.  _First_, it is programmatic--that is, it is based upon a poetical  idea, a sequence of incidents, or of soul-states, to which a clew is  given either by the title or a motto; _second_, it is compacted in  form to a single movement, though as a rule the changing phases  delineated in the separate movements of the symphony are also to be  found in the divisions of the work marked by changes in tempo, key,  and character; _third_, the work generally has a principal subject of  such plasticity that the composer can body forth a varied content by  presenting it in a number of transformations.    [Sidenote: _Liszt's first pianoforte concerto._]    The last two characteristics Liszt has carried over into his  pianoforte concerto in E-flat. This has four distinct movements (viz.:  I. _Allegro maestoso_; II. _Quasi adagio_; III. _Allegretto vivace,  scherzando_; IV. _Allegro marziale animato_), but they are fused into  a continuous whole, throughout which the principal thought of the  work, the stupendously energetic phrase which the orchestra proclaims  at the outset, is presented in various forms to make it express a  great variety of moods and yet give unity to the concerto. \"Thus, by  means of this metamorphosis,\" says Mr. Edward Dannreuther, \"the  poetic unity of the whole musical tissue is made apparent, spite of  very great diversity of details; and Coleridge's attempt at a  definition of poetic unity--unity in multiety--is carried out to the  letter.\"    [Sidenote: _Other cyclical forms._]    [Sidenote: _Pianoforte and orchestra._]    It will readily be understood that the other cyclical compositions  which I have associated with a classic concert, that is, compositions  belonging to the category of chamber music (see Chapter III.), and  concertos for solo instruments with orchestral accompaniment, while  conforming to the scheme which I have outlined, all have individual  characteristics conditioned on the expressive capacity of the  apparatus. The modern pianoforte is capable of asserting itself  against a full orchestra, and concertos have been written for it in  which it is treated as an orchestral integer rather than a solo  instrument. In the older conception, the orchestra, though it  frequently assumed the privilege of introducing the subject-matter,  played a subordinate part to the solo instrument in its development.  In violin as well as pianoforte concertos special opportunity is  given to the player to exploit his skill and display the solo  instrument free from structural restrictions in the cadenza introduced  shortly before the close of the first, last, or both movements.    [Sidenote: _Cadenzas._]    [Sidenote: _Improvisations by the player._]    [Sidenote: _M. Ysaye's opinion of Cadenzas._]    Cadenzas are a relic of a time when the art of improvisation was more  generally practised than it is now, and when performers were conceded  to have rights beyond the printed page. Solely for their display, it  became customary for composers to indicate by a hold ([fermata  symbol]) a place where the performer might indulge in a flourish of  his own. There is a tradition that Mozart once remarked: \"Wherever I  smear that thing,\" indicating a hold, \"you can do what you please;\"  the rule is, however, that the only privilege which the cadenza opens  to the player is that of improvising on material drawn from the  subjects already developed, and since, also as a rule, composers are  generally more eloquent in the treatment of their own ideas than  performers, it is seldom that a cadenza contributes to the enjoyment  afforded by a work, except to the lovers of technique for technique's  sake. I never knew an artist to make a more sensible remark than did  M. Ysaye, when on the eve of a memorably beautiful performance of  Beethoven's violin concerto, he said: \"If I were permitted to consult  my own wishes I would put my violin under my arm when I reach the  _fermate_ and say: 'Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the cadenza.  It is presumptuous in any musician to think that he can have anything  to say after Beethoven has finished. With your permission we will  consider my cadenza played.'\" That Beethoven may himself have had a  thought of the same nature is a fair inference from the circumstance  that he refused to leave the cadenza in his E-flat pianoforte concerto  to the mercy of the virtuosos but wrote it himself.    [Sidenote: _Concertos._]    [Sidenote: _Chamber music._]    Concertos for pianoforte or violin are usually written in three  movements, of which the first and last follow the symphonic model in  respect of elaboration and form, and the second is a brief movement  in slow or moderate time, which has the character of an intermezzo. As  to the nomenclature of chamber music, it is to be noted that unless  connected with a qualifying word or phrase, \"Quartet\" means a string  quartet. When a pianoforte is consorted with strings the work is  spoken of as a Pianoforte Trio, Quartet, or Quintet, as the case may  be.    [Sidenote: _The Overture._]    [Sidenote: _Pot-pourris._]    The form of the overture is that of the first movement of the sonata,  or symphony, omitting the repetition of the first subdivision. Since  the original purpose, which gave the overture its name (_Ouverture_ =  aperture, opening), was to introduce a drama, either spoken or  lyrical, an oratorio, or other choral composition, it became customary  for the composers to choose the subjects of the piece from the  climacteric moments of the music used in the drama. When done without  regard to the rules of construction (as is the case with practically  all operetta overtures and Rossini's) the result is not an overture at  all, but a _pot-pourri_, a hotch-potch of jingles. The present  beautiful form, in which Beethoven and other composers have shown  that it is possible to epitomize an entire drama, took the place of an  arbitrary scheme which was wholly aimless, so far as the compositions  to which they were attached were concerned.    [Sidenote: _Old styles of overtures._]    [Sidenote: _The Prelude._]    [Sidenote: _Gluck's principle._]    [Sidenote: _Descriptive titles._]    The earliest fixed form of the overture is preserved to the current  lists of to-day by the compositions of Bach and Handel. It is that  established by Lully, and is tripartite in form, consisting of a rapid  movement, generally a fugue, preceded and followed by a slow movement  which is grave and stately in its tread. In its latest phase the  overture has yielded up its name in favor of Prelude (German,  _Vorspiel_), Introduction, or Symphonic Prologue. The finest of these,  without borrowing their themes from the works which they introduce,  but using new matter entirely, seek to fulfil the aim which Gluck set  for himself, when, in the preface to \"Alceste,\" he wrote: \"I imagined  that the overture ought to prepare the audience for the action of the  piece, and serve as a kind of argument to it.\" Concert overtures are  compositions designed by the composers to stand as independent pieces  instead of for performance in connection with a drama, opera, or  oratorio. When, as is frequently the case, the composer, nevertheless,  gives them a descriptive title (\"Hebrides,\" \"Sakuntala\"), their  poetical contents are to be sought in the associations aroused by the  title. Thus, in the instances cited, \"Hebrides\" suggests that the  overture was designed by Mendelssohn to reflect the mood awakened in  him by a visit to the Hebrides, more particularly to Fingal's Cave  (wherefore the overture is called the \"Fingal's Cave\" overture in  Germany)--\"Sakuntala\" invites to a study of Kalidasa's drama of that  name as the repository of the sentiments which Goldmark undertook to  express in his music.

[Illustration: THE DANCE OF THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.          _Andrea del Sarto._]          ADORATION OF THE MAGI    (_GENTILE DA FABRIANO_)    F.A. GRUYER      At the beginning of the Fifteenth Century, Gentile da Fabriano[4]  painted an _Adoration of the Magi_,[5] in which the faithful  representation of contemporary scenes is again found. The Virgin,  completely enveloped in a large blue cloak, is seated in front of the  stable, with her head piously inclined towards her Son whom she is  regarding with tender gaze. St. Joseph is at her side and behind her are  two young women who are holding and admiring the gifts offered to the  Saviour. The infant Jesus has laid his hand on the head of the oldest of  the Magi, who, prostrated, kisses his feet with devotion. The two other  Kings are much younger than the first one. They are presenting their  offerings to the Son of God, and are about to lay their crowns before  him. Then follows the retinue of these Magi; and in this throng, where  may be counted at least seventy figures on foot and on horseback, of all  ranks, of all ages, and of all sizes, it is easy to recognize a trace of  those popular festivals instituted in the preceding century. Despite  some slight Oriental disguises, one may easily recognize the bearing,  the general features, and the costumes of the Italy of the first years  of the Fifteenth Century. Gentile was also pleased to add to the \"superb  chargers\" mentioned by Lattuda, all kinds of animals, especially the  apes that the Milanese loved to include in their pompous processions.  Finally, in the background of this picture he has painted the embattled  walls of a Guelph city with two massive gates; the one through which the  Magi have entered, the other through which they will take their  departure. Is there anything here, either in the foreground or the  background that suggests Jerusalem? Do you not notice rather a  resemblance to the fortifications of Milan, with the Porta Romana and  the Porta San-Lorenzo?    [Illustration: ADORATION OF THE MAGI.          _Fabriano_.]    After having painted the frescoes of the Cathedral of Orvieto, Gentile  lived for a long time in the north of Italy, particularly in Venice. It  is very likely that while there, closer to the Orient and more  especially nearer to Milan, he painted his _Adoration of the Magi_. We  may then certainly consider this as a faithful portrayal of one of those  public ceremonials, which without doubt he had witnessed, and in which  he had most likely participated. Only, ignoring the passions and  violence of the period, he left everywhere in this painting the imprint  of his own gentle and tender nature. We know that Michael Angelo  remarked of Gentile that his name was in perfect harmony with the tone  of his works. None of them can more thoroughly convince us of the  justice of this observation than this picture. From the Virgin herself  to the most humble of the servants of the Magi, and indeed even to the  animals, that beautiful soul which had for its servant a talent replete  with delicacy and suavity may be traced.[6]        _Les Vierges de Raphael_ (Paris, 1869).

PORTRAIT OF GEORG GISZE    (_HOLBEIN_)    ANTONY VALABREGUE      When Holbein returned to London towards the end of 1531, leaving Basle,  where he had worked for nearly three years, he found himself immediately  occupied with several portraits of the merchants of the Hanseatic  League. During his first sojourn in England, he had painted the  chancellor, Sir Thomas More, his protector and friend, and he had traced  the features of several members of the aristocracy. On his return,  circumstances for his gaining access to the court were less favourable.  Henry VIII. was obeying his own good pleasure and satisfying all his  caprices, and the chancellor was holding aloof, and could not exert his  influence. Holbein did not now possess the title of Painter to the King,  consequently he had to consider himself happy in obtaining the favour of  his compatriots.    The German merchants had formed themselves into a powerful association;  they found themselves united in a kind of city, which went by the name  of Stahlhof. There they had their Guildhall, their Bourse, the place  where their affairs were managed and which contained their stores of  merchandise, and their counting-houses. It was a separate quarter, where  each one could also have his own dwelling.    The company was opulent; the industry of the members of the Hanseatic  League was chiefly in iron and the precious metals; among them were  armourers, watch-makers, and goldsmiths. In the Stahlhof, called in  English the Steelyard, and which the founders themselves had designated  the Palace of Steel, was to be noted a certain opulence and pursuit of  comfort which is to be found in all ages. After having finished their  business, the merchants formed a social circle of their own. They had a  festival-hall of their own, and they could walk about in spacious  gardens which extended along the banks of the Thames.    Among these representatives of high finance a painter might find a  choice _clientele_ that would never care about the price of an order. We  know that Holbein painted the portraits of many of these rich merchants,  for to-day we find these canvases, whose authenticity has been  established, in Museums and important collections. We may therefore  suppose that the German merchants appreciated Holbein at his true value;  doubtless they disputed the honour of having their features reproduced  by a master of such remarkable talent.    The portrait of Georg Gisze, which is before our readers, is certainly  the finest work of this series. When we saw this masterly work in the  Museum of Berlin, to which it belongs, it left an indelible impression  upon us which we still feel at this distance. It is incontestably a  masterpiece from every point of view; in the Gallery there is but one  other picture of the same kind which may be compared to it, a painting  which suggests a parallel in a single detail,--_The Man with the Pinks_,  by Van Eyck.    [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF GEORG GISZE.          _Holbein._]    Holbein has represented Georg Gisze in his mercantile office, at a  table, holding a letter which he is about to open, and surrounded by  small objects, articles for which he has use in his business and in his  every-day life. This man appears before us in a marvellous pose, among  these material surroundings and in this professional scene. Observe his  calm attitude and his almost placid physiognomy: we notice, however, the  firm and decided air of a wealthy and elegant merchant. And, at the same  time, we are sure that the type represented here is not of sudden  growth: everything about him reveals intelligence.    Georg Gisze is young; the painter has told us his name and his age in an  inscription on the wall: he is thirty-four. We do not lack information  about him. We like him under that air of youthful seriousness; we see  upon his face that dawning gravity in which the blossom of feeling  already exists, but its plenitude and maturity are still to come. And in  attentively examining our personage we are struck with his reflective  and searching glance. We seem to have a glimpse in him of an undefined  melancholy. This expression surprises us in this man, who ought to be  happy at living and who lacks no pleasures that Fortune can procure.    This is a state of mind which is indicated to us, moreover, by a motto  traced above his name on one of the walls of his office: _Nulla sine  maerore voluptas_. Why this thought? Is it purely emblematic, or does it  contain an allusion to some private matter? We are led to believe that  it is intended as a complementary explanation, that it was placed upon  the picture because it was in sympathy with a train of ideas special to  the model. Perhaps it recalls some domestic sorrow, the lively grief  left by an absent one, or by some eternal separation. A moral mystery,  which seems to us very attractive, hovers around Georg Gisze.    He has long fair hair confined beneath a black cap; his smooth-shaven  face is rather thin. He wears a rich costume, a pourpoint of cerise silk  with puffed sleeves, and, over this pourpoint, a cloak of black wool  lined with fur. The table on which he is leaning is covered with a  Persian rug, and, beside the various objects scattered upon it, you  notice a bunch of carnations in an artistically wrought Venetian glass.  These carnations, like the motto, awake in us an image, a poetical  reminiscence. Sentiment, Germanic in its essence, mingled with dreams  and vague ideals, is introduced into this merchant's office.    The master has fully displayed with supreme power, and with all the  resources of his art, the colours of the costume, the paleness of the  face, and the freshness of the flesh standing out from the background of  green panels. He has played with all the various tones of the  accessories, book and registers, inkstand, watch, and scales for  weighing the gold. Every detail, with no link missing, contributes to  form the perfect harmony of the whole.    We cannot too greatly admire the singular clearness and extraordinary  precision with which the artist has "]]]
