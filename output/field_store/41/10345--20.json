Boro Duvel, or \"Great God,\" an Old Gipsy term for Water--Bishnoo or  Vishnu, the Rain-God--The Rain, called God's Blood by Gipsies--The Snow,  \"Angel's Feathers.\"--Mahadeva--Buddha--The Simurgh--The Pintni or  Mermaid--The Nag or Blind-Worm--Nagari and Niggering--The Nile--Nats and  Nautches, Naubat and Nobbet--A Puncher--Pitch, Piller and  Pivlibeebee--Quod--Kishmet or Destiny--The Koran in England--\"Sass\"--  Sherengro--Sarserin--Shali or Rice--The Shaster in England--The Evil  Eye--Sikhs--Stan, Hindostan, Iranistan--The true origin of Slang--Tat,  the Essence of Being--Bahar and Bar--The Origin of the Words Rom and  Romni.--Dom and Domni--The Hindi tem--Gipsy and Hindustani points of  the Compass--Salaam and Shulam--Sarisham!--The Cups--Women's treading  on objects--Horseflesh--English and Foreign Gipsies--Bohemian and  Rommany.    A learned Sclavonian--Michael von Kogalnitschan--has said of Rommany,  that he found it interesting to be able to study a Hindu dialect in the  heart of Europe.  He is quite right; but as mythology far surpasses any  philology in interest, as regards its relations to poetry, how much more  wonderful is it to find--to-day in England--traces of the tremendous  avatars, whose souls were gods, long ago in India.  And though these  traces be faint, it is still apparent enough that they really exist.    One day an old Gipsy, who is said to be more than usually \"deep\" in  Rommany, and to have had unusual opportunity for acquiring such knowledge  from Gipsies older and deeper than himself, sent word to me, to know if  \"the rye\" was aware that Boro Duvel, or the Great God, was an old Rommany  expression for water?  I thought that this was a singular message to come  from a tent at Battersea, and asked my special Gipsy _factotum_, why God  should be called water, or water, God?  And he replied in the following  words:    \"Panni is the Boro Duvel, and it is Bishnoo or Vishnoo, because it pells  alay from the Boro Duvel.  '_Vishnu is the Boro Duvel then_?'--Avali.  There can't be no stretch adoi--can there, rya?  Duvel is Duvel all the  world over--but by the right _formation_, Vishnoo is the Duvel's ratt.  I've shuned adovo but dusta cheiruses.  An' the snow is poris, that jals  from the angels' winguses.  And what I penned, that Bishnoo is the  Duvel's ratt, is puro Rommanis, and jinned by saw our foki.\" {110}    Now in India, Vishnu and Indra are the gods of the rain.    The learned, who insist that as there ought to be, so there must be, but  a single source of derivation for every word, ignoring the fact that a  dozen causes may aid in its formation, will at once declare that, as  Bishnoo or Vishnoo is derived from the old Gipsy Brishni or Brschindo,  and this from the Hindu Barish, and the Sanscrit Varish or Prish, there  can be \"no rational ground\" for connecting the English Gipsy word with  the Hindu god.  But who can tell what secret undercurrents of dim  tradition and vague association may have come down to the present day  from the olden time.  That rain should be often called God's blood, and  water bearing the name of Vishnu be termed God, and that this should be  regarded as a specially curious bit of Gipsy lore, is at any rate  remarkable enough.    As for the Gipsies in question ever having heard of Vishnu and other gods  (as a friend suggests to me), save in this dim tradition, I can only say,  that I doubt whether either of them ever heard even of the apostles; and  I satisfied myself that the one who brought the secret had never heard of  Joseph, was pitiably ignorant of Potiphar's wife, and only knew of  \"Mozhus\" or Moses, that he \"once heerd he was on the bulrushes.\"    Mahadeva, or Mahadev, exists apparently in the mouth of every English  Gipsy in the phrase \"Maduveleste!\" or, God bless you.  This word Maduvel  is often changed to Mi--duvel, and is generally supposed to mean \"My  God;\" but I was once assured, that the _old_ and correct form was Ma,  meaning great, and that it only meant great in connection with Duvel.    A curious illustration of a lost word returning by chance to its original  source was given one day, when I asked a Gipsy if he knew such a word as  Buddha?  He promptly replied, \"Yes; that a booderi or boodha mush was an  _old_ man;\" and pointing to a Chinese image of Buddha, said: \"That is a  Boohda.\"  He meant nothing more than that it represented an aged person,  but the coincidence was at least remarkable.  Budha in Hindustani really  signifies an old man.    The same Gipsy, observing on the chimney-piece a quaint image of a  Chinese griffin--a hideous little goblin with wings--informed me that the  Gipsy name for it was a Seemor or Seemorus, and further declared that the  same word meant a dolphin.  \"But a dolphin has no wings,\" I remarked.  \"Oh, hasn't it?\" rejoined the Gipsy; \"its _fins_ are its wings, if it  hadn't wings it could not be a Seemor.\"  I think I recognise in this  Seemor, the Simurgh or Griffin of Persian fable. {112}  I could learn  nothing more than this, that the Gipsy had always regarded a dolphin as  resembling a large-headed winged monster, which he called a Seemor.    NAG is a snake in Hindustani.  The English Gipsies still retain this  primaeval word, but apply it only to the blind-worm.  It is, however,  remarkable that the Nag, or blind-worm, is, in the opinion of the  Rommany, the most mysterious of creatures.  I have been told that \"when a  nag mullers it's hardus as a kosh, and you can pogger it like a swagler's  toov,\" \"When a blind-worm dies it is as hard as a stick, and you can  break it like a pipe-stem.\"  They also believe that the Nag is gifted, so  far as his will goes, with incredible malignity, and say of him--       \"If he could dick sim's he can shoon,     He wouldn't mukk mush or grai jal an the drum.\"    \"If he could see as well as he can hear, he would not allow man or horse  to go on the road.\"    The Hindi alphabet Deva Nagari, \"the writing of the gods,\" is commonly  called Nagari.  A common English Gipsy word for writing is \"niggering.\"  \"He niggered sar he could pooker adree a chinamangree.\"  The resemblance  between _nagari_ and _nigger_ may, it is true, be merely accidental, but  the reader, who will ascertain by examination of the vocabulary the  proportion of Rommany words unquestionably Indian, will admit that the  terms have probably a common origin.    From Sanskrit to English Gipsy may be regarded as a descent \"from the  Nile to a street-gutter,\" but it is amusing at least to find a passable  parallel for this simile.  _Nill_ in Gipsy is a rivulet, a river, or a  gutter.  Nala is in Hindustani a brook; nali, a kennel: and it has been  conjectured that the Indian word indicates that of the great river of  Egypt.    All of my readers have heard of the Nautch girls, the so-called  _bayaderes_ or dancing-girls of India; but very few, I suppose, are aware  that their generic name is remotely preserved in several English Gipsy  words.  Nachna in Hindustani means to dance, while the Nats, who are a  kind of Gipsies, are generally jugglers, dancers, and musicians.  A  _natua_ is one of these Nats, and in English Gipsy _nautering_ means  going about with music.  Other attractions may be added, but, as I have  heard a Gipsy say, \"it always takes music to go _a-nauterin_' or  _nobbin_'.\"    _Naubat_ in the language of the Hindu Nats signifies \"time, turn, and  instruments of music sounding at the gate of a great man, at certain  intervals.\"  \"Nobbet,\" which is a Gipsy word well known to all itinerant  negro minstrels, means to go about with music to get money.  \"To nobbet  round the tem, bosherin'.\"  It also implies time or turn, as I inferred  from what I was told on inquiry.  \"You can shoon dovo at the wellgooras  when yeck rakkers the waver, You jal and nobbet.\"  \"You can hear that at  the fairs when one says to the other, You go and nobbet,\" meaning, \"It is  your turn to play now.\"    _Nachna_, to dance (Hindustani), appears to be reflected in the English  Gipsy \"nitchering,\" moving restlessly, fidgeting and dancing about.  Nobbeting, I was told, \"_is_ nauterin'--it's all one, rya!\"    _Paejama_ in India means very loose trousers; and it is worth noting that  Gipsies call loose leggings, trousers, or \"overalls,\" peajamangris.  This  may be Anglo-Indian derived from the Gorgios.  Whether \"pea-jacket\"  belongs in part to this family, I will not attempt to decide.    Living constantly among the vulgar and uneducated, it is not to be  wondered at that the English Gipsies should have often given a vulgar  English and slangy term to many words"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16360"],[0,"Scientific American Supplement, No. 561, October 2, 1886 (#17)"],[1,"ght, that which is called  \"double-twill duck,\" if possible. As the making is the same whether  cloth or carpet be used, it will be understood that the instructions  for making apply to both.    The following tools, which are few and inexpensive, will be required:  A pair of clams (Fig. 4), cost 1s. 6d.; knife (Fig. 5), 6d.; half  dozen awl blades, 1/2d. each; three or four boxwood handles, 11/2d. each;  3 foot rule, 1s.; hammer, 1s.; a packet of harness needles, size 4,  cost 21/2d. (these have blunt points); a bone (Fig. 6) will also be  required for rubbing the stiffening into place, cost about 3d.; and a  ball each of hemp and wax for making the sewing threads--hemp 21/2d.,  wax 1/2d. For making holes in the bottom where the nails or studs are  fixed, a large sewing-awl will be required; this will probably have to  be bought at a saddler's; the other tools can all be obtained at any  grindery and leather seller's.    [Illustration: FIG. 4--Pair of Clams. FIG. 5--Knife. FIG. 6--Bone  Rubber. FIG. 7--Method of Measuring Registered Frame: A to A, Top of  Sides; A to B, Top of Gussets. FIG. 8--Pattern of Bottom, Showing  Place of Nails. FIG. 9--Side Pattern Folded. FIG. 10--Gusset Pattern  Folded. FIG. 11--Pattern for Gusset Stiffening. FIG. 12--Handle,  Showing Distance of Rings.]    The awl blades mentioned above are of two kinds, and either may be  used for this work. Those generally used are of a straight diagonal  shape, making a perforation the shape of a diamond, <>*; the others are  perfectly round, tapering gradually to a fine point. To fix them in  the boxwood handles, place the blade in a vise, leaving the unpolished  part above the jaws; hold the handle above this, and commence driving  it down, taking care that the blade is penetrating the middle of the  handle. Continue tapping the handle until the ferrule reaches the  polished part of the blade; it will then be in far enough.      * Transcriber's Note: Original diamond vertical instead of horizontal.    A good serviceable pair of clams may be made by taking two staves of a  good-sized barrel, and cutting about 10 inches off the end of each.  Screw together with three screws (as in Fig. 4), and shape the  uppermost ends so that the outsides meet in a sharp ridge along the  top; this will give a flat surface within the mouth, by which a hold  of the work may be obtained. A two-inch screw will be long enough for  the bottom, which must be turned in as tightly as possible; the others  must not be less than 3 inches, as there will be a space of 11/2 or two  inches between the staves at the part where they are inserted. Screw  these just tight enough to give a good sharp spring to the mouth of  the clams when they are pressed open; this will insure the work being  held firmly while being sewn. Sandpaper them over to give a smooth  appearance, and these will be found as useful as bought ones.    A piece of basil leather will be required for the bottom and welts of  the bag. This may be purchased at a leather seller's with the tools.  Cut out the bottom first; the welts may be cut from any narrow pieces.  These must be cut seven-eighths of an inch wide, then folded over, and  lightly hammered down. This brings the two edges together, and when  placed in position, they should lie evenly between the edges of the  material. A piece of string may be laid in the welt to give it a  fuller appearance if the leather is very thin.    The following dimensions of bags when made up will enable the maker to  choose the most useful size:      No. 1, 16 by 14 inches; No. 2, 19 by 16 inches;    No. 3, 21 by 17 inches; No. 4, 24 by 18 inches.    The sizes of frames and parts when cut will be as follows:              Frame.      Sides.     Bottom.    Gussets.      No. 1, 15 inches  161/2 by 151/2  161/2 by 51/2  151/2 by 51/2    No. 2, 18 inches  191/2 by 171/2  191/2 by 6   17  by 6    No. 3, 20 inches  211/2 by 181/2  211/2 by 61/2  181/2 by 61/2    No. 4, 23 inches  241/2 by 191/2  241/2 by 61/2  191/2 by 61/2    Taking No. 1, 161/2 inches will be the length of sides and 151/2 inches  the depth. The gussets are also 151/2 deep, the width being 51/2, the same  as the bottom. Take 11/2 inches from the depth of these to allow for  covering the frame, and 1/2 inch from the length to allow for the seams,  and we have a bag 16 inches long by 14 inches deep.    And now to commence. Arrange the pieces of carpet on the board, and  mark off the size of each part required with a piece of chalk or  pipeclay. By cutting with the carpet, laying the right side up, we  shall be able to see that the pattern of it will be in the same  direction on both sides of the bag when made up. We next take the ball  of hemp, and by pushing the finger through the hole in the center of  it, drive out the end. To use the hemp from the inside is much the  best way, because the ball will stand perfectly still, whereas, if  started from the outside, it will be darting in all directions about  the floor of the workroom, and entwining itself around any obstacle  which lies there, unless it is placed securely in a box and drawn out  through a hole in the center of lid.    A hook must be fixed in some convenient place to make the waxends on,  or, as they are called in the trade, \"threads,\" which term it will be  as well to call them by here; thus a _four-cord thread_ means a thread  or waxend containing four strands of hemp, a six-cord contains six  strands, and so on. One of the greatest difficulties for the amateur  is to produce a well-formed thread. He generally finds it thicker a  few inches from the point than at any other part. These are known in  the trade as bull-necked threads; and as the mechanic finds it  difficult to use them when his employer starts a new apprentice and  gives him this job for the men, I must impress on the worker here the  necessity of making them as perfect as possible. It would be as well  if a little practice was given at breaking the hemp in the way which  produces good points. Better waste a few yards of hemp than be  compelled to abandon a thread after making only a few stitches with  it.    Gripe the hemp firmly between the thumb and forefinger of the left  hand, leaving about eight or nine inches hanging loosely down; lay  this over the thigh of the right leg, and with the right hand rub it  in a downward direction, which will cause the twisted strand to  loosen. One good stroke should be sufficient; if not, it must be  repeated until the fibers forming the strand are quite loosened. By  holding it close to the end with the right hand, and giving it a jerk  with the left, the fibers will break, and the ends of the strands  formed in this way are placed at a little distance one above another,  which, when twisted, form a smooth, tapering point.    To cast off a thread the proper way is to stand at a distance of about  three feet from the hook previously mentioned, and by holding the end  of the hemp in the left hand, pass it over the hook and bring it down  with the right, then holding with the left and breaking as above. When  sufficient strands to form the thread have been broken off, carefully  examine the points to see that they taper properly, and have no lumps  in them. Rub the wax up and down a few times, so that the thread may  be properly waxed on that portion which will be inside when twisted.  Hold the two ends in the left hand, and with the right roll each end  separately down the right leg a sufficient number of times to twist  the thread throughout. Judgment will be required in this operation, or  the thread will be a constant source of trouble if it is over-twisted.  Wax it again, and then it is ready for use. See that the points are  well waxed, then take a needle and pass the point of the thread  through the eye until it nearly reaches that part which would stop its  progress.    It must now be turned down on to the thicker portion and carefully  twisted. Smooth it down, then take the other end of thread and another  needle, and fasten it on in the same way. In selecting the awl to be  used, do not take a very large one. The hole should be just large  enough for the thread to require a slight pull to get it through.    To commence sewing take one side and a gusset and place them evenly  together, the right side of the material being inside, and fix them in  the clams. Slip the welt as previously described between the edges,  and pass the awl through the lot. Drive it perfectly straight, as upon  this chiefly depends a nice seam when turned. Draw out the awl, and by  following the point, pass up the bottom needle with the left hand.  This should be taken by the thumb and forefinger of the right hand and  the thread pulled through half its length, so forming a thread of  equal length on each side. Make another hole with the awl about  one-third of an inch from the first. This gives the length of stitch.  Pass up the bottom needle as before into the right hand, the top  needle descending to the bottom immediately after. Take hold of this  with the left hand and pull through the threads simultaneously top and  bottom, until the extremity on each side lies on and forms the stitch.  Be careful that in pulling in the latter part each thread closes at  the same time, thereby preventing a crooked seam. Repeat until the  seam is finished, then take the other gusset and place in position.  Sew this, then take the other side of bag and sew to the gussets. You  will then have something in the shape of a bag, minus the bottom. Take  this next, and fix each corner to one of the seams previously made,  and stitch it carefully round, placing a welt in as before. At the end  of each seam a stitch or two back should be taken or the thread tied  over to prevent it opening.    The outside of the bag being inward, it must now be turned previous to  stiffening and framing. The turning is done by placing the bag over  the left arm, and with the right hand commence pushing"]]]
