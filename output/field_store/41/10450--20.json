It was very like  a prize-giving. And then he called the children one by one, by their  names, and gave each of them a beautiful gold watch and chain. And  inside the watches were engraved after the name of the watch's new  owner:--    \"From the Directors of the Northern and Southern Railway in grateful  recognition of the courageous and prompt action which averted an  accident on --- 1905.\"    The watches were the most beautiful you can possibly imagine, and each  one had a blue leather case to live in when it was at home.    \"You must make a speech now and thank everyone for their kindness,\"  whispered the Station Master in Peter's ear and pushed him forward.  \"Begin 'Ladies and Gentlemen,'\" he added.    Each of the children had already said \"Thank you,\" quite properly.    \"Oh, dear,\" said Peter, but he did not resist the push.    \"Ladies and Gentlemen,\" he said in a rather husky voice. Then there  was a pause, and he heard his heart beating in his throat. \"Ladies and  Gentlemen,\" he went on with a rush, \"it's most awfully good of you, and  we shall treasure the watches all our lives--but really we don't deserve  it because what we did wasn't anything, really. At least, I mean it  was awfully exciting, and what I mean to say--thank you all very, very  much.\"    The people clapped Peter more than they had done the District  Superintendent, and then everybody shook hands with them, and as soon as  politeness would let them, they got away, and tore up the hill to Three  Chimneys with their watches in their hands.    It was a wonderful day--the kind of day that very seldom happens to  anybody and to most of us not at all.    \"I did want to talk to the old gentleman about something else,\" said  Bobbie, \"but it was so public--like being in church.\"    \"What did you want to say?\" asked Phyllis.    \"I'll tell you when I've thought about it more,\" said Bobbie.    So when she had thought a little more she wrote a letter.    \"My dearest old gentleman,\" it said; \"I want most awfully to ask you  something. If you could get out of the train and go by the next, it  would do. I do not want you to give me anything. Mother says we ought  not to. And besides, we do not want any THINGS. Only to talk to you  about a Prisoner and Captive. Your loving little friend,              \"Bobbie.\"    She got the Station Master to give the letter to the old gentleman, and  next day she asked Peter and Phyllis to come down to the station with  her at the time when the train that brought the old gentleman from town  would be passing through.    She explained her idea to them--and they approved thoroughly.    They had all washed their hands and faces, and brushed their hair, and  were looking as tidy as they knew how. But Phyllis, always unlucky, had  upset a jug of lemonade down the front of her dress. There was no time  to change--and the wind happening to blow from the coal yard, her frock  was soon powdered with grey, which stuck to the sticky lemonade stains  and made her look, as Peter said, \"like any little gutter child.\"    It was decided that she should keep behind the others as much as  possible.    \"Perhaps the old gentleman won't notice,\" said Bobbie. \"The aged are  often weak in the eyes.\"    There was no sign of weakness, however, in the eyes, or in any other  part of the old gentleman, as he stepped from the train and looked up  and down the platform.    The three children, now that it came to the point, suddenly felt that  rush of deep shyness which makes your ears red and hot, your hands warm  and wet, and the tip of your nose pink and shiny.    \"Oh,\" said Phyllis, \"my heart's thumping like a steam-engine--right  under my sash, too.\"    \"Nonsense,\" said Peter, \"people's hearts aren't under their sashes.\"    \"I don't care--mine is,\" said Phyllis.    \"If you're going to talk like a poetry-book,\" said Peter, \"my heart's in  my mouth.\"    \"My heart's in my boots--if you come to that,\" said Roberta; \"but do  come on--he'll think we're idiots.\"    \"He won't be far wrong,\" said Peter, gloomily. And they went forward to  meet the old gentleman.    \"Hullo,\" he said, shaking hands with them all in turn. \"This is a very  great pleasure.\"    \"It WAS good of you to get out,\" Bobbie said, perspiring and polite.    He took her arm and drew her into the waiting room where she and the  others had played the advertisement game the day they found the Russian.  Phyllis and Peter followed. \"Well?\" said the old gentleman, giving  Bobbie's arm a kind little shake before he let it go. \"Well? What is  it?\"    \"Oh, please!\" said Bobbie.    \"Yes?\" said the old gentleman.    \"What I mean to say--\" said Bobbie.    \"Well?\" said the old gentleman.    \"It's all very nice and kind,\" said she.    \"But?\" he said.    \"I wish I might say something,\" she said.    \"Say it,\" said he.    \"Well, then,\" said Bobbie--and out came the story of the Russian who  had written the beautiful book about poor people, and had been sent to  prison and to Siberia for just that.    \"And what we want more than anything in the world is to find his wife  and children for him,\" said Bobbie, \"but we don't know how. But you must  be most horribly clever, or you wouldn't be a Direction of the Railway.  And if YOU knew how--and would? We'd rather have that than anything else  in the world. We'd go without the watches, even, if you could sell them  and find his wife with the money.\"    And the others said so, too, though not with so much enthusiasm.    \"Hum,\" said the old gentleman, pulling down the white waistcoat that  had the big gilt buttons on it, \"what did you say the name  was--Fryingpansky?\"    \"No, no,\" said Bobbie earnestly. \"I'll write it down for you. It doesn't  really look at all like that except when you say it. Have you a bit of  pencil and the back of an envelope?\" she asked.    The old gentleman got out a gold pencil-case and a beautiful,  sweet-smelling, green Russian leather note-book and opened it at a new  page.    \"Here,\" he said, \"write here.\"    She wrote down \"Szezcpansky,\" and said:--    \"That's how you write it. You CALL it Shepansky.\"    The old gentleman took out a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles and fitted  them on his nose. When he had read the name, he looked quite different.    \"THAT man? Bless my soul!\" he said. \"Why, I've read his book! It's  translated into every European language. A fine book--a noble book. And  so your mother took him in--like the good Samaritan. Well, well. I'll  tell you what, youngsters--your mother must be a very good woman.\"    \"Of course she is,\" said Phyllis, in astonishment.    \"And you're a very good man,\" said Bobbie, very shy, but firmly resolved  to be polite.    \"You flatter me,\" said the old gentleman, taking off his hat with a  flourish. \"And now am I to tell you what I think of you?\"    \"Oh, please don't,\" said Bobbie, hastily.    \"Why?\" asked the old gentleman.    \"I don't exactly know,\" said Bobbie. \"Only--if it's horrid, I don't want  you to; and if it's nice, I'd rather you didn't.\"    The old gentleman laughed.    \"Well, then,\" he said, \"I'll only just say that I'm very glad you came  to me about this--very glad, indeed. And I shouldn't be surprised if I  found out something very soon. I know a great many Russians in London,  and every Russian knows HIS name. Now tell me all about yourselves.\"    He turned to the others, but there was only one other, and that was  Peter. Phyllis had disappeared.    \"Tell me all about yourself,\" said the old gentleman again. And, quite  naturally, Peter was stricken dumb.    \"All right, we'll have an examination,\" said the old gentleman; \"you two  sit on the table, and I'll sit on the bench and ask questions.\"    He did, and out came their names and ages--their Father's name and  business--how long they had lived at Three Chimneys and a great deal  more.    The questions were beginning to turn on a herring and a half for three  halfpence, and a pound of lead and a pound of feathers, when the door of  the waiting room was kicked open by a boot; as the boot entered everyone  could see that its lace was coming undone--and in came Phyllis, very  slowly and carefully.    In one hand she carried a large tin can, and in the other a thick slice  of bread and butter.    \"Afternoon tea,\" she announced proudly, and held the can and the bread  and butter out to the old gentleman, who took them and said:--    \"Bless my soul!\"    \"Yes,\" said Phyllis.    \"It's very thoughtful of you,\" said the old gentleman, \"very.\"    \"But you might have got a cup,\" said Bobbie, \"and a plate.\"    \"Perks always drinks out of the can,\" said Phyllis, flushing red. \"I  think it was very nice of him to give it me at all--let alone cups and  plates,\" she added.    \"So do I,\" said the old gentleman, and he drank some of the tea and  tasted the bread and butter.    And then it was time for the next train, and he got into it with many  good-byes and kind last words.    \"Well,\" said Peter, when they were left on the platform, and the  tail-lights of the train disappeared round the corner, \"it's my belief  that we've lighted a candle to-day--like Latimer, you know, when he was  being burned--and there'll be fireworks for our Russian before long.\"    And so there were.    It wasn't ten days after the interview in the waiting room that the  three children were sitting on the top of the biggest rock in the field  below their house watching the 5.15 steam away from the station along  the bottom of the valley. They saw, too, the few people who had got out  at the station straggling up the road towards the village--and they saw  one person leave the road and open the gate that led across the fields  to Three Chimneys and to nowhere else.    \"Who on earth!\" said Peter, scrambling down.    \"Let's go and see,\" said Phyllis."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18751"],[0,"A Text-book of Assaying: For the Use of Those Connected with Mines. (#17)"],[1," SALTS, &c.    ~Alcohol~, C_{2}H_{6}O. (Commercial alcohol of sp. gr. 0.838; it  contains 84 per cent. by weight of alcohol.)--It should burn with a  non-luminous flame and leave no residue. It is used for washing  precipitates where water is inapplicable, and for facilitating drying.    ~Ammonia~, NH_{3}. (Commercial ammonia, a solution having a sp. gr. of  0.88 to 0.89, and containing about 33 per cent. of ammonia.)--It is used  as an alkali (more commonly than soda or potash), since an excess of it  is easily removed by boiling. The salts of ammonium formed by it may be  removed by igniting, or by evaporating in a porcelain dish with an  excess of nitric acid. It differs in a marked way from soda or potash in  its solvent action on the oxides or hydrates of the metals. Salts of the  following metals are soluble in an ammoniacal solution in the presence  of ammonic chloride:--copper, cadmium, silver, nickel, cobalt,  manganese, zinc, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and the alkaline earths.    ~Dilute Ammonia~ is made by diluting 1 vol. of commercial ammonia with 2  of water. The dilute ammonia is always used; but in assays for copper a  stronger solution (1 of strong ammonia to 1 of water) is required.    ~Ammonic Carbonate~ (Am_{2}CO_{3}) is prepared by dissolving one part of  the commercial sesquicarbonate of ammonia in four parts of water, and  adding one part of strong ammonia.    ~Ammonic Bicarbonate~ (HAmCO_{3}) is prepared by saturating a solution  of the sesquicarbonate of ammonia with carbon dioxide.    ~Ammonic Chloride~, AmCl.--Use the commercial salt in a 20 per cent.  solution in water. The salt should leave no residue on ignition.    ~Ammonic Molybdate.~--The solution is prepared as follows:--Dissolve 100  grams of the powdered commercial salt in 200 c.c. of dilute ammonia, and  pour the solution in a slow stream into 750 c.c. of dilute nitric acid;  make up to 1 litre, and allow the mixture to settle before using. It is  used for the purpose of separating phosphoric oxide from bases and from  other acids, and also as a test for phosphates and arsenates. In using  this solution the substance must be dissolved in nitric acid, and a  considerable excess of the reagent added (50 c.c. is sufficient to  precipitate 0.1 gram P_{2}O_{5}); when the phosphate is in excess no  precipitate will be got. The precipitate is phospho-molybdate of  ammonia.    ~Ammonic Nitrate~ (AmNO_{3}) is used in the separation of phosphoric  oxide by the molybdate method, and occasionally for destroying organic  matter. It is soluble in less than its own weight of water. The solution  is made when wanted.    ~Ammonic Oxalate~ (Am_{2}C_{2}O_{4}.2H_{2}O) is used chiefly for the  separation of lime. The solution is made by dissolving 15 grams of the  salt in 100 c.c. of water.    ~Ammonic Sulphide~ may be purchased in the state of a strong solution.  It is yellow, and contains the disulphide, S_{2}Am_{2}. It serves the  same purpose as is obtained by passing a current of sulphuretted  hydrogen through an ammoniacal solution; but has the disadvantage of  loading the solution with sulphur, which is precipitated when the  solution is subsequently acidified. It is useful for dissolving the  lower sulphide of tin (SnS).    ~Baric Carbonate~ (BaCO_{3}) is sometimes used for precipitating the  weaker bases. It should be prepared when wanted by precipitating a  solution of baric chloride with ammonic carbonate and washing. The moist  precipitate is used without drying.    ~Baric Chloride~, BaCl_{2}.2H_{2}O.--A crystallised salt, soluble in  2-1/2 parts of water. It is used for the detection and separation of  sulphates. Make a 10 per cent. solution.    \"~Black Flux.~\"--A mixture of finely divided carbon with carbonate of  potash or with carbonates of potash and soda. It is prepared by heating  tartar or \"rochelle salt\" until no more combustible gas is given off.  One gram will reduce about 2 grams of lead from litharge.    ~Borax~, Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7}.10H_{2}O.--It is chiefly used as a flux in dry  assaying, as already described. It is also used in testing before the  blowpipe; many metallic oxides impart a characteristic colour to a bead  of borax in which they have been fused.    ~Calcium Chloride.~--The crystallised salt is CaCl_{2}.6H_{2}O; dried at  200° C. it becomes CaCl_{2}.2H_{2}O, and when fused it becomes  dehydrated. The fused salt, broken into small lumps, is used for drying  gases. It combines with water, giving off much heat; and dissolves in a  little more than its own weight of water. Strong solutions may be used  in baths in which temperatures above the boiling-point of water are  required. One part of the salt and 2 of water give a solution boiling at  112°, and a solution of 2 parts of the salt in 1 of water boils at 158°.  The salt is very little used as a reagent.    ~Calcium Fluoride~ or \"~Fluor Spar~,\" CaF_{2}.--The mineral is used as a  flux in dry assaying; it renders slags which are thick from the presence  of phosphates, &c., very fluid. Mixed with hydrochloric acid it may  sometimes be used instead of hydrofluoric acid.    ~Calcium Carbonate~, CaCO_{3}.--It is precipitated in a pure state by  ammonic carbonate from a solution of calcium chloride. It is used for  standardising. In the impure state, as marble or limestone, it is used  in the preparation of carbonic acid.    ~Calcium Hydrate~ or ~\"Lime Water.\"~--This is used in testing for carbon  dioxide and in estimating the amount of that gas present in air. It may  be made by slaking quicklime and digesting the slaked lime with water.  One hundred c.c. of water at 15° C. dissolves 0.1368 grams of the  hydrate (CaH_{2}O_{2}), and hot water dissolves still less. \"_Milk of  lime_\" is slaked lime suspended in water.    ~Cobalt Nitrate~ (Co(NO_{3})_{2}.6H_{2}O) is used in a 10 per cent.  solution for the detection of oxides of zinc, aluminium, &c.; on  ignition with which it forms characteristically coloured compounds.    ~Copper~, Cu.--Pure copper, as obtained by electrolysis, can be  purchased. This only should be used.    ~Copper Oxide~, CuO.--It occurs as a black, heavy, and gritty power, and  is used for the oxidation of carbon and hydrogen in organic substances.  It should be ignited and cooled out of contact with air just before  using, since it is hygroscopic. Oxide of copper which has been used may  be again utilised after calcination.    ~Copper Sulphate~ (CuSO_{4}.5H_{2}O) contains 25.4 per cent. of copper.  It is used in the outer cell of a Daniell-battery. The commercial salt  is used for this purpose. The re-crystallised and pure salt is used for  preparing the anhydrous sulphate, which is used for detecting moisture  in gases. For this purpose it is dried at 200° C. till no trace of  green or blue colour remains. It must be prepared when wanted. It may be  conveniently used in the form of pumice-stone, saturated with a solution  of the salt and dried. Traces of moisture develop a green colour.    ~Ferric Chloride~, Fe_{2}Cl_{6}. (When crystallised,  Fe_{2}Cl_{6}.6H_{2}O.)--The solution is prepared as described under  iron. The commercial salt contains arsenic, and, since the chief use of  ferric chloride is for the determination of this substance, it must be  purified (_see_ under ARSENIC).    ~Ferric Sulphate~ (Fe_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}) is a yellowish white deliquescent  salt. It is used as an indicator in volumetric silver assaying, and for  the separation of iodine from bromine. It may be purchased as iron alum,  Am_{2}Fe_{2}(SO_{4})_{4}.24H_{2}O. But it is best prepared by adding  strong sulphuric acid to ferric hydrate in equivalent proportions. Use  it as a solution containing 2 or 3 per cent. of iron.    ~Ferrous Sulphate~, FeSO_{4}.7H_{2}O.--The granulated form is best, and  can be purchased pure. It is used for standardising. It keeps better in  crystals than in solution. It is readily soluble in water, but the  solution is best made with the help of a little free acid. As a re-agent  use a 10 per cent. solution. The crystals should be clear bluish-green;  if their colour is dark green, brown, or blue, they should be rejected.    ~Ferrous Sulphide~ (FeS) is used for the preparation of sulphuretted  hydrogen. It may be purchased and broken in small lumps, nut-size, for  use.    \"~Fusion Mixture~\" (K_{2}CO_{3}.Na_{2}CO_{3}) is a mixture of potassic  and sodic carbonates in the proportions of 13 of the former to 10 of the  latter, by weight. It is hygroscopic. A mixture of the bicarbonates is  better, being purer and less apt to get damp.    ~Gallic Acid~ (C_{7}H_{6}O_{5}.H_{2}O) is an organic acid, occurring as  a pale fawn-coloured crystalline powder, soluble in 100 parts of cold  water, or in 3 parts of boiling water. It is used for the determination  of antimony. A 10 per cent. solution in warm water is made when  required.    ~Hydrogen~ (H) is a gas. It is obtained by acting on zinc with dilute  hydrochloric or sulphuric acid. It is used as a reducing agent, and for  providing an atmosphere free from oxygen. It reduces metallic oxides at  a high temperature. It must be freed from water; and special precautions  should be taken to prevent an admixture with air. It is generally  required in a current which can be continued for an hour or more without  interruption. The preparation can be conveniently carried out in the  apparatus shown (fig. 33). A quart bottle is half filled with sheet  zinc, and connected with bulbs filled with sulphuric acid, and with a  calcium chloride tube. The last is connected with the apparatus through  which the gas has to be passed. Dilute hydrochloric acid mixed with a  few cubic centimetres (20 c.c. to 1 pint) of stannous chloride sol. to  fix any dissolved oxygen, is placed in the funnel, and let into the  bottle by opening the stopcock when required. Care must be taken to let  the hydrogen escape for some time before starting the reduction.    [Illustration: FIG. 33.]    ~Gold~, Au.--Gold, obtained by cupelling"]]]
