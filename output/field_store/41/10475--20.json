The mistakes of the administrations of the       Gentiles will be pictured by us in the most lurid colors: we will       sow such antipathy and hatred toward these governments that the       masses will prefer peace and quiet in a condition of servitude to       the rights of the so-called liberty which for many ages had so       tormented them and destroyed the very springs of human existence       and which were exploited by adventurers, who did not realize what       they were doing.         \"The masses will become so satiated with the useless changes of       administration, which we instigated when we were undermining their       institutions, that they will accept anything that we may give them       rather than risk undergoing again such struggle and disorder....       Moreover, we will, through public criticism, especially emphasize       the mistakes of the Gentile administrations which caused mankind to       suffer for many centuries through lack of real understanding in all       that concerned its true welfare, pursuing fantastic projects of       social welfare and not noticing that these projects made worse       instead of better the state of general relationships which are the       basis of human existence.         \"Our principles and faith will be especially useful inasmuch as       they will be put forward and interpreted by us as a contrast to the       old and decayed order of society.         \"Our philosophers will discuss and criticise the shortcomings of       the Gentile religions, but the latter will not be able to answer       with regard to our faith, for no one is acquainted with its       mysteries except our Rabbis and Talmudists, and they will never       reveal it, for on them depends the power of guiding our flock.

In 1905, before the first Russian revolution, the  Nilus version of the \"protocols\" said \"_we will show one of them our  strength by means of violence, that is, by terrorism_.\" After the  revolution, Butmi changed this sentence to read \"_We have shown one of  these governments our powers by assassination, by terrorism_.\"    And now the introducers of the \"protocols\" in this country and in Europe  are pointing to bolshevism as the fulfillment of the \"documents\" which  have been concocted, elaborated and changed by antisemites to serve the  devious political purposes of their masters and their own.    The \"protocols\" came into the world with the trademark, \"made in  Germany\" and were elaborated under the auspices of the \"Russian Black  Hundreds\" in their efforts to save the dying Russian autocracy. When the  Russian autocracy was overthrown and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19206"],[0,"Under Drake's Flag: A Tale of the Spanish Main (#17)"],[1,"the Spaniards are coming. No doubt in pursuit of  a runaway; perhaps with those terrible dogs. The Spaniards could do  nothing among these mountains without them. They follow their game  through the thickest woods.\"    \"But,\" said Ned, \"why on earth do not the negroes take to the  trees? Surely there could be no difficulty in getting from tree to  tree by the branches, for a certain distance, so as to throw the  hounds off the scent.\"    \"Many do escape in that way,\" the negro said; \"but the pursuit is  often so hot, and the dogs so close upon the trail, that there is  little time for maneuvers of this sort; beside which, many of the  fugitives are half mad with fear. I know, myself, that the baying  of those horrible dogs seems to freeze the blood; and in my case, I  only escaped by luckily striking a rivulet. Then my hopes rose  again; and after following it, for a time, I had the happy thought  of climbing into a tree which overhung it, and then dropping down  at some little distance off, and so completely throwing the dogs  off the trail.\"    \"Why do they not shoot the dogs?\" Ned asked. \"I do not mean the men  whom they are scenting, but their friends.\"    \"We might shoot them,\" the negro said, \"if they were allowed to run  free; but here in the woods they are usually kept on the chain, so  that their masters are close to them.    \"Listen,\" he said, \"do you not hear the distant baying?\"    Listening attentively, however, the boys could hear nothing. Their  ears were not trained so well as that of the negro, and it was some  minutes before they heard a distant, faint sound of the deep bark  of a dog. A few minutes later a negro, panting for breath, bathed  in perspiration, and completely exhausted, staggered into the glade  where they were standing. The other negroes gave a slight cry of  alarm, at the proximity of so dangerous a comrade.    \"Save me,\" the man cried. \"I am pursued.\"    \"How many men are after you?\" Ned asked.    The negro started in astonishment, at seeing a white face and being  questioned in Spanish. Seeing, however, that his comrades were on  good terms with his questioner, he answered at once:    \"There are some twenty of them, with two dogs.\"    \"Let us give them a sharp lesson,\" Ned said to the negroes standing  round. \"We have made preparations, and it is time that we began to  show our teeth. If they find that they cannot come with impunity  into our woods, they will not be so anxious to pursue single men;  and will leave us alone, except they bring all the force of the  island against us.\"    The negroes looked doubtful as to the wisdom of taking the  initiative, so great was their fear of the Spaniards. However, the  cheerfulness with which the two English boys proposed resistance  animated them; and, with sharp whistles, they called the whole of  their comrades to the place.    Ned briefly explained their intentions.    \"There is no time to be lost. We must take our places on the upper  ground of that narrow valley, and tell the man to run straight  through. We have plenty of stones piled there, and may give the  Spaniards a warmer reception than they expect. We could not have a  better opportunity; for, with such small numbers as they have, they  certainly would not be able to attack us, with any hope of success,  up so steep a hillside.\"    The valley which Ned indicated was not one of those which led in  the direction of their stronghold; but it was a very steep gorge,  which they had remarked as being particularly well fitted for  checking a pursuing party; and for that end had prepared piles of  stones on the upper heights. The negroes, taking with them the  sharpened poles which they used as spears, and their bows and  arrows, started, under Ned and Gerald, to the indicated spot.  Gerald had arranged to go with a party to one side of the gorge,  Ned to the other; but they decided that it was better that they  should keep together, the more to encourage the natives; and while  a few negroes were sent to one side of the gorge, the main body,  under the two English lads, kept together on the other. The  fugitive had already gone ahead, with one of the negroes to show  him the way.    Scarcely had they taken their places, at the top of the gorge; when  the baying of the hounds, which had been increasing every minute in  volume, became so loud that the Spaniards were clearly close at  hand. In another three or four minutes there issued from the wood a  party of some twenty men, leading two dogs by chains. The creatures  struggled to get forward, and their eyes seemed almost starting out  of their heads with their eagerness to reach the object of their  pursuit. Their speed was, however, moderated by the fact that the  band, who were all on horseback, had to pick their way through the  great boulders. The wood itself was difficult for horsemen, but  here and there were spaces, and they had been able to ride at a  fair pace.    On entering the mouth of the gorge, however, they were obliged to  fall into an order of two abreast, and sometimes even to go in  Indian file. Huge boulders strewed the bottom of the chasm; where  indeed a stream, in winter, poured through. The sides were by no  means perpendicular, but were exceedingly precipitous.    When the Spaniards had fairly got into the gorge Ned gave the  signal, and a shower of great stones came leaping down the sides of  the rocks upon the astonished foes. Several were struck from their  horses; many of the horses, themselves, were knocked down; and a  scene of confusion at once took place. The Spaniards, however, were  accustomed to fighting; and the person in command, giving a few  orders, led ten of his men up the rocks upon the side where the  assailants were in strongest force; while the rest of the party,  seizing the horses' heads, drove the frightened animals back  through the ravine to the mouth.    The instant that the Spaniards commenced their ascent, long habits  of fear told upon some of the slaves, and these took to their heels  at once. Many others stood more firmly, but were evidently  wavering. Ned and Gerald, however, kept them at work hurling stones  down, and more than one of the Spaniards was carried off his feet  by these missiles.    Still they bravely ascended. Then Ned, taking a deliberate aim with  his pistol, brought down one of the leaders; and this greatly  surprised and checked the advance. The pistol shot was followed by  that of Gerald, and the Spaniards wavered at this unexpected  addition to the forces of the natives. Then Ned in English shouted:    \"Now, my brave Britons, show these Spaniards you can fight as well,  on land, as at sea.\"    The words were probably not understood by any of the Spaniards, but  they knew that the language was not Spanish or Indian; and the  thought that a number of English were there completely paralyzed  them. They hesitated, and then began slowly to fall back.    This was all that was needed to encourage the negroes. With a  shout, these now advanced to the attack, shooting their arrows and  hurling stones, and the retreat of the enemy was rapidly converted  into a flight.    Their blood once thoroughly up, the negroes were ready for  anything. Throwing aside their bows and arrows, they charged upon  the Spaniards; and in spite of the superior arms and gallant  defense of the latter, many of them were beaten down, and killed,  by the heavy clubs and pointed starves of the negroes.    More, indeed, would have perished; and indeed, all might have  fallen had not, at this moment, a formidable reinforcement of  strength reached them. The men from below, having got the horses  fairly out of the gorge, left but two of their number with them,  and advanced to the assistance of their friends, bringing with them  the two bloodhounds.    \"Never fear the hounds,\" Ned shouted. \"We can beat them to death,  as easily as if they were pigs. Keep a bold front and attack them,  and I warrant you they are no more formidable than their masters.\"    Had these reinforcements arrived earlier, they might have changed  the fight; but the Spaniards who survived were anxious only to be  off, and the negroes' blood was so thoroughly up that, under the  leadership of the boys, they were prepared to face even these  terrible dogs.    These threw themselves into the fray, with all the ferocity of  their savage nature. Springing at the throats of two of the  negroes, they brought them to the ground. One of the dogs was  instantly disposed of by Gerald; who, placing his pistol to its  ear, blew out its brains. Ned fell upon the other with his sword  and, the negroes joining him, speedily beat it down and slew it.    The diversion, however, had enabled the Spaniards to get upon their  horses; and they now galloped off, at full speed, among the trees.          Chapter 7: An Attack in Force.        The negroes were delighted at the success of the conflict; as were  the Indians, who soon joined them. But ten of the Spaniards had  escaped, the rest having fallen; either in the gorge, killed by the  rocks, or in the subsequent fight.    Ned and Gerald, who were now looked upon as the leaders of the  party, told the negroes to collect the arms of the fallen men, and  to give a hasty burial to their bodies. The boys knew, too well,  the savage nature of the war which raged, between the black and the  white, to ask whether any of the Spaniards were only wounded. They  knew that an instant death had awaited all who fell into the hands  of their late slaves.    \"Now,\" Ned said, \"my friends, you must not suppose that your  fighting is over. The Spaniards will take the news back to the  town, and it is likely enough that we shall have a large force upon  us, in the course of a few days. I do not suspect that they will  come before that time. Indeed, it may be far longer, for they know  that it will require a very large force to search these woods; and  that, now our blood is up, it will be no trifle to "]]]
