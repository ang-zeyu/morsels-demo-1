Ulysses-like the free States bound themselves, their right of  free speech, and their freedom of the press on this subject, for fear of  the Siren voices which came thrilling on every breeze from the South.  Quiet was the word, and quiet the leaders in Church and State sought to  enforce upon the people, to the end that the vision of \"States  dissevered, discordant, belligerent, of a land rent with civil feuds, or  drenched it may be, in fraternal blood,\" might not come to pass for  their \"glorious Union.\"    The increasing friction and heat between the sections during twenty-five  years, had effected every portion of the Federal system, and created  conditions favorable to a violent explosion. Sectional differences of a  political and industrial complexion, forty years had sufficed to  develop. Sectional differences of a moral and social character forty  years had also sufficed to generate. To kindle all those differences,  all that mass of combustible feelings and forces into a general  conflagration a spark only was wanted. And out of the glowing humanity  of one man the spark was suddenly struck.    It is curious to note that in the year 1829, the very year in which  William Lloyd Garrison landed in Baltimore, and began the editorship of  _The Genius of Universal Emancipation_, the American Convention, or  national assembly of the old State societies for the abolition of  slavery, fell into desuetude. It was as if Providence was clearing the  debris of an old dispensation out of the way of the new one which his  prophet was beginning to herald, as if guarding against all possibility  of having the new wine, then soon to be pressed from the moral vintage  of the nation, put into old bottles. The Hour for a new movement against  slavery had come, and with its arrival the Man to hail it had also come.    Other men had spoken and written against slavery, and labored for the  freedom of the slave before Garrison had thought upon the subject at  all. Washington and Jefferson, Franklin, Jay, and Hamilton had been  Abolitionists before he was born, but theirs was a divided interest. The  establishment of a more perfect union was the paramount object of their  lives. John Wesley had denounced slavery in language quite as harsh as  Garrison's, but his, too, was a divided interest, the religious revival  of the eighteenth century being his distinctive mission. Benezet,  Woolman, and Lundy were saints, who had yearned with unspeakable  sympathy for the black bondmen, and were indefatigable in good works in  his behalf, but they had not that stern and iron quality without which  reforms cannot be launched upon the attention of mankind. What his  predecessors lacked, Garrison possessed to a marvelous degree--the  undivided interest, the supremacy of a single purpose, the stern stuff  out of which the moral reformer is made, and in which he is panoplied.  They were all his, but there was another besides--immediatism. This  element distinguished the movement against slavery, started by him, from  all other movements begun before he arrived on the stage, for the  emancipation of the slaves in the Union.    This doctrine of immediate as opposed to gradual emancipation, was not  original with Garrison, nor was he the first to enunciate it. More than  a dozen years before he was converted to it, Rev. George Bourne, in \"The  Book and Slavery Irreconcilable,\" had shown that \"the system (of  slavery) is so entirely corrupt that it admits of no cure but by a  _total and immediate abolition_. For a gradual emancipation is a virtual  recognition of the right, and establishes the rectitude of the practice.  If it be just for one moment, it is hallowed forever; and if it be  inequitable, not a day should it be tolerated.\" In 1824, eight years  after the publication of Bourne's book, and five years before Garrison  announced the doctrine in the _Genius_, the Rev. James Duncan maintained  it, in his \"Treatise on Slavery,\" with no uncertainty of sense or  conviction. But neither Bourne nor Duncan had been able to effect an  incarnation of the doctrine, without which the good which it aimed at  could not be achieved. What they failed to effect, it is the glory of  Garrison that he achieved in his own person. He was \"_total and  immediate Abolition_\" personified. \"Truth is mighty and will prevail,\"  is a wise saying and worthy of acceptation. But this ultimate prevailing  of TRUTH depends mainly upon individual effort, applied not  intermittently, but steadily to a particular segment of the circle of  conduct. It is the long, strong, never-ending pull and tug upon the  wheels of conduct, which marks the great reformer. He finds his age or  country stuck in some Serbonian bog of iniquity. He prays, but he prays  with his shoulders braced strenuously against the body of society, and  he does not cease his endeavors until a revolution in conduct places his  age or country on firm ground beyond its Serbonian bog. The coming of  such a man is no accident. When the Hour is ready and the Man comes, a  new epoch in the life of a people arises from the conjunction. Of such  vast consequence verily was the coming into American history of William  Lloyd Garrison.            CHAPTER V.        THE DAY OF SMALL THINGS.      After leaving Baltimore, Garrison clung pathetically to the belief that,  if he told what he had seen of the barbarism of slavery to the North, he  would be certain to enlist the sympathy and aid of its leaders,  political and ecclesiastical, in the cause of emancipation. The sequel  to his efforts in this regard proved that he was never more mistaken in  his life. He addressed letters to men like Webster, Jeremiah Mason,  Lyman Beecher, and Dr. Channing, \"holding up to their view the  tremendous iniquity of the land, and begging them, ere it should be too  late, to interpose their great power in the Church and State, to save  our country from the terrible calamities which the sin of slavery was  bringing upon us.\" But there is no evidence that this appeal produced  the feeblest ripple in the lives of the two first; and upon the two last  it was equally barren of result. Dr. Channing, indeed, did not take the  trouble to hear any one of the three lectures of the young  philanthropist. Dr. Beecher, however, was at the pains to be present at  the first lecture given at Julien Hall. But he betrayed no real interest  in the subject. He had no time to devote to anti-slavery, had, in fine,  too many irons in the fire already. To this impotent apology of the  great preacher of immediatism in his dealing with all kinds of sin,  except the sin of slave-holding, for not espousing the cause of the  slave, Mr. Garrison made his famous retort:          \"Then you had better let all your irons burn than neglect your      duty to the slave.\"      What more did this poor and friendless man, with his one idea and his  harsh language, know of duties and dangers than Daniel Webster, who was  busy saving the Union; than Lyman Beecher, who was not less busy saving  souls; or than Dr. Channing, who was quite as busy saving liberalism in  matters of religion? What folly and presumption it must have seemed to  these mighty men this attempt of Garrison to impress upon them a proper  sense of their obligations to their country.    \"Your zeal,\" said Dr. Beecher to him, with unlimited condescension of  tone--\"your zeal is commendable, but you are misguided. If you will give  up your fanatical notions and be guided by us (the clergy) we will make  you the Wilberforce of America.\"    And so what was the young man, burning up with his one idea, to do in  presence of such a failure to win these men to the leadership of the  anti-slavery movement? He could not hold his peace; his message he was  compelled to deliver in the ears of the nation whether its leaders would  hear or forbear. Perhaps the common people would hearken to what the  wise and powerful had rejected. At any rate they should hear what was  resting upon his soul with the weight of a great woe, the force of a  supreme command. But how was he, penniless and friendless, to roll from  his bosom the burden which was crushing it; to pause long enough in the  battle for bread to fight the battle of the slave? Ah, if he had money!  but no money did he have, not a dollar in his pocket! Oh, if he had rich  friends who would dedicate their riches to the preaching of the gospel  of freedom! but alas! rich friends there were none. Oh, if he could cry  to the Church for help in this hour of his need! but it was slowly  dawning on him that not from the Church would help come to his cause;  for a grievous thing had happened to the Church. The slave gorgon sat  staring from the pews, and turning the pulpits to stone, turning also to  stone the hearts of the people.    Undismayed by the difficulties which were closing in around him,  Garrison resolutely set himself to accomplish his purpose touching the  establishment of a weekly paper devoted to the abolition of slavery. He  had promised in his _Prospectus_ to issue the first number of the  _Public Liberator_ \"as soon as subscriptions thereto may authorize the  attempt.\" But had he waited for the fulfillment of this condition, the  experiment could never have been tried. When subscribers did not come  in, the paper, he determined should go forth all the same. But there are  some things in the publication of a paper which no man can dispense  with, which indispensable somethings are: types, a press, an office, and  an assistant. All these requisites were wanting to the man whose sole  possession seemed an indomitable will, a faith in himself, and in the  righteousness of his cause, which nothing could shake, nor  disappointment nor difficulty, however great, was able to daunt or  deter. To such an unconquerable will, to such an invincible faith  obstacles vanish; the impossible becomes the attainable. As Garrison  burned to be about his work,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14558"],[0,"Darwinism (1889) (#17)"],[1,"or berries as  are found in the region. Till quite recently this comprised its whole  diet, but since the country it inhabits has become occupied by Europeans  it has developed a taste for a carnivorous diet, with alarming results.  It began by picking the sheepskins hung out to dry or the meat in  process of being cured. About 1868 it was first observed to attack  living sheep, which had frequently been found with raw and bleeding  wounds on their backs. Since then it is stated that the bird actually  burrows into the living sheep, eating its way down to the kidneys, which  form its special delicacy. As a natural consequence, the bird is being  destroyed as rapidly as possible, and one of the rare and curious  members of the New Zealand fauna will no doubt shortly cease to exist.  The case affords a remarkable instance of how the climbing feet and  powerful hooked beak developed for one set of purposes can be applied to  another altogether different purpose, and it also shows how little real  stability there may be in what appear to us the most fixed habits of  life. A somewhat similar change of diet has been recorded by the Duke of  Argyll, in which a goose, reared by a golden eagle, was taught by its  foster-parent to eat flesh, which it continued to do regularly and  apparently with great relish.[26]    Change of habits appears to be often a result of imitation, of which Mr.  Tegetmeier gives some good examples. He states that if pigeons are  reared exclusively with small grain, as wheat or barley, they will  starve before eating beans. But when they are thus starving, if a  bean-eating pigeon is put among them, they follow its example, and  thereafter adopt the habit. So fowls sometimes refuse to eat maize, but  on seeing others eat it, they do the same and become excessively fond of  it. Many persons have found that their yellow crocuses were eaten by  sparrows, while the blue, purple, and white coloured varieties were left  untouched; but Mr. Tegetmeier, who grows only these latter colours,  found that after two years the sparrows began to attack them, and  thereafter destroyed them quite as readily as the yellow ones; and he  believes it was merely because some bolder sparrow than the rest set the  example. On this subject Mr. Charles C. Abbott well remarks: \"In  studying the habits of our American birds--and I suppose it is true of  birds everywhere--it must at all times be remembered that there is less  stability in the habits of birds than is usually supposed; and no  account of the habits of any one species will exactly detail the various  features of its habits as they really are, in every portion of the  territory it inhabits.\"[27]    Mr. Charles Dixon has recorded a remarkable change in the mode of  nest-building of some common chaffinches which were taken to New Zealand  and turned out there. He says: \"The cup of the nest is small, loosely  put together, apparently lined with feathers, and the walls of the  structure are prolonged for about 18 inches, and hang loosely down the  side of the supporting branch. The whole structure bears some  resemblance to the nests of the hangnests (Icteridae), with the  exception that the cavity is at the top. Clearly these New Zealand  chaffinches were at a loss for a design when fabricating their nest.  They had no standard to work by, no nests of their own kind to copy, no  older birds to give them any instruction, and the result is the abnormal  structure I have just described.\"[28]    These few examples are sufficient to show that both the habits and  instincts of animals are subject to variation; and had we a sufficient  number of detailed observations we should probably find that these  variations were as numerous, as diverse in character, as large in  amount, and as independent of each other as those which we have seen to  characterise their bodily structure.      _The Variability of Plants._    The variability of plants is notorious, being proved not only by the  endless variations which occur whenever a species is largely grown by  horticulturists, but also by the great difficulty that is felt by  botanists in determining the limits of species in many large genera. As  examples we may take the roses, the brambles, and the willows as well  illustrating this fact. In Mr. Baker's _Revision of the British Roses_  (published by the Linnean Society in 1863), he includes under the single  species, Rosa canina--the common dog-rose--no less than twenty-eight  named _varieties_ distinguished by more or less constant characters and  often confined to special localities, and to these are referred about  seventy of the _species_ of British and continental botanists. Of the  genus Rubus or bramble, _five_ British species are given in Bentham's  _Handbook of the British Flora_, while in the fifth edition of  Babington's _Manual of British Botany_, published about the same time,  no less than _forty-five_ species are described. Of willows (Salix) the  same two works enumerate _fifteen_ and _thirty-one_ species  respectively. The hawkweeds (Hieracium) are equally puzzling, for while  Mr. Bentham admits only seven British species, Professor Babington  describes no less than thirty-two, besides several named varieties.    A French botanist, Mons. A. Jordan, has collected numerous forms of a  common little plant, the spring whitlow-grass (Draba verna); he has  cultivated these for several successive years, and declares that they  preserve their peculiarities unchanged; he also says that they each come  true from seed, and thus possess all the characteristics of true  species. He has described no less than fifty-two such species or  permanent varieties, all found in the south of France; and he urges  botanists to follow his example in collecting, describing, and  cultivating all such varieties as may occur in their respective  districts. Now, as the plant is very common almost all over Europe and  ranges from North America to the Himalayas, the number of similar forms  over this wide area would probably have to be reckoned by hundreds if  not by thousands.    The class of facts now adduced must certainly be held to prove that in  many large genera and in some single species there is a very large  amount of variation, which renders it quite impossible for experts to  agree upon the limits of species. We will now adduce a few striking  cases of individual variation.    The distinguished botanist, Alp. de Candolle, made a special study of  the oaks of the whole world, and has stated some remarkable facts as to  their variability. He declares that on the same branch of oak he has  noted the following variations: (1) In the length of the petiole, as one  to three; (2) in the form of the leaf, being either elliptical or  obovoid; (3) in the margin being entire, or notched, or even pinnatifid;  (4) in the extremity being acute or blunt; (5) in the base being sharp,  blunt, or cordate; (6) in the surface being pubescent or smooth; (7) the  perianth varies in depth and lobing; (8) the stamens vary in number,  independently; (9) the anthers are mucronate or blunt; (10) the fruit  stalks vary greatly in length, often as one to three; (11) the number of  fruits varies; (12) the form of the base of the cup varies; (13) the  scales of the cup vary in form; (14) the proportions of the acorns vary;  (15) the times of the acorns ripening and falling vary.    Besides this, many species exhibit well-marked varieties which have been  described and named, and these are most numerous in the best-known  species. Our British oak (Quercus robur) has twenty-eight varieties;  Quercus Lusitanica has eleven; Quercus calliprinos has ten; and Quercus  coccifera eight.    A most remarkable case of variation in the parts of a common flower has  been given by Dr. Hermann Mueller. He examined two hundred flowers of  Myosurus minimus, among which he found _thirty-five_ different  proportions of the sepals, petals, and anthers, the first varying from  four to seven, the second from two to five, and the third from two to  ten. Five sepals occurred in one hundred and eighty-nine out of the two  hundred, but of these one hundred and five had three petals, forty-six  had four petals, and twenty-six had five petals; but in each of these  sets the anthers varied in number from three to eight, or from two to  nine. We have here an example of the same amount of \"independent  variability\" that, as we have seen, occurs in the various dimensions of  birds and mammals; and it may be taken as an illustration of the kind  and degree of variability that may be expected to occur among small and  little specialised flowers.[29]    In the common wind-flower (Anemone nemorosa) an almost equal amount of  variation occurs; and I have myself gathered in one locality flowers  varying from 7/8 inch to 1-3/4 inch in diameter; the bracts varying from  1-1/2 inch to 4 inches across; and the petaloid sepals either broad or  narrow, and varying in number from five to ten. Though generally pure  white on their upper surface, some specimens are a full pink, while  others have a decided bluish tinge.    Mr. Darwin states that he carefully examined a large number of plants of  Geranium phaeum and G. pyrenaicum (not perhaps truly British but  frequently found wild), which had escaped from cultivation, and had  spread by seed in an open plantation; and he declares that \"the  seedlings varied in almost every single character, both in their flowers  and foliage, to a degree which I have never seen exceeded; yet they  could not have been exposed to any great change of their  conditions.\"[30]    The following examples of variation in important parts of plants were  collected by Mr. Darwin and have been copied from his unpublished  MSS.:--    \"De Candolle (_Mem. Soc. Phys. de Geneve_, tom. ii. part ii. p. 217)  states that Papaver bracteatum and P. orientale present indifferently  two sepals and four petals, or three sepals and six petals,"]]]
