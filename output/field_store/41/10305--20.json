All of us see it. That  stuck up about it, he was. Not as I should have thought much of it if  a party had give it to me, I do say.\"    \"Then what was it?\"    \"Why--it were a little figure like--gold _he_ said it were, but brass  I reckon. Ugly it were, but he says he's goin' to wear it on his  watch-chain. Good night, sir.\"    He turned and departed, but:    \"What kind of figure?\" I called after him.    Out of the darkness his voice came back:    \"A sort of a _cat_, sir.\"    And I heard his outlandish laughter dying away in the distance.          CHAPTER XII    I DREAM OF GREEN EYES      It was long enough before sleep visited me that night. For nearly half  an hour I stood at my open window looking across a moon-bathed slope  to where a tower projected, ghostly, above the fringe of the woods.  The landlord had informed me that it was Friar's Park which could thus  be seen peeping out from the trees, and as I stood watching that  sentinel tower a thousand strange ideas visited me.    The curious air of loneliness of which I had become conscious at the  moment of my arrival, was emphasized now that the residents in the  district had retired to their scattered habitations. No sound of bird  or beast disturbed the silence. From the time that the footsteps of  Martin the landlord had passed my door as he mounted heavily to his  bed-chamber, no sound had reached me but the muffled ticking of a  grandfather's clock upon the landing outside my room. And even this  sound, the only one intruding upon the stillness, I weaved into my  imaginings, so that presently it began to resemble the ticking of the  clock on the mantelpiece in that gruesome room at the Red House.    The view which I commanded was an extensive one and although in the  clear country air I could quite easily discern the upstanding wing of  Friar's Park, actually the house and the park were some two miles  distant. Where the park ended and the woods began it was impossible to  determine, yet such was my curious mood that I lingered there  endeavoring to puzzle out those details which were veiled from me by  distance.    To-morrow, I thought, I should be seeking admittance to that house  among the trees. In fact so great was my anxiety to plumb the depths  of the mystery in the hope of recovering some new fact which should  exculpate Coverly, that nothing but the unseemly lateness of the hour  had deterred me from presenting myself that very evening.    Yet, my night of idleness had not been altogether unfruitful. I had  met the scarred man, and from Hawkins I had heard something of his  singular story. Now as I stood there drinking in, as it were, the  loneliness of the prospect, my thoughts turned for the hundredth time  to the game-keeper's account of what had befallen the two rustic  rake-hells. I admit that the concluding part of Hawkins' story, quite  evidently regarded by him as a detail of no importance, had  re-awakened hope which had been at lowest ebb in the hour of my  arrival.    Although it was possible that the gift of a \"sort of cat\" to young  Edward Hines might prove on investigation to be not a clew but a  will-o'-the-wisp, I preferred to think that fate or the acute  reasoning of Inspector Gatton had sent me down to this quiet country  for a good purpose; and I built great hopes around the figure of the  \"lady down from London.\" Indeed it appeared to me that there were more  lines of investigation demanding attention than alone I could hope to  deal with in the short time at my disposal. Except that I was  determined to visit Friar's Park early on the following day, I  scarcely knew in which direction next to prosecute my inquiries.    Determining that I should be well-advised to sleep on the problem, I  presently turned in. And when I blew out the candle with which the  chambermaid had provided me, I remember thinking that the moonlight  was so bright that it would have been possible to read moderately  large type without inconvenience.    I slept perhaps for two hours or more, an unrefreshing sleep disturbed  by dreams of a wildly grotesque nature. Figures increasingly horrible  and menacing crowded upon me; but that which proved the culminating  horror and which finally awakened me, bathed in cold perspiration, was  a dream of two huge green eyes regarding me with a fixed stare,  fascinating and hypnotic, against which evil power I fought in my  dream with all the strength of my will.    Vaguely defined as if in smoke I could perceive the body of the  creature to which these incredible eyes belonged. It was slender and  sinuous and sometimes I thought it to be that of a human being and  sometimes that of an animal. For at one moment it possessed all the  lines of a woman's form and in the next, with those terrible eyes  regarding me from low down upon the ground, it had assumed the shape  of a crouching beast of prey. This fearsome apparition seemed to be  creeping towards me--nearer and nearer, and was about to spring, I  thought, when I awakened as I have said and sat suddenly upright.    One thing I immediately perceived which may have accounted for my bad  dreams; I had been sleeping with the moonlight shining directly upon  my face. Another thing I thought I perceived, but endeavored to assure  myself that it represented the aftermath of an unpleasant nightmare.  This was a lithe shape streaking through my open window--a figment of  the imagination, as I concluded at the time, the tail-end of a dream  visibly retreating in the moment of awakening.    So self-assured of this did I become, that I did not get up to  investigate the matter, nor was there any sound from the road below to  suggest that the figure had been otherwise than imaginary, yet I found  it difficult to woo slumber again, and for nearly an hour I lay  tossing from side to side, listening to the ticking of the  grandfather's clock and constantly seeing in my mind's eye that  deserted supper-room at the Red House.    And presently as I lay thus, I became aware of two things: first of  the howling of dogs, and, second, of a sort of muttered conversation  which seemed to be taking place somewhere near me. Listening intently,  I thought I could distinguish the voice of a man and that of a woman.  Possibly I was not the only wakeful inhabitant of the Abbey Inn was my  first and most natural idea; but it presently became apparent to me  that the speakers were not in the inn, but outside in the road.    Curiosity at last overcame inclination. Of the exact time I was not  aware, but I think dawn could not have been far off, and I naturally  wondered who these might be that conversed beneath my window at such  an hour. I rose quietly and crept across the room, endeavoring to  avoid showing my head in the moonlight. By the exercise of a little  ingenuity I obtained a view of the road before the inn doors.    At first I was unable to make out from whence this muttered  conversation arose, until fixing my attention upon a patch of shadow  underlying a tall tree which stood almost immediately opposite the  window, I presently made out two figures there. Somewhere, a dog was  howling mournfully.    For a long time I failed to distinguish any more than indefinite  outlines, nor, throughout the murmured colloquy, did I once detect  even so much as a phrase. The night remained perfect and the moon  possessed a tropical brilliance, casting deep and sharply defined  shadows, and lending to the whole visible landscape a quality of  hardness which for some obscure reason set me thinking of a painting  by Wiertz.    The low-pitched voices continued in what I thought was a dispute.  Something in the voice of the woman, although I could only hear her  occasionally, piqued yet eluded my memory. But it was the voice of a  young woman, whilst that of the man suggested a foreigner of some sort  and one past youth. Subconsciously pursuing the Wiertz idea, I know  not why, I invested the dimly-visible speakers with distinct  personalities. The man became Asmodeus, master of the revels at the  Black Sabbath, and the young woman I cast for that \"young witch\"  depicted in one of the canvasses of the weird Belgian genius.    Everything in the black and silver scene seemed to fit the picture.  Here was the unholy tryst, and I pictured the distant woods \"peopled  with gray things, the branches burdened with winged creatures arisen  from the pit; the darkness a curtain 'broidered with luminous eyes....\"    And it was my recollection of that phrase, from a work on sorcery,  which now set every nerve tingling. Closely I peered into the masking  shadow, telling myself that I was the victim of a subjective  hallucination. If this was indeed the case or if what I saw was  actual, I must leave each who reads to determine for himself; and the  episodes which follow and which I must presently relate will doubtless  aid the decision.    But it seemed to me that for one fleeting moment \"luminous eyes\"  indeed \"'broidered the darkness!'\" From out of the shade below the big  tree they regarded me greenly--and I saw them no more.    A while longer I watched, but could not detect any evidence of  movement in the shadow patch. The voices, too, had ceased; so that  presently it occurred to me that the speakers must have withdrawn  along a narrow lane which I had observed during the evening and which  communicated with a footpath across the meadows.    I realized that my heart was beating with extraordinary rapidity. So  powerful and so unpleasant was the impression made upon my mind by  this possibly trivial incident and by the extraordinary dream which  had preceded it, that on returning to bed (and despite the warmth of  the night) I closed both lattices and drew the curtains.    Whether as a result of thus excluding the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15344"],[0,"Grace Harlowe's Sophomore Year at High School (#17)"],[1,"walking on the  ground after her long morning on skates.    \"What if I am off on a wild-goose chase?\" she said to herself. \"Suppose  there is no one there?\" She paused for an instant and then ran on faster  than before.    \"I shall find help over there, I know I shall,\" she thought as she  hurried over the frozen ground and made straight for the ice house. There  was no time to be lost. Tom and Julia were liable to be sucked under and  drowned while she was looking for help.    Grace pushed resolutely on. In the meantime hardly four minutes had really  elapsed since the skaters had tumbled into the water.    On the other side of the ice house she came abruptly upon a man engaged in  loading a child's wagon with chips of wood.    \"Help!\" cried Grace. \"Help! Some people have broken through the ice. Have  you a rope?\"    The man made no answer whatever. He did not even look up until Grace shook  him by the shoulder.    \"There is no time to lose,\" she cried. \"They may drown at any moment.  Come! Come quickly, and help me save them.\"    The man looked at her with a strange, far-away expression in his eyes.    \"Don't you hear me?\" cried Grace in an agony of impatience. \"Are you  deaf?\"    He shook his head stupidly, touching his ears and mouth.    \"Deaf and dumb!\" she exclaimed in despair.    Holding up two fingers, Grace pointed toward the water. Then she made a  swimming motion. Perhaps he had understood. She could not tell, but her  quick eye had caught sight of a long, thin plank on the shore.    Pulling off one of her mittens, she showed him a little pearl and  turquoise ring her mother had given her for a birthday present, indicating  that she would give it to him if he would help her. Then she seized one  end of the plank and made a sign for him to take the other; but the  stubborn creature began to unload the chips from the wagon.    Grace ran blindly ahead, dragging the plank alone.    \"He's feeble-minded,\" she quivered. \"I suppose I shall have to work this  thing by myself.\"    When she had reached the bank, Grace heard him trotting behind her with  his little wagon. In another moment there was a tug at the board. She  turned and shook her fist angrily at him; but, without regarding her in  the least, he lifted the plank and rested it on the wagon. Then motioning  her to hold up the back end, he started on a run down the bank.    \"The poor soul thinks he's a horse, I suppose,\" she said to herself, \"but  what difference does it make, if we can only get the plank to Tom and  Julia?\"    Grace soon saw, however, that the idea was not entirely idiotic. Later she  was to offer up a prayer of thanks for that same child's wagon. The deaf  and dumb man was wearing heavy Arctic rubbers, which kept him from  slipping; while Grace, whose soles were as smooth as glass, kept her  balance admirably by means of the other end of the plank.    Tom and Julia Crosby had now been nearly ten minutes in the water. Twice  the ice had broken under Tom's grasp, while Julia, who seemed unable to  help herself, had thrown all her weight on the poor boy, while she called  wildly for help and heaped Grace with reproaches for running away.    \"If it were not for the fact that it would be the act of a coward,\"  exclaimed Tom at last, his teeth chattering with cold, \"I would let go of  your arm and give up the job of supporting you in this ice water for  talking about Grace like that. Of course she has gone for help. Haven't  you found out long ago that she is the right sort?\"    \"Well, why did she go in the wrong direction?\" sobbed Julia. \"Everybody is  over on the other bank. There is nothing but an ice house over here.\"    \"You may trust to her to have had some good, sensible reason,\" retorted  Tom loyally.    \"I don't think I can keep up much longer,\" exclaimed Julia, beginning to  cry again.    \"Keep on crying,\" replied Tom exasperated. \"It will warm you--and remember  that I am doing the keeping up. I don't see that you are making any  special effort in that direction.\"    Once Tom had endeavored to lift Julia out of the hole, and he believed,  and always insisted, in telling the story afterwards, that if she had been  willing to help herself it could have been accomplished. But Julia Crosby,  triumphant leader of her class, and Julia Crosby cold and wet as a result  of her own recklessness, were two different beings altogether.    \"Grace Harlowe has left us to drown,\" she sobbed. \"I am so wretched. She  is a selfish girl.\"    \"No such thing,\" replied Tom vigorously. \"Here she comes now, bringing  help as I expected I should think you'd be ashamed of yourself.\" He gave a  sigh of relief when he saw Grace and the strange man approaching at a  quick trot, the wagon and plank between them. His confidence in Grace had  not been misplaced. He felt that they would soon be released from their  perilous predicament.    [Illustration: Grace and the Strange Man Quickly Approached.]    \"All right,\" called Grace cheerfully as she approached. \"Keep up a little  while longer. We'll have you both out in a jiffy.\"    Both rescuers slid the plank on the ice until one end projected over the  hole.    Then the man and Grace both lay flat down on the other end and Grace  called \"ready.\"    Julia Crosby seized the board and pulled herself out of the water, safe,  now, from the breaking of thin ice at the edge.    \"Now, Tom,\" cried Grace.    But Julia's considerable weight had already weakened the wood. When Tom  attempted to draw himself up, crack! went the board, and a jagged piece  broke off. This would not have been so serious if the ice had not given  way. Then, into the water, with many strange, guttural cries, slipped the  deaf and dumb man. Grace herself was wet through by the rush of water over  the ice, and just saved herself by slipping backward.    There was still a small portion of the plank left, and, with Julia  Crosby's help, Grace thought they might manage to pull the two men out.    But Julia looked hardly able to help herself. She sat shivering on the  bank trying to remove her skates.    \"Julia,\" called Grace desperately. \"You must help me now or these two men  will drown. Help me hold down this plank.\"    Aroused by Grace's appeal, Julia meekly obeyed, and, still shivering  violently, knelt beside Grace on the plank. But it was too short; when  Tom Gray seized one end of it he nearly upset both the girls into the  water.    \"Oh, what shall we do?\" cried Grace in despair when suddenly there came  the thought of the little wagon.    Quickly untwisting a long muffler of red silk from about her neck, Grace  tied it securely in the middle, around the cross piece of the tongue of  the stout little vehicle. Then she pushed it gently until it stood on the  edge of the hole. Giving one end of the muffler to Julia, Grace took the  other herself.    \"Catch hold of the tail piece, Tom,\" she cried.    Fortunately the ice was very rough where the girls were standing, or they  would certainly have slipped and fallen. They pulled and tugged until  gradually the ice in front of them, with Tom's additional weight on it,  instead of breaking began to sink. But Tom Gray was out of the hole now;  helped by the wagon he slipped easily along the half-submerged ice, then  finally rolled over with a cry of relief upon the firm surface.    In the same way they pulled out the deaf and dumb man, who had certainly  been brave and patient during the ordeal, although he had uttered the most  fearful sounds.    As soon as his feet touched the solid ice, he seized his wagon and made  for the bank. Grace, remembering she had promised him her ring, hurried  after him, but she was chilled to the bone and could not run. By the time  she reached the bank he had rounded the corner of the ice house and was  out of sight.    \"He evidently doesn't care to be thanked,\" said Tom Gray as Grace returned  to where he and Julia stood waiting.    \"We had better get home as soon as possible or we'll all be laid up with  colds.\"    The three half-frozen young people made their way home as best they could.  Their clothes had frozen stiff, making it impossible for them to hurry.  Julia Crosby said not a word during the walk, but when she left them at  the corner where she turned into her own street, she said huskily: \"Thank  you both for what you did for me to-day, I owe my life to you.\"    \"That was a whole lot for her to say,\" said Grace.    \"She ought to be grateful,\" growled Tom. \"She was the cause of all this  mess,\" pointing to his wet clothes.    \"I believe she will be,\" said Grace softly, \"After all, 'It's an ill wind  that blows no one good.'\"    Grace's mother was justly horrified when Grace, in her bedraggled  condition, walked into the living room. She insisted on putting her to  bed, wrapping her in blankets and giving her hot drinks. Grace fell into a  sound sleep from which she did not awaken until evening. Then she rose,  dressed and appeared at the supper table apparently none the worse for her  wetting.    Meanwhile Tom Gray had gone to his aunt's, given himself a brisk rubbing  down and changed his wet clothing for another suit he fortunately happened  to have with him. Thanks to his strong constitution and vigorous health,  he felt no bad effects.    He then went down to the kitchen, asked the cook for a cup of hot coffee,  and, after hastily swallowing it, rushed off to find David, Hippy and  Reddy and tell them the news. He was filled with admiration for Grace.    \"She is the finest, most resolute girl I ever knew!\" he exclaimed as he  finished his story.    \"Hurrah for Grace Harlowe!\" shouted Reddy.    \"Let's go down to-night and see if she's all right?\" suggested David.    Before seven o'clock the four boys were on their way to the Harlowe's.  They crept quietly up to the living-room window. Grace sat by the fire  reading. Very softly they began a popular song that was a favorite of  hers. Grace's quick ears caught the sound of the music. She was out of"]]]
