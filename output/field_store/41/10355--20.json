Levi Williams, a mobber  and Baptist preacher, four men sent bullets into his body.    Then the mob fled, and the whole town of Carthage with them, fearing the  vengeance of the people of Nauvoo. But vengeance is the Lord's.    Willard Richards was not hurt. That night he spent in attending to his  wounded brother, John Taylor, and watching over the dead bodies of the  Prophet and Patriarch.    Joseph's earthly work was done, and the Master had called him away from the  haunts of mobs and wicked men. He sealed his testimony with his blood. He  had spent his life in working for the salvation of his fellowman, and even  yet in a freer and grander sphere he is working for the cause of Christ and  the Church.    Topics.--1.

When the bodies of the martyred Prophet and Patriarch were brought from  Carthage, they were met by thousands of the Saints from Nauvoo who wept  aloud for the loss of their beloved leaders. The scene was a very sad one.  Elder Willard Richards spoke to the people and advised them to remain  peaceable as they had always been, and let the Lord avenge the murder of  their loved ones.    The bodies of Joseph and Hyrum were buried privately at Nauvoo so that  their enemies might not disturb them.    And now the Saints were a little confused about who should be their  leaders. Joseph, the President of the Church, and Hyrum, one of his  counselors, were dead, and Sidney Rigdon, the other counselors, had some  months before got tired of affairs at Nauvoo and had gone to Pittsburg,  Pennsylvania. He was an apostate at heart, though he had not yet been cut  off from the Church. Most of the Twelve Apostles were away on missions, and  word was sent for them to return as soon as possible.    Though at first there was some misunderstanding among the Saints, the Lord  did not intend his Church should go to pieces because its leader had been  taken away. The Church had been set up never to be thrown down or left to  other people. The Gospel had been given to the earth \"for the last time and  for the fullness of times.\" The Saints had a promise that the kingdom was  theirs \"and the enemy shall not overcome.\" It would be a poor church,  indeed, that would go to pieces every time its chief officer died. No; the  Lord, through Joseph, had organized the Church so well that this could not  be. There was a quorum in the Church that had been given all the power  necessary to carry on the work of the Church in case the First Presidency  was taken away. That quorum was the Twelve Apostles. Now that there was no  First Presidency, it was the duty of the Twelve to preside and regulate the  affairs of the Church until such time that there should be another  president appointed. Brigham Young was the president of the Twelve, so in  reality he was the leading man in the Church.    But now came Sidney Rigdon from Pittsburg. He wanted to be appointed the  leader of the Church, or as he called it, a \"guardian.\" He, with some  others, tried to have a meeting of the Saints before the Twelve could get  home. This meeting was appointed for the 8th of August, 1844. On the 6th of  August President Young and five of the Apostles arrived at Nauvoo.    The meeting was held at the grove, and Sidney Rigdon and some of the  Twelve spoke. When Brigham Young arose to address the meeting, it seemed to  the Saints that both in appearance and speech he was like the Prophet  Joseph. This certainly was a sign to them. At this meeting Sidney Rigdon  was rejected and the Twelve Apostles were upheld as the quorum to lead the  Church.    Sidney Rigdon did not like this. He got a few followers and tried to  organize another church. A number of others did the same, but all these  movements did not amount to much. The Saints kept on under the direction of  the Twelve, building the temple and other public edifices in Nauvoo.    The enemies of the Church were disappointed. They had thought that if they  could get Joseph out of the way that would be the end of \"Mormonism.\" Of  course they did not understand that \"Mormonism\" is the Lord's work and does  not depend for its success on one or two men. He can raise up any number of  men to carry on his work, and now Brigham Young and his brethren were the  men who could and would carry it on.    In May, 1845, some of the murderers of Joseph and Hyrum were tried, and by  a jury pronounced innocent. This gave the mobbers more courage, and they  gathered again. In the small settlements outside of Nauvoo many houses were  burned and the inmates driven into the fields. These Saints were advised to  move into Nauvoo for protection.    Some time before his death, Joseph had predicted that the Saints would yet  move to the Rocky Mountains; and he had even begun the movement by holding  councils and asking for volunteers from the brethren to go ahead and locate  a place to which the Church might gather. President Young and the Twelve  now began preparing to carry this plan out. They could plainly see that it  was useless to try to live in peace in Illinois. The mobs grew larger and  fiercer. The people living in the counties surrounding Hancock county,  threatened to drive the \"Mormons\" from the state; and the officers whose  duty it was to enforce the laws would not do so if it was to protect the  \"Mormons.\"    So in August, 1845, it was decided to select three thousand men who, with  their families, were to go to Upper California. All this western country  was then called Upper California. The authorities of the Church promised  the mob leaders that if they would not molest them they would all leave the  state early the next spring.    But the mobbing did not cease at this; so the sheriff of the county, a Mr.  Backenstos, organized a posse, that is, a company of men to help him  enforce the laws and keep order. The sheriff kept after the mob to prevent  them from burning houses, etc., and this made the mobbers very angry. One  day some of them tried to kill the sheriff, but he was saved by two  \"Mormons\" coming to his rescue. Thus during the summer and fall of 1845  there was much trouble between the mobs, the \"Mormons,\" and the militia.    All this time the Saints had worked hard to finish the temple. It had been  decided to do this even if they had to work with the \"trowel in one hand  and a sword in the other.\" October 5th the temple was near enough finished  that a conference was held in the building. No general conference had been  held for three years, as Joseph had said none should be convened until it  could be held in the temple.    After this the work on the building still went on, and in a short time it  was so far completed that it was dedicated, and a great many of the Saints  received their endowments within its sacred walls.    All that winter, (1845-46) Nauvoo was like a big workshop. Everybody that  could was preparing for the great move westward. Farms and houses were  offered for sale. Wagons were built, and as iron was scarce, many of them  had wooden tires. Horses and cattle were gathered. It was to be the sixth  move of the Saints from their homes, and it was no small undertaking now as  there were many thousands of people, and they were to go to a wild, unknown  land among the deserts and mountains of the West.    The move began on February 4, 1846, and from that date on there was a  continuous stream of wagons crossing the Mississippi river to the Iowa  side. A camp was made on Sugar creek, nine miles from Nauvoo, where the  Saints gathered. Towards the last of the month the weather became very  cold, the river froze over so that teams could be driven across on the ice.  It was a bad time of the year to begin such a move. Many of the Saints were  poorly clad, some had no tents or wagon covers, and in the snow and cold  there was much suffering; but on the Saints went, looking with sad hearts  on their deserted homes; but rather would they face the winter storms and  cold than to live in constant dread of cruel mobs.

The solid land which the cow-herd called his farm was only about two  acres in extent. All around it was a black morass, of great extent,  wooded with alders, among which green sedges grew, and sluggish  streams meandered, and mossy tracts of verdure spread treacherously  over deep bogs and sloughs. In the driest season of the summer the  goats and the sheep penetrated into these recesses, but, excepting in  the devious and tortuous path by which the cow-herd found his way to  his island, it was almost impassable for man.    Alfred, however, attracted now by the impediments and obstacles which  would have repelled a wanderer under any other circumstances, went  on with the greater alacrity the more intricate and entangled the  thickets of the morass were found, since these difficulties promised  to impede or deter pursuit. He found his way in to the cow-herd's  hut. He asked for shelter. People who live in solitudes are always  hospitable. The cow-herd took the wayworn fugitive in, and gave him  food and shelter. Alfred remained his guest for a considerable time.    The story is, that after a few days the cow-herd asked him who he was,  and how he came to be wandering about in that distressed and destitute  condition. Alfred told him that he was one of the king's _thanes_. A  thane was a sort of chieftain in the Saxon state. He accounted for his  condition by saying that Alfred's army had been beaten by the Danes,  and that he, with the other generals, had been forced to fly. He  begged the cow-herd to conceal him, and to keep the secret of his  character until times should change, so that he could take the field  again.    The story of Alfred's seclusion on the _island_, as it might almost  be called, of Ethelney, is told very differently by the different  narrators of it. Some of these narrations are inconsistent and  contradictory. They all combine, however, though they differ in  respect to many other incidents and details, in relating the far-famed  story of Alfred's leaving the cakes to burn. It seems that, though  the cow-herd himself was allowed to regard Alfred as a man of rank in  disguise--though even _he_ did not know that it was the king--his wife  was not admitted, even in this partial way, into the secret. She was  made to consider the stranger as some common strolling countryman,  and the better to sustain this idea, he was taken into the cow-herd's  service, and employed in various ways, from time to time, in labors  about the house and farm. Alfred's thoughts, however, were little  interested in these occupations. His mind dwelt incessantly upon his  misfortunes and the calamities which had befallen his kingdom. He was  harassed by continual suspense and anxiety, not being able to gain any  clear or certain intelligence about the condition and movements of  either his friends or foes. He was revolving continually vague and  half-formed plans for resuming the command of his army and attempting  to regain his kingdom, and wearying himself with fruitless attempts to  devise means to accomplish these ends. Whenever he engaged voluntarily  in any occupation, it would always be something in harmony with these  trains of thought and these plans. He would repair and put in order  implements of hunting, or any thing else which might be deemed to have  some relation to war. He would make bows and arrows in the chimney  corner--lost, all the time, in melancholy reveries, or in wild and  visionary schemes of future exploits.    One evening, while he was thus at work, the cow-herd's wife left, for  a few moments, some cakes under his charge, which she was baking  upon the great stone hearth, in preparation for their common supper.  Alfred, as might have been expected, let the cakes burn. The woman,  when she came back and found them smoking, was very angry. She told  him that he could eat the cakes fast enough when they were baked,  though it seemed he was too lazy and good for nothing to do the least  thing in helping to bake them. What wide-spread and lasting effects  result sometimes from the most trifling and inadequate causes! The  singularity of such an adventure befalling a monarch in disguise, and  the terse antithesis of the reproaches with which the woman rebuked  him, invest this incident with an interest which carries it every  where spontaneously among mankind. Millions, within the last thousand  years, have heard the name of Alfred, who have known no more of him  than this story; and millions more, who never would have heard of him  but for this story, have been led by it to study the whole history of  his life; so that the unconscious cow-herd's wife, in scolding  the disguised monarch for forgetting her cakes, was perhaps doing  more than he ever did himself for the wide extension of his future  fame.[2]    [Illustration: ALFRED WATCHING THE CAKES.]    Alfred was, for a time, extremely depressed and disheartened by the  sense of his misfortunes and calamities; but the monkish writers who  described his character and his life say that the influence of his  sufferings was extremely salutary in softening his disposition and  improving his character. He had been proud, and haughty, and  domineering before. He became humble, docile, and considerate now.  Faults of character that are superficial, resulting from the force of  circumstances and peculiarities of temptation, rather than from innate  depravity of heart, are easily and readily burned off in the fire of  affliction, while the same severe ordeal seems only to indurate the  more hopelessly those propensities which lie deeply seated in an  inherent and radical perversity.      Alfred, though restless and wretched in his apparently hopeless  seclusion, bore his privations with a great degree of patience and  fortitude, planning, all the time, the best means of reorganizing his  scattered forces, and of rescuing his country from the ruin into which  it had fallen. Some of his former friends, roaming as he himself had  done, as fugitives about the country, happened at length to come into  the neighborhood of his retreat. He heard of them, and cautiously made  himself known. They were rejoiced to find their old commander once  more, and, as there was no force of the Danes in that neighborhood  at the time, they lingered, timidly and fearlessly at first, in the  vicinity, until, at length, growing more bold as they found themselves  unmolested in their retreat, they began to make it their gathering  place and head-quarters. Alfred threw off his disguise, and assumed  his true character. Tidings of his having been thus discovered  spread confidentially among the most tried and faithful of his Saxon  followers, who had themselves been seeking safety in other places of  refuge. They began, at first cautiously and by stealth, but afterward  more openly, to repair to the spot. Alfred's family, too, from which  he had now been for many months entirely separated, contrived to  rejoin him. The herdsman, who proved to be a man of intelligence and  character superior to his station, entered heartily into all these  movements. He kept the secret faithfully. He did all in his power  to provide for the wants and to promote the comfort of his warlike  guests, and, by his fidelity and devotion, laid Alfred under  obligations of gratitude to him, which the king, when he was afterward  restored to the throne, did not forget to repay.    Notwithstanding, however, all the efforts which the herdsman made to  obtain supplies, the company now assembled at Ethelney were sometimes  reduced to great straits. There were not only the wants of Alfred  and his immediate family and attendants to be provided for, but  many persons were continually coming and going, arriving often at  unexpected times, and acting, as roving and disorganized bodies of  soldiers are very apt to do at such times, in a very inconsiderate  manner. The herdsman's farm produced very little food, and the  inaccessibleness of its situation made it difficult to bring in  supplies from without. In fact, it was necessary, in one part of the  approach to it, to use a boat, so that the place is generally called,  in history, an island, though it was insulated mainly by swamps  and morasses rather than by navigable waters. There were, however,  sluggish streams all around it, where Alfred's men, when their stores  were exhausted, went to fish, under the herdsman's guidance, returning  sometimes with a moderate fare, and sometimes with none.    The monks who describe this portion of Alfred's life have recorded an  incident as having occurred on the occasion of one of these fishing  excursions, which, however, is certainly, in part, a fabrication, and  may be wholly so. It was in the winter. The waters about the grounds  were frozen up. The provisions in the house were nearly exhausted,  there being scarcely anything remaining. The men went away with  their fishing apparatus, and with their bows and arrows, in hopes of  procuring some fish or fowl to replenish their stores. Alfred was left  alone, with only a single lady of his family, who is called in the  account \"Mother,\" though it could not have been Alfred's own mother,  as she had been dead many years. Alfred was sitting in the hut  reading. A beggar, who had by some means or other found his way in  over the frozen morasses, came to the door, and asked for food.  Alfred, looking up from his book, asked the mother, whoever she  was, to go and see what there was to give him. She went to make  examination, and presently returned, saying that there was nothing to  give him. There was only a single loaf of bread remaining, and that  would not be half enough for their own wants that very night when the  hunting party should return, if they should come back unsuccessful  from their"]]]
