Dr. Petrie!\"    The words broke in through the curtain of unconsciousness. I strove  to arouse myself. I felt cold and wet. I opened my eyes--and the world  seemed to be swimming dizzily about me. Then a hand grasped my arm,  roughly.    \"Brace up! Brace up, Petrie--and thank God you are alive! ...\"    I was sitting beside Sir Baldwin Frazer on a wooden bench, under a  leafless tree, from the ghostly limbs whereof rain trickled down upon  me! In the gray light, which, I thought, must be the light of dawn,  I discerned other trees about us and an open expanse, tree-dotted,  stretching into the misty grayness.    \"Where are we?\" I muttered--\"where ...\"    \"Unless I am greatly mistaken,\" replied my bedraggled companion, \"and  I don't think I am, for I attended a consultation in this neighborhood  less than a week ago, we somewhere on the west side of Wandsworth  Common!\"    He ceased speaking; then uttered a suppressed cry. There came a  jangling of coins, and dimly I saw him to be staring at a canvas bag  of money which he held.    \"Merciful heavens!\" he said, \"am I mad--or did I _really_ perform that  operation? And can this be my fee? ...\"    I laughed loudly, wildly, plunging my wet, cold hands into the pockets  of my rain-soaked overcoat. In one of them, my fingers came in contact  with a piece of cardboard. It had an unfamiliar feel, and I pulled it  out, peering at it in the dim light.    \"Well, I'm damned!\" muttered Frazer--\"then I'm not mad, after all!\"    It was the Queen of Hearts!        CHAPTER XIX    \"ZAGAZIG\"      Fully two weeks elapsed ere Nayland Smith's arduous labors at last met  with a slight reward. For a moment, the curtain of mystery surrounding  the Si-Fan was lifted, and we had a glimpse of that organization's  elaborate mechanism. I cannot better commence my relation of the  episodes associated with the Zagazig's cryptogram than from the moment  when I found myself bending over a prostrate form extended upon the  table in the Inspector's room at the River Police Depot. It was that  of a man who looked like a Lascar, who wore an ill-fitting slop-shop  suit of blue, soaked and stained and clinging hideously to his body.  His dank black hair was streaked upon his low brow; and his face,  although it was notable for a sort of evil leer, had assumed in death  another and more dreadful expression.    Asphyxiation had accounted for his end beyond doubt, but there were  marks about his throat of clutching fingers, his tongue protruded,  and the look in the dead eyes was appalling.    \"He was amongst the piles upholding the old wharf at the back of the  Joy-Shop?\" said Smith tersely, turning to the police officer in charge.    \"Exactly\" was the reply. \"The in-coming tide had jammed him right up  under a cross-beam.\"    \"What time was that?'    \"Well, at high tide last night. Hewson, returning with the ten o'clock  boat, noticed the moonlight glittering upon the knife.\"    The knife to which the Inspector referred possessed a long curved  blade of a kind with which I had become terribly familiar in the past.  The dead man still clutched the hilt of the weapon in his right hand,  and it now lay with the blade resting crosswise upon his breast. I  stared in a fascinated way at this mysterious and tragic flotsam of  old Thames.    Glancing up, I found Nayland Smith's gray eyes watching me.    \"You see the mark, Petrie?\" he snapped.    I nodded. The dead man upon the table was a Burmese dacoit!    \"What do you make of it?\" I said slowly.    \"At the moment,\" replied Smith, \"I scarcely know what to make of it.  You are agreed with the divisional surgeon that the man--unquestionably  a dacoit--died, not from drowning, but from strangulation. From  evidence we have heard, it would appear that the encounter which  resulted in the body being hurled in the river, actually took place  upon the wharf-end beneath which he was found. And we know that a place  formerly used by the Si-Fan group--in other words, by Dr. Fu-Manchu--  adjoins the wharf. I am tempted to believe that this\"--he nodded  towards the ghastly and sinister object upon the table--\"was a servant  of the Chinese Doctor. In other words, we see before us one whom  Fu-Manchu has rebuked for some shortcoming.\"    I shuddered coldly. Familiar as I should have been with the methods of  the dread Chinaman, with his callous disregard of human suffering, of  human life, of human law, I could not reconcile my ideas--the ideas  of a modern, ordinary middle-class practitioner--with these Far Eastern  devilries which were taking place in London.    Even now I sometimes found myself doubting the reality of the whole  thing; found myself reviewing the history of the Eastern doctor and  of the horrible group of murderers surrounding him, with an incredulity  almost unbelievable in one who had been actually in contact not only  with the servants of the Chinaman, but with the sinister Fu-Manchu  himself. Then, to restore me to grips with reality, would come the  thought of Karamaneh, of the beautiful girl whose love had brought  me seemingly endless sorrow and whose love for me had brought her once  again into the power of that mysterious, implacable being.    This thought was enough. With its coming, fantasy vanished; and I knew  that the dead dacoit, his great curved knife yet clutched in his hand,  the Yellow menace hanging over London, over England, over the  civilized world, the absence, the heart-breaking absence, of  Karamaneh--all were real, all were true, all were part of my life.    Nayland Smith was standing staring vaguely before him and tugging at  the lobe of his left ear.    \"Come along!\" he snapped suddenly. \"We have no more to learn here:  the clue to the mystery must be sought elsewhere.\"    There was that in his manner whereby I knew that his thoughts were far  away, as we filed out from the River Police Depot to the cab which  awaited us. Pulling from his overcoat pocket a copy of a daily paper--    \"Have you seen this, Weymouth?\" he demanded.    With a long, nervous index finger he indicated a paragraph on the front  page which appeared under the heading of \"Personal.\" Weymouth bent  frowningly over the paper, holding it close to his eyes, for this was  a gloomy morning and the light in the cab was poor.    \"Such things don't enter into my sphere, Mr. Smith,\" he replied, \"but  no doubt the proper department at the Yard have seen it.\"    \"I _know_ they have seen it!\" snapped Smith; \"but they have also been  unable to read it!\"    Weymouth looked up in surprise.    \"Indeed,\" he said. \"You are interested in this, then?\"    \"Very! Have you any suggestion to offer respecting it?\"    Moving from my seat I, also, bent over the paper and read, in growing  astonishment, the following:--    ZAGAZIG-Z,-a-g-a;-z:-_I_-g,a,-a,ag-_a_,z;-          I;-g:z-a-g-A-z;i-:g;-Z,,-a;-gg-_-z-i;-          G;-z-,a-g-:a-Z__I_;-g:-z-a-g;-a-:Z-,i-g:          z,a-g,-a:z,i-g.    \"This is utterly incomprehensible! It can be nothing but some foolish  practical joke! It consists merely of the word 'Zagazig' repeated six  or seven times--which can have no possible significance!\"    \"Can't it!\" snapped Smith.    \"Well,\" I said, \"what has Zagazig to do with Fu-Manchu, or to do with  us?\"    \"Zagazig, my dear Petrie, is a very unsavory Arab town in Lower Egypt,  as you know!\"    He returned the paper to the pocket of his over-coat, and, noting my  bewildered glance, burst into one of his sudden laughs.    \"You think I am talking nonsense,\" he said; \"but, as a matter of fact,  that message in the paper has been puzzling me since it appeared--  yesterday morning--and at last I think I see the light.\"    He pulled out his pipe and began rapidly to load it.    \"I have been growing careless of late, Petrie,\" he continued; and no  hint of merriment remained in his voice. His gaunt face was drawn  grimly, and his eyes glittered like steel. \"In future I must avoid  going out alone at night as much as possible.\"    Inspector Weymouth was staring at Smith in a puzzled way; and certainly  I was every whit as mystified as he.    \"I am disposed to believe,\" said my friend, in his rapid, incisive way,  \"that the dacoit met his end at the hands of a tall man, possibly dark  and almost certainly clean-shaven. If this missing personage wears, on  chilly nights, a long tweed traveling coat and affects soft gray hats  of the Stetson pattern, I shall not be surprised.\"    Weymouth stared at me in frank bewilderment.    \"By the way, Inspector,\" added Smith, a sudden gleam of inspiration  entering his keen eyes--\"did I not see that the s.s._Andaman_ arrived  recently?\"    \"The Oriental Navigation Company's boat?\" inquired Weymouth in a  hopeless tone. \"Yes. She docked yesterday evening.\"    \"If Jack Forsyth is still chief officer, I shall look him up,\"  declared Smith. \"You recall his brother, Petrie?\"    \"Naturally; since he was done to death in my presence,\" I replied;  for the words awoke memories of one of Dr. Fu-Manchu's most ghastly  crimes, always associated in my mind with the cry of a night-hawk.    \"The divine afflatus should never be neglected,\" announced Nayland  Smith didactically, \"wild though its promptings may seem.\"        CHAPTER XX    THE NOTE ON THE DOOR      I saw little of Nayland Smith for the remainder of that day.  Presumably he was following those \"promptings\" to which he had  referred, though I was unable to conjecture whither they were leading  him. Then, towards dusk he arrived in a perfect whirl, figuratively  sweeping me off my feet.    \"Get your coat on, Petrie!\" he cried; \"you forget that we have a most  urgent appointment!\"    Beyond doubt I had forgotten that we had any appointment whatever that  evening, and some surprise must have shown upon my face, for--    \"Real"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/180"],[0,"The 1994 CIA World Factbook (#17)"],[1,":    58%  forest and woodland:    14%  other:    22%  Irrigated land:    18,800 sq km (1989 est.)

Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of    agricultural products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Primary    products account for more than 60% of the value of total exports, so    that, as in 1983-84, a downturn in world commodity prices can have a    big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for increased    exports of manufactured goods, but competition in international    markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered from the low    growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD countries in the    early 1990s. In 1992-93 the economy recovered slowly from the    prolonged recession of 1990-91, a major restraining factor being weak    world demand for Australia's exports. Unemployment has hovered around    10% and probably will remain at that level in 1994 as productivity    gains rather than more jobs account for growth.
