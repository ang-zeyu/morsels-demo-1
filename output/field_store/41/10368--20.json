The  provision of food and domicile for their numerous inmates is no small  charge on the nation, but observers are agreed that it is cheerfully  paid and that the monks are worthy of what they receive. In energy and  morality they seem, as a class, superior to their brethren in Ceylon  and Siam, and their services to education and learning have been  considerable. Every monastery is also a school, where instruction is  given to both day boys and boarders. The vast majority of Burmans  enter such a school at the age of eight or nine and learn there  reading, writing, and arithmetic. They also receive religious  instruction and moral training. They commit to memory various works in  Pali and Burmese, and are taught the duties which they owe to  themselves, society and the state. Sir. J.G. Scott, who is certainly  not disposed to exaggerate the influence of Buddhism in Burma, says  that \"the education of the monasteries far surpasses the instruction  of the Anglo-vernacular schools from every point of view except that  of immediate success in life and the obtaining of a post under  Government.\"[180] The more studious monks are not merely schoolmasters  but can point to a considerable body of literature which they have  produced in the past and are still producing.[181] Indeed among the  Hinayanist churches that of Burma has in recent centuries held the  first place for learning. The age and continuity of Sinhalese  traditions have given the Sangha of Ceylon a correspondingly great  prestige but it has more than once been recruited from Burma and  in literary output it can hardly rival the Burmese clergy.    Though many disquisitions on the Vinaya have been produced in Burma,  and though the Jatakas and portions of the Sutta Pitaka (especially  those called Parittam) are known to everybody, yet the favourite study  of theologians appears to be the Abhidhamma, concerning which a  multitude of hand-books and commentaries have been written, but it is  worth mentioning that the Abhidhammattha-sangaha, composed in Ceylon  about the twelfth century A.D., is still the standard manual.[182] Yet  it would be a mistake to think of the Burmese monks as absorbed in  these recondite studies: they have on the contrary produced a long  series of works dealing with the practical things of the world, such  as chronicles, law-books, ethical and political treatises, and even  poetry, for Silavamsa and Ratthapala whose verses are still learned by  the youth of Burma were both of them Bhikkhus. The Sangha has always  shown a laudable reserve in interfering directly with politics, but in  former times the king's private chaplain was a councillor of  importance and occasionally matters involving both political and  religious questions were submitted to a chapter of the order. In all  cases the influence of the monks in secular matters made for justice  and peace: they sometimes interceded on behalf of the condemned or  represented that taxation was too heavy. In 1886, when the British  annexed Burma, the Head of the Sangha forbade monks to take part in  the political strife, a prohibition which was all the more remarkable  because King Thibaw had issued proclamations saying that the object of  the invasion was to destroy Buddhism.    In essentials monastic life is much the same in Burma and Ceylon but  the Burmese standard is higher, and any monk known to misconduct  himself would be driven out by the laity. The monasteries are numerous  but not large and much space is wasted, for, though the exterior  suggests that they are built in several stories the interior usually  is a single hall, although it may be divided by partitions. To the  eastern side is attached a chapel containing images of Gotama before  which daily devotions are performed. It is surmounted by a steeple  culminating in a _hti_, a sort of baldachino or sacred umbrella  placed also on the top of dagobas, and made of open metal work hung  with little bells. Monasteries are always built outside towns and,  though many of them become subsequently enclosed by the growth of the  larger cities, they retain spacious grounds in which there may be  separate buildings, such as a library, dormitories for pupils and a  hall for performing the ordination service. The average number of  inmates is six. A large establishment may house a superior, four  monks, some novices and besides them several lay scholars. The grades  are _Sahin_ or novice, _Pyit-shin_ or fully ordained monk and  _Pongyi_, literally great glory, a monk of at least ten years'  standing. Rank depends on seniority--that is to say the greatest  respect is shown to the monk who has observed his vows for the longest  period, but there are some simple hierarchical arrangements. At the  head of each monastery is a Saya or superior, and all the monasteries  of a large town or a country district are under the supervision of a  Provincial called Gaing-Ok. At the head of the whole church is the  Thathanabaing, already mentioned. All these higher officials must be  Pongyis.    Although all monks must take part in the daily round to collect alms  yet in most monasteries it is the custom (as in Ceylon and Siam) not  to eat the food collected, or at least not all of it, and though no  solid nourishment is taken after midday, three morning meals are  allowed, namely, one taken very early, the next served on the return  from the begging round and a third about 11.30. Two or three services  are intoned before the image of the Buddha each day. At the morning  ceremony, which takes place about 5.30, all the inmates of the  monastery prostrate themselves before the superior and vow to observe  the precepts during the day. At the conclusion of the evening service  a novice announces that a day has passed away and in a loud voice  proclaims the hour, the day of the week, the day of the month and the  year. The laity do not usually attend these services, but near large  monasteries there are rest houses for the entertainment of visitors  and Uposatha days are often celebrated by a pious picnic. A family or  party of friends take a rest-house for a day, bring a goodly store of  cheroots and betel nut, which are not regarded as out of place during  divine service,[183] and listen at their ease to the exposition of  the law delivered by a yellow-robed monk. When the congregation  includes women he holds a large fan-leaf palm before his face lest his  eyes should behold vanity. A custom which might not be to the taste of  western ecclesiastics is that the congregation ask questions and, if  they do not understand, request the preacher to be clearer.    There is little sectarianism in Burma proper, but the Sawtis, an  anti-clerical sect, are found in some numbers in the Shan States and  similar communities called Man are still met with in Pegu and  Tenasserim, though said to be disappearing. Both refuse to recognize  the Sangha, monasteries or temples and perform their devotions in the  open fields. Otherwise their mode of thought is Buddhist, for they  hold that every man can work out his own salvation by conquering  Mara,[184] as the Buddha did, and they use the ordinary formulae of  worship, except that they omit all expressions of reverence to the  Sangha. The orthodox Sangha is divided into two schools known as  Mahagandi and Sulagandi. The former are the moderate easy-going  majority who maintain a decent discipline but undeniably deviate  somewhat from the letter of the Vinaya. The latter are a strict and  somewhat militant Puritan minority who protest against such  concessions to the flesh. They insist for instance that a monk should  eat out of his begging bowl exactly as it is at the end of the morning  round and they forbid the use of silk robes, sunshades and sandals.  The Sulagandi also believe in free will and attach more value to the  intention than the action in estimating the value of good deeds,  whereas the Mahagandi accept good actions without enquiring into the  motive and believe that all deeds are the result of karma.    5      In Burma all the higher branches of architecture are almost  exclusively dedicated to religion. Except the Palace at Mandalay there  is hardly a native building of note which is not connected with a  shrine or monastery. Burmese architectural forms show most analogy  to those of Nepal and perhaps[185] both preserve what was once the  common style for wooden buildings in ancient India. In recent  centuries the Burmese have shown little inclination to build anything  that can be called a temple, that is a chamber containing images and  the paraphernalia of worship. The commonest form of religious edifice  is the dagoba or zedi:[186] images are placed in niches or shrines,  which shelter them, but only rarely, as on the platform of the Shwe  Dagon at Rangoon, assume the proportions of rooms. This does not apply  to the great temples of Pagan, built from about 1050 to 1200, but that  style was not continued and except the Arakan Pagoda at Mandalay has  perhaps no modern representative. Details of these buildings may be  found in the works of Forchhammer, Fergusson, de Beylie and various  archaeological reports. Their construction is remarkably solid. They do  not, like most large buildings in India or Europe, contain halls of  some size but are rather pyramids traversed by passages. But this  curious disinclination to build temples of the usual kind is not due  to any dislike of images. In no Buddhist country are they more common  and their numbers are more noticeable because there is here no  pantheon as in China and Tibet, but images of Gotama are multiplied,  merely in order to obtain merit. Some slight variety in these figures  is produced by the fact that the Burmese venerate not only Gotama but  the three Buddhas who preceded him.[187] The Shwe Dagon Pagoda is  reputed to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1685"],[0,"The Mystery of the Yellow Room (#17)"],[1,"Chief impatiently.    \"Oh! we are quite convinced of that!\" cried the examining magistrate.    At that moment the door of the laboratory opened and the officer in  charge of the gendarmes entered and handed a card to the examining  magistrate. Monsieur de Marquet read it and uttered a half angry  exclamation:    \"This is really too much!\" he cried.    \"What is it?\" asked the Chief.    \"It's the card of a young reporter engaged on the 'Epoque,' a Monsieur  Joseph Rouletabille. It has these words written on it: 'One of the  motives of the crime was robbery.'\"    The Chief smiled.    \"Ah,--young Rouletabille--I've heard of him he is considered rather  clever. Let him come in.\"    Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille was allowed to enter. I had made his  acquaintance in the train that morning on the way to Epinay-sur-Orge.  He had introduced himself almost against my wish into our compartment. I  had better say at once that his manners, and the arrogance with which  he assumed to know what was incomprehensible even to us, impressed him  unfavourably on my mind. I do not like journalists. They are a class  of writers to be avoided as the pest. They think that everything is  permissible and they respect nothing. Grant them the least favour, allow  them even to approach you, and you never can tell what annoyance they  may give you. This one appears to be scarcely twenty years old, and the  effrontery with which he dared to question us and discuss the matter  with us made him particularly obnoxious to me. Besides, he had a way of  expressing himself that left us guessing as to whether he was mocking us  or not. I know quite well that the 'Epoque' is an influential paper with  which it is well to be on good terms, but the paper ought not to allow  itself to be represented by sneaking reporters.    Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille entered the laboratory, bowed to us, and  waited for Monsieur de Marquet to ask him to explain his presence.    \"You pretend, Monsieur, that you know the motive for the crime, and  that that motive--in the face of all the evidence that has been  forthcoming--was robbery?\"    \"No, Monsieur, I do not pretend that. I do not say that robbery was the  motive for the crime, and I don't believe it was.\"    \"Then, what is the meaning of this card?\"    \"It means that robbery was one of the motives for the crime.\"    \"What leads you to think that?\"    \"If you will be good enough to accompany me, I will show you.\"    The young man asked us to follow him into the vestibule, and we did.  He led us towards the lavatory and begged Monsieur de Marquet to kneel  beside him. This lavatory is lit by the glass door, and, when the  door was open, the light which penetrated was sufficient to light it  perfectly. Monsieur de Marquet and Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille knelt  down on the threshold, and the young man pointed to a spot on the  pavement.    \"The stones of the lavatory have not been washed by Daddy Jacques for  some time,\" he said; \"that can be seen by the layer of dust that covers  them. Now, notice here, the marks of two large footprints and the black  ash they left where they have been. That ash is nothing else than the  charcoal dust that covers the path along which you must pass through the  forest, in order to get directly from Epinay to the Glandier. You know  there is a little village of charcoal-burners at that place, who make  large quantities of charcoal. What the murderer did was to come here at  midday, when there was nobody at the pavilion, and attempt his robbery.\"    \"But what robbery?--Where do you see any signs of robbery? What proves  to you that a robbery has been committed?\" we all cried at once. \"What  put me on the trace of it,\" continued the journalist...    \"Was this?\" interrupted Monsieur de Marquet, still on his knees.    \"Evidently,\" said Rouletabille.    And Monsieur de Marquet explained that there were on the dust of  the pavement marks of two footsteps, as well as the impression,  freshly-made, of a heavy rectangular parcel, the marks of the cord with  which it had been fastened being easily distinguished.    \"You have been here, then, Monsieur Rouletabille? I thought I had given  orders to Daddy Jacques, who Was left in charge of the pavilion, not to  allow anybody to enter.\"    \"Don't scold Daddy Jacques, I came here with Monsieur Robert Darzac.\"    \"Ah,--Indeed!\" exclaimed Monsieur de Marquet, disagreeably, casting a  side-glance at Monsieur Darzac, who remained perfectly silent.    \"When I saw the mark of the parcel by the side of the footprints, I had  no doubt as to the robbery,\" replied Monsieur Rouletabille. \"The thief  had not brought a parcel with him; he had made one here--a parcel with  the stolen objects, no doubt; and he put it in this corner intending  to take it away when the moment came for him to make his escape. He had  also placed his heavy boots beside the parcel,--for, see--there are no  marks of steps leading to the marks left by the boots, which were placed  side by side. That accounts for the fact that the murderer left no  trace of his steps when he fled from The Yellow Room, nor any in the  laboratory, nor in the vestibule. After entering The Yellow Room in his  boots, he took them off, finding them troublesome, or because he wished  to make as little noise as possible. The marks made by him in going  through the vestibule and the laboratory were subsequently washed out  by Daddy Jacques. Having, for some reason or other, taken off his boots,  the murderer carried them in his hand and placed them by the side of the  parcel he had made,--by that time the robbery had been accomplished. The  man then returned to The Yellow Room and slipped under the bed, where  the mark of his body is perfectly visible on the floor and even on the  mat, which has been slightly moved from its place and creased. Fragments  of straw also, recently torn, bear witness to the murderer's movements  under the bed.\"    \"Yes, yes,--we know all about that,\" said Monsieur de Marquet.    \"The robber had another motive for returning to hide under the bed,\"  continued the astonishing boy-journalist. \"You might think that he was  trying to hide himself quickly on seeing, through the vestibule window,  Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson about to enter the pavilion. It  would have been much easier for him to have climbed up to the attic and  hidden there, waiting for an opportunity to get away, if his purpose had  been only flight.--No! No!--he had to be in The Yellow Room.\"    Here the Chief intervened.    \"That's not at all bad, young man. I compliment you. If we do not know  yet how the murderer succeeded in getting away, we can at any rate see  how he came in and committed the robbery. But what did he steal?\"    \"Something very valuable,\" replied the young reporter.    At that moment we heard a cry from the laboratory. We rushed in and  found Monsieur Stangerson, his eyes haggard, his limbs trembling,  pointing to a sort of bookcase which he had opened, and which, we saw,  was empty. At the same instant he sank into the large armchair that was  placed before the desk and groaned, the tears rolling down his cheeks,  \"I have been robbed again! For God's sake, do not say a word of this to  my daughter. She would be more pained than I am.\" He heaved a deep sigh  and added, in a tone I shall never forget: \"After all, what does it  matter,--so long as she lives!\"    \"She will live!\" said Monsieur Darzac, in a voice strangely touching.    \"And we will find the stolen articles,\" said Monsieur Dax. \"But what was  in the cabinet?\"    \"Twenty years of my life,\" replied the illustrious professor sadly, \"or  rather of our lives--the lives of myself and my daughter! Yes, our  most precious documents, the records of our secret experiments and our  labours of twenty years were in that cabinet. It is an irreparable loss  to us and, I venture to say, to science. All the processes by which I  had been able to arrive at the precious proof of the destructibility of  matter were there--all. The man who came wished to take all from me,--my  daughter and my work--my heart and my soul.\"    And the great scientist wept like a child.    We stood around him in silence, deeply affected by his great distress.  Monsieur Darzac pressed closely to his side, and tried in vain to  restrain his tears--a sight which, for the moment, almost made me like  him, in spite of an instinctive repulsion which his strange demeanour  and his inexplicable anxiety had inspired me.    Monsieur Rouletabille alone,--as if his precious time and mission  on earth did not permit him to dwell in the contemplation on human  suffering--had, very calmly, stepped up to the empty cabinet and,  pointing at it, broke the almost solemn silence. He entered into  explanations, for which there was no need, as to why he had been led  to believe that a robbery had been committed, which included the  simultaneous discovery he had made in the lavatory, and the empty  precious cabinet in the laboratory. The first thing that had struck him,  he said, was the unusual form of that piece of furniture. It was very  strongly built of fire-proof iron, clearly showing that it was intended  for the keeping of most valuable objects. Then he noticed that the key  had been left in the lock. \"One does not ordinarily have a safe and  leave it open!\" he had said to himself. This little key, with its brass  head and complicated wards, had strongly attracted him,--its presence  had suggested robbery.    Monsieur de Marquet appeared to be greatly perplexed, as if he did  not know whether he ought to be glad of the new direction given to the  inquiry by the young reporter, or sorry that it had not been done by  himself. In our profession and for the general welfare, we have to put  up with such mortifications and bury selfish feelings. That was why  Monsieur de Marquet controlled himself and joined his compliments with  those of Monsieur Dax. As for Monsieur Rouletabille, he"]]]
