I've no brains for thee to-day.\" And she clapt the book together, and  turned her back.    So off the fool went to tell his mother. But as he got nigh the house,  out came folk running to tell him that his mother was dying.    And when he got in, his mother only looked at him and smiled as if to  say she could leave him with a quiet mind since he had got brains enough  now to look after himself--and then she died.    So down he sat and the more he thought about it the badder he felt. He  minded how she'd nursed him when he was a tiddy brat, and helped him  with his lessons, and cooked his dinners, and mended his clouts, and  bore with his foolishness; and he felt sorrier and sorrier, while he  began to sob and greet.    \"Oh, mother, mother!\" says he, \"who'll take care of me now? Thou  shouldn't have left me alone, for I liked thee better than everything!\"    And as he said that, he thought of the words of the wise woman. \"Hi,  yi!\" says he, \"must I take mother's heart to her?\"    \"No! I can't do that,\" says he. \"What'll I do? what'll I do to get that  pottle o' brains, now I'm alone in the world?\" So he thought and thought  and thought, and next day he went and borrowed a sack, and bundled his  mother in, and carried it on his shoulder up to the wise woman's  cottage.    \"Gode'en, missis,\" says he, \"I reckon I've fetched thee the right thing  this time, surely,\" and he plumped the sack down kerflap! in the  doorsill.    \"Maybe,\" says the wise woman, \"but read me this, now, what's yellow and  shining but isn't gold?\"    And he scratched his head, and thought and thought, but he couldn't  tell.    \"Thou 'st not hit the right thing, my lad,\" says she. \"I doubt thou 'rt  a bigger fool than I thought!\" and shut the door in his face.    \"See there!\" says he, and set down by the road side and greets.    \"I've lost the only two things as I cared for, and what else can I find  to buy a pottle o' brains with!\" and he fair howled, till the tears ran  down into his mouth. And up came a lass that lived near at hand, and  looked at him.    \"What's up with thee, fool?\" says she.    \"Oo, I've killed my pig, and lost my mother and I'm nobbut a fool  myself,\" says he, sobbing.    \"That's bad,\" says she; \"and haven't thee anybody to look after thee?\"    \"No,\" says he, \"and I canna buy my pottle o' brains, for there's nothing  I like best left!\"    \"What art talking about?\" says she.    And down she sets by him, and he told her all about the wise woman and  the pig, and his mother and the riddles, and that he was alone in the  world.    \"Well,\" says she, \"I wouldn't mind looking after thee myself.\"    \"Could thee do it?\" says he.    \"Ou, ay!\" says she; \"folks say as fools make good husbands, and I reckon  I'll have thee, if thou 'rt willing.\"    \"Can'st cook?\" says he.    \"Ay, I can,\" says she.    \"And scrub?\" says he.    \"Surely,\" says she.    \"And mend my clouts?\" says he.    \"I can that,\" says she.    \"I reckon thou 'lt do then as well as anybody,\" says he; \"but what'll I  do about this wise woman?\"    \"Oh, wait a bit,\" says she, \"something may turn up, and it'll not matter  if thou 'rt a fool, so long'st thou 'st got me to look after thee.\"    \"That's true,\" says he, and off they went and got married. And she kept  his house so clean and neat, and cooked his dinner so fine, that one  night he says to her: \"Lass, I'm thinking I like thee best of everything  after all.\"    \"That's good hearing,\" says she, \"and what then?\"    \"Have I got to kill thee, dost think, and take thy heart up to the wise  woman for that pottle o' brains?\"    \"Law, no!\" says she, looking skeered, \"I winna have that. But see here;  thou didn't cut out thy mother's heart, did thou?\"    \"No; but if I had, maybe I'd have got my pottle o' brains,\" says he.    \"Not a bit of it,\" says she; \"just thou take me as I be, heart and all,  and I'll wager I'll help thee read the riddles.\"    \"Can thee so?\" says he, doubtful like; \"I reckon they're too hard for  women folk.\"    \"Well,\" says she, \"let's see now. Tell me the first\"    \"What runs without feet?\" says he.    \"Why, water!\" says she.    \"It do,\" says he, and scratched his head.    \"And what's yellow and shining but isn't gold?\"    \"Why, the sun!\" says she.    \"Faith, it be!\" says he. \"Come, we'll go up to the wise woman at once,\"  and off they went. And as they came up the pad, she was sitting at the  door, twining straws.    \"Gode'en, missis,\" says he.    \"Gode'en, fool,\" says she.    \"I reckon I've fetched thee the right thing at last,\" says he.    The wise woman looked at them both, and wiped her spectacles.    \"Canst tell me what that is as has first no legs, and then two legs, and  ends with four legs?\"    And the fool scratched his head and thought and thought, but he couldn't  tell.    And the lass whispered in his ear:    \"It's a tadpole.\"    \"M'appen,\" says he then, \"it may be a tadpole, missis.\"    The wise woman nodded her head.    \"That's right,\" says she, \"and thou 'st got thy pottle o' brains  already.\"    \"Where be they?\" says he, looking about and feeling in his pockets.    \"In thy wife's head,\" says she. \"The only cure for a fool is a good wife  to look after him, and that thou 'st got, so gode'en to thee!\" And with  that she nodded to them, and up and into the house.    So they went home together, and he never wanted to buy a pottle o'  brains again, for his wife had enough for both.          The King of England and His Three Sons      Once upon a time there was an old king who had three sons; and the old  king fell very sick one time and there was nothing at all could make him  well but some golden apples from a far country. So the three brothers  went on horseback to look for some of these apples. They set off  together, and when they came to cross-roads they halted and refreshed  themselves a bit; and then they agreed to meet on a certain time, and  not one was to go home before the other. So Valentine took the right,  and Oliver went straight on, and poor Jack took the left.    To make my long story short, I shall follow poor Jack, and let the other  two take their chance, for I don't think there was much good in them.  Off poor Jack rides over hills, dales, valleys, and mountains, through  woolly woods and sheepwalks, where the old chap never sounded his hollow  bugle-horn, farther than I can tell you to-night or ever intend to tell  you.    At last he came to an old house, near a great forest, and there was an  old man sitting out by the door, and his look was enough to frighten you  or any one else; and the old man said to him:    \"Good morning, my king's son.\"    \"Good morning to you, old gentleman,\" was the young prince's answer;  frightened out of his wits though he was, he didn't like to give in.    The old gentleman told him to dismount and to go in to have some  refreshment, and to put his horse in the stable, such as it was. Jack  soon felt much better after having something to eat, and began to ask  the old gentleman how he knew he was a king's son.    \"Oh dear!\" said the old man, \"I knew that you were a king's son, and I  know what is your business better than what you do yourself. So you will  have to stay here to-night; and when you are in bed you mustn't be  frightened whatever you may hear. There will come all manner of frogs  and snakes, and some will try to get into your eyes and your mouth, but  mind, don't stir the least bit or you will turn into one of those things  yourself.\"    Poor Jack didn't know what to make of this, but, however, he ventured to  go to bed. Just as he thought to have a bit of sleep, round and over and  under him they came, but he never stirred an inch all night.    \"Well, my young son, how are you this morning?\"    \"Oh, I am very well, thank you, but I didn't have much rest.\"    \"Well, never mind that; you have got on very well so far, but you have  a great deal to go through before you can have the golden apples to go  to your father. You'd better come and have some breakfast before you  start on your way to my other brother's house. You will have to leave  your own horse here with me until you come back again, and tell me  everything about how you get on.\"    After that out came a fresh horse for the young prince, and the old man  gave him a ball of yarn, and he flung it between the horse's two ears.    Off he went as fast as the wind, which the wind behind could not catch  the wind before, until he came to the second oldest brother's house.  When he rode up to the door he had the same salute as from the first old  man, but this one was even uglier than the first one. He had long grey  hair, and his teeth were curling out of his mouth, and his finger- and  toe-nails had not been cut for many thousand years. He put the horse  into a much better stable, and called Jack in, and gave him plenty to  eat and drink, and they had a bit of a chat before they went to bed.    \"Well, my young son,\" said the old man, \"I suppose you are one of the  king's children come to look for the golden apples to bring him back to  health.\"    \"Yes, I am the youngest of the three brothers, and I should like to get  them to go back with.\"    \"Well, don't mind, my young son. Before you go to bed to-night I will  send to my eldest brother, and will tell him what you want, and he won't  have much trouble in sending you on to the place where you must get the  apples. But mind not to stir to-night no matter how you get bitten and  stung, or else you will work great mischief to yourself.\"    The young man went to bed and bore all, as he did the first night, and  got up the next morning well and hearty. After a good breakfast out  comes a fresh horse, and a ball of yarn to throw between his ears. The  old man told him to jump up quick, and said that he had made it all  right with his eldest brother, not to delay for anything whatever,  \"For,\" said he, \"you have a good deal to go through with in a very short  and quick time.\"    He flung"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14264"],[0,"The Practice and Science of Drawing (#17)"],[1,"against  the tone of the forehead.    [Illustration: Diagram VI.    ILLUSTRATING SOME POINTS CONNECTED WITH THE EYES NOT ALWAYS OBSERVED IN  DRAWING A HEAD]    The eyelashes do not count for much in drawing a head, except in so far  as they affect the tone impression. In the first place they shade the  white of the eye when the light is above, as is usually the case. They  are much thicker on the outer than on the inner side of the eyelids, and  have a tendency to grow in an outward direction, so that when the light  comes from the left, as is shown by arrow, Fig. 5, the white of the eye  at A1 will not be much shaded, and the light tone will run nearly up to  the top. But at B4, which should be the light side of this eye, the  thick crop of eyelashes will shade it somewhat and the light will not  run far up in consequence, while B3, A2 will be in the shade from the  turning away from the direction of the light of the spherical surface of  the whites of the eyes.    These may seem small points to mention, but the observance of such small  points makes a great difference to the construction of a head.    Fig. 6 gives a series of blocks all exactly alike in outline, with lines  showing how the different actions of the head affect the guide lines on  which the features hang; and how these actions can be suggested even  when the contours are not varied. These archings over should be  carefully looked out for when the head is in any but a simple full face  position.          IX    MASS DRAWING: PRACTICAL      This is the form of drawing with which painting in the oil medium is  properly concerned. The distinction between drawing and painting that is  sometimes made is a wrong one in so far as it conveys any idea of  painting being distinct from drawing. Painting is drawing (_i.e._ the  expression of form) with the added complication of colour and tone. And  with a brush full of paint as your tool, some form of mass drawing must  be adopted, so that at the same time that the student is progressing  with line drawing, he should begin to accustom, himself to this other  method of seeing, by attempting very simple exercises in drawing with  the brush.    Most objects can be reduced broadly into three tone masses, the lights  (including the high lights), the half tones, and the shadows. And the  habit of reducing things into a simple equation of three tones as a  foundation on which to build complex appearances should early be sought  for.    [Sidenote: Exercise in Mass Drawing.]    Here is a simple exercise in mass drawing with the brush that is, as far  as I know, never offered to the young student. Select a simple object:  some of those casts of fruit hanging up that are common in art schools  will do. Place it in a strong light and shade, preferably by artificial  light, as it is not so subtle, and therefore easier; the light  coming from either the right or left hand, but not from in front. Try  and arrange it so that the tone of the ground of your cast comes about  equal to the half tones in the relief.    [Illustration: Plate XXIII.    SET OF FOUR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SAME PAINTING FROM A CAST IN DIFFERENT  STAGES    No. 1. Blocking out the shape of spaces to be occupied by masses.    No. 2. A middle tone having been scumbled over the whole, the lights are  now painted. Their shapes and the play of lost-and-foundness on their  edges being observed. Gradations are got by thinner paint, which is  mixed with the wet middle tone of the ground, and is darkened.]    [Illustration: Plate XXIV.    SET OF FOUR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SAME PAINTING FROM A CAST IN DIFFERENT  STAGES    No. 3. The same as the last, with the addition of the darks; variety  being got in the same way as in the case of the lights, only here the  thinner part is lighter, whereas in the case of the lights it was  darker.    No. 4. The finished work, refinements being added and mistakes  corrected.]    First draw in the outlines of the #masses# strongly in charcoal, noting  the shapes of the shadows carefully, taking great care that you get  their shapes blocked out in square lines in true proportion relative to  each other, and troubling about little else. Let this be a setting out  of the ground upon which you will afterwards express the form, rather  than a drawing--the same scaffolding, in fact, that you were advised to  do in the case of a line drawing, only, in that case, the drawing proper  was to be done with a point, and in this case the drawing proper is to  be done with a brush full of paint. Fix the charcoal #well# with a spray  diffuser and the usual solution of white shellac in spirits of wine.    Taking raw umber and white (oil paint), mix up a tone that you think  equal to the half tones of the cast before you. Extreme care should be  taken in matching this tone. Now scumble this with a big brush equally  over the whole canvas (or whatever you are making your study on). Don't  use much medium, but if it is too stiff to go on thinly enough, put a  little oil with it, but no turpentine. By scumbling is meant rubbing the  colour into the canvas, working the brush from side to side rapidly, and  laying just the #thinnest solid tone# that will cover the surface. If  this is properly done, and your drawing was well fixed, you will just be  able to see it through the paint. Now mix up a tone equal to the highest  lights on the cast, and map out simply the shapes of the light masses on  your study, leaving the scumbled tone for the half tones. Note  carefully where the light masses come sharply against the half tones and  where they merge softly into them.    You will find that the scumbled tone of your ground will mix with the  tone of the lights with which you are painting, and darken it somewhat.  This will enable you to get the amount of variety you want in the tone  of the lights. The thicker you paint the lighter will be the tone, while  the thinner paint will be more affected by the original half tone, and  will consequently be darker. When this is done, mix up a tone equal to  the darkest shadow, and proceed to map out the shadows in the same way  as you did the lights; noting carefully where they come sharply against  the half tone and where they are lost. In the case of the shadows the  thicker you paint the darker will be the tone; and the thinner, the  lighter.    When the lights and shadows have been mapped out, if this has been done  with any accuracy, your work should be well advanced. And it now remains  to correct and refine it here and there, as you feel it wants it. Place  your work alongside the cast, and walk back to correct it. Faults that  are not apparent when close, are easily seen at a little distance.    I don't suggest that this is the right or only way of painting, but I do  suggest that exercises of this description will teach the student many  of the rudimentary essentials of painting, such elementary things as how  to lay a tone, how to manage a brush, how to resolve appearances into a  simple structure of tones, and how to manipulate your paint so as to  express the desired shape. This elementary paint drawing is, as far as I  know, never given as an exercise, the study of drawing at present being  confined to paper and charcoal or chalk mediums. Drawing in charcoal is  the nearest thing to this \"paint drawing,\" it being a sort of mixed  method, half line and half mass drawing. But although allied to  painting, it is a very different thing from expressing form with paint,  and no substitute for some elementary exercise with the brush. The use  of charcoal to the neglect of line drawing often gets the student into a  sloppy manner of work, and is not so good a training to the eye and hand  in clear, definite statement. Its popularity is no doubt due to the fact  that you can get much effect with little knowledge. Although this  painting into a middle tone is not by any means the only method of  painting, I do feel that it is the best method for studying form  expression with the brush.    But, when you come to colour, the fact of the opaque middle tone (or  half tone) being first painted over the whole will spoil the clearness  and transparency of your shadows, and may also interfere with the  brilliancy of the colour in the lights. When colour comes to be  considered it may be necessary to adopt many expedients that it is as  well not to trouble too much about until a further stage is reached. But  there is no necessity for the half tone to be painted over the shadows.  In working in colour the half tone or middle tone of the lights can be  made, and a middle tone of the shadows, and these two first painted  separately, the edges where they come together being carefully studied  and finished. Afterwards the variety of tone in the lights and the  shadows can be added. By this means the difference in the quality of the  colour between lights and shadows is preserved. This is an important  consideration, as there is generally a strong contrast between them, the  shadows usually being warm if the lights are cool and vice versa; and  such contrasts greatly affect the vitality of colouring.    Try always to do as much as possible with one stroke of the brush; paint  has a vitality when the touches are deft, that much handling and  continual touching kills. Look carefully at the shape and variety of the  tone you wish to express, and try and manipulate the swing of your brush  in such a way as to get in one touch as near the quality of shape and  gradation you want. Remember that the lightest part of your touch will  be where the brush first touches the canvas when you are painting lights  into a middle tone; and that as the amount of paint in the brush gets  less, so the tone will be more affected by what you are painting into,  and get darker. And in painting the shadows, the darkest part of your  stroke will be where the brush first touches the canvas; and it will  gradually lighten as the paint in your brush"]]]
