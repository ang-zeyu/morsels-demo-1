The blind, though unable to perceive the light of the sun, are,  nevertheless, capable of experiencing its continual heat. The blind in  heart, however, among the people of the Bayan--and to this God is My  witness--are impotent, no matter how long the Sun may shine upon them,  either to perceive the radiance of its glory, or to appreciate the warmth  of its rays.    Say: O people of the Bayan! We have chosen you out of the world to know  and recognize Our Self. We have caused you to draw nigh unto the right  side of Paradise--the Spot out of which the undying Fire crieth in manifold  accents: \"There is none other God besides Me, the All-Powerful, the Most  High!\" Take heed lest ye allow yourselves to be shut out as by a veil from  this Day Star that shineth above the dayspring of the Will of your Lord,  the All-Merciful, and whose light hath encompassed both the small and the  great. Purge your sight, that ye may perceive its glory with your own  eyes, and depend not on the sight of any one except your self, for God  hath never burdened any soul beyond its power. Thus hath it been sent down  unto the Prophets and Messengers of old, and been recorded in all the  Scriptures.    Strive, O people, to gain admittance into this vast Immensity for which  God ordained neither beginning nor end, in which His voice hath been  raised, and over which have been wafted the sweet savors of holiness and  glory. Divest not yourselves of the Robe of grandeur, neither suffer your  hearts to be deprived of remembering your Lord, nor your ears of  hearkening unto the sweet melodies of His wondrous, His sublime, His  all-compelling, His clear, and most eloquent voice.            LIII: O NASIR, O MY SERVANT! GOD, THE ETERNAL...      O Nasir, O My servant! God, the Eternal Truth, beareth Me witness. The  Celestial Youth hath, in this Day, raised above the heads of men the  glorious Chalice of Immortality, and is standing expectant upon His seat,  wondering what eye will recognize His glory, and what arm will,  unhesitatingly, be stretched forth to seize the Cup from His snow-white  Hand and drain it. Only a few have as yet quaffed from this peerless, this  soft-flowing grace of the Ancient King. These occupy the loftiest mansions  of Paradise, and are firmly established upon the seats of authority. By  the righteousness of God! Neither the mirrors of His glory, nor the  revealers of His names, nor any created thing, that hath been or will ever  be, can ever excel them, if ye be of them that comprehend this truth.    O Nasir! The excellence of this Day is immensely exalted above the  comprehension of men, however extensive their knowledge, however profound  their understanding. How much more must it transcend the imaginations of  them that have strayed from its light, and been shut out from its glory!  Shouldst thou rend asunder the grievous veil that blindeth thy vision,  thou wouldst behold such a bounty as naught, from the beginning that hath  no beginning till the end that hath no end, can either resemble or equal.  What language should He Who is the Mouthpiece of God choose to speak, so  that they who are shut out as by a veil from Him can recognize His glory?  The righteous, inmates of the Kingdom on high, shall drink deep from the  Wine of Holiness, in My name, the all-glorious. None other besides them  will share such benefits.            LIV: BY THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD, MY WELL-BELOVED!...      By the righteousness of God, my Well-Beloved! I have never aspired after  worldly leadership. My sole purpose hath been to hand down unto men that  which I was bidden to deliver by God, the Gracious, the Incomparable, that  it may detach them from all that pertaineth to this world, and cause them  to attain such heights as neither the ungodly can conceive, nor the  froward imagine.            LV: CALL THOU TO REMEMBRANCE, O LAND OF TA...      Call thou to remembrance, O Land of Ta (Tihran), the former days in which  thy Lord had made thee the seat of His throne, and had enveloped thee with  the effulgence of His glory. How vast the number of those sanctified  beings, those symbols of certitude, who, in their great love for thee,  have laid down their lives and sacrificed their all for thy sake! Joy be  to thee, and blissfulness to them that inhabit thee. I testify that out of  thee, as every discerning heart knoweth, proceedeth the living breath of  Him Who is the Desire of the world. In thee the Unseen hath been revealed,  and out of thee hath gone forth that which lay hid from the eyes of men.  Which one of the multitude of thy sincere lovers shall We remember, whose  blood hath been shed within thy gates, and whose dust is now concealed  beneath thy soil? The sweet savors of God have unceasingly been wafted,  and shall everlastingly continue to be wafted upon thee. Our Pen is moved  to commemorate thee, and to extol the victims of tyranny, those men and  women that sleep beneath thy dust.    Among them is Our own sister, whom We now call to mind as a token of Our  fidelity, and as proof of Our loving-kindness, unto her. How piteous was  her plight! In what a state of resignation she returned to her God! We,  alone, in Our all-encompassing knowledge, have known it.    O Land of Ta! Thou art still, through the grace of God, a center around  which His beloved ones have gathered. Happy are they; happy every refugee  that seeketh thy shelter, in his sufferings in the path of God, the Lord  of this wondrous Day! Blessed are they that remember the one true God,  that magnify His Name, and seek diligently to serve His Cause. It is to  these men that the sacred Books of old have referred. On them hath the  Commander of the Faithful lavished his praise, saying: \"The blessedness  awaiting them excelleth the blessedness we now enjoy.\" He, verily, hath  spoken the truth, and to this We now testify. The glory of their station,  however, is as yet undisclosed. The Hand of Divine power will, assuredly,  lift up the veil, and expose to the sight of men that which shall cheer  and lighten the eye of the world.    Render thanks unto God, the Eternal Truth, exalted be His glory, inasmuch  as ye have attained so wondrous a favor, and been adorned with the  ornament of His praise. Appreciate the value of these days, and cleave to  whatsoever beseemeth this Revelation. He, verily, is the Counsellor, the  Compassionate, the All-Knowing.            LVI: LET NOTHING GRIEVE THEE, O LAND OF TA...      Let nothing grieve thee, O Land of Ta (Tihran), for God hath chosen thee  to be the source of the joy of all mankind. He shall, if it be His Will,  bless thy throne with one who will rule with justice, who will gather  together the flock of God which the wolves have scattered. Such a ruler  will, with joy and gladness, turn his face towards, and extend his favors  unto, the people of Baha. He indeed is accounted in the sight of God as a  jewel among men. Upon him rest forever the glory of God, and the glory of  all that dwell in the kingdom of His revelation.    Rejoice with great joy, for God hath made thee \"the Day Spring of His  light,\" inasmuch as within thee was born the Manifestation of His Glory.  Be thou glad for this name that hath been conferred upon thee--a name  through which the Day Star of grace hath shed its splendor, through which  both earth and heaven have been illumined.    Ere long will the state of affairs within thee be changed, and the reins  of power fall into the hands of the people. Verily, thy Lord is the  All-Knowing. His authority embraceth all things. Rest thou assured in the  gracious favor of thy Lord. The eye of His loving-kindness shall  everlastingly be directed towards thee. The day is approaching when thy  agitation will have been transmuted into peace and quiet calm. Thus hath  it been decreed in the wondrous Book.            LVII: WHEN THOU ART DEPARTED OUT OF THE COURT OF...      When thou art departed out of the court of My presence, O Muhammad, direct  thy steps towards My House (Ba_gh_dad House), and visit it on behalf of  thy Lord. When thou reachest its door, stand thou before it and say:  Whither is the Ancient Beauty gone, O most great House of God, He through  Whom God hath made thee the cynosure of an adoring world, and proclaimed  thee to be the sign of His remembrance unto all who are in the heavens and  all who are on the earth? Oh! for the former days when thou, O House of  God, wert made His footstool, the days when in ceaseless strains the  melody of the All-Merciful poured forth from thee! What hath become of thy  jewel whose glory hath irradiated all creation? Whither are gone the days  in which He, the Ancient King, had made thee the throne of His glory, the  days in which He had chosen thee alone to be the lamp of salvation between  earth and heaven, and caused thee to diffuse, at dawn and at eventide, the  sweet fragrance of the All-Glorious?    Where, O House of God, is the Sun of majesty and power Who had enveloped  thee with the brightness of His presence? Where is He, the Day Spring of  the tender mercies of thy Lord, the Unconstrained, Who had established His  seat within thy walls? What is it, O throne of God, that hath altered thy  countenance, and made thy pillars to tremble? What could have closed thy  door to the face of them that eagerly seek thee? What hath made thee so  desolate? Couldst thou have been told that the Beloved of the world is  pursued by the swords of His enemies? The Lord bless thee, and bless thy  fidelity unto Him, inasmuch as thou hast remained His companion through  all His sorrows and His sufferings.    I testify that thou art the scene of His transcendent glory, His most holy  habitation. Out of thee hath gone forth the Breath of the All-Glorious, a  Breath that hath breathed over all created things, and filled with joy the  breasts of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16949"],[0,"Flowers from a Persian Garden and Other Papers (#17)"],[1,"he was at length outwitted by the famous  Arabian poet Al-Asma'i: It is said that a khalif, who was very  penurious, contrived by a trick to send from his presence without any  reward those poets who came and recited their compositions to him. He  had himself the faculty of retaining in his memory a poem after hearing  it only once; he had a mamluk (white slave) who could repeat one that he  had heard twice; and a slave-girl who could repeat one that she had  heard thrice. Whenever a poet came to compliment him with a panegyrical  poem, the king used to promise him that if he found his verses to be of  his own composition he would give him a sum of money equal in weight to  what they were written on. The poet, consenting, would recite his ode,  and the king would say: \"It is not new, for I have known it some years\";  and he would repeat it as he had heard it; after which he would add:  \"And this mamluk also retains it in his memory,\" and order the mamluk to  repeat it, which, having heard it twice, from the poet and the king, he  would do. Then the king would say to the poet: \"I have also a slave-girl  who can repeat it,\" and, ordering her to do so, stationed behind the  curtains, she would repeat what she had thus thrice heard; so the poet  would go away empty-handed. The celebrated poet Al-Asma'i, having heard  of this device, determined upon outwitting the king, and accordingly  composed an ode made up of very difficult words. But this was not the  poet's only preparative measure--another will be presently explained;  and a third was to assume the dress of a Bedouin, that he might not be  known, covering his face, the eyes only excepted, with a _litham_ (piece  of drapery), as is usual with the Arabs of the desert. Thus disguised,  he went to the palace, and having obtained permission, entered and  saluted the king, who said to him: \"Who art thou, O brother of the  Arabs? and what dost thou desire?\" The poet answered: \"May Allah  increase the power of the king! I am a poet of such a tribe, and have  composed an ode in praise of our lord the khalif.\" \"O brother of the  Arabs,\" said the king, \"hast thou heard of our condition?\" \"No,\"  answered the poet; \"and what is it, O khalif of the age?\" \"It is,\"  replied the king, \"that if the ode be not thine, we give thee no reward;  and if it be thine, we give thee the weight in money equal to what it is  written upon.\" \"How,\" said the poet, \"should I assume to myself that  which belongeth to another, and knowing, too, that lying before kings is  one of the basest of actions? But I agree to the condition, O our lord  the khalif.\" So he repeated his ode. The king, perplexed, and unable to  remember any of it, made a sign to the mamluk, but he had retained  nothing; then called to the female slave, but she was unable to repeat a  word. \"O brother of the Arabs,\" said the king, \"thou hast spoken truth;  and the ode is thine without doubt. I have never heard it before.  Produce, therefore, what it is written upon, and I will give thee its  weight in money, as I have promised.\" \"Wilt thou,\" said the poet, \"send  one of the attendants to carry it?\" \"To carry what?\" demanded the king.  \"Is it not upon a paper in thy possession?\" \"No, O our lord the khalif.  At the time I composed it I could not procure a piece of paper on which  to write it, and could find nothing but a fragment of a marble column  left me by my father; so I engraved it upon that, and it lies in the  courtyard of the palace.\" He had brought it, wrapped up, on the back of  a camel. The king, to fulfil his promise, was obliged to exhaust his  treasury; and, to prevent a repetition of this trick, in future rewarded  poets according to the custom of kings.           *       *       *       *       *    _Apropos_ of royal gifts to poets, it is related that, when the Afghans  had possession of Persia, a rude chief of that nation was governor of  Shiraz. A poet composed a panegyric on his wisdom, his valour, and his  virtues. As he was taking it to the palace he was met by a friend at the  outer gate, who inquired where he was going, and he informed him of his  purpose. His friend asked him if he was insane, to offer an ode to a  barbarian who hardly understood a word of the Persian language. \"All  that you say may be very true,\" said the poor poet, \"but I am starving,  and have no means of livelihood but by making verses. I must, therefore,  proceed.\" He went and stood before the governor with his ode in his  hand. \"Who is that fellow?\" said the Afghan lord. \"And what is that  paper which he holds?\" \"I am a poet,\" answered the man, \"and this paper  contains some poetry.\" \"What is the use of poetry?\" demanded the  governor. \"To render great men like you immortal,\" he replied, making at  the same time a profound bow. \"Let us hear some of it.\" The poet, on  this mandate, began reading his composition aloud, but he had not  finished the second stanza when he was interrupted. \"Enough!\" exclaimed  the governor; \"I understand it all. Give the poor man some money--_that_  is what he wants.\" As the poet retired he met his friend, who again  commented on the folly of carrying odes to a man who did not understand  one of them. \"Not understand!\" he replied. \"You are quite mistaken. He  has beyond all men the quickest apprehension of a _poet's meaning_!\"    The khalifs were frequently lavish of their gifts to poets, but they  were fond of having their little jokes with them when in merry mood. One  day the Arabian poet Thalebi read before the khalif Al-Mansur a poem  which he had just composed, and it found acceptance. The khalif said: \"O  Thalebi, which wouldst thou rather have--that I give thee 300 gold  dinars [about L150], or three wise sayings, each worth 100 dinars?\" The  poet replied: \"Learning, O Commander of the Faithful, is better than  transitory treasure.\" \"Well, then,\" said the khalif, \"the first saying  is: When thy garment grows old, sew not a new patch on it, for it hath  an ill look.\" \"O woe!\" cried the poet, \"one hundred dinars are lost!\"  Mansur smiled, and proceeded: \"The second saying is: When thou anointest  thy beard, anoint not the lower part, for that would soil the collar of  thy vest.\" \"Alas!\" exclaimed Thalebi, \"a thousand times, alas! two  hundred dinars are lost!\" Again the khalif smiled, and continued: \"The  third saying\"--but before he had spoken it, the poet said: \"O khalif of  our prosperity, keep the third maxim in thy treasury, and give me the  remaining hundred dinars, for they will be worth a thousand times more  to me than the hearing of maxims.\" At this the khalif laughed heartily,  and commanded his treasurer to give Thalebi five hundred dinars of gold.    A droll story is told of the Persian poet Anwari: Passing the  market-place of Balkh one day, he saw a crowd of people standing in a  ring, and going up, he put his head within the circle and found a fellow  reciting the poems of Anwari himself as his own. Anwari went up to the  man, and said: \"Sir, whose poems are these you are reciting?\" He  replied: \"They are Anwari's.\" \"Do you know him, then?\" said Anwari. The  man, with cool effrontery, answered: \"What do you say? I am Anwari.\" On  hearing this Anwari laughed, and remarked: \"I have heard of one who  stole poetry, but never of one who stole the poet himself!\"--Talking of  \"stealing poetry,\" Jami tells us that a man once brought a composition  to a critic, every line of which he had plagiarised from different  collections of poems, and each rhetorical figure from various authors.  Quoth the critic: \"For a wonder, thou hast brought a line of camels; but  if the string were untied, every one of the herd would run away in  different directions.\"    There is no little humour in the story of the Persian poet who wrote a  eulogium on a rich man, but got nothing for his trouble; he then abused  the rich man, but he said nothing; he next seated himself at the rich  man's gate, who said to him: \"You praised me, and I said nothing; you  abused me, and I said nothing; and now, why are you sitting here?\" The  poet answered: \"I only wish that when you die I may perform the funeral  service.\"          V    UNLUCKY OMENS--THE OLD MAN'S PRAYER--THE OLD WOMAN IN THE MOSQUE--THE  WEEPING TURKMANS--THE TEN FOOLISH PEASANTS--THE WAKEFUL SERVANT--THE  THREE DERVISHES--THE OIL-MAN'S PARROT--THE MOGHUL AND HIS PARROT--THE  PERSIAN SHOPKEEPER AND THE PRIME MINISTER--HEBREW FACETIAE.      Muslims and other Asiatic peoples, like Europeans not so many centuries  since, are always on the watch for lucky or unlucky omens. On first  going out of a morning, the looks and countenances of those who cross  their path are scrutinised, and a smile or a frown is deemed favourable  or the reverse. To encounter a person blind of the left eye, or even  with one eye, forebodes sorrow and calamity. While Sir John Malcolm was  in Persia, as British Ambassador, he was told the following story: When  Abbas the Great was hunting, he met one morning as day dawned an  uncommonly ugly man, at the sight of whom his horse started. Being  nearly dismounted, and deeming it a bad omen, the king called out in a  rage to have his head cut off. The poor peasant, whom the attendants had  seized and were on the point of executing, prayed that he might be  informed of his crime. \"Your crime,\" said the king, \"is your unlucky  countenance, which is the first object I saw this morning, and which has  nearly caused me to fall from my horse.\" \"Alas!\" said the man, \"by this  reckoning what term must I apply to your Majesty's countenance, which  was the first object my eyes met this morning, and which is to cause my  death?\" The king smiled at the wit of the reply, ordered the man to be  released, and gave him a present instead of cutting off his  head.--Another Persian story is to the same purpose: A man said to his  servant: \"If you see two crows together early in the morning, apprise me  of it, that I may also behold them, as it will be a"]]]
