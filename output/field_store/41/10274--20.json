And in an age  when slavery was as accepted a condition as factory-labor is to-day,  he ventured to assert the principle of the equality of man. \"If,\"  saith the law, \"one of thy brethren be sold to thee, let him serve  thee for six years, and in the seventh year let him go free without  payment.\" And Philo thereon comments:[156] \"A second time Moses calls  our fellow-creature brother, to impress upon the master that he has a  tie with his servant, so that he may not neglect him as a stranger.  Nay, but if he follows the direction of the law, he will feel sympathy  with him, and will not be vexed when he is about to liberate him. For  though we call our servants slaves, yet in verity they are only  dependents who serve us in order to have the means of life.\" This  corresponds with the Talmud dictum, \"Whoever buys a Jewish slave buys  a master for himself.\"[157] Commenting again upon the verse in Exodus  xxi. 6, which says with seeming harshness that a servant who wishes to  stay with his master after the year of emancipation has arrived, shall  be nailed by the ear to a door, he explains that no man should consent  of his own will to be a slave, for we should only be servants of God;  and if a man deliberately rejects freedom for comfort, he should wear  a mark of degradation. The so-called Christian principle of the  dignity of human life and the equality of man, Philo shows to be the  spirit of the Mosaic law, not limited within the confines of one  nation, but valid for the world. Nor is it contained therein as a mere  sentimental aspiration, but it is realized in the institutions of the  Jewish polity.    Philo looked for the same broad principles in his treatment of the  ceremonial law. The Sabbath day is the central observance, one might  say, the lodestar of the Jewish life, round which the other ceremonies  revolve. The Sabbath is the call to man's higher nature, for it is the  day on which we are bidden to devote ourselves to the Divine power  within us and to seek to know God. \"The six days in which the Creator  made the universe are an example to us to work, but the seventh day,  on which He rested, is an example to us to meditate. As on that day  God is said to have looked upon His work, so we, too, should  contemplate the universe thereon, and consider our highest welfare.  Let us never neglect the example of the best life, the combination of  action and thought, but keeping a clear vision of it before our minds,  so far as our human nature will permit, let us liken ourselves to  immortal God by word and deed.\"[158] High-flown this language may be,  but what Philo wishes to mark is the spiritual value of the Sabbath.  It is not merely a day of rest from workaday toil, but it is a day  upon which we devote all our thoughts to God, and enter into closer  communion with Him, [Hebrew: mnoht 'hba vndba], a repose of love and  devotion. Heine said that on one day of the week the lowliest Jew became  a prince, Philo that he became a philosopher. As in all of Philo's  interpretations of Jewish custom, there is something mystic in his  conception of the Sabbath. For he regards all Divine service and all  prayer as a mystic rite which leads the human soul unto God. In the  special ordinances of the day he finds a spiritual motive. We may not  touch fire, because fire is the seed and beginning of industry.[159]  The servant of the house may not work,[160] because on this day he  shall have a taste of freedom and humanity, and he will work the more  cheerfully during the remaining six days. Some rabbis later, when  numbers of Gentiles had adopted this without the other institutions of  Judaism, claimed the Sabbath as the special heritage of Israel; and in  the book of Jubilees[161] it is said that Israel alone has the right  to observe the Sabbath. Not so Philo, who, desiring to give the day a  value for all, regards it as God's covenant with the whole of  humanity.[162]    The Sabbath idea is reflected in all the festivals, which have as  their dominating idea man's joyful gratitude to God. Influenced  probably by a mystic fondness for certain numbers, Philo enumerates  ten festivals, as follows:[163] (1) Each day in the year, if we use it  aright--a truly Philonic conception; (2) The Sabbath; (3) The new  moon--then in Alexandria, as in Palestine, a solemn day; (4) The  Passover; (5) The bringing of the first barley ('Omer); (6) The Feast  of Unleavened Bread. These last three are separate aspects of one  celebration, which is divided up so as to produce the holy decad. (7)  Pentecost; (8) New Year; (9) Atonement (to the mystic the Feast of  feasts); (10) Tabernacles. Following his design of revealing in  Judaism a religion of universal validity, Philo points out in all  these festivals a double meaning. On the one hand, they mark God's  providence to His chosen people, shown in some great event of their  history--this is the special meaning for the Israelite--and, on the  other, they indicate God's goodness as revealed in the march of  nature, and thus help to bind man to the universal process. So  Passover is the festival of the spring and a memorial of the creation  ([Hebrew: zbr lm'sha br'shit]) as well as the memorial of the great Exodus,  and of our gratitude for the deliverance from the inhospitable land of  Egypt. And those who look for a deeper moral meaning may find in it a  symbol of the passing over from the life of the senses to the life with  God. Similarly, Philo deals with the other festivals,[164] and in their  particular ceremonies he finds symbols which stamp eternal lessons of  history and of morality upon our hearts. The unleavened bread is the  mark of the simple life, the New Year Shofar of the Divine rule of  peace, the Sukkot booth of the equality of all men, and, as he puts it  elsewhere, of man's duty in prosperity to remember the troubles of his  past, so that he may worthily recognize God's goodness. Much of this  may appear trite to us; and the association of the festivals with the  seasons of nature may to some appear a false development of historical  Judaism; nevertheless Philo's treatment of this part of the Torah is  notable. It shows remarkable feeling for the ethical import of the  law, and it establishes the harmony between the Greek and Hebrew  conceptions of the Deity by combining the God of history with the God  of nature in the same festival. The ideas were not unknown to  Palestinian rabbis; Philo, by giving them a Greek dress, opened them  to the world.    Equally remarkable and equally suggestive is Philo's treatment of the  dietary laws. We have seen that he placed them under the governing  principle of the tenth commandment, \"Thou shalt not covet,\" or, more  broadly, \"Thou shalt not have base desires.\" The dietary laws are at  once a symbol and a discipline of temperance and self-control. We know  that the Greeks, as soon as they had a superficial knowledge of Jewish  observance, jeered at the barbarous and stupid superstition of  refusing to eat pork. Again we are told in the letter of the false  Aristeas that when Ptolemy's ambassadors went to Jerusalem, to summon  learned men to translate the Torah into Greek, Eleazar, the high  priest, instructed them in the deeper moral meaning of the dietary  laws. Further, in the fourth book of the Maccabees--an Alexandrian  sermon upon the Empire of Right Reason--we find an eloquent defence of  these same laws as the precepts of reason which fortify our minds.  Philo, then, is following a tradition, but he improves upon it.  Accepting the Platonic psychology, which divided the soul into reason,  temper (_i.e._, will), and desire, he shows how the aim of the Mosaic  law about food is to control desire and will, so as to make them  subservient to reason. By practicing self-restraint in the two  commonest actions of life--eating and drinking--the Israelite acquires  it in all things. The hard ascetic who would root out bodily desires  errs against human nature, but the wise legislator controls them and  curbs them by precepts, so that they are bent to the higher reason.    Modern apologists for Judaism have been found who, trying to force  science to support their tottering faith, allege that the dietary law  is hygienic. Philo relies on no such treacherous reed. We may not eat,  he says,[165] the flesh of the pig or shell-fish, not because they are  unhealthy, but because they are the sweetest and most delightful of  all food, and for that very reason they are marks of the sensual life.  This and this alone is the true religious justification of the dietary  law.    In this way, by showing how the letter represents the spirit, Philo  fulfils the law; his religion is liberal in thought, conservative in  practice. He sees clearly that to throw off the law and reject  tradition involves in the end chaos and the overthrow of  righteousness. And certain Christian--and other--theologians, if one  may make bold to say so, fail to realize the spirit of Philo, when  they speak of him as a man who approached the light, but was too tied  down by the old traditions to receive the full illumination. Rather is  it true that the Jewish aspiration of \"freedom under the law,\" or  spirit through the letter, is absolutely fundamental in Philo, and  loyalty to the Torah is a guiding principle in his religious outlook.  He asserts it clearly and strikingly, not only in his ethical  commentary on the law, but in his philosophical allegories. Both  passages deserve quotation, since they mark the fundamental contrast  between Philo and non-Jewish allegorists of the law. In the first  Philo is commenting upon the command \"Thou shalt not add to or take  away from the law\" (Deut. xix. 14).[166] He shows first how each of  the virtues is marred by excess in either direction; virtue in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14667"],[0,"A Christmas Garland (#17)"],[1,"stalest of them  all is Erse....

Passengers through cushioned space,  flying top-speed or dallying with obscure stations not alighted at  apparently, have had it pointed out to them as beheld dimly for a  privileged instant before they sink back behind crackling barrier of  instructive paper with a \"Thank you, Sir,\" or \"Madam,\" as the case  may be. Guide-books praise it. I conceive they shall be studied for  a cock-shy of rainbow epithets slashed in at the target of Landed  Gentry, premonitorily. The tintinnabulation's enough. Periodical  footings of Clashthoughts into Mayfair or the Tyrol, signalled by the  slide from its mast of a crested index of Aeolian caprice, blazon of  their presence, give the curious a right to spin through the halls  and galleries under a cackle of housekeeper guideship--scramble for a  chuck of the dainties, dog fashion. There is something to be said for  the rope's twist. Wisdom skips.    It is recorded that the goblins of this same Lady Wisdom were all agog  one Christmas morning between the doors of the house and the village  church, which crouches on the outskirt of the park, with something of  a lodge in its look, you might say, more than of celestial twinkles,  even with Christmas hoar-frost bleaching the grey of it in sunlight,  as one sees imaged on seasonable missives for amity in the trays  marked \"sixpence and upwards,\" here and there, on the counters of  barter.    Be sure these goblins made obeisance to Sir Peter Clashthought, as he  passed by, starched beacon of squirearchy, wife on arm, sons to heel.  After him, certain members of the household--rose-chapped males and  females, bearing books of worship. The pack of goblins glance up  the drive with nudging elbows and whisperings of \"Where is daughter  Euphemia? Where Sir Rebus, her affianced?\"    Off they scamper for a peep through the windows of the house. They  throng the sill of the library, ears acock and eyelids twittering  admiration of a prospect. Euphemia was in view of them--essence of  her. Sir Rebus was at her side. Nothing slips the goblins.    \"Nymph in the Heavy Dragoons\" was Mrs. Cryptic-Sparkler's famous  definition of her. The County took it for final--an uncut gem with  a fleck in the heart of it. Euphemia condoned the imagery. She had  breadth. Heels that spread ample curves over the ground she stood on,  and hands that might floor you with a clench of them, were hers. Grey  eyes looked out lucid and fearless under swelling temples that were  lost in a ruffling copse of hair. Her nose was virginal, with hints of  the Iron Duke at most angles. Square chin, cleft centrally, gave  her throat the look of a tower with a gun protrudent at top. She was  dressed for church evidently, but seemed no slave to Time. Her bonnet  was pushed well back from her head, and she was fingering the ribbons.  One saw she was a woman. She inspired deference.    \"Forefinger for Shepherd's Crook\" was what Mrs. Cryptic-Sparkler had  said of Sir Rebus. It shall stand at that.    \"You have Prayer Book?\" he queried.    She nodded. Juno catches the connubial trick.    \"Hymns?\"    \"Ancient and Modern.\"    \"I may share with you?\"    \"I know by heart. Parrots sing.\"    \"Philomel carols,\" he bent to her.    \"Complaints spoil a festival.\"    He waved hand to the door. \"Lady, your father has started.\"    \"He knows the adage. Copy-books instil it.\"    \"Inexorable truth in it.\"    \"We may dodge the scythe.\"    \"To be choked with the sands?\"    She flashed a smile. \"I would not,\" he said, \"that my Euphemia were  late for the Absolution.\"    She cast eyes to the carpet. He caught them at the rebound.    \"It snows,\" she murmured, swimming to the window.    \"A flake, no more. The season claims it.\"    \"I have thin boots.\"    \"Another pair?\"    \"My maid buttons. She is at church.\"    \"My fingers?\"    \"Ten on each.\"    \"Five,\" he corrected.    \"Buttons.\"    \"I beg your pardon.\"    She saw opportunity. She swam to the bell-rope and grasped it for a  tinkle. The action spread feminine curves to her lover's eyes. He was  a man.    Obsequiousness loomed in the doorway. Its mistress flashed an order  for port--two glasses. Sir Rebus sprang a pair of eyebrows on her.  Suspicion slid down the banisters of his mind, trailing a blue ribbon.  Inebriates were one of his hobbies. For an instant she was sunset.    \"Medicinal,\" she murmured.    \"Forgive me, Madam. A glass, certainly. 'Twill warm us for  worshipping.\"    The wine appeared, seemed to blink owlishly through the facets of  its decanter, like some hoary captive dragged forth into light after  years of subterraneous darkness--something querulous in the sudden  liberation of it. Or say that it gleamed benignant from its tray,  steady-borne by the hands of reverence, as one has seen Infallibility  pass with uplifting of jewelled fingers through genuflexions to the  Balcony. Port has this in it: that it compels obeisance, master of us;  as opposed to brother and sister wines wooing us with a coy flush in  the gold of them to a cursory tope or harlequin leap shimmering up the  veins with a sly wink at us through eyelets. Hussy vintages swim to a  cosset. We go to Port, mark you!    Sir Rebus sipped with an affectionate twirl of thumb at the glass's  stem. He said \"One scents the cobwebs.\"    \"Catches in them,\" Euphemia flung at him.    \"I take you. Bacchus laughs in the web.\"    \"Unspun but for Pallas.\"    \"A lady's jealousy.\"    \"Forethought, rather.\"    \"Brewed in the paternal pate. Grant it!\"    \"For a spring in accoutrements.\"    Sir Rebus inclined gravely. Port precludes prolongment of the riposte.    She replenished glasses. Deprecation yielded. \"A step,\" she said, \"and  we are in time for the First Lesson.\"    \"This,\" he agreed, \"is a wine.\"    \"There are blasphemies in posture. One should sit to it.\"    \"Perhaps.\" He sank to commodious throne of leather indicated by her  finger.    Again she filled for him. \"This time, no heel-taps,\" she was  imperative. \"The Litany demands basis.\"    \"True.\" He drained, not repelling the decanter placed at his elbow.    \"It is a wine,\" he presently repeated with a rolling tongue over it.    \"Laid down by my great-grandfather. Cloistral.\"    \"Strange,\" he said, examining the stopper, \"no date. Antediluvian.  Sound, though.\"    He drew out his note-book. \"_The senses_\" he wrote, \"_are internecine.  They shall have learned esprit de corps before they enslave us._\" This  was one of his happiest flings to general from particular. \"_Visual  distraction cries havoc to ultimate delicacy of palate_\" would but  have pinned us a butterfly best a-hover; nor even so should we have  had truth of why the aphorist, closing note-book and nestling back of  head against that of chair, closed eyes also.    As by some such law as lurks in meteorological toy for our guidance  in climes close-knit with Irony for bewilderment, making egress of old  woman synchronise inevitably with old man's ingress, or the other way  about, the force that closed the aphorist's eye-lids parted his lips  in degree according. Thus had Euphemia, erect on hearth-rug, a cavern  to gaze down into. Outworks of fortifying ivory cast but denser  shadows into the inexplorable. The solitudes here grew murmurous. To  and fro through secret passages in the recesses leading up deviously  to lesser twin caverns of nose above, the gnomes Morphean went about  their business, whispering at first, but presently bold to wind horns  in unison--Roland-wise, not less.    Euphemia had an ear for it; whim also to construe lord and master  relaxed but reboant and soaring above the verbal to harmonic truths  of abstract or transcendental, to be hummed subsequently by privileged  female audience of one bent on a hook-or-crook plucking out of pith  for salvation.    She caught tablets pendent at her girdle. \"_How long_,\" queried her  stilus, \"_has our sex had humour? Jael hammered._\"    She might have hitched speculation further. But Mother Earth,  white-mantled, called to her.    Casting eye of caution at recumbence, she paddled across the carpet  and anon swam out over the snow.    Pagan young womanhood, six foot of it, spanned eight miles before  luncheon.       "]]]
