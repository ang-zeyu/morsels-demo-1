It is  therefore preferable to keep on with the use of steam and at the same time  continuously to examine into the possibility of there being a far greater  force available. One should regard the other technological advances,  sciences, arts and political formulae of proven usefulness in the same  light--i.e., those procedures which, down the ages, have time and again  been put to the test and whose many uses and advantages have demonstrably  resulted in the glory and greatness of the state, and the well-being and  progress of the people. Should all these be abandoned, for no valid  reason, and other methods of reform be attempted, by the time such reforms  might eventuate, and their advantages might be put to proof, many years  would go by, and many lives. Meanwhile, \"we are still at the first bend in  the road.\"(74)    The superiority of the present in relation to the past consists in this,  that the present can take over and adopt as a model many things which have  been tried and tested and the great benefits of which have been  demonstrated in the past, and that it can make its own new discoveries and  by these augment its valuable inheritance. It is clear, then, that the  accomplishment and experience of the past are known and available to the  present, while the discoveries peculiar to the present were unknown to the  past. This presupposes that the later generation is made up of persons of  ability; otherwise, how many a later generation has lacked even so much as  a drop out of the boundless ocean of knowledge that was its forbears'.    Reflect a little: let us suppose that, through the power of God, certain  individuals are placed on earth; these obviously stand in need of many  things, to provide for their human dignity, their happiness and ease. Now  is it more practicable for them to acquire these things from their  contemporaries, or should they, in each successive generation, borrow  nothing, but instead independently create one or another of the  instrumentalities which are necessary to human existence?    Should some maintain that those laws, principles and fundamentals of  progress on the highest levels of a fully developed society, which are  current in other countries, are not suited to the condition and the  traditional needs of Persia's people, and that on this account it is  necessary that within Iran, the nations' planners should exert their  utmost efforts to bring about reforms appropriate to Persia--let them first  explain what harm could come from such foreign importations.    If the country were built up, the roads repaired, the lot of the helpless  improved by various means, the poor rehabilitated, the masses set on the  path to progress, the avenues of public wealth increased, the scope of  education widened, the government properly organized, and the free  exercise of the individual's rights, and the security of his person and  property, his dignity and good name, assured--would all this be at odds  with the character of the Persian people? Whatever is in conflict with  these measures has already been proved injurious, in every country, and  does not concern one locality more than another.    These superstitions result in their entirety from lack of wisdom and  understanding, and insufficient observation and analysis. Indeed, the  majority of the reactionaries and the procrastinators are only concealing  their own selfish interests under a barrage of idle words, and confusing  the minds of the helpless masses with public statements which bear no  relation to their well-concealed objectives.    O people of Persia! The heart is a divine trust; cleanse it from the stain  of self-love, adorn it with the coronal of pure intent, until the sacred  honor, the abiding greatness of this illustrious nation may shine out like  the true morning in an auspicious heaven. This handful of days on earth  will slip away like shadows and be over. Strive then that God may shed His  grace upon you, that you may leave a favorable remembrance in the hearts  and on the lips of those to come. \"And grant that I be spoken of with  honor by posterity.\"(75)    Happy the soul that shall forget his own good, and like the chosen ones of  God, vie with his fellows in service to the good of all; until,  strengthened by the blessings and perpetual confirmations of God, he shall  be empowered to raise this mighty nation up to its ancient pinnacles of  glory, and restore this withered land to sweet new life, and as a  spiritual springtime, array those trees which are the lives of men with  the fresh leaves, the blossoms and fruits of consecrated joy.

If we permit of more or less scientific guessing in achieving a        solution, algebra may be said to have been known nearly 2000 years        B.C., and it had probably attracted the attention of the        intellectual class much earlier...

They follow superstitions inherited from their  fathers and ancestors. To such an extent has this prevailed that they have  taken away the heavenly light of divine truth and sit in the darkness of  imitations and imaginations. That which was meant to be conducive to life  has become the cause of death; that which should have been an evidence of  knowledge is now a proof of ignorance; that which was a factor in the  sublimity of human nature has proved to be its degradation. Therefore the  realm of the religionist has gradually narrowed and darkened and the  sphere of the materialist has widened and advanced; for the religionist  has held to imitation and counterfeit, neglecting and discarding holiness  and the sacred reality of religion. When the sun sets it is the time for  bats to fly. They come forth because they are creatures of the night. When  the lights of religion become darkened the materialists appear. They are  the bats of night. The decline of religion is their time of activity; they  seek the shadows when the world is darkened and clouds have spread over  it.            THE NEED OF DIVINE EDUCATION      In the books of the prophets certain glad-tidings are recorded which are  absolutely true and free from doubt. The East has ever been the  dawning-point of the Sun of Reality. All the prophets of God have appeared  there. The religions of God have been promulgated, the teachings of God  have been spread and the law of God founded in the East. The Orient has  always been the center of lights. The West has acquired illumination from  the East but in some respects the reflection of the light has been greater  in the Occident. This is especially true of Christianity. His Holiness  Christ appeared in Palestine and his teachings were founded there.  Although the doors of the Kingdom were opened in that country and the  bestowals of divinity were spread broadcast from its center, the people of  the West have embraced and promulgated Christianity more fully than those  in the East. The Sun of Reality shone forth from the horizon of the East  but its heat and ray are most resplendent in the West where the radiant  standard of His Holiness Christ has been upraised. I have great hopes that  the lights of Baha'u'llah's appearance may also find the fullest  manifestation and reflection in these western regions; for the teachings  of Baha'u'llah are especially applicable to the conditions of the people  here. The western nations are endowed with the capability of understanding  the rational and peerless words of Baha'u'llah and realizing that the  essence of the teachings of all the former prophets can be found in his  utterance.    The teachings of His Holiness Christ have been promulgated by His Holiness  Baha'u'llah who has also revealed new teachings applicable to present  conditions in the world of humanity. He has trained the people of the East  through the power and protection of the Holy Spirit, cemented the souls of  humanity together and established the foundations of international unity.    Through the power of his words the hearts of the people of all religions  have been attuned in harmony. For instance, among the Baha'is in Persia  there are Christians, Mohammedans, Zoroastrians, Jews and many others of  varying denominations and beliefs who have been brought together in unity  and love in the cause of Baha'u'llah. Although these people were formerly  hostile and antagonistic, filled with hatred and bitterness toward each  other, blood-thirsty and pillaging, considering that animosity and attack  were the means of attaining the good-pleasure of God, they have now become  loving and filled with the radiant zeal of fellowship and brotherhood, the  purpose of them all being service to the world of humanity, promotion of  international peace, the unification of the divine religions and deeds of  universal philanthropy. By their words and actions they are proving the  verity of His Holiness Baha'u'llah.    Consider the animosity and hatred existing today between the various  nations of the world. What disagreements and hostilities arise, what  warfare and contention, how much bloodshed, what injustice and tyranny!  Just now there is war in eastern Turkey, also war between Turkey and  Italy. Nations are devoted to conquest and bloodshed, filled with the  animus of religious hatred, seeking the good-pleasure of God by killing  and destroying those whom they consider enemies in their blindness. How  ignorant they are! That which is forbidden by God they consider acceptable  to Him. God is love; God seeketh fellowship, purity, sanctity and  long-suffering; these are the attributes of divinity. Therefore these  warring, raging nations have arisen against divinity, imagining they are  serving God. What gross ignorance this is! What injustice, blindness and  lack of realization! Briefly; we must strive with heart and soul in order  that this darkness of the contingent world may be dispelled, that the  lights of the Kingdom shall shine upon all the horizons, the world of  humanity become illumined, the image of God become apparent in human  mirrors, the law of God be well established and that all regions of the  world shall enjoy peace, comfort and composure beneath the equitable  protection of God. My admonition and exhortation to you is this: Be kind  to all people, love humanity, consider all mankind as your relations and  servants of the most high God. Strive day and night that animosity and  contention may pass away from the hearts of men, that all religions shall  become reconciled and the nations love each other, so that no racial,  religious or political prejudice may remain and the world of humanity  behold God as the beginning and end of all existence. God has created all  and all return to God. Therefore love humanity with all your heart and  soul. If you meet a poor man, assist him; if you see the sick, heal him;  reassure the affrighted one, render the cowardly noble and courageous,  educate the ignorant, associate with the stranger. Emulate God. Consider  how kindly, how lovingly He deals with all and follow His example. You  must treat people in accordance with the divine precepts; in other words,  treat them as kindly as God treats them, for this is the greatest  attainment possible for the world of humanity.    Furthermore, know ye that God has created in man the power of reason  whereby man is enabled to investigate reality. God has not intended man to  blindly imitate his fathers and ancestors. He has endowed him with mind or  the faculty of reasoning by the exercise of which he is to investigate and  discover the truth; and that which he finds real and true, he must accept.  He must not be an imitator or blind follower of any soul. He must not rely  implicitly upon the opinion of any man without investigation; nay, each  soul must seek intelligently and independently, arriving at a real  conclusion and bound only by that reality. The greatest cause of  bereavement and disheartening in the world of humanity is ignorance based  upon blind imitation. It is due to this that wars and battles prevail;  from this cause hatred and animosity arise continually among mankind.  Through failure to investigate reality the Jews rejected His Holiness  Jesus Christ. They were expecting his coming; by day and night they  mourned and lamented, saying, \"O God! hasten thou the day of the advent of  Christ,\" expressing most intense longing for the Messiah but when His  Holiness Christ appeared they denied and rejected him, treated him with  arrogant contempt, sentenced him to death and finally crucified him. Why  did this happen? Because they were blindly following imitations, believing  that which had descended to them as a heritage from their fathers and  ancestors; tenaciously holding to it and refusing to investigate the  reality of Christ. Therefore they were deprived of the bounties of His  Holiness whereas if they had forsaken imitations and investigated the  reality of the Messiah they would have surely been guided to believing in  him. Instead of this, they said, \"We have heard from our fathers and have  read in the old testament that His Holiness Christ must come from an  unknown place; now we find that this one has come from Nazareth.\" Steeped  in the literal interpretation and imitating the beliefs of fathers and  ancestors they failed to understand the fact that although the body of  Jesus came from Nazareth, the reality of the Christ came from the unknown  place of the divine Kingdom. They also said that the sceptre of His  Holiness Christ would be of iron, that is to say he should wield a sword.  When His Holiness Christ appeared, he did possess a sword but it was the  sword of his tongue with which he separated the false from the true; but  the Jews were blind to the spiritual significance and symbolism of the  prophetic words. They also expected that the Messiah would sit upon the  throne of David whereas His Holiness the Christ had neither throne nor  semblance of sovereignty; nay, rather, he was a poor man, apparently  abject and vanquished; therefore how could he be the veritable Christ?  This was one of their most insistent objections based upon ancestral  interpretation and teaching. In reality His Holiness Christ was glorified  with an eternal sovereignty and everlasting dominion, spiritual and not  temporal. His throne and kingdom were established in human hearts where he  reigns with power and authority without end. Notwithstanding the  fulfillment of all the prophetic signs in His Holiness, the Jews denied  him and entered the period of their deprivation because of their  allegiance to imitations and ancestral forms.    Among other objections, they said, \"We are promised through the tongue of  the prophets that His Holiness Christ at the time of his coming would  proclaim the law of the "]]]
