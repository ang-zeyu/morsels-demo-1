The battle was bloody; but though the Danes  lost great numbers, they maintained the post which they had taken, and  thence made good their retreat to their ships.[*****]         [* Ypod. Neust. p. 414.]         [** Chron. Sax. p. 64.]         [*** Chron. Sax. p. 66. Alured. Beveri. p. 108.]         [**** Chron. Sax. p. 72]         [***** Chiron. Sax. p. 72. Ethelwerd,lib. iii.       cap. 2.]    Having learned, by experience, that they must expect a vigorous  resistance from this warlike prince, they entered into an alliance with  the Britons of Cornwall; and, landing two years after in that country,  made an inroad with their confederates into the county of Devon, but  were met at Hengesdown by Egbert, and totally defeated.[*] While England  remained in this state of anxiety, and defended itself more by temporary  expedients than by any regular plan of administration, Egbert, who alone  was able to provide effectually against this new evil, unfortunately  died, and left the government to his son Ethelwolf.         [* Chron. Sax. p. 72.]          ETHELWOLF.    This prince had neither the abilities nor the vigor of his father, and  was better qualified for governing a convent than a kingdom.[*] He began  his reign with making a partition of his dominions, and delivering over  to his eldest son, Athelstan, the new-conquered provinces of Essex,  Kent, and Sussex. But no inconveniences seem to have arisen from this  partition as the continual terror of the Danish invasions prevented  all domestic dissension. A fleet of these ravagers, consisting of  thirty-three sail, appeared at Southampton, but were repulsed with loss  by Wolfhere, governor of the neighboring country.[**] The same year,  AEthelhelm, governor of Dorsetshire, routed another band, which had  disembarked at Portsmouth; but he obtained the victory after a furious  engagement, and he bought it with the loss of his life.[***]         [* W. Malms, lib. ii. cap 2.]         [** Chron. Sax. p. 73. Ethelwerd, lib. iii. cap.       3.]         [*** Chron. Sax. p. 73. H. Hunting, lib. v.]    Next year, the Danes made several inroads into England, and fought  battles, or rather skirmishes, in East Anglia and Lindesey and Kent;  where, though they were sometimes repulsed and defeated, they always  obtained their end, of committing spoil upon the country, and carrying  off their booty. They avoided coming to a general engagement, which was  not suited to their plan of operations. Their vessels were small, and  ran easily up the creeks and rivers, where they drew them ashore, and,  having formed an intrenchment round them, which they guarded with part  of their number, the remainder scattered themselves every where, and  carrying off the inhabitants, and cattle, and goods, they hastened  to their ships, and quickly disappeared. If the military force of the  county were assembled, (for there was no time for troops to march from  a distance,) the Danes either were able to repulse them, and to continue  their ravages with impunity, or they betook themselves to their vessels,  and, setting sail, suddenly invaded some distant quarter, which was not  prepared for their reception.    Every part of England was held in continual alarm; and the inhabitants  of one county durst not give assistance to those of another, lest their  own families and property should in the mean time be exposed by their  absence to the fury of these barbarous ravagers.[*]    [* Alured. Beverl. p. 108.]    All orders of men were involved in this calamity; and the priests and  monks, who had been commonly spared in the domestic quarrels of  the Heptarchy, were the chief objects on which the Danish idolaters  exercised their rage and animosity. Every season of the year was  dangerous, and the absence of the enemy was no reason why any man could  esteem himself a moment in safety.    These incursions had now become almost annual; when the Danes,  encouraged by their successes against France as well as England, (for  both kingdoms were alike exposed to this dreadful calamity,) invaded  the last in so numerous a body as seemed to threaten it with universal  subjection. But the English, more military than the Britons, whom a few  centuries before they had treated with like violence, roused themselves  with a vigor proportioned to the exigency. Ceorle, governor of  Devonshire, fought a battle with one body of the Danes at Wiganburgh,[*]  and put them to rout with great slaughter.         [* H. Hunting, lib. v. Ethelwerd, lib. iii. cap 3.       Sim. Dunelm. p. 120.]    King Athelstan attacked another at sea, near Sandwich, sunk nine of  their ships, and put the rest to flight.[*]         [* Chron. Sax. p. 74. Asser. p. 2.]    A body of them, however, ventured, for the first time, to take up winter  quarters in England; and receiving in the spring a strong reenforcement  of their countrymen, in three hundred and fifty vessels, they advanced  from the Isle of Thanet, where they had stationed themselves, burnt the  cities of London and Canterbury, and having put to flight Brichtric, who  now governed Mercia under the title of king, they marched into the heart  of Surrey, and laid every place waste around them. Ethelwolf, impelled  by the urgency of the danger, marched against them at the head of the  West Saxons; and, carrying with him his second son, Ethelbald, gave them  battle at Okely, and gained a bloody victory over them. This advantage  procured but a short respite to the English. The Danes still maintained  their settlement in the Isle of Thanet; and, being attacked by Ealher  and Huda, governors of Kent and Surrey, though defeated in the beginning  of the action, they finally repulsed the assailants, and killed both  the governors, removed thence to the Isle of Shepey, where they took up  their winter quarters, that they might farther extend their devastation  and ravages.      This unsettled state of England hindered not Ethelwolf from making a  pilgrimage to Rome, whither he carried his fourth and favorite son,  Alfred, then only six years of age.[*] He passed there a twelvemonth  in exercises of devotion; and failed not in that most essential part of  devotion, liberality to the church of Rome. Besides giving presents to  the more distinguished ecclesiastics, he made a perpetual grant of three  hundred mancuses[**] a year to that see; one third to support the  lamps of St. Peter's, another those of St. Paul's, a third to the pope  himself.[***] In his return home, he married Judith, daughter of the  emperor Charles the Bald; but, on his landing in England, he met with an  opposition which he little looked for.      His eldest son, Athelstan, being dead, Ethelbald, his second, who had  assumed the government, formed, in concert with many of the nobles, the  project of excluding his father from a throne which his weakness and  superstition seem to have rendered him so ill qualified to fill. The  people were divided between the two princes, and a bloody civil war,  joined to all the other calamities under which the English labored,  appeared inevitable, when Ethelwolf had the facility to yield to the  greater part of his son's pretensions. He made with him a partition of  the kingdom; and, taking to himself the eastern part, which was always,  at that time, esteemed the least considerable, as well as the most  exposed,[****] he delivered over to Ethelbald the sovereignty of the  western. Immediately after, he summoned the states of the whole kingdom,  and with the same facility conferred a perpetual and important donation  on the church.         [* Asser. p. 2. Chron. Sax. 76. H. Hunting, lib.       v.]         [** A mancus was about the weight of our present       half crown. See Spelman's Glossary, in verbo Mancus.]         [*** W. Malms, lib. ii. cap. 2.]         [**** Asser. p. 3. W. Malms, lib. ii. cap. 2. M.       West. p. 7, 8.]    The ecclesiastics, in those days of ignorance, made rapid advances in  the acquisition of power and grandeur; and, inculcating the most absurd  and most interested doctrines, though they sometimes met, from the  contrary interests of the laity, with an opposition which it required  time and address to overcome, they found no obstacle in their reason or  understanding. Not content with the donations of land made them by the  Saxon princes and nobles, and with temporary oblations from the devotion  of the people, they had cast a wishful eye on a vast revenue, which they  claimed as belonging to them by a sacred and indefeasible title. However  little versed in the Scriptures, they had been able to discover that,  under the Jewish law, a tenth of all the produce of land was conferred  on the priesthood; and, forgetting what they themselves taught, that the  moral part only of that law was obligatory on Christians, they insisted  that this donation conveyed a perpetual property, inherent by divine  right in those who officiated at the altar. During some centuries, the  whole scope of sermons and homilies was directed to this purpose; and  one would have imagined, from the general tenor of these discourses,  that all the practical parts of Christianity were comprised in the exact  and faithful payment of tithes to the clergy.[*] Encouraged by their  success in inculcating these doctrines, they ventured farther than they  were warranted even by the Levitical law, and pretended to draw the  tenth of all industry, merchandise, wages of laborers, and pay of  soldiers;[**] nay, some canonists went so far as to affirm that the  clergy were entitled to the tithe of the profits made by courtesans  in the exercise of their profession.[***] Though parishes had been  instituted in England by Honorius, archbishop of Canterbury, near two  centuries before,[****] the ecclesiastics had never yet been able to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19212"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part B. (#17)"],[1,"est; at least, if we may judge of the increase of money  by the price of corn. The medium between the highest and lowest prices  of wheat, assigned by the statute, is four shillings and threepence a  quarter; that is, twelve shillings and ninepence of our present money.  This is near half of the middling price in our time. Yet the middling  price of cattle, so late as the reign of King Richard, we find to be  above eight, near ten times lower than the present. Is not this the true  inference, from comparing these facts, that, in all uncivilized nations,  cattle, which propagate of themselves, bear always a lower price than  corn, which requires more art and stock to render it plentiful than  those nations are possessed of? It is to be remarked, that Henry's  assize of corn was copied from a preceding assize established by King  John; consequently, the prices which we have here compared of corn and  cattle may be looked on as contemporary; and they were drawn, not from  one particular year, but from an estimation of the middling prices for  a series of years. It is true, the prices assigned by the assize of  Richard were meant as a standard for the accompts of sheriffs and  escheators and as considerable profits were allowed to these ministers,  we may naturally suppose that the common value of cattle was somewhat  higher: yet still, so great a difference between the prices of corn and  cattle as that of four to one, compared to the present rates, affords  important reflections concerning the very different state of industry  and tillage in the two periods.    Interest had in that age mounted to an enormous height, as might  be expected from the barbarism of the times and men's ignorance of  commerce. Instances occur of fifty per cent. paid for money.[*] There  is an edict of Philip Augustus, near this period, limiting the Jews in  France to forty-eight per cent.[**] Such profits tempted the Jews to  remain in the kingdom, notwithstanding the grievous oppressions to  which, from the prevalent bigotry and rapine of the age, they were  continually exposed. It is easy to imagine how precarious their state  must have been under an indigent prince, somewhat restrained in his  tyranny over his native subjects, but who possessed an unlimited  authority over the Jews, the sole proprietors of money in the kingdom,  and hated on account of their riches, their religion, and their usury;  yet will our ideas scarcely come up to the extortions which in fact we  find to have been practised upon them. In the year 1241, twenty thousand  marks were exacted from them;[***] two years after money was again  extorted; and one Jew alone, Aaron of York, was obliged to pay above  four thousand marks;[****] in 1250, Henry renewed his oppressions; and  the same Aaron was condemned to pay him thirty thousand marks upon an  accusation of forgery;[*****] the high penalty imposed upon him, and  which, it seems, he was thought able to pay, is rather a presumption of  his innocence than of his guilt.         * M. Paris, p. 586.         ** Brussel, Traite des Fiefs, vol. i, p. 576.         *** M. Paris, p. 372.         **** M. Paris, p. 410.         ***** M. Paris, p. 525.    In 1255, the king demanded eight thousand marks from the Jews, and  threatened to hang them if they refused compliance. They now lost all  patience, and desired leave to retire with their effects out of the  kingdom. But the king replied, \"How can I remedy the oppressions you  complain of? I am myself a beggar. I am spoiled, I am stripped of all  my revenues; I owe above two hundred thousand marks; and if I had said  three hundred thousand, I should not exceed the truth; I am obliged to  pay my son, Prince Edward, fifteen thousand marks a year; I have not a  farthing; and I must have money from any hand, from any quarter, or by  any means.\" He then delivered over the Jews to the earl of Cornwall,  that those whom the one brother had flayed, the other might embowel, to  make use of the words of the historian.[*] King John, his father, once  demanded ten thousand marks from a Jew of Bristol; and on his refusal,  ordered one of his teeth to be drawn every day till he should comply.  The Jew lost seven teeth, and then paid the sum required of him.[**]  One talliage laid upon the Jews, in 1243, amounted to sixty thousand  marks;[***] a sum equal to the whole yearly revenue of the crown.    To give a better pretence for extortions, the improbable and absurd  accusation, which has been at different times advanced against that  nation, was revived in England, that they had crucified a child in  derision of the sufferings of Christ. Eighteen of them were hanged at  once for this crime;[****] though it is nowise credible that even the  antipathy borne them by the Christians, and the oppressions under which  they labored, would ever have pushed them to be guilty of that dangerous  enormity. But it is natural to imagine, that a race exposed to such  insults and indignities, both from king and people, and who had so  uncertain an enjoyment of their riches, would carry usury to the utmost  extremity, and by their great profits make themselves some compensation  for their continual perils.    Though these acts of violence against the Jews proceeded much from  bigotry, they were still more derived from avidity and rapine. So far  from desiring in that age to convert them, it was enacted by law in  France, that if any Jew embraced Christianity, he forfeited all his  goods, without exception, to the king or his superior lord. These  plunderers were careful lest the profits accruing from their dominion  over that unhappy race should be diminished by their conversion.[*****]    Commerce must be in a wretched condition where interest was so high, and  where the sole proprietors of money employed it in usury only, and  were exposed to such extortion and injustice. But the bad police of  the country was another obstacle to improvements, and rendered all  communication dangerous, and all property precarious. The Chronicle of  Dunstable says,[******] that men were never secure in their houses, and  that whole villages were often plundered by bands of robbers, though no  civil wars at that time prevailed in the kingdom.         *M. Paris, p. 606.         **M. Paris, p. 160.         ***Madox, p. 152.         ****M. Paris, p. 613.         *****Brussel, vol. i. p. 622. Du Cange, verbo Judaei.         ******Vol. i. p. 155.    In 1249, some years before the insurrection of the barons, two merchants  of Brabant came to the king at Winchester, and told him that they had  been spoiled of all their goods by certain robbers, whom they knew,  because they saw their faces every day in his court; that like practices  prevailed all over England, and travellers were continually exposed to  the danger of being robbed, bound, wounded, and murdered; that  these crimes escaped with impunity, because the ministers of justice  themselves were in a confederacy with the robbers; and that they, for  their part, instead of bringing matters to a fruitless trial by law,  were willing, though merchants, to decide their cause with the robbers  by arms and a duel. The king, provoked at these abuses, ordered a jury  to be enclosed, and to try the robbers: the jury, though consisting  of twelve men of property in Hampshire, were found to be also in a  confederacy with the felons, and acquitted them. Henry, in a rage,  committed the jury to prison, threatened them with severe punishment,  and ordered a new jury to be enclosed, who, dreading the fate of their  fellows, at last found a verdict against the criminals. Many of the  king's own household were discovered to have participated in the guilt;  and they said for their excuse, that they received no wages from him,  and were obliged to rob for a maintenance.[*] \"Knights and esquires,\"  says the Dictum of Kenilworth, \"Who were robbers, if they have no land,  shall pay the half of their goods, and find sufficient security to  keep henceforth the peace of the kingdom.\" Such were the manners of the  times!    One can the less repine, during the prevalence of such manners, at the  frauds and forgeries of the clergy; as it gives less disturbance to  society to take men's money from them with their own consent, though by  deceits and lies, than to ravish it by open force and violence. During  this reign the papal power was at its summit, and was even beginning  insensibly to decline, by reason of the immeasurable avarice and  extortions of the court of Rome, which disgusted the clergy as well as  laity in every kingdom of Europe. England itself, though sunk in the  deepest abyss of ignorance and superstition, had seriously entertained  thoughts of shaking off the papal yoke;[**] and the Roman pontiff was  obliged to think of new expedients for rivetting it faster upon the  Christian world.         * M. Paris, p. 509.         ** M. Paris, p. 421.    For this purpose, Gregory IX. published his decretals,[*] which are a  collection of forgeries favorable to the court of Rome, and consist  of the supposed decrees of popes in the first centuries. But these  forgeries are so gross, and confound so palpably all language, history,  chronology, and antiquities,--matters more stubborn than any speculative  truths whatsoever,--that even that church, which is not startled at  the most monstrous contradictions and absurdities, has been obliged to  abandon them to the critics. But in the dark period of the thirteenth  century, they parsed for undisputed and authentic; and men, entangled  in the mazes of this false literature, joined to the philosophy, equally  false, of the times, had nothing wherewithal to defend themselves, but  some small remains of common sense, which passed for profaneness and  impiety, and the indelible regard to self-interest, which, as it was the  sole motive in the priests for framing these impostures, served also, in  some degree, to protect the laity against them.
