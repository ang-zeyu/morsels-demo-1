Some of them showed an  independence of spirit not at all agreeing with popular ideas of the  demure maid of olden days. Sarah Hall, for instance, whose parents lived  in Barbadoes, was sent to her grandmother, Madam Coleman of Boston, to  attend school. She arrived with her maid in 1719 and soon scandalized  her stately grandmother by abruptly leaving the house and engaging board  and lodging at a neighboring residence. At her brother's command she  returned; but even a brother's authority failed to control the spirited  young lady; for a few months after the episode Madam Coleman wrote:  \"Sally won't go to school nor to church and wants a nue muff and a great  many other things she don't need. I tell her fine things are cheaper in  Barbadoes. She says she will go to Barbadoes in the Spring. She is well  and brisk, says her Brother has nothing to do with her as long as her  father is alive.\" The same lady informs us that Sally's instruction in  writing cost one pound, seven shillings, and four pence, the entrance  fee for dancing lessons, one pound, and the bill for dancing lessons for  four months, two pounds. No doubt it was worth the price; for later  Sally became rather a dashing society belle.    One thing always emphasized in the training of the colonial girl was  manners or etiquette--the art of being a charming hostess. As Mrs. Earle  says, \"It is impossible to overestimate the value these laws of  etiquette, these conventions of custom had at a time, when neighborhood  life was the whole outside world.\" How many, many a \"don't\" the colonial  miss had dinned into her ears! Hear but a few of them: \"Never sit down  at the table till asked, and after the blessing. Ask for nothing; tarry  till it be offered thee. Speak not. Bite not thy bread but break it.  Take salt only with a clean knife. Dip not the meat in the same. Hold  not thy knife upright but sloping, and lay it down at the right hand of  plate with blade on plate. Look not earnestly at any other that is  eating. When moderately satisfied leave the table. Sing not, hum not,  wriggle not.... Smell not of thy Meat; make not a noise with thy Tongue,  Mouth, Lips, or Breath in Thy Eating and Drinking.... When any speak to  thee, stand up. Say not I have heard it before. Never endeavour to help  him out if he tell it not right. Snigger not; never question the Truth  of it.\"    Girls were early taught these forms, and in addition received not only  advice but mechanical aid to insure their standing erect and sitting  upright. The average child of to-day would rebel most vigorously against  such contrivances, and justly; for in a few American schools, as in  English institutions, young ladies were literally tortured through  sitting in stocks, being strapped to backboards, and wearing stiffened  coats and stays re-inforced with strips of wood and metal. Such methods  undoubtedly made the colonial dame erect and perhaps stately in  appearance, but they contributed a certain artificial, thin-chested  structure that the healthy girl of to-day would abhor.    As we have seen, however, some women of the day contrived to pick up  unusual bits of knowledge, or made surprising expeditions into the realm  of literature and philosophy. Samuel Peters, writing in his _General  History of Connecticut_ in 1781, declared of their accomplishments:  \"The women of Connecticut are strictly virtuous and to be compared to  the prude rather than the European polite lady. They are not permitted  to read plays; cannot converse about whist, quadrille or operas; but  will freely talk upon the subjects of history, geography, and  mathematics. They are great casuists and polemical divines; and I have  known not a few of them so well schooled in Greek and Latin as often to  put to the blush learned gentlemen.\" And yet Hannah Adams, writing in  her _Memoir_ in 1832, had this to say of educational opportunities in  Connecticut during the latter half of the eighteenth century: \"My health  did not even admit of attending school with the children in the  neighborhood where I resided. The country schools, at that time, were  kept but a few months in the year, and all that was then taught in them  was reading, writing, and arithmetic. In the summer, the children were  instructed by females in reading, sewing, and other kinds of work. The  books chiefly made use of were the Bible and Psalter. Those who have had  the advantages of receiving the rudiments of their education at the  schools of the present day, can scarcely form an adequate idea of the  contrast between them, and those of an earlier age; and of the great  improvements which have been made even in the common country schools.  The disadvantages of my early education I have experienced during life;  and, among various others, the acquiring of a very faulty pronunciation;  a habit contracted so early, that I cannot wholly rectify it in later  years.\"    North and South women complained of the lack of educational advantages.  Madame Schuyler deplored the scarcity of books and of facilities for  womanly education, and spoke with irony of the literary tastes of the  older ladies: \"Shakespeare was a questionable author at the Flatts,  where the plays were considered grossly familiar, and by no means to be  compared to 'Cato' which Madame Schuyler greatly admired. The 'Essay on  Man' was also in high esteem with this lady.\"[73] Many women of the day  realized their lack of systematic training, and keenly regretted the  absence of opportunity to obtain it. Abigail Adams, writing to her  husband on the subject, says, \"If you complain of education in sons what  shall I say of daughters who every day experience the want of it? With  regard to the education of my own children I feel myself soon out of my  depth, destitute in every part of education. I most sincerely wish that  some more liberal plan might be laid and executed for the benefit of the  rising generation and that our new Constitution may be distinguished for  encouraging learning and virtue. If we mean to have heroes, statesmen,  and philosophers, we should have learned women. The world perhaps would  laugh at me, but you, I know, have a mind too enlarged and liberal to  disregard sentiment. If as much depends as is allowed upon the early  education of youth and the first principles which are instilled take the  deepest root great benefit must arise from the literary accomplishments  in women.\"[74]    And again, Hannah Adams' _Memoir_ of 1832 expresses in the following  words the intellectual hunger of the Colonial woman: \"I was very  desirous of learning the rudiments of Latin, Greek, geography, and  logic. Some gentlemen who boarded at my father's offered to instruct me  in these branches of learning gratis, and I pursued these studies with  indescribable pleasure and avidity. I still, however, sensibly felt the  want of a more systematic education, and those advantages which females  enjoy in the present day.... My reading was very desultory, and novels  engaged too much of my attention.\"    After all, it would seem that fancy sewing was considered far more  requisite than science and literature in the training of American girls  of the eighteenth century. As soon as the little maid was able to hold a  needle she was taught to knit, and at the age of four or five commonly  made excellent mittens and stockings. A girl of fourteen made in 1760 a  pair of silk stockings with open work design and with initials knitted  on the instep, and every stage of the work from the raising and winding  of the silk to the designing and spinning was done by one so young.  Girls began to make samplers almost before they could read their  letters, and wonderful were the birds and animals and scenes depicted in  embroidery by mere children. An advertisement of the day is significant  of the admiration held for such a form of decorative work: \"Martha  Gazley, late from Great Britain, now in the city of New York Makes and  Teacheth the following curious Works, viz.: Artificial Fruit and Flowers  and other Wax-works, Nuns-work, Philigre and Pencil Work upon Muslin,  all sorts of Needle-Work, and Raising of Paste, as also to paint upon  Glass, and Transparant for Sconces, with other Works. If any young  Gentlewomen, or others are inclined to learn any or all of the  above-mentioned curious Works, they may be carefully instructed in the  same by said Martha Gazley.\"    Thus the evidence leads us to believe that a colonial woman's education  consisted in the main of training in how to conduct and care for a home.  It was her principal business in life and for it she certainly was well  prepared. In the seventeenth century girls attended either a short term  public school or a dame's school, or, as among the better families in  the South, were taught by private tutors. In the eighteenth century they  frequently attended boarding schools or female seminaries, and here  learned--at least in the middle colonies and the South--not only reading  and writing and arithmetic, but dancing, music, drawing, French, and  \"manners.\" In Virginia and New York, as we have seen, illiteracy among  seventeenth century women was astonishingly common; but in the  eighteenth century those above the lowest classes in all three sections  could at least read, write, and keep accounts, and some few had dared to  reach out into the sphere of higher learning. That many realized their  intellectual poverty and deplored it is evident; how many more who kept  no diaries and left no letters hungered for culture we shall never know;  but the very longing of these colonial women is probably one of the main  causes of that remarkable movement for the higher education of American  women so noticeable in the earlier years of the nineteenth century.  Their smothered ambition undoubtedly gave birth to an intellectual  advance of women"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15489"],[0,"Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners (#17)"],[1,"marriage,  the former are often put for the latter in the dream, and as far as  practicable the sexual presentation complex is transposed to the eating  complex. Of articles of dress the woman's hat may frequently be  definitely interpreted as the male genital. In dreams of men one often  finds the cravat as a symbol for the penis; this indeed is not only  because cravats hang down long, and are characteristic of the man, but  also because one can select them at pleasure, a freedom which is  prohibited by nature in the original of the symbol. Persons who make use  of this symbol in the dream are very extravagant with cravats, and  possess regular collections of them. All complicated machines and  apparatus in dream are very probably genitals, in the description of  which dream symbolism shows itself to be as tireless as the activity of  wit. Likewise many landscapes in dreams, especially with bridges or with  wooded mountains, can be readily recognized as descriptions of the  genitals. Finally where one finds incomprehensible neologisms one may  think of combinations made up of components having a sexual  significance. Children also in the dream often signify the genitals, as  men and women are in the habit of fondly referring to their genital  organ as their \"little one.\" As a very recent symbol of the male genital  may be mentioned the flying machine, utilization of which is justified  by its relation to flying as well as occasionally by its form. To play  with a little child or to beat a little one is often the dream's  representation of onanism. A number of other symbols, in part not  sufficiently verified are given by Stekel, who illustrates them with  examples. Right and left, according to him, are to be conceived in the  dream in an ethical sense. \"The right way always signifies the road to  righteousness, the left the one to crime. Thus the left may signify  homosexuality, incest, and perversion, while the right signifies  marriage, relations with a prostitute, &c. The meaning is always  determined by the individual moral view-point of the dreamer.\" Relatives  in the dream generally play the role of genitals. Not to be able to  catch up with a wagon is interpreted by Stekel as regret not to be able  to come up to a difference in age. Baggage with which one travels is the  burden of sin by which one is oppressed. Also numbers, which frequently  occur in the dream, are assigned by Stekel a fixed symbolical meaning,  but these interpretations seem neither sufficiently verified nor of  general validity, although the interpretation in individual cases can  generally be recognized as probable. In a recently published book by W.  Stekel, _Die Sprache des Traumes_, which I was unable to utilize, there  is a list of the most common sexual symbols, the object of which is to  prove that all sexual symbols can be bisexually used. He states: \"Is  there a symbol which (if in any way permitted by the phantasy) may not  be used simultaneously in the masculine and the feminine sense!\" To be  sure the clause in parentheses takes away much of the absoluteness of  this assertion, for this is not at all permitted by the phantasy. I do  not, however, think it superfluous to state that in my experience  Stekel's general statement has to give way to the recognition of a  greater manifoldness. Besides those symbols, which are just as frequent  for the male as for the female genitals, there are others which  preponderately, or almost exclusively, designate one of the sexes, and  there are still others of which only the male or only the female  signification is known. To use long, firm objects and weapons as symbols  of the female genitals, or hollow objects (chests, pouches, &c.), as  symbols of the male genitals, is indeed not allowed by the fancy.    It is true that the tendency of the dream and the unconscious fancy to  utilize the sexual symbol bisexually betrays an archaic trend, for in  childhood a difference in the genitals is unknown, and the same genitals  are attributed to both sexes.    These very incomplete suggestions may suffice to stimulate others to  make a more careful collection.    I shall now add a few examples of the application of such symbolisms in  dreams, which will serve to show how impossible it becomes to interpret  a dream without taking into account the symbolism of dreams, and how  imperatively it obtrudes itself in many cases.      1. The hat as a symbol of the man (of the male genital): (a fragment  from the dream of a young woman who suffered from agoraphobia on account  of a fear of temptation).    \"I am walking in the street in summer, I wear a straw hat of peculiar  shape, the middle piece of which is bent upwards and the side pieces of  which hang downwards (the description became here obstructed), and in  such a fashion that one is lower than the other. I am cheerful and in a  confidential mood, and as I pass a troop of young officers I think to  myself: None of you can have any designs upon me.\"    As she could produce no associations to the hat, I said to her: \"The hat  is really a male genital, with its raised middle piece and the two  downward hanging side pieces.\" I intentionally refrained from  interpreting those details concerning the unequal downward hanging of  the two side pieces, although just such individualities in the  determinations lead the way to the interpretation. I continued by saying  that if she only had a man with such a virile genital she would not have  to fear the officers--that is, she would have nothing to wish from them,  for she is mainly kept from going without protection and company by her  fancies of temptation. This last explanation of her fear I had already  been able to give her repeatedly on the basis of other material.    It is quite remarkable how the dreamer behaved after this  interpretation. She withdrew her description of the hat, and claimed not  to have said that the two side pieces were hanging downwards. I was,  however, too sure of what I had heard to allow myself to be misled, and  I persisted in it. She was quiet for a while, and then found the courage  to ask why it was that one of her husband's testicles was lower than the  other, and whether it was the same in all men. With this the peculiar  detail of the hat was explained, and the whole interpretation was  accepted by her. The hat symbol was familiar to me long before the  patient related this dream. From other but less transparent cases I  believe that the hat may also be taken as a female genital.      2. The little one as the genital--to be run over as a symbol of sexual  intercourse (another dream of the same agoraphobic patient).    \"Her mother sends away her little daughter so that she must go alone.  She rides with her mother to the railroad and sees her little one  walking directly upon the tracks, so that she cannot avoid being run  over. She hears the bones crackle. (From this she experiences a feeling  of discomfort but no real horror.) She then looks out through the car  window to see whether the parts cannot be seen behind. She then  reproaches her mother for allowing the little one to go out alone.\"  Analysis. It is not an easy matter to give here a complete  interpretation of the dream. It forms part of a cycle of dreams, and can  be fully understood only in connection with the others. For it is not  easy to get the necessary material sufficiently isolated to prove the  symbolism. The patient at first finds that the railroad journey is to be  interpreted historically as an allusion to a departure from a sanatorium  for nervous diseases, with the superintendent of which she naturally was  in love. Her mother took her away from this place, and the physician  came to the railroad station and handed her a bouquet of flowers on  leaving; she felt uncomfortable because her mother witnessed this  homage. Here the mother, therefore, appears as a disturber of her love  affairs, which is the role actually played by this strict woman during  her daughter's girlhood. The next thought referred to the sentence: \"She  then looks to see whether the parts can be seen behind.\" In the dream  facade one would naturally be compelled to think of the parts of the  little daughter run over and ground up. The thought, however, turns in  quite a different direction. She recalls that she once saw her father in  the bath-room naked from behind; she then begins to talk about the sex  differentiation, and asserts that in the man the genitals can be seen  from behind, but in the woman they cannot. In this connection she now  herself offers the interpretation that the little one is the genital,  her little one (she has a four-year-old daughter) her own genital. She  reproaches her mother for wanting her to live as though she had no  genital, and recognizes this reproach in the introductory sentence of  the dream; the mother sends away her little one so that she must go  alone. In her phantasy going alone on the street signifies to have no  man and no sexual relations (coire = to go together), and this she does  not like. According to all her statements she really suffered as a girl  on account of the jealousy of her mother, because she showed a  preference for her father.    The \"little one\" has been noted as a symbol for the male or the female  genitals by Stekel, who can refer in this connection to a very  widespread usage of language.    The deeper interpretation of this dream depends upon another dream of  the same night in which the dreamer identifies herself with her brother.  She was a \"tomboy,\" and was always being told that she should have been  born a boy. This identification with the brother shows with special  clearness that \"the little one\" signifies the genital. The mother  threatened him (her) with castration, which could only be understood as  a punishment for playing with the parts, and the identification,  therefore, shows that she herself had masturbated as a child, though  this"]]]
