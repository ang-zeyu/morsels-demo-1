Nagendra's reply was as follows:--    \"Do not despise me, brother. Yet what is the use of such a petition;  the despicable must be despised. I must effect this marriage. Should  all the world abandon me I must do it, otherwise I shall go mad: I am  not far short of it now. After this there seems nothing more to be  said. You will perceive it is useless to try to turn me from it; but  if you have anything to say I am ready to argue with you. If any one  says that widow-marriage is contrary to religion, I will give him  Vidya Sagar's essay to read. When so learned a teacher affirms that  widow-marriage is approved by the Shastras, who can contradict? And  if you say that though allowed by the Shastras it is not countenanced  by society, that if I carry out this marriage I shall be excluded from  society, the answer is, 'Who in Govindpur can exclude me from society?  In a place where I constitute society, who is there to banish me?'  Nevertheless, for your sakes I will effect the marriage secretly; no  one shall know anything about it. You will not make the foregoing  objections; you will say a double marriage is contrary to morals.  Brother, how do you know that it is opposed to morality? You have  learned this from the English; it was not held so in India formerly.  Are the English infallible? They have taken this idea from the law of  Moses;[14] but we do not hold Moses' law to be the word of God,  therefore why should we say that for a man to marry two wives is  immoral? You will say if a man may marry two wives why should not a  woman have two husbands? The answer is, if a woman had two husbands  certain evils would follow which would not result from a man's having  two wives. If a woman has two husbands the children have no protector;  should there be uncertainty about the father, society would be much  disordered; but no such uncertainty arises when a man has two wives.  Many other such objections might be pointed out. Whatever is injurious  to the many is contrary to morals. If you think a man's having two  wives opposed to morality, point out in what way it is injurious to  the majority. You will instance to me discord in the family. I will  give you a reason: I am childless. If I die my family name will become  extinct; if I marry I may expect children: is this unreasonable? The  final objection--Surja Mukhi: Why do I distress a loving wife with a  rival? The answer is, Surja Mukhi is not troubled by this marriage:  she herself suggested it; she prepared me for it; she is zealous for  it. What objection then remains? and why should I be blamed?\"    [Footnote 14: The writer is mistaken in supposing that the Christian  doctrine of monogamy is derived from the Mosaic law.]    Kamal Mani having read the letter, said--    \"In what respect he is to blame God knows; but what delusions he  cherishes! I think men understand nothing. Be that as it may, arrange  your affairs, husband; we must go to Govindpur.\"    \"But,\" replied Srish, \"can you stop the marriage?\"    \"If not, I will die at my brother's feet.\"    \"Nay, you can't do that; but we may bring the new wife away. Let us  try.\"    Then both prepared for the journey to Govindpur. Early the next day  they started by boat, and arrived there in due time. Before entering  the house they met the women-servants and some neighbours, who had  come to bring Kamal Mani from the _ghat_. Both she and her husband  were extremely anxious to know if the marriage had taken place, but  neither could put a single question. How could they speak to strangers  of such a shameful subject?    Hurriedly Kamal Mani entered the women's apartments; she even forgot  Satish Babu, who remained lingering behind. Indistinctly, and dreading  the answer, she asked the servants--    \"Where is Surja Mukhi?\"    She feared lest they should say the marriage was accomplished, or  that Surja Mukhi was dead. The women replied that their mistress was  in her bed-room. Kamal Mani darted thither. For a minute or two she  searched hither and thither, finding no one. At last she saw a woman  sitting near a window, her head bowed down. Kamal Mani could not see  her face, but she knew it was Surja Mukhi, who, now hearing footsteps,  arose and came forward. Not even yet could Kamal ask if the marriage  had taken place. Surja Mukhi had lost flesh; her figure, formerly  straight as a pine, had become bent like a bow; her laughing eyes were  sunk; her lily face had lost its roundness.    Kamal Mani comprehended that the marriage was accomplished. She  inquired, \"When was it?\"    Surja Mukhi answered, \"Yesterday.\"    Then the two sat down together, neither speaking. Surja Mukhi hid her  face in the other's lap, and wept. Kamal Mani's tears fell on Surja  Mukhi's unbound hair.    Of what was Nagendra thinking at that time as he sat in the _boita  khana_? His thoughts said: \"Kunda Nandini! Kunda is mine; Kunda is my  wife! Kunda! Kunda! she is mine!\"    Srish Chandra sat down beside him, but Nagendra could say little; he  could think only, \"Surja Mukhi herself hastened to give Kunda to me in  marriage; who then can object to my enjoying this happiness?\"          CHAPTER XXI.    SURJA MUKHI AND KAMAL MANI.      When, in the evening, the two gained self-control to talk together,  Surja Mukhi related the affair of the marriage from beginning to end.    Astonished, Kamal Mani said--    \"This marriage has been brought about by your exertions! Why have you  thus sacrificed yourself?\"    Surja Mukhi smiled, a faint smile indeed, like the pale flashes of  lightning after rain; then answered--    \"What am I? Look upon your brother's face, radiant with happiness,  then you will know what joy is his. If I have been able with my own  eyes to see him so happy, has not my life answered its purpose? What  joy could I hope for in denying happiness to him? He for whom I would  die rather than see him unhappy for a single hour; him I saw day and  night suffering anguish, ready to abandon all joys and become a  wanderer--what happiness would have remained to me? I said to him, 'My  lord, your joy is my joy! Do you marry Kunda; I shall be happy.' And  so he married her.\"    \"And are you happy?\" asked Kamal.    \"Why do you still ask about me? what am I? If I had ever seen my  husband hurt his foot by walking on a stony path, I should have  reproached myself that I had not laid my body down over the stones  that he might have stepped upon me.\"    Surja Mukhi remained some moments silent, her dress drenched with her  tears. Suddenly raising her face, she asked--    \"Kamal, in what country are females destroyed at birth?\"    Kamal understanding her thought, replied--    \"What does it matter in what country it happens? it is according to  destiny.\"    \"Whose destiny could be better than mine was? Who so fortunate as  myself? Who ever had such a husband? Beauty, wealth, these are small  matters; but in virtues, whose husband equals mine? Mine was a  splendid destiny; how has it changed thus?\"    \"That also is destiny,\" said Kamal.    \"Then why do I suffer on this account?\"    \"But just now you said you were happy in the sight of your husband's  joyous face; yet you speak of suffering so much. Can both be true?\"    \"Both are true. I am happy in his joy. But that he should thrust me  away; that he has thrust me away, and yet is so glad--\"    Surja could say no more, she was choking. But Kamal, understanding the  meaning of her unfinished sentence, said--    \"Because of that your heart burns within you; then why do you say,  'What am I?' With half of your heart you still think of your own  rights; else why, having sacrificed yourself, do you repent?\"    \"I do not repent,\" replied Surja. \"That I have done right I do not  doubt; but in dying there is suffering. I felt that I must give way,  and I did so voluntarily. Still, may I not weep over that suffering  with you?\"    Kamal Mani drew Surja Mukhi's head on to her breast; their thoughts  were not expressed by words, but they conversed in their hearts. Kamal  Mani understood the wretchedness of Surja Mukhi; Surja Mukhi  comprehended that Kamal appreciated her suffering. They checked their  sobs and ceased to weep.    Surja Mukhi, setting her own affairs on one side, spoke of others,  desired that Satish Babu should be brought, and talked to him. With  Kamal she spoke long of Srish Chandra and of Satish, of the education  of Satish and of his marriage. Thus they talked until far in the  night, when Surja Mukhi embraced Kamal with much affection, and taking  Satish into her lap kissed him lovingly.    When they came to part, Surja Mukhi was again drowned in tears. She  blessed Satish, saying--    \"I wish that thou mayst be rich in the imperishable virtues of thy  mother's brother; I know no greater blessing than this.\"    Surja Mukhi spoke in her natural, gentle voice; nevertheless Kamal was  astonished at its broken accents. \"_Bon!_!\" she exclaimed, \"what is in  your mind? tell me.\"    \"Nothing,\" replied Surja.    \"Do not hide it from me,\" said Kamal.    \"I have nothing to conceal,\" said Surja.    Pacified, Kamal went to her room. But Surja Mukhi had a purpose to  conceal. This Kamal learned in the morning. At dawn she went to Surja  Mukhi's room in search of her; Surja Mukhi was not there, but upon the  undisturbed bed there lay a letter. At the sight of it Kamal became  dizzy; she could not read it. Without doing so she understood all,  understood that Surja Mukhi had fled. She had no desire to read the  letter, but crushed it in her hand. Striking her forehead, she sat  down upon the bed, exclaiming: \"I am a fool! how could I allow myself  to be put off last night when parting from her?\"    Satish Babu, standing near, joined his tears with his mother's.    The first passion of grief having spent itself, Kamal Mani opened and  read the letter. It was addressed to herself, and ran as follows:    \"On the day on which I heard from my husband's mouth that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17461"],[0,"The Great German Composers (#17)"],[1,"of humanity.\"      VI.    Yet beneath these eccentricities what wealth of tenderness, sympathy,  and kindliness existed! His affection for his graceless nephew Karl is a  touching picture. With the rest of his family he had never been on very  cordial terms. His feeling of contempt for snobbery and pretense is very  happily illustrated in his relations with his brother Johann. The latter  had acquired property, and he sent Ludwig his card, inscribed \"Johann  van Beethoven, land-owner.\" The caustic reply was a card, on which  was written, \"Ludwig van Beethoven, brain-owner.\" But on Karl all the  warmest feelings of a nature which had been starving to love and be  loved poured themselves out. He gave the scapegrace every luxury and  indulgence, and, self-absorbed as he was in an ideal sphere, felt the  deepest interest in all the most trivial things that concerned him. Much  to the uncle's sorrow, Karl cared nothing for music; but, worst of  all, he was an idle, selfish, heartless fellow, who sneered at his  benefactor, and valued him only for what he could get from him. At last  Beethoven became fully aware of the lying ingratitude of his nephew, and  he exclaims: \"I know now you have no pleasure in coming to see me, which  is only natural, for my atmosphere is too pure for you. God has never  yet forsaken me, and no doubt some one will be found to close my eyes.\"  Yet the generous old man forgave him, for he says in the codicil of his  will, \"I appoint my nephew Karl my sole heir.\"    Frequently, glimpses of the true vein showed themselves in such little  episodes as that which occurred when Moscheles, accompanied by his  brother, visited the great musician for the first time.    \"Arrived at the door of the house,\" writes Moscheles, \"I had some  misgivings, knowing Beethoven's strong aversion to strangers. I  therefore told my brother to wait below. After greeting Beethoven, I  said: 'Will you permit me to introduce my brother to you?'    \"'Where is he?' he suddenly replied.    \"'Below.'    \"'What, down-stairs?' and Beethoven immediately rushed off, seized hold  of my brother, saying: 'Am I such a savage that you are afraid to come  near me?'    \"After this he showed great kindness to us.\"    While referring to the relations of Moscheles and Beethoven, the  following anecdote related by Mme. Moscheles will be found suggestive.  The pianist had been arranging some numbers of \"Fidelio,\" which he  took to the composer. He, _a la_ Haydn, had inscribed the score with the  words, \"By God's help.\" Beethoven did not fail to perceive this, and he  wrote underneath this phylactory the characteristic advice: \"O man, help  thyself.\"    The genial and sympathetic nature of Beethoven is illustrated in this  quaint incident:    It was in the summer of 1811 that Ludwig Lowe, the actor, first met  Beethoven in the dining-room of the Blue Star at Toplitz. Lowe was  paying his addresses to the landlord's daughter; and conversation being  impossible at the hour he dined there, the charming creature one day  whispered to him: \"Come at a later hour when the customers are gone and  only Beethoven is here. He cannot hear, and will therefore not be in  the way.\" This answered for a time; but the stern parents, observing  the acquaintanceship, ordered the actor to leave the house and not to  return. \"How great was our despair!\" relates Lowe. \"We both desired to  correspond, but through whom? Would the solitary man at the opposite  table assist us? Despite his serious reserve and seeming churlishness,  I believe he is not unfriendly. I have often caught a kind smile across  his bold, defiant face.\" Lowe determined to try. Knowing Beethoven's  custom, he contrived to meet the master when he was walking in the  gardens. Beethoven instantly recognized him, and asked the reason why he  no longer dined at the Blue Star. A full confession was made, and then  Lowe timidly asked if he would take charge of a letter to give to the  girl.    \"Why not?\" pleasantly observed the rough-looking musician. \"You mean  what is right.\"    So pocketing the note, he was making his way onward when Lowe again  interfered.    \"I beg your pardon, Herr van Beethoven, that is not all.\"    \"So, so,\" said the master.    \"You must also bring back the answer,\" Lowe went on to say.    \"Meet me here at this time to-morrow,\" said Beethoven.    Lowe did so, and there found Beethoven awaiting him, with the coveted  reply from his lady-love. In this manner Beethoven carried the letters  backward and forward for some five or six weeks--in short, as long as he  remained in the town.    His friendship with Ferdinand Ries commenced in a way which testified  how grateful he was for kindness. When his mother lay ill at Bonn, he  hurried home from Vienna just in time to witness her death. After the  funeral he suffered greatly from poverty, and was relieved by Ries the  violinist. Years afterward young Ries waited on Beethoven with a letter  of introduction from his father. The composer received him with cordial  warmth, and said: \"Tell your father I have not forgotten the death of  my mother.\" Ever afterward he was a helpful and devoted friend to young  Ries, and was of inestimable value in forwarding his musical career.    Beethoven in his poverty never forgot to be generous. At a concert given  in aid of wounded soldiers, where he conducted, he indignantly refused  payment with the words: \"Say Beethoven never accepts anything where  humanity is concerned.\" To an Ursuline convent he gave an entirely new  symphony to be performed at their benefit concert. Friend or enemy  never applied to him for help that he did not freely give, even to the  pinching of his own comfort.      VII.    Rossini could write best when he was under the influence of Italian wine  and sparkling champagne. Paesiello liked the warm bed in which to jot  down his musical notions, and we are told that \"it was between the  sheets that he planned the 'Barber of Seville,' the 'Molinara,' and so  many other _chefs-d'oeuvre_ of ease and gracefulness.\" Mozart could chat  and play at billiards or bowls at the same time that he composed the  most beautiful music. Sacchini found it impossible to write anything of  any beauty unless a pretty woman was by his side, and he was surrounded  by his cats, whose graceful antics stimulated and affected him in a  marked fashion. \"Gluck,\" Bombet says, \"in order to warm his imagination  and to transport himself to Aulis or Sparta, was accustomed to place  himself in the middle of a beautiful meadow. In this situation, with his  piano before him, and a bottle of champagne on each side, he wrote in  the open air his two 'Iphigenias,' his 'Orpheus,' and some other  works.\" The agencies which stimulated Beethoven's grandest thoughts  are eminently characteristic of the man. He loved to let the winds  and storms beat on his bare head, and see the dazzling play of the  lightning. Or, failing the sublimer moods of Nature, it was his  delight to walk in the woods and fields, and take in at every pore the  influences which she so lavishly bestows on her favorites. His true life  was his ideal life in art. To him it was a mission and an inspiration,  the end and object of all things; for these had value only as they fed  the divine craving within.    \"Nothing can be more sublime,\" he writes, \"than to draw nearer to the  Godhead than other men, and to diffuse here on earth these Godlike rays  among mortals.\" Again: \"What is all this compared to the grandest of all  Masters of Harmony--above, above?\"         \"All experience seemed an arch, wherethrough       Gleamed that untraveled world, whose margin fades       Forever and forever as we move.\"    The last four years of our composer's life were passed amid great  distress from poverty and feebleness. He could compose but little; and,  though his friends solaced his latter days with attention and kindness,  his sturdy independence would not accept more. It is a touching fact  that Beethoven voluntarily suffered want and privation in his last  years, that he might leave the more to his selfish and ungrateful  nephew. He died in 1827, in his fifty-seventh year, and is buried in  the Wahring Cemetery near Vienna. Let these extracts from a testamentary  paper addressed to his brothers in 1802, in expectation of death, speak  more eloquently of the hidden life of a heroic soul than any other words  could:    \"O ye, who consider or declare me to be hostile, obstinate, or  misanthropic, what injustice ye do me! Ye know not the secret causes of  that which to you wears such an appearance. My heart and my mind were  from childhood prone to the tender feelings of affection. Nay, I was  always disposed even to perform great actions. But, only consider that,  for the last six years, I have been attacked by an incurable complaint,  aggravated by the unskillful treatment of medical men, disappointed from  year to year in the hope of relief, and at last obliged to submit to the  endurance of an evil the cure of which may last perhaps for years, if  it is practicable at all. Born with a lively, ardent disposition,  susceptible to to the diversions of society, I was forced at an early  age to renounce them, and to pass my life in seclusion. If I strove at  any time to set myself above all this, oh how cruelly was I driven back  by the doubly painful experience of my defective hearing! and yet it  was not possible for me to say to people, 'Speak louder--bawl--for I  am deaf!' Ah! how could I proclaim the defect of a sense that I once  possessed in the highest perfection--in a perfection in which few of my  colleagues possess or ever did possess it? Indeed, I cannot! Forgive  me, then, if ye see me draw back when I would gladly mingle among you.  Doubly mortifying is my misfortune to me, as it must tend to cause me to  be misconceived.
