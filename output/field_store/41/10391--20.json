He begged me not  to open it.\"    Nayland Smith was studying the speaker's face.    \"What reason did he give for so extraordinary a request?\" he asked.    Sir Lionel Barton hesitated.    \"One,\" he replied at last, \"which amused me--at the time.  I must  inform you that Mekara--whose tomb my agent had discovered during my  absence in Tibet, and to enter which I broke my return journey to  Alexandria--was a high priest and first prophet of Amen--under the  Pharaoh of the Exodus; in short, one of the magicians who contested in  magic arts with Moses.  I thought the discovery unique, until Professor  Rembold furnished me with some curious particulars respecting the death  of M. Page le Roi, the French Egyptologist--particulars new to me.\"    We listened in growing surprise, scarcely knowing to what this tended.    \"M. le Roi,\" continued Barton, \"discovered, but kept secret, the tomb  of Amenti--another of this particular brotherhood.  It appears that he  opened the mummy case on the spot--these priests were of royal line,  and are buried in the valley of Biban-le-Moluk. His Fellah and Arab  servants deserted him for some reason--on seeing the mummy case--and he  was found dead, apparently strangled, beside it.  The matter was hushed  up by the Egyptian Government.  Rembold could not explain why.  But he  begged of me not to open the sarcophagus of Mekara.\"    A silence fell.    The strange facts regarding the sudden death of Page le Roi, which I  now heard for the first time, had impressed me unpleasantly, coming  from a man of Sir Lionel Barton's experience and reputation.    \"How long had it lain in the docks?\" jerked Smith.    \"For two days, I believe.  I am not a superstitious man, Mr. Smith, but  neither is Professor Rembold, and now that I know the facts respecting  Page le Roi, I can find it in my heart to thank God that I did not  see . . . whatever came out of that sarcophagus.\"    Nayland Smith stared him hard in the face.  \"I am glad you did not, Sir  Lionel,\" he said; \"for whatever the priest Mekara has to do with the  matter, by means of his sarcophagus, Dr. Fu-Manchu has made his first  attempt upon your life.  He has failed, but I hope you will accompany  me from here to a hotel.  He will not fail twice.\"        CHAPTER XII      IT was the night following that of the double tragedy at Rowan House.  Nayland Smith, with Inspector Weymouth, was engaged in some mysterious  inquiry at the docks, and I had remained at home to resume my strange  chronicle.  And--why should I not confess it?--my memories had  frightened me.    I was arranging my notes respecting the case of Sir Lionel Barton.  They were hopelessly incomplete.  For instance, I had jotted down the  following queries:--(1) Did any true parallel exist between the death  of M. Page le Roi and the death of Kwee, the Chinaman, and of Strozza?  (2) What had become of the mummy of Mekara?  (3) How had the murderer  escaped from a locked room?  (4) What was the purpose of the rubber  stopper?  (5) Why was Kwee hiding in the conservatory?  (6) Was the  green mist a mere subjective hallucination--a figment of Croxted's  imagination--or had he actually seen it?    Until these questions were satisfactorily answered, further progress  was impossible.  Nayland Smith frankly admitted that he was out of his  depth.  \"It looks, on the face of it, more like a case for the  Psychical Research people than for a plain Civil Servant, lately of  Mandalay,\" he had said only that morning.    \"Sir Lionel Barton really believes that supernatural agencies were  brought into operation by the opening of the high priest's coffin.  For  my part, even if I believed the same, I should still maintain that Dr.  Fu-Manchu controlled those manifestations.  But reason it out for  yourself and see if we arrive at any common center.  Don't work so much  upon the datum of the green mist, but keep to the FACTS which are  established.\"    I commenced to knock out my pipe in the ash-tray; then paused, pipe in  hand.  The house was quite still, for my landlady and all the small  household were out.    Above the noise of the passing tramcar I thought I had heard the hall  door open.  In the ensuing silence I sat and listened.    Not a sound.  Stay!  I slipped my hand into the table drawer, took out  my revolver, and stood up.    There WAS a sound.  Someone or something was creeping upstairs in the  dark!    Familiar with the ghastly media employed by the Chinaman, I was seized  with an impulse to leap to the door, shut and lock it.  But the  rustling sound proceeded, now, from immediately outside my partially  opened door.  I had not the time to close it; knowing somewhat of the  horrors at the command of Fu-Manchu, I had not the courage to open it.  My heart leaping wildly, and my eyes upon that bar of darkness with its  gruesome potentialities, I waited--waited for whatever was to come.  Perhaps twelve seconds passed in silence.    \"Who's there?\" I cried.  \"Answer, or I fire!\"    \"Ah!  no,\" came a soft voice, thrillingly musical.  \"Put it down--that  pistol.  Quick!  I must speak to you.\"    The door was pushed open, and there entered a slim figure wrapped in a  hooded cloak.  My hand fell, and I stood, stricken to silence, looking  into the beautiful dark eyes of Dr. Fu-Manchu's messenger--if her own  statement could be credited, slave.  On two occasions this girl, whose  association with the Doctor was one of the most profound mysteries of  the case, had risked--I cannot say what; unnameable punishment,  perhaps--to save me from death; in both cases from a terrible death.  For what was she come now?    Her lips slightly parted, she stood, holding her cloak about her, and  watching me with great passionate eyes.    \"How--\" I began.    But she shook her head impatiently.    \"HE has a duplicate key of the house door,\" was her amazing statement.  \"I have never betrayed a secret of my master before, but you must  arrange to replace the lock.\"    She came forward and rested her slim hands confidingly upon my  shoulders.  \"I have come again to ask you to take me away from him,\"  she said simply.    And she lifted her face to me.    Her words struck a chord in my heart which sang with strange music,  with music so barbaric that, frankly, I blushed to find it harmony.  Have I said that she was beautiful?  It can convey no faint conception  of her.  With her pure, fair skin, eyes like the velvet darkness of the  East, and red lips so tremulously near to mine, she was the most  seductively lovely creature I ever had looked upon.  In that electric  moment my heart went out in sympathy to every man who had bartered  honor, country, all for a woman's kiss.    \"I will see that you are placed under proper protection,\" I said  firmly, but my voice was not quite my own.  \"It is quite absurd to talk  of slavery here in England.  You are a free agent, or you could not be  here now.  Dr. Fu-Manchu cannot control your actions.\"    \"Ah!\" she cried, casting back her head scornfully, and releasing a  cloud of hair, through whose softness gleamed a jeweled head-dress.  \"No?  He cannot?  Do you know what it means to have been a slave?  Here, in your free England, do you know what it means--the razzia, the  desert journey, the whips of the drivers, the house of the dealer, the  shame.  Bah!\"    How beautiful she was in her indignation!    \"Slavery is put down, you imagine, perhaps?  You do not believe that  to-day--TO-DAY--twenty-five English sovereigns will buy a Galla girl,  who is brown, and\"--whisper--\"two hundred and fifty a Circassian, who  is white.  No, there is no slavery!  So!  Then what am I?\"    She threw open her cloak, and it is a literal fact that I rubbed my  eyes, half believing that I dreamed.  For beneath, she was arrayed in  gossamer silk which more than indicated the perfect lines of her slim  shape; wore a jeweled girdle and barbaric ornaments; was a figure fit  for the walled gardens of Stamboul--a figure amazing, incomprehensible,  in the prosaic setting of my rooms.    \"To-night I had no time to make myself an English miss,\" she said,  wrapping her cloak quickly about her.  \"You see me as I am.\"  Her  garments exhaled a faint perfume, and it reminded me of another meeting  I had had with her.  I looked into the challenging eyes.    \"Your request is but a pretense,\" I said.  \"Why do you keep the secrets  of that man, when they mean death to so many?\"    \"Death!  I have seen my own sister die of fever in the desert--seen her  thrown like carrion into a hole in the sand.  I have seen men flogged  until they prayed for death as a boon.  I have known the lash myself.  Death!  What does it matter?\"    She shocked me inexpressibly.  Enveloped in her cloak again, and with  only her slight accent to betray her, it was dreadful to hear such  words from a girl who, save for her singular type of beauty, might have  been a cultured European.    \"Prove, then, that you really wish to leave this man's service.  Tell  me what killed Strozza and the Chinaman,\" I said.    She shrugged her shoulders.    \"I do not know that.  But if you will carry me off\"--she clutched me  nervously--\"so that I am helpless, lock me up so that I cannot escape,  beat me, if you like, I will tell you all I do know.  While he is my  master I will never betray him.  Tear me from him--by force, do you  understand, BY FORCE, and my lips will be sealed no longer.  Ah!  but  you do not understand, with your 'proper authorities'--your police.  Police!  Ah, I have said enough.\"    A clock across the common began to strike.  The girl started and laid  her hands upon my shoulders again.  There were tears glittering among  the curved black lashes.    \"You do not understand,\" she whispered.  \"Oh, will you never understand  and release me from him!  I must go.  Already I have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17306"],[0,"The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 (#17)"],[1,"years, at the expiration of which  time it falls, with everything upon it, back into the possession of the  original holder, who pays nothing in return for improvements upon it.  The  improvements are therefore so calculated by the lessee as to be worth as  little as possible at the expiration of the stipulated term.  And as such  cottages are often built but twenty or thirty years before the expiration  of the term, it may easily be imagined that the contractors make no  unnecessary expenditures upon them.  Moreover, these contractors, usually  carpenters and builders, or manufacturers, spend little or nothing in  repairs, partly to avoid diminishing their rent receipts, and partly in  view of the approaching surrender of the improvement to the landowner;  while in consequence of commercial crises and the loss of work that  follows them, whole streets often stand empty, the cottages falling  rapidly into ruin and uninhabitableness.  It is calculated in general  that working-men's cottages last only forty years on the average.  This  sounds strangely enough when one sees the beautiful, massive walls of  newly-built ones, which seem to give promise of lasting a couple of  centuries; but the fact remains that the niggardliness of the original  expenditure, the neglect of all repairs, the frequent periods of  emptiness, the constant change of inhabitants, and the destruction  carried on by the dwellers during the final ten years, usually Irish  families, who do not hesitate to use the wooden portions for  fire-wood--all this, taken together, accomplishes the complete ruin of  the cottages by the end of forty years.  Hence it comes that Ancoats,  built chiefly since the sudden growth of manufacture, chiefly indeed  within the present century, contains a vast number of ruinous houses,  most of them being, in fact, in the last stages of inhabitableness.  I  will not dwell upon the amount of capital thus wasted, the small  additional expenditure upon the original improvement and upon repairs  which would suffice to keep this whole district clean, decent, and  inhabitable for years together.  I have to deal here with the state of  the houses and their inhabitants, and it must be admitted that no more  injurious and demoralising method of housing the workers has yet been  discovered than precisely this.  The working-man is constrained to occupy  such ruinous dwellings because he cannot pay for others, and because  there are no others in the vicinity of his mill; perhaps, too, because  they belong to the employer, who engages him only on condition of his  taking such a cottage.  The calculation with reference to the forty  years' duration of the cottage is, of course, not always perfectly  strict; for, if the dwellings are in a thickly-built-up portion of the  town, and there is a good prospect of finding steady occupants for them,  while the ground rent is high, the contractors do a little something to  keep the cottages inhabitable after the expiration of the forty years.  They never do anything more, however, than is absolutely unavoidable, and  the dwellings so repaired are the worst of all.  Occasionally when an  epidemic threatens, the otherwise sleepy conscience of the sanitary  police is a little stirred, raids are made into the working-men's  districts, whole rows of cellars and cottages are closed, as happened in  the case of several lanes near Oldham Road; but this does not last long:  the condemned cottages soon find occupants again, the owners are much  better off by letting them, and the sanitary police won't come again so  soon.  These east and north-east sides of Manchester are the only ones on  which the bourgeoisie has not built, because ten or eleven months of the  year the west and south-west wind drives the smoke of all the factories  hither, and that the working-people alone may breathe.    Southward from Great Ancoats Street, lies a great, straggling, working-  men's quarter, a hilly, barren stretch of land, occupied by detached,  irregularly built rows of houses or squares, between these, empty  building lots, uneven, clayey, without grass and scarcely passable in wet  weather.  The cottages are all filthy and old, and recall the New Town to  mind.  The stretch cut through by the Birmingham railway is the most  thickly built-up and the worst.  Here flows the Medlock with countless  windings through a valley, which is, in places, on a level with the  valley of the Irk.  Along both sides of the stream, which is coal black,  stagnant and foul, stretches a broad belt of factories and working-men's  dwellings, the latter all in the worst condition.  The bank is chiefly  declivitous and is built over to the water's edge, just as we saw along  the Irk; while the houses are equally bad, whether built on the  Manchester side or in Ardwick, Chorlton, or Hulme.  But the most horrible  spot (if I should describe all the separate spots in detail I should  never come to the end) lies on the Manchester side, immediately south-  west of Oxford Road, and is known as Little Ireland.  In a rather deep  hole, in a curve of the Medlock and surrounded on all four sides by tall  factories and high embankments, covered with buildings, stand two groups  of about two hundred cottages, built chiefly back to back, in which live  about four thousand human beings, most of them Irish.  The cottages are  old, dirty, and of the smallest sort, the streets uneven, fallen into  ruts and in part without drains or pavement; masses of refuse, offal and  sickening filth lie among standing pools in all directions; the  atmosphere is poisoned by the effluvia from these, and laden and darkened  by the smoke of a dozen tall factory chimneys.  A horde of ragged women  and children swarm about here, as filthy as the swine that thrive upon  the garbage heaps and in the puddles.  In short, the whole rookery  furnishes such a hateful and repulsive spectacle as can hardly be  equalled in the worst court on the Irk.  The race that lives in these  ruinous cottages, behind broken windows, mended with oilskin, sprung  doors, and rotten door-posts, or in dark, wet cellars, in measureless  filth and stench, in this atmosphere penned in as if with a purpose, this  race must really have reached the lowest stage of humanity.  This is the  impression and the line of thought which the exterior of this district  forces upon the beholder.  But what must one think when he hears that in  each of these pens, containing at most two rooms, a garret and perhaps a  cellar, on the average twenty human beings live; that in the whole  region, for each one hundred and twenty persons, one usually inaccessible  privy is provided; and that in spite of all the preachings of the  physicians, in spite of the excitement into which the cholera epidemic  plunged the sanitary police by reason of the condition of Little Ireland,  in spite of everything, in this year of grace 1844, it is in almost the  same state as in 1831!  Dr. Kay asserts that not only the cellars but the  first floors of all the houses in this district are damp; that a number  of cellars once filled up with earth have now been emptied and are  occupied once more by Irish people; that in one cellar the water  constantly wells up through a hole stopped with clay, the cellar lying  below the river level, so that its occupant, a hand-loom weaver, had to  bale out the water from his dwelling every morning and pour it into the  street!    Farther down, on the left side of the Medlock, lies Hulme, which,  properly speaking, is one great working-people's district, the condition  of which coincides almost exactly with that of Ancoats; the more thickly  built-up regions chiefly bad and approaching ruin, the less populous of  more modern structure, but generally sunk in filth.  On the other side of  the Medlock, in Manchester proper, lies a second great working-men's  district which stretches on both sides of Deansgate as far as the  business quarter, and in certain parts rivals the Old Town.  Especially  in the immediate vicinity of the business quarter, between Bridge and  Quay Streets, Princess and Peter Streets, the crowded construction  exceeds in places the narrowest courts of the Old Town.  Here are long,  narrow lanes between which run contracted, crooked courts and passages,  the entrances to which are so irregular that the explorer is caught in a  blind alley at every few steps, or comes out where he least expects to,  unless he knows every court and every alley exactly and separately.  According to Dr. Kay, the most demoralised class of all Manchester lived  in these ruinous and filthy districts, people whose occupations are  thieving and prostitution; and, to all appearance, his assertion is still  true at the present moment.  When the sanitary police made its expedition  hither in 1831, it found the uncleanness as great as in Little Ireland or  along the Irk (that it is not much better to-day, I can testify); and  among other items, they found in Parliament Street for three hundred and  eighty persons, and in Parliament Passage for thirty thickly populated  houses, but a single privy.    If we cross the Irwell to Salford, we find on a peninsula formed by the  river, a town of eighty thousand inhabitants, which, properly speaking,  is one large working-men's quarter, penetrated by a single wide avenue.  Salford, once more important than Manchester, was then the leading town  of the surrounding district to which it still gives its name, Salford  Hundred.  Hence it is that an old and therefore very unwholesome, dirty,  and ruinous locality is to be found here, lying opposite the Old Church  of Manchester, and in as bad a condition as the Old Town on the other  side of the Irwell.  Farther away from the river lies the newer portion,  which is, however, already beyond the limit of its forty years of cottage  life, and therefore ruinous enough.  All Salford is built in courts or  narrow lanes, so narrow, that"]]]
