The remainder of Governor Belcher's term of office was principally taken  up in endeavoring to settle the currency. Honest John Hull's pine-tree  shillings had long ago been worn out, or lost, or melted down again, and  their place was supplied by bills of paper or parchment, which were  nominally valued at three pence and upwards. The value of these bills kept  continually sinking, because the real hard money could not be obtained for  them. They were a great deal worse than the old Indian currency of  clam-shells. These disorders of the circulating medium were a source of  endless plague and perplexity to the rulers and legislators, not only in  Governor Belcher's days, but for many years before and afterwards.    Finally, the people suspected that Governor Belcher was secretly  endeavoring to establish the Episcopal mode of worship in the provinces.  There was enough of the old Puritan spirit remaining, to cause most of the  true sons of New England to look with horror upon such an attempt. Great  exertions were made, to induce the king to remove the governor.  Accordingly, in 1740, he was compelled to resign his office, and  Grandfather's chair into the bargain, to Mr. Shirley.          Chapter VIII      \"William Shirley,\" said Grandfather, \"had come from England a few years  before, and begun to practise law in Boston. You will think, perhaps,  that, as he had been a lawyer, the new governor used to sit in our great  chair, reading heavy law-books from morning till night. On the contrary,  he was as stirring and active a governor as Massachusetts ever had. Even  Sir William Phips hardly equalled him. The first year or two of his  administration was spent in trying to regulate the currency. But, in 1744,  after a peace of more than thirty years, war broke out between France and  England.\"    \"And I suppose,\" said Charley, \"the governor went to take Canada.\"    \"Not exactly, Charley,\" said Grandfather, \"though you have made a pretty  shrewd conjecture. He planned, in 1745, an expedition against Louisbourg.  This was a fortified city, on the Island of Cape Breton, near Nova Scotia.  Its walls were of immense height and strength, and were defended by  hundreds of heavy cannon. It was the strongest fortress which the French  possessed in America; and if the king of France had guessed Governor  Shirley's intentions, he would have sent all the ships he could muster, to  protect it.\"    As the siege of Louisbourg was one of the most remarkable events that ever  the inhabitants of New England were engaged in, Grandfather endeavored to  give his auditors a lively idea of the spirit with which they set about  it. We shall call his description        THE PROVINCIAL MUSTER      The expedition against Louisbourg first began to be thought of in the  month of January. From that time, the governor's chair was continually  surrounded by counsellors, representatives, clergymen, captains, pilots,  and all manner of people, with whom he consulted about this wonderful  project.    First of all, it was necessary to provide men and arms. The legislature  immediately sent out a huge quantity of paper money, with which, as if by  magic spell, the governor hoped to get possession of all the old cannon,  powder and balls, rusty swords and muskets, and every thing else that  would be serviceable in killing Frenchmen. Drums were beaten in all the  villages of Massachusetts, to enlist soldiers for the service. Messages  were sent to the other governors of New England, and to New York and  Pennsylvania, entreating them to unite in this crusade against the French.  All these provinces agreed to give what assistance they could.    But there was one very important thing to be decided. Who shall be the  General of this great army? Peace had continued such an unusual length of  time, that there was now less military experience among the colonists,  than at any former period. The old Puritans had always kept their weapons  bright, and were never destitute of warlike captains, who were skilful in  assault or defence. But the swords of their descendants had grown rusty by  disuse. There was nobody in New England that knew any thing about sieges,  or any other regular fighting. The only persons, at all acquainted with  warlike business, were a few elderly men, who had hunted Indians through  the underbrush of the forest, in old Governor Dummer's war.    In this dilemma, Governor Shirley fixed upon a wealthy merchant, named  William Pepperell, who was pretty well known and liked among the people.  As to military skill, he had no more of it than his neighbors. But, as the  governor urged him very pressingly, Mr. Pepperell consented to shut up his  leger, gird on a sword, and assume the title of General.    Meantime, what a hubbub was raised by this scheme! Rub-a-dub-dub!  Rub-a-dub-dub! The rattle of drums, beaten out of all manner of time, was  heard above every other sound.    Nothing now was so valuable as arms, of whatever style and fashion they  might be. The bellows blew, and the hammer clanged continually upon the  anvil, while the blacksmiths were repairing the broken weapons of other  wars. Doubtless, some of the soldiers lugged out those enormous, heavy  muskets, which used to be fired with rests, in the time of the early  Puritans. Great horse-pistols, too, were found, which would go off with a  bang like a cannon. Old cannon, with touch-holes almost as big as their  muzzles, were looked upon as inestimable treasures. Pikes, which perhaps,  had been handled by Miles Standish's soldiers, now made their appearance  again. Many a young man ransacked the garret, and brought forth his  great-grandfather's sword, corroded with rust, and stained with the blood  of King Philip's war.    Never had there been seen such an arming as this, when a people, so long  peaceful, rose to the war, with the best weapons that they could lay their  hands upon. And still the drums were heard--Rub-a-dub-dub!  Rub-a-dub-dub!--in all the towns and villages; and louder and more numerous  grew the trampling footsteps of the recruits that marched behind.    And now the army began to gather into Boston. Tall, lanky, awkward,  fellows, came in squads, and companies, and regiments, swaggering along,  dressed in their brown homespun clothes and blue yarn stockings. They  stooped, as if they still had hold of the plough-handles, and marched  without any time or tune. Hither they came, from the corn-fields, from the  clearing in the forest, from the blacksmith's forge, from the carpenter's  workshop, and from the shoemaker's seat. They were an army of rough faces  and sturdy frames. A trained officer of Europe would have laughed at them,  till his sides had ached. But there was a spirit in their bosoms, which is  more essential to soldiership than to wear red coats, and march in stately  ranks to the sound of regular music.    Still was heard the beat of the drum--rub-a-dub-dub!--and now a host of  three or four thousand men had found their way to Boston. Little quiet was  there then! Forth scampered the school-boys, shouting behind the drums.  The whole town--the whole land--was on fire with war.    After the arrival of the troops, they were probably reviewed upon the  Common. We may imagine Governor Shirley and General Pepperell riding  slowly along the line, while the drummers beat strange old tunes, like  psalm-tunes, and all the officers and soldiers put on their most warlike  looks. It would have been a terrible sight for the Frenchmen, could they  but have witnessed it!    At length, on the twenty-fourth of March, 1745, the army gave a parting  shout, and set sail from Boston in ten or twelve vessels, which had been  hired by the governor. A few days afterwards, an English fleet, commanded  by Commodore Peter Warren, sailed also for Louisbourg, to assist the  provincial army. So, now, after all this bustle of preparation, the town  and province were left in stillness and repose.    But, stillness and repose, at such a time of anxious expectation, are hard  to bear. The hearts of the old people and women sunk within them, when  they reflected what perils they had sent their sons, and husbands, and  brothers, to encounter. The boys loitered heavily to school, missing the  rub-a-dub-dub, and the trampling march, in the rear of which they had so  lately run and shouted. All the ministers prayed earnestly, in their  pulpits, for a blessing on the army of New England. In every family, when  the good man lifted up his heart in domestic worship, the burthen of his  petition was for the safety of those dear ones, who were fighting under  the walls of Louisbourg.    Governor Shirley, all this time, was probably in an ecstasy of impatience.  He could not sit still a moment. He found no quiet, not even in  Grandfather's chair, but hurried to-and-fro, and up and down the staircase  of the Province House. Now, he mounted to the cupola, and looked sea-ward,  straining his eyes to discover if there were a sail upon the horizon. Now,  he hastened down the stairs, and stood beneath the portal, on the red  freestone steps, to receive some mud-bespattered courtier, from whom he  hoped to hear tidings of the army.    A few weeks after the departure of the troops, Commodore Warren sent a  small vessel to Boston, with two French prisoners. One of them was  Monsieur Bouladrie, who had been commander of a battery, outside of the  walls of Louisbourg. The other was the Marquis de la Maison Forte, captain  of a French frigate, which had been taken by Commodore Warren's fleet.  These prisoners assured Governor Shirley, that the fortifications of  Louisbourg were far too strong ever to be stormed by the provincial army.    Day after day, and week after week, went on. The people grew almost  heart-sick with anxiety; for the flower of the country was at peril in  this adventurous expedition. It was now day-break, on the morning"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15699"],[0,"A Handbook of the Boer War (#17)"],[1,"eilly, whose belief in it though shaken was  not wholly abandoned. Through a mutual friend, Lorenzo Boyes, Acting  Civil Commissioner of the District, the pebble came to the notice of an  expert mineralogist named Atherstone at Grahamstown, but it was held so  lightly in esteem by the sender that it reached Atherstone as an  enclosure in an ordinary unregistered letter. Atherstone examined it,  and when it had not only spoilt all the jeweller's files in the town but  had also passed an examination by polarized light, pronounced that it  was a diamond worth £500. His certificate to its character, which had  been so ignorantly disparaged, was the origin of the Diamond industry of  South Africa. Another diamond was soon picked up near Hopetown which  without difficulty or misadventure rose to its own plane in mineralogy.  Its career was short and its destiny happy. It was purchased by the  first Earl of Dudley for the adornment of his second wife.    When it was noised abroad with the customary exaggeration that the  monopoly of Golconda and the Brazils was at an end and that diamonds  grew wild on the South African veld, a wide extent of country was  explored and the precious crystallized carbon was found in districts  separated by many hundreds of miles. In certain places, one of which  became known as the town of Kimberley, it was ascertained to recur in a  constant proportion of the contents of the \"pipes\" or volcanic tubes  which rose through the surface strata.    The pioneers of Kimberley took possession of the diamondiferous grounds  without ascertaining to whom they belonged, and when their value became  positive the question of ownership arose. The boundaries of the  districts administered by the Cape Colony, the Orange Free State, and  the Transvaal respectively were, as regards territory, supposed to be of  little account, vague, ill-defined, and unsurveyed; and the districts  themselves were occupied by native tribes of nomad habits. About the  middle of the XIXth century a Hottentot chief named Waterboer came up  out of the West and squatted in the districts lying between the Orange  and the Vaal. His rights, such as they were, were assumed or acquired by  the Cape Government, which soon became involved in controversy with the  Orange Free State as to their extent and nature. Finally the British  Empire secured a good title to the estate by the payment of £90,000. But  the Orange Free State not unnaturally, when the value of the Diamond  Fields increased day by day, soon began to think that it had parted with  a profitable possession for an inadequate return. The feeling rankled;  and the confident expectation of recovering Kimberley sold for a song  tempted Bloemfontein into the fatal alliance with Pretoria.    In 1871 a sickly youth named Cecil Rhodes came from England to South  Africa in search of health, which after a short sojourn in Natal he  found at Kimberley. The prospects of the place favourably impressed him,  and he soon laid in it the foundations of his fortune; but six years  later the future of Kimberley was still precarious and the discovery of  gold in a remote district of the Transvaal sucked thither the greater  proportion of the citizens, who, however, found that they had not  bettered themselves by the change and returned to the pipes: and soon  nearly a hundred companies, syndicates, and private adventurers were  groping for diamonds over an area of less than two hundred acres. The  waste of energy was manifest to Rhodes, who in 1888 completed, with the  help of the Rothschilds, the task upon which he had been engaged for  some years, the amalgamation of the conflicting and overlapping diamond  interests under the name of the De Beers Consolidated Mines. It was soon  found that the new industry was insufficiently protected by the existing  criminal law and a new felony was created by the Illicit Diamond Buying  Act.    It has been for several centuries the practice of Great Britain to  entrust to private companies the imperial responsibilities which she is  reluctant to assume and to let out to contractors, who can be repudiated  if they fail and expropriated if they succeed, the job of expanding an  Empire. Of this policy the most prominent instance is the East India  Company, a commercial venture which obtained from Queen Elizabeth a  charter empowering it to trade with the East and which, though connected  with Great Britain only by the slender thread of an ocean track of  12,000 miles, maintained itself for two centuries and a half with ever  increasing territory and authority until it became a great military  Empire. Other examples of lower degree are the Hudson's Bay Company and  the Borneo Company. The De Beers Company provided out of its abundance  large sums for exploration and settlement in South Africa and for the  furtherance of the Imperial idea, and it is said that Rhodes spent the  whole of one night in arguing with some of the materialistic magnates of  Kimberley, before he could induce them to consent to the employment of  the resources of the Company in the advancement of his schemes of  Empire. He found, however, that these could not be satisfactorily  promoted by a Company whose primary interests were commercial rather  than imperial; and in 1888 he obtained a charter for the British South  Africa Company, an offshoot of the De Beers Company, formed for the  purpose of extending the British Empire towards the Equator.    The question of the defences of Kimberley engaged the attention of the  De Beers Company some years before the outbreak of the war. Its  vulnerability to attack from the Orange Free State, the border of which  ran close to the town, was obvious; and in 1896 a depot of arms and  ammunition was formed. A military plan of the place was sent to the  Imperial authorities and a defence force was also organized. This,  however, had in 1899 ceased to exist owing chiefly to the action of Mr.  Schreiner, at that time the Premier of the Cape Colony, who in June  refused, with complacent optimism, to furnish it with arms, saying that,  \"there is no reason for apprehending that Kimberley is in danger of  attack,\" and that \"the fears of the citizens are groundless and their  anticipations without foundation.\" A battery of artillery was, however,  surreptitiously brought up from King Williamstown.    The policy of Schreiner during the months preceding the war is obscure.  While refusing help to Kimberley he was allowing munitions of war, which  were way billed as pianos and hardware, to pass through the Cape Colony  to the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. He does not appear to have  been actively disloyal to the Imperial Government and in his own way he  probably did his best to keep the peace. His mind was cast in a mould  which is not uncommon in the British Empire but which is rarely found  outside it. He was more anxious to stand well with its enemies, and like  the Unjust Steward to have a claim to a place in their houses, if they  were successful, than to work for its security. It was with great  difficulty that Sir A. Milner as late as September 18 obtained his  consent to the dispatch of a few regulars to Kimberley to form the  backbone of a defensive force. He seems to have retained almost to the  end, in spite of all indications to the contrary, the belief that the  war would be averted or at least that the Orange Free State would not  join in it. Yet in this he erred in good company. Mr. Balfour said that  if on September 28 he had been asked whether war with the Orange Free  State was a probable contingency he would have replied that war with  Switzerland was one equally probable; and Lord Lansdowne declined before  September 23 to discuss with Lord Roberts the question of operations in  the Free State. Buller, with surer insight, had foreseen the alliance as  far back as 1881.    The War Office, however, was to a certain extent on the alert and  distrusted the optimism of Schreiner and of a high military official who  had been for some years in South Africa. Officers were sent to Kimberley  to organize a scheme of defence, but having regard to the susceptibility  of the Capetown Government it was done secretly and confidentially and  Schreiner was outwitted. By October 7 the town, which was under the  command of Colonel Kekewich, was secure against a _coup de main_ though  not against a vigorous and sustained siege. Little more than an eighth  of the garrison was composed of regular troops; the artillery was out of  date; rifles and ammunition were deficient. On October 13 Rhodes threw  himself into Kimberley and became for better or worse a power in the  town. As soon as the siege began the relative value of the chief  products of the mines was inverted: water, the most generous gift of  nature and hitherto an embarrassment in the workings, became for the  time being more valuable than the diamonds.    On October 12 the curtain of the great drama was raised and the first  scene presented. It showed the capture of an armoured train on the  railway between Kimberley and Mafeking. Kimberley under any  circumstances was a prize worth winning. But Kimberley taken with Rhodes  as a prisoner of war, the man who had curbed and checked on every side  the expansion of the Republics, who had taken Matabeleland on the north  and Bechuanaland on the west into the fold of the British Empire, would  be more than a prize, would be a triumph. Rhodes metaphorically in  chains, and actually paraded as a captive in the streets of Bloemfontein  and Pretoria was an alluring prospect.    Great, however, as were the advantages to be gained by the early capture  of Kimberley, the object was not pursued with energy and determination.  When the siege began on November 6 the situation was in favour of the  attack. The Boers were in possession of the railway from Orange River  Station to Mafeking: Kimberley was ill-supplied with the munitions and  weapons of war"]]]
