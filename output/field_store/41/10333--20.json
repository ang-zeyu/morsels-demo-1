The robber maiden lifted up little  Gerda, and took the precaution to bind her fast on the Reindeer's back;  she even gave her a small cushion to sit on. \"Here are your worsted  leggins, for it will be cold; but the muff I shall keep for myself, for  it is so very pretty. But I do not wish you to be cold. Here is a pair  of lined gloves of my mother's; they just reach up to your elbow. On  with them! Now you look about the hands just like my ugly old mother!\"    And Gerda wept for joy.    \"I can't bear to see you fretting,\" said the little robber maiden. \"This  is just the time when you ought to look pleased. Here are two loaves and  a ham for you, so that you won't starve.\" The bread and the meat were  fastened to the Reindeer's back; the little maiden opened the door,  called in all the dogs, and then with her knife cut the rope that  fastened the animal, and said to him, \"Now, off with you; but take good  care of the little girl!\"    And Gerda stretched out her hands with the large wadded gloves towards  the robber maiden, and said, \"Farewell!\" and the Reindeer flew on over  bush and bramble through the great wood, over moor and heath, as fast as  he could go.    \"Ddsa! Ddsa!\" was heard in the sky. It was just as if somebody was  sneezing.    \"These are my old northern-lights,\" said the Reindeer, \"look how they  gleam!\" And on he now sped still quicker--day and night on he went: the  loaves were consumed, and the ham too; and now they were in Lapland.      SIXTH STORY. The Lapland Woman and the Finland Woman    Suddenly they stopped before a little house, which looked very  miserable. The roof reached to the ground; and the door was so low, that  the family were obliged to creep upon their stomachs when they went in  or out. Nobody was at home except an old Lapland woman, who was dressing  fish by the light of an oil lamp. And the Reindeer told her the whole  of Gerda's history, but first of all his own; for that seemed to him of  much greater importance. Gerda was so chilled that she could not speak.    \"Poor thing,\" said the Lapland woman, \"you have far to run still. You  have more than a hundred miles to go before you get to Finland; there  the Snow Queen has her country-house, and burns blue lights every  evening. I will give you a few words from me, which I will write on a  dried haberdine, for paper I have none; this you can take with you to  the Finland woman, and she will be able to give you more information  than I can.\"    When Gerda had warmed herself, and had eaten and drunk, the Lapland  woman wrote a few words on a dried haberdine, begged Gerda to take care  of them, put her on the Reindeer, bound her fast, and away sprang the  animal. \"Ddsa! Ddsa!\" was again heard in the air; the most charming  blue lights burned the whole night in the sky, and at last they came to  Finland. They knocked at the chimney of the Finland woman; for as to a  door, she had none.    There was such a heat inside that the Finland woman herself went about  almost naked. She was diminutive and dirty. She immediately loosened  little Gerda's clothes, pulled off her thick gloves and boots; for  otherwise the heat would have been too great--and after laying a piece  of ice on the Reindeer's head, read what was written on the fish-skin.  She read it three times: she then knew it by heart; so she put the fish  into the cupboard--for it might very well be eaten, and she never threw  anything away.    Then the Reindeer related his own story first, and afterwards that of  little Gerda; and the Finland woman winked her eyes, but said nothing.    \"You are so clever,\" said the Reindeer; \"you can, I know, twist all the  winds of the world together in a knot. If the seaman loosens one knot,  then he has a good wind; if a second, then it blows pretty stiffly; if  he undoes the third and fourth, then it rages so that the forests are  upturned. Will you give the little maiden a potion, that she may possess  the strength of twelve men, and vanquish the Snow Queen?\"    \"The strength of twelve men!\" said the Finland woman. \"Much good that  would be!\" Then she went to a cupboard, and drew out a large skin rolled  up. When she had unrolled it, strange characters were to be seen written  thereon; and the Finland woman read at such a rate that the perspiration  trickled down her forehead.    But the Reindeer begged so hard for little Gerda, and Gerda looked so  imploringly with tearful eyes at the Finland woman, that she winked, and  drew the Reindeer aside into a corner, where they whispered together,  while the animal got some fresh ice put on his head.    \"'Tis true little Kay is at the Snow Queen's, and finds everything there  quite to his taste; and he thinks it the very best place in the world;  but the reason of that is, he has a splinter of glass in his eye, and in  his heart. These must be got out first; otherwise he will never go back  to mankind, and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him.\"    \"But can you give little Gerda nothing to take which will endue her with  power over the whole?\"    \"I can give her no more power than what she has already. Don't you see  how great it is? Don't you see how men and animals are forced to serve  her; how well she gets through the world barefooted? She must not hear  of her power from us; that power lies in her heart, because she is  a sweet and innocent child! If she cannot get to the Snow Queen by  herself, and rid little Kay of the glass, we cannot help her. Two miles  hence the garden of the Snow Queen begins; thither you may carry the  little girl. Set her down by the large bush with red berries, standing  in the snow; don't stay talking, but hasten back as fast as possible.\"  And now the Finland woman placed little Gerda on the Reindeer's back,  and off he ran with all imaginable speed.    \"Oh! I have not got my boots! I have not brought my gloves!\" cried  little Gerda. She remarked she was without them from the cutting frost;  but the Reindeer dared not stand still; on he ran till he came to the  great bush with the red berries, and there he set Gerda down, kissed her  mouth, while large bright tears flowed from the animal's eyes, and then  back he went as fast as possible. There stood poor Gerda now, without  shoes or gloves, in the very middle of dreadful icy Finland.    She ran on as fast as she could. There then came a whole regiment of  snow-flakes, but they did not fall from above, and they were quite  bright and shining from the Aurora Borealis. The flakes ran along  the ground, and the nearer they came the larger they grew. Gerda well  remembered how large and strange the snow-flakes appeared when she  once saw them through a magnifying-glass; but now they were large and  terrific in another manner--they were all alive. They were the outposts  of the Snow Queen. They had the most wondrous shapes; some looked like  large ugly porcupines; others like snakes knotted together, with their  heads sticking out; and others, again, like small fat bears, with the  hair standing on end: all were of dazzling whiteness--all were living  snow-flakes.    Little Gerda repeated the Lord's Prayer. The cold was so intense that  she could see her own breath, which came like smoke out of her mouth. It  grew thicker and thicker, and took the form of little angels, that grew  more and more when they touched the earth. All had helms on their heads,  and lances and shields in their hands; they increased in numbers; and  when Gerda had finished the Lord's Prayer, she was surrounded by a whole  legion. They thrust at the horrid snow-flakes with their spears, so that  they flew into a thousand pieces; and little Gerda walked on bravely and  in security. The angels patted her hands and feet; and then she felt the  cold less, and went on quickly towards the palace of the Snow Queen.    But now we shall see how Kay fared. He never thought of Gerda, and least  of all that she was standing before the palace.      SEVENTH STORY. What Took Place in the Palace of the Snow Queen, and what  Happened Afterward.    The walls of the palace were of driving snow, and the windows and doors  of cutting winds. There were more than a hundred halls there, according  as the snow was driven by the winds. The largest was many miles in  extent; all were lighted up by the powerful Aurora Borealis, and all  were so large, so empty, so icy cold, and so resplendent! Mirth never  reigned there; there was never even a little bear-ball, with the storm  for music, while the polar bears went on their hind legs and showed off  their steps. Never a little tea-party of white young lady foxes; vast,  cold, and empty were the halls of the Snow Queen. The northern-lights  shone with such precision that one could tell exactly when they were  at their highest or lowest degree of brightness. In the middle of the  empty, endless hall of snow, was a frozen lake; it was cracked in a  thousand pieces, but each piece was so like the other, that it seemed  the work of a cunning artificer. In the middle of this lake sat the Snow  Queen when she was at home; and then she said she was sitting in the  Mirror of Understanding, and that this was the only one and the best  thing in the world.    Little Kay was quite blue, yes nearly black with cold; but he did not  observe it, for she had kissed away all feeling of cold from his body,  and his heart was a lump of ice. He was dragging along some pointed  flat pieces of ice, which he laid together in all possible ways, for he  wanted to make something with them; just as we have little flat pieces  of wood to make geometrical figures with, called the Chinese Puzzle.  Kay made all sorts of figures, the most complicated, for it was  an ice-puzzle for the understanding. In his eyes the figures were  extraordinarily beautiful, and of the utmost importance; for the bit  of glass which was in his eye"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16042"],[0,"The Wonder Book of Bible Stories (#17)"],[1,"e, so that they might give him advice in ruling his  people.    Among the young men thus chosen were four Jews, men who had been brought  from Judah. By order of the king the names of these men were changed.  One of them, named Daniel, was to be called Belteshazzer; the other  three young men were called Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. They were  taught in all the knowledge of the Chaldeans; and after three years of  training they were taken into the king's palace.    King Nebuchadnezzar was pleased with them, more than with any others who  stood before him. He found them wise and faithful in the work given to  them, and able to rule over men under them. And these four men came to  the highest places in the kingdom of the Chaldeans.    At one time King Nebuchadnezzar caused a great image to be made, and to  be covered with gold. This image he set up, as an idol to be worshipped,  on the plain of Dura, near the city of Babylon. When it was finished, it  stood upon its base or foundation almost a hundred feet high; so that  upon the plain it could be seen far away. Then the king sent out a  command for all the princes, and rulers, and nobles in the land, to come  to a great gathering, when the image was to be set apart for worship.    The great men of the kingdom came from far and near and stood around  the image. Among them, by command of the king, were Daniel's three  friends, the young Jews, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. For some  reason, Daniel himself was not there. He may have been busy with the  work of the kingdom in some other place.    At one moment in the service before the image, all the trumpets sounded,  the drums were beaten, and music was made upon musical instruments of  all kinds, as a signal for all the people to kneel down and worship the  great golden image. But while the people were kneeling, there were three  men who stood up, and would not bow down. These were the three young  Jews, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. They knelt down before the Lord  God only.    Many of the nobles had been jealous of these young men, because they had  been lifted to high places in the rule of the kingdom; and these men who  hated Daniel and his friends, were glad to find that these three men had  not obeyed the command of King Nebuchadnezzar. The king had said that if  any one did not worship the golden image he should be thrown into a  furnace of fire. These men who hated the Jews came to the king and said:    \"O king, may you live for ever! You gave orders that when the music  sounded, every one should bow down and worship the golden image; and  that if any man did not worship, he should be thrown into a furnace of  fire. There are some Jews, whom you have made rulers in the land, who  have not done as you commanded. Their names are Shadrach, Meshach and  Abed-nego. They do not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image  that you have set up.\"    [Illustration: _Nebuchadnezzar was fitted with rage_]    Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage and fury at knowing that any  one should dare to disobey his words. He sent for these three men and  said to them:    \"O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, was it by purpose that you did not  fall down and worship the image of gold? The music shall sound once  more, and if you then will worship the image, it will be well. But if  you will not, then you shall be thrown into the furnace of fire, to  die.\"    These three young men were not afraid of the king. They said:    \"O King Nebuchadnezzar, we are ready to answer you at once. The God whom  we serve is able to save us from the fiery furnace, and we know that he  will save us. But if it is God's will that we should die, even then you  may understand, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship  the golden image.\"    This answer made the king more furious than before. He said to his  servants:    \"Make a fire in the furnace hotter than ever it has been before, as hot  as fire can be made; and throw these three men into it.\"    Then the soldiers of the king's army seized the three young Jews, as  they stood in their loose robes, with their turbans on their heads. They  tied them with ropes, and dragged them to the mouth of the furnace, and  threw them into the fire. The flames rushed from the opened door with  such fury that they burned even to death the soldiers who were holding  these men; and the men themselves fell down bound into the middle of the  fiery furnace.    But an angel befriended them and they were unhurt.    [Illustration: _An angel befriended them_]    King Nebuchadnezzar stood in front of the furnace, and looked into the  open door. As he looked, he was filled with wonder at what he saw; and  he said to the nobles around him:    \"Did we not throw three men bound into the fire? How is it then that I  see four men loose walking in the furnace; and the fourth man looks as  though he were a son of the gods?\"    And the nobles who stood by could scarcely speak, so great was their  surprise.    \"It is true, O king,\" at last they said to Nebuchadnezzar, \"that we cast  these men into the flames, expecting them to be burned up; and we cannot  understand how it happens that they have not been destroyed.\"    The king came near to the door of the furnace, as the fire became lower;  and he called out to the three men within it:    \"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye who serve the Most High God, come  out of the fire, and come to me.\"    They came out and stood before the king, in the sight of all the  princes, and nobles, and rulers; and every one could see that they were  alive.    Their garments had not been scorched, nor their hair singed, nor was  there even the smell of fire upon them.    Then King Nebuchadnezzar said before all his rulers:    \"Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent  his angel, and has saved the lives of these men who trusted in him. _I_  make a law that no man in all my kingdoms shall say a word against  their God, for there is no other god who can save in this manner those  who worship him. And if any man speaks a word against their God, the  Most High God, that man shall be cut in pieces, and his house shall be  torn down.\"    After King Nebuchadnezzar died, his kingdom became weak, and the city of  Babylon was taken by the Medes and Persians, under Cyrus, a great  warrior.    THE STORY OF DANIEL IN THE LIONS' DEN      The lands which had been the Babylonian or Chaldean empire, now became  the empire of Persia; and over these Darius was the king. King Darius  gave to Daniel, who was now a very old man, a high place in honor and in  power. Among all the rulers over the land, Daniel stood first, for the  king saw that he was wise and able to rule. This made the other princes  and rulers very jealous, and they tried to find something evil in  Daniel, so that they could speak to the king against him.    These men saw that three times every day Daniel went to his room and  opened the window that was toward the city of Jerusalem, and looking  toward Jerusalem, made his prayer to God. Jerusalem was at that time in  ruins, and the Temple was no longer standing; but Daniel prayed three  times each day with his face toward the place where the house of God had  once stood, although it was many hundreds of miles away.    These nobles thought that in Daniel's prayers they could find a chance  to do him harm, and perhaps cause him to be put to death. They came to  King Darius, and said to him:    \"All the rulers have agreed together to have a law made that for thirty  days no one shall ask anything of any god or of any man, except from  you, O king; and that if any one shall pray to any god, or shall ask  anything from any man during the thirty days, except from you, O king,  he shall be thrown into the den where the lions are kept. Now, O king,  make the law, and sign the writing, so that it cannot be changed, for no  law among the Medes and the Persians can be altered.\"    The king was not a wise man; and being foolish and vain, he was pleased  with this law which would set him even above the gods. So without asking  Daniel's advice, he signed the writing; and the law was made, and the  word was sent out through the kingdom, that for thirty days no one  should pray to any god.    Daniel knew that the law had been made, but every day he went to his  room three times, and opened the window that looked toward Jerusalem,  and offered his prayers to the Lord, just as he had prayed in other  times. These rulers were watching near by, and they saw Daniel kneeling  in prayer to God. Then they came to the king, and said:    \"O King Darius, have you not made a law, that if any one in thirty days  offers a prayer, he shall be thrown into the den of lions?\"    \"It is true,\" said the king. \"The law has been made, and it must  stand.\"    They said to the king: \"There is one man who does not obey the law which  you have made. It is that Daniel, one of the captive Jews. Every day  Daniel prays to his God three times, just as he did before you signed  the writing of the law.\"    [Illustration: _Thrown into the den of lions_]    Then the king was very sorry for what he had done, for he loved Daniel,  and knew that no one could take his place in the kingdom. All day, until  the sun went down, he tried in vain to find some way to save Daniel's  life; but when evening came, these men again told him of the law that he  had made, and said to him that it must be kept. Very unwillingly the  king sent for Daniel, and gave an order that he should be thrown into  the den of lions. He said to Daniel: \"Perhaps your God, whom you serve  so faithfully, will save you from the lions.\"    They led Daniel to the mouth of the pit where the lions were kept, and  they threw him in; and over the mouth they placed a stone; and the king  sealed it with his own seal, and with the seals of his nobles; so that  no one might take away the stone and let Daniel out of the den.
