He affected  ruffles, but for want of starch they hung like weeping willows over  hands that were fine and delicate. His breeches were of plain black  cloth, and his black stockings were of cotton--matters entirely out of  harmony with his magnificent coat. His shoes, stout and serviceable,  were decked with buckles of cheap, lack-lustre paste. But for his  engaging and ingenuous countenance, Andre-Louis must have set him down  as a knight of that order which lives dishonestly by its wits. As it  was, he suspended judgment whilst pushing investigation further by a  study of the girl. At the outset, be it confessed that it was a study  that attracted him prodigiously. And this notwithstanding the fact that,  bookish and studious as were his ways, and in despite of his years, it  was far from his habit to waste consideration on femininity.    The child--she was no more than that, perhaps twenty at the  most--possessed, in addition to the allurements of face and shape that  went very near perfection, a sparkling vivacity and a grace of movement  the like of which Andre-Louis did not remember ever before to have  beheld assembled in one person. And her voice too--that musical, silvery  voice that had awakened him--possessed in its exquisite modulations an  allurement of its own that must have been irresistible, he thought, in  the ugliest of her sex. She wore a hooded mantle of green cloth, and the  hood being thrown back, her dainty head was all revealed to him. There  were glints of gold struck by the morning sun from her light nut-brown  hair that hung in a cluster of curls about her oval face. Her complexion  was of a delicacy that he could compare only with a rose petal. He could  not at that distance discern the colour of her eyes, but he guessed them  blue, as he admired the sparkle of them under the fine, dark line of  eyebrows.    He could not have told you why, but he was conscious that it aggrieved  him to find her so intimate with this pretty young fellow, who was  partly clad, as it appeared, in the cast-offs of a nobleman. He could  not guess her station, but the speech that reached him was cultured in  tone and word. He strained to listen.    \"I shall know no peace, Leandre, until we are safely wedded,\" she was  saying. \"Not until then shall I count myself beyond his reach. And yet  if we marry without his consent, we but make trouble for ourselves, and  of gaining his consent I almost despair.\"    Evidently, thought Andre-Louis, her father was a man of sense, who saw  through the shabby finery of M. Leandre, and was not to be dazzled by  cheap paste buckles.    \"My dear Climene,\" the young man was answering her, standing squarely  before her, and holding both her hands, \"you are wrong to despond. If I  do not reveal to you all the stratagem that I have prepared to win the  consent of your unnatural parent, it is because I am loath to rob you of  the pleasure of the surprise that is in store. But place your faith in  me, and in that ingenious friend of whom I have spoken, and who should  be here at any moment.\"    The stilted ass! Had he learnt that speech by heart in advance, or was  he by nature a pedantic idiot who expressed himself in this set and  formal manner? How came so sweet a blossom to waste her perfumes on such  a prig? And what a ridiculous name the creature owned!    Thus Andre-Louis to himself from his observatory. Meanwhile, she was  speaking.    \"That is what my heart desires, Leandre, but I am beset by fears lest  your stratagem should be too late. I am to marry this horrible Marquis  of Sbrufadelli this very day. He arrives by noon. He comes to sign the  contract--to make me the Marchioness of Sbrufadelli. Oh!\" It was a cry of  pain from that tender young heart. \"The very name burns my lips. If it  were mine I could never utter it--never! The man is so detestable. Save  me, Leandre. Save me! You are my only hope.\"    Andre-Louis was conscious of a pang of disappointment. She failed to  soar to the heights he had expected of her. She was evidently infected  by the stilted manner of her ridiculous lover. There was an atrocious  lack of sincerity about her words. They touched his mind, but left his  heart unmoved. Perhaps this was because of his antipathy to M. Leandre  and to the issue involved.    So her father was marrying her to a marquis! That implied birth on  her side. And yet she was content to pair off with this dull young  adventurer in the tarnished lace! It was, he supposed, the sort of thing  to be expected of a sex that all philosophy had taught him to regard as  the maddest part of a mad species.    \"It shall never be!\" M. Leandre was storming passionately. \"Never! I  swear it!\" And he shook his puny fist at the blue vault of heaven--Ajax  defying Jupiter. \"Ah, but here comes our subtle friend...\" (Andre-Louis  did not catch the name, M. Leandre having at that moment turned to face  the gap in the hedge.) \"He will bring us news, I know.\"    Andre-Louis looked also in the direction of the gap. Through it emerged  a lean, slight man in a rusty cloak and a three-cornered hat worn well  down over his nose so as to shade his face. And when presently he  doffed this hat and made a sweeping bow to the young lovers, Andre-Louis  confessed to himself that had he been cursed with such a hangdog  countenance he would have worn his hat in precisely such a manner, so  as to conceal as much of it as possible. If M. Leandre appeared to  be wearing, in part at least, the cast-offs of nobleman, the newcomer  appeared to be wearing the cast-offs of M. Leandre. Yet despite his vile  clothes and viler face, with its three days' growth of beard, the  fellow carried himself with a certain air; he positively strutted as he  advanced, and he made a leg in a manner that was courtly and practised.    \"Monsieur,\" said he, with the air of a conspirator, \"the time for action  has arrived, and so has the Marquis... That is why.\"    The young lovers sprang apart in consternation; Climene with clasped  hands, parted lips, and a bosom that raced distractingly under its white  fichu-menteur; M. Leandre agape, the very picture of foolishness and  dismay.    Meanwhile the newcomer rattled on. \"I was at the inn an hour ago when  he descended there, and I studied him attentively whilst he was at  breakfast. Having done so, not a single doubt remains me of our success.  As for what he looks like, I could entertain you at length upon the  fashion in which nature has designed his gross fatuity. But that is no  matter. We are concerned with what he is, with the wit of him. And I  tell you confidently that I find him so dull and stupid that you may be  confident he will tumble headlong into each and all of the traps I have  so cunningly prepared for him.\"    \"Tell me, tell me! Speak!\" Climene implored him, holding out her hands  in a supplication no man of sensibility could have resisted. And then  on the instant she caught her breath on a faint scream. \"My father!\" she  exclaimed, turning distractedly from one to the other of those two. \"He  is coming! We are lost!\"    \"You must fly, Climene!\" said M. Leandre.    \"Too late!\" she sobbed. \"Too late! He is here.\"    \"Calm, mademoiselle, calm!\" the subtle friend was urging her. \"Keep calm  and trust to me. I promise you that all shall be well.\"    \"Oh!\" cried M. Leandre, limply. \"Say what you will, my friend, this is  ruin--the end of all our hopes. Your wits will never extricate us from  this. Never!\"    Through the gap strode now an enormous man with an inflamed moon  face and a great nose, decently dressed after the fashion of a solid  bourgeois. There was no mistaking his anger, but the expression that it  found was an amazement to Andre-Louis.    \"Leandre, you're an imbecile! Too much phlegm, too much phlegm! Your  words wouldn't convince a ploughboy! Have you considered what they mean  at all? Thus,\" he cried, and casting his round hat from him in a broad  gesture, he took his stand at M. Leandre's side, and repeated the very  words that Leandre had lately uttered, what time the three observed him  coolly and attentively.    \"Oh, say what you will, my friend, this is ruin--the end of all our  hopes. Your wits will never extricate us from this. Never!\"    A frenzy of despair vibrated in his accents. He swung again to face M.  Leandre. \"Thus,\" he bade him contemptuously. \"Let the passion of your  hopelessness express itself in your voice. Consider that you are not  asking Scaramouche here whether he has put a patch in your breeches. You  are a despairing lover expressing...\"    He checked abruptly, startled. Andre-Louis, suddenly realizing what was  afoot, and how duped he had been, had loosed his laughter. The sound  of it pealing and booming uncannily under the great roof that so  immediately confined him was startling to those below.    The fat man was the first to recover, and he announced it after his own  fashion in one of the ready sarcasms in which he habitually dealt.    \"Hark!\" he cried, \"the very gods laugh at you, Leandre.\" Then he  addressed the roof of the barn and its invisible tenant. \"Hi! You  there!\"    Andre-Louis revealed himself by a further protrusion of his tousled  head.    \"Good-morning,\" said he, pleasantly. Rising now on his knees, his  horizon was suddenly extended to include the broad common beyond the  hedge. He beheld there an enormous and very battered travelling chaise,  a cart piled up with timbers partly visible under the sheet of oiled  canvas that covered them, and a sort of house on wheels equipped with  a tin chimney, from which the smoke was slowly curling. Three heavy  Flemish horses and a couple of donkeys--all of them hobbled--were  contentedly cropping the grass in the neighbourhood of these vehicles.  These, had he perceived them sooner, must have given him the clue to the  queer scene that had been played under his eyes. Beyond the hedge other  figures were moving."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19487"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Hereford (#17)"],[1,"decree,  but died in Tuscany on the homeward journey.    As already described, his remains were finally laid with great pomp in the  Lady Chapel.    Five years later the bones of Bishop Cantilupe were moved to the Chapel of  St. Katherine, in the north-west transept. Twice more were they moved,  finally resting in the same Chapel of St. Katherine.    *Richard Swinfield*, A.D. 1283-1316, the next Bishop, had been Bishop  Cantilupe's devoted chaplain. He kept wisely aloof from politics, but  offered a keen resistance to any infringement on the rights of his  diocese. Several boundary questions were settled by Bishop Swinfield, and  in 1289-90 he made a tour through his diocese, of which has come down to  us a journal of daily expenses.    Bishop Swinfield was the probable builder of the nave-aisles and two  easternmost transepts. In his time the \"_Mappa Mundi_\" came into  possession of the Chapter.    He worked hard to obtain the Canonisation of his illustrious predecessor,  but it was not till four years after his death that Pope John XXII.  granted an act for the purpose. He was buried in the cathedral.    *Adam Orleton*, A.D. 1316-1327, was a friend of Roger Mortimer, and  consequently was opposed to Edward II. Throughout the struggle of those  many miserable years the affairs of the diocese were dragged in the mire  of civil war. It was the Bishop of Hereford who, at Neath Abbey, took the  King, carried him to Kenilworth, and deprived him of the Great Seal. The  Queen was staying at Hereford, and thither many of the King's adherents  were taken with the Chancellor and Hugh Despenser. The last-named was  hanged in the town, decapitated, and quartered.    Bishop Adam showed much ability in managing the affairs of the cathedral.  He obtained a grant of revenues of two churches from Pope John XXII. for  monies necessary for the dedication of the Cantilupe shrine, and also for  repairs in the cathedral. He was followed on his translation to Worcester  by    *Thomas Charleton*, A.D. 1328-1343, who was made treasurer of England in  1329. In 1337 he went to Ireland as chancellor. He died in 1343.    *John Trilleck*, A.D. 1344-1360. The Black Death reached Herefordshire in  1349, and Bishop Trilleck is said to have kept it at bay in the city by a  procession of the shrine of the recently canonised St. Thomas of Hereford.    Bishop Trilleck was buried in the cathedral, and a fine brass effigy was  placed on his grave. \"Gratus, prudens, pius\" are among the words which may  be still read from the mutilated inscription, and they appear to have had  more justification than the rhetoric of the average epitaph.                 [Illustration: TOMB OF BISHOP THOS. CHARLETON.]                         TOMB OF BISHOP THOS. CHARLETON.      *Lewis Charleton*, A.D. 1361-1369, was appointed by papal provision. The  Black Death made a second visitation in the first year of his episcopate,  and it was then that the market was removed to some distance from the town  on the west. The \"White Cross\" there placed, which bears the arms of  Bishop Charleton, may mark the spot. He bequeathed money and some books to  the cathedral.    *William Courtenay*, A.D. 1370-1375, was also appointed by papal  provision, which was necessary in consequence of his youth. Although he  had already held a canonry of York and prebends in Exeter and Wells in  addition to the Chancellorship of Oxford University, he was but  twenty-eight years of age. At Oxford he had, with Wicliff, opposed the  friars, though he afterwards turned against his former ally.    *John Gilbert*, A.D. 1375-1389, with partial success, went to make terms  of peace with Charles VI., the French King. He became treasurer of England  in 1386, an office of which he was deprived by Richard II. not long before  his translation to St. David's. Bishop Gilbert founded the Cathedral  Grammar School.    *Thomas Trevenant*, A.D. 1389-1404. An active politician, this Bishop  assisted in the deposition of King Richard II., and was one of the  commissioners to the Pope to announce the accession of Henry IV.    *Robert Mascall*, A.D. 1404-1416, was employed as a foreign ambassador by  Henry IV., who also made him his confessor. He attended the council of  Constance in 1414.    *Edmund Lacy*, A.D. 1417-1420. This Bishop began to build the cloister  connecting the cathedral with the Episcopal palace.    *Thomas Polton*, A.D. 1420-1421, was consecrated at Florence, and the next  year was translated to Chichester.    *Thomas Spofford*, A.D. 1421-1448, Abbot of St. Mary's at York, to which  post he returned on resigning his see in 1448. According to a papal bull  he laid out 2,800 marks on the buildings of the cathedral,--probably  completing the cloisters begun by Bishop Lacy. His pension on retiring was  L100 per annum. The great west window of the cathedral was put up in his  time by William Lochard.    *Richard Beauchamp*, A.D. 1448-1450. Son of Sir Walter, and grandson of  Lord Beauchamp of Powick, he was a great architect in his day, although  his chief work was done after his translation to Salisbury, when he was  appointed by Edward IV. to superintend the works at Windsor which included  the rebuilding of St. George's Chapel where he was buried. It is said he  was the first Chancellor of the Order of the Garter.    *Reginald Buller*, A.D. 1450-1453, Abbot of St. Peter's, Gloucester, was  translated to Lichfield. He was buried in Hereford Cathedral.    *John Stanberry*, A.D. 1453-1474, was a Carmelite friar at Oxford, and was  chosen by King Henry VI. to be his confessor, and also first Provost of  Eton. In 1448 he was made Bishop of Bangor, and five years later was  translated to Hereford. After the battle of Northampton (July, 1460), he  was taken prisoner and was incarcerated for some time in Warwick Castle.  On his release he retired to the convent of his order at Ludlow, where he  died in May, 1474. He was buried at Hereford, near his own Chantry Chapel,  which still bears his name. He gave land from the garden of the bishop's  palace for building a dwelling-house for the vicars choral, which was  completed in 1475.    *Thomas Mylling*, A.D. 1474-1492, the next Bishop, was Abbot of St.  Peter's, Westminster, where he had been a monk. King Edward IV. made him a  Privy Councillor and gave him the see of Hereford in remembrance of his  services to Elizabeth Woodville, whom he received into sanctuary when her  husband had to fly to Holland. After his death his body was carried to  Westminster, and the stone coffin is still there which is said to have  enclosed his remains.    *Edmund Audley*, A.D. 1492-1502, a prebendary of Lichfield, of Lincoln,  and of Wells, was Bishop of Rochester in 1480, translated to Hereford in  1492, and to Salisbury in 1502. The beautiful chantry chapel on the south  side of the Lady Chapel, near the shrine of St. Thomas of Cantilupe, was  founded by him. He also presented a silver shrine to the cathedral, and a  pulpit at St. Mary's, Oxford, is said to be his gift.    *Adrian de Castello*, A.D. 1503-1504. He conducted the negotiations  between Henry VII. and the Pope; and he was translated from Hereford to  Bath and Wells, but never visited either see.    *Richard Mayhew*, A.D. 1504-1516, was made in 1480 the first regular  president of Bishop Waynflete's new College of St. Mary Magdalene at  Oxford. He was also Chancellor of the University, and almoner to King  Henry VII., by whom he had been sent in 1501 to bring the Infanta  Katharine of Aragon from Spain as the bride of Prince Arthur.    He was buried near the effigy of St. Ethelbert on the south side of the  choir, where his tomb is still to be seen.    *Charles Booth*, A.D. 1516-1535, Archdeacon of Buckingham, and Chancellor  of the Welsh Marches, left a lasting memorial in the north porch of the  cathedral, which bears upon it the date of his death. He seems to have  been much in the King's favour, and was summoned in 1520 to make one of  the illustrious company on the Field of the Cloth of Gold. He was attached  to the company of Henry's \"dearest wife, the queen,\" and was accompanied  by thirty \"tall personages.\"    On his death he left some books to the library, as well as a tapestry for  the high altar; also to his successor a gold ring and other articles which  have disappeared.    *Edward Foxe*, A.D. 1535-1538. This \"principal pillar of the Reformation,\"  as Fuller calls him, is said by Strype to have been \"an excellent  instrument\" in its general progress.    A Gloucestershire worthy, having been born at Dursley in that county, he  was sent first to Eton and then to Cambridge, becoming, in 1528, Provost  of King's College. In 1531 he succeeded Stephen Gardiner as Archdeacon of  Leicester. For many years almoner to the King, he was employed in  embassies to France, Italy, and Germany, the most important of these  diplomatic missions being in February, 1527, when he was sent to Rome with  Gardiner to negotiate in the matter of Henry's separation from his  \"dearest wife.\"    Foxe first introduced Cranmer to the King; and he, again, wrote the book  called _The Difference between the Kingly and the Ecclesiastical Power_,  which Henry wished people to think he had partly written himself,  intended, as it was, to make easier his assumption of ecclesiastical  supremacy.    In August, 1536, Bishop Foxe began, by deputy, a visitation of the diocese  for the valuation of all church property therein, in accordance with the  order referred to above. Dr. Coren, his vicar-general, actually carried  out the valuation, and its results are to be found in the pages of _Valor  Ecclesiasticus_, printed by the Record Commissioners in 1802.    In March, 1535-6, an Act was passed by Parliament granting to the King all  religious houses possessing a revenue under L200 per annum. There were  about eighteen houses in the diocese, excluding the cathedral, and of  these only the priories of Wenlock, Wigmore, and Leominster possessed"]]]
