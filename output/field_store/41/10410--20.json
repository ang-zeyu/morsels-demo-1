At its conclusion, he laid his hand on Francis' shoulder.    \"My dear boy,\" he said, \"How can I thank you! You seem to me to be born  to be the preserver of my daughters. I cannot doubt that your suspicion  is correct, and that they are confined in this hut at San Nicolo. How  fortunate that you did not denounce this conspiracy--for conspiracy no  doubt it is--that you discovered, for, had you done so, some other  place would have been selected for the girls' prison.\"    \"I would not be too sanguine, sir. The girls may not be in this hut,  still we may come on some clue there which may lead us to them. If not,  we will search the islands on that side as closely as we have done  those on the mainland.\"    \"Now, shall I send for the gondoliers and set out at once? There are  ten or twelve men in the house, and it is hardly likely that they will  place a guard over them of anything like this strength, as of course  they will be anxious to avoid observation by the islanders.\"    \"I do not think I would do anything tonight, sir,\" Francis said. \"The  gondola that chased us will be on the alert. They cannot, of course,  suspect in the slightest that we have any clue to the hiding place of  your daughters. Still, they might think that, if we were really  pursuing the other gondola, and had recognized the woman Castaldi, we  might bring the news to you, and that a stir might be made. They may  therefore be watching to see if anything comes of it; and if they saw a  bustle and gondolas setting out taking the direction of the island,  they might set off and get there first, for it is a very fast craft,  and remove your daughters before we reach the hut.    \"I should say wait till morning. They may be watching your house now,  and if, in an hour or two, they see all is quiet, they will no doubt  retire with the belief that all danger is at an end. Then, in the  morning, I would embark the men in two or three gondolas, but I would  not start from your own steps, for no doubt your house is watched. Let  the men go out singly, and embark at a distance from here, and not at  the same place. Once out upon the lagoon, they should row quietly  towards San Nicolo, keeping a considerable distance apart, the men  lying down in the bottom as the boats approach the island, so that if  anyone is on watch he will have no suspicion.    \"As I am the only one that knows the position of the hut, I will be  with you in the first gondola. We will not land near the hut, but pass  by, and land at the other end of the island. The other gondolas will  slowly follow us, and land at the same spot. Then three or four men can  go along by the sea face, with orders to watch any boats hauled up upon  the shore there, and stop any party making down towards them. The rest  of us will walk straight to the hut, and, as it lies among sand hills,  I hope we shall be able to get quite close to it before our approach is  discovered.\"    \"An excellent plan, Francisco, though I am so impatient that the night  will seem endless to me; but certainly your plan is the best. Even if  the house is watched, and you were seen to enter, if all remains  perfectly quiet they will naturally suppose that the news you brought  was not considered of sufficient importance to lead to any action. You  will, of course, remain here till morning?\"    \"I cannot do that, sir, though I will return the first thing. There is,  lying on my table, a paper with the particulars and names of the  persons I saw meet in this hut, and a request to my father that, if I  do not return in the morning, he will at once lay this before the  council. I place it there every day when I go out, in order that, if I  should be seized and carried off by Mocenigo's people, I should have  some means of forcing them to let me go.    \"Although I know absolutely nothing of the nature of the conspiracy,  they will not know how much I am aware of, or what particulars I may  have given in the document; and as I could name to them those present,  and among them is the envoy of the King of Hungary, now in the city,  they would hardly dare harm me, when they knew that if they did so this  affair would be brought before the council.\"    \"It was an excellent precaution, Francisco. Why, you are as prudent and  thoughtful as you are courageous!\"    \"It was not likely to be of much use, sir,\" Francis said modestly. \"I  was very much more likely to get a stab in the back than to be carried  off. Still, it was just possible that Mocenigo might himself like to  see his vengeance carried out, and it was therefore worth my while  guarding against it. But, as you see, it will be necessary for me to be  back sometime before morning.\"    \"At any rate, Francisco, you had better wait here until morning breaks.  Your room is not likely to be entered for some hours after that; so  while I am preparing for our expedition, you can go out and make your  way to the Grand Canal, hail an early gondola, and be put down at your  own steps, when, as you have told me, you can enter the house without  disturbing anyone. Then you can remove that paper, and return here in  the gondola. We will start at seven. There will be plenty of boats  about by that time, and the lagoon will be dotted by the fishermen's  craft, so that our gondolas will attract no attention.\"    \"Perhaps that will be the best plan, signor; and, indeed, I should not  be sorry for a few hours' sleep, for Giuseppi and I have been in our  boat since a very early hour in the morning, and were pretty well tired  out before this last adventure began.\"        Chapter 6: The Hut On San Nicolo.      At seven o'clock all was in readiness for a start. Signor Polani set  out alone in his gondola, and picked up Francis, and four men, at a  secluded spot some distance from the house. A messenger had been sent,  two hours before, to the captain of one of the merchant ships lying in  the port. He at once put ten men into a large boat, and rowed down to  within half a mile of the island. Here a grapnel was thrown overboard,  most of the men lay down in the bottom, and the captain, according to  his instructions, kept a sharp lookout to see that no boat left San  Nicolo--his instructions being to overhaul any boat coming out, and to  see that no one was concealed on board it.    There he remained until Polani's gondola rowed past him. After it had  gone a few hundred yards, the grapnel was got up, the men took to their  oars and followed the gondola, keeping so far behind that it would not  seem there was any connection between them.    Francis made for the narrow channel which separated San Nicolo from the  next island, and then directed the gondola to be run ashore, where a  low sand hill, close by, hid them from the sight of anyone on the  lookout. A few minutes later the ship's boat arrived.    Francis now led the way direct for the hut, accompanied by Polani and  six men, while four sailors advanced, at a distance of a hundred yards  on either flank, to cut off anyone making for the water.    \"We may as well go fast,\" he said, \"for we can scarcely get there  without being seen by a lookout, should there be one on the sand hills,  and the distance is so short that there will be no possibility of their  carrying your daughters off, before we get there.\"    \"The faster the better,\" the merchant said. \"This suspense is  terrible.\"    Accordingly, the party started at a brisk run. Francis kept his eyes on  the spot where he believed the hut lay.    \"I see no one anywhere near there,\" he said, as they came over one of  the sand ridges. \"Had there been anyone on the watch I think we should  see him now.\"    On they ran, until, passing over one of the sand hills, Francis came to  a standstill. The hut lay in the hollow below them.    \"There is the house, signor. Now we shall soon know.\"    They dashed down the short slope, and gathered round the door.    \"Within there, open!\" the merchant shouted, hammering with the hilt of  his sword on the door.    All was silent within.    \"Break it down!\" he said; and two of the sailors, who had brought axes  with them, began to hew away at the door.    A few blows, and it suddenly opened, and two men dressed as fishermen  appeared in the doorway.    \"What means this attack upon the house of quiet people?\" they demanded.    \"Bind them securely,\" Polani said, as he rushed in, followed closely by  Francis, while those who followed seized the men.    Polani paused as he crossed the threshold, with a cry of  disappointment--the hut was empty. Francis was almost equally  disappointed.    \"If they are not here, they are near by,\" Francis said to Polani. \"Do  not give up hope. I am convinced they are not far off; and if we search  we may find a clue. Better keep your men outside. We can search more  thoroughly by ourselves.\"    The merchant told his men, who had seized and were binding the two  occupants of the hut, to remain outside. The inside of the hut differed  in no way from the ordinary dwelling of fishermen, except that a large  table stood in the middle of it, and there were some benches against  the walls. Some oars stood in one corner, and some nets were piled  close to them. A fire burned in the open hearth, and a pot hung over  it, and two others stood on the hearth.    \"Let us see what they have got here,\" Francis said, while the merchant  leaned against the table with an air of profound depression, paying no  attention to what he was doing.    \"A soup,\" Francis said, lifting the lid from the pot over the fire,  \"and, by the smell, a good one.\"    Then he lifted the other pots simmering among the burning brands.    \"A ragout of kid and a boiled fish. Signor Polani, this is no  fisherman's meal. Either these men expect visitors of a much higher  degree than themselves, or your daughters are somewhere close.    \"Oh! there is a door.\"    \"It can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17567"],[0,"The Way of the Wild (#17)"],[1,", indeed--tipped tails, and  flew downward--offering no explanation to help one to understand  why--till they dropped, each one entirely on his own hook, apparently,  in or about some gardens, as if they had tumbled out of the sky; and  our thrush, in twenty seconds, had slipped into some apple-trees, and  thence to some laurels round a shed, and--was asleep!  I say \"was  asleep.\"  Out of the starry sky, down, in under, and asleep--all  without emotion, and like a machine.  Now, what is one to make of such  a bird?    He did not see, or, more correctly, did not appear to see--for I do not  know what he saw and what he pretended not to see, really--the lean,  lithe, long, low weasel that passed, climbing and sniffing, beneath  him--within six inches--possibly scenting out a rat.  He did not hear,  or show that he heard, the blackbird--she was rusty, dark brown, as a  matter of actual fact--scream, a piercing and public-spirited scream,  when the very big claws of a little, round, spotted-feathered ball with  wings, like a parody of a cherub--but men call it a little owl,  really--closed upon her and squeezed, or pierced, out her life.  He did  not feel, or let on that he felt, the branches gently sway as two eyes,  glinting back the light of the moon--eyes which were the property of a  \"silver tabby\" female cat--floated among the twigs, looking for him,  him most certainly, whom she seemed faintly to smell, but never saw.    [Illustration: \"A 'silver tabby' floated among the twigs, looking for  him\"]    These things represented tense moments dotted through hours of cold,  dark silence, and the blue-black dome of night arched, and the moon  drifted, all in rigid, cold, and appalling stillness.    Then the wind changed, and our thrush awoke to a \"muggy\" day, under a  soaked, cotton-wool, gray sky, all sodden with streaming showers of  rain.  And, by that token alone, he must have known that he was in  England.  No other climate is capable of such crazy, unwarned,  health-trying changes.  He had come in an icy, practically petrified  silence.  He left in a steaming, swishing, streaming gale.    But that was not before he had been down to scratch like a fowl among  the dead leaves under the privet-hedge for grubs, who \"kidded\"  themselves that they were going to be fine, flashing insects next  summer.  He also prospected a snail or two, and broke through their  fortifications by hammering the same upon a stone.  And, by some magic  process that looked akin to the way in which some men divine water, he  divined a worm out of seemingly bare earth.  It was there, too, and it  came up, not joyfully, but tugged, to be hammered and shaken into  something not too disgustingly alive to be swallowed.    Then, while a robin mounted to a spruce-spire and acted as Job's  comforter to all the birds of the garden by singing--ah, so plaintively  and sweetly!--of the dismal days of frost and snow, he \"preened\"--i.e.  went over and combed every feather, and tested and retested, cleaned  and recleaned, each vital quill.  Then, in one single, watery, weak  stab of apology for sunshine, on the top of a fowl-shed, he surrendered  himself to what, in wild-bird land, is known as the \"sunning reaction,\"  which really consists of giving body and mind utterly to the sun and  complete rest.    And then he left.    Now, it was no chance that he left.  Birds don't do business that way.  To you or me, that location and its climate would have seemed as good  for him to \"peg out a claim\" in as any other.  He knew better.  Something--Heaven alone knows what--within him told him what was  coming.  He had the power to take a draft on the future, and by that  means to save himself--if he could.  Wherefore he flew on  southward--always south.    And six hours after he had gone, the wind swung like a weather-cock,  swung and stopped at northeast, and frost began to grip that garden in  an iron fist that threatened to squeeze the life out of every living  thing in it, and the sky hung like the lid of a lead box.    The thrush flew, with a few halts, practically all day and well into  the night, and the northeast wind and the Frost King chased him south.    He roosted in a great fastness of age-old holly-bushes within a wood,  whose branches were packed with his relations--redwings, thrushes, and  blackbirds, and also starlings--all tired out, all booked for the south.    Some woods seem to hold a curse of gloom.  One cannot say why.  And  this was one of them.  And the tawny owl that nobody saw but everybody  heard, and the white stoat that everybody saw and nobody heard, and the  amorous dog-fox with the cruel bark that everybody saw and heard, did  not, taken together or singly, add to the gayety of the scene.    The thrush was just ahead of the cold when he went to roost in pouring  rain.  In the night, however, the cold had overtaken him, and the  thousand-jeweled beauty of frost-flakes flashed to his waking eye.    He was numbed and puffed out and peevish, and disinclined to move, but  anything was better than sticking about in this roosting-place, this  casual ward and clearing-house of the wild.  The keen starlings were  already off, swinging away, regiment by regiment, with a fine, bold  rush of wings; the blackbirds were dotting the glades; the redwings  were slipping \"weeping\" away, to find soft fields to mope in; and the  pigeon host--what was left alive of it after diphtheria had taken its  toll--had streamed onwards, heading southwest.    _Turdus philomelus_ spelt L-u-c-k for our friend that morn, for he had  not prospected two hundred yards when he came on a place where a  vagrant \"sounder\" of half-grown, domestic, unringed pigs had been  canvassing the wood for beech-mast, acorns, and roots during the night.  The soil was all torn up for a space of about an acre, probably the  only soil for miles--except along streams and by springs--penetrable by  beaks until the sun came out; and the thrush feasted royally upon  hibernating caterpillars and chrysalids that would have become moths,  beetle larvae all curled up and asleep, and other pests; and he must  have done a considerable amount of good in that place during the next  hour or so.    But feasts do not go begging long in a frost-bound wild, even if they  are hidden; and by the time our thrush had driven several other  thrushes away--for he was a jealous feeder--and had been driven away by  blackbirds himself more than once, starlings descended upon the place  with their furious greed, and our thrush concluded that it was about  time to \"step off.\"  The crowded place might become a quick-lunch  resort for some others, not insect-feeders--hawks, for instance--and  was unhealthful for that reason.  Indeed, he had not more than moved  away into the shelter of the rhododendrons when a shadow with a hooked  bill shot round the corner, going like the wind.  He had time to see it  dive like a dipping kite--but it was a sparrow-hawk--and to hear the  death-scream of a feeding blackbird, before he went completely from  that place, and it knew him no more.    Soon after that he sighted the sea, wide-stretched and restless, ahead,  and turned westward parallel with the coast-line, till, in the  afternoon, he came unto \"a land where it was always afternoon\"--a flat,  damp, dwarf-treed, relaxing, gray land, mild, as a rule, and  melancholy--a land full of water.  But for once it was a cold land, and  the thrush realized that the bitter frost had leapt ahead of him, and  that he might now never outstrip it again, perhaps.  I do not know if  he realized, too, that the lead sky, that looked as if it were going to  come down and crush one, meant snow.    In a bare orchard he was attracted by the sight of several blue titmice  and two robins, feeding upon one or two odd apples that had been left  unpicked at the very top of a tree.  It seemed strange and out of place  to behold apples in midwinter like that; but, for some reason, he took  only a few pecks, and his devil prompted him down to peck at some  soaked bread among the violets, and to drink at a spring so exquisitely  encrusted with moss that it looked as if everything, every floating  dead leaf, stone, and root, had been upholstered in plush.    Then Fate struck--hard.    A snap, a thump, and he was bouncing over and over, with an air-rifle  bullet in his thigh.  It was a blow that knocked him half-silly, and he  was down before he knew, but only for a second, because of what he saw.  He beheld a boy, with an air-rifle in hand, running towards him; but  ahead of the boy was the boy's young cat, who evidently had learnt to  look for a meal when the air-rifle went off.    The cat, being young, however, managed to bungle his pounce for the  fraction of a second, and that is long enough for most of the  wild-folk.  Came a mad fluttering, a beating of wings, a quick mix-up,  and, before he knew, that cat found himself frantically chasing that  thrush across the orchard, striking wildly always at a thrush that just  wasn't there, as the latter part flew, part hopped, with every ounce of  strength and agility that clean, hard living had given him, till he was  clear of the trees.  Then--up and away, with his heart in his beak, so  to speak, and his brain whirling, till the orchard lay \"hull down\" on  the horizon, and was only another bitter experience, and a warning,  seared into the bird's memory.    So far, so good.  He had made his escape, had euchred Fate, but--the  payment for laziness, the terrible cess for a momentary lapse from  vigilance, which great Nature, in her grim, wise cruelty, always  demands, had to be met, and the end of it was not yet.    It began, however, now.    The thrush discovered that he was not alone in the air, and that he had  all at once got himself, as it were, fixed in the public eye, and was  \"wanted.\"  A swish in the sky made him look up, to see a rook, with a  leering eye, coming down upon him.  He cleverly \"side-sli"]]]
