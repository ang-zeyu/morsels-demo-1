An imitation of the age of  eighteen months is thus produced in an instant. This process is  technically called to bring beer _forward_, or to make it _hard_.    The practice is a bad one. The genuine, old, or entire beer, of the  honest brewer, is quite a different compound; it has a rich, generous,  full-bodied taste, without being acid, and a vinous odour: but it may,  perhaps, not be generally known that this kind of beer always affords a  less proportion of alcohol than is produced from mild beer. The practice  of bringing beer _forward_, it is to be understood, is resorted to only  by fraudulent brewers.[69]    If, on the contrary, the brewer has too large a stock of old beer on his  hands, recourse is had to an opposite practice of converting stale,  half-spoiled, or sour beer, into mild beer, by the simple admixture of  an alkali, or an alkaline earth. Oyster-shell powder and subcarbonate of  potash, or soda, are usually employed for that purpose. These substances  neutralise the excess of acid, and render sour beer somewhat palatable.  By this process the beer becomes very liable to spoil.    It is the worst expedient that the brewer can practise: the beer thus  rendered _mild_, soon loses its vinous taste; it becomes vapid; and  speedily assumes a muddy grey colour, and an exceedingly disagreeable  taste.    These sophistications may be considered, at first, as minor crimes  practised by fraudulent brewers, when compared with the methods employed  by them for rendering beer noxious to health by substances absolutely  injurious.    To increase the intoxicating quality of beer, the deleterious vegetable  substance, called _cocculus indicus_, and the extract of this poisonous  berry, technically called _black extract_, or, by some, _hard multum_,  are employed. Opium, tobacco, nux vomica, and extract of poppies, have  also been used.    This fraud constitutes by far the most censurable offence committed by  unprincipled brewers; and it is a lamentable reflection to behold so  great a number of brewers prosecuted and convicted of this crime; nor is  it less deplorable to find the names of druggists, eminent in trade,  implicated in the fraud, by selling the unlawful ingredients to brewers  for fraudulent purposes.      _List of Brewers prosecuted and convicted from 1813 to 1819, for  receiving and using illegal Ingredients in their Brewings._[70]    Richard Gardner, brewer, for using adulterating ingredients, 100_l._,  judgment by default.

The effect may be  gradual; and a strong constitution, especially if it be assisted with  constant and hard labour, may counteract the destructive consequences  perhaps for many years; but it never fails to shew its baneful effects  at last. Independent of this, it is a well-established fact, that porter  drinkers are very liable to apoplexy and palsy, without taking this  narcotic poison.    If we judge from the preceding lists of prosecutions and convictions  furnished by the Solicitor of the Excise[72], it will be evident that  many wholesale brewers, as well as retail dealers, stand very  conspicuous among those offenders. But the reader will likewise notice,  that there are no convictions, in any instance, against any of the  eleven great London porter brewers[73] for any illegal practice. The  great London brewers, it appears, believe that the publicans alone  adulterate the beer. That many of the latter have been convicted of this  fraud, the Report of the Board of Excise amply shews.--See p. 129.    The following statement relating to this subject, we transcribe from a  Parliamentary document:[74]    Mr. Perkins being asked, whether he believed that any of the inferior  brewers adulterated beer, answered, \"I am satisfied there are some  instances of that.\"    _Question._--\"Do you believe publicans do?\" _Answer._--\"I believe they  do.\" _Q._--\"To a great extent?\" _A._--\"Yes.\" _Q._--\"Do you believe they  adulterate the beer you sell them?\" _A._--\"I am satisfied there are  some instances of that.\"--Mr. J. Martineau[75] being asked the following    _Question._[76]--\"In your judgment is any of the beer of the metropolis,  as retailed to the publican, mixed with any deleterious ingredients?\"    _Answer._--\"In retailing beer, in some instances, it has been.\"    _Question._--\"By whom, in your opinion, has that been done?\"    _Answer._--\"In that case by the publicans who vend it.\"    On this point, it is but fair, to the minor brewers, to record also the  answers of some officers of the revenue, when they were asked whether  they considered it more difficult to detect nefarious practices in large  breweries than in small ones.    Mr. J. Rogers being thus questioned in the Committee of the House of  Commons,[77] \"Supposing the large brewers to use deleterious or any  illegal ingredients to such an amount as could be of any importance to  their concern, do you think it would, or would not, be more easy to  detect it in those large breweries, than in small ones?\" his answer was,  \"more difficult to detect it in the large ones:\" and witness being asked  to state the reason why, answered, \"Their premises are so much larger,  and there is so much more strength, that a cart load or two is got rid  of in a minute or two.\" Witness \"had known, in five minutes, twenty  barrels of molasses got rid of as soon as the door was shut.\"    Another witness, W. Wells, an excise officer,[78] in describing the  contrivances used to prevent detection, stated, that at a brewer's, at  Westham, the adulterating substances \"were not kept on the premises, but  in the brewer's house; not the principal, but the working brewers; it  not being considered, when there, as liable to seizure: the brewer had a  very large jacket made expressly for that purpose, with very large  pockets; and, on brewing mornings, he would take his pockets full of the  different ingredients. Witness supposed that such a man's jacket,  similar to what he had described, would convey quite sufficient for any  brewery in England, as to _cocculus indicus_.\"    That it may be more difficult for the officers of the excise to detect  fraudulent practices in large breweries than in small ones, may be true  to a certain extent: but what eminent London porter brewer would stake  his reputation on the chance of so paltry a gain, in which he would  inevitably be at the mercy of his own man? The eleven great porter  brewers of this metropolis are persons of so high respectability, that  there is no ground for the slightest suspicion that they would attempt  any illegal practices, which they were aware could not possibly escape  detection in their extensive establishments. And let it be remembered,  that none of them have been detected for any unlawful practices,[79]  with regard to the processes of their manufacture, or the adulteration  of their beer.      METHOD OF DETECTING THE"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19036"],[0,"Germany and the Germans from an American Point of View (#17)"],[1,"of the states  14,880,000,000; and the floating debt amounts to 991,000,000, of which  Prussia alone bears 610,000,000 and the empire 300,000,000. Between  the years 1871 and 1897 a debt of $500,000,000 was incurred, bearing  an average interest charge of 3 3/4 per cent. In the year 1908 the  combined expenditures of the states and of the empire reached the  enormous total of $1,775,000,000. The debt of the city of Berlin alone  in 1910 had reached $110,750,000 and has increased in the last two  years.    For purposes of comparison one may note that our own later national  budgets run roughly to $1,000,000,000. The British budget for 1911 was  $906,420,000. After the French war, speculation on a large scale  ensued. The payment of the $1,000,000,000 indemnity had a bad effect.  As has often happened in America, money, or the mere means of  exchange, was taken for wealth. The earth will be as cold as the moon  before men learn that the only real wealth is health. Many schemes and  companies were floated and after 1873 there was a prolonged financial  crisis in Germany. It is said that bankruptcy and the liquidation of  bubble companies entailed a loss of a round $90,000,000. It was in  1876-7, when Germany was thus suffering, that the policy of protection  was mooted and finally put into operation by Bismarck in 1879. Ten  years later the laws for accident, old age, and sickness insurance  were passed, at the instigation and under the direct influence of the  present Emperor.    The tonnage of steam vessels under 4,000 tons in Great Britain (net  tons) was, some five years ago, 8,165,527; in Germany (gross tons),  977,410; but the tonnage of steam vessels of 4,000 tons and over was  in Great Britain 1,446,486, in Germany 1,119,537! It should be added  that no small part of Great Britain's big ships belong to the American  Shipping Trust, sailing under the British flag. Albert Ballin became a  director of the Hamburg-American line in 1886, and was made general  director in 1900. During his directorship the capital of the line has  been increased from 15,000,000 to 125,000,000 of marks, and the number  of steamers from 26 to 170.    Germany's combined export and import trade in 1880 was $1,429,025,000;  in 1890, $1,875,050,000; and in 1905 it was $3,324,018,000; in 1910,  $4,019,072,250. The German production of coal and coal products in  1910 was the highest in its history, amounting to 265,148,232 metric  tons. It would be easy enough to chronicle the commercial and  industrial strides of Germany during the last quarter of a century by  the compilation of a catalogue of figures. It is not my intention to  persuade the reader to believe in any such fantastic theory as that  the present Kaiser is entirely responsible for this progress. I am no  Pygmalion that I can make an Emperor by breathing prayers before pages  of statistics.    It is only fair, however, in any sketch of the Emperor to give this  skeleton outline of what has taken place in the empire over which he  rules, and which, in certain quarters, it is said, he menaces by his  predilection for war. These few figures spell peace, they do not spell  war, and the ruler who has some 700,000 armed men at his back, and a  navy the second in strength in the world guarding his shores, and a  mercantile marine carrying his trade which is hard on the heels of  Great Britain as a rival, but who has none the less kept his country  at peace with the world for twenty-five years, may be credited at  least with good intentions.    It may be said in answer to this same argument that this building and  training and enriching of a nation are a threat in themselves. True, a  strong man is more dangerous than a weak one; but it is equally true  that a strong man is a greater safeguard than a weak one where the  question of peace is at stake. It is also true that a rich and  powerful man must needs take more precautions against attack and  robbery than a tramp. A tramp seldom carries even a bunch of keys, and  pays no premium on fire, accident, or burglary insurance.    William the Second knows his history as well as any of his people, and  incomparably better than his English, French, or American critics. He  knows that only twenty years after the death of Frederick the Great,  the Prussian power went down before Napoleon like a house of cards,  and that the country's humiliation was stamped in bold outlines when  Napoleon was received in Berlin with the ringing of bells, the firing  of cannons, and he himself greeted as a savior and a benefactor. That  was only a hundred years ago. Is it an indiscretion, then, when the  present ruler, speaking at Brandenburg the 5th of March, 1890, says:  \"I look upon the people and nation handed on to me as a responsibility  conferred upon me by God, and that it is, as is written in the Bible,  my duty to increase this heritage, for which one day I shall be called  upon to give an account; those who try to interfere with my task, I  shall crush\"?    On his accession to the throne his first two proclamations were to the  army and the navy, his third to the people. On the 14th of July, 1888,  he reviewed the fleet at Kiel, and for the first time an Emperor of  Germany and King of Prussia appeared there in the uniform of an  admiral. In April, 1897, Queen Victoria celebrated the sixtieth year  of her reign, and Prince Henry represented Germany, appearing as  admiral of the fleet in an old battle-ship, the King William. On the  24th of April the Emperor telegraphed to his brother: \"I regret  exceedingly that I cannot put at your disposition for this celebration  a better ship, especially when all other countries are appearing with  their finest ships of war. It is a sad consequence of the manoeuvring  of those unpatriotic persons who have obstructed the construction of  even the most necessary war-ships. But I shall know no rest till I  have placed our navy on a par for strength with our army.\" From that  day to this he has gone steadily forward demanding of his people a  strong army and a powerful fleet. He now has both. He has pulled  Germany out of danger and beyond the reach, for the moment at least,  of any repetition of the catastrophe and humiliation of a hundred  years ago. This is a solid fact, and for this situation the Emperor is  largely, one might almost say wholly, responsible.    One hears and one reads criticisms of the Emperor's habit of speaking  and writing of \"my navy.\" It is said that the other states of Germany  have borne taxation to build the fleet, and that it is no more the  Emperor's than that of the King of Bavaria, or of Wuertemberg, or of  Saxony. This is the petty, pin-pricking babble of boarding-school  girls, or of those official supernumeraries who have turned sour in  their retirement. Even the honest democrat is made indignant. If the  German navy is not the work of William the Second, then its parentage  is far to seek; and if the German navy is not proud to be called \"my  navy,\" it is wofully lacking in gratitude to its creator.    No man who looks back over his own career, say of twenty-five years,  but is both chastened and amused. He is chastened by the unforeseen  dangers that he has escaped; he is amused by the certificates of  failure, and the prophecies of disaster, that always everywhere  accompany the man who takes part in the game in preference to sitting  in the reserved seats, or peeking through a hole in the fence. I have  not been honored with any such intimate association with the German  Emperor as would enable me to say whether he has a highly developed  sense of humor or not. I can only say for myself, that if I had lived  through his Majesty's last twenty-five years, I should need no other  fillip to digestion than my chuckles over the prophecies of my  enemies.    It has been said of him that he is volatile; that he flies from one  task to another, finishing nothing; that his artistic tastes are the  extravagant dreams of a Nero; that he loves publicity as a worn and  obese soprano loves the centre of the stage; that his indiscretions  would bring about the discharge of the most inconspicuous petty  official. Others speak and write of him as a hero of mythology, as a  mystic and a dreamer, looking for guidance to the traditions of  mediaeval knighthood; while others, again, dub him a modernist, insist  that he is a commercial traveller, hawking the wares of his country  wherever he goes, and with an eye ever to the interests of Bremen and  Hamburg and Essen and Pforzheim. Again, you hear that he is a Prussian  junker, or that he is a cavalry officer, with all the prejudices and  limitations of such a one; while, on the other hand, he is chided for  enlisting the financial help of rich Jews and industrials. He is  versatile, but versatility is a virtue so long as it does not extend  to one's principles. Every man who has profoundly influenced the life  of the world, from Moses to Lincoln, has been versatile. Carlyle goes  so far as to say: \"I confess, I have no notion of a truly great man  that could not be all sorts of men.\" He speaks French well enough to  address the Academie; he speaks English as well as a cultivated  American, and no one speaks it more distinctly, more crisply, more  trippingly upon the tongue, these days; he preaches a capital sermon;  he is an accomplished binder of books; he is a successful and  enthusiastic farmer, and he is frankly audacious in his loves and  hatreds, his ambitions and his beliefs. He has, in short, no vermin  blood in him at any rate. If you do not like him, you know why; and if  you do, you know why as easily. He even knows what he believes about  woman's suffrage and about God, a rare conciseness of thinking in  these troublous times.    There stands before you a man apparently as sound in mind and in body  as any man who treads German soil; a man of great vivacity of mind and  manner, and of wholesome delight in living; who bears"]]]
