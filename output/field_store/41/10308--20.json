If they do not care  for me, or if they misunderstand my message, they may hate me--at first.  When they do understand, then they adore me.      SENTIMENT VERSUS TEMPERAMENT    \"You can well believe it is far more difficult to sing a recital program  than to do an operatic role. In the recital you are absolutely alone,  and entirely responsible for your effect on the audience. You must be  able to express every variety of emotion and feeling, must make them  realize the difference between sorrow and happiness, revenge or disdain;  in short, make them, for the moment, experience these things. The artist  who can best vivify these varying emotions must have temperament. On the  piano, you may hear players who express sentiment, feeling, fine  discrimination in tone color and shading; but comparatively few possess  real temperament. There is great difference between that quality and  sentiment. The one can be learned, to a certain extent; but temperament  is one's very life and soul, and is bound to sweep everything before it.  Of this one thing I am very sure; the singer cannot express all these  emotions without feeling them to the full during performance. I always  feel every phrase I sing--live it. That is why, after a long and  exhausting program, I am perfectly limp and spent. For I have given all  that was in me. Friends of Sara Bernhardt say that after a performance,  they would find her stretched prone on a couch in her dressing room,  scarcely able to move or speak. The strain of a public appearance, when  one gives one's heart's blood, is beyond words\"; and Madame's upturned  face and expressive gesture denoted how keenly alive she was to this  experience.    After a little pause, I said: \"Let us come down to earth, while you tell  me just how you study. No doubt you do some daily technical practice.\"      MASSAGE THE VOICE    \"Oh, yes, technic is most important; one can do nothing without it. When  I begin to study in the morning, I give the voice what I call a massage.  One's voice cannot be driven, it must be coaxed, enticed. This massage  consists of humming exercises, with closed lips. Humming is the sunshine  of the voice.\" The singer illustrated the idea with a short musical  figure, consisting of three consecutive tones of the diatonic scale,  ascending and descending several times; on each repetition the phrase  began on the next higher note of the scale. \"You see,\" she continued,  \"this little exercise brings the tone fully forward. As you feel the  vibration, it should be directly between the eyes.    \"Now, after you have coaxed the voice forward in this way, and then  opened your lips to sing a full tone, this tone should, indeed must, be  right in the same place where the humming tones were,--it cannot be  anywhere else.\" Madame illustrated again, first humming on one tone,  then letting it out with full resonance, using the vowel Ah, which  melted into O, and later changed into U, as the tone died away. \"This  vibration in the voice should not be confounded with a tremolo, which  is, of course, very undesirable. A voice without vibrato, would be cold  and dead, expressionless. There must be this pulsing quality in the  tone, which carries waves of feeling on it.    \"Thus the singer entices the voice to come forward and out, never  treating it roughly or harshly, never forcing or straining it. Take  pleasure in every tone you make; with patience and pleasure much is  accomplished. I could not give you a more useful tip than this.\"    \"Will you tell me how you learn a song?\" she was asked.    \"I first read over the text and get a good idea of its meaning. When I  begin to study the song, I never separate the music from the words, but  learn both together. I play the piano of course, and thus can get a good  idea of the accompaniment, and of the whole _ensemble_.    \"I feel so strongly that real art, the highest art, is for those who  truly understand it and its mission. A dream of mine is one day to found  a school of true art. Everything in this school shall be on a high plane  of thought. The instructors shall be gifted themselves and have only  lofty ideals. And it will be such a happiness to watch the development  of talent which may blossom into genius through having the right  nurture. I shall watch this work from a distance, for I might be too  anxious if I allowed myself to be in the midst of the work. But this is  my dream, and I hope it will one day come true.\"          XV    =MARIA BARRIENTOS=    BE YOUR OWN CRITIC      It is often remarked that the world has grown far away from coloratura  singing; that what we want to-day is the singing actor, the dramatic  singer, who can portray passion--tear it to tatters if need be--but at  least throw into voice gesture and action all the conflicting emotions  which arise when depicting a modern dramatic character. It is said, with  much truth, composers do not write coloratura parts in these days, since  audiences do not care to listen to singers who stand in the middle of  the stage, merely to sing beautiful arias and tonal embroideries.  Therefore there are very few coloratura singers at present, since their  opportunities are so limited.    To the last objection it can be answered that audiences do still flock  to hear a great coloratura artist, for they know they will hear pure,  beautiful melodies when they listen to the old Italian operas. And  melody proves to be a magnet every time; it always touches the heart.    Again, the coloratura singer is not obliged to stand in the middle of  the stage, while she warbles beautiful tones, with seemingly little  regard for the role she is enacting. The coloratura singer, who is an  artist, can act as well as sing. Tetrazzini, as she moves about the  room, greeting her guests, as she does in _Traviata_ or _Lucia_, can at  the same time keep right on with her florid song, proving she can think  of both arts at once.    It is quite true there are not many coloratura singers of the first rank  to-day. When you have mentioned Galli-Curci, Tetrazzini, Barrientos, and  Frieda Hempel--the last is both lyric and coloratura--you have named all  the great ones who are known to us here in America. There are a couple  of younger artists, Garrison and Macbeth, who are rapidly gaining the  experience which will one day place them in the charmed circle.    [Illustration: MARIA BARRIENTOS]    Consider for an instant the three first named singers. They stand at the  very top of their profession; they are each and all great in their  chosen line, to which they are fitted by reason of their special vocal  gifts. Yet how absolutely different is each from the other! They cannot  even be compared. They all sing the great florid arias, but each with  her own peculiar timbre of voice, her individual nuance and manner of  expression. And it is well this should be so. We would not have all  coloratura singing of the same pattern of sameness or quality, for we  find uniformity is monotonous. There is one peculiar mode of mastery for  Galli-Curci, another for Tetrazzini, still another for Barrientos; each  in her particular _genre_ is unique, apart.    Perhaps this is especially the case with the Spanish prima donna,  Barrientos, who has for several years past come to the Metropolitan for  part of the season. She lives very quietly--almost in seclusion--in the  great city, keeping very much to herself, with her mother and the  members of her household, and does not care to have the simple routine  she plans for herself interrupted by any outside demands on her crowded  days.    Thus it happens that very few come face to face with the Spanish artist  except her personal friends. But once in a while she breaks the strict  rule, and will consent to speak with a serious questioner about her  manner of study, how she happened to take up a musical career, also some  of the characteristics of her country, its people and its musical art.    As her own art of song is most delicate and pure, as her instrument is  the most fragile and ethereal of any of the voices of her class, so the  singer herself is of slight and delicate physique. Her oval face, with  its large luminous eyes, has a charm more pronounced than when seen on  the other side of the footlights. Her manner is simple and sincere, in  common with that of all great artists.    \"Although I always loved singing, I never expected to become a singer,\"  began Mme. Barrientos, as we were seated on a comfortable divan in her  artistic music room. \"As a very young girl, hardly more than a child, my  health became delicate. I had been working very hard at the Royal  Conservatory of Music, in Barcelona, my native city, studying piano,  violin and theory, also composition. I was always a delicate child, and  the close application required for these studies was too much for me.  Singing was prescribed in order to develop my chest and physique; I took  it up as a means of health and personal pleasure, without the slightest  idea to what it might lead.    \"You speak of the responsibility of choosing a good and reliable vocal  instructor. This is indeed a difficult task, because each teacher is  fully persuaded that his method is the only correct one. But there are  so _many teachers_, and some of them do not even sing themselves at  all. Can you imagine a vocal teacher who cannot sing himself, who is so  to say voiceless, unable to demonstrate what he teaches? A piano or  violin teacher must play his instrument, or he will not be able to show  the pupils how it ought to be done. But the vocal teacher thinks to  instruct without demonstrating what he is trying to impart.      BEGINNING VOCAL STUDY WITH OPERA    \"So I did not begin my studies with a regular vocal teacher, but with a  dilettante--I do not know just how you say that in English.

SOUPS UTILIZE LEFTOVERS      In nearly every case when meat is purchased, some bone is paid for.  Too frequently this is either left at the market or thrown away in  the home. Bones, gristle, tough ends, head and feet of chickens, head,  fins and bones of fish, etc., should be utilized for making soup.    If a meat or fish chowder with plenty of vegetable accompaniment is  served, no other meat is required for the usual home meal.    If a cream of dried or fresh vegetables, or a meat stock soup with  plenty of vegetables or cereal content, is served, the amount of meat  eaten with the main course of the meal will be materially lessened.    Soups may be a most economical method of using water in which meat,  fish or vegetables have been cooked; also of utilizing small portions  of leftover meats, fish, vegetables or cereal.    Cream soups are made by cooking vegetables or cereal, then utilizing  the water in which they are cooked as part of the liquid for the soup.  Outer parts or wilted parts of vegetables may be utilized for soups  instead of being discarded. Water in which ham or mutton has been  boiled makes an excellent basis for dried or fresh vegetable soups.  In fact, soup can be made from all kinds of leftovers--the variety  and kind make little difference so long as the mixture is allowed to  simmer for several hours and is properly seasoned.      CREAM SOUP      1/3 cup fat    1/3 cup flour    1 teaspoon salt    1 cup cereal or vegetable    1/4 teaspoon cayenne    1 pt. milk    1 pt. water, in which vegetable or cereal was cooked, or leftover            water in which meat was cooked.    Melt fat, add dry ingredients and, gradually, liquid. When at boiling  point, add vegetables or cereal and serve.      MEAT STOCK    Leftover bits of meat, bone, or gristle may be used alone or with some  fresh meat and bone from shin or neck.    To each 1 lb. of meat and bone, add 1 qt. cold water. Let stand 1  hour. Cover and bring slowly to boiling point and simmer 2 to 3  hours. Remove bones and meat. Let stand until cold. Skim off fat.  Add vegetables cut in small pieces, season as desired and cook until  vegetables are tender. Leftover cereals, as barley, oatmeal, etc.,  vegetables, macaroni, tapioca, sago, etc., etc., may be added for  increased food value.      TOMATO GUMBO SOUP      Bones and gristle from chicken or turkey    2 qts. cold water    1 cup okra    1 tablespoon chopped pimento    1-1/2 teaspoons salt    1/2 cup rice    2 tablespoons fat    1-1/2 cups tomatoes    1/4 cup chopped parsley    Soak bones and gristle in the cold water 1 hour. Then boil slowly 1  hour, in same water. Strain out the bones and gristle and add other  ingredients to the liquor. Boil this mixture slowly 3/4 hour and  serve.      LEGUME SOUP      1 cup dried peas, beans or lentils    3 qts. cold water    1 tablespoon onion pulp    1 ham bone or 1/2 pound smoked sausage    1 teaspoon celery salt    2 teaspoons salt    2 tablespoons flour, plus    2 tablespoons cold water    1/4 teaspoon pepper    1 cup tomato    Wash and soak dried legume over night. In morning drain, add water,  ham bone or sausage and cook very slowly until tender. Add other  ingredients, cook 1/2 hour and serve.      VEGETABLE SOUP      1 qt. boiling water    1/2 cup carrots    1/2 cup cabbage    1 cup potatoes    1 cup tomato juice and pulp    1 tablespoon minced onion    1/4 teaspoon pepper    4 tablespoons fat    4 cloves    1 bayleaf    2 teaspoons salt    4 peppercorns    2 tablespoons chopped parsley    Heat onion, pepper, salt, bayleaf and peppercorns with tomatoes for  20 minutes. Strain. To juice and pulp add other ingredients and cook  slowly 1 hour. Add parsley just before serving.      CREAM OF CARROT SOUP      2 cups diced carrots    2 cups water    1 cup milk    1/8 teaspoon pepper    2 tablespoons fat    2 tablespoons flour    1 teaspoon salt    Cook the carrots in the water until tender. Melt the fat, add dry  ingredients, add gradually the 1 cup water in which the carrots were  cooked and the milk. When at boiling point, serve with a little grated  raw carrot sprinkled over top of soup. Any vegetable, raw or cooked,  may be used in the same way, as cauliflower, cabbage, peas, turnips,  etc.      SALMON CHOWDER      1 cup cooked or canned fish    1 cup cooked potato, diced    1 cup peas    2 tablespoons fat    2 tablespoons flour    1-1/2 teaspoons salt    1/4 teaspoon paprika    2 cups milk    1 cup water from boiled potatoes    2 tablespoons chopped parsley    1 teaspoon onion juice    Melt fat, add dry ingredients and gradually the liquid. When at  boiling point, add parsley and serve.      CHEESE CREAM SOUP      1 cup cheese    2 cups milk    2 tablespoons fat    1-1/4 teaspoons salt    1/4 teaspoon cayenne    1/2 teaspoon celery salt    3 tablespoons"]]]
