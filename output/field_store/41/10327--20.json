Even in fishing the  boys were rivals and a new tin cup was voted to the cadet bringing in  the string that weighed the most.    The rain began about ten o'clock and by noon the water was coming down  in torrents.    \"This is beautiful,\" remarked Tom, as he looked at the puddle in the  company's street.    \"We ought to have dug another ditch to let that water run off,\"  remarked Dick.    \"Well, nobody wants to go out now and dig.\"    \"That is true.\"    Instead of abating the rain became more violent as the afternoon  advanced.    \"This looks as if we were going to have some wind.\" remarked Major  Larry with a doubtful shake of his head.    \"I hope it doesn't blow too heavily,\" said Captain Putnam.    \"Don't you think I had better caution the fellows to pin down their  tents extra hard?\"    \"It would do no harm, Major Colby.\"    \"Then I'll do it,\" said Larry, and issued the order without delay. Some  of the cadets grumbled at being driven out into the wet, but the  majority knew they were doing the work for their own good and went at  it without a murmur.    At about sundown the wind fell and after supper it was as calm as it  had been before the storm started.    \"Told you there wasn't any use of getting wet pounding down stakes,\"  growled Lew Flapp. He had done his work in a slip-shod fashion,  staying out but a minute or two for that purpose.    It still rained, so building camp-fires was out of the question. This  being so, the cadets turned in early, glad to seek the shelter of their  cots and their warm blankets.    An hour went by, when of a sudden the rain increased once more. Then  came a rush of wind that shook all of the tents violently.    \"We are not out of it yet, it would seem,\" said Dick, as he sat up on  his cot to listen to the flapping of the canvas in the company street.    He had hardly spoken when another gust of wind tore down on the camp.  There was a ripping of cloth and a crashing of poles, and then a cry  for help sounded from several places at once.          CHAPTER XIX    A STORM IN CAMP      \"Say, fellows, are we all going up in a balloon!\" cried Sam Rover, as  he rolled off his cot in a great hurry.    One whole side of the tent was loose and the structure was in danger of  tumbling down on the inmates' heads.    \"Help!\" came from the next tent. \"I'm being smothered!\"    \"That's Lew Flapp!\" said a cadet. \"What's up now, Flapp?\" he called  out.    No answer came back, and now canvases could be heard ripping in all  directions.    \"Fasten down the pegs!\" came the order. \"Fasten them down, quick!\"    The cadets were already at work, and Sam and his tent-mates set at  their task with a will, realizing that every moment was precious. While  one student held the peg upright the other would pound it down into the  wet ground with a hammer or the back of a spade.    \"The confounded pegs won't hold,\" cried out one cadet. \"There she  goes!\" and the next instant the tent went flying skyward, to land on  another tent some distance away.    It was still raining \"cats, dogs, and hammer handles\" as Tom Rover  expressed it. All was dark, the only light being that given forth by  the lantern which had not been blown out. Occasionally came a flash of  lightning, followed by the distant rolling of thunder.    \"This is one of the real comforts of camp life,\" said Songbird Powell  sarcastically. \"So much nicer than being under the roof of the Hall,  you know!\"    \"Never mind, Songbird, you need a washing off at least once a year,\"  replied a fellow sufferer.    A minute later came another yell from Lew Flapp. He and his tent-mates  had tried in vain to hold down their canvas. Now it went up with a  rush. One of the peg ropes caught around Flapp's leg and he was dragged  over the wet ground, with his head splashing into every pool of water  that he passed.    \"Help me! I'll be killed!\" roared the tall youth.    The tent was blowing along the company street and half a dozen cadets  ran to the rescue, Tom with them. Some leaped on the canvas, while  others held Flapp. Then the rope was cut with a knife.    \"Wha--what a fearful wind!\" groaned the tall boy, when he could speak.  \"This is the worst storm I ever saw!\"    \"Oh, but I'm sorry I ever came to camp,\" groaned William Philander  Tubbs. \"I'm so wet the water is actually running out of my shoetops!\"    \"Ton't said a vord,\" came from Hans. \"I dink me I half a rifer floating  mine packpone town alretty! Of dis keeps on much longer der whole camp  vos in der schwim, ain't it!\"    \"I reckon we're in the swim already,\" broke in Sam. \"Some of us had  better bring the rowboats up.\"    The high wind lasted for fully half an hour and during that time six of  the tents were literally blown to ribbons, while many others suffered  to a lesser extent. A quarter of the shelters laid flat in the mud, and  nothing could be done with these until the wind went down.    \"It's the worst blow I have seen since we have held our encampments,\"  was Captain Putnam's comment, and he and the teachers went around with  lanterns to aid the students as much as they could.    By three o'clock in the morning the storm was over and the stars began  to peep forth from behind the clouds. As tired as they were the cadets  had to set to work to put up the tents and arrange their cots as best  they could. Camp-fires were lit in half a dozen places and the students  huddled around these to dry themselves and get warm.    \"I guess this is a touch of real army life,\" said Dick. \"And I must say  I don't like it overly much.\"    \"We'll have to make the best of it, Dick,\" answered Tom, who had come  over to see how his brother was getting along.    \"How is Sam?\"    \"Oh, he's all right, although as wet as any of us.\"    \"This storm reminds me of the one we experienced when in the jungles of  Africa,\" went on the eldest Rover. \"Do you remember how it blew, Tom?\"    \"Indeed I do,\" was the answer, as Tom's mind went back to that  thrilling experience, as related in \"The Rover Boys in the Jungle.\"    On the following day the cadets were glad enough to remain in camp,  cleaning out their tents and drying the things that had become wet. But  the storm was a thing of the past and the sun shone as brightly as  ever. Big fires were kept burning, and hot coffee could be had whenever  wanted, so scarcely anybody suffered from the drenching received.    The storm had somewhat disarranged the plans made by Flapp, Rockley,  and their particular cronies. But two days later Flapp, Rockley, and  Pender got permission to go to the village of Oakville, two miles  distant, one to buy some corn salve he said he wanted and the others to  do a little trading.    The boys had collected nine dollars from various members of their crowd  and this was to be spent for liquor, cigars, and for several packs of  cards. All of these things were to be smuggled to the hermit's den  Pender had discovered.    \"We can get enough to last us during the encampment,\" said Flapp. \"And  then we can have a good time whenever we wish, and Captain Putnam will  never suspect what is going on.\"    It did not take the cadets long to reach Oakville, a pretty place  located among the hills. There were a dozen stores, a blacksmith shop,  two churches, and perhaps fifty houses. Beyond were farms in a state of  high cultivation, showing that the inhabitants of that section were  thrifty people.    \"This town is about as slow as Cedarville,\" observed Pender, as they  walked up the single street. \"How folks can idle their lives away in  such a place is what gets me.\"    \"They don't know anything of the joys of city life,\" returned Flapp.  \"Some of these people have never seen the inside of a real theater.\"    As might be expected, the unworthy cadets lost no time in entering one  of the taverns located in Oakville, and here Flapp treated. Then, after  cigars or cigarettes had been lit, they proceeded to buy the things  desired for the den.    \"Laying in quite a stock, ain't ye?\" said the tavern keeper.    \"Oh, we are getting this for the whole crowd,\" replied Pender  carelessly. \"But, say,\" he added suddenly.    \"What is it?\"    \"We don't want you to say anything about our buying this stuff.\"    \"All right, I'll be mum,\" answered the tavern keeper.    From the tavern they proceeded to the general store, where they  purchased the packs of cards and a few other things.    While they were making their purchases two girls came in with a market  basket between them. One was tall and thin and the other short and  rather stout. Yet the girls looked very much alike and were noticeably  pretty.    \"Fine girls,\" whispered Flapp to Rockley, nudging his companion in the  ribs.    \"Yes,\" was the answer, and Rockley began to smile openly on the new  arrivals. As the girls did not appear to notice this, he drew closer  and tipped his cap.    \"Fine day after the storm,\" he said smoothly. \"Yes, very,\" said the  taller of the girls, and turned away.    \"I suppose you belong in Oakville,\" put in Lew Flapp, to the smaller  girl.    \"Yes,\" answered the girl, and turned away to join her companion.    \"We are up to the camp on Pine Island,\" went on Rockley, following the  girls up. \"Have you ever been there?\"    \"Once,\" said the taller girl, and began to purchase some articles from  the clerk behind the counter.    \"You ought to come and take a look at our camp,\" continued Flapp. \"It's  a real interesting sight.\"    \"All the girls are welcome,\" said Pender, feeling he must say  something.    \"We'd be willing to show you the way at any time,\" added Rockley, and  placed his hand on the arm of one of the girls.    \"Please let me be,\" said the girl, and walked away. A moment later she  left the store, and her companion went with her.    \"My, but they were shy!\" laughed Pender. \"Rockley, you didn't make any  impression at all. Nor you either, Flapp.\"    \"Humph! Wonder who they are?\" murmured Lew Flapp.    \"Let's ask the storekeeper and find out.\"    \"Those"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#17)"],[1,"the _Times_ of      January 8th, 1891, on \"Tramps.\"    If further proof were wanted that vagrancy, as far, at least, as  England and Wales are concerned, is very seldom produced by  destitution, it will be found in the following facts. A comparison  between the number of male and female vagrants arrested in 1888 under  the provisions of the Vagrancy Acts shows that there were nearly four  times more male vagrants proceeded against before the magistrates than  female. The exact numbers are males, 40,672; females, 11,464. Although  the numbers charged vary from year to year, the proportion between  males and females always remains very much the same, and it may  therefore be considered as established that men are from three to four  times more addicted to vagrancy than women. If the charges of  prostitution were excluded (they amounted to 6,486 in 1888), it will  be found that the proportion of male vagrants to female is as eight to  one. Looking at this matter _a priori_, we should expect these figures  to be reversed. In the first place women form a considerably larger  proportion of the community than men, and in the second place there  are not nearly so many openings for females in our present industrial  system. Forming a judgment upon these two sets of facts alone, one  would almost inevitably come to the conclusion that women would be  found in much larger numbers among the vagrant class than men. There  are fewer careers open to them in the industrial world; they are less  fitted to move about from place to place in search of work; the pay  they receive in manufacturing and other establishments is, as a rule,  very poor; but in spite of all these economic disadvantages only one  woman becomes a beggar to every four men, or, if we exclude fallen  women, to every eight men. What does this condition of things serve to  show? It is an incontestable proof that at least three-fourths or,  perhaps, seven-eighths of the begging carried on by men is without  economic excuse. If women who are so heavily handicapped in the race  of life can run it to such a large extent without resorting to  vagrancy, so can men. That men fall so far behind women in this  respect is to be attributed, as we have seen, not to their want of  power, but to their want of will. They possess far more opportunities  of earning a livelihood than their sisters, but, notwithstanding this  advantage, they figure far more prominently in the vagrant list. The  only possible explanation of this state of things is that vagrancy is,  to a very large extent, entirely unconnected with economic conditions;  the position of trade either for good or evil is a very secondary  factor in producing this disease in the body politic; its extirpation  would not he effected by the advent of an economic millennium; its  roots are, as a rule, in the disposition of the individual, and not to  any serious degree in the industrial constitution of society; hence,  the only way to stamp it out is by adopting vigorous and effective  methods of repression.    The British Isles are in a position to adopt these measures with  boldness and confidence, for the Poor Law system provides for all  genuine cases of destitution, and in striking at begging with a heavy  hand, the authorities are at the same time doing much to suppress  other kinds of crime. It has to be remembered that the vagrant is a  dangerous person in more ways that one. The life he leads, his habit  of going from house to house, affords him ample opportunities of  noticing where a robbery may he successfully committed. If he does not  make use of the opportunities himself, he is not at all unwilling to  let others who will into his secret for a small consideration. In low  lodging-houses and public-houses of a similar type beggars and thieves  are accustomed to meet, to fraternise, to exchange notes; the beggar  is able to give the burglar a hint, and many a case of house-breaking  is the outcome of these sinister confabulations. Little do many people  imagine when they are doing a good deed, as they believe, to some  worthless, wandering reprobate, that he is at the same moment looking  around, so as to be able to tell a companion how best the house may be  robbed. It is very seldom thieves break into houses without having  received information beforehand respecting them, and the source of  that information is in many instances the vagrant, who has been  knocking at the door for alms a short time before.    One of the principal reasons which makes beggary such a profitable  occupation, and renders it so hard to repress, is the persistent  belief among great numbers of people that beggars are working men in  distress. That, of course, is the beggar's tale, but it is a baseless  fabrication. It is no more the practice of working-men to go about  begging than it is the practice of the middle-class, but until this  elementary fact can be laid hold of by the public all statutory  enactments for the suppression of mendicity will be but partial in  their operation. Speaking from considerable personal experience, as  well as from statistical facts, one is able to affirm that the great  mass of the working population of these islands have nothing whatever  in common with the indolent vagrant; and it is a libel on the  working-classes to assume that a man is a workman to-day and a beggar  to-morrow. As a matter of fact, beggars are recruited from all ranks  of the community, when they are not actually born to the trade. Of  course, the greatest number is drawn from the working population; it  is they who form the immense bulk of the nation, and it is only  reasonable to suppose that they will contribute to the begging  fraternity in proportion to their numbers. But, just as the proportion  of thieves drawn from the working-classes is not greater than the  proportion drawn from the well-to-do classes, so is it likewise with  beggars. The other classes, in proportion to their numbers, contribute  just about as many beggars to the community as the working population,  and such beggars are generally the most hardened and villainous  specimens of their tribe. With the beggar sprung from the working  population one is sometimes able to do something, but a beggar who has  descended from the higher walks of life is one of the most hopeless,  as well as one of the most corrupt creatures it is possible to  conceive. If the public would only allow themselves to realise that  these are the facts respecting vagrancy, and if they would exercise  their knowledge in consistently refusing help to professional  wanderers, the plague of beggars would soon disappear, to the immense  relief and benefit of everybody, not excluding the beggars themselves.    A persistent refusal to assist beggars, while perfectly justifiable in  these islands, is a method which can hardly be adopted in countries  where there is no efficient and comprehensive Poor Law. In such  countries, for instance, an Austria and Germany, where there is no  proper provision on the part of the State for the feeble, the  helpless, the aged, the maimed, begging, on the part of these  unfortunates, becomes, in many cases, an absolute necessity. Recent  statistics,[20] respecting the working of additions to the Austrian  vagrancy laws passed in 1885, would seem to show that numbers of the  genuine labouring population have been in the habit of resorting to  begging when going from place to place in search of employment. To  meet these cases the Austrian Government, in the year just mentioned,  secured the passing of a law for the establishment of what are called  Naturalverpflegstationen, or refuges for workmen on the tramp. These  shelters or refuges are strictly confined to the use of genuine  labourers; the poor of the surrounding neighbourhood are not allowed  to enter them; nor is any one afforded shelter who cannot show that he  has been at work within the previous three months, or who applies  twice for admission in the course of that time. A man must also  produce his papers and be willing to perform a certain amount of work;  in return for this he is allowed to remain at the shelter for eighteen  hours, but not more, and is informed on his departure where the next  station is situated. He is also told if there is any probability of  getting employment in the district and is given the names of employers  in want of men. These institutions are a combination, of the casual  ward and the labour bureau, differing, however, from the casual ward  in rejecting all mere wanderers and accepting genuine workmen alone.        [20] Cf. Conrad's _Handwoerterbuch der Staatswissenschaften_,      i. 928.    It in only in some parts of the Austrian Empire that this system has  as yet been put into operation, for the act is of a permissive  character and is mainly worked by the local authorities. In those  districts of lower Austria where it has been tried, it has so far  produced most satisfactory results; begging has decreased according to  the statistics for 1888, more than 60 per cent. in the course of three  years, while in other parts of Austria, where these institutions are  not yet adopted, it has only decreased 25 per cent. The system has as  yet been in operation for too short a period to enable an opinion to  be formed of its eventual success, but so far it promises well and is  an interesting experiment which deserves to be watched. In any case  the experience derived from the working of this law shows that in  Austria, at least, the workman in search of employment has up till  recently been too often confounded with the habitual beggar, a  confusion highly detrimental to the real interests of the State. One  of the main objects of every well ordered Poor Law system should be to  create as wide a gulf as possible between the begging class and the  working-class; it should do everything possible to prevent anything  like a solidarity of interests between these two"]]]
