He was listening raptly to the torrential speech of the Chinaman  who sat in the chair; and I perceived in his eyes the light of a  sudden comprehension.    As the tall figure of the Chinese doctor came pacing into view again,  Smith, his head below the level of the window, pushed me gently along  the passage.    Regaining the site of the trap, he whispered to me:    \"We owe our lives, Petrie, to the national childishness of the  Chinese! A race of ancestor worshippers is capable of anything, and  Dr. Fu-Manchu, the dreadful being who has rained terror upon Europe,  stands in imminent peril of disgrace for having lost a decoration.\"    \"What do you mean, Smith?\"    \"I mean that this is no time for delay, Petrie! Here, unless I am  greatly mistaken, lies the rope by means of which you made your  entrance. It shall be the means of your exit. Open the trap!\"    Handing the lamp to Smith, I stooped and carefully raised the  trap-door. At which moment, a singular and a dramatic thing happened.    A softly musical voice--the voice of my dreams!--spoke.    \"Not that way! Oh, God, not that way!\"    In my surprise and confusion I all but let the trap fall, but I  retained sufficient presence of mind to replace it gently. Standing  upright, I turned ... and there, with her little jewelled hand resting  upon Smith's arm, stood Karamaneh!    In all my experience of him, I had never seen Nayland Smith so utterly  perplexed. Between anger, distrust and dismay, he wavered; and each  passing emotion was written legibly upon the lean bronzed features.  Rigid with surprise, he stared at the beautiful face of the girl. She,  although her hand still rested upon Smith's arm, had her dark eyes  turned upon me with that same enigmatical expression. Her lips were  slightly parted, and her breast heaved tumultuously.    This ten seconds of silence in which we three stood looking at one  another encompassed the whole gamut of human emotion. The silence was  broken by Karamaneh.    \"They will be coming back that way!\" she whispered, bending eagerly  toward me. (How, in the most desperate moments, I loved to listen to  that odd, musical accent!) \"Please, if you would save your life, and  spare mine, trust me!\" She suddenly clasped her hands together and  looked up into my face, passionately. \"Trust me--just for once--and I  will show you the way!\"    Nayland Smith never removed his gaze from her for a moment, nor did he  stir.    \"Oh!\" she whispered tremulously, and stamped one little red slipper  upon the floor. \"_Won't_ you heed me? _Come_, or it will be too late!\"    I glanced anxiously at my friend; the voice of Dr. Fu-Manchu, now  raised again in anger, was audible above the piping tones of the other  Chinaman. And as I caught Smith's eye, in silent query--the trap at my  feet began slowly to lift!    Karamaneh stifled a little sobbing cry; but the warning came too late.  A hideous yellow face, with oblique squinting eyes, appeared in the  aperture.    I found myself inert, useless; I could neither think nor act. Nayland  Smith, however, as if instinctively, delivered a pitiless kick at the  head protruding above the trap.    A sickening crushing sound, with a sort of muffled snap, spoke of a  broken jaw-bone; and with no word or cry, the Chinaman fell. As the  trap descended with a bang, I heard the thud of his body on the stone  stairs beneath.    But we were lost. Karamaneh fled along one of the passages lightly as  a bird, and disappeared--as Dr. Fu-Manchu, his top lip drawn up above  his teeth in the manner of an angry jackal, appeared from the other.    \"This way!\" cried Smith, in a voice that rose almost to a  shriek--\"this way!\"--and he led toward the room overhanging the steps.    Off we dashed with panic swiftness, only to find that this retreat  also was cut off. Dimly visible in the darkness was a group of yellow  men, and despite the gloom, the curved blades of the knives which  they carried glittered menacingly. The passage was full of dacoits!    Smith and I turned, together. The trap was raised again, and the  Burman, who had helped to tie me, was just scrambling up beside Dr.  Fu-Manchu, who stood there watching us, a shadowy, sinister figure.    \"The game's up, Petrie!\" muttered Smith. \"It has been a long fight,  but Fu-Manchu wins!\"    \"Not entirely!\" I cried.    I whipped the police whistle from my pocket, and raised it to my lips;  but brief as the interval had been, the dacoits were upon me.    A sinewy brown arm shot over my shoulder, and the whistle was dashed  from my grasp. Then came a riot of maelstrom fighting, with Smith and  myself ever sinking lower amid a whirlpool, as it seemed, of  blood-lustful eyes, yellow fangs, and gleaming blades.    I had some vague idea that the rasping voice of Fu-Manchu broke once  through the turmoil, and when, with my wrists tied behind me, I  emerged from the strife to find myself lying beside Smith in the  passage, I could only assume that the Chinaman had ordered his bloody  servants to take us alive; for saving numerous bruises and a few  superficial cuts, I was unwounded.    The place was utterly deserted again, and we two panting captives  found ourselves alone with Dr. Fu-Manchu. The scene was unforgettable:  that dimly-lighted passage, its extremities masked in shadows, and the  tall, yellow-robed figure of the Satanic Chinaman towering over us  where we lay.    He had recovered his habitual calm, and as I peered at him through the  gloom, I was impressed anew with the tremendous intellectual force of  the man. He had the brow of a genius, the features of a born ruler;  and even in that moment I could find time to search my memory, and to  discover that the face, saving the indescribable evil of its  expression, was identical with that of Seti I, the mighty Pharaoh who  lives in the Cairo Museum.    Down the passage came leaping and gambolling the Doctor's marmoset.  Uttering its shrill, whistling cry, it leapt on to his shoulder,  clutched with its tiny fingers at the scanty, neutral-coloured hair  upon his crown, and bent forward, peering grotesquely into that still,  dreadful face.    Dr. Fu-Manchu stroked the little creature and crooned to it, as a  mother to her infant. Only this crooning, and the laboured breathing  of Smith and myself, broke that impressive stillness.    Suddenly the guttural voice began:    \"You come at an opportune time, Mr. Commissioner Nayland Smith and Dr.  Petrie; at a time when the greatest man in China flatters me with a  visit. In my absence from home, a tremendous honour has been conferred  upon me, and, in the hour of this supreme honour, dishonour and  calamity have befallen! For my services to China--the New China, the  China of the future--I have been admitted by the Sublime Prince to the  Sacred Order of the White Peacock.\"    Warming to his discourse, he threw wide his arms, hurling the  chattering marmoset fully five yards along the corridor.    \"Oh, god of Cathay!\" he cried sibilantly, \"in what have I sinned that  this catastrophe has been visited upon my head! Learn, my two dear  friends, that the sacred white peacock, brought to these misty shores  for my undying glory has been lost to me! Death is the penalty of such  a sacrilege; death shall be my lot, since death I deserve.\"    Covertly Smith nudged me with his elbow. I knew what the nudge was  designed to convey; he would remind me of his words--anent the  childish trifles which sway the life of intellectual China.    Personally, I was amazed. That Fu-Manchu's anger, grief, sorrow and  resignation were real, no one watching him, and hearing his voice,  could doubt. He continued:    \"By one deed, and one deed alone, may I win a lighter punishment. By  one deed, and the resignation of all my titles, all my lands, and all  my honours, may I merit to be spared to my work--which has only  begun.\"    I knew now that we were lost, indeed; these were confidences which our  graves should hold inviolate! He suddenly opened fully those blazing  green eyes and directed their baneful glare upon Nayland Smith.    \"The Director of the universe,\" he continued softly, \"has relented  toward me. To-night, you die! To-night, the arch-enemy of our caste  shall be no more. This is my offering--the price of redemption....\"    My mind was working again, and actively. I managed to grasp the  stupendous truth--and the stupendous possibility.    Dr. Fu-Manchu was in the act of clapping his hands, when I spoke.    \"Stop!\" I cried.    He paused, and the weird film, which sometimes became visible in his  eyes, now obscured their greenness, and lent him the appearance of a  blind man.    \"Dr. Petrie,\" he said softly, \"I shall always listen to you with  respect.\"    \"I have an offer to make,\" I continued, seeking to steady my voice.  \"Give us our freedom, and I will restore your shattered honour--I will  restore the sacred peacock!\"    Dr. Fu-Manchu bent forward until his face was so close to mine that I  could see the innumerable lines which, an intricate network, covered  his yellow skin.    \"Speak!\" he hissed. \"You lift up my heart from a dark pit!\"    \"I can restore your white peacock,\" I said; \"I, and I alone, know  where it is!\"--and I strove not to shrink from the face so close to  mine.    Upright shot the tall figure; high above his head Fu-Manchu threw his  arms--and a light of exaltation gleamed in the now widely-opened,  catlike eyes.    \"Oh, god!\" he screamed frenziedly. \"Oh, god of the Golden Age! like a  phoenix I arise from the ashes of myself!\" He turned to me. \"Quick!  Quick! make your bargain! End my suspense!\"    Smith stared at me like a man dazed; but, ignoring him, I went on:    \"You will release me, now, immediately. In another ten minutes it will  be too late; my friend will remain. One of your--servants--can  accompany me, and give the signal when I return with the peacock. Mr.  Nayland Smith and yourself, or another, will join me at the corner of  the street "]]]
