Thou must be ready alike for suffering or rejoicing.  Thou must be poor and needy as willingly as full and rich.\"    4. Lord, I will willingly bear for Thee whatsoever Thou wilt have  to come upon me.  Without choice I will receive from Thy hand  good and evil, sweet and bitter, joy and sadness, and will give  Thee thanks for all things which shall happen unto me.  Keep me  from all sin, and I will not fear death nor hell.  Only cast me  not away for ever, nor blot me out of the book of life.  Then no  tribulation which shall come upon me shall do me hurt.      CHAPTER XVIII    That temporal miseries are to be borne patiently after the  example of Christ    \"My Son!  I came down from heaven for thy salvation; I took upon  Me thy miseries not of necessity, but drawn by love that thou  mightest learn patience and mightest bear temporal miseries  without murmuring.  For from the hour of My birth, until My death  upon the Cross, I ceased not from bearing of sorrow; I had much  lack of temporal things; I oftentimes heard many reproaches  against Myself; I gently bore contradictions and hard words; I  received ingratitude for benefits, blasphemies for My miracles,  rebukes for My doctrine.\"    2. Lord, because Thou wast patient in Thy life, herein most of  all fulfilling the commandment of Thy Father, it is well that I,  miserable sinner, should patiently bear myself according to Thy  will, and as long as Thou wilt have it so, should bear about with  me for my salvation, the burden of this corruptible life.  For  although the present life seemeth burdensome, it is nevertheless  already made very full of merit through Thy grace, and to those  who are weak it becometh easier and brighter through Thy example  and the footsteps of Thy saints; but it is also much more full of  consolation than it was of old, under the old Testament, when the  gate of heaven remained shut; and even the way to heaven seemed  more obscure when so few cared to seek after the heavenly  kingdom.  But not even those who were then just and in the way of  salvation were able, before Thy Passion and the ransom of Thy  holy Death, to enter the kingdom of heaven.    3. Oh what great thanks am I bound to give Thee, who hast  vouchsafed to show me and all faithful people the good and right  way to Thine eternal kingdom, for Thy way is our way, and by holy  patience we walk to Thee who art our Crown.  If Thou hadst not  gone before and taught us, who would care to follow?  Oh, how far  would they have gone backward if they had not beheld Thy glorious  example!  Behold we are still lukewarm, though we have heard of  Thy many signs and discourses; what would become of us if we had  not such a light to help us follow Thee?      CHAPTER XIX    Of bearing injuries, and who shall be approved as truly patient    \"What sayest thou, My Son?  Cease to complain; consider My  suffering and that of My saints.  Thou hast not yet resisted unto  blood.(1)  It is little which thou sufferest in comparison with  those who have suffered so many things, have been so strongly  tempted, so grievously troubled, so manywise proved and tried.  Thou oughtest therefore to call to mind the more grievous  sufferings of others that thou mightest bear thy lesser ones more  easily, and if they seem not to thee little, see that it is not  thy impatience which is the cause of this.  But whether they be  little or whether they be great, study to bear them all with  patience.    2. \"So far as thou settest thyself to bear patiently, so far thou  dost wisely and art deserving of the more merit; thou shalt also  bear the more easily if thy mind and habit are carefully trained  hereunto.  And say not 'I cannot bear these things from such a  man, nor are things of this kind to be borne by me, for he hath  done me grievous harm and imputeth to me what I had never  thought: but from another I will suffer patiently, such things as  I see I ought to suffer.'  Foolish  is such a thought as this,  for it considereth not the virtue of patience, nor by whom that  virtue is to be crowned, but it rather weigheth persons and  offences against self.    3. \"He is not truly patient who will only suffer as far as  seemeth right to himself and from whom he pleaseth.  But the  truly patient man considereth not by what man he is tried,  whether by one above him, or by an equal or inferior, whether by  a good and holy man, or a perverse and unworthy; but  indifferently from every creature, whatsoever or how often soever  adversity happeneth to him, he gratefully accepteth all from the  hand of God and counteth it great gain: for with God nothing  which is borne for His sake, however small, shall lose its  reward.    4. \"Be thou therefore ready for the fight if thou wilt have the  victory.  Without striving thou canst not win the crown of  patience; if thou wilt not suffer thou refusest to be crowned.  But if thou desirest to be crowned, strive manfully, endure  patiently.  Without labour thou drawest not near to rest, nor  without fighting comest thou to victory.\"    5. Make possible to me, O Lord, by grace what seemeth impossible  to me by nature.  Thou knowest how little I am able to bear, and  how quickly I am cast down when a like adversity riseth up  against me.  Whatsoever trial of tribulation may come to me, may  it become unto me pleasing and acceptable, for to suffer and be  vexed for Thy sake is exceeding healthful to the soul.    (1) Hebrews xii. 4.      CHAPTER XX    Of confession of our infirmity and of the miseries of this life    I will acknowledge my sin unto Thee;(1) I will confess to Thee,  Lord, my infirmity.  It is often a small thing which casteth me  down and maketh me sad.  I resolve that I will act bravely, but  when a little temptation cometh, immediately I am in a great  strait.  Wonderfully small sometimes is the matter whence a  grievous temptation cometh, and whilst I imagine myself safe for  a little space; when I am not considering, I find myself often  almost overcome by a little puff of wind.    2. Behold, therefore, O Lord, my humility and my frailty, which  is altogether known to Thee.  Be merciful unto me, and draw me  out of the mire that I sink not,(2) lest I ever remain cast down.  This is what frequently throweth me backward and confoundeth me  before Thee, that I am so liable to fall, so weak to resist my  passions.  And though their assault is not altogether according  to my will, it is violent and grievous, and it altogether  wearieth me to live thus daily in conflict.  Herein is my  infirmity made known to me, that hateful fancies always rush in  far more easily than they depart.    3. Oh that Thou, most mighty God of Israel, Lover of all faithful  souls, wouldst look upon the labour and sorrow of Thy servant,  and give him help in all things whereunto he striveth.  Strengthen me with heavenly fortitude, lest the old man, this  miserable flesh, not being yet fully subdued to the spirit,  prevail to rule over me; against which I ought to strive so long  as I remain in this most miserable life.  Oh what a life is this,  where tribulations and miseries cease not, where all things are  full of snares and of enemies, for when one tribulation or  temptation goeth, another cometh, yea, while the former conflict  is yet raging others come more in number and unexpected.    4. And how can the life of man be loved, seeing that it hath so  many bitter things, that it is subjected to so many calamities  and miseries.  How can it be even called life, when it produces  so many deaths and plagues?  The world is often reproached  because it is deceitful and vain, yet notwithstanding it is not  easily given up, because the lusts of the flesh have too much  rule over it.  Some draw us to love, some to hate.  The lust of  the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, these  draw to love of the world; but the punishments and miseries which  righteously follow these things, bring forth hatred of the world  and weariness.    5. But, alas! an evil desire conquereth a mind given to the  world, and thinketh it happiness to be under the nettles(3)  because it savoureth not nor perceiveth the sweetness of God nor  the inward gracefulness of virtue.  But they who perfectly  despise the world and strive to live unto God in holy discipline,  these are not ignorant of the divine sweetness promised to all  who truly deny themselves and see clearly how grievously the  world erreth, and in how many ways it is deceived.    (1) Psalm xxxii. 5.   (2) Psalm lix. 16.   (3) Job xxx. 7.      CHAPTER XXI    That we must rest in God above all goods and gifts    Above all things and in all things thou shalt rest alway in the  Lord, O my soul, for he himself is the eternal rest of the  saints.  Grant me, most sweet and loving Jesus, to rest in Thee  above every creature, above all health and beauty, above all  glory and honour, above all power and dignity, above all  knowledge and skilfulness, above all riches and arts, above all  joy and exultation, above all fame and praise, above all  sweetness and consolation, above all hope and promise, above all  merit and desire, above all gifts and rewards which Thou canst  give and pour forth, above all joy and jubilation which the mind  is able to receive and feel; in a word, above Angels and  Archangels and all the army of heaven, above all things visible  and invisible, and above everything which Thou, O my God, art  not.    2. For Thou, O Lord, my God, art best above all things; Thou only  art the Most High, Thou only the Almighty, Thou only the  All-sufficient, and the Fulness of all things; Thou only the  All-delightsome and the All-comforting; Thou alone the altogether  lovely and altogether loving; Thou alone the Most Exalted and  Most Glorious above all things; in Whom all things are, and were,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16531"],[0,"Old St. Paul's Cathedral (#17)"],[1,"time being. Not only our Reformers,  who did not require aisles for processions nor rich choirs, but  the Jesuits also, who had sprung suddenly into mighty power on the  Continent, repudiated mediaeval art, and strove to adapt the classical  reaction in Europe to their own tenets. Nearly all the Jesuit churches  abroad are classical.    It was, no doubt, fortunate that Inigo Jones confined his work at St.  Paul's to some very poor additions to the transepts, and to a portico,  very magnificent in its way, at the west end. He would have destroyed,  doubtless, much of the noble nave in time; but his work was abruptly  brought to an end by the outbreak of the Civil War. The work had  languished for some years, under the continuance of causes which I  have already adduced. But Laud, as Bishop of London, had displayed  most praiseworthy zeal, and King Charles had supported him generously.  When the troubles began, the funds ceased. In 1640 there had been  contributions amounting to L10,000. In 1641 they fell to less than  L2000; in 1643 to L15. In 1642 Paul's Cross had been pulled down,  and in the following March Parliament seized on the revenues of the  cathedral.    With the Rebellion the history of the cathedral may be said to be a  blank. It would have been troublesome and expensive to pull it down,  so it was left to decay; the revenues were seized for military uses,  and the sacred vessels sold. There is a doubtful tradition that  Cromwell tried to sell the building to the Jews for a stately  synagogue. Inigo Jones's portico was let out for shops, the nave was  turned into cavalry barracks. An order, quoted by Sir Henry Ellis,  of which there is a copy in the British Museum, came out in 1651  prohibiting the soldiers from playing at ninepins from nine p.m. till  six a.m., as the noise disturbs the residents in the neighbourhood,  and they are also forbidden to disturb the peaceable passers by. At  the Church of St. Gregory by St. Paul, towards the latter part of  Cromwell's life, it is said that the liturgy of the Church was  regularly used, through the influence of his daughter, Elizabeth  Claypole, and not only so, but that he used sometimes to attend it  under the same auspices.    Once more before the catastrophe let us pause and see what monuments  had been erected in the Cathedral since the Stuarts mounted the  throne. Dean VALENTINE CAREY was also Bishop of Exeter, d. 1626, a  High Churchman, He \"imprudently commended the soul of a dead person to  the mercies of God, which he was forced to retract.\" There was a brass  to him with mitre and his arms, but no figure.    Then we come to a monument which has a very great and unique interest,  that of Dr. John Donne, who was Dean from 1621 to 1631. It is hardly  needful to say that his life is the first in the beautiful set of  biographies by his friend, Izaak Walton. But it seems only right to  quote Walton's account of this monument. The Dean knew that he was  dying, and his friends expressed their desire to know his wishes. He  sent for a carver to make for him in wood the figure of an urn, giving  him directions for the compass and height of it, and to bring with  it a board, of the just height of his body. \"These being got, then  without delay a choice painter was got to be in readiness to draw his  picture, which was taken as followeth:--Several charcoal fires being  first made in his large study, he brought with him into that place his  winding-sheet in his hand, and, having put off all his clothes, had  this sheet put on him, and so tied with knots at his head and feet,  and his hands so placed as dead bodies are usually fitted to be  shrouded and put into their coffin or grave. Upon this urn he thus  stood, with his eyes shut, and with so much of the sheet turned aside  as might show his lean, pale, and death-like face, which was purposely  turned towards the East, from whence he expected the second coming of  his and our Saviour Jesus.\" In this posture he was drawn at his just  height; and when the picture was fully finished, he caused it to be  set by his bedside, where it continued, and became his hourly object  till his death, and was then given to his dearest friend and executor,  Dr. Henry King, then chief Residentiary of St. Paul's, who caused  him to be thus carved in one entire piece of white marble, as it now  stands in that church; and, by Dr. Donne's own appointment, these  words were affixed to it as an epitaph:--      JOHANNES DONNE    Sac. Theol. Profess.    Post varia studia, quibus ab annis    Tenerrimis fideliter, nec infeliciter    incubuit;    Instinctu et impulsu Spiritus Sancti, monitu    et hortatu    Regis Jacobi, ordines sacros amplexus    Anno sui Jesu, MDCXIV. et suae aetatis XLII    Decanatu hujus ecclesiae indutus,    XXVII.

The unique interest attaching to this monument is in the fact that it  was saved from the ruins of the old cathedral and now adorns the wall  of the south choir aisle.    There are three more Bishops of this later period.    JOHN STOKESLEY (1530-1539) distinguished himself by his zeal in  burning Bibles, and using all his influence on the side of Henry VIII.  on the divorce, by his burning of heretics, and by his desire to burn  Latimer. Froude tells the whole story with vivid pen. Stokesley was  buried in St. George's Chapel in the N.E. corner of the cathedral. He  was the last of the pre-Reformation bishops buried in St. Paul's.    THOMAS RAVIS (1607-1610) was buried in the N. Aisle, with simply  a plain grave-stone telling that he was born at Malden in Surrey,  educated at Westminster and Oxford, Dean of Christ Church and Bishop  of Gloucester. But a most vigorous epitaph of him was written by his  friend and successor at Christ Church, Bishop Corbet, namely, a poem  in which extolling his virtues and his piety, he declares that it is  better to keep silence over his grave, considering the profanation  which is daily going on in the cathedral, the \"hardy ruffians,  bankrupts, vicious youths,\" who daily go up and down Paul's Walk,  swearing, cheating, and slandering. And he sums up thus:--      \"And wisely do thy grieved friends forbear    Bubbles and alabaster boys to rear    On thy religious dust, for men did know    Thy life, which such illusions cannot show.\"    JOHN KING (1611-1621) was the last bishop buried in Old St. Paul's.    Some of the greatest English painters are buried in the present  cathedral. In Old St. Paul's rested the bones of Van Dyck, who may  almost be called the founder of English portrait painting, though he  was a foreigner by birth, and only an adopted Englishman. He was born  in Antwerp in 1599, became a pupil of Rubens, and, by general consent,  surpassed him in portrait painting. In this branch of art he is  probably unrivalled. He took up his residence in England in 1632, and  was knighted by Charles I. He died at a house which that King had  given him at Blackfriars, December 9th, 1641, and was buried close by  John of Gaunt.    We must not omit mention of John Tomkins, Organist of the Cathedral.  He died in 1638. His epitaph says that he was the most celebrated  organist of his time. He succeeded Orlando Gibbons at King's College,  Cambridge, in 1606, and came to St. Paul's in 1619. His compositions,  though good, are not numerous, but he is said to have been a wonderful  executant.    But we must now approach the final scenes of Old St. Paul's. At the  Restoration, Sheldon was made Bishop of London, and two years later,  on his translation to Canterbury, was succeeded by Humphrey Henchman,  a highly respectable man, who owed his elevation to his loyalty to the  Stuarts during the Commonwealth. He took no part in public affairs,  but was a liberal contributor to the funds of the cathedral. The Dean,  John Barwick, was a good musician, and restored the choir of the  cathedral to decent and orderly condition. But it was soon found that  the building was in an insecure, indeed dangerous condition, and it  became a pressing duty to put it in safe order. Inigo Jones had died  in 1652, and the Dean, Sancroft, who had succeeded Barwick in 1664,  called on Dr. Christopher Wren to survey the cathedral and report upon  it.    This famous man was the son of the Rector of East Knoyle, in Wilts,  and was born in 1632. His father had some skill in architecture, for  he put a new roof to his church, and he taught his son to draw, an art  in which he displayed extraordinary skill and taste. He was sent  to Westminster School, and, under the famous Busby, became a good  scholar. Then he went to Wadham College, Oxford, the Master of which,  Wilkins, aftewards (sic) Bishop of Chester, was a great master of  science. Wren took advantage of his opportunities, and became so  well known for his acquirements in mathematics and his successful  experiments in natural science that he was elected to a Fellowship at  All Souls'. A few years later he was appointed to the Professorship of  Astronomy at Gresham College, and his brilliant reputation made his  rooms a meeting-place of the men who subsequently founded the Royal  Society. A fresh preferment, that to the Chair of Savilian Professor  of Astronomy at Oxford, did not hinder him from pursuing a fresh line.  His father, as we have said, taught him to draw, his"]]]
