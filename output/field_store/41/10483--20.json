Strife and confusion, however bewildering, must never befog their vision.  Tribulations, however afflictive, must never shatter their resolve.  Denunciations, however clamorous, must never sap their loyalty. Upheavals,  however cataclysmic, must never deflect their course. The present Plan,  embodying the budding hopes of a departed Master, must be pursued,  relentlessly pursued, whatever may befall them in the future, however  distracting the crises that may agitate their country or the world. Far  from yielding in their resolve, far from growing oblivious of their task,  they should, at no time, however much buffeted by circumstances, forget  that the synchronization of such world-shaking crises with the progressive  unfoldment and fruition of their divinely appointed task is itself the  work of Providence, the design of an inscrutable Wisdom, and the purpose  of an all-compelling Will, a Will that directs and controls, in its own  mysterious way, both the fortunes of the Faith and the destinies of men.  Such simultaneous processes of rise and of fall, of integration and of  disintegration, of order and chaos, with their continuous and reciprocal  reactions on each other, are but aspects of a greater Plan, one and  indivisible, whose Source is God, whose author is Baha'u'llah, the theater  of whose operations is the entire planet, and whose ultimate objectives  are the unity of the human race and the peace of all mankind.    Reflections such as these should steel the resolve of the entire Baha'i  community, should dissipate their forebodings, and arouse them to  rededicate themselves to every single provision of that Divine Charter  whose outline has been delineated for them by the pen of 'Abdu'l-Baha. The  Seven Year Plan, as already stated, is but the initial stage, a  stepping-stone to the unfoldment of the implications of this Charter. The  impulse, originally generated through the movement of that pen, and which  is now driving forward, with increasing momentum, the machinery of the  Seven Year Plan, must, in the opening years of the next century, be  further accelerated, and impel the American Baha'i community to launch  further stages in the unfoldment of the Divine Plan, stages that will  carry it far beyond the shores of the Northern Hemisphere, into lands and  among peoples where that community's noblest acts of heroism are to be  performed.    Let anyone inclined to doubt the course which this enviable community is  destined to follow, turn to and meditate upon these words of 'Abdu'l-Baha,  enshrined, for all time, in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, and addressed  to the entire community of the believers of the United States and Canada:  \"The full measure of your success,\" He informs them, \"is as yet  unrevealed, its significance still unapprehended. Erelong, ye will, with  your own eyes, witness how brilliantly every one of you, even as a shining  star, will radiate, in the firmament of your country, the light of Divine  Guidance, and will bestow upon its people the glory of an everlasting  life.... The range of your future achievements still remains undisclosed.  I fervently hope that in the near future the whole earth may be stirred  and shaken by the results of your achievements. The hope, therefore, which  'Abdu'l-Baha cherishes for you is that the same success which has attended  your efforts in America may crown your endeavors in other parts of the  world, that through you the fame of the Cause of God may be diffused  throughout the East and the West, and the advent of the Kingdom of the  Lord of Hosts be proclaimed in all the five continents of the globe.\" \"The  moment,\" He most significantly adds, \"this Divine Message is carried  forward by the American believers from the shores of America, and is  propagated throughout the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa, and of  Australasia, and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community will  find itself securely established upon the throne of an everlasting  dominion. Then will all the peoples of the world witness that this  community is spiritually illumined and divinely guided. Then will the  whole earth resound with the praises of its majesty and greatness.\"    No reader of these words, so vibrant with promises that not even the  triumphant consummation of the Seven Year Plan can fulfill, can expect a  community that has been raised so high, and endowed so richly, to remain  content with any laurels it may win in the immediate future. To rest upon  such laurels would indeed be tantamount to a betrayal of the trust placed  in that community by 'Abdu'l-Baha. To cut short the chain of victories  that must lead it on to that supreme triumph when \"the whole earth may be  stirred and shaken\" by the results of its achievements would shatter His  hopes. To vacillate, and fail to \"propagate through the continents of  Europe, of Asia, of Africa, and of Australasia, and as far as the islands  of the Pacific\" a Message so magnificently proclaimed by it in the  American continent would deprive it of the privilege of being \"securely  established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion.\" To forfeit the  honor of proclaiming \"the advent of the Kingdom of the Lord of Hosts\" in  \"all the five continents of the globe\" would silence those \"praises of its  majesty and greatness\" that otherwise would echo throughout \"the whole  earth.\"    Such vacillation, failure, or neglect, the American believers, the  ambassadors of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, will, I am firmly convinced,  never permit. Such a trust will never be betrayed, such hopes can never be  shattered, such a privilege will never be forfeited, nor will such praises  remain unuttered. Nay rather the present generation of this blessed, this  repeatedly blessed, community will go from strength to strength, and will  hand on, as the first century draws to a close, to the generations that  must succeed it in the second the torch of Divine Guidance, undimmed by  the tempestuous winds that must blow upon it, that they in turn, faithful  to the wish and mandate of 'Abdu'l-Baha, may carry that torch, with that  self-same vigor, fidelity, and enthusiasm, to the darkest and remotest  corners of the earth.    Dearly beloved friends! I can do no better, eager as I am to extend to  every one of you any assistance in my power that may enable you to  discharge more effectively your divinely appointed, continually  multiplying duties, than to direct your special attention, at this  decisive hour, to these immortal passages, gleaned in part from the great  mass of Baha'u'llah's unpublished and untranslated writings. Whether in  His revelation of the station and functions of His loved ones, or His  eulogies of the greatness of His Cause, or His emphasis on the paramount  importance of teaching, or the dangers which He foreshadows, the counsels  He imparts, the warnings He utters, the vistas He discloses, and the  assurances and promises He gives, these dynamic and typical examples of  Baha'u'llah's sublime utterance, each having a direct bearing on the tasks  which actually face or lie ahead of the American Baha'i community, cannot  fail to produce on the minds and hearts of any one of its members, who  approaches them with befitting humility and detachment, such powerful  reactions as to illuminate his entire being and intensify tremendously his  daily exertions.    \"O friends! Be not careless of the virtues with which ye have been  endowed, neither be neglectful of your high destiny.... Ye are the stars  of the heaven of understanding, the breeze that stirreth at the break of  day, the soft-flowing waters upon which must depend the very life of all  men, the letters inscribed upon His sacred scroll.\" \"O people of Baha! Ye  are the breezes of spring that are wafted over the world. Through you We  have adorned the world of being with the ornament of the knowledge of the  Most Merciful. Through you the countenance of the world hath been wreathed  in smiles, and the brightness of His light shone forth. Cling ye to the  Cord of steadfastness, in such wise that all vain imaginings may utterly  vanish. Speed ye forth from the horizon of power, in the name of your  Lord, the Unconstrained, and announce unto His servants, with wisdom and  eloquence, the tidings of this Cause, whose splendor hath been shed upon  the world of being. Beware lest anything withhold you from observing the  things prescribed unto you by the Pen of Glory, as it moved over His  Tablet with sovereign majesty and might. Great is the blessedness of him  that hath hearkened to its shrill voice, as it was raised, through the  power of truth, before all who are in heaven and all who are on earth....  O people of Baha! The river that is Life indeed hath flowed for your  sakes. Quaff ye in My name, despite them that have disbelieved in God, the  Lord of Revelation. We have made you to be the hands of Our Cause. Render  ye victorious this Wronged One, Who hath been sore-tried in the hands of  the workers of iniquity. He, verily, will aid everyone that aideth Him,  and will remember everyone that remembereth Him. To this beareth witness  this Tablet that hath shed the splendor of the loving-kindness of your  Lord, the All-Glorious, the All-Compelling.\" \"Blessed are the people of  Baha! God beareth Me witness! They are the solace of the eye of creation.  Through them the universes have been adorned, and the Preserved Tablet  embellished. They are the ones who have sailed on the ark of complete  independence, with their faces set towards the Dayspring of Beauty. How  great is their blessedness that they have attained unto what their Lord,  the Omniscient, the All-Wise, hath willed. Through their light the heavens  have been adorned, and the faces of those that have drawn nigh unto Him  made to shine.\" \"By the sorrows which afflict the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19252"],[0,"Bahá'í Administration (#17)"],[1," their distinct share towards the uplift and the advancement of their  brethren and sisters in that land.    Concerning the magazine ... I feel we must make it unmistakably plain to  those in charge of it that the Baha'is would gladly and gratefully respond  to the invitation to cooperate with those that are responsible for it  immediately they are fully satisfied that nothing is or will be published  by them, whether in the magazine or elsewhere, that would, however  indirectly, prejudice or reflect upon their conception of what the Baha'i  Movement is or stands for. Should this be refused, and unfriendly and  harmful matters be published against them, the attitude of all of us  should be a definite refusal to help and absolute non-interference, as  well as the absence of any form of retaliation which will instead of  achieving our end defeat our purpose. We should leave him in the hands of  God.    As to the suggestion of the Annual Convention being held next summer at  Green Acre, I believe it to be both wise and helpful, and trust that it  will forge another link between the Baha'is as a body and its founders and  trustees, and will serve to draw them closer and closer to the outward  form as well as to the spirit of the activities of the friends in America.    The financial help extended recently by the friends in America to their  fellow-workers of the Faith in Qadiyan, Punjab, has given us all intense  satisfaction and made us deeply grateful. Their contribution has  immediately been forwarded to them through the National Spiritual Assembly  of India and Burma, and will, I am certain, enhance the prestige and the  influence of the Cause.    I feel that the conditions are now favorable for the circulation of the  Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Baha only in manuscript form and among  recognized believers in America. Every such believer should be trusted  with a single copy with the express understanding that no duplicate copies  or extracts of it be made or published anywhere.          Baha'i Year Book      The suggestion made by my dear and able friend, Mr. Horace Holley, as to  the compilation of an annual \"Baha'i Year Book\" is extremely valuable and  timely. I am much impressed by it, and feel that an immediate start should  be made. I believe it can best be now undertaken under the direction and  supervision of your Assembly until the time should come for the friends in  the East and particularly Persia to participate effectually in its  development. I trust you will send me a copy of the skeleton of the  material you propose to include, and I shall here attempt to fill up any  gap and render any assistance I can to make it as comprehensive, as  attractive, and as authoritative as possible.    I am sending through my dear brother, Mr. M. Mills, various relics and  Tablets of our beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha, the only and priceless treasures of  the devoted gardener of Baha'u'llah's Shrine, Ustad Abu'l-Qasim Khurasani,  who has offered them to be preserved in his behalf in the Archives of the  friends in America. I am hoping to be able to send you in future precious  additions to what the Archives Committee has already collected, and may I  in this connection express to those who have conceived so admirable a plan  my profound admiration and heartfelt gratitude.    I wish to assure you in conclusion of my readiness and genuine desire to  help you and serve you to the utmost of my ability. I fully realize the  enormous burden that weighs on your shoulders, and am constantly mindful  of the distinct and eminent share you are contributing to the advancement  of the Cause. I wish you from the depths of my heart entire satisfaction  in your glorious work. Our beloved Master is surely watching from the  Realm Beyond over His children whom He nurtured and loved so well, and  will certainly guide you in every step you take, and crown your patient  efforts with signal success.    Your brother and fellow-worker,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine,  November 27, 1924.          Letter of January 16, 1925.      To my dearly-beloved friends, the members of the American National  Spiritual Assembly.    My dear and precious fellow-workers:    The three communications dated November 19, November 22 and December 22,  which I have recently received from that indefatigable servant of  Baha'u'llah, my esteemed spiritual brother, Mr. Holley, have given me  great satisfaction and have cheered and sustained me in my work. I have  read most carefully the minutes of your December meeting and am  particularly pleased to note in many respects the notable advance you have  made in establishing the Cause upon a wider and surer foundation.          History of the Cause      With reference to the need, so often expressed, for an authentic and  comprehensive history of the Cause, I am glad to inform you of the action  contemplated by the National Spiritual Assembly of Persia in instructing  and urging the local Assemblies throughout the country to take immediate  steps for the formation in every locality of a special committee which  will seek the assistance and the testimony of the remnants of the earliest  believers and pioneers of the Cause in Persia in collecting most carefully  all available evidence and data for the compilation of a comprehensive,  reliable and representative history of the Movement from its earliest dawn  to the present day. I have communicated with the National Assembly of  Persia, regarding this urgent and vital necessity, and I feel the time is  not far distant when a free rendering into English of this stirring  narrative as well as an abridged form of it will be made available for  both the Baha'is and the general public in the West.    The efforts recently displayed by the Publishing Committee so clearly  reflected in the minutes of their meeting of November 2, 1924, a copy of  which I have read with the closest attention, indicate the efficiency, the  zeal and the determination with which they are conducting this vital  branch of Baha'i activity. The scope of their effective work is expanding  rapidly, and I wish to assure them one and all of my prayers for the  fruition of their labors and the further development and consolidation of  their work.    There have been of late no fresh developments in the situation of the  House of Ba_gh_dad. The case, which is now before the court of First  Instance, has been postponed for some time and we still await anxiously  the decision of the court. Any hope of an immediate and final solution of  this intricate problem seems for the present remote. In the event of our  success the case may still be referred by our powerful opponents to the  Court of Appeal--the highest in the land--and should its decision be in our  favor the government may at any time--as it does not seem unlikely--decide,  by retaining the keys in its custody, to postpone indefinitely the  execution of such a verdict in order to allay the fierce hostility of the  clerical element as well as the Shi'ite population of 'Iraq.    Should a crisis occur, I will immediately inform you and endeavor to  define more clearly any measure that I feel should be taken by the  American Assemblies to insure the security of the House of Baha'u'llah.          Baha'i Periodicals      Regarding the publication of Baha'i periodicals in America, there is no  doubt whatsoever that every individual Baha'i is free to inaugurate and  conduct any magazine of his own provided that nothing is published therein  which in the estimation of the National Assembly tends in the least to  become detrimental or injurious to the highest interests of the Cause.  Within these limits, and these limits only, private initiative should in  no wise be discouraged and is indeed highly praiseworthy. It is for the  National Assembly, however, to exercise its judgment as to what extent the  resources at their disposal enable them to aid financially the individual  undertakings of the friends. Should the response of the friends and  Assemblies to the appeals made on behalf of the National Fund be prompt,  sustained and generous, the National Assembly will, I am certain, justify  its sympathy, good-will and genuine cooperation with every individual  Baha'i enterprise. I would, however, at this early state of our work,  strongly urge, nay entreat, the friends not to dissipate their efforts,  but to seek, after frank, mature and continuous deliberation, to arrive at  a common conclusion as to the most urgent requirements and needs of the  hour, and having unified their views to strive to uphold and enforce them  with promptitude, wholeheartedness and understanding.          News Letter      The first printed issue of the National Assembly's News Letter prepared  and signed on behalf of the Assembly by its able secretary, stands as a  bright and eloquent testimony of his thoroughness, his industry, his  conspicuous ability, his undoubted self-sacrifice. The Cause is entering  upon a new era of renewed and concerted activity. Its method of  presentation has unmistakably improved, and this general advancement in  standard is in no small measure attributable to the distinctive capacity  of your Assembly. My constant prayer is that He who watches over and  inspires your manifold activities may bless more richly than ever before  your noble endeavors.          Temple Meetings      With reference to the matter of meeting in the Foundation Hall of the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, I feel that the Foundation Hall should serve the  purpose both of devotional gatherings where the revealed Word of God is  read and chanted, and meetings at which subjects strictly Baha'i in  character are presented, propounded and discussed. I have no doubt that  every conscientious and thoughtful Baha'i will scrupulously and at all  times observe the commandment of Baha'u'llah and the instructions of  'Abdu'l-Baha relative to the maintenance of the sacredness, the dignity,  and the universality of"]]]
