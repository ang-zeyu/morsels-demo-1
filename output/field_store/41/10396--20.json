Arvad as well as Zahi  had succumbed to the violence of their attack, and if the cities of  Byblos, Berytus, Sidon, and Tyre had escaped, their suburbs had been  subjected to the ravages of the foe.*         * See, for this invasion, vol. v. pp. 305-311, of the       present work.    Peace followed the double victory of the Egyptians, and commerce on  the Mediterranean resumed once more its wonted ways, but only in those  regions where the authority of the Pharaoh and the fear of his vengeance  were effective influences. Beyond this sphere there were continual  warfare, piracy, migrations of barbaric hordes, and disturbances of all  kinds, among which, if a stranger ventured, it was at the almost certain  risk of losing his life or liberty. The area of undisturbed seas became  more and more contracted in proportion as the memory of past defeats  faded away. Cyprus was not comprised within it, and the AEgeans, who were  restrained by the fear of Egypt from venturing into any region under  her survey, perpetually flocked thither in numerous bodies. The Achaeans,  too, took up their abode on this island at an early date--about the time  when some of their bands were infesting Libya, and offering their help  to the enemies of the Pharaoh. They began their encroachments on the  northern side of the island--the least rich, it is true, but the nearest  to Cilicia, and the easiest to hold against the attacks of their rivals.  The disaster of Piriu had no doubt dashed their hopes of finding a  settlement in Egypt: they never returned thither any more, and the  current of emigration which had momentarily inclined towards the south,  now set steadily towards the east, where the large island of Cyprus  offered an unprotected and more profitable field of adventure. We know  not how far they penetrated into its forests and its interior. The  natives began, at length, under their influence, to despise the customs  and mode of existence with which they had been previously contented:  they acquired a taste for pottery rudely decorated after the Mycenean  manner, for jewellery, and for the bronze swords which they had seen in  the hands of the invaders. The Phoenicians, in order to maintain their  ground against the intruders, had to strengthen their ancient posts  or found others--such as Carpasia, Gerynia, and Lapathos on the  Achaean coast itself, Tamassos near the copper-mines, and a new town,  Qart-hadashat, which is perhaps only the ancient Citium under a new  name.* They thus added to their earlier possessions on the island  regions on its northern side, while the rest either fell gradually into  the hands of Hellenic adventurers, or continued in the possession of  the native populations. Cyprus served henceforward as an advance-post  against the attacks of Western nations, and the Phoenicians must have  been thankful for the good fortune which had made them see the wisdom  of fortifying it. But what became of their possessions lying outside  Cyprus? They retained several of them on the southern coasts of Asia  Minor, and Rhodes remained faithful to them, as well as Thasos, enabling  them to overlook the two extremities of the Archipelago;** but, owing to  the movements of the People of the Sea and the political development of  the Mycenean states, they had to give up the stations and harbours of  refuge which they held in the other islands or on the continent.         * It is mentioned in the inscription of Baal of Lebanon, and       in the Assyrian inscriptions of the VII\"'century B.C.         * This would appear to be the case, as far as Rhodes is       concerned, from the traditions which ascribed the final       expulsion of the Phoenicians to a Doric invasion from Argos.       The somewhat legendary accounts of the state of affairs       after the Hellenic conquest are in the fragments of Ergias       and Polyzelos.    They still continued, however, to pay visits to these  localities--sometimes in the guise of merchants and at others as  raiders, according to their ancient custom. They went from port to port  as of old, exposing their wares in the market-places, pillaging the  farms and villages, carrying into captivity the women and children whom  they could entice on board, or whom they might find defenceless on the  strand; but they attempted all this with more risk than formerly, and  with less success. The inhabitants of the coast were possessed of  fully manned ships, similar in form to those of the Philistines or  the Zakkala, which, at the first sight of the Phoenicians, set out in  pursuit of them, or, following the example set by their foe, lay in  wait for them behind some headland, and retaliated upon them for their  cruelty. Piracy in the Archipelago was practised as a matter of course,  and there was no islander who did not give himself up to it when  the opportunity offered, to return to his honest occupations after a  successful venture. Some kings seem to have risen up here and there who  found this state of affairs intolerable, and endeavoured to remedy it  by every means within their power: they followed on the heels of the  corsairs and adventurers, whatever might be their country; they followed  them up to their harbours of refuge, and became an effective police  force in all parts of the sea where they were able to carry their flag.  The memory of such exploits was preserved in the tradition of the Cretan  empire which Minos had constituted, and which extended its protection  over a portion of continental Greece.    If the Phoenicians had had to deal only with the piratical expeditions  of the peoples of the coast or with the jealous watchfulness of the  rulers of the sea, they might have endured the evil, but they had now  to put up, in addition, with rivalry in the artistic and industrial  products of which they had long had the monopoly. The spread of art  had at length led to the establishment of local centres of production  everywhere, which bade fair to vie with those of Phoenicia. On the  continent and in the Cyclades there were produced statuettes, intaglios,  jewels, vases, weapons, and textile fabrics which rivalled those of the  East, and were probably much cheaper. The merchants of Tyre and Sidon  could still find a market, however, for manufactures requiring great  technical skill or displaying superior taste--such as gold or silver  bowls, engraved or decorated with figures in outline--but they had to  face a serious falling off in their sales of ordinary goods. To extend  their commerce they had to seek new and less critical markets, where the  bales of their wares, of which the AEgean population was becoming weary,  would lose none of their attractions. We do not know at what date they  ventured to sail into the mysterious region of the Hesperides, nor by  what route they first reached it. It is possible that they passed from  Crete to Cythera, and from this to the Ionian Islands and to the point  of Calabria, on the other side of the straits of Otranto, whence they  were able to make their way gradually to Sicily.*         * Ed. Meyer thinks that the extension of Phoenician commerce       to the Western Mediterranean goes back to the XVIIIth       dynasty, or, at the latest, the XVth century before our era.       Without laying undue stress on this view, I am inclined to       ascribe with him, until we get further knowledge, the       colonisation of the West to the period immediately following       the movements of the People of the Sea and the diminution of       Phoenician trade in the Grecian Archipelago. Exploring       voyages had been made before this, but the founding of       colonies was not earlier than this epoch.    Did the fame of their discovery, we may ask, spread so rapidly in the  East as to excite there the cupidity and envy of their rivals? However  this may have been, the People of the Sea, after repeated checks  in Africa and Syria, and feeling more than ever the pressure of the  northern tribes encroaching on them, set out towards the west, following  the route pursued by the Phoenicians. The traditions current among  them and collected afterwards by the Greek historians give an account,  mingled with many fabulous details, of the causes which led to their  migrations and of the vicissitudes which they experienced in the course  of them. Daedalus having taken flight from Crete to Sicily, Minos, who  had followed in his steps, took possession of the greater part of the  island with his Eteocretes. Iolaos was the leader of Pelasgic bands,  whom he conducted first into Libya and finally to Sardinia. It came also  to pass that in the days of Atys, son of Manes, a famine broke out and  raged throughout Lydia: the king, unable to provide food for his people,  had them numbered, and decided by lot which of the two halves of the  population should expatriate themselves under the leadership of his son  Tyrsenos. Those-who were thus fated to leave their country assembled at  Smyrna, constructed ships there, and having embarked on board of them  what was necessary, set sail in quest of a new home. After a long  and devious voyage, they at length disembarked in the country of the  Umbrians, where they built cities, and became a prosperous people under  the name of Tyrseni, being thus called after their leader Tyrsenos.*         * Herodotus, whence all the information of other classical       writers is directly or indirectly taken. Most modern       historians reject this tradition. I see no reason for my own       part why they should do so, at least in the present state of       our knowledge. The Etrurians of the historical period were       the result of a fusion of several different elements, and       there is nothing against the view that the Tursha--one of       these elements--should have come from Asia Minor, as       Herodotus says. Properly understood, the tradition seems       well founded, and the details may have been added      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17327"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 7 (of 12) (#17)"],[1,"ects. Another son  of Nabu-baliddin, Marduk-belusate, claimed the sovereign power, and soon  won over so much of the country that Marduk-nadin-shumu had fears  for the safety of Babylon itself. He then probably remembered the  pretensions to Kharduniash, which his Assyrian neighbours had for a long  time maintained, and applied to Shalmaneser to support his tottering  fortunes. The Assyrian monarch must have been disposed to lend a  favourable ear to a request which allowed him to intervene as suzerain  in the quarrels of the rival kingdom: he mobilised his forces, offered  sacrifices in honour of Bamman at Zaban, and crossed the frontier in 853  B.C.*    The war dragged on during the next two years. The scene of hostilities  was at the outset on the left bank of the Tigris, which for ten  centuries had served as the battle-field for the warriors of both  countries. Shalmaneser, who had invested Me-Turnat at the fords of the  Lower Diyalah, at length captured that fortress, and after having  thus isolated the rebels of Babylonia proper, turned his steps towards  G-ananate.**         * The town of Zaban is situated on the Lesser Zab, but it is       impossible to fix the exact site.         ** Me-Turnat, Me-Turni, \"the water of the Turnat,\" stood       upon the Diyalah, probably near the site of Bakuba, where       the most frequented route crosses the river; perhaps we may       identify it with the Artemita of classical authors. Gananate       must be sought higher up near the mountains, as the context       points out; I am inclined to place it near the site of       Khanekin, whose gardens are still celebrated, and the       strategic importance of which is considerable.    Marduk-belusate, \"a vacillating king, incapable of directing his own  affairs,\" came out to meet him, but although repulsed and driven within  the town, he defended his position with such spirit that Shalmaneser was  at length obliged to draw off his troops after having cut down all  the young compelled the fruit trees, disorganised the whole system of  irrigation,--in short, after having effected all the damage he could. He  returned in the following spring by the most direct route; Lakhiru fell  into his hands,* but Marduk-belusate, having no heart to contend with  him for the possession of a district ravaged by the struggle of the  preceding summer, fell back on the mountains of Yasubi and concentrated  his forces round Arman.**         * Lakhiru comes before Gananate on the direct road from       Assyria, to the south of the Lower Zab, as we learn from the       account of the campaign itself: wo shall not do wrong in       placing this town either at Kifri, or in its neighbourhood       on the present caravan route.         ** Mount Yasubi is the mountainous district which separates       Khanekin from Holwan.    Shalmaneser, having first wreaked his vengeance upon Gananate, attacked  his adversary in his self-chosen position; Annan fell after a desperate  defence, and Marduk-belusate either perished or disappeared in a last  attempt at retaliation. Marduk-nadin-shumu, although rid of his rival,  was not yet master of the entire kingdom. The Aramaeans of the Marshes,  or, as they called themselves, the Kalda, had refused him their  allegiance, and were ravaging the regions of the Lower Euphrates by  their repeated incursions. They constituted not so much a compact state,  as a confederation of little states, alternately involved in petty  internecine quarrels, or temporarily reconciled under the precarious  authority of a sole monarch. Each separate state bore the name of the  head of the family--real or mythical--from whom all its members prided  themselves on being descended,--Bit-Dakkuri, Bit-Adini, Bit-Amukkani,  Bit-Shalani, Bit-Shalli, and finally Bit-Yakin, which in the end  asserted its predominance over all the rest.*         * As far as we can judge, Bit-Dakkuri and Bit-Adini were the       most northerly, the latter lying on both sides of the       Euphrates, the former on the west of the Euphrates, to the       south of the Bahr-i-Nejif; Bit-Yakin was at the southern       extremity near the mouths of the Euphrates, and on the       western shore of the Persian Gulf.    In demanding Shalmaneser's help, Marduk-nadin-shumu had virtually thrown  on him the responsibility of bringing these turbulent subjects to order,  and the Assyrian monarch accepted the duties of his new position without  demur. He marched to Babylon, entered the city and went direct to the  temple of E-shaggil: the people beheld him approach with reverence their  deities Bel and Belit, and visit all the sanctuaries of the local gods,  to whom he made endless propitiatory libations and pure offerings.  He had worshipped Ninip in Kuta; he was careful not to forget Nabo of  Borsippa, while on the other hand he officiated in the temple of Ezida,  and consulted its ancient oracle, offering upon its altars the flesh  of splendid oxen and fat lambs. The inhabitants had their part in the  festival as well as the gods; Shalmaneser summoned them to a public  banquet, at which he distributed to them embroidered garments, and plied  them with meats and wine; then, after renewing his homage to the gods  of Babylon, he recommenced his campaign, and set out in the direction  of the sea. Baqani, the first of the Chaldaean cities which lay on his  route, belonged to Bit-Adini,* one of the tribes of Bit-Dakkuri; it  appeared disposed to resist him, and was therefore promptly dismantled  and burnt--an example which did not fail to cool the warlike  inclinations which had begun to manifest themselves in other parts of  Bit-Dakkuri.         * The site of Baqani is unknown; it should be sought for       between Lamlum and Warka, and Bit-Adini in Bit-Dakkuri       should be placed between the Shatt-et-Kaher and the Arabian       desert, if the name of Enzudi, the other royal town,       situated to the west of the Euphrates, is found, as is       possible, under a popular etymology, in that of Kalaat ain-       Said or Kalaat ain-es-Said in the modern maps.    He next crossed the Euphrates, and pillaged Enzudi, the fate of which  caused the remainder of Bit-Adini to lay down arms, and the submission  of the latter brought about that of Bit-Yakin and Bit-Amukkani. These  were all rich provinces, and they bought off the conqueror liberally:  gold, silver, tin, copper, iron, acacia-wood, ivory, elephants' skins,  were all showered upon the invader to secure his mercy. It must have  been an intense satisfaction to the pride of the Assyrians to be able  to boast that their king had deigned to offer sacrifices in the sacred  cities of Accad, and that he had been borne by his war-horses to  the shores of the Salt Sea; these facts, of little moment to us now,  appeared to the people of those days of decisive importance. No king who  was not actually master of the country would have been tolerated within  the temple of the eponymous god, for the purpose of celebrating  the rites which the sovereign alone was empowered to perform.  Marduk-nadin-shumu, in recognising Shalmaneser's right to act thus,  thereby acknowledged that he himself was not only the king's ally, but  his liegeman. This bond of supremacy doubtless did not weigh heavily  upon him; as soon as his suzerain had evacuated the country, the two  kingdoms remained much on the same footing as had been established by  the treaties of the three previous generations. Alliances were made  between private families belonging to both, peace existed between the  two sovereigns, interchange of commerce and amenities took place between  the two peoples, but with one point of difference which had not existed  formerly: Assur protected Babel, and, by taking precedence of Marduk, he  became the real head of the peoples of the Euphrates valley. Assured of  the subordination, or at least of the friendly neutrality of Babylon,  Shalma-neser had now a free hand to undertake a campaign in the remoter  regions of Syria, without being constantly haunted by the fear that his  rival might suddenly swoop down upon him in the rear by the valleys of  the Badanu or the Zabs. He now ran no risks in withdrawing his troops  from the south-eastern frontier, and in marshalling his forces on the  slopes of the Armenian Alps or on the banks of the Orontes, leaving  merely a slender contingent in the heart of Assyria proper to act as the  necessary guardians of order in the capital.    Since the indecisive battle of Qarqar, the western frontier of the  empire had receded as far as the Euphrates, and Shalmaneser had been  obliged to forego the collection of the annual Syrian tribute. It would  have been an excellent opportunity for the Khati, while they enjoyed  this accidental respite, to come to an understanding with Damascus, for  the purpose of acting conjointly against a common enemy; but they let  the right moment slip, and their isolation made submission inevitable.  The effort to subdue them cost Shalmaneser dear, both in time and men;  in the spring of each year he appeared at the fords of Tul-barsip and  ravaged the environs of Carchemish, then marched upon the Orontes to  accomplish the systematic devastation of some fresh district, or to  inflict a defeat on such of his adversaries as dared to encounter him  in the open field. In 850 B.C. the first blow was struck at the Khati;  Agusi* was the next to suffer, and its king, Arame, lost Arnie, his  royal city, with some hundred more townships and strongholds.**         * Historians have up to the present admitted that this       campaign of the year 850 took place in Armenia. The context       of the account itself shows us that, in his tenth year,       Shalmaneser advanced against the towns of Arame, immediately       after having pillaged the country of the Khati, which       inclines me to think that these towns were situated in       Northern Syria. I have no doubt that the Arame in question    "]]]
