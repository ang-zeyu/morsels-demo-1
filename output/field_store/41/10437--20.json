Either  hypothesis presents an attractive picture; but that which presupposes  the bursting asunder of a large planet, which might at least have borne  the germs of life, and the subsequent shattering of its parts into  smaller fragments, like the secondary explosions of the pieces of a  pyrotechnic bomb, certainly is by far the more impressive in its appeal  to the imagination, and would seem to offer excellent material for some  of the extra-terrestrial romances now so popular. It is a startling  thought that a world can possibly carry within itself, like a dynamite  cartridge, the means of its own disruption; but the idea does not appear  so extremely improbable when we recall the evidence of collisions or  explosions, happening on a tremendous scale, in the case of new or  temporary stars.[9]    [Footnote 9: \"Since the discovery of Eros, the extraordinary position of  its orbit has led to the suggestion that possibly Mars itself, instead  of being regarded as primarily a major planet, belonging to the  terrestrial group, ought rather to be considered as the greatest of the  asteroids, and a part of the original body from which the asteroidal  system was formed.\"--J. Bauschinger, Astronomische Nachrichten, No.  3542.]    Coming to the question of life upon the asteroids, it seems clear that  they must be excluded from the list of habitable worlds, whatever we  may choose to think of the possible habitability of the original planet  through whose destruction they may have come into existence. The largest  of them possesses a force of gravity far too slight to enable it to  retain any of the gases or vapors that are recognized as constituting an  atmosphere. But they afford a captivating field for speculation, which  need not be altogether avoided, for it offers some graphic illustrations  of the law of gravitation. A few years ago I wrote, for the  entertainment of an audience which preferred to meet science attired in  a garb woven largely from the strands of fancy, an account of some of  the peculiarities of such minute globes as the asteroids, which I  reproduce here because it gives, perhaps, a livelier picture of those  little bodies, from the point of view of ordinary human interest, than  could be presented in any other way.      A WAIF OF SPACE    One night as I was waiting, watch in hand, for an occultation, and  striving hard to keep awake, for it had been a hot and exhausting  summer's day, while my wife--we were then in our honeymoon--sat  sympathetically by my side, I suddenly found myself withdrawn from the  telescope, and standing in a place that appeared entirely strange. It  was a very smooth bit of ground, and, to my surprise, there was no  horizon in sight; that is to say, the surface of the ground disappeared  on all sides at a short distance off, and beyond nothing but sky was  visible. I thought I must be on the top of a stupendous mountain, and  yet I was puzzled to understand how the face of the earth could be so  far withdrawn. Presently I became aware that there was some one by me  whom I could not see.    \"You are not on a mountain,\" my companion said, and as he spoke a cold  shiver ran along my back-bone; \"you are on an asteroid, one of those  miniature planets, as you astronomers call them, and of which you have  discovered several hundred revolving between the orbits of Mars and  Jupiter. This is the little globe that you have glimpsed occasionally  with your telescope, and that you, or some of your fellows, have been  kind enough to name Menippe.\"    Then I perceived that my companion, whose address had hardly been  reassuring, was a gigantic inhabitant of the little planet, towering up  to a height of three quarters of a mile. For a moment I was highly  amused, standing by his foot, which swelled up like a hill, and  straining my neck backward to get a look up along the precipice of his  leg, which, curiously enough, I observed was clothed in rough homespun,  the woolly knots of the cloth appearing of tremendous size, while it  bagged at the knee like any terrestrial trousers' leg. His great head  and face I could see far above me, as it were, in the clouds. Yet I was  not at all astonished.    \"This is all right,\" I said to myself. \"Of course on Menippe the people  must be as large as this, for the little planet is only a dozen miles  in diameter, and the force of gravity is consequently so small that a  man without loss of activity, or inconvenience, can grow three quarters  of a mile tall.\"    Suddenly an idea occurred to me. \"Just to think what a jump I can make!  Why, only the other day I was figuring it out that a man could easily  jump a thousand feet high from the surface of Menippe, and now here I  actually am on Menippe. I'll jump.\"    The sensation of that glorious rise skyward was delightful beyond  expression. My legs seemed to have become as powerful as the engines of  a transatlantic liner, and with one spring I rose smoothly and swiftly,  and as straight as an arrow, surmounting the giant's foot, passing his  knee and attaining nearly to the level of his hip. Then I felt that the  momentum of my leap was exhausted, and despite my efforts I slowly  turned head downward, glancing in affright at the ground a quarter of a  mile below me, on which I expected to be dashed to pieces. But a  moment's thought convinced me that I should get no hurt, for with so  slight a force of gravity it would be more like floating than falling.  Just then the Menippean caught me with his monstrous hand and lifted me  to the level of his face.    \"I should like to know,\" I said, \"how you manage to live up here; you  are so large and your planet is so little.\"    \"Now, you are altogether too inquisitive,\" replied the giant. \"You go!\"    He stooped down, placed me on the toe of his boot, and drew back his  foot to kick me off.    It flashed into my mind that my situation had now become very serious. I  knew well what the effects of the small attractive force of these  diminutive planets must be, for I had often amused myself with  calculations about them. In this moment of peril I did not forget my  mathematics. It was clear that if the giant propelled me with sufficient  velocity I should be shot into space, never to return. How great would  that velocity have to be? My mind worked like lightning on this problem.  The diameter of Menippe I knew did not exceed twelve miles. Its mean  density, as near as I could judge, was about the same as that of the  earth. Its attraction must therefore be as its radius, or nearly 660  times less than that of the earth. A well-known formula enables us to  compute the velocity a body would acquire in falling from an infinite  distance to the earth or any other planet whose size and force of  gravity are known. The same formula, taken in the opposite sense, of  course, shows how fast a body must start from a planet in order that it  may be freed from its control. The formula is V = square root of (2  gr.), in which \"g\" is the acceleration of gravity, equal for the earth  to 32 feet in a second, and \"r\" is the radius of the attracting body. On  Menippe I knew \"g\" must equal about one twentieth of a foot, and \"r\"  31,680 feet. Like a flash I applied the formula while the giant's  muscles were yet tightening for the kick: 31,680 x 1/20 x 2 = 3,168, the  square root of which is a fraction more than 56. Fifty-six feet in a  second, then, was the critical velocity with which I must be kicked off  in order that I might never return. I perceived at once that the giant  would be able to accomplish it. I turned and shouted up at him:    \"Hold on, I have something to say to you!\"    I dimly saw his mountainous face puckered into mighty wrinkles, out of  which his eyes glared fiercely, and the next moment I was sailing into  space. I could no more have kept a balance than the earth can stand  still upon its axis. I had become a small planet myself, and, like all  planets, I rotated. Yet the motion did not dizzy me, and soon I became  intensely interested in the panorama of creation that was spread around  me. For some time, whenever my face was turned toward the little globe  of Menippe, I saw the giant, partly in profile against the sky, with his  back bent and his hands upon his knees, watching me with an occasional  approving nod of his big head. He looked so funny standing there on his  little seven-by-nine world, like a clown on a performing ball, that,  despite my terrible situation, I shook my sides with laughter. There was  no echo in the profundity of empty space.    Soon Menippe dwindled to a point, and I saw her inhospitable inhabitant  no more. Then I watched the sun and the blazing firmament around, for  there was at the same time broad day and midnight for me. The sunlight,  being no longer diffused by an atmosphere, did not conceal the face of  the sky, and I could see the stars shining close to the orb of day. I  recognized the various planets much more easily than I had been  accustomed to do, and, with a twinge at my heart, saw the earth  traveling along in its distant orbit, splendid in the sunshine. I  thought of my wife sitting alone by the telescope in the darkness and  silence, wondering what had become of me. I asked myself, \"How in the  world can I ever get back there again?\" Then I smiled to think of the  ridiculous figure I cut, out here in space, exposed to the eyes of the  universe, a rotating, gyrating, circumambulating astronomer, an  animated teetotum lost in the sky. I saw no reason to hope that I should  not go on thus forever, revolving around the sun until my bones,  whitening among the stars, might be revealed to the superlative powers  of some future telescope, and become a subject of absorbing interest,  the topic of many a learned paper for the astronomers of a future age.  Afterward I was comforted by the reflection that in airless space,  although I might die and my body become desiccated, yet there could be  no real"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18435"],[0,"Good Things to Eat, as Suggested (#17)"],[1,"thyme, a good  bunch of parsley, two bay-leaves, a dessert-spoonful of white pepper,  two tablespoons of vinegar and two ounces of butter, and let all stew  together until nearly all the liquor has evaporated; add one teacupful  of stock, two teacupfuls of Spanish sauce. Boil this until reduced to  one-half, then serve.      ~ROYAL SAUCE~--Put four ounces of fresh butter and the yolks of two  fresh eggs into a saucepan and stir them over the fire until the yolks  begin to thicken, but do not allow them to cook hard. Take sauce off the  fire and stir in by degrees two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, two  tablespoons of Indian soy, one finely chopped green gherkin, one small  pinch of cayenne pepper, and a small quantity of salt. When well  incorporated keep sauce in a cold place. When cold serve with fish.      ~SAUCE FOR FISH~--Simmer two cups of milk with a slice of onion, a slice  of carrot cut in bits, a sprig of parsley and a bit of bay-leaf for a  few minutes.

Add one-half cup of olive oil  slowly and dilute as needed with one and one-half tablespoon of vinegar.  Add one-quarter cup of chopped pickles, capers and olives mixed.      ~TARTAR SAUCE~--Mix one tablespoon of vinegar, one teaspoon of lemon  juice, a saltspoon of salt, a tablespoon of any good catsup and heat  over hot water. Heat one-third cup of butter in a small saucepan until  it begins to brown, then strain onto the other ingredients and pour over  the fish on the platter.      ~SHRIMP SAUCE~--Pour one pint of poivrade sauce and butter sauce into a  saucepan and boil until somewhat reduced. Thicken the sauce with two  ounces of lobster butter. Pick one and one-half pints of shrimps, put  them into the sauce with a small quantity of lemon juice, stir the sauce  by the side of the fire for a few minutes, then serve it.      ~SAUCE FOR FRIED PIKE~--Peel and chop very fine one small onion, one  green pepper, half a peeled clove, and garlic. Season with salt, red  pepper and half a wine-glassful of good white wine. Boil about two  minutes and add a gill of tomato sauce and a small tomato cut in dice  shaped pieces. Cook about ten minutes.          ROLLS, BREAD AND MUFFINS      ~BREAKFAST ROLLS~--Sift a quart of flour and stir into it a saltspoonful  of sugar, a cup of warm milk, two tablespoonfuls of melted shortening  and two beaten eggs. Dissolve a quarter of a cake of compressed yeast in  a little warm milk and beat in last of all. Set the dough in a bowl to  rise until morning. Early in the morning make lightly and quickly into  rolls and set to rise near the range for twenty minutes.      ~EGG ROLLS~--Two cups flour, one level teaspoon salt, two level  teaspoons baking powder, two level tablespoons lard, two level  tablespoons butter, one egg, one-half cup milk. Sift together the flour,  salt, and baking powder, work in the shortening with the fingers.    Add the egg well beaten and mixed with the milk. Mix well, toss onto a  floured board and knead lightly. Roll out and cut in two-inch squares.  Place a half-inch apart in a buttered pan. Gash the center of each with  a sharp knife. Brush over with sugar and water, and bake fifteen minutes  in a hot oven.      ~EXCELLENT TEA ROLLS~--Scald one cup of milk and turn into the mixing  bowl. When nearly cool add a whole yeast cake and beat in one and a half  cups of flour. Cover and let rise. Add one-quarter cup of sugar, one  level teaspoon of salt, two beaten eggs, and one-third cup of butter.  Add flour enough to make a dough that can be kneaded. Cover and let  rise. Roll out one-half inch thick, cut in rounds, brush one-half each  with melted butter, fold and press together. Set close together in the  pan, cover with a cloth, let rise, and bake.      ~LIGHT LUNCHEON ROLLS~--Heat one cup of milk to the scalding point in a  double boiler, add one rounding tablespoon of butter, one level  tablespoon of sugar, and one level teaspoon of salt. Stir and set into  cold water until lukewarm, then add one yeast cake dissolved in  one-quarter cup of lukewarm water, and two cups of flour. Beat hard for  two or three minutes, cover, and let rise until very light. Add flour  to make a dough that can be kneaded and let rise again. Knead, shape  into small rolls. Set them close together in a buttered baking pan, let  rise light, and bake in a quick oven.      ~A PAN OF ROLLS~--Scald one pint of milk and add one rounding tablespoon  of lard. Mix in one quart of sifted bread flour, one-quarter cup of  sugar, a saltspoon of salt and one-half yeast cake dissolved in one-half  cup of lukewarm water. Cover and let rise over night. In the morning  roll half an inch thick cut into rounds, spread a little soft butter on  one-half of each, fold over and press together. Let rise until light and  bake in a quick oven. Rolls may be raised lighter than a loaf of bread  because the rising is checked as soon as they are put into the oven.      ~RAISED GRAHAM ROLLS~--Scald two cups of milk and melt in it two level  tablespoons of butter and one-half level teaspoon of salt. When cool add  two tablespoons of molasses and one-half yeast cake dissolved in a  little warm water. Add white flour to make a thin batter, beat until  smooth and set in a warm place until light. When well risen stir in  whole meal to make a dough just stiff enough to knead. Knead until  elastic then place it in the original bulk. Flour the board and turn the  risen dough out carefully, pat out one inch thick with the rolling pin  and make into small rolls. Place these rolls close together in the pan,  brush over with milk and let rise until very light. Bake in a quick  oven.      ~RYE BREAKFAST CAKES~--Beat the egg light, add one-half cup of sugar,  two cups of milk, a saltspoon of salt, one and one-half cups of rye  meal, one and one-half cups of flour and three level teaspoons of baking  powder. Bake in a hot greased gem pan.      ~BREAKFAST CAKES~--Sift one cup of corn meal, one-quarter teaspoon of  salt and two level teaspoons of sugar together, stir in one cup of thick  sour milk, one-half tablespoonful melted butter, one well beaten egg and  one-half teaspoon of soda, measured level. Beat hard and bake in gem  pans in a quick oven.      ~SCOTCH OAT CAKES~--Can be either fried on a griddle or broiled over a  fire. The meal for this purpose should be ground fine. Put a quart of  the meal in a baking dish with a teaspoonful of salt. Pour in little by  little just enough cold water to make a dough and roll out quickly  before it hardens into a circular sheet about a quarter of an inch  thick. Cut into four cakes and bake slowly for about twenty minutes on  an iron griddle. Do not turn but toast after they are cooked.      ~SCOTCH SCONES~--Two cups flour, four level teaspoons baking powder, two  level tablespoons sugar, one level teaspoon salt, three level  tablespoons butter, one whole egg or two yolks, one cup buttermilk. Sift  together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt, and work in the  butter with the fingers, then add the buttermilk and egg well beaten.  Mix well, turn onto floured board and knead slightly. Roll out one-half  inch thick. Cut with small biscuit cutter and cook on a hot griddle,  turning once.      ~LOG CABIN TOAST FOR BREAKFAST~--This is made up of long strips of bread  cut to the thinness of afternoon tea sandwiches, then toasted a delicate  brown. All are lightly buttered and piled on a hot plate log cabin  fashion.      ~OLD FASHION RUSKS~--At night make a sponge as for bread with two cups  of scalded milk, a teaspoon of salt, yeast and flour. In the morning put  half a cup of butter into two cups of milk and heat until the butter is  barely melted, add this to the sponge, one cup of sugar and three beaten  eggs. Add flour to make a dough that can be kneaded. Let rise very  light. Roll out one and one-half inches thick, cut in round cakes, let  rise and bake a deep yellow color.      ~WAFFLES SOUTHERN STYLE~--One pint of flour, one pint buttermilk, one  egg, half teaspoon soda dissolved in little water, one teaspoon sugar,  one teaspoon salt, one teaspoon baking powder, one tablespoon cornmeal,  one tablespoon melted butter. Mix as any other batter cake or waffles.      ~WHOLE WHEAT POPOVERS~--Put two-thirds cup of whole wheat meal, one and  two-thirds cup of white flour, and one-half level teaspoon of salt into  a sifter and sift three times. Pour two cups of milk on slowly and stir  until smooth. Beat two eggs five minutes, add to the first mixture, and  beat again for two minutes. Turn into hot greased iron gem pans and bake  half an hour in a rather quick oven.      ~BERRY MUFFINS~--Mix two cups sifted flour, one-half teaspoon salt and  two rounded teaspoons baking powder. Cream one-quarter cup of butter  with one-half cup sugar, add well beaten yolk of one egg, one cup milk,  the flour mixture and white of egg beaten stiff.
