This is the custom if a young man has been away at school and college for  so long that he has not a large acquaintance of his own. It is, however,  correct under any circumstances when formally leaving cards to leave those  of all sons and daughters who are grown.      =THE P.P.C. CARD=    This is merely a visiting card, whether of a lady or a gentleman, on which  the initials P.P.C. (_pour prendre conge_--to take leave) are written in  ink in the lower left corner. This is usually left at the door, or sent by  mail to acquaintances, when one is leaving for the season, or for good. It  never takes the place of a farewell visit when one has received especial  courtesy, nor is it in any sense a message of thanks for especial  kindness. In either of these instances, a visit should be paid or a note  of farewell and thanks written.      =CARDS OF NEW OR TEMPORARY ADDRESS=    In cities where there is no Social Register or other printed society list,  one notifies acquaintances of a change of address by mailing a visiting  card.    Cards are also sent, with a temporary address written in ink, when one is  in a strange city and wishes to notify friends where one is stopping.    It is also quite correct for a lady to mail her card with her temporary  address written on it to any gentleman whom she would care to see, and who  she is sure would like to see her.      =WHEN CARDS ARE SENT=    When not intending to go to a tea or a wedding reception (the invitation  to which did not have R.s.v.p. on it and require an answer), one should  mail cards to the hostess so as to arrive on the morning of the  entertainment. To a tea given for a debutante cards are enclosed in one  envelope and addressed:        Mrs. Gilding      Miss Gilding            00 Fifth Avenue                New York    For a wedding reception, cards are sent to Mr. and Mrs. ----, the mother  and father of the bride, and another set of cards sent to Mr. and  Mrs. ----, the bride and bridegroom.      =THE VISIT OF EMPTY FORM=    Not so many years ago, a lady or gentleman, young girl or youth, who  failed to pay her or his \"party call\" after having been invited to Mrs.  Social-Leader's ball was left out of her list when she gave her next one.  For the old-fashioned hostess kept her visiting list with the precision  of a bookkeeper in a bank; everyone's credit was entered or cancelled  according to the presence of her or his cards in the card receiver. Young  people who liked to be asked to her house were apt to leave an extra one  at the door, on occasion, so that theirs should not be among the missing  when the new list for the season was made up--especially as the more  important old ladies were very quick to strike a name off, but seldom if  ever known to put one back.    But about twenty years ago the era of informality set in and has been  gaining ground ever since. In certain cities old-fashioned hostesses, it  is said, exclude delinquents. But New York is too exotic and intractable,  and the too exacting hostess is likely to find her tapestried rooms rather  empty, while the younger world of fashion flocks to the crystal-fountained  ballroom of the new Spendeasy Westerns. And then, too, life holds so many  other diversions and interests for the very type of youth which of  necessity is the vital essence of all social gaiety. Society can have  distinction and dignity without youth--but not gaiety. The country with  its outdoor sports, its freedom from exacting conventions, has gradually  deflected the interest of the younger fashionables, until at present they  care very little whether Mrs. Toplofty and Mrs. Social-Leader ask them to  their balls or not. They are glad enough to go, of course, but they don't  care enough for invitations to pay dull visits and to live up to the  conventions of \"manners\" that old-fashioned hostesses demand. And as these  \"rebels\" are invariably the most attractive and the most eligible youths,  it has become almost an issue; a hostess must in many cases either invite  none but older people and the few young girls and men whose mothers have  left cards for them, or ignore convention and invite the rebels.    In trying to find out where the present indifference started, many ascribe  it to Bobo Gilding, to whom entering a great drawing-room was more  suggestive of the daily afternoon tea ordeal of his early nursery days,  than a voluntary act of pleasure. He was long ago one of the first to  rebel against old Mrs. Toplofty's exactions of party calls, by saying he  did not care in the least whether his great-aunt Jane Toplofty invited him  to her stodgy old ball or not. And then Lucy Wellborn (the present Mrs.  Bobo Gilding) did not care much to go either if none of her particular men  friends were to be there. Little she cared to dance the cotillion with old  Colonel Bluffington or to go to supper with that odious Hector Newman.    And so, beginning first with a few gilded youths, then including young  society, the habit has spread until the obligatory paying of visits by  young girls and men has almost joined the once universal \"day at home\" as  belonging to a past age. Do not understand by this that visits are never  paid on other occasions. Visits to strangers, visits of condolence, and of  other courtesies are still paid, quite as punctiliously as ever. But  within the walls of society itself, the visit of formality is decreasing.  One might almost say that in certain cities society has become a family  affair. Its walls are as high as ever, higher perhaps to outsiders, but  among its own members, such customs as keeping visiting lists and having  days at home, or even knowing who owes a visit to whom, is not only  unobserved but is unheard of.    But because punctilious card-leaving, visiting, and \"days at home\" have  gone out of fashion in New York, is no reason why these really important  observances should not be, or are not, in the height of fashion elsewhere.  Nor, on the other hand, must anyone suppose because the younger  fashionables in New York pay few visits and never have days at home, that  they are a bit less careful about the things which they happen to consider  essential to good-breeding.    The best type of young men pay few, if any, party calls, because they work  and they exercise, and whatever time is left over, if any, is spent in  their club or at the house of a young woman, not tete-a-tete, but  invariably playing bridge. The Sunday afternoon visits that the youth of  another generation used always to pay, are unknown in this, because every  man who can, spends the week-end in the country.    It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that not alone men, but many young  married women of highest social position, except to send with flowers or  wedding presents, do not use a dozen visiting cards a year. But there are  circumstances when even the most indifferent to social obligations must  leave cards.      =WHEN CARDS MUST BE LEFT=    Etiquette absolutely demands that one leave a card within a few days after  taking a first meal in a lady's house; or if one has for the first time  been _invited_ to lunch or dine with strangers, it is inexcusably rude not  to leave a card upon them, whether one accepted the invitation or not.    One must also unfailingly return a first call, even if one does not care  for the acquaintance. Only a real \"cause\" can excuse the affront to an  innocent stranger that the refusal to return a first call would imply. If  one does not care to continue the acquaintance, one need not pay a second  visit.    Also a card is always left with a first invitation. Supposing Miss  Philadelphia takes a letter of introduction to Mrs. Newport--Mrs. Newport,  inviting Miss Philadelphia to her house, would not think of sending her  invitation without also leaving her card. Good form demands that a visit  be paid before issuing a _first invitation_. Sometimes a note of  explanation is sent asking that the formality be waived, but it is _never_  disregarded, except in the case of an invitation from an older lady to a  young girl. Mrs. Worldly, for instance, who has known Jim Smartlington  always, might, instead of calling on Mary Smith, to whom his engagement is  announced, write her a note, asking her to lunch or dinner. But in  inviting Mrs. Greatlake of Chicago she would leave her card with her  invitation at Mrs. Greatlake's hotel.    It seems scarcely necessary to add that anyone not entirely heartless  must leave a card on, or send flowers to, an acquaintance who has suffered  a recent bereavement. One should also leave cards of inquiry or send  flowers to sick people.      =INVITATION IN PLACE OF RETURNED VISIT=    Books on etiquette seem agreed that sending an invitation does not cancel  the obligation of paying a visit--which may be technically correct--but  fashionable people, who are in the habit of lunching or dining with each  other two or three times a season, pay no attention to visits whatever.  Mrs. Norman calls on Mrs. Gilding. Mrs. Gilding invites the Normans to  dinner. They go. A short time afterward Mrs. Norman invites the  Gildings--or the Gildings very likely again invite the Normans. Some  evening at all events, the Gildings dine with the Normans. Someday, if  Mrs. Gilding happens to be leaving cards, she may leave them at the  Normans--or she may not. Some people leave cards almost like the \"hares\"  in a paper chase; others seldom if ever do. Except on the occasions  mentioned in the paragraph before this, or unless there is an illness, a  death, a birth, or a marriage, people in society invite each other to  their houses and don't leave cards at all. Nor do they ever consider whose  \"turn\" it is to invite whom.      =\"NOT AT HOME\"=    When a servant at a door says \"Not at home,\" this phrase means that the  lady of the house is \"Not at home to visitors.\" This answer neither  signifies nor implies--nor is it intended to--that Mrs. Jones is out of  the house."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14317"],[0,"The Sorcery Club (#17)"],[1,", cadging toad. You--' but I  can't repeat all she said, it would make you both blush! I let her go  on till she had worn herself out and then I said, 'Well, Miss Barlow,  why all this fuss--why these fireworks! It can't do you any good. We  must come to business sooner or later. If you don't pay me handsomely  I shall tell Miss Roberts as well as Mr. Delmas.'    \"'Mr. Delmas won't believe you,' she hissed, 'you've no proofs at  all!'    \"'Perhaps not,' I said, 'but I've proofs of this. I know you have two  deformed toes on your left foot, that all your teeth are false, and  that you go to that charlatan, Howard Prince, in Californian Street to  be faked up. I must be brutal--it's no use being anything else to  women of your sort. You've got a certain species of eczema, and you  flatter yourself that no one but you and Prince are aware of it. What  have you got to say now, Miss Barlow?' But Ella Barlow had fainted.  When she came to, which I managed after vigorous application of salts  and water--the effects of the latter on her complexion I leave you to  imagine--I again broached the subject.    \"'What is it you propose?' she said feebly.    \"'Why this,' I said, 'you hand me over all those diamonds, and your  defects will--as far as I am concerned--always remain a secret.  Refuse, and Miss Roberts and Mr. Delmas shall know all there is to be  known at once.'    \"For some minutes she sat with her face buried in her  hands--shivering. Then she looked up at me--and Jerusalem! it was like  looking at an old woman. 'Take them,' she said, 'take them! I shall  never wear them again, anyhow. Take them--and leave me.'    \"Well, you fellows, I steeled my heart, and slipped every Jack one  that was on her into my pocket.    \"'You won't tell them,' she whispered, catching hold of me by the arm,  'you swear you won't.' I won't try and remember exactly what I  answered--but outside the door of the box Delmas joined me. He had  been concealed within and had heard everything that passed.    \"'I can't say how grateful I am to you,' he said. 'It's a bit low  down, perhaps, but, then, we were dealing with a low-down person. You  thoroughly deserve those diamonds--will you accept an offer for them  from me? I should like to buy them for Miss Roberts and present them  to her on our reconciliation.' We came to terms then and there, and he  'phoned through to me an hour ago to say that he had made it up with  Miss Roberts, that she was delighted with the diamonds, and that they  are going to be married next month.\"    \"So out of evil good comes,\" Hamar said, \"the maxim for us, remember,  is--out of evil evil alone must come. What are you going to do to-day,  you two?\"    \"Rest!\" said Kelson, \"I'm tired.\"    \"Eat!\" said Curtis, \"I'm hungry!\"    \"Now look here, this won't do,\" Hamar remarked, \"you've earned your  rest, Matt, but you haven't, Ed. You can't go on eating eternally.\"    \"Can't I?\" Curtis snapped, \"I'm not so sure of that, I've years to  make up for.\"    \"Then do the thing in moderation, for goodness sake!\" Hamar  expostulated, \"and recollect we must, at all costs, act together. We  have now twelve thousand dollars between us in the bank--that is to  say, the capital of the Firm of Hamar, Curtis and Kelson represents  that amount. It is our ambition to increase that amount--and to go on  increasing it till we can fairly claim to be the richest Firm in the  world. Now to do that we must work, and work hard, if we are to live  at the pace Ed is setting us--but there is no reason why we should  remain here, and I propose that we move elsewhere. I've got a scheme  in my head, rather a colossal one I admit, but not altogether  impossible.\"    \"What is it?\" Kelson asked.    \"Yes, out with it,\" Curtis grunted.    \"It is this,\" Hamar said, \"I suggest that we go to London--London in  England--I guess it's the richest town in the world--and there set up  as sorcerers--The Sorcery Company Ltd. We should begin with divination  and juggling, and go on, according to the seven stages. We should of  course sell our cures and spells, and there is not the slightest doubt  but that we should make an enormous pile, with which we would  gradually buy up, not merely London, but the whole of England.\"    \"That's rather a tall order,\" Kelson murmured.    \"A small one, you mean,\" Curtis sneered, \"you could put the whole of  England twice over in California, and from what I've heard I don't go  much on London. I reckon it isn't much bigger than San Francisco.\"    \"Still you wouldn't mind being joint owner of it,\" Hamar laughed.\"    \"No, perhaps not,\" Curtis said rather dubiously. \"I guess we could buy  the crown and wear it in turn. Sam Westlake up at Meidler's always  used to say the Britishers would sell their souls if any one bid high  enough. They think of nothing but money over there. When shall we go?\"    \"At the end of our week,\" Hamar said, \"that is to say on Wednesday--in  three days' time.\"    \"First class all the way, of course,\" Curtis said, \"I'll see to the  arrangements for the catering and berths.\"    \"All right!\" Hamar laughed, as he filled three glasses with champagne.  \"Here, drink, you fellows, 'Long life, health and prosperity--to  Hamar, Curtis and Kelson, the Modern Sorcery Company Ltd.'\"          CHAPTER VIII    TWO DREAMS      \"Do you believe in dreams?\" Gladys Martin inquired, as, fresh from a  stroll in the garden, she joined her aunt, Miss Templeton, in the  breakfast room at Pine Cottage.    \"I believe in fairies,\" Miss Templeton rejoined, smiling indulgently  as she looked at the fair face beside her. \"What was the dream,  dearie?\"    Gladys laughed a little mischievously. \"I don't quite know whether I  ought to tell you,\" she said. \"It might shock you.\"    \"Perhaps I'm not so easily shocked as you imagine,\" Miss Templeton  replied. \"What was it?\"    \"Well!\" Gladys began, flinging both arms round her aunt's neck and  playing with the pleats in her blouse, \"I dreamed that I was walking  in the little wood at the end of the garden, and that the trees and  flowers walked and talked with me. And we danced together--and, first  of all, I had for my partner, a red rose--and then, an ash. They both  made love to me, and squeezed my waist with their hot, fibrous hands.  A poppy piped, a bramble played the concertina, and a lilac grew  desperately jealous of me and tried to claw my hair. Then the dancing  ceased, and I found myself in the midst of bluebells that shook their  bells at me with loud trills of laughter. And out from among them,  came a buttercup, pointing its yellow head at me. 'See! see,' it  cried, 'what Gladys is carrying behind her. Naughty Gladys!' And trees  and flowers--everything around me--shook with laughter. Then I grew  hot and cold all over, and did not know which way to look for my  confusion, till a willow, having compassion on me said, 'Take no  notice of them! They don't know any better.'    \"I begged him to explain to me why they were so amused, and he grew  very embarrassed and uncomfortable, and stammered--oh! so funnily,  'Well if you really wish to know--it's a bud, a baby white rose, and  it's clinging to your dress.'    \"'A baby! A baby rose!' shrieked all the flowers.    \"'And it means,' a bluebell said, stepping perkily out from amidst  its fellows, 'that your lover is coming--your lover with a  troll-le-loll-la--and--well, if you want to know more ask the  gooseberries, the gooseberries that hang on the bushes, or the parsley  that grows in the bed,'--and at that all the flowers and trees  shrieked with laughter--'Ta-ta-tra-la-la'--and with my ears full of  the rude laughter of the wood I awoke. What do you think of it? Isn't  it rather a quaint mixture of the--of the sacred--at least the  artistic--and the profane?\"    \"Quite so,\" said Miss Templeton with an amused chuckle, \"but I  shouldn't ask for an interpretation of it if I were you.\"    \"Not for an interpretation of the trees and flowers?\" Gladys asked  innocently. \"I'm sure trees and flowers have a special significance in  dreams.\"    \"Very well then, my dear, ask Mrs. Sprat.\"    \"What! ask the Vicar's wife!\" Gladys ejaculated, \"when I never go to  church.\"    \"Certainly,\" Miss Templeton replied, laughing again, \"Mrs. Sprat will  quite understand. And I've always been told she is very interested in  anything to do with the Occult. But hush! Here's your father. You'd  better not tell him your dream. He's tired to death, he says, of  hearing about your lovers, and agrees with me--there's no end to  them.\"    \"Never mind what he says--his bark's worse then his bite,\" Gladys  rejoined, \"he doesn't really care how many I have so long as they keep  within bounds, and I like them! Father!\"    John Martin, who entered the room at that moment, went straight to his  daughter to be kissed.    \"I wish you wouldn't always select that bald spot,\" he said testily,  \"I don't want to be everlastingly reminded I'm losing my hair.\"    \"Where do you want me to kiss you, then?\" Gladys argued, \"on the tip  of your nose? That's all very well for you, John Martin, but I prefer  the top of your head. But the poor dear looks worried, what is it?\"    \"I didn't have a very good night,\" her father replied, \"I dreamed a  lot!\" Gladys looked at Miss Templeton and laughed.    \"Did you?\" she said gently. \"What a shame! I never dream. What was it  all about?\"    \"Flowers!\" John Martin snapped, \"idiotic flowers! Roses, lilac,  tulips! Bah! I do wish you would have some other hobby.\"    Gladys looked at her aunt again, this time with a half serious, half  questioning expression.    \"Shall I be a politician?\" she cooed, \"and fill the house with  suffragettes? You bad man, I believe you would revel in it. Don't you  think so, Auntie?\"    \"I think, instead of teasing your father so unmercifully, you had  better pour him out a cup of tea,\" Miss Templeton replied. \"Jack,  there's a letter for you.\"    \"Where? Under my plate! what a place to put it. That's you,\" and John "]]]
