Then he was really very  ordinary-looking--with a moustache, an unwrinkled face, and a sloping  forehead.  The only wonderful thing about him was his melancholy.  When I was playing the piano, once, in the green room at the Queen's  Theatre, he came in and listened.  I remember being made aware of his  presence by his sigh--the deepest, profoundest, sincerest sigh I ever  heard from any human being.  He asked me if I would not play the piece  again.  The incident impressed itself on my mind, inseparably  associated with a picture of him as he looked at thirty--a picture by  no means pleasing.  He looked conceited, and almost savagely proud of  the isolation in which he lived.  There was a touch of exaggeration in  his appearance, a dash of Werther, with a few flourishes of Jingle!  Nervously sensitive to ridicule, self-conscious, suffering deeply from  his inability to express himself through his art, Henry Irving in 1867  was a very different person from the Henry Irving who called on me at  Longridge Road in 1878.  In ten years he had found himself, and so  lost himself--lost, I mean, much of that stiff, ugly  self-consciousness which had encased him as the shell encases the  lobster.  His forehead had become more massive, and the very outline  of his features had altered.  He was a man of the world, whose  strenuous fighting now was to be done as a general--not, as hitherto,  in the ranks.  His manner was very quiet and gentle.  \"In quietness  and confidence shall be your strength,\" says the psalmist.  That was  always like Henry Irving.    And here, perhaps, is the place to say that I, of all people, can  perhaps appreciate Henry Irving least justly, although I was his  associate on the stage for a quarter of a century, and was on terms of  the closest friendship with him for almost as long a time.  He had  precisely the qualities that I never find likable.        IRVING'S EGOTISM    He was an egotist, an egotist of the great type, never \"a mean  egotist,\" as he was once slanderously described; and all his faults  sprang from egotism, which is, after all, only another name for  greatness.  So much absorbed was he in his own achievement that he was  unable or unwilling to appreciate the achievements of others.  I never  heard him speak in high terms of the great foreign actors and  actresses who from time to time visited England.  It would be easy to  attribute this to jealousy, but the easy explanation is not the true  one.  He simply would not give himself up to appreciation.  Perhaps  appreciation is a wasting though a generous quality of the mind and  heart, and best left to lookers-on who have plenty of time to develop  it.    I was with him when he saw Sarah Bernhardt act for the first time.  The play was \"Ruy Blas,\" and it was one of Sarah's bad days.  She was  walking through the part listlessly, and I was angry that there should  be any ground for Henry's indifference.  The same thing happened years  later when I took him to see Eleonora Duse.  The play was  \"Locandiera,\" to which she was eminently unsuited, I think.  He was  surprised at my enthusiasm.  There was an element of justice in his  attitude toward the performance which infuriated me, but I doubt if he  would have shown more enthusiasm if he had seen her at her best.    As the years went on he grew very much attached to Sarah Bernhardt,  and admired her as a colleague whose managerial work in the theatre  was as dignified as his own; but of her superb powers as an actress I  don't believe he ever had a glimmering notion!    Perhaps it is not true, but, as I believe it to be true, I may as well  state it: It was never any pleasure to him to see the acting of other  actors and actresses.  Salvini's Othello I know he thought  magnificent, but he would not speak of it.        IRVING'S SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER    How dangerous it is to write things that may not be understood!  What  I have written I have written merely to indicate the qualities in  Henry Irving's nature which were unintelligible to me, perhaps because  I have always been more woman than artist.  He always put the theatre  first.  He lived in it, he died in it.  He had none of my bourgeois  qualities--the love of being in love, the love of a home, the dislike  of solitude.  I have always thought it hard to find my inferiors.  He  was sure of his high place.  In some ways he was far simpler than I.  He would talk, for instance, in such an ignorant way to painters and  musicians that I blushed for him.  But was not my blush far more  unworthy than his freedom from all pretentiousness in matters of art?    He never pretended.  One of his biographers had said that he posed as  being a French scholar.  Such a thing, and all things like it, were  impossible to his nature.  If it were necessary, in one of his plays,  to say a few French words, he took infinite pains to learn them, and  said them beautifully.    Henry once told me that in the early part of his career, before I knew  him, he had been hooted because of his thin legs.  The first service I  did him was to tell him that they were beautiful, and to make him give  up padding them.    \"What do you want with fat, podgy, prize-fighter legs!\" I  expostulated.    I brought help, too, in pictorial matters.  Henry Irving had had  little training in such matters; I had had a great deal.  Judgment  about colours, clothes, and lighting must be trained.  I had learned  from Mr. Watts, from Mr. Goodwin, and from other artists, until a  sense of decorative effect had become second nature to me.    Praise to some people at certain stages of their career is more  developing than blame.  I admired the very things in Henry for which  other people criticised him.  I hope this helped him a little.        RICHARD MANSFIELD    [Richard Mansfield, one of the great actors of his time, was born in  Heligoland, then a British Possession, in 1857.  He prepared himself  for the East Indian civil service, then studied art, and opened a  studio in Boston.  He was soon attracted to the stage, and began  playing minor parts in comic opera, displaying marked ability from the  first.  His versatility took him all the way from the role of Koko in  the \"Mikado,\" to Beau Brummel and Richard III.  His success soon  enabled him to assemble a company of his own; as its manager he  produced with memorable effect \"Cyrano de Bergerac,\" \"Henry V.,\" and  \"Julius Caesar.\"  He died in 1907, a few weeks after a striking  creation of \"Peer Gynt.\"  A biography of Mr. Mansfield by Mr. Paul  Wilstach is published by C. Scribner's Sons, New York.    Mr. Mansfield's article on \"Man and the Actor,\" which appeared in the  _Atlantic Monthly_, May, 1906, copyright by Houghton, Mifflin & Co.,  Boston, is here given almost in full by the kind permission of the  publishers and of Mrs. Richard Mansfield.  It is in effect an  autobiographical revelation of the artist and the man.--ED.]        MAN AND THE ACTOR         I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,       A stage where every man must play a part.    Shakespeare does not say \"may\" play a part, or \"can\" play a part, but  he says _must_ play a part; and he has expressed the conviction of  every intelligent student of humanity then and thereafter, now and  hereafter.  The stage cannot be held in contempt by mankind; because  all mankind is acting, and every human being is playing a part.  The  better a man plays his part, the better he succeeds.  The more a man  knows of the art of acting, the greater the man; for, from the king on  his throne to the beggar in the street, every man is acting.  There is  no greater comedian or tragedian in the world than a great king.  The  knowledge of the art of acting is indispensable to a knowledge of  mankind, and when you are able to pierce the disguise in which every  man arrays himself, or to read the character which every man assumes,  you achieve an intimate knowledge of your fellow men, and you are able  to cope with the man, either as he is, or as he pretends to be.  It  was necessary for Shakespeare to be an actor in order to know men.  Without his knowledge of the stage, Shakespeare could never have been  the reader of men that he was.  And yet we are asked, \"Is the stage  worth while?\"        NAPOLEON AS ACTOR    Napoleon and Alexander were both great actors--Napoleon perhaps the  greatest actor the world has ever seen.  Whether on the bridge of  Lodi, or in his camp at Tilsit; whether addressing his soldiers in the  plains of Egypt; whether throwing open his old gray coat and saying,  \"Children, will you fire on your general?\" whether bidding farewell to  them at Fontainebleau; whether standing on the deck of the  _Bellerophon_, or on the rocks of St. Helena--he was always an actor.  Napoleon had studied the art of acting, and he knew its value.  If the  power of the eye, the power of the voice, the power of that  all-commanding gesture of the hand, failed him when he faced the  regiment of veterans on his return from Elba, he was lost.  But he had  proved and compelled his audience too often for his art to fail him  then.  The leveled guns fell.  The audience was his.  Another crown  had fallen!  By what?  A trick of the stage!  Was he willing to die  then? to be shot by his old guard?  Not he!  Did he doubt for one  moment his ability as an actor.  Not he!  If he had, he would have  been lost.  And that power to control, that power to command, once it  is possessed by a man, means that that man can play his part anywhere,  and under all circumstances and conditions.  Unconsciously or  consciously, every great man, every man who has played a great part,  has been an actor.  Each man, every man, who has made his mark has  chosen his character, the character best adapted to himself, and has  played it, and clung to it, and made his impress with it.  I have but  to conjure up the figure of Daniel Webster, who never lost"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17024"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#17)"],[1,"nd-nuts,  cassava, maize, plantains in rank profusion. The Balegga, like the  Bambarre people, trust chiefly to plantains and ground-nuts; to play  with parrots is their great amusement.    _13th November, 1870._--The men sent over to Lohombo, about thirty miles  off, got two and a half loads of dura for a small goat, but the people  were unwilling to trade. \"If we encourage Arabs to trade, they will come  and kill us with their guns,\" so they said, and it is true: the slaves  are overbearing, and when this is resented, then slaughter ensues. I got  some sweet plantains and a little oil, which is useful in cooking, and  with salt, passes for butter on bread, but all were unwilling to trade.  Monangoi was over near Lohombo, and heard of a large trading party  coming, and not far off; this may be Syde and Dugumbe, but reports are  often false. When Katomba's men were on the late foray, they were  completely overpowered, and compelled by the Manyuema to lay down their  guns and powder-horns, on pain of being instantly despatched by bow-shot:  they were mostly slaves, who could only draw the trigger and make a  noise. Katomba had to rouse out all the Arabs who could shoot, and when  they came they killed many, and gained the lost day; the Manyuema did  not kill anyone who laid down his gun and powder-horn. This is the  beginning of an end which was easily perceived when it became not a  trading, but a foray of a murdering horde of savages.    The foray above mentioned was undertaken by Katomba for twenty goats  from Kassessa!--ten men lost for twenty goats, but they will think twice  before they try another foray.    A small bird follows the \"Sassassa\" or _Buceros cristata_. It screams  and pecks at his tail till he discharges the contents of his bowels, and  then leaves him; it is called \"play\" by the natives, and by the Suaheli  \"Utane\" or \"Msaha\"--fun or wit; he follows other birds in the same  merciless way, screaming and pecking to produce purging; Manyuema call  this bird \"Mambambwa.\" The buffalo bird warns its big friend of danger,  by calling \"Chachacha,\" and the rhinoceros bird cries out, \"Tye, tye,  tye, tye,\" for the same purpose. The Manyuema call the buffalo bird  \"Mojela,\" and the Suaheli, \"Chassa.\" A climbing plant in Africa is known  as \"Ntulungope,\" which mixed with flour of dura kills mice; they swarm  in our camp and destroy everything, but Ntulungope is not near this.    The Arabs tell me that one dollar a day is ample for provisions for a  large family at Zanzibar; the food consists of wheat, rice, flesh of  goats or ox, fowls, bananas, milk, butter, sugar, eggs, mangoes, and  potatoes. Ambergris is boiled in milk and sugar, and used by the Hindoos  as a means of increasing blood in their systems; a small quantity is a  dose; it is found along the shore of the sea at Barawa or Brava, and at  Madagascar, as if the sperm whale got rid of it while alive. Lamoo or  Amu is wealthy, and well supplied with everything, as grapes, peaches,  wheat, cattle, camels, &c. The trade is chiefly with Madagascar: the  houses are richly furnished with furniture, dishes from India, &c. At  Garaganza there are hundreds of Arab traders, there too all fruits  abound, and the climate is healthy, from its elevation. Why cannot we  missionaries imitate these Arabs in living on heights?    _24th November, 1870._--Herpes is common at the plantations in Zanzibar,  but the close crowding of the houses in the town they think prevents it;  the lips and mouth are affected, and constipation sets in for three  days, all this is cured by going over to the mainland. Affections of the  lungs are healed by residence at Bariwa or Brava, and also on the  mainland. The Tafori of Halfani took my letters from Ujiji, but who the  person employed is I do not know.    _29th November, 1870._--_Safura_ is the name of the disease of clay or  earth eating, at Zanzibar; it often affects slaves, and the clay is said  to have a pleasant odour to the eaters, but it is not confined to  slaves, nor do slaves eat in order to kill themselves; it is a diseased  appetite, and rich men who have plenty to eat are often subject to it.  The feet swell, flesh is lost, and the face looks haggard; the patient  can scarcely walk for shortness of breath and weakness, and he continues  eating till he dies. Here many slaves are now diseased with safura; the  clay built in walls is preferred, and Manyuema women when pregnant often  eat it. The cure is effected by drastic purges composed as follows: old  vinegar of cocoa-trees is put into a large basin, and old slag red-hot  cast into it, then \"Moneye,\" asafoetida, half a rupee in weight,  copperas, sulph. ditto: a small glass of this, fasting morning and  evening, produces vomiting and purging of black dejections, this is  continued for seven days; no meat is to be eaten, but only old rice or  dura and water; a fowl in course of time: no fish, butter, eggs, or  beef for two years on pain of death. Mohamad's father had skill in the  cure, and the above is his prescription. Safura is thus a disease _per  se_; it is common in Manyuema, and makes me in a measure content to wait  for my medicines; from the description, inspissated bile seems to be the  agent of blocking up the gall-duct and duodenum and the clay or earth  may be nature trying to clear it away: the clay appears unchanged in the  stools, and in large quantity. A Banyamwezi carrier, who bore an  enormous load of copper, is now by safura scarcely able to walk; he took  it at Lualaba where food is abundant, and he is contented with his lot.  Squeeze a finger-nail, and if no blood appears beneath it, safura is the  cause of the bloodlessness.    FOOTNOTES:    [8] A precisely similar epidemic broke out at the settlement at  Magomero, in which fifty-four of the slaves liberated by Dr.  Livingstone and Bishop Mackenzie died. This disease is by far the most  fatal scourge the natives suffer from, not even excepting small-pox.  It is common throughout Tropical Africa. We believe that some  important facts have recently been brought to light regarding it, and  we can only trust sincerely that the true nature of the disorder will  be known in time, so that it may be successfully treated: at present  change of air and high feeding on a meat diet are the best remedies we  know.--ED.    [9] Dr. Livingstone never ceased to impress upon Europeans the utter  necessity of living on the high table-lands of the interior, rather  than on the sea-board or the banks of the great arterial rivers. Men  may escape death in an unhealthy place, but the system is enfeebled  and energy reduced to the lowest ebb. Under such circumstances life  becomes a misery, and important results can hardly be looked for when  one's vitality is preoccupied in wrestling with the unhealthiness of  the situation, day and night.--ED.    [10] Mr. John Sunley, of Pomone, Johanna, an island in the Comoro  group.          CHAPTER IV.        Degraded state of the Manyuema. Want of writing materials.

The parrots all seize their food, and hold it  with the left hand, the lion, too, is left-handed; he strikes with the  left, so are all animals left-handed save man.    I noticed a very pretty woman come past this quite jauntily about a  month ago, on marriage with Monasimba. Ten goats were given; her friends  came and asked another goat, which being refused, she was enticed away,  became sick of rheumatic fever two days afterwards, and died yesterday.  Not a syllable of regret for the beautiful young creature does one hear,  but for the goats: \"Oh, our ten goats!\"--they cannot grieve too  much--\"Our ten goats--oh! oh!\"    Basanga wail over those who die in bed, but not over those who die in  battle: the cattle are a salve for all sores. Another man was killed  within half a mile of this: they quarrelled, and there is virtually no  chief. The man was stabbed, the village burned, and the people all fled:  they are truly a bloody people!    A man died near this, Monasimba went to his wife, and after washing he  may appear among men. If no widow can be obtained, he must sit naked  behind his house till some one happens to die, all the clothes he wore  are thrown away. They are the lowest of the low, and especially in  bloodiness: the man who killed a woman without cause goes free, he  offered his grandmother to be killed in his stead, and after a great  deal of talk nothing was done to him!    _8th December, 1870._--Suleiman-bin-Juma lived on the mainland,  Mosessame, opposite Zanzibar: it is impossible to deny his power of  foresight, except by rejecting all evidence, for he frequently foretold  the deaths of great men among Arabs, and he was pre-eminently a good  man, upright and sincere: \"Thirti,\" none like him now for goodness and  skill. He said that two middle-sized white men, with straight noses and  flowing hair down to the girdle behind, came at times, and told him  things to come. He died twelve years ago, and left no successor; he  foretold his own decease three days beforehand by cholera. \"Heresi,\" a  ball of hair rolled in the stomach of a lion, is a grand charm to the  animal and to Arabs.
