S. on it in big, white letters.    This had been Grace's idea. She had dressed the dolls with the idea of  contrasting the first Thanksgiving with that of to-day. There was a  great craning of necks from those at the one table to see the central  figures on the other, but soon every one settled down to the discussion  of the dainties provided for them.    The supper ended with a toast to their young hostess, which was drunk  standing, and then the guests repaired to the drawing room, where  impromptu stunts were in order. Every one was obliged to do something,  if only to make a remark appropriate to the occasion. Nora sang, Anne  recited, Grace and Miriam did a Spanish dance that they had practised  during vacation with remarkable spirit and effect. Jessica was then  detailed to play, and under cover of her music, Tom, Reddy, David and  Hippy left the room, Tom returning presently to announce solemnly that  an original one-act drama, entitled \"The Suffragette,\" written by Mr.  Wingate and presented by a notable cast, would be the next offering.    After a moment's wait, Hippy, Reddy and David appeared, and were greeted  with shouts of laughter. Reddy minced along in a bonnet and skirt  belonging to Mrs. Harlowe, while Hippy wore a long-sleeved gingham  pinafore of Grace's, which lacked considerable of meeting in the back,  and was kept on by means of a sash. After deliberately setting their  stage in full view of the audience at one end of the room, the play  began, with David as the meek, hen-pecked husband, Hippy as the  neglected child, who wept and howled continuously, while Reddy played  the unnatural wife and mother, who neglected her family and held woman's  suffrage meetings in the street.    The dialogue was clever, and the action of the sketch so ridiculous that  the audience laughed from the first line until the climax, especially  when the suffragette was hustled off to jail by Tom Gray, in the role of  a policeman, for disturbing the peace, while her husband and child  executed a wild dance of joy as she was hauled off the scene, protesting  vigorously.    The applause was tremendous and the cast were obliged to bow their  thanks several times before it subsided. Songs, speeches and recitations  followed rapidly until everyone had contributed something in the way of  a stunt. Then the guests formed two long lines from the living room  straight through the big archway into the drawing room, and soon a  Virginia reel was in full swing, led off by Mr. Harlowe and Mrs. Gray,  who took her steps as daintily as when she had danced at her first party  so many years before.    After the reel, the young folks romped through \"Paul Jones,\" and then  the party broke up, all declaring that never before had they had quite  such a good time.    As Grace sleepily prepared for bed, she felt a little thrill of pride at  the success of her party, and her only regret was the fact that of all  those invited, Eleanor was the only one who had refused to be present.          CHAPTER XIV    ELEANOR FINDS A WAY      Now that Thanksgiving was past, basketball became the topic of the hour.  The juniors had accepted the challenge of the senior class, and had  agreed to play them on Saturday, December 12, at two o'clock, in the  gymnasium. Only two weeks remained in which to practise. Their sorority  enthusiasm had so completely run away with them that they had even  neglected basketball until now. Therefore Grace Harlowe lost no time  in getting Miss Thompson's permission to use the gymnasium, and promptly  notified her team and the subs. to meet there, in gymnasium suits,  prepared to play, that afternoon.    The instant the last bell sounded on lessons, ten girls made for their  lockers, and fifteen minutes later the first team and the subs. were  moving toward the gymnasium deep in the discussion of the coming game  and their chances for success over their opponents.    A brief meeting was held, and the girls were assigned to their  positions. Grace had fully intended that Miriam should play center, but  when she proposed it, Miriam flatly refused to do so, and asked for her  old position of right forward.    \"You are our captain,\" she declared to Grace, \"and the best center  I ever saw on a girls' team. It would be folly to change now. Don't  you agree with me, girls?\"    Nora was detailed as left forward, while Marian Barber and Eva Allen  played right and left guards. The substitutes were also assigned their  positions and practice began.    Before they had been on the floor twenty minutes the girls were  thoroughly alive to the joy of the game and worked with the old-time  dash and spirit that had won them the championship the previous year.  Now that they were in harmony with each other, they played with  remarkable unity, and after an hour's practice Grace decided that they  were in a fair way to \"whip the seniors off the face of the earth.\"    \"I never saw you girls work better!\" she exclaimed. \"It will be a sorry  day for the seniors when we line up on the twelfth.\"    \"There'll be a great gnashing of senior teeth after the game,\" remarked  Nora confidently.    \"Do you know, girls,\" said Grace, as they left the gymnasium that  afternoon, \"I am sorry that Eleanor won't be peaceable. I wanted her to  like every bit of our school life and thought she'd surely be interested  in basketball. I suppose she will stay away from the game merely  because we are on the team. It is really a shame for her to be so  unreasonable.\"    \"Grace Harlowe, are you ever going to stop mourning over Eleanor?\" cried  Miriam impatiently. \"She doesn't deserve your regret and is too selfish  to appreciate it. I know what I am talking about because I used to be  just as ridiculous as she is, and knowing what you suffered through me,  I can't bear to see you unhappy again over some one who is too trivial  to be taken seriously.\"    \"You're a dear, Miriam!\" exclaimed Nora impulsively.    It was the first time that the once haughty Miriam had ever referred  publicly to past shortcomings, although from the time she and Grace had  settled their difficulties at the close of the sophomore year, she had  been a changed girl.    \"Where are Anne and Jessica to-day?\" asked Eva Allen.    \"Anne and Jessica have refused point blank to honor us with their  presence during practice,\" announced Nora. \"I asked Jessica to-day, and  she said that they didn't want to know how we intended to play, for then  they could wax enthusiastic and make a great deal more noise. It is  their ambition to become loud and loyal fans.\"    \"What a worthy ambition,\" said Marian Barber, with a giggle. \"They are  such noisy creatures already.\"    There was more laughing at this, as Anne and Jessica were by far the  quietest members of the sorority.    \"Remember, we practise to-morrow after school,\" called Grace as she  separated from her team at her street.    As she walked slowly down the quiet street, deep in thought, her ear  caught the sound of an approaching automobile, and she looked up just in  time to see Eleanor drive by in her machine. Grace nodded to her, but  her salutation met with a chilly stare.    \"How childish she is,\" thought Grace. \"I suppose she thinks that hurts  me. Of course it isn't exactly pleasant, but I'm going to keep on  speaking to her, just the same. I am not angry, even if she is; although  I have far greater cause to be.\"    But before the close of the week Grace was destined to cross swords with  Eleanor in earnest, and the toleration she had felt was swallowed up in  righteous indignation.    During the winter, theatrical companies sometimes visited Oakdale for a  week at a time, presenting, at popular prices, old worn-out plays and  cheap melodramas. These companies gave daily matinees as well as  evening performances, and the more frivolous element of High School  girls had in time past occasionally \"skipped school\" to spend the  afternoon in the theatre. By the girls, this form of truancy was  considered a \"lark,\" but Miss Thompson did not look at the matter in the  same light, and disciplined the culprit so severely whenever she found  this to be the cause of an afternoon's absence that the girls were slow  to offend in this respect.    All this Eleanor had heard, among other things, from Edna Wright, but  had paid little attention to it when Edna had told her. Directly after  cutting Grace Harlowe, she had turned her runabout into Main Street,  where a billboard had caught her eye, displaying in glaring red and blue  lettering the fact that the \"Peerless Dramatic Company\" would open a  week's engagement in Oakdale with daily matinees.    Eleanor's eyes sparkled. She halted her machine, scanning curiously the  list of plays on the billboard. \"The Nihilist's Daughter\" was scheduled  for Thursday afternoon, and Eleanor decided to go. She wasn't afraid of  Miss Thompson. Then, possessed with a sudden idea, she laughed  gleefully. At last she had found a way to effectually annoy the  principal.          CHAPTER XV    A WOULD-BE \"LARK\"      Eleanor Savell and the seven girls who formed their sorority were the  first to enter the study hall on Tuesday morning. As soon as a girl from  any of the three lower classes appeared she was approached by some of  the former and a great deal of whispering and subdued laughter went on.  A few girls were seen to shake their heads dubiously, and a number of  those termed \"grinds\" were not interviewed. The majority, however,  appeared to be highly delighted over what they heard, one group standing  near one of the windows, of which Eleanor was the center, laughed so  loudly that they were sent to their seats.    Among the number to whom nothing was said were the members of the Phi  Sigma Tau, and as the morning advanced they became fully aware that  something unusual was in the wind. Several times they caught sight of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17860"],[0,"Stories from Hans Andersen (#17)"],[1,".    At night, in the moonlight, when all were asleep, except the steersman  who stood at the helm, she sat at the side of the ship trying to pierce  the clear water with her eyes, and fancied she saw her father's palace,  and above it her old grandmother with her silver crown on her head,  looking up through the cross currents towards the keel of the ship. Then  her sisters rose above the water; they gazed sadly at her, wringing  their white hands. She beckoned to them, smiled, and was about to tell  them that all was going well and happily with her, when the cabin-boy  approached, and the sisters dived down, but he supposed that the white  objects he had seen were nothing but flakes of foam.    The next morning the ship entered the harbour of the neighbouring king's  magnificent city. The church bells rang and trumpets were sounded from  every lofty tower, while the soldiers paraded with flags flying and  glittering bayonets. There was a _fete_ every day, there was a  succession of balls, and receptions followed one after the other, but  the princess was not yet present; she was being brought up a long way  off, in a holy Temple they said, and was learning all the royal virtues.  At last she came. The little mermaid stood eager to see her beauty, and  she was obliged to confess that a lovelier creature she had never  beheld. Her complexion was exquisitely pure and delicate, and her  trustful eyes of the deepest blue shone through their dark lashes.    'It is you,' said the prince, 'you who saved me when I lay almost  lifeless on the beach?' and he clasped his blushing bride to his heart.  'Oh! I am too happy!' he exclaimed to the little mermaid.    'A greater joy than I had dared to hope for has come to pass. You will  rejoice at my joy, for you love me better than any one.' Then the little  mermaid kissed his hand, and felt as if her heart were broken already.    His wedding morn would bring death to her and change her to foam.    All the church bells pealed and heralds rode through the town  proclaiming the nuptials. Upon every altar throughout the land fragrant  oil was burnt in costly silver lamps. Amidst the swinging of censers by  the priests the bride and bridegroom joined hands and received the  bishop's blessing. The little mermaid dressed in silk and gold stood  holding the bride's train, but her ears were deaf to the festal strains,  her eyes saw nothing of the sacred ceremony; she was thinking of her  coming death and of all that she had lost in this world.    That same evening the bride and bridegroom embarked, amidst the roar of  cannon and the waving of banners. A royal tent of purple and gold softly  cushioned was raised amidships where the bridal pair were to repose  during the calm cool night.    The sails swelled in the wind and the ship skimmed lightly and almost  without motion over the transparent sea.    At dusk lanterns of many colours were lighted and the sailors danced  merrily on deck. The little mermaid could not help thinking of the first  time she came up from the sea and saw the same splendour and gaiety; and  she now threw herself among the dancers, whirling, as a swallow skims  through the air when pursued. The onlookers cheered her in amazement,  never had she danced so divinely; her delicate feet pained her as if  they were cut with knives, but she did not feel it, for the pain at her  heart was much sharper. She knew that it was the last night that she  would breathe the same air as he, and would look upon the mighty deep,  and the blue starry heavens; an endless night without thought and  without dreams awaited her, who neither had a soul, nor could win one.  The joy and revelry on board lasted till long past midnight; she went on  laughing and dancing with the thought of death all the time in her  heart. The prince caressed his lovely bride and she played with his  raven locks, and with their arms entwined they retired to the gorgeous  tent. All became hushed and still on board the ship, only the steersman  stood at the helm; the little mermaid laid her white arms on the gunwale  and looked eastwards for the pink-tinted dawn; the first sunbeam, she  knew, would be her death. Then she saw her sisters rise from the water;  they were as pale as she was; their beautiful long hair no longer  floated on the breeze, for it had been cut off.    [Illustration: _Once more she looked at the prince, with her eyes  already dimmed by death, then dashed overboard and fell, her body  dissolving into foam._]    'We have given it to the witch to obtain her help, so that you may not  die to-night! She has given us a knife; here it is, look how sharp it  is! Before the sun rises, you must plunge it into the prince's heart,  and when his warm blood sprinkles your feet they will join together and  grow into a tail, and you will once more be a mermaid; you will be able  to come down into the water to us, and to live out your three hundred  years before you are turned into dead, salt sea-foam. Make haste! you or  he must die before sunrise! Our old grandmother is so full of grief that  her white hair has fallen off as ours fell under the witch's scissors.  Slay the prince and come back to us! Quick! Quick! do you not see  the rosy streak in the sky? In a few minutes the sun will rise and then  you must die!' saying this they heaved a wondrous deep sigh and sank  among the waves.    The little mermaid drew aside the purple curtain from the tent and  looked at the beautiful bride asleep with her head on the prince's  breast. She bent over him and kissed his fair brow, looked at the sky  where the dawn was spreading fast, looked at the sharp knife, and again  fixed her eyes on the prince, who, in his dream called his bride by  name. Yes! she alone was in his thoughts! For a moment the knife  quivered in her grasp, then she threw it far out among the waves, now  rosy in the morning light, and where it fell the water bubbled up like  drops of blood.    Once more she looked at the prince, with her eyes already dimmed by  death, then dashed overboard and fell, her body dissolving into foam.    Now the sun rose from the sea and with its kindly beams warmed the  deadly cold foam, so that the little mermaid did not feel the chill of  death. She saw the bright sun, and above her floated hundreds of  beauteous ethereal beings, through which she could see the white ship  and the rosy heavens; their voices were melodious, but so spirit-like  that no human ear could hear them, any more than earthly eye could see  their forms. Light as bubbles they floated through the air without the  aid of wings. The little mermaid perceived that she had a form like  theirs; it gradually took shape out of the foam. 'To whom am I coming?'  said she, and her voice sounded like that of the other beings, so  unearthly in its beauty that no music of ours could reproduce it.    'To the daughters of the air!' answered the others; 'a mermaid has no  undying soul, and can never gain one without winning the love of a human  being. Her eternal life must depend upon an unknown power. Nor have the  daughters of the air an everlasting soul, but by their own good deeds  they may create one for themselves. We fly to the tropics where mankind  is the victim of hot and pestilent winds; there we bring cooling  breezes. We diffuse the scent of flowers all around, and bring  refreshment and healing in our train. When, for three hundred years, we  have laboured to do all the good in our power, we gain an undying soul  and take a part in the everlasting joys of mankind. You, poor little  mermaid, have with your whole heart struggled for the same thing as we  have struggled for. You have suffered and endured, raised yourself to  the spirit-world of the air, and now, by your own good deeds you may, in  the course of three hundred years, work out for yourself an undying  soul.'    Then the little mermaid lifted her transparent arms towards God's sun,  and for the first time shed tears.    On board ship all was again life and bustle. She saw the prince with his  lovely bride searching for her; they looked sadly at the bubbling foam,  as if they knew that she had thrown herself into the waves. Unseen she  kissed the bride on her brow, smiled at the prince, and rose aloft with  the other spirits of the air to the rosy clouds which sailed above.    'In three hundred years we shall thus float into Paradise.'    'We might reach it sooner,' whispered one. 'Unseen we flit into those  homes of men where there are children, and for every day that we find a  good child who gives pleasure to its parents and deserves their love God  shortens our time of probation. The child does not know when we fly  through the room, and when we smile with pleasure at it one year of our  three hundred is taken away. But if we see a naughty or badly disposed  child, we cannot help shedding tears of sorrow, and every tear adds a  day to the time of our probation.'          THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES      Many years ago there was an Emperor, who was so excessively fond of new  clothes that he spent all his money on them. He cared nothing about his  soldiers, nor for the theatre, nor for driving in the woods except for  the sake of showing off his new clothes. He had a costume for every hour  in the day, and instead of saying, as one does about any other king or  emperor, 'He is in his council chamber,' here one always said, 'The  Emperor is in his dressing-room.'    Life was very gay in the great town where he lived; hosts of strangers  came to visit it every day, and among them one day two swindlers. They  gave themselves out as weavers, and said that they knew how to weave the  most beautiful stuffs imaginable. Not only were the colours and patterns  unusually fine, but the clothes that were made of the stuffs had the  peculiar quality of becoming invisible to every person who was not fit  for the office he held, or if he was impossibly dull.    'Those must be splendid clothes,' "]]]
