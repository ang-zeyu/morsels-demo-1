She lay  back in her chair in an agony of suspense, the perspiration standing in  cold drops on her brow.    But the sound of wheels roused her and looking out she saw the Oaks and  Ion carriages drive up, young Horace and Rosie alight from the one, Mr.  Travilla and Elsie from the other.    \"Oh!\" thought Molly, \"Cousin Elsie will be sure to think of me directly  and I shall not be left much longer in this horrible suspense.\"    Her confidence was not misplaced. Not many minutes had elapsed when her  door was softly opened, a light step crossed the floor and a sweet fair  face, full of tender compassion, bent over the grief-stricken girl.    Molly tried to speak; her tongue refused its office, but Elsie quickly  answered the mute questioning of the wild, frightened, anguished eyes.    \"There is life,\" she said, taking the cold hands in hers, \"life in both;  and 'while there is life there is hope.' Our dear old grandfather has a  broken leg and arm and a few slight cuts and bruises, but is restored to  consciousness now, and able to speak. Your poor mother has fared still  worse, we fear, as the principal injury is to the head, but we will hope  for the best in her case also.\"    Molly dropped her head on her cousin's shoulder while a burst of weeping  brought partial relief to the overburdened heart.    Elsie clasped her arms about her and strove to soothe and comfort her  with caresses and endearing words.    \"If I could only nurse mother now,\" sobbed the girl, \"how glad I'd be to  do it. O cousin, it most breaks my heart now to think how I've vexed and  worried her since--since this dreadful trouble came to me. I'd give  anything never to have said a cross or disrespectful word to her. And now  I can do nothing for her! nothing, nothing!\" and she wrung her hands in  grief and despair.    \"Yes, dear child; there is one thing you can do,\" Elsie answered, weeping  with her.    \"What, what is that?\" asked Molly, half incredulously, half hopefully,  \"what can I do chained here?\"    \"Pray for her, Molly, plead for her with him unto whom belong the issues  from death; to him who has all power in heaven and in earth and who is  able to save to the uttermost.\"    \"No, no, even that I can't do,\" sobbed Molly, \"I've never learned to pray,  and he isn't my friend as he is yours and your children's!\"    \"Then first of all make him your friend; oh, he is so kind and merciful  and loving. He says, 'Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,  and I will give you rest.' 'Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast  out.'\"    \"Oh, if I only knew how!\" sighed Molly, \"nobody needs such a friend more  than I. I'd give all the world to have him for mine.\"    \"But you cannot buy his friendship--his salvation; it is 'without money  and without price.' What is it to come to him? Just to take him at his  word, give yourself to him and believe his promise that he will not cast  you out.\"    There was a tap at the door and Rosie came in, put her arms round Molly,  kissed her and wept with her.    Then young Horace followed and after that his father. Both seemed to feel  very much for Molly and to be anxious to do everything in their power to  help and comfort her.    Mr. Dinsmore was evidently in deep grief and soon withdrew, Elsie going  with him. They stood together for a few minute in the hall.    \"My dear father, how I feel for you!\" Elsie said, laying her hand on his  arm and looking up at him through gathering tears.    \"Thank you, my child; your sympathy is always very sweet to me,\" he said.  \"And you have mine; for I know this trial touches you also though somewhat  less nearly than myself.\"    \"Is grandpa suffering much?\" she asked.    \"Very much; and at his age--but I will not anticipate sorrow; we know that  the event is in the hands of him who doeth all things well. Ah, if he were  only a Christian! And Enna! poor Enna!\"    Sobs and cries coming from the nursery broke in upon the momentary silence  that followed the exclamation.    \"Poor little Bob and Betty, I must go to them,\" Elsie said, gliding away  in the direction of the sounds, while Mr. Dinsmore returned to the room  where his father lay groaning with the pain of his wounds. Mr. Travilla,  Calhoun and the doctor were with him, but he was asking for his son.    \"Horace,\" he said, \"can't you stay with me?\"    \"Yes, father, night and day while you want me.\"    \"That's right! It's a good thing to have a good son. Dr. Barton, where are  you going?\"    \"To your daughter, sir, Mrs. Johnson.\"    \"Enna! is she much hurt?\" asked the old man, starting up, but falling back  instantly with almost a scream of pain.    \"You must lie still, sir, indeed you must,\" said the doctor, coming back  to the bed; \"your life depends upon your keeping quiet and exciting  yourself as little as possible.\"    \"Yes, yes; but Enna?\"    \"Has no bones broken.\"    \"Thank God for that! then she'll do. Go, doctor, but don't leave the house  without seeing me again.\"    They were glad he was so easily satisfied, but knew he would not be if his  mind were quite clear.    Dick had come home in strong excitement, rumors of the accident having met  him on the way. The horses had taken fright at the sudden shriek of a  locomotive, and the breaking of a defective bit had deprived the old  gentleman of the power to control them. They ran madly down a steep  embankment, wrecking the carriage and throwing both passengers out upon a  bed of stones.    Pale and trembling the lad went straight to his mother's room where he  found her lying moaning on the bed, recognizing no one, unconscious of  anything that was going on about her.    He discovered that he loved her far more than he would have believed; he  thought her dying, and his heart smote him, as memory recalled many a  passionate, undutiful word he had spoken to her; often, it is true, under  great provocation, but oh, what would he not now have given to recall  them.    He had much ado to control his emotion sufficiently to ask the doctor what  he thought of her case. He was somewhat comforted by the reply,    \"The injury to the head is very serious, yet I by no means despair of her  life.\"    \"What can I do for her?\" was the boy's next question in an imploring tone  as though he would esteem it a boon to be permitted to do something for  her relief.    \"Nothing; we have plenty of help here, and you are too inexperienced for a  nurse,\" Dr. Barton said, not unkindly. \"But see to your sister Molly,\" he  added. \"Poor child! she will feel this sorely.\"    The admonition was quite superfluous; Dick was already hastening to her.    Another moment and she was weening out her sorrow and anxiety on his  shoulder.    \"O Dick,\" she sobbed, \"I'm afraid I can never speak to her again, and--and  my last words to her, just before she went, were a reproach. I said I'd  never ask her for sympathy again; and now I never can. Oh isn't it  dreadful, dreadful!\" and she wept as if her very heart would break.    \"Oh, don't, Molly!\" he said hoarsely, pressing her closer to him and  mingling his tears with hers, \"who could blame you, you poor suffering  thing! and I'm sure you must have been provoked to it. She hadn't been  saying anything kind to you?\"    Molly shook her head with a fresh burst of grief. \"No, oh no! oh, if we'd  parted like Cousin Elsie and her children always do!--with kind, loving  words and caresses.\"    \"But we're not that sort, you know,\" returned Dick with an awkward attempt  at consolation, \"and I'm worse than you, a great deal, for I've talked up  to mother many a time and didn't have the same excuse.\"    There was sickness at Pinegrove. Mrs. Howard was slowly recovering from an  attack of typhoid fever. This was why she had not hastened to Roselands to  the assistance of her injured father and sister.    And Mrs. Rose Dinsmore was at Ashlands, helping Sophie nurse her children  through the scarlet fever. And so, Mrs. Conly being still absent at the  North, the burden of these new responsibilities must fall upon Mr. Horace  Dinsmore and his children.    Mr. Dinsmore undertook the care of his father, Mr. Travilla and young  Horace engaging to relieve him now and then, Elsie that of Enna; her  children, except the baby, who with mammy must come to Roselands also,  could do without her for a time. It would be hard for both her and them,  she knew, but the lesson in self-denial for the sake of others, might  prove more than a compensation; and Enna must not, in her critical state,  be left to the care of servants.    Rosie volunteered to see that Molly was not neglected, and to exert  herself for the poor girl's entertainment, and Bob and Betty were sent to  the Oaks to be looked after by Mrs. Murray and their cousin Horace.    It would be no easy or agreeable task for the old lady, but she was sure  not to object in view of the fact that quiet was essential to the recovery  of the sufferers at Roselands.          CHAPTER FIFTEENTH.        \"Great minds, like heaven, are pleased in doing good,       Though the ungrateful subjects of their favors       Are barren in return.\"                                              --ROWE.      The short winter day was closing in. At Ion, five eager, expectant little  faces were looking out upon the avenue, where slowly and softly, tiny  snowflakes were falling, the only moving thing within range of their  vision.    \"Oh, dear, what does keep papa and mamma so long!\" cried Vi, impatiently;  \"it seems most like a year since they started.\"    \"Oh, no, Vi, not half a day yet!\"    \"I don't mean it _is_, Eddie, but it does _seem_ like it to me. Elsie, do  you think anything's happened?\"    \"One of the horses may have lost a shoe,\" Elsie said, trying to be very  cheerful, and putting her arm round Violet as she spoke. \"I remember that  happened once a good while ago. But if mamma were here, don't you know  what she would say, little sister?\"    \"Yes; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14880"],[0,"McGuffey's Fourth Eclectic Reader (#17)"],[1,"Jones?

(116)    By James Russell Lowell, one of the most noted of American poets; also  well known as an essayist and lecturer. He was born at Cambridge, Mass.,  in 1819, and died there in 1891.          1.  Into the sunshine,  Full of the light,  Leaping and flashing,  From morn till night!          2.  Into the moonlight,  Whiter than snow,  Waving so flower-like  When the winds blow!          3.  Into the starlight,  Rushing in spray,  Happy at midnight,  Happy by day!          4.  Ever in motion,  Blithesome and cheery,  Still climbing heavenward,  Never aweary;          5.  Glad of all weathers,  Still seeming best,  Upward or downward,  Motion, thy rest;          6.  Full of a nature  Nothing can tame,  Changed every moment,  Ever the same;          7.  Ceaseless aspiring,  Ceaseless content,  Darkness or sunshine  Thy element;          8.  Glorious fountain!  Let my heart be  Fresh, changeful, constant,  Upward like thee!      DEFINITIONS.--4. Blithe'some, gay. Cheer'y, in good spirits. A-wea'ry,  weary, tired. 7. As-pir'ing, ambitious. El'e-ment, the proper habitation  or sphere of anything, suitable state. 8. Con'-stant, fixed, not to be  changed.        XLII. COFFEE. (117)    1. The coffee tree is a native of eastern Africa, but it was in Arabia  that it first became known to the people of Europe, and until about the  year 1700 A. D. that country afforded the entire supply.    2. Then the coffee seeds found their way to Java, by means of some  traders, and one of the first plants grown on that island was sent as a  present to the governor of the Dutch East India Company, who lived in  Holland.    3. It was planted in the Botanical Gardens at Amsterdam, and in a few  years seeds taken from it were sent to South America, where the  cultivation of coffee has steadily increased, extending to the West  Indies, until now the offspring of this one plant produce more coffee than  is obtained from all the other plants in the world.    4. The plant is an evergreen, and is from six to twelve feet high, the  stem being from ten to fifteen inches in diameter. The lower branches bend  down when the tree begins to grow old, and extend themselves into a round  form somewhat like an umbrella; and the wood is so pliable that the ends  of the largest branches may be bent down to within two or three feet of  the earth.    5. The bark is whitish and somewhat rough. A tree is never without leaves,  which are at small distances from one another, and on almost opposite  sides of a bough. Blossoms and green and ripe fruit may be seen on the  same tree at the same time. When the blossom falls off, there grows in its  place a small green fruit, which becomes dark red as it ripens.    6. This fruit is not unlike a cherry, and is very good to eat. Under the  pulp of this cherry is found the bean or berry we call coffee, wrapped in  a fine, thin skin. The berry is at first very soft, and has a bad taste;  but as the cherry ripens the berry grows harder, and the dried-up fruit  becomes a shell or pod of a deep brown color.    7. The berry is now solid, and its color is a translucent green. Each  shell contains two seeds, rounded on one side and flat on the other. The  seeds lie with the flat sides together, and, in one highly prized variety,  the two seeds grow together, forming one: this is known as the pea berry.  When the fruit is so ripe that it can be shaken from the tree, the husks  are separated from the berries, and are used, in Arabia, by the natives,  while the berries are sold.    8. The young plants are inserted in holes from twelve to eighteen inches  deep, and six or eight feet apart. If left to themselves, they would grow  to the height of eighteen or twenty feet; but they are usually dwarfed by  pruning, so that the fruit may be easily got at by the gatherer.    9. Thus dwarfed, they extend their branches until they cover the whole  space about them. They begin to yield fruit the third year. By the sixth  or seventh year they are at full bearing, and continue to bear for twenty  years or more.    l0. Before the berry can be used, it undergoes a process of roasting. The  amount of aromatic oil brought out in roasting has much to do with the  market value of coffee, and it has been found that the longer the raw  coffee is kept, the richer it becomes in this peculiar oil, and so the  more valuable. But after the coffee is roasted, and especially after it is  ground, it loses its aroma rapidly.    11. Arabia produces the celebrated Mocha, or \"Mokha,\" coffee, which is the  finest in the world; but little or none of the best product is ever taken  out of that country. The Java coffee from the East Indies is next prized,  but the best quality of this kind is also quite difficult to obtain, and  many, therefore, prefer the finest grades of Rio coffee from South America  to such Mocha and Java as can be had in our country.      DEFINITIONS.--l. Af-ford'ed, yielded, produced. 3. Off'spring,  descendants, however remote, from, the stock. 4. Pli'a-ble, easily bent.  7. Trans-lu'cent, permitting the passage of light. 8. Prun'-ing, trimming.  10. Ar-o-mat'ic, containing aroma, fragrant.      EXERCISES.--What country first supplied coffee? How did the plant come to  be grown in other countries? Describe the plant. What is said of the  fruit? How are the plants cultivated? What is said about the roasting of  coffee? What are the three principal kinds of coffee used, and how are  they valued?        XLIII. THE WINTER KING. (120)    1. Oh! what will become of thee, poor little bird?     The muttering storm in the distance is heard;     The rough winds are waking, the clouds growing black,     They'll soon scatter snowflakes all over thy back!     From what sunny clime hast thou wandered away?     And what art thou doing this cold winter day?    2. \"I'm picking the gum from the old peach tree;     The storm doesn't trouble me. Pee, dee, dee!\"    3. But what makes thee seem so unconscious of care?     The brown earth is frozen, the branches are bare:     And how canst thou be so light-hearted and free,     As if danger and suffering thou never should'st see,     When no place is near for thy evening nest,     No leaf for thy screen, for thy bosom no rest?    4. \"Because the same Hand is a shelter for me,     That took off the summer leaves. Pee, dee, dee!\"    5. But man feels a burden of care and of grief,     While plucking the cluster and binding the sheaf:     In the summer we faint, in the winter we're chilled,     With ever a void that is yet to be filled.     We take from the ocean, the earth, and the air,     Yet all their rich gifts do not silence our care.    6. \"A very small portion sufficient will be,     If sweetened with gratitude. Pee, dee, dee!\"    7. But soon there'll be ice weighing down the light bough,     On which thou art flitting so playfully now;     And though there's a vesture well fitted and warm,     Protecting the rest of thy delicate form,     What, then, wilt thou do with thy little bare feet,     To save them from pain, mid the frost and the sleet?    8. \"I can draw them right up in my feathers, you see,     To warm them, and fly away. Pee, dee, dee!\"    9. I thank thee, bright monitor; what thou hast taught     Will oft be the theme of the happiest thought;     We look at the clouds; while the birds have an eye     To Him who reigns over them, changeless and high.     And now little hero, just tell me thy name,     That I may be sure whence my oracle came.    10. \"Because, in all weather, I'm merry and free,      They call me the Winter King. Pee, dee, dee!\"      DEFINITIONS.--l. Mut'ter-ing, murmuring, rumbling. 3. Un-con'scious, not  knowing, not perceiving. 5. Clus'ter, a bunch. 7. Flit'ing, moving about  in a lively manner. Ves'ture, clothing, covering. 9. Mon'i-tor, one who  warns of faults. Or'a-cle, a wise sentence or decision.        XLIV. THE NETTLE. (121)    1. Anna. O papa! I have stung my hand with that nettle.    2. Father. Well, my dear, I am sorry for it; but pull up that large dock  leaf you see near it; now bruise the juice out of it on the part which is  stung. Well, is the pain lessened?    3. A. Oh, very much indeed, I hardly feel it now. But I wish there was not  a nettle in the world. I am sure I do not know what use there can be in  them.    4. F. If you knew anything of botany, Nanny, you would not say so.    5.  A. What is botany, papa?    6.  F. Botany, my dear, is the knowledge of plants.    7.  A. Some plants are very beautiful. If the lily were growing in our  fields, I should not complain. But this ugly nettle! I do not know what  beauty or use there can be in that.    8. F. And yet, Nanny, there is more beauty, use, and instruction in a  nettle, than even in a lily.    9. A. O papa, how can you make that out?    10. F. Put on your gloves, pluck up that nettle, and let us examine it.  First, look at the flower.    11. A. The flower, papa? I see no flower, unless those little ragged knobs  are flowers, which have neither color nor smell, and are not much larger  than the heads of pins.    12. F. Here, take this magnifying glass and examine them.    13. A. Oh, I see now; every little knob is folded up in leaves, like a  rosebud. Perhaps there is a flower inside.    14. F. Try; take this pin and touch the knob. Well, what do you see?    15.  A. Oh, how curious!    16.  F. What is curious?    17. A. The moment I touched it, it flew open. A little cloud rose"]]]
