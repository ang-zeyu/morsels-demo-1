Had the  British force been provided with field pieces, they might have gained  the day; but, after fighting with great bravery, they were forced to  fall back; with a loss of twenty English and two officers killed and  many more wounded, while the Sepoys suffered equally severely.    One of Clive's messengers reached Murari Reo, the Mahratta chief of  Gutti. This man was a ferocious free-booting chief, daring and brave  himself, and admiring those qualities in others. Hitherto, his  alliance with Muhammud Ali was little more than nominal, for he had  dreaded bringing upon himself the vengeance of Chunda Sahib and the  French, whose ultimate success in the strife appeared certain. Clive's  march upon Arcot, and the heroic defence which the handful of men  there were opposing to overwhelming numbers, excited his highest  admiration. As he afterwards said, he had never before believed that  the English could fight, and when Clive's messenger reached him, he at  once sent back a promise of assistance.    Riza Sahib learned, almost as soon as Clive himself, that the  Mahrattas were on the move. The prospects of his communications being  harassed, by these daring horsemen, filled him with anxiety. Murari  Reo was encamped, with six thousand men, at a spot thirty miles to the  west of Arcot; and he might, at any moment, swoop down upon the  besiegers. Although, therefore, Riza Sahib had for six days been at  work effecting a new breach, which was now nearly open to assault, he  sent on the 30th of October a flag of truce, with an offer to Clive of  terms, if he would surrender Arcot.    The garrison were to be allowed to march out with their arms and  baggage, while to Clive himself he offered a large sum of money. In  case of refusal, he threatened to storm the fort, and put all its  defenders to the sword. Clive returned a defiant refusal, and the guns  again opened on the second breach.    On the 9th of November, the Mahrattas began to show themselves in the  neighbourhood of the besieging army. The force under Lieutenant Innis  had been reinforced, and was now under the command of Captain  Kilpatrick, who had a hundred and fifty English troops, with four  field guns. This was now advancing.    Four days later the new breach had attained a width of thirty yards,  but Clive had prepared defences in the rear, similar to those at the  other breach; and the difficulties of the besiegers would here be much  greater, as the ditch was not fordable.    The fifty days which the siege had lasted had been terrible ones for  the garrison. Never daring to expose themselves unnecessarily during  the day, yet ever on the alert to repel an attack; labouring at night  at the defences, with their numbers daily dwindling, and the prospect  of an assault becoming more and more imminent, the work of the little  garrison was terrible; and it is to the defences of Lucknow and  Cawnpore, a hundred years later, that we must look to find a parallel,  in English warfare, for their endurance and bravery.    Both Charlie Marryat and Peters had been wounded, but in neither case  were the injuries severe enough to prevent their continuing on duty.  Tim Kelly had his arm broken by a ball, while another bullet cut a  deep seam along his cheek, and carried away a portion of his ear. With  his arm in splints and a sling, and the side of his face covered with  strappings and plaster, he still went about his business.    \"Ah! Yer honors,\" he said one day to his masters; \"I've often been out  catching rabbits, with ferrits to drive 'em out of their holes, and  sticks to knock 'em on the head, as soon as they showed themselves;  and it's a divarshun I was always mightily fond of, but I never quite  intered into the feelings of the rabbits. Now I understand them  complately, for ain't we rabbits ourselves? The officers, saving your  presence, are the ferrits who turn us out of our holes on duty; and  the niggers yonder, with their muskets and their matchlocks, are the  men with sticks, ready to knock us on head, directly we show  ourselves. If it plase Heaven that I ever return to the ould country  again, I'll niver lend a hand at rabbiting, to my dying day.\"        Chapter 8: The Grand Assault.      The 14th of November was a Mohammedan festival, and Riza Sahib  determined to utilize the enthusiasm and fanatic zeal, which such an  occasion always excites among the followers of the Prophet, to make  his grand assault upon Arcot, and to attack at three o'clock in the  morning. Every preparation was made on the preceding day, and four  strong columns told off for the assault. Two of these were to attack  by the breaches, the other two at the gates. Rafts were prepared to  enable the party attacking by the new breach to cross the moat, while  the columns advancing against the gates were to be preceded by  elephants, who, with iron plates on their foreheads, were to charge  and batter down the gates.    Clive's spies brought him news of the intended assault, and at  midnight he learned full particulars as to the disposition of the  enemy. His force was now reduced to eighty Europeans, and a hundred  and twenty Sepoys. Every man was told off to his post, and then,  sentries being posted to arouse them at the approach of the enemy, the  little garrison lay down in their places, to get two or three hours'  sleep before the expected attack.    At three o'clock, the firing of three shells from the mortars into the  fort gave the signal for assault. The men leaped up and stood to their  arms, full of confidence in their ability to resist the attack. Soon  the shouts of the advancing columns testified to the equal confidence  and ardour of the assailants.    Not a sound was heard within the walls of the fort, until the  elephants advanced towards the gates. Then suddenly a stream of fire  leaped out from loophole and battlement. So well directed and  continuous was the fire, that the elephants, dismayed at the outburst  of fire and noise, and smarting from innumerable wounds, turned and  dashed away, trampling in their flight multitudes of men in the dense  columns packed behind them. These, deprived of the means upon which  they had relied to break in the gates, turned and retreated rapidly.    Scarcely less prolonged was the struggle at the breaches. At the first  breach, a very strong force of the enemy marched resolutely forward.  They were permitted, without a shot being fired at them, to cross the  dry ditch, mount the shattered debris of the wall, and pour into the  interior of the fort. Forward they advanced until, without a check,  they reached the first trench bristling with spikes.    Then, as they paused for a moment, from the breastwork in front of  them, from the ramparts, and every spot which commanded the trench, a  storm of musketry was poured on them; while the gunners swept the  crowded mass with grape, and bags of bullets. The effect was  tremendous. Mowed down in heaps, the assailants recoiled; and then,  without a moment's hesitation, turned and fled. Three times, strongly  reinforced, they advanced to the attack; but were each time repulsed,  with severe slaughter.    Still less successful were those at the other breach. A great raft,  capable of carrying seventy, conveyed the head of the storming party  across the ditch; and they had just reached the foot of the breach,  when Clive, who was himself at this point, turned two field pieces  upon them, with deadly effect. The raft was upset and smashed, and the  column, deprived of its intended means of crossing the ditch, desisted  from the attack.    Among those who had fallen, at the great breach, was the commander of  the storming party; a man of great valour. Four hundred of his  followers had also been killed, and Riza Sahib, utterly disheartened  at his repulse at all points, decided not to renew the attack. He had  still more than twenty men to each of the defenders; but the obstinacy  of their resistance, and the moral effect produced by it upon his  troops; the knowledge that the Mahratta horse were hovering in his  rear, and that Kilpatrick's little column was close at hand;  determined him to raise the siege.    After the repulse of the assault, the heavy musketry fire from the  houses around the fort was continued. At two in the afternoon he asked  for two hours' truce, to bury the dead. This was granted, and on its  conclusion the musketry fire was resumed, and continued until two in  the morning. Then suddenly, it ceased. Under cover of the fire, Riza  Sahib had raised the siege, and retired with his army to Vellore.    On the morning of the 15th, Clive discovered that the enemy had  disappeared. The joy of the garrison was immense. Every man felt  proud, and happy in the thought that he had taken his share in a  siege, which would not only be memorable in English history till the  end of time, but which had literally saved India to us. The little  band made the fort re-echo with their cheers, when the news came in.  Caps were thrown high in the air, and the men indulged in every  demonstration of delight.    Clive was not a man to lose time. The men were at once formed up, and  marched into the abandoned camp of the enemy; where they found four  guns, four mortars, and a great quantity of ammunition. A cloud of  dust was seen approaching, and soon a mounted officer, riding forward,  announced the arrival of Captain Kilpatrick's detachment.    Not a moment was lost, for Clive felt the importance of, at once,  following up the blow inflicted by the repulse of the enemy. Three  days were spent, in continuous labour, in putting the fort of Arcot  again in a position of defence; and, leaving Kilpatrick in charge  there, he marched out with two hundred Europeans, seven hundred  Sepoys, and three guns, and attacked and took Timari, the little fort  which before baffled him.    This done, he returned towards Arcot to await the arrival of a  thousand Mahratta horse,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18837"],[0,"Commentarii de Bello Gallico (#17)"],[1,"at. Fugere  in provinciam Romanos Galliaque excedere. Id sibi ad praesentem  obtinendam libertatem satis esse; ad reliqui temporis pacem atque otium  parum profici: maioribus enim coactis copiis reversuros neque finem  bellandi facturos. Proinde agmine impeditos adorirentur. Si pedites suis  auxilium ferant atque in eo morentur, iter facere non posse; si, id quod  magis futurum confidat, relictis impedimentis suae saluti consulant, et  usu rerum necessariarum et dignitate spoliatum iri. Nam de equitibus  hostium, quin nemo eorum progredi modo extra agmen audeat, et ipsos  quidem non debere dubitare, et quo maiore faciant animo, copias se omnes  pro castris habiturum et terrori hostibus futurum. Conclamant equites  sanctissimo iureiurando confirmari oportere, ne tecto recipiatur, ne ad  liberos, ne ad parentes, ad uxorem aditum habeat, qui non bis per agmen  hostium perequitasset.      67    Probata re atque omnibus iureiurando adactis postero die in tres partes  distributo equitatu duae se acies ab duobus lateribus ostendunt, una  primo agmine iter impedire coepit. Qua re nuntiata Caesar suum quoque  equitatum tripertito divisum contra hostem ire iubet. Pugnatur una  omnibus in partibus. Consistit agmen; impedimenta intra legiones  recipiuntur. Si qua in parte nostri laborare aut gravius premi  videbantur, eo signa inferri Caesar aciemque constitui iubebat; quae res  et hostes ad insequendum tardabat et nostros spe auxili confirmabat.  Tandem Germani ab dextro latere summum iugum nacti hostes loco  depellunt; fugientes usque ad flumen, ubi Vercingetorix cum pedestribus  copiis consederat, persecuntur compluresque interficiunt. Qua re  animadversa reliqui ne circumirentur veriti se fugae mandant. Omnibus  locis fit caedes. Tres nobilissimi Aedui capti ad Caesarem perducuntur:  Cotus, praefectus equitum, qui controversiam cum Convictolitavi proximis  comitiis habuerat, et Cavarillus, qui post defectionem Litavicci  pedestribus copiis praefuerat, et Eporedorix, quo duce ante adventum  Caesaris Aedui cum Sequanis bello contenderant.      68    Fugato omni equitatu Vercingetorix copias, ut pro castris collocaverat,  reduxit protinusque Alesiam, quod est oppidum Mandubiorum, iter facere  coepit celeriterque impedimenta ex castris educi et se subsequi iussit.  Caesar impedimentis in proximum collem deductis, duabus legionibus  praesidio relictis, secutus quantum diei tempus est passum, circiter  tribus milibus hostium ex novissimo agmine interfectis altero die ad  Alesiam castra fecit. Perspecto urbis situ perterritisque hostibus, quod  equitatu, qua maxime parte exercitus confidebant, erant pulsi,  adhortatus ad laborem milites circumvallare instituit.      69    Ipsum erat oppidum Alesia in colle summo admodum edito loco, ut nisi  obsidione expugnari non posse videretur; cuius collis radices duo duabus  ex partibus flumina subluebant. Ante id oppidum planities circiter milia  passuum tria in longitudinem patebat: reliquis ex omnibus partibus  colles mediocri interiecto spatio pari altitudinis fastigio oppidum  cingebant. Sub muro, quae pars collis ad orientem solem spectabat, hunc  omnem locum copiae Gallorum compleverant fossamque et maceriam sex in  altitudinem pedum praeduxerant. Eius munitionis quae ab Romanis  instituebatur circuitus XI milia passuum tenebat. Castra opportunis  locis erant posita ibique castella viginti tria facta, quibus in  castellis interdiu stationes ponebantur, ne qua subito eruptio fieret:  haec eadem noctu excubitoribus ac firmis praesidiis tenebantur.      70    Opere instituto fit equestre proelium in ea planitie, quam intermissam  collibus tria milia passuum in longitudinem patere supra demonstravimus.  Summa vi ab utrisque contenditur. Laborantibus nostris Caesar Germanos  summittit legionesque pro castris constituit, ne qua subito irruptio ab  hostium peditatu fiat. Praesidio legionum addito nostris animus augetur:  hostes in fugam coniecti se ipsi multitudine impediunt atque  angustioribus portis relictis coacervantur. Germani acrius usque ad  munitiones secuntur. Fit magna caedes: nonnulli relictis equis fossam  transire et maceriam transcendere conantur. Paulum legiones Caesar quas  pro vallo constituerat promoveri iubet. Non minus qui intra munitiones  erant perturbantur Galli: veniri ad se confestim existimantes ad arma  conclamant; nonnulli perterriti in oppidum irrumpunt. Vercingetorix  iubet portas claudi, ne castra nudentur. Multis interfectis, compluribus  equis captis Germani sese recipiunt.      71    Vercingetorix, priusquam munitiones ab Romanis perficiantur, consilium  capit omnem ab se equitatum noctu dimittere. Discedentibus mandat ut  suam quisque eorum civitatem adeat omnesque qui per aetatem arma ferre  possint ad bellum cogant. Sua in illos merita proponit obtestaturque ut  suae salutis rationem habeant neu se optime de communi libertate meritum  in cruciatum hostibus dedant. Quod si indiligentiores fuerint, milia  hominum delecta octoginta una secum interitura demonstrat. Ratione inita  se exigue dierum triginta habere frumentum, sed paulo etiam longius  tolerari posse parcendo. His datis mandatis, qua opus erat intermissum,  secunda vigilia silentio equitatum mittit. Frumentum omne ad se referri  iubet; capitis poenam eis qui non paruerint constituit: pecus, cuius  magna erat copia ab Mandubiis compulsa, viritim distribuit; frumentum  parce et paulatim metiri instituit; copias omnes quas pro oppido  collocaverat in oppidum recepit. His rationibus auxilia Galliae  exspectare et bellum parat administrare.      72    Quibus rebus cognitis ex perfugis et captivis, Caesar haec genera  munitionis instituit. Fossam pedum viginti directis lateribus duxit, ut  eius fossae solum tantundem pateret quantum summae fossae labra  distarent. Reliquas omnes munitiones ab ea fossa pedes quadringentos  reduxit, [id] hoc consilio, quoniam tantum esset necessario spatium  complexus, nec facile totum corpus corona militum cingeretur, ne de  improviso aut noctu ad munitiones hostium multitudo advolaret aut  interdiu tela in nostros operi destinatos conicere possent. Hoc  intermisso spatio duas fossas quindecim pedes latas, eadem altitudine  perduxit, quarum interiorem campestribus ac demissis locis aqua ex  flumine derivata complevit. Post eas aggerem ac vallum duodecim pedum  exstruxit. Huic loricam pinnasque adiecit grandibus cervis eminentibus  ad commissuras pluteorum atque aggeris, qui ascensum hostium tardarent,  et turres toto opere circumdedit, quae pedes LXXX inter se distarent.      73    Erat eodem tempore et materiari et frumentari et tantas munitiones fieri  necesse deminutis nostris copiis quae longius ab castris  progrediebantur: ac nonnum quam opera nostra Galli temptare atque  eruptionem ex oppido pluribus portis summa vi facere conabantur. Quare  ad haec rursus opera addendum Caesar putavit, quo minore numero militum  munitiones defendi possent. Itaque truncis arborum aut admodum firmis  ramis abscisis atque horum delibratis ac praeacutis cacuminibus  perpetuae fossae quinos pedes altae ducebantur. Huc illi stipites  demissi et ab infimo revincti, ne revelli possent, ab ramis eminebant.  Quini erant ordines coniuncti inter se atque implicati; quo qui  intraverant, se ipsi acutissimis vallis induebant. Hos cippos  appellabant. Ante quos obliquis ordinibus in quincuncem dispositis  scrobes tres in altitudinem pedes fodiebantur paulatim angustiore ad  infimum fastigio. Huc teretes stipites feminis crassitudine ab summo  praeacuti et praeusti demittebantur, ita ut non amplius digitis quattuor  ex terra eminerent; simul confirmandi et stabiliendi causa singuli ab  infimo solo pedes terra exculcabantur, reliqua pars scrobis ad  occultandas insidias viminibus ac virgultis integebatur. Huius generis  octoni ordines ducti ternos inter se pedes distabant. Id ex similitudine  floris lilium appellabant. Ante haec taleae pedem longae ferreis hamis  infixis totae in terram infodiebantur mediocribusque intermissis spatiis  omnibus locis disserebantur; quos stimulos nominabant.      74    His rebus perfectis regiones secutus quam potuit aequissimas pro loci  natura quattuordecim milia passuum complexus pares eiusdem generis  munitiones, diversas ab bis, contra exteriorem hostem perfecit, ut ne  magna quidem multitudine, si ita accidat, munitionum praesidia  circumfundi possent; ac ne cum periculo ex castris egredi cogatur,  dierum triginta pabulum frumentumque habere omnes convectum iubet.      75    Dum haec apud Alesiam geruntur, Galli concilio principum indicto non  omnes eos qui arma ferre possent, ut censuit Vercingetorix, convocandos  statuunt, sed certum numerum cuique ex civitate imperandum, ne tanta  multitudine confusa nec moderari nec discernere suos nec frumentandi  rationem habere possent. Imperant Aeduis atque eorum clientibus,  Segusiavis, Ambivaretis, Aulercis Brannovicibus, Blannoviis, milia XXXV;  parem numerum Arvernis adiunctis Eleutetis, Cadurcis, Gabalis,  Vellaviis, qui sub imperio Arvernorum esse consuerunt; Sequanis,  Senonibus, Biturigibus, Santonis, Rutenis, Carnutibus duodena milia;  Bellovacis X; totidem Lemovicibus; octona Pictonibus et Turonis et  Parisiis et Helvetiis; [Suessionibus,] Ambianis, Mediomatricis,  Petrocoriis, Nerviis, Morinis, Nitiobrigibus quina milia; Aulercis  Cenomanis totidem; Atrebatibus [IIII milibus]; Veliocassis, Lexoviis et  Aulercis Eburovicibus terna; Rauracis et Boiis bina; [XXX milia]  universis civitatibus, quae Oceanum attingunt quaeque eorum consuetudine  Armoricae appellantur, quo sunt in numero Curiosolites, Redones,  Ambibarii, Caletes, Osismi, Veneti, Lemovices, Venelli. Ex his Bellovaci  suum numerum non compleverunt, quod se suo nomine atque arbitrio cum  Romanis bellum gesturos dicebant neque cuiusquam imperio obtemperaturos;  rogati tamen ab Commio pro eius hospitio duo milia una miserunt.      76    Huius opera Commi, ut antea demonstravimus, fideli atque utili  superioribus annis erat usus in Britannia"]]]
