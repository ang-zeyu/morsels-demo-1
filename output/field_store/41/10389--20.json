It seeks to explain from the experience of the  individual what can only be learned from the history of the world. It  has no conception of obligation, duty, conscience--these are to the  Epicurean or Utilitarian philosopher only names which interfere with our  natural perceptions of pleasure and pain.    There seem then to be several answers to the question, Why the theory  that all knowledge is sensation is allied to the lower rather than to  the higher view of ethical philosophy:--1st, Because it is easier to  understand and practise; 2ndly, Because it is fatal to the pursuit of  ideals, moral, political, or religious; 3rdly, Because it deprives us of  the means and instruments of higher thought, of any adequate conception  of the mind, of knowledge, of conscience, of moral obligation.    ...    ON THE NATURE AND LIMITS Of PSYCHOLOGY.

Monon gar auto legeiv, osper gumnon kai aperemomenon apo ton       onton apanton, adunaton.  Soph.    Since the above essay first appeared, many books on Psychology have been  given to the world, partly based upon the views of Herbart and other  German philosophers, partly independent of them. The subject has gained  in bulk and extent; whether it has had any true growth is more doubtful.  It begins to assume the language and claim the authority of a science;  but it is only an hypothesis or outline, which may be filled up in many  ways according to the fancy of individual thinkers. The basis of it is  a precarious one,--consciousness of ourselves and a somewhat uncertain  observation of the rest of mankind. Its relations to other sciences  are not yet determined: they seem to be almost too complicated to be  ascertained. It may be compared to an irregular building, run up hastily  and not likely to last, because its foundations are weak, and in many  places rest only on the surface of the ground. It has sought rather to  put together scattered observations and to make them into a system than  to describe or prove them. It has never severely drawn the line between  facts and opinions. It has substituted a technical phraseology for the  common use of language, being neither able to win acceptance for the one  nor to get rid of the other.    The system which has thus arisen appears to be a kind of metaphysic  narrowed to the point of view of the individual mind, through which, as  through some new optical instrument limiting the sphere of vision, the  interior of thought and sensation is examined. But the individual mind  in the abstract, as distinct from the mind of a particular individual  and separated from the environment of circumstances, is a fiction only.  Yet facts which are partly true gather around this fiction and are  naturally described by the help of it. There is also a common type of  the mind which is derived from the comparison of many minds with one  another and with our own. The phenomena of which Psychology treats are  familiar to us, but they are for the most part indefinite; they relate  to a something inside the body, which seems also to overleap the limits  of space. The operations of this something, when isolated, cannot be  analyzed by us or subjected to observation and experiment. And there is  another point to be considered. The mind, when thinking, cannot  survey that part of itself which is used in thought. It can only  be contemplated in the past, that is to say, in the history of the  individual or of the world. This is the scientific method of studying  the mind. But Psychology has also some other supports, specious rather  than real. It is partly sustained by the false analogy of Physical  Science and has great expectations from its near relationship to  Physiology. We truly remark that there is an infinite complexity of  the body corresponding to the infinite subtlety of the mind; we are  conscious that they are very nearly connected. But in endeavouring to  trace the nature of the connexion we are baffled and disappointed. In  our knowledge of them the gulf remains the same: no microscope has ever  seen into thought; no reflection on ourselves has supplied the missing  link between mind and matter...These are the conditions of this very  inexact science, and we shall only know less of it by pretending to  know more, or by assigning to it a form or style to which it has not yet  attained and is not really entitled.    Experience shows that any system, however baseless and ineffectual, in  our own or in any other age, may be accepted and continue to be studied,  if it seeks to satisfy some unanswered question or is based upon some  ancient tradition, especially if it takes the form and uses the language  of inductive philosophy. The fact therefore that such a science exists  and is popular, affords no evidence of its truth or value. Many who have  pursued it far into detail have never examined the foundations on which  it rests. The have been many imaginary subjects of knowledge of which  enthusiastic persons have made a lifelong study, without ever asking  themselves what is the evidence for them, what is the use of them, how  long they will last? They may pass away, like the authors of them, and  'leave not a wrack behind;' or they may survive in fragments. Nor is it  only in the Middle Ages, or in the literary desert of China or of India,  that such systems have arisen; in our own enlightened age, growing up  by the side of Physics, Ethics, and other really progressive sciences,  there is a weary waste of knowledge, falsely so-called. There are sham  sciences which no logic has ever put to the test, in which the desire  for knowledge invents the materials of it.    And therefore it is expedient once more to review the bases of  Psychology, lest we should be imposed upon by its pretensions. The  study of it may have done good service by awakening us to the sense of  inveterate errors familiarized by language, yet it may have fallen into  still greater ones; under the pretence of new investigations it may be  wasting the lives of those who are engaged in it. It may also be found  that the discussion of it will throw light upon some points in the  Theaetetus of Plato,--the oldest work on Psychology which has come down  to us. The imaginary science may be called, in the language of ancient  philosophy, 'a shadow of a part of Dialectic or Metaphysic' (Gorg.).    In this postscript or appendix we propose to treat, first, of the true  bases of Psychology; secondly, of the errors into which the students of  it are most likely to fall; thirdly, of the principal subjects which  are usually comprehended under it; fourthly, of the form which facts  relating to the mind most naturally assume.    We may preface the enquiry by two or three remarks:--    (1) We do not claim for the popular Psychology the position of a science  at all; it cannot, like the Physical Sciences, proceed by the Inductive  Method: it has not the necessity of Mathematics: it does not, like  Metaphysic, argue from abstract notions or from internal coherence. It  is made up of scattered observations. A few of these, though they may  sometimes appear to be truisms, are of the greatest value, and free  from all doubt. We are conscious of them in ourselves; we observe them  working in others; we are assured of them at all times. For example, we  are absolutely certain, (a) of the influence exerted by the mind over  the body or by the body over the mind: (b) of the power of association,  by which the appearance of some person or the occurrence of some event  recalls to mind, not always but often, other persons and events: (c)  of the effect of habit, which is strongest when least disturbed by  reflection, and is to the mind what the bones are to the body: (d) of  the real, though not unlimited, freedom of the human will: (e) of the  reference, more or less distinct, of our sensations, feelings, thoughts,  actions, to ourselves, which is called consciousness, or, when in  excess, self-consciousness: (f) of the distinction of the 'I' and 'Not  I,' of ourselves and outward objects. But when we attempt to gather up  these elements in a single system, we discover that the links by which  we combine them are apt to be mere words. We are in a country which  has never been cleared or surveyed; here and there only does a gleam of  light come through the darkness of the forest.    (2) These fragments, although they can never become science in the  ordinary sense of the word, are a real part of knowledge and may be of  great value in education. We may be able to add a good deal to them from  our own experience, and we may verify them by it. Self-examination  is one of those studies which a man can pursue alone, by attention to  himself and the processes of his individual mind. He may learn much  about his own character and about the character of others, if he will  'make his mind sit down' and look at itself in the glass. The great, if  not the only use of such a study is a practical one,--to know, first,  human nature, and, secondly, our own nature, as it truly is.    (3) Hence it is important that we should conceive of the mind in the  noblest and simplest manner. While acknowledging that language has been  the greatest factor in the formation of human thought, we must endeavour  to get rid of the disguises, oppositions, contradictions, which  arise out of it. We must disengage ourselves from the ideas which the  customary use of words has implanted in us. To avoid error as much as  possible when we are speaking of things unseen, the principal terms  which we use should be few, and we should not allow ourselves to be  enslaved by them. Instead of seeking to frame a technical language,  we should vary our forms of speech, lest "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1728"],[0,"The Odyssey of Homer (#17)"],[1,"ye  who assemble so often, and waste much livelihood, the  wealth of wise Telemachus! Long ago when ye were children,  ye marked not your fathers' telling, what manner of man was  Odysseus among them, one that wrought no iniquity toward  any man, nor spake aught unrighteous in the township, as is  the wont of divine kings. One man a king is like to hate,  another he might chance to love. But never did he do aught  at all presumptuously to any man. Nay, it is plain what  spirit ye are of, and your unseemly deeds are manifest to  all, nor is there any gratitude left for kindness done.'    Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her: 'Would, oh queen,  that this were the crowning evil! But the wooers devise  another far greater and more grievous, which I pray the son  of Cronos may never fulfil! They are set on slaying  Telemachus with the edge of the sword on his homeward way;  for he is gone to fair Pylos and goodly Lacedaemon, to seek  tidings of his father.'    So spake he, but her knees were loosened where she stood,  and her heart melted within her, and long time was she  speechless, and lo, her eyes were filled with tears and the  voice of her utterance was stayed. And at the last she  answered him and said:    'Henchman, wherefore I pray thee is my son departed? There  is no need that he should go abroad on swift ships, that  serve men for horses on the sea, and that cross the great  wet waste. Is it that even his own name may no more be left  upon earth?'    Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her: 'I know not  whether some god set him on or whether his own spirit  stirred him to go to Pylos to seek tidings of his father's  return, or to hear what end he met.'    He spake, and departed through the house of Odysseus, and  on her fell a cloud of consuming grief; so that she might  no more endure to seat her on a chair, whereof there were  many in the house, but there she crouched on the threshold  of her well-builded chamber, wailing piteously, and her  handmaids round her made low moan, as many as were in the  house with her, young and old. And Penelope spake among  them pouring forth her lamentation:    'Hear me, my friends, for the Olympian sire hath given me  pain exceedingly beyond all women who were born and bred in  my day. For erewhile I lost my noble lord of the lion  heart, adorned with all perfection among the Danaans, my  good lord, whose fame is noised abroad from Hellas to mid  Argos. And now again the storm-winds have snatched away my  well-beloved son without tidings from our halls, nor heard  I of his departure. Oh, women, hard of heart, that even ye  did not each one let the thought come into your minds, to  rouse me from my couch when he went to the black hollow  ship, though ye knew full well thereof! For had I heard  that he was purposing this journey, verily he should have  stayed here still, though eager to be gone, or have left me  dead in the halls. Howbeit let some one make haste to call  the ancient Dolius, my thrall, whom my father gave me ere  yet I had come hither, who keepeth my garden of trees. So  shall he go straightway and sit by Laertes, and tell him  all, if perchance Laertes may weave some counsel in his  heart, and go forth and make his plaint to the people, who  are purposed to destroy his seed, and the seed of god-like  Odysseus.'    Then the good nurse Eurycleia answered her: 'Dear lady,  aye, slay me if thou wilt with the pitiless sword or let me  yet live on in the house,--yet will I not hide my saying  from thee. I knew all this, and gave him whatsoever he  commanded, bread and sweet wine. And he took a great oath  of me not to tell thee till at least the twelfth day should  come, or thou thyself shouldst miss him and hear of his  departure, that thou mightest not mar thy fair flesh with  thy tears. But now, wash thee in water, and take to thee  clean raiment and ascend to thy upper chamber with the  women thy handmaids, and pray to Athene, daughter of Zeus,  lord of the aegis. For so may she save him even from death.  And heap not troubles on an old man's trouble; for the seed  of the son of Arceisius, is not, methinks, utterly hated by  the blessed gods, but someone will haply yet remain to  possess these lofty halls, and the fat fields far away.'    So spake she, and lulled her queen's lamentation, and made  her eyes to cease from weeping. So she washed her in water,  and took to her clean raiment, and ascended to the upper  chamber with the women her handmaids, and placed the meal  for sprinkling in a basket, and prayed unto Athene:    'Hear me, child of Zeus, lord of the aegis, unwearied  maiden! If ever wise Odysseus in his halls burnt for thee  fat slices of the thighs of heifer or of sheep, these  things, I pray thee, now remember, and save my dear son,  and ward from him the wooers in the naughtiness of their  pride.'    Therewith she raised a cry, and the goddess heard her  prayer. But the wooers clamoured through the shadowy halls,  and thus would some proud youth say:    'Verily this queen of many wooers prepareth our marriage,  nor knoweth at all how that for her son death hath been  ordained.'    Thus would certain of them speak, but they knew not how  these things were ordained. And Antinous made harangue and  spake among them:    'Good sirs, my friends, shun all disdainful words alike,  lest someone hear and tell it even in the house. But come  let us arise, and in silence accomplish that whereof we  spake, for the counsel pleased us every one.'    Therewith he chose twenty men that were the best, and they  departed to the swift ship and the sea-banks. So first of  all they drew the ship down to the deep water, and placed  the mast and sails in the black ship, and fixed the oars in  leathern loops all orderly, and spread forth the white  sails. And squires, haughty of heart, bare for them their  arms. And they moored her high out in the shore water, and  themselves disembarked. There they supped and waited for  evening to come on.    But the wise Penelope lay there in her upper chamber,  fasting and tasting neither meat nor drink, musing whether  her noble son should escape death, or even fall before the  proud wooers. And as a lion broods all in fear among the  press of men, when they draw the crafty ring around him, so  deeply was she musing when deep sleep came over her. And  she sank back in sleep and all her joints were loosened.    Now the goddess, grey-eyed Athene, turned to other  thoughts. She made a phantom, and fashioned it after the  likeness of a woman, Iphthime, daughter of great-hearted  Icarius, whom Eumelus wedded, whose dwelling was in Pherae.  And she sent it to the house of divine Odysseus to bid  Penelope, amid her sorrow and lamenting, to cease from her  weeping and tearful lamentation. So the phantom passed into  the chamber by the thong of the bolt, and stood above her  head and spake unto her, saying:    'Sleepest thou, Penelope, stricken at heart? Nay, even the  gods who live at ease suffer thee not to wail or be  afflicted, seeing that thy son is yet to return; for no  sinner is he in the eyes of the gods.'    Then wise Penelope made her answer as she slumbered very  softly at the gates of dreams:    'Wherefore, sister, hast thou come hither, that before wert  not wont to come, for thou hast thine habitation very far  away? Biddest thou me indeed to cease from the sorrows and  pains, so many that disquiet my heart and soul? Erewhile I  lost my noble lord of the lion heart, adorned with all  perfection among the Danaans, my true lord, whose fame is  noised abroad from Hellas to mid Argos. And now, again, my  well-beloved son is departed on his hollow ship, poor  child, not skilled in toils or in the gatherings of men.  For him I sorrow yet more than for my lord, and I tremble  and fear for him lest aught befal him, whether, it may be,  amid that folk where he is gone, or in the deep. For many  foemen devise evil against him, and go about to kill him,  or ever he come to his own country.'    And the dim phantom answered her, and said: 'Take courage,  and be not so sorely afraid. For lo, such a friend goes to  guide him, as all men pray to stand by them, for that she  hath the power, even Pallas Athene. And she pitieth thee in  thy sorrow, and now hath sent me forth to speak these words  to thee.'    And wise Penelope answered her, saying: 'If thou art indeed  a god, and hast heard the word of a god, come, I pray thee,  and tell me tidings concerning that ill-fated man, whether  perchance he is yet alive and sees the light of the sun, or  hath already died, and is a dweller in the house of Hades.'    And the dim phantom answered her and said: 'Concerning him  I will not tell thee all the tale, whether he be alive or  dead; it is ill to speak words light as wind.'    Therewith the phantom slipped away by the bolt of the door  and passed into the breath of the wind. And the daughter of  Icarius started up from sleep; and her heart was cheered,  so clear was the vision that sped toward her in the dead of  the night.    Meanwhile the wooers had taken ship and were sailing over  the wet ways, pondering in their hearts sheer death for  Telemachus. Now there is a rocky isle in the mid sea,  midway between Ithaca and rugged Samos, Asteris, a little  isle; and there is a harbour therein with a double  entrance, where ships may ride. There the Achaeans abode  lying in wait for Telemachus.        Book V      The Gods in council command Calypso by Hermes to send away    Odysseus on a raft of trees; and Poseidon, returning from    Ethiopia and seeing him on the coast of Phaeacia, scattered    his raft; and how by the help of Ino he was thrown ashore,    and slept on a heap of dry leaves till the next day.    Now the Dawn arose from her couch, from the side of the  lordly Tithonus, to bear light to the immortals and to  mortal men. And lo, the gods were gathering to session, and  among them Zeus, that thunders on high, whose might is"]]]
