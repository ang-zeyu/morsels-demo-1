Once  I ventured to designate the whole Christian system of _training_[22] in  penance and salvation (now best studied in England) as a method of  producing a _folie circulaire_ upon a soil already prepared for it,  which is to say, a soil thoroughly unhealthy. Not every one may be a  Christian: one is not \"converted\" to Christianity--one must first  be sick enough for it.... We others, who have the _courage_ for health  _and_ likewise for contempt,--we may well despise a religion that  teaches misunderstanding of the body! that refuses to rid itself of the  superstition about the soul! that makes a \"virtue\" of insufficient  nourishment! that combats health as a sort of enemy, devil, temptation!  that persuades itself that it is possible to carry about a \"perfect  soul\" in a cadaver of a body, and that, to this end, had to devise for  itself a new concept of \"perfection,\" a pale, sickly, idiotically  ecstatic state of existence, so-called \"holiness\"--a holiness that is  itself merely a series of symptoms of an impoverished, enervated and  incurably disordered body!... The Christian movement, as a European  movement, was from the start no more than a general uprising of all  sorts of outcast and refuse elements (--who now, under cover of  Christianity, aspire to power). It does _not_ represent the decay of a  race; it represents, on the contrary, a conglomeration of _decadence_  products from all directions, crowding together and seeking one another  out. It was _not_, as has been thought, the corruption of antiquity, of  _noble_ antiquity, which made Christianity possible; one cannot too  sharply challenge the learned imbecility which today maintains that  theory. At the time when the sick and rotten Chandala classes in the  whole _imperium_ were Christianized, the _contrary type_, the nobility,  reached its finest and ripest development. The majority became master;  democracy, with its Christian instincts, _triumphed_.... Christianity  was not \"national,\" it was not based on race--it appealed to all the  varieties of men disinherited by life, it had its allies everywhere.  Christianity has the rancour of the sick at its very core--the instinct  against the _healthy_, against _health_. Everything that is  well-constituted, proud, gallant and, above all, beautiful gives offence  to its ears and eyes. Again I remind you of Paul's priceless saying:  \"And God hath chosen the _weak_ things of the world, the _foolish_  things of the world, the _base_ things of the world, and things which  are _despised_\":[23] _this_ was the formula; _in hoc signo_ the  _decadence_ triumphed.--_God on the cross_--is man always to miss the  frightful inner significance of this symbol?--Everything that suffers,  everything that hangs on the cross, is _divine_.... We all hang on the  cross, consequently _we_ are divine.... We alone are divine....  Christianity was thus a victory: a nobler attitude of mind was destroyed  by it--Christianity remains to this day the greatest misfortune of  humanity.--    [22] The word _training_ is in English in the text.    [23] 1 Corinthians i, 27, 28.      52.    Christianity also stands in opposition to all _intellectual_  well-being,--sick reasoning is the only sort that it _can_ use as  Christian reasoning; it takes the side of everything that is idiotic; it  pronounces a curse upon \"intellect,\" upon the _superbia_ of the healthy  intellect. Since sickness is inherent in Christianity, it follows that  the typically Christian state of \"faith\" _must_ be a form of sickness  too, and that all straight, straightforward and scientific paths to  knowledge _must_ be banned by the church as _forbidden_ ways. Doubt is  thus a sin from the start.... The complete lack of psychological  cleanliness in the priest--revealed by a glance at him--is a phenomenon  _resulting_ from _decadence_,--one may observe in hysterical women and  in rachitic children how regularly the falsification of instincts,  delight in lying for the mere sake of lying, and incapacity for looking  straight and walking straight are symptoms of _decadence_. \"Faith\"  means the will to avoid knowing what is true. The pietist, the priest of  either sex, is a fraud _because_ he is sick: his instinct _demands_ that  the truth shall never be allowed its rights on any point. \"Whatever  makes for illness is _good_; whatever issues from abundance, from  superabundance, from power, is _evil_\": so argues the believer. The  _impulse to lie_--it is by this that I recognize every foreordained  theologian.--Another characteristic of the theologian is his _unfitness  for philology_. What I here mean by philology is, in a general sense,  the art of reading with profit--the capacity for absorbing facts  _without_ interpreting them falsely, and _without_ losing caution,  patience and subtlety in the effort to understand them. Philology as  _ephexis_[24] in interpretation: whether one be dealing with books, with  newspaper reports, with the most fateful events or with weather  statistics--not to mention the \"salvation of the soul.\"... The way in  which a theologian, whether in Berlin or in Rome, is ready to explain,  say, a \"passage of Scripture,\" or an experience, or a victory by the  national army, by turning upon it the high illumination of the Psalms of  David, is always so _daring_ that it is enough to make a philologian run  up a wall. But what shall he do when pietists and other such cows from  Suabia[25] use the \"finger of God\" to convert their miserably  commonplace and huggermugger existence into a miracle of \"grace,\" a  \"providence\" and an \"experience of salvation\"? The most modest exercise  of the intellect, not to say of decency, should certainly be enough to  convince these interpreters of the perfect childishness and unworthiness  of such a misuse of the divine digital dexterity. However small our  piety, if we ever encountered a god who always cured us of a cold in the  head at just the right time, or got us into our carriage at the very  instant heavy rain began to fall, he would seem so absurd a god that  he'd have to be abolished even if he existed. God as a domestic servant,  as a letter carrier, as an almanac-man--at bottom, he is a mere name for  the stupidest sort of chance.... \"Divine Providence,\" which every third  man in \"educated Germany\" still believes in, is so strong an argument  against God that it would be impossible to think of a stronger. And in  any case it is an argument against Germans!...    [24] That is, to say, scepticism. Among the Greeks scepticism was also  occasionally called ephecticism.    [25] A reference to the University of Tuebingen and its famous school of  Biblical criticism. The leader of this school was F. C. Baur, and one of  the men greatly influenced by it was Nietzsche's pet abomination, David  F. Strauss, himself a Suabian. _Vide_ Sec. 10 and Sec. 28.      53.    --It is so little true that _martyrs_ offer any support to the truth of  a cause that I am inclined to deny that any martyr has ever had anything  to do with the truth at all. In the very tone in which a martyr flings  what he fancies to be true at the head of the world there appears so low  a grade of intellectual honesty and such _insensibility_ to the problem  of \"truth,\" that it is never necessary to refute him. Truth is not  something that one man has and another man has not: at best, only  peasants, or peasant-apostles like Luther, can think of truth in any  such way. One may rest assured that the greater the degree of a man's  intellectual conscience the greater will be his modesty, his  _discretion_, on this point. To _know_ in five cases, and to refuse,  with delicacy, to know anything _further_.... \"Truth,\" as the word is  understood by every prophet, every sectarian, every free-thinker, every  Socialist and every churchman, is simply a complete proof that not even  a beginning has been made in the intellectual discipline and  self-control that are necessary to the unearthing of even the smallest  truth.--The deaths of the martyrs, it may be said in passing, have been  misfortunes of history: they have _misled_.... The conclusion that all  idiots, women and plebeians come to, that there must be something in a  cause for which any one goes to his death (or which, as under primitive  Christianity, sets off epidemics of death-seeking)--this conclusion has  been an unspeakable drag upon the testing of facts, upon the whole  spirit of inquiry and investigation. The martyrs have _damaged_ the  truth.... Even to this day the crude fact of persecution is enough to  give an honourable name to the most empty sort of sectarianism.--But  why? Is the worth of a cause altered by the fact that some one had laid  down his life for it?--An error that becomes honourable is simply an  error that has acquired one seductive charm the more: do you suppose,  Messrs. Theologians, that we shall give you the chance to be martyred  for your lies?--One best disposes of a cause by respectfully putting it  on ice--that is also the best way to dispose of theologians.... This was  precisely the world-historical stupidity of all the persecutors: that  they gave the appearance of honour to the cause they opposed--that they  made it a present of the fascination of martyrdom.... Women are still on  their knees before an error because they have been told that some one  died on the cross for it. _Is the cross, then, an argument?_--But about  all these things there is one, and one only, who has said what has been  needed for thousands of years--_Zarathustra_.

He dressed himself \"all in his best,\" and at last got out into the  streets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them  with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and, walking with his hands behind  him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile. He looked so  irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured  fellows said, \"Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!\" And Scrooge  said often afterwards that, of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard,  those were the blithest in his ears.    He had not gone far when, coming on towards him, he beheld the portly  gentleman who had walked into his counting-house the day before, and  said, \"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe?\" It sent a pang across his heart  to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but  he knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.    \"My dear sir,\" said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the old  gentleman by both his hands, \"how do you do? I hope you succeeded  yesterday. It was very kind of you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!\"    \"Mr. Scrooge?\"    \"Yes,\" said Scrooge. \"That is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant  to you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have the goodness----\"  Here Scrooge whispered in his ear.    \"Lord bless me!\" cried the gentleman, as if his breath were taken away.  \"My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?\"    \"If you please,\" said Scrooge. \"Not a farthing less. A great many  back-payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that  favour?\"    \"My dear sir,\" said the other, shaking hands with him, \"I don't know  what to say to such munifi----\"    \"Don't say anything, please,\" retorted Scrooge. \"Come and see me. Will  you come and see me?\"    \"I will!\" cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he meant to do it.    \"Thankee,\" said Scrooge. \"I am much obliged to you. I thank you fifty  times. Bless you!\"    He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people  hurrying to and fro, and patted the children on the head, and questioned  beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the  windows; and found that everything could yield him pleasure. He had  never dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so much  happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew's  house.    He passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and  knock. But he made a dash, and did it.    \"Is your master at home, my dear?\" said Scrooge to the girl. Nice girl!  Very.    \"Yes sir.\"    \"Where is he, my love?\" said Scrooge.    \"He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I'll show you  up-stairs, if you please.\"    \"Thankee. He knows me,\" said Scrooge, with his hand already on the  dining-room lock. \"I'll go in here, my dear.\"    He turned it gently, and sidled his face in round the door. They were  looking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these  young housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see  that everything is right.    \"Fred!\" said Scrooge.    Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had  forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the  footstool, or he wouldn't have done it on any account.    \"Why, bless my soul!\" cried Fred, \"who's that?\"    \"It's I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let me in,  Fred?\"    Let him in! It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off. He was at home in  five minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece looked just the same.  So did Topper when _he_ came. So did the plump sister when _she_ came.  So did every one when _they_ came. Wonderful party, wonderful games,  wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!    But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there! If  he could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That  was the thing he had set his heart upon.    And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter  past. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time.  Scrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the  tank.    His hat was off before he opened the door; his comforter too. He was on  his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to  overtake nine o'clock.    \"Hallo!\" growled Scrooge in his accustomed voice as near as he could  feign it. \"What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?\"    \"I am very sorry, sir,\" said Bob. \"I _am_ behind my time.\"    \"You are!\" repeated Scrooge. \"Yes. I think you are. Step this way, sir,  if you please.\"    \"It's only once a year, sir,\" pleaded Bob, appearing from the tank. \"It  shall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.\"    \"Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,\" said Scrooge. \"I am not going to  stand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore,\" he continued,  leaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that  he staggered back into the tank again: \"and therefore I am about to  raise your salary!\"    Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary  idea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the  people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.    \"A merry Christmas, Bob!\" said Scrooge with an earnestness that could  not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. \"A merrier Christmas,  Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year! I'll raise  your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will  discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of  smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires and buy another coal-scuttle  before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!\"            *     *     *     *     *    Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more;  and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father. He became as  good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man as the good old City  knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough in the good old  world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them  laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that  nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did  not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and, knowing that such as  these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they  should wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in less  attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for  him.    He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the  Total-Abstinence Principle ever afterwards; and it was always said of  him that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed  the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as  Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!"]]]
