Is it conceivable that He Who expecteth to lose His life at  any moment should seek after worldly vanities? How very strange the  imaginings of those who speak as prompted by their own caprices, and who  wander distractedly in the wilderness of self and passion! Erelong shall  they be called upon to account for their words, and on that day they shall  find none to befriend or help them.    197 And amongst the people are those who claim that He hath disbelieved in  God--yet every member of My body testifieth that there is none other God  but Him; that those Whom He hath raised up in truth and sent forth with  His guidance are the Manifestations of His most excellent names, the  Revealers of His most exalted attributes, and the Repositories of His  Revelation in the kingdom of creation; that through them the Proof of God  hath been perfected unto all else but Him, the standard of Divine Unity  hath been raised, and the sign of sanctity hath been made manifest; and  that through them every soul hath found a path unto the Lord of the Throne  on high. We testify that there is none other God but Him, that from  everlasting He was alone with none else besides Him, and that He shall be  unto everlasting what He hath ever been. Too high is the All-Merciful for  the hearts of those who have recognized Him to apprehend His true nature,  or for the minds of men to hope to fathom His essence. He verily is  exalted above the understanding of anyone besides Himself, and sanctified  beyond the comprehension of all else save Him. From all eternity He hath  been independent of the entire creation.    198 Remember the days in which the Sun of Batha(24) shone forth above the  horizon of the Will of thy Lord, the Exalted, the Most High, and recall  how the divines of that age turned away from Him, and the learned  contended with Him, that haply thou mayest apprehend that which, in this  day, remaineth concealed behind the veils of glory. So grievous became His  plight on every side that He instructed His companions to disperse. Thus  was the decree made manifest from the heaven of divine glory. Remember,  furthermore, how, when one of these same companions came before the King  of Ethiopia and recited unto him a Surih of the Qur'an, he declared to his  attendants: \"This, truly, hath been revealed by One Who is All-Knowing and  All-Wise. Whoso acknowledgeth the truth, and believeth in the teachings of  Jesus, can in no wise deny what hath been recited. We, verily, bear  witness to its truth, even as we bear witness to the truth of that which  we possess of the Books of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.\"    199 I swear by God, O King! Wert thou to incline thine ear to the melodies  of that Nightingale which warbleth in manifold accents upon the mystic  bough as bidden by thy Lord, the All-Merciful, thou wouldst cast away thy  sovereignty and set thy face towards this Scene of transcendent glory,  above whose horizon shineth the Book of the Dawntide,(25) and wouldst  expend all that thou possessest in thine eagerness to obtain the things of  God. Then wouldst thou find thyself raised up to the summit of exaltation  and glory, and elevated to the pinnacle of majesty and independence. Thus  hath the decree been recorded in the Mother Book by the Pen of the  All-Merciful. Of what avail are the things which are yours today and which  tomorrow others shall possess? Choose for thyself that which God hath  chosen for His elect, and God shall grant thee a mighty sovereignty in His  Kingdom. We beseech God to aid thy Majesty to hearken unto that Word whose  radiance hath enveloped the whole world, and to protect thee from such as  have strayed far from the court of His presence.    200 Glory be to Thee, O Lord My God! How many the heads which were raised  aloft on spears in Thy path, and how many the breasts which were made the  target of arrows for the sake of Thy good pleasure! How many the hearts  that have been lacerated for the exaltation of Thy Word and the promotion  of Thy Cause, and how many the eyes that have wept sore for love of Thee!  I implore Thee, O Thou Who art the King of kings and the Pitier of the  downtrodden, by Thy Most Great Name which Thou hast made the Dawning-Place  of Thy most excellent names and the Dayspring of Thy most exalted  attributes, to remove the veils that have come in between Thee and Thy  creatures and debarred them from turning unto the horizon of Thy  Revelation. Cause them, then, O My God, by Thy most exalted Word, to turn  from the left hand of oblivion and delusion unto the right hand of  knowledge and certitude, that they may know what Thou hast purposed for  them through Thy bounty and grace, and may set their faces towards Him Who  is the Manifestation of Thy Cause and the Revealer of Thy signs.    201 O My God! Thou art the All-Bountiful, Whose grace is infinite.  Withhold not Thy servants from the most mighty Ocean, which Thou hast made  the repository of the pearls of Thy knowledge and Thy wisdom, and turn  them not away from Thy gate, which Thou hast opened wide before all who  are in Thy heaven and all who are on Thy earth. O Lord! Leave them not to  themselves, for they understand not and flee from that which is better for  them than all that Thou hast created upon Thine earth. Cast upon them, O  My God, the glances of the eye of Thy favour and bounty, and deliver them  from self and passion, that they may draw nigh unto Thy most exalted  Horizon, taste the sweetness of Thy remembrance, and delight in that bread  which Thou hast sent down from the heaven of Thy Will and the firmament of  Thy grace. From everlasting Thy bounty hath embraced the entire creation  and Thy mercy hath surpassed all things. No God is there but Thee, the  Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.    202 Glorified art Thou, O Lord My God! Thou well knowest that Mine heart  hath melted in Thy Cause, and that My blood so boileth in My veins with  the fire of Thy love that every drop of it proclaimeth with its inner  tongue: \"Grant that I may be spilt upon the ground for Thy sake, O my  Lord, the Most High, that from it there may spring forth that which Thou  hast purposed in Thy Tablets and hast hidden from the eyes of all, except  such servants as have tasted of the crystal stream of knowledge from the  hands of Thy grace and quaffed the soft-flowing waters of understanding  from the cup of Thy bestowal.\"    203 Thou knowest, O My God, that in all Mine affairs I have sought only to  obey Thy bidding, that in Mine every utterance I have wished only to extol  Thy praise, and that in whatsoever hath proceeded from My Pen I have  purposed only to win Thy good pleasure and to reveal that which Thou hast  enjoined upon Me through Thy sovereignty.    204 Thou beholdest Me, O My God, as one bewildered in Thy land. Whensoever  I make mention of that which Thou hast enjoined upon Me, Thy creatures  cavil at Me; yet were I to neglect that which Thou hast bidden Me observe,  I would deserve the scourge of Thine anger and would be far removed from  the meadows of Thy nearness. Nay, by Thy glory! I have set My face towards  Thy good pleasure, and turned away from the things whereon Thy servants  have set their affections. I have embraced all that is with Thee, and  forsaken all that might lead Me away from the retreats of Thy nearness and  the heights of Thy glory. I swear by Thy might! With Thy love in My heart  nothing can ever alarm Me, and in the path of Thy good pleasure all the  world's afflictions can in no wise dismay Me. All this, however,  proceedeth from Thy power and Thy might, from Thy bounty and Thy grace,  and is not of Mine own deserving.    205 This is an Epistle, O My God, which I have purposed to send unto the  King. Thou knowest that I have wished of him naught but that he should  show forth justice to Thy servants and extend his favours unto the people  of Thy kingdom. For Myself I have desired only what Thou didst desire, and  through Thy succour I wish for naught save that which Thou wishest. Perish  the soul that seeketh from Thee aught save Thyself! I swear by Thy glory!  Thy good pleasure is my dearest wish, and Thy purpose My highest hope.  Have mercy, O My God, upon this poor creature Who hath clung unto the hem  of Thy riches, and this suppliant soul Who calleth upon Thee, saying,  \"Thou art, verily, the Lord of might and glory!\" Assist Thou, O My God,  His Majesty the Shah to keep Thy statutes amidst Thy servants and to  manifest Thy justice amongst Thy creatures, that he may treat this people  as he treateth others. Thou art, in truth, the God of power, of glory and  wisdom.    206 By the leave and permission of the King of the Age, this Servant  journeyed from the Seat of Sovereignty(26) to 'Iraq, and dwelt for twelve  years in that land. Throughout the entire course of this period no account  of Our condition was submitted to the court of thy presence, and no  representation ever made to foreign powers. Placing Our whole trust in  God, We resided in that land until there came to 'Iraq a certain  official(27) who, upon his arrival, undertook to harass this poor company  of exiles. Day after day, at the instigation of some of the outwardly  learned and of other individuals, he would stir up trouble for these  servants, although they had at no time committed any act detrimental to  the state and its people or contrary to the rules and customs of the  citizens of the realm.    207 Fearing lest the actions of these transgressors should produce some  outcome at variance with thy world-adorning judgement, this Servant  despatched a brief account of the matter to Mirza Sa'id Khan(28) at the  Foreign Ministry, so that he might submit it to the royal presence and  that whatever thou shouldst please to decree in this respect might be  obeyed. A long while elapsed, and no decree was issued. Finally matters  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17310"],[0,"Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas (#17)"],[1,"vexed and fearful. Earthquakes have broken loose, and the tribes have  lamented, for fear of God, the Lord of Strength, the All-Compelling.' Say:  'The stunning trumpet-blast hath been loudly raised, and the Day is God's,  the One, the Unconstrained.' And they say: 'Hath the Catastrophe come to  pass?' Say: 'Yea, by the Lord of Lords!' 'Is the Resurrection come?' 'Nay,  more; He Who is the Self-Subsisting hath appeared with the Kingdom of His  signs.' 'Seest thou men laid low?' 'Yea, by my Lord, the Most High, the  Most Glorious!' 'Have the tree-stumps been uprooted?' 'Yea, more; the  mountains have been scattered in dust; by Him the Lord of attributes!'  They say: 'Where is Paradise, and where is Hell?' Say: 'The one is reunion  with Me; the other thine own self, O thou who dost associate a partner  with God and doubtest.' They say: 'We see not the Balance.' Say: 'Surely,  by my Lord, the God of Mercy! None can see it except such as are endued  with insight.' They say: 'Have the stars fallen?' Say: 'Yea, when He Who  is the Self-Subsisting dwelt in the Land of Mystery.(42) Take heed, ye who  are endued with discernment!' All the signs appeared when We drew forth  the Hand of Power from the bosom of majesty and might. Verily, the Crier  hath cried out, when the promised time came, and they that have recognized  the splendours of Sinai have swooned away in the wilderness of hesitation,  before the awful majesty of thy Lord, the Lord of creation. The trumpet  asketh: 'Hath the Bugle been sounded?' Say: 'Yea, by the King of  Revelation! when He mounted the throne of His Name, the All-Merciful.'  Darkness hath been chased away by the dawning light of the mercy of thy  Lord, the Source of all light. The breeze of the All-Merciful hath wafted,  and the souls have been quickened in the tombs of their bodies. Thus hath  the decree been fulfilled by God, the Mighty, the Beneficent. They who  reject the truth have said: 'When were the heavens cleft asunder?' Say:  'While ye lay in the graves of waywardness and error.' Among the faithless  is he who rubbeth his eyes, and looketh to the right and to the left. Say:  'Blinded art thou. No refuge hast thou to flee to.' And among them is he  who saith: 'Have men been gathered together?' Say: 'Yea, by My Lord!  whilst thou didst lie in the cradle of idle fancies.' And among them is he  who saith: 'Hath the Book been sent down through the power of the true  Faith?' Say: 'The true Faith itself is astounded. Fear ye, O ye men of  understanding heart!' And among them is he who saith: 'Have I been  assembled with others, blind?' Say: 'Yea, by Him that rideth upon the  clouds!' Paradise is decked with mystic roses, and hell hath been made to  blaze with the fire of the impious. Say: 'The light hath shone forth from  the horizon of Revelation, and the whole earth hath been illumined at the  coming of Him Who is the Lord of the Day of the Covenant!' The doubters  have perished, whilst he that turned, guided by the light of assurance,  unto the Dayspring of Certitude hath prospered. Blessed art thou, who hast  fixed thy gaze upon Me, for this Tablet which hath been sent down for  thee--a Tablet which causeth the souls of men to soar. Commit it to memory,  and recite it. By My life! It is a door to the mercy of thy Lord. Well is  it with him that reciteth it at eventide and at dawn. We, verily, heard  thy praise of this Cause, through which the mountain of knowledge was  crushed, and men's feet have slipped. My glory be upon thee and upon  whomsoever hath turned unto the Almighty, the All-Bounteous. The Tablet is  ended, but the theme is unexhausted. Be patient, for thy Lord is patient.    These are verses We sent down previously, and We have sent them unto thee,  that thou mayest be acquainted with what their lying tongues have spoken,  when God came unto them with might and sovereignty. The foundations of  idle fancies have trembled, and the heaven of vain imaginings hath been  cleft asunder, and yet the people are in doubt and in contention with Him.  They have denied the testimony of God and His proof, after He came from  the heaven of power with the kingdom of His signs. They have cast away  what had been prescribed, and perpetrated what had been forbidden them in  the Book. They have abandoned their God, and clung unto their desires.  They truly have strayed and are in error. They read the verses and deny  them. They behold the clear tokens and turn aside. They truly are lost in  strange doubt.    We have admonished Our loved ones to fear God, a fear which is the  fountainhead of all goodly deeds and virtues. It is the commander of the  hosts of justice in the city of Baha. Happy the man that hath entered the  shadow of its luminous standard, and laid fast hold thereon. He, verily,  is of the Companions of the Crimson Ark, which hath been mentioned in the  Qayyum-i-Asma.    Say: O people of God! Adorn your temples with the adornment of  trustworthiness and piety. Help, then, your Lord with the hosts of goodly  deeds and a praiseworthy character. We have forbidden you dissension and  conflict in My Books, and My Scriptures, and My Scrolls, and My Tablets,  and have wished thereby naught else save your exaltation and advancement.  Unto this testify the heavens and the stars thereof, and the sun and the  radiance thereof, and the trees and the leaves thereof, and the seas and  the waves thereof, and the earth and the treasures thereof. We pray God to  assist His loved ones, and aid them in that which beseemeth them in this  blest, this mighty, and wondrous station. Moreover We beseech Him to  graciously enable those who surround Me to observe that which My Pen of  Glory hath enjoined upon them.    O Jalil! Upon thee be My glory and My loving providence. Verily We have  enjoined the people to do what is meet and seemly and yet they have  committed such things as have caused My heart and My Pen to lament.  Incline thine ear to that which is sent down from the heaven of My Will  and the realm of My good-pleasure. I sorrow not for My captivity, nor for  the things that have befallen Me at the hand of Mine enemies. Nay, My  sorrows are occasioned by those who claim to be related to Me and yet  commit that which causeth the voice of My lamentations to be lifted up and  My tears to flow. We have exhorted them at length in various Tablets and  beseech God to graciously assist them, to enable them to draw nigh unto  Him and to confirm them in that which would bring peace to the hearts and  tranquillity to the souls and would stay their hands from whatsoever  ill-beseemeth His days.    Say, O My loved ones in My lands! Give ye ear unto the counsels of Him Who  admonisheth you for the sake of God. He hath in truth created you, hath  revealed before your eyes that which exalteth you and promoteth your  interests. He hath made known unto you His straight Path and hath  acquainted you with His Great Announcement.    O Jalil! Admonish men to fear God. By God! This fear is the chief  commander of the army of thy Lord. Its hosts are a praiseworthy character  and goodly deeds. Through it have the cities of men's hearts been opened  throughout the ages and centuries, and the standards of ascendancy and  triumph raised above all other standards.    We will now mention unto thee Trustworthiness and the station thereof in  the estimation of God, thy Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. One day of  days We repaired unto Our Green Island. Upon Our arrival, We beheld its  streams flowing, and its trees luxuriant, and the sunlight playing in  their midst. Turning Our face to the right, We beheld what the pen is  powerless to describe; nor can it set forth that which the eye of the Lord  of Mankind witnessed in that most sanctified, that most sublime, that  blest, and most exalted Spot. Turning, then, to the left We gazed on one  of the Beauties of the Most Sublime Paradise, standing on a pillar of  light, and calling aloud saying: 'O inmates of earth and heaven! Behold ye  My beauty, and My radiance, and My revelation, and My effulgence. By God,  the True One! I am Trustworthiness and the revelation thereof, and the  beauty thereof. I will recompense whosoever will cleave unto Me, and  recognize My rank and station, and hold fast unto My hem. I am the most  great ornament of the people of Baha, and the vesture of glory unto all  who are in the kingdom of creation. I am the supreme instrument for the  prosperity of the world, and the horizon of assurance unto all beings.'  Thus have We sent down for thee that which will draw men nigh unto the  Lord of creation.    The Pen of the Most High turneth from the eloquent language(43) to the  luminous one(44) that thou, O Jalil, mayest appreciate the tender mercy of  thy Lord, the Incomparable One and mayest be of them that are truly  grateful.    O thou who hast fixed thy gaze upon the all-glorious Horizon! The Call is  raised but hearing ears are numbered, nay non-existent. This Wronged One  findeth himself in the maw of the serpent, yet He faileth not to make  mention of the loved ones of God. So grievous have been Our sufferings in  these days that the Concourse on High are moved to tears and to  lamentation. Neither the adversities of the world nor the harm inflicted  by its nations could deter Him Who is the King of Eternity from voicing  His summons or frustrate His purpose. When those who had for years been  hiding behind the veils perceived that the horizon of the Cause was  resplendent and that the Word of God was all-pervasive, they rushed forth  and with swords of malice inflicted such harm as no pen can portray nor  any tongue describe.    They that judge with fairness testify that since the early days of the  Cause this Wronged One hath arisen, unveiled and resplendent, before the  faces of kings and commoners, before the rulers and the divines, and hath,  in ringing tones, summoned all men unto the straight Path. He hath had no  helper save His Pen, "]]]
