The  British commander, Colonel Broadwood, had seventeen hundred men in his  column, and General De Wet was at the head of about two hundred and fifty  less than that number, but the strength of the forces was equalised by the  Boer general's intimate knowledge of the country. Colonel Broadwood was  experienced in Indian, Egyptian, and South African warfare, and the  majority of his soldiers were seasoned in many battles. De Wet and his men  were fresh from Poplar Grove, Abraham's Kraal, and the fighting around  Kimberley, but they were not better nor worse than the average of the Boer  burghers. The British commander was hampered by a large transport train,  but he possessed the advantage of more heavy guns than his adversary. All  in all, the two forces were equally matched when they reached the  battlefield.    The day before the battle General De Wet and his men were in laager  several miles east of Brandfort, whither they had fled after the fall of  Bloemfontein. His scouts brought to him the information that a small  British column was stationed in the village of Thaba N'Chu, forty miles to  the east, and he determined to march thither and attack it. He gave the  order, \"Opzaal!\" and in less than eight minutes every one of his burghers  was on his horse, armed, provided with two days' rations of biltong,  biscuit, coffee, and sugar, and ready to proceed. De Wet himself leaped  into a light, ramshackle four-wheeler, and led the advance over the dusty  veld. Without attempting to proceed with any semblance of military order,  the burghers followed in the course of their leader, some riding rapidly,  others walking beside their horses, and a few skirmishing far away on the  veld for buck. The mule-teams dragging the artillery and the ammunition  waggons were not permitted by their hullabalooing Basuto drivers to lag  far behind the general, and the dust which was raised by this long  cavalcade was not unlike the clouds of locusts which were frequently  mistaken for the signs of a trekking commando. Mile after mile was rapidly  traversed, until darkness came on, when a halt was made so that the  burghers might prepare a meal, and that the general might hear from the  scouts, who were far in advance of the body. After the men and horses had  eaten, and the moon rose over the dark peak of Thaba N'Chu mountain, the  burghers lighted their pipes and sang psalms and hymns until the peaceful  valley resounded with their voices.    [Illustration: VILLAGE AND MOUNTAIN OF THABA N'CHU]    Panting horses brought to the little stone farmhouse, where General De Wet  was drinking milk, the long-awaited scouts who carried the information  that the British force had evacuated Thaba N'Chu late in the afternoon,  and that it was moving hurriedly toward Bloemfontein. Again the order:  \"Opzaal,\" and the mule train came into motion and the burghers mounted  their horses. A chill night air arose, and shivering burghers wrapped  blankets around their shoulders. The humming of hymns and the whistling  ceased, and there was nothing but the clatter of horses' hoofs, the shouts  of the Basutos, and the noises of the guns and waggons rumbling over the  stones and gullies to mark the nocturnal passage of the army. Lights  appeared at farmhouse windows, and at their gates were women and children  with bread and bowls of milk and prayers for the burghers. Small walls  enclosing family burial plots where newly-dug ground told its own story of  the war seemed grim in the moonlight; native huts with their inhabitants  standing like spectres before the doors appeared like monstrous  ant-heaps--all these were passed, but the drooping eyes of the burghers  saw nothing. At midnight another halt was made, horses were off-saddled  and men lay down on the veld to sleep. The generals and officers met in  Krijgsraad, and other scouts arriving told of the enemy's evident  intention of spending the remainder of the night at an old-time  off-saddling station known as Sannaspost. The news was highly important,  and the heads of the generals came closer together. Maps were produced,  pencil marks were made, plans were formed, and then the sleeping burghers  were aroused. The trek was resumed, and shortly afterward the column was  divided into two parts; the one consisting of nine hundred men under  General Peter De Wet, proceeding by a circuitous route to the hills south  of Sannaspost, and the other of five hundred men commanded by General  Christian De Wet moving through a maze of kopjes to a position west of the  trekking station.    The burghers were not informed of the imminence of a battle; but they  required no such announcement from their generals. The atmosphere seemed  to be surcharged with premonitions of an engagement, and men rubbed sleep  out of their eyes and sat erect upon their horses. The blacks even ceased  to crack their whips so sharply, and urged the mules forward in whispers  instead of shrieks. Burghers took their rifles from their backs, tested  the workings of the mechanism and filled the magazine with cartridges.  Artillerymen leaped from their horses and led them while they sat on the  cannon and poured oil into the bearings. Young men speculated on the  number of prisoners they would take; old men wrote their names on their  hats by the light of the moon. The lights of Bloemfontein appeared in the  distance, and grey-beards looked longingly at them and sighed. But the  cavalcade passed on, grimly, silently, and defiantly, into the haunts of  the enemy.    After four hours of trekking over veld, kopje, sluit, and donga, the two  columns halted, the burghers dismounted, and, weary from the long journey  and the lack of sleep, lay down on the earth beside their horses.  Commandants, field-cornets and corporals, bustling about among the  burghers, horses and waggons, gave orders in undertones; generals summoned  their scouts and asked for detailed information concerning the whereabouts  of the enemy; patrols were scurrying hither and thither to secure accurate  ideas of the topography of the territory in front of them; all who were in  authority were busy, while the burghers, who carried the strength of  battle in their bodies, lay sleeping and resting.    The first dim rays of the day came over the tops of the eastern hills when  the burghers were aroused and asked to proceed to the positions chosen by  their leaders. The men under Peter De Wet, the younger brother of the  Commandant-General, were led to an elevation about a mile and a half south  of Sannaspost, where they placed their cannon into position and waited for  the break of day.    Christian De Wet and his five hundred burghers advanced noiselessly and  occupied the dry bed of Koorn Spruit, a stream which crossed the main road  running from Thaba N'Chu to Bloemfontein at right angles about a mile from  the station where the British forces had begun their bivouac for the  night, two hours before. No signs of the enemy could be seen; there were  no pickets, no outposts, and none of the usual safeguards of an army, and  for some time the Boers were led to believe that the British force had  been allowed to escape unharmed.    The burghers under the leadership of Christian De Wet were completely  concealed in the spruit. The high banks might have been held by the forces  of their enemy, but unless they crept to the edge and looked down into the  stream they would not have been able to discover the presence of the  Boers. Where the road crossed the stream deep approaches had been dug into  the banks in order to facilitate the passage of conveyances--a \"drift\" it  is called in South Africa--and on either side for a distance of a mile, up  and down the stream, the burghers stood by their horses and waited for the  coming of the day. The concealment was perfect; no specially constructed  trenches could have served the purposes of the Boers more advantageously.    Dawn lighted the flat-topped kopjes that lay in a huge semicircle in the  distance, and men clambered up the sides of the spruit to ascertain the  camp of the enemy. The white smoke-stack of the Bloemfontein waterworks  appeared against the black background of the hills in the east, but it was  still too dark to distinguish objects on the ground beneath it. A group of  burghers in the spruit, absent-mindedly, began to sing a deep-toned psalm,  but the stern order of a commandant quickly ended their matutinal song. A  donkey in an ammunition waggon brayed vociferously, and a dozen men,  fearful lest the enemy should hear the noise, sprang upon him with clubs  and whips, and even attempted to close his mouth by force of hands. It was  the fateful moment before the battle, and men acted strangely. Some walked  nervously up and down, others dropped on their knees and prayed, a few  lighted their pipes, many sat on the ground and looked vacantly into  space, while some of the younger burghers joked and laughed.    At the drift stood the generals, scanning the hills and undulations with  their glasses. Small fires appeared in the east near the tall white stack.  \"They are preparing their breakfast,\" some one suggested. \"I see a few  tents,\" another one reported excitedly. All eyes were turned in the  direction indicated. Some estimated the intervening distance at a mile,  others were positive it was not more than a thousand yards--it was not  light enough to distinguish accurately. \"Tell the burghers that I will  fire the first shot,\" said General De Wet to one of his staff. Immediately  the order was spread to the men in the spruit. \"I see men leading oxen to  the waggons; they are preparing to trek,\" remarked a commandant. \"They are  coming down this way,\" announced another, slapping his thigh joyfully.    A few minutes afterwards clouds of dust arose, and at intervals the  waggons in the van could be seen coming down the slope toward "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16467"],[0,"Musicians of To-Day (#17)"],[1,"beauty of the movements of pure poetry,  emotion, and music is so evident, that this musical and philosophical  drama serves to give one a distaste for philosophy and drama and  everything else that cramps and confines music.    But the musical part of _Tristan_ is not free either from the faults of  the work as a whole, for it, too, lacks unity. Wagner's music is made up  of very diverse styles: one finds in it Italianisms and Germanisms and  even Gallicisms of every kind; there are some that are sublime, some  that are commonplace; and at times one feels the awkwardness of their  union and the imperfections of their form. Then again, perhaps two ideas  of equal originality come together and spoil each other by making too  strong a contrast. The fine lamentation of King Mark--that  personification of a knight of the Grail--is treated with such  moderation and with so noble a scorn for outward show, that its pure,  cold light is entirely lost after the glowing fire of the duet.    The work suffers everywhere from a lack of balance. It is an almost  inevitable defect, arising from its very grandeur. A mediocre work may  quite easily be perfect of its kind; but it is rarely that a work lofty  aim attains perfection. A landscape of little dells and smiling meadows  is brought more readily into pleasing harmony than a landscape of  dazzling Alps, torrents, glaciers, and tempests; for the heights may  sometimes overwhelm the picture and spoil the effect. And so it is with  certain great pages of _Tristan_. We may take for example the verses  which tell of excruciating expectation--in the second act, Isolde's  expectation on the night filled with desire; and, in the third act,  Tristan's expectation, as he lies wounded and delirious, waiting for the  vessel that brings Isolde and death--or we may take the Prelude, that  expression of eternal desire that is like a restless sea for ever  moaning and beating itself upon the shore.           *       *       *       *       *    The quality that touches me most deeply in _Tristan_ is the evidence of  honesty and sincerity in a man who was treated by his enemies as a  charlatan that used superficial and grossly material means to arrest and  amaze the public eye. What drama is more sober or more disdainful of  exterior effect than _Tristan_? Its restraint is almost carried to  excess. Wagner rejected any picturesque episode in it that was  irrelevant to his subject. The man who carried all Nature in his  imagination, who at his will made the storms of the _Walkuere_ rage, or  the soft light of Good Friday shine, would not even depict a bit of the  sea round the vessel in the first act. Believe me, that must have been a  sacrifice, though he wished it so. It pleased him to enclose this  terrible drama within the four walls of a chamber of tragedy. There are  hardly any choruses; there is nothing to distract one's attention from  the mystery of human souls; there are only two real parts--those of the  lovers; and if there is a third, it belongs to Destiny, into whose hands  the victims are delivered. What a fine seriousness there is in this love  play. Its passion remains sombre and stern; there is no laughter in it,  only a belief which is almost religious, more religious perhaps in its  sincerity than that of _Parsifal_.    It is a lesson for dramatists to see a man suppressing all frivolous  trifling and empty episodes in order to concentrate his subject entirely  on the inner life of two living souls. In that Wagner is our master, a  better, stronger, and more profitable master to follow, in spite of his  mistakes, than all the other literary and dramatic authors of his time.           *       *       *       *       *    I see that criticism has filled a larger place in these notes than I  meant it to do. But in spite of that, I love _Tristan_; for me and for  others of my time it has long been an intoxicating draught. And it has  never lost anything of its grandeur; the years have left its beauty  untouched, and it is for me the highest point of art reached by anyone  since Beethoven's death.    But as I was listening to it the other evening I could not help  thinking: Ah, Wagner, you will one day go too, and join Gluck and Bach  and Monteverde and Palestrina and all the great souls whose names still  live among men, but whose thoughts are only felt by a handful of the  initiated, who try in vain to revive the past. You, also, are already of  the past, though you were the steady light of our youth, the strong  source of life and death, of desire and renouncement, whence we drew our  moral force and our power of resistance against the world. And the  world, ever greedy for new sensations, goes on its way amid the  unceasing ebb and flow of its desires. Already its thoughts have  changed, and new musicians are making new songs for the future. But it  is the voice of a century of tempest that passes with you.          CAMILLE SAINT-SAENS      M. Saint-Saens has had the rare honour of becoming a classic during his  lifetime. His name, though it was long unrecognised, now commands  universal respect, not less by his worth of character than by the  perfection of his art. No artist has troubled so little about the  public, or been more indifferent to criticism whether popular or expert.  As a child he had a sort of physical repulsion for outward success:                             \"De l'applaudissement      J'entends encor le bruit qui, chose assez etrange,      Pour ma pudeur d'enfant etait comme une fange      Dont le flot me venait toucher; je redoutais      Son contact, et parfois, malin, je l'evitais,      Affectant la raideur.\"[110]    [Footnote 110:                                 Of applause      I still hear the noise; and, strangely enough,      In my childish shyness it seemed like mire      About to spot me; I feared      Its touch, and secretly shunned it,      Affecting obstinacy.    These verses were read by M. Saint-Saens at a concert given on 10 June,  1896, in the Salle Pleyel, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of his  _debut_, which he made in 1846. It was in this same Salle Pleyel that he  gave his first concert.]    Later on, he achieved success by a long and painful struggle, in which  he had to fight against the kind of stupid criticism that condemned him  \"to listen to one of Beethoven's symphonies as a penance likely to give  him the most excruciating torture.\"[111] And yet after this, and after  his admission to the Academy, after _Henry VIII_ and the _Symphonie avec  orgue_, he still remained aloof from praise or blame, and judged his  triumphs with sad severity:        \"Tu connaitras les yeux menteurs, l'hypocrisie           Des serrements de mains,      Le masque d'amitie cachant la jalousie,           Les pales lendemains        \"De ces jours de triomphe ou le troupeau vulgaire           Qui pese au meme poids      L'histrion ridicule et le genie austere           Vous mets sur le pavois.\"[112]    M. Saint-Saens has now grown old, and his fame has spread abroad, but he  has not capitulated. Not many years ago he wrote to a German journalist:  \"I take very little notice of either praise or censure, not because I  have an exalted idea of my own merits (which would be foolish), but  because in doing my work, and fulfilling the function of my nature, as  an apple-tree grows apples, I have no need to trouble myself with other  people's views.\"[113]    [Footnote 111: C. Saint-Saens, _Harmonie et Melodie_, 1885.]    [Footnote 112: C. Saint-Saens, _Rimes familieres_, 1890.        You will know the lying eyes, the insincerity      Of pressures of the hand,      The mask of friendship that hides jealousy.      The tame to-morrows        Of these days of triumph, when the vulgar herd      Crowns you with honour;      Judging rare genius to be      Equal in merit to the wit of clowns.    ]    [Footnote 113: Letter written to M. Levin, the correspondent of the  _Boersen-Courier_ of Berlin, 9 September, 1901.]    Such independence is rare at any time; but it is very rare in our day,  when the power of public opinion is tyrannical; and it is rarest of all  in France, where artists are perhaps more sociable than in other  countries. Of all qualities in an artist it is the most precious; for it  forms the foundation of his character, and is the guarantee of his  conscience and innate strength. So we must not hide it under a bushel.           *       *       *       *       *    The significance of M. Saint-Saens in art is a double one, for one must  judge him from the inside as well as the outside of France. He stands  for something exceptional in French music, something which was almost  unique until just lately: that is, a great classical spirit and a fine  breadth of musical culture--German culture, we must say, since the  foundation of all modern art rests on the German classics. French music  of the nineteenth century is rich in clever artists, imaginative writers  of melody, and skilful dramatists; but it is poor in true musicians, and  in good and solid workmanship. Apart from two or three splendid  exceptions, our composers have too much the character of gifted amateurs  who compose music as a pastime, and regard it, not as a special form of  thought, but as a sort of dress for literary ideas. Our musical  education is superficial: it may be got for a few years, in a formal  way, at a Conservatoire, but it is not within reach of all; the child  does not breathe music as, in a way, he breathes the atmosphere of  literature and oratory; and although nearly everyone in France has an  instinctive feeling for beautiful writing, only a very few people care  for beautiful music. From this arise the common faults and failings in  our music. It has remained a luxurious art; it has not become, like  German music, the poetical expression of the people's thought.    To bring this about we should need a combination of conditions that are  very rare in"]]]
