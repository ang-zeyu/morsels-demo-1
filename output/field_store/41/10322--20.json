[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/157"],[0,"Daddy-Long-Legs (#17)"],[1,"away from chapel very sober.    Am I too familiar, Daddy?  Ought I to treat you with more dignity and  aloofness?--Yes, I'm sure I ought.  I'll begin again.    My Dear Mr. Smith,    You will be pleased to hear that I passed successfully my mid-year  examinations, and am now commencing work in the new semester.  I am  leaving chemistry--having completed the course in qualitative  analysis--and am entering upon the study of biology.  I approach this  subject with some hesitation, as I understand that we dissect  angleworms and frogs.    An extremely interesting and valuable lecture was given in the chapel  last week upon Roman Remains in Southern France.  I have never listened  to a more illuminating exposition of the subject.    We are reading Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey in connection with our course  in English Literature.  What an exquisite work it is, and how  adequately it embodies his conceptions of Pantheism!  The Romantic  movement of the early part of the last century, exemplified in the  works of such poets as Shelley, Byron, Keats, and Wordsworth, appeals  to me very much more than the Classical period that preceded it.  Speaking of poetry, have you ever read that charming little thing of  Tennyson's called Locksley Hall?    I am attending gymnasium very regularly of late.  A proctor system has  been devised, and failure to comply with the rules causes a great deal  of inconvenience.  The gymnasium is equipped with a very beautiful  swimming tank of cement and marble, the gift of a former graduate.  My  room-mate, Miss McBride, has given me her bathing-suit (it shrank so  that she can no longer wear it) and I am about to begin swimming  lessons.    We had delicious pink ice-cream for dessert last night.  Only vegetable  dyes are used in colouring the food.  The college is very much opposed,  both from aesthetic and hygienic motives, to the use of aniline dyes.    The weather of late has been ideal--bright sunshine and clouds  interspersed with a few welcome snow-storms. I and my companions have  enjoyed our walks to and from classes--particularly from.    Trusting, my dear Mr. Smith, that this will find you in your usual good  health,               I remain,                 Most cordially yours,                                        Jerusha Abbott                                                         24th April    Dear Daddy,    Spring has come again!  You should see how lovely the campus is.  I  think you might come and look at it for yourself.  Master Jervie  dropped in again last Friday--but he chose a most unpropitious time,  for Sallie and Julia and I were just running to catch a train.  And  where do you think we were going?  To Princeton, to attend a dance and  a ball game, if you please!  I didn't ask you if I might go, because I  had a feeling that your secretary would say no.  But it was entirely  regular; we had leave-of-absence from college, and Mrs. McBride  chaperoned us.  We had a charming time--but I shall have to omit  details; they are too many and complicated.                                                             Saturday    Up before dawn!  The night watchman called us--six of us--and we made  coffee in a chafing dish (you never saw so many grounds!) and walked  two miles to the top of One Tree Hill to see the sun rise.  We had to  scramble up the last slope!  The sun almost beat us!  And perhaps you  think we didn't bring back appetites to breakfast!    Dear me, Daddy, I seem to have a very ejaculatory style today; this  page is peppered with exclamations.    I meant to have written a lot about the budding trees and the new  cinder path in the athletic field, and the awful lesson we have in  biology for tomorrow, and the new canoes on the lake, and Catherine  Prentiss who has pneumonia, and Prexy's Angora kitten that strayed from  home and has been boarding in Fergussen Hall for two weeks until a  chambermaid reported it, and about my three new dresses--white and pink  and blue polka dots with a hat to match--but I am too sleepy.  I am  always making this an excuse, am I not?  But a girls' college is a busy  place and we do get tired by the end of the day!  Particularly when the  day begins at dawn.                               Affectionately,                                                 Judy                                                             15th May    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Is it good manners when you get into a car just to stare straight ahead  and not see anybody else?    A very beautiful lady in a very beautiful velvet dress got into the car  today, and without the slightest expression sat for fifteen minutes and  looked at a sign advertising suspenders.  It doesn't seem polite to  ignore everybody else as though you were the only important person  present.  Anyway, you miss a lot.  While she was absorbing that silly  sign, I was studying a whole car full of interesting human beings.    The accompanying illustration is hereby reproduced for the first time.  It looks like a spider on the end of a string, but it isn't at all;  it's a picture of me learning to swim in the tank in the gymnasium.    The instructor hooks a rope into a ring in the back of my belt, and  runs it through a pulley in the ceiling.  It would be a beautiful  system if one had perfect confidence in the probity of one's  instructor.  I'm always afraid, though, that she will let the rope get  slack, so I keep one anxious eye on her and swim with the other, and  with this divided interest I do not make the progress that I otherwise  might.    Very miscellaneous weather we're having of late.  It was raining when I  commenced and now the sun is shining.  Sallie and I are going out to  play tennis--thereby gaining exemption from Gym.                                                 A week later    I should have finished this letter long ago, but I didn't. You don't  mind, do you, Daddy, if I'm not very regular?  I really do love to  write to you; it gives me such a respectable feeling of having some  family.  Would you like me to tell you something?  You are not the only  man to whom I write letters.  There are two others!  I have been  receiving beautiful long letters this winter from Master Jervie (with  typewritten envelopes so Julia won't recognize the writing). Did you  ever hear anything so shocking?  And every week or so a very scrawly  epistle, usually on yellow tablet paper, arrives from Princeton.  All  of which I answer with business-like promptness.  So you see--I am not  so different from other girls--I get letters, too.    Did I tell you that I have been elected a member of the Senior Dramatic  Club?  Very recherche organization.  Only seventy-five members out of  one thousand.  Do you think as a consistent Socialist that I ought to  belong?    What do you suppose is at present engaging my attention in sociology?  I am writing (figurez vous!) a paper on the Care of Dependent Children.  The Professor shuffled up his subjects and dealt them out  promiscuously, and that fell to me.  C'est drole ca n'est pas?    There goes the gong for dinner.  I'll post this as I pass the box.                                       Affectionately,                                                         J.                                                             4th June    Dear Daddy,    Very busy time--commencement in ten days, examinations tomorrow; lots  of studying, lots of packing, and the outdoor world so lovely that it  hurts you to stay inside.    But never mind, vacation's coming.  Julia is going abroad this  summer--it makes the fourth time.  No doubt about it, Daddy, goods are  not distributed evenly.  Sallie, as usual, goes to the Adirondacks.  And what do you think I am going to do?  You may have three guesses.  Lock Willow?  Wrong.  The Adirondacks with Sallie?  Wrong.  (I'll never  attempt that again; I was discouraged last year.) Can't you guess  anything else?  You're not very inventive.  I'll tell you, Daddy, if  you'll promise not to make a lot of objections.  I warn your secretary  in advance that my mind is made up.    I am going to spend the summer at the seaside with a Mrs. Charles  Paterson and tutor her daughter who is to enter college in the autumn.  I met her through the McBrides, and she is a very charming woman.  I am  to give lessons in English and Latin to the younger daughter, too, but  I shall have a little time to myself, and I shall be earning fifty  dollars a month!  Doesn't that impress you as a perfectly exorbitant  amount?  She offered it; I should have blushed to ask for more than  twenty-five.    I finish at Magnolia (that's where she lives) the first of September,  and shall probably spend the remaining three weeks at Lock Willow--I  should like to see the Semples again and all the friendly animals.    How does my programme strike you, Daddy?  I am getting quite  independent, you see.  You have put me on my feet and I think I can  almost walk alone by now.    Princeton commencement and our examinations exactly coincide--which is  an awful blow.  Sallie and I did so want to get away in time for it,  but of course that is utterly impossible.    Goodbye, Daddy.  Have a nice summer and come back in the autumn rested  and ready for another year of work.  (That's what you ought to be  writing to me!) I haven't any idea what you do in the summer, or how  you amuse yourself.  I can't visualize your surroundings.  Do you play  golf or hunt or ride horseback or just sit in the sun and meditate?    Anyway, whatever it is, have a good time and don't forget Judy.                                                                 10th June    Dear Daddy,    This is the hardest letter I ever wrote, but I have decided what I must  do, and there isn't going to be any turning back.  It is very sweet and  generous and dear of you to wish to send me to Europe this summer--for  the moment I was intoxicated by the idea; but sober second thoughts  said no.  It would be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15707"],[0,"Zoonomia; Or, the Laws of Organic Life, Vol. I (#17)"],[1,"defect of stimulus to  recur, because now the new association conspires with the defective  irritation in introducing the torpid action of this part of the diurnal  catenation. In this manner many fever-fits commence, where the patient is  for some days indisposed at certain hours, before the cold paroxysm of  fever is completely formed. See Sect. XVII. 3. 3. on Catenation of Animal  Motions.    6. If a stimulus, which at first excited the affected organ into so great  exertion as to produce sensation, be continued for a certain time, it will  cease to produce sensation both then and when repeated, though the  irritative motions in consequence of it may continue or be re-excited.    Many catenations of irritative motions were at first succeeded by  sensation, as the apparent motions of objects when we walk past them, and  probably the vital motions themselves in the early state of our existence.  But as those sensations were followed by no movements of the system in  consequence of them, they gradually ceased to be produced, not being joined  to any succeeding link of catenation. Hence contagious matter, which has  for some weeks stimulated the system into great and permanent sensation,  ceases afterwards to produce general sensation, or inflammation, though it  may still induce topical irritations. See Sect. XXXIII. 2. 8. XIX. 9.    Our absorbent system then seems to receive those contagious matters, which  it has before experienced, in the same manner as it imbibes common moisture  or other fluids; that is, without being thrown into so violent action as to  produce sensation; the consequence of which is an increase of daily energy  or activity, till inflammation and its consequences succeed.    7. If a stimulus excites an organ into such violent contractions as to  produce sensation, the motions of which organ had not usually produced  sensation, this new sensorial power, added to the irritation occasioned by  the stimulus, increases the activity of the organ. And if this activity be  catenated with the diurnal circle of actions, an increasing inflammation is  produced; as in the evening paroxysms of small-pox, and other fevers with  inflammation. And hence schirrous tumours, tendons and membranes, and  probably the arteries themselves become inflamed, when they are strongly  stimulated.    IV. _Of Stimulus greater than natural._    1. A quantity of stimulus greater than natural, producing an increased  exertion of sensorial power, whether that exertion be in the mode of  irritation, sensation, volition, or association, diminishes the general  quantity of it. This fact is observable in the progress of intoxication, as  the increased quantity or energy of the irritative motions, owing to the  stimulus of vinous spirit, introduces much pleasurable sensation into the  system, and much exertion of muscular or sensual motions in consequence of  this increased sensation; the voluntary motions, and even the associate  ones, become much impaired or diminished; and delirium and staggering  succeed. See Sect. XXI. on Drunkenness. And hence the great prostration of  the strength of the locomotive muscles in some fevers, is owing to the  exhaustion of sensorial power by the increased action of the arterial  system.    In like manner a stimulus greater than natural, applied to a part of the  system, increases the exertion of sensorial power in that part, and  diminishes it in some other part. As in the commencement of scarlet fever,  it is usual to see great redness and heat on the faces and breasts of  children, while at the same time their feet are colder than natural;  partial heats are observable in other fevers with debility, and are  generally attended with torpor or quiescence of some other part of the  system. But these partial exertions of sensorial power are sometimes  attended with increased partial exertions in other parts of the system,  which sympathize with them, as the flushing of the face after a full meal.  Both these therefore are to be ascribed to sympathetic associations,  explained in Sect. XXXV. and not to general exhaustion or accumulation of  sensorial power.    2. A quantity of stimulus greater than natural, producing an increased  exertion of sensorial power in any particular organ, diminishes the  quantity of it in that organ. This appears from the contractions of animal  fibres being not so easily excited by a less stimulus after the organ has  been subjected to a greater. Thus after looking at any luminous object of a  small size, as at the setting sun, for a short time, so as not much to  fatigue the eye, this part of the retina becomes less sensible to smaller  quantities of light; hence when the eyes are turned on other less luminous  parts of the sky, a dark spot is seen resembling the shape of the sun, or  other luminous object which we last behold. See Sect. XL. No. 2.    Thus we are some time before we can distinguish objects in an obscure room  after coming from bright day-light, though the iris presently contracts  itself. We are not able to hear weak sounds after loud ones. And the  stomachs of those who have been much habituated to the stronger stimulus of  fermented or spirituous liquors, are not excited into due action by weaker  ones.    3. A quantity of stimulus something greater than the last mentioned, or  longer continued, induces the organ into spasmodic action, which ceases and  recurs alternately. Thus on looking for a time on the setting sun, so as  not greatly to fatigue the sight, a yellow spectrum is seen when the eyes  are closed and covered, which continues for a time, and then disappears and  recurs repeatedly before it entirely vanishes. See Sect. XL. No. 5. Thus  the action of vomiting ceases and is renewed by intervals, although the  emetic drug is thrown up with the first effort. A tenesmus continues by  intervals some time after the exclusion of acrid excrement; and the  pulsations of the heart of a viper are said to continue some time after it  is cleared from its blood.    In these cases the violent contractions of the fibres produce pain  according to law 4; and this pain constitutes an additional kind or  quantity of excitement, which again induces the fibres into contraction,  and which painful excitement is again renewed, and again induces  contractions of the fibres with gradually diminishing effect.    4. A quantity of stimulus greater than that last mentioned, or longer  continued, induces the antagonist muscles into spasmodic action. This is  beautifully illustrated by the ocular spectra described in Sect. XL. No. 6.  to which the reader is referred. From those experiments there is reason to  conclude that the fatigued part of the retina throws itself into a contrary  mode of action like oscitation or pandiculation, as soon as the stimulus,  which has fatigued it, is withdrawn; but that it still remains liable to be  excited into action by any other colours except the colour with which it  has been fatigued. Thus the yawning and stretching the limbs after a  continued action or attitude seems occasioned by the antagonist muscles  being stimulated by their extension during the contractions of those in  action, or in the situation in which that action last left them.    5. A quantity of stimulus greater than the last, or longer continued,  induces variety of convulsions or fixed spasms either of the affected organ  or of the moving fibres in the other parts of the body. In respect to the  spectra in the eye, this is well illustrated in No. 7 and 8, of Sect. XL.  Epileptic convulsions, as the emprosthotonos and opisthotonos, with the  cramp of the calf of the leg, locked jaw, and other cataleptic fits, appear  to originate from pain, as some of these patients scream aloud before the  convulsion takes place; which seems at first to be an effort to relieve  painful sensation, and afterwards an effort to prevent it.    In these cases the violent contractions of the fibres produce so much pain,  as to constitute a perpetual excitement; and that in so great a degree as  to allow but small intervals of relaxation of the contracting fibres as in  convulsions, or no intervals at all as in fixed spasms.    6. A quantity of stimulus greater than the last, or longer continued,  produces a paralysis of the organ. In many cases this paralysis is only a  temporary effect, as on looking long on a small area of bright red silk  placed on a sheet of white paper on the floor in a strong light, the red  silk gradually becomes paler, and at length disappears; which evinces that  a part of the retina, by being violently excited, becomes for a time  unaffected by the stimulus of that colour. Thus cathartic medicines,  opiates, poisons, contagious matter, cease to influence our system after it  has been habituated to the use of them, except by the exhibition of  increased quantities of them; our fibres not only become unaffected by  stimuli, by which they have previously been violently irritated, as by the  matter of the small-pox or measles; but they also become unaffected by  sensation, where the violent exertions, which disabled them, were in  consequence of too great quantity of sensation. And lastly the fibres,  which become disobedient to volition, are probably disabled by their too  violent exertions in consequence of too great a quantity of volition.    After every exertion of our fibres a temporary paralysis succeeds, whence  the intervals of all muscular contractions, as mentioned in No. 3 and 4 of  this Section; the immediate cause of these more permanent kinds of  paralysis is probably owing in the same manner to the too great exhaustion  of the spirit of animation in the affected part; so that a stronger  stimulus is required, or one of a different kind from that, which  occasioned those too violent contractions, to again excite the affected  organ into activity; and if a stronger stimulus could be applied, it must  again induce paralysis.
