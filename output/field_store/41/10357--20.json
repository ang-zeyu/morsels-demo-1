When the Navy was young and the service more arduous; when  its vessels were merely armed merchantmen, many of them simply tubs and  death traps and not the floating castles of today, the services of  Negroes were not disdained; but times and national ideals had changed,  and, the shame of it, not to the credit of a Commonwealth, for whose  birth a Negro had shed the first blood, and a Washington had faced the  rigors of a Valley Forge, a Lincoln the bullet of an assassin.    The annual report of the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, rendered to  the Secretary of the Navy and covering the fiscal year ending June 30,  1918, showed that in the United States Navy, the United States Naval  Reserve Force and the National Naval Volunteers, there was a total of  435,398 men. Of that great number only 5,328 were Negroes, a trifle over  one percent. Between June and November 1918, the Navy was recruited to a  total force somewhat in excess of 500,000 men. Carrying out the same  percentage, it is apparent that the aggregate number of Negroes serving,  in the Navy at the close of the war, could not have been much in excess  of 6,000.    Some extra enlistments of Negroes were contemplated, as the Navy had in  process of establishment just prior to the armistice, a new service for  Negro recruits. It was to be somewhat similar to the Pioneer units of  the army, partaking in some degree of the character of Marines, just as  the Pioneers partake of the character of infantry, but in general  respects resembling more the engineer and stevedore units. About 600 men  had been selected for this service when the project was abandoned on  account of the ending of the war.    With the exception of a very limited number who have been permitted to  attain the rank of petty officer, Negroes in the Navy were confined to  menial occupations. They were attached to the firing forces as coal  passers, while others served as cooks assistants, mess attendants and in  similar duties. Quite a number were full rated cooks. A few were water  tenders, electricians and gunners' mates, each of which occupations  entitled them to the aforesaid rank of petty officer. Among the petty  officers some had by sheer merit attained the rank of chief petty  officer, which is about equal to the rank of sergeant in the army.    The idea of separate ships for the Negro might to some degree ameliorate  the sting incident to race prohibition in that arm of government  service. The query is advanced that if we can have black colonels,  majors, captains and lieutenants in the army, why cannot we have black  commanders, lieutenants, ensigns and such in the Navy?    Negroes have often and in divers ways displayed their intelligence and  efficiency in the Navy. Take, for instance, the case of John Jordan, a  Negro of Virginia, who was chief gunner's mate on Admiral Dewey's  flagship the \"Olympia\" during the Spanish-American war, and was the man  who fired the first shot at the enemy at Manila Bay. A Negro chief  electrician, Salisbury Brooks, was the originator of inventions which  were adopted without reservation by the Navy designers and changed the  construction of modern battle ships.    One of the principal instructors on the U.S.S. Essex, the government  training ship at Norfolk, is Matthew Anderson, a Negro. He has trained  thousands of men, many of them now officers, in the art and duties of  seamanship. Scores of Negroes; men of the type of these in the Navy,  would furnish the nucleus for officers and crews of separate Negro  ships.    In a recent issue of \"Our Navy\" a magazine devoted entirely to naval  affairs, especially as regards the enlisted man, a writer reflects the  opinion of these men in the following article:         \"Whether you like the black man or not, whether you believe in a       square deal for him or not, you can't point an accusing finger at       his patriotism, his Americanism or his fighting ability. It is fair       to neither the white man nor the black man to have the black man       compete with the white man in the Navy. True, we have black petty       officers here and there in the Navy, and in some cases black chief       petty officers. It stands to reason that they must have been mighty       good men to advance. They surely must know their business--every       inch of it--to advance to these ratings. Yet they are not wanted in       these ratings because they involve the black man having charge of       white men under him. Outside of the messman branch you will find       comparatively few Negroes in the Navy today.         \"There should be 'black ships' assigned to be manned by American       Negroes. These are days of democracy, equality and freedom,\"       continues the writer. \"If a man is good enough to go over the top       and die for these principles, he is good enough to promote in the       Navy. Why not try it? Put the black men on their own ships. Promote       them, rate them, just the same as the white man. But above all keep       them on their own ships. It is fair to them and fair to the white       men. The Brazilian and Argentine navies have 'black ships.'\"    Recruiting officers of the Navy have recently opened the doors to  discharged Negro soldiers, and some civilians. If physically fit they  are permitted to enlist as machinists and electricians. The Navy has  opened a school for machinists at Charleston, S.C., and a school for  electricians at Hampton Roads, Va.    Men for the machinists' school are enlisted as firemen 3rd class. While  in training they are paid $30 a month. They also receive their clothing  allotment, their food, dry comfortable quarters in which to live, and  all text books and practical working tools. In return for this chance to  become proficient in a very necessary trade, all that is required of  those enlisting is a knowledge of common fractions, ambition to learn  the trade, energy and a strict attention to the instruction given them.    Subjects taught in the course are arithmetic, note book sketching,  practical engineering, theoretical engineering, clipping and filing,  drilling, pipe fitting, repair work, rebabbiting, brazing, tin smithing,  lathes, shapers, milling machines and grinders. It will be seen that  they get a vast amount of mechanical knowledge and practically two  trades, machinists and engineering.    In the electrical school the course is equally thorough. The men get a  high grade of instruction, regardless of cost of material and tools. The  best text books that can be had are available for their use.    This liberality in order to get machinists and electricians in the Navy,  argues that some change of attitude towards the Negro is contemplated.    It may evolve into the establishment of \"black ships.\" The Negro sailor  has been pleading for years that his color has been a bar to him. With a  ship of his own, would come his chance. He would strive; do all within  his power to make it a success and would succeed.          CHAPTER IX.    PREVIOUS WARS IN WHICH THE NEGRO FIGURED.      SHOT HEARD AROUND THE WORLD--CRISPUS ATTTUCKS--SLAVE LEADS SONS OF  FREEDOM--THE BOSTON MASSACRE--ANNIVERSARY KEPT FOR YEARS--WILLIAM NELL,  HISTORIAN--3,000 NEGROES IN WASHINGTON'S FORCES--A STIRRING  HISTORY--NEGRO WOMAN SOLDIER--BORDER INDIAN WARS--NEGRO HEROES      Our American school histories teach us that the \"shot which was heard  around the world\",--the opening gun of the Revolutionary war, was fired  at Lexington in 1775. The phrase embodies a precious sentiment; time has  molded many leaders, the inspiration for almost a century and a half of  the patriotic youth of our land. This is as it should be. All honor and  all praise to the deathless heroes of that time and occasion.    But why has not history been more just; at least, more explicit? Why not  say that the shot which started the Revolution--that first great  movement for human liberty and the emancipation of nations--was fired  five years earlier; was fired not by, but at, a Negro, Crispus Attucks?  The leader of the citizens in that event of March 5, 1770, known as the  Boston Massacre, he was the first man upon whom the British soldiers  fired and the first to fall; the pioneer martyr for American  independence.    It is perhaps fitting; a manifestation of the inscrutable ways of  Providence, that the first life given in behalf of a nation about to  throw off a yoke of bondage, was that of a representative of a race;  despised, oppressed and enslaved.    Botta the historian, in speaking of the scenes of the 5th of March says:         \"The people were greatly exasperated. The multitude ran towards       King street, crying, 'Let us drive out these ribalds; they have no       business here.' The rioters rushed furiously towards the Custom       House; they approached the sentinel, crying 'Kill him, kill him!'       They assaulted him with snowballs, pieces of ice, and whatever they       could lay their hands upon.         \"The guard were then called, and in marching to the Custom House,       they encountered a band of the populace, led by a mulatto named       Attucks, who brandished their clubs and pelted them with snowballs.       The maledictions, the imprecations, the execrations of the       multitude, were horrible. In the midst of a torrent of invective       from every quarter, the military were challenged to fire. The       populace advanced to the points of their bayonets.         \"The soldiers appeared like statues; the cries, the howlings, the       menaces, the violent din of bells still sounding the alarm,       increased the confusion and the horrors of these moments; at length       the mulatto Attucks and twelve of his companions, pressing forward,       environed the soldiers and striking their muskets with their clubs,       cried to the multitude: 'Be not afraid, they dare not fire; why "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1662"],[0,"The 1997 CIA World Factbook (#17)"],[1,"of information and personnel in cooperation  with the UN and other international agencies; Article 4 - does not  recognize, dispute, or establish territorial claims and no new claims  shall be asserted while the treaty is in force; Article 5 - prohibits  nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes; Article 6 -  includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees  00 minutes south; Article 7 - treaty-state observers have free access,  including aerial observation, to any area and may inspect all  stations, installations, and equipment; advance notice of all  activities and of the introduction of military personnel must be  given; Article 8 - allows for jurisdiction over observers and  scientists by their own states; Article 9 - frequent consultative  meetings take place among member nations; Article 10 - treaty states  will discourage activities by any country in Antarctica that are  contrary to the treaty; Article 11 - disputes to be settled peacefully  by the parties concerned or, ultimately, by the ICJ; Articles 12, 13,  14 - deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among  involved nations; Other agreements - more than 170 recommendations  adopted at treaty consultative meetings and ratified by governments  include - Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and  Flora (1964); Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals  (1972); Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living  Resources (1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but  was subsequently rejected; in 1991 the Protocol on Environmental  Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was signed and awaits ratification;  this agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic  environment through five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna,  and flora, environmental impact assessments, waste management, and  protected areas; it also prohibits all activities relating to mineral  resources except scientific research; 21 parties have ratified  Protocol as of April 1996    Legal system: US law, including certain criminal offenses by or  against US nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under  jurisdiction of other countries.
