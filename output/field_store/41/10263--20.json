Taken singly they were not beautiful; taken together they were. Was  it not because there was a certain harmony about them? The old sow was  suited to the little pigs, and the little pigs to their mother, the  old boar to the rotten pumpkin, and all to the mud. They suggested the  thought of nothing that should be added, of nothing that should be  taken away. And, he wondered on vaguely, was not that the secret of all  beauty, that you who look on-- So he stood dreaming, and leaned further  and further over the sod wall, and looked at the pigs.    All this time Bonaparte Blenkins was sloping down from the house in an  aimless sort of way; but he kept one eye fixed on the pigsty, and each  gyration brought him nearer to it. Waldo stood like a thing asleep when  Bonaparte came close up to him.    In old days, when a small boy, playing in an Irish street-gutter, he,  Bonaparte, had been familiarly known among his comrades under the title  of Tripping Ben; this, from the rare ease and dexterity with which,  by merely projecting his foot, he could precipitate any unfortunate  companion on to the crown of his head. Years had elapsed, and Tripping  Ben had become Bonaparte; but the old gift was in him still. He came  close to the pigsty. All the defunct memories of his boyhood returned on  him in a flood, as, with an adroit movement, he inserted his leg between  Waldo and the wall and sent him over into the pigsty.    The little pigs were startled at the strange intruder, and ran behind  their mother, who sniffed at him. Tant Sannie smote her hands together  and laughed; but Bonaparte was far from joining her. Lost in reverie, he  gazed at the distant horizon.    The sudden reversal of head and feet had thrown out the volume that  Waldo carried in his breast. Bonaparte picked it up and began to inspect  it, as the boy climbed slowly over the wall. He would have walked off  sullenly, but he wanted his book, and he waited until it should be given  him.    \"Ha!\" said Bonaparte, raising his eyes from the leaves of the book which  he was examining, \"I hope your coat has not been injured; it is of an  elegant cut. An heirloom, I presume, from your paternal grandfather? It  looks nice now.\"    \"Oh, Lord! oh! Lord!\" cried Tant Sannie, laughing and holding her sides;  \"how the child looks--as though he thought the mud would never wash off.  Oh, Lord, I shall die! You, Bonaparte, are the funniest man I ever saw.\"    Bonaparte Blenkins was now carefully inspecting the volume he had picked  up. Among the subjects on which the darkness of his understanding had  been enlightened during his youth, Political Economy had not been one.  He was not, therefore, very clear as to what the nature of the book  might be; and as the name of the writer, J.S. Mill, might, for anything  he knew to the contrary, have belonged to a venerable member of the  British and Foreign Bible Society, it by no means threw light upon the  question. He was not in any way sure that Political Economy had nothing  to do with the cheapest way of procuring clothing for the army and navy,  which would be certainly both a political and economical subject.    But Bonaparte soon came to a conclusion as to the nature of the book  and its contents, by the application of a simple rule now largely  acted upon, but which, becoming universal, would save much thought and  valuable time. It is of marvellous simplicity, of infinite utility, of  universal applicability. It may easily be committed to memory and runs  thus:    Whenever you come into contact with any book, person, or opinion of  which you absolutely comprehend nothing, declare that book, person or  opinion to be immoral. Bespatter it, vituperate against it, strongly  insist that any man or woman harbouring it is a fool or a knave, or  both. Carefully abstain from studying it. Do all that in you lies to  annihilate that book, person, or opinion.    Acting on this rule, so wide in its comprehensiveness, so beautifully  simple in its working, Bonaparte approached Tant Sannie with the book in  his hand. Waldo came a step nearer, eyeing it like a dog whose young has  fallen into evil hands.    \"This book,\" said Bonaparte, \"is not a fit and proper study for a young  and immature mind.\"    Tant Sannie did not understand a word, and said:    \"What?\"    \"This book,\" said Bonaparte, bringing down his finger with energy on the  cover, \"this book is sleg, sleg, Davel, Davel!\"    Tant Sannie perceived from the gravity of his countenance that it was no  laughing matter. From the words \"sleg\" and \"Davel\" she understood that  the book was evil, and had some connection with the prince who pulls the  wires of evil over the whole earth.    \"Where did you get this book?\" she asked, turning her twinkling little  eyes on Waldo. \"I wish that my legs may be as thin as an Englishman's if  it isn't one of your father's. He had more sins than all the Kaffers in  Kafferland, for all that he pretended to be so good all those years, and  to live without a wife because he was thinking of the one that was dead!  As though ten dead wives could make up for one fat one with arms and  legs!\" cried Tant Sannie, snorting.    \"It was not my father's book,\" said the boy savagely. \"I got it from  your loft.\"    \"My loft! my book! How dare you?\" cried Tant Sannie.    \"It was Em's father's. She gave it me,\" he muttered more sullenly.    \"Give it here. What is the name of it? What is it about?\" she asked,  putting her finger upon the title.    Bonaparte understood.    \"Political Economy,\" he said slowly.    \"Dear Lord!\" said Tant Sannie, \"cannot one hear from the very sound  what an ungodly book it is! One can hardly say the name. Haven't we got  curses enough on this farm?\" cried Tant Sannie, eloquently; \"my best  imported Merino ram dying of nobody knows what, and the short-horn cow  casting her two calves, and the sheep eaten up with the scab and the  drought? And is this a time to bring ungodly things about the place, to  call down the vengeance of Almighty God to punish us more? Didn't the  minister tell me when I was confirmed not to read any book except my  Bible and hymn-book, that the devil was in all the rest? And I never  have read any other book,\" said Tant Sannie with virtuous energy, \"and I  never will!\"    Waldo saw that the fate of his book was sealed, and turned sullenly on  his heel.    \"So you will not stay to hear what I say!\" cried Tant Sannie. \"There,  take your Polity-gollity-gominy, your devil's book!\" she cried, flinging  the book at his head with much energy.    It merely touched his forehead on one side and fell to the ground.    \"Go on,\" she cried; \"I know you are going to talk to yourself. People  who talk to themselves always talk to the devil. Go and tell him all  about it. Go, go! run!\" cried Tant Sannie.    But the boy neither quickened nor slackened his pace, and passed  sullenly round the back of the wagon-house.    Books have been thrown at other heads before and since that summer  afternoon, by hands more white and delicate than those of the  Boer-woman; but whether the result of the process has been in any case  wholly satisfactory, may be questioned. We love that with a peculiar  tenderness, we treasure it with a peculiar care, it has for us quite  a fictitious value, for which we have suffered. If we may not carry it  anywhere else we will carry it in our hearts, and always to the end.    Bonaparte Blenkins went to pick up the volume, now loosened from its  cover, while Tant Sannie pushed the stumps of wood further into the  oven. Bonaparte came close to her, tapped the book knowingly, nodded,  and looked at the fire. Tant Sannie comprehended, and, taking the volume  from his hand, threw it into the back of the oven. It lay upon the heap  of coals, smoked, flared, and blazed, and the \"Political Economy\" was no  more--gone out of existence, like many another poor heretic of flesh and  blood.    Bonaparte grinned, and to watch the process brought his face so near  the oven door that the white hair on his eyebrows got singed. He then  inquired if there were any more in the loft.    Learning that there were, he made signs indicative of taking up armfuls  and flinging them into the fire. But Tant Sannie was dubious. The  deceased Englishman had left all his personal effects specially to his  child. It was all very well for Bonaparte to talk of burning the books.  He had had his hair spiritually pulled, and she had no wish to repeat  his experience.    She shook her head. Bonaparte was displeased. But then a happy thought  occurred to him. He suggested that the key of the loft should henceforth  be put into his own safe care and keeping--no one gaining possession of  it without his permission. To this Tant Sannie readily assented, and the  two walked lovingly to the house to look for it.        Chapter 1.XII. He Bites.    Bonaparte Blenkins was riding home on the grey mare. He had ridden out  that afternoon, partly for the benefit of his health, partly to  maintain his character as overseer of the farm. As he rode on slowly, he  thoughtfully touched the ears of the grey mare with his whip.    \"No, Bon, my boy,\" he addressed himself, \"don't propose! You can't marry  for four years, on account of the will; then why propose? Wheedle her,  tweedle her, teedle her, but don't let her make sure of you. When a  woman,\" said Bonaparte, sagely resting his finger against the side of  his nose, \"When a woman is sure of you she does what she likes with  you; but when she isn't, you do what you like with her. And I--\" said  Bonaparte.    Here he drew the horse up suddenly and looked. He was now close to the  house, and leaning over the pigsty wall, in company with Em, who was  showing her the pigs, was a strange female figure. It was the first  visitor that had appeared on the farm since his arrival, and he looked  at her with interest.

I could not read with any perseverance, and  during the whole month I was locked up, I only completed Carlyle's  'History of Frederick the Great' and Mill's 'Essay on Liberty,' neither  of which satisfied my peevish expectations. When at last the sun sank  behind the fort upon the hill and twilight marked the end of another  wretched day, I used to walk up and down the courtyard looking  reflectively at the dirty, unkempt 'zarps' who stood on guard, racking  my brains to find some way, by force or fraud, by steel or gold, of  regaining my freedom. Little did these Transvaal Policemen think, as  they leaned on their rifles, smoking and watching the 'tame officers,'  of the dark schemes of which they were the object, or of the peril in  which they would stand but for the difficulties that lay _beyond_ the  wall. For we would have made short work of them and their weapons any  misty night could we but have seen our way clear after that.    As the darkness thickened, the electric lamps were switched on and the  whole courtyard turned blue-white with black velvet shadows. Then the  bell clanged, and we crowded again into the stifling dining hall for the  last tasteless meal of the barren day. The same miserable stories were  told again and again--Colonel Moller's surrender after Talana Hill, and  the white flag at Nicholson's Nek--until I knew how the others came to  Pretoria as well as I knew my own story.    'We never realised what had happened until we were actually prisoners,'  said the officers of the Dublin Fusiliers Mounted Infantry, who had been  captured with Colonel Moller on October 20. 'The \"cease fire\" sounded:  no one knew what had happened. Then we were ordered to form up at the  farmhouse, and there we found Boers, who told us to lay down our arms:  we were delivered into their hands and never even allowed to have a  gallop for freedom. But wait for the Court of Inquiry.'    I used always to sit next to Colonel Carleton at dinner, and from him  and from the others learned the story of Nicholson's Nek, which it is  not necessary to repeat here, but which filled me with sympathy for the  gallant commander and soldiers who were betrayed by the act of an  irresponsible subordinate. The officers of the Irish Fusiliers told me  of the amazement with which they had seen the white flag flying. 'We had  still some ammunition,' they said; 'it is true the position was  indefensible--but we only wanted to fight it out.'    'My company was scarcely engaged,' said one poor captain, with tears of  vexation in his eyes at the memory; and the Gloucesters told the same  tale.    'We saw the hateful thing flying. The firing stopped. No one knew by  whose orders the flag had been hoisted. While we doubted the Boers were  all among us disarming the men.'    I will write no more upon these painful subjects except to say this,  that the hoisting of a white flag in token of surrender is an act which  can be justified only by clear proof that there was no prospect of  gaining the slightest military advantage by going on fighting; and that  the raising of a white flag in any case by an unauthorised person--i.e.  not the officer in chief command--in such a manner as to compromise the  resistance of a force, deserves sentence of death, though in view of the  high standard of discipline and honour prevailing in her Majesty's army,  it might not be necessary to carry the sentence into effect. I earnestly  trust that in justice to gallant officers and soldiers, who have  languished these weary months in Pretoria, there will be a strict  inquiry into the circumstances under which they became prisoners of war.  I have no doubt we shall be told that it is a foolish thing to wash  dirty linen in public; but much better wash it in public than wear it  foul.    One day shortly after I had arrived I had an interesting visit, for de  Souza, wishing to have an argument brought Mr. Grobelaar to see me. This  gentleman was the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and had just  returned from Mafeking, whither he had been conducting a 6-inch gun. He  was a very well-educated person, and so far as I could tell, honest and  capable besides. With him came Reuter's Agent, Mr. Mackay, and the  odious Malan. I received them sitting on my bed in the dormitory, and  when they had lighted cigars, of which I always kept a stock, we had a  regular _durbar_. I began:    'Well, Mr. Grobelaar, you see how your Government treats representatives  of the Press.'    _Grobelaar_. 'I hope you have nothing to complain of    _Self_. 'Look at the sentries with loaded rifles on every side. I might  be a wild beast instead of a special correspondent.'    _Grobelaar_. 'Ah, but putting aside the sentries with loaded rifles, you  do not, I trust, Mr. Churchill, make any complaint.'    _Self_. 'My chief objection to this place is that I am in it.'    _Grobelaar_. 'That of course is your misfortune, and Mr. Chamberlain's  fault.    _Self_. 'Not at all. We are a peace-loving people, but we had no choice  but to fight or be--what was it your burghers told me in the  camps?--\"driven into the sea.\" The responsibility of the war is upon you  and your President.'    _Grobelaar_. 'Don't you believe that. We did not want to fight. We only  wanted to be left alone.'    _Self_. 'You never wanted war?'    _de Souza_. 'Ah, my God, no! Do you think we would fight Great Britain  for amusement?'    _Self_. 'Then why did you make every preparation--turn the Republics  into armed camps--prepare deep-laid plans for the invasion of our  Colonies?'    _Grobelaar_. 'Why, what could we do after the Jameson Raid? We had to be  ready to protect ourselves.'    _Self_. 'Surely less extensive armaments would have been sufficient to  guard against another similar inroad.'    _Grobelaar_. 'But we knew your Government was behind the Raiders.  Jameson was in front, but Rhodes and your Colonial Office were at his  elbow.'    _Self_. 'As a matter of fact no two people were more disconcerted by the  Raid than Chamberlain and Rhodes. Besides, the British Government  disavowed the Raiders' action and punished the Raiders, who, I am quite  prepared to admit, got no more than they deserved.'    _de Souza_. 'I don't complain about the British Government's action at  the time of the Raid. Chamberlain behaved very honourably then. But it  was afterwards, when Rhodes was not punished, that we knew it was all a  farce, and that the British Government was bent on our destruction. When  the burghers knew that Rhodes was not punished they lost all trust in  England.'    _Malan_. 'Ya, ya. That Rhodes, he is the ... at the bottom of it all.  You wait and see what we will do to Rhodes when we take Kimberley.'    _Self_. 'Then you maintain, de Souza, that the distrust caused in this  country by the fact that Rhodes was not punished--though how you can  punish a man who breaks no law I cannot tell--was the sole cause of your  Government making these gigantic military preparations, because it is  certain that these preparations were the actual cause of war.'    _Grobelaar_. 'Why should they be a cause of war? We would never have  attacked you.'    _Self_. 'But at this moment you are invading Cape Colony and Natal,  while no British soldier has set foot on Republican soil. Moreover, it  was you who declared war upon us.'    _Grobelaar_. 'Naturally we were not such fools as to wait till your army  was here. As soon as you began to send your army, we were bound to  declare war. If you had sent it earlier we should have fought earlier.  Really, Mr. Churchill, you must see that is only common sense.'    _Self_. 'I am not criticising your policy or tactics. You hated us  bitterly--I dare say you had cause to. You made tremendous  preparations--I don't say you were wrong--but look at it from our point  of view. We saw a declared enemy armed and arming. Against us, and  against us alone, could his preparations be directed. It was time we  took some precautions: indeed, we were already too late. Surely what has  happened at the front proves that we had no designs against you. You  were ready. We were unready. It is the wolf and lamb if you like; but  the wolf was asleep and never before was a lamb with such teeth and  claws.'    _Grobelaar_. 'Do you really mean to say that we forced this war on you,  that you did not want to fight us?'    _Self_. 'The country did not wish for war with the Boers. Personally, I  have always done so. I saw that you had six rifles to every burgher in  the Republic. I knew what that meant. It meant that you were going to  raise a great Afrikander revolt against us. One does not set extra  places at table unless one expects company to dinner. On the other  hand, we have affairs all over the world, and at any moment may become  embroiled with a European power. At this time things are very quiet. The  board is clear in other directions. We can give you our undivided  attention. Armed and ambitious as you were, the war had to come sooner  or later. I have always said \"sooner.\" Therefore, I rejoiced when you  sent your ultimatum and roused the whole nation.'    _Malan_. 'You don't rejoice quite so much now.'    _Self_. 'My opinion is unaltered, except that the necessity for settling  the matter has become more apparent. As for the result, that, as I think  Mr. Grobelaar knows, is only a question of time and money expressed in  terms of blood and tears.'    _Grobelaar_. 'No: our opinion is quite unchanged. We prepared for the  war. We have always thought we could beat you. We do not doubt our  calculations now. We have done better even than we expected. The  President is extremely pleased.'    _Self_. 'There is no good arguing on that point. We shall have to fight  it out. But if you had tried to keep on friendly terms with us, the war  would not have come for a long time; and the delay was all on your  side.'"]]]
