He has a lot of landmark-dates already in his mind. He knows the  historic concatenation of events, and can usually place an event at its  right date in the chronology-table, by thinking of it in a rational way,  referring it to its antecedents, tracing its concomitants and  consequences, and thus ciphering out its date by connecting it with  theirs. The artificial memory-systems, recommending, as they do, such  irrational methods of thinking, are only to be recommended for the first  landmarks in a system, or for such purely detached facts as enjoy no  rational connection with the rest of our ideas. Thus the student of  physics may remember the order of the spectral colours by the word  _vibgyor_ which their initial letters make. The student of anatomy may  remember the position of the Mitral valve on the Left side of the heart  by thinking that L.M. stands also for 'long meter' in the hymn-books.    You now see why 'cramming' must be so poor a mode of study. Cramming  seeks to stamp things in by intense application immediately before the  ordeal. But a thing thus learned can form but few associations. On the  other hand, the same thing recurring on different days, in different  contexts, read, recited on, referred to again and again, related to  other things and reviewed, gets well wrought into the mental structure.  This is the reason why you should enforce on your pupils habits of  continuous application. There is no moral turpitude in cramming. It  would be the best, because the most economical, mode of study if it led  to the results desired. But it does not, and your older pupils can  readily be made to see the reason why.    It follows also, from what has been said, that _the popular idea that  'the Memory,' in the sense of a general elementary faculty, can be  improved by training, is a great mistake_. Your memory for facts of a  certain class can be improved very much by training in that class of  facts, because the incoming new fact will then find all sorts of  analogues and associates already there, and these will keep it liable to  recall. But other kinds of fact will reap none of that benefit, and,  unless one have been also trained and versed in _their_ class, will be  at the mercy of the mere crude retentiveness of the individual, which,  as we have seen, is practically a fixed quantity. Nevertheless, one  often hears people say: \"A great sin was committed against me in my  youth: my teachers entirely failed to exercise my memory. If they had  only made me learn a lot of things by heart at school, I should not be,  as I am now, forgetful of everything I read and hear.\" This is a great  mistake: learning poetry by heart will make it easier to learn and  remember other poetry, but nothing else; and so of dates; and so of  chemistry and geography.    But, after what I have said, I am sure you will need no farther argument  on this point; and I therefore pass it by.    But, since it has brought me to speak of learning things by heart, I  think that a general practical remark about verbal memorizing may now  not be out of place. The excesses of old-fashioned verbal memorizing,  and the immense advantages of object-teaching in the earlier stages of  culture, have perhaps led those who philosophize about teaching to an  unduly strong reaction; and learning things by heart is now probably  somewhat too much despised. For, when all is said and done, the fact  remains that verbal material is, on the whole, the handiest and most  useful material in which thinking can be carried on. Abstract  conceptions are far and away the most economical instruments of thought,  and abstract conceptions are fixed and incarnated for us in words.  Statistical inquiry would seem to show that, as men advance in life,  they tend to make less and less use of visual images, and more and more  use of words. One of the first things that Mr. Galton discovered was  that this appeared to be the case with the members of the Royal Society  whom he questioned as to their mental images. I should say, therefore,  that constant exercise in verbal memorizing must still be an  indispensable feature in all sound education. Nothing is more  deplorable than that inarticulate and helpless sort of mind that is  reminded by everything of some quotation, case, or anecdote, which it  cannot now exactly recollect. Nothing, on the other hand, is more  convenient to its possessor, or more delightful to his comrades, than a  mind able, in telling a story, to give the exact words of the dialogue  or to furnish a quotation accurate and complete. In every branch of  study there are happily turned, concise, and handy formulas which in an  incomparable way sum up results. The mind that can retain such formulas  is in so far a superior mind, and the communication of them to the pupil  ought always to be one of the teacher's favorite tasks.    In learning 'by heart,' there are, however, efficient and inefficient  methods; and, by making the pupil skilful in the best method, the  teacher can both interest him and abridge the task. The best method is  of course not to 'hammer in' the sentences, by mere reiteration, but to  analyze them, and think. For example, if the pupil should have to learn  this last sentence, let him first strip out its grammatical core, and  learn, \"The best method is not to hammer in, but to analyze,\" and then  add the amplificative and restrictive clauses, bit by bit, thus: \"The  best method is of course not to hammer in _the sentences_, but to  analyze _them and think_.\" Then finally insert the words '_by mere  reiteration_,' and the sentence is complete, and both better understood  and quicker remembered than by a more purely mechanical method.           *       *       *       *       *    In conclusion, I must say a word about the contributions to  our knowledge of memory which have recently come from the  laboratory-psychologists. Many of the enthusiasts for scientific or  brass-instrument child-study are taking accurate measurements of  children's elementary faculties, and among these what we may call  _immediate memory_ admits of easy measurement. All we need do is to  exhibit to the child a series of letters, syllables, figures, pictures,  or what-not, at intervals of one, two, three, or more seconds, or to  sound a similar series of names at the same intervals, within his  hearing, and then see how completely he can reproduce the list, either  directly, or after an interval of ten, twenty, or sixty seconds, or some  longer space of time. According to the results of this exercise, the  pupils may be rated in a memory-scale; and some persons go so far as to  think that the teacher should modify her treatment of the child  according to the strength or feebleness of its faculty as thus made  known.    Now I can only repeat here what I said to you when treating of  attention: man is too complex a being for light to be thrown on his real  efficiency by measuring any one mental faculty taken apart from its  consensus in the working whole. Such an exercise as this, dealing with  incoherent and insipid objects, with no logical connection with each  other, or practical significance outside of the 'test,' is an exercise  the like of which in real life we are hardly ever called upon to  perform. In real life, our memory is always used in the service of some  interest: we remember things which we care for or which are associated  with things we care for; and the child who stands at the bottom of the  scale thus experimentally established might, by dint of the strength of  his passion for a subject, and in consequence of the logical association  into which he weaves the actual materials of his experience, be a very  effective memorizer indeed, and do his school-tasks on the whole much  better than an immediate parrot who might stand at the top of the  'scientifically accurate' list.    This preponderance of interest, of passion, in determining the results  of a human being's working life, obtains throughout. No elementary  measurement, capable of being performed in a laboratory, can throw any  light on the actual efficiency of the subject; for the vital thing about  him, his emotional and moral energy and doggedness, can be measured by  no single experiment, and becomes known only by the total results in the  long run. A blind man like Huber, with his passion for bees and ants,  can observe them through other people's eyes better than these can  through their own. A man born with neither arms nor legs, like the late  Kavanagh, M.P.--and what an icy heart his mother must have had about him  in his babyhood, and how 'negative' would the laboratory-measurements of  his motor-functions have been!--can be an adventurous traveller, an  equestrian and sportsman, and lead an athletic outdoor life. Mr. Romanes  studied the elementary rate of apperception in a large number of persons  by making them read a paragraph as fast as they could take it in, and  then immediately write down all they could reproduce of its contents. He  found astonishing differences in the rapidity, some taking four times as  long as others to absorb the paragraph, and the swiftest readers being,  as a rule, the best immediate recollectors, too. But not,--and this is  my point,--_not_ the most _intellectually capable subjects_, as tested  by the results of what Mr. Romanes rightly names 'genuine' intellectual  work; for he tried the experiment with several highly distinguished men  in science and literature, and most of them turned out to be slow  readers.    In the light of all such facts one may well believe that the total  impression which a perceptive teacher will get of the pupil's condition,  as indicated by his general temper and manner, by the listlessness or  alertness, by the ease or painfulness with which his school work is  done, will be of much more value than those unreal"]]]
