Now, however, that rising party which claimed for the polity  of the Church a celestial origin began to ascribe to her services a new  dignity and importance. It was hinted that, if the established worship  had any fault, that fault was extreme simplicity, and that the Reformers  had, in the heat of their quarrel with Rome, abolished many ancient  ceremonies which might with advantage have been retained. Days and  places were again held in mysterious veneration. Some practices which  had long been disused, and which were commonly regarded as superstitious  mummeries, were revived. Paintings and carvings, which had escaped the  fury of the first generation of Protestants, became the objects of a  respect such as to many seemed idolatrous.    No part of the system of the old Church had been more detested by the  Reformers than the honour paid to celibacy. They held that the doctrine  of Rome on this subject had been prophetically condemned by the apostle  Paul, as a doctrine of devils; and they dwelt much on the crimes and  scandals which seemed to prove the justice of this awful denunciation.  Luther had evinced his own opinion in the clearest manner, by espousing  a nun. Some of the most illustrious bishops and priests who had died by  fire during the reign of Mary had left wives and children. Now, however,  it began to be rumoured that the old monastic spirit had reappeared  in the Church of England; that there was in high quarters a prejudice  against married priests; that even laymen, who called themselves  Protestants, had made resolutions of celibacy which almost amounted  to vows; nay, that a minister of the established religion had set up a  nunnery, in which the psalms were chaunted at midnight, by a company of  virgins dedicated to God. [11]    Nor was this all. A class of questions, as to which the founders of the  Anglican Church and the first generation of Puritans had differed  little or not at all, began to furnish matter for fierce disputes. The  controversies which had divided the Protestant body in its infancy had  related almost exclusively to Church government and to ceremonies. There  had been no serious quarrel between the contending parties on points of  metaphysical theology. The doctrines held by the chiefs of the hierarchy  touching original sin, faith, grace, predestination, and election,  were those which are popularly called Calvinistic. Towards the close of  Elizabeth's reign her favourite prelate, Archbishop Whitgift, drew  up, in concert with the Bishop of London and other theologians, the  celebrated instrument known by the name of the Lambeth Articles. In that  instrument the most startling of the Calvinistic doctrines are affirmed  with a distinctness which would shock many who, in our age, are reputed  Calvinists. One clergyman, who took the opposite side, and spoke harshly  of Calvin, was arraigned for his presumption by the University of  Cambridge, and escaped punishment only by expressing his firm belief in  the tenets of reprobation and final perseverance, and his sorrow for  the offence which he had given to pious men by reflecting on the great  French reformer. The school of divinity of which Hooker was the chief  occupies a middle place between the school of Cranmer and the school of  Laud; and Hooker has, in modern times, been claimed by the Arminians  as an ally. Yet Hooker pronounced Calvin to have been a man superior  in wisdom to any other divine that France had produced, a man to whom  thousands were indebted for the knowledge of divine truth, but who was  himself indebted to God alone. When the Arminian controversy arose  in Holland, the English government and the English Church lent strong  support to the Calvinistic party; nor is the English name altogether  free from the stain which has been left on that party by the  imprisonment of Grocius and the judicial murder of Barneveldt.    But, even before the meeting of the Dutch synod, that part of the  Anglican clergy which was peculiarly hostile to the Calvinistic Church  government and to the Calvinistic worship had begun to regard with  dislike the Calvinistic metaphysics; and this feeling was very naturally  strengthened by the gross injustice, insolence, and cruelty of the party  which was prevalent at Dort. The Arminian doctrine, a doctrine less  austerely logical than that of the early Reformers, but more agreeable  to the popular notions of the divine justice and benevolence, spread  fast and wide. The infection soon reached the court. Opinions which  at the time of the accession of James, no clergyman could have avowed  without imminent risk of being stripped of his gown, were now the best  title to preferment. A divine of that age, who was asked by a simple  country gentleman what the Arminians held, answered, with as much truth  as wit, that they held all the best bishoprics and deaneries in England.    While the majority of the Anglican clergy quitted, in one direction, the  position which they had originally occupied, the majority of the  Puritan body departed, in a direction diametrically opposite, from the  principles and practices of their fathers. The persecution which the  separatists had undergone had been severe enough to irritate, but not  severe enough to destroy. They had been, not tamed into submission, but  baited into savageness and stubborness. After the fashion of oppressed  sects, they mistook their own vindictive feelings for emotions of piety,  encouraged in themselves by reading and meditation, a disposition to  brood over their wrongs, and, when they had worked themselves up into  hating their enemies, imagined that they were only hating the enemies  of heaven. In the New Testament there was little indeed which, even when  perverted by the most disingenuous exposition, could seem to countenance  the indulgence of malevolent passions. But the Old Testament contained  the history of a race selected by God to be witnesses of his unity and  ministers of his vengeance, and specially commanded by him to do many  things which, if done without his special command, would have been  atrocious crimes. In such a history it was not difficult for fierce  and gloomy spirits to find much that might be distorted to suit their  wishes. The extreme Puritans therefore began to feel for the Old  Testament a preference, which, perhaps, they did not distinctly avow  even to themselves; but which showed itself in all their sentiments and  habits. They paid to the Hebrew language a respect which they refused  to that tongue in which the discourses of Jesus and the epistles of Paul  have come down to us. They baptized their children by the names, not of  Christian saints, but of Hebrew patriarchs and warriors. In defiance  of the express and reiterated declarations of Luther and Calvin, they  turned the weekly festival by which the Church had, from the primitive  times, commemorated the resurrection of her Lord, into a Jewish Sabbath.  They sought for principles of jurisprudence in the Mosaic law, and for  precedents to guide their ordinary conduct in the books of Judges  and Kings. Their thoughts and discourse ran much on acts which were  assuredly not recorded as examples for our imitation. The prophet who  hewed in pieces a captive king, the rebel general who gave the blood of  a queen to the dogs, the matron who, in defiance of plighted faith, and  of the laws of eastern hospitality, drove the nail into the brain of the  fugitive ally who had just fed at her board, and who was sleeping under  the shadow of her tent, were proposed as models to Christians suffering  under the tyranny of princes and prelates. Morals and manners were  subjected to a code resembling that of the synagogue, when the synagogue  was in its worst state. The dress, the deportment, the language, the  studies, the amusements of the rigid sect were regulated on principles  not unlike those of the Pharisees who, proud of their washed hands and  broad phylacteries, taunted the Redeemer as a sabbath-breaker and a  winebibber. It was a sin to hang garlands on a Maypole, to drink a  friend's health, to fly a hawk, to hunt a stag, to play at chess, to  wear love-locks, to put starch into a ruff, to touch the virginals,  to read the Fairy Queen. Rules such as these, rules which would have  appeared insupportable to the free and joyous spirit of Luther, and  contemptible to the serene and philosophical intellect of Zwingle, threw  over all life a more than monastic gloom. The learning and eloquence by  which the great Reformers had been eminently distinguished, and to which  they had been, in no small measure, indebted for their success, were  regarded by the new school of Protestants with suspicion, if not with  aversion. Some precisians had scruples about teaching the Latin grammar,  because the names of Mars, Bacchus, and Apollo occurred in it. The  fine arts were all but proscribed. The solemn peal of the organ was  superstitious. The light music of Ben Jonson's masques was dissolute.  Half the fine paintings in England were idolatrous, and the other half  indecent. The extreme Puritan was at once known from other men by his  gait, his garb, his lank hair, the sour solemnity of his face, the  upturned white of his eyes, the nasal twang with which he spoke, and  above all, by his peculiar dialect. He employed, on every occasion, the  imagery and style of Scripture. Hebraisms violently introduced into the  English language, and metaphors borrowed from the boldest lyric poetry  of a remote age and country, and applied to the common concerns of  English life, were the most striking peculiarities of this cant,  which moved, not without cause, the derision both of Prelatists and  libertines.

IT would be interesting to know the exact terms upon which the  Mahrattas engaged to restore the Emperor to his throne in the  palace of Shahjahan. But, since they have even escaped the  research of Captain Grant Duff, who had access to the archives of  Punah, it is hopeless for any one else to think of recovering  them. The emissary employed appears to have been the person of  indifferent character who, like the Brounker and Chiffinch of the  English restoration of 1660, had been usually employed in less  dignified agencies. Unacquainted with this man's name, we must be  content to take note of him by his title of Hissam, or Hashim Ud  Daula. The Mahrattas were, amongst other rewards, to receive a  present fee of ten lakhs of rupees (nominally expressible at  Â£100,000 sterling, but in those days representing as much,  perhaps, as ten times that amount of our present money), nor  would they stir in the matter until they received the sum in hard  cash. It is also probable that the cession of the provinces of  Allahabad and Korah formed part of the recompense they hoped to  receive hereafter.    Though the Emperor, if he guaranteed this latter gift, was  parting from a substance in order to obtain a shadow, yet the  very receipt of that substance by the others depended upon  circumstances over which they had (as the phrase is) no control.  Early in the year 1771 the Emperor had sent to the authorities in  Calcutta, to consult them on his proposed movements; and they had  strongly expressed their disapprobation. But Shujaa-ud-daula, for  reasons of his own, earnestly, though secretly, encouraged the  enterprise. The Emperor set out in the month of May, at the head  of a small but well-appointed army, amongst whom was a body of  sepoys drilled after the European fashion, and commanded by a  Frenchman named Medoc, an illiterate man, but a good soldier. The  command-in-chief was held by Mirza Najaf Khan. A British  detachment, under Major-General Sir Robert Barker, attended him  to the Korah frontier, where the General repeated, for the last  time, the unwelcome dissuasions of his Government. The Emperor  unheedingly moved on, as a ship drives on towards a lee shore;  and the British power closed behind his wake, so that no trace of  him or his Government ever reappeared in the provinces that he  had so inconsiderately left.    From this date two great parties in the Empire are clearly  defined; the Musalmans, anxious to retain (and quarrel over) the  leavings of the great Afghan leader, Ahmad Abdali; and the  Mahrattas, anxious to revenge and repair the losses of Panipat.  The Audh Viceroy acts henceforth for his own hand Â— ready to  benefit by the weakness of whichever party may be worsted; and  the British, with more both of vigour and of moderation, follow a  like course of conduct.    Arrived at Farrukhabad, the Imperial adventurer confirmed the  succession of that petty state to the Bangash chief, whose father  was lately dead, and received at the investiture a fine  (peshkash) of five lakhs of rupees. He then cantoned his army in  the neighbourhood, and awaited the cessation of the periodical  rains. The Mahratta army, some 30,000 strong, was still encamped  at Dehli, but Madhoji Sindhia, the Patel, waited upon the Emperor  in his cantonments, and there concluded whatever was wanting of  the negotiations. The Emperor then proceeded, and entered his  capital on Christmas Day.    At that time of year Dehli enjoys a climate of great loveliness;  and it may be supposed that the unhappy citizens, for their  parts, would put on their most cheerful looks and the best  remnants of their often plundered finery, to greet the return of  their lawful monarch. The spirit of loyalty to persons and to  families is very strong in the East, and we can imagine that, as  the long procession marched from Shahdara and crossed the shrunk  and sandy Jamna, Shah Alam, from the back of his chosen elephant,  looked down upon a scene of hope and gaiety enough to make him  for the moment forget both the cares of the past and the  anxieties of the future, and feel himself at last every inch a  king.    1772. Â— Whatever may have been his mood, his new allies did not  leave him to enjoy it long. Within three weeks of his return to  the palace of his forefathers, he was induced to take the field;  and he set out northward at the head of 90,000 men, the greater  number of whom were Mahratta horsemen. It has already been shown  that Zabita Khan had escaped to his own estates a year before.  The Bawani Mahal (comprising fifty-two pergunnahs, now included  in the districts of Saharanpur and Muzaffarnaggar) contained  three strongholds: Pathargarh on the left, Sukhartal on the right  of the Ganges, and Ghausgarh, near Muzaffarnagar. The first two  had been built by the late minister, Najib-ud-daulah, to protect  the ford which led to his fief in the north-western corner of  Rohilkand, for the Ganges is almost always fordable here, except  in the high floods. The last was the work of Zabita Khan himself,  and its site is still marked by a mosque of large size and fine  proportions. Upon these points the first attacks of the  Imperialists were directed. Ghausgarh was hurriedly evacuated at  their approach to be completely plundered; and Zabita was soon  driven to take refuge in his eastern fort of Pathargarh, nearest  to any aid that the Rohilkand Pathans might be able and willing  to afford. The open country, and minor strongholds and towns were  left to the mercy of the invaders.    Although this campaign was dictated by a Mahratta policy, yet the  small Moghul nucleus bore a certain part, being ably commanded by  the Persian, Mirza Najaf Khan, who has been already mentioned as  Governor of Korah, and of whom we shall hear frequently during  the account of the next ten years.    This nobleman, who bore the title \"Mirza\" in token of belonging  to the late royal family of Persia, evinced the same superiority  over the natives of India which usually characterized the  original immigrants. He had married his sister to a brother of  the former Viceroy, Safdar Jang, and attached himself to the late  unfortunate Governor of Allahabad, Mohammad Kuli Khan, a son of  his brother-in-law (though whether his own nephew or by another  mother does not appear). On the murder of the Governor by his  unscrupulous cousin Shujaa, Najaf Khan succeeded to his place in  the favour of the Emperor, and commanded, as we have seen, the  force which accompanied the Emperor on his restoration.    To the combined armies Zabita opposed a spirited resistance; but  the aid of the Rohilla Afghans (or Pathans, as they are called in  India) was delayed by the menacing attitude of Shujaa; and the  Mahratta and Moghul armies having crossed the Ganges by a mixture  of boldness and stratagem, Zabita Khan fled to the Jat country,  leaving his family and the greater part of the treasures amassed  by his father to fall into the hands of the enemy.    This occasion is especially memorable, because among the children  of Zabita was his eldest son, a beautiful youth, named Gholam  Kadir Khan, whom the Emperor is said, by tradition, to have  transmuted into a haram page, and who lived to exact a fearful  vengeance for any ill-treatment that he may have received.    At the approach of the monsoon the Emperor, dissatisfied at not  receiving the whole of the share of the spoils promised him by  his covetous allies, returned to the metropolis. The Mahrattas  (who even during his presence in the camp had paid him but scanty  respect) now threw off the last shreds of disguise, and  appropriated all the profits of the campaign. They at the same  time restored to Zabita Khan Â— whom they hoped hereafter to make  into a serviceable tool Â— the members of his family taken at  Pathargarh; receiving in exchange a ransom of a lakh and a half  of rupees, which was advanced to them on Zabita's account, by the  Viceroy Shujaa-ud-daulah.    The rainy season of 1772 was spent by the Emperor at Dehli; by  the Mahrattas at Agra and in the neighbourhood. They would  willingly have proceeded to complete the reduction of all  Rohilkand, but that Mirza Najaf flatly refused to join or  sanction such a course; seeing clearly that it must involve a  collision with Shujaa-ud-daulah, who was supported by the British  alliance, and of whose traditional policy the annexation of the  province formed an essential part. The Rohillas, on their part,  occupied themselves in negotiations with the Audh Viceroy, in the  hope of reconstructing the Mohamadan League, which had once been  so successful.    The result of which was a treaty, drawn up under the good offices  of the British general, Sir R. Barker, by which the protector,  Hafiz Rahmat Khan, bound himself to join Shujaa in any steps he  might take for the assistance of Zabita Khan, and pay him forty  lakhs of rupees, in four annual instalments upon condition of the  Mahrattas being expelled from Rohilkand. This treaty, which  proved the ruin of the Rohillas, was executed on the 11th of  July, 1772.    The next step in the destruction of these brave but impolitic  Pathans was the outbreak of several violent quarrels, in which  brother fought against brother and father against son. Zabita  Khan, meanwhile, being secretly urged by the faithless Shujaa,  had made terms for himself with the Mahrattas, who engaged to  procure not only his pardon but his investiture with the office  of Premier Noble, formerly held by his father, Najib-ud-daulah.
