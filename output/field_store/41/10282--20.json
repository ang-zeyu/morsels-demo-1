If your ancestor was buried in a leaden coffin, there will be no  difficulty in finding which it is.\"    Henry seized the light, and proceeding to one of the coffins, which  seemed to be a mass of decay, he pulled away some of the rotted wood  work, and then suddenly exclaimed,--    \"You are quite right. Here is a firm strong leaden coffin within, which,  although quite black, does not otherwise appear to have suffered.\"    \"What is the inscription on that?\" said George.    With difficulty the name on the lid was deciphered, but it was found not  to be the coffin of him whom they sought.    \"We can make short work of this,\" said Marchdale, \"by only examining  those leaden coffins which have lost the plates from off their outer  cases. There do not appear to be many in such a state.\"    He then, with another light, which he lighted from the one that Henry  now carried, commenced actively assisting in the search, which was  carried on silently for more than ten minutes.    Suddenly Mr. Marchdale cried, in a tone of excitement,--    \"I have found it. It is here.\"    They all immediately surrounded the spot where he was, and then he  pointed to the lid of a coffin, which he had been rubbing with his  handkerchief, in order to make the inscription more legible, and said,--    \"See. It is here.\"    By the combined light of the candles they saw the words,--    \"Marmaduke Bannerworth, Yeoman, 1640.\"    \"Yes, there can be no mistake here,\" said Henry. \"This is the coffin,  and it shall be opened.\"    \"I have the iron crowbar here,\" said Marchdale. \"It is an old friend of  mine, and I am accustomed to the use of it. Shall I open the coffin?\"    \"Do so--do so,\" said Henry.    They stood around in silence, while Mr. Marchdale, with much care,  proceeded to open the coffin, which seemed of great thickness, and was  of solid lead.    It was probably the partial rotting of the metal, in consequence of the  damps of that place, that made it easier to open the coffin than it  otherwise would have been, but certain it was that the top came away  remarkably easily. Indeed, so easily did it come off, that another  supposition might have been hazarded, namely, that it had never at all  been effectually fastened.    [Illustration]    The few moments that elapsed were ones of very great suspense to every  one there present; and it would, indeed, be quite sure to assert, that  all the world was for the time forgotten in the absorbing interest which  appertained to the affair which was in progress.    The candles were now both held by Mr. Chillingworth, and they were so  held as to cast a full and clear light upon the coffin. Now the lid slid  off, and Henry eagerly gazed into the interior.    There lay something certainly there, and an audible \"Thank God!\" escaped  his lips.    \"The body is there!\" exclaimed George.    \"All right,\" said Marchdale, \"here it is. There is something, and what  else can it be?\"    \"Hold the lights,\" said Mr. Chillingworth; \"hold the lights, some of  you; let us be quite certain.\"    George took the lights, and Mr. Chillingworth, without any hesitation,  dipped his hands at once into the coffin, and took up some fragments of  rags which were there. They were so rotten, that they fell to pieces in  his grasp, like so many pieces of tinder.    There was a death-like pause for some few moments, and then Mr.  Chillingworth said, in a low voice,--    \"There is not the least vestige of a dead body here.\"    Henry gave a deep groan, as he said,--    \"Mr. Chillingworth, can you take upon yourself to say that no corpse has  undergone the process of decomposition in this coffin?\"    \"To answer your question exactly, as probably in your hurry you have  worded it,\" said Mr. Chillingworth, \"I cannot take upon myself to say  any such thing; but this I can say, namely, that in this coffin there  are no animal remains, and that it is quite impossible that any corpse  enclosed here could, in any lapse of time, have so utterly and entirely  disappeared.\"    \"I am answered,\" said Henry.    \"Good God!\" exclaimed George, \"and has this but added another damning  proof, to those we have already on our minds, of one of the must  dreadful superstitions that ever the mind of man conceived?\"    \"It would seem so,\" said Marchdale, sadly.    \"Oh, that I were dead! This is terrible. God of heaven, why are these  things? Oh, if I were but dead, and so spared the torture of supposing  such things possible.\"    \"Think again, Mr. Chillingworth; I pray you think again,\" cried  Marchdale.    \"If I were to think for the remainder of my existence,\" he replied, \"I  could come to no other conclusion. It is not a matter of opinion; it is  a matter of fact.\"    \"You are positive, then,\" said Henry, \"that the dead body of Marmaduke  Bannerworth is not rested here?\"    \"I am positive. Look for yourselves. The lead is but slightly  discoloured; it looks tolerably clean and fresh; there is not a vestige  of putrefaction--no bones, no dust even.\"    They did all look for themselves, and the most casual glance was  sufficient to satisfy the most sceptical.    \"All is over,\" said Henry; \"let us now leave this place; and all I can  now ask of you, my friends, is to lock this dreadful secret deep in your  own hearts.\"    \"It shall never pass my lips,\" said Marchdale.    \"Nor mine, you may depend,\" said the doctor. \"I was much in hopes that  this night's work would have had the effect of dissipating, instead of  adding to, the gloomy fancies that now possess you.\"    \"Good heavens!\" cried George, \"can you call them fancies, Mr.  Chillingworth?\"    \"I do, indeed.\"    \"Have you yet a doubt?\"    \"My young friend, I told you from the first, that I would not believe in  your vampyre; and I tell you now, that if one was to come and lay hold  of me by the throat, as long as I could at all gasp for breath I would  tell him he was a d----d impostor.\"    \"This is carrying incredulity to the verge of obstinacy.\"    \"Far beyond it, if you please.\"    \"You will not be convinced?\" said Marchdale.    \"I most decidedly, on this point, will not.\"    \"Then you are one who would doubt a miracle, if you saw it with your own  eyes.\"    \"I would, because I do not believe in miracles. I should endeavour to  find some rational and some scientific means of accounting for the  phenomenon, and that's the very reason why we have no miracles  now-a-days, between you and I, and no prophets and saints, and all that  sort of thing.\"    \"I would rather avoid such observations in such a place as this,\" said  Marchdale.    \"Nay, do not be the moral coward,\" cried Mr. Chillingworth, \"to make  your opinions, or the expression of them, dependent upon any certain  locality.\"    \"I know not what to think,\" said Henry; \"I am bewildered quite. Let us  now come away.\"    Mr. Marchdale replaced the lid of the coffin, and then the little party  moved towards the staircase. Henry turned before he ascended, and  glanced back into the vault.    \"Oh,\" he said, \"if I could but think there had been some mistake, some  error of judgment, on which the mind could rest for hope.\"    \"I deeply regret,\" said Marchdale, \"that I so strenuously advised this  expedition. I did hope that from it would have resulted much good.\"    \"And you had every reason so to hope,\" said Chillingworth. \"I advised it  likewise, and I tell you that its result perfectly astonishes me,  although I will not allow myself to embrace at once all the conclusions  to which it would seem to lead me.\"    \"I am satisfied,\" said Henry; \"I know you both advised me for the best.  The curse of Heaven seems now to have fallen upon me and my house.\"    \"Oh, nonsense!\" said Chillingworth. \"What for?\"    \"Alas! I know not.\"    \"Then you may depend that Heaven would never act so oddly. In the first  place, Heaven don't curse anybody; and, in the second, it is too just to  inflict pain where pain is not amply deserved.\"    They ascended the gloomy staircase of the vault. The countenances of  both George and Henry were very much saddened, and it was quite evident  that their thoughts were by far too busy to enable them to enter into  any conversation. They did not, and particularly George, seem to hear  all that was said to them. Their intellects seemed almost stunned by the  unexpected circumstance of the disappearance of the body of their  ancestor.    All along they had, although almost unknown to themselves, felt a sort  of conviction that they must find some remains of Marmaduke Bannerworth,  which would render the supposition, even in the most superstitious  minds, that he was the vampyre, a thing totally and physically  impossible.    But now the whole question assumed a far more bewildering shape. The  body was not in its coffin--it had not there quietly slept the long  sleep of death common to humanity. Where was it then? What had become of  it? Where, how, and under what circumstances had it been removed? Had it  itself burst the bands that held it, and hideously stalked forth into  the world again to make one of its seeming inhabitants, and kept up for  a hundred years a dreadful existence by such adventures as it had  consummated at the hall, where, in the course of ordinary human life, it  had once lived?    All these were questions which irresistibly pressed themselves upon the  consideration of Henry and his brother. They were awful questions.    And yet, take any sober, sane, thinking, educated man, and show him all  that they had seen, subject him to all to which they had been subjected,  and say if human reason, and all the arguments that the subtlest brain  could back it with, would be able to hold out against such a vast  accumulation of horrible evidences, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1484"],[0,"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (#17)"],[1,"atues, and  draperies to equip several other dwellings. Don Marcelo began to  complain of the cramped space in an apartment costing twenty-eight  thousand francs a year--in reality large enough for a family four times  the size of his. He was beginning to deplore being obliged to renounce  some very tempting furniture bargains when a real estate agent smelled  out the foreigner and relieved him of his embarrassment. Why not buy a  castle? . . .    The entire family was delighted with the idea. An historic castle, the  most historic that could be found, would supplement their luxurious  establishment. Chichi paled with pride. Some of her friends had castles.  Others, of old colonial family, who were accustomed to look down upon  her for her country bringing up, would now cry with envy upon learning  of this acquisition which was almost a patent of nobility. The mother  smiled in the hope of months in the country which would recall the  simple and happy life of her youth. Julio was less enthusiastic. The  \"old man\" would expect him to spend much time away from Paris, but he  consoled himself by reflecting that the suburban place would provide  excuse for frequent automobile trips.    Desnoyers thought of the relatives in Berlin. Why should he not have  his castle like the others? . . . The bargains were alluring. Historic  mansions by the dozen were offered him. Their owners, exhausted by  the expense of maintaining them, were more than anxious to sell. So he  bought the castle of Villeblanche-sur-Marne, built in the time of  the religious wars--a mixture of palace and fortress with an Italian  Renaissance facade, gloomy towers with pointed hoods, and moats in which  swans were swimming.    He could now live with some tracts of land over which to exercise his  authority, struggling again with the resistance of men and things.  Besides, the vast proportions of the rooms of the castle were very  tempting and bare of furniture. This opportunity for placing the  overflow from his cellars plunged him again into buying. With this  atmosphere of lordly gloom, the antiques would harmonize beautifully,  without that cry of protest which they always seemed to make when placed  in contact with the glaring white walls of modern habitations. The  historic residence required an endless outlay; on that account it had  changed owners so many times.    But he and the land understood each other beautifully. . . . So at the  same time that he was filling the salons, he was going to begin farming  and stock-raising in the extensive parks--a reproduction in miniature  of his enterprises in South America. The property ought to be made  self-supporting. Not that he had any fear of the expenses, but he did  not intend to lose money on the proposition.    The acquisition of the castle brought Desnoyers a true friendship--the  chief advantage in the transaction. He became acquainted with a  neighbor, Senator Lacour, who twice had been Minister of State, and was  now vegetating in the senate, silent during its sessions, but restless  and voluble in the corridors in order to maintain his influence. He was  a prominent figure of the republican nobility, an aristocrat of the new  regime that had sprung from the agitations of the Revolution, just  as the titled nobility had won their spurs in the Crusades. His  great-grandfather had belonged to the Convention. His father had figured  in the Republic of 1848. He, as the son of an exile who had died in  banishment, had when very young marched behind the grandiloquent figure  of Gambetta, and always spoke in glowing terms of the Master, in the  hope that some of his rays might be reflected on his disciple. His son  Rene, a pupil of the Ecole Centrale regarded his father as \"a rare  old sport,\" laughing a little at his romantic and humanitarian  republicanism. He, nevertheless, was counting much on that same official  protection treasured by four generations of Lacours dedicated to the  service of the Republic, to assist him when he became an engineer.    Don Marcelo who used to look uneasily upon any new friendship, fearing a  demand for a loan, gave himself up with enthusiasm to intimacy with this  \"grand man.\" The personage admired riches and recognized, besides,  a certain genius in this millionaire from the other side of the sea  accustomed to speaking of limitless pastures and immense herds.  Their intercourse was more than the mere friendliness of a country  neighborhood, and continued on after their return to Paris. Finally Rene  visited the home on the avenida Victor Hugo as though it were his own.    The only disappointments in Desnoyers' new life came from his children.  Chichi irritated him because of the independence of her tastes. She did  not like antiques, no matter how substantial and magnificent they might  be, much preferring the frivolities of the latest fashion. She accepted  all her father's gifts with great indifference. Before an exquisite  blonde piece of lace, centuries old, picked up at auction, she made  a wry face, saying, \"I would much rather have had a new dress costing  three hundred francs.\" She and her brother were solidly opposed to  everything old.    Now that his daughter was already a woman, he had confided her  absolutely to the care of Dona Luisa. But the former \"Peoncito\" was not  showing much respect for the advice and commands of the good natured  Creole. She had taken up roller-skating with enthusiasm, regarding it as  the most elegant of diversions. She would go every afternoon to the Ice  Palace, Dona Luisa chaperoning her, although to do this she was obliged  to give up accompanying her husband to his sales. Oh, the hours of  deadly weariness before that frozen oval ring, watching the white circle  of balancing human monkeys gliding by on runners to the sound of an  organ! . . . Her daughter would pass and repass before her tired eyes,  rosy from the exercise, spirals of hair escaped from her hat, streaming  out behind, the folds of her skirt swinging above her skates--handsome,  athletic and Amazonian, with the rude health of a child who, according  to her father, \"had been weaned on beefsteaks.\"    Finally Dona Luisa rebelled against this troublesome vigilance,  preferring to accompany her husband on his hunt for underpriced riches.  Chichi went to the skating rink with one of the dark-skinned maids,  passing the afternoons with her sporty friends of the new world.  Together they ventilated their ideas under the glare of the easy life  of Paris, freed from the scruples and conventions of their native land.  They all thought themselves older than they were, delighting to discover  in each other unsuspected charms. The change from the other hemisphere  had altered their sense of values. Some were even writing verses in  French. And Desnoyers became alarmed, giving free rein to his bad humor,  when Chichi of evenings, would bring forth as aphorisms that which she  and her friends had been discussing, as a summary of their readings and  observations.--\"Life is life, and one must live! . . . I will marry the  man I love, no matter who he may be. . . .\"    But the daughter's independence was as nothing compared to the worry  which the other child gave the Desnoyers. Ay, that other one! . . .  Julio, upon arriving in Paris, had changed the bent of his aspirations.  He no longer thought of becoming an engineer; he wished to become  an artist. Don Marcelo objected in great consternation, but finally  yielded. Let it be painting! The important thing was to have some  regular profession. The father, while he considered property and wealth  as sacred rights, felt that no one should enjoy them who had not worked  to acquire them.    Recalling his apprenticeship as a wood carver, he began to hope that the  artistic instincts which poverty had extinguished in him were, perhaps,  reappearing in his son. What if this lazy boy, this lively genius,  hesitating before taking up his walk in life, should turn out to be  a famous painter, after all! . . . So he agreed to all of Julio's  caprices, the budding artist insisting that for his first efforts in  drawing and coloring, he needed a separate apartment where he could work  with more freedom. His father, therefore, established him near his home,  in the rue de la Pompe in the former studio of a well-known foreign  painter. The workroom and its annexes were far too large for an amateur,  but the owner had died, and Desnoyers improved the opportunity offered  by the heirs, and bought at a remarkable bargain, the entire plant,  pictures and furnishings.    Dona Luisa at first visited the studio daily like a good mother, caring  for the well-being of her son that he may work to better advantage.  Taking off her gloves, she emptied the brass trays filled with cigar  stubs and dusted the furniture powdered with the ashes fallen from the  pipes. Julio's visitors, long-haired young men who spoke of things  that she could not understand, seemed to her rather careless in their  manners. . . . Later on she also met there women, very lightly clad, and  was received with scowls by her son. Wasn't his mother ever going to let  him work in peace? . . . So the poor lady, starting out in the morning  toward the rue de la Pompe, stopped midway and went instead to the  church of Saint Honore d'Eylau.    The father displayed more prudence. A man of his years could not expect  to mingle with the chums of a young artist. In a few months' time, Julio  passed entire weeks without going to sleep under the paternal roof.  Finally he installed himself permanently in his studio, occasionally  making a flying trip home that his family might know that he was still  in existence. . . . Some mornings, Desnoyers would arrive at the rue de  la Pompe in order to ask a few questions of the concierge. It was ten  o'clock; the artist was sleeping. Upon returning at midday, he learned  that the heavy sleep still continued. Soon after lunch, another"]]]
