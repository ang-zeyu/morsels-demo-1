[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19298"],[0,"The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh (#17)"],[1,"is carried forward by  the American believers from the shores of America and is propagated  through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa and of Australasia,  and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself  securely established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion. Then will  all the peoples of the world witness that this community is spiritually  illumined and divinely guided. Then will the whole earth resound with the  praises of its majesty and greatness.\"    It is in the light of these above-quoted words of 'Abdu'l-Baha that every  thoughtful and conscientious believer should ponder the significance of  this momentous utterance of Baha'u'llah: \"In the East the light of His  Revelation hath broken; in the West have appeared the signs of His  dominion. Ponder this in your hearts, O people, and be not of those who  have turned a deaf ear to the admonitions of Him Who is the Almighty, the  All-Praised... Should they attempt to conceal its light on the continent,  it will assuredly rear its head in the midmost heart of the ocean, and,  raising its voice, proclaim: 'I am the life-giver of the world!'\"    Dearly-beloved friends! Can our eyes be so dim as to fail to recognize in  the anguish and turmoil which, greater than in any other country and in a  manner unprecedented in its history, are now afflicting the American  nation, evidences of the beginnings of that spiritual renaissance which  these pregnant words of 'Abdu'l-Baha so clearly foreshadow? The throes and  twinges of agony which the soul of a nation in travail is now beginning to  experience abundantly proclaim it. Contrast the sad plight of the nations  of the earth, and in particular this great Republic of the West, with the  rising fortunes of that handful of its citizens, whose mission, if they be  faithful to their trust, is to heal its wounds, restore its confidence and  revive its shattered hopes. Contrast the dreadful convulsions, the  internecine conflicts, the petty disputes, the outworn controversies, the  interminable revolutions that agitate the masses, with the calm new light  of Peace and of Truth which envelops, guides and sustains those valiant  inheritors of the law and love of Baha'u'llah. Compare the disintegrating  institutions, the discredited statesmanship, the exploded theories, the  appalling degradation, the follies and furies, the shifts, shams and  compromises that characterize the present age, with the steady  consolidation, the holy discipline, the unity and cohesiveness, the  assured conviction, the uncompromising loyalty, the heroic self-sacrifice  that constitute the hallmark of these faithful stewards and harbingers of  the golden age of the Faith of Baha'u'llah.    Small wonder that these prophetic words should have been revealed by  'Abdu'l-Baha: \"The East,\" He assures us, \"hath verily been illumined with  the light of the Kingdom. Ere long will this same light shed a still  greater illumination upon the West. Then will the hearts of its people be  vivified through the potency of the teachings of God and their souls be  set aglow by the undying fire of His love.\" \"The prestige of the Faith of  God,\" He asserts, \"has immensely increased. Its greatness is now manifest.  The day is approaching when it will have cast a tremendous tumult in men's  hearts. Rejoice, therefore, O denizens of America, rejoice with exceeding  gladness!\"    Most prized and best-beloved brethren! As we look back upon the forty  years which have passed since the auspicious rays of the Baha'i Revelation  first warmed and illuminated the American continent we find that they may  well fall into four distinct periods, each culminating in an event of such  significance as to constitute a milestone along the road leading the  American believers towards their promised victory. The first of these four  decades (1893-1903), characterized by a process of slow and steady  fermentation, may be said to have culminated in the historic pilgrimages  undertaken by 'Abdu'l-Baha's American disciples to the shrine of  Baha'u'llah. The ten years which followed (1903-1913), so full of the  tests and trials which agitated, cleansed and energized the body of the  earliest pioneers of the Faith in that land, had as their happy climax  'Abdu'l-Baha's memorable visit to America. The third period (1913-1923), a  period of quiet and uninterrupted consolidation, had as its inevitable  result the birth of that divinely-appointed Administration, the  foundations of which the Will of a departed Master had unmistakably  established. The remaining ten years (1923-1933), distinguished throughout  by further internal development, as well as by a notable expansion of the  international activities of a growing community, witnessed the completion  of the superstructure of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar--the Administration's  mighty bulwark, the symbol of its strength and the sign of its future  glory.    Each of these successive periods would seem to have contributed its  distinct share in enriching the spiritual life of that community, and in  preparing its members for the discharge of the tremendous responsibilities  of their unique mission. The pilgrimages which its foremost  representatives were moved to undertake in that earliest period of its  history fired the souls of its members with a love and zeal which no  amount of adversity could quench. The tests and tribulations it  subsequently suffered enabled those who survived them to obtain a grasp of  the implications of their faith that no opposition, however determined and  well-organized, could ever hope to weaken. The institutions which its  tried and tested adherents later on established furnished their promoters  with that poise and stability which the increase of their numbers and the  ceaseless extension of their activities urgently demanded. And finally the  Temple which the exponents of an already firmly established Administration  were inspired to erect gave them the vision which neither the storms of  internal disorder nor the whirlwinds of international commotion could  possibly obscure.    It would take me too long to attempt even a brief description of the first  stirrings which the introduction of the Baha'i Revelation into the New  World, as conceived, initiated and directed by our beloved Master,  immediately created. Nor does space permit me to narrate the circumstances  attending the epoch-making visit of the first American pilgrims to  Baha'u'llah's hallowed shrine, to relate the deeds which signalized the  return of these bearers of a new-born Gospel to their native country, or  to assess the immediate consequences of their achievements. No word of  mine would suffice to express how instantly the revelation of  'Abdu'l-Baha's hopes, expectations and purpose for an awakened continent,  electrified the minds and hearts of those who were privileged to hear Him,  who were made the recipients of His inestimable blessings and the chosen  repositories of His confidence and trust. I can never hope to interpret  adequately the feelings that surged within those heroic hearts as they sat  at their Master's feet, beneath the shelter of His prison-house, eager to  absorb and intent to preserve the effusions of His divine Wisdom. I can  never pay sufficient tribute to that spirit of unyielding determination  which the impact of a magnetic personality and the spell of a mighty  utterance kindled in the entire company of these returning pilgrims, these  consecrated heralds of the Covenant of God, at so decisive an epoch of  their history. The memory of such names as Lua, Chase, MacNutt, Dealy,  Goodall, Dodge, Farmer and Brittingham--to mention only a few of that  immortal galaxy now gathered to the glory of Baha'u'llah--will for ever  remain associated with the rise and establishment of His Faith in the  American continent, and will continue to shed on its annals a lustre that  time can never dim.    It was through these pilgrimages, as they succeeded one another in the  years immediately following the ascension of Baha'u'llah, that the  splendor of the Covenant, beclouded for a time by the apparent ascendancy  of its Arch-Breaker, emerged triumphant amidst the vicissitudes which had  afflicted it. It was through the arrival of these pilgrims, and these  alone, that the gloom which had enveloped the disconsolate members of  'Abdu'l-Baha's family was finally dispelled. Through the agency of these  successive visitors the Greatest Holy Leaf, who alone with her Brother  among the members of her Father's household had to confront the rebellion  of almost the entire company of her relatives and associates, found that  consolation which so powerfully sustained her till the very close of her  life. By the forces which this little band of returning pilgrims was able  to release in the heart of that continent the death-knell of every scheme  initiated by the would-be wrecker of the Cause of God was sounded.    The Tablets which were subsequently revealed by the untiring pen of  'Abdu'l-Baha, embodying in passionate and unequivocal language His  instructions and counsels, His appeals and comments, His hopes and wishes,  His fears and warnings, soon began to be translated, published and  circulated throughout the length and breadth of the North American  continent, providing the ever-widening circle of the first believers with  that spiritual sustenance which could alone enable them to survive the  severe trials they were soon to experience.    The hour of an unprecedented crisis was, however, inexorably approaching.  Evidences of dissension, actuated by pride and ambition, were beginning to  obscure the radiance and retard the growth of the newly-born community  which the apostolic teachers of that continent had labored to establish.  He who had been instrumental in inaugurating so splendid an era in the  history of the Faith, on whom the Center of Baha'u'llah's Covenant had  conferred the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19300"],[0,"A Traveler's Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the Báb (#17)"],[1,"in all  this We give thanks to God the Lord of the worlds, and We praise Him under  all circumstances: verily He is a witness unto all things.    \"We ask God to extend His shadow,(47) that the unitarians may haste  thereto, and that the sincere may take shelter therein; and to bestow on  [these] servants flowers from the garden of his grace and stars from the  horizon of his favors; and to assist him in that which he liketh and  approveth; and to help him unto that which shall bring him near to the  Dayspring of His Most Comely Names, that he may not shut his eyes to the  wrong which he seeth, but may regard his subjects with the eye of favor  and preserve them from violence. And we ask Him (exalted is He) to make  thee a helper unto His religion and a regarder of His justice, that thou  mayest rule over [His] servants as thou rulest over those of thy kindred,  and mayest choose for them what thou wouldest choose for thyself. Verily  He is the Potent, the Exalted, the Protecting, the Self-Subsistent.\"    Now since suitable occasion hath arisen it hath been considered  appropriate that some of the precepts of Baha'u'llah which are contained  in tracts and epistles should also be inserted briefly in this treatise,  so that the main principles and practice and [their] foundations and basis  may become clear and apparent. And these texts have been copied from  numerous tracts.    Amongst them [is this]: \"Consort with [people of all] religions with  spirituality and fragrance.... Beware lest the zeal of ignorance possess  you amongst mankind. All originated from God and returneth unto Him:  verily He is the Source of creation and the Goal of the worlds.\"    And amongst them [is this]: \"Ye are forbidden sedition and strife in the  books and epistles; and herein I desire naught save your exaltation and  elevation, whereunto beareth witness the heaven and its stars, the sun and  its radiance, the trees and their leaves, the seas and their waves, and  the earth and its treasures. We ask God to continue His saints and  strengthen them unto that which befitteth them in this blessed, precious,  and wondrous station, and We ask Him to assist those who surround Me to  act according to that whereunto they have been commanded on the part of  the Supreme Pen.\"    And amongst them [is this]: \"The fairest tree of knowledge is this sublime  word: 'Ye are all the fruit of one tree and the leaves of one branch.'  Pride is not for him who loves his country, but for him who loves the  [whole] world.\"    And amongst them [is this]: \"Verily he who educateth his son, or one of  the sons [of another], it is as though he educated one of My sons. Upon  him be the splendor of God, and His grace, and His mercy which preceded  the worlds.\"    Amongst them [is this]: \"O people of Baha! Ye have been and are the  dawnings of affection and the daysprings of divine grace: defile not the  tongue with cursing or execration of anyone, and guard the eye from that  which is not seemly. Show forth that which ye have: if it be accepted, the  object is attained; if not, interference is vain: leave him to himself,  [while] advancing toward God, the Protecting, the Self-Subsistent. Be not  a cause of grief, much less of strife and sedition. It is hoped that ye  will be nurtured in the shade of the lote-tree of Divine Grace, and  practice that which God desireth. Ye are all leaves of one tree and drops  of one sea.\"    Amongst them [is this]: \"The faith of God and religion of God hath been  revealed and manifested from the heaven of the Will of the King of  Preexistence only for the union and concord of the dwellers upon earth:  make it not a cause of discord and dissension. The principal means and  chief instrument for [bringing about] the appearance and irradiance of the  luminary of concord is the religion of God and the Law of the Lord; while  the growth of the world, the education of the nations, and the peace and  comfort of those in all lands are through the divine ordinances and  decrees. This is the principal means for this most great gift; it giveth  the cup of life, bestoweth everlasting life, and conferreth eternal  blessedness. The chiefs of the earth, especially the exemplars of divine  justice, must make strenuous efforts to guard this state and to upraise  and preserve it. So likewise that which is necessary is inquiry into the  condition of the people, and cognizance of the deeds and circumstances of  each one of the different classes. We desire of the exemplars of God's  power, namely of kings and chiefs, that they will make endeavor: perchance  discord may depart out of [their] midst, and the horizons may be illumined  with the light of concord. All must hold to that which floweth from the  Pen of Reminder, and practice it. God witnesseth and [all] the atoms of  existences testify that we have mentioned that which will be the cause of  the exaltation, elevation, education, preservation, and reformation of the  dwellers upon earth. We desire of God that He will strengthen [His]  servants. That which this Oppressed One seeketh of all is justice and  fairness: let them not be satisfied with listening; let them ponder on  what hath become manifest from this Oppressed One. I swear by the Sun of  Revelation, which hath shone forth from the horizon of the heaven of the  Kingdom of the Merciful One, that, if any [other] expositor or speaker had  been beheld, I would not have made Myself an object for the malevolence  and the calumnies of mankind.\" Finis.    By these sentences a clue to the principles, ideas, line of conduct,  behavior, and intentions of this sect is placed in the hand; whereas if we  seek to become acquainted with the truth of this matter through the  accounts and stories which are in the mouths of men, the truth will be  entirely concealed and hidden by reason of their manifold differences and  contrariety. It is therefore best to discover the principles and objects  of this sect from the contents of their teachings, tracts, and epistles.  There is no authority nor are there any proofs or texts superior to these,  for this is the foundation of foundations and the ultimate criterion. One  cannot judge of the generality by the speech or action of individuals, for  diversity of states is one of the peculiarities and concomitants of the  human race.    At all events, in the beginning of the year one thousand two hundred and  eighty-five [A.H.] they transferred Baha'u'llah and all those persons who  were with Him from Adrianople to the prison of Akka, and Mirza Yahya to  the fortress of Famagusta, and there they remained.(48) But in Persia  after a while sundry persons who were discerning in matters, notable for  wise policy, and aware and cognizant of the truth of the earlier and later  events, made representation before the presence of His Majesty the King  saying, \"What has hitherto been reported, related, asserted, and alleged  concerning this sect in the Royal Presence was either an exaggeration, or  else [the speakers] fabricated statements with a view to [their own]  individual designs and the attainment of personal advantages. If so be  that His Majesty the King will investigate matters in his own noble  person, it is believed that it will become clear before his presence that  this sect have no worldly object nor any concern with political matters.  The fulcrum of their motion and rest and the pivot of their cast and  conduct is restricted to spiritual things and confined to matters of  conscience; it has nothing to do with the affairs of government nor any  concern with the powers of the throne; its principles are the withdrawal  of veils, the verification of signs, the education of souls, the  reformation of characters, the purification of hearts, and illumination  with the gleams of enlightenment. That which befits the kingly dignity and  beseems the world-ordering diadem is this, that all subjects of every  class and creed should be the objects of bounty, and [should abide] in the  utmost tranquility and prosperity under the wide shadow of the King's  justice. For the divine shadow is the refuge of all the dwellers upon  earth and the asylum of all mankind; it is not limited to one party. In  particular, the true nature and real doctrine of this sect have [now]  become evident and well known: all their writings and tracts have  repeatedly and frequently fallen into [our] hands, and are to be found  preserved in the possession of the government. If they be perused, the  actual truth and inward verity will become clear and apparent. These pages  are entirely taken up with prohibitions of sedition, [recommendations of]  upright conduct amongst mankind, obedience, submission, loyalty,  conformity, and acquisition of laudable qualities, and encouragements to  become endowed with praiseworthy accomplishments and characteristics. They  have absolutely no reference to political questions, nor do they treat of  that which could cause disturbance or sedition. Under these circumstances  a just government can [find] no excuse, and possesses no pretext [for  further persecuting this sect] except [a claim to the right of]  interference in thought and conscience, which are the private possessions  of the heart and soul. And, as regards this matter, there has [already]  been much interference, and countless efforts have been made. What blood  has been shed! What heads have been hung up! Thousands of persons have  been slain; thousands of women and children have become wanderers or  captives; many are the buildings which have been ruined; and how many  noble races and families have become headless and homeless! Yet naught has  been effected and no advantage has been gained; no remedy has been  discovered for this ill, nor any easy salve for this wound. [To insure]  freedom of conscience and tranquility of heart and soul is one of the  duties and functions of government, and is in all ages the cause of  progress in development and"]]]
