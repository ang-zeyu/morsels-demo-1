Great Colmore Street,  Caroline and Charlotte Streets, Great and Little Charles Streets,  Cregoe, Lionel, and Edmund Streets, all take their names from the same  source.    ~Colonnade.~--This very handsome and (for Birmingham) rather  novel-looking building, was opened Jan. 10, 1883, being erected by Mr.  A. Humpage, at a cost of about L70,000, from the designs of Mr. W.H.  Ward. The Colonnade proper runs round the entire building, giving  frontage to a number of shops, the upper portion of the block being  partly occupied by the Midland Conservative Club, and the rest of the  building, with the basement, fitted up as a Temperance Hotel and  \"Restaurant.\"    ~Comets.~--The inhabitants were very much terrified by the appearance of  a comet in December, 1680. At Michaelmas, 1811, an exceedingly brilliant  comet appeared, supposed to have been the same which was seen at the  birth of Jesus Christ. Donati's comet was first observed June 2, 1858,  but was most brilliant in September and October. The comets of 1861 and  1883 were also visible here.    ~Commissioners.~--The first local governing body of the town, though  with but the merest shadow of power as compared with the Corporation of  to-day, were the Street Commissioners appointed under an Act of Geo.  III. in 1769, their duties being confined almost solely to repairing,  cleansing, and \"enlightening\" the streets of the town, appointing  watchmen, &c., their power of raising funds being limited to 1s. in the  L. By succeeding Acts of 1773, 1801, 1812, and 1828, the powers of the  Commissioners were considerably enlarged, and they must be credited with  the introduction of the first set of local improvement schemes,  including the widening of streets, clearing the Bull Ring of the houses  round St. Martin's Church, making owners lay out proper streets for  building, purchasing the market tolls, building of Town Hall and Market  Hall, regulating carriages, and \"suppressing the smoke nuisance arising  from engines commonly called steam engines,\" &c., and, though they came  in for their full share of obloquy and political rancour, it cannot be  denied they did good and faithful service to the town. The Commissioners  had the power of electing themselves, every vacancy being filled as it  occurred by those who remained, and, as the Act of 1828 increased their  number to no less than 89, perhaps some little excuse may be made for  the would-be leading men of the day who were left out in the cold. Be  that as it may, the Charter of Incorporation put them aside, and gave  their power and authority into the hands of a popularly-elected  representative body. The Commissioners, however, remained as a body in  name until the last day of December, 1851, when, as a token of  remembrance, they presented the town with the ornamental fountain  formerly standing in the centre of the Market Hall, but which has been  removed to Highgate Park. On the transfer of their powers to the  Corporation, the Commissioners handed over a schedule of indebtedness,  showing that there was then due on mortgage of the \"lamp rate,\" of 4 per  cent, L87,350; on the \"Town Hall rate,\" at 4 per cent., L25,000;  annuities, L947 3s. 4d.; besides L7,800, at 5 percent., borrowed by the  Duddeston and Nechells Commissioners, making a total of L121,097 3s. 4d.    ~Commons.~--Handsworth Common was enclosed in 1793. An Act was passed in  1798 for enclosing and allotting the commons and waste land in  Birmingham. The commons and open fields of Erdington and Witton were  enclosed and divided in 1801.    ~Concert Halls, &c.~--The Birmingham Concert Hall, better known as  \"Holder's,\" was built in 1846, though for years previous the house was  noted for its harmonic meetings; the present Hall has seats for 2,200  persons. Day's Concert Hall was erected in 1862 the opening night,  September 17, being for the benefit of the Queen's Hospital, when L70  was realised therefor; the Hall will accommodate 1,500.--The Museum  Concert Hall was opened Dec. 20, 1863, and will hold about 1,000  people.--A very large building intended for use as a Concert Hall, &c.,  will soon be opened in Snow Hill, to be conducted on temperance  principles.--A series of popular Monday evening concerts was commenced  in the Town Hall, Nov. 12, 1844, and was continued for nearly two  years.--Twopenny weekly \"Concerts for the People\" were started at the  Music Hall, Broad Street (now Prince of Wales' Theatre), March 25, 1847,  but they did not take well.--Threepenny Saturday evening concerts in  Town Hall, were begun in November, 1879.    ~Conferences and Congresses~ of all sorts of people have been held here  from time to time, and a few dates are here annexed:--A Conference of  Wesleyan ministers took place in 1836, in 1844, 1854, 1865, and 1879,  being the 136th meeting of that body. Four hundred Congregational  ministers met in Congress Oct. 5, 1862. A Social Science Congress was  held Sept. 30, 1868. A Trades Union Conference Aug. 23, 1869. National  Education League Conference, Oct. 12, 1869. National Republican  Conference, May 12, 1873. Conference on Sanitary Reform, Jan. 14, 1875.  A Co-operative Societies Conference, July 3, 1875. A Conference of  Christians in Needless Alley, Oct. 27, 1875. The Midland Counties'  Church Defence Associations met in the Exchange, Jan. 18, 1876, and on  the 9th of Feb. the advocates for disestablishing and disendowing the  Church said their say in the Masonic Hall, resolutions in favour of  sharing the loaves and fishes being enthusiastically carried by the good  people who covet not their neighbours' goods. A Domestic Economy  Congress was held July 17, 1877. A Church Conference held sittings Nov.  7, 1877. The friends of International Arbitration met in the Town Hall,  May 2, 1878, when 800 delegates were present, but the swords are not yet  beaten into ploughshares. How to lessen the output of coal was discussed  March 5, 1878, by a Conference of Miners, who not being then able to  settle the question, met again June 17, 1879, to calmly consider the  advisableness of laying idle all the coalpits in the country for a time,  as the best remedy they could find for the continued reduction of wages.  The 18th Annual Conference of the British Association of Gas Managers  was held here June 14, 1881, when about 500 of those gentlemen attended.  A considerable amount of gassy talk anent the wonderful future naturally  arose, and an endowment fund of L323 was banked to provide a medal for  \"any originality in connection with the manufacture and application of  gas,\" but the Gas Committee of Birmingham, without any vast improvement  in the manufacture, still keep to _their_ original idea of sharing  profits with ratepayers, handing over L25,000 each year to the Borough  rates. On Bank Holiday, August 6, 1883, a Conference of Bakers took  place here, and at the same date the 49th \"High Court\" of Foresters  assembled at the Town Hall, their last visit having been in 1849.    ~Conservative Associations~ have been in existence for at least fifty  years, as the formation of one in December, 1834, is mentioned in the  papers of the period. The present one, which is formed on a somewhat  similar plan to that of the Liberal Association, and consists of 300  representatives chosen from the wards, held its first meeting May 18,  1877. Associations of a like nature have been formed in most of the  wards, and in Balsall Heath, Moseley, Aston, Handsworth, and all the  suburbs and places around.    ~Constables.~--In 1776 it was necessary to have as many as 25 constables  sworn in to protect the farmers coming to the weekly market.--See also  \"_Police_.\"    ~Consuls.~--There are Consulates here for the following countries (for  addresses see _Directory_):--Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chili, France,  Germany, Greece, Liberia, Portugal, Spain and Italy, Turkey, United  States, United States of Columbia, and Uruguay.    ~Convents.~--See \"_Religious Institutions_.\"    ~Co-operative Societies~ at one time were put in the same category as  Chartist, Socialist, and Communistic Associations, all banned alike.  Nevertheless, in the old \"Reform days\" the theory of co-operation was  most enthusiastically taken up by the workers of this town, even more so  than in any other place in the kingdom. As early as 1828 several  attempts had been made to form such societies, but the one which  appeared the most likely to succeed was the so-called \"Labour Exchange,\"  situated in the old Coach Yard, in Bull Street, formed on the basis so  eloquently and perseveringly advocated by Robert Owen. The principle of  this Exchange was to value all goods brought in at the cost of the raw  material, plus the labour and work bestowed thereon, the said labour  being calculated at the uniform rate of 6d. per hour. On the reception  of the goods \"notes\" to the value were given which could be handed over  as equivalent for any other articles there on sale, and for a time this  rather crude plan was successful. Sharp customers, however found that by  giving in an advanced valuation of their own goods they could by using  their \"notes\" procure others on which a handsome profit was to be made  outside the Labour Mart, and this ultimately brought the Exchange to  grief. Mr. William Pare and Mr. George Jacob Holyoake, were foremost  among the advocates of Co-operation at the period, and a most  interesting history of \"Co-operation in England\" has been written by the  latter gentleman. Other societies were also in operation from time to  time, the longest-lived being the \"Economic Provision Company,\" which  was commenced at Handsworth in 1830 by some of the workers at Soho and  Soho Foundry, 139 of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14473"],[0,"Birds of Guernsey (1879) (#17)"],[1,"k. There are two specimens, a male and  female, in the Museum, but no date as to time of their occurrence.      87. SWIFT. _Cypselus apus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Martinet de  Muraille.\"--The Swift is a tolerably numerous summer visitant to all the  Islands, but I think most numerous in Sark, where hundreds of these  birds may be seen flying about the Coupee, amongst the rocks of which  place and Little Sark they breed in considerable numbers. Mr. MacCulloch  and Mr. Gallienne appear to think the Swift rare in Guernsey, as Mr  Gallienne says in his remarks on Professor Ansted's list, \"The swift  appears here (Guernsey) in very small numbers, but is abundant in Sark;\"  and Mr. MacCulloch writes me word, \"I consider the Swift very rare in  Guernsey.\" I certainly cannot quite agree with this, as I have found  them by no means uncommon, though certainly rather locally distributed  in Guernsey. One afternoon this summer (1878) Mr. Howard Saunders and I  counted forty within sight at one time about the Gull Cliff, near the  old deserted house now known as Victor Hugo's house, as he has  immortalised it by describing it in his 'Travailleurs de la Mer.' The  Swifts use this and two similar houses not very far off for breeding  purposes, a good many nesting in them, and others, as in Sark, amongst  the cliffs. Young Le Cheminant had a few Swifts' eggs in his small  collection, probably taken from this very house, as the Swift is  certainly, as Mr. MacCulloch says, rare in other parts of Guernsey. In  Alderney the Swift is tolerably common, and a good many pairs were  breeding about Scott's Hotel when I was there this year (1878). Probably  a good many Swifts visit the Islands, especially Alderney, for a short  time on migration, principally in the autumn, as once when I was  crossing from Weymouth to Guernsey, on the 18th of August, I saw a large  flock of Swifts just starting on their migratory flight; they were  plodding steadily on against a stormy southerly breeze, spread out like  a line of skirmishers, not very high, but at a good distance apart;  there was none of the wild dashing about and screeching which one  usually connects with the flight of the Swift, but a steady  business-like flight; they went a little to the eastward of our course  in the steamer, and this would have brought them to land in Alderney or  Cape la Hague.    Professor Ansted included the Swift in his list, but oddly enough,  considering the remark of Mr. Gallienne above quoted, marks it as only  occurring in Guernsey. There is no specimen at present in the Museum.      88. SWALLOW, _Hirundo rustica_, Linnaeus. French, \"Hirondelle de  Cheminee.\"--According to Metivier's 'Dictionary,' \"Aronde\" is the local  Guernsey-French name of the Swallow, which is a common summer visitant  to all the Islands, and very generally distributed over the whole of  them, and not having particular favourite habitations as the Martin has.  It arrives and departs much about the same time that it does in England,  except that I do not remember ever to have seen any laggers quite so  late as some of those in England. A few migratory flocks probably rest  for a short time in the Islands before continuing their journey north or  south, as the case may be; the earliest arrivals and the latest laggers  belong to such migratory flocks, the regular summer residents probably  not arriving quite so soon, and departing a little before those that pay  a passing visit; consequently the number of residents does not appear at  any time to be materially increased by such wandering flocks.    Professor Ansted includes the Swallow in his list, but only marks it as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There is no specimen of any of the  Hirundines in the Museum.      89. MARTIN. _Chelidon urbica_, Linnaeus. French, \"Hirondelle de  fenetre.\"--The House Martin is much more local than the Swallow, but  still a numerous summer visitant, like the Swallow, arriving and  departing about the same time that it does in England. It is spread over  all the Islands, but confined to certain spots in each; in Guernsey the  outskirts of the town about Candie Road, and the rocks in Fermain and  Petit Bo Bay, seem very favourite nesting-places. In Alderney there were  a great many nests about Scott's Hotel and a few more in the town, but I  did not see any about the cliffs as at Fermain and Petit Bo in Guernsey.    Professor Ansted includes it in his list, but only marks it as occurring  in Guernsey and Sark.      90. SAND MARTIN. _Cotyle riparia_, Linnaeus. French, \"Hirondelle de  rivage.\"--When I first made out my list of Guernsey birds I had omitted  the Sand Martin altogether, as I had never seen it in the Islands, but  Mr. MacCulloch wrote to me to say, \"Amongst the swallows you have not  noticed the Sand Martin, which is our earliest visitant in this family  and by no means uncommon.\" In consequence of this note, as soon as I got  to the Island this year (1878), in June, I went everywhere I could think  likely to look for Sand Martins, but nowhere could I find that the Sand  Martins had taken possession of a breeding-station. Knowing from my own  experience here that Sand Martins are fond of digging their nest-holes  in the heads of quarries, (I had quite forty nest-holes in my quarry  this year, and forty pairs of Sand Martins inhabiting them), I kept a  bright look-out in all the stone-quarries in the Vale, and they are very  numerous, but I did not see a single Sand Martin's hole or a single pair  of birds anywhere; and it appeared to me that the sandy earth forming  the head was not deep enough before reaching the granite to admit of the  Sand Martins making their holes; and they do not appear to me to have  fixed upon any other sort of breeding place in the Island; neither could  Mr. MacCulloch point one out to me; so I suppose we must consider the  Sand Martin as only a spring visitant to this Island, not remaining to  breed. The same seems to me to be the case in Alderney, as Captain  Hubbach writes to tell me he \"saw some Sand Martins about the quarry  here (in Alderney), for two or three days at the beginning of April, but  cannot say whether they remained here to breed or not.\" I suppose they  continued their journey, as I did not see any when there in June; I have  not seen any in Sark or either of the other small Islands.    Professor Ansted includes the Sand Martin in his list, and marks it as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark.      91. WOOD PIGEON. _Columba palumbus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Colombe  ramier.\"--The Wood Pigeon is resident and breeds in several places in  Guernsey; but fortunately for the Guernsey Farmers, who may  congratulate themselves on the fact, the Wood Pigeons do not breed in  very great numbers. I may mention the trees in the New Ground, Candie  Garden, the Vallon and Woodlands, as places where Wood Pigeons  occasionally breed. No doubt the number of Wood Pigeons is occasionally  increased by migratory, or rather perhaps wandering, flocks, as Mr.  Couch, in a note to the 'Zoologist,' dated October the 21st, 1871, says,  \"On Tuesday a great number of Wood Pigeons rested and several were  shot.\" Mr. MacCulloch also writes me, \"The Wood Pigeon occasionally  arrives in large numbers. A few years ago I heard great complaints of  the damage they were doing to the peas;\"[15] but luckily for the farmers  these wandering flocks do not stay long, or there would be but little  peas, beans, or grain left in the Islands; and the Wood Pigeons would be  more destructive to the crops in Guernsey than in England, as there are  not many acorns or Beech masts on which they could feed; consequently  they would live almost entirely on the farmer; and to show the damage  they would be capable of doing in this case, I may say that in the crops  of two that I examined some time ago--not killed in Guernsey however--I  found, in the first, thirty seven beech-masts in the crop, and eight  others in the gizzard, sufficiently whole to be counted; and in the  crop of the other the astonishing number of seventy-seven beech-masts  and one large acorn; the gizzard of this one I did not examine. I only  mention this to show the damage a few Wood Pigeons would do supposing  they were restricted almost entirely to agricultural produce for their  food, as they would be in Guernsey if they lived there in any great  numbers.    The Wood Pigeon is mentioned by Professor Ansted and marked as only  occurring in Guernsey, and probably as far as breeding is concerned this  is right (of course with the exception of Jersey); but wandering flocks  probably occasionally visit Alderney as well. There is no specimen in  the Museum.      92. ROCK DOVE. _Columba livia_, Linnaeus. French, \"Colombe biset.\"--I  have never seen the Rock Dove in any of the Islands, though there are  many places in all of them that would suit its habits well; and Mr.  MacCulloch writes to me to say, \"I have heard that in times past the  Rock Pigeon used to breed in large numbers in the caves around Sark\";  but this certainly is not the case at present. Captain Hubbach also  writes to me from Alderney, \"There were some Rock Doves here in the  winters of 1862 and 1863; I shot two or three of them then.\" Probably a  few yet remain in both Alderney and Sark, though they certainly are not  at all numerous in either island.    Professor Ansted includes the Rock Dove in his list, and marks it as  occurring in Guernsey and Sark. There is no specimen in the Museum.  Professor Ansted also includes the Stock Dove, _Columba aenas_,  Linnaeus, in his list as occurring in Guernsey and Sark; but I think he  must have done so on insufficient evidence, as I have never seen it and  not been able to gain any information about it; neither does Mr.  Gallienne say anything about it in his notes appended to the list; so on  the whole I think it better to omit it in my list; but as it may occur  at any time, especially as it is certainly increasing considerably in  "]]]
