As we did with water, so  we can with carbonic acid--take the two parts asunder. The simplest and  quickest way is to act upon the carbonic acid by a substance that can  attract the oxygen from it, and leave the carbon behind. You recollect  that I took potassium and put it upon water or ice, and you saw that it  could take the oxygen from the hydrogen. Now, suppose we do something of  the same kind here with this carbonic acid. You know carbonic acid to be a  heavy gas. I will not test it with lime-water, as that will interfere with  our subsequent experiments; but I think the heaviness of the gas and the  power of extinguishing flame will be sufficient for our purpose. I  introduce a flame into the gas, and you will see whether it will be put  out. You see the light is extinguished. Indeed, the gas may, perhaps, put  out phosphorus, which, you know, has a pretty strong combustion. Here is a  piece of phosphorus heated to a high degree. I introduce it into gas, and  you observe the light is put out; but it will take fire again in the air,  because there it re-enters into combustion. Now, let me take a piece of  potassium, a substance which, even at common temperatures, can act upon  carbonic acid, though not sufficiently for our present purpose, because it  soon gets covered with a protecting coat; but if we warm it up to the  burning point in air, as we have a fair right to do, and as we have done  with phosphorus, you will see that it can burn in carbonic acid; and if it  burns, it will burn by taking oxygen, so that you will see what is left  behind. I am going, then, to burn this potassium in the carbonic acid, as  a proof of the existence of oxygen in the carbonic acid. [In the  preliminary process of heating, the potassium exploded.] Sometimes we get  an awkward piece of potassium that explodes, or something like it, when it  burns. I will take another piece; and now that it is heated, I introduce  it into the jar, and you perceive that it burns in the carbonic acid--not  so well as in the air, because the carbonic acid contains the oxygen  combined; but it does burn, and takes away the oxygen. If I now put this  potassium into water, I find that, besides the potash formed (which you  need not trouble about), there is a quantity of carbon produced. I have  here made the experiment in a very rough way; but I assure you that if I  were to make it carefully, devoting a day to it, instead of five minutes,  we should get all the proper amount of charcoal left in the spoon, or in  the place where the potassium was burned, so that there could be no doubt  as to the result. Here, then, is the carbon obtained from the carbonic  acid, as a common black substance; so that you have the entire proof of  the nature of carbonic acid as consisting of carbon and oxygen. And now, I  may tell you, that _whenever_ carbon burns under common circumstances, it  produces carbonic acid.    Suppose I take this piece of wood, and put it into a bottle with  lime-water. I might shake that lime-water up with wood and the atmosphere  as long as I pleased, it would still remain clear as you see it; but  suppose I burn the piece of wood in the air of that bottle. You, of  course, know I get water. Do I get carbonic acid? [The experiment was  performed.] There it is, you see--that is to say, the carbonate lime,  which results from carbonic acid, and that carbonic acid must be formed  from the carbon which comes from the wood, from the candle, or any other  thing.  Indeed, you have yourselves frequently tried a very pretty  experiment, by which you may see the carbon in wood. If you take a piece  of wood, and partly burn it, and then blow it out, you have carbon left.  There are things that do not shew carbon in this way. A candle does not  shew it, but it contains carbon. Here also is a jar of coal-gas, which  produces carbonic acid abundantly. You do not see the carbon, but we can  soon shew it to you. I will light it, and as long as there is any gas in  this cylinder it will go on burning. You see no carbon, but you see a  flame; and because that is bright, it will lead you to guess that there is  carbon in the flame. But I will shew it to you by another process. I have  some of the same gas in another vessel, mixed with a body that will burn  the hydrogen of the gas, but will not burn the carbon. I will light them  with a burning taper, and you perceive the hydrogen is consumed, but not  the carbon, which is left behind as a dense black smoke. I hope that by  these three or four experiments you will learn to see when carbon is  present, and understand what are the products of combustion, when gas or  other bodies are thoroughly burned in the air.    Before we leave the subject of carbon, let us make a few experiments and  remarks upon its wonderful condition as respects ordinary combustion. I  have shewn you that the carbon in burning burns only as a solid body, and  yet you perceive that, after it is burned, it ceases to be a solid. There  are very few fuels that act like this. It is, in fact, only that great  source of fuel, the carbonaceous series, the coals, charcoals, and woods,  that can do it. I do not know that there is any other elementary substance  besides carbon that burns with these conditions; and if it had not been  so, what would happen to us? Suppose all fuel had been like iron, which,  when it burns, burns into a solid substance. We could not then have such a  combustion as you have in this fire-place. Here also is another kind of  fuel which burns very well--as well as, if not better, than carbon--so  well, indeed, as to take fire of itself when it is in the air, as you see  [breaking a tube full of lead pyrophorus]. This substance is lead, and you  see how wonderfully combustible it is. It is very much divided, and is  like a heap of coals in the fireplace; the air can get to its surface and  inside, and so it burns. But why does it not burn in that way now, when it  is lying in a mass? [emptying the contents of the tube in a heap on to a  plate of iron]. Simply because the air cannot get to it. Though it can  produce a great heat, the great heat which we want in our furnaces and  under our boilers, still that which is produced cannot get away from the  portion which remains unburned underneath, and that portion, therefore, is  prevented from coming in contact with the atmosphere, and cannot be  consumed. How different is that from carbon. Carbon burns just in the same  way as this lead does, and so gives an intense fire in the furnace, or  wherever you choose to burn it; but then the body produced by its  combustion passes away, and the remaining carbon is left clear. I shewed  you how carbon went on dissolving in the oxygen, leaving no ash; whereas  here [pointing to the heap of pyrophorus] we have actually more ash than  fuel, for it is heavier by the amount of the oxygen which has united with  it. Thus you see the difference between carbon and lead or iron: if we  choose iron, which gives so wonderful a result in our application of this  fuel, either as light or heat. If, when the carbon burnt, the product went  off as a solid body, you would have had the room filled with an opaque  substance, as in the case of the phosphorus; but when carbon burns,  everything passes up into the atmosphere. It is in a fixed, almost  unchangeable condition before the combustion; but afterwards it is in the  form of gas, which it is very difficult (though we have succeeded) to  produce in a solid or a liquid state.    Now, I must take you to a very interesting part of our subject--to the  relation between the combustion of a candle and that living kind of  combustion which goes on within us. In every one of us there is a living  process of combustion going on very similar to that of a candle; and I  must try to make that plain to you. For it is not merely true in a  poetical sense--the relation of the life of man to a taper; and if you  will follow, I think I can make this clear. In order to make the relation  very plain, I have devised a little apparatus which we can soon build up  before you. Here is a board and a groove cut in it, and I can close the  groove at the top part by a little cover. I can then continue the groove  as a channel by a glass tube at each end, there being a free passage  through the whole. Suppose I take a taper or candle (we can now be liberal  in our use of the word \"candle,\" since we understand what it means), and  place it in one of the tubes; it will go on, you see, burning very well.  You observe that the air which feeds the flame passes down the tube at one  end, then goes along the horizontal tube, and ascends the tube at the  other end in which the taper is placed.    [Illustration: Fig. 32]    If I stop the aperture through which the air enters, I stop combustion, as  you perceive. I stop the supply of air, and consequently the candle goes  out. But, now, what will you think of this fact? In a former experiment I  shewed you the air going from one burning candle to a second candle. If I  took the air proceeding from another candle, and sent it down by a  complicated arrangement into this tube, I should put this burning candle  out. But what will you say when I tell you that my breath will put out  that candle? I do not mean by blowing at all, but simply that the nature  of my breath is such that a candle cannot burn in it. I will now hold my  mouth over the aperture, and without blowing the flame in any way, let no  air enter the tube but what comes from my mouth. You see the result. I did  not blow the candle out. I merely let the air which I expired pass into  the aperture, and the result was that the light went out for want of  oxygen, and for no other reason. Something or other--namely, my lungs--had  taken away the oxygen from the air, and there was no more to supply the  combustion of the candle. It is, I think, very pretty to see the time it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14499"],[0,"The Religions of India (#17)"],[1,"; in the first book they  are born of the flood (in the sky).[106] They are sons of Dyaus, but  this, too, only in the last and first books, while in the latter they  are separated once, so that only one is called the Son of the  Sky.[107] They follow Dawn 'like men' (VIII. 5. 2) and are in  Brahmanic literature the 'youngest of the gods.'[108]    The twin gods are the physicians of heaven, while to men they bring  all medicines and help in times of danger. They were apparently at  first only 'wonder-workers,' for the original legends seem to have  been few. Yet the striking similarity in these aspects with the  brothers of Helen must offset the fact that so much in connection with  them seems to have been added in books one and ten. They restore the  blind and decrepit, impart strength and speed, and give the power and  seed of life; even causing waters to flow, fire to burn, and trees to  grow. As such they assist lovers and aid in producing offspring.    The Acvins are brilliantly described, Their bird-drawn chariot and all  its appurtenances are of gold; they are swift as thought, agile,  young, and beautiful. Thrice they come to the sacrifice, morning,  noon, and eve; at the yoking of their car, the dawn is born. When the  'banner before dawn' appears, the invocation to the Acvins begins;  they 'accompany dawn.' Some variation of fancy is naturally to be  looked for. Thus, though, as said above, Dawn is born at the Acvins  yoking, yet Dawn is herself invoked to wake the Acvins; while again  the sun starts their chariot before Dawn; and as sons of Zeus they are  invoked \"when darkness still stands among the shining clouds  (cows).\"[109]    Husbands or brothers or children of Dawn, the Horsemen are also  S[=u]ry[=a]'s husbands, and she is the sun's daughter (Dawn?) or the  sun as female. But this myth is not without contradictions, for  S[=u]ry[=a] elsewhere weds Soma, and the Acvins are the bridegroom's  friends; whom P[=u]shan chose on this occasion as his parents; he who  (unless one with Soma) was the prior bridegroom of the same  much-married damsel.[110]    The current explanation of the Acvins is that they represent two  periods between darkness and dawn, the darker period being nearer  night, the other nearer day. But they probably, as inseparable twins,  are the twinlights or twilight, before dawn, half dark and half  bright. In this light it may well be said of them that one alone is  the son of bright Dyaus, that both wed Dawn, or are her brothers. They  always come together. Their duality represents, then, not successive  stages but one stage in day's approach, when light is dark and dark is  light. In comparing the Acvins to other pairs[111] this dual nature is  frequently referred to; but no less is there a triality in connection  with them which often in describing them has been ignored. This is  that threefold light which opens day; and, as in many cases they join  with Dawn, so their color is inseparable. Strictly speaking, the break  of red is the dawn and the white and yellow lights precede this[112].  Thus in V. 73. 5: \"Red birds flew round you as S[=u]ry[=a] stepped  upon your chariot\"; so that it is quite impossible, in accordance with  the poets themselves, to limit the Acvins to the twilight. They are a  variegated growth from a black and white seed. The chief function of  the Acvins, as originally conceived, was the finding and restoring of  vanished light. Hence they are invoked as finders and aid-gods in  general (the myths are given in Myriantheus).    Some very amusing and some silly legends have been collected and told  by the Vedic poets in regard to the preservation and resuscitating  power of the Acvins--how an old man was rejuvenated by them (this is  also done by the three Ribhus, master-workmen of the gods); how brides  are provided by them; how they rescued Bhujyu and others from the  dangers of the deep (as in the classical legends); how they replaced a  woman's leg with an iron one; restored a saint's eye-sight; drew a  seer out of a well, etc, etc. Many scholars follow Bergaigne in  imagining all these miracles to be anthropomorphized forms of solar  phenomena, the healing of the blind representing the bringing out of  the sun from darkness, etc. To us such interpretation often seems  fatuous. No less unconvincing is the claim that one of the Acvins  represents the fire of heaven and the other the fire of the altar. The  Twins are called _n[=a]saty[=a],_ the 'savers' (or 'not untrue  ones[113]'); explained by some as meaning 'gods with good noses[114].'      HYMN TO THE HORSEMEN.    Whether ye rest on far-extended earth, or on the sea in house upon it  made, 'come hither thence, O ye that ride the steeds. If ever for man  ye mix the sacrifice, then notice now the Kanva [poet who sings]. I  call upon the gods [Indra, Vishnu[115]] and the swift-going  Horsemen[116]. These Horsemen I call now that they work wonders, to  seize the works (of sacrifice), whose friendship is preeminently ours,  and relationship among all the gods; in reference to whom arise  sacrifices ... If, to-day, O Horsemen, West or East ye stand, ye of  good steeds, whether at Druhyu's, Anu's, Turvaca's, or Yadu's, I call  ye; come to me. If ye fly in the air, O givers of great joy; or if  through the two worlds; or if, according to your pleasure, ye mount  the car,--thence come hither, O Horsemen.    From the hymn preceding this, the following verses[117]:         Whatever manliness is in the aether, in the sky, and among       the five peoples, grant us that, O Horsemen ... this hot       _soma_-drink of yours with laudation is poured out; this       _soma_ sweet through which ye discovered Vritra ... Ascend       the swift-rolling chariot, O Horsemen; hither let these my       praises bring ye, like a cloud ... Come as guardians of       homes; guardians of our bodies. Come to the house for (to       give) children and offspring. Whether ye ride on the same       car with Indra, or be in the same house with the Wind;       whether united with the Sons of Boundlessness or the Ribhus,       or stand on Vishnu's wide steps (come to us). This is the       best help of the horsemen, if to-day I should entice them to       get booty, or call them as my strength to conquer in       battle.... Whatever medicine (ye have) far or near, with       this now, O wise ones, grant protection.... Awake, O Dawn,       the Horsemen, goddess, kind and great.... When, O Dawn, thou       goest in light and shinest with the Sun, then hither comes       the Horsemen's chariot, to the house men have to protect.       When the swollen _soma_-stalks are milked like cows with       udders, and when the choric songs are sung, then they that       adore the Horsemen are preeminent....    Here the Acvins are associated with Indra, and even find the evil  demon; but, probably, at this stage Indra is more than god of storms.    Some of the expanded myths and legends of the Acvins may be found in  i. 118, 119, 158; x. 40. Here follows one with legends in moderate  number (vii. 71):      Before the Dawn her sister, Night, withdraweth;    The black one leaves the ruddy one a pathway.    Ye that have kine and horses, you invoke we;    By day, at night, keep far from us your arrow.      Come hither, now, and meet the pious mortal,    And on your car, O Horsemen, bring him good things;    Keep off from us the dry destroying sickness,    By day, at night, O sweetest pair, protect us.      Your chariot may the joy-desiring chargers,    The virile stallions, bring at Dawn's first coming;    That car whose reins are rays, and wealth upon it;    Come with the steeds that keep the season's order.      Upon the car, three-seated, full of riches,    The helping car, that has a path all golden,    On this approach, O lords of heroes, true ones,    Let this food-bringing car of yours approach us.      Ye freed from his old age the man Cyav[=a]na;    Ye brought and gave the charger swift to Pedu;    Ye two from darkness' anguish rescued Atri;    Ye set J[a=]husha down, released from fetters.[118]      This prayer, O Horsemen, and this song is uttered;    Accept the skilful[sic] poem, manly heroes.    These prayers, to you belonging, have ascended,    O all ye gods protect us aye with blessings![119]    The sweets which the Acvins bring are either on their chariot, or, as  is often related, in a bag; or they burst forth from the hoof of their  steed. Pegasus' spring in Helicon has been compared with this. Their  vehicles are variously pictured as birds, horses, ships, etc. It is to  be noticed that in no one of their attributes are the Acvins unique.  Other gods bring sweets, help, protect, give offspring, give healing  medicines, and, in short, do all that the Acvins do. But, as Bergaigne  points out, they do all this pacifically, while Indra, who performs  some of their wonders, does so by storm. He protects by not injuring,  and helps by destroying foes. Yet is this again true only in general,  and the lines between warlike, peaceful, and 'sovereign' gods are  often crossed.           *       *       *       *       *           FOOTNOTES:         [Footnote 1: Such for instance as the hymn to the Acvins,       RV. ii. 39.
