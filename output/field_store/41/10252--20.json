The cord broke in his fingers, but he thrust at the bell with his hand,  and again called aloud.    \"Upon an harp and an instrument of ten strings ... let Heaven and Earth  praise Thy Name!...\"    He continued to call aloud, and to beat on the bronze-rusted bell.    _\"Ship ahoy! What ship's that?\"_    One would have said that a veritable hail had come out of the mists; but  Abel Keeling knew those hails that came out of the mists. They came from  ships which were not there. \"Ay, ay, keep a good look-out, and have a  care to your lodemanage,\" he muttered again to his son....    But, as sometimes a sleeper sits up in his dream, or rises from his couch  and walks, so all of a sudden Abel Keeling found himself on his hands and  knees on the deck, looking back over his shoulder. In some deep-seated  region of his consciousness he was dimly aware that the cant of the deck  had become more perilous, but his brain received the intelligence and  forgot it again. He was looking out into the bright and baffling mists.  The buckler of the sun was of a more ardent silver; the sea below it was  lost in brilliant evaporation; and between them, suspended in the haze,  no more substantial than the vague darknesses that float before dazzled  eyes, a pyramidal phantom-shape hung. Abel Keeling passed his hand over  his eyes, but when he removed it the shape was still there, gliding  slowly towards the _Mary's_ quarter. Its form changed as he watched it.  The spirit-grey shape that had been a pyramid seemed to dissolve into  four upright members, slightly graduated in tallness, that nearest the  _Mary's_ stern the tallest and that to the left the lowest. It might have  been the shadow of the gigantic set of reed-pipes on which that vacant  mournful note had been sounded.    And as he looked, with fooled eyes, again his ears became fooled:    _\"Ahoy there! What ship's that? Are you a ship?... Here, give me that  trumpet--\"_ Then a metallic barking. _\"Ahoy there! What the devil are  you? Didn't you ring a bell? Ring it again, or blow a blast or something,  and go dead slow!\"_    All this came, as it were, indistinctly, and through a sort of high  singing in Abel Keeling's own ears. Then he fancied a short bewildered  laugh, followed by a colloquy from somewhere between sea and sky.    \"Here, Ward, just pinch me, will you? Tell me what you see there. I want  to know if I'm awake.\"    \"See where?\"    \"There, on the starboard bow. (Stop that ventilating fan; I can't  hear myself think.) See anything? Don't tell me it's that damned  Dutchman--don't pitch me that old Vanderdecken tale--give me an easy  one first, something about a sea-serpent.... You did hear that bell,  didn't you?\"    \"Shut up a minute--listen--\"    Again Bligh's voice was lifted up.    _\"This is the cov'nant that I make:    From henceforth nevermore  Will I again the world destroy    With water, as before.\"_    Bligh's voice died away again in Abel Keeling's ears.    \"_Oh--my--fat--Aunt--Julia!_\" the voice that seemed to come from between  sea and sky sounded again. Then it spoke more loudly. \"_I say,_\" it began  with careful politeness, \"_if you are a ship, do you mind telling us  where the masquerade is to be? Our wireless is out of order, and we  hadn't heard of it.... Oh, you do see it, Ward, don't you?... Please,  please tell us what the hell you are!_\"    Again Abel Keeling had moved as a sleepwalker moves. He had raised  himself up by the belfry timbers, and Bligh had sunk in a heap on the  deck. Abel Keeling's movement overturned the pipkin, which raced the  little trickle of its contents down the deck and lodged where the still  and brimming sea made, as it were, a chain with the carved balustrade of  the quarter-deck--one link a still gleaming edge, then a dark baluster,  and then another gleaming link. For one moment only Abel Keeling found  himself noticing that that which had driven Bligh aft had been the  rising of the water in the waist as the galleon settled by the head--the  waist was now entirely submerged; then once more he was absorbed in  his dream, its voices, and its shape in the mist, which had again taken  the form of a pyramid before his eyeballs.    \"_Of course_,\" a voice seemed to be complaining anew, and still through  that confused dinning in Abel Keeling's ears, \"_we can't turn a four-inch  on it.... And, of course, Ward, I don't believe in 'em. D'you hear, Ward?  I don't believe in 'em, I say.... Shall we call down to old A. B.? This  might interest His Scientific Skippership...._\"    \"Oh, lower a boat and pull out to it--into it--over it--through it--\"    \"Look at our chaps crowded on the barbette yonder. They've seen it.  Better not give an order you know won't be obeyed....\"    Abel Keeling, cramped against the antique belfry, had begun to find his  dream interesting. For, though he did not know her build, that mirage was  the shape of a ship. No doubt it was projected from his brooding on ships  of half an hour before; and that was odd.... But perhaps, after all, it  was not very odd. He knew that she did not really exist; only the  appearance of her existed; but things had to exist like that before they  really existed. Before the _Mary of the Tower_ had existed she had been a  shape in some man's imagination; before that, some dreamer had dreamed  the form of a ship with oars; and before that, far away in the dawn and  infancy of the world, some seer had seen in a vision the raft before man  had ventured to push out over the water on his two planks. And since this  shape that rode before Abel Keeling's eyes was a shape in his, Abel  Keeling's dream, he, Abel Keeling, was the master of it. His own brooding  brain had contrived her, and she was launched upon the illimitable ocean  of his own mind....    _\"And I will not unmindful be    Of this, My covenant, passed  Twixt Me and you and every flesh   Whiles that the world should last,\"_    sang Bligh, rapt....    But as a dreamer, even in his dream, will scratch upon the wall by his  couch some key or word to put him in mind of his vision on the morrow  when it has left him, so Abel Keeling found himself seeking some sign to  be a proof to those to whom no vision is vouchsafed. Even Bligh sought  that--could not be silent in his bliss, but lay on the deck there,  uttering great passionate Amens and praising his Maker, as he said, upon  an harp and an instrument of ten strings. So with Abel Keeling. It would  be the Amen of his life to have praised God, not upon a harp, but upon a  ship that should carry her own power, that should store wind or its  equivalent as she stored her victuals, that should be something wrested  from the chaos of uninvention and ordered and disciplined and  subordinated to Abel Keeling's will.... And there she was, that  ship-shaped thing of spirit-grey, with the four pipes that resembled a  phantom organ now broadside and of equal length. And the ghost-crew  of that ship were speaking again....    The interrupted silver chain by the quarterdeck balustrade had now become  continuous, and the balusters made a herring-bone over their own  motionless reflections. The spilt water from the pipkin had dried, and  the pipkin was not to be seen. Abel Keeling stood beside the mast, erect  as God made man to go. With his leathery hand he smote upon the bell. He  waited for the space of a minute, and then cried:    \"Ahoy!... Ship ahoy!... What ship's that?\"      III    We are not conscious in a dream that we are playing a game the beginning  and end of which are in ourselves. In this dream of Abel Keeling's a  voice replied:    \"_Hallo, it's found its tongue.... Ahoy there! What are you?_\"    Loudly and in a clear voice Abel Keeling called: \"Are you a ship?\"    With a nervous giggle the answer came:    \"_We are a ship, aren't we, Ward? I hardly feel sure.... Yes, of course,  we're a ship. No question about us. The question is what the dickens  you are._\"    Not all the words these voices used were intelligible to Abel Keeling,  and he knew not what it was in the tone of these last words that reminded  him of the honour due to the _Mary of the Tower_. Blister-white and at  the end of her life as she was, Abel Keeling was still jealous of her  dignity; the voice had a youngish ring; and it was not fitting that young  chins should be wagged about his galleon. He spoke curtly.    \"You that spoke--are you the master of that ship?\"    \"_Officer of the watch_,\" the words floated back; \"_the captain's  below_.\"    \"Then send for him. It is with masters that masters hold speech,\" Abel  Keeling replied.    He could see the two shapes, flat and without relief, standing on a high  narrow structure with rails. One of them gave a low whistle, and seemed  to be fanning his face; but the other rumbled something into a sort of  funnel. Presently the two shapes became three. There was a murmuring,  as of a consultation, and then suddenly a new voice spoke. At its thrill  and tone a sudden tremor ran through Abel Keeling's frame. He wondered  what response it was that that voice found in the forgotten recesses of  his memory....    \"_Ahoy!_\" seemed to call this new yet faintly remembered voice. \"_What's  all this about? Listen. We're His Majesty's destroyer_ Seapink, _out of  Devonport last October, and nothing particular the matter with us. Now  who are you?_\"    \"The _Mary of the Tower_, out of the Port of Rye on the day of Saint  Anne, and only two men--\"    A gasp interrupted him.    \"_Out of_ WHERE?\" that voice that so strangely moved Abel Keeling said  unsteadily, while Bligh broke into groans of renewed rapture.    \"Out of the Port of Rye, in the County of Sussex ... nay, give ear, else  I cannot make you hear me while this man's spirit and flesh wrestle so  together!... Ahoy! Are you gone?\" For the voices had become a low murmur,  and the ship-shape had faded before Abel "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14209"],[0,"The Kybalion (#17)"],[1,"here. And  the very act of writing, on our part, and the act of reading, on yours,  will affect not only the respective lives of yourself and ourselves, but  will also have a direct, or indirect, affect upon many other people now  living and who will live in the ages to come. Every thought we think,  every act we perform, has its direct and indirect results which fit into  the great chain of Cause and Effect.    We do not wish to enter into a consideration of Free Will, or  Determinism, in this work, for various reasons. Among the many reasons,  is the principal one that neither side of the controversy is entirely  right-in fact, both sides are partially right, according to the Hermetic  Teachings. The Principle of Polarity shows that both are but Half-Truths  the opposing poles of Truth. The Teachings are that a man may be both  Free and yet bound by Necessity, depending upon the meaning of the  terms, and the height of Truth from which the matter is examined. The  ancient writers express the matter thus: \"The further the creation is  from the Centre, the more it is bound; the nearer the Centre it reaches,  the nearer Free is it.\"    The majority of people are more or less the slaves of heredity,  environment, etc., and manifest very little Freedom. They are swayed by  the opinions, customs and thoughts of the outside world, and also by  their emotions, feelings, moods, etc. They manifest no Mastery, worthy  of the name. They indignantly repudiate this assertion, saying, \"Why, I  certainly am free to act and do as I please--I do just what I want to  do,\" but they fail to explain whence arise the \"want to\" and \"as I  please.\" What makes them \"want to\" do one thing in preference to  another; what makes them \"please\" to do this, and not do that? Is there  no \"because\" to their \"pleasing\" and \"Wanting\"? The Master can change  these \"pleases\" and \"wants\" into others at the opposite end of the  mental pole. He is able to \"Will to will,\" instead of to will because  some feeling, mood, emotion, or environmental suggestion arouses a  tendency or desire within him so to do.    The majority of people are carried along like the falling stone,  obedient to environment, outside influences and internal moods, desires,  etc., not to speak of the desires and wills of others stronger than  themselves, heredity, environment, and suggestion, carrying them along  without resistance on their part, or the exercise of the Will. Moved  like the pawns on the checkerboard of life, they play their parts and  are laid aside after the game is over. But the Masters, knowing the  rules of the game, rise above the plane of material life, and placing  themselves in touch with the higher powers of their nature, dominate  their own moods, characters, qualities, and polarity, as well as the  environment surrounding them and thus become Movers in the game, instead  of Pawns-Causes instead of Effects. The Masters do not escape the  Causation of the higher planes, but fall in with the higher laws, and  thus master circumstances on the lower plane. They thus form a conscious  part of the Law, instead of being mere blind instruments. While they  Serve on the Higher Planes, they Rule on the Material Plane.    But, on higher and on lower, the Law is always in operation. There is no  such thing as Chance. The blind goddess has been abolished by Reason. We  are able to see now, with eyes made clear by knowledge, that everything  is governed by Universal Law-that the infinite number of laws are but  manifestations of the One Great Law-the LAW which is THE ALL. It is true  indeed that not a sparrow drops unnoticed by the Mind of THE AL--that  even the hairs on our head are numbered--as the scriptures have said  There is nothing outside of Law; nothing that happens contrary to it.  And yet, do not make the mistake of supposing that Man is but a blind  automaton-far from that. The Hermetic Teachings are that Man may use Law  to overcome laws, and that the higher will always prevail against the  lower, until at last he has reached the stage in which he seeks refuge  in the LAW itself, and laughs the phenomenal laws to scorn. Are you able  to grasp the inner meaning of this?        CHAPTER XIII    GENDER        \"Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine      and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all      planes.\"--The Kybalion.    The great Seventh Hermetic Principle--the Principle of Gender-embodies  the truth that there is Gender manifested in everything-that the  Masculine and Feminine principles are ever present and active in all  phases of phenomena, on each and every plane of life. At this point we  think it well to call your attention to the fact that Gender, in its  Hermetic sense, and Sex in the ordinarily accepted use of the term, are  not the same.    The word \"Gender\" is derived from the Latin root meaning \"to beget; to  procreate; to generate; to create; to produce.\" A moment's consideration  will show you that the word has a much broader and more general meaning  than the term \"Sex,\" the latter referring to the physical distinctions  between male and female living things. Sex is merely a manifestation of  Gender on a certain plane of the Great Physical Plane--the plane of  organic life. We wish to impress this distinction upon your minds, for  the reason that certain writers, who have acquired a smattering of the  Hermetic Philosophy, have sought to identify this Seventh Hermetic  Principle with wild and fanciful, and often reprehensible, theories and  teachings regarding Sex.    The office of Gender is solely that of creating, producing, generating,  etc., and its manifestations are visible on every plane of phenomena. It  is somewhat difficult to produce proofs of this along scientific lines,  for the reason that science has not as yet recognized this Principle as  of universal application. But still some proofs are forthcoming from  scientific sources. In the first place, we find a distinct manifestation  of the Principle of Gender among the corpuscles, ions, or electrons,  which constitute the basis of Matter as science now knows the latter,  and which by forming certain combinations form the Atom, which until  lately was regarded as final and indivisible.    The latest word of science is that the atom is composed of a multitude  of corpuscles, electrons, or ions (the various names being applied by  different authorities) revolving around each other and vibrating at a  high degree and intensity. But the accompanying statement is made that  the formation of the atom is really due to the clustering of negative  corpuscles around a positive one---the positive corpuscles seeming to  exert a certain influence upon the negative corpuscles, causing the  latter to assume certain combinations and thus \"create\" or \"generate\" an  atom. This is in line with the most ancient Hermetic Teachings, which  have always identified the Masculine principle of Gender with the  \"Positive,\" and the Feminine with the \"Negative\" Poles of Electricity  (so called).    Now a word at this point regarding this identification. The public mind  has formed an entirely erroneous impression regarding the qualities of  the so-called \"Negative\" pole of electrified or magnetized Matter. The  terms Positive and Negative are very wrongly applied to this phenomenon  by science. The word Positive means something real and strong, as  compared with a Negative unreality or weakness. Nothing is further from  the real facts of electrical phenomenon. The so-called Negative pole of  the battery is really the pole in and by which the generation or  production of new forms and energies is manifested. There is nothing  \"negative\" about it. The best scientific authorities now use the word  \"Cathode\" in place of \"Negative,\" the word Cathode coming from the Greek  root meaning \"descent; the path of generation, etc,\" From the Cathode  pole emerge the swarm of electrons or corpuscles; from the same pole  emerge those wonderful \"rays\" which have revolutionized scientific  conceptions during the past decade. The Cathode pole is the Mother of  all of the strange phenomena which have rendered useless the old  textbooks, and which have caused many long accepted theories to be  relegated to the scrap-pile of scientific speculation. The Cathode, or  Negative Pole, is the Mother Principle of Electrical Phenomena, and of  the finest forms of matter as yet known to science. So you see we are  justified in refusing to use the term \"Negative\" in our consideration of  the subject, and in insisting upon substituting the word \"Feminine\" for  the old term. The facts of the case bear us out in this, without taking  the Hermetic Teachings into consideration. And so we shall use the word  \"Feminine\" in the place of \"Negative\" in speaking of that pole of  activity.    The latest scientific teachings are that the creative corpuscles or  electrons are Feminine (science says \"they are composed of negative  electricity\"-we say they are composed of Feminine energy). A Feminine  corpuscle becomes detached from, or rather leaves, a Masculine  corpuscle, and starts on a new career. It actively seeks a union with a  Masculine corpuscle, being urged thereto by the natural impulse to  create new forms of Matter or Energy. One writer goes so far as to use  the term \"it at once seeks, of its own volition, a union,\" etc. This  detachment and uniting form the basis of the greater part of the  activities of the chemical world. When the Feminine corpuscle unites  with a Masculine corpuscle, a certain process is begun. The Feminine  particles vibrate rapidly under the influence of the Masculine energy,  and circle rapidly around the latter. The result is the birth of a new  atom. This new atom is really composed of a union of the Masculine and  Feminine electrons, or corpuscles, but when the union is formed the atom  is a separate thing, having certain properties, but no longer  manifesting the property of free"]]]
