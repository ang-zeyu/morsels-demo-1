He was born about 1493, and died about 1540. It is  probable that the place of his birth was Einsiedeln, near Zurich. He  claimed relationship with the noble family of Bombast von Hohenheim;  but some of his biographers doubt whether he really was connected with  that family. His name, or at any rate the name by which he was known,  was Aureolus Philippus Theophrastus Bombast von Hohenheim. His father  in alchemy, Trimethius, Abbot of Spannheim and then of Wurzburg, who  was a theologian, a poet, an astronomer, and a necromancer, named him  _Paracelsus_; this name is taken by some to be a kind of Graeco-Latin  paraphrase of von Hohenheim (of high lineage), and to mean \"belonging  to a lofty place\"; others say it signifies \"greater than Celsus,\" who  was a celebrated Latin writer on medicine of the 1st century.  Paracelsus studied at the University of Basle; but, getting into  trouble with the authorities, he left the university, and for some  years wandered over Europe, supporting himself, according to one  account, by \"psalm-singing, astrological productions, chiromantic  soothsaying, and, it has been said, by necromantic practices.\" He may  have got as far as Constantinople; as a rumour floated about that he  received the Stone of Wisdom from an adept in that city. He returned  to Basle, and in 1527 delivered lectures with the sanction of the  Rector of the university. He made enemies of the physicians by abusing  their custom of seeking knowledge only from ancient writers and not  from nature; he annoyed the apothecaries by calling their tinctures,  decoctions, and extracts, mere _soup-messes_; and he roused the ire of  all learned people by delivering his lectures in German. He was  attacked publicly and also anonymously. Of the pamphlets published  against him he said, \"These vile ribaldries would raise the ire of a  turtle-dove.\" And Paracelsus was no turtle-dove. The following extract  from (a translation of) the preface to _The Book concerning the  Tinctures of the Philosophers written against those Sophists born  since the Deluge_, shews that his style of writing was abusive, and  his opinion of himself, to say the least, not very humble:--      \"From the middle of this age the Monarchy of all the Arts has been    at length derived and conferred on me, Theophrastus Paracelsus,    Prince of Philosophy and Medicine. For this purpose I have been    chosen by God to extinguish and blot out all the phantasies of    elaborate and false works, of delusive and presumptuous words, be    they the words of Aristotle, Galen, Avicenna, Mesva, or the    dogmas of any among their followers. My theory, proceeding as it    does from the light of Nature, can never, through its consistency,    pass away or be changed; but in the fifty-eighth year after its    millennium and a half it will then begin to flourish. The practice    at the same time following upon the theory will be proved by    wonderful and incredible signs, so as to be open to mechanics and    common people, and they will thoroughly understand how firm and    immovable is that Paracelsic Art against the triflings of the    Sophists; though meanwhile that sophistical science has to have    its ineptitude propped up and fortified by papal and imperial    privileges.... So then, you wormy and lousy Sophist, since you    deem the monarch of Arcana a mere ignorant, fatuous, and prodigal    quack, now, in this mid age, I determine in my present treatise to    disclose the honourable course of procedure in these matters, the    virtues and preparation of the celebrated Tincture of the    Philosophers for the use and honour of all who love the truth, and    in order that all who despise the true arts may be reduced to    poverty.\"    The turbulent and restless spirit of Paracelsus brought him into open  conflict with the authorities of Basle. He fled from that town in  1528, and after many wanderings, he found rest at Salzburg, under the  protection of the archbishop. He died at Salzburg in 1541, in his  forty-eighth year.    The character and abilities of Paracelsus have been vastly praised by  some, and inordinately abused by others. One author says of him: \"He  lived like a pig, looked like a drover, found his greatest enjoyment  in the company of the most dissolute and lowest rabble, and throughout  his glorious life he was generally drunk.\" Another author says:  \"Probably no physician has grasped his life's task with a purer  enthusiasm, or devoted himself more faithfully to it, or more fully  maintained the moral worthiness of his calling than did the reformer  of Einsiedeln.\" He certainly seems to have been loved and respected by  his pupils and followers, for he is referred to by them as \"the noble  and beloved monarch,\" \"the German Hemes,\" and \"our dear Preceptor and  King of Arts.\"    There seems no doubt that Paracelsus discovered many facts which  became of great importance in chemistry: he prepared the inflammable  gas we now call hydrogen, by the reaction between iron filings and oil  of vitriol; he distinguished metals from substances which had been  classed with metals but lacked the essential metalline character of  ductility; he made medicinal preparations of mercury, lead and iron,  and introduced many new and powerful drugs, notably laudanum.  Paracelsus insisted that medicine is a branch of chemistry, and that  the restoration of the body of a patient to a condition of chemical  equilibrium is the restoration to health.    Paracelsus trusted in his method; he was endeavouring to substitute  direct appeal to nature for appeal to the authority of writers about  nature. \"After me,\" he cries, \"you Avicenna, Galen, Rhasis, Montagnana  and the others. You after me, not I after you. You of Paris, you of  Montpellier, you of Swabia, of Meissen and Vienna; you who come from  the countries along the Danube and the Rhine; and you, too, from the  Islands of the Ocean. Follow me. It is not for me to follow you, for  mine is the monarchy.\" But the work was too arduous, the struggle too  unequal. \"With few appliances, with no accurate knowledge, with no  help from the work of others, without polished and sharpened weapons,  and without the skill that comes from long handling of instruments of  precision, what could Paracelsus effect in his struggle to wrest her  secrets from nature? Of necessity, he grew weary of the task, and  tried to construct a universe which should be simpler than that most  complex order which refused to yield to his analysis.\" And so he came  back to the universe which man constructs for himself, and exclaimed--      \"Each man has ... all the wisdom and power of the world in    himself; he possesses one kind of knowledge as much as another,    and he who does not find that which is in him cannot truly say    that he does not possess it, but only that he was not capable of    successfully seeking for it.\"    We leave a great genius, with his own words in our ears: \"Have no care  of my misery, reader; let me bear my burden myself. I have two  failings: my poverty and my piety. My poverty was thrown in my face by  a Burgomaster who had perhaps only seen doctors attired in silken  robes, never basking in tattered rags in the sunshine. So it was  decreed I was not a doctor. For my piety I am arraigned by the  parsons, for ... I do not at all love those who teach what they do not  themselves practise.\"          CHAPTER X.    SUMMARY OF THE ALCHEMICAL DOCTRINE.--THE REPLACEMENT OF THE THREE  PRINCIPLES OF THE ALCHEMISTS BY THE SINGLE PRINCIPLE OF PHLOGISTON.      The _Sacred Art_, which had its origin and home in Egypt, was very  definitely associated with the religious rites, and the theological  teaching, recognised by the state. The Egyptian priests were initiated  into the mysteries of the divine art: and as the initiated claimed to  imitate the work of the deity, the priest was regarded by the ordinary  people as something more than a representative, as a mirror, of the  divinity. The sacred art of Egypt was transmuted into alchemy by  contact with European thought and handicrafts, and the tenets and  mysticism of the Catholic Church; and the conception of nature, which  was the result of this blending, prevailed from about the 9th until  towards the end of the 18th century.    Like its predecessor, alchemy postulated an orderly universe; but  alchemy was richer in fantastic details, more picturesquely  embroidered, more prodigal of strange fancies, than the sacred art of  Egypt.    The alchemist constructed his ordered scheme of nature on the basis of  the supposed universality of life. For him, everything lived, and the  life of things was threefold. The alchemist thought he recognised the  manifestation of life in the form, or body, of a thing, in its soul,  and in its spirit. Things might differ much in appearance, in size,  taste, smell, and other outward properties, and yet be intimately  related, because, according to the alchemist, they were produced from  the same principles, they were animated by the same soul. Things might  resemble one another closely in their outward properties and yet  differ widely in essential features, because, according to the  alchemist, they were formed from different elements, in their  spiritual properties they were unlike. The alchemists taught that the  true transformation, in alchemical language the transmutation, of one  thing into another could be effected only by spiritual means acting on  the spirit of the thing, because the transmutation consisted  essentially in raising the substance to the highest perfection whereof  it was capable; the result of this spiritual action might become  apparent in the material form of the substance.

Another attempt made that night called forth  another gun-shot. Yet next day it was seen by the brightness of the  chain that she had come again and vainly tried for hours to cut that  hateful bond.    Such courage and stanch fidelity were bound to win respect, if not  toleration. At any rate, there was no gunner in wait next night, when  all was still. Could it be of any use? Driven off thrice with gun-shots,  would she make another try to feed or free her captive young one?    Would she? Hers was a mother's love. There was but one to watch them  this time, the fourth night, when the quavering whine of the little one  was followed by that shadowy form above the wood-pile.    But carrying no fowl or food that could be seen. Had the keen huntress  failed at last? Had she no head of game for this her only charge, or had  she learned to trust his captors for his food?    No, far from all this. The wild-wood mother's heart and hate were true.  Her only thought had been to set him free. All means she knew she tried,  and every danger braved to tend him well and help him to be free. But  all had failed.    Like a shadow she came and in a moment was gone, and Tip seized on  something dropped, and crunched and chewed with relish what she brought.  But even as he ate, a knife-like pang shot through and a scream of pain  escaped him. Then there was a momentary struggle and the little fox was  dead.    The mother's love was strong in Vix, but a higher thought was stronger.  She knew right well the poison's power; she knew the poison bait, and  would have taught him had he lived to know and shun it too. But now at  last when she must choose for him a wretched prisoner's life or sudden  death, she quenched the mother in her breast and freed him by the one  remaining door.           *       *       *       *       *    It is when the snow is on the ground that we take the census of the  woods, and when the winter came it told me that Vix no longer roamed the  woods of Erindale. Where she went it never told, but only this, that she  was gone.    Gone, perhaps, to some other far-off haunt to leave behind the sad  remembrance of her murdered little ones and mate. Or gone, may be,  deliberately, from the scene of a sorrowful life, as many a wild-wood  mother has gone, by the means that she herself had used to free her  young one, the last of all her brood."]]]
