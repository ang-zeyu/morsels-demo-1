Both the United States of America  and China are traditionally and incurably pacific powers, professing and  practicing an unaggressive policy, and the chief outstanding minor  States are equally concerned in securing a settlement that shall settle.    And moreover, so wide reaching now are all international agreements that  they have not only a claim to intervene juridically, but they have the  much more pressing claim to participate on the ground that no sort of  readjustment of Europe, Western Asia, and Africa can leave their own  futures unaffected. They are wanted not only in the interests of the  belligerent peoples, but for their own sakes and the welfare of the  world all together.      V.    Now a world conference, once it is assembled, can take up certain  questions that no partial treatment can ever hope to meet. The first of  the questions is disarmament. No one who has watched the politics of the  last forty years can doubt the very great share the business and finance  of armament manufacture has played in bringing about the present  horrible killing, and no one who has read accounts of the fighting can  doubt how much this industry has enhanced the torment, cruelty, and  monstrosity of war.    In the old warfare a man was either stabbed, shot, or thrust through  after an hour or so of excitement, and all the wounded on the field were  either comfortably murdered or attended to before the dawn of the next  day. One was killed by human hands, with understandable and tolerable  injuries. But in this war the bulk of the dead--of the western Allies,  at any rate--have been killed by machinery, the wounds have been often  of an inconceivable horribleness, and the fate of the wounded has been  more frightful than was ever the plight of wounded in the hands of  victorious savages. For days multitudes of men have been left mangled,  half buried in mud and filth, or soaked with water, or frozen, crying,  raving between the contending trenches. The number of men that the war,  without actual physical wounds, has shattered mentally and driven insane  because of its noise, its stresses, its strange unnaturalness, is  enormous. Horror in this war has overcome more men than did all the  arrows of Cressy.    Almost all this enhanced terribleness of war is due to the novel  machinery of destruction that science has rendered possible. The  wholesale mangling and destroying of men by implements they have never  seen, without any chance of retaliation, has been its most constant  feature. You cannot open a paper of any date since the war began without  reading of men burned, scalded, and drowned by the bursting of torpedoes  from submarines, of men falling out of the sky from shattered  aeroplanes, of women and children in Antwerp or Paris mutilated  frightfully or torn to ribbons by aerial bombs, of men smashed and  buried alive by shells. An indiscriminate, diabolical violence of  explosives resulting in cruelties for the most part ineffective from the  military point of view is the incessant refrain of this history.    The increased dreadfulness of war due to modern weapons is, however,  only one consequence of their development. The practicability of  aggressive war in settled countries now is entirely dependent on the use  of elaborate artillery on land and warships at sea. Were there only  rifles in the world, were an ordinary rifle the largest kind of gun  permitted, and were ships specifically made for war not so made, then it  would be impossible to invade any country defended by a patriotic and  spirited population with any hopes of success because of the enormous  defensive capacity of entrenched riflemen not subjected to an unhampered  artillery attack.    Modern war is entirely dependent upon equipment of the most costly and  elaborate sort. A general agreement to reduce that equipment would not  only greatly minimize the evil of any war that did break out, but it  would go a long way toward the abolition of war. A community of men  might be unwilling to renounce their right of fighting one another if  occasion arose, but they might still be willing to agree not to carry  arms or to carry arms of a not too lethal sort, to carry pistols instead  of rifles or sticks instead of swords. That, indeed, has been the  history of social amelioration in a number of communities; it has led  straight to a reduction in the number of encounters. So in the same way  the powers of the world might be willing to adopt such a limitation of  armaments, while still retaining the sovereign right of declaring war  in certain eventualities. Under the assurances of a world council  threatening a general intervention, such a partial disarmament would be  greatly facilitated.    And another aspect of disarmament which needs to be taken up and which  only a world congress can take up must be the arming of barbaric or  industrially backward powers by the industrially and artillery forces in  such countries as efficient powers, the creation of navies Turkey,  Servia, Peru, and the like. In Belgium countless Germans were blown to  pieces by German-made guns, Europe arms Mexico against the United  States; China, Africa, Arabia are full of European and American weapons.  It is only the mutual jealousies of the highly organized States that  permit this leakage of power. The tremendous warnings of our war should  serve to temper their foolish hostilities, and now, if ever, is the time  to restrain this insane arming of the less advanced communities.    But before that can be done it is necessary that the manufacture of war  material should cease to be a private industry and a source of profit to  private individuals, that all the invention and enterprise that blossoms  about business should be directed no longer to the steady improvement of  man-killing. It is a preposterous and unanticipated thing that  respectable British gentlemen should be directing magnificently  organized masses of artisans upon the Tyneside in the business of making  weapons that may ultimately smash some of those very artisans to  smithereens.    At the risk of being called \"Utopian\" I would submit that the world is  not so foolish as to allow that sort of thing to go on indefinitely. It  is, indeed, quite a recent human development. All this great business of  armament upon commercial lines is the growth of half a century. But it  has grown with the vigor of an evil weed, it has thrown out a dark  jungle of indirect advertisement, and it has compromised and corrupted  great numbers of investors and financial people. It is perhaps the most  powerful single interest of all those that will fight against the  systematic minimization and abolition of war, and rather than lose his  end it may be necessary for the pacifist to buy out all these concerns,  to insist upon the various States that have sheltered them taking them  over, lock, stock, and barrel, as going businesses.    From what we know of officialism everywhere, the mere transfer will  involve almost at once a decline in their vigor and innovating energy.  It is perhaps fortunate that the very crown of the private armaments  business is the Krupp organization and that its capture and suppression  is a matter of supreme importance to all the allied powers. Russia, with  her huge population, has not as yet developed armament works upon a very  large scale and would probably welcome proposals that minimized the  value of machinery and so enhanced that of men. Beyond this and certain  American plants for the making of rifles and machine guns only British  and French capital is very deeply involved in the armaments trade. The  problem is surely not too difficult for human art and honesty.    It is not being suggested that the making of arms should cease in the  world, but only that in every country it should become a State monopoly  and so completely under Government control. If the State can monopolize  the manufacture and sale of spirits, as Russia has done, if it can,  after the manner of Great Britain, control the making and sale of such a  small, elusive substance as saccharin, it is ridiculous to suppose that  it cannot keep itself fully informed of the existence of such elaborated  machinery as is needed to make a modern rifle barrel. And it demands a  very minimum of alertness, good faith, and good intentions for the  various manufacturing countries to keep each other and the world  generally informed upon the question of the respective military  equipments. From this state of affairs to a definition of a permissible  maximum of strength on land and sea for all the high contracting powers  is an altogether practicable step. Disarmament is not a dream; it is a  thing more practicable than a general hygienic convention and more  easily enforced than custom and excise.    Now none of this really involves the abandonment of armies or uniforms  or national service. Indeed, to a certain extent it restores the  importance of the soldier at the expense of machinery. A world  conference for the suppressing of the peace and the preservation of  armaments would neither interfere with such dear incorrigible squabbles  as that of the orange and green factions in Ireland, (though it might  deprive them of their more deadly weapons,) nor absolutely prohibit war  between adjacent States. It would, however, be a very powerful delaying  force against the outbreak of war, and it would be able to insist with a  quite novel strength upon the observation of the rules of war.    It is no good pretending that mere pacifism will end war; what will end  war, what, indeed, may be ending war at the present time, is  war--against militarism. Force respects itself and no other power.

Lack of villages means lack of roads; this has been one of  the great difficulties to be faced; but, at the same time, the movement  of wagons across country is possible to a far greater extent than in  Flanders, although it is often necessary to use eight or ten horses to  get a gun or wagon to the point desired.    From the military point of view the country is eminently suitable for  troops, with its possibilities of concealment, of producing sudden  surprises with cavalry, and of manoeuvre generally. It is, in fact, the  training ground of the great military centre of Chalons; and French  troops have doubtless been exercised over this ground in every branch of  military operation, except that in which they are engaged at the present  moment.    What commander, training his men over this ground, could have imagined  that the area from Perthes-lez-Hurlus to Beausejour Farm would become  two fortress lines, developed and improved for four months; or that he  would have to carry out an attack modeled on the same system as that  employed in the last great siege undertaken by French troops, that of  Sebastopol in 1855? Yet this is what is being done. Every day an attack  is made on a trench, on the edge of one of the little woods or to gain  ground in one of them; every day the ground gained has to be transformed  so as to give protection to its new occupants and means of access to  their supports; every night, and on many days, the enemy's  counter-attacks have to be repulsed.    Each attack has to be prepared by a violent and accurate artillery fire;  it may be said that a trench has to be morally captured by gun fire  before it can be actually seized by the infantry. Once in the new  trench, the men have to work with their intrenching tools, without  exposing themselves, and wait for a counter-attack, doing what damage  they can to the enemy with hand grenades and machine guns. Thus the  amount of rifle fire is very small; it is a war of explosives and  bayonets.    Looking at the battle at a distance of about 2,000 yards from the  enemy's line, the stillness of what one sees is in marked contrast to  the turmoil of shells passing overhead. The only movement is the cloud  of smoke and earth that marks the burst of a shell. Here and there long  white lines are visible, when a trench has brought the chalky subsoil up  to the top, but the number of trenches seen is very small compared to  the number that exist, for one cannot see into the valleys, and the top  of the ground is an unhealthy place to choose for seating a trench. The  woods are pointed out, with the names given them by the soldiers, but it  needs fieldglasses to see the few stumps that remain in those where the  artillery has done its work. And then a telephone message arrives,  saying that the enemy are threatening a counter-attack at a certain  point, and three minutes later there is a redoubled whistling of shells.  At first one cannot see the result of this fire--the guns are searching  the low ground where the enemy's reserves are preparing for the  movement, but a little later the ground in front of the threatened  trench becomes alive with shell bursts, for the searching has given  place to the building up of a wall of fire through which it is  impossible for the foe to pass without enormous loss.    The attached map may enable us to look more closely at what has been  achieved. The lowest dotted line, numbered 15, is the line of the French  trenches on Feb. 15. They were then close up to the front of the German  line with its network of barbed wire, its machine-gun emplacements,  often of concrete, and its underground chambers for sheltering men from  the shells. Each successive dotted line shows the line held by the  French on the evening of the date written in the dotted line. Thus the  total gain of ground, that between the most southerly and the most  northerly dotted lines, varies between 200 yards, where the lines are  close together northeast of Perthes, and 1,400 yards, half way between  Le Mesnil and Beausejour Farm. But the whole of this space has been a  series of trenches and fortified woods, each of which has had to be  attacked separately.    [Illustration: Map of the French Operations in the Champagne    Some of the severest fighting on the western battle front took place in  this little section of about four miles of trenches, lying between  Rheimes and Verdun. For a whole month from Feb. 15, the attacks were  kept up by the French forces almost continuously, and the sketch gives  the graphic result of changes for three weeks of that time. Ostensibly  the purpose of the French was to pierce the German line and cut the  railway a few miles to the rear. Incidentally, the French aimed to keep  their opponents busy, and thus prevent any reinforcements being sent to  von Hindenburg in the east.    The total gain of ground--that between the most southerly and most  northerly dotted lines--varies from 200 yards northeast of Perthes to  1,400 yards, half way between Le Mesnil and Beausejour Farm. But the  whole of this space has been a series of trenches and fortified woods,  each of which had to be attacked separately.    The letters (A to G) in the sketch indicate the points of the severest  fighting. A (the \"little fort\") was taken and lost three times before  the French finally held it. B saw some of the stiffest encounters, the  Germans attacking the hill nearly every day after the French captured  it, and even the Prussian Guard being put in. The woods at C, D, and E  were centres of terrific combats, in which trenching and mining were  continuous tasks. The redoubt at F was captured only after large losses  on both sides. At the extreme west is still another wood, (G.) which the  French attacked three times before they were successful in getting a  foothold there.]    Some of the points where the fighting has been heaviest are shown in  letters on the map. A is the \"little fort,\" a redoubt on an open spur,  holding perhaps 500 men. This was first attacked in January; it was  partly taken, but the French in the end retained only the southern  corner, where they remained for something like a fortnight. On Feb. 16  it was again taken in part, and lost the same day. On the 17th the same  thing happened. On the 23d they once more got into the work; in the  evening they repulsed five separate counter-attacks; then a sixth  succeeded in turning them out. On the 27th they took all except a bit of  trench in the northern face, and two days later they made that good, as  well as a trench about fifty yards to the north of the work.    B is a small hill, marked 196. The capture of this, with its two lines  of trenches, was one of the most brilliant pieces of work done. Since  this date, the 26th, the enemy have continued to counter-attack nearly  every day. It was here that the Prussian Guard was put in; but they have  failed to get it back, and their losses have been very high. The  prisoners stated that one regiment had its Colonel and all the superior  officers killed or wounded. C is a wood, called the \"Yellow Burnt Wood.\"  It is still in the hands of the Germans, a regular nest of machine guns,  which command the ground not only to the front but also down valleys to  the east and west. The French are just in the southwest corner.    At D there are two woods; the southern we will call No. 3, the northern  No. 4. On the 16th our allies got a trench just south of No. 3; they got  into the wood on the 18th, and fought backward and forward in the wood  that day and all the 19th and 20th; by the evening of the 20th they had  almost reached the northern edge. On the 21st a stronger counter-attack  than usual was repulsed, and in pursuing the retiring enemy they  secured the northern edge. On the 22d there was more fighting in No. 3,  but in the end the French managed to make their way into No. 4 as far as  a trench which runs along a crest midway through the wood. The next six  days saw continuous fighting in No. 4, sometimes near the northern end,  sometimes at the crest in the middle, and occasionally back near the  southern end. The French now hold the northern edge, and have pushed  troops into the \"Square\" wood just north of the line of the 25th.    At E again there are two small woods; these were both captured on the  26th, but the trenches in the northern one had been mined, and the  French had no sooner seized them than they were blown up. At F there was  another small redoubt; part of this was taken on the 19th from the east,  but the work was not finally captured till the 27th, when 240 corpses  were found in it. On the extreme west, at G, is a wood which has twice  been unsuccessfully attacked. On the first occasion troops got into the  wood, but a severe snowstorm prevented the artillery from continuing to  assist them, and they were driven out. The second was an attempt to  surprise the enemy at 2 A.M. on the 25th; this also failed. A third  attack was made on March 7 and was successful; the French line now runs  through the wood.    The above will serve to show the tenacity which is required for an  operation of this kind. Up to the present the French have made steady  and continuous progress, and their success may be best judged from the  fact that they have not been forced back on any day behind the line they  held in the morning, despite innumerable counter-attacks.
