But even  those who were convicted got off with light sentences, and the campaign,  which clearly had powerful aiders and abettors both inside Kolhapur and  outside, was only temporarily checked.    Nor was it to stop at dacoities. A regular semi-military organization  was introduced, and bands of young men used to go out into the country  to carry out mimic manoeuvres. It is of no slight significance that  photographs have been discovered of groups of these young men--some of  whom were subsequently convicted for serious offences--with Tilak  himself in their midst. They were in constant communication with Poona,  and when the Poona extremists began to specialize on bombs they were  amongst the neophytes of the new cult. A conspiracy was hatched of which  the admitted purpose was to murder Colonel Ferris, the Political Agent,  at the wedding of the Maharajah's daughter on March 21, 1908, but, if it  had been carried out successfully, the Maharajah himself and many of his  other guests would almost inevitably have been killed at the same time.  For, as was disclosed in the subsequent trial, a bomb was prepared and  despatched from Poona which was to have been hurled into the wedding  _pandal_ or enclosure railed off in the courtyard of the Palace for the  Maharajah and his family and the principal guests, including Colonel  Ferris. Fortunately the bomb, which was subsequently discovered, did not  reach Kolhapur in time. The conspirators had to fall back upon less  potent weapons. Thanks to the Arms Act, which is one of the favourite  grievances of Indian Nationalism, they had great difficulty in obtaining  arms, but they secured a few, and on April 16, 1908, when Colonel  Ferris, who was retiring, left Kolhapur, some of the conspirators  followed him into the train, and, alighting at one of the stations,  attempted to shoot him, but, again fortunately, their cartridges missed  fire. A few weeks later placards giving formulae for the making of bombs  were actually posted up on the doors of schools and other buildings, and  this was followed by a theft of dangerous chemicals from a Kolhapur  private school. Finally ten youths, nine of whom were Brahmans, were  committed for trial on these offences before a special Sessions Judge,  lent by Government, and eight of them were convicted.    Quite as much as these convictions the downfall of Tilak helped to quell  the forces of unrest in the State of Kolhapur as well as in the rest of  the Deccan. For in Kolhapur, as in Poona, it was the Brahman Press  controlled by Tilak that familiarized the rising generation with the  idea of political murder. In the year which preceded the Kolhapur  conspiracy, and just after the first dastardly bomb outrage at  Muzafferpur to which Mrs. and Miss Kennedy fell victims, an article  appeared in the _Vishvavritta_, a Kolhapur monthly magazine, for which  its editor, Mr. Bijapurkar, a Brahman, who until 1905 had been Professor  of Sanscrit at the Rajaram College, was subsequently prosecuted and  convicted. The article, which was significantly headed \"The potency of  Vedic prayers,\" recalled various cases in which the Vedas lay down the  duty of retaliation upon \"alien\" oppressors. \"To kill such people  involves no sin, and when Kshatriyas and Vaidhyas do not come forward to  kill them, Brahmans should take up arms and protect religion. When one  is face to face with such people they should be slaughtered without  hesitation. Not the slightest blame attaches to the slayer.\" Moreover,  lest these exhortations should be construed merely as a philosophic  treatise on Vedic teaching, the writer was careful to add that \"these  doctrines are not to be kept in books, but must be taught even to babes  and sucklings.\"    Thus in a Native State of the Deccan, just as in British-administered  Deccan, we find the same methods and the same doctrines adopted by the  Brahmans, with the same demoralizing results, in pursuance of the same  purpose, now under one guise and now under another, the maintenance or  restoration of their own theocratic power, whether it be threatened by a  Hindu ruler of their own race, or by \"alien\" rulers and the \"alien\"  civilization for which they stand.          CHAPTER VI.    BENGAL BEFORE THE PARTITION.      It is a far cry in every sense from the Deccan to Bengal. There is a  greater diversity of races, languages, social customs, physical  conditions, &c., between the different provinces of India than is often  to be found between the different countries of Europe. Few differ more  widely than the Deccan and Bengal--the Deccan, a great table-land raised  on an average over 2,000ft. above sea level, broken by many deep-cut  river valleys and throwing up lofty ridges of bare rock, entirely  dependent for its rainfall upon the south-west monsoon, which alone and  in varying degrees of abundancy relieves the thirst of a thin soil  parched during the rest of the year by a fierce dry heat--Bengal, a vast  alluvial plain, with a hot, damp climate, watered and fertilized by  great rivers like the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, which drain the  greater part of the Himalayas. The Deccan is thinly populated; it has no  great waterways; there are few large cities and few natural facilities  of communication between them, but the population, chiefly Mahratta  Hindus, with a fair sprinkling of Mahomedans, survivors of the Moghul  Empire, are a virile race, wiry rather than sturdy, with tenacious  customs and traditions and a language--Marathi--which has a copious  popular literature. Maharashtra, moreover, has historical traditions, by  no means inglorious, of its own. It has played, and is conscious of  having played, a conspicuous part in the history of India down to  relatively recent times; and the Brahmans of Maharashtra, who were once  its rulers, have preserved to the present day the instincts and the  aspirations of a ruling race, combined with great force and subtleness  of intellect. In Bengal, on the other hand, there is a dense population,  concentrated in part in large towns and cities along the great  waterways, but also spread over the whole surface of the rich plains and  deltas. The Bengalees are a quick-witted, imaginative, and warm-hearted  people who have been the victims rather than the makers of history. The  tide of conquest has swept over them again and again from times  immemorial, but generally without leaving any lasting impression upon  their elastic and rather timid temperament. With all his receptive  qualities, his love of novelty and readiness to learn, his retentive  memory, his luxuriant imagination, his gift of facile eloquence, the  Bengalee has seldom shown himself to be a born ruler of men.    All these differences are reflected in the unrest in Bengal, though on  the surface it presents a close resemblance to the unrest in the Deccan,  and there have been constant contact and co-operation between the  leaders. Except as a geographical expression, Bengal is practically a  creation of British rule and of Western education. The claim of the  modern Bengalees to be regarded as a \"nation\" has no historical basis.  The inhabitants of Bengal are of mixed Dravidian, Mongolian, and Aryan  origin, and in no other speech of India, writes Sir H. Risley, is the  literary language cultivated by the educated classes more widely  divorced, not only from the many popular dialects spoken in the  province, but from that of ordinary conversation. Literary Bengalee is  not even an altogether indigenous growth. It owes its birth mainly to  the labours of English missionaries, like Carey, in the first half of  the last century, assisted by the Pundits of Calcutta. Yet it is upon  this community of language that the Bengalees mainly found their claim  to recognition as a \"nation\"; or, to put it in another form, their claim  rests upon education as they understand it--i.e., upon the high  proportion of literacy that exists in Bengal as compared with most parts  of India. Education is unquestionably a power in Bengal. It has not  superseded caste, which in all essentials is still unbroken, but it has  to some extent overshadowed it.    The Brahmans of Bengal have never within historical times been a  politically dominant force. They did not condescend to take office even  in the remote days when there were Hindu Kings in Bengal, and still less  under Mahomedan rule. They were content to be learned in Sanscrit and in  the Hindu Scriptures, and they left secular knowledge to the Kayasthas,  or writer caste, with whom they preserved, notwithstanding certain rigid  barriers, much more intimate relations than usually exist between  different Hindu castes. There is a tradition that the highest Brahman  septs of Bengal are the descendants of five priests of special sanctity  whom King Adisur of Eastern Bengal in the ninth century attracted to his  Court from the holiest centres of Hinduism, and that the servants who  accompanied them founded the septs to which precedence is still accorded  amongst the Kayasthas of Bengal, and both have been at pains to preserve  the purity of their descent by a most exclusive and complicated, and  often unsavoury, system of matrimonial alliances known as Kulinism.  Hence in Bengal the Brahmans share their social primacy to an extent  unknown in other parts of India with the Kayasthas, and also with  another high caste, the Vaidhyas, who formerly monopolized the practice  of Hindu medicine. The _nexus_ is education, and that _nexus_ has been  strengthened since the advent of British rule and of Western education.  When the educational enterprise of the early British missionaries was  followed up, under the impulse of Dr. Duff, the greatest figure in the  missionary annals of India, and of Ram Mohun Roy, the most learned and  earnest of all reforming Brahmans, by the famous Government Minute of  March 7,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16459"],[0,"Musical Memories (#17)"],[1,"saw only its faults. Then she sang  Schumann and Gluck and even Glinka whom she sang in Russian. Nothing was  foreign to her; she was at home everywhere.    She was a great friend of Chopin and she remembered his playing almost  exactly and could give the most valuable directions about the way he  interpreted his works. I learned from her that the great pianist's  (great musician's, rather) execution was much simpler than has been  generally supposed. It was as far removed from any manifestation of bad  taste as it was from cold correctness. She told me the secret of the  true _tempo rubato_ without which Chopin's music is disfigured. It in no  way resembles the dislocations by which it is so often caricatured.    I have spoken of her great talent as a pianist. We saw this one evening  at a concert given by Madame Schumann. After Madame Viardot had sung  some of Schumann's _lieder_ with the great pianist playing the  accompaniments, the two great artists played the illustrious author's  duet for two pianos, which fairly bristles with difficulties, _with  equal virtuosity_.    When Madame Viardot's voice began to break, she was advised to devote  herself to the piano. If she had, she would have found a new career and  a second reputation. But she did not want to make the change, and for  several years she presented the sorry spectacle of genius contending  with adversity. Her voice was broken, stubborn, uneven, and  intermittent. An entire generation knew her only in a guise unworthy of  her.    Her immoderate love of music was the cause of the early modification of  her voice. She wanted to sing everything she liked and she sang  Valentine in _Les Huguenots_, Donna Anna in _Don Juan_, besides other  roles she should never have undertaken if she wanted to preserve her  voice. She came to realize this at the end of her life. \"Don't do as I  did,\" she once told a pupil. \"I wanted to sing everything, and I ruined  my voice.\"    Happy are the fiery natures which burn themselves out and glory in the  sword that wears away the scabbard.          CHAPTER XV    ORPHEE      We know, or, rather we used to know--for we are beginning to forget that  there is an admirable edition of Gluck's principal works. This edition  was due to the interest of an unusual woman, Mlle. Fanny Pelletan, who  devoted a part of her fortune to this real monument and to fulfill a  wish Berlioz expressed in one of his works. Mlle. Pelletan was an  unusually intelligent woman and an accomplished musician, but she needed  some one to help her in this large and formidable task. She was  unassuming and distrusted her own powers, so that she secured as a  collaborator a German musician, named Damcke, who had lived in Paris a  long time and who was highly esteemed. He gave her the moral support she  needed and some bad advice as well, which she felt obliged to follow.  This collaboration accounts for the change of the contralto parts to  counter-tenors. It also accounts for the fact that in every instance the  parts for the clarinets are indicated in C, in this way attributing to  the author a formal intention he never had. Gluck wrote the parts for  the clarinets without bothering whether the player--to whom he left a  freedom of choice and the work of transposition--would use his  instrument in C, B, or A. This method was not peculiar to Gluck. Other  composers used it as well, and traces of it are found even in Auber's  works.    After Damcke's death Mlle. Pelletan got me to help her in this work. I  wanted to change the method, but the edition would have lost its unity  and she would not consent. It was time that Damcke's collaboration  ended. He belonged to the tribe of German professors who have since  become legion. Due to their baneful influence, in a short time, when the  old editions have disappeared, the works of Haydn, Mozart, and  Beethoven, even of Chopin, will be all but unrecognizable. The works of  Sebastian Bach and Handel will be the only ones in existence in their  pristine purity of form, thanks to the admirable editions of the _Bach  und Haendel Gesselschaft_. When Mlle. Pelletan brought me into the work,  the two _Iphigenie_ had been published; _Alceste_ was about to be, and  _Armide_ was ready. In _Armide_ Damcke had been entirely carried away by  his zeal for \"improvements\"--a zeal that can do so much harm. It was  time this was stopped. Not only had he corrected imaginary faults here  and there, but he had also inserted things of his own invention. He had  even gone so far as to re-orchestrate the ballet music, in the naive  belief that he was bringing out the author's real meaning better than he  had done himself. It took an enormous amount of time to undo this  mischief, for I distrusted somewhat my own lights and Mlle. Pelletan had  too high an opinion of Damcke's work and did not dare to override his  judgment.    That excellent woman did not live to see the end of her work. She began  the preparation of Orphee, but she died almost at once. So I was left to  finish the score alone without that valuable experience and masterly  insight by which she solved the most difficult problems. And there were  real enigmas to be solved at every step. The old engraved scores of  Gluck's works reproduced his manuscripts faithfully enough, but they  bore evidence of carelessness and amazing inaccuracy. They are mere  sketches instead of complete scores. Many details are vague and  vagueness is not permissible in a serious edition. It follows that the  different editions of Gluck's works published in the Nineteenth Century,  however sumptuous or careful they may be, are worthless. The Pelletan  edition alone can be consulted with confidence, because we were the only  ones to have all extant and authentic documents in the library at the  Opera to set us right. We had scores copied for actual performances on  the stage and portions of orchestral parts of incalculable value. In  addition, we had no aim or preoccupation in elaborating this material  other than to reconstitute as closely as possible the thought of the  author.           *       *       *       *       *    Switzerland is a country where artistic productions are not unusual.  Every year we have reports of some grandiose performance in which the  people take part themselves. They come from every direction to help,  even from a considerable distance, thanks to the many means of  communication in that delightful land. It is not surprising, therefore,  to learn that a theatre has been built in the pretty town of Mezieres,  near Lusanne, for the performance of the works of a young poet, named  Morax. These works are dramas with choruses, and the surrounding country  furnishes the singers. The work given in 1911 was Allenor--the music by  Gustave Doret--and it was a great success.    Gustave Doret is a real artist and he never for a moment thought of  keeping the Theatre du Jorat for his own exclusive use. He dreamt of  giving Gluck's works in their original form, for they are always altered  and changed according to the fancies or incompetency of the performers  or directors. They formed a large and influential committee and a  substantial guarantee fund was subscribed. Then they gave a brilliant  banquet at which the Princess of Brancovan was present. And Paderewski,  one of the most enthusiastic promotors of the enterprise, delivered an  eloquent address. No one should be surprised at either his zeal or his  eloquence. Paderewski is not only a pianist; he is a man of great  intellect as well,--a great artist who permits himself the luxury of  playing the piano marvellously.    As he knew that I had spent several years in studying Gluck's works  under the microscope, so to speak, Gustave Doret did me the honor to ask  my advice. His choice for the opening work was _Orphee_, which requires  only three principals, Orpheus, Eurydice, and Love. It has become the  custom to add a fourth, a Happy Spirit, but this spirit is one of  Carvalho's inventions and has no reason for existence.    There are, however, two _Orphee_. The first is _Orfeo_ which was written  in Italian, on Calzabigi's text, and was first presented at Venice in  1761. The role of Orpheus in this score was written for a contralto and  was designed for the eunuch Quadagni. The Venetian engravers of that day  were either incompetent or, perhaps, there were none, for the scores of  Gluck's _Alceste_ in Italian and Haydn's _Seasons_ were printed from  type. However that may be the score of _Orfeo_ was engraved in Paris.  The composer Philidor corrected the proofs. He little thought that  _Orfeo_ would ever get so far as Paris, so he appropriated the romanza  in the first act and introduced it with but slight modifications into  his opera-comique _Le Sorcier_. Later on Marie Antoinette called Gluck  to Paris and thus afforded him the opportunity for the complete  development of his genius. After he had written _Iphigenie en Aulide_,  performed in 1774, especially for the Opera, he had the idea of adapting  _Orfeo_ for the French stage. To tell the truth he must have thought of  it before, for _Orphee_ appeared at the Opera only three months after  _Iphigenie_ and it had been entirely rewritten in collaboration with  Moline. The contralto part had been changed to tenor and so the  principal role was given to Legros.    While it may be true that the author improved this work in the French  version, it is not true in every case. There is some question whether  the overture existed in the Italian score. It is generally believed that  it did, but there are old copies of this version in existence and they  begin the opera with the funeral chorus and show no overture at all.  This overture, although the _Mercure de France_ treats it as a  \"beautiful symphonic piece which serves as a good introduction to the  work,\" in reality does not resemble the style of the rest at all. It in  no way prepares for that admirable chorus at the "]]]
