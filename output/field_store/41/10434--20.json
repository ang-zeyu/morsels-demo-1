The friend claps his hands and laughs. His obstreperous mirth frightens  the bird away. She perches on the plantain bower. They follow her there.  Vasantaka finds a picture and shows it to the king, who gives him a  golden bracelet. Looking at it, the king dwells upon the beauties of the  damsel.    Susangata and Sagarika hide themselves behind the plantain trees and  overhear the conversation between the king and his companion. Susangata  remarks, \"You are in luck, girl; your lover is dwelling upon your  praises. The bird, as I told you, has repeated our conversation.\"  Sagarika thinks to herself, \"What will he reply? I hang between life and  death.\" The king remarks farther to his companion, \"My sight insatiate  rests upon her graceful limbs and slender waist. I cannot deny that she  has flatteringly delineated my likeness, nor doubt her sentiments--for  observe the traces of the tear that has fallen upon her work, like the  moist dew that starts from every pore of my frame.\" Sagarika says to  herself, \"Heart, be of good cheer! your passion is directed to a  corresponding object.\" Susangata now comes forward, so as to be seen by  Vasantaka. At this the king, on the advice of his companion, covers the  picture with his mantle. Susangata says, \"I am acquainted with the  secret of the picture and some other matters of which I shall apprise  her Majesty.\" The king takes off his bracelet and other ornaments and  offers them to her with the object of bribing her to be silent. She  replies, \"Your Majesty is bountiful. You need not fear me. I was but in  jest, and do not want these jewels. The truth is, my dear friend,  Sagarika is very angry with me for drawing her picture, and I shall be  much obliged to your Majesty to intercede for me and appease her  resentment.\" The king springs up and exclaims, \"Where is she? Lead me to  her.\"    Then all advance to Sagarika. She thinks, \"He is here--I tremble at his  sight. I can neither stand nor move--what shall I do?\" Vasantaka, seeing  her, exclaims, \"A most surprising damsel, truly; such another is not to  be found in this world. I am confident that when she was created,  _Brahma_ was astonished at his own performance.\" The king is struck with  her and observes, \"such are my impressions. The four mouths of _Brahma_  must at once have exclaimed in concert, bravo, bravo! when the deity  beheld these eyes more beauteous than the leaves of his own lotus; and  his head must have shaken with wonder, as he contemplated her  loveliness, the ornament of all the world.\" Sagarika prepares to go away  when the king addresses her thus, \"You turn your eyes upon your friend  in anger, lovely maid; yet such is their native tenderness that they  cannot assume a harsh expression. Look thus, but do not leave us, for  your departure hence will alone give me pain.\" Susangata now advises the  king to take Sagarika by the hand and pacify her. The king approves the  advice and acts up to it. Vasantaka congratulates the king on his  unprecedented fortune.    The king replies, \"You say rightly--she is the very deity Lakshmi  herself. Her hand is the new shoot of the _Parijata_ tree, else whence  distil these dewdrops of ambrosia?\" Susangata remarks, \"It is not  possible, my dear friend, you can remain inexorable whilst honoured thus  with his Majesty's hand.\"    Sagarika frowns on her friend and asks her to forbear. At this time,  Vasantaka, in testiness of temper, raises a false alarm by proclaiming  that the queen is approaching. The king lets go Sagarika's hand in  alarm. Sagarika and her companion go off hastily behind the _tamala_  tree.    After a short time, the queen approaches the king. By order of the king,  Vasantaka hides the picture quickly under his arm. The king proposes to  visit, in the company of the queen, the Jasmine budded. The queen  declines. Vasantaka takes it as an acknowledgment of defeat on her part  and cries out Huzza! He waves his hand and dances; the picture falls.  Kanchanmala, an attendant of the queen, picks up the picture and shows  it to her mistress. The queen, whose jealousy is excited by the  discovery of the picture, demands an explanation from the king.  Vasantaka volunteers to offer the explanation thus:--\"I was observing,  madam, that it would be very difficult to hit my friend's likeness, on  which his Majesty was pleased to give me this specimen of his skill.\"  The king confirms the explanation. The queen observes, \"And the female  standing near you--I suppose this is a specimen of Vasantaka's skill.\"  The king replies, \"What should you suspect? That is a mere fancy  portrait, the original was never seen before.\" Vasantaka supports the  king thus, \"I will swear to this, by my Brahmanical thread, that the  original was never seen before by either of us.\" Not satisfied with the  explanation, the queen remarks, \"My lord, excuse me. Looking at the  picture has given me a slight headache. I leave you to your amusements.\"    The king observes, \"What can I say to you, dearest? I really am at a  loss. If I ask you to forgive me, that is unnecessary, if you are not  offended; and how can I promise to do so no more, when I have committed  no fault, although you will not believe my assertions?\" The queen,  detaching herself gently and with politeness, takes leave and goes away  with her attendant. Vasantaka remarks, \"Your Majesty has had a lucky  escape. The queen's anger has dispersed like summer clouds.\" The king  observes. \"Away, blockhead, we have no occasion to rejoice; could you  not discover the queen's anger through her unsuccessful attempts to  disguise it? Her face was clouded with a passing frown. As she hung down  her head, she looked on me with an affected smile. She gave utterance to  no angry words, it is true, and the swelling eye glowed not with  rage--but a starting tear was with difficulty repressed; and although  she treated me with politeness, struggling indignation lurked in every  gesture. We must endeavour to pacify her.\"    To insure the vigilance of Kanchanmala, the queen gives her some of her  own clothes and ornaments. With these it is plotted to equip Sagarika as  the queen. A stolen interview between the king and Sagarika, thus  disguised, is arranged to take place at the _Madhava_ bower about  sunset. The queen gets scent of the matter and forestalls Sagarika by  meeting the king at the appointed time and place. The king, mistaking  her for Sagarika, thus speaks his honest self! \"My beloved Sagarika, thy  countenance is radiant as the moon, thy eyes are two lotus buds, thy  hand is the full blown flower, and thy arms, its graceful filaments.  Come thou, whose form is the shrine of ecstasy, come to my arms.\"    The queen throws off her veil and says:--\"Believe me still Sagarika, my  good lord; your heart is so fascinated by her, you fancy you behold  Sagarika in everything.\" The king replies, \"forgive me, dearest.\" The  queen remarks, \"Address not this to me, my lord--the epithet is  another's property.\" The king falls at her feet. The queen observes,  \"Rise, my lord, rise! that wife must be unreasonable indeed, who, with  such evidence of her lord's affection, can presume to be offended. Be  happy, I take my leave.\" She now goes away.    Sagarika, dressed as the queen, goes some way to meet the king when she  thinks of putting an end at once to her sufferings and her life and  fastens the noose round her neck with the fibres of the _Madhavi_. The  king, who is seeking for the queen in hopes to pacify her anger,  discovers Sagarika on the way and mistakes her for the queen. He rushes  to her and tears off the tendril. He soon discovers his mistake,  embraces her and observes, \"When the bosom of my queen swells with  sighs, I express concern; when she is sullen, I soothe her; when her  brows are bent, and her face is distorted with anger, I fall prostrate  at her feet. These marks of respect are due to her exalted position; but  the regard that springs from vehement affection, that is yours alone.\"    At this time, the queen, who has overheard the speech, comes forward and  says, \"I believe you, my lord, I believe you.\" The king explains his  conduct thus:--\"Why, then, you need not be offended. Cannot you perceive  that I have been attracted hither, and misled by the resemblance of your  dress and person? Be composed, I beg you.\" He falls at her feet. She  observes, \"Rise, rise, let not my exalted station put you to such  unnecessary inconvenience.\"    Vasantaka takes up the noose, shows it to the queen and explains his  conduct thus, \"It is very true, madam, I assure you, that, deceived by  the belief that you were attempting to destroy yourself, I brought my  friend to this spot, to preserve, as I thought, your life.\" By order of  the queen, Kanchanmala puts the noose over his neck, beats him and  carries him off an unfortunate captive. The king thinks, \"What an  unlucky business this is! What is to be done? How shall I dissipate the  rage that clouds the smiling countenance of the queen! How rescue  Sagarika from the dread of her resentment, or liberate my friend  Basantaka? I am quite bewildered with these events, and can no longer  command my ideas. I will go in, and endeavour to pacify the queen.\" The  queen regales Vasantaka with cakes from her own fair hands, presents him  with a dress and restores him to liberty. Susangata prays him to accept  a diamond necklace which Sagarika has left with her for presentation to  him. He declines the offer. Looking at it attentively he wonders where  she could have procured such a valuable necklace. They both go to the  king who has gone from the queen's apartments to the crystal alcove and  is lamenting thus:--\"Deceitful vows, tender speeches, plausible excuses  and prostrate supplications had less effect upon the queen's anger than  her own teaks; like water upon the fire they quenched the blaze"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18297"],[0,"The Story of a Summer (#17)"],[1," when she had no male protector  to whom to look for assistance: but then she proved all-sufficient in  herself.  At one time a number of workmen were employed upon the  place--rough, sullen creatures--who used to come to her to receive  their pay; and knowing her, a delicate, sickly woman, to be there  alone, they would often clamor for more wages than they were entitled  to receive, but never could they frighten her into granting it, for  though generous and charitable, nothing was more repugnant to her  feelings than an attempt to take an unfair advantage of her.    Upon one occasion, a man with whom she had had some business  transactions came to claim a payment that was not due him.  Aunt Mary  explained to him that he was not entitled to it, and refused to see him  again.  He returned another day, and she would not allow the door to be  opened.  He then remained outside pulling the bell and thumping for  admittance.  Aunt Mary spoke to him from the balcony above, and  requested him to leave.  He vowed he would not stir without his money,  and tried to coerce her by the most frightful threats and oaths.  \"When  his imprecations were at their highest, Aunt Mary descended, and  throwing open the door, told him to come in; then turning to Gabrielle,  who stood beside her, said:    \"Go upstairs and fetch my pistol off from the bureau.\"    Upon hearing these words the man left very quickly, and never returned  again to annoy her.  In relating this incident to me, Gabrielle said:    \"Of course I knew perfectly well that I would find no pistol upon the  bureau, but I had been too well trained by mamma to show the slightest  surprise, and promptly went upstairs in quest of imaginary firearms.\"    But this exhibition of cool courage paled in contrast with the true  heroism of Aunt Mary displayed at the time of the terrible anti-draft  riots in July, 1863.  Living in the retirement of the woods, she was  not in the habit of going down to the village or associating with the  neighbors; consequently, she was rarely informed upon the local news.  She wondered that no letters or papers had arrived for a day or two,  but merely supposing that some accident upon the road had delayed the  mails, she went about her ordinary occupations, perfectly unconscious  of the peril she was in.  Finally, Mr. Quinby, a Quaker neighbor, came  to the house by a long circuit, and informed her that a mob of about  three hundred men, who had collected from Sing Sing and other parts of  the country, were drinking at the tavern, and threatening to sack  \"Greeley's house,\" and hang the family to the nearest trees.  It was at  the risk of his life that Mr. Quinby had come to warn Aunt Mary, and he  implored her to escape as quickly as possible, and offered to conceal  her and the children in his house.    Aunt Mary did not shriek or fall down in a fainting fit upon learning  that hundreds of desperate men were threatening her life.  Although she  had been very ill and was still weak, perfectly cool and collected, she  considered what was best to be done.  Her husband was in New York, and  of the dozen or so Irish laborers employed upon the place, two or three  had already been seen drinking amicably with the rioters, and the  others, as well as the Irish servant, she feared to trust Clark, the  overseer, a very competent Englishman, was an excellent shot; but what  could one man do against three hundred?  As for saving herself by  deserting her house, Aunt Mary scorned to do it; but immediately  devised a plan that reminds one of the heroism of a Dame Chatelaine of  the Middle Ages.    First of all, the valuables were to be moved, but without exciting the  suspicions of the servant or workmen, as they might inform the rioters.  The men were accordingly sent off to a distant part of the farm to  work, and the maid kept busy, while twelve trunks were lowered into a  wagon standing at the back of the house.  Mr. Quinby immediately  covered them with hay, and drove to his own house, where he stored them  until the trouble should be over, and then sent his son back to help  the family.    To Gabrielle's surprise, her mother and Ida now appeared in very  voluminous and housewifely looking aprons, and were constantly going up  and down stairs.  At last an untimely draught blew Aunt Mary's apron  aside, and Gabrielle, who had not been informed of the danger, caught a  glimpse of the picture of the Archangel Gabriel.  All of the pictures  and pieces of sculpture were then removed to a little hut in the  orchard near the stables, built in the side of a hillock, half under  ground, and quite overgrown by vines; and when both pictures and the  precious books were safely out of the house Aunt Mary felt that she  could breathe.  By that time Clark had returned from Sing Sing, where  he had purchased a large amount of gunpowder by Aunt Mary's direction.  This he arranged in a train from the house to a distant point, and the  preparations were then completed.  When the rioters should come Aunt  Mary was to speak to them from the balcony and warn them to go away,  and in the meantime Mr. Quinby and Clark were to take the children out  of the house by the back window, which was but a step to the top of a  low woodshed, from which they could easily get to the ground.  Then,  while the rioters were storming the barricaded doors, Aunt Mary was to  make her escape, and when she and the children were at a safe distance  a match was to be applied to the gunpowder, blowing up alike house and  rioters.    Mr. Quinby, being a Quaker, had looked on reluctantly while the mine  was being laid, and when he had done all he could to help Aunt Mary, he  returned to the tavern to see the state of affairs there.  He found the  mob still drinking, and uttering horrible threats against the family.  His conscience then obliged him to give the wretches a hint of the doom  that awaited them, ending with these words:    \"Heed my warning, my brethren; Horace Greeley is a peace man, but Mary  Greeley _will_ fight to the last!\"    After dark, the rioters came to the gates and howled, and uttered  threats, but dared not approach very close to the fortress armed by a  sick woman and two children; and when weary of exercising their lungs  went peacefully away.  Meantime, Aunt Mary, being fatigued by the  exertions of the day, laid down, Ida said, when everything was in  readiness to meet the rioters, and slept peacefully till morning.          CHAPTER XII.    Pen Portraits--Lela--Majoli--Guerrabella and Celina--Their  Characteristics.      _July 8_.    While looking over a box of old letters and newspapers this morning I  came across a little sketch descriptive of our quartette, written last  winter for a New York journal.  This sketch, or \"Pen Portraits,\" as it  was styled, veils our identity under fictitious names, the initials  only being preserved, and although it passes over our imperfections and  very much exaggerates our accomplishments, still it contains, I think,  so much that is characteristic that I will preserve it by copying it  into my journal.  The writer commenced with a description of mamma's  room in Cottage Place, and dwelt particularly upon a picture of uncle  hanging over the mantelpiece, but that portion of the sketch has been  torn off and lost.    . . . . . . \"But let us regard the _living_ pictures.  You see that  youthful group!  A group to inspire a poet or painter!  They are  four--they are cousins.  Two are orphans; you see a resemblance to the  face in the frame wreathed in _immortelles_.  We will first observe  those two that sit with arms entwined, smiling up into each other's  eyes.  It is the gentle Lela[1] and her cousin Majoli, _belle_ Majoli  we may call her.  These cousins are nigh the same age, and their hearts  beat in sweet accord.  And there is a certain likeness, spiritual more  than physical--for Majoli is taller and slighter, and fairer, too, if  we reckon by the hue of the hair and color of the eyes.    \"Lela has soft, soliciting, brown eyes; Majoli is azure-eyed, laughing  or languid according to her varying mood.  Lela's face is pale as  moonbeams; filial solicitude and divine sorrow have left their  chastening impression upon her exquisite lineaments.  Her countenance  is Madonna-like in purity, ingenuousness, and self-abnegation.    \"Majoli's delicate features are untouched by pain or care, and though  her spiritual countenance is often tinged with melancholy, no harsh  experience has traced those pensive lines.  'Tis but the soul's  limning--a musical nature is hers, emotional and imaginative.    \"Lela's head is large, though not unfeminine, and the magnificent  wealth of tawny-colored hair reminds one of Guercino's Holy Magdalen.  She has pretty, modest ways of looking down under those pale, drooping  lids with her calm, confiding eyes, and if the mouth is somewhat large,  the teeth are white and even, and the lips are coral-tinted.  The nose  is straight and slender, and suggests the chisel of Phidias, and from  the expansive brow we infer a broad culture and comprehensive  understanding.  It is the seat of Philosophy, as well as the throne of  the Muses.    \"Majoli's head is smaller than Lela's, but its pose is aristocratic and  graceful.  The blonde hair is artistically coiffed, and though the  features are not strikingly regular, there is sympathy and great  sweetness in the face, and art and refinement are expressed even by the  slim, pale hands.  An airy, lithesome figure she has, and the beat of  her footfall is cadenced to the measure of joyous music.  Frail she  seems compared with Lela's well-rounded figure, but if she has not  equal strength, she has elasticity; and if more energy and power is  indicated by the physiognomy of Lela, Majoli has ambition and judgment  to compensate.    \"We have compared Lela's face to the rich portraiture of Guercino;  Majoli's suggests the pencil of that famous old Spanish master, Ribera,  whose "]]]
