It is to the results of  this crop that I now wish to call your attention. Before sowing,  the land was subsoiled to the depth of from 14 to 16 inches;  except a strip of about 10 feet in width, down the middle of the  field, which was left untouched for the purpose of determining  what were the advantages derived from subsoiling. If the advantage  was merely that of thorough draining (for the field had not been  thoroughly drained previous to the subsoiling), it was thought  probable that this strip of 10 feet wide would be drained by the  subsoiling on each side of it; but if, in addition to this, the  wheat plant derived more nourishment by striking its root deeper  into the soil, where that was loosened by the subsoil plough, the  crop ought to be better in the subsoiled than in the unsubsoiled  part. The field runs over the ridge of a hill, and upon that ridge  the soil is so poor and thin, that it was deemed expedient to give  it a slight dressing of coal-ashes and night-soil, from an idea  that the plant would scarcely survive the winter unless some  stimulus were applied there; but the ashes contained little  manure, and were only applied to the worst part of the field,  covering about one-third of its surface. The wheat was Spalding's  Prolific; it came up evenly and well all over the field. It was  hand-sowed with lime early in February to the extent of about 24  cwt. of dry lime on the acre. In order to ascertain  the value of  lime, and the proper quantity, I had the field uniformly covered  with it, except one land, which was left entirely without, and the  headlands, which had one three, the other six times as much lime  put upon them as any other part. The field was also dressed with a  chemical manure of the following ingredients on the 16th March,  costing:--                                              L.      s.     d.    1 1/4 cwt. nitrate of soda                0      17      6  1      \"   impure sulphate of magnesia    0       5      0    3/4  \"   silicate of soda               0      11      3    3/4  \"   common salt                    0       2      0  1 1/4  \"   gypsum                         0       2      0  Mixing and applying it, say               0       2      3    Total for statute acre                   L2       0      0    Speculating on the probability of a dry summer, I gave it an extra  quantity of manure, and I think where guano is used afterwards, as  it is by me, the nitrate of soda might be dispensed with, which  would bring the cost to L1 2s. 6d. per acre. I should prefer guano  to nitrate of soda, because of the phosphates contained in the  former. At the distance we are from the sea (about thirty miles)  it would seldom be necessary to apply common salt, as the gales of  winter generally bring as much as is needed; but last winter we  had no high winds, and I thought that where salt was applied with  other chemical manures, the wheat was more luxuriant than where  there was none; but owing to a misunderstanding of the instructions  to that effect, the produce was not kept separate. When the chemical  manure was applied, one land was left without, for the purpose of  comparison. Guano was sowed on the land on the 29th March, at the  rate of something less than 2 cwt. to the statute acre, one side of  the field being covered with Peruvian, the other with African, and  the land on which no chemical manure had been sowed was half of it  covered with guano, and the other half left without anything except  lime; but as it was thought desirable to ascertain the value of the  chemical manure without guano, half of this patch was sowed with the  chemical manure in April, after the long drought of the last spring  had set in. A small patch was left without manure, to show the  natural condition of the field, and to serve as a comparison with  the manured part alongside it, and also with the condition of the  field when the experiment commenced, 1841-2, when the unmanured  portion yielded only 19 2/3 bushels to the acre. This part of the  experiment, however, was frustrated by the carelessness of the men  who thrashed out the wheat. The crop was a very good one throughout  the field, but was evidently shorter and thinner where there was  no lime, and also where guano was applied alone. It was best on  the headlands where more lime had been applied. The weather was  extremely favourable until the wheat was going out of bloom, but  it then changed, and the crop was beaten down by the rain, in some  places so thoroughly that it never rose again; and from that time  to the day it was reaped (21st August), there were not more than  six fine warm days. This cold and ungenial weather would, no  doubt, materially affect both the quantity and quality of the  crop,--the sample only being just fair. On thrashing out the crop,  I find the result to be as follows:--Where the guano and chemical  manure were applied, but no lime, the yield was 49 1/5 bushels of  60 lbs. per statute acre; where the land was left unsubsoiled, it  was 52 1/2 bushels; when guano alone was applied, it was 42 1/3  bushels; where the chemical manure alone was applied, it was 43  1/2 bushels; where the African guano was applied, it was 45  bushels; where the Peruvian was applied, it was 52 2/3 bushels; on  the headlands, where three times the quantity of lime (or 3 1/2  tons per acre) was applied, it was nearly 62 bushels; and where  six times the quantity of lime (or 7 tons to the acre), it was 49  2/3 bushels. I give this last result as it was ascertained, but do  not consider it conclusive, for the wheat plant on this headland  looked quite as well as the other, until it went out of bloom,  when from some unknown cause it was partially blighted; an  irregular patch from a foot to a yard in width and extending  almost from end to end of the headland becoming brown and parched,  as if affected by lightning or some atmospheric visitation. With  the view of making these results a little clearer to the eye, I  subjoin the following tabular statement of the produce per acre in  the different parts of the field:--    Bushels of 60 lbs. per statute acre.    Guano alone                                   42 1/3  Chemical manure alone                         43 1/2  Guano and chemical manure, with 24 cwt.  lime to the acre, but land unsubsoiled        52 2/3  Guano and chemical manure, but no lime        49 1/5  African guano and lime                        45  Peruvian  \"      \"                            52 2/3  \"    \"   and 3 times as much lime             62  \"    \"   and 6     \"         \"                49 2/3  Average crop throughout the field             50    It may be as well to observe, that the total expense of manure,  and of its application to that portion of the field which produced  sixty-two bushels per acre (including the guano and the additional  quantity of lime used), was at the rate of 81s. per statute acre.  Deducting the cost of the nitrate of soda, the utility of which,  under the circumstances, I am inclined to doubt, it would have  been 63s. 6d. I consider these to be very favourable results, and  as offering strong inducements to continue the experiment. I have  accordingly had the land ploughed up and cleaned; and it was again  sowed with wheat on the 9th inst. Having detailed the general  results of the experiment, I beg to offer the following remarks  upon some points in it, which seem to me to require a little  elucidation. I consider the success of this experiment to be in a  great measure owing to the use of soluble silica and magnesia;  because, although there is an abundance of silica in the soil, my  first crop showed very miserable results, the grain being ill-fed  and poor, and the straw soft and discoloured, although the year  1842 was, in this district, very favourable for wheat, the month  of August being singularly fine and warm; but when I combined the  nitrate of soda with sulphate of magnesia, as in experiment No. 1  in 1843, but still more so when I combined it with the silicate of  soda, as in No. 3 of that year, the straw became as strong, firm,  and bright as need be desired; and this year when both these salts  are combined with nitrate of soda, common salt, and gypsum, I have  not only good and bright straw, but also an abundant crop of wheat.    With respect to the lime used, it may be as well to state that the  field had not been limed for many years, and although in a  limestone district, showed a deficiency of lime on analysis. The  soil is a strong loam, on a brick clay subsoil, in which there is  little or no lime, although the stony clays, which form the  subsoil in a great part of the district, abound in it, containing  from twenty to thirty per cent. of carbonate of lime. I had always  believed that lime was used in great excess in this neighbourhood,  and had, in fact, an idea that its good qualities were overrated,  inasmuch as it does not enter into the composition of the plant,  except in very minute proportion; but last winter I saw a paper  (by Mr. Briggs of Overton) on the possibility of growing wheat on  the same land year after year, in which the utility of lime in  preventing rust was incidentally touched upon. I also saw Liebig's  letters explaining the action of quicklime in liberating potash  from the clay; and then I considered it very important to  ascertain the proper quantity to be applied. The quantity required  to decompose the phosphate of iron was not great, and assuming  Liebig's theory of its action in liberating the potash to be true,  it seemed to me that an excess of lime would permanently  impoverish the land; for, supposing that the crop required 100  lbs. of potash, and as much lime was applied as liberated 500  lbs., what became of the 400 lbs. which did not enter into the  composition of the plant? was not a large portion of this 400 lbs.  washed down the drains "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1831"],[0,"The Lock and Key Library: Classic Mystery and Detective Stories: Old Time (#17)"],[1,"ntle,  her dark image seeming darker still as the moonlight whitened all  the ground from which the image rose motionless.  Margrave opened  his coffer, the Veiled Woman did not aid him, and I watched in  silence, while he as silently made his weird and wizard-like  preparations.      VII      On the ground a wide circle was traced by a small rod, tipped  apparently with sponge saturated with some combustible naphtha-like  fluid, so that a pale, lambent flame followed the course of the rod  as Margrave guided it, burning up the herbage over which it played,  and leaving a distinct ring, like that which, in our lovely native  fable talk, we call the \"Fairy's ring,\" but yet more visible  because marked in phosphorescent light.  On the ring thus formed  were placed twelve small lamps, fed with the fluid from the same  vessel, and lighted by the same rod.  The light emitted by the  lamps was more vivid and brilliant than that which circled round  the ring.    Within the circumference, and immediately round the woodpile,  Margrave traced certain geometrical figures, in which--not without  a shudder, that I overcame at once by a strong effort of will in  murmuring to myself the name of \"Lilian\"--I recognized the  interlaced triangles which my own hand, in the spell enforced on a  sleepwalker, had described on the floor of the wizard's pavilion.  The figures were traced like the circle, in flame, and at the point  of each triangle (four in number) was placed a lamp, brilliant as  those on the ring.  This task performed, the caldron, based on an  iron tripod, was placed on the woodpile.  And then the woman,  before inactive and unheeding, slowly advanced, knelt by the pile  and lighted it.  The dry wood crackled and the flame burst forth,  licking the rims of the caldron with tongues of fire.    Margrave flung into the caldron the particles we had collected,  poured over them first a liquid, colorless as water, from the  largest of the vessels drawn from his coffer, and then, more  sparingly, drops from small crystal phials, like the phials I had  seen in the hand of Philip Derval.    Having surmounted my first impulse of awe, I watched these  proceedings, curious yet disdainful, as one who watches the  mummeries of an enchanter on the stage.    \"If,\" thought I, \"these are but artful devices to inebriate and  fool my own imagination, my imagination is on its guard, and reason  shall not, this time, sleep at her post!\"    \"And now,\" said Margrave, \"I consign to you the easy task by which  you are to merit your share of the elixir.  It is my task to feed  and replenish the caldron; it is Ayesha's to feed the fire, which  must not for a moment relax in its measured and steady heat.  Your  task is the lightest of all: it is but to renew from this vessel  the fluid that burns in the lamps, and on the ring.  Observe, the  contents of the vessel must be thriftily husbanded; there is  enough, but not more than enough, to sustain the light in the  lamps, on the lines traced round the caldron, and on the farther  ring, for six hours.  The compounds dissolved in this fluid are  scarce--only obtainable in the East, and even in the East months  might have passed before I could have increased my supply.  I had  no months to waste.  Replenish, then, the light only when it begins  to flicker or fade.  Take heed, above all, that no part of the  outer ring--no, not an inch--and no lamp of the twelve, that are to  its zodiac like stars, fade for one moment in darkness.\"    I took the crystal vessel from his hand.    \"The vessel is small,\" said I, \"and what is yet left of its  contents is but scanty; whether its drops suffice to replenish the  lights I cannot guess--I can but obey your instructions.  But, more  important by far than the light to the lamps and the circle, which  in Asia or Africa might scare away the wild beasts unknown to this  land--more important than light to a lamp is the strength to your  frame, weak magician!  What will support you through six weary  hours of night watch?\"    \"Hope,\" answered Margrave, with a ray of his old dazzling style.  \"Hope!  I shall live--I shall live through the centuries!\"      VIII      One hour passed away; the fagots under the caldron burned clear in  the sullen, sultry air.  The materials within began to seethe, and  their color, at first dull and turbid, changed into a pale-rose  hue; from time to time the Veiled Woman replenished the fire, after  she had done so reseating herself close by the pyre, with her head  bowed over her knees, and her face hid under her veil.    The lights in the lamps and along the ring and the triangles now  began to pale.  I resupplied their nutriment from the crystal  vessel.  As yet nothing strange startled my eye or my ear beyond  the rim of the circle--nothing audible, save, at a distance, the  musical wheel-like click of the locusts, and, farther still, in the  forest, the howl of the wild dogs that never bark; nothing visible,  but the trees and the mountain range girding the plains silvered by  the moon, and the arch of the cavern, the flush of wild blooms on  its sides, and the gleam of dry bones on its floor, where the  moonlight shot into the gloom.    The second hour passed like the first.  I had taken my stand by the  side of Margrave, watching with him the process at work in the  caldron, when I felt the ground slightly vibrate beneath my feet,  and looking up, it seemed as if all the plains beyond the circle  were heaving like the swell of the sea, and as if in the air itself  there was a perceptible tremor.    I placed my hand on Margrave's shoulder and whispered, \"To me earth  and air seem to vibrate.  Do they seem to vibrate to you?\"    \"I know not, I care not,\" he answered impetuously.  \"The essence is  bursting the shell that confined it.  Here are my air and my earth!  Trouble me not.  Look to the circle--feed the lamps if they fail!\"    I passed by the Veiled Woman as I walked toward a place in the ring  in which the flame was waning dim; and I whispered to her the same  question which I had whispered to Margrave.  She looked slowly  around and answered, \"So is it before the Invisible make themselves  visible!  Did I not bid him forbear?\"  Her head again drooped on  her breast, and her watch was again fixed on the fire.    I advanced to the circle and stooped to replenish the light where  it waned.  As I did so, on my arm, which stretched somewhat beyond  the line of the ring, I felt a shock like that of electricity.  The  arm fell to my side numbed and nerveless, and from my hand dropped,  but within the ring, the vessel that contained the fluid.  Recovering my surprise or my stun, hastily with the other hand I  caught up the vessel, but some of the scanty liquid was already  spilled on the sward; and I saw with a thrill of dismay, that  contrasted indeed the tranquil indifference with which I had first  undertaken my charge, how small a supply was now left.    I went back to Margrave, and told him of the shock, and of its  consequence in the waste of the liquid.    \"Beware,\" said he, that not a motion of the arm, not an inch of the  foot, pass the verge of the ring; and if the fluid be thus  unhappily stinted, reserve all that is left for the protecting  circle and the twelve outer lamps!  See how the Grand Work  advances, how the hues in the caldron are glowing blood-red through  the film on the surface!    And now four hours of the six were gone; my arm had gradually  recovered its strength.  Neither the ring nor the lamps had again  required replenishing; perhaps their light was exhausted less  quickly, as it was no longer to be exposed to the rays of the  intense Australian moon.  Clouds had gathered over the sky, and  though the moon gleamed at times in the gaps that they left in blue  air, her beam was more hazy and dulled.  The locusts no longer were  heard in the grass, nor the howl of the dogs in the forest.  Out of  the circle, the stillness was profound.    And about this time I saw distinctly in the distance a vast Eye.  It drew nearer and nearer, seeming to move from the ground at the  height of some lofty giant.  Its gaze riveted mine; my blood  curdled in the blaze from its angry ball; and now as it advanced  larger and larger, other Eyes, as if of giants in its train, grew  out from the space in its rear--numbers on numbers, like the  spearheads of some Eastern army, seen afar by pale warders of  battlements doomed to the dust.  My voice long refused an utterance  to my awe; at length it burst forth shrill and loud:    \"Look, look!  Those terrible Eyes!  Legions on legions.  And hark!  that tramp of numberless feet; THEY are not seen, but the hollows  of earth echo the sound of their march!\"    Margrave, more than ever intent on the caldron, in which, from time  to time, he kept dropping powders or essences drawn forth from his  coffer, looked up, defyingly, fiercely:    \"Ye come,\" he said in a low mutter, his once mighty voice sounding  hollow and laboring, but fearless and firm--\"ye come--not to  conquer, vain rebels!--ye whose dark chief I struck down at my feet  in the tomb where my spell had raised up the ghost of your first  human master, the Chaldee!  Earth and air have their armies still  faithful to me, and still I remember the war song that summons them  up to confront you!  Ayesha, Ayesha! recall the wild troth that we  pledged among the roses; recall the dread bond by which we united  our sway over hosts that yet own thee as queen, though my scepter  is broken, my diadem reft from my brows!\"    The Veiled Woman rose at this adjuration.  Her veil now was  withdrawn, and the blaze of the fire between Margrave and herself  flushed, as with the rosy bloom of youth, the grand beauty of her  softened face.  It was seen, detached, as it were, from her dark-  mantled form; seen through the mist of the vapors which rose from  the caldron, framing it round like the clouds that are yieldingly  pierced by the light"]]]
