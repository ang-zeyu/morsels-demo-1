The future of German-American relations depends upon America.'    \"Despite this political drive against the man who stood out against a  break with the United States in the _Lusitania_ crisis, Americans here  believe Bethmann-Hollweg will again emerge triumphant.  They feel  certain that if the Chancellor appealed to the public for a decision he  would be supported.    \"The fight to oust the Chancellor has now grown to such proportions  that it overshadows in interest the Allied offensive.  The attacks on  the Chancellor have gradually grown bolder since the appearance of  Prince Buelow's book 'Deutsche Politik,' because this book is believed  to be the opening of Buelow's campaign to oust the Chancellor and step  back into the position he occupied until succeeded by Bethmann-Hollweg  in 1909.    \"The movement has grown more forceful since the German answer to  President Wilson's ultimatum was sent.  The Conservatives accepted the  German note as containing a conditional clause, and they have been  waiting to see what steps the United States would take against England.    \"Within the past few days I have discussed the situation with leaders  of several parties in the Reichstag.  A National Liberal member of the  Reichstag, who was formerly a supporter of von Tirpitz, and the von  Tirpitz submarine policies, said he thought Buelow's success showed  that opposition to America was not dead.    \"'Who is going to be your next President--Wilson or Hughes?' he asked,  and then, without waiting for an answer, continued:    \"'If it is Hughes he can be no worse than Wilson.  The worst he can do  is to declare war on Germany and certainly that would be preferable to  the present American neutrality.    \"'If this should happen every one in our navy would shout and throw up  his hat, for it would mean unlimited sea war against England.  Our  present navy is held in a net of notes.    \"'What do you think the United States could do?  You could not raise an  army to help the Allies.  You could confiscate our ships in American  ports, but if you tried to use them to carry supplies and munitions to  the Allies we would sink them.    \"'Carrying on an unlimited submarine war, we could sink 600,000 tons of  shipping monthly, destroy the entire merchant fleets of the leading  powers, paralyse England and win the war.  Then we would start all  over, build merchantmen faster than any nation, and regain our position  as a leading commercial power.'    \"Friends of the Chancellor still hope that President Wilson will take a  strong stand against England, thereby greatly strengthening  Bethmann-Hollweg's position.  At present the campaign against the  Chancellor is closely connected with internal policies of the  Conservatives and the big land owners.  The latter are fighting  Bethmann-Hollweg because he promised the people, on behalf of the  Kaiser, the enactment of franchise reforms after the war.\"      Commenting on this despatch, the New York _World_ said:      \"Not long ago it was the fashion among the opponents of the  Administration to jeer loudly at the impotent writing of notes.  And  even among the supporters of the Administration there grew an uneasy  feeling that we had had notes _ad nauseam_.    \"Yet these plodding and undramatic notes arouse in Germany a feeling  very different from one of ridicule.  The resentful respect for our  notes is there admirably summed up by a member of the Reichstag who to  the correspondent of the United Press exclaimed bitterly: 'Our present  navy is held in a net of notes.'    \"Nets may not be so spectacular as knuckle-dusters, but they are  slightly more civilised and generally more efficient.\"      The National Liberal Reichstag member who was quoted was Dr. Gustav  Stressemann.  Stressemann is one of the worst reactionaries in Germany  but he likes to pose as a progressive.  He was one of the first men to  suggest that the Reichstag form a committee on foreign relations to  consult with and have equal power of decision with the Foreign Office.    For a great many months the Socialist deputies of the Prussian Diet  have been demanding election reforms.  Their demands were so insistent  that over a year ago the Chancellor, when he read the Kaiser's address  from the throne room in the residence palace in Berlin to the deputies,  promised election reforms in Prussia--after the war.  But during last  summer the Socialists began to demand immediate election reforms.  To  further embarrass the Chancellor and the Government, the National  Liberals made the same demands, knowing all the time that if the  Government ever attempted it, they could swing the Reichstag majority  against the proposal by technicalities.    Throughout the summer months the Government could not hush up the  incessant discussion of war aims.  More than one newspaper was  suppressed for demanding peace or for demanding a statement of the  Government's position in regard to Belgium and Northern France.  The  peace movement within Germany grew by leaps and bounds.  The Socialists  demanded immediate action by the Government.  The Conservatives, the  National Liberals and the Catholic party wanted peace but only the kind  of a peace which Germany could force upon the Entente.  The Chancellor  and other German leaders tried again throughout the summer and fall to  get the outside world interested in peace but at this time the English  and French attacks on the Somme were engaging the attention and the  resources of the whole world.    Before these conflicting movements within Germany can be understood one  must know something of the organisation of Germany in war time.    When the military leaders of Germany saw that the possibility of  capturing Paris or of destroying London was small and that a German  victory, which would fasten Teutonic peace terms on the rest of the  world, was almost impossible, they turned their eyes to  Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, the Balkans and Turkey.  Friederich Naumann,  member of the Progressive Party of the Reichstag, wrote a book on  \"Central Europe,\" describing a great nation stretching from the North  Sea to Bagdad, including Germany, all of Austria-Hungary, parts of  Serbia and Roumania and Turkey, with Berlin as the Capital.  It was  toward this goal which the Kaiser turned the forces of Germany at his  command.  If Germany could not rule the world, if Germany could not  conquer the nine nations which the Director of the Post and Telegraph  had lined up on the 2nd of August, 1914, then Germany could at least  conquer the Dual Monarchy, the Balkans and, Turkey, and even under  these circumstances come out of the war a greater nation than she  entered it.  But to accomplish this purpose one thing had to be  assured.  That was the control of the armies and navies and the foreign  policies of these governments.  The old Kaiser Franz Josef was a man  who guarded everything he had as jealously as a baby guards his toys.  At one time when it was suggested to the aged monarch that Germany and  Austria-Hungary could establish a great kingdom of Poland as a buffer  nation, if he would only give up Galicia as one of the states of this  kingdom, he replied in his childish fashion:    \"What, those Prussians want to take another pearl out of my crown?\"    In June the Austro-Hungarian General Staff conducted an offensive  against Italy in the Trentino with more success than the Germans had  anticipated.  But the Austrians had not calculated upon Russia.  In  July General Brusiloff attacked the Austrian forces in the  neighbourhood of Lusk, succeeded in persuading or bribing a Bohemian  army corps to desert and started through the Austrian positions like a  flood over sloping land.  Brusiloff not only took several hundred  thousand prisoners.  He not only broke clear through the Austrian lines  but he thoroughly demoralised and destroyed the Austrian army as a unit  in the world war.  Von Hindenburg, who had been made Chief of the  German General Staff, was compelled to send thousands of troops to the  Wohlynian battlefields to stop the Russian invasion.  But von  Hindenburg did not look with any degree of satisfaction upon the  possibility of such a thing happening again and informed the Kaiser  that he would continue as Chief of the General Staff only upon  condition that he be made chief of all armies allied to Germany.  At a  Conference at Great Headquarters at Pless, in Silicia, where offices  were moved from France as soon as the Field Marshal took charge,  Hindenburg was made the leader of all the armed forces in Central  Europe.  Thus by one stroke, really by the aid of Russia, Germany  succeeded in conquering Austria-Hungary and in taking away from her  command all of the forces, naval and military, which she had.  At the  same time the Bulgarian and Turkish armies were placed at the disposal  of von Hindenburg.  So far so good for the Prussians.    But there were still some independent forces left within the Central  Powers.  Hungary was not content to do the bidding of Prussia.  Hungarians were not ready to live under orders from Berlin.  Even as  late as a few months ago when the German Minister of the Interior  called a conference in Berlin to mobilise all the food within the  Central Powers, the Hungarians refused to join a scheme which would rob  them of food they had jealously guarded and saved since the beginning  of the war.    In the Dual Monarchy there are many freedom loving people who are  longing for a deliverer.  Hungary at one time feared Russia but only  because of the Czar.  The real and most powerful democratic force among  the Teutonic allies is located there in Budapest.  I know of no city  outside of the United States where the people have such love of freedom  and where public opinion plays such a big role.  Budapest, even in war  times, is one of the most delightful "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15777"],[0,"A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World, Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"the morning of the 22d, the wind shifted to south, and brought with it  fair weather. At noon, we found ourselves in the latitude of 49 deg. 55',  longitude 159 deg. 28', having a very large swell out of the S.W. For the three  days past, the mercury in the thermometer had risen to 46, and the weather  was quite mild. Seven or eight degrees of latitude had made a surprising  difference in the temperature of the air, which we felt with an agreeable  satisfaction.    We continued to advance to the N.E. at a good rate, having a brisk gale  between the S. and E.; meeting with seals, Port Egmont hens, egg birds,  sea-weed, &c. and having constantly a very large swell from the S.W. At ten  o'clock in the morning of the 25th, the land of New Zealand was seen from  the mast-head; and at noon, from the deck; extending from N.E. by E. to E.,  distant ten leagues. As I intended to put into Dusky Bay, or any other port  I could find, on the southern part of _Tavai Poenammoo_, we steered in  for the land, under all the sail we could carry, having the advantage of a  fresh gale at W., and tolerably clear weather. This last was not of long  duration; for, at half an hour after four o'clock, the land, which was not  above four miles distant, was in a manner wholly obscured in a thick haze.  At this time, we were before the entrance of a bay, which I had mistaken  for Dusky Bay, being deceived by some islands that lay in the mouth of it.    Fearing to run, in thick weather, into a place to which we were all  strangers, and seeing some breakers and broken ground a-head, I tacked in  twenty-five fathom water, and stood out to sea with the wind at N.W. This  bay lies on the S.E. side of Cape West, and may be known by a white cliff  on one of the isles which lies in the entrance of the bay. This part of the  coast I did not see, but at a great distance, in my former voyage; and we  now saw it under so many disadvantageous circumstances, that the less I say  about it, the fewer mistakes I shall make. We stood out to sea, under  close-reefed top-sails and courses, till eleven o'clock at night; when we  wore and stood to the northward, having a very high and irregular sea. At  five o'clock next morning, the gale abated, and we bore up for the land; at  eight o'clock, the West Cape bore E. by N. 1/2 N., for which we steered,  and entered Dusky Bay about noon. In the entrance of it, we found 44  fathoms water, a sandy bottom, the West Cape bearing S.S.E., and Five  Fingers Point, or the north point of the bay, north. Here we had a great  swell rolling in from the S.W. The depth of water decreased to 40 fathoms,  afterwards we had no ground with 60. We were, however, too far advanced to  return; and therefore stood on, not doubting but that we should find  anchorage. For in this bay we were all strangers; in my former voyage,  having done no more than discover and name it.    After running about two leagues up the bay, and passing several of the  isles which lay in it, I brought-to, and hoisted out two boats; one of  which I sent away with an officer round a point on the larboard hand to  look for anchorage. This he found, and signified the same by signal. We  then followed with the ship, and anchored in 50 fathoms water, so near the  shore as to reach it with an hawser. This was on Friday the 26th of March,  at three in the afternoon, after having been 117 days at sea; in which time  we had sailed 3600 leagues, without having once sight of land.    After such a long continuance at sea, in a high southern latitude, it is  but reasonable to think that many of my people must be ill of the scurvy.  The contrary, however, happened. Mention hath already been made of sweet  wort being given to such as were scorbutic. This had so far the desired  effect, that we had only one man on board that could be called very ill of  this disease; occasioned chiefly, by a bad habit of body, and a  complication of other disorders. We did not attribute the general good  state of health in the crew, wholly to the sweet wort, but to the frequent  airing and sweetening the ship by fires, &c. We must also allow portable  broth, and sour krout, to have had some share in it. This last can never be  enough recommended.    My first care, after the ship was moored, was to send a boat and people a-  fishing; in the mean time, some of the gentlemen killed a seal, (out of  many that were upon a rock,) which made us a fresh meal.    CHAPTER IV.    _Transactions in Dusky Bay, with an Account of several Interviews with  the Inhabitants._    1773 March    As I did not like the place we had anchored in, I sent Lieutenant  Pickersgill over to the S.E. side of the bay, to search for a better; and I  went myself to the other side, for the same purpose, where I met with an  exceedingly snug harbour, but nothing else worthy of notice. Mr Pickersgill  reported, upon his return, that he had found a good harbour, with every  conveniency. As I liked the situation of this, better than the other of my  own finding, I determined to go there in the morning. The fishing-boat was  very successful; returning with fish sufficient for all hands for supper;  and, in a few hours in the morning, caught as many as served for dinner.  This gave us certain hopes of being plentifully supplied with this article.  Nor did the shores and woods appear less destitute of wild fowl; so that we  hoped to enjoy with ease, what, in our situation, might be called the  luxuries of life. This determined me to stay some time in this bay, in  order to examine it thoroughly; as no one had ever landed before, on any of  the southern parts of this country.    On the 27th, at nine o'clock in the morning, we got under sail with a light  breeze at S.W., and working over to Pickersgill harbour, entered it by a  channel scarcely twice the width of the ship; and in a small creek, moored  head and stern, so near the shore as to reach it with a brow or stage,  which nature had in a manner prepared for us in a large tree, whose end or  top reached our gunwale. Wood, for fuel and other purposes, was here so  convenient, that our yards were locked in the branches of the trees; and,  about 100 yards from our stern, was a fine stream of freshwater. Thus  situated, we began to clear places in the woods, in order to set up the  astronomer's observatory, the forge to repair our iron-work, tents for the  sail-makers and coopers to repair the sails and casks in; to land our empty  casks, to fill water, and to cut down wood for fuel; all of which were  absolutely necessary occupations. We also began to brew beer from the  branches or leaves of a tree, which much resembles the American black-  spruce. From the knowledge I had of this tree, and the similarity it bore  to the spruce, I judged that, with the addition of inspissated juice of  wort and molasses, it would make a very wholesome beer, and supply the want  of vegetables, which this place did not afford; and the event proved that I  was not mistaken.    Now I have mentioned the inspissated juice of wort, it will not be amiss,  in this place, to inform the reader, that I had made several trials of it  since I left the Cape of Good Hope, and found it to answer in a cold  climate, beyond all expectation. The juice, diluted in warm water, in the  proportion of twelve parts water to one part juice, made a very good and  well-tasted small-beer. Some juice which I had of Mr Pelham's own  preparing, would bear sixteen parts water. By making use of warm-water,  (which I think ought always to be done,) and keeping it in a warm place, if  the weather be cold, no difficulty will be found in fermenting it. A little  grounds of either small or strong-beer, will answer as well as yeast.    The few sheep and goats we had left were not likely to fare quite so well  as ourselves; there being no grass here, but what was coarse and harsh. It  was, however not so bad, but that we expected they would devour it with  great greediness, and were the more surprised to find that they would not  taste it; nor did they seem over-fond of the leaves of more tender plants.  Upon examination, we found their teeth loose; and that many of them had  every other symptom of an inveterate sea-scurvy. Out of four ewes and two  rams which I brought from the Cape, with an intent to put ashore in this  country, I had only been able to preserve one of each; and even these were  in so bad a state, that it was doubtful if they could recover,  notwithstanding all the care possible had been taken of them.    Some of the officers, on the 28th, went up the bay in a small boat on a  shooting party; but, discovering inhabitants, they returned before noon, to  acquaint me therewith; for hitherto we had not seen the least vestige of  any. They had but just got aboard, when a canoe appeared off a point about  a mile from us, and soon after, returned behind the point out of sight,  probably owing to a shower of rain which then fell; for it was no sooner  over, than the canoe again appeared, and came within musket-shot of the  ship. There were in it seven or eight people. They remained looking at us  for some time, and then returned; all the signs of friendship we could make  did not prevail on them to come nearer. After dinner I took two boats and  went in search of them, in the cove where they were first seen, accompanied  by several of the officers and gentlemen. We found the canoe (at least  a-canoe) hauled upon the shore near to two small huts, where were several  fire-places, some fishing-nets, a few fish lying on the shore, and some in  the canoe. But we saw no people; they probably had retired into the woods.  After a short stay, and leaving in the canoe some medals, looking-glasses,  beads, &c. we embarked and rowed to the head of the cove, where we found  nothing remarkable. In turning back we put ashore at the same place as  before; but still saw no people. However, they could not be far off, as we  smelled the smoke of"]]]
