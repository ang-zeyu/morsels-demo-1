Abandon thy wilful blindness, and speak  forth the truth amidst the people. I swear by God that I have wept for  thee to see thee following thy selfish passions and renouncing Him Who  fashioned thee and brought thee into being. Call to mind the tender mercy  of thy Lord, and remember how We nurtured thee by day and by night for  service to the Cause. Fear God, and be thou of the truly repentant.  Granted that the people were confused about thy station, is it conceivable  that thou thyself art similarly confused? Tremble before thy Lord and  recall the days when thou didst stand before Our throne, and didst write  down the verses that We dictated unto thee--verses sent down by God, the  Omnipotent Protector, the Lord of might and power. Beware lest the fire of  thy presumptuousness debar thee from attaining to God's Holy Court. Turn  unto Him, and fear not because of thy deeds. He, in truth, forgiveth  whomsoever He desireth as a bounty on His part; no God is there but Him,  the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bounteous. We admonish thee solely for the  sake of God. Shouldst thou accept this counsel, thou wilt have acted to  thine own behoof; and shouldst thou reject it, thy Lord, verily, can well  dispense with thee, and with all those who, in manifest delusion, have  followed thee. Behold! God hath laid hold on him who led thee astray.  Return unto God, humble, submissive and lowly; verily, He will put away  from thee thy sins, for thy Lord, of a certainty, is the Forgiving, the  Mighty, the All-Merciful.    185 This is the Counsel of God; would that thou mightest heed it! This is  the Bounty of God; would that thou mightest receive it! This is the  Utterance of God; if only thou wouldst apprehend it! This is the Treasure  of God; if only thou couldst understand!    186 This is a Book which hath become the Lamp of the Eternal unto the  world, and His straight, undeviating Path amidst the peoples of the earth.  Say: This is the Dayspring of Divine knowledge, if ye be of them that  understand, and the Dawning-place of God's commandments, if ye be of those  who comprehend.    187 Burden not an animal with more than it can bear. We, truly, have  prohibited such treatment through a most binding interdiction in the Book.  Be ye the embodiments of justice and fairness amidst all creation.    188 Should anyone unintentionally take another's life, it is incumbent  upon him to render to the family of the deceased an indemnity of one  hundred mit{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}qals of gold.

They, in truth, are the Trustees of God among  His servants and the daysprings of authority in His countries.    O people of God! That which traineth the world is Justice, for it is  upheld by two pillars, reward and punishment. These two pillars are the  sources of life to the world. Inasmuch as for each day there is a new  problem and for every problem an expedient solution, such affairs should  be referred to the House of Justice that the members thereof may act  according to the needs and requirements of the time. They that, for the  sake of God, arise to serve His Cause, are the recipients of divine  inspiration from the unseen Kingdom. It is incumbent upon all to be  obedient unto them. All matters of State should be referred to the House  of Justice, but acts of worship must be observed according to that which  God hath revealed in His Book.    O people of Baha! Ye are the dawning-places of the love of God and the  daysprings of His loving-kindness. Defile not your tongues with the  cursing and reviling of any soul, and guard your eyes against that which  is not seemly. Set forth that which ye possess. If it be favourably  received, your end is attained; if not, to protest is vain. Leave that  soul to himself and turn unto the Lord, the Protector, the  Self-Subsisting. Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord and  strife. The hope is cherished that ye may obtain true education in the  shelter of the tree of His tender mercies and act in accordance with that  which God desireth. Ye are all the leaves of one tree and the drops of one  ocean.                   _(Tablets of Baha'u'llah revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas)_          Long Obligatory Prayer                       To Be Recited Once In Twenty-four Hours          _Whoso wisheth to recite this prayer, let him stand up and turn      unto God, and, as he standeth in his place, let him gaze to the      right and to the left, as if awaiting the mercy of his Lord, the      Most Merciful, the Compassionate. Then let him say:_      O Thou Who art the Lord of all names and the Maker of the heavens! I  beseech Thee by them Who are the Daysprings of Thine invisible Essence,  the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, to make of my prayer a fire that will  burn away the veils which have shut me out from Thy beauty, and a light  that will lead me unto the ocean of Thy Presence.          _Let him then raise his hands in supplication toward God--blessed      and exalted be He--and say:_      O Thou the Desire of the world and the Beloved of the nations! Thou seest  me turning toward Thee, and rid of all attachment to anyone save Thee, and  clinging to Thy cord, through whose movement the whole creation hath been  stirred up. I am Thy servant, O my Lord, and the son of Thy servant.  Behold me standing ready to do Thy will and Thy desire, and wishing naught  else except Thy good pleasure. I implore Thee by the Ocean of Thy mercy  and the Day-Star of Thy grace to do with Thy servant as Thou willest and  pleasest. By Thy might which is far above all mention and praise!  Whatsoever is revealed by Thee is the desire of my heart and the beloved  of my soul. O God, my God! Look not upon my hopes and my doings, nay  rather look upon Thy will that hath encompassed the heavens and the earth.  By Thy Most Great Name, O Thou Lord of all nations! I have desired only  what Thou didst desire, and love only what Thou dost love.          _Let him then kneel, and bowing his forehead to the ground, let      him say:_      Exalted art Thou above the description of anyone save Thyself, and the  comprehension of aught else except Thee.          _Let him then stand and say:_      Make my prayer, O my Lord, a fountain of living waters whereby I may live  as long as Thy sovereignty endureth, and may make mention of Thee in every  world of Thy worlds.          _Let him again raise his hands in supplication, and say:_      O Thou in separation from Whom hearts and souls have melted, and by the  fire of Whose love the whole world hath been set aflame! I implore Thee by  Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the whole creation, not to  withhold from me that which is with Thee, O Thou Who rulest over all men!  Thou seest, O my Lord, this stranger hastening to his most exalted home  beneath the canopy of Thy majesty and within the precincts of Thy mercy;  and this transgressor seeking the ocean of Thy forgiveness; and this lowly  one the court of Thy glory; and this poor creature the orient of Thy  wealth.

After carefully reviewing the evidence brought before the Court, and  considering the opinion expressed by the Native officers who composed  it, the Commander-in-Chief decided to try the eighty-five men who had  refused to receive the cartridges by a General Court-Martial composed  entirely of their own countrymen. The Court was formed of six  Mahomedans and nine Hindus, six Native officers being brought over  from Delhi for the purpose.    The prisoners were tried on the 8th May, found guilty, and sentenced  to imprisonment with hard labour for ten years.    The following morning there was a parade of the whole of the Meerut  garrison, and the finding and sentence of the Court were read to the  men. The eighty-five troopers were then stripped of their uniform and  fetters were fastened on their ankles. As each culprit was marched  forward, he called on his comrades to rescue him, but no response came  from the ranks; and when the ceremony was finished the prisoners were  marched down the line and escorted to the gaol. In his report of the  parade to Army Head-Quarters, General Hewitt stated that 'the majority  of the prisoners seemed to feel acutely the degradation to which their  folly and insubordination had brought them. The remainder of the  troops are behaving steady and soldier-like.'    The action of the Meerut authorities in putting the prisoners in irons  on the parade-ground, in the presence of their regiment, before  being made over to the civil power, met with the disapproval of the  Commander-in-Chief and the Governor-General. The former expressed his  regret at the unusual procedure. The latter was more pronounced, and  thus expressed himself: 'The riveting of the men's fetters on parade,  occupying, as it did, several hours, in the presence of many who were  already ill-disposed and many who believed in the cartridge fable,  must have stung the brigade to the quick. The consigning the  eighty-five prisoners after such a ceremony to gaol with no other than  a Native guard over them was folly that is inconceivable.'    The procedure was no doubt unusual, and it certainly was most  imprudent, under the circumstances, to trust the gaol to a Native  guard. I think also, considering the number of the prisoners, and the  length of time necessary for riveting the fetters, that it was not  judicious to subject the troops to such a severe and protracted  trial of their nerves and patience; but, before acquiescing in Lord  Canning's sweeping condemnation, it should be considered that the  object of the punishment was to produce a deterrent effect on those  who were likely to follow the bad example that had been set them,  and as the offence of the troopers had been public and ostentatious,  General Hewitt no doubt thought it right to make the punishment as  marked and public as possible.    The next day was Sunday, and outwardly the cantonment of Meerut  had assumed its usual appearance of Sabbath calm; but there was an  undercurrent of unrest--there was considerable commotion in the Native  bazaars, which were unusually crowded, and had not the European  officers been blinded by over-confidence in their men, signs might  have been perceived amongst the Native soldiers of preparation for  some untoward event.    It was late in the day before the storm burst. The Chaplain of Meerut  tells us that he was about to start with his wife for evening service,  when the Native nurse warned them of coming danger, beseeching her  mistress to remain indoors, and, on being asked to explain, saying  there would be a fight with the sepoys. The idea seemed incredible,  and the Chaplain would have paid no attention to the warning had not  his wife been greatly alarmed. At her earnest request he took his two  children with them in the carriage, instead of leaving them in the  house with the _ayah_, as had been intended. It was soon apparent that  the _ayah_ had not spoken without reason, for before the church was  reached sounds of musketry were heard and columns of smoke were  seen rising above the quarter occupied by the Native troops. As the  Chaplain arrived at the church enclosure, the buglers of the 60th  Rifles, who were drawn up ready to enter the church, sounded the  'alarm' and the 'assembly.' The parade was dismissed, and as the  British soldiers rushed to the barracks for their arms and ammunition,  the congregation rapidly dispersed, some to their homes, others to  seek safety in the nearest quarter-guard.    It was the custom before the Mutiny for our soldiers to attend Divine  Service unarmed, save with their side-arms. The Native soldiers were  aware of this, and they no doubt calculated on the 60th Rifles being  safe and almost defenceless inside the church as soon as the bells  ceased tolling. What they were not aware of was the fact that, owing  to the lengthening days and the increasing heat, the evening church  parade had been ordered half an hour later than on the previous  Sunday. The mutineers therefore showed their hand half an hour too  soon, and as they galloped down the 60th Rifles lines they came upon  the men fully armed and rapidly falling in. Being thus disappointed in  their hope of surprising the white soldiers, the 3rd Cavalry proceeded  without a moment's delay to the gaol, broke into the cells, and  released their eighty-five comrades and all the other prisoners, about  1,200 in number.    While this was going on, the two Native Infantry regiments assembled  on their respective parade-grounds in wild excitement, discharging  their muskets at random, and setting fire to their own huts. The  British officers, hearing the tumult, hastened to their lines and did  their best to restore order, but in vain. The sepoys had gone too  far, and were absolutely deaf to threats and entreaties. They did not  attack their own officers, but warned them to get away, telling them  the Company's '_raj_'[4] was at an end. Their clemency, however, did  not extend to officers of other regiments.    Colonel Finnis, who had served forty years with the sepoys, and firmly  believed in their loyalty, was the first victim; he fell riddled with  bullets from a volley fired by the 20th, while exhorting the men of  his own regiment (the 11th) to be true to their salt. The work of  destruction then began in earnest, in which the population from the  bazaars and the neighbouring villages eagerly joined, for (as the  Commissioner reported) they were armed and ready for the onslaught  before the sepoys commenced the attack, plainly showing how perfectly  they were aware of what was about to happen. They poured forth in  thousands from every direction, and in a surprisingly short time  almost every bungalow belonging to a British officer serving with  Native troops was gutted and burnt. Besides Colonel Finnis, seven  officers, three officers' wives, two children, and every stray  European man, woman and child in the outskirts of the cantonments were  massacred.    It was now time for the sepoys to think of themselves. They had thrown  off all allegiance to the _Sarkar_;[5] they had been guilty of murder,  robbery, and incendiarism, and they knew that retribution must  speedily overtake them if they remained at Meerut; they therefore  lost no time in making their escape towards Delhi. They had had ample  opportunity for consultation with the Native officers from that  station, who had come to Meerut as members of the Court-Martial on the  men of the 3rd Light Cavalry, and they knew perfectly well that the  troops at Delhi were prepared to help them to seize the magazine and  resuscitate the old Moghul dynasty. 'To Delhi! To Delhi!' was their  cry, and off they went, leaving naught behind them in their lines  but the smouldering fires of their officers' houses and the lifeless  bodies of their English victims.    But it will be asked, Where were the British troops? Where indeed?  On the alarm being given, the British troops got under arms 'in an  incredibly short time,' but there was unaccountable delay in marching  them to the spot where their help was so greatly needed. The  Carabineers occupied barracks within a few hundred yards of the Native  Infantry lines, the 60th Rifles were only about a mile and a half  away, and the Artillery lay just beyond the 60th. The Brigadier  (Wilson) despatched one company of the Rifles to guard the treasury,  another he left to protect the barracks, and with the remainder,  accompanied by the Carabineers and Artillery, he leisurely proceeded  towards the Native Infantry lines. It was almost dark when he arrived,  but there was light enough to discern, from the ruined houses and the  dead bodies of the murdered officers lying about, in what a merciless  spirit the revolt had been perpetrated. A few shots were fired from  behind the burning huts, but not a single living being was visible,  except two or three Native troopers who were dimly perceptible in the  distance coming from the direction of the gaol, and it was evident  that the sepoys as a body had vanished. But whither? A lengthened  discussion took place as to what was the best course to pursue, which  only resulted in the troops being marched back to their own end of the  cantonment and bivouacking on the mall for the night. The General  and Brigadier, misled by the tumult in the city, which they could  distinctly hear, came to the conclusion that the sepoys had  congregated within its walls and might shortly be expected to attack  that part of the station where the European residents chiefly lived.  It was not discovered till the next morning that all three Native  regiments had made for Delhi.    It is easy to be wise after the event, but one cannot but feel that  there was unaccountable, if not culpable, want of energy displayed by  the Meerut authorities on this disastrous occasion. The officer  in command was afterwards severely censured"]]]
