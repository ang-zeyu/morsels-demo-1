[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15237"],[0,"The Chemistry of Food and Nutrition (#17)"],[1," some form of gout or  chronic rheumatism.\" Dr. Haig ascribes to the presence of uric acid in the  system, not only gout and rheumatism, but epilepsy, hysteria, mental and  bodily depression, diseases of the liver, kidneys, brain, etc.    The opinion of the majority of eminent medical men, during recent years,  is that uric acid is not a cause, but a symptom of gout, that uric acid is  not an irritant to the tissues, and that it is readily excreted in the  healthy subject. Some of the reasons for this latter and against the  previously stated hypothesis, are as follows:--Birds very rarely suffer  from gout--the nodular concretions, sometimes found about their joints and  which have been ascribed to gout, are of tuberculous origin--yet their  blood contains more uric acid than that of man, and the solid matter of  their excretion is mainly urates. If uric acid caused gout we should  expect the disease to be common in birds. It is a remarkable fact that the  waste nitrogen should be excreted in the form of uric acid or urates from  such widely differing classes of animals as birds and serpents. Birds  have a higher body temperature than man, they are very rapid in their  movements and consume a large amount of food proportionate to their  weight. They live, as it were, at high pressure. Serpents, on the other  hand, have a low body temperature, they are lethargic and can live a long  while without food. There is no obvious reason why some animals excrete  urea and others uric acid. As uric acid is a satisfactory and  unirritating form in which waste nitrogen is expelled from the body of the  active alert bird, as well as from the slow moving reptile, it is  surprising if a very much smaller quantity acts as a poison in man. Many  physicians are convinced that uric acid is absolutely unirritating. Uratic  deposits may occur to an enormous extent in gouty persons without the  occurrence of any pain or paroxysms. Urates have been injected in large  amounts into the bodies of animals as well as administered in their food  with no toxic result whatever, or more than purely local irritation. The  most careful investigations upon the excretions of persons suffering from  gouty complaints, have failed to show uric acid in the excretions in  excess of that in normal individuals, except during the later stage of an  acute attack. There is an excess of uric acid in the blood of gouty  subjects; some eminent medical men say it is in the highest degree  probable, that this excess is not due to over production or deficient  destruction, but to defective excretion by the kidneys. The excess may  arise from failure of the uric acid to enter into combination with a  suitable substance in the blood, which assists its passage through the  kidneys. Under the head of gout are classed a number of unrelated  disturbances in the gastro-intestinal tract and nutritive organs, whose  sole bond of union is that they are accompanied by an excess of urates,  and in well developed cases by deposits in the tissues. This is why there  are so many different causes, curative treatments, theories,  contradictions and vagaries in gout. There are good reasons for believing  that uric acid is not in the free state in the body. In the urine it is in  combination with alkalies as urates, perhaps also with some organic body.  It has been shown that the blood of the gouty is not saturated with uric  acid, but can take up more, and that the alkalinity of the blood is not  diminished. The excess over the normal is in many cases small; it is said  to be absent in some persons, and rarely, if ever reaches the quantity  found in leukaemia. Leukaemia is a disease marked by an excessive and  permanent increase in the white blood corpuscles and consequent  progressive anaemia. Neither does the uric acid of gout reach the quantity  produced in persons whilst being fed with thymus gland (sweetbread), for  medical purposes. In neither of these cases are any of the symptoms of  gout present. In the urine of children, it is not unusual to find a  copious precipitate of urates, yet without any observed effect on them.    The symptoms of gout point to the presence of a toxin in the blood, and it  is this which produces the lesions; the deposition of urates in the joints  being secondary. This poison is probably of bacterial origin, derived from  decomposing faecal matter in the large intestine. This is due to faulty  digestion and insufficient or defective intestinal secretions and  constipation. This explains why excessive feeding, especially of proteid  food, is so bad. The imperfectly digested residue of such food, when left  to stagnate and become a mass of bacteria and putrefaction, gives off  poisons which are absorbed in part, into the system. This bacterial poison  produces headache, migraine, gouty or other symptoms. Because of the  general failure of gouty persons to absorb the proper amount of nutriment  from their food, they require to eat a larger quantity; this gives a  further increase of faecal decomposition and thus aggravates matters. The  voluminous bowel or colon of man is a legacy from remote pre-human  ancestors, whose food consisted of bulky, fibrous and slowly digested  vegetable matters. It was more useful then, than now that most of our food  is highly cooked. About a third part of the faecal matter consists of  bacteria of numerous species, though chiefly of the species known as the  _bacillus coli communis_, one of the less harmful kind which is a constant  inhabitant of the intestinal tract in man and animals. This species is  even thought to be useful in breaking down the cellulose, which forms a  part of the food of the herbivora. Flesh meat leaves a residue in which  the bacteria of putrefaction find a congenial home. Poisons such as  ptomaines, fatty acids and even true toxins are produced. It is believed  that there exists in the colons of gouty persons, either conditions more  favourable to the growth of the bacteria of putrefaction, or that they are  less able to resist the effect of the poisons produced. It has generally  been found that milk is a very good food for gouty patients. This seems  due to its being little liable to putrefaction, the bacterial fermentation  to which it is liable producing lactic acid--the souring of milk. The  growth of most bacteria, particularly the putrefactive kinds are hindered  or entirely stopped by acids slightly alkaline media are most favourable.  This explains how it is that milk will often stop diarrhoea.    Dr. Haig condemns pulse and some other vegetable foods, because, he says,  they contain uric acid. Pulse, he states, contains twice as much as most  butcher's meat. Vegetable foods, however, contain no uric acid and meat  but a very small quantity. The proper term to use is purins or nucleins.  Dr. Haig has used a method of analysis which is quite incapable of giving  correct results. Many vegetarians have accepted these figures and his  deductions therefrom, and have given up the use of valuable foods in  consequence. We therefore give some of the analyses of Dr. I. Walker Hall,  from \"The Purin Bodies in Food Stuffs.\" The determination of the purins  has proved a very difficult process. Dr. Hall has devoted much time to  investigating and improving the methods of others, and his figures may be  accepted with confidence.    The first column of figures indicates purin bodies in parts per 1,000, the  second column purin bodies in grains per pound:--    Sweet bread         10.06  70.4  Liver                2.75  19.3  Beef steak           2.07  14.5  Beef Sirloin         1.30   9.1  Ham                  1.15   8.1  Chicken              1.3    9.1  Rabbit               0.97   6.3  Pork Loin            1.21   8.5  Veal loin            1.16   8.14  Mutton               0.96   6.75  Salmon               1.16   8.15  Cod                  0.58   4.07  Lentils and haricots 0.64   4.16  Oatmeal              0.53   3.45  Peameal              0.39   2.54  Asparagus (cooked)   0.21   1.50  Onions               0.09   0.06  Potatoes             0.02   0.1    The following showed no traces of purins: white bread, rice, cabbage,  lettuce, cauliflower and eggs. Milk showed a very small quantity, and  cheese consequently must contain still less.    The researches of Dr. Hall show that the purins of food are metabolised or  broken down by gouty patients, almost as well as by normal individuals,  any slight retention being due to increased capillary pressure. A portion  of the purins remain undigested, the quantity depending upon the  particular purin and the vigour of the digestive organs. Two rabbits had  the purin hypoxanthin given to them daily, in quantities which if given to  a man in proportion to his weight, would have been 17 and 3 grains  respectively. These rabbits showed malnutrition, and after death  degenerative changes were visible in their liver and kidneys. Dr. Hall has  made a large number of personal experiments, and says that when he has  taken large doses of purin bodies--such as 7 grains of hypoxanthin, 15 to  77 grains of guanin or 7 to 15 grains of uric acid, apparently associated  symptoms of general malaise and irritability have frequently appeared. In  gouty subjects such moderate or small quantities of purins which are  without effect on the healthy subject, may prove a source of irritation to  the already weakened liver and kidneys.    Professor Carl von Noorden says of gout, \"with regard to treatment we are  all agreed that food containing an excess of purin bodies should be  avoided, and those words embody almost all there is to be said as to  dietetics. Alcohol is very injurious in gout. Salicylic acid is a  dangerous remedy. Alkalies in every form are utterly useless.\" Dr. J.  Woods-Hutchinson says, \"the one element which has been found to be of the  most overwhelming importance and value in the treatment of gout and  lith3/4mia, water, would act most admirably upon a toxic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15240"],[0,"A Journal of a Tour in the Congo Free State (#17)"],[1,"of a road is evidently a souvenir of  the terrible orgy which followed some recent encounter. Indeed all the  people here are cannibals and those killed or captured in war, except  women and children, are always eaten. When not fighting, the people  fish, collect rubber, grow kwanga and generally work fairly well and are  not troublesome. Mr. Vannini, however, evidently thinks it safer to  erect a high stockade around his house and the huts of the soldiers.  This is a wise precaution, as only a few months ago four French traders  were killed and eaten on the opposite bank of the river.    After passing several densely populated villages, one of which extends  in a straight line for ten miles, we reach Libenge, the capital of the  Ubangi District. The houses here have been arranged around a square with  one side open to the river. In one of these we take up our quarters and  then go for a stroll with Captain Bertrand, the Commissaire of the  District, and Dr. Rhodain, the medical officer for Ubangi. The latter  states that he has only seen two cases of sleeping sickness in several  years' residence and that there is no syphilis, small-pox or  tuberculosis in the neighbourhood. The people work well here,--the  villagers collecting the usual kilogramme per month, while the workers  in the plantations clear the forest and plant more rubber for future  use. The hunting here is very good in the dry season. Now however, it is  necessary to wade in water three feet deep in the forest. Spoor of  elephant and antelope abound and there are several magnificent eagles  and hawks overhead.    The chief difficulty here for Europeans is the water question. Although  much of this necessity is on all sides, it is not of good drinking  quality and dysentery is therefore common, while bilious fever and  hematuria are also known.    One night at Libenge as we were playing bridge, the sentry suddenly  fired and the bullet whistled uncomfortably close by the door of our  house. The guard turned out very quickly without any fuss and passed at  the double. A single sharp order was given and then all was quiet again.  Next day we heard that a thief had penetrated to the rubber store when  he was seen by the sentry, who fired the alarm, but the man was not  captured. All the natives here seem anxious to trade. Ladies sell us  their brass bangles for a tea cup full of salt and their dresses for a  similar amount. Spears, knives and many other curios are also offered  for sale some of which have evidently been hastily made since our  arrival.    We leave Libenge on September 9th and continue our journey in the  _Florida_, this being her first trip up the river higher than this point  for at low water, the rapids above cannot be navigated by steamers at  all. Now however, the depth is almost at its maximum, and as the boat  only draws two feet, she can pass over the rocks with great ease. In the  afternoon we stop at a village and ask for wood, for as there was no  regular steamer service, there were no organised Wood Posts. The natives  at first brought down a log or two and demanded payment at an exorbitant  rate, which the captain refused to give, and it became necessary for our  crew to go ashore and cut wood themselves. The Chief seemed willing to  deal fairly, but evidently had little authority over his lazy people.  Then on again through the tornado, which at this season appears daily  with great regularity either in the afternoon or at night time. The  scenery is now changing, for we are approaching the limits of the great  equatorial forest. Hills, which appear like mountains, after the dead  level, can be seen in front covered with grass and a few trees.    On September 10th, we reach Songo a small State Post in charge of a  native from Sierra Leone. Here we pitch our tents in a clearing and  proceed to re-arrange the baggage, for we shall have now to travel in  canoes, the river not being navigable for steamers for some distance.  Immediately above Songo indeed is the first of the Ubangi rapids, the  water roaring and hissing as it fights its way down and over the rocks.  Just before bedtime, Chikaia comes with a long face and evidently much  disturbed and asks for a gun or rifle to protect himself, as the  _indigenes_ are supposed to be very savage here. This of course I  refuse, and tell him to go to sleep by the fire and not be foolish.  However, I notice that both my rifle and gun are loaded and carefully  placed by my bedside. The boys then organise a watch over the baggage,  taking it in turn to act as sentry. On the opposite side of the river is  Bangi, the second most important place in the French Congo, prettily  situated on the side of a hill, and next day we cross in a small canoe.  The journey is interesting and exciting. Below the rapids are many small  whirlpools, and the capita of the canoe takes advantage of these to help  him on his course. Sometimes the water at the upper and sometimes at the  lower edge of the whirlpool is flowing in the direction he wishes to  take and with wonderful dexterity, he turns the bow of the canoe towards  a suitable current. We swing about like a cork and ship a good deal of  water but arrive without mishap on the other side. We call on Mr.  Jacques, the Vice Governor General of the French Congo, who kindly  offers us assistance and a few soldiers to act as sentries and  interpreters when we camp on the French side of the river. Most of these  are Senegalese and are smart looking fellows. The natives here affect a  very elaborate head dress consisting of many coloured beads twisted and  plaited into their hair, the amount of time and patience required by the  barbers being enormous.    It appears that the four French traders, who were massacred a few weeks  ago, had two factories, one close to the river and one further inland.  In the latter was a large stock of arms and ammunition. These were  hastily abandoned and the natives then seized them and attacked the  factory on the river. All four white men were killed and it is feared  that two were first tied to trees and tortured. A punitive expedition  has been sent against the tribe who are now armed with these modern  rifles and the moral of the story is obviously that it is very dangerous  to permit traders to import and sell arms at all.    One night I was awakened and saw the boys dancing excitedly about the  fire and in front of my tent. Having asked the matter, Chikaia, whose  zoological knowledge is very limited, replied _il est la petite bete_.  This sounded like mosquitoes so, having tucked in my net more closely, I  turned round to sleep. A few minutes afterwards, Lord Mountmorres  appeared shouting with pain and mounting a chair in front of my tent  rapidly peeled off his clothes. He said his bed was full of great black  ants which had fixed on his skin and were biting him all over. Millions  of these pests indeed were on the camping ground but had as yet not  reached my tent. Hastily pulling on high boots and covering myself from  head to foot, I cautiously crept out of the tent and found the ground  black with ants. It was impossible to kill them by stamping about for  they were simply driven into the soft sand and wriggled out again the  moment the foot was withdrawn. We were evidently in the line of march of  a migrating host and were forced to beat a hasty retreat leaving the  insects in full possession.    There is no drinking water at Songo, so we had to boil and filter that  from the river. This proved very difficult, for even after allowing it  to settle and then carefully decanting it, there was so much mud left,  that the pores of the porcelain candles in the filters frequently became  blocked. We had therefore to be content with muddy water well boiled. As  we had a fair amount of baggage, we required sixty or seventy paddlers  and it was not easy to find so many. At length however, after searching  on both sides of the river, crews were collected for three large canoes  and we arranged to continue our journey on September 14th.    The canoes were lifted up the Songo rapids empty, while the baggage was  carried along the bank. It was then stowed in the boats and having  taken our places we made a start. The method of propulsion is very  interesting to watch. The canoes are sixty or seventy feet long and  three or four wide. In the centre is an awning to shade the white man  and in front by the bows, a space is left about ten feet long in which  three pole men work. These use their poles as in punting, except that  the ends are forked, so that they are enabled to push either against the  bottom of the river or rocks, or branches of trees on the bank, for the  canoe keeps close to the shore all the time in order to give the polemen  an opportunity and also to avoid the swifter current running in the  centre of the river. In the stern twenty or thirty paddlers sit on the  sides of the boat and work together, while on the extreme end two or  three stand up with long paddles to steer. The cook with his fire built  on a heap of clay in the bottom of the canoe, sits among the paddlers  and the sentries and baggage tuck themselves in somewhere, for it is  wonderful how many people and how much baggage these canoes will carry.    Soon after starting we pass the Catholic Mission on the French bank and  immediately begin to fight a rapid. The paddlers strain every muscle,  the pole men push with all their strength against rocks and tree trunks  and the soldiers help by pulling on branches of trees or anything else  which is fixed. The water whirls past as we creep up inch by inch. At  one moment gaining, at another losing, the excitement being intense, for  if once we are conquered by the stream, the canoe will probably be  broken to pieces on the rocks. At times some of the crew jump out and  clinging with their feet to the rocks, while up to their middle in the  torrent, push the boat up with all their strength."]]]
