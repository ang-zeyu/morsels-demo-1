Subsidiary embankments thrown up between the principal ones,  and parallel to the Nile, separate the higher ground bordering the river  from the low lands on the confines of the valley; they divide the larger  basins into smaller divisions of varying area, in which the irrigation  is regulated by means of special trenches. As long as the Nile  is falling, the dwellers on its banks leave their canals in free  communication with it; but they dam them up towards the end of the  winter, just before the return of the inundation, and do not reopen them  till early in August, when the new flood is at its height. The waters  then flowing in by the trenches are arrested by the nearest transverse  dyke and spread over the fields. When they have stood there long enough  to saturate the ground, the dyke is pierced, and they pour into the next  basin until they are stopped by a second dyke, which in its turn forces  them again to spread out on either side. This operation is renewed from  dyke to dyke, till the valley soon becomes a series of artificial ponds,  ranged one above another, and flowing one into another from Grebel  Silsileh to the apex of the Delta. In autumn, the mouth of each ditch is  dammed up anew, in order to prevent the mass of water from flowing back  into the stream. The transverse dykes, which have been cut in various  places, are also repaired, and the basins become completely landlocked,  separated by narrow causeways. In some places, the water thus imprisoned  is so shallow that it is soon absorbed by the soil; in others, it is so  deep, that after it has been kept in for several weeks, it is necessary  to let it run off into a neighbouring depression, or straight into the  river itself.    [Illustration: 091.jpg BOATMEN FIGHTING ON A CANAL COMMUNICATING WITH  THE NILE. 1]         1 Bas-relief from the tomb of Ti;   drawn by Faucher-Gudin,       from  a photograph by E. Brugsch-Bey.    History has left us no account of the vicissitudes of the struggle in  which the Egyptians were engaged with the Nile, nor of the time expended  in bringing it to a successful issue. Legend attributes the idea of the  system and its partial working out to the god Osiris: then Menes, the  first mortal king, is said to have made the dyke of Qosheish, on which  depends the prosperity of the Delta and Middle Egypt, and the fabulous  Mceris is supposed to have extended the blessings of the irrigation to  the Fayum. In reality, the regulation of the inundation and the making  of cultivable land are the work of unrecorded generations who peopled  the valley. The kings of the historic period had only to maintain and  develop certain points of what had already been done, and Upper Egypt  is to this day chequered by the network of waterways with which its  earliest inhabitants covered it. The work must have begun simultaneously  at several points, without previous agreement, and, as it were,  instinctively. A dyke protecting a village, a canal draining or watering  some small province, demanded the efforts of but few individuals; then  the dykes would join one another, the canals would be prolonged till  they met others, and the work undertaken by chance would be improved,  and would spread with the concurrence of an ever-increasing population.  What happened at the end of last century, shows us that the system grew  and was developed at the expense of considerable quarrels and bloodshed.  The inhabitants of each district carried out the part of the work most  conducive to their own interest, seizing the supply of water, keeping  it and discharging it at pleasure, without considering whether they  were injuring their neighbours by depriving them of their supply or  by flooding them; hence arose perpetual strife and fighting. It became  imperative that the rights of the weaker should be respected, and that  the system of distribution should be co-ordinated, for the country to  accept a beginning at least of social organization analogous to that  which it acquired later: the Nile thus determined the political as well  as the physical constitution of Egypt.    [Illustration: 092.jpg A GREAT EGYPTIAN LORD, TI, AND HIS WIFE. 1]         1 Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Dumichen,       _Resultate_, vol. ii. pl. vit    The country was divided among communities, whose members were supposed  to be descended from the same seed (_pait_) and to belong to the  same family (_paitu_): the chiefs of them were called _ropaitu_, the  guardians, or pastors of the family, and in later times their name  became a title applicable to the nobility in general. Families combined  and formed groups of various importance under the authority of a head  chief--_ropaitu-ha_. They were, in fact, hereditary lords, dispensing  justice, levying taxes in kind on their subordinates, reserving to  themselves the redistribution of land, leading their men to, battle, and  sacrificing to the gods.[*] The territories over which they exercised  authority formed small states, whose boundaries even now, in some  places, can be pointed out with certainty. The principality of the  Terebinth[**] occupied the very heart of Egypt, where the valley is  widest, and the course of the Nile most advantageously disposed  by nature--a country well suited to be the cradle of an infant  civilization. Siaut (Siut), the capital, is built almost at the foot  of the Libyan range, on a strip of land barely a mile in width, which  separates the river from the hills. A canal surrounds it on three sides,  and makes, as it were, a natural ditch about its walls; during  the inundation it is connected with the mainland only by narrow  causeways--shaded with mimosas--and looking like a raft of verdure  aground in the current.[***]         *  These prerogatives were still exercised by the princes of       the nomes under the Middle and New Empires; they only       enjoyed them then by the good will of the reigning       sovereign.         **  The Egyptian word for the tree which gives its name to       this principality is _atf, iatf, iotf_: it is only by a       process of elimination that I have come to identify it with       the _Pistacia Terebinthus_, L., which furnished the       Egyptians with the scented resin _snutir_.         ***  Boudier's drawing, reproduced on p. 31, and taken from       a photograph by Beato, gives most faithfully the aspect       presented by the plain and the modern town of Siout during       the inundation.    [Illustration: 094.jpg NOMES OF MIDDLE EGYPT]    The site is as happy as it is picturesque; not only does the town  command the two arms of the river, opening or closing the waterway at  will, but from time immemorial the most frequented of the routes into  Central Africa has terminated at its gates, bringing to it the commerce  of the Soudan. It held sway, at the outset, over both banks, from range  to range, northward as far as Deyrut, where the true Bahr Yusuf leaves  the Nile, and southward to the neighbourhood of Gebel Sheikh Haridi. The  extent and original number of the other principalities is not so easily  determined.    The most important, to the north of Siut, were those of the Hare and the  Oleander. The principality of the Hare never reached the dimensions  of that of its neighbour the Terebinth, but its chief town was Khmunu,  whose antiquity was so remote, that a universally accepted tradition  made it the scene of the most important acts of creation.[*] That of the  Oleander, on the contrary, was even larger than that of the Terebinth,  and from Hininsu, its chief governor ruled alike over the marshes of the  Fayum and the plains of Beni-Suef.[**] To the south, Apu on the right  bank governed a district so closely shut in between a bend of the Nile  and two spurs of the range, that its limits have never varied much since  ancient times. Its inhabitants were divided in their employment between  weaving and the culture of cereals. From early times they possessed the  privilege of furnishing clothing to a large part of Egypt, and their  looms, at the present day, still make those checked or striped  \"melayahs\" which the fellah women wear over their long blue tunics.[***]         *  Khmunu, the present Ashmunein, is the Hermopolis of the       Greeks, the town of the god Thot.         **  Hininsu is the _Heraecleopolis Magna_ of the Greeks, the       present Henassieh, called also Ahnas-el-Medineh. The       Egyptian word for the tree which gives its name to this       principality, is Narit. Loret has shown that this tree,       _Narit_, is the oleander.         ***  Apu was the Panopolis or Chemmis of the Greeks, the       town of the god Min or ithyphallic Khimu. Its manufactures       of linen are mentioned by Strabo; the majority of the       beautiful Coptic woven fabrics and embroideries which have       been brought to Europe lately, come from the necropolis of       the Arab period at Apu.    Beyond Apu, Thinis, the Girgeh of the Arabs, situate on both banks of  the river, rivalled Khmunu in antiquity and Siut in wealth: its plains  still produce the richest harvests and feed the most numerous herds of  sheep and oxen in the Said.    [Illustration: 096.jpg NOMES OF UPPER EGYPT]    As we approach the cataract, information becomes scarcer. Qubti and Aunu  of the South, the Coptos and Hermonthis of the Greeks, shared peaceably  the plain occupied later on by Thebes and its temples, and Nekhabit and  Zobu watched over the safety of Egypt. Nekhabit soon lost its position  as a frontier town, and that portion of Nubia lying between Gebel  Silsileh and the rapids of Syene formed a kind of border province, of  which Nubit-Ombos was the principal sanctuary and Abu-Elephantine  the fortress: beyond this were the barbarians, and those inaccessible  regions whence the Nile descended upon our earth.

ASSIGNATS AND MANDATS: the Money and the Finances of the French  Revolution of 1789. By Stephen D. Dillaye. Price, free by mail, 30  cents. Philadelphia, Pa.: Henry Carey Baird & Co., 810 Walnut street.        Mr. Dillaye differs with the Hon. A.D. White, President of      Cornell University, as to the relative merits of money and      promises to pay money; and he begins with the assertion that the      President's \"object is to depreciate American credit, stability,      and honor.\" Further perusal, to ascertain the meaning of this      attack on a patriotic and useful member of society, shows us      what Mr. Dillaye thinks he means. He talks of credit being the      vital element of national power; and from this he argues that      the more \"credit\" a nation has--that is, the deeper it is in      debt--the more powerful it becomes. In short, he confuses credit      as opposed to discredit with credit as opposed to cash--a      grievous blunder, surely. A nation's credit is like a      merchant's; it becomes greater only as his debts become smaller;      and people trust a government for the same reason as they trust      an individual, mainly because every previous obligation has been      honorably observed. It is gratifying to know that persons of Mr.      Dillaye's way of thinking are few and unimportant, and their      number is diminishing daily.      CROTON WATER SUPPLY FOR THE CITY OF NEW YORK: an Address by George B.  Butler to the New York Municipal Society. New York city: Published by  Order of the Society, 87 Madison avenue.        A review of the whole subject of our water supply, its sources      and the area they drain, the geographical features of the      district, and the works erected by the city. Mr. Butler      maintains that the Croton valley, with proper storage      reservoirs, can abundantly supply the whole city; and that no      new aqueduct need be constructed in the present condition of the      public debt.

IMPROVED GANG PLOW.    Ezra Peak, Montana, Kan.--This invention is so constructed that it may  be easily raised from and lowered to the ground, and adjusted to work  at any desired depth in the ground. It is claimed to be of lighter  draft than plows constructed in the usual way, also to be simple in  construction and inexpensive in manufacture. The wheels, the faces of  which are notched to give them a slight up-and-down movement as they  are drawn forward, slightly jar the plows, and thus cause them to be  easier drawn than when smooth wheels are used. The shaft can be  provided with a ratchet wheel and pawl to hold it in any position into  which it may be turned; and to it is attached a rope or chain, the  other end of which, is attached to the forward end of the frame, so  that by turning the shaft the plows may be raised from, lowered to,  and adjusted to work at any desired depth in the ground.      IMPROVED PLOW.    James Willis Hendley, Cedar Hill, N.C., assignor to David N. Bennett  and Samuel T. Wright, of same place.--The objects here are simplicity  and cheapness of construction, and such arrangement of parts as will  prevent the plow becoming clogged with weeds, etc. The mold-board is  welded to the land side, or cast in one piece with it, so that no  brace or other connection is required between the mold-board and  standard; secondly, the curved beam is attached to the heel of the  land-side and supported by a brace, which is bolted to the middle  portion of the latter, and arranged in such relation to the mold-board  that a space is left between them, into which the trash will fall, and  thus be drawn into the furrow and covered.      IMPROVED GRAIN DRILL.    George W. Osborn, Parkville, Mich.--This is an improved attachment for  seed drills, for gaging the depth at which the grain shall be  deposited in the earth. It consists in an adjustable spring gage bar  attached to the shank of each drill tooth, whereby the teeth may be  made to enter the ground a greater or less depth. It is claimed to  ensure the planting of seeds at equal depth in hard or soft ground,  and to diminish the draft.      IMPROVED HORSE HAY RAKE.    Joseph B. Wakeman and John L. Wager, Deposit, N.Y.--The construction  of this implement is such that a large space is afforded beneath the  rake head for the collection of hay. The pivots of said rake head back  are also brought back, so that the teeth may be readily raised to  discharge the collected hay. By an ingenious lever arrangement the  driver is enabled to hold the rake to its work by the pressure of his  foot, and also readily to discharge the hay gathered.      IMPROVED BEE HIVE.    George W. Akins, Bridgeton, Pa.--In this hive, holes are bored in the  sides of the compartment for ventilation, and windows are flared for  the purpose of inspecting the inside of the hive. A frame is used  whenever it is desired to have the honeycomb of any particular shape.  It consists of a form of tin or other suitable maternal, placed on a  frame or slide, and having the shape required in the comb. Bees will  build inside of the form, leaving about one fourth inch space between  the form and the comb. The tin sheet receives a portion of the refuse  matter, and can be readily taken out and cleaned. On the 1st of May  the bees are driven out into another hive and the frames examined.  Three frames are taken out and set in a new box, and three empty  frames are put in their place. The old queen must be put with the new  colony, and half of the bees must be put in each box and shut up, and  put on a stand. The hives are to be opened the next morning. At the  next natural swarming time the swarms can be again divided. The hive  cannot freeze, and it is proof against mice.      IMPROVED PLOW STOCK.    Robert Weber, New Ulm, Texas.--In this invention, by loosening a nut,  the point of draft attachment may be raised and lowered to cause the  plow to work deeper or shallower in the ground, or turned to one or  the other side, to cause the plow to take or leave land, and may be  secured in place when adjusted by again tightening the nut.      IMPROVED COMBINED HAY TEDDER AND SIDE RAKE.    John Huber and Henry Snell, Girard, Ill.--This machine may be used  simply for stirring up and turning the hay, or for turning the hay and  gathering it into windrows. The shaft of a reel revolves in bearings  attached to the side bars of the frame near their rear ends. To the  bars of the reel are attached spring teeth, which, as the machine is  drawn forward, take hold of the hay, carry it up and over the reel,  and drop it to the ground in the rear of the machine. A carrier takes  the hay from the teeth, when it has been brought to the top of the  reel, carries it over the shaft, and discharges it into a trough, down  which it slides, and is deposited in a windrow along one side of the  path of the machine.      IMPROVED GRUBBING MACHINE.    Ira Burley, Redwing, Minn.--This invention consists in the combination  of wheels and axle, tongue, adjusting bar, adjustable brace, uprights,  cross bar, two ropes, and four pulley blocks with each other. To the  forward end of the tongue is attached a loop or clevis, to receive an  iron pin, to be driven into the ground to keep the machine from moving  about while being used. To the pulley block is swiveled a hook, to be  hooked into a loop, attached to the forward end of a lever. The rear  end of the lever passes through a slot in the upper end of a fulcrum  post, and has a notch formed in its lower side to receive a bolt or  pin, attached to said post to serve as a fulcrum to said lever.  Several notches are formed in the lever to receive the fulcrum bolt,  to enable the position of the fulcrum post to be adjusted to regulate  the leverage, and as circumstances may require. To the lever is  attached a strong clevis, to receive the hook of the chain, that is  secured to the stump to be pulled.      IMPROVED SEED PLANTER.    Daniel J. Davis, Red Boiling Springs, Tenn.--In this invention two  wheels revolve upon the journals of the axle. Upon the end parts of  the axle are attached the rear ends of side bars, the forward ends of  which are bolted to the outer sides of the forward ends of the plow  beams. The forward ends of the beams are bolted to the ends of the  front bar, to the center of which is secured the forward end of the  central bar. To the beams are attached the plows for opening furrows  to receive the seed as it passes from the conductor spouts."]]]
