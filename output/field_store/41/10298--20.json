In the fields and  gardens hundreds of insects of every kind crawled, finding no foe to  check them. At last the whole land was like a desert.    From the trees caterpillars dropped down upon the women's bonnets, and  they screamed and ran. At every door, the women gathered and talked.    \"What will become of us?\" asked one. \"The men were wrong,--something  must be done.\"    \"The teacher was right,\" said another.    At last, the farmers grew ashamed of having killed the birds. They met  and did away with the wicked law, but it was too late.    [Illustration: The wagon filled with branches and cages]    Harvest time came, but there was no harvest. In many a home there was  want and sorrow.    The next spring a strange sight was seen--a sight never seen before or  since. Through the streets there went a wagon filled with great branches  of trees. Upon them were hung cages of birds that were making sweet  music.    From all the country round these birds had been brought by order of the  farmers. The cages were opened, and once more the woods and fields were  filled with the beautiful birds, who flew about singing their songs of  joy. And again the harvests grew in the fields and filled to overflowing  the farmers' barns.    --_Adapted from_ LONGFELLOW.          THE TRAILING ARBUTUS    I      Many, many moons ago, in a lodge in a forest, there lived an old man.  His hair was white as the snowdrift. All the world was winter; snow and  ice were everywhere, and the old man wore heavy furs.    The winds went wildly through the forest searching every bush and tree  for birds to chill. The old man looked in vain in the deep snow for  pieces of wood to keep up the fire in his lodge. Then he sat down by his  dull and low fire.    Shaking and trembling he sat there, hearing nothing but the tempest as  it roared through the forest, seeing nothing but the snowstorm as it  whirled and hissed and drifted.    All the coals became white with ashes, and the fire was slowly dying.  Suddenly the wind blew aside the door of the lodge, and there came in a  most beautiful maiden.    Her cheeks were like the wild rose, her eyes were soft and glowed like  the stars in springtime; and her hair was as brown as October's nuts.    Her dress was of ferns and sweet grasses, her moccasins were of white  lilies, on her head was a wreath of wild flowers, and in her hands were  beautiful blossoms. When she breathed, the air became warm and fragrant.    \"Ah, my daughter,\" exclaimed the old man. \"Happy are my eyes to see you.  Sit here on the mat beside me; sit here by the dying embers. Tell me of  your strange adventures, and I will tell you of my deeds of wonder.\"    From his pouch he drew his peace pipe, very old and strangely fashioned.  He filled the pipe with bark of willow, and placed a burning coal upon  it.    Then he said, \"I am Manito, the Mighty. When I blow my breath about me,  the rivers become motionless and the waters hard as stone.\"    The maiden smiling said, \"When I blow my breath about me, flowers spring  up over all the meadows. And all the rivers rush onward, singing songs  of joy.\"    \"When I shake my hoary tresses,\" said the old man, darkly frowning, \"all  the ground is covered with snow. All the leaves fade and wither.\"    \"When I shake my flowing ringlets,\" said the maiden, \"the warm rains  fall over all the land.\"    Then proudly the old man replied, \"When I walk through the forest,  everything flees before me. The animals hide in their holes. The birds  rise from the lakes and the marshes, and fly to distant regions.\"    Softly the maiden answered, \"When I walk through the forest, all is  bright and joyous. The animals come from their holes. The birds return  to the lakes and marshes. The leaves come back to the trees. The plants  lift up their heads to kiss the breezes. And where-ever my footsteps  wander, all the meadows wave their blossoms, all the woodlands ring with  music.\"      II      While they talked, the night departed. From his shining lodge of silver  came the sun. The air was warm and pleasant; the streams began to  murmur; the birds began to sing. And a scent of growing grasses was  wafted through the lodge.    The old man's face dropped upon his breast, and he slept. Then the  maiden saw more clearly the icy face before her--saw the icy face of  winter.    Slowly she passed her hands above his head. Streams of water ran from  his eyes, and his body shrunk and dwindled till it faded into the  air--vanished into the earth--and his clothing turned to green leaves.    The maiden took from her bosom the most precious flowers. Kneeling upon  the ground, she hid them all about among the leaves.    [Illustration: The maiden hides the flowers among the leaves]    \"I give you my most precious flowers and my sweetest breath,\" she said,  \"but all who would pluck you must do so upon bended knee.\"    Then the maiden moved away--through the forest and over the waking  fields; and wherever she stepped, and nowhere else in all the land,  grows the trailing arbutus.    --INDIAN LEGEND.          HIDDEN TREASURE    I      Once upon a time there was an old farmer named John Jacobs. He had heard  that treasures were found in odd places. He thought and thought about  such treasures until he could think of nothing else; and he spent all  his time hunting for them. How he wished he could find a pot of gold!    One morning he arose with a bright face and said to his wife, \"At last,  Mary, I've found the treasure.\"    \"No, I cannot believe it,\" she said.    \"Yes,\" he answered; \"at least it is as good as found. I am only waiting  until I have my breakfast. Then I will go out and bring it in.\"    \"Oh, how did you find it?\" asked the wife.    \"I was told about it in a dream,\" said he.    \"Where is it?\"    \"Under a tree in our orchard,\" said John.    \"Oh, John, let us hurry and get it.\"    So they went out together into the orchard.    \"Which tree is it under?\" asked the wife.    John scratched his head and looked silly.    \"I really do not know,\" he said.    \"Oh, you foolish man,\" said the wife. \"Why didn't you take the trouble  to notice?\"    \"I did notice,\" said he. \"I saw the exact tree in my dream, but there  are so many trees, here that I am confused. There is only one thing to  do now. I must begin with the first tree and keep on digging until I  come to the one with the treasure under it.\"    This made the wife lose all hope. There were eighty apple trees and a  score of peach trees.    She sighed and said, \"I suppose if you must, you must, but be careful  not to cut any of the roots.\"    By this time John was in a very bad humor. He went to work saying, \"What  difference does it make if I cut all the roots? The whole orchard will  not bear one bushel of good apples or peaches. I don't know why, for in  father's time it bore wagonloads of choice fruit.\"    \"Well, John,\" said his wife, \"you know father used to give the trees a  great deal of attention.\"    But John grumbled to himself as he went on with his digging. He dug  three feet deep around the first tree, but no treasure was there. He  went to the next tree, but found nothing; then to the next and the next,  until he had dug around every tree in the orchard. He dug and dug, but  no pot of gold did he find.      II      The neighbors thought that John was acting queerly. They told other  people, who came to see what he was doing.    They would sit on the fence and make sly jokes about digging for hidden  treasure. They called the orchard \"Jacobs' folly.\"    Soon John did not like to be seen in the orchard. He did not like to  meet his neighbors. They would laugh and say, \"Well, John, how much  money did you get from the holes?\"    This made John angry. At last he said, \"I will sell the place and move  away.\"    \"Oh, no,\" said the wife, \"this has always been our home, and I cannot  think of leaving it. Go and fill the holes; then the neighbors will stop  laughing. Perhaps we shall have a little fruit this year, too. The heaps  of earth have stood in wind and frost for months, and that will help the  trees.\"    John did as his wife told him. He filled the holes with earth and  smoothed it over as level as before. By and by everybody forgot \"Jacobs'  folly.\"    Soon the spring came. April was warm, and the trees burst into bloom.    \"Mary,\" said John one bright spring day, \"don't you think the blossoms  are finer than usual this year?\"    \"Yes, they look as they did when your father was alive,\" said his wife.    [Illustration: John's trees full of fruit]    By and by, the blooms fell, leaving a million little green apples and  peaches. Summer passed and autumn followed. The branches of the old  trees could hardly hold up all the fine fruit on them.    Now the neighbors came, not to make fun, but to praise. \"How did you do  it?\" they asked.    \"The trees were old and needed attention,\" said John. \"By turning the  soil and letting in the air, I gave them strength to bear fruit. I have  found the treasure after all, and I have learned a lesson. Tilling the  soil well is the way to get treasure from it.\"    --GRIMM.          THE LITTLE BROWN BROTHER        Little brown brother, oh! little brown brother,      Are you awake in the dark?    Here we lie cozily, close to each other;      Hark to the song of the lark--      \"Waken!\" the lark says, \"waken and dress you;      Put on your green coats and gay,    Blue sky will shine on you, sunshine caress you--      Waken! 'tis morning--'tis May!\"      Little brown brother, oh! little brown brother,      What kind of flower will you be?    I'll be a poppy--all white, like my mother;      Do be a poppy like me.      What! you're a sunflower? How I shall miss you      When you're grown golden and high!    But I shall send all the bees up to kiss you;      Little brown brother, good-by!    --EMILY NESBIT.

It might be added that a still more serious  difficulty in the way of the military engineer, so far as practice and  its consequent experiences are concerned, is that for many years past,  until quite recently, there have been no funds either for experiments  or actual work on fortifications, so that very little has been done on  them during the last twenty years.    Without going into the question of the necessity for sea coast  defenses, we may assume that an enemy is likely to come into one of  our harbors and that it is desirable to keep him out. What provisions  must be made to accomplish this, i.e., to secure the safety of the  harbors and the millions of dollars' worth of destructible property  concentrated at the great trade centers that are usually located upon  those harbors? We must first take a look at the enemy and see what he  is like before we can decide what will be needed to repel his attack.  For this purpose we need not draw on the imagination, but we may  simply examine some of the more recent armadas sent to bombard  seaports. For example, the fleet sent by Great Britain to bombard the  Egyptian city of Alexandria, in 1882. This fleet consisted of eight  heavy ironclad ships of from 5,000 to 11,000 tons displacement and  five or six smaller vessels; and the armament of this squadron  numbered more than one hundred guns of all calibers, from the sixteen  inch rifle down to the seven inch rifle, besides several smaller guns.  But this fleet represented only a small fraction of England's naval  power. During some recent evolutions she turned out thirty-six heavy  ironclads and forty smaller vessels and torpedo boats. The crews of  these vessels numbered nearly 19,000 officers and men, or about three  times the entire number in our navy. Such a fleet, or, more likely, a  much larger one, might appear at the entrance say of New York harbor  within ten days after a declaration of war, and demand whatever the  nation to which it belonged might choose, with the alternative of  bombardment.    The problem of protecting our people and property from such attacks is  not a new one, and, in fact, most of the conditions of this problem  remain the same as they were fifty years ago, the differences being in  degree rather than in kind. The most natural thought would be to meet  such a fleet by another fleet, but the folly of such a course will  become apparent from a moment's consideration. The difficulties would  be:    1st. Our fleet must be decidedly stronger than that of the enemy, or  we simply fight a duel with an equal chance of success or failure.    2d. In such a duel the enemy would risk nothing but the loss of his  fleet, and even a portion of that would be likely to escape, but we  would not only risk a similar loss, but we would also lose the city or  subject it to the payment of a heavy contribution to the enemy.    3d. Unless we have a fleet for every harbor, it would be impossible to  depend upon this kind of defense, as the enemy would select whichever  harbor he found least prepared to receive him. It would be of vital  importance that we defend every harbor of importance, as a neglect to  do so would be like locking some of our doors and leaving the others  open to the burglars.    4th. It might be thought that we could send our fleet to intercept the  enemy or blockade him in his own ports, but this has been found  impracticable. Large fleets can readily escape from blockaded harbors,  or elude each other on the high seas, and any such scheme implies that  we are much stronger on the ocean than the enemy, which is very far  from the case. To build a navy that would overmatch that of Great  Britain alone would not only cost untold millions, but it would  require many years for its accomplishment; and even if this were done,  there would be nothing unusual in an alliance of two or more powerful  nations, which would leave us again in the minority. _Fleets, then,  cannot be relied on for permanent defense_.    Again, it may be said that we have millions of the bravest soldiers in  the world who could be assembled and placed under arms at a few days'  notice. This kind of defense would also prove a delusion, for a  hundred acres of soldiers armed with rifles and field artillery would  be powerless to drive away even the smallest ironclad or stop a single  projectile from one. In fact, neither of these plans, nor both  together, would be much more effective than the windmills and  proclamations which Irving humorously describes as the means adopted  by the early Dutch governors of New York to defend that city against  the Swedes and Yankees.    Having considered some of the means of defense that will _not_ answer  the purpose, we may inquire what means _will be_ effective. And here  it should be noted that our defenses should be so effective as not  only to be reasonably safe, but to be so recognized by all nations,  and thus discourage, if not actually prevent, an attack upon our  coast.    In the first place, we must have heavy guns in such numbers and of  such sizes as to overmatch those of any fleet likely to attack us.  These guns must be securely mounted, so as to be worked with facility  and accuracy, and they must be protected from the enemy's projectiles  at least as securely as his guns are from ours. Merely placing  ourselves on equal terms with the enemy, as in case of a duel or an  ancient knight's tournament, will not answer, first, because such a  state of things would invite rather than discourage attack, and  secondly, because the enemy would have vastly more to gain by success  and vastly less to lose by failure than we would. This can be  accomplished much easier than is generally supposed, either by earthen  parapets of sufficient thickness or by iron turrets or casements. It  is evident that the weight of metal used in these structures may be  vastly greater than could be carried on shipboard. Great weight of  metal is no objection on land, but, aside from its cost, is a positive  advantage. This is evident when we consider the enormous quantity of  energy stored in the larger projectiles moving at high velocities. For  example, we often hear of the sixteen inch rifle whose projectile  weighs about one ton, and this enormous mass projected at a velocity  of 2,000 feet per second would have a kinetic energy of 60,000 foot  tons, or it would strike a blow equal to that of ten locomotives of 50  tons each running at 60 miles an hour and striking a solid wall. Any  structure designed to resist such ponderous blows must, therefore,  have enormous weight, or it will be overturned or driven bodily from  its foundations. If the armor itself is not thick enough to give the  required weight as well as resistance to penetration, the additional  stability must be supplied by re-enforcing it with heavy masses of  metal or masonry. It is evident, therefore, that _quality_ of metal is  less important than _quantity_, and that so long as it is sufficiently  tough to resist fracture, a soft, cheap metal, like wrought iron or  low steel, is better adapted for permanent works than any of the fancy  kinds of armor that have been tested for naval purposes. As an  illustration of this, we may compare compound or steel-faced armor  with wrought iron as follows: The best of the former offers only about  one-third greater resistance to penetration than the latter, or 12  inches of compound armor may equal 16 inches of wrought iron, but the  cost per ton is nearly double; so that by using wrought iron we may  have double the thickness, or 24 inches, which would give more than  double the resistance to penetration, in addition to giving double the  stability against overturning or being driven bodily out of place. But  our guns may be reasonably well protected by earthen parapets without  any expensive armor by so mounting them that when fired they will  recoil downward or to one side, so as to come below the parapet for  loading. This method of mounting is called the disappearing principle,  and has been suggested by many engineers, some of whose designs date  back more than one hundred years. We may also mount our guns in deep  pits, where they will be covered from the enemy's guns, and fire them  at high elevation, so that the shell will fall from a great height and  penetrate the decks of the enemy's ships. This is known as mortar  firing, but the modern ordnance used for this purpose is more of a  howitzer than a mortar, being simply short rifled pieces arranged for  breech loading. All our batteries should, of course, be as far from  the city or other object to be protected as possible, to prevent the  enemy from firing over and beyond the batteries into the city.    But, with all these precautions, the enemy might put on all steam and  run by us either at night or in a dense fog, and we must have some  means of holding him under the fire of our guns until his ships can be  disabled or driven away. This object is sought to be accomplished by  the use of torpedoes anchored in the channels and under the fire of  our guns, so that they cannot be removed by the enemy. These torpedoes  are generally exploded by electricity from batteries located in  casements on shore, these casements being connected with the torpedoes  by submarine cables. It is easy to see how the torpedo may be so  arranged that when struck by a ship the electric current will be  closed, and, if the battery on shore is connected at the same instant,  an explosion will take place; on the other hand, if the battery on  shore is disconnected a friendly ship may pass in safety over the  torpedoes. Many ingenious contrivances have also been devised by which  the torpedo may be made to signal back to the shore"]]]
