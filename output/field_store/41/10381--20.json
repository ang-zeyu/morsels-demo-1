It was from these heroic sagas for the most part,  though not wholly, that the _myths_ or plots of not only AEschylus but  also Sophocles and Euripides, and a host of other writers whose plays  are lost to us, are taken. The new wine that was poured into the old  bottles of the _dromena_ at the Spring Festival was the heroic saga. We  know as an historical fact, the name of the man who was mainly  responsible for this inpouring--the great democratic tyrant  Peisistratos. We must look for a moment at what Peisistratos found, and  then pass to what he did.    He found an ancient Spring _dromenon_, perhaps well-nigh effete. Without  destroying the old he contrived to introduce the new, to add to the old  plot of Summer and Winter the life-stories of heroes, and thereby arose  the drama.    Let us look first, then, at what Peisistratos found.    The April festival of Dionysos at which the great dramas were performed  was not the earliest festival of the god. Thucydides[37] expressly tells  us that on the 12th day of the month Anthesterion, that is in the quite  early spring, at the turn of our February and March, were celebrated  _the more ancient Dionysia_. It was a three-days' festival.[38] On the  first day, called \"Cask-opening,\" the jars of new wine were broached.  Among the Boeotians the day was called not the day of Dionysos, but the  day of the Good or Wealthy Daimon. The next day was called the day of  the \"Cups\"--there was a contest or _agon_ of drinking. The last day was  called the \"Pots,\" and it, too, had its \"Pot-Contests.\" It is the  ceremonies of this day that we must notice a little in detail; for they  are very surprising. \"Casks,\" \"Cups,\" and \"Pots,\" sound primitive  enough. \"Casks\" and \"Cups\" go well with the wine-god, but the \"Pots\"  call for explanation.    The second day of the \"Cups,\" joyful though it sounds, was by the  Athenians counted unlucky, because on that day they believed \"the ghosts  of the dead rose up.\" The sanctuaries were roped in, each householder  anointed his door with pitch, that the ghost who tried to enter might  catch and stick there. Further, to make assurance doubly sure, from  early dawn he chewed a bit of buckthorn, a plant of strong purgative  powers, so that, if a ghost should by evil chance go down his throat, it  should at least be promptly expelled.    For two, perhaps three, days of constant anxiety and ceaseless  precautions the ghosts fluttered about Athens. Men's hearts were full of  nameless dread, and, as we shall see, hope. At the close of the third  day the ghosts, or, as the Greeks called them, _Keres_, were bidden to  go. Some one, we do not know whom, it may be each father of a household,  pronounced the words: \"Out of the door, ye Keres; it is no longer  Anthesteria,\" and, obedient, the Keres were gone.    But before they went there was a supper for these souls. All the  citizens cooked a _panspermia_ or \"Pot-of-all-Seeds,\" but of this  Pot-of-all-Seeds no citizen tasted. It was made over to the spirits of  the under-world and Hermes their daimon, Hermes \"Psychopompos,\"  Conductor, Leader of the dead.           *       *       *       *       *    We have seen how a forest people, dependent on fruit trees and berries  for their food, will carry a maypole and imagine a tree-spirit. But a  people of agriculturists will feel and do and think quite otherwise;  they will look, not to the forest but to the earth for their returning  life and food; they will sow seeds and wait for their sprouting, as in  the gardens of Adonis. Adonis seems to have passed through the two  stages of Tree-Spirit and Seed-Spirit; his effigy was sometimes a tree  cut down, sometimes his planted \"Gardens.\" Now seeds are many,  innumerable, and they are planted in the earth, and a people who bury  their dead know, or rather feel, that the earth is dead man's land. So,  when they prepare a pot of seeds on their All Souls' Day, it is not  really or merely as a \"supper for the souls,\" though it may be that  kindly notion enters. The ghosts have other work to do than to eat their  supper and go. They take that supper \"of all seeds,\" that _panspermia_,  with them down to the world below, that they may tend it and foster it  and bring it back in autumn as a pot of _all fruits_, a _pankarpia_.         \"Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die.\"    The dead, then, as well as the living--this is for us the important  point--had their share in the _dromena_ of the \"more ancient Dionysia.\"  These agricultural spring _dromena_ were celebrated just outside the  ancient city gates, in the _agora_, or place of assembly, on a circular  dancing-place, near to a very primitive sanctuary of Dionysos which was  opened only once in the year, at the Feast of Cups. Just outside the  gates was celebrated yet another festival of Dionysos equally primitive,  called the \"Dionysia in the Fields.\" It had the form though not the date  of our May Day festival. Plutarch[39] thus laments over the \"good old  times\": \"In ancient days,\" he says, \"our fathers used to keep the feast  of Dionysos in homely, jovial fashion. There was a procession, a jar of  wine and a _branch_; then some one dragged in a goat, another followed  bringing a wicker basket of figs, and, to crown all, the phallos.\" It  was just a festival of the fruits of the whole earth: wine and the  basket of figs and the branch for vegetation, the goat for animal life,  the phallos for man. No thought here of the dead, it is all for the  living and his food.           *       *       *       *       *    Such sanctities even a great tyrant might not tamper with. But if you  may not upset the old you may without irreverence add the new.  Peisistratos probably cared little for, and believed less in, magical  ceremonies for the renewal of fruits, incantations of the dead. We can  scarcely picture him chewing buckthorn on the day of the \"Cups,\" or  anointing his front door with pitch to keep out the ghosts. Very wisely  he left the Anthesteria and the kindred festival \"in the fields\" where  and as they were. But for his own purposes he wanted to do honour to  Dionysos, and also above all things to enlarge and improve the rites  done in the god's honour, so, leaving the old sanctuary to its fate, he  built a new temple on the south side of the Acropolis where the present  theatre now stands, and consecrated to the god a new and more splendid  precinct.    He did not build the present theatre, we must always remember that. The  rows of stone seats, the chief priest's splendid marble chair, were not  erected till two centuries later. What Peisistratos did was to build a  small stone temple (see Fig. 2), and a great round orchestra of stone  close beside it. Small fragments of the circular foundation can still be  seen. The spectators sat on the hill-side or on wooden seats; there was  as yet no permanent _the{-a}tron_ or spectator-place, still less a stone  stage; the _dromena_ were done on the dancing-place. But for  spectator-place they had the south slope of the Acropolis. What kind of  wooden stage they had unhappily we cannot tell. It may be that only a  portion of the orchestra was marked off.           *       *       *       *       *    Why did Peisistratos, if he cared little for magic and ancestral ghosts,  take such trouble to foster and amplify the worship of this  maypole-spirit, Dionysos? Why did he add to the Anthesteria, the  festival of the family ghosts and the peasant festival \"in the fields,\"  a new and splendid festival, a little later in the spring, the _Great  Dionysia_, or _Dionysia of the City_? One reason among others was  this--Peisistratos was a \"tyrant.\"    Now a Greek \"tyrant\" was not in our sense \"tyrannical.\" He took his own  way, it is true, but that way was to help and serve the common people.  The tyrant was usually raised to his position by the people, and he  stood for democracy, for trade and industry, as against an idle  aristocracy. It was but a rudimentary democracy, a democratic tyranny,  the power vested in one man, but it stood for the rights of the many as  against the few. Moreover, Dionysos was always of the people, of the  \"working classes,\" just as the King and Queen of the May are now. The  upper classes worshipped then, as now, not the Spirit of Spring but  _their own ancestors_. But--and this was what Peisistratos with great  insight saw--Dionysos must be transplanted from the fields to the city.  The country is always conservative, the natural stronghold of a landed  aristocracy, with fixed traditions; the city with its closer contacts  and consequent swifter changes, and, above all, with its acquired, not  inherited, wealth, tends towards democracy. Peisistratos left the  Dionysia \"in the fields,\" but he added the Great Dionysia \"in the city.\"    Peisistratos was not the only tyrant who concerned himself with the  _dromena_ of Dionysos. Herodotos[40] tells the story of another tyrant,  a story which is like a window opening suddenly on a dark room. At  Sicyon, a town near Corinth, there was in the _agora_ a _heroon_, a  hero-tomb, of an Argive hero, Adrastos.    \"The Sicyonians,\" says Herodotos, \"paid other honours to Adrastos, and,  moreover, they celebrated his death and disasters with tragic choruses,  not honouring Dionysos but Adrastos.\" We think of \"tragic\" choruses as  belonging exclusively to the theatre and Dionysos; so did Herodotus, but  clearly here they belonged to a local hero. His adventures and his death  were commemorated by choral dances and songs. Now when Cleisthenes  became tyrant of Sicyon he felt that the cult of the local hero was a  danger. What did he do? Very adroitly he brought in from Thebes another  hero as rival to Adrastos. He then split up the worship of Adrastos;  part of his worship, and especially his sacrifices, he gave to the new  Theban hero, but the tragic choruses he gave to the common people's god,  to Dionysos. Adrastos,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17132"],[0,"The Makers of Canada: Champlain (#17)"],[1,"the establishment of that faith. Even the  bad example of the French might be prejudicial, if those who had  authority in the country did not establish order.    The mission among such numerous nations would be painful and laborious,  and so could advance but little unless they obtained from the gentlemen  of the company a greater number of missionaries free of expense. Even  then it would require many years and great labour to humanize these  utterly gross and barbarous nations, and even when this end was  partially attained, the sacrament, for fear of profanation, could be  administered only to an exceptional few among the adults.    It finally appears to have been decided that they could not make  progress unless the colony was increased by a greater number of  settlers, mechanics and farmers; that free trade with the Indians should  be permitted, without distinction, to all Frenchmen; that in future  Huguenots should be excluded, and that it was necessary to render the  Indians sedentary, and bring them up to a knowledge of French manners  and laws.    The council further agreed that by the help of zealous persons in  France, a seminary ought to be established in order to bring to  Christianity, young Indians, who might afterwards aid the missionaries  in converting their countrymen. It was deemed necessary to maintain the  missions which the fathers had established both up and down the river.  This could not be done unless the associated gentlemen showed all the  ardour to be expected from their zeal when informed of all things  faithfully, instead of being deluded by the reports of the clerks whom  they had sent the year before; the governor and the fathers having no  ground to be satisfied therewith.    Champlain, who intended to return to France, desired the father  commissary and Father Le Caron to accompany him, in order that the  resolutions of the council might be submitted to the king for his  approval, and with a view of obtaining substantial assistance. The  voyage was a pleasant one, and Champlain and his party arrived at  Honfleur on September 10th, 1616.    The merchants whom they interviewed at Paris were ready to promise to  support the mission, but nothing was realized from their promises, and  it soon became apparent that they cared more about the fur trade than  about religion. Champlain saw many people who he believed could assist  the settlement, but the winter was passed in useless negotiations. He  therefore prepared a greater shipment than usual from his own resources,  and he was fortunate in finding that his old friend, Louis Hebert, an  apothecary of Port Royal, was willing to accompany him. Hebert took his  family with him, composed of three children and his wife, named Marie  Rollet. Hebert afterwards rendered very valuable assistance to the  founder of Quebec.    Father Jamet did not return to Quebec, and he was therefore replaced as  commissary by Father Le Caron, who appointed Father Huet as his  assistant. The vessel conveying the party sailed from Honfleur on April  11th, 1617, under the command of Captain Morel. The passage was very  rough, and when within sixty leagues of the Great Bank of Newfoundland,  numerous icebergs bore down on the ship like huge mountains. Father Le  Clercq says that in the general consternation Father Joseph, seeing that  all human succour could not deliver them from shipwreck, earnestly  implored the aid of heaven in the vows and prayers which he made  publicly on the vessel. He confessed all, and prepared himself to appear  before God. All were touched with compassion and deeply moved when Dame  Hebert raised her youngest child through the hatchway to let it share  with the rest the good father's blessing. They escaped only by a  miracle, as they acknowledged in their letters to France.    The ship arrived at Tadousac on July 14th, and mass was said in a little  chapel which Father Huet had constructed with poles and branches, and a  sailor stood on either side of the altar with fir branches to drive away  the cloud of mosquitoes which caused great annoyance to the celebrant.  The mass was very solemn. Besides the French, there were many Indians  present who assisted with devotion amid the roar of the cannon of the  ship, and the muskets of the French. After the service a dinner was  given by Champlain on board the vessel. On the arrival of the party at  Quebec some days after, they found that the inhabitants were nearly  starving, and that Father d'Olbeau was anxiously awaiting the news from  France.    Both Champlain and Father Le Caron were obliged to confess that their  mission had been unsuccessful. What, therefore, was to be done? To  return to Old France would have been contrary to the intentions of the  Recollets. They had been sent to Canada by their superiors, and they had  no order to act contrary to their instructions. After having studied the  situation they resolved that Father d'Olbeau should visit France, see  the king in person, and place before him the settlers' condition and  their own. During his absence Father Huet undertook the charge of the  mission at Tadousac, and Brother Pacifique du Plessis was appointed to  teach catechism to the Indians of Three Rivers.    It was at about this time that Father Le Caron performed the first  marriage ceremony in Canada, the contracting parties being Etienne  Jonquest of Normandy, and Anne Hebert, eldest daughter of Louis Hebert.    The condition of the Recollets at this time was unenviable. The agents  of the merchants were not better disposed towards them than the  interpreters. Some of these agents were demoralized, and the reproach  that they received from the fathers caused them to avoid their presence.  The conduct of some of these agents was so bad that even the Indians,  who were not strict in their morals, were scandalized. When we take into  consideration these circumstances, and the meagreness of the resources  of the order, and the difficulties they had in acquiring the language,  we can form a faint idea of the hardness of their lot, and it was not  without just cause that they decided to send Father d'Olbeau to France  with Champlain, in order that the true state of affairs might be urged  still further before the king.    Father Le Clercq says: \"Meanwhile Monsieur de Champlain employed all his  address and prudence, and the intrigues of his friends to obtain what  was necessary for the establishment of his new colony. Father d'Olbeau,  on his side, spared nothing; both spoke frequently to the members of the  company, but in vain, for these people, who always had their ears open  to flattering tales of the great profit to be made in the Indian trade,  closed them to the requests and entreaties made them. They therefore  contented themselves with what they could get.\"    Father d'Olbeau at length received some consolation and compensation for  all his labours, when a bull was issued by the pope, granting a jubilee  to New France, which was celebrated at Quebec on July 29th, 1618, and  was the first of its kind. For the celebration of this religious  festival, the Recollets had built some huts, which were used as  stations, and French and Indians proceeded from one of those improvised  chapels to the other, singing the psalms and hymns of the church. In the  year 1618, the Recollets in New France were only three in number:  Fathers Le Caron and d'Olbeau, and Friar Modeste Guines.    During the winter of 1617-18 the missionaries were called upon to decide  a difficult question. Two Frenchmen had disappeared in 1616, and the  discovery of their bones proved that they had been murdered. A diligent  search was instituted which led to the detection of the murderer, who  acknowledged his crime. The question of punishment, however, was  difficult from the fact that a clerk named Beauchesne, who had been  invested with extensive civil power by Champlain, was in the habit of  receiving gifts from the Indians. It was consequently considered  dangerous to do anything that would displease the Indians, as they were  known to be terrible in their vengeance. The Recollets had strongly  protested against this method of receiving gifts, which placed the  settlement in a false position towards the Indians. It was finally  decided to release the prisoner and to accept as hostages two young  Indians. When the matter was brought before Champlain, he approved of  the course adopted, and stated that it was not a wise policy to be too  severe.    This affair, which at one time appeared likely to produce disagreeable  consequences, passed over without event, and some time after a party of  Indians visited Quebec for the purpose of effecting a complete  reconciliation. Thus, when Champlain left for France in 1618, the colony  was secure.    Father Huet, who accompanied Champlain, was charged with many important  missions, one of which related to the administration of baptism to the  Indians. They were quite willing to be baptized, but they had no idea of  the nature of the sacrament, and although they promised to keep their  vows before the ceremony, they soon returned to their old superstitions.  Their want of sincerity was a trial to Father Huet, and he desired to  have the opinion of the Doctors of the Sorbonne to guide him in his  future actions.    During the winter Father Le Caron went to Tadousac in order to continue  the work of Father d'Olbeau, and he remained there until the middle of  July, 1619. In the interval he had built a residence upon the ground  donated by the merchants, and had the satisfaction of leaving one  hundred and forty neophytes as the result of the labours of the mission.  Father d'Olbeau had his residence at Quebec.    On his return to Canada Father Huet was accompanied by Father Guillaume  Poullain, three friars and two labourers. Champlain did not return this  year. The Recollets had received authority to build a convent at Quebec,  and the Prince de Conde"]]]
