Why it was impossible for Charles to keep his word may be read in  Clarendon's _Life_, and in the history of the Savoy Conference, and need  not be restated here. In the opinion of the Anglican clergy, the king's  divine right stood no higher than their own. They too had suffered in  exile. They had been \"robbed\" of their tithes, and turned out of their  palaces, rectories and vicarages, and excluded from the churches they  still called \"theirs.\" Their Book of Common Prayer was no longer in  common use, having been banished by the \"Directory of Public Worship\"  since 1645. So late as July 1, 1660, Pepys records attending a service  in the Abbey, and adds \"No Common Prayer yet.\" If we find ourselves  wondering why the Anglican party should have been so powerful in 1660,  our wonder ought not to be greater than is excited by the power of the  Puritan party when Laud was put to death. Both parties were, on each  occasion, in a minority. Though England has never been long  priest-ridden, it has often been priest-led.    The Convention Parliament did all that was expected of it. It was,  however irregularly summoned, a truly representative assembly. Its  members all swore--what will not members of Parliament swear?--that the  king was supreme in Church and State, the only rightful king of the  realm and of all other his dominions, and that from their hearts they  abhorred, detested, and abjured the damnable doctrine that princes,  excommunicated or deprived of the Pope, might be murdered by their  subjects. They proceeded to pass a very useful Act of Indemnity and  Oblivion, agreeing to let bygones be bygones, except in certain named  cases. They ordered Mr. John Milton to be taken into custody, and  prosecuted (which he never was) by the Attorney-General. Later on the  poet was released from custody, and we find Mr. Marvell complaining to  the House that their sergeant had extracted L150 in fees before he would  let Mr. Milton go. On which Sir Heneage Finch, afterwards Lord  Chancellor, laconically observed that Milton deserved hanging. He  certainly got off easily, but, as he lived to publish _Paradise Lost_,  _Paradise Regained_, and _Samson Agonistes_, he may be said to have  earned his freedom. All his poetry put together never brought him in a  third of the sum the sergeant got for letting him out of prison. General  Monk, the man-midwife, who so skilfully assisted at that great Birth of  Time, the Restoration, was made a duke, and Cromwell's army, so long the  force behind the supreme power, was paid its arrears and (two regiments  excepted) disbanded. \"Fifty thousand men,\" says Macaulay, \"accustomed to  the profession of arms, were thrown upon the world ... in a few months  there remained not a trace indicating that the most formidable army in  the world had just been absorbed in the mass of the community.\"[92:1]    After this the House of Commons fell to discussing religion, and made  the sad discovery that differences of opinion still existed. In these  circumstances they decided to refer the matter to their pious king, and  to such divines as he might choose. They then voted large sums of money  for the royal establishment, and, it being the very end of August,  adjourned till the 6th of November. As for making constitutional terms  with the king, they never attempted it, though Sir Matthew Hale is  credited with an attempt to induce them to do so. Any proposals of the  kind must have failed. The people were in no mood for making  constitutions.    Having met again on the 6th of November, Marvell, in a letter to the  Mayor and Aldermen of Hull, dated the 27th of the month, reports that  \"the House fell upon the making out of the King's revenue to L1,200,000  a year.\" \"The Customs are estimated toward L500,000 per annum in the  revenue. His lands and fee farms L250,000. The Excise of Beer and Ale  L300,000, the rest arise out of the Post Office, Wine Licenses,  Stannaries Court, Probate of Wills, Post-fines, Forests, and other  rights of the Crown. The excise of Foreign Commodities is to be  continued apart until satisfaction of public debts and engagements  secured upon the excise.\"    This settlement of revenue marks \"the beginning of a time.\" Cromwell, as  Cowley puts it in his _Discourse_, by far the ablest indictment of  Oliver ever penned, \"took armes against two hundred thousand pounds a  year, and raised them himself to above two millions.\" It is true.  Cromwell spent the money honestly and efficiently, and chiefly on a navy  that enabled him to wrest the command of the sea from the Dutch, to  secure the carrying trade, and to challenge the world for supremacy in  the Indies, both East and West. In doing this, he had the instinct of  the whole nation behind him. But it was expensive.    Had Charles been the most honest and thrifty of men, instead of one of  the most dishonest and extravagant, he must have found his financial  position a very difficult one. He was poorer than Cromwell. The feudal  taxation had fallen into desuetude. To revive wardships, etc., was  impossible, to recover arrears hopeless. There was nothing for it but  scientific taxation. One of his first Acts contains a schedule of taxed  articles extending over fifteen double-columned pages of a quarto  volume. To raise this revenue was difficult--in fact impossible, and the  amount actually obtained was always far below the estimates.    Marvell's letter concludes thus:--       \"To-morrow is the Bill for enacting his Majesty's declaration in     religious matters and to have its first reading. It is said that on     Sunday next Doctor Reynolds shall be created Bishop of Norwich.\"    The rumour about Reynolds's bishopric proved to be true. The new bishop  was a very \"moderate\" Anglican indeed, and his appointment was meant as  a sop to the Presbyterians. Richard Baxter and Edmund Calamy refused  similar preferment.    On the 29th of November Marvell's letter contains the following  passage:--       \"Yesterday the Bill of the King's Declaration in religious matters     was read for the first time; but upon the question for a second     reading 'twas carried 183 against 157 in the negative, so there is an     end of that Bill and for those excellent things therein. We must     henceforth rely only upon his Majesty's goodness, who, I must needs     say, hath hitherto been more ready to give than we to receive.\"    It is a noticeable feature of this correspondence that Marvell seldom  mentions which way he voted himself.    The letter of the 4th of December contains some interesting matter:--       \"GENTLEMEN,--Since my last, upon Thursday, the Bill for Vicarages     hath been carryed up to the Lords; and a Message to them from our     House that they would expedite the Bill for confirmation of Magna     Charta, that for confirmation of marriages, and other bills of     publick concernment, which haue laid by them euer since our last     sitting, not returned to us. We had then the Bill for six moneths     assesment in consideration, and read the Bill for taking away Court     of Wards and Purveyance, and establishing the moiety of the Excise     of Beere and ale in perpetuum, about which we sit euery afternoon in     a Grand Committee. Upon Sunday last were consecrated in the Abby at     Westminster, Doctor Cossins, Bishop of Durham, Sterne of Carlile,     Gauden of Exeter, Ironside of Bristow, Loyd of Landaffe, Lucy of St.     Dauids, Lany, the seuenth, whose diocese I remember not at present,     and to-day they keep their feast in Haberdasher's hall, in London.     Dr. Reinolds was not of the number, who is intended for Norwich. A     Congedelire is gone down to Hereford for Dr. Monk, the Generall's     brother, at present Provost of Eaton. 'Tis thought that since our     throwing out the Bill of the King's Declaration, Mr. Calamy, and     other moderate men, will be resolute in refusing of Bishopricks....     To-day our House was upon the Bill of Attainder of those that haue     been executed, those that are fled, and of Cromwell, Bradshaw,     Ireton, and Pride, and 'tis ordered that the carkasses and coffins     of the four last named, shall be drawn with what expedition     possible, upon an hurdle to Tyburn, there (to) be hanged up for a     while, and then buryed under the gallows....       \"WESTMINSTER, _Dec. 4, 1660_.\"    Marvell's cool reporting of the hideous indignity inflicted upon his old  master, and allowing it to pass _sub silentio_, is one of the many  occasions that stirred Mr. Grosart's wonder. Nerves were tough in those  days. Pepys tells us unconcernedly enough how, after seeing Lord  Southampton sworn in at the Court of Exchequer as Lord Treasurer, he  noticed \"the heads of Cromwell, Bradshaw, and Ireton set up at the  further end of Westminster Hall.\" It is quite possible Lady Fauconberg  may have seen the same sight.[95:1]    The Convention Parliament was dissolved on the 29th of December 1660.    On 1st April 1661 Marvell was returned for the third and last time for  Hull, for Charles the Second's first Parliament was of unconscionable  long duration, not being dissolved till January 1679, after Marvell's  death. It is known in history as the Pensionary or Long Parliament. The  election figures were as below:--            Colonel Gilbey,       294          Mr. Andrew Marvell,   240          Mr. Edward Barnard,   195          Mr. John Ramsden,     122    Marvell was not present at or before the election, for on the 6th of  April he writes:--       \"I perceive by Mr. Mayor that you have again (as if it were grown a     thing of course) made choice of me now, the third time, to serve for     you in Parliament, which as I cannot attribute to anything but your     constancy, so shall I, God willing, as in gratitude obliged, with no     less constancy and vigour continue to execute your commands and study     your service.\"    A word may here be said about payment of borough members. The members'  fee"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17396"],[0,"The Secret Garden (#17)"],[1,"\"Aye! how could it!\" he murmured. \"With th' door locked an' th' key  buried.\"    Mistress Mary always felt that however many years she lived she should  never forget that first morning when her garden began to grow. Of  course, it did seem to begin to grow for her that morning. When Dickon  began to clear places to plant seeds, she remembered what Basil had sung  at her when he wanted to tease her.    \"Are there any flowers that look like bells?\" she inquired.    \"Lilies o' th' valley does,\" he answered, digging away with the trowel,  \"an' there's Canterbury bells, an' campanulas.\"    \"Let us plant some,\" said Mary.    \"There's lilies o' th' valley here already; I saw 'em. They'll have  growed too close an' we'll have to separate 'em, but there's plenty. Th'  other ones takes two years to bloom from seed, but I can bring you some  bits o' plants from our cottage garden. Why does tha' want 'em?\"    Then Mary told him about Basil and his brothers and sisters in India and  of how she had hated them and of their calling her \"Mistress Mary Quite  Contrary.\"    \"They used to dance round and sing at me. They sang--              'Mistress Mary, quite contrary,                How does your garden grow?             With silver bells, and cockle shells,                And marigolds all in a row.'    I just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowers  like silver bells.\"    She frowned a little and gave her trowel a rather spiteful dig into the  earth.    \"I wasn't as contrary as they were.\"    But Dickon laughed.    \"Eh!\" he said, and as he crumbled the rich black soil she saw he was  sniffing up the scent of it, \"there doesn't seem to be no need for no  one to be contrary when there's flowers an' such like, an' such lots o'  friendly wild things runnin' about makin' homes for themselves, or  buildin' nests an' singin' an' whistlin', does there?\"    Mary, kneeling by him holding the seeds, looked at him and stopped  frowning.    \"Dickon,\" she said. \"You are as nice as Martha said you were. I like  you, and you make the fifth person. I never thought I should like five  people.\"    Dickon sat up on his heels as Martha did when she was polishing the  grate. He did look funny and delightful, Mary thought, with his round  blue eyes and red cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose.    \"Only five folk as tha' likes?\" he said. \"Who is th' other four?\"    \"Your mother and Martha,\" Mary checked them off on her fingers, \"and the  robin and Ben Weatherstaff.\"    Dickon laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the sound by putting his  arm over his mouth.    \"I know tha' thinks I'm a queer lad,\" he said, \"but I think tha' art th'  queerest little lass I ever saw.\"    Then Mary did a strange thing. She leaned forward and asked him a  question she had never dreamed of asking any one before. And she tried  to ask it in Yorkshire because that was his language, and in India a  native was always pleased if you knew his speech.    \"Does tha' like me?\" she said.    \"Eh!\" he answered heartily, \"that I does. I likes thee wonderful, an' so  does th' robin, I do believe!\"    \"That's two, then,\" said Mary. \"That's two for me.\"    And then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully. Mary was  startled and sorry when she heard the big clock in the courtyard strike  the hour of her midday dinner.    \"I shall have to go,\" she said mournfully. \"And you will have to go too,  won't you?\"    Dickon grinned.    \"My dinner's easy to carry about with me,\" he said. \"Mother always lets  me put a bit o' somethin' in my pocket.\"    He picked up his coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a lumpy  little bundle tied up in a quiet clean, coarse, blue and white  handkerchief. It held two thick pieces of bread with a slice of  something laid between them.    \"It's oftenest naught but bread,\" he said, \"but I've got a fine slice o'  fat bacon with it to-day.\"    Mary thought it looked a queer dinner, but he seemed ready to enjoy it.    \"Run on an' get thy victuals,\" he said. \"I'll be done with mine first.  I'll get some more work done before I start back home.\"    He sat down with his back against a tree.    \"I'll call th' robin up,\" he said, \"and give him th' rind o' th' bacon  to peck at. They likes a bit o' fat wonderful.\"    Mary could scarcely bear to leave him. Suddenly it seemed as if he might  be a sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she came into the garden  again. He seemed too good to be true. She went slowly half-way to the  door in the wall and then she stopped and went back.    \"Whatever happens, you--you never would tell?\" she said.    His poppy-colored cheeks were distended with his first big bite of bread  and bacon, but he managed to smile encouragingly.    \"If tha' was a missel thrush an' showed me where thy nest was, does tha'  think I'd tell any one? Not me,\" he said. \"Tha' art as safe as a missel  thrush.\"    And she was quite sure she was.          CHAPTER XII    \"MIGHT I HAVE A BIT OF EARTH?\"      Mary ran so fast that she was rather out of breath when she reached her  room. Her hair was ruffled on her forehead and her cheeks were bright  pink. Her dinner was waiting on the table, and Martha was waiting near  it.    \"Tha's a bit late,\" she said. \"Where has tha' been?\"    \"I've seen Dickon!\" said Mary. \"I've seen Dickon!\"    \"I knew he'd come,\" said Martha exultantly. \"How does tha' like him?\"    \"I think--I think he's beautiful!\" said Mary in a determined voice.    Martha looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased, too.    \"Well,\" she said, \"he's th' best lad as ever was born, but us never  thought he was handsome. His nose turns up too much.\"    \"I like it to turn up,\" said Mary.    \"An' his eyes is so round,\" said Martha, a trifle doubtful. \"Though  they're a nice color.\"    \"I like them round,\" said Mary. \"And they are exactly the color of the  sky over the moor.\"    Martha beamed with satisfaction.    \"Mother says he made 'em that color with always lookin' up at th' birds  an' th' clouds. But he has got a big mouth, hasn't he, now?\"    \"I love his big mouth,\" said Mary obstinately. \"I wish mine were just  like it.\"    Martha chuckled delightedly.    \"It'd look rare an' funny in thy bit of a face,\" she said. \"But I knowed  it would be that way when tha' saw him. How did tha' like th' seeds an'  th' garden tools?\"    \"How did you know he brought them?\" asked Mary.    \"Eh! I never thought of him not bringin' 'em. He'd be sure to bring 'em  if they was in Yorkshire. He's such a trusty lad.\"    Mary was afraid that she might begin to ask difficult questions, but she  did not. She was very much interested in the seeds and gardening tools,  and there was only one moment when Mary was frightened. This was when  she began to ask where the flowers were to be planted.    \"Who did tha' ask about it?\" she inquired.    \"I haven't asked anybody yet,\" said Mary, hesitating.    \"Well, I wouldn't ask th' head gardener. He's too grand, Mr. Roach is.\"    \"I've never seen him,\" said Mary. \"I've only seen under-gardeners and  Ben Weatherstaff.\"    \"If I was you, I'd ask Ben Weatherstaff,\" advised Martha. \"He's not half  as bad as he looks, for all he's so crabbed. Mr. Craven lets him do what  he likes because he was here when Mrs. Craven was alive, an' he used to  make her laugh. She liked him. Perhaps he'd find you a corner somewhere  out o' the way.\"    \"If it was out of the way and no one wanted it, no one _could_ mind my  having it, could they?\" Mary said anxiously.    \"There wouldn't be no reason,\" answered Martha. \"You wouldn't do no  harm.\"    Mary ate her dinner as quickly as she could and when she rose from the  table she was going to run to her room to put on her hat again, but  Martha stopped her.    \"I've got somethin' to tell you,\" she said. \"I thought I'd let you eat  your dinner first. Mr. Craven came back this mornin' and I think he  wants to see you.\"    Mary turned quite pale.    \"Oh!\" she said. \"Why! Why! He didn't want to see me when I came. I heard  Pitcher say he didn't.\"    \"Well,\" explained Martha, \"Mrs. Medlock says it's because o' mother. She  was walkin' to Thwaite village an' she met him. She'd never spoke to him  before, but Mrs. Craven had been to our cottage two or three times. He'd  forgot, but mother hadn't an' she made bold to stop him. I don't know  what she said to him about you but she said somethin' as put him in th'  mind to see you before he goes away again, to-morrow.\"    \"Oh!\" cried Mary, \"is he going away to-morrow? I am so glad!\"    \"He's goin' for a long time. He mayn't come back till autumn or winter.  He's goin' to travel in foreign places. He's always doin' it.\"    \"Oh! I'm so glad--so glad!\" said Mary thankfully.    If he did not come back until winter, or even autumn, there would be  time to watch the secret garden come alive. Even if he found out then  and took it away from her she would have had that much at least.    \"When do you think he will want to see--\"    She did not finish the sentence, because the door opened, and Mrs.  Medlock walked in. She had on her best black dress and cap, and her  collar was fastened with a large brooch with a picture of a man's face  on it. It was a colored photograph of Mr. Medlock who had died years  ago, and she always wore it when she was dressed up. She looked nervous  and excited.    \"Your hair's rough,\" she said quickly. \"Go and brush it. Martha, help  her to slip on her best dress. Mr. Craven sent me to bring her to him in  his study.\"    All the pink left Mary's cheeks. Her heart began to thump and she felt  herself changing into a stiff, plain, silent child again. She did not  even answer Mrs. Medlock, but turned and walked into her bedroom,  followed by Martha. She said nothing while her dress was changed, and  her hair brushed, and after she was quite tidy she followed Mrs. Medlock  down the corridors, in silence. What was there for her to say? She was  obliged to go and see Mr. Craven and he would not like her,"]]]
