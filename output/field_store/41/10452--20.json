At first he thought they were  ships. Among these oysters, was one lying open. The rat perceived it.  'What do I see?' said he. 'Here is a delicate morsel for me, and if I am  not greatly mistaken, I shall have a fine dinner to-day.' So he  approached the oyster, stretched out his neck, and thrust his head  between the shells. The oyster closed, and master Nibble was caught as  effectually as if he was in a trap.\" I believe the moral of this fable  is something as follows: \"Those who have no experience in the world, are  often astonished at the smallest objects, and not unfrequently become  the dupes of their ignorance.\"    In 1776, one of the British ships engaged in the war with this country,  became infested with rats to such a degree, that they at last devoured  daily nearly a hundred weight of biscuit. They were at last destroyed,  by smoking the ship between decks, after which several bushels of them  were removed.    In the Isle of France rats are found in prodigious swarms. There were  formerly so many, that, according to some accounts, they formed the  principal cause for abandoning the island by the Dutch. In some of the  houses, thirty thousand have been known to be killed in one year.    In Egypt, when the waters of the Nile retire, after the annual overflow,  multitudes of rats and mice are seen to issue from the moistened soil.  The Egyptians believe that these animals are generated from the earth;  and some of the people assert, that they have seen the rats in a state  of formation, while one half of the bodies was flesh and the other half  mud.    The following anecdote is related by a correspondent of one of the  English newspapers: \"This morning,\" says he, \"while reading in bed, I  was suddenly interrupted by a noise similar to that made by rats, when  running through a double wainscot, and endeavoring to pierce it. The  noise ceased for some moments, and then commenced again. I was only two  or three feet from the wall whence the noise proceeded; and soon I  perceived a great rat making his appearance at a hole. It looked about  for awhile, without making any noise, and having made the observations  it wished, it retired. An instant after, I saw it come again, leading by  the ear another rat, larger than itself, and which appeared to be much  advanced in years. Having left this one at the edge of the hole, it was  joined by another young rat. The two then ran about the chamber,  collecting the crumbs of bread which had fallen from the table at supper  the previous evening, and carried them to the rat which they had left at  the edge of the hole. I was astonished at this extraordinary attention  on the part of the young rats, and continued to observe all their  motions with a great deal of care. It soon appeared clear to me that the  animal to whom the food was brought was blind, and unable to find the  bread which was placed before it, except by feeling after it. The two  younger ones were undoubtedly the offspring of the other, and they were  engaged in supplying the wants of their poor, blind parent. I admired  the wisdom of the God of nature, who has given to all animals a social  tenderness, a gratitude, I had almost said a virtue, proportionate to  their faculties. From that moment, these creatures, which I had before  abhorred, seemed to become my friends. By and by, a person opened the  door of the room, when the two young rats warned the blind one by a cry;  and in spite of their fears, they did not seek for safety themselves,  until assured that their blind parent was beyond the reach of danger.  They followed as the other retired, and served as a sort of rear-guard.\"    [Illustration: FIELD MICE.]    There are several species of mice. The engraving represents the field  mouse, an animal which sometimes makes great havoc with the farmer's  grain. The common domestic mouse is perhaps better known. He is  generally, and I think I may say justly, regarded as a pest in the house  where he becomes a tenant. But he is an interesting animal, after all. I  love to watch him--the sly little fellow--nibbling his favorite cheese,  his keen black eye looking straight at me, all the time, as if to read  by my countenance what sort of thoughts I had about his mouseship. How  much at home he always contrives to make himself in a family! How very  much at his ease he is, as he regales himself on the best things which  the house affords!    A day or two ago, a friend of mine was telling me an amusing story about  some mice with which he had the pleasure of a slight acquaintance. He  lived in the same house with a gentleman who kept a sort of bachelor's  hall, and who was a great lover of pets. This gentleman took him into  his room one day to see a mouse which he was educating to be a companion  of his lonely hours. The bachelor remarked that he had been a pensioner  for some time, that he fed him bountifully every day, and that he had  become very tame indeed. \"But,\" said the mouse's patron, \"he is an  ungrateful fellow. He is not content with eating what I give him; he  destroys every thing he can lay hold of.\" A short time after this, my  friend was called in again, when he was told by the bachelor, that, the  mouse having become absolutely intolerable by his petty larcenies and  grand larcenies, he set a trap for him and caught him. But still the  larcenies continued. He set his trap again, and caught another rogue,  and another, and another, till at last he found he had been making a pet  of thirteen mice, instead of one, as he at first supposed.    The field mouse, represented in the engraving, lays up a large store of  provisions in his nice little nest under ground, which he keeps for  winter. These mice are very particular in stowing away their winter  store. The corn, acorns, chestnuts, hickory nuts, and whatever else they  hoard up, have each separate apartments. One room contains nothing but  corn, another nothing but chestnuts, and so on. When they have exhausted  their stock of provisions before spring, and they have nothing else to  eat, they turn to, and eat one another. They are regular cannibals, if  their manners and customs have been correctly reported. Sometimes the  hogs, as they are roaming about the pasture, in the autumn, soon after a  family of field mice have laid in their provisions, and before the  ground has frozen, come across the nest, and smell the good things that  are in it. Then the poor mouse has to suffer. The author of the Boy's  Winter Book thus graphically and humorously describes the misfortunes of  such a mouse: \"There he sits huddled up in a dark corner, looking on, as  the hog is devouring the contents of his house, saying to himself, no  doubt, 'I wish it may choke you, you great, grunting brute, that I do.  There go my poor acorns, a dozen at a mouthfull. Twelve long journeys I  had to take to the foot of the old oak, where I picked them up--such a  hard day's work, that I could hardly get a wink of sleep, my bones ached  so. And now that great glutton gobbles them all up at once, and makes  nothing of it! What I shall do in the winter, I'm sure I don't know.  There goes my corn, too, which I brought, a little at a time, all the  way from the field on the other side of the woods, and with which I was  often obliged to rest, two or three times before I reached home; and  then I sometimes had to lay my load down, while I had a battle with  another field mouse, who tried to take the corn away from me, under  pretence of helping me to carry it home, which I knew well enough meant  his own nest. And after all this fighting, and slaving, and carrying  heavy loads from sunrise to sunset, here comes a pair of great, grunting  pork chaps, and make a meal from my hard earnings. Well, never mind, Mr.  Pig. It's winter now; but perhaps by next harvest time, I shall creep  into some reaper's basket, and have a taste of you, when he brings a  part of you, nicely cured and cooked, and laid lovingly between two  slices of bread and butter. I'll be even with you then, old fellow--that  I will, if I am only spared!' And so he creeps out, scarcely knowing  whether he should make up his mind to beg, borrow, or steal, half  muttering to himself, as he hops across the way, to visit some neighbor  for a breakfast, 'I declare such infamous treatment is enough to make  one dishonest, and never be industrious and virtuous any more!'\"          The Rabbit.      Friend reader, did you ever see the rabbit bounding along through the  bushes, when you have been walking in the woods? When a boy, I used  often to be amused at the gambols of the rabbits, in the woods near my  father's house. They do not run very gracefully or very fast, and a dog  easily overtakes them. It seems cruel to hunt them, and set snares for  them; and yet if they are wanted for food, doubtless there is no harm in  taking their life. The way in which I used to catch them, years ago,  when the sources of my enjoyment were widely different from what they  are at present, was by means of a box-trap with a lid to it, so adjusted  that the poor rabbit, when he undertook to nibble the apple, attached to  the spindle for a bait, sprung the trap, and made himself a prisoner.  Another method we used to employ to catch the rabbit, was something like  this: a fence was made of brush-wood, about three feet high, and  reaching some rods in length. The brush in this fence was interlaced so  closely, that rabbits and partridges could not get through except at  intervals of a few yards, where there was a door. At this door was a  noose connecting with a flexible pole, which was bent down for the  purpose. The unsuspecting rabbit, in his journeyings from place to  place, comes to the fence. He could leap over, if he should try. But he  thinks it cheaper to walk through the door, especially as there is a  choice bit of apple suspended over the entrance. Well, he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18779"],[0,"Physiology and Hygiene for Secondary Schools (#17)"],[1,". 44). At the same time the carbon dioxide which is being formed at  the cells passes into the blood. An exchange of gases is thus taking place  between the cells and the blood, similar to that taking place between the  blood and the air. This exchange is known as _internal_, or cell,  respiration. By internal respiration the oxygen reaches the place where it  is to serve its purpose, and the carbon dioxide begins its movement toward  the exterior of the body. This \"breathing by the cells\" is, therefore,  _the final and essential act of respiration_. Breathing by the lungs is  simply the means by which the taking up of oxygen and *the* giving off of  carbon dioxide by the cells is made possible.        HYGIENE OF RESPIRATORY ORGANS      The liability of the lungs to attacks from such dread diseases as  consumption and pneumonia makes questions touching their hygiene of first  importance. Consumption does not as a rule attack sound lung tissue, but  usually has its beginning in some weak or enfeebled spot in the lungs  which has lost its \"power of resistance.\" Though consumption is not  inherited, as some suppose, lung weaknesses may be transmitted from  parents to children. This, together with the fact, now generally  recognized, that consumption is contagious, accounts for the frequent  appearance of this disease in the same family. Consumption as well as  other respiratory affections can in the majority of cases be _prevented_,  and in many cases cured, by an intelligent observation of well-known laws  of health.    *Breathe through the Nostrils.*--Pure air and plenty of it is the main  condition in the hygiene of the lungs. One necessary provision for  obtaining _pure air_ is that of breathing through the nostrils. Air is the  carrier of dust particles and not infrequently of disease germs.(33)  Partly through the small hairs in the nose, but mainly through the moist  membrane that lines the passages, the nostrils serve as filters for  removing the minute solid particles (Fig. 45). While it is important that  nose breathing be observed at all times, it is especially important when  one is surrounded by a dusty or smoky atmosphere. Otherwise the small  particles that are breathed in through the mouth may find a lodging place  in the lungs.                                    [Fig. 45]        Fig. 45--*Human air filter.* Diagram of a section through the nostrils;   shows projecting bones covered with moist membrane against which the air  is made to strike by the narrow passages. 1. Air passages. 2. Cavities in           the bones. 3. Front lower portion of the cranial cavity.      In addition to removing dust particles and germs, other purposes are  served by breathing through the nostrils. The warmth and moisture which  the air receives in this way, prepare it for entering the lungs. Mouth  breathing, on the other hand, looks bad and during sleep causes snoring.  The habit of nose breathing should be established early in life.(34)    *Cultivate Full Breathing.*--Many people, while apparently taking in  sufficient air to supply their need for oxygen, do not breathe deeply  enough to \"freely ventilate the lungs.\" \"Shallow breathing,\" as this is  called, is objectionable because it fails to keep up a healthy condition  of the entire lung surface. Portions of the lungs to which air does not  easily penetrate fail to get the fresh air and exercise which they need.  As a consequence, they become weak and, by losing their \"power of  resistance,\" become points of attack in diseases of the lungs.(35) The  breathing of each individual should receive attention, and where from some  cause it is not sufficiently full and deep, the means should be found for  remedying the defect.    *Causes of Shallow Breathing.*--Anything that impedes the free movement of  air into the lungs tends to cause shallow breathing A drooping of the back  or shoulders and a curved condition of the spinal column, such as is  caused by an improper position in sitting, interfere with the free  movements of the ribs and are recognized causes. Clothing also may impede  the respiratory movements and lead to shallow breathing. If too tight  around the chest, clothing interferes with the elevation of the ribs; and  if too tight around the waist, it prevents the depression of the  diaphragm. Other causes of shallow breathing are found in the absence of  vigorous exercise, in the leading of an indoor and inactive life, in  obstructions in the nostrils and upper pharynx, and in the lack of  attention to proper methods of breathing.    To prevent shallow breathing one should have the habit of sitting and  standing erect. The clothing must not be allowed to interfere with the  respiratory movements. The taking of exercise sufficiently vigorous to  cause deep and rapid breathing should be a common practice and one should  spend considerable time out of doors. If one has a flat chest or round  shoulders, he should strive by suitable exercises to overcome these  defects. Obstructions in the nostrils or pharynx should be removed.    *Breathing Exercises.*--In overcoming the habit of shallow breathing and in  strengthening the lungs generally, the practicing of occasional deep  breathing has been found most valuable and is widely recommended. With the  hands on the hips, the shoulders drawn back and _down_, the chest pushed  upward and forward, and the chin slightly depressed, draw the air slowly  through the nostrils until the lungs are _completely_ full. After holding  this long enough to count three slowly, expel it quickly from the lungs.  Avoid straining. To get the benefit of pure air, it is generally better to  practice deep breathing out of doors or before an open window.    By combining deep breathing with simple exercises of the arms, shoulders,  and trunk much may be done towards straightening the spine, squaring the  shoulders, and overcoming flatness of the chest. Though such movements are  best carried on by the aid of a physical director, one can do much to help  himself. One may safely proceed on the principle that slight deformities  of the chest, spine, and shoulders are corrected by gaining and keeping  the natural positions, and may employ any movements which will loosen up  the parts and bring them where they naturally belong.(36)    *Serious Nature of Colds.*--That many cases of consumption have their  beginning in severe colds (on the lungs) is not only a matter of popular  belief, but the judgment also of physicians. Though the cold is a  different affection from that of consumption, it may so lower the vitality  of the body and weaken the lung surfaces that the germs of consumption  find it easy to get a start. On this account a cold on the chest which  does not disappear in a few days, but which persists, causing more or less  coughing and pain in the lungs, must be given serious consideration.(37)  The usual home remedies failing to give relief, a physician should be  consulted. It should also be noted that certain diseases of a serious  nature (pneumonia, diphtheria, measles, etc.) have in their beginning the  appearance of colds. On this account it is wise not only to call a  physician, but to call him early, in severe attacks of the lungs.  Especially if the attack be attended by difficult breathing, fever, and a  rapid pulse is the case serious and medical advice necessary.    *Ventilation.*--The process by which the air in a room is kept fresh and  pure is known as ventilation. It is a double process--that of bringing  fresh air into the room and that of getting rid of air that has been  rendered impure by breathing (38) or by lamps. Outdoor air is usually of a  different temperature (colder in winter, warmer in summer) from that  indoors, and as a consequence differs from it slightly in weight. On  account of this difference, suitable openings in the walls of buildings  induce currents which pass between the rooms and the outside atmosphere  even when there is no wind. In winter care must be taken to prevent drafts  and to avoid too great a loss of heat from the room. A cold draft may even  cause more harm to one in delicate health than the breathing of air which  is impure. To ventilate a room successfully the problem of preventing  drafts must be considered along with that of admitting the fresh air.                                    [Fig. 46]               Fig. 46--Window adjusted for ventilation without drafts.      The method of ventilation must also be adapted to the construction of the  building, the plan of heating, and the condition of the weather. Specific  directions cannot be given, but the following suggestions will be found  helpful in ventilating rooms where the air is not warmed before being  admitted:    1. _Introduce, the air through many small openings_ rather than a few  large ones. If the windows are used for this purpose, raise the lower sash  and drop the upper one _slightly_ for _several_ windows, varying the width  to suit the conditions (Fig. 46). By this means sufficient air may be  introduced without causing drafts.    2. _Introduce the air at the warmest portions of the room._ The air  should, if possible, be warmed before reaching the occupants.    3. If the wind is blowing, _ventilate principally on the sheltered side of  the house_.    Ample provision should be made for fresh air in sleeping rooms, and here  again drafts must be avoided. Especially should the bed be so placed that  strong air currents do not pass over the sleeper. In schoolhouses and  halls for public gatherings the means for efficient ventilation should, if  possible, be provided in the general plan of construction and method of  heating.
