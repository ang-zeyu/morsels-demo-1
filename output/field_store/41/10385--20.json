Please read it.  Then  you'll have to read Philip Gibbs, and Lowes Dickinson and all the young  poets.  Of course you've read Wells already.  Everybody has.\"    \"How about the Americans?\" said Titania.  \"Haven't they written  anything about the war that's worth while?\"    \"Here's one that I found a lot of meat in, streaked with philosophical  gristle,\" said Roger, relighting his pipe.  He pulled out a copy of  Professor Latimer's Progress.  \"There was one passage that I remember  marking--let's see now, what was it?--Yes, here!      \"It is true that, if you made a poll of newspaper editors, you might  find a great many who think that war is evil.  But if you were to take  a census among pastors of fashionable metropolitan churches--\"      \"That's a bullseye hit!  The church has done for itself with most  thinking men. . . . There's another good passage in Professor Latimer,  where he points out the philosophical value of dishwashing.  Some of  Latimer's talk is so much in common with my ideas that I've been rather  hoping he'd drop in here some day.  I'd like to meet him.  As for  American poets, get wise to Edwin Robinson----\"    There is no knowing how long the bookseller's monologue might have  continued, but at this moment Helen appeared from the kitchen.    \"Good gracious, Roger!\" she exclaimed, \"I've heard your voice piping  away for I don't know how long.  What are you doing, giving the poor  child a Chautauqua lecture?  You must want to frighten her out of the  book business.\"    Roger looked a little sheepish.  \"My dear,\" he said, \"I was only laying  down a few of the principles underlying the art of bookselling----\"    \"It was very interesting, honestly it was,\" said Titania brightly.  Mrs. Mifflin, in a blue check apron and with plump arms floury to the  elbow, gave her a wink--or as near a wink as a woman ever achieves (ask  the man who owns one).    \"Whenever Mr. Mifflin feels very low in his mind about the business,\"  she said, \"he falls back on those highly idealized sentiments.  He  knows that next to being a parson, he's got into the worst line there  is, and he tries bravely to conceal it from himself.\"    \"I think it's too bad to give me away before Miss Titania,\" said Roger,  smiling, so Titania saw this was merely a family joke.    \"Really truly,\" she protested, \"I'm having a lovely time.  I've been  learning all about Professor Latimer who wrote The Handle of Europe,  and all sorts of things.  I've been afraid every minute that some  customer would come in and interrupt us.\"    \"No fear of that,\" said Helen.  \"They're scarce in the early morning.\"  She went back to her kitchen.    \"Well, Miss Titania,\" resumed Roger.  \"You see what I'm driving at.  I  want to give people an entirely new idea about bookshops.  The grain of  glory that I hope will cure both my fever and my lethargicness is my  conception of the bookstore as a power-house, a radiating place for  truth and beauty.  I insist books are not absolutely dead things: they  are as lively as those fabulous dragons' teeth, and being sown up and  down, may chance to spring up armed men.  How about Bernhardi?  Some of  my Corn Cob friends tell me books are just merchandise.  Pshaw!\"    \"I haven't read much of Bernard Shaw\" said Titania.    \"Did you ever notice how books track you down and hunt you out?  They  follow you like the hound in Francis Thompson's poem.  They know their  quarry!  Look at that book The Education of Henry Adams!  Just watch  the way it's hounding out thinking people this winter.  And The Four  Horsemen--you can see it racing in the veins of the reading people.  It's one of the uncanniest things I know to watch a real book on its  career--it follows you and follows you and drives you into a corner and  MAKES you read it.  There's a queer old book that's been chasing me for  years: The Life and Opinions of John Buncle, Esq., it's called.  I've  tried to escape it, but every now and then it sticks up its head  somewhere.  It'll get me some day, and I'll be compelled to read it.  Ten Thousand a Year trailed me the same way until I surrendered.  Words  can't describe the cunning of some books.  You'll think you've shaken  them off your trail, and then one day some innocent-looking customer  will pop in and begin to talk, and you'll know he's an unconscious  agent of book-destiny.  There's an old sea-captain who drops in here  now and then.  He's simply the novels of Captain Marryat put into  flesh.  He has me under a kind of spell; I know I shall have to read  Peter Simple before I die, just because the old fellow loves it so.  That's why I call this place the Haunted Bookshop.  Haunted by the  ghosts of the books I haven't read.  Poor uneasy spirits, they walk and  walk around me.  There's only one way to lay the ghost of a book, and  that is to read it.\"    \"I know what you mean,\" said Titania.  \"I haven't read much Bernard  Shaw, but I feel I shall have to.  He meets me at every turn, bullying  me.  And I know lots of people who are simply terrorized by H. G.  Wells.  Every time one of his books comes out, and that's pretty often,  they're in a perfect panic until they've read it.\"    Roger chuckled.  \"Some have even been stampeded into subscribing to the  New Republic for that very purpose.\"    \"But speaking of the Haunted Bookshop, what's your special interest in  that Oliver Cromwell book?\"    \"Oh, I'm glad you mentioned it,\" said Roger.  \"I must put it back in  its place on the shelf.\"  He ran back to the den to get it, and just  then the bell clanged at the door.  A customer came in, and the  one-sided gossip was over for the time being.        Chapter VII    Aubrey Takes Lodgings      I am sensible that Mr. Aubrey Gilbert is by no means ideal as the  leading juvenile of our piece.  The time still demands some explanation  why the leading juvenile wears no gold chevrons on his left sleeve.  As  a matter of fact, our young servant of the Grey-Matter Agency had been  declined by a recruiting station and a draft board on account of flat  feet; although I must protest that their flatness detracts not at all  from his outward bearing nor from his physical capacity in the ordinary  concerns of amiable youth.  When the army \"turned him down flat,\" as he  put it, he had entered the service of the Committee on Public  Information, and had carried on mysterious activities in their behalf  for over a year, up to the time when the armistice was signed by the  United Press.  Owing to a small error of judgment on his part, now  completely forgotten, but due to the regrettable delay of the German  envoys to synchronize with over-exuberant press correspondents, the  last three days of the war had been carried on without his active  assistance.  After the natural recuperation necessary on the 12th of  November, he had been re-absorbed by the Grey-Matter Advertising  Agency, with whom he had been connected for several years, and where  his sound and vivacious qualities were highly esteemed.  It was in the  course of drumming up post-war business that he had swung so far out of  his ordinary orbit as to call on Roger Mifflin.  Perhaps these  explanations should have been made earlier.    At any rate, Aubrey woke that Saturday morning, about the time Titania  began to dust the pavement-boxes, in no very world-conquering humour.  As it was a half-holiday, he felt no compunction in staying away from  the office.  The landlady, a motherly soul, sent him up some coffee and  scrambled eggs, and insisted on having a doctor in to look at his  damage.  Several stitches were taken, after which he had a nap.  He  woke up at noon, feeling better, though his head still ached  abominably.  Putting on a dressing gown, he sat down in his modest  chamber, which was furnished chiefly with a pipe-rack, ash trays, and a  set of O. Henry, and picked up one of his favourite volumes for a bit  of solace.  We have hinted that Mr. Gilbert was not what is called  \"literary.\" His reading was mostly of the newsstand sort, and Printer's  Ink, that naive journal of the publicity professions.  His favourite  diversion was luncheon at the Advertising Club where he would pore,  fascinated, over displays of advertising booklets, posters, and  pamphlets with such titles as Tell Your Story in Bold-Face.  He was  accustomed to remark that \"the fellow who writes the Packard ads has  Ralph Waldo Emerson skinned three ways from the Jack.\" Yet much must be  forgiven this young man for his love of O. Henry.  He knew, what many  other happy souls have found, that O. Henry is one of those rare and  gifted tellers of tales who can be read at all times.  No matter how  weary, how depressed, how shaken in morale, one can always find  enjoyment in that master romancer of the Cabarabian Nights.  \"Don't  talk to me of Dickens' Christmas Stories,\" Aubrey said to himself,  recalling his adventure in Brooklyn.  \"I'll bet O. Henry's Gift of the  Magi beats anything Dick ever laid pen to.  What a shame he died  without finishing that Christmas story in Rolling Stones!  I wish some  boss writer like Irvin Cobb or Edna Ferber would take a hand at  finishing it.  If I were an editor I'd hire someone to wind up that  yarn.  It's a crime to have a good story like that lying around half  written.\"    He was sitting in a soft wreath of cigarette smoke when his landlady  came in with the morning paper.    \"Thought you might like to see the Times, Mr. Gilbert,\" she said.  \"I  knew you'd been too sick to go out and buy one.  I see the President's  going to sail on Wednesday.\"    Aubrey threaded his way through the news with the practiced eye of one  who knows what interests him.  Then, by force of habit, he carefully  scanned the advertising pages.  A notice in the HELP WANTED columns  leaped out at him.

The leaders of this group got into  correspondence with persons in Germany and were promised military  assistance if they would rebel against England. The rebellion broke out  April 24, 1916, without the promised help from Germany. For several days  the rebels held some of the principal buildings in Dublin. After much  bloodshed the rebellion was put down, and Sir Roger Casement, one of  those who had been in communication with Germany, was executed for  treason.        SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY.--1. On an outline map of Europe      indicate the countries engaged in the war at the end of 1916.      Indicate the date of the entrance of each and the side on      which it was fighting. 2. Collect pictures illustrative of      life in the Balkans and of the war in that region. 3. Locate      Armenia. What do you know of the race and religion of its      population? 4. Where is Bagdad? Why is it important for the      British Empire that the valley of the Tigris-Euphrates should      not fall into the possession of a strong hostile power? What      do you know of the history of this region in ancient times?      What may become of Mesopotamia at the close of the war? 5. In      regard to Roumania tell what you know of its race, language,      religion, and industries prior to the war. Compare this      country with Bulgaria in regard to the facts you have      mentioned.

CHAPTER XI    THE WAR IN 1917      THE WESTERN FRONT.--During the winter of 1916-1917 there was little  infantry warfare in France, although the heavy guns kept up their  cannonades. In the spring of 1917 the Allies planned a great drive on  the enemy positions in the valley of the Somme. But in March the Germans  began a general retirement to a more easily defended line--the so-called  Hindenburg line--on a front of one hundred miles, from Arras (ar-rahss')  to Soissons (swah-sawn')[3]. Completely destroying the villages,  churches, castles, vineyards, and orchards, they left a desolate waste  behind them. In this retreat the Germans gave up French territory to the  extent of thirteen hundred square miles.    The German retirement was closely followed by British and French troops.  Great courage was shown by Canadian troops in the taking of Vimy Ridge  on April 9. In the following month many attacks were made by the British  and French, which resulted in the taking of nearly 50,000 prisoners and  large quantities of munitions, and the breaking through the Hindenburg  line in one place. During the summer and fall the Allied attacks  continued to win small territorial gains. The artillery fire was very  heavy during all this time. During a period of three weeks the French  city of Rheims (reemz or r[)a]nss) alone, with its magnificent cathedral  almost in ruins, was bombarded with 65,000 large caliber German shells.    Two very important ridges, from which artillery could reach German  positions, were taken during the heavy fighting in November. The French  forced a retreat of the Germans over a thirteen-mile front and occupied  the ridge known as Chemin des Dames (shm[)a]n d[=a] dahm); while the Canadians  secured Passchendaele (pahss-ken-d[)e]l'[=a]) Ridge.    Late in the year the British introduced a new method of warfare. Instead  of beginning their attack with a great bombardment lasting many hours  and thus indicating to the enemy the approximate time and place of  attack, they sent over the front a large number of \"tanks\" which broke  through the barbed wire entanglements and opened the way for the  infantry. By this means the British successfully surprised the enemy in  the battle of Cambrai (cahn-br[)e]'; November 20 to December 13).  Unfortunately they could not hold most of the land occupied,--which was  lost later in the battle,--but they did show the possibility of breaking  the old deadlock of trench righting. The new method was to be used by  both sides during the campaigns of the following year.    THE WAR IN THE AIR.--During this year warfare in the air continued to  advance. Guynemer (geen-m[)e]r'), the great French ace, who was lost on  September 11, had to his credit the destruction of fifty-four enemy  machines. The increase in the number of airplanes led to the grouping of  large numbers into regular formations (escadrilles), sometimes composed  of over a hundred planes. Each year showed a steady increase in the  effectiveness of this kind of warfare. In 1916 a total of 611 enemy  machines had been destroyed or damaged by the Allied forces. In 1917 the  French destroyed forty-three in twenty-four hours; and the British  brought down thirty-one enemy planes in one combat. In a single week in  1918 the Allies destroyed 339 German planes. On one day, October 9,  1918, three hundred and fifty airplanes were sent forth by the American  army in a single bombing expedition.    THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION.--In 1917 the Allied cause received a heavy  blow through the collapse of the Russian government. Long before the war  there had been parties in Russia which desired to do away with the  autocratic government of the Czar and substitute some sort of  representative system which would give to the people a voice in the  management of their affairs. These reforming parties did not agree among  themselves as to the kind of government they wished to set up; their  ideas extended from limited monarchy of the English type, all the way to  anarchy, which means no government at all. In 1905 the Czar met the  wishes of the reformers to the extent of establishing the Duma, a sort  of representative assembly or parliament, which should help in making  the laws. The Duma, however, was never given any real authority, and as  time passed those who believed in Russian democracy became more and more  dissatisfied.    During the war the Germans by means of bribery and plotting did all they  could to weaken the authority of the Russian government. There existed,  moreover, much corruption and disloyalty among high Russian officials.  As the war dragged on a shortage of food added to the general  discontent. By the early months of 1917, conditions were very bad  indeed, and dissatisfied crowds gathered in the streets of Petrograd.  Hunger and hardship had made them desperate, and they refused to  disperse until the government should do something to relieve the  situation. Regiments of soldiers were summoned to fire upon the crowd.  They refused to do so and finally joined the mob. Thus began the Russian  Revolution.    At a meeting of the revolutionists a group of soldiers and working men  was selected to call upon the Duma and ask that body to form a temporary  government. Another committee was sent to inform Nicholas II that he was  deposed. Messages were sent to the armies to notify the generals that  there was no longer a Russian Empire and that they were to take their  orders thereafter from the representatives of the Russian people. Within  a few days the revolution was complete. On March 15, the Czar signed a  paper giving up the throne of Russia. Moderate reformers were placed in  charge of the different departments of the government. The new  government was recognized by the United States, Great Britain, France,  and Italy. It looked as if the revolution had established a free  government for Russia and that thenceforth, as a democratic nation, she  would fight better than ever by the side of her allies. In all the  Russian provinces, elections were called for choosing delegates to an  assembly that should make a new constitution for Russia.    RUSSIA UNDER KERENSKY.--Meanwhile the extreme socialists began at once  to make trouble for the new government. These men for the most part  owned no property and wanted all wealth equally divided among the entire  population. They considered the new government as tyrannical as that of  the Czar had been. They also favored an immediate peace. Chief among the  moderate leaders during this period was Alexander Keren'sky. He saw the  necessity of keeping the revolution within bounds. For a while he was  strong enough to maintain a moderate government in spite of the  opposition of the extreme socialists. The Germans, meanwhile, through  spies and secret agents, had been spreading among the Russian soldiers  the idea that Germany was really their friend and that it was to their  interest to stop fighting and retreat. Kerensky personally visited the  battle front in Galicia, and for a time by means of his rousing speeches  to the soldiers kept up their fighting spirit. New advances were made,  the Germans and Austrians being driven back many miles. Lemberg itself  seemed about to fall once more into the hands of the Russians. But this  success was only temporary. Owing to the shortage of ammunition and the  rapid spread of peace sentiments among the troops, the Russian army  became disorganized and retreated from Galicia.    THE BOLSHEVIKI.--Bolsheviki (b[=o]l-sh[)e]v'e-kee) is the name given to the  extreme socialistic party in Russia. From the beginning they had opposed  the control of affairs by the moderate revolutionists under Kerensky. At  last, in the fall of 1917, helped by the depression caused by the German  advance and by the strikes and food riots which once more broke out in  the capital, they succeeded in winning over to their side the Petrograd  garrison and the navy, and drove Kerensky from the city (November 7).  Their revolt was led by two of the most extreme members of the party,  Lenine and Trotzky, who had at their disposal large sums of money  furnished by Germany.    No sooner were the Bolsheviki in control than they announced themselves  in favor of an immediate peace. They proclaimed that all the land should  at once be divided among the peasants.
