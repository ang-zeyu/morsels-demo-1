Risings in Crete and the Balkans marked the reign of this, the 32nd sultan  of his dynasty, a despot whose mind was vacuous, whose recklessness was  extreme, whose extravagance knew no bounds. The Eastern Question entered  upon an acute phase. His gross misrule gave rise to movements which were  to exercise far-reaching effects upon his realm, while his continual and  enormous borrowings, leading to a state of semibankruptcy, introduced the  principle of foreign control over the finances of his empire. A  conspiracy, leading to a palace revolution, finally deposed him. A fatva  of the mufti denounced his incapacity and extravagance. Four days later he  was assassinated, and was succeeded by his nephew, Murad V, whose mind had  been reduced to a nullity by intemperance and by a long seclusion in the  Cage. Declared to be imbecile, he, after a reign of three months, was  deposed and was succeeded by the subtle, the resourceful, the suspicious,  the tyrannical 'Abdu'l-Hamid II who \"proved to be the most mean, cunning,  untrustworthy and cruel intriguer of the long dynasty of U_th_man.\" \"No  one knew,\" it was written of him, \"from day to day who was the person on  whose advice the sultan overruled his ostensible ministers, whether a  favorite lady of his harem, or a eunuch, or some fanatical dervish, or an  astrologer, or a spy.\" The Bulgarian atrocities heralded the black reign  of this \"Great Assassin,\" which thrilled Europe with horror, and were  characterized by Gladstone as \"the basest and blackest outrages upon  record in that [XIX] century.\" The War of 1877-78 accelerated the process  of the empire's dismemberment. No less than eleven million people were  emancipated from Turkish yoke. The Russian troops occupied Adrianople.  Serbia, Montenegro and Rumania proclaimed their independence. Bulgaria  became a self-governing state, tributary to the sultan. Cyprus and Egypt  were occupied. The French assumed a protectorate over Tunis. Eastern  Rumelia was ceded to Bulgaria. The wholesale massacres of Armenians,  involving directly and indirectly a hundred thousand souls, were but a  foretaste of the still more extensive bloodbaths to come in a later reign.  Bosnia and Herzegovina were lost to Austria. Bulgaria obtained her  independence. Universal contempt and hatred of an infamous sovereign,  shared alike by his Christian and Muslim subjects, finally culminated in a  revolution, swift and sweeping. The Committee of Young Turks secured from  the _Sh_ay_kh_u'l-Islam the condemnation of the sultan. Deserted and  friendless, execrated by his subjects, and despised by his fellow-rulers,  he was forced to abdicate, and was made a prisoner of state, thus ending a  reign \"more disastrous in its immediate losses of territory and in the  certainty of others to follow, and more conspicuous for the deterioration  of the condition of his subjects, than that of any other of his  twenty-three degenerate predecessors since the death of Soliman the  Magnificent.\"    The end of so shameful a reign was but the beginning of a new era which,  however auspiciously hailed at first, was destined to witness the collapse  of the Ottoman ramshackle and worm-eaten state. Muhammad V, a brother of  'Abdu'l-Hamid II, an absolute nonentity, failed to improve the status of  his subjects. The follies of his government ultimately sealed the doom of  the empire. The War of 1914-18 provided the occasion. Military reverses  brought to a head the forces that were sapping its foundations. While the  war was still being fought the defection of the Sherif of Mecca and the  revolt of the Arabian provinces portended the convulsion which was to  seize the Turkish throne. The precipitate flight and complete destruction  of the army of Jamal Pa_sh_a, the commander-in-chief in Syria--he who had  sworn to raze to the ground, after his triumphant return from Egypt, the  Tomb of Baha'u'llah, and to publicly crucify the Center of His Covenant in  a public square of Constantinople--was the signal for the nemesis that was  to overtake an empire in distress. Nine-tenths of the large Turkish armies  had melted away. A fourth of the whole population had perished from war,  disease, famine and massacre.    A new ruler, Muhammad VI, the last of the twenty-five successive  degenerate sultans, had meanwhile succeeded his wretched brother. The  edifice of the empire was now quaking and tottering to its fall. Mustafa  Kamal dealt it the final blows. Turkey, that had already shrunk to a small  Asiatic state, became a republic. The sultan was deposed, the Ottoman  Sultanate was ended, a rulership that had remained unbroken for six and a  half centuries was extinguished. An empire which had stretched from the  center of Hungary to the Persian Gulf and the Sudan, and from the Caspian  Sea to Oran in Africa, had now dwindled to a small Asiatic republic.  Constantinople itself, which, after the fall of Byzantium, had been  honored as the splendid metropolis of the Roman Empire, and had been made  the capital of the Ottoman government, was abandoned by its conquerors,  and stripped of its pomp and glory--a mute reminder of the base tyranny  that had for so long stained its throne.    Such, in their bare outline, were the awful evidences of that retributive  justice which so tragically afflicted 'Abdu'l-'Aziz, his successors, his  throne and his dynasty. What of Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah, the other partner in  that imperial conspiracy which sought to extirpate, root and branch, the  budding Faith of God? His reaction to the Divine Message borne to him by  the fearless Badi, the \"Pride of Martyrs,\" who had spontaneously dedicated  himself to this purpose, was characteristic of that implacable hatred  which, throughout his reign, glowed so fiercely in his breast.            DIVINE RETRIBUTION ON THE QAJAR DYNASTY      The French Emperor had, it was reported, flung away Baha'u'llah's Tablet,  and directed his minister, as Baha'u'llah Himself asserts, to address to  its Author an irreverent reply. The Grand Vizir of 'Abdu'l-'Aziz, it is  reliably stated, blanched while reading the communication addressed to his  Imperial master and his ministers, and made the following comment: \"It is  as if the king of kings were issuing his behest to his humblest vassal  king, and regulating his conduct!\" Queen Victoria, it is said, upon  reading the Tablet revealed for her remarked: \"If this is of God, it will  endure; if not, it can do no harm.\" It was reserved for Nasiri'd-Din  _Sh_ah, however, to wreak, at the instigation of the divines, his  vengeance on One Whom he could no longer personally chastise by arresting  His messenger, a lad of about seventeen, by freighting him with chains, by  torturing him on the rack, and finally slaying him.    To this despotic sovereign Baha'u'llah, Who denounced him as the \"Prince  of Oppressors,\" and as one who would soon be made \"an object-lesson for  the world,\" had written: \"Look upon this Youth, O king, with the eyes of  justice; judge thou, then, with truth concerning what hath befallen Him.  Of a verity, God hath made thee His shadow amongst men, and the sign of  His power unto all that dwell on earth.\" And again: \"O king! Wert thou to  incline thine ears unto the shrill of the Pen of Glory and the cooing of  the Dove of Eternity ... thou wouldst attain unto a station from which  thou wouldst behold in the world of being naught save the effulgence of  the Adored One, and wouldst regard thy sovereignty as the most  contemptible of thy possessions, abandoning it to whosoever might desire  it, and setting thy face toward the horizon aglow with the light of His  countenance.\" And again: \"We fain would hope, however, that His Majesty  the _Sh_ah will himself examine these matters, and bring hope to the  hearts. That which We have submitted to thee is indeed for thine highest  good.\"    This hope, however, was to remain unfulfilled. It was indeed shattered by  a reign which had been inaugurated by the execution of the Bab, and the  imprisonment of Baha'u'llah in the Siyah-_Ch_al of Tihran, by a sovereign  who had repeatedly instigated Baha'u'llah's successive banishments, and by  a dynasty that had been sullied by the slaughter of no less than twenty  thousand of His followers. The _Sh_ah's dramatic assassination, the  ignoble rule of the last sovereigns of the House of Qajar, and the  extinction of that dynasty, were signal instances of the Divine  retribution which these horrid atrocities had provoked.    The Qajars, members of the alien Turkoman tribe, had, indeed, usurped the  Persian throne. Aqa Muhammad _Kh_an, the eunuch _Sh_ah and founder of the  dynasty, was such an atrocious, avaricious, bloodthirsty tyrant that the  memory of no Persian is so detested and universally execrated as his  memory. The record of his reign and that of his immediate successors is  one of vandalism, of internal warfare, of recalcitrant and rebellious  chieftains, of brigandage, and medieval oppression, whilst the annals of  the reigns of the later Qajars are marked by the stagnation of the nation,  the illiteracy of the people, the corruption and incompetence of the  government, the scandalous intrigues of the court, the decadence of the  princes, the irresponsibility and extravagance of the sovereign, and his  abject subservience to a notoriously degraded clerical order.    The successor of Aqa Muhammad _Kh_an, the uxorious, philoprogenetive  Fath-'Ali _Sh_ah, the so-called \"Darius of the Age,\" was a vain, an  arrogant, and unscrupulous miser, notorious for the enormous number of his  wives and concubines, numbering above a thousand, his incalculable  progeny, and the disasters which his rule brought upon his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19284"],[0,"Paris Talks (#17)"],[1,"much as a hair's breadth. The great and mighty ocean is  powerless to change the ebb and flow of its tides--nothing can stand  against nature's laws but man!    But to man God has given such wonderful power that he can guide, control  and overcome nature.    The natural law for man is to walk on the earth, but he makes ships and  flies in the air! He is created to live on dry land, but he rides on the  sea and even travels under it!    He has learnt to control the power of electricity, and he takes it at his  will and imprisons it in a lamp! The human voice is made to speak across  short distances, but man's power is such that he has made instruments and  can speak from East to West! All these examples show you how man can  govern nature, and how, as it were, he wrests a sword from the hand of  nature and uses it against herself. Seeing that man has been created  master of nature, how foolish it is of him to become her slave! What  ignorance and stupidity it is to worship and adore nature, when God in His  goodness has made us masters thereof. God's power is visible to all, yet  men shut their eyes and see it not. The Sun of Truth is shining in all His  splendour, but man with fast shut eyes cannot behold His glory! It is my  earnest prayer to God that by His Mercy and Loving Kindness you may all be  united, and filled with the utmost joy.    I beseech you, one and all, to add your prayers to mine to the end that  war and bloodshed may cease, and that love, friendship, peace and unity  may reign in the world.    All down the ages we see how blood has stained the surface of the earth;  but now a ray of greater light has come, man's intelligence is greater,  spirituality is beginning to grow, and a time is surely coming when the  religions of the world will be at peace. Let us leave the discordant  arguments concerning outward forms, and let us join together to hasten  forward the Divine Cause of unity, until all humanity knows itself to be  one family, joined together in love.            PART II          The Eleven Principles out of the Teaching of Baha'u'llah, Explained by  'Abdu'l-Baha in Paris.      I.--The Search after Truth.    II.--The Unity of Mankind.    III.--Religion ought to be the Cause of Love and Affection. (Not given  separately.)    IV.--The Unity of Religion and Science.    V.--Abolition of Prejudices.    VI.--Equalization of Means of Existence.    VII.--Equality of Men before the Law.    VIII.--Universal Peace.    IX.--Non-Interference of Religion and Politics.    X.--Equality of Sex--Education of Women.    XI.--The Power of the Holy Spirit.          THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, PARIS      Since my arrival in Paris, I have been told of the Theosophical Society,  and I know that it is composed of honoured and respected men. You are men  of intellect and thought, men with spiritual ideals, and it is a great  pleasure for me to be among you.    Let us thank God who has drawn us together this evening. It gives me great  joy, for I see that you are seekers after truth. You are not held in  bondage by the chains of prejudice, and your greatest longing is to know  the truth. Truth may be likened to the sun! The sun is the luminous body  that disperses all shadows; in the same way does truth scatter the shadows  of our imagination. As the sun gives life to the body of humanity so does  truth give life to their souls. Truth is a sun that rises from different  points on the horizon.    Sometimes the sun rises from the centre of the horizon, then in summer it  rises farther north, in winter farther south--but it is always the  self-same sun, however different are the points of its rising.    In like manner truth is one, although its manifestations may be very  different. Some men have eyes and see. These worship the sun, no matter  from which point on the horizon it may dawn; and when the sun has left the  winter sky to appear in the summer one, they know how to find it again.  Others there are who worship only the spot from which the sun arose, and  when it arises in its glory from another place they remain in  contemplation before the spot of its former rising. Alas! these men are  deprived of the blessings of the sun. Those who in truth adore the sun  itself will recognize it from whatsoever dawning-place it may appear, and  will straightway turn their faces towards its radiance.    We must adore the sun itself and not merely the place of its appearance.  In the same way men of enlightened heart worship truth on whatever horizon  it appears. They are not bound by personality, but they follow the truth,  and are able to recognize it no matter from whence it may come. It is this  same truth which helps humanity to progress, which gives life to all  created beings, for it is the Tree of Life!    In His teaching Baha'u'llah gives us the explanation of truth, and I wish  to speak to you briefly about this, for I see that you are capable of  understanding. I.--The first principle of Baha'u'llah is:    The Search for Truth    Man must cut himself free from all prejudice and from the result of his  own imagination, so that he may be able to search for truth unhindered.  Truth is one in all religions, and by means of it the unity of the world  can be realized.    All the peoples have a fundamental belief in common. Being one, truth  cannot be divided, and the differences that appear to exist among the  nations only result from their attachment to prejudice. If only men would  search out truth, they would find themselves united.    II.--The second principle of Baha'u'llah is:    The Unity of Mankind    The one all-loving God bestows His divine Grace and Favour on all mankind;  one and all are servants of the Most High, and His Goodness, Mercy and  loving Kindness are showered upon all His creatures. The glory of humanity  is the heritage of each one.    All men are the leaves and fruit of one same tree, they are all branches  of the tree of Adam, they all have the same origin. The same rain has  fallen upon them all, the same warm sun makes them grow, they are all  refreshed by the same breeze. The only differences that exist and that  keep them apart are these: there are the children who need guidance, the  ignorant to be instructed, the sick to be tended and healed; thus, I say  that the whole of humanity is enveloped by the Mercy and Grace of God. As  the Holy Writings tell us: All men are equal before God. He is no  respecter of persons.    III.--The third principle of Baha'u'llah is:    Religion should be the Cause of Love and Affection    Religion should unite all hearts and cause wars and disputes to vanish  from the face of the earth, give birth to spirituality, and bring life and  light to each heart. If religion becomes a cause of dislike, hatred and  division, it were better to be without it, and to withdraw from such a  religion would be a truly religious act. For it is clear that the purpose  of a remedy is to cure; but if the remedy should only aggravate the  complaint it had better be left alone. Any religion which is not a cause  of love and unity is no religion. All the holy prophets were as doctors to  the soul; they gave prescriptions for the healing of mankind; thus any  remedy that causes disease does not come from the great and supreme  Physician.    IV.--The fourth principle of Baha'u'llah is:    The Unity of Religion and Science    We may think of science as one wing and religion as the other; a bird  needs two wings for flight, one alone would be useless. Any religion that  contradicts science or that is opposed to it, is only ignorance--for  ignorance is the opposite of knowledge.    Religion which consists only of rites and ceremonies of prejudice is not  the truth. Let us earnestly endeavour to be the means of uniting religion  and science.    'Ali, the son-in-law of Muhammad, said: 'That which is in conformity with  science is also in conformity with religion'. Whatever the intelligence of  man cannot understand, religion ought not to accept. Religion and science  walk hand in hand, and any religion contrary to science is not the truth.    V.--The fifth principle of Baha'u'llah is:    Prejudices of Religion, Race or Sect destroy the foundation of Humanity    All the divisions in the world, hatred, war and bloodshed, are caused by  one or other of these prejudices.    The whole world must be looked upon as one single country, all the nations  as one nation, all men as belonging to one race. Religions, races, and  nations are all divisions of man's making only, and are necessary only in  his thought; before God there are neither Persians, Arabs, French nor  English; God is God for all, and to Him all creation is one. We must obey  God, and strive to follow Him by leaving all our prejudices and bringing  about peace on earth.    VI.--The sixth principle of Baha'u'llah is:    Equal opportunity of the means of Existence    Every human being has the right to live; they have a right to rest, and to  a certain amount of well-being. As a rich man is able to live in his  palace surrounded by luxury and the greatest comfort, so should a poor man  be able to have the necessaries of life. Nobody should die of hunger;  everybody should have sufficient clothing; one man should not live in  excess while another has no possible means of existence.    Let us try with all the strength we have to bring about happier  conditions, so that no single soul may be destitute.    VII.--The seventh principle of Baha'u'llah is:    The Equality of Men--equality before the Law    The Law must reign, and not the individual; thus will the world become a  place of beauty and true brotherhood will be realized. Having attained  solidarity, men will have found truth.    VIII.--The eighth principle of Baha'u'llah is:    Universal Peace    A Supreme Tribunal shall be elected by the peoples and governments of  every nation, where members from each country and government shall  assemble in unity. All disputes shall be brought"]]]
