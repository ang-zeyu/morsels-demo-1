At this moment the Swallow skimmed overhead, and having caught the words  \"God save the King,\" called out, \"That's the way to do it! keep that  up!\" and the Cockatoo, thinking that the Swallow meant him to scream  still more, set up another yell, which he continued until everyone felt  deafened by the noise.    \"We have chosen quite the right Judge,\" said an elegant blue crane to a  wild duck; \"he will make himself heard and respected.\" Whereat the  Cockatoo winked at the Crane, and said, \"You bet I will!\"    The Pelican now advanced to the space before the stump, and there was a  murmur of excitement, because it was about to open the trial by a  recital of wrongs done to the Bush creatures by white humanity.    Dot could not realize that she was being tried seriously, and was  delighted that the Pelican had come nearer to her stump, so that she had  a better view of him. She thought him such an old, odd-looking bird,  with his big bald head, and gigantic beak. She could not help thinking  that his beak must be too heavy for him, and asked if he would like to  rest it on the stump. The Pelican did not understand Dot's kindness, and  gave her a look of offended dignity that was quite withering; so Dot did  not speak to him again; but she longed to feel if the bag of skin that  drooped under his beak had anything in it. The Pelican's legs seemed to  Dot to be too frail and short to bear such a big bird, not to mention  the immense beak; and, when the creature stood on one leg only, she  laughed; whereat the Pelican gave her another offended look, which  effectually prevented their becoming friends.    The Pelican was beginning to open his beak to speak (and, being such a  large beak, opening it took some time), when the Welcome Swallow fussed  into court, and said that \"nothing could be done until they had some  horsehair!\"    [Illustration: THE COCKATOO JUDGE]    This interruption, and the Swallow's repeated assurance that no human  trial of importance could take place without horsehair, set all the  creatures chattering with astonishment and questions. Some said the  Swallow was joking; others said that it was making senseless delays, and  that night would fall before they could bring the prisoner to justice.  There was much grumbling on all sides, and complaints of hunger, and the  jury began to clamour for the grubs that they had been promised, at  which the Magpie whispered to Dot that she certainly would be found  guilty. The fact was now quite clear to the jury before the trial began.    But the Swallow persisted that they must have horsehair.    \"What for?\" asked everyone, sulkily.    \"Don't you see for yourselves,\" squeaked the Swallow, excitedly; \"the  Judge looks like a Cockatoo.\"    \"Well, of course he does,\" said all the creatures. \"He is a Cockatoo, so  he looks like one!\"    \"Yes,\" cried the Swallow, \"but you must stick horse hairs on his head.  Human justice must be done with horsehair. The prisoner won't believe  the Cockatoo is a judge without. Good Gracious!\" exclaimed the Swallow,  \"just look! The prisoner is scratching the Judge's poll! We really  _must_ have horsehair!\"    Dot, seeing the Swallow's indignation, drew away from the stump, and the  Cockatoo tried to look as if he had never seen her before, and as if the  idea of having his poll scratched by the prisoner was one that could  never have entered his head.    \"But if we do put horsehair on the Cockatoo's head,\" argued the  creatures, \"what will it do?\"    \"It will impress the prisoner,\" said the Swallow.    \"How?\" they all asked curiously.    \"Because the Cockatoo won't look like a Cockatoo,\" replied the Swallow,  with exasperation.    \"Then what will he look like?\" asked every creature in breathless  excitement.    \"He won't look like any creature that ever lived,\" retorted the Swallow.    Perfect silence followed this explanation, for every bird and animal was  trying to understand human sense and reason. Then the smallest Kangaroo  Rat broke the stillness.    \"If,\" said the Kangaroo Rat, \"only a little horsehair can do that,  surely the prisoner can imagine the Judge isn't a Cockatoo, without our  having to wait for the horsehair. Let's get on with the trial.\"    This idea was received with applause, and the Swallow flew off in a  huff; whilst the Kookooburra, on a tree near the Court, softly laughed  to himself.    Once more the Pelican took up his position to open the trial. The  Cockatoo puffed himself out as big as he could, fluffed out his cheek  feathers, and half closed his eyes. His solemnly attentive attitude won  the admiration of all the Court, and the absence of horsehair was not  felt by anyone. The Welcome Swallow, having got over its ill temper,  returned to help the proceedings; and the jury all put their heads under  their wings and went to sleep.    \"Fire away!\" screamed the Cockatoo, and the trial began.    \"My duty is a most painful one,\" said the Pelican; \"for\" (\"whereas,\"  said the Swallow) \"the prisoner known\" (\"named and described,\" added the  Swallow), \"as Dot is now before you,\" (\"to be tried, heard, determined  and adjudged,\" gabbled the Swallow) \"on a charge of cruelty\" (\"and  feloniously killing and slaying,\" prompted the Swallow) \"to birds and  animals,\" (\"the term not applying to horse, mare, pony, bull, ox, dog,  cat, heifer, steer, calf, mule, ass, sheep, lamb, hog, pig, sow, goat,  or other domestic animal,\" interposed in one breath the Swallow, quoting  the Cruelty to Animals Act) \"she is\" (\"hereby,\" put in the Swallow)  \"brought to trial on\" (\"divers,\" whispered the Swallow) \"charges,\"  (\"hereinafter,\" said the Swallow) \"to be named and described by the\"  (\"aforesaid,\" interjected the Swallow) \"birds and animals,\"  (\"hereinbefore mentioned,\" stated the Swallow) \"the said animals being  denizens of the Bush\" (\"and in no wise relating to horse, mare, pony,  bull, ox,\"--began the Swallow again, when the Cockatoo raised his crest,  and screamed out \"STOP THAT, I TELL YOU!\" and the Pelican continued  stating the charge.) \"Bush law\" (\"enacts,\" said the Swallow) \"that\"  (\"whereas,\" prompted the Swallow) \"all individual rights\" (\"whatsoever,\"  put in the Swallow) \"shall be according to the statute Victoria--\"    \"Victoria! Twenty to one against the field,\" shouted the Judge.    \"Between you two,\" said the Pelican, looking angrily at the Swallow and  the Cockatoo, \"I've forgotten everything I was going to say! I shan't go  on!\"    \"Never mind,\" said the Swallow cheerfully, \"you've said quite enough,  and no one has understood a word of the charge, so it's all right. Now  then for the witnesses.\"    As the Swallow spoke, there was a great disturbance amongst the  creatures. The swan, ducks, cranes, and waterfowl, besides honeysuckers,  and many other birds, were all fanning the air with their wings, and  crying, \"Turn him out!\" \"Disgusting!\" \"I never heard of such a thing in  my life! the smell of it always gives me a headache!\" and there was such  a noise that the jury all woke up, and Dot covered her ears with her  hands. The Cockatoo, seeing Dot's distress at the screams and hubbub,  and thinking that she wanted to say something, but could not make  herself heard in the general riot, decided to speak for her; so he  screamed louder than all the rest, and shouted, \"Apples, oranges, pears,  lemonade, cigarettes, _and_ cigars! I say! what's the row?\"    [Illustration: THE PELICAN OPENS THE CASE]    When quiet was restored, it was explained that the Opossum had brought  into Court a pouch full of gum leaves, which it was eating. It had also  given some to the Native Bear, and Wallaby, and in consequence the whole  air was laden with the odour of eucalyptus.    \"Oh, dear!\" said Dot, \"it smells just like when I have a cold!\"    \"Eating eucalyptus leaves in Court is contempt of Court,\" cried the  Swallow; and everyone echoed, \"Contempt of Court! contempt of Court!  Turn them out!\"    \"But they are witnesses,\" objected the Pelican.    \"That doesn't matter!\" shouted the Waterfowl, \"it's a disgusting smell!  Turn them out!\"    \"Hurrah!\" shouted the Wallaby, as it leaped off. \"What luck!\" laughed  the Opossum, as it cleared into the nearest tree. \"I am glad,\" sighed  the Koala, as it slowly moved away; \"that trial made my head feel  empty.\"    \"Well, there go three of the most important witnesses,\" grumbled the  Pelican.    \"My eye! what a spree!\" said the Judge.    A Galah amongst the Jury, wishing to be thought intelligent, enquired  what charge the Wallaby, Native Bear, and Opossum were to bear witness  to.    \"It is a matter of skins, included in the fur rugs clause, and the  wickedness known as 'Sport,'\" answered the Pelican.    Whilst the Pelican was making this explanation, the Judge, who had been  longing to have his poll scratched again, sidled up to Dot, and  whispered softly to her, \"Scratch Cockie!\" But, just as he was enjoying  the delicious sensation Dot's fingers produced amongst his neck  feathers, as he held his head down, the Pelican caught sight of the  proceeding. The Pelican said nothing, but stared at the Judge with an  eye of such astonishment and stern contempt, that the Cockatoo instantly  remembered that he was a judge, and, getting into a proper attitude,  said hastily, \"Advance Australia! who's the next witness?\" And again the  Kookooburra laughed to himself on the tree.    \"Fur first!\" exclaimed a white Ibis. \"Call the Platypus!\"    \"The Platypus won't come!\" cried the Kangaroo Rat.    \"Well, I never!\" exclaimed the Judge.    \"It says that if a Court is held at all, it should be conducted by the  representative of Antediluvian custom, the most ancient and learned  creatures, such as the Iguana, the Snake, and Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus.  That it would prefer to associate with the meanest Troglodite, rather  than appear amongst the present company.

His education was a cultivation of every grace of mind and hand. He  assimilated freely whatever he found to be good in the art about him.  A pupil of Perugino originally, he levied upon features of excellence  in Masaccio, Fra Bartolommeo, Leonardo, Michael Angelo. From the first  he got tenderness, from the second drawing, from the third color and  composition, from the fourth charm, from the fifth force. Like an  eclectic Greek he drew from all sources, and then blended and united  these features in a peculiar style of his own and stamped them with  his peculiar Raphaelesque stamp.    In subject Raphael was religious and mythological, but he was imbued  with neither of these so far as the initial spirit was concerned. He  looked at all subjects in a calm, intellectual, artistic way. Even the  celebrated Sistine Madonna is more intellectual than pietistic, a  Christian Minerva ruling rather than helping to save the world. The  same spirit ruled him in classic and theological themes. He did not  feel them keenly or execute them passionately--at least there is no  indication of it in his work. The doing so would have destroyed unity,  symmetry, repose. The theme was ever held in check by a regard for  proportion and rhythm. To keep all artistic elements in perfect  equilibrium, allowing no one to predominate, seemed the mainspring of  his action, and in doing this he created that harmony which his  admirers sometimes refer to as pure beauty.    For his period and school he was rather remarkable technically. He  excelled in everything except brush-work, which was never brought to  maturity in either Florence or Rome. Even in color he was fine for  Florence, though not equal to the Venetians. In composition,  modelling, line, even in texture painting (see his portraits) he was a  man of accomplishment; while in grace, purity, serenity, loftiness he  was the Florentine leader easily first.    [Illustration: FIG. 42.--GIULIO ROMANO. APOLLO AND MUSES. PITTI.]    The influence of Raphael's example was largely felt throughout Central  Italy, and even at the north, resulting in many imitators and  followers, who tried to produce Raphaelesque effects. Their efforts  were usually successful in precipitating charm into sweetness and  sentiment into sentimentality. Francesco Penni (1488?-1528) seems to  have been content to work under Raphael with some ability. Giulio  Romano (1492-1546) was the strongest of the pupils, and became the  founder and leader of the Roman school, which had considerable  influence upon the painters of the Decadence. He adopted the classic  subject and tried to adopt Raphael's style, but he was not completely  successful. Raphael's refinement in Giulio's hands became exaggerated  coarseness. He was a good draughtsman, but rather hot as a colorist,  and a composer of violent, restless, and, at times, contorted groups.  He was a prolific painter, but his work tended toward the baroque  style, and had a bad influence on the succeeding schools.    Primaticcio (1504-1570) was one of his followers, and had much to do  with the founding of the school of Fontainebleau in France. Giovanni  da Udine (1487-1564), a Venetian trained painter, became a follower of  Raphael, his only originality showing in decorative designs. Perino  del Vaga (1500-1547) was of the same cast of mind. Andrea Sabbatini  (1480?-1545) carried Raphael's types and methods to the south of  Italy, and some artists at Bologna, and in Umbria, like Innocenza da  Imola (1494-1550?), and Timoteo di Viti (1467-1523), adopted the  Raphael type and method to the detriment of what native talent they  may have possessed, though about Timoteo there is some doubt whether  he adopted Raphael's type, or Raphael his type.

BOOKS RECOMMENDED: The works on Italian art before mentioned       and consult also the General Bibliography (p. xv.)      LEONARDO DA VINCI AND THE MILANESE: The third person in the great  Florentine trinity of painters was Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), the  other two being Michael Angelo and Raphael. He greatly influenced the  school of Milan, and has usually been classed with the Milanese, yet  he was educated in Florence, in the workshop of Verrocchio, and was so  universal in thought and methods that he hardly belongs to any school.    He has been named a realist, an idealist, a magician, a wizard, a  dreamer, and finally a scientist, by different writers, yet he was  none of these things while being all of them--a full-rounded,  universal man, learned in many departments and excelling in whatever  he undertook. He had the scientific and experimental way of looking at  things. That is perhaps to be regretted, since it resulted in his  experimenting with everything and completing little of anything. His  different tastes and pursuits pulled him different ways, and his  knowledge made him sceptical of his own powers. He pondered and  thought how to reach up higher, how to penetrate deeper, how to  realize more comprehensively, and in the end he gave up in despair. He  could not fulfil his ideal of the head of Christ nor the head of Mona  Lisa, and after years of labor he left them unfinished. The problem  of human life, the spirit, the world engrossed him, and all his  creations seem impregnated with the psychological, the mystical, the  unattainable, the hidden.    [Illustration: FIG. 43.--LEONARDO DA VINCI. MONA LISA. LOUVRE.]    He was no religionist, though painting the religious subject with  feeling; he was not in any sense a classicist, nor had he any care for  the antique marbles, which he considered a study of nature at  second-hand. He was more in love with physical life without being an  enthusiast over it. His regard for contours, rhythm of line, blend of  light with shade, study of atmosphere, perspective, trees, animals,  humanity, show that though he examined nature scientifically, he  pictured it aesthetically. In his types there is much sweetness of  soul, charm of disposition, dignity of mien, even grandeur and majesty  of presence. His people we would like to know better. They are full of  life, intelligence, sympathy; they have fascination of manner,  winsomeness of mood, grace of bearing. We see this in his best-known  work--the Mona Lisa of the Louvre. It has much allurement of personal  presence, with a depth and abundance of soul altogether charming.    Technically, Leonardo was not a handler of the brush superior in any  way to his Florentine contemporaries. He knew all the methods and  mediums of the time, and did much to establish oil-painting among the  Florentines, but he was never a painter like Titian, or even Correggio  or Andrea del Sarto. A splendid draughtsman, a man of invention,  imagination, grace, elegance, and power, he nevertheless carried more  by mental penetration and aesthetic sense than by his technical skill.  He was one of the great"]]]
