Matthew afterwards exerted his influence with the  King in behalf of the University of Oxford, when its privileges were in  danger from the encroachments of the Bishop of Lincoln. His great work  was the \"Historia Major.\" This professes to give the outlines of human  history from the Creation up to 1259. The work up to 1189 seems to have  been compiled by John de Cella, from 1189 to 1235 by Roger of Wendover.  Matthew of Paris transcribed and edited the work of his two  predecessors, and continued the history from 1235 to 1259. He shows  himself in it a warm advocate of English rights and liberties, and an  opponent of papal and regal tyranny. It is the best early history we  have of our own country up to the beginning of the Barons' War, and is  also an authority on Continental affairs. He wrote too an abridgement of  this work, leaving out the parts dealing with foreign history; this he  called \"Historia Anglorum.\" He also wrote \"The Lives of the two Offas\"  and the \"Lives of Twenty-three Abbots of St. Albans,\" whence most of the  details of the history of the Abbey given here have been derived. Thomas  of Walsingham, who continued the history, lived in the reigns of Henry  IV. and Henry V.    Against Abbot John it is alleged that he had his commons sent to his  private room, instead of taking his meals with the brethren in the  refectory. When he died he was buried with great honour, \"as became so  great a father.\"    24. #Roger of Norton# (1260-1290). The new Abbot had been one of the  monks; his appointment was confirmed by Pope Urban in 1263. During his  rule the monastery flourished, notwithstanding the disturbed state of  the country in the early years of it. He acquired many new possessions;  the infirmary was rebuilt; the Abbot's lodgings were repaired; many  ornaments, vestments, books, a silver thurible, and three new bells were  procured. He made regulations for the preservation of the Abbey  property, the management of the servants and tenants, and for the  careful custody of the Abbey swans. Much litigation took place during  his abbacy. Queen Eleanor claimed one of the manors, but was not able to  make good her claim. A controversy about the appointment of the Prior of  the cell at Wymondham arose between the Abbot and the Countess of  Arundel, which was finally settled by an agreement that the Countess  should nominate three persons, of whom the Abbot was to select one.  Another dispute arose between the Abbot and the townspeople, about  grinding corn and fulling cloth. The people claimed the right of having  handmills in their houses, the Abbot insisted on his mills being used;  the matter was referred to the law courts and decided in the Abbot's  favour. Although through negligence some property was lost, yet this  Abbot's character was highly commended:        Hic quem dedit Dominus nobis in rectorem      Prudenter sustinuit onus et honorem.    He was strict in government, of good life and conversation, eminently  religious, distinguished for his learning. He was paralyzed for three  years before his death, and when he died his body was buried before the  high altar, but his heart was placed in a small box of Eastern  workmanship before one of the altars in the retro-choir.    25. #John of Berkhamstead# (1290-1301). This Abbot was installed on St.  Alban's Day, 1291. The King, Edward I., visited the Abbey during the  vacancy, and again after the appointment of the new Abbot. The conduct  of the King's agent before the election had been very extortionate. The  claim of the Warden of Hertford Castle to certain tolls within the  Abbot's liberty was the subject of a long investigation; in the end the  claim was disallowed. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert of  Winchelsea, sent a message that he wished for hospitality in the Abbey,  but the Abbot refused to entertain him unless he would sign a paper  undertaking that his visit should not in any way prejudice the  privileges granted by the Pope, the Abbey being stated to belong \"ad  Romanam Ecclesiam, nullo medio.\" The Archbishop declined to sign this  document, and so had to put up with lodgings outside the Abbey  precincts. When he arrived the bells of St. Stephen's Church were not  rung in his honour, whereupon the Archbishop put the church under an  interdict; but the clergy paid no attention to this, and conducted the  services as usual. During his rule the body of Queen Eleanor rested at  St. Albans, and one of the Eleanor crosses was erected and remained here  until 1702, when it was destroyed. A drinking fountain now occupies its  site. In 1302 the Abbot obtained from Edward I. a confirmation of all  the grants that had been made to the Abbey by former kings. This Abbot  does not receive a very good character from the chronicler: he cut down  and sold too much timber, granted too many pensions, and deprived  several of the priors of the cells without sufficient cause.    26. #John de Marinis# (1302-1308). This Abbot had been Cellarer, and  afterwards Prior, for fourteen years, before his election as Abbot. The  full list of the fees and expenses connected with his confirmation at  Rome is given. The sum was enormous: 2,500 marks and 400 shillings.    He offended Edward II. by refusing to supply some carriages and horses  which the King had demanded, and so when Edward came to St. Albans he  refused to see the Abbot. The latter tried to appease the King by a  present made through the notorious favourite Piers Gaveston, and also by  a grant of the manor of Westwood, which was beyond his power to give,  but all to no purpose. Most of the records of his rule relate to rights  of property and regulations respecting the monks. As his end approached  he made a statement of his liabilities. He owed L1,300 and had never  paid the 1,000 marks due to the King at the last vacancy. We are told  that he was constant, not given to much talk, honest in his life,  religious, and circumspect.    27. #Hugh of Eversden# (1308-1326). This Abbot, who had been Cellarer  for five years, is described as being tall and handsome, able to speak  French and English well, but with little knowledge of Latin. On this  account he wished to avoid going to Rome, and sent his proctors instead  to obtain the Pope's confirmation of his election--but they, having  incurred much expense, returned to say that the Pope insisted on the new  Abbot appearing at Rome in person. By liberal presents he made a  favourable impression at Rome, but the journey, beyond the payments of  first-fruits, cost him more than L1,000. With the help of a legacy from  Reginald of St. Albans he finished the Lady Chapel and the retro-choir,  in which he placed the shrine of St. Amphibalus. King Edward II. paid a  second visit to the Abbey, and on being told by the Abbot of the  benefactions of Edward I. gave 100 marks and much timber towards the  work then in progress. The Abbot was twice besieged in his Abbey by the  townspeople; they desired to be answerable to the King and not the  Abbot. They gained their point, though they were compelled to surrender  to the next Abbot the privileges they had obtained of Abbot Hugh. It was  during the rule of this Abbot that the piers in the main arcade of the  nave gave way while mass was being said on St. Paulinus' Day, 1323, and  he had to begin repairing this part of the church.    28. #Richard of Wallingford# (1326-1334). He was of humble birth; his  father was a blacksmith. After taking his degree at Oxford he became a  monk, and resided at St. Albans for three years, when he again went to  Oxford and studied philosophy and theology there for nine years. He was  on a visit to St. Albans at the time of the death of Abbot Hugh. He was  elected Abbot, but the election was found to be informal, so he resigned  his claim to the Pope, who thereupon appointed him Abbot. He wrote a  Register of things done in his time, compiled a book of Decretals and  Constitutions of Provincial Chapters, and sundry works on geometry and  astronomy. He constructed a clock showing the courses of the sun and  moon, the ebb and flow of the tides, etc., which Leland, Librarian to  Henry VIII., speaks of as still going in his day. He also made an  astronomical instrument to which he gave the name \"Albion,\" and wrote a  book describing the manner of using it. Edward III., visiting the Abbey  and seeing the clock being constructed, while the damage done by the  fall of the nave piers in his predecessor's time had not been fully  repaired, remonstrated with the Abbot, who replied that anyone could  repair the church, but few could construct a clock such as he was  making.    It is said that he suffered from leprosy and that his death was hastened  by the shock caused by a terrible thunderstorm on St. Andrew's Eve,  1334, which set some of the domestic buildings on fire. The fire was put  out before much damage was done, but the Abbot died.    29. #Michael of Mentmore# (1335-1349). He was a graduate of Oxford, a  monk of St. Albans, and had been appointed Master of the Schools. He  finished the repairs to the south arcading and south aisle begun by  Abbot Hugh, built three altars, and vaulted the aisle. He baptized in  1341 Edmund of Langley, fifth son of Edward III., from whom the House of  York was descended. Philippa, the Queen, went to the Abbey to be  churched and gave the Abbey a cloth of gold. The Abbot, the Prior, the  sub-prior and forty-seven monks fell victims to the terrible plague  known as the Black Death, which was ravaging the country in 1349. He is  described as being pious, patient, and meek like Moses.    30. #Thomas de la Mare# (1349-1396). He was a man of high birth, and was  connected with many people of importance, among them probably Sir Peter  de la Mare, the first Speaker of the House of Commons. He became a monk  at St. Albans, and was sent to Wymondham, recalled to St. Albans, and  afterwards became kitchener, cellarer, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19499"],[0,"Music Notation and Terminology (#17)"],[1,"mn-tunes and other simple harmonized       compositions is often referred to as \"the melody.\"    181. _Harmony_ is the science of chord construction and combination.         The term _harmony_ refers to tones sounding simultaneously,       _i.e._, to _chords_, as differentiated from tones sounding       consecutively, as in melody. The word _harmony_ may therefore       be applied to any group of tones of different pitches sounded       as a chord, although specifically we usually refer to a       _succession_ of such chords when we speak of \"harmony.\" It is       possible to use the same combination of tones in either melody       or harmony; in fact these two elements as applied to modern       music have developed together and the style of present-day       melody is directly based upon the development that has       recently taken place in harmonic construction.         _Harmony_ (as contrasted with _counterpoint_) first began to       be an important factor in music about 1600 A.D., _i.e._, at       the time when opera and oratorio came into existence, when       form was established, and when our modern major and minor       scales were adopted. Before this practically all music was       composed on a contrapuntal basis.    182. _Timbre_ is that peculiar quality of sound which enables one to  distinguish a tone produced by one instrument (or voice) from a tone  produced by an equal number of vibrations on another instrument.         The word _timbre_ is synonymous with the terms _quality of       tone_, and _tone quality_ (Ger.--Klang-farbe), the excuse for       using it being that it expresses adequately in one word an       idea that in our language takes at least two: this excuse       would disappear (and incidentally a much-mispronounced word       would be eliminated) if the single word _quality_ were to be       adopted as the equivalent of _timbre_. Thus, _e.g._, the       soprano voice singing c' has a _quality_ different from the       contralto voice singing the same tone.         (The remainder of this chapter and all of Chapter XVIII deal       with terms commonly encountered in the study of _harmony_.       Courses in this subject usually begin with a study of scales,       but since this subject has already been somewhat extensively       treated, this chapter will omit it, and will begin with the       next topic in harmony study, viz.--the interval.)    183. An _interval_ is the relation of two tones with regard to pitch. If  the two tones are sounded simultaneously the result is an _harmonic  interval_, but if sounded consecutively the result is a _melodic  interval_. Fig. 62 represents the pitches f' and a' as a harmonic  interval, while Fig. 63 represents the same pitches arranged as a  melodic interval.    [Illustration: Fig. 62.]    [Illustration: Fig. 63.]    184. In classifying intervals two facts should be constantly kept in  mind:         (1) The _number name_ of the interval (third, fifth, sixth,       etc.), is derived from the order of letters as found in the       diatonic scale. Thus the interval C--E is a _third_ because E       is the third tone from C (counting C as one) in the diatonic       scale. C--G is a _fifth_ because G is the fifth tone above C       in the diatonic scale.         It should be noted however that the same _number-names_ apply       even though one or both letters of the interval are qualified       by sharps, flats, etc. Thus _e.g._, C--G[sharp] is still a       _fifth_, as are also C[sharp]--G[flat] and C[flat]--G[sharp].         (2) In determining the _specific_ name of any interval       (_perfect_ fifth, _major_ third, etc.), the half-step and       whole-step (often referred to respectively as _minor second_,       and _major second_) are used as units of measurement.         The _half-step_ is usually defined as \"the smallest usable       interval between two tones.\" Thus, C--C[sharp] is a       _half-step_, as are also B--C, F--G[flat], etc.         A _whole-step_ consists of two half-steps. C--D is a       _whole-step_, as are also B[flat]--C, E--F[sharp],       F[sharp]--G[sharp], G[flat]--A[flat], etc.         The expressions _half-step_ and _whole-step_ are much to be       preferred to _half-tone_ and _whole-tone_, as being more clear       and definite. Thus _e.g._, the sentence \"The two tones are a       _half-step_ apart\" is much better than \"The two tones are a       _half-tone_ apart.\"    185. A _prime_ is the relation between two tones whose pitches are  properly represented by the same degree of the staff.         A _perfect prime_ is one whose tones have the same pitch.       Middle C sounded by piano and violin at the same time would       offer an example.         An _augmented prime_ is one whose second tone is one half-step       higher than the first. Ex. C--C[sharp].    186. A _second_ is the relation between two tones whose pitches are  properly represented by adjacent degrees of the staff. (The first line  and first space are adjacent degrees, as are also the third line and  fourth space.)         A _minor second_ is one comprising one half-step. Ex. B--C.         A _major second_ is one comprising two half-steps. Ex.       B--C[sharp].         An _augmented second_ is one comprising three half-steps. Ex.       F--G[sharp].    187. A _third_ is an interval comprising two seconds.         A _diminished third_ has two minor seconds (_i.e._, two       half-steps). C--E[double-flat].         A _minor third_ has one minor and one major second (_i.e._,       three half-steps). C--E[flat].         A _major third_ has two major seconds (_i.e._, four       half-steps). C--E.    188. _A fourth_ is an interval comprising three seconds.         A _diminished fourth_ has two minor and one major second.       C[sharp]--F.         A _perfect fourth_ has one minor and two major seconds. C--F.         An _augmented fourth_ (tritone) has three major seconds.       C--F[sharp].    189. A _fifth_ is an interval comprising four seconds.         A _diminished fifth_ has two minor and two major seconds.       C--G[flat].         A _perfect fifth_ has one minor and three major seconds. C--G.         An _augmented fifth_ has four major seconds. C--G[sharp].    190. A _sixth_ is an interval comprising five seconds.         A _minor sixth_ has two minor and three major seconds.       C--A[flat].         A _major sixth_ has one minor and four major seconds. C--A.         An _augmented sixth_ has five major seconds. C--A[sharp].    191. A _seventh_ is an interval comprising six seconds.         A _diminished seventh_ has three minor and three major       seconds. C--B[double-flat].         A _minor seventh_ has two minor and four major seconds.       C--B[flat].         A _major seventh_ has one minor and five major seconds. C--B.    192. An _octave_ is an interval comprising seven seconds.         A _diminished octave_ has three minor and four major seconds.       C--C[flat].         _A perfect octave_ has two minor and five major seconds. C--C.         An _augmented octave_ has one minor and six major seconds.       C--C[sharp].    193. A _ninth_ is usually treated as a second, a _tenth_ as a third,  etc. The interval of two octaves is often referred to as a _fifteenth_.    194. If the major diatonic scale be written and the interval between  each tone and the key-tone noted, it will be observed that the intervals  are all either major or perfect. See Fig. 64.    [Illustration: Fig. 64.]    In this connection also it will be noted that the interval next smaller  than _major_ is always _minor_, while that next smaller than _perfect_  or _minor_ is always _diminished_: but that the interval next larger  than both _major_ and _perfect_ is _augmented_.    195. An interval is said to be _inverted_ when the tone originally the  upper becomes the lower. Thus C--E, a major third, inverted becomes  E--C, a minor sixth.          CHAPTER XVIII    CHORDS, CADENCES, ETC.      196. A _chord_ is a combination of several tones sounding together and  bearing an harmonic relation to each other. The simplest chord is the  _triad_, which consists of a fundamental tone called the _root_, with  the third and fifth above it. C--E--G is a triad, as are also D--F--A,  F--A--C, and G--B--D.    197. Triads are classified as _major_, _minor_, _diminished_, or  _augmented_.         A _major triad_ has a major third and a perfect fifth, _i.e._,       it is a major third with a minor third on top of it. Ex.       C--E--G.         A _minor triad_ has a minor third and a perfect fifth, _i.e._,       it is a minor third with a major third on top of it. Ex.       C--E[flat]--G.         A _diminished triad_ has a minor third and a diminished fifth,       _i.e._, it is a minor third with another minor third on top of       it. Ex. C--E[flat]--G[flat].         An _augmented triad_ has a major third and an augmented fifth,       _i.e._, it is a major third with another major third on top of       it. Ex. C--E--G[sharp].    198. A triad may be built on any scale-tone, but those on I, IV, and V,  are used so much oftener than the others that they are often called the  _common chords_. In referring to triads the Roman numerals are used to  show on what scale-tone the triad is based, the size of the numeral  (with other signs) indicating the kind of triad found on each tone of  the scale. Thus _e.g._, the large I shows that the triad on the first  tone (in major) is a _major triad_, the small II shows that the triad  on the second tone is minor, etc. The following figure will make this  clear.    [Illustration: Fig. 65.]    The triads in the minor scale are as follows:    [Illustration]    199. A triad is said to be _in fundamental position_ when its root is  the lowest tone. It is said to be in the _first inversion_ when the  _third_ is the lowest tone, and in the _second inversion_ when the fifth  is the lowest tone. Thus _e.g._, in Fig. 66 the same chord (C--E--G) is  arranged in"]]]
