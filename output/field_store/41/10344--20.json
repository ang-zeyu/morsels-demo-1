I have contrived to name him as seldom as  possible.\" So true is it, as the caustic Boileau exclaims of an epic  poet of his days, who had shown some dexterity in cacophony, when he  chose his hero--        O le plaisant projet d'un poete ignorant,      Qui de tant de heros va choisir _Childebrand_!      D'un seul nom quelquefois le son dur et bizarre      Bend un poeme entier, ou burlesque ou barbare.                                  _Art Poetique_, c. iii. v. 241.        In such a crowd the Poet were to blame      To choose _King Chilperic_ for his hero's name.                                     SIR W. SOAMES.    This epic poet perceiving the town joined in the severe raillery of the  poet, published a long defence of his hero's name; but the town was  inexorable, and the epic poet afterwards changed _Childebrand's_ name  to _Charles Martel_, which probably was discovered to have something  more humane. Corneille's _Pertharite_ was an unsuccessful tragedy, and  Voltaire deduces its ill fortune partly from its barbarous _names_, such  as _Garibald_ and _Edvidge_. Voltaire, in giving the _names_ of the  founders of Helvetic freedom, says, the difficulty of pronouncing these  respectable names is injurious to their celebrity; they are _Melchthal_,  _Stawffarcher_, and _Valtherfurst_.    We almost hesitate to credit what we know to be true, that the _length_  or the _shortness_ of a _name_ can seriously influence the mind. But  history records many facts of this nature. Some nations have long  cherished a feeling that there is a certain elevation or abasement in  proper names. Montaigne on this subject says, \"A gentleman, one of my  neighbours, in over-valuing the excellences of old times, never omitted  noticing the pride and magnificence of the _names_ of the nobility of  those days! Don _Grumedan_, _Quadragan_, _Argesilan_, when fully  sounded, were evidently men of another stamp than _Peter_, _Giles_, and  _Michel_.\" What could be hoped for from the names of Ebenezer, Malachi,  and Methusalem? The Spaniards have long been known for cherishing a  passion for dignified names, and are marvellously affected by long and  voluminous ones; to enlarge them they often add the places of their  residence. We ourselves seem affected by triple names; and the authors  of certain periodical publications always assume for their _nom de  guerre_ a triple name, which doubtless raises them much higher in their  reader's esteem than a mere Christian and surname. Many Spaniards have  given themselves _names_ from some remarkable incident in their lives.  One took the name of the Royal Transport, for having conducted the  Infanta in Italy. Orendayes added de la Paz, for having signed the peace  in 1725. Navarro, after a naval battle off Toulon, added la Vittoria,  though he had remained in safety at Cadiz while the French admiral Le  Court had fought the battle, which was entirely in favour of the  English. A favourite of the King of Spain, a great genius, and the  friend of Farinelli, who had sprung from a very obscure origin, to  express his contempt of these empty and haughty _names_ assumed, when  called to the administration, that of the Marquis of _La Ensenada_  (nothing in himself).    But the influence of _long names_ is of very ancient standing. Lucian  notices one _Simon_, who coming to a great fortune aggrandised his name  to _Simonides_. _Dioclesian_ had once been plain _Diocles_ before he was  emperor. When _Bruna_ became queen of France, it was thought proper to  convey some of the regal pomp in her name by calling her _Brunehault_.    The Spaniards then must feel a most singular contempt for a _very short  name_, and on this subject Fuller has recorded a pleasant fact. An  opulent citizen of the name of _John Cuts_ (what name can be more  unluckily short?) was ordered by Elizabeth to receive the Spanish  ambassador; but the latter complained grievously, and thought he was  disparaged by the _shortness_ of his _name_. He imagined that a man  bearing a monosyllabic name could never, in the great alphabet of civil  life, have performed anything great or honourable; but when he found  that honest _John Cuts_ displayed a hospitality which had nothing  monosyllabic in it, he groaned only at the utterance of the _name_ of  his host.    There are _names_, indeed, which in the social circle will in spite of  all due gravity awaken a harmless smile, and Shenstone solemnly thanked  God that his name was not liable to a pun. There are some names which  excite horror, such as Mr. Stabback; others contempt, as Mr. Twopenny;  and others of vulgar or absurd signification, subject too often to the  insolence of domestic witlings, which occasions irritation even in the  minds of worthy, but suffering, men.    There is an association of pleasing ideas with certain _names_,--and in  the literary world they produce a fine effect. _Bloomfield_ is a name  apt and fortunate for a rustic bard; as _Florian_ seems to describe his  sweet and flowery style. Dr. Parr derived his first acquaintance with  the late Mr. _Homer_ from the aptness of his name, associating with his  pursuits. Our writers of romances and novels are initiated into all the  arcana of _names_, which cost them many painful inventions. It is  recorded of one of the old Spanish writers of romance, that he was for  many days at a loss to coin a fit name for one of his giants; he wished  to hammer out one equal in magnitude to the person he conceived in  imagination; and in the haughty and lofty name of _Traquitantos_, he  thought he had succeeded. Richardson, the great father of our novelists,  appears to have considered the _name_ of Sir _Charles Grandison_ as  _perfect_ as his character, for his heroine writes, \"You know his _noble  name_, my Lucy.\" He felt the same for his _Clementina_, for Miss Byron  writes, \"Ah, Lucy, what a _pretty name_ is _Clementina_!\" We experience  a certain tenderness for _names_, and persons of refined imaginations  are fond to give affectionate or lively epithets to things and persons  they love. Petrarch would call one friend _Lellus_, and another  _Socrates_, as descriptive of their character.    In our own country, formerly, the ladies appear to have been equally  sensible to poetical or elegant _names_, such as _Alicia, Celicia,  Diana, Helena_, &c. Spenser, the poet, gave to his two sons two _names_  of this kind; he called one _Silvanus_, from the woody Kilcolman, his  estate; and the other _Peregrine_, from his having been born in a  strange place, and his mother then travelling. The fair Eloisa gave the  whimsical name of _Astrolabus_ to her boy; it bore some reference to the  stars, as her own to the sun.    Whether this name of _Astrolabus_ had any scientific influence over the  son, I know not; but I have no doubt that whimsical names may have a  great influence over our characters. The practice of romantic names  among persons, even of the lowest orders of society, has become a very  general evil: and doubtless many unfortunate beauties, of the names of  _Clarissa_ and _Eloisa_, might have escaped under the less dangerous  appellatives of _Elizabeth_ or _Deborah_. I know a person who has not  passed his life without some inconvenience from his _name_, mean talents  and violent passions not according with _Antoninus_; and a certain  writer of verses might have been no versifier, and less a lover of the  true Falernian, had it not been for his namesake _Horace_. The  Americans, by assuming _Roman_ names, produce ludicrous associations;  _Romulus_ Higgs, and _Junius Brutus_ Booth. There was more sense, when  the Foundling Hospital was first instituted, in baptizing the most  robust boys, designed for the sea-service, by the names of Drake,  Norris, or Blake, after our famous admirals.    It is no trifling misfortune in life to bear an illustrious name; and in  an author it is peculiarly severe. A history now by a Mr. Hume, or a  poem by a Mr. Pope, would be examined with different eyes than had they  borne any other name. The relative of a great author should endeavour  not to be an author. Thomas Corneille had the unfortunate honour of  being brother to a great poet, and his own merits have been considerably  injured by the involuntary comparison. The son of Racine has written  with an amenity not unworthy of his celebrated father; amiable and  candid, he had his portrait painted, with the works of his father in  his hand, and his eye fixed on this verse from Phaedra,--        Et moi, fils inconnu d'un si glorieux pere!    But even his modesty only served to whet the dart of epigram. It was  once bitterly said of the son of an eminent literary character,--        He tries to write because his father writ,      And shows himself a bastard by his wit.    Amongst some of the disagreeable consequences attending some _names_,  is, when they are unluckily adapted to an uncommon rhyme; how can any  man defend himself from this malicious ingenuity of wit? _Freret_, one  of those unfortunate victims to Boileau's verse, is said not to have  been deficient in the decorum of his manners, and he complained that he  was represented as a drunkard, merely because his _name rhymed_ to  _Cabaret_. Murphy, no doubt, felicitated himself in his literary quarrel  with Dr. _Franklin_, the poet and critical reviewer, by adopting the  singular rhyme of \"envy rankling\" to his rival's and critic's name.    Superstition has interfered even in the _choice of names_, and this  solemn folly has received the name of a science, called _Onomantia_; of  which the superstitious ancients discovered a hundred foolish mysteries.  They cast up the numeral letters of _names_, and Achilles was therefore  fated to vanquish Hector, from the numeral letters in his name amounting  to a higher number than his rival's. They made many whimsical divisions  and subdivisions of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16351"],[0,"Critical and Historical Essays (#17)"],[1,"arrangement  of Christian music into a regular system was attempted by Pope  Sylvester, in 314 A.D., when he instituted singing schools,  and when the heresy of Arius was formally condemned.    Now this chanting or singing of hymns was more or less a  declamation, thus following the Greek tradition of using one  central note, somewhat in the nature of a keynote.    Rhythm, distinct melody, and even metre were avoided as  retaining something of the unclean, brutal heathenism against  which the Christians had revolted. It was the effort to keep  the music of the church pure and undefiled that caused the  Council of Laodicea (367 A.D.) to exclude from the church all  singing not authorized from the pulpit.    A few years later (about 370 A.D.) Ambrose, the Archbishop  of Milan, strove to define this music more clearly, by fixing  upon the modes that were to be allowed for these chants; for  we must remember that all music was still based upon the Greek  modes, the modern major and minor being as yet unknown. In the  course of time the ancient modes had become corrupted, and the  modes that Ambrose took for his hymns were therefore different  from those known in Greece under the same names. His Dorian  is what the ancients called Phrygian, [G: d' d''] dominant,  A; his Phrygian was the ancient Dorian, [G: e' e''] dominant,  C; his Lydian corresponded to the old Hypolydian, [G: f' f'']  dominant, C; and his Mixolydian to the old Hypophrygian,  [G: g' g''] dominant, D. These modes were accepted by the  church and were called the Authentic modes.    Almost two centuries later, Gregory the Great added four  more modes, which were called Plagal or side modes (from  _plagios_--oblique). These were as follows:                              (Keynote)        Hypodorian,      [G: a  (d')  a' ] dominant, F.      Hypophrygian,    [G: c  (e')  b' ] dominant, A.      Hypolydian,      [G: c' (f')  c''] dominant, A.      Hypo-mixolydian, [G: d' (g')  d''] dominant, C.    It is easy to see that these so-called new modes are simply  new versions of the first four; although they are lowered a  fourth beneath the authentic modes (hence the _hypo_), the  _keynote remains the same_ in each instance. Still later two  more modes were added to this list, the Ionic, [G: c' c'']  dominant, G, which corresponded to the ancient Greek Lydian;  and the Aeolian, [G: a' a''] dominant, E, which, strange to say,  was the only one of these newer modes which corresponded to  its Greek namesake. Naturally these two newly admitted modes  were also accompanied by their lower pitched attendant modes,  the Hypoionic, [G: g (c') g'] dominant, E, and the Hypoaeolian,  [G: e' (a') e''] dominant, C.      SUMMARY        Mode.            Key.  Dominant.        Dorian.           D        A      Hypodorian.       D        F      Phrygian.         E        C      Hypophrygian.

C        E          Dominants        [G: a' f' c' {a (a')} c' a d' c' e' c' g' e']    Now all these lower, or derived modes, Hypodorian, Hypophrygian,  Hypolydian, etc., received the name Plagal modes, because  there was but one tonic or keynote in the scale; consequently  a melody starting on any degree of the scale would invariably  return to the same tonic or keynote. They differed from the  authentic modes, inasmuch as in the latter a melody might end  either on the upper or lower tonic or keynote. Thus the melody  itself was said to be either authentic or plagal, according  to whether it had one or two tonics. The theme of Schumann's  \"Etudes symphoniques\" is authentic, and the first variation  is plagal.    Between the sixth and tenth centuries there was much confusion  as to the placing of these modes, but they finally stood as  given above. The Greek names were definitely accepted in the  eleventh century, or thereabouts; previously, they were known  also as the first, second, third, etc., up to the twelfth,  church tones or Gregorian modes.    At this point it is necessary to refer again to Ambrose.  Apart from having brought the first four authentic modes  into church music, he composed many hymns which had this  peculiarity, namely, that they were modelled more on the actual  declamation of the words to be sung than had hitherto been  the case. We are told that his chants--to use the phrase of  his contemporary, Francis of Cologne--were \"all for sweetness  and melodious sound\"; and St. Augustine (354-430 A.D.),  speaks of them with ecstasy. The words in these hymns were  used in connection with small groups of notes; consequently  they could be understood as they were sung, thus returning  in a measure to the character of the music of the ancients,  in which the word and declamation were of greater importance  than the actual sounds which accompanied them. But now a  strange thing was to happen that was to give us a new art.  Now, at last, music was to be separated from language and dance  rhythms, and stand alone for the first time in the history of  civilization as _pure music_.    To appreciate the change made by Gregory (540-604 A.D.), it is  necessary to bear in mind the state of the church just before  his time. As the Ambrosian chant had brought something of the  old declamation and sweetness back into the church ceremonial,  so also in the church itself there was a tendency to sink  back into the golden shimmer that had surrounded the ancient  pagan rites. Already Paul of Samosata, Bishop of Antioch (260  A.D.), had striven to bring a certain Oriental magnificence  into the church ceremonials. He had a canopied throne erected  for himself, from which he would address his congregation;  he introduced applause into the church, after the fashion of  the Roman theatres; he also had a chorus of women singers, who,  as Eusebius tells us, sang not the Christian hymns, but pagan  tunes. Later, in Constantinople, even this luxury and pomp  increased; the churches had domes of burnished gold, and had  become gigantic palaces, lit by thousands of lamps. The choir,  dressed in glittering robes, was placed in the middle of the  church, and these singers began to show the same fatal sign  of decadence that we saw before in Rome and Greece. According  to St. Chrysostom (347-407 A.D.), they used unguents on their  throats in order to make the voice flexible, for by this time  the singing had become a mere vehicle for virtuosity; when  they sang their _tours de force_, the people applauded and  waved their handkerchiefs, as they did also when the preaching  pleased them. The pagans pointed the finger of scorn at the  Christians, as being mere renegades from the old religion,  and said, plausibly enough, that their worship was merely  another form of the Dionysus tragedy. There was the same altar,  the same chorus, the priest who sang and was answered by the  chorus; and the resemblance had grown to such an extent that  St. Chrysostom (350 A.D.) complained that the church chorus  accompanied its singing with theatrical gestures, which,  as we know, is simply the first step towards the dance.    This was the state of things when Gregory became Pope in  590 A.D. His additions to the modes already in use have been  explained. His great reform lay in severing the connection  between the music of the church and that of the pagan world  before it. Casting aside the declamation and rhythm, which  up to now had always dominated pure sound, he abolished the  style of church singing in vogue, and substituted for it a  system of chanting in which every tie between the words and  music was severed.    The music was certainly primitive enough, for it consisted  merely of a rising and falling of the voice for the space of  many notes on one single syllable, as, for instance,        [F: (f g f g a a) a (a a a g a g g f a)]      [W: Gloria]    The difference between this and the Ambrosian chant is evident  if we look at the following; and we must also bear in mind  that the Ambrosian chants were very simple in comparison with  the florid _tours de force_ of the Byzantine church:        [F: d  (d f) (d e) f | (g f) (g a) a | (a g) a  c' d']      [W: Al me    pater   | Ambrosi,      | nostras, preces,]      [F: (a b) a | a    g   a f e d]      [W: audi    | Christe, exaudinos]    Now this reform could not be carried out at once; it was  only through the medium of Charlemagne (742-814 A.D.),  a hundred years later, that the Gregorian chant was firmly  established. Authorized by a synod of bishops, called together  from all parts of Europe by Pope Adrian I, Charlemagne, in  774, caused all the chant and hymn books of the Ambrosian  system throughout Italy to be burned. So completely was  this accomplished that only one Ambrosian missal was found  (by St. Eugenius at Milan), and from this work alone can we  form any idea as to the character of the music used by the  followers of Ambrose, who were much retarded by the lack of  a musical notation, which was the next factor needed to bring  music to an equality with the other arts.      [07] Imitating the sound of the thing signified. Poe's       \"Raven\" has much of this character.    [08] [over-dot]c, perfect pause;  c[mid-dot], short;  c., shortest;       breathings: [reverse-apostrophe] hard;  ' soft.          VIII    FORMATION OF THE SCALE--NOTATION      In comparing the Ambrosian chant with that of Gregory, it  may be said that we have touched upon the vital principle of  modern music. The novelty in the Gregorian chant consisted in  its absolute emancipation from the tyranny of actual words  and declamation; while the idea, the poetic principle, or  religious ecstasy still remained the ideal to be expressed in  the music. Before this, as already explained, music was either  a"]]]
