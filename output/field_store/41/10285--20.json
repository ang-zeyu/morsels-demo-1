[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14883"],[0,"Grandmother Elsie (#17)"],[1," no festivities at Ion this year, bereavement was still too  recent with themselves, too imminent with those very near by the ties of  kindred. But there was to be an exchange of gifts; there had been that  even last year when but a few months had elapsed since the departure to  the better land of the beloved husband and father.    Captain Raymond, sitting quietly in his invalid chair, generally to all  appearance buried in a book, overheard many a consultation in regard to  what would be most acceptable to this or that one who happened to be  absent from the room at the moment, for it was intended that most of the  gifts, at least, should be a surprise to the recipients.    One day when the talk was of those to be provided for Rosie and Walter,  Mrs. Dinsmore noticed that their guest was listening with a very  interested look.    \"Captain Raymond,\" she said, turning to him with an engaging smile, \"we  purpose to go into the city to-morrow to shop for these things; can we do  anything in that line for you?\"    \"Thank you,\" he said heartily, his face brightening very much; \"if it  would not be overtaxing you, I should be very glad indeed to do some  shopping by proxy; glad to have the benefit of your and Mrs. Travilla's  taste and judgment in the selection of some Christmas presents for my  children. It will be all I can do for them this year. I had thought of  sending money for the purpose, to the persons in charge of them, but it  would be far more satisfactory to me to have some share in the choice of  the articles.\"    Both ladies assured him that it would give them pleasure to do whatever  they could to assist him in making the desired purchases, and Mr.  Dinsmore suggested that a variety of goods might be sent out from the city  stores for him to select from.    He said that was a good idea, but he would leave it to the ladies to have  that done, or to choose for him a book for each of his children, a doll  for each girl, and writing-desks, fully furnished, for Max and Lulu.    \"I think,\" he added with a smile, \"whatever I may give will seem to them  more valuable if sent from this distance than if bought near at hand.\"    \"Yes,\" Mrs. Dinsmore said, \"that is human nature.\"    The shoppers set out the next morning soon after breakfast, expecting to  return about the usual dinner-hour.    Watching the departure from the window near which he was seated, the  captain observed with pleasure that Violet was not of the party, hoping  that if left behind, she would give him the enjoyment of her society  during the absence of the others.    Presently she came in, bringing some needlework; Rosie and Walter with  her.    The captain closed the book he had been reading and turned toward them  with a pleased smile.    \"So I am not to be left to solitude, as I feared,\" he remarked.    \"You must please send us away, sir, whenever you think that preferable to  our company,\" returned Violet lightly.    \"Do you deem me capable of such rudeness, Miss Travilla?\" he asked with  playful look and tone.    \"We will not consider it such,\" she answered, seating herself and  beginning her work, \"since we can wander at will all over the house,  while, for the present, you, sir, are a prisoner confined to this room and  the next.\"    \"That reminds me,\" he said, \"that of late you have absented yourself a  great deal from this room; to my no small discontent.\"    \"It is flattering to my vanity and self-appreciation to learn that you  have missed me,\" she returned sportively, but with a slightly heightened  color.    \"You can never be away from the rest of us without being missed, Vi,\"  remarked Rosie; \"especially now that Sister Elsie is away.\"    \"And do you not mean to gratify my curiosity as to what has been the cause  of your many and prolonged absences, Miss Violet?\" queried the captain.    \"I have been busy elsewhere, sir. But is it not an understood thing that  curiosity is a peculiarly feminine trait?\"    \"I am able to plead guiltless to the charge of ever having made such an  insinuation,\" said the captain; \"and do now confess to having a full share  of inquisitiveness.\"    \"May I tell, Vi?\" asked Rosie.    \"We must first learn whether Captain Raymond can keep a secret,\" Vi  answered, glancing at him with a saucy smile.    \"Yes, indeed!\" he said, \"as you shall learn if you will but allow me the  opportunity.\"    \"Then I may tell I!\" cried Rosie; and hardly waiting for her sister's nod  of acquiescence, went on. \"She is preparing such a nice surprise for dear  mamma, Captain Raymond, a miniature of papa which she has been painting on  ivory. I think it looks more like him than any photograph or painted  portrait that we have. And I am sure mamma could not have a more  acceptable present. Besides that, Vi has painted two flower-pieces; one  for grandpa and one for grandma.\"    \"You have certainly been very industrious, Miss Violet,\" he remarked. \"I  have heard your studio spoken of. May I hope for the pleasure of visiting  it when I recover the free use of my limbs?\"    \"That will not be for some weeks, sir; and in the mean while I will take  your request into consideration,\" she answered demurely.    The morning passed very rapidly to the captain; the children amused him  with their prattle, and when after an hour or two, Rosie grew tired of the  bit of fancy-work she was doing under her sister's supervision, and  yielded to Walter's entreaties to \"come to the nursery and build  block-houses,\" thus leaving Violet his sole companion, the moments sped  faster than before; for he found her a very interesting and entertaining  conversationist.    On their return the shopping-party brought with them the articles he had  mentioned. He pronounced them all entirely satisfactory, and they were  packed and sent northward with the addition of some pretty things for the  dolls, contributed by Violet and Rosie.    Some unusual impulse of fatherly solicitude and affection led the captain  to put his own address upon several envelopes in each writing-desk,  stamping them also and adding a note to each of the three children.    To Max and Lulu he said that he wanted letters from them which should not  pass through the hands of a third person, \"letters that should be like a  bit of private chat with papa.\"    Seeing how tenderly and carefully the little Travillas were nurtured and  what love was lavished upon them, had turned his thoughts frequently upon  his own motherless ones, and set him to thinking and asking himself rather  anxiously how they were faring in those respects. He had come to realize  more thoroughly than ever before his responsibility as a parent.    The Christmas work which had kept Violet busy in her studio was now  finished, and henceforth she spent much more of her time with the rest of  the family; greatly to Captain Raymond's satisfaction, for much as he  admired the other ladies and enjoyed conversing with them and with Mr.  Dinsmore, he was quite conscious of a constant uneasiness and discontent  when Violet absented herself from the room.    His admiration for her beauty and grace had been unbounded from the first,  and gradually as he discovered more and more of her sterling worth, her  sweetness and unselfishness of disposition, her talent, industry, and  genuine piety, his heart had gone out to her in ardent affection; in fact  with a deeper and stronger love than he had ever before known or dreamed  of.    He began to ask himself how he could ever go away and leave her, and  whether he dared seek to make her his own. He was fully as loath as Donald  Keith to appear in the role of fortune-hunter. Would Mr. Dinsmore and his  daughter, so noble themselves, be ready to impute so unworthy a motive to  him? He hoped not, he believed they would judge him by themselves. And  they who so fully knew and appreciated all that Violet was must see and  believe that no man whose affections were not already engaged could be  thrown into intimate association with her day after day, as he had been  for so many weeks, and not learn to love her for herself alone.    Then he had learned incidentally from Dr. Conly, that the older daughter  had married a poor artist with the full consent of her parents and  grandfather, his lack of wealth being considered no objection to his suit.    Captain Raymond did not look upon wealth as the highest patent of nobility  even in this republican country, but thought, in his manly independence,  that his well-established reputation as an honorable, Christian gentleman,  and officer of the United States Navy, made him in rank fully the peer of  the Dinsmores and Travillas; and he believed that they would entirely  agree with him in that.    But he was not a conceited man, and felt by no means sure that Violet  herself would give a favorable hearing to his suit. Under the peculiar and  trying circumstances of his sojourn at Ion he had not been able to offer  her any attention, and her uniform kindness had probably been shown only  to her mother's invalid guest. And as he thought of the disparity of years  between them, and how many younger, and perhaps in every way more  attractive men, must have crossed her path, his hopes sank very low.    Yet he was not too proud to allow her the opportunity to reject him.  Saying to himself, \"Were I certain that she is indifferent to me, I would  not give her the pain of doing so--for I know her kind heart would feel it  a pain--but as I am not sure of her feelings, it is only fair and just to  her to let her know of mine and abide the issue,\" he decided that he would  not go away without speaking, yet that he would first ask the consent of  her natural guardians.    He therefore seized the first opportunity when alone with Mr. Dinsmore to  tell of his love for Violet, and ask if he could obtain his and the  mother's consent to the prosecution of his suit.    Mr. Dinsmore seemed both surprised and moved. He did not speak for a  moment, then, with a heavy sigh, \"H"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14893"],[0,"Prince Jan, St. Bernard (#17)"],[1,"and.    The little party reached the top of a bluff and turned around to look  across the rough waves. The deserted ship reeled sideways. Water rose  and hid it an instant. When next they looked, there was nothing but the  sky with threatening clouds and the wind-lashed sea.    No one spoke as they went up the pathway of a little house where the  pretty lady lived. The door was opened, they entered, and then the  pretty lady knelt suddenly beside Jan and kissed his head.    \"God bless you, Prince Jan!\" she whispered.    And though the dog did not understand it, he was very happy because he  knew they were all glad.          Chapter XIV    A FIRESIDE STORY      That evening, after supper, while Jan dozed in front of the fireplace  with its cheerful, glowing logs, and Hippity-Hop curled in a tight ball  between his paws, he did not know that the captain was telling how Jan  had been brought to the pound, sick from neglect and vicious from abuse,  to be killed.    The eyes of the young mother filled with tears, and she glanced from the  sleeping dog to a door leading into another room, where her baby was  lying, safe and warm. But when she stooped, suddenly and stroked the  dog's head gently, his eyes opened, his tail thumped the floor, and then  Jan went to sleep again, for he was very tired.    And while he took his second nap, the father of the baby explained to  the captain that he was the doctor in the little town, and had it not  been for Prince Jan, the pretty little mother and her child would never  have come back to the home on the bluff, after their visit to friends  in California.    \"Prince Jan was born in the Hospice,\" the old man told them. \"He was  only a puppy when Mr. Pixley brought him to California. To me, it never  seemed just right, taking him away from the place where he belonged and  where he could have been so useful, and then to treat him so cruelly. Of  course, the Pixleys didn't know the truth, but that didn't help poor  Jan.\"    The doctor turned and knelt down, studying the sleeping dog, then he  rose and went back to his chair.    \"I took a walking tour of Switzerland after I finished my studies in  Europe,\" he said, at last. \"So that was how I happened to be at the  Hospice the day that dog was taken away. I had heard one of the monks  tell about this dog's father, who died saving travellers on an  ice-bridge. I went on my way toward Italy, and I saw this dog start down  the trail to Martigny, the opposite direction. I have never forgotten  the pitiful look in his eyes nor the call he gave as he was led away. I  felt then that it was a tragedy, but never had an idea of what the poor  little fellow would have to suffer. Nor had I any idea that the lives  of my dear ones would be saved through him!\"    \"The only thing I ever knew about the St. Bernard dogs was that they  lived at the Hospice and went out to hunt lost people in the snow,\" the  captain spoke. \"You are the first one I ever knew who had been there. I  wish I could have seen it and those splendid dogs!\"    \"You know, the Pass of Great St. Bernard is the main road of travel  between Italy and Switzerland,\" the doctor went on, and his wife leaned  forward as eagerly as Jan's master to hear about Jan's birthplace. \"It  was through this Pass that Napoleon Bonaparte led his army of soldiers,  single file and afoot, in the month of May, 1800!\"    \"I have read about that march,\" interrupted the old man, \"and I know  what it meant, with food and ammunition and those big guns to haul. You  see, I served all through the four years of the Civil War.\"    \"May is the most dangerous time in the Alps, for the snow melts and  slides in great avalanches, often catching people with no chance for  escape. When I stood on the stone steps of the Hospice, where many feet  have worn little hollows, and I remembered how many people would never  have reached those steps without the dogs' help, I felt that though  Napoleon was a great general and a brave man, the dogs of the Hospice  were just as great and just as brave. And the monument to Barry, near  the old Hospice, was as fine in my eyes as the beautiful white marble  one that Napoleon built in memory of General de Sais, who died on that  trip, and which is in the chapel of the Hospice. Both the general and  Barry did their duty, as they saw it.\"    The little mother interrupted him, her eyes shining and her hands held  out. \"Napoleon made that march for his own glory and ambition, and to  kill those who opposed his way,\" she said, \"but Barry and the other dogs  risked death each day to save lives, with no thought of gain for  themselves.\"    \"That's what I was thinking,\" the old captain nodded and spoke.    \"What surprised me most,\" continued the doctor, \"was that the monks who  live in the Hospice do not ask pay for anything they do. The people who  stop there do not even have to pay for the food that is eaten. When I  asked how much I owed for shelter and food those two days I was there,  they smiled and told me there was no charge. Of course, I could not  leave in that way, and when I insisted, I learned there was a little box  in the Monastery Chapel for purely volunteer offerings. No one ever  watches that box, and no one is ever asked to put anything into it. And  yet,\" he finished after a little pause, \"often as many as five or six  hundred people have stopped at the Hospice in one day. I was told that  between twenty and twenty-five thousand people pass over the trail each  year. Then when one remembers that for a thousand years the ancestors of  Prince Jan have been travelling those trails and saving lives, one can  understand the splendid work of those monks and the dogs.\"    \"And to-day,\" the little mother's voice trembled, \"dear old Prince Jan  proved himself worthy of his ancestors and his heritage.\"    \"Barry saved forty-two lives. His skin has been mounted and stands,  wonderfully life-like, in the Museum of Berne,\" the doctor said,  thoughtfully. \"He did the work in the familiar places, the work he had  been trained to do; but to-day, there were ninety-two lives saved by  Prince Jan, with only his wonderful intelligence to guide him through  the sea and make him hold fast to that rope.\"    For several moments none of them spoke, but their eyes were on the dog  that slept quietly at their feet, while the little three-legged kitten  snuggled closely against his breast and purred loudly.    \"One of the most pitiful sights at the Hospice is the House of the Dead,  a short distance from the Hospice. Those who have never been identified  sleep there. Sometimes, you see, the dogs and monks are too late, or the  avalanches of melting snow uncover people who have been buried months,  or even years. The Hospice is built on solid rock, so there is no place  to dig graves. Not a tree grows within seven miles of the buildings,  because it is so cold, and there is no earth for the roots. It is a  bare, desolate place at all times.\"    \"Jan must have been bewildered, going from such a place to a home in  California,\" the little mother spoke. \"And yet, see how he worked out  his life and made himself worthy!\"    The doctor lighted a cigar and leaned back in his big chair. \"The snow  at the Hospice is not like snow in other places,\" he finally said. \"You  know how, usually, it clings in masses, and when trodden upon it packs  firmly; but in the Alps during a storm, the snow freezes as it falls and  forms into little hard pellets. These tiny lumps of ice pile up around a  traveller, and when he tries to push onward he sinks as though in a bed  of quicksand. Unless help is at hand he soon is buried out of sight. The  winds sweep fiercely through the passes between the mountain peaks, and  send terrible, whirling clouds of snow that cut the face and blind the  eyes, and many times a wanderer plunges over a precipice that he cannot  see, or worn by struggles, he sinks exhausted to die. Then, there are  the ice-bridges. What I am telling will give only a faint idea of the  importance of the work of those magnificent dogs of the Hospice. And  there is something that is not generally known, but is just as heroic.  The monks who go to the Hospice volunteer for that work, knowing fully  that five years up there in the altitude and intense cold mean  practically the end of their lives. It ruins their lungs, and so, after  a time, they go quietly down into the milder air of the Valley of the  Rhone, in France, and there they wait cheerfully during the short span  of life ahead of them. Only the young and strong monks are sent to the  Hospice.\"    After the doctor ceased speaking they all sat silently and watched the  blazing logs, for each of the listeners, as well as the doctor, was  thinking of the sacrifice and unselfishness of those monks, and the  brave loyalty of their dog-friends on the trail.    \"I wish I had enough money to send Prince Jan back to his own work and  home,\" the captain said wistfully. \"Maybe, though, I can manage it some  day,\" he added more hopefully. \"I feel as if he ought to be there with  the others.\"    \"You are right,\" agreed the doctor, and his wife nodded her head  quickly. \"Jan's work, his kin, his home, lie back there at the Hospice.  I owe the lives of my wife and my baby to him, and if you are willing to  let him go back there, I will take him back to the Hospice myself. But,  won't you miss him?\"    \"It would make me as happy as it would make him, to know he was back  there again,\" answered the old man eagerly, as he stooped over and  caressed the dog's head.    Jan, in his sleep, recognized the touch and swished his tail lightly,  but he did not open his eyes, and he never knew what the doctor and the  captain had been talking about that evening.    But when it was known in the little town that the doctor was planning to  take Prince Jan back to the Hospice, and those who had been saved from  the ship heard the story of the dog, every one wanted to help.
