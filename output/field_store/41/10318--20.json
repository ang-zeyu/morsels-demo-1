She seemed exhausted by her protracted struggle  with a man who was gaining ground daily and against whom it was  impossible for her to fight. Lupin saw in her the prey conquered in  advance, delivered to the victor's whim. Clarisse Mergy, the loving wife  of that Mergy whom Daubrecq had really murdered, the terrified mother of  that Gilbert whom Daubrecq had led astray, Clarisse Mergy, to save her  son from the scaffold, must, come what may and however ignominious the  position, yield to Daubrecq's wishes. She would be the mistress,  the wife, the obedient slave of Daubrecq, of that monster with the  appearance and the ways of a wild beast, that unspeakable person of whom  Lupin could not think without revulsion and disgust.    Sitting down beside her, gently, with gestures of pity, he made her lift  her head and, with his eyes on hers, said:    \"Listen to me. I swear that I will save your son: I swear it... Your son  shall not die, do you understand?... There is not a power on earth that  can allow your son's head to be touched as long as I am alive.\"    \"I believe you... I trust your word.\"    \"Do. It is the word of a man who does not know defeat. I shall succeed.  Only, I entreat you to make me an irrevocable promise.\"    \"What is that?\"    \"You must not see Daubrecq again.\"    \"I swear it.\"    \"You must put from your mind any idea, any fear, however obscure, of an  understanding between yourself and him... of any sort of bargain...\"    \"I swear it.\"    She looked at him with an expression of absolute security and reliance;  and he, under her gaze, felt the joy of devotion and an ardent longing  to restore that woman's happiness, or, at least, to give her the peace  and oblivion that heal the worst wounds:    \"Come,\" he said, in a cheerful tone, rising from his chair, \"all will  yet be well. We have two months, three months before us. It is more than  I need... on condition, of course, that I am unhampered in my movements.  And, for that, you will have to withdraw from the contest, you know.\"    \"How do you mean?\"    \"Yes, you must disappear for a time; go and live in the country. Have  you no pity for your little Jacques? This sort of thing would end by  shattering the poor little man's nerves... And he has certainly earned  his rest, haven't you, Hercules?\"    The next day Clarisse Mergy, who was nearly breaking down under the  strain of events and who herself needed repose, lest she should fall  seriously ill, went, with her son, to board with a friend who had a  house on the skirt of the Forest of Saint-Germain. She felt very weak,  her brain was haunted by visions and her nerves were upset by troubles  which the least excitement aggravated. She lived there for some days  in a state of physical and mental inertia, thinking of nothing and  forbidden to see the papers.    One afternoon, while Lupin, changing his tactics, was working out a  scheme for kidnapping and confining Daubrecq; while the Growler and the  Masher, whom he had promised to forgive if he succeeded, were watching  the enemy's movements; while the newspapers were announcing the  forthcoming trial for murder of Arsene Lupin's two accomplices, one  afternoon, at four o'clock, the telephone-bell rang suddenly in the flat  in the Rue Chateaubriand.    Lupin took down the receiver:    \"Hullo!\"    A woman's voice, a breathless voice, said:    \"M. Michel Beaumont?\"    \"You are speaking to him, madame. To whom have I the honour...\"    \"Quick, monsieur, come at once; Madame Mergy has taken poison.\"    Lupin did not wait to hear details. He rushed out, sprang into his  motor-car and drove to Saint-Germain.    Clarisse's friend was waiting for him at the door of the bedroom.    \"Dead?\" he asked.    \"No,\" she replied, \"she did not take sufficient. The doctor has just  gone. He says she will get over it.\"    \"And why did she make the attempt?\"    \"Her son Jacques has disappeared.\"    \"Carried off?\"    \"Yes, he was playing just inside the forest. A motor-car was seen  pulling up. Then there were screams. Clarisse tried to run, but her  strength failed and she fell to the ground, moaning, 'It's he... it's  that man... all is lost!' She looked like a madwoman.\"    \"Suddenly, she put a little bottle to her lips and swallowed the  contents.\"    \"What happened next?\"    \"My husband and I carried her to her room. She was in great pain.\"    \"How did you know my address, my name?\"    \"From herself, while the doctor was attending to her. Then I telephoned  to you.\"    \"Has any one else been told?\"    \"No, nobody. I know that Clarisse has had terrible things to bear... and  that she prefers not to be talked about.\"    \"Can I see her?\"    \"She is asleep just now. And the doctor has forbidden all excitement.\"    \"Is the doctor anxious about her?\"    \"He is afraid of a fit of fever, any nervous strain, an attack of some  kind which might cause her to make a fresh attempt on her life. And that  would be...\"    \"What is needed to avoid it?\"    \"A week or a fortnight of absolute quiet, which is impossible as long as  her little Jacques...\"    Lupin interrupted her:    \"You think that, if she got her son back...\"    \"Oh, certainly, there would be nothing more to fear!\"    \"You're sure? You're sure?... Yes, of course you are!... Well, when  Madame Mergy wakes, tell her from me that I will bring her back her son  this evening, before midnight. This evening, before midnight: it's a  solemn promise.\"    With these words, Lupin hurried out of the house and, stepping into his  car, shouted to the driver:    \"Go to Paris, Square Lamartine, Daubrecq the deputy's!\"        CHAPTER VI. THE DEATH-SENTENCE    Lupin's motor-car was not only an office, a writing-room furnished  with books, stationery, pens and ink, but also a regular actor's  dressing-room, containing a complete make-up box, a trunk filled  with every variety of wearing-apparel, another crammed with  \"properties\"--umbrellas, walking-sticks, scarves, eye-glasses and so  on--in short, a complete set of paraphernalia which enabled him to alter  his appearance from top to toe in the course of a drive.    The man who rang at Daubrecq the deputy's gate, at six o-clock that  evening, was a stout, elderly gentleman, in a black frock-coat, a bowler  hat, spectacles and whiskers.    The portress took him to the front-door of the house and rang the bell.  Victoire appeared.    Lupin asked:    \"Can M. Daubrecq see Dr. Vernes?\"    \"M. Daubrecq is in his bedroom; and it is rather late...\"    \"Give him my card, please.\"    He wrote the words, \"From Mme. Mergy,\" in the margin and added:    \"There, he is sure to see me.\"    \"But...\" Victoire began.    \"Oh, drop your buts, old dear, do as I say, and don't make such a fuss  about it!\"    She was utterly taken aback and stammered:    \"You!... is it you?\"    \"No, it's Louis XIV!\" And, pushing her into a corner of the hall,  \"Listen... The moment I'm done with him, go up to your room, put your  things together anyhow and clear out.\"    \"What!\"    \"Do as I tell you. You'll find my car waiting down the avenue. Come,  stir your stumps! Announce me. I'll wait in the study.\"    \"But it's dark in there.\"    \"Turn on the light.\"    She switched on the electric light and left Lupin alone.    \"It's here,\" he reflected, as he took a seat, \"it's here that the  crystal stopper lives... Unless Daubrecq always keeps it by him... But  no, when people have a good hiding-place, they make use of it. And this  is a capital one; for none of us... so far...\"    Concentrating all his attention, he examined the objects in the room;  and he remembered the note which Daubrecq wrote to Prasville:     \"Within reach of your hand, my dear Prasville!...    You touched it!  A little more and the trick was done...\"    Nothing seemed to have moved since that day. The same things were lying  about on the desk: books, account-books, a bottle of ink, a stamp-box,  pipes, tobacco, things that had been searched and probed over and over  again.    \"The bounder!\" thought Lupin. \"He's organized his business jolly  cleverly. It's all dove-tailed like a well-made play.\"    In his heart of hearts, though he knew exactly what he had come to do  and how he meant to act, Lupin was thoroughly aware of the danger and  uncertainty attending his visit to so powerful an adversary. It was  quite within the bounds of possibility that Daubrecq, armed as he was,  would remain master of the field and that the conversation would take an  absolutely different turn from that which Lupin anticipated.    And this prospect angered him somewhat.    He drew himself up, as he heard a sound of footsteps approaching.    Daubrecq entered.    He entered without a word, made a sign to Lupin, who had risen from  his chair, to resume his seat and himself sat down at the writing-desk.  Glancing at the card which he held in his hand:    \"Dr. Vernes?\"    \"Yes, monsieur le depute, Dr. Vernes, of Saint-Germain.\"    \"And I see that you come from Mme. Mergy. A patient of yours?\"    \"A recent patient. I did not know her until I was called in to see her,  the other day, in particularly tragic circumstances.\"    \"Is she ill?\"    \"Mme. Mergy has taken poison.\"    \"What!\"    Daubrecq gave a start and he continued, without concealing his distress:    \"What's that you say? Poison! Is she dead?\"    \"No, the dose was not large enough. If no complications ensue, I  consider that Mme. Mergy's life is saved.\"    Daubrecq said nothing and sat silent, with his head turned to Lupin.    \"Is he looking at me? Are his eyes open or shut?\" Lupin asked himself.    It worried Lupin terribly not to see his adversary's eyes, those eyes  hidden by the double obstacle of spectacles and black glasses: weak,  bloodshot eyes, Mme. Mergy had told him. How could he follow the secret  train of the man's thought without seeing the expression of his face? It  was almost like fighting an enemy who wielded an invisible sword.    Presently, Daubrecq spoke:    \"So Mme."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1565"],[0,"The Last Days of Pompeii (#17)"],[1,"with good--the  existence of suffering and of crime--in all times have perplexed the  wise.  They created a god--they supposed him benevolent.  How then came  this evil? why did he permit it--nay, why invent, why perpetuate it?  To  account for this, the Persian creates a second spirit, whose nature is  evil, and supposes a continual war between that and the god of good.  In  our own shadowy and tremendous Typhon, the Egyptians image a similar  demon.  Perplexing blunder that yet more bewilders us!--folly that arose  from the vain delusion that makes a palpable, a corporeal, a human  being, of this unknown power--that clothes the Invisible with attributes  and a nature similar to the Seen.  No: to this designer let us give a  name that does not command our bewildering associations, and the mystery  becomes more clear--that name is NECESSITY.  Necessity, say the Greeks,  compels the gods.  Then why the gods?--their agency becomes  unnecessary--dismiss them at once. Necessity is the ruler of all we  see--power, regularity--these two qualities make its nature.  Would you  ask more?--you can learn nothing: whether it be eternal--whether it  compel us, its creatures, to new careers after that darkness which we  call death--we cannot tell.  There leave we this ancient, unseen,  unfathomable power, and come to that which, to our eyes, is the great  minister of its functions. This we can task more, from this we can learn  more: its evidence is around us--its name is NATURE.  The error of the  sages has been to direct their researches to the attributes of  necessity, where all is gloom and blindness. Had they confined their  researches to Nature--what of knowledge might we not already have  achieved?  Here patience, examination, are never directed in vain.  We  see what we explore; our minds ascend a palpable ladder of causes and  effects. Nature is the great agent of the external universe, and  Necessity imposes upon it the laws by which it acts, and imparts to us  the powers by which we examine; those powers are curiosity and  memory--their union is reason, their perfection is wisdom.  Well, then,  I examine by the help of these powers this inexhaustible Nature.  I  examine the earth, the air, the ocean, the heaven: I find that all have  a mystic sympathy with each other--that the moon sways the tides--that  the air maintains the earth, and is the medium of the life and sense of  things--that by the knowledge of the stars we measure the limits of the  earth--that we portion out the epochs of time--that by their pale light  we are guided into the abyss of the past--that in their solemn lore we  discern the destinies of the future. And thus, while we know not that  which Necessity is, we learn, at least, her decrees.  And now, what  morality do we glean from this religion?--for religion it is.  I believe  in two deities--Nature and Necessity; I worship the last by reverence,  the first by investigation.  What is the morality my religion teaches?  This--all things are subject but to general rules; the sun shines for  the joy of the many--it may bring sorrow to the few; the night sheds  sleep on the multitude--but it harbors murder as well as rest; the  forests adorn the earth--but shelter the serpent and the lion; the ocean  supports a thousand barks--but it engulfs the one. It is only thus for  the general, and not for the universal benefit, that Nature acts, and  Necessity speeds on her awful course.  This is the morality of the dread  agents of the world--it is mine, who am their creature.  I would  preserve the delusions of priestcraft, for they are serviceable to the  multitude; I would impart to man the arts I discover, the sciences I  perfect; I would speed the vast career of civilizing lore: in this I  serve the mass, I fulfill the general law, I execute the great moral  that Nature preaches.  For myself I claim the individual exception; I  claim it for the wise--satisfied that my individual actions are nothing  in the great balance of good and evil; satisfied that the product of my  knowledge can give greater blessings to the mass than my desires can  operate evil on the few (for the first can extend to remotest regions  and humanize nations yet unborn), I give to the world wisdom, to myself  freedom. I enlighten the lives of others, and I enjoy my own.  Yes; our  wisdom is eternal, but our life is short: make the most of it while it  lasts. Surrender thy youth to pleasure, and thy senses to delight.  Soon  comes the hour when the wine-cup is shattered, and the garlands shall  cease to bloom.  Enjoy while you may.  Be still, O Apaecides, my pupil  and my follower!  I will teach thee the mechanism of Nature, her darkest  and her wildest secrets--the lore which fools call magic--and the mighty  mysteries of the stars. By this shalt thou discharge thy duty to the  mass; by this shalt thou enlighten thy race.  But I will lead thee also  to pleasures of which the vulgar do not dream; and the day which thou  givest to men shall be followed by the sweet night which thou  surrenderest to thyself.'    As the Egyptian ceased there rose about, around, beneath, the softest  music that Lydia ever taught, or Iona ever perfected.  It came like a  stream of sound, bathing the senses unawares; enervating, subduing with  delight.  It seemed the melodies of invisible spirits, such as the  shepherd might have heard in the golden age, floating through the vales  of Thessaly, or in the noontide glades of Paphos.  The words which had  rushed to the lip of Apaecides, in answer to the sophistries of the  Egyptian, died tremblingly away.  He felt it as a profanation to break  upon that enchanted strain--the susceptibility of his excited nature,  the Greek softness and ardour of his secret soul, were swayed and  captured by surprise.  He sank on the seat with parted lips and  thirsting ear; while in a chorus of voices, bland and melting as those  which waked Psyche in the halls of love, rose the following song:                    THE HYMN OF EROS           By the cool banks where soft Cephisus flows,           A voice sail'd trembling down the waves of air;          The leaves blushed brighter in the Teian's rose,           The doves couch'd breathless in their summer lair;           While from their hands the purple flowerets fell,           The laughing Hours stood listening in the sky;--         From Pan's green cave to AEgle's haunted cell,           Heaved the charm'd earth in one delicious sigh.           Love, sons of earth!  I am the Power of Love!           Eldest of all the gods, with Chaos born;          My smile sheds light along the courts above,           My kisses wake the eyelids of the Morn.           Mine are the stars--there, ever as ye gaze,           Ye meet the deep spell of my haunting eyes;          Mine is the moon--and, mournful if her rays,           'Tis that she lingers where her Carian lies.           The flowers are mine--the blushes of the rose,           The violet--charming Zephyr to the shade;          Mine the quick light that in the Maybeam glows,           And mine the day-dream in the lonely glade.           Love, sons of earth--for love is earth's soft lore,           Look where ye will--earth overflows with ME;          Learn from the waves that ever kiss the shore,           And the winds nestling on the heaving sea.           'All teaches love!'--The sweet voice, like a dream,           Melted in light; yet still the airs above,          The waving sedges, and the whispering stream,           And the green forest rustling, murmur'd 'LOVE!'  As the voices died away, the Egyptian seized the hand of Apaecides, and  led him, wandering, intoxicated, yet half-reluctant, across the chamber  towards the curtain at the far end; and now, from behind that curtain,  there seemed to burst a thousand sparkling stars; the veil itself,  hitherto dark, was now lighted by these fires behind into the tenderest  blue of heaven.  It represented heaven itself--such a heaven, as in the  nights of June might have shone down over the streams of Castaly.  Here  and there were painted rosy and aerial clouds, from which smiled, by the  limner's art, faces of divinest beauty, and on which reposed the shapes  of which Phidias and Apelles dreamed.  And the stars which studded the  transparent azure rolled rapidly as they shone, while the music, that  again woke with a livelier and lighter sound, seemed to imitate the  melody of the joyous spheres.    'Oh! what miracle is this, Arbaces,' said Apaecides in faltering  accents. 'After having denied the gods, art thou about to reveal to  me...'    'Their pleasures!' interrupted Arbaces, in a tone so different from its  usual cold and tranquil harmony that Apaecides started, and thought the  Egyptian himself transformed; and now, as they neared the curtain, a  wild--a loud--an exulting melody burst from behind its concealment.  With that sound the veil was rent in twain--it parted--it seemed to  vanish into air: and a scene, which no Sybarite ever more than rivalled,  broke upon the dazzled gaze of the youthful priest.  A vast banquet-room  stretched beyond, blazing with countless lights, which filled the warm  air with the scents of frankincense, of jasmine, of violets, of myrrh;  all that the most odorous flowers, all that the most costly spices could  distil, seemed gathered into one ineffable and ambrosial essence: from  the light columns that sprang upwards to the airy roof, hung draperies  of white, studded with golden stars.  At the extremities of the room two  fountains cast up a spray, which, catching the rays of the roseate  light, glittered like countless diamonds. In the centre of the room as  they entered there rose slowly from the floor, to the sound of unseen  minstrelsy, a table spread with all the viands which sense ever devoted  to fancy, and vases of that lost Myrrhine fabric, so glowing in its  colors, so transparent in its material, were crowned with the"]]]
