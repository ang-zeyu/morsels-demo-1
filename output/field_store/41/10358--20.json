I kept  waiting in tense silence to hear them come back with dead or wounded,  but there was not a sound. The rain had stopped. Mrs. Louderer struck a  match and said it was three o'clock. Soon she was asleep. Through a  rift in the clouds a star peeped out. I could smell the wet sage and  the sand. A little breeze came by, bringing Tex's song once more:--        \"Oh, it matters not, so I've been told,      How the body lies when the heart grows cold.\"    Oh, dear! the world seemed so full of sadness. I kissed my baby's  little downy head and went to sleep.    It seems that cowboys are rather sleepy-headed in the morning and it is  a part of the cook's job to get them up. The next I knew, Herman had a  tin pan on which he was beating a vigorous tattoo, all the time  hollering, \"We haf cackle-berries und antelope steak for breakfast.\"  The baby was startled by the noise, so I attended to him and then  dressed myself for breakfast. I went down to the little spring to wash  my face. The morning was lowering and gray, but a wind had sprung up  and the clouds were parting. There are times when anticipation is a  great deal better than realization. Never having seen a cackle-berry,  my imagination pictured them as some very luscious wild fruit, and I  was so afraid none would be left that I couldn't wait until the men  should eat and be gone. So I surprised them by joining the very  earliest about the fire. Herman began serving breakfast. I held out my  tin plate and received some of the steak, an egg, and two delicious  biscuits. We had our coffee in big enameled cups, without sugar or  cream, but it was piping hot and _so_ good. I had finished my egg and  steak and so I told Herman I was ready for my cackle-berries.    \"Listen to her now, will you?\" he asked. And then indignantly, \"How  many cackle-berries does you want? You haf had so many as I haf cooked  for you.\" \"Why, Herman, I haven't had a single berry,\" I said. Then  such a roar of laughter. Herman gazed at me in astonishment, and Mr.  Watson gently explained to me that eggs and cackle-berries were one  and the same.    N'Yawk was not yet up, so Herman walked over to his bed, kicked him a  few times, and told him he would scald him if he didn't turn out. It  was quite light by then. N'Yawk joined us in a few minutes. \"What the  deuce was you fellers kicking up such a rumpus fer last night?\" he  asked. \"You blamed blockhead, don't you know?\" the boss answered. \"Why,  the sheriff searched this camp last night. They had a battle down at  the bridge afterwards and either they are all killed or else no one is  hurt. They would have been here otherwise. Ward took a shot at them  once yesterday, but I guess he didn't hit; the men got away, anyway.  And durn your sleepy head! you just lay there and snored. Well, I'll be  danged!\" Words failed him, his wonder and disgust were so great.    N'Yawk turned to get his breakfast. His light shirt was blood-stained  in the back,--seemed to be soaked. \"What's the matter with your shirt,  it's soaked with blood?\" some one asked. \"Then that durned Daisy Belle  has been crawling in with me, that's all,\" he said. \"Blame his bleeding  snoot. I'll punch it and give it something to bleed for.\"    Then Mr. Watson said, \"Daisy ain't been in all night. He took Jesse's  place when he went to town after supper.\" That started an inquiry and  search which speedily showed that some one with a bleeding wound had  gotten in with N'Yawk. It also developed that Mr. Watson's splendid  horse and saddle were gone, the rope that the horse had been picketed  with lying just as it had been cut from his neck.    Now all was bustle and excitement. It was plainly evident that one of  the outlaws had lain hidden on N'Yawk's bed while the sheriff was  there, and that afterwards he had saddled the horse and made his  escape. His own horse was found in the willows, the saddle cut loose  and the bridle off, but the poor, jaded thing had never moved. By sunup  the search-party returned, all too worn-out with twenty-four hours in  the saddle to continue the hunt. They were even too worn-out to eat,  but flung themselves down for a few hours' rest. The chase was hopeless  anyway, for the search-party had gone north in the night. The wounded  outlaw had doubtless heard the sheriff talking and, the coast being  clear to the southward, had got the fresh horse and was by that time  probably safe in the heavy forests and mountains of Utah. His getting  in with N'Yawk had been a daring ruse, but a successful one. Where his  partner was, no one could guess. But by that time all the camp  excepting Herman and Mrs. Louderer were so panicky that we couldn't  have made a rational suggestion.    N'Yawk, white around his mouth, approached Mrs. Louderer. \"I want to  quit,\" he said. \"Well,\" she said, calmly sipping her coffee, \"you haf  done it.\" \"I'm sick,\" he stammered. \"I know you iss,\" she said, \"I haf  before now seen men get sick when they iss scared to death.\" \"My old  daddy--\" he began. \"Yes, I know, he waded the creek vone time und you  has had cold feet effer since.\"    Poor fellow, I felt sorry for him. I had cold feet myself just then,  and I was powerfully anxious to warm them by my own fire where a pair  of calm blue eyes would reassure me.    I didn't get to see the branding that was to have taken place on the  range that day. The boss insisted on taking the trail of his valued  horse. He was very angry. He thought there was a traitor among the  posse. Who started the firing at the bridge no one knew, and Watson  said openly that it was done to get the sheriff away from camp.    My own home looked mighty good to me when we drove up that evening. I  don't want any more wild life on the range,--not for a while, anyway.      Your ex-Washlady,      ELINORE RUPERT STEWART.          XVII    AT GAVOTTE'S CAMP           _November 16, 1912._    MY DEAR FRIEND,--    At last I can write you as I want to. I am afraid you think I am going  to wait until the \"bairns\" are grown up before writing to my friends,  but indeed I shall not. I fully intend to \"gather roses while I may.\"  Since God has given me two blessings, children and friends, I shall  enjoy them both as I go along.    I must tell you why I have not written as I should have done. All  summer long my eyes were so strained and painful that I had to let all  reading and writing go. And I have suffered terribly with my back. But  now I am able to be about again, do most of my own work, and my eyes  are much better. So now I shall not treat you so badly again. If you  could only know how kind every one is to me, you would know that even  ill health has its compensations out here. Dear Mrs. Louderer, with her  goose-grease, her bread, and her delicious \"kuchens.\" Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy, with her cheery ways, her tireless friendship, and  willing, capable hands. Gavotte even, with his tidbits of game and  fish. Dear little Cora Belle came often to see me, sometimes bringing  me a little of Grandpa's latest cure, which I received on faith, for,  of course, I could not really swallow any of it. Zebbie's nephew,  Parker Carter, came out, spent the summer with him, and they have now  gone back to Yell County, leaving Gavotte in charge again.    Gavotte had a most interesting and prosperous summer. He was  commissioned by a wealthy Easterner to procure some fossils. I had had  such a confined summer that Clyde took me out to Gavotte's camp as soon  as I was able to sit up and be driven. We found him away over in the  bad lands camped in a fine little grove. He is a charming man to visit  at any time, and we found him in a particularly happy mood. He had just  begun to quarry a gigantic find; he had piles of specimens; he had  packed and shipped some rare specimens of fossil plants, but his \"beeg  find\" came later and he was jubilant. To dig fossils successfully  requires great care and knowledge, but it is a work in which Gavotte  excels. He is a splendid cook. I almost believe he could make a Johnny  Reb like codfish, and that night we had a delicious supper and all the  time listening to a learned discourse about prehistoric things. I  enjoyed the meal and I enjoyed the talk, but I could not sleep  peacefully for being chased in my dreams by pterodactyls, dinosaurs,  and iguanodons, besides a great many horrible creatures whose names I  have forgotten. Of course, when the ground begins to freeze and snow  comes, fossil-mining is done for until summer comes, so Gavotte tends  the critters and traps this winter. I shall not get to go to the  mountains this winter. The babies are too small, but there is always  some happy and interesting thing happening, and I shall have two  pleasures each time, my own enjoyment, and getting to tell you of  them.          XVIII    THE HOMESTEADER'S MARRIAGE AND A LITTLE FUNERAL           _December 2, 1912._    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    Every time I get a new letter from you I get a new inspiration, and I  am always glad to hear from you.    I have often wished I might tell you all about my Clyde, but have not  because of two things. One is I could not even begin without telling  you what a good man he is, and I didn't want you to think I could do  nothing but brag. The other reason is the haste I married in. I am  ashamed of that. I am afraid you will think me a Becky Sharp of a  person. But although I married in haste, I have no cause to repent.  That is very fortunate because I have never had one bit of leisure to  repent in. So I am lucky all around. The engagement was powerfully  short because both agreed that the trend of events and ranch work  seemed to require that we be married first and do our \"sparking\"  afterward. You see, we had to chink in the wedding between times, that  is, between planting the oats and other work that must be done early or  not at all. In Wyoming ranchers can scarcely take time even to be  married in the springtime. That having been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16643"],[0,"Essays (#17)"],[1,"that you stole the light from  us.\" They do not yet perceive that light, unsystematic, indomitable,  will break into any cabin, even into theirs. Let them chirp awhile and  call it their own. If they are honest and do well, presently their neat  new pinfold will be too strait and low, will crack, will lean, will rot  and vanish, and the immortal light, all young and joyful, million-orbed,  million-colored, will beam over the universe as on the first morning.    2. It is for want of self-culture that the superstition of Traveling,  whose idols are Italy, England, Egypt, retains its fascination for all  educated Americans. They who made England, Italy, or Greece venerable  in the imagination did so by sticking fast where they were, like an  axis of the earth. In manly hours, we feel that duty is our place. The  soul is no traveler; the wise man stays at home, and when his  necessities, his duties, on any occasion call him from his house, or  into foreign lands, he is at home still; and shall make men sensible  by the expression of his countenance, that he goes the missionary of  wisdom and virtue, and visits cities and men like a sovereign, and not  like an interloper or a valet.    I have no churlish objection to the circumnavigation of the globe, for  the purposes of art, of study, and benevolence, so that the man is  first domesticated, or does not go abroad with the hope of finding  somewhat greater than he knows. He who travels to be amused, or to get  somewhat which he does not carry,[242] travels away from himself, and  grows old even in youth among old things. In Thebes,[243] in  Palmyra,[244] his will and mind have become old and dilapidated as  they. He carries ruins to ruins.    Traveling is a fool's paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the  indifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can  be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk,  embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples,  and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting,  identical, that I fled from.[245] I seek the Vatican,[246] and the  palaces. I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but  I am not intoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever I go.    3. But the rage of traveling is a symptom of a deeper unsoundness  affecting the whole intellectual action. The intellect is vagabond,  and our system of education fosters restlessness. Our minds travel  when our bodies are forced to stay at home. We imitate; and what is  imitation but the traveling of the mind? Our houses are built with  foreign taste; our shelves are garnished with foreign ornaments; our  opinions, our tastes, our faculties, lean, and follow the Past and the  Distant. The soul created the arts wherever they have flourished. It  was in his own mind that the artist sought his model. It was an  application of his own thought to the thing to be done and the  conditions to be observed. And why need we copy the Doric[247] or the  Gothic[248] model? Beauty, convenience, grandeur of thought, and  quaint expression are as near to us as to any, and if the American  artist will study with hope and love the precise thing to be done by  him considering the climate, the soil, the length of the day, the  wants of the people, the habit and form of the government, he will  create a house in which all these will find themselves fitted, and  taste and sentiment will be satisfied also.    Insist on yourself; never imitate.[249] Your own gift you can present  every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life's cultivation;  but of the adopted talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous,  half possession. That which each can do best, none but his Maker can  teach him. No man yet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has  exhibited it. Where is the master who could have taught  Shakespeare?[250] Where is the master who could have instructed  Franklin,[251] or Washington, or Bacon,[252] or Newton?[253] Every great  man is a unique. The Scipionism of Scipio[254] is precisely that part he  could not borrow. Shakespeare will never be made by the study of  Shakespeare. Do that which is assigned to you, and you cannot hope too  much or dare too much. There is at this moment for you an utterance  brave and grand as that of the colossal chisel of Phidias,[255] or  trowel of the Egyptians,[256] or the pen of Moses,[257] or Dante,[258]  but different from all these. Not possibly will the soul all rich, all  eloquent, with thousand-cloven tongue, deign to repeat itself; but if  you can hear what these patriarchs say, surely you can reply to them in  the same pitch of voice; for the ear and the tongue are two organs of  one nature. Abide in the simple and noble regions of thy life, obey thy  heart, and thou shalt reproduce the Foreworld[259] again.    4. As our Religion, our Education, our Art look abroad, so does our  spirit of society. All men plume themselves on the improvement of  society, and no man improves.    Society never advances. It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on  the other. It undergoes continual changes; it is barbarous, it is  civilized, it is Christianized, it is rich, it is scientific; but this  change is not amelioration. For everything that is given, something is  taken. Society acquires new arts, and loses old instincts. What a  contrast between the well-clad, reading, writing, thinking American,  with a watch, a pencil, and a bill of exchange in his pocket, and the  naked New Zealander,[260] whose property is a club, a spear, a mat,  and an undivided twentieth of a shed to sleep under! But compare the  health of the two men, and you shall see that the white man has lost  his aboriginal strength. If the traveler tell us truly, strike the  savage with a broad ax, and in a day or two the flesh shall unite and  heal as if you struck the blow into soft pitch, and the same blow  shall send the white to his grave.    The civilized man has built a coach, but has lost the use of his feet.  He is supported on crutches, but lacks so much support of muscle. He  has a fine Geneva[261] watch, but he fails of the skill to tell the  hour by the sun. A Greenwich nautical almanac[262] he has, and so  being sure of the information when he wants it, the man in the street  does not know a star in the sky. The solstice[263] he does not  observe; the equinox he knows as little; and the whole bright calendar  of the year is without a dial in his mind. His notebooks impair his  memory; his libraries overload his wit; the insurance office increases  the number of accidents; and it may be a question whether machinery  does not encumber; whether we have not lost by refinement some  energy, by a Christianity entrenched in establishments and forms, some  vigor of wild virtue. For every Stoic was a Stoic; but in Christendom  where is the Christian?    There is no more deviation in the moral standard than in the standard  of height or bulk. No greater men are now than ever were. A singular  equality may be observed between great men of the first and of the  last ages; nor can all the science, art, religion, and philosophy of  the nineteenth century avail to educate greater men than  Plutarch's[264] heroes, three or four and twenty centuries ago. Not in  time is the race progressive. Phocion,[265] Socrates, Anaxagoras,[266]  Diogenes,[267] are great men, but they leave no class. He who is  really of their class will not be called by their name, but will be  his own man, and, in his turn, the founder of a sect. The arts and  inventions of each period are only its costume, and do not invigorate  men. The harm of the improved machinery may compensate its good.  Hudson[268] and Bering[269] accomplished so much in their fishing  boats, as to astonish Parry[270] and Franklin,[271] whose equipment  exhausted the resources of science and art. Galileo, with an  opera-glass, discovered a more splendid series of celestial phenomena  than any one since. Columbus[272] found the New World in an undecked  boat. It is curious to see the periodical disuse and perishing of  means and machinery, which were introduced with loud laudation a few  years or centuries before. The great genius returns to essential man.  We reckoned the improvements of the art of war among the triumphs of  science, and yet Napoleon[273] conquered Europe by the bivouac, which  consisted of falling back on naked valor, and disencumbering it of all  aids. The Emperor held it impossible to make a perfect army, says Las  Casas,[274] \"without abolishing our arms, magazines, commissaries, and  carriages, until, in imitation of the Roman custom, the soldier should  receive his supply of corn, grind it in his handmill, and bake his  bread himself.\"    Society is a wave. The wave moves onward, but the water of which it is  composed does not. The same particle does not rise from the valley to  the ridge. Its unity is only phenomenal. The persons who make up a  nation to-day, next year die, and their experience with them.    And so the reliance on Property, including the reliance on governments  which protect it, is the want of self-reliance. Men have looked away  from themselves and at things so long, that they have come to esteem  the religious, learned, and civil institutions as guards of property,  and they deprecate assaults on these, because they feel them to be  assaults on property. They measure their esteem of each other by what  each has, and not by what each is. But a cultivated man becomes  ashamed of his property, out of new respect for his nature. Especially  he hates what he has, if he see that it is accidental,--came to him by  inheritance, or gift, or crime; then he feels that it is not having;  it does not belong to him, has no root in him, and merely lies there,  because no revolution or no robber takes it away. But that which a man  is, does always by necessity acquire, and what the man acquires is  living property,"]]]
