From 1853 till 1880 the Aouns retained  the Grand Sherifate and were supreme in Hejaz. Coming into power at a  time when Liberal ideas were in the ascendant they have consistently  been Liberal, and still represent the more humane and progressive party  among the Meccans. In the desert, where all are latitudinarian, they are  the popular party; and, though themselves beyond a suspicion of  unorthodoxy, they have always shown a tolerant spirit towards the Shiahs  and other heretics, with whom the Sherifal authority necessarily comes  in contact every year at the Haj. They have even maintained friendly  terms with the European element at Jeddah, and as long as they remained  in power the relations between India and Mecca were of an amicable  nature.    Abdallah ibn Aoun, the son of Mohammed, who succeeded his father in  1858, and reigned for nineteen years, was a man of considerable ability,  and he is credited with having had views of so advanced a nature as to  include the opening of Hejaz to European trade. Nor was his brother, who  in 1877 became Grand Sherif, of a less liberal mind. Though of less  ability than Abdallah, he is described as eminently humane and virtuous,  and it is certain that, with the exception of his hereditary enemies,  the Zeyds, he was universally beloved by the Hejazi. So much was this  the case that, in the year following the disastrous Russian war, when  Constantinople seemed on the point of dissolution, the Arabs began to  talk openly of making El Husseyn ibn Aoun Caliph in the Sultan's place.  I have not been able to ascertain that El Husseyn himself indulged the  ambitious project of his friends, for he was eminently a man of peace,  and the Caliphal title would hardly have given him a higher position  than he held. But it is certain that his popularity gave umbrage at  Constantinople, the more so as Abd el Hamid could not and dared not  depose him. El Husseyn, too, became specially obnoxious to the  reactionary party, when it resolved at last to quarrel with England, for  he and his family persisted in remaining on friendly terms with the  British Government on all occasions when the interests of Indian  subjects of her Majesty's came in question at the Haj. For this reason,  principally, it would seem his death was resolved on to make room for  the agent of a new policy.    On the 14th of March, 1880, Jeddah was the scene of a solemn pageant.  The Haj was just over, and the seaport of Mecca crowded with pilgrims  was waiting for the Grand Sherif, the descendant of the prophet and the  representative of the Sacred House of Ali, to give the blessing of his  presence to the last departing votaries. Travelling by night from Mecca,  El Husseyn and his retinue appeared at dawn outside the city walls, and  when it was morning, mounted on a white mare from Nejd, and preceded by  his escort of Koreysh Arabs and the Sultan's guard of honour, he rode  into the town. The streets of Jeddah are narrow and tortuous, and the  way from the gate to the house of Omar Nassif, his agent, where he was  accustomed to alight, was thronged with pious folk, who struggled for  the privilege of kissing his feet and the hem of his Arab cloak. He had  nearly reached the place when an old beggar from the crowd pushed his  way forward asking loudly for alms in the name of God. It was an appeal  not to be denied, and as the Sherif turned to those near him to order a  contribution from the bag kept for such distributions, the old man rose  upon him, and drawing a ragged knife (so it was described to me) struck  him in the belly. At first, even those who saw the deed hardly knew what  had happened, for El Husseyn did not fall or dismount, and without  speaking rode on to the house. There he was lifted from his mare and  carried to an upper chamber, and in the course of some hours he expired.    Those nearest him, meanwhile, had seized and cudgelled the old man, and  some of the escort had taken him to the guard-house. When it became  known what had happened, a great cry arose in Jeddah, and old and young,  and women and children, and citizens and strangers wept together. I have  heard the scene described as one beyond description moving, and the  women shrieked and wailed the whole night long. El Husseyn was beloved,  and he was taken in the flower of his manhood.    No satisfactory judicial investigation seems to have been made of the  deed, though a formal mejlis was held at Mecca whither the assassin was  immediately transferred, and on the fourth day he was publicly executed.  Who and what he was it is difficult to determine. The Turkish bulletin  on the event described him as a Persian fanatic, but no one confessed to  having known him, and those who saw and spoke to him while in custody  maintain that he was an Afghan and a Sunite. He seems to have given  half-a-dozen contradictory accounts of himself; but the general  impression remains that he came from Turkey, and was by profession a  dervish. He had not come with the Haj, but had been first noticed as a  beggar at Mecca ten days before, when he had asked and received an alms  of the Sherif, and had since been several times found obtrusively in El  Husseyn's path. No one at Jeddah holds the Turkish Governor to have been  cognisant of the crime. He was personally on good terms with El Husseyn,  and has since been disgraced; but all point to the Stamboul Camarilla  and even the Sultan himself as its author. It is known that Abd el Hamid  constantly employs dervishes as his spies and private agents, and some  who pretend to know best affirm that the old man received his mission  directly from the Caliph. I do not affect to decide upon the point, but  think the _onus probandi_ to lie with those who would deny it.    Assassination of a dangerous rival or of too powerful a chieftain has  been the resource time out of mind of the Ottoman sovereigns, and they  can hardly claim indulgence now from public opinion. The Sheykh of the  Dervishes is all powerful with his fanatical followers, and he is the  Sultan's servant; a word from him would doubtless have secured the  services of twenty such devotees. One circumstance points decidedly to  Constantinople. It is known in Jeddah that El Husseyn's successor, who  had long been resident at Constantinople, sent orders to his agent at  Jeddah to prepare for his return as Grand Sherif two months before El  Husseyn, who was a young man, died; and that he had, moreover,  dispatched most of his baggage in anticipation.    The last words of the old assassin are curious. Having done his deed he  seemed quite happy, and neither ate nor drank, but prepared for the next  world. A little while before he was executed he related a story. \"There  was once,\" he said, \"an elephant, a great and noble beast, and to him  God sent a gnat, the smallest thing which is. It stung him on the trunk  and the elephant died. Allah Kerim: God is merciful.\"    El Husseyn's successor, the man for whom room was made, and who knew  beforehand that it was to be made, was none other than the aged and  twice deposed Abd el Mutalleb, the son of the Wahhabite Ghaleb, the  fiercest fanatic of the Dewy Zeyd.    I have not room here to describe in detail the effect of this coup de  Jarnac on the political aspect of Hejaz. For the moment the reactionary  party is in power at Mecca, as it is at Constantinople. Abd el Mutalleb  is supported by Turkish bayonets, and the Aoun family and the Liberals  are suffering persecution at Mecca, while the Sherifal Court, which had  hitherto been most friendly to England, has become the focus of Indian  discontent. Outside the town all is disorder. It is sufficient for the  present if I have shown that there is in Hejaz an element of spiritual  power already existing side by side with the Sultan, of which advantage  may one day be taken to provide him with a natural successor. If no new  figure should appear on the political horizon of Islam when the Ottoman  empire dies, sufficiently commanding to attract the allegiance of the  Mussulman world (and of such there is as yet no sign), it is certainly  to the Sherifal family of Mecca that the mass of Mohammedans would look  for a representative of their supreme headship, and of that Caliphate of  which they stand in need.    The transfer of the seat of spiritual power from Constantinople to Mecca  would be an easy and natural one, and would hardly disturb the existing  ideas of the vulgar, while it would harmonize with all the traditions of  the learned. Mecca or Medina would, on the extinction of Constantinople,  become almost of necessity the legal home of the Ahl el Agde, and might  easily become the acknowledged centre of spiritual power. All whom I  have spoken to on the subject agree that the solution would be an  acceptable one to every school of Ulema except the distinctly Turkish  schools. Indeed \"Mecca, the seat of the Caliphate\" is, as far as I have  had an opportunity of judging, the cry of the day with Mussulmans; nor  is it one likely to lose strength in the future. Like the cry of \"Roma  capitale,\" it seems to exercise a strong influence on the imagination of  all to whom it is suggested, and when to that is added \"a Caliphate from  the Koreysh,\" the idea is to Arabs at least irresistible. How indeed  should it be otherwise when we look back on history?    For my own part, though I do not pretend to determine the course events  will take, I consider this notion of a return to Mecca decidedly the  most probable of all the contingencies we have reviewed, and the one  which gives the best promise of renewed spiritual life for Islam.  Politically the Caliph at Mecca would of course be less important than  now on the Bosphorus; but religiously he would have a far more assured  footing. Every year the pilgrimage from every "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1722"],[0,"Martin Luther's Large Catechism, translated (#17)"],[1,"righteousness, every blessing, and  salvation, and has delivered us poor lost men from the jaws of hell,  has won us, made us free, and brought us again into the favor and grace  of the Father, and has taken us as His own property under His shelter  and protection, that He may govern us by His righteousness, wisdom,  power, life, and blessedness.    Let this then, be the sum of this article that the little word Lord  signifies simply as much as Redeemer, i.e., He who has brought us from  Satan to God, from death to life, from sin to righteousness, and who  preserves us in the same. But all the points which follow in order in  this article serve no other end than to explain and express this  redemption, how and whereby it was accomplished, that is, how much it  cost Him, and what He spent and risked that He might win us and bring  us under His dominion, namely, that He became man, conceived and born  without [any stain of] sin, of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary,  that He might overcome sin; moreover, that He suffered, died and was  buried, that He might make satisfaction for me and pay what I owe, not  with silver nor gold, but with His own precious blood. And all this, in  order to become my Lord; for He did none of these for Himself, nor had  He any need of it. And after that He rose again from the dead,  swallowed up and devoured death, and finally ascended into heaven and  assumed the government at the Father's right hand, so that the devil  and all powers must be subject to Him and lie at His feet, until  finally, at the last day, He will completely part and separate us from  the wicked world, the devil, death, sin, etc.    But to explain all these single points separately belongs not to brief  sermons for children, but rather to the ampler sermons that extend  throughout the entire year, especially at those times which are  appointed for the purpose of treating at length of each article -- of  the birth, sufferings, resurrection, ascension of Christ, etc.    Ay, the entire Gospel which we preach is based on this, that we  properly understand this article as that upon which our salvation and  all our happiness rest, and which is so rich and comprehensive that we  never can learn it fully.    Article III.    I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy Christian Church, the communion  of saints; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; and  the life everlasting. Amen.    This article (as I have said) I cannot relate better than to  Sanctification, that through the same the Holy Ghost, with His office,  is declared and depicted, namely, that He makes holy. Therefore we must  take our stand upon the word Holy Ghost, because it is so precise and  comprehensive that we cannot find another. For there are, besides, many  kinds of spirits mentioned in the Holy Scriptures, as, the spirit of  man, heavenly spirits, and evil spirits. But the Spirit of God alone is  called Holy Ghost, that is, He who has sanctified and still sanctifies  us. For as the Father is called Creator, the Son Redeemer, so the Holy  Ghost, from His work, must be called Sanctifier, or One that makes  holy. But how is such sanctifying done? Answer: Just as the Son obtains  dominion, whereby He wins us, through His birth, death, resurrection,  etc., so also the Holy Ghost effects our sanctification by the  following parts, namely, by the communion of saints or the Christian  Church, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the  life everlasting; that is, He first leads us into His holy  congregation, and places us in the bosom of the Church, whereby He  preaches to us and brings us to Christ.    For neither you nor I could ever know anything of Christ, or believe on  Him, and obtain Him for our Lord, unless it were offered to us and  granted to our hearts by the Holy Ghost through the preaching of the  Gospel. The work is done and accomplished; for Christ has acquired and  gained the treasure for us by His suffering, death, resurrection, etc.  But if the work remained concealed so that no one knew of it, then it  would be in vain and lost. That this treasure, therefore, might not lie  buried, but be appropriated and enjoyed, God has caused the Word to go  forth and be proclaimed, in which He gives the Holy Ghost to bring this  treasure home and appropriate it to us. Therefore sanctifying is  nothing else than bringing us to Christ to receive this good, to which  we could not attain of ourselves.    Learn, then, to understand this article most clearly. If you are  asked: What do you mean by the words: I believe in the Holy Ghost? you  can answer: I believe that the Holy Ghost makes me holy, as His name  implies. But whereby does He accomplish this, or what are His method  and means to this end? Answer: By the Christian Church, the forgiveness  of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. For,  in the first place, He has a peculiar congregation in the world, which  is the mother that begets and bears every Christian through the Word of  God, which He reveals and preaches, [and through which] He illumines  and enkindles hearts, that they understand, accept it, cling to it, and  persevere in it.    For where He does not cause it to be preached and made alive in the  heart, so that it is understood, it is lost, as was the case under the  Papacy, where faith was entirely put under the bench, and no one  recognized Christ as his Lord or the Holy Ghost as his Sanctifier, that  is, no one believed that Christ is our Lord in the sense that He has  acquired this treasure for us, without our works and merit, and made us  acceptable to the Father. What, then, was lacking? This, that the Holy  Ghost was not there to reveal it and cause it to be preached; but men  and evil spirits were there, who taught us to obtain grace and be saved  by our works. Therefore it is not a Christian Church either; for where  Christ is not preached, there is no Holy Ghost who creates, calls, and  gathers the Christian Church, without which no one can come to Christ  the Lord. Let this suffice concerning the sum of this article. But  because the parts which are here enumerated are not quite clear to the  simple, we shall run over them also.    The Creed denominates the holy Christian Church, communionem  sanctorum, a communion of saints; for both expressions, taken  together, are identical. But formerly the one [the second] expression  was not there, and it has been poorly and unintelligibly translated  into German eine Gemeinschaft der Heiligen, a communion of saints. If  it is to be rendered plainly, it must be expressed quite differently in  the German idiom; for the word ecclesia properly means in German eine  Versammlung, an assembly. But we are accustomed to the word church, by  which the simple do not understand an assembled multitude, but the  consecrated house or building, although the house ought not to be  called a church, except only for the reason that the multitude  assembles there. For we who assemble there make and choose for  ourselves a particular place, and give a name to the house according to  the assembly.    Thus the word Kirche (church) means really nothing else than a common  assembly and is not German by idiom, but Greek (as is also the word  ecclesia); for in their own language they call it kyria, as in Latin it  is called curia. Therefore in genuine German, in our mother-tongue, it  ought to be called a Christian congregation or assembly (eine  christliche Gemeinde oder Sammlung), or, best of all and most clearly,  holy Christendom (eine heilige Christenheit).    So also the word communio, which is added, ought not to be rendered  communion (Gemeinschaft), but congregation (Gemeinde). And it is  nothing else than an interpretation or explanation by which some one  meant to explain what the Christian Church is. This our people, who  understood neither Latin nor German, have rendered Gemeinschaft der  Heiligen (communion of saints), although no German language speaks  thus, nor understands it thus. But to speak correct German, it ought to  be eine Gemeinde der Heiligen (a congregation of saints), that is, a  congregation made up purely of saints, or, to speak yet more plainly,  eine heilige Gemeinde, a holy congregation. I say this in order that  the words Gemeinschaft der Heiligen (communion of saints) may be  understood, because the expression has become so established by custom  that it cannot well be eradicated, and it is treated almost as heresy  if one should attempt to change a word.    But this is the meaning and substance of this addition: I believe that  there is upon earth a little holy group and congregation of pure  saints, under one head, even Christ, called together by the Holy Ghost  in one faith, one mind, and understanding, with manifold gifts, yet  agreeing in love, without sects or schisms. I am also a part and member  of the same a sharer and joint owner of all the goods it possesses,  brought to it and incorporated into it by the Holy Ghost by having  heard and continuing to hear the Word of God, which is the beginning of  entering it. For formerly, before we had attained to this, we were  altogether of the devil, knowing nothing of God and of Christ. Thus,  until the last day, the Holy Ghost abides with the holy congregation or  Christendom, by means of which He fetches us to Christ and which He  employs to teach and preach to us the Word, whereby He works and  promotes sanctification, causing it [this community] daily to grow and  become strong in the faith and its fruits which He produces.    We further believe that in this Christian Church we have forgiveness of  sin, which is wrought through the holy Sacraments and Absolution,  moreover, through all manner of consolatory promises of the entire  Gospel. Therefore, whatever is to be preached concerning the Sacraments  belongs here, and, in short, the whole Gospel and all the offices of  Christianity, which also must be preached"]]]
