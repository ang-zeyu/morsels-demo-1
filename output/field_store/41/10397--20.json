[Illustration: 111.jpg SCYTHIANS ARMED FOR WAR]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the reliefs on the silver vase       of Kul-Oba.    The few merchants who had ventured to penetrate into their country had  returned from their travels with less fanciful notions concerning the  nature of the regions frequented by them, but little continued to be  known of them, until an unforeseen occurrence obliged them to quit their  remote steppes. The Scythians, driven from the plains of the Iaxartes by  an influx of the Massagetae, were urged forwards in a westerly direction  beyond the Volga and the Don, and so great was the terror inspired by  the mere report of their approach, that the Cimmerians decided to quit  their own territory. A tradition current in Asia three centuries later,  told how their kings had counselled them to make a stand against the  invaders; the people, however, having refused to listen to their advice,  their rulers and those who were loyal to them fell by each other's  hands, and their burial-place was still shown near the banks of the  Tyras. Some of their tribes took refuge in the Chersonesus Taurica, but  the greater number pushed forward beyond the Maeotio marshes; a body of  Scythians followed in their track, and the united horde pressed onwards  till they entered Asia Minor, keeping to the shores of the Black Sea.*  This heterogeneous mass of people came into conflict first with  Urartu; then turning obliquely in a south-easterly direction, their  advance-guard fell upon the Mannai. But they were repulsed by Sargon's  generals; the check thus administered forced them to fall back speedily  upon other countries less vigorously defended. The Scythians, therefore,  settled themselves in the eastern basin of the Araxes, on the frontiers  of Urartu and the Mannai, where they formed themselves into a kind of  marauding community, perpetually quarrelling with their neighbours.**  The Cimmerians took their way westwards, and established themselves  upon the upper waters of the Araxes, the Euphrates, the Halys, and the  Thermodon,*** greatly to the vexation of the rulers of Urartu.         * The version of Aristaeas of Proconnesus, as given by       Herodotus and by Damastes of Sigsea, attributes a more       complex origin to this migration, i.e. that the Arimaspes       had driven the Issedonians before them, and that the latter       had in turn driven the Scythians back on the Cimmerians.         ** The Scythians of the tradition preserved by Herodotus       must have been the Ashguzai or Ishkuzai of the cuneiform       documents. The original name must have been Skuza, Shkuza,       with a sound in the second syllable that the Greeks have       rendered by _th_, and the Assyrians by _z_: the initial       vowel has been added, according to a well-known rule, to       facilitate the pronunciation of the combination sk, sine. An       oracle of the time of Esarhaddon shows that they occupied       one of the districts really belonging to the Mannai: and it       is probably they who are mentioned in a passage of Jer. li.       27, where the traditional reading _Aschenaz_ should be       replaced by that of Ashkuz.         *** It is doubtless to these events that the tradition       preserved by Pompeius Trogus, which is known to us through       his abbreviator Justin, or through the compilers of a later       period, refers, concerning the two Scythian princes Ylinus       and Scolopitus: they seem to have settled along the coast,       on the banks of the Thermodon and in the district of       Themiscyra.    They subsequently felt their way along the valleys of the Anti-Taurus,  but finding them held by Assyrian troops, they turned their steps  towards the country of the White Syrians, seized Sinope, where the  Greeks had recently founded a colony, and bore down upon Phrygia. It  would appear that they were joined in these regions by other hordes from  Thrace which had crossed the Bosphorus a few years earlier, and among  whom the ancient historians particularly make mention of the Treres;*  the results of the Scythian invasion had probably been felt by all the  tribes on the banks of the Dnieper, and had been the means of forcing  them in the direction of the Danube and the Balkans, whence they drove  before them, as they went, the inhabitants of the Thracian peninsula  across into Asia Minor. It was about the year 750 B.C. that the  Cimmerians had been forced to quit their first home, and towards 720  that they came into contact with the empires of the East; the Treres had  crossed the Bosphorus about 710, and the meeting of the two streams of  immigration may be placed in the opening years of the seventh century.**         * Strabo says decisively that the Treres were both       Cimmerians and Thracians; elsewhere he makes the Treres       synonymous with the Cimmerians. The Treres were probably the       predominating tribe among the people which had come into       Asia on that side.         ** Gelzer thinks that the invasion by the Bosphorus took       place about 705, and Radet about 708; and their reckoning       seems to me to be so likely to be correct, that I do not       hesitate to place the arrival of the Treres in Asia about       the time they have both indicated--roughly speaking, about       710 B.C.    The combined hordes did not at once attack Phrygia itself, but spread  themselves along the coast, from the mouths of the Ehyndakos to those of  Halys, constituting a sort of maritime confederation of which Heraclea  and Sinope were the chief towns. This confederation must not be regarded  as a regularly constituted state, but rather as a vast encampment in  which the warriors could leave their families and their spoil in safety;  they issued from it nearly every year to spread themselves over the  neighbouring provinces, sometimes in one direction, sometimes in  another. The ancient sanctuaries of Pteria and the treasures they  contained excited their cupidity, but they were not well enough equipped  to undertake the siege of a strongly fortified place, and for want  of anything better were content to hold it to ransom. The bulk of the  indigenous population lived even then in those subterranean dwellings so  difficult of access, which are still used as habitations by the tribes  on the banks of the Halys, and it is possible that they helped to  swell the marauding troops of the new-comers. In the declining years of  Sennacherib, it would appear that the Ninevite provinces possessed  an irresistible attraction for these various peoples. The fame of the  wealth accumulated in the regions beyond the Taurus and the Euphrates,  in Syria and Mesopotamia, provoked their cupidity beyond all bounds, and  the time was at hand when the fear alone of the Assyrian armies would no  longer avail to hold them in check.    The last years of Sennacherib had been embittered by the intrigues which  usually gathered around a monarch enfeebled by age and incapable of  bearing the cares of government with his former vigour. A fierce rivalry  existed between those of his sons who aspired to the throne, each of  whom possessed his following of partisans, both at court and among the  people, who were ready to support him, if need be even with the sword.    [Illustration: 115.jpg INHABITED CAVES ON THE BANKS OF THE HALYS]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph sent by Alfred Boissier.    One of these princes, probably the eldest of the king's remaining  sons,* named Assur-akhe-iddin, called by us Esarhaddon, bad already been  nominated his successor, and had received the official investiture of  the Babylonian kingdom under the name of Assur-etilmukin-pal.**         * The eldest was perhaps that Assur-nadin-shumu who reigned       in Babylon, and who was taken prisoner to Elam by King       Khalludush.         ** The idea of an enthronisation at Babylon in the lifetime       of Sennacherib, put forward by the earlier Assyriologists,       based on an inscription on a lion's head discovered at       Babylon, has been adopted and confirmed by Winckler. It was       doubtless on this occasion that Esarhaddon received as a       present from his father the objects mentioned in the       document which Sayce and Budge have called, without       sufficient reason, _The Will of Sennacherib_.    The catastrophe of 689 had not resulted in bringing about the ruin of  Babylon, as Sennacherib and his ministers had hoped. The temples, it  is true, had been desecrated and demolished, the palaces and public  buildings razed to the ground, and the ramparts thrown down, but, in  spite of the fact that the city had been set on fire by the conquerors,  the quarters inhabited by the lower classes still remained standing,  and those of the inhabitants who had escaped being carried away captive,  together with such as had taken refuge in the surrounding country or  had hidden themselves in neighbouring cities, had gradually returned  to their desolated homes. They cleared the streets, repaired the damage  inflicted during the siege, and before long the city, which was believed  to be hopelessly destroyed, rose once more with the vigour, if not with  the wealth, which it had enjoyed before its downfall. The mother of  Esarhaddon was a Babylonian, by name Nakia; and as soon as her son came  into possession of his inheritance, an impulse of filial piety moved him  to restore to his mother's city its former rank of capital. Animated  by the strong religious feeling which formed the groundwork of his  character, Esarhaddon had begun his reign by restoring the sanctuaries  which had been the cradle of the Assyrian religion, and his intentions,  thus revealed at the very outset, had won for him the sympathy of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17329"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 9 (of 12) (#17)"],[1,"rael... cast away from you all your transgressions wherein  ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit; for why  will ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death  of him that dieth... wherefore turn yourselves and live.\" 1 There were  those who objected that it was too late to dream of regeneration and of  hope in the future: \"Our bones are dried up and our hope is lost; we are  clean cut off.\" The prophet replied that the Lord had carried him in the  spirit and set him down in the midst of a plain strewn with bones. \"So  I prophesied... and as I prophesied there was a noise... and the bones  came together, bone to his bone. And I beheld, and lo, there were sinews  upon them, and flesh came up and skin covered them above; but there was  no breath in them. Then said (the Lord) unto me, Prophesy unto the wind,  prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God: Come  from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they  may live. So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into  them and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great  army. Then He said unto me... these bones are the whole house of  Israel.... Behold, I will open your graves and cause you to come up  out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of  Israel.... And I will put My Spirit in you and ye shall live, and I  will place you in your own land; and ye shall know that I the Lord hath  spoken it and performed it, saith the Lord.\"    A people raised from such depths would require a constitution, a new law  to take the place of the old, from the day when the exile should cease.  Ezekiel would willingly have dispensed with the monarchy, as it had been  tried since the time of Samuel with scarcely any good results. For every  Hezekiah or Josiah, how many kings of the type of Ahaz or Manasseh had  there been! The Jews were nevertheless still so sincerely attached to  the house of David, that the prophet judged it inopportune to exclude  it from his plan for their future government. He resolved to tolerate  a king, but a king of greater piety and with less liberty than the  compiler of the Book of Deuteronomy had pictured to himself, a servant  of the servants of God, whose principal function should be to provide  the means of worship. Indeed, the Lord Himself was the only Sovereign  whom the prophet fully accepted, though his concept of Him differed  greatly from that of his predecessors: from that, for instance, of  Amos--the Lord God who would do nothing without revealing \"His secret  unto His servants the prophets;\" or of Hosea--who desired \"mercy, and  not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.\"  The Jahveh of Ezekiel no longer admitted any intercourse with the  interpreters of His will. He held \"the son of man\" at a distance, and  would consent to communicate with him only by means of angels who were  His messengers. The love of His people was, indeed, acceptable to  Him, but He preferred their reverence and fear, and the smell of the  sacrifice offered according to the law was pleasing to His nostrils. The  first care of the returning exiles, therefore, would be to build Him  a house upon the holy mountain. Ezekiel called to mind the temple  of Solomon, in which the far-off years of his youth were spent, and  mentally rebuilt it on the same plan, but larger and more beautiful;  first the outer court, then the inner court and its chambers, and lastly  the sanctuary, the dimensions of which he calculates with scrupulous  care: \"And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides  of the entrance were five cubits on the one side and five cubits on the  other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits; and  the breadth, twenty cubits\"--and so forth, with a wealth of technical  details often difficult to be understood. And as a building so well  proportioned should be served by a priesthood worthy of it, the sons  of Zadok only were to bear the sacerdotal office, for they alone had  preserved their faith unshaken; the other Levites were to fill merely  secondary posts, for not only had they shared in the sins of the nation,  but they had shown a bad example in practising idolatry. The duties and  prerogatives of each one, the tithes and offerings, the sacrifices, the  solemn festivals, the preparation of the feasts,--all was foreseen and  prearranged with scrupulous exactitude. Ezekiel was, as we have seen, a  priest; the smallest details were as dear to him as the noblest offices  of his calling, and the minute ceremonial instructions as to the killing  and cooking of the sacrificial animals appeared to him as necessary to  the future prosperity of his people as the moral law. Towards the end,  however, the imagination of the seer soared above the formalism of the  sacrificing priest; he saw in a vision waters issuing out of the very  threshold of the divine house, flowing towards the Dead Sea through a  forest of fruit trees, \"whose leaf shall not wither, neither shall the  fruit thereof fail.\" The twelve tribes of Israel, alike those of whom  a remnant still existed as well as those which at different times  had become extinct, were to divide the regenerated land by lot among  them--Dan in the extreme north, Reuben and Judah in the south; and they  would unite to found once more, around Mount Sion, that new Jerusalem  whose name henceforth was to be Jahveh-shammah, \"The Lord is there.\"*         * Ezek. xlvii., xlviii. The image of the river seems to be       borrowed from the _vessel of water_ of Chaldaean mythology.    The influence of Ezekiel does not seem to have extended beyond a  restricted circle of admirers. Untouched by his preaching, many of the  exiles still persisted in their worship of the heathen gods; most of  these probably became merged in the bulk of the Chaldaean population,  and were lost, as far as Israel was concerned, as completely as were  the earlier exiles of Ephraim under Tiglath-pileser III. and Sargon. The  greater number of the Jews, however, remained faithful to their hopes of  future greatness, and applied themselves to discerning in passing events  the premonitory signs of deliverance. \"Like as a woman with child, that  draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her  pangs; so have we been before Thee, O Lord.... Come, my people, enter  thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself for  a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. For, behold, the  Lord cometh forth out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the  earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and  shall no more cover her slain.\"* The condition of the people improved  after the death of Nebuchadrezzar. Amil-marduk took Jehoiachin out of  the prison in which he had languished for thirty years, and treated  him with honour:** this was not as yet the restoration that had been  promised, but it was the end of the persecution.         * An anonymous prophet, about 570, in Isa. xxvi. 17, 20, 21.         ** 2 Kings xxv. 27-30; cf. Jer. lii. 31-34.    A period of court intrigues followed, during which the sceptre of  Nebuchadrezzar changed hands four times in less than seven years; then  came the accession of the peaceful and devout Nabonidus, the fall of  Astyages, and the first victories of Cyrus. Nothing escaped the vigilant  eye of the prophets, and they began to proclaim that the time was at  hand, then to predict the fall of Babylon, and to depict the barbarians  in revolt against her, and Israel released from the yoke by the  all-powerful will of the Persians. \"Thus saith the Lord to His anointed,  to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden to subdue nations before him,  and I will loose the loins of kings; to open the doors before him, and  the gates shall not be shut; I will go before thee and make the rugged  places plain: I will break in pieces the doors of brass, rend in sunder  the bars of iron: and I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and  hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I am the  Lord which call thee by thy name, even the God of Israel. For Jacob My  servant's sake, and Israel My chosen, I have called thee by thy name: I  have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known Me.\"* Nothing can stand  before the victorious prince whom Jahveh leads: \"Bel boweth down, Nebo  stoopeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: the  things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary  beast. They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the  burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.\"** \"O virgin daughter  of Babylon, sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the  Chaldaeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. Take  the millstones and grind meal: remove thy veil, strip off the train,  uncover the leg, pass through the rivers. They nakedness shall be  uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen.... Sit thou silent, and get  thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldaeans: for thou shalt no more  be called the lady of kingdoms.\"***         * Second Isaiah, in Isa. xlv. 1-4.         ** Second Isaiah, in Isa. xlvi. 1, 2.         *** Second Isaiah, in Isa. xlvii. 1-5.    The task which Cyrus had undertaken was not so difficult as we might  imagine. Not only was he hailed with delight by the strangers who  thronged Babylonia, but the Babylonians themselves were weary of their  king, and the majority of them were ready to welcome the Persian who  would rid them of him, as in old days they hailed the Assyrian kings who  delivered them from their Chaldaean lords. It is possible that towards  the end of his reign Nabonidus partly resumed the supreme power;* but  anxious for the future, and depending but little on human help, he had  sought a more powerful aid at the hands of the gods. He had apparently  revived some of "]]]
