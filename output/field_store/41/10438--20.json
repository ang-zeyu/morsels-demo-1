These principles are manifestly not 'laws' of  thought in the sense in which 'law' is used in Psychology; they do not  profess to describe the actual mental processes that take place in  judgment or reasoning, as the 'laws of association of ideas' account for  memory and recollection. They are not natural laws of thought; but, in  relation to thought, can only be regarded as laws when stated as  precepts, the observance of which (consciously or not) is necessary to  clear and consistent thinking: e.g., Never assume that the same thing  can both be and not be.    However, treating Logic as the science of thought only as embodied in  propositions, in respect of which evidence is to be adduced, or which  are to be used as evidence of other propositions, the above laws or  principles must be restated as the conditions of consistent argument in  such terms as to be directly applicable to propositions. It was shown in  the chapter on the connotation of terms, that terms are assumed by  Logicians to be capable of definite meaning, and of being used  univocally in the same context; if, or in so far as, this is not the  case, we cannot understand one another's reasons nor even pursue in  solitary meditation any coherent train of argument. We saw, too, that  the meanings of terms were related to one another: some being full  correlatives; others partially inclusive one of another, as species of  genus; others mutually incompatible, as contraries; or alternatively  predicable, as contradictories. We now assume that propositions are  capable of definite meaning according to the meaning of their component  terms and of the relation between them; that the meaning, the fact  asserted or denied, is what we are really concerned to prove or  disprove; that a mere change in the words that constitute our terms, or  of construction, does not affect the truth of a proposition as long as  the meaning is not altered, or (rather) as long as no fresh meaning is  introduced; and that if the meaning of any proposition is true, any  other proposition that denies it is false. This postulate is plainly  necessary to consistency of statement and discourse; and consistency is  necessary, if our thought or speech is to correspond with the unity and  coherence of Nature and experience; and the Laws of Thought or  Conditions of Immediate Inference are an analysis of this postulate.    Sec. 4. The principle of Identity is usually written symbolically thus: _A  is A; not-A is not-A_. It assumes that there is something that may be  represented by a term; and it requires that, in any discussion, _every  relevant term, once used in a definite sense, shall keep that meaning  throughout_. Socrates in his father's workshop, at the battle of Delium,  and in prison, is assumed to be the same man denotable by the same name;  and similarly, 'elephant,' or 'justice,' or 'fairy,' in the same  context, is to be understood of the same thing under the same  _suppositio_.    But, further, it is assumed that of a given term another term may be  predicated again and again in the same sense under the same conditions;  that is, we may speak of the identity of meaning in a proposition as  well as in a term. To symbolise this we ought to alter the usual  formula for Identity and write it thus: _If B is A, B is A; if B is  not-A, B is not-A_. If Socrates is wise, he is wise; if fairies frequent  the moonlight, they do; if Justice is not of this world, it is not.  _Whatever affirmation or denial we make concerning any subject, we are  bound to adhere to it for the purposes of the current argument or  investigation._ Of course, if our assertion turns out to be false, we  must not adhere to it; but then we must repudiate all that we formerly  deduced from it.    Again, _whatever is true or false in one form of words is true or false  in any other_: this is undeniable, for the important thing is identity  of meaning; but in Formal Logic it is not very convenient. If Socrates  is wise, is it an identity to say 'Therefore the master of Plato is  wise'; or, further that he 'takes enlightened views of life'? If _Every  man is fallible_, is it an identical proposition that _Every man is  liable to error_? It seems pedantic to demand a separate proposition  that _Fallible is liable to error_. But, on the other hand, the  insidious substitution of one term for another speciously identical, is  a chief occasion of fallacy. How if we go on to argue: therefore, _Every  man is apt to blunder, prone to confusion of thought, inured to  self-contradiction_? Practically, the substitution of identities must be  left to candour and good-sense; and may they increase among us. Formal  Logic is, no doubt, safest with symbols; should, perhaps, content itself  with A and B; or, at least, hardly venture beyond Y and Z.    Sec. 5. The principle of Contradiction is usually written symbolically,  thus: _A is not not-A_. But, since this formula seems to be adapted to a  single term, whereas we want one that is applicable to propositions, it  may be better to write it thus: _B is not both A and not-A_. That is to  say: _if any term may be affirmed of a subject, the contradictory term  may, in the same relation, be denied of it_. A leaf that is green on one  side of it may be not-green on the other; but it is not both green and  not-green on the same surface, at the same time, and in the same light.  If a stick is straight, it is false that it is at the same time  not-straight: having granted that two angles are equal, we must deny  that they are unequal.    But is it necessarily false that the stick is 'crooked'; must we deny  that either angle is 'greater or less' than the other? How far is it  permissible to substitute any other term for the formal contradictory?  Clearly, the principle of Contradiction takes for granted the principle  of Identity, and is subject to the same difficulties in its practical  application. As a matter of fact and common sense, if we affirm any term  of a Subject, we are bound to deny of that Subject, in the same  relation, not only the contradictory but all synonyms for this, and also  all contraries and opposites; which, of course, are included in the  contradictory. But who shall determine what these are? Without an  authoritative Logical Dictionary to refer to, where all contradictories,  synonyms, and contraries may be found on record, Formal Logic will  hardly sanction the free play of common sense.    The principle of Excluded Middle may be written: _B is either A or  not-A_; that is, _if any term be denied of a subject, the contradictory  term may, in the same relation, be affirmed_. Of course, we may deny  that a leaf is green on one side without being bound to affirm that it  is not-green on the other. But in the same relation a leaf is either  green or not-green; at the same time, a stick is either bent or  not-bent. If we deny that A is greater than B, we must affirm that it is  not-greater than B.    Whilst, then, the principle of Contradiction (that 'of contradictory  predicates, one being affirmed, the other is denied ') might seem to  leave open a third or middle course, the denying of both  contradictories, the principle of Excluded Middle derives its name from  the excluding of this middle course, by declaring that the one or the  other must be affirmed. Hence the principle of Excluded Middle does not  hold good of mere contrary terms. If we deny that a leaf is green, we  are not bound to affirm it to be yellow; for it may be red; and then we  may deny both contraries, yellow and green. In fact, two contraries do  not between them cover the whole predicable area, but contradictories  do: the form of their expression is such that (within the _suppositio_)  each includes all that the other excludes; so that the subject (if  brought within the _suppositio_) must fall under the one or the other.  It may seem absurd to say that Mont Blanc is either wise or not-wise;  but how comes any mind so ill-organised as to introduce Mont Blanc into  this strange company? Being there, however, the principle is inexorable:  Mont Blanc is not-wise.    In fact, the principles of Contradiction and Excluded Middle are  inseparable; they are implicit in all distinct experience, and may be  regarded as indicating the two aspects of Negation. The principle of  Contradiction says: _B is not both A and not-A_, as if _not-A_ might be  nothing at all; this is abstract negation. But the principle of Excluded  Middle says: _Granting that B is not A, it is still something_--namely,  _not-A_; thus bringing us back to the concrete experience of a continuum  in which the absence of one thing implies the presence of something  else. Symbolically: to deny that B is A is to affirm that B is not A,  and this only differs by a hyphen from B is not-A.    These principles, which were necessarily to some extent anticipated in  chap. iv. Sec. 7, the next chapter will further illustrate.    Sec. 6. But first we must draw attention to a maxim (also already  mentioned), which is strictly applicable to Immediate Inferences, though  (as we shall see) in other kinds of proof it may be only a formal  condition: this is the general caution _not to go beyond the evidence_.  An immediate inference ought to contain nothing that is not contained  (or formally implied) in the proposition by which it is proved. With  respect to quantity in denotation, this caution is embodied in the rule  'not to distribute any term that is not given distributed.' Thus, if  there is a predication concerning 'Some S,' or 'Some men,' as in the  forms I. and O., we cannot infer anything concerning 'All S.' or 'All  men'; and, as we have seen, if a term is given us preindesignate, we are  generally to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18444"],[0,"The Story of the Hymns and Tunes (#17)"],[1," The hymn is  certainly _one_ of the greatest in the language. It appeared as No. 7 in  Watts' third edition (about 1710) containing five stanzas. The second  line--        On which the Prince of Glory died,    --read originally--        Where the young Prince of Glory died.    Only four stanzas are now generally used. The omitted one--        His dying crimson like a robe        Spreads o'er His body on the tree;      Then am I dead to all the globe,        And all the globe is dead to me.    --is a flash of tragic imagination, showing the sanguine intensity of  Christian vision in earlier time, when contemplating the Saviour's  passion; but it is too realistic for the spirit and genius of  song-worship. That the great hymn was designed by the writer for  communion seasons, and was inspired by Gal. 6:14, explains the two last  lines if not the whole of the highly colored verse.      _THE TUNE._    One has a wide field of choice in seeking the best musical  interpretation of this royal song of faith and self-effacement:        When I survey the wondrous Cross        On which the Prince of Glory died,      My richest gain I count but loss,        And pour contempt on all my pride.        Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast        Save in the death of Christ my God;      All the vain things that charm me most,        I sacrifice them to His blood.        See from His head, His hands, His feet,        Sorrow and love flow mingled down;      Did e'er such love and sorrow meet;        Or thorns compose so rich a crown?        Were the whole realm of Nature mine,        That were a present far too small;      Love so amazing, so divine,        Demands my soul, my life, my all.    To match the height and depth of these words with fitting glory of sound  might well have been an ambition of devout composers. Rev. G.C. Wells'  tune in the _Revivalist_, with its emotional chorus, I.B. Woodbury's  \"Eucharist\" in the _Methodist Hymnal_, Henry Smart's effective choral in  Barnby's _Hymnary_ (No. 170), and a score of others, have woven the  feeling lines into melody with varying success. Worshippers in spiritual  sympathy with the words may question if, after all, old \"Hamburg,\" the  best of Mason's loved Gregorians, does not, alone, in tone and  elocution, rise to the level of the hymn.      \"LOVE DIVINE, ALL LOVES EXCELLING.\"    This evergreen song-wreath to the Crucified, was contributed by Charles  Wesley, in 1746. It is found in his collection of 1756, _Hymns for Those  That Seek and Those That Have Redemption in the Blood of Jesus Christ_.        Love Divine all loves excelling,        Joy of Heaven to earth come down,      Fix in us Thy humble dwelling,        All Thy faithful mercies crown.           *       *       *       *       *        Come Almighty to deliver,        Let us all Thy life receive,      Suddenly return, and never,        Nevermore Thy temples leave.           *       *       *       *       *        Finish then Thy new creation;        Pure and spotless let us be;      Let us see our whole salvation        Perfectly secured by Thee.        Changed from glory into glory        Till in Heaven we take our place,      Till we cast our crowns before Thee        Lost in wonder, love and praise!    The hymn has been set to H. Isaac's ancient tune (1490), to Wyeth's  \"Nettleton\" (1810), to Thos. H. Bailey's (1777-1839) \"Isle of Beauty,  fare thee well\" (named from Thomas Moore's song), to Edward Hopkins'  \"St. Joseph,\" and to a multitude of others more or less familiar.    Most familiar of all perhaps, (as in the instance of \"Far from mortal  cares retreating,\") is its association with \"Greenville,\" the production  of that brilliant but erratic genius and freethinker, Jean Jacques  Rousseau. It was originally a love serenade, (\"Days of absence, sad and  dreary\") from the opera of _Le Devin du Village_, written about 1752.  The song was commonly known years afterwards as \"Rousseau's Dream.\" But  the unbelieving philosopher, musician, and misguided moralist builded  better than he knew, and probably better than he meant when he wrote his  immortal choral. Whatever he heard in his \"dream\" (and one legend says  it was a \"song of angels\") he created a harmony dear to the church he  despised, and softened the hearts of the Christian world towards an evil  teacher who was inspired, like Balaam, to utter one sacred strain.    Rousseau was born in Geneva, 1712, but he never knew his mother, and  neither the affection or interest of his father or of his other  relatives was of the quality to insure the best bringing up of a child.    He died July, 1778. But his song survives, while the world gladly  forgets everything else he wrote. It is almost a pardonable exaggeration  to say that every child in Christendom knows \"Greenville.\"      \"WHEN ALL THY MERCIES, O MY GOD.\"    This charming hymn was written by Addison, the celebrated English poet  and essayist, about 1701, in grateful commemoration of his delivery from  shipwreck in a storm off the coast of Genoa, Italy. It originally  contained thirteen stanzas, but no more than four or six are commonly  sung. It has put the language of devotional gratitude into the mouths of  thousands of humble disciples who could but feebly frame their own:        When all Thy mercies, O my God        My rising soul surveys,      Transported with the view I'm lost        In wonder, love and praise.        Unnumbered comforts on my soul        Thy tender care bestowed      Before my infant heart conceived        From whom those comforts flowed.        When in the slippery paths of youth        With heedless steps I ran,      Thine arm unseen conveyed me safe,        And led me up to man.    Another hymn of Addison--        How are Thy servants bless'd, O Lord,    --was probably composed after the same return from a foreign voyage. It  has been called his \"Traveller's Hymn.\"    Joseph Addison, the best English writer of his time, was the son of  Lancelot Addison, rector of Milston, Wiltshire, and afterwards Dean of  Litchfield. The distinguished author was born in Milston Rectory, May 1,  1672, and was educated at Oxford. His excellence in poetry, both English  and Latin, gave him early reputation, and a patriotic ode obtained for  him the patronage of Lord Somers. A pension from King William III.  assured him a comfortable income, which was increased by further honors,  for in 1704 he was appointed Commissioner of Appeals, then secretary of  the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and in 1717 Secretary of State. He died  in Holland House, Kensington, near London, June 17, 1719.    His hymns are not numerous, (said to be only five), but they are  remarkable for the simple beauty of their style, as well as for their  Christian spirit. Of his fine metrical version of the 23rd Psalm,--        The Lord my pasture shall prepare,      And feed me with a shepherd's care,    --one of his earliest productions, the tradition is that he gathered its  imagery when a boy living at Netheravon, near Salisbury Plain, during  his lonely two-mile walks to school at Amesbury and back again. All his  hymns appeared first in the _Spectator_, to which he was a prolific  contributor.      _THE TUNE._    The hymn \"When all Thy mercies\" still has \"Geneva\" for its vocal mate in  some congregational manuals. The tune is one of the rare survivals of  the old \"canon\" musical method, the parts coming in one after another  with identical notes. It is always delightful as a performance with its  glory of harmony and its sweet duet, and for generations it had no other  words than Addison's hymn.    John Cole, author of \"Geneva,\" was born in Tewksbury, Eng., 1774, and  came to the United States in his boyhood (1785). Baltimore, Md. became  his American home, and he was educated there. Early in life he became a  musician and music publisher. At least twelve of his principal song  collections from 1800 to 1832 are mentioned by Mr. Hubert P. Main, most  of them sacred and containing many of his own tunes.    He continued to compose music till his death, Aug. 17, 1855. Mr. Cole  was leader of the regimental band known as \"The Independent Blues,\"  which played in the war of 1812, and was present at the \"North Point\"  fight, and other battles.    Besides \"Geneva,\" for real feeling and harmonic beauty \"Manoah,\" adapted  from Haydn's Creation, deserves mention as admirably suited to  \"Addison's\" hymn, and also \"Belmont,\" by Samuel Webbe, which resembles  it in style and sentiment.    Samuel Webbe, composer of \"Belmont,\" was of English parentage but was  born in Minorca, Balearic Islands, in 1740, where his father at that  time held a government appointment; but his father, dying suddenly, left  his family poor, and Samuel was apprenticed to a cabinet-maker. He  served his apprenticeship, and immediately repaired to a London teacher  and began the study of music and languages. Surmounting great  difficulties, he became a competent musician, and made himself popular  as a composer of glees. He was also the author of several masses,  anthems, and hymn-tunes, the best of which are still in occasional use.  Died in London, 1816.      \"JESUS, I LOVE THY CHARMING NAME.\"    When Dr. Doddridge, the author of this hymn, during his useful ministry,  had finished the preparation of a pulpit discourse that strongly  impressed him, he was accustomed, while his heart was yet glowing with  the sentiment that had inspired him, to put the principal thoughts into  metre, and use the hymn thus written at the conclusion of the preaching  of the sermon. This hymn of Christian ardor was written to be sung after  a sermon from Romans 8:35, \"Who shall separate us from the love of  Christ?\"        Jesus, I love Thy charming name,       'Tis music to mine ear:      Fain would I sound it out so loud        That earth and heaven should hear.           *       *       *       *       *        I'll speak the honors of Thy name        With my last laboring breath,"]]]
