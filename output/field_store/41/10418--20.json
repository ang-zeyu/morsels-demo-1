She and her flowers have already been noticed in Mrs. Gore's  Season in Paris, who used to pay her frequent visits, for who indeed  would go anywhere else who had once dealt with her, for what more can  one desire than civility, good nature, reasonable charges, and a  constant variety of the choicest articles; I therefore can  conscientiously recommend all my readers who come to Paris, and are  amateurs of Flora, to call now and then on Madame Adde, No. 6, _Place  de la Madeleine_.    Now having contemplated the beauties of art and of nature, let us  observe some animated specimens of her works: what a moving mass is  before us, 'tis a merry scene, the laughing children running after, and  dodging each other, rolling on the ground with the plenitude of their  mirth, the neat looking _bonnes_ (nursery maids) still smiling while  they chide, the jovial coachmen wrestling on their stands and playing  like boys together, but all in good humour, and content seems to sit on  every brow, and even the aged as they meet, greet each other with a  smile. How infectious is cheerfulness, when I have the blue devils I  always go and take a walk on the _Boulevards_; and what makes these  people so happy? is the natural question; because they are content with  a little, and pleased with a trifle; then they are a trifling people is  the reply. What boots it I would ask? happiness is all that we desire,  and I persist that those are the best philosophers who can obtain  happiness with the least means. But how the green trees, the white stone  houses, the gay looking shops, the broad road with the equipages rolling  along all contribute to heighten the animation of the scene. We are now  at the _Rue de la Paix_; it is certainly a noble street, and we will  turn down it to look at the statue of Napoleon on the column in the  _Place Vendome_; the pillar, which was cast from the cannon taken from  the enemies of France, is decidedly a work of extraordinary merit and  beauty, and requires a good deal of study to appreciate the exquisite  workmanship displayed in its execution. But if it were not for the  reminiscences associated with the character of Napoleon, who could ever  admire his statue on the top of the column, in a costume so contrary to  all that is graceful and dignified; a little cocked hat with its horrid  stiff angles, a great coat with another angle sticking out, the _tout  ensemble_ presenting a deformity rather than an ornament: however there  he stands on the pinnacle of what he and men in general would call the  monument of his glory, a memento of blood, of tears of widows and  orphans. Could the names of those ruined and heart broken beings be  inscribed upon it, whose misery was wrought by his triumphs, it would  indeed tell a tale of woe. The _Place Vendome_, in which the column  stands, has a very noble appearance, being a fine specimen of the style  of building of Louis the Fourteenth, in whose reign it was erected; and  he too fed his ambition with wholesale flow of blood, and with treasure  wreaked from the hard earned labour of his subjects, and the abridgments  of their comforts, but both were ultimately destined to chew the bitter  cud of mortification, and however bright the sun by which they rose to  imaginary glory, they were doomed to set in a starless night. But let us  turn from these lugubrious images of war, and regain the _Boulevards_  and enjoy the pleasure of beholding a peaceful people. Do not let us  fail to observe that beautiful mansion at the corner of the _rue  Lafitte_; it is called the _Cite Italienne_, and can only be compared to  a palace, the richness of the carve-work surpassing any thing of the  description throughout the whole capital; although it has recently  become so much the mode to adorn their houses with sculpture, yet none  have arrived at the same degree of perfection displayed in the _Maison  d'or_: carved out on the solid stone is a boar hunt, which is really  executed with considerable talent; to give an accurate description of  all its beauties would much exceed the space I could afford it in  justice to other objects; it is very extensive, and is I believe three  houses united in one. I have understood that the sum total expended upon  it was 1,600,000 _francs_, or 64,000_l._ But that my readers may form  some idea of the interior, I recommend them to enter the _Ancien Cafe  Hardy_, which is established as a _Restaurant_ within this beautiful  building, and however interested my countrymen may feel in all that is  intellectual, yet at the same time they possess that much of the  sensual, as to have a very strong predilection for a good dinner, of the  quality of which few are better judges; but with them it is not only as  regards the excellence of the viands, but also they have their peculiar  tastes as to how and where it is served; knowing so well their ideas in  this respect, I can recommend them with confidence to _Messieurs Verdier  and Dauzier_, convinced that all their different fancies will be  gratified. If they wish to be exclusive, to enjoy their meal tete-a-tete  with their friend, they will find an elegant little apartment suited to  their wishes; if they be three or four or more persons, they will still  find they can be accommodated in such a manner that they may always  imagine themselves at home; in fact there are about twenty apartments of  different sizes, which are decorated in the most handsome style, yet all  varying with regard to the pattern of the furniture, and all uniting an  appearance of comfort and elegance, the sofa, chairs, and curtains of  each little cabinet being of the richest silk, and the other decorations  are consistently luxurious. The view from the windows presents all that  can be imagined that is amusing and animating, overlooking the most  agreeable part of the _Boulevards_, being that which is designated the  _Boulevard Italien_, and is the most fashionable resort in Paris. By the  aid of a _calorifere_, the whole establishment is heated to an  agreeable degree of warmth, but for those who like to see a cheering  blaze there are chimneys which afford them the means of having that  indulgence. If they prefer dining in the public saloon, for the sake of  seeing the variety of visiters by which it is frequented, they will find  a most splendid apartment brilliantly fitted up, being entirely of white  and gold, where every thing that is useful will be found, but always so  arranged as to be rendered ornamental; in the elegant chandeliers by  which the apartment is adorned, oil on a purified principle is burned;  no attention in short has been omitted which could tend towards  rendering the establishment an attraction for the English. I happened to  be there when an apartment was arranged for a wedding party, and nothing  could exceed the taste and elegance with which the table was disposed,  presenting a perfect picture, where splendour and luxury abounded, but  yet where a certain degree of consistency was preserved. With regard to  the superior quality of the different delicacies which are provided, and  the culinary talent displayed in their preparation, even Vatel himself  might be more than satisfied. I have visited all the most celebrated  _Restaurants_ in Paris, and should certainly say, that for the good  quality of the articles of the table, for the comfortable arrangements  of the apartments, and attentive civility of the attendants, there is  not any that can surpass the _Cafe Hardy_, although many there are which  are infinitely more expensive. Continuing our walk upon the  _Boulevards_, it is worthy of remark how richly some of the new houses  in and about the _Rue Richelieu_ are sculptured, so as to present the  appearance of a succession of palaces, we next arrive at the _Boulevard  Montmartre_, where the influx of people is the greatest: we pass by the  _Passage des Panoramas_ but do not enter it just now, although it  contains some of the handsomest shops in Paris, but it is too crowded,  we prefer keeping our course on the _Boulevards_ where we can look about  us at our ease and contemplate the physiognomies of the varied groups  before us; let us halt a while at the Theatre _des Varietes_ and remark  with what eagerness numbers stop to scan the programme of the  entertainments for the evening, amongst them are all ages, all classes,  the common soldier, porter, and servant girl, all possessing a high idea  of their judgment in theatrical affairs; passing on a little further the  Theatre _du Gymnase_ arrests the observer's notice, where _Bouffe_ has  so long displayed his comic powers, which certainly in my recollection  have never been surpassed, and I doubt if they ever have been equalled;  there is ever a chasteness in his acting, from which he never departs,  and keeps the audience in a roar of laughter without ever having  recourse to grimace or buffoonery.    The stupendous _Porte_ (gate) _St Denis_ next strikes the eye, and has a  most imposing effect; it was built by Louis XIV in commemoration of his  victories, as I have before stated; the _bas-reliefs_ with which it is  adorned represent pyramids, and colossal allegorical figures of Holland  and the Rhine, the capture of Maestricht, the passage of the Rhine at  Tolhuys, which with two lions are its most conspicuous ornaments. Whilst  the mind is still occupied in reflecting upon this noble monument,  another awakens attention at a short distance from the last; it is the  _Porte St-Martin_, _Boulevard St-Martin_, which has been represented as  a copy of that of St-Severus at Rome; it owes its erection to the same  founder and was raised for the same purpose, that of publishing to  posterity the fame of his victories; he is allegorically represented as  Hercules defeating the Germans, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17763"],[0,"The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow (#17)"],[1,"can give definite news of this    Frenchwoman's whereabouts.      Police Headquarters, Mulberry St.    This notice, appended to such particulars of the tragedy as appeared in  all the morning papers, roused the city--I may even say the country--to  even greater wonder and excitement than had followed the first details  given in the journals of the evening before.    Would anything come of it?    Morning passed; no news of Antoinette Duclos.    Afternoon: messages of all kinds leading to much work, but bringing no  result.    Five o'clock: a missive from the directors of the museum to the effect  that under the peculiar circumstances and the seeming absence of any  friends of the deceased, they would be glad to furnish the means  necessary to the proper care and burial of the young woman killed in such  an unhappy manner within their walls.    A half-hour later, Gryce, for whose appearance the Inspector had been  anxiously waiting, came in with his report. A chair was pushed up for  him, for he was an old man and had had a sleepless night, as we know,  besides two days of continued work. But he did not drop into it, as the  Inspector expected, or give any other signs of exceptional fatigue; yet  when he had seated himself and they were left alone, he did not hasten to  speak, though he evidently had much to say, but remained quiet, holding  counsel, as it were, in his old way, with some small object he had picked  up from the desk before him.    At last the Inspector spoke:    \"You have been on the hunt; what did you find?\"    \"Not much, Inspector--and yet enough to disturb me in a way I was not  looking for. Of course, in studying the situation carefully, you have  asked yourself how the man who shot the arrow from behind the upper  pedestal got away. He did not wait as Travis did till the first  excitement had abated and the way was, in a manner, cleared for an escape  into the court. For X, as we will call him, was certainly among those I  saw lined up before me at the moment I bade them one and all to return  and stand until released, in the exact spot occupied by them when the  first alarm rang out. After the surprise Travis gave us we had the  building searched from roof to cellar. Not another soul was found in it  whose name was not registered on the chart. As I have already said, the  guilty one had managed to escape immediately upon the flight of the  arrow, though how, even then, he could have got below in the time he did  is a mystery which trips me up every time I think of it. But letting that  go for the present, he did get there and get there unnoticed. How? Now,  there are three ways of escape from behind either of those pedestals. The  way Travis took, that is, toward the front, and round through the suite  of rooms headed by the one marked H, to the rear staircase; the more  direct one of an immediate exit from the gallery through Sections VI and  VII to this same staircase; and (the only one worth considering) a  straight plunge for the door behind the tapestry and so down by the  winding staircase beyond, into the Curator's office. The unknown never  went Travis' way, and he couldn't have gone the other without running  into the arms of Correy; so he must have made use of the hidden door. So  convinced was I of this, after last night's discovery eliminated Travis  as a suspect, that I made it my first duty this morning to examine this  door and the mysterious little passageway back of it. When first notified  of this door, we had been assured that it had not been opened in years,  that the only key remaining to it was the one the Curator showed us  hanging from the ring he drew from his own pocket; and acting upon these  statements, which I would not allow myself to doubt for a moment, we  decided to open the door in our own way, which we immediately did. The  result was the instant discovery that some one had passed through this  door and down these stairs very much later than years ago. We could see,  without taking a step beyond the doorway, traces of a well-shod foot in  the dust lying thickly on every tread. These traces were so many and so  confused that I left them for Stevens' experienced eye and deft  manipulation to separate and make plain to us. He is making an  examination of them now, and will be able to report to you before night.\"    The Inspector was a man of little pretense. He felt startled and showed  it.    \"But this is a serious matter, Gryce.\"    \"Very serious.\"    \"No mere visitor to the museum would have presumed upon this venture.\"    \"No.\"    \"Which means----\"    \"That some one actively connected with it had a guilty hand in this  deplorable affair.\"    \"I am afraid so.\"    \"Some one well acquainted with the existence of this door and who had  means of opening it. The question is--who?\"    In saying this, Mr. Gryce studiously avoided the Inspector's eye; while  the Inspector in his turn looked up, then down--anywhere but in the  detective's direction. It was a moment of mutual embarrassment, broken,  when it was broken, by a remark which manifestly avoided the issue.    \"Possibly those traces you speak of were not made at the time you  specify. They may have been made since, or they may have been made  before. Perhaps the Curator was curious and tried his hand at a little  detective work on his own account.\"    \"He hadn't the chance. Every portion of the building has been very  thoroughly guarded since first we entered it. He may have gone up prior  to the shooting. That is open to dispute; but if he had done so, why did  he not inform us of the fact when he showed us the key? The Curator is  the soul of honor. He would hardly deceive us in so important a matter.\"    The quick glance which this elicited from the Inspector awoke no  corresponding flash in the eye of the imperturbable detective. He  continued to shake his head over the small object he was twirling  thoughtfully about between his thumb and finger, and only from his  general seriousness could the Inspector gather that his mind was no more  at rest than his fingers. Was this why his remark took the form of a  question?    \"Where was the Curator when you forced open that door behind the  tapestry? Was he anywhere in the building?\"    \"No, sir; he has not been there to-day. He was ill last night, and he is  ill to-day. He sent us his excuses. If he had been in the building, I  doubt whether I would have given the order to burst open the door. I  would simply have requested him to use his key. And he would have done so  and kept his own counsel. I do not know as I can say as much for any of  his subordinates. Happily, no spying eye was about at that time; and  Stevens will be sure to see that he is not watched at his work if he  has to lock the door upon the whole bunch of directors.\"    \"This is to be a secret investigation, then?\"    \"I would so advise.\"    \"With every reporter headed off, and anyone likely to report to a  reporter headed off also?\"    \"Do not _you_ advise this?\"    \"I do. Anything more?\"    \"Not till we hear from Stevens.\"    They had not long to wait. Sooner than they expected the expert mentioned  came in. He held a batch of papers in his hand, which at a gesture from  the Inspector he spread out before them. Then he spoke:    \"One man and one man only has passed down those stairs. But that man has  passed down them twice--once with rubbers on and once without. There are  signs equally plain of his having gone up them, but only once, and at the  time he wore the rubbers. I took every pains possible to preserve and  photograph the prints, but as you see, great confusion was caused by the  second line of steps falling half on and half off the other. All I dare  read there is this: A quick run up and a quick run down by a man in  rubbers, and then a second run down by the same man in shoes. That's the  whole story. These other scraps of paper,\" he went on as he saw the  Inspector's eye travel to some small bits lying on the side, \"are what I  have to show as the result of my search on and about the western pedestal  for finger-prints. A gloved hand drew that bow. See here: this is an  impression I obtained from the inner edge of the pedestal in question.\"    He pulled forward a small square of paper; the sewing of a kid glove was  plainly indicated there.    When Stevens had gone, the Inspector exclaimed meaningly:    \"Gryce! Name your man; we shall get on faster.\"    The aged detective rose.    \"I dare not,\" he said. \"Give me one--two days. I must have time to  think--to collect my evidence. A name once mentioned leaves an echo. When  my echo rings, it must carry no false sound. Remember, I did not sleep  last night. When I present this case to you as I see it, I must be at my  best. I am not at my best to-day.\"    This was doubtless true, but the Inspector had not discovered it.          XII    \"SPARE NOBODY! I SAY, SPARE NOBODY!\"      On his way home Mr. Gryce stopped at the Calderon to inquire how Mrs.  Taylor was doing, and what his prospects were for a limited interview  with her.    He was told that no such interview could be considered for days--that she  still lay in a stupor, with brief flashes of acute consciousness, during  which she would scream \"No! no!\"--that brain fever was feared and that  increased excitement might be fatal.    Another bar to progress! He had hoped to help her memory into supplying  him with a fact which would greatly simplify a task whose anomalies  secretly alarmed him. She had been in a fair state of mind before her  nerve was attacked by the event which robbed the little Angeline of life  and herself of reason, and if carefully approached, might possibly recall  some of the impressions made upon her previous to that moment. If, for  instance, she could describe even in a general way the appearance of any  person she may have seen advancing in the direction of the northern  gallery at the moment she herself turned to enter the southern one, what"]]]
