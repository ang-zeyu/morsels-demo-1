And Allah is well acquainted with what ye do.    P: Such of you as die and leave behind them wives, they (the wives)  shall wait, keeping themselves apart, four months and ten days. And  when they reach the term (prescribed for them) then there is no sin for  you in aught that they may do with themselves in decency. Allah is  informed of what ye do.    S: And (as for) those of you who die and leave wives behind, they should  keep themselves in waiting for four months and ten days; then when they  have fully attained their term, there is no blame on you for what they  do for themselves in a lawful manner; and Allah is aware of what you  do.    002.235  Y: There is no blame on you if ye make an offer of betrothal or hold it  in your hearts. Allah knows that ye cherish them in your hearts: But do  not make a secret contract with them except in terms honourable, nor  resolve on the tie of marriage till the term prescribed is fulfilled.  And know that Allah Knoweth what is in your hearts, and take heed of  Him; and know that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.    P: There is no sin for you in that which ye proclaim or hide in your  minds concerning your troth with women. Allah knoweth that ye will  remember them. But plight not your troth with women except by uttering  a recognised form of words. And do not consummate the marriage until  (the term) prescribed is run. Know that Allah knoweth what is in your  minds, so beware of Him; and know that Allah is Forgiving, Clement.    S: And there is no blame on you respecting that which you speak  indirectly in the asking of (such) women in marriage or keep (the  proposal) concealed within your minds; Allah knows that you will mention  them, but do not give them a promise in secret unless you speak in a  lawful manner, and do not confirm the marriage tie until the writing is  fulfilled, and know that Allah knows what is in your minds, therefore  beware of Him, and know that Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing.    002.236  Y: There is no blame on you if ye divorce women before consummation or  the fixation of their dower; but bestow on them (A suitable gift), the  wealthy according to his means, and the poor according to his means;- A  gift of a reasonable amount is due from those who wish to do the right  thing.    P: It is no sin for you if ye divorce women while yet ye have not  touched them, nor appointed unto them a portion. Provide for them, the  rich according to his means, and the straitened according to his means,  a fair provision. (This is) a bounden duty for those who do good.    S: There is no blame on you if you divorce women when you have not  touched them or appointed for them a portion, and make provision for  them, the wealthy according to his means and the straitened in  circumstances according to his means, a provision according to usage;  (this is) a duty on the doers of good (to others).    002.237  Y: And if ye divorce them before consummation, but after the fixation of  a dower for them, then the half of the dower (Is due to them), unless  they remit it or (the man's half) is remitted by him in whose hands is  the marriage tie; and the remission (of the man's half) is the nearest  to righteousness. And do not forget Liberality between yourselves. For  Allah sees well all that ye do.    P: If ye divorce them before ye have touched them and ye have appointed  unto them a portion, then (pay the) half of that which ye appointed,  unless they (the women) agree to forgo it, or he agreeth to forgo it in  whose hand is the marriage tie. To forgo is nearer to piety. And forget  not kindness among yourselves. Allah is Seer of what ye do.    S: And if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have  appointed for them a portion, then (pay to them) half of what you have  appointed, unless they relinquish or he should relinquish in whose hand  is the marriage tie; and it is nearer to righteousness that you should  relinquish; and do not neglect the giving of free gifts between you;  surely Allah sees what you do.    002.238  Y: Guard strictly your (habit of) prayers, especially the Middle Prayer;  and stand before Allah in a devout (frame of mind).    P: Be guardians of your prayers, and of the midmost prayer, and stand up  with devotion to Allah.    S: Attend constantly to prayers and to the middle prayer and stand up  truly obedient to Allah.    002.239  Y: If ye fear (an enemy), pray on foot, or riding, (as may be most  convenient), but when ye are in security, celebrate Allah's praises in  the manner He has taught you, which ye knew not (before).    P: And if ye go in fear, then (pray) standing or on horseback. And when  ye are again in safety, remember Allah, as He hath taught you that  which (heretofore) ye knew not.    S: But if you are in danger, then (say your prayers) on foot or on  horseback; and when you are secure, then remember Allah, as. He has  taught you what you did not know.    002.240  Y: Those of you who die and leave widows should bequeath for their  widows a year's maintenance and residence; but if they leave (The  residence), there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves,  provided it is reasonable. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.    P: (In the case of) those of you who are about to die and leave behind  them wives, they should bequeath unto their wives a provision for the  year without turning them out, but if they go out (of their own accord)  there is no sin for you in that which they do of themselves within  their rights. Allah is Mighty, Wise.    S: And those of you who die and leave wives behind, (make) a bequest in  favor of their wives of maintenance for a year without turning (them)  out, then if they themselves go away, there is no blame on you for what  they do of lawful deeds by themselves, and Allah is Mighty, Wise.    002.241  Y: For divorced women Maintenance (should be provided) on a reasonable  (scale). This is a duty on the righteous.    P: For divorced women a provision in kindness: a duty for those who ward  off (evil).    S: And for the divorced women (too) provision (must be made) according  to usage; (this is) a duty on those who guard (against evil).    002.242  Y: Thus doth Allah Make clear His Signs to you: In order that ye may  understand.    P: Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations so that ye may  understand.    S: Allah thus makes clear to you His communications that you may  understand.    002.243  Y: Didst thou not Turn by vision to those who abandoned their homes,  though they were thousands (In number), for fear of death? Allah said  to them: \"Die\": Then He restored them to life. For Allah is full of  bounty to mankind, but most of them are ungrateful.    P: Bethink thee (O Muhammad) of those of old, who went forth from their  habitations in their thousands, fearing death, and Allah said unto  them: Die; and then He brought them back to life. Lo! Allah is a Lord  of Kindness to mankind, but most of mankind give not thanks.    S: Have you not considered those who went forth from their homes, for  fear of death, and they were thousands, then Allah said to them, Die;  again He gave them life; most surely Allah is Gracious to people, but  most people are not grateful.    002.244  Y: Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and  knoweth all things.    P: Fight in the way of Allah, and know that Allah is Hearer, Knower.    S: And fight in the way of Allah, and know that Allah is Hearing,  Knowing.    002.245  Y: Who is he that will loan to Allah a beautiful loan, which Allah will  double unto his credit and multiply many times? It is Allah that giveth  (you) Want or plenty, and to Him shall be your return.    P: Who is it that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan, so that He may  give it increase manifold? Allah straiteneth and enlargeth. Unto Him ye  will return.    S: Who is it that will offer of Allah a goodly gift, so He will multiply  it to him manifold, and Allah straitens and amplifies, and you shall be  returned to Him.    002.246  Y: Hast thou not Turned thy vision to the Chiefs of the Children of  Israel after (the time of) Moses? they said to a prophet (That was)  among them: \"Appoint for us a king, that we May fight in the cause of  Allah.\" He said: \"Is it not possible, if ye were commanded to fight,  that that ye will not fight?\" They said: \"How could we refuse to fight  in the cause of Allah, seeing that we were turned out of our homes and  our families?\" but when they were commanded to fight, they turned back,  except a small band among them. But Allah Has full knowledge of those  who do wrong.    P: Bethink thee of the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses,  how they said unto a prophet whom they had: Set up for us a king and we  will fight in Allah's way. He said: Would ye then refrain from fighting  if fighting were prescribed for you? They said: Why should we not fight  in Allah's way when we have been driven from our dwellings with our  children? Yet, when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned away,  all save a few of them. Allah is aware of evil-doers.    S: Have you not considered the chiefs of the children of Israel after  Musa, when they said to a prophet of theirs: Raise up for us a king,  (that) we may fight in the way of Allah. He said: May it not be that  you would not fight if fighting is ordained for you?

[Illustration]          CHAPTER XII    AN OLD FRIEND      About a fortnight after the above catastrophe, and as the recollection of  it was nearly effaced by Miss Jumpheavy's abduction of Ensign Downley, our  friend, Mr. Waffles, on visiting his stud at the four o'clock  stable-hour, found a most respectable, middle-aged, rosy-gilled,  better-sort-of-farmer-looking man, straddling his tight drab-trousered  legs, with a twisted ash plant propping his chin, behind the redoubtable  Hercules. He had a bran-new hat on, a velvet-collared blue coat with metal  buttons, that anywhere but in the searching glare and contrast of London  might have passed for a spic-and-span new one; a small, striped,  step-collared toilanette vest; and the aforesaid drab trousers, in the  right-hand pocket of which his disengaged hand kept fishing up and slipping  down an avalanche of silver, which made a pleasant musical accompaniment to  his monetary conversation. On seeing Mr. Waffles, the stranger touched his  hat, and appeared to be about to retire, when Mr. Figg, the stud-groom,  thus addressed his master:    'This be Mr. Buckram, sir, of London, sir; says he knows our brown 'orse,  sir.'    'Ah, indeed,' observed Mr. Waffles, taking a cigar from his mouth; 'knows  no good of him, I should think. What part of London do you live in, Mr.  Buckram?' asked he.    'Why, I doesn't exactly live in London, my lord--that's to say, sir--a  little way out of it, you know--have a little hindependence of my own, you  understand.'    'Hang it, how should I understand anything of the sort--never set eyes on  you before,' replied Mr. Waffles.    The half-crowns now began to descend singly in the pocket, keeping up a  protracted jingle, like the notes of a lazy, undecided musical snuff-box.  By the time the last had dropped, Mr. Buckram had collected himself  sufficiently to resume.    Taking the ash-plant away from his mouth, with which he had been  barricading his lips, he observed--    'I know'd that oss when Lord Bullfrog had him,' nodding his head at our old  friend as he spoke.    'The deuce you did!' observed Mr. Waffles;' where was that?'    'In Leicestersheer,' replied Mr. Buckram. 'I have a haunt as lives at Mount  Sorrel; she has a little hindependence of her own, and I goes down  'casionally to see her--in fact, I believes I'm her _hare_. Well, I was  down there just at the beginnin' of the season, the 'ounds met at Kirby  Gate--a mile or two to the south, you know, on the Leicester road--it was  the fust day of the season, in fact--and there was a great crowd, and I was  one; and havin' a heye for an oss, I was struck with this one, you  understand, bein' as I thought, a 'ticklar nice 'un. Lord Bullfrog's man  was a ridin' of him, and he kept him outside the crowd, showin' off his  pints, and passin' him backwards and forwards under people's noses, to  'tract the notish of the nobs--parsecutin, what I call--and I see'd Mr.  Sponge struck--I've known Mr. Sponge many years, and a 'ticklar nice gent  he is--well, Mr. Sponge pulled hup, and said to the grum, \"Who's o' that  oss?\" \"My Lor' Bullfrog's, sir,\" said the man. \"He's a deuced nice 'un,\"  observed Mr. Sponge, thinkin', as he was a lord's, he might praise 'im,  seein', in all probability, he weren't for sale. \"He is _that_,\" said the  grum, patting him on the neck, as though he were special fond on him. \"Is  my lord out?\" asked Mr. Sponge. \"No, sir; he's not come down yet,\" replied  the man, \"nor do I know when he will come. He's been down at Bath for some  time 'sociatin' with the aldermen o' Bristol and has thrown up a vast o'  bad flesh--two stun' sin' last season--and he's afeared this oss won't be  able to carry 'im, and so he writ to me to take 'im out to-day, to show  'im.\" \"He'd carry _me_, I think,\" said Mr. Sponge, making hup his mind on  the moment, jist as he makes hup his mind to ride at a fence--not that I  think it's a good plan for a gent to show that he's sweet on an oss, for  they're sure to make him pay for it. Howsomever, that's nouther here nor  there. Well, jist as Mr. Sponge said this, Sir Richard driv' hup, and  havin' got his oss, away we trotted to the goss jist below, and the next  thing I see'd was Mr. Sponge leadin' the 'ole field on this werry nag.  Well, I heard no more till I got to Melton, for I didn't go to my haunt's  at Mount Sorrel that night, and I saw little of the run, for my oss was  rather puffy, livin' principally on chaff, bran mashes, swedes, and soft  food; and when I got to Melton, I heard 'ow Mr. Sponge had bought this  oss,' Mr. Buckram nodding his head at the horse as he spoke, 'and 'ow that  he'd given the matter o' two 'under'd--or I'm not sure it weren't two  'under'd-and-fifty guineas for 'im, and--'    'Well,' interrupted Mr. Waffles, tired of his verbosity, 'and what did they  say about the horse?'    'Why,' continued Mr. Buckram, thoughtfully, propping his chin up with his  stick, and drawing all the half-crowns up to the top of his pocket again,  'the fust 'spicious thing I heard was Sir Digby Snaffle's grum, Sam, sayin'  to Captain Screwley's bat-man grum, jist afore the George Inn door,--    '\"Well, Jack, Tommy's sold the brown oss!\"    '\"N--O--O--R!\" exclaimed Jack, starin' 'is eyes  out, as if it were unpossible.    '\"He '_as_ though,\" said Sam.    '\"Well, then, I 'ope the gemman's fond o' walkin',\" exclaimed Jack, bustin'  out a laughin' and runnin' on.    'This rayther set me a thinkin',' continued Mr. Buckram, dropping a second  half-crown, which jinked against the nest-egg one left at the bottom, 'and  fearin' that Mr. Sponge had fallen 'mong the Philistines--which I was werry  concerned about, for he's a real nice gent, but thoughtless, as many young  gents are who 'ave plenty of tin--I made it my business to inquire 'bout  this oss; and if he _is_ the oss that I saw in Leicestersheer, and I 'ave  little doubt about it (dropping two consecutive half-crowns as he spoke),  though I've not seen him out, I--'    'Ah! well, I bought him of Mr. Sponge, who said he got him from Lord  Bullfrog,' interrupted Mr. Waffles.    'Ah! then he _is_ the oss, in course,' said Mr. Buckram, with a sort of  mournful chuck of the chin; 'he _is_ the oss,' repeated he; 'well, then,  he's a dangerous hanimal,' added he, letting slip three half-crowns.    'What does he do?' asked Mr. Waffles.    'Do!' repeated Mr. Buckram, 'DO! he'll do for anybody.'    'Indeed,' responded Mr. Waffles; adding, 'how could Mr. Sponge sell me such  a brute?'    'I doesn't mean to say, mind ye,' observed Mr. Buckram, drawing back three  half-crowns, as though he had gone that much too far,--'I doesn't mean to  say, mind, that he's wot you call a misteched, runaway,  rear-backwards-over-hanimal--but I mean to say he's a difficultish oss to  ride--himpetuous--and one that, if he got the hupper 'and, would be werry  likely to try and keep the hupper 'and--you understand me?' said he, eyeing  Mr. Waffles intently, and dropping four half-crowns as he spoke.    'I'm tellin' you nothin' but the truth,' observed Mr. Buckram, after a  pause, adding, 'in course it's nothin' to me, only bein' down here on a  visit to a friend, and 'earin' that the oss were 'ere, I made bold to look  in to see whether it was 'im or no. No offence, I 'opes,' added he, letting  go the rest of the silver, and taking the prop from under his chin, with an  obeisance as if he was about to be off.    'Oh, no offence at all,' rejoined Mr. Waffles, 'no offence--rather the  contrary. Indeed, I'm much obliged to you for telling me what you have  done. Just stop half a minute,' added he, thinking he might as well try and  get something more out of him. While Mr. Waffles was considering his next  question, Mr. Buckram saved him the trouble of thinking by 'leading the  gallop' himself.    'I believe 'im to be a _good_ oss, and I believe 'im to be a _bad_ oss,'  observed Mr. Buckram, sententiously. 'I believe that oss, with a bold rider  on his back, and well away with the 'ounds, would beat most osses goin',  but it's the start that's the difficulty with him; for if, on the other  'and, he don't incline to go, all the spurrin', and quiltin', and  leatherin' in the world won't make 'im. It'll be a mercy o' Providence if  he don't cut out work for the crowner some day.'    'Hang the brute!' exclaimed Mr. Waffles, in disgust; 'I've a good mind to  have his throat cut.'    'Nay,' replied Mr. Buckram, brightening up, and stirring the silver round  and round in his pocket like a whirlpool, 'nay,' replied he, 'he's fit for  summat better nor that.'    'Not much, I think,' replied Mr. Waffles, pouting with disgust. He now  stood silent for a few seconds.    'Well, but what did they mean by hoping Mr. Sponge was fond of walking?' at  length asked he.    'Oh, vy,' replied Mr. Buckram, gathering all the money up again, 'I believe  it was this 'ere,' beginning to drop them to half-minute time, and talking  very slowly; 'the oss, I believe, got the better of Lord Bullfrog one day,  somewhere a little on this side of Thrussinton--that, you know, is where  Sir 'Arry built his kennels--between Mount Sorrel and Melton in fact--and  havin' got his Lordship off, who, I should tell you, is an uncommon fat  'un, he wouldn't let him on again, and he 'ad to lead him the matter of I  don't know 'ow many miles'; Mr. Buckram letting go the whole balance of  silver in a rush, as if to denote that it was no joke.    'The brute!' observed Mr. Waffles, in disgust, adding, 'Well, as you seem  to have a pretty good opinion of him, suppose you buy him; I'll let you  have him cheap.'    ''Ord bless you--my lord--that's to say, sir!' exclaimed Buckram, shrugging  up his shoulders, and raising his eyebrows as high as they would go, 'he'd  be of no use to me, none votsomever--shouldn't know what to do with  him--never do for 'arness--besides, I 'ave a werry good machiner as"]]]
