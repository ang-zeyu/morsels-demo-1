Price, by  mail, to any part of the United States, $1.25.      This is another of the large number of practical works and    industrial treatises issued from the press of Mr. Baird. It is    intended as a practical manual for the use of coach painters, and    we must say, upon examination of its contents, that we think it    admirably adapted to meet the wants of that class of artisans    for which it has been prepared. There is perhaps no department of    decorative art in which there is greater room for the display of    skill and taste than in coach painting. This work, however, does    not deal with the subject of art, to any great extent. Its aim    is to give information in regard to colors, varnishes, etc., and    their management in carriage painting in the plainest manner, and    in this way it thoroughly fulfils the intention of the author.      ON THE GENERATION OF SPECIES. By St. George Mivart, F. R. S. London:  MACMILLAN & CO. 1871.      The Darwinian theory of the Origin of Species, has, perhaps,    aroused more attention, excited more dispute, and won more    converts in a shorter time among scientific and unscientific    men, than any other of equal importance promulgated in the 19th    century. It seems to be the rule either to swallow the theory    whole, or reject it as unworthy of belief, and as conflicting with    orthodoxy. The author of the work before us has, however, taken    a middle ground, from which we opine it will be difficult to    dislodge him, though it is within full range of the batteries of    both the contending parties. While he admits the truth of Darwin's    views regarding the operation of natural selection as a cause of    the origin of species, he denies that it is the sole cause, yet    maintains that if it could be demonstrated to be the sole cause,    it would in no manner conflict with orthodox belief in the    Scriptures as the revelation of God to mankind. The perfect candor    of the author is one of the marked features of the discussion,    and his style is a model of pure terse English writing, seldom,    if ever, excelled by any scientific writer. The work is an octavo,    most beautifully printed on tinted paper, and illustrated by many    fine wood engravings.

(#17)"],[1,"knowledge of a  particular class of facts, and of their relations, namely, the facts of  nature or of the external world. This usage is not universal, nor is it  fixed. In Germany, especially, the word _Wissenschaft_ is used of all  kinds of ordered knowledge, whether transcendental or empirical. So we  are accustomed to speak of mental, moral, social, as well as of natural  science. Nevertheless, the more restricted use of the word is very  common and very influential. It is important that this fact should be  recognized. In common usage, a scientific man is distinguished specially  from a metaphysician. The one investigates the phenomena of matter, the  other studies the phenomena of mind, according to the old distinction  between physics and metaphysics. Science, therefore, is the ordered  knowledge of the phenomena which we recognize through the senses. A  scientific fact is a fact perceived by the senses. Scientific evidence  is evidence addressed to the senses. At one of the meetings of the  Victoria Institute, a visitor avowed his disbelief in the existence of  God. When asked, what kind of evidence would satisfy him? he answered,  Just such evidence as I have of the existence of this tumbler which I  now hold in my hand. The Rev. Mr. Henslow says, \"By science is meant the  investigation of facts and phenomena recognizable by the senses, and of  the causes which have brought them into existence.\"[40] This is the main  root of the trouble. If science be the knowledge of the facts perceived  by the senses, and scientific evidence, evidence addressed to the  senses, then the senses are the only sources of knowledge. Any  conviction resting on any other ground than the testimony of the senses,  must be faith. Darwin admits that the contrivances in nature may be  accounted for by assuming that they are due to design on the part of  God. But, he says, that would not be science. Haeckel says that to  science matter is eternal. If any man chooses to say, it was created,  well and good; but that is a matter of faith, and faith is imagination.  Ulrici quotes a distinguished German physiologist who believes in  vital, as distinguished from physical forces; but he holds to  spontaneous generation, not, as he admits, because it has been proved,  but because the admission of any higher power than nature is  unscientific.[41]    It is inevitable that minds addicted to scientific investigation should  receive a strong bias to undervalue any other kind of evidence except  that of the senses, _i. e._, scientific evidence. We have seen that  those who give themselves up to this tendency come to deny God, to deny  mind, to deny even self. It is true that the great majority of men,  scientific as well as others, are so much under the control of the laws  of their nature, that they cannot go to this extreme. The tendency,  however, of a mind addicted to the consideration of one kind of  evidence, to become more or less insensible to other kinds of proof, is  undeniable. Thus even Agassiz, as a zooelogist and simply on zooelogical  grounds, assumed that there were several zones between the Ganges and  the Atlantic Ocean, each having its own flora and fauna, and inhabited  by races of men, the same in kind, but of different origins. When told  by the comparative philologists that this was impossible, because the  languages spoken through that wide region, demonstrated that its  inhabitants must have had a common descent, he could only answer that as  ducks quack everywhere, he could not see why men should not everywhere  speak the same language.    A still more striking illustration is furnished by Dr. Lionel Beale, the  distinguished English physiologist. He has written a book of three  hundred and eighty-eight pages for the express purpose of proving that  the phenomena of life, instinct, and intellect cannot be referred to any  known natural forces. He avows his belief that in nature \"mind governs  matter,\" and \"in the existence of a never-changing, all-seeing,  power-directing and matter-guiding Omnipotence.\" He avows his faith in  miracles, and \"those miracles on which Christianity is founded.\"  Nevertheless, his faith in all these points is provisional. He says that  a truly scientific man, \"if the maintenance, continuity, and nature of  life on our planet should at some future time be fully explained without  supposing the existence of any such supernatural omnipotent influence,  would be bound to receive the new explanation, and might abandon the  old conviction.\"[42] That is, all evidence of the truths of religion not  founded on nature and perceived by the senses, amounts to nothing.    Now as religion does not rest on the testimony of the senses, that is on  scientific evidence, the tendency of scientific men is to ignore its  claims. We speak only of tendency. We rejoice to know or believe that in  hundreds or thousands of scientific men, this tendency is counteracted  by their consciousness of manhood--the conviction that the body is not  the man,--by the intuitions of the reason and the conscience, and by the  grace of God. No class of men stands deservedly higher in public  estimation than men of science, who, while remaining faithful to their  higher nature, have enlarged our knowledge of the wonderful works of  God.    A second cause of the alienation between science and religion, is the  failure to make the due distinction between facts and the explanation of  those facts, or the theories deduced from them. No sound minded man  disputes any scientific fact. Religious men believe with Agassiz that  facts are sacred. They are revelations from God. Christians sacrifice to  them, when duly authenticated, their most cherished convictions. That  the earth moves, no religious man doubts. When Galileo made that great  discovery, the Church was right in not yielding at once to the evidence  of an experiment which it did not understand. But when the fact was  clearly established, no man sets up his interpretation of the Bible in  opposition to it. Religious men admit all the facts connected with our  solar system; all the facts of geology, and of comparative anatomy, and  of biology. Ought not this to satisfy scientific men? Must we also admit  their explanations and inferences? If we admit that the human embryo  passes through various phases, must we admit that man was once a fish,  then a bird, then a dog, then an ape, and finally what he now is? If we  admit the similarity of structure in all vertebrates, must we admit the  evolution of one from another, and all from a primordial germ? It is to  be remembered that the facts are from God, the explanation from men; and  the two are often as far apart as Heaven and its antipode.    These human explanations are not only without authority, but they are  very mutable. They change not only from generation to generation, but  almost as often as the phases of the moon. It is a fact that the planets  move. Once it was said that they were moved by spirits, then by  vortexes, now by self-evolved forces. It is hard that we should be  called upon to change our faith with every new moon. The same man  sometimes propounds theories almost as rapidly as the changes of the  kaleidoscope. The amiable Sir Charles Lyell, England's most  distinguished geologist, has published ten editions of his \"Principles  of Geology,\" which so differ as to make it hard to believe that it is  the work of the same mind. \"In all the editions up to the tenth, he  looked upon geological facts and geological phenomena as proving the  fixity of species and their special creation in time. In the tenth  edition, just published, he announces his change of opinion on this  subject and his conversion to the doctrine of development by law.\"[43]  \"In the eighth edition of his work,\" says Dr. Bree, \"Sir Charles Lyell,  the Nestor of geologists, to whom the present generation is more  indebted than to any other for all that is known of geology in its  advanced stage, teaches that species have a real existence in nature,  and that each was endowed at the time of its creation with the  attributes and organization by which it is now distinguished.\" The  change on the part of this eminent geologist, it is to be observed, is a  mere change of opinion. There was no change of the facts of geology  between the publication of the eighth and of the tenth edition of his  work, neither was there any change in his knowledge of those facts. All  the facts relied upon by evolutionists, have long been familiar to  scientific men. The whole change is a subjective one. One year the  veteran geologist thinks the facts teach one thing, another year he  thinks they teach another. It is now the fact, and it is feared it will  continue to be a fact, that scientific men give the name of science to  their explanations as well as to the facts. Nay, they are often, and  naturally, more zealous for their explanations than they are for the  facts. The facts are God's, the explanations are their own.    The third cause of the alienation between religion and science, is the  bearing of scientific men towards the men of culture who do not belong  to their own class. When we, in such connections, speak of scientific  men, we do not mean men of science as such, but those only who avow or  manifest their hostility to religion. There is an assumption of  superiority, and often a manifestation of contempt. Those who call their  logic or their conjectures into question, are stigmatized as  narrow-minded, bigots, old women, Bible worshippers, etc.    Professor Huxley's advice to metaphysicians and theologians is, to let  science alone. This is his Irenicum. But do he and his associates let  metaphysics and religion alone? They tell the metaphysician that his  vocation is gone; there is no such thing as mind, and of course no  mental laws to be established. Metaphysics are merged into physics.  Professor Huxley tells the religious world that there is"]]]
