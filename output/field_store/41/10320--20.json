But it was Dick Swann who poured the drink out of the  flask. Between you and me, Lane, that young millionaire is going a  pace hereabouts. Listen,\" he went on, lowering his voice, and glancing  round to see there was no one to overhear him, \"there's a gambling  club in Middleville. I go there. My rooms are in the same building.  I've made a peep-hole through the attic floor next to my room. Do I  see more things than cards and bottles? Do I! If the fathers of  Middleville could see what I've seen they'd go out to the asylum....  I'm not supposed to know it's more than a place to gamble. And nobody  knows I know. Dick Swann and Hardy Mackay are at the head of this  club. Swann is the genius and the support of it. He's rich, and a high  roller if I ever saw one.... Among themselves these young gentlemen  call it the Strong Arm Club. Study over that, Lane. Do you _get_ it? I  know you do, and that saves me talking until I see red.\"    \"Pepper, have you seen my sister--there?\" queried Lane, tensely.    \"Yes.\"    \"With whom?\"    \"I'll not say, Lane. There's no need for that. I'll give you a key to  my rooms, and you can go there--in the afternoons--and paste yourself  to my peep-hole, and watch.... Honest to God, I believe it means  bloodshed. But I can't help that. Something must be done. I'm not  much good, but I can see that.\"    Colonel Pepper wiped his moist face. He was now quite pale and his  hands shook.    \"I never had a wife, or a sweetheart,\" he went on. \"But once I had a  little sister. Thank Heaven she didn't live her girlhood in times like  these.\"    Lane again bowed his head on his hands, and wrestled with the might of  reality.    \"I'm going to take you to these club-rooms to-night,\" went on Pepper.  \"It'll cause a hell of a row. But once you get in, there'll be no help  for them. Swann and his chums will have to stand for it.\"    \"Did you ever take an outsider in?\" asked Lane.    \"Several times. Traveling men I met here. Good fellows that liked a  game of cards. Swann made no kick at that. He's keen to gamble. And  when he's drinking the sky's the limit.\"    \"Wouldn't it be wiser just to show me these rooms, and let me watch  from your place--until I find my sister there?\" queried Lane.    \"I don't know,\" replied Pepper, thoughtfully. \"I think if I were you  I'd butt in to-night with me. You can drag young Dalrymple home before  he gets drunk.\"    \"Pepper, I'll break up this--this club,\" declared Lane.    \"I'll say you will. And I'm for you strong. If it was only the booze  and cards I'd not have squealed. That's my living. But by God, I can't  stand for the--the other stuff any longer!... Come on now. And I'll  put you on to a slick stunt that'll take your breath away.\"    He led the way out of the hotel, in his excitement walking rather  fast.    \"Go slow, Pepper,\" said Lane. \"We're not going over the top.\"    Pepper gave him a quick, comprehending look.    \"Good Lord, Lane, you're not as--as bad as all that!\"    Lane nodded. Then at slower pace they went out and down the bright  Main Street for two blocks, and then to the right on West Street,  which was quite comparable to the other thoroughfare as a business  district. At the end of the street the buildings were the oldest in  Middleville, and entirely familiar to Lane.    \"Give White's the once over,\" said Pepper, indicating a brightly  lighted store across the street. \"That place is new to you, isn't it?\"    \"Yes, I don't remember White, or that there was a confectionery den  along here.\"    \"Den is right. It's some den, believe me.... White's a newcomer--a  young sport, thick with Swann. For all I know Swann is backing him.  Anyway he has a swell joint and a good trade. People kick about his  high prices. Ice cream, candy, soda, soft drinks, and all that rot.  But if he knows who you are you can get a shot. It'll strike you funny  later to see he waits on the customers himself. But when you get wise  it'll not be so funny. He's got a tea parlor upstairs--and they say  it's some swell place, with a rest room or ladies' dressing room back.  Now from this back room the girls can get into the club-rooms of the  boys, and go out on the other side of the block. In one way and out  the other--at night. Not necessary in the afternoon.... Come on now,  well go round the block.\"    A short walk round the block brought them into a shaded, wide street  with one of Middleville's parks on the left. A row of luxuriant elm  trees helped the effect of gloom. The nearest electric light was  across on the far corner, with trees obscuring it to some extent. At  the corner where Pepper halted there was an outside stairway running  up the old-fashioned building. The ground floor shops bore the signs  of a florist and a milliner; above was a photograph gallery; and the  two upper stories were apparently unoccupied. To the left of the two  stores another stairway led up into the center of the building. Pepper  led Lane up this stairway, a long, dark climb of three stories that  taxed Lane's endurance.    \"Sure is a junk heap, this old block,\" observed Pepper, as he fumbled  in the dim light with his keys. At length he opened a door, turned on  a light and led Lane into his apartment. \"I have three rooms here, and  the back one opens into a kind of areaway from which I get into an  abandoned storeroom, or I guess it's an attic. To-morrow afternoon  about three you meet me here and I'll take you in there and let you  have a look through the peep-hole I made. It's no use to-night,  because there'll be only boys at the club, and I'm going to take you  right in.\"    He switched off the light, drew Lane out and locked the door. \"I'm the  only person who lives on this floor. There're three holes to this  burrow and one of them is at the end of this hall. The exit where the  girls slip out is on the floor below, through a hallway to that  outside stairs. Oh, I'll say it's a Coney Island maze, this building!  But just what these young rakes want.... Come on, and be careful.  It'll be dark and the stairs are steep.\"    At the end of the short hall Pepper opened a door, and led Lane down  steep steps in thick darkness, to another hall, dimly lighted by a  window opening upon the street.    \"You'll have to make a bluff at playing poker, unless my butting in  with you causes a row,\" said Pepper, as he walked along. Presently he  came to a door upon which he knocked several times. But before it was  opened footsteps and voices sounded down the hall in the opposite  direction from which Pepper had escorted Lane.    \"Guess they're just coming. Hard luck,\" said Pepper. \"'Fraid you'll  not get in now.\"    Lane counted five dark forms against the background of dim light. He  saw the red glow of a cigarette. Then the door upon which Pepper had  knocked opened to let out a flare. Pepper gave Lane a shove across the  threshold and followed him. Lane did not recognize the young man who  had opened the door. The room was large, with old walls and high  ceiling, a round table with chairs and a sideboard. It had no windows.  The door on the other side was closed.    \"Pepper, who's this you're ringin' in on me?\" demanded the young  fellow.    \"A pard of mine. Now don't be peeved, Sammy,\" replied Pepper. \"If  there's any kick I'll take the blame.\"    Then the five young men glided swiftly into the room. The last one was  Dick Swann. In the act of closing the door behind him, he saw Lane, and  started violently back. His face turned white. His action, his look  silenced the talk.    \"Lane! What do you want?\" he jerked out.    Lane eyed him without replying. He thought he read more in Swann's face  and voice than any of the amazed onlookers.    \"Dick, I fetched Lane up for a little game,\" put in Pepper, with  composure.    Swann jerked as violently out of his stiffened posture as he had frozen  into it. His face changed--showed comprehension--relief--then flamed  with anger.    \"Pepper, it's a damn high-handed imposition for you to bring strangers  here,\" he burst out.    \"Well, I'm sorry you take it that way,\" replied Pepper, with deprecatory  spreading of his hands. He was quite cool and his little eyes held a  singular gleam. \"You never kicked before when I brought a stranger.\"    Swann fiercely threw down his cigarette.    \"Hell! I told you never to bring any Middleville man in here.\"    \"Ahuh! I forgot. You'll have to excuse me,\" returned Pepper, not with  any particular regret.    \"What's the matter with my money?\" queried Lane, ironically, at last  removing his steady gaze from Swann to the others. Mackay was there, and  Holt Dalrymple, the boy in whom Lane had lately interested himself. Holt  resembled his sister in his dark rich coloring, but his face wore a  shade of sullen depression. The other two young men Lane had seen in  Middleville, but they were unknown to him.    \"Pepper, you beat it with your new pard,\" snarled Swarm. \"And you'll not  get in here again, take that from me.\"    The mandate nettled Pepper, who evidently felt more deeply over this  situation than had appeared on the surface.    \"Sure, I'll beat it,\" returned he, resentfully. \"But see here, Swann. Be  careful how you shoot off your dirty mouth. It's not beyond me to hand a  little tip to my friend Chief of Police Bell.\"    \"You damned squealer!\" shouted Swann. \"Go ahead--do your worst. You'll  find I pull a stroke.... Now get out of here.\"    With a violent action he shoved the little man out into the hall. Then  turning to Lane he pointed with shaking hand to the door.    \"Lane, you couldn't be a guest of mine.\"    \"Swann, I certainly wouldn't be,\" retorted Lane, in tones that rang.  \"Pepper didn't tell me you were the proprietor of this--this joint.\"    \"Get out of here or I'll throw you out!\" yelled Swann, now beside  himself with rage. And he made a threatening "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15675"],[0,"A Voyage to New Holland, Etc. in the Year 1699 (#17)"],[1,"in latitude 25 degrees 30 minutes,  and in the afternoon our cook died, an old man, who had been sick a great  while, being infirm before we came out of England.    The 6th of August in the morning we saw an opening in the land and we ran  into it, and anchored in 7 and a half fathom water, 2 miles from the  shore, clean sand. It was somewhat difficult getting in here, by reason  of many shoals we met with: but I sent my boat sounding before me. The  mouth of this sound, which I called Shark's Bay, lies in about 25 degrees  south latitude, and our reckoning made its longitude from the Cape of  Good Hope to be about 87 degrees; which is less by 195 leagues than is  usually laid down in our common charts, if our reckoning was right and  our glasses did not deceive us. As soon as I came to anchor in this bay  (of which I have given a plan) I sent my boat ashore to seek for fresh  water: but in the evening my men returned, having found none. The next  morning I went ashore myself, carrying pickaxes and shovels with me, to  dig for water: and axes to cut wood. We tried in several places for water  but, finding none after several trials, nor in several miles compass, we  left any farther search for it and, spending the rest of the day in  cutting wood, we went aboard at night.    OF THE LAND THERE, VEGETABLES, BIRDS, ETC.    The land is of an indifferent height, so that it may be seen 9 or 10  leagues off. It appears at a distance very even; but as you come nigher  you find there are many gentle risings, though none steep nor high. It is  all a steep shore against the open sea: but in this bay or sound we were  now in the land is low by the seaside, rising gradually in within the  land. The mould is sand by the seaside, producing a large sort of  samphire, which bears a white flower. Farther in the mould is reddish, a  sort of sand producing some grass, plants, and shrubs. The grass grows in  great tufts as big as a bushel, here and there a tuft: being intermixed  with much heath, much of the kind we have growing on our commons in  England. Of trees or shrubs here are divers sorts; but none above 10 foot  high: their bodies about 3 foot about, and 5 or 6 foot high before you  come to the branches, which are bushy and composed of small twigs there  spreading abroad, though thick set, and full of leaves; which were mostly  long and narrow. The colour of the leaves was on one side whitish, and on  the other green; and the bark of the trees was generally of the same  colour with the leaves, of a pale green. Some of these trees were  sweet-scented, and reddish within the bark, like the sassafras, but  redder. Most of the trees and shrubs had at this time either blossoms or  berries on them. The blossoms of the different sort of trees were of  several colours, as red, white, yellow, etc., but mostly blue: and these  generally smelt very sweet and fragrant, as did some also of the rest.  There were also beside some plants, herbs, and tall flowers, some very  small flowers, growing on the ground, that were sweet and beautiful, and  for the most part unlike any I had seen elsewhere.    A PARTICULAR SORT OF IGUANA: FISH, AND BEAUTIFUL SHELLS; TURTLE, LARGE  SHARK, AND WATER-SERPENTS.    There were but few land-fowls; we saw none but eagles of the larger sorts  of birds; but 5 or 6 sorts of small birds. The biggest sort of these were  not bigger than larks; some no bigger than wrens, all singing with great  variety of fine shrill notes; and we saw some of their nests with young  ones in them. The water-fowls are ducks (which had young ones now, this  being the beginning of the spring in these parts) curlews, galdens,  crab-catchers, cormorants, gulls, pelicans; and some waterfowl, such as I  have not seen anywhere besides. I have given the pictures of 4 several  birds on this coast.    The land animals that we saw here were only a sort of raccoon, different  from those of the West Indies, chiefly as to their legs; for these have  very short forelegs; but go jumping upon them as the others do (and like  them are very good meat) and a sort of iguana, of the same shape and size  with other iguanas described, but differing from them in 3 remarkable  particulars: for these had a larger and uglier head, and had no tail: and  at the rump, instead of the tail there, they had a stump of a tail which  appeared like another head; but not really such, being without mouth or  eyes: yet this creature seemed by this means to have a head at each end;  and, which may be reckoned a fourth difference, the legs also seemed all  4 of them to be forelegs, being all alike in shape and length, and  seeming by the joints and bending to be made as if they were to go  indifferently either head or tail foremost. They were speckled black and  yellow like toads, and had scales or knobs on their backs like those of  crocodiles, plated onto the skin, or stuck into it, as part of the skin.  They are very slow in motion; and when a man comes nigh them they will  stand still and hiss, not endeavouring to get away. Their livers are also  spotted black and yellow: and the body when opened has a very unsavoury  smell. I did never see such ugly creatures anywhere but here. The iguanas  I have observed to be very good meat: and I have often eaten of them with  pleasure; but though I have eaten of snakes, crocodiles and alligators,  and many creatures that look frightfully enough, and there are but few I  should have been afraid to eat of if pressed by hunger, yet I think my  stomach would scarce have served to venture upon these New Holland  iguanas, both the looks and the smell of them being so offensive.    The sea-fish that we saw here (for here was no river, land, or pond of  fresh water to be seen) are chiefly sharks. There are abundance of them  in this particular sound, and I therefore give it the name of Shark's  Bay. Here are also skates, thornbacks, and other fish of the ray kind  (one sort especially like the sea-devil) and garfish, bonetas, etc. Of  shellfish we got here mussels, periwinkles, limpets, oysters, both of the  pearl kind and also eating-oysters, as well the common sort as long  oysters; beside cockles, etc., the shore was lined thick with many other  sorts of very strange and beautiful shells, for variety of colour and  shape, most finely spotted with red, black, or yellow, etc., such as I  have not seen anywhere but at this place. I brought away a great many of  them; but lost all except a very few, and those not of the best.    There are also some green-turtle weighing about 200 pounds. Of these we  caught 2 which the water ebbing had left behind a ledge of rock, which  they could not creep over. These served all my company 2 days; and they  were indifferent sweet meat. Of the sharks we caught a great many which  our men eat very savourily. Among them we caught one which was 11 foot  long. The space between its two eyes was 20 inches, and 18 inches from  one corner of his mouth to the other. Its maw was like a leather sack,  very thick, and so tough that a sharp knife could scarce cut it: in which  we found the head and bones of a hippopotamus; the hairy lips of which  were still sound and not putrefied, and the jaw was also firm, out of  which we plucked a great many teeth, 2 of them 8 inches long and as big  as a man's thumb, small at one end, and a little crooked; the rest not  above half so long. The maw was full of jelly which stank extremely:  however I saved for a while the teeth and the shark's jaw: the flesh of  it was divided among my men; and they took care that no waste should be  made of it.    It was the 7th of August when we came into Shark's Bay; in which we  anchored at three several places, and stayed at the first of them (on the  west side of the bay) till the 11th. During which time we searched about,  as I said, for fresh water, digging wells, but to no purpose. However we  cut good store of firewood at this first anchoring-place; and my company  were all here very well refreshed with raccoons, turtle, shark, and other  fish, and some fowls; so that we were now all much brisker than when we  came in hither. Yet still I was for standing farther into the bay, partly  because I had a mind to increase my stock of fresh water, which was began  to be low; and partly for the sake of discovering this part of the coast.  I was invited to go further by seeing from this anchoring-place all open  before me; which therefore I designed to search before I left the bay. So  on the 11th about noon I steered farther in, with an easy sail because we  had but shallow water: we kept therefore good looking-out for fear of  shoals; sometimes shortening, sometimes deepening the water. About 2 in  the afternoon we saw the land ahead that makes the south of the bay, and  before night we had again shoalings from that shore: and therefore  shortened sail and stood off and on all night under, 2 topsails,  continually sounding, having never more than 10 fathom, and seldom less  than 7. The water deepened and shoaled so very gently that in heaving the  lead 5 or 6 times we should scarce have a foot difference. When we came  into 7 fathom either way we presently went about. From this south part of  the bay we could not see the land from whence we came in the afternoon:  and this land we found to be an island of 3 or 4 leagues long, as is seen  in the plan, but it appearing barren I did not strive to go nearer it;  and the rather because the winds would not permit us to do it without  much trouble, and at the openings the water was generally shoal. I  therefore made no farther attempts in this south-west and south part of  the bay, but steered away to eastward to see if there was any land that  way, for as yet we had seen none there. On the 12th in the morning we  passed by the north point of that land and were confirmed in the  persuasion of its being an island by seeing an opening to the east of it,  as we had done on the west.
