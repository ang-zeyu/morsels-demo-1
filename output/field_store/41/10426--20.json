Was not the constant  importunity of his letters, and his continual solicitations sufficient?  Why did he come again to persecute him with his presence? What need had  he of him?\" But Duroc insisted; he reminded Napoleon of the want that he  would experience of Prussia, in a war with Russia; and the doors of the  emperor were opened to the monarch. He was received with the respect due  to his superior rank. His renewed assurances of fidelity, of which he  gave numerous proofs, were accepted.    It was reported at that time, that this monarch was led to expect the  possession of the Russo-German provinces, which his troops were to be  commissioned to invade. It is even affirmed that, after their conquest,  he demanded their investiture from Napoleon. It has been added, but in  vague terms, that Napoleon allowed the Prince-Royal of Prussia to aspire  to the hand of one of his nieces. This was to be the remuneration for  the services which Prussia was to render him in this new war. He  promised, so he expressed himself, that he would go and sound her. It  was thus that Frederick, by becoming the relation of Napoleon, would be  enabled to preserve his diminished power; but proofs are wanting, to  show that the idea of this marriage seduced the King of Prussia, as the  hope of a similar alliance had seduced the Prince of Spain.    Such at that time was the submission of sovereigns to the power of  Napoleon. It offers a striking example of the empire of necessity over  all persons, and shows to what lengths the prospect of gain and the fear  of loss will lead princes as well as private persons.    Meanwhile, Napoleon still waited the result of the negotiations of  Lauriston and of Narbonne. He hoped to vanquish Alexander by the mere  aspect of his united army, and, above all, by the menacing splendour of  his residence at Dresden. He himself expressed this opinion, when, some  days after, at Posen, he said to General Dessolles, \"The assemblage at  Dresden not having persuaded Alexander to make peace, it was now solely  to be expected from war.\"    On that day he talked of nothing but his former victories. It seemed as  if, doubtful of the future, he recurred to the past, and that he found  it necessary to arm himself with all his most glorious recollections, in  order to confront a peril of so great a magnitude. In fact, then, as  since, he felt the necessity of deluding himself with the alleged  weakness of his rival's character. As the period of so great an invasion  approached, he hesitated in considering it as certain; for he no longer  possessed the consciousness of his infallibility, nor that warlike  assurance which the fire and energy of youth impart, nor that feeling of  success which makes it certain.    In other respects, these parleys were not only attempts to preserve  peace, but an additional _ruse de guerre_. By them he hoped to render  the Russians either sufficiently negligent, to let themselves be  surprised, dispersed, or, if united, sufficiently presumptuous to  venture to wait his approach. In either case, the war would be finished  by a _coup-de-main_, or by a victory. But Lauriston was not received.  Narbonne, when he returned, stated, \"that he had found the Russians in a  state of mind as remote from dejection as from boasting. From their  emperor's reply to him, it appeared that they preferred war to a  dishonourable peace; that they would take care not to expose themselves  to the hazards of a battle against too formidable an enemy; and that, in  short, they were resolved on making every sacrifice, in order to spin  out the war, and to baffle Napoleon.\"    This answer, which reached the emperor in the midst of the greatest  display of his glory, was treated with contempt. To say the truth, I  must add, that a great Russian nobleman had contributed to deceive him:  either from mistaken views, or from artifice, this Muscovite had  persuaded him, that his own sovereign would recede at the sight of  difficulties, and be easily discouraged by reverses. Unfortunately, the  remembrance of Alexander's obsequiousness to him at Tilsit and at Erfurt  confirmed the French emperor in that fallacious opinion.    He remained till the 29th of May at Dresden, proud of the homage which  he knew how to appreciate, exhibiting to Europe princes and kings,  sprung from the most ancient families of Germany, forming a numerous  court round a prince deriving all distinction from himself. He appeared  to take a pleasure in multiplying the chances of the great game of  fortune, as if to encircle with them, and render less extraordinary,  that which placed him on the throne, and thus to accustom others as well  as himself to them.          CHAP. II.      At length, impatient to conquer the Russians, and escape from the homage  of the Germans, Napoleon quitted Dresden. He only remained at Posen long  enough to satisfy the Poles. He neglected Warsaw, whither the war did  not imperiously call him, and where he would have again been involved in  politics. He stopped at Thorn, in order to inspect his fortifications,  his magazines, and his troops. There the complaints of the Poles, whom  our allies pillaged without mercy, and insulted, reached him. Napoleon  addressed severe reproaches, and even threats, to the King of  Westphalia: but it is well known that these were thrown away; that their  effect was lost in the midst of too rapid a movement; that, besides, his  fits of anger, like all other fits, were followed by exhaustion; that  then, with the return of his natural good humour, he regretted, and  frequently tried, to soften the pain he had occasioned; that, finally,  he might reproach himself as the cause of the disorders which provoked  him; for, from the Oder to the Vistula, and even to the Niemen, if  provisions were abundant and properly stationed, the less portable  foraging supplies were deficient. Our cavalry were already forced to cut  the green rye, and to strip the houses of their thatch, in order to feed  their horses. It is true, that all did not stop at that; but when one  disorder is authorized, how can others be forbidden?    The evil augmented on the other side of the Niemen. The emperor had  calculated upon a multitude of light cars and heavy waggons, each  destined to carry several thousand pounds weight, through a sandy  region, which carts, with no greater weight than some quintals, with  difficulty traversed. These conveyances were organized in battalions and  squadrons. Each battalion of light cars, called _comtoises_, consisted  of six hundred, and might carry six thousand quintals of flour. The  battalion of heavy vehicles, drawn by oxen, carried four thousand eight  hundred quintals. There were besides twenty-six squadrons of waggons,  loaded with military equipages; a great quantity of waggons with tools  of all kinds, as well as thousands of artillery and hospital waggons,  one siege and six bridge equipages.    The provision-waggons were to take in their loading at the magazines  established on the Vistula. When the army passed that river, it was  ordered to provide itself, without halting, with provisions for  twenty-five days, but not to use them till they were beyond the Niemen.  In conclusion, the greater part of these means of transport failed,  either because the organization of soldiers, to act as conductors of  military convoys, was essentially vicious, the motives of honour and  ambition not being called into action to maintain proper discipline; or  chiefly because these vehicles were too heavy for the soil, the  distances too considerable, and the privations and fatigues too great;  certain it is that the greater number of them scarcely reached the  Vistula.    The army, therefore, provisioned itself on its match. The country being  fertile, waggons, cattle, and provisions of all kinds, were swept off;  every thing was taken, even to such of the inhabitants as were necessary  to conduct these convoys. Some days after, at the Niemen, the  embarrassment of the passage, and the celerity of the first hostile  marches, caused all the fruits of these requisitions to be abandoned  with an indifference only equalled by the violence with which they had  been seized.    The importance of the object, however, was such as might excuse the  irregularity of these proceedings. That object was to surprise the  Russian army, either collected or dispersed; in short, to make a  _coup-de-main_ with 400,000 men. War, the worst of all scourges, would  thus have been shortened in its duration. Our long and heavy  baggage-waggons would have encumbered our march. It was much more  convenient to live on the supplies of the country, as we should be able  to indemnify the loss afterwards. But superfluous wrong was committed as  well as necessary wrong, for who can stop midway in the commission of  evil? What chief could be responsible for the crowd of officers and  soldiers who were scattered through the country in order to collect its  resources? To whom were complaints to be addressed? Who was to punish?  All was done in the course of a rapid march; there was neither time to  try, nor even to find out the guilty. Between the affair of the day  before, and that of the following day, how many others had sprung up!  for at that time the business of a month was crowded into a single day.    Moreover, some of the leaders set the example; there was a positive  emulation in evil. In that respect, many of our allies surpassed the  French. We were their teachers in every thing; but in copying our  qualities, they caricatured our defects. Their gross and brutal plunder  was perfectly revolting.    But the emperor was desirous to have order kept in the middle of  disorder. Pressed by the accusing reproaches of two allied nations, two  names were more especially distinguished by his indignation. In his  letters "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18127"],[0,"The Beginner's American History (#17)"],[1,"did not hit  him. Then Washington and Gist managed to get away from him, and set  out to go back to Virginia by themselves. There were no paths through  the thick forest; but Washington had his compass with him, and with  that he could find his way just as the captain of a ship finds his  at sea. When they reached the Alleghany River they found it full of  floating ice. They worked all day and made a raft of logs. As they  were pushing their way across with poles, Washington's pole was  struck by a big piece of ice which he says jerked him out into water  ten feet deep. At length the two men managed to get to a little island,  but as there was no wood on it, they could not make a fire. The weather  was bitterly cold, and Washington, who was soaked to the skin, had  to take his choice between walking about all night, or trying to sleep  on the frozen ground in his wet clothes.    [Illustration: WASHINGTON AND GIST ON THE RAFT.]      130. Major Washington becomes Colonel Washington; Fort Necessity;  Braddock's defeat.--When Major Washington got back to Virginia, the  governor made him colonel. With a hundred and fifty men, Colonel  Washington was ordered to set out for the west. He was to \"make  prisoners, kill or destroy,\" all Frenchmen who should try to get  possession of land on the Ohio River. He built a small log fort, which  he named Fort Necessity.[11] Here the French attacked him. They had  five men to his one. Colonel Washington fought like a man who liked  to hear the bullets whistle past his ears,--as he said he did,--but  in the end he had to give up the fort.    Then General Braddock, a noted English soldier, was sent over to  Virginia by the king to drive the French out of the country. He  started with a fine army, and Washington went with him.[12] He told  General Braddock that the French and the Indians would hide in the  woods and fire at his men from behind trees. But Braddock paid no  attention to the warning. On his way through the forest, the brave  English general was suddenly struck down by the enemy, half of his  army were killed or wounded, and the rest put to flight. Washington  had two horses shot under him, and four bullets went through his coat.  It was a narrow escape for the young man. One of those who fought  in the battle said, \"I expected every moment to see him fall\"--but  he was to live for greater work.    [Illustration: FALL OF GENERAL BRADDOCK ON THE BATTLE-FIELD.]    [Footnote 11: Fort Necessity: see map in paragraph 127.]    [Footnote 12: See map of Braddock's march in paragraph 127.]      131. End of the war with the French; what the king of England wanted  to do; how the people here felt toward him.--The war with the French  lasted a number of years. It ended by the English getting possession  of the whole of America from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi  River. All this part of America was ruled by George the Third, king  of England. The king now determined to send over more soldiers, and  keep them here to prevent the French in Canada from trying to get  back the country they had lost. He wanted the people here in the  thirteen colonies[13] to pay the cost of keeping these soldiers. But  this the people were not willing to do, because they felt that they  were able to protect themselves without help of any kind. Then the  king said, If the Americans will not give the money, I will take it  from them by force,--for pay it they must and shall. This was more  than the king would have dared say about England; for there, if he  wanted money to spend on his army, he had to ask the people for it,  and they could give it or not as they thought best. The Americans  said, We have the same rights as our brothers in England, and the  king cannot force us to give a single copper against our will. If  he tries to take it from us, we will fight. Some of the greatest men  in England agreed with us, and said that they would fight, too, if  they were in our place.    [Footnote 13: Thirteen colonies: see footnote 4 at the end of  paragraph 102.]      132. The king determines to have the money; the tea-ships, and the  \"Boston tea-party.\"--But George the Third did not know the Americans,  and he did not think that they meant what they said. He tried to make  them pay the money, but they would not. From Maine to Georgia, all  the people were of one mind. Then the king thought that he would try  a different way. Shiploads of tea were sent over to New York, Boston,  Philadelphia, and Charleston, If the tea should be landed and sold,  then every man who bought a pound of it would have to pay six cents  more than the regular price. That six cents was a tax, and it went  into the king's pocket. The people said, We won't pay that six cents.  When the tea reached New York, the citizens sent it back again to  England. They did the same thing at Philadelphia. At Charleston they  let it be landed, but it was stored in damp cellars. People would  not buy any of it any more than they would buy so much poison, so  it all rotted and spoiled. At Boston they had a grand \"tea-party.\"  A number of men dressed themselves up like Indians, went on board  the tea-ships at night, broke open all the chests, and emptied the  tea into the harbor.    [Illustration: THE BOSTON \"TEA-PARTY.\"]      133. The king closes the port of Boston; Congress meets at  Philadelphia; the names American and British; what General Gage  tried to do.--The king was terribly angry; and orders were given that  the port of Boston should be closed, so that no ships, except the  king's war-ships, should come in or go out. Nearly all trade stopped  in Boston. Many of the inhabitants began to suffer for want of food,  but throughout the colonies the people tried their best to help them.  The New England towns sent droves of sheep and cattle, New York sent  wheat, South Carolina gave two hundred barrels of rice; the other  colonies gave liberally in money and provisions. Even in England much  sympathy was felt for the distressed people of Boston, and in London  a large sum of money was raised to help those whom the king was  determined to starve into submission.    The colonies now sent some of their best men to Philadelphia to  consider what should be done. As this meeting was made up of those  who had come from all parts of the country, it took the name of the  General or Continental Congress.[14]    About this time, too, a great change took place; for the people  throughout the country began to call themselves Americans, and to  speak of the English troops that the king sent over here as British  soldiers.    In Boston General Gage had command of these soldiers. He knew that  the Americans were getting ready to fight, and that they had stored  up powder and ball at Concord,[15] about twenty miles from Boston.  One night he secretly sent out a lot of soldiers to march to Concord  and destroy what they found there.    [Footnote 14: Congress: this word means a meeting or assembly of  persons. The General or Continental Congress was an assembly of  certain persons sent usually by all of the thirteen American colonies  to meet at Philadelphia or Baltimore, to decide what should be done  by the whole country. The first Congress met in 1774, or shortly  before the Revolution began, and after that from time to time until  near the close of the Revolution.]    [Footnote 15: Concord (Con'cord).]      134. Paul Revere;[16] the fight at Lexington and Concord; Bunker  Hill.--But Paul Revere, a Boston man, was on the watch; and as soon  as he found out which way the British were going, he set off at a  gallop for Lexington, on the road to Concord. All the way out, he  roused people from their sleep, with the cry, \"The British are  coming!\"    [Illustration: PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.]    When the king's soldiers reached Lexington, they found the Americans,  under Captain Parker, ready for them. Captain Parker said to his men,  \"Don't fire unless you are fired on; but if they want a war, _let  it begin here_.\" The fighting did begin there, April 19th, 1775; and  when the British left the town on their way to Concord, seven  Americans lay dead on the grass in front of the village church. At  Concord, that same day, there was still harder fighting; and on the  way back to Boston, a large number of the British were killed.    The next month, June 17th, 1775 a battle was fought on Bunker Hill  in Charlestown, just outside of Boston. General Gage thought the  Yankees wouldn't fight, but they did fight, in a way that General  Gage never forgot; and though they had at last to retreat because  their powder gave out, yet the British lost more than a thousand men.  The contest at Bunker Hill was the first great battle of the  Revolution; that is, of that war which overturned the British power  in America, and made us a free people. Many Englishmen thought the  king was wrong. They would not fight against us, and he was obliged  to hire a large number of German soldiers to send to America. These  Germans had to fight us whether they wanted to or not, for their king  forced them to come.    [Footnote 16: Revere (Re-veer').]      135. Colonel Washington at Mount Vernon; Congress makes him General  Washington, and sends him to take command of the American army.--At  the time the battle of Bunker Hill was fought, Colonel George  Washington was living very quietly at Mount Vernon. His brother  Lawrence had died, and Mount Vernon was now his home. Washington was  very well off: he had a fine estate and plenty of slaves to do the  work on it; but when he died, many years later, he took good care  to leave orders that all of his slaves should be set free as soon  as it could be done.    [Illustration: WASHINGTON AT MOUNT VERNON.]    [Illustration: WASHINGTON TAKING COMMAND OF THE AMERICAN ARMY AT  CAMBRIDGE.]    Congress now made Colonel Washington general, and sent him to  Cambridge, a town just outside of Boston, to take command of the  American army.
