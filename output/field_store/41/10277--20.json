All the  powers of earth seem rapidly combining against him. Mammon is after him;  ambition follows, philosophy follows, and the theology of the day is  fast joining in the cry. They have him in his prison-house; they have  searched his person, and left no prying instrument with him. One after  another they have closed the heavy iron doors upon him; and now they  have him, as it were, bolted in with a lock of a hundred keys, which can  never be unlocked without the concurrence of every key; the keys in the  hands of a hundred different men, and they scattered to a hundred  different and distant places; and they stand musing as to what  invention, in all the dominions of mind and matter, can be produced to  make the impossibility of escape more complete than it is. It is  grossly incorrect to say or assume that the public estimate of the negro  is more favourable now than it was at the origin of the government.    ... There is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people  at the idea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and black  races; and Judge Douglas evidently is basing his chief hope upon the  chances of his being able to appropriate the benefit of this disgust to  himself. If he can, by much drumming and repeating, fasten the odium of  that idea upon his adversaries, he thinks he can struggle through the  storm. He therefore clings to this hope as a drowning man to the last  plank. He makes an occasion for lugging it in from the opposition to the  Dred Scott decision. He finds the Republicans insisting that the  Declaration of Independence includes _all_ men, black as well as white;  and forthwith he boldly denies that it includes negroes at all, and  proceeds to argue gravely that all who contend it does, do so only  because they want to vote, and eat, and sleep, and marry with negroes!  He will have it that they cannot be consistent else. Now I protest  against the counterfeit logic which concludes that because I do not want  a black woman for a slave, I must necessarily want her for a wife. I  need not have her for either. I can just leave her alone. In some  respects she certainly is not my equal; but in her natural right to eat  the bread she earns with her own hands without asking leave of any one  else, she is my equal, and the equal of all others.    Chief Justice Taney, in his opinion in the Dred Scott case, admits that  the language of the Declaration is broad enough to include the whole  human family; but he and Judge Douglas argue that the authors of that  instrument did not intend to include negroes, by the fact that they did  not at once actually place them on an equality with the whites. Now this  grave argument comes to just nothing at all, by the other fact that they  did not at once, nor ever afterward, actually place all white people on  an equality with one another. And this is the staple argument of both  the Chief Justice and the senator, for doing this obvious violence to  the plain, unmistakable language of the Declaration.    I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include _all_  men, but they did not intend to declare all men equal _in all respects_.  They did not mean to say that all were equal in colour, size, intellect,  moral developments, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable  distinctness in what respects they did consider all men created  equal,--equal with \"certain inalienable rights, among which are life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" This they said, and this they  meant. They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were  then actually enjoying that equality, nor yet that they were about to  confer it immediately upon them. In fact, they had no power to confer  such a boon. They meant simply to declare the right, so that the  enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit.    They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society, which should be  familiar to all and revered by all,--constantly looked to, constantly  laboured for, and, even though never perfectly attained, constantly  approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its  influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people  of all colours everywhere. The assertion that \"all men are created  equal,\" was of no practical use in effecting our separation from Great  Britain; and it was placed in the Declaration, not for that, but for  future use. Its authors meant it to be as, thank God, it is now proving  itself, a stumbling-block to all those who in after times might seek to  turn a free people back into the hateful paths of despotism. They knew  the proneness of prosperity to breed tyrants, and they meant, when such  should reappear in this fair land and commence their vocation, that they  should find left for them at least one hard nut to crack.    I have now briefly expressed my view of the meaning and object of that  part of the Declaration of Independence which declares that all men are  created equal. Now let us hear Judge Douglas's view of the same  subject, as I find it in the printed report of his late speech. Here it  is:         \"No man can vindicate the character, motives and conduct of the       signers of the Declaration of Independence except upon the       hypothesis that they referred to the white race alone, and not to       the African, when they declared all men to have been created equal;       that they were speaking of British subjects on this continent being       equal to British subjects born and residing in Great Britain; that       they were entitled to the same inalienable rights, and among them       were enumerated life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The       Declaration was adopted for the purpose of justifying the colonists       in the eyes of the civilized world in withdrawing their allegiance       from the British crown, and dissolving their connection with the       mother-country.\"    My good friends, read that carefully over some leisure hour, and ponder  well upon it; see what a mere wreck and mangled ruin Judge Douglas makes  of our once glorious Declaration. He says \"they were speaking of British  subjects on this continent being equal to British subjects born and  residing in Great Britain!\" Why, according to this, not only negroes but  white people outside of Great Britain and America were not spoken of in  that instrument. The English, Irish, and Scotch, along with white  Americans, were included, to be sure; but the French, Germans, and other  white people of the world are all gone to pot along with the Judge's  inferior races!    I had thought that the Declaration promised something better than the  condition of British subjects; but no, it only meant that we should be  equal to them in their own oppressed and unequal condition. According to  that, it gave no promise that, having kicked off the king and lords of  Great Britain, we should not at once be saddled with a king and lords of  our own.    I had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement  in the condition of all men, everywhere; but no, it merely \"was adopted  for the purpose of justifying the colonists in the eyes of the  civilized world in withdrawing their allegiance from the British crown,  and dissolving their connection with the mother-country.\" Why, that  object having been effected some eighty years ago, the Declaration is of  no practical use now--mere rubbish--old wadding, left to rot on the  battle-field after the victory is won.    I understand you are preparing to celebrate the \"Fourth,\" to-morrow  week. What for? The doings of that day had no reference to the present;  and quite half of you are not even descendants of those who were  referred to at that day. But I suppose you will celebrate, and will even  go so far as to read the Declaration. Suppose, after you read it once in  the old-fashioned way, you read it once more with Judge Douglas's  version. It will then run thus: \"We told these truths to be  self-evident, that all British subjects who were on this continent  eighty-one years ago, were created equal to all British subjects born  and then residing in Great Britain!\"    ... The very Dred Scott case affords a strong test as to which party  most favours amalgamation, the Republicans or the dear Union-saving  Democracy. Dred Scott, his wife and two daughters, were all involved in  the suit. We desired the court to have held that they were citizens, so  far at least as to entitle them to a hearing as to whether they were  free or not; and then also, that they were in fact and in law really  free. Could we have had our way, the chances of these black girls ever  mixing their blood with that of white people would have been diminished  at least to the extent that it could not have been without their  consent. But Judge Douglas is delighted to have them decided to be  slaves, and not human enough to have a hearing, even if they were free,  and thus left subject to the forced concubinage of their masters, and  liable to become the mothers of mulattoes in spite of themselves,--the  very state of the case that produces nine-tenths of all the mulattoes,  all the mixing of the blood of the nation.          _\"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\" On Lincoln's Nomination  to the United States Senate.

[Illustration: Wilney Street Burford]          CHAPTER V    OLD CASTLES      Castles have played a prominent part in the making of England. Many  towns owe their existence to the protecting guard of an old fortress.  They grew up beneath its sheltering walls like children holding the  gown of their good mother, though the castle often proved but a harsh  and cruel stepmother, and exacted heavy tribute in return for partial  security from pillage and rapine. Thus Newcastle-upon-Tyne arose about  the early fortress erected in 1080 by Robert Curthose to guard the  passage of the river at the Pons Aelii. The poor little Saxon village  of Monkchester was then its neighbour. But the castle occupying a fine  strategic position soon attracted townsfolk, who built their houses  'neath its shadow. The town of Richmond owes its existence to the  lordly castle which Alain Rufus, a cousin of the Duke of Brittany,  erected on land granted to him by the Conqueror. An old rhyme tells  how he            Came out of Brittany          With his wife Tiffany,          And his maid Manfras,          And his dog Hardigras.    He built his walls of stone. We must not imagine, however, that an  early Norman castle was always a vast keep of stone. That came later.  The Normans called their earliest strongholds _mottes_, which  consisted of a mound with stockades and a deep ditch and a  bailey-court also defended by a ditch and stockades. Instead of the  great stone keep of later days, \"foursquare to every wind that blew,\"  there was a wooden tower for the shelter of the garrison. You can see  in the Bayeux tapestry the followers of William the Conqueror in the  act of erecting some such tower of defence. Such structures were  somewhat easily erected, and did not require a long period for their  construction. Hence they were very useful for the holding of a  conquered country. Sometimes advantage was taken of the works that the  Romans had left. The Normans made use of the old stone walls built by  the earliest conquerors of Britain. Thus we find at Pevensey a Norman  fortress born within the ancient fortress reared by the Romans to  protect that portion of the southern coast from the attacks of the  northern pirates. Porchester Keep rose in the time of the first Henry  at the north-west angle of the Roman fort. William I erected his  castle at Colchester on the site of the Roman _castrum_. The old Roman  wall of London was used by the Conqueror for the eastern defence of  his Tower that he erected to keep in awe the citizens of the  metropolis, and at Lincoln and Colchester the works of the first  conquerors of Britain were eagerly utilized by him.    One of the most important Roman castles in the country is Burgh  Castle, in North Suffolk, with its grand and noble walls. The late Mr.  G.E. Fox thus described the ruins:--      \"According to the plan on the Ordnance Survey map, the walls    enclose a quadrangular area roughly 640 feet long by 413 wide, the    walls being 9 feet thick with a foundation 12 feet in width. The    angles of the station are rounded. The eastern wall is    strengthened by four solid bastions, one standing against each of    the rounded angles, the other two intermediate, and the north and    south sides have one each, neither of them being in the centre of    the side, but rather west of it. The quaggy ground between the    camp and the stream would be an excellent defence against sudden    attack.\"    [Illustration: Burgh Castle]    Burgh Castle, according to the late Canon Raven, was the Roman station  _Gariannonum_ of the _Notitia Imperii_. Its walls are built of  flint-rubble concrete, and there are lacing courses of tiles. There  is no wall on the west, and Canon Raven used to contend that one  existed there but has been destroyed. But this conjecture seems  improbable. That side was probably defended by the sea, which has  considerably receded. Two gates remain, the principal one being the  east gate, commanded by towers a hundred feet high; while the north is  a postern-gate about five feet wide. The Romans have not left many  traces behind them. Some coins have been found, including a silver one  of Gratian and some of Constantine. Here St. Furseus, an Irish  missionary, is said to have settled with a colony of monks, having  been favourably received by Sigebert, the ruler of the East Angles, in  633 A.D. Burgh Castle is one of the finest specimens of a Roman fort  which our earliest conquerors have left us, and ranks with Reculver,  Richborough, and Pevensey, those strong fortresses which were erected  nearly two thousand years ago to guard the coasts against foreign  foes.    In early days, ere Norman and Saxon became a united people, the castle  was the sign of the supremacy of the conquerors and the subjugation of  the English. It kept watch and ward over tumultuous townsfolk and  prevented any acts of rebellion and hostility to their new masters.  Thus London's Tower arose to keep the turbulent citizens in awe as  well as to protect them from foreign foes. Thus at Norwich the castle  dominated the town, and required for its erection the destruction of  over a hundred houses. At Lincoln the Conqueror destroyed 166 houses  in order to construct a strong _motte_ at the south-west corner of the  old _castrum_ in order to overawe the city. Sometimes castles were  erected to protect the land from foreign foes. The fort at Colchester  was intended to resist the Danes if ever their threatened invasion  came, and Norwich Castle was erected quite as much to drive back the  Scandinavian hosts as to keep in order the citizens. Newcastle and  Carlisle were of strategic importance for driving back the Scots, and  Lancaster Keep, traditionally said to have been reared by Roger de  Poitou, but probably of later date, bore the brunt of many a marauding  invasion. To check the incursions of the Welsh, who made frequent and  powerful irruptions into Herefordshire, many castles were erected in  Shropshire and Herefordshire, forming a chain of fortresses which are  more numerous than in any other part of England. They are of every  shape and size, from stately piles like Wigmore and Goodrich, to the  smallest fortified farm, like Urishay Castle, a house half mansion,  half fortress. Even the church towers of Herefordshire, with their  walls seven or eight feet thick, such as that at Ewias Harold, look as  if they were designed as strongholds in case of need. On the western  and northern borders of England we find the largest number of  fortresses, erected to restrain and keep back troublesome neighbours.    The story of the English castles abounds in interest and romance. Most  of them are ruins now, but fancy pictures them in the days of their  splendour, the abodes of chivalry and knightly deeds, of \"fair ladies  and brave men,\" and each one can tell its story of siege and  battle-cries, of strenuous attack and gallant defence, of prominent  parts played in the drama of English history. To some of these we  shall presently refer, but it would need a very large volume to record  the whole story of our English fortresses.    We have said that the earliest Norman castle was a _motte_ fortified  by a stockade, an earthwork protected with timber palings. That is the  latest theory amongst antiquaries, but there are not a few who  maintain that the Normans, who proved themselves such admirable  builders of the stoutest of stone churches, would not long content  themselves with such poor fortresses. There were stone castles before  the Normans, besides the old Roman walls at Pevensey, Colchester,  London, and Lincoln. And there came from Normandy a monk named Gundulf  in 1070 who was a mighty builder. He was consecrated Bishop of  Rochester and began to build his cathedral with wondrous architectural  skill. He is credited with devising a new style of military  architecture, and found much favour with the Conqueror, who at the  time especially needed strong walls to guard himself and his hungry  followers. He was ordered by the King to build the first beginnings of  the Tower of London. He probably designed the keep at Colchester and  the castle of his cathedral town, and set the fashion of building  these great ramparts of stone which were so serviceable in the  subjugation and overawing of the English. The fashion grew, much to  the displeasure of the conquered, who deemed them \"homes of wrong and  badges of bondage,\" hateful places filled with devils and evil men who  robbed and spoiled them. And when they were ordered to set to work on  castle-building their impotent wrath knew no bounds. It is difficult  to ascertain how many were constructed during the Conqueror's reign.  Domesday tells of forty-nine. Another authority, Mr. Pearson, mentions  ninety-nine, and Mrs. Armitage after a careful examination of  documents contends for eighty-six. But there may have been many  others. In Stephen's reign castles spread like an evil sore over the  land. His traitorous subjects broke their allegiance to their king and  preyed upon the country. The _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ records that  \"every rich man built his castles and defended them against him, and  they filled the land full of castles. They greatly oppressed the  wretched people by making them work at these castles, and when the  castles were finished they filled them with devils and evil men. Then  they took those whom they suspected to have any goods, by night and by  day, seizing both men and women, and they put them in prison for their  gold and silver, and tortured them with pains unspeakable, for never  were any martyrs tormented as these were. They hung some up by their  feet and smoked them with foul smoke; some by their thumbs or by the  head, and they hung burning things on their feet. They"]]]
