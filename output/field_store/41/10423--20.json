He cannot, however, on the appointment of  his successor still continue in office himself, so as to create a  joint chieftainship, as is done in Mekeo. He, as chief, is subject  to no special taboo, and there is no qualification for office,  other, of course, than hereditary right; but no chief can perform  the functions of his office, or build for himself an _emone_,  until he has married. There is no ceremony on the chiefs accession  to office on the death of his predecessor; but there is a ceremony  (to be described hereafter) on a chief's abdication in favour of his  successor. Cases have, I was told, occurred in which a man has in  one way or another forced himself into the position of chief, though  not qualified by descent, and has thus become a chief, from whom  subsequent chieftainship descent has been traced, but I could learn  nothing of the circumstances under which this had occurred. Also it  has happened that, when a chief has been weak, and has not asserted his  position, a sub-chief has more or less usurped his power and influence,  without actually upsetting his chieftainship or supplanting him in  his performance of ceremonial duties.    If the chief on acquiring office by inheritance is a child, or not  qualified to act (_e.g._, unmarried), he is nevertheless chief; but  some person will usually act as his guardian, and perform his functions  for him until he has qualified. This person will probably be one of the  young chief's eldest male paternal relations (_e.g._, the eldest living  brother of the last previous chief), and will presumably be a person  of consequence; but he will not necessarily be one of the sub-chiefs.    All the above observations concerning the hereditary nature of a  chief's office and subsequently explained matters apply also to the  case of a sub-chief, except that there is no ceremony on his resigning  office in favour of his successor, and that the usurpation of the  office of a sub-chief, of the occurrence of which I found no record,  would perhaps be more difficult of accomplishment. In the event of  a village throwing off an offshoot village, or itself splitting up  into two villages, the then existing sub-chief of the original village  would continue his office in it or, in case of a division, in one of  the villages resulting from the split, and the other village would have  for its sub-chief some one of the _ake-baibe_ of the original village,  probably the one who was most active in organising the split. On  the other hand, if several villages united into one, one only of  their sub-chiefs could be sub-chief of the village arising from the  amalgamation, and the others would sink to the rank of _ake-baibe_.    The observations concerning the hereditary nature of a chiefs rank  also apply to the _ake-baibe_. I have no information concerning them  on the other points; but these are not so important as regards these  people, who have no official position and have no duties to perform.    There are, as will be seen hereafter, a number of persons who are  employed from time to time to perform various acts and functions of a  ceremonious or superstitious character, notably the man who has the  important duty of killing pigs at feasts; but these men are not by  virtue of their offices or functions either chiefs or sub-chiefs, or  even notables or important personages. It is in each case a matter of  the specific personal power which the man is believed to possess. Any  of them might happen to be an important personage, and the pig-killer,  whose office is a prominent one, would probably be one; though in his  case muscular strength would, I understand, be an important element  of qualification. [59]                CHAPTER VI    Villages, Emone, Houses and Modes of Inter-Village Communication      Villages and Their Emone and Houses.    The Mafulu villages are generally situated on narrow plateaux or  ridges, sloping down on each side; but the plateaux are not usually so  narrow, nor the slopes so steep, as are those of the Kuni district, and  the villages themselves are not generally so narrow, as the contour of  the country does not involve these conditions to the same extent. Also  the Mafulu villages are on the lower ridges only, and not on the high  mountains; but the actual elevations above sea-level of these lower  ridges are, I think, generally higher than those of the top ridges of  the Kuni. Plate 54 shows the position and surroundings of the village  of Salube (community of Auga), and is a good representative example,  except that the plate does not show any open grassland.    The villages are, or were, protected with stockades and with pits  outside the stockades, and sometimes with platforms on trees near the  stockade boundaries, from which platforms the inhabitants can shoot  and hurl stones upon an enemy climbing up the slope. The stockade  is made of timber, is about 15 to 25 feet high, and is generally  constructed in three or more parallel rows or lines, each of the  lines having openings, but the openings never being opposite to one  another. These protections have now, however, been largely, though  not entirely, discontinued. [60] It is, or was, also the practice,  when expecting an attack, to put into the ground in the approaches  to the village calthrop-like arrow-headed objects, with their points  projecting upwards.    The average size of the villages is small compared with that of the  large villages of Mekeo, some of them having only six or eight houses,  though many villages have thirty houses, and some of them have fifty  or sixty or more. The houses and _emone_ are much smaller than those  of Mekeo, and much ruder and simpler in construction and they have  no carving or other decoration. There are no communal houses.    The houses are ranged in two parallel rows along the side of the ridge,  with an open village space between them, the space being considerably  longer than it is broad, and more or less irregular in shape. The  houses are generally built with their door-openings facing inwards  towards the village enclosure.    At one end of the village, and facing down the open space, is the  chief's or sub-chief's _emone_. These are, like the Roro _marea_  and the Mekeo _ufu_, used, not only in connection with ceremonies,  but also as living houses for men, especially unmarried men, and  for the accommodation of visitors to the village. There are probably  also in the village the _emone_ of one or more of the notables before  mentioned, of which one will be at the other end of the village and  any others will be among the houses at the side of, and facing into,  the village enclosure. There are not often more than three _emone_,  true or otherwise, in one village.    You of course do not find the surrounding palm groves of Mekeo and the  coast; nor do you generally see the waste space behind the houses,  or the ring of garden plots outside the waste space, the position  of the village on its ridge being usually hardly adapted to the  latter. You may, however, often find garden plots very near to the  village. Each family has its own house, and, except as regards the  _emone_ and their use, there are no separate houses for men or women,  or for any class of them.    The Mafulu _emone_ is an oblong building, erected on piles of very  varying height, the interior floor being anything from 3 to 15 feet  above the ground. In size also it varies very much, but generally it  is internally about 12 to 15 feet long from front to back, and about  8 to 12 feet in width. The roof, which is thatched with long, rather  broad leaves, is constructed on the ridge and gable principle, with  the gable ends facing the front and the back, and the roof sloping  on both sides in convex curves from the ridge downwards. Remarkable  and specially distinctive features of the building are the thatched  roof appendages projecting from the tops of the two gable ends  (front and back), the forms of which appendages are somewhat like a  hood or the convex fan-shaped semicircular roof of an apse, and in  construction are sometimes made as rounded overhanging continuations  of the upper part of the roof, and sometimes as independent additions,  not continuous with, and not forming parts of, the actual roof. In  front of the building, but not at the back, is a platform at a level  about a foot below that of the inner floor, extending the whole  length of the front of the building, and projecting forwards to a  distance of from 2 to 5 feet. The approach from the ground to this  platform in the case of a high-built emone is a rudely constructed  ladder, but when the building is only low and near the ground it is  generally merely a rough sloping piece of tree trunk, or even only a  stump. The two gable ends are enclosed with walls made of horizontal  tree branches, two or three of which are, at both the front and rear  ends of the building, discontinued for a short distance in the centre,  so as to leave openings. These openings are, say, 2 feet or more  above the level of the front outside platform, and 1 foot or more  above that of the inside floor, and are usually very small; so that,  in entering or leaving the building, you have to step up to, or even  climb, and wriggle yourself through the opening, and then step down  on the other side. Inside the building you find the centre of the  floor space occupied by a longitudinal fireplace, about 2 feet broad,  extending from front to back of the building; and the floors on each  side of this fireplace slope upwards somewhat from the visible level  of the fire-place towards the sides of the building. The fireplace  part of the interior is, in fact, dropped to a level below that of  the adjoining floors, so as to form a long trough, which is filled  up with soil upon which the fire can burn; and it is the visible  top level of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17928"],[0,"The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany (#17)"],[1,"as symbolical of  the patient, self-sacrificing lover is a familiar feature of Persian  belles-lettres (cf. H. 299. 4; 301. 5; or Rueckert's \"Die Kerze und die  Flasche,\" see above, p. 43). The last line reminds us of a verse of  Jurjani, cited by Jami in the _Baharistan_ (ed. Schlechta-Wssehrd, p.  111), exhorting the ruler to be like a flame, always pointing upwards.    The second book brings another contribution of sententious wisdom, most  of which is neither new nor Oriental. Of Oriental sources the _Gulistan_  is best represented. From it are taken Nos. 8 (_Gul._ ii. 4, last  couplet), 9 (ibid. i. 1), 41 (ibid. i. 21, prose-passage before the  _math_. p. 33; K.S. p. 55), 43 (ibid. i. 17, coupl. 4, p. 29; K.S. p.  49), 52 (ibid. i. 29, coupl. 2; K.S. p. 66). No. 47, which is credited  to Ibn Yamin, is from the _Baharistan_ (tr. K.S. p. 46; _Red._ p. 338).  No. 49 is a very free rendering of a quatrain of 'Umar Xayyam (Whinf.  347; _Red._ p. 81).[215]    The fourth book offers stories, all of which, except the first two, are  from Persian sources. Thus from the _Gulistan_ are \"Die Berichtigung\"  (_Gul._ i. 31; K.S., p. 67) and \"Der Koenigsring\" (_Gul._ iii. 27, last  part, p. 92; K.S. p. 157). \"Nachtigall und Falk\" is from Nidami, as was  pointed out before (see above, p. 43). \"Das Paradies der Glaeubigen\" is  from Jami (_Red._ p. 324; given there as from the _Subhat ul-abrar_) and  \"Ein Bild der Welt\" is from Ibn Yamin (_Red._ p. 236).[216] The longest  story of the book is \"Dara und Sara,\" which gives the legend of the  discovery of wine by King Jamsid, told by Mirchvand in his _Raudat  us-safa_.[217] Besides changing the name of the king to Dara, in  order to make the poem more romantic, we find that Bodenstedt has made  some decided alterations and has considerably amplified the legend. Thus  in his version the motive of the lady's attempt at suicide is despised  love, while in the original it is only a prosaic nervous headache. In  both cases, however, the sequel is the same.    Finally, the sixth book offers very free paraphrases of poems by Rumi,  Sa'di, Amir Mu'izzi and Anvari, who, oddly enough, are termed \"Vorlaeufer  des Mirza Schaffy.\" The source for most of these poems was evidently  Hammer's _Geschichte der schoenen Redekuenste Persiens_. To realize with  what freedom Bodenstedt has treated his models, it is only necessary to  compare some of the poems from Rumi with Hammer's versions, e.g. \"Glaube  und Unglaube\" (_Red._ p. 175), \"Der Mensch und die Welt\" (ibid. p. 180),  \"Des Lebens Kreislauf\" (ibid. p. 178), \"Wach' auf\" (ibid. p. 181). \"Die  Pilger,\" p. 188, attributed to Jami, is likewise from Rumi (_Red._ p.  181; cf. Rueckert, _Werke_, vol. v. p. 220). The poems from Sa'di can  mostly be traced to the _Gulistan_; they are so freely rendered that  they have little in common with the originals except the thought. No. 1  is _Gul._ ii. 18, _qit'ah_ 1, to which the words of Luqman are added;  no. 2 is from _Gul._ iii. 10, couplet (p. 76; K.S. p. 129); no. 3 is  _Gul._ iii. 27, _math_. (p. 89; K.S., p. 151); no. 4 is _Gul._ iii. 27,  _qit'ah_ (p. 91; K.S., p. 154) and no. 5 is _Gul._ i. 39, _math_. The  poem \"Heimat und Fremde\" is taken from Amir Mu'izzi,[218] the court-poet  of Malak Shah, who in turn took it from Anvari. It is cited in the _Haft  Qulzum_ to illustrate a kind of poetic theft.[219] \"Unterschied\" is from  Jami (_Red._ p. 315, given as from _Subhat ul-abrar_), \"Warum\" from Ibn  Yamin (_Red._ p. 235); \"Die Sterne\" and \"Die Zeit\" are both from Anvari  (_Red._ pp. 98, 99).           *       *       *       *       *    So far, Bodenstedt had taken the material for his Oriental poems from  Persia, but now he turned to India and in 1887 appeared _Sakuntala_, a  romantic epic in five cantos. In the main it follows the story of  Kalidasa's famous drama, but the version in the _Mahabharata_ is also  used, and a considerable number of episodes are invented. Even where the  account of the drama is followed, changes of a more or less sweeping  nature are frequent. We cannot say that they strike us as so many  improvements on Kalidasa; they certainly often destroy or obliterate  characteristic Indic features. Thus in the drama the failure of the king  to recognize Sakuntala is the result of a curse pronounced against the  girl by the irascible saint Durvasas, whom she has inadvertently failed  to treat with due respect, and the ring is merely a means of breaking  the spell. All this is highly characteristic of Hindu thought. In  Bodenstedt's poem, however, remembering and forgetting are dependent on  a magic quality inherent in the ring itself,--a trait that is at home in  almost any literature.[220]           *       *       *       *       *    There are, besides, many minor changes. The _vidusaka_, or fun-making  attendant of the king, is left out, and so the warriors express the  sentiments that he utters at the beginning of Act 2. Dusyanta does not  bid farewell to his beloved in person, but leaves a letter. Again, after  he has failed to recognize her, she returns to the hermitage of Kanva,  whereas in the drama she is transported to that of Kasyapa on the  Hemakuta mountain. So, of course, the aerial ride of the king in Indra's  wagon is also done away with.    In many places, on the other hand, the poem follows the drama very  closely. For instance, the passage in the first canto describing the mad  elephant (pp. 14, 15)[221] is a paraphrase of the warning uttered by one  of the holy men in Act 1. Sc. 4 (ed. Kale, p. 40). The discourse of  Sakuntala with her friends (pp. 37, 38), the incident of the bee and  Priyamvada's playful remark (pp. 38-40) are closely modelled after the  fourth scene of Act 1. Many passages of the poem are in fact nothing but  translations. Thus the words which the king on leaving, writes to  Sakuntala (p. 78):        Doch mein Herz wird stets zurueckbewegt,      Wie die wehende Fahne an der Stange,      Die man vollem Wind entgegentraegt--    are a pretty close rendering of the final words of the king's soliloquy  at the end of Act 1:          _gacchati purah sariram dhavati pascad asamstutam cetah cinamsukam        iva ketoh prativatam niyamanasya_         \"my body goes forward; the mind not agreeing with it flies backward       like the silken streamer of a banner borne against the wind.\"    A large part of the whole poem is pure invention, designed to make the  story more exciting by means of a greater variety of incident. Such  invented episodes, for instance, are the gory battle-scenes that take up  the first part of the fourth canto, the omen of the fishes in the fifth,  and the episodes in which Bharata plays the chief role in that canto.  Some of the things told of this boy, how he knocks down the gate-keeper  who refuses to admit his mother, how he strikes the queen Vasumati who  had insulted her, and how he slays the assassin whom this jealous queen  had sent against him, are truly remarkable in view of the fact that the  hero of all these exploits cannot be more than six years of age (see pp.  112, 113). The account in the _Mahabharata_, to be sure, tells of  equally fabulous exploits performed by the youth, but there we move in  an atmosphere of the marvelous. In Bodenstedt's poem, however, the  supernatural has been almost completely banished, and we cannot help  noticing the improbability of these deeds.      FOOTNOTES:    [204] Hebrew by Jos.
