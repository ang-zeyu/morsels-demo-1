Reply Obj. 2: There was no darkness of sin or punishment in the  original state of man and the angels, but there was a certain natural  obscurity in the human and angelic intellect, in so far as every  creature is darkness in comparison with the immensity of the Divine  light: and this obscurity suffices for faith.    Reply Obj. 3: In the original state there was no hearing anything  from man speaking outwardly, but there was from God inspiring  inwardly: thus the prophets heard, as expressed by the Ps. 84:9:  \"I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me.\"  _______________________    SECOND ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 5, Art. 2]    Whether in the Demons There Is Faith?    Objection 1: It would seem that the demons have no faith. For  Augustine says (De Praedest. Sanct. v) that \"faith depends on the  believer's will\": and this is a good will, since by it man wishes to  believe in God. Since then no deliberate will of the demons is good,  as stated above (I, Q. 64, A. 2, ad 5), it seems that in the demons  there is no faith.    Obj. 2: Further, faith is a gift of Divine grace, according to Eph.  2:8: \"By grace you are saved through faith . . . for it is the gift  of God.\" Now, according to a gloss on Osee 3:1, \"They look to strange  gods, and love the husks of the grapes,\" the demons lost their gifts  of grace by sinning. Therefore faith did not remain in the demons  after they sinned.    Obj. 3: Further, unbelief would seem to be graver than other sins, as  Augustine observes (Tract. lxxxix in Joan.) on John 15:22, \"If I had  not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin: but now they  have no excuse for their sin.\" Now the sin of unbelief is in some  men. Consequently, if the demons have faith, some men would be guilty  of a sin graver than that of the demons, which seems unreasonable.  Therefore in the demons there is no faith.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (James 2:19): \"The devils . . .  believe and tremble.\"    _I answer that,_ As stated above (Q. 1, A. 4; Q. 2, A. 1), the  believer's intellect assents to that which he believes, not because  he sees it either in itself, or by resolving it to first self-evident  principles, but because his will commands his intellect to assent.  Now, that the will moves the intellect to assent, may be due to two  causes. First, through the will being directed to the good, and in  this way, to believe is a praiseworthy action. Secondly, because the  intellect is convinced that it ought to believe what is said, though  that conviction is not based on objective evidence. Thus if a  prophet, while preaching the word of God, were to foretell something,  and were to give a sign, by raising a dead person to life, the  intellect of a witness would be convinced so as to recognize clearly  that God, Who lieth not, was speaking, although the thing itself  foretold would not be evident in itself, and consequently the essence  of faith would not be removed.    Accordingly we must say that faith is commended in the first sense in  the faithful of Christ: and in this way faith is not in the demons,  but only in the second way, for they see many evident signs, whereby  they recognize that the teaching of the Church is from God, although  they do not see the things themselves that the Church teaches, for  instance that there are three Persons in God, and so forth.    Reply Obj. 1: The demons are, in a way, compelled to believe, by the  evidence of signs, and so their will deserves no praise for their  belief.    Reply Obj. 2: Faith, which is a gift of grace, inclines man to  believe, by giving him a certain affection for the good, even when  that faith is lifeless. Consequently the faith which the demons have,  is not a gift of grace. Rather are they compelled to believe through  their natural intellectual acumen.    Reply Obj. 3: The very fact that the signs of faith are so evident,  that the demons are compelled to believe, is displeasing to them, so  that their malice is by no means diminished by their belief.  _______________________    THIRD ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 5, Art. 3]    Whether a Man Who Disbelieves One Article of Faith, Can Have Lifeless  Faith in the Other Articles?    Objection 1: It would seem that a heretic who disbelieves one article  of faith, can have lifeless faith in the other articles. For the  natural intellect of a heretic is not more able than that of a  catholic. Now a catholic's intellect needs the aid of the gift of  faith in order to believe any article whatever of faith. Therefore it  seems that heretics cannot believe any articles of faith without the  gift of lifeless faith.    Obj. 2: Further, just as faith contains many articles, so does one  science, viz. geometry, contain many conclusions. Now a man may  possess the science of geometry as to some geometrical conclusions,  and yet be ignorant of other conclusions. Therefore a man can believe  some articles of faith without believing the others.    Obj. 3: Further, just as man obeys God in believing the articles of  faith, so does he also in keeping the commandments of the Law. Now a  man can obey some commandments, and disobey others. Therefore he can  believe some articles, and disbelieve others.    _On the contrary,_ Just as mortal sin is contrary to charity, so is  disbelief in one article of faith contrary to faith. Now charity does  not remain in a man after one mortal sin. Therefore neither does  faith, after a man disbelieves one article.     _I answer that,_ Neither living nor lifeless faith remains in a  heretic who disbelieves one article of faith.    The reason of this is that the species of every habit depends on the  formal aspect of the object, without which the species of the habit  cannot remain. Now the formal object of faith is the First Truth, as  manifested in Holy Writ and the teaching of the Church, which proceeds  from the First Truth. Consequently whoever does not adhere, as to an  infallible and Divine rule, to the teaching of the Church, which  proceeds from the First Truth manifested in Holy Writ, has not the  habit of faith, but holds that which is of faith otherwise than by  faith. Even so, it is evident that a man whose mind holds a conclusion  without knowing how it is proved, has not scientific knowledge, but  merely an opinion about it. Now it is manifest that he who adheres to  the teaching of the Church, as to an infallible rule, assents to  whatever the Church teaches; otherwise, if, of the things taught by  the Church, he holds what he chooses to hold, and rejects what he  chooses to reject, he no longer adheres to the teaching of the Church  as to an infallible rule, but to his own will. Hence it is evident  that a heretic who obstinately disbelieves one article of faith, is  not prepared to follow the teaching of the Church in all things; but  if he is not obstinate, he is no longer in heresy but only in error.  Therefore it is clear that such a heretic with regard to one article  has no faith in the other articles, but only a kind of opinion in  accordance with his own will.    Reply Obj. 1: A heretic does not hold the other articles of faith,  about which he does not err, in the same way as one of the faithful  does, namely by adhering simply to the Divine Truth, because in order  to do so, a man needs the help of the habit of faith; but he holds  the things that are of faith, by his own will and judgment.    Reply Obj. 2: The various conclusions of a science have their  respective means of demonstration, one of which may be known without  another, so that we may know some conclusions of a science without  knowing the others. On the other hand faith adheres to all the  articles of faith by reason of one mean, viz. on account of the First  Truth proposed to us in Scriptures, according to the teaching of the  Church who has the right understanding of them. Hence whoever  abandons this mean is altogether lacking in faith.    Reply Obj. 3: The various precepts of the Law may be referred either  to their respective proximate motives, and thus one can be kept  without another; or to their primary motive, which is perfect  obedience to God, in which a man fails whenever he breaks one  commandment, according to James 2:10: \"Whosoever shall . . . offend  in one point is become guilty of all.\"  _______________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 5, Art. 4]    Whether Faith Can Be Greater in One Man Than in Another?    Objection 1: It would seem that faith cannot be greater in one man  than in another. For the quantity of a habit is taken from its  object. Now whoever has faith believes everything that is of faith,  since by failing in one point, a man loses his faith altogether, as  stated above (A. 3). Therefore it seems that faith cannot be greater  in one than in another.    Obj. 2: Further, those things which consist in something supreme  cannot be \"more\" or \"less.\" Now faith consists in something supreme,  because it requires that man should adhere to the First Truth above  all things. Therefore faith cannot be \"more\" or \"less.\"    Obj. 3: Further, faith is to knowledge by grace, as the understanding  of principles is to natural knowledge, since the articles of faith  are the first principles of knowledge by grace, as was shown above  (Q. 1, A. 7). Now the understanding of principles is possessed in  equal degree by all men. Therefore faith is possessed in equal degree  by all the faithful.    _On the contrary,_ Wherever we find great and little, there we find  more or less. Now in the matter of faith we find great and little,  for Our Lord said to Peter (Matt. 14:31): \"O thou of little faith,  why didst thou doubt?\" And to the woman he said (Matt. 15: 28): \"O  woman, great is thy faith!\" Therefore faith can be greater in one  than in another.    _I answer that,_ As stated above (I-II, Q. 52, AA. 1, 2; I-II, Q. 112,  A. 4), the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18757"],[0,"Prince Henry the Navigator, the Hero of Portugal and of Modern Discovery, (#17)"],[1,"of  Christendom, England and Russia, Bath and Kiev; northern sea-kings like  Sigurd, or Robert of Normandy; even Jewish travellers, rabbis, or  merchants like Benjamin of Tudela. All these, as following in the wake  of the First Crusade, and for the most part stopping at the high-water  mark of its advance, belong to the same group and time and impulse as  Saewulf himself, and are clearly marked off from the great thirteenth  century travellers, who acted as pioneers of the Western Faith and  Empire rather than as camp-followers of its armies.    But except Abbot Daniel (_c._ 1106) and Rabbi Benjamin (_c._ 1160-73)  who stand apart, none of our other pilgrim examples of twelfth century  exploration have anything original or remarkable about them.    Adelard or Athelard, the countryman of Saewulf and Willibald, is still  more the herald of Roger Bacon and of Neckam. He is a theorist far more  than a traveller, and his journey through Egypt and Arabia (_c._  1110-14) appears mainly as one of scientific interest. \"He sought the  causes of all things and the mysteries of Nature,\" and it was with \"a  rich spoil of letters,\" especially of Greek and Arab manuscripts, that  he returned to England to translate into Latin one of the chief works of  Saracen astronomy, the Kharizmian tables. We have already met with him  in trying to follow the transmission of Greek and Indian geography or  world-science through the Arabs to Europe and to Christendom.    [Illustration: THE SPANISH-ARABIC MAP OF 1109. (SEE LIST OF MAPS)]    Abbot Daniel of Kiev in himself is a very ordinary and rather mendacious  traveller, a harmless, devout pilgrim, as careless in all matters of  fact as Antonine the Martyr. But, as representing the beginnings of  Russian expansion, he is of almost unique interest and value. His tract  upon the Holy Road is one of the first proofs of his people's interest  in the world beyond their steppes, and of that nation's readiness and  purpose to expand Christian civilisation in the East as the Franks,  after breaking through the Western Moslems, were now doing. Mediaeval  Russia, Russia before the Tartars, after the Northmen, was now a very  different thing from the \"people fouler than dogs\" of the Arab  explorers. The House of Ruric had guided and organised a nation second  to none in Europe, till it had fallen into the general lines of  Christian development. Jury trial and justices in assize it had taken  from the West; its church and faith and architecture, its manners and  morals came to it from the court of the Roman Empire on the Bosphorus.  Daniel and the other Russians, who passed through that Empire in the age  of Nestor for trade or for religion, were the vanguard of a great  national and race expansion that is now just beginning to \"bestride the  world.\"    In 1022 and 1062 two monks of Kiev are recorded, out of a crowd of the  unknown, as visitors to Syria, and about 1106, probably through the news  of the Frankish conquest, Daniel left his native river, the Snow, in  Little Russia, and passed through Byzantium and by way of the  Archipelago and Cyprus to Jaffa and Jerusalem, describing roughly in  versts or half-miles the whole distance and that of every stage.    His tone is much like Saewulf's and his mistakes are quite as bad, though  he tells of \"nothing but what was seen with these self-same eyes.\" The  \"Sea of Sodom exhales a burning and fetid breath that lays waste all the  country, as with burning sulphur, for the torments of Hell lie under  it.\" This, however, he did not see; Saracen brigands prevented him, and  he learnt that \"the very smell of the place would make one ill.\"    His measurements of distance are all his own. Capernaum is \"in the  desert, not far from the Great Sea (Levant) and eight versts (four  miles) from Caesarea,\" half the distance given in the next chapter as  between Acre and Haifa, and less than half the breadth of the Sea of  Tiberias. The Jordan reminds Daniel of his own river, the Snow,  especially in its sheets of stagnant water.    Samaria, or \"Sebastopol,\" he confuses with Nablous; Bethshan with  Bashan; Lydda with Ramleh; Caesarea Philippi with the greater Caesarea on  the coast. Not far from Capernaum and the Jordan is \"another large river  that comes out of the Lake of Gennesaret, and falls into the Sea of  Tiberias, passing by a large _town_ called Decapolis.\" From Mt. Lebanon  \"six rivers flow east into the Lake of Gennesaret and six west towards  great Antioch, so that this is called Mesopotamia, or the land between  the rivers, and Abraham's Haran is between these rivers that feed the  Lake of Gennesaret.\"    Daniel has left us also an account of his visits to Mar Saba Convent in  the Kedron gorge near the Dead Sea, to Damascus in the train of Prince  Baldwin, and to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, to  witness the miracle of the Holy Fire, noticed by Bernard the Wise, as a  sort of counterpart to the wonder of Beth-Horon, also retold by Daniel  \"when the sun stood still while Joshua conquered King Og of Bashan.\"    It is not in outlook nor in knowledge nor even in the actual ground  traversed that these later pilgrims shew any advance on the chief of the  earlier travellers; it is in the new life and movement, in the new hope  they give us of greater things than these. This is the interest--to  us--in King Sigurd of Norway (1107-11), a Crusader-Norseman in the new  age that owed so much of its very life to the Northmen, but who is only  to be noticed here as a possible type of the explorer-chief--possible,  not actual--for his voyage added nothing definite to the knowledge or  expansion of Christendom. His campaign in Jacob's Land or Gallicia, and  his attack on Moslem Lisbon, some forty years before it became the head  and heart of Portugal, like his exploits in the Balearics, shew us a  point in the steady decline of western Islam, and so far may be called a  preparation for Prince Henry's work, but properly as a chapter of  Portuguese, not of general European, growth.    There were many others like Sigurd,--Robert of Normandy, Godric the  English pirate, who fought his way through the Saracen fleets with a  spear-shaft for his banner, Edgar the AEtheling, grandson of Edmund  Ironside, the Dartmouth fleet of 1147 which retook Lisbon,--but the  Latin conquest of Syria has now brought us past the Crusades, in the  narrower sense, to their results, in the exploration of the Further  East.    The first great name of this time, of our next main chapter of  Preparation, is Benjamin of Tudela, but standing as he does well within  the earlier age, when the primary interest was the Holy War itself, he  is also the last of the Palestine travellers--of those Westerns whose  real horizon was the sacred East of Syria. He is a little before the  awakening of universal interest in the unknown world, for the Christian  Northmen lost with the new definiteness of the new faith much of their  old infinite unrest and fierce inquisitive love of wandering, and their  spirit, though related to the whole Catholic West by the crusading  movement, was not fully realised till the world had been explored and  made known, till the men of Europe were at home in every country and on  every sea.    Benjamin, as a Jew and a rabbi, has the interest of a sectary, and his  work was not of a kind that would readily win the attention of the  Christian world. So the value of his travels was hidden till religious  divisions had ceased to govern the direction of progress. He visited the  Jewish communities from Navarre to Bagdad, and described those beyond  from Bagdad to China, but he wrote for his own people and none but they  seem to have cared about him. What he discovered (_c._ 1160-73) was for  himself and for Judaism, and only his actual place in the twelfth  century makes him a fore-runner of the Polos or of Prince Henry. We may  see this from his hopeless strangeness and confusion in Rome, like a  Frank in Pekin or Delhi. \"The Church of St. Peter is on the site of the  great palace of Julius Caesar, near which are eighty Halls of the eighty  Kings called Emperors from Tarquin to Pepin the father of Charles, who  first took Spain from the Saracens.... In the outskirts of the city is  the palace of Titus, who was deposed by three hundred senators for  wasting three years over the siege of Jerusalem which he should have  finished in two.\"    And so on--with the \"Hall of Galba, three miles round and having a  window for each day in the year,\" with St. John Lateran and its Hebrew  trophies, \"two copper pillars from the temple of Solomon, that sweat at  the anniversary of the burning of the Temple,\" and the \"statues of  Samson and of Absalom\" in the same place. So with Sorrento, \"built by  Hadarezer when he fled before King David,\" with the old Roman tunnel  between Naples and Pozzuoli, \"built by Romulus who feared David and  Joab,\" with Apulia, \"which is from King Pul of Assyria\"--in all this we  have as it were Catholic mythology turned inside out, David put into  Italy when the West put Trajan at the sources of the Nile. It was not  likely that writing of this sort would be read in the society of the  Popes and the Schoolmen, the friars and the crusaders, any more than the  Buddhist records of missionary travel from China one thousand years  before. The religious passion which had set the crusaders in motion,  would keep Catholics as long as it might from the Jews, Turks, infidels,  and heretics they conquered and among whom they settled.    But with the final loss of Jerusalem by the Latins, and the overthrow of  the Bagdad Caliphate by the Mongol Tartars (1258), the barrier of  fanatic hatred was weakened, and Central Asia became an attraction to  Christendom instead of a dim horror, without form and void, except for  Huns and Turks and demons. The Papal court sent mission after mission to  convert the Tartars, who were wavering, as men supposed, between Islam  and "]]]
