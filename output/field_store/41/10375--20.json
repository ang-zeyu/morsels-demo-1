For the present, however, the extraction of proto-paraffine on a large  scale by means of such solvents as amyl and ethyl alcohols is out of  the question on account of their cost. A distillation, under reduced  pressure and with superheated steam, would, however, prevent much of  the decomposition of the original proto-paraffine and increase the  yield of pyro-paraffine.    This study of Zaloziecki's method and the examination of American oils  was suggested by Professor Sadtler and carried out in his laboratory.           *       *       *       *       *          TRANSMISSION OF PRESSURE IN FLUIDS.    By ALBERT B. PORTER.      The young student of physics occasionally has difficulty in grasping  the laws of pressure in fluids. His every day experience has taught  him that a push against a solid body causes it to push in the same  direction, and he often receives with some doubt the statement that  pressure applied to a fluid is transmitted equally in every direction.  The experiments ordinarily shown in illustration of this principle  prove that pressure is transmitted in all directions, but do not prove  the equality of transmission, and in spite of all the text books may  tell him, the student is apt to cling to the idea that a downward  pressure applied to a liquid is more apt to burst the bottom than the  side of the containing vessel.    [Illustration: Figs. 1. and 2.]    The little piece of apparatus shown in Fig. 1 was designed to furnish  a clear demonstration of the principle under consideration. It is  essentially an arrangement by which a downward pressure is applied to  a confined mass of air or water, and the resultant pressures measured  in the three directions, down, up, and sideways. By means of a broken  rat tail file kept wet with turpentine three holes are bored through a  bottle, one through the bottom, one through the side, and one through  the shoulder, as near the neck as may be convenient. The operation is  quick and easy, the only precaution to be observed being to work very  slowly and use but a slight pressure when the glass is nearly  perforated. The holes may be enlarged to any size required by careful  filing with the wet file. From each of the holes a rubber tube leads  to one of the glass manometer tubes at the right in the figure, the  joints being made air tight by slipping into each rubber tube a piece  of glass tubing about half an inch long in order to swell it to the  size of the hole it is to fit. The ends of these glass tubes must be  well rounded by partial fusion in a gas flame, that there may be no  sharp edges to cut the rubber. The bottle rests in a depression in the  turned wood base, the lower rubber tube passing out through a hole in  the wood. Fig. 2 shows the shape of the manometer tubes. They are made  of quarter inch glass tubing bent to shape in a flame and left open at  both ends. They are mounted on a scale board which has several  equidistant horizontal lines running across it. The two bent wires  which support the scale board fit loosely in holes in it and in the  base. This method of mounting is very handy, since it permits the  scale board to be swung to right or left as may be convenient, or  turned round so as to show the fittings on its back, without moving  the bottle. The three manometers are filled to the same level with  mercury, the quantity being adjusted by means of a pipette. A  perforated rubber stopper, fitted with a glass tube on which is  slipped a rubber syringe bulb, completes the apparatus.    When the bulb is pinched between the fingers, the mercury is forced up  to the same height in each of the manometers, thus proving that the  pressure is exerted equally in the three directions, up, down, and  sideways. With the bottle filled with water the same effect follows,  the law being the same for liquids and gases. When using water in the  apparatus it is essential that the rubber tubes, as well as the  bottle, be filled, and when used in the class room it is better to  show the experiment with water first, it being easier and quicker to  empty the bottle and tubes than to fill them.           *       *       *       *       *          PEAR DUCHESSE D'ANGOULEME.      Although well known to fruit growers and generally represented in all  parts of Britain, this noble French pear has not become a universal  favorite. If the quality of the fruit, independently of its fine,  handsome appearance, was bad, or even indifferent, it might be  exterminated from our lists, but this we know is not the case, as any  one who has tasted good samples grown in France, the Channel Islands,  and upon favorable soils in this country will bear out the statement  that the flavor is superb. Some fruits, we know, are quite incapable  of being good, as they have no quality in them; but here we have one  of the hardiest of trees, capable of giving us quantity as well as  quality, provided we cultivate properly. Pears, no doubt, are  capricious, like our seasons, but given a good average year, soils and  stocks which suit them, a light, warm, airy aspect, and good culture,  a great number of varieties formerly only good enough for stewing are  now elevated, and most deservedly so, to the dessert table. But,  assuming that some sorts known to be good do not reach their highest  standard of excellence every year, they are infinitely superior to  many of the old stewers, as they carry their own sugar, a quality  which fits them for consumption by the most delicate invalids. Indeed,  so prominently have choice dessert pears, and apples too for that  matter, come to the front for cooking purposes, that a new demand is  now established, and although Duchesse d'Angouleme, always juicy and  sweet, from bad situations does not always come up to the fine quality  met within Covent Garden in November, it is worthy of our skill, as we  know it has all the good points of a first rate pear when properly  ripened.    The original tree of this pear was observed by M. Anne Pierre  Andusson, a nurseryman at Angers, growing in a farm garden near  Champigne, in Anjou, and having procured grafts of it, he sold the  trees, in 1812, under the name of Poire des Eparannais. In 1820, he  sent a basket of the fruit to the Duchesse d'Angouleme, with a request  to be permitted to name the pear in honor of her. The request was  granted, and the pear has since borne its present name.    That such a fine pear, which does so well in France, would soon find  its way to England there exists little doubt, as we find that within a  few years it became established and well known throughout the United  Kingdom. All the earliest trees would be worked upon the pear or free  stock, and as root pruning until recently was but little practiced, we  may reasonably suppose that the majority of them are deeply anchored  in clay, marl, and other subsoils calculated to force a crude, gross  growth from which high flavored fruit could not be expected. These  defects under modern culture upon the quince and double grafting are  giving way, as we find, on reference to the report of the committee of  the pear conference, held at Chiswick in 1885, that twenty counties in  England, also Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, contributed no less than  121 dishes to the tables, and thirty-eight growers voted in favor of  the Duchesse being recognized as one of our standard dessert  varieties. This step looks like progress, as it is a record of facts  which cannot be gainsaid, and it now remains to be seen whether the  English grower, whose indomitable will has brought him to the front in  the subjugation of other fruits, will be successful with the fine  Duchesse d'Angouleme. Although this remarkable pear cannot easily be  mistaken, for the benefit of those who do not know it, the following  description may not be out of place. Fruit large, often very large, 31/2  inches wide and 3 inches to 4 inches high, roundish obovate, uneven,  and bossed in its outline. Skin greenish yellow, changing to pale dull  yellow, covered with veins and freckles of pale brown russet, and when  grown against a south wall it acquires a brown cheek. Eye open, with  erect dry segments, set in a deep irregular basin. Stalk 1 inch long,  inserted in a deep irregular cavity. Flesh white, buttery, and  melting, with a rich flavor when well ripened; otherwise rather coarse  grained and gritty.    As to culture, experienced fruitists say the tree grows vigorously and  well. It bears abundantly, and succeeds either on the pear or quince  stock, forming handsome pyramids, but is better on the quince. Here,  then, we have the key to the secret of success: The cordon on the  quince; roots near the surface; loam, sound, sandy, and good; and good  feeding. Aspect, a good wall facing south or west--the latter,  perhaps, the best. Those who have not already done so, should try  trees on the quince as pyramids and bushes, as this, like some other  capricious pears, although the fruit be smaller, may put in better  flavor than is met with in fruit from hot walls.--_The Garden._           *       *       *       *       *          SUCCESSION OF FOREST GROWTHS.      The following is from an address delivered by Mr. Robert Douglas  before the Association of American Nurserymen at the meeting in  Chicago recently.    It is the prevailing and almost universal belief that when native  forests are destroyed they will be replaced by other kinds, for the  simple reason that the soil has been impoverished of the constituents  required for the growth of that particular tree or trees. This I  believe to be one of the fallacies handed down from past ages, taken  for granted, and never questioned. Nowhere does the English oak grow  better than where it grew when William the Conqueror found it at the  time he invaded Britain. Where do you find white pines growing better  than in parts of New England where this tree has grown from time"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16983"],[0,"The Kitáb-i-Íqán (#17)"],[1,"within all things the portals of the Ridvan of God are opened,  that seekers may attain the cities of understanding and wisdom, and enter  the gardens of knowledge and power. Within every garden they will behold  the mystic bride of inner meaning enshrined within the chambers of  utterance in the utmost grace and fullest adornment. Most of the verses of  the Qur'an indicate, and bear witness to, this spiritual theme. The verse:  \"Neither is there aught which doth not celebrate His praise\"(106) is  eloquent testimony thereto; and \"We noted all things and wrote them  down,\"(107) a faithful witness thereof. Now, if by \"attainment unto the  Presence of God\" is meant attainment unto the knowledge of such  revelation, it is evident that all men have already attained unto the  presence of the unchangeable Countenance of that peerless King. Why, then,  restrict such revelation to the Day of Resurrection?    And were they to maintain that by \"divine Presence\" is meant the \"Specific  Revelation of God,\" expressed by certain Sufis as the \"Most Holy  Outpouring,\" if this be in the Essence Itself, it is evident that it hath  been eternally in the divine Knowledge. Assuming the truth of this  hypothesis, \"attainment unto the divine Presence\" is in this sense  obviously possible to no one, inasmuch as this revelation is confined to  the innermost Essence, unto which no man can attain. \"The way is barred,  and all seeking rejected.\" The minds of the favourites of heaven, however  high they soar, can never attain this station, how much less the  understanding of obscured and limited minds.    And were they to say that by \"divine Presence\" is meant the \"Secondary  Revelation of God,\" interpreted as the \"Holy Outpouring,\" this is  admittedly applicable to the world of creation, that is, in the realm of  the primal and original manifestation of God. Such revelation is confined  to His Prophets and chosen Ones, inasmuch as none mightier than they hath  come to exist in the world of being. This truth all recognize, and bear  witness thereto. These Prophets and chosen Ones of God are the recipients  and revealers of all the unchangeable attributes and names of God. They  are the mirrors that truly and faithfully reflect the light of God.  Whatsoever is applicable to them is in reality applicable to God, Himself,  Who is both the Visible and the Invisible. The knowledge of Him, Who is  the Origin of all things, and attainment unto Him, are impossible save  through knowledge of, and attainment unto, these luminous Beings who  proceed from the Sun of Truth. By attaining, therefore, to the presence of  these holy Luminaries, the \"Presence of God\" Himself is attained. From  their knowledge, the knowledge of God is revealed, and from the light of  their countenance, the splendour of the Face of God is made manifest.  Through the manifold attributes of these Essences of Detachment, Who are  both the first and the last, the seen and the hidden, it is made evident  that He Who is the Sun of Truth is \"the First and the Last, the Seen, and  the Hidden.\"(108) Likewise the other lofty names and exalted attributes of  God. Therefore, whosoever, and in whatever Dispensation, hath recognized  and attained unto the presence of these glorious, these resplendent and  most excellent Luminaries, hath verily attained unto the \"Presence of God\"  Himself, and entered the city of eternal and immortal life. Attainment  unto such presence is possible only in the Day of Resurrection, which is  the Day of the rise of God Himself through His all-embracing Revelation.    This is the meaning of the \"Day of Resurrection,\" spoken of in all the  scriptures, and announced unto all people. Reflect, can a more precious, a  mightier, and more glorious day than this be conceived, so that man should  willingly forego its grace, and deprive himself of its bounties, which  like unto vernal showers are raining from the heaven of mercy upon all  mankind? Having thus conclusively demonstrated that no day is greater than  this Day, and no revelation more glorious than this Revelation, and having  set forth all these weighty and infallible proofs which no understanding  mind can question, and no man of learning overlook, how can man possibly,  through the idle contention of the people of doubt and fancy, deprive  himself of such a bountiful grace? Have they not heard the well-known  tradition: \"When the Qa'im riseth, that day is the Day of Resurrection?\"  In like manner, the Imams, those unquenchable lights of divine guidance,  have interpreted the verse: \"What can such expect but that God should come  down to them overshadowed with clouds,\"(109)--a sign which they have  unquestionably regarded as one of the features of the Day of  Resurrection--as referring to Qa'im and His manifestation.    Strive, therefore, O my brother, to grasp the meaning of \"Resurrection,\"  and cleanse thine ears from the idle sayings of these rejected people.  Shouldst thou step into the realm of complete detachment, thou wilt  readily testify that no day is mightier than this Day, and that no  resurrection more awful than this Resurrection can ever be conceived. One  righteous work performed in this Day, equalleth all the virtuous acts  which for myriads of centuries men have practised--nay, We ask forgiveness  of God for such a comparison! For verily the reward which such a deed  deserveth is immensely beyond and above the estimate of men. Inasmuch as  these undiscerning and wretched souls have failed to apprehend the true  meaning of \"Resurrection\" and of the \"attainment unto the divine  Presence,\" they therefore have remained utterly deprived of the grace  thereof. Although the sole and fundamental purpose of all learning, and  the toil and labour thereof, is attainment unto, and the recognition of,  this station, yet they are all immersed in the pursuit of their material  studies. They deny themselves every moment of leisure, and utterly ignore  Him, Who is the Essence of all learning, and the one Object of their  quest! Methinks, their lips have never touched the cup of divine  Knowledge, nor do they seem to have attained even a dewdrop of the showers  of heavenly grace.    Consider, how can he that faileth in the day of God's Revelation to attain  unto the grace of the \"Divine Presence\" and to recognize His  Manifestation, be justly called learned, though he may have spent aeons in  the pursuit of knowledge, and acquired all the limited and material  learning of men? It is surely evident that he can in no wise be regarded  as possessed of true knowledge. Whereas, the most unlettered of all men,  if he be honoured with this supreme distinction, he verily is accounted as  one of those divinely-learned men whose knowledge is of God; for such a  man hath attained the acme of knowledge, and hath reached the furthermost  summit of learning.    This station is also one of the signs of the Day of Revelation; even as it  is said: \"The abased amongst you, He shall exalt; and they that are  exalted, He shall abase.\" And likewise, He hath revealed in the Qur'an:  \"And We desire to show favour to those who were brought low in the land,  and to make them spiritual leaders among men, and to make of them Our  heirs.\"(110) It hath been witnessed in this day how many of the divines,  owing to their rejection of the Truth, have fallen into, and abide within,  the uttermost depths of ignorance, and whose names have been effaced from  the scroll of the glorious and learned. And how many of the ignorant who,  by reason of their acceptance of the Faith, have soared aloft and attained  the high summit of knowledge, and whose names have been inscribed by the  Pen of Power upon the Tablet of divine Knowledge. Thus, \"What He pleaseth  will God abrogate or confirm: for with Him is the Source of  Revelation.\"(111) Therefore, it hath been said: \"To seek evidence, when  the Proof hath been established is but an unseemly act, and to be busied  with the pursuit of knowledge when the Object of all learning hath been  attained is truly blameworthy.\" Say O people of the earth! Behold this  flamelike Youth that speedeth across the limitless profound of the Spirit,  heralding unto you the tidings: \"Lo: the Lamp of God is shining,\" and  summoning you to heed His Cause which, though hidden beneath the veils of  ancient splendour, shineth in the land of 'Iraq above the day-spring of  eternal holiness.    O my friend, were the bird of thy mind to explore the heavens of the  Revelation of the Qur'an, were it to contemplate the realm of divine  knowledge unfolded therein, thou wouldst assuredly find unnumbered doors  of knowledge set open before thee. Thou wouldst certainly recognize that  all these things which have in this day hindered this people from  attaining the shores of the ocean of eternal grace, the same things in the  Muhammadan Dispensation prevented the people of that age from recognizing  that divine Luminary, and from testifying to His truth. Thou wilt also  apprehend the mysteries of \"return\" and \"revelation,\" and wilt securely  abide within the loftiest chambers of certitude and assurance.    And it came to pass that on a certain day a number of the opponents of  that peerless Beauty, those that had strayed far from God's imperishable  Sanctuary, scornfully spoke these words unto Muhammad: \"Verily, God hath  entered into a covenant with us that we are not to credit an apostle until  he present us a sacrifice which fire out of heaven shall devour.\"(112) The  purport of this verse is that God hath covenanted with them that they  should not believe in any messenger unless he work the miracle of Abel and  Cain, that is, offer a sacrifice, and the fire from heaven consume it;  even as they had heard it recounted in the story of Abel, which story is  recorded in the scriptures. To this, Muhammad, answering, said: \"Already  have Apostles before me come to you with sure testimonies, and with that  of which ye speak. Wherefore"]]]
