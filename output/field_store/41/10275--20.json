The  cult of Cromm is preserved in some verses:      \"He was their god,     The withered Cromm with many mists...     To him without glory     They would kill their piteous wretched offspring,     With much wailing and peril,     To pour their blood around Cromm Cruaich.     Milk and corn     They would ask from him speedily     In return for a third of their healthy issue,     Great was the horror and fear of him.     To him noble Gaels would prostrate themselves.\"[278]    Elsewhere we learn that this sacrifice in return for the gifts of corn  and milk from the god took place at Samhain, and that on one occasion  the violent prostrations of the worshippers caused three-fourths of them  to die. Again, \"they beat their palms, they pounded their bodies ...  they shed falling showers of tears.\"[279] These are reminiscences of  orgiastic rites in which pain and pleasure melt into one. The god must  have been a god of fertility; the blood of the victims was poured on the  image, the flesh, as in analogous savage rites and folk-survivals, may  have been buried in the fields to promote fertility. If so, the victims'  flesh was instinct with the power of the divinity, and, though their  number is obviously exaggerated, several victims may have taken the  place of an earlier slain representative of the god. A mythic _Crom  Dubh_, \"Black Crom,\" whose festival occurs on the first Sunday in  August, may be another form of Cromm Cruaich. In one story the name is  transferred to S. Patrick's servant, who is asked by the fairies when  they will go to Paradise. \"Not till the day of judgment,\" is the answer,  and for this they cease to help men in the processes of agriculture. But  in a variant Manannan bids Crom ask this question, and the same result  follows.[280] These tales thus enshrine the idea that Crom and the  fairies were ancient gods of growth who ceased to help men when they  deserted them for the Christian faith. If the sacrifice was offered at  the August festival, or, as the texts suggest, at Samhain, after  harvest, it must have been on account of the next year's crop, and the  flesh may have been mingled with the seed corn.    Dagda may thus have been a god of growth and fertility. His wife or  mistress was the river-goddess, Boand (the Boyne),[281] and the children  ascribed to him were Oengus, Bodb Dearg, Danu, Brigit, and perhaps Ogma.  The euhemerists made him die of Cethlenn's venom, long after the battle  of Mag-tured in which he encountered her.[282] Irish mythology is  remarkably free from obscene and grotesque myths, but some of these  cluster round Dagda. We hear of the Gargantuan meal provided for him in  sport by the Fomorians, and of which he ate so much that \"not easy was  it for him to move and unseemly was his apparel,\" as well as his conduct  with a Fomorian beauty. Another amour of his was with Morrigan, the  place where it occurred being still known as \"The Couple's Bed.\"[283] In  another tale Dagda acts as cook to Conaire the great.[284]    The beautiful and fascinating Oengus is sometimes called _Mac Ind Oc_,  \"Son of the Young Ones,\" i.e. Dagda and Boand, or _In Mac Oc_, \"The  Young Son.\" This name, like the myth of his disinheriting his father,  may point to his cult superseding that of Dagda. If so, he may then have  been affiliated to the older god, as was frequently done in parallel  cases, e.g. in Babylon. Oengus may thus have been the high god of some  tribe who assumed supremacy, ousting the high god of another tribe,  unless we suppose that Dagda was a pre-Celtic god with functions similar  to those of Oengus, and that the Celts adopted his cult but gave that of  Oengus a higher place. In one myth the supremacy of Oengus is seen.  After the first battle of Mag-tured, Dagda is forced to become the slave  of Bres, and is much annoyed by a lampooner who extorts the best pieces  of his rations. Following the advice of Oengus, he not only causes the  lampooner's death, but triumphs over the Fomorians.[285] On insufficient  grounds, mainly because he was patron of Diarmaid, beloved of women, and  because his kisses became birds which whispered love thoughts to youths  and maidens, Oengus has been called the Eros of the Gaels. More probably  he was primarily a supreme god of growth, who occasionally suffered  eclipse during the time of death in nature, like Tammuz and Adonis, and  this may explain his absence from Mag-tured. The beautiful story of his  vision of a maiden with whom he fell violently in love contains too many  _Maerchen_ formulae to be of any mythological or religious value. His  mother Boand caused search to be made for her, but without avail. At  last she was discovered to be the daughter of a semi-divine lord of a  _sid_, but only through the help of mortals was the secret of how she  could be taken wrung from him. She was a swan-maiden, and on a certain  day only would Oengus obtain her. Ultimately she became his wife. The  story is interesting because it shows how the gods occasionally required  mortal aid.[286]    Equally influenced by _Maerchen_ formulae is the story of Oengus and  Etain. Etain and Fuamnach were wives of Mider, but Fuamnach was jealous  of Etain, and transformed her into an insect. In this shape Oengus found  her, and placed her in a glass _grianan_ or bower filled with flowers,  the perfume of which sustained her. He carried the _grianan_ with him  wherever he went, but Fuamnach raised a magic wind which blew Etain away  to the roof of Etair, a noble of Ulster. She fell through a smoke-hole  into a golden cup of wine, and was swallowed by Etair's wife, of whom  she was reborn.[287] Professor Rh[^y]s resolves all this into a sun and  dawn myth. Oengus is the sun, Etain the dawn, the _grianan_ the expanse  of the sky.[288] But the dawn does not grow stronger with the sun's  influence, as Etain did under that of Oengus. At the sun's appearance  the dawn begins        \"to faint in the light of the sun she loves,    To faint in his light and to die.\"    The whole story is built up on the well-known _Marchen_ formulae of the  \"True Bride\" and the \"Two Brothers,\" but accommodated to well-known  mythic personages, and the _grianan_ is the Celtic equivalent of various  objects in stories of the \"Cinderella\" type, in which the heroine  conceals herself, the object being bought by the hero and kept in his  room.[289] Thus the tale reveals nothing of Etain's divine functions,  but it illustrates the method of the \"mythological\" school in  discovering sun-heroes and dawn-maidens in any incident, mythical or  not.    Oengus appears in the Fionn cycle as the fosterer and protector of  Diarmaid.[290] With Mider, Bodb, and Morrigan, he expels the Fomorians  when they destroy the corn, fruit, and milk of the Tuatha De  Danann.[291] This may point to his functions as a god of fertility.    Although Mider appears mainly as a king of the _side_ and ruler of the  _brug_ of Bri Leith, he is also connected with the Tuatha Dea.[292]  Learning that Etain had been reborn and was now married to King Eochaid,  he recovered her from him, but lost her again when Eochaid attacked his  _brug_. He was ultimately avenged in the series of tragic events which  led to the death of Eochaid's descendant Conaire. Though his _sid_ is  located in Ireland, it has so much resemblance to Elysium that Mider  must be regarded as one of its lords. Hence he appears as ruler of the  Isle of Falga, i.e. the Isle of Man regarded as Elysium. Thence his  daughter Blathnat, his magical cows and cauldron, were stolen by  Cuchulainn and Curoi, and his three cranes from Bri Leith by  Aitherne[293]--perhaps distorted versions of the myths which told how  various animals and gifts came from the god's land. Mider may be the  Irish equivalent of a local Gaulish god, Medros, depicted on bas-reliefs  with a cow or bull.[294]    The victory of the Tuatha Dea at the first battle of Mag-tured, in June,  their victory followed, however, by the deaths of many of them at the  second battle in November, may point to old myths dramatising the  phenomena of nature, and connected with the ritual of summer and winter  festivals. The powers of light and growth are in the ascendant in  summer; they seem to die in winter. Christian euhemerists made use of  these myths, but regarded the gods as warriors who were slain, not as  those who die and revive again. At the second battle, Nuada loses his  life; at the first, though his forces are victorious, his hand was cut  off by the Fomorian Sreng, for even when victorious the gods must  suffer. A silver hand was made for him by Diancecht, and hence he was  called Nuada _Argetlam_, \"of the silver hand.\" Professor Rh[^y]s regards  him as a Celtic Zeus, partly because he is king of the Tuatha De Danann,  partly because he, like Zeus or Tyr, who lost tendons or a hand through  the wiles of evil gods, is also maimed.[295] Similarly in the _Rig-Veda_  the Acvins substitute a leg of iron for the leg of Vispala, cut off in  battle, and the sun is called \"golden-handed\" because Savitri cut off  his hand and the priests replaced it by one of gold. The myth of Nuada's  hand may have arisen from primitive attempts at replacing lopped-off  limbs, as well as from the fact that no Irish king must have any bodily  defect, or possibly because an image of Nuada may have lacked a hand or  possessed one of silver. Images were often maimed or given artificial  limbs, and myths then arose to explain the custom.[296] Nuada appears to  be a god of life and growth, but he is not a sun-god. His Welsh  equivalent is Llud Llawereint, or \"silver-hand"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14674"],[0,"Ten Great Religions: An Essay in Comparative Theology (#17)"],[1,"   heads indicates that they have renounced worldly desires. In giving     liberty to slaves we become a link between the powerful and weak. We do     not accumulate riches, and we share with the poor that which we     possess. Fasting strengthens the intellectual powers, abstinence and     moderation preserve health. We worship seven times a day, and by our     prayers we aid the living and the dead. On the seventh day we offer     sacrifice, after having purified our hearts and received absolution for     our sins. This religion, so perfect and so excellent, is difficult to     name, but it enlightens darkness by its brilliant precepts. It is     called the Luminous Religion.       5. Learning alone without sanctity has no grandeur, sanctity without     learning makes no progress. When learning and sanctity proceed     harmoniously, the universe is adorned and resplendent.       The Emperor Tai-Tsoung illustrated the Empire. He opened the     revolution, and governed men in holiness. In his time there was a man     of high virtue named Olopen, who came from the kingdom of Ta-Thsin.     Directed by the blue clouds, he bore the Scriptures of the true     doctrine; he observed the rules of the winds, and traversed difficult     and perilous countries       In the ninth year of Tching-Kouan (636) he arrived at Tehang-ngan. The     Emperor ordered Fang-hi-wen-Ling, first minister of the Empire, to go     with a great train of attendants to the western suburb, to meet the     stranger and bring him to the palace. He had the Holy Scriptures     translated in the Imperial library. The court listened to the doctrine,     meditated on it profoundly, and understood the great unity of truth. A     special edict was promulgated for its publication and diffusion.       In the twelfth year of Tching-Kouan, in the seventh moon, during the     autumn, the new edict was promulgated in these terms:--       The doctrine has no fixed name, the holy has no determinate substance;     it institutes religions suitable to various countries, and carries men     in crowds in its tracks. Olopen, a man of Ta-Thsin, and of a lofty     virtue, bearing Scriptures and images, has come to offer them in the     Supreme Court. After a minute examination of the spirit of this     religion, it has been found to be excellent, mysterious, and pacific.     The contemplation of its radical principle gives birth to perfection     and fixes the will. It is exempt from verbosity; it considers only good     results. It is useful to men, and consequently ought to be published     under the whole extent of the heavens. I, therefore, command the     magistrates to have a Ta-Thsin temple constructed in the quarter named     T-ning of the Imperial city, and twenty-one religious men shall be     installed therein.           *       *       *       *       *       10. Sou-Tsoung, the illustrious and brilliant emperor, erected at     Ling-on and other towns, five in all, _luminous_ temples. The primitive     good was thus strengthened, and felicity flourished. Joyous solemnities     were inaugurated, and the Empire entered on a wide course of     prosperity.       11. Tai-Tsoung (764), a lettered and a warlike emperor, propagated the     holy revolution. He sought for peace and tranquillity. Every year, at     the hour of the Nativity (Christmas), he burnt celestial perfumes in     remembrance of the divine benefit; he prepared imperial feasts, to     honor the _luminous_ (Christian) multitude.           *       *       *       *       *       21. This stone was raised in the second year of Kien-Tchoung of the     great dynasty of Thang (A.D. 781), on the seventh day of the moon of     the great increase. At this time the devout Ning-Chou, lord of the     doctrine, governed the luminous multitude in the Eastern country.       Such is the translation of the famous inscription found at Si-ngau-Fou,     in 1625. On the left of the monument are to be read the following words     in the Syriac language: \"In the days of the Father of Fathers,     Anan-Yeschouah, Patriarch _Catholicos_.\" To the right can be traced,     \"Adam, Priest, and Chor-Episcopus\"; and at the base of the inscription:     \"In the year of the Greeks one thousand nine hundred and two (A.D.     781), Mar Yezd-bouzid, Priest and Chor-Episcopus of the Imperial city     of Komdam, son of Millesins, priest of happy memory, of Balkh, a town     of Tokharistan (Turkistan), raised this tablet of stone, on which are     described the benefits of our Saviour, and the preaching of our fathers     in the kingdom of the Chinese. Adam, Deacon, son of Yezd-bouzid,     Chor-Episcopus; Sabar-Jesu, Priest; Gabriel, Priest, Archdeacon, and     Ecclesiarch of Komdam and Sarage.\"           *       *       *       *       *       The abridgment of Christian doctrine given in the Syro-Chinese     inscription of Si-ngau-Fou shows us, also, that the propagators of the     faith in Upper Asia in the seventh century professed the Nestorian     errors.       Through the vague and obscure verbiage which characterizes the Chinese     style, we recognize the mode in which that heresiarch admitted the     union of the Word with man, by indwelling plenitude of grace superior     to that of all the saints. One of the persons of the Trinity     communicated himself to the very illustrious and venerable Messiah,     \"veiling his majesty.\" That is certainly the doctrine of Nestorius;     upon that point the authority of the critics is unanimous.       History, as we have elsewhere remarked, records the rapid progress of     the Nestorian sects in the interior of Asia, and their being able to     hold their ground, even under the sway of the Mussulmans, by means of     compromises and concessions of every kind.       Setting out from the banks of the Tigris or the Euphrates, these ardent     and courageous propagators of the Gospel probably proceeded to     Khorassan, and then crossing the Oxus, directed their course toward the     Lake of Lop, and entered the Chinese Empire by the province of Chen-si.     Olopen, and his successors in the Christian mission, whether Syrians or     Persians by birth, certainly belonged to the Nestorian church.       Voltaire, who did not like to trouble himself with scientific     arguments, and who was much stronger in sarcasm than in erudition,     roundly accuses the missionaries of having fabricated the inscription     on the monument of Si-ngau-Fou, from motives of \"pious fraud.\" \"As if,\"     says Remusat, \"such a fabrication could have been practicable in the     midst of a distrustful and suspicious nation, in a country in which     magistrates and private people are equally ill-disposed towards     foreigners, and especially missionaries, where all eyes are open to     their most trivial proceedings, and where the authorities watch with     the most jealous care over everything relating to the historical     traditions and monuments of antiquity. It would be very difficult to     explain how the missionaries could have been bold enough to have     printed and published in China, and in Chinese, an inscription that had     never existed, and how they could have imitated the Chinese style,     counterfeited the manner of the writers of the dynasty of Thang,     alluded to customs little known, to local circumstances, to dates     calculated from the mysterious figures of Chinese astrology, and the     whole without betraying themselves for a moment; and with such     perfection as to impose on the most skilful men of letters, induced, of     course, by the singularity of the discovery to dispute its     authenticity. It could only have been done by one of the most erudite     of Chinese scholars, joining with the missionaries to impose on his own     countrymen.\"       \"Even that would not be all, for the borders of the inscription are     covered with Syrian names in fine _estranghelo_ characters. The forgers     must, then, have been not only acquainted with these characters, but     have been able to get engraved with perfect exactness ninety lines of     them, and in the ancient writing, known at present to very few.\"       \"This argument of Remusat's,\" says another learned Orientalist, M.     Felix Neve, \"is of irresistible force, and we have formerly heard a     similar one maintained with the greatest confidence by M. Quatremere,     of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, and we allow     ourselves to quote the opinion of so highly qualified a judge upon this     point. Before the last century it would have been absolutely impossible     to forge in Europe a series of names and titles belonging to a     Christian nation of Western Asia; it is only since the fruits of     Assemam's labors have been made public by his family at Rome, that     there existed a sufficient knowledge of the Syriac for such a purpose;     and it is only by the publication of the manuscripts of the Vatican,     that the extent to which Nestorianism spread in the centre of Asia, and     the influence of its hierarchy in the Persian provinces could have been     estimated. There is no reason to suppose that missionaries who left     Europe in the very beginning of the seventeenth century could have     acquired a knowledge which could only be obtained from reading the     originals and not vague accounts of them.\"       The sagacity of M. Saint Martin, who was for a long time the colleague     of M. Quatremere, has pointed out in a note worthy of his erudition,     another special proof, which is by no means to be neglected.       \"Amongst the various arguments,\" he says, \"that might be urged in favor     of the legitimacy of the monument, but of which, as yet, no use has     been made, must not be forgotten the name of the priest by whom it is     said to have been erected. The name _Yezd-bouzid_ is Persian, and at the     epoch when the monument was discovered it would have been impossible to     invent "]]]
