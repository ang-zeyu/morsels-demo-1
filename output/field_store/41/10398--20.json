To the Present Time, Volume 10 (of 12) (#17)"],[1," reign, after Egypt had been for  more than fifty years under the rule of the Macedonians, that the evils  which often follow conquest were brought to an end. Before this reign  no Greek was ever known to have reached Elephantine and Syene or Aswan  since Herodotus made his hasty tour in the Thebaid; and during much of  the last reign no part of Upper Egypt was safe for a Greek traveller,  if he were alone, or if he quitted the highroad. The peasants, whose  feelings of hatred we can hardly wonder at, waylaid the stragglers, and  Egyptian-like as the Greeks said, or slave-like as it would be wiser to  say, often put them to death in cold blood. But a long course of good  government had at last quieted the whole country, and left room for  further improvements by Philadelphus.    Among other buildings, Philadelphus raised a temple in Alexandria to the  honour of his father and mother, and placed in it their statues, made of  ivory and gold, and ordered that they should be worshipped like the  gods and other kings of the country. He also built a temple to Ceres and  Proserpine, and then the Eleusinian mysteries were taught in Alexandria  to the few who were willing and worthy to be admitted. The southeast  quarter of the city in which this temple stood was called the Eleusinis;  and here the troop of maidens were to be seen carrying the sacred basket  through the streets, and singing hymns in honour of the goddess; while  they charged all profane persons, who met the procession, to keep  their eyes upon the ground, lest they should see the basket and the  priestesses, who were too pure for them to look upon.    In this reign was finished the lighthouse on the island of Pharos, as  a guide to ships when entering the harbour of Alexandria by night. The  navigation of the waters of the Red Sea, along which the wind blows hard  from the north for nine months in the year, was found so dangerous by  the little vessels from the south of Arabia, that they always chose the  most southerly port in which they could meet the Egyptian buyers. The  merchants with their bales of goods found a journey on camels through  the desert, where the path is marked only by the skeletons of the  animals that have died upon the route, less costly than a coasting  voyage. Hence, when Philadelphus had made the whole of Upper Egypt to  the cataracts at Aswan (Syene) as quiet and safe as the Delta, he made a  new port on the rocky coast of the Red Sea, nearly two hundred miles to  the south of Cosseir, and named it Berenice after his mother. He also  built four public inns, or watering-houses, where the caravans might  find water for the camels, and shelter from the noonday sun, on their  twelve days' journey through the desert from Koptos on the Nile to this  new port. He rebuilt, and at the same time renamed, the old port of  Cosseir, or AEnnum as it was before called, and named it Philotera after  his younger sister. The trade which thus passed down the Nile from  Syene, from Berenice, and from Philotera, paid a toll or duty at the  custom-house station of Phylake a little below Lycopolis on the west  bank of the river, where a guard of soldiers was encamped; and this  station gradually grew into a town.    [Illustration: 112.jpg ROSETTA BRANCH OF THE NILE]    Philadelphus also built a city on the sands at the head of the Red Sea,  near where Suez now stands, and named it Arsinoe, after his sister; and  he again opened the canal which Necho II. and Darius had begun, by which  ships were to pass from the Nile to this city on the Red Sea. This canal  began in the Pelusiac branch of the river, a little above Bubastis,  and was carried to the Lower Bitter Lakes in the reign of Darius. From  thence Philadelphus wished to carry it forward to the Red Sea, near  the town of Arsinoe, and moreover cleared it from the sands which  soon overwhelmed it and choked it up whenever it was neglected by the  government. But his undertaking was stopped by the engineers finding the  waters of the canal several feet lower than the level of the Red Sea;  and that, if finished, it would become a salt-water canal, which could  neither water the fields nor give drink to the cities in the valley. He  also built a second city of the name of Berenice, called the Berenice  Epidires, at the very mouth of the Red Sea on a point of land where  Abyssinia is hardly more than fifteen miles from the opposite coast of  Arabia. This naming of cities after his mother and sisters was no idle  compliment; they probably received the crown revenues of those cities  for their personal maintenance.    With a view further to increase the trade with the East, Philadelphus  sent Dionysius on an expedition overland to India, to gain a knowledge  of the country and of its means and wants. He went by the way of the  Caspian Sea through Bactria, in the line of Alexander's march. He  dwelt there, at the court of the sovereign, soon after the time that  Megasthenes was there; and he wrote a report of what he saw and learned.  But it is sad to find, in our search for what is valuable in the history  of past times, that the information gained on this interesting journey  of discovery is wholly lost.    In the number of ports which were then growing into the rank of cities,  we see full proof of the great trade of Egypt at that time; and we may  form some opinion of the profit which was gained from the trade of the  Red Sea from the report of Clitarchus to Alexander, that the people of  one of the islands would give a talent of gold for a horse, so plentiful  with them was gold, and so scarce the useful animals of Europe; and one  of the three towns named after the late queen, on that coast, was known  by the name of the Nubian or Golden Berenice, from the large supply of  gold which was dug from the mines in the neighbourhood. In latitude 17 deg.,  separated from the Golden Berenice by one of the forests of Ethiopia,  was the new city of Ptolemais, which, however, was little more than a  post from which the hunting parties went out to catch elephants for  the armies of Egypt. Philadelphus tried to command, to persuade, and to  bribe the neighbouring tribes not to kill these elephants for food, but  they refused all treaty with him; these zealous huntsmen answered that,  if he offered them the kingdom of Egypt with all its wealth, they would  not give up the pleasure of catching and eating elephants. The Ethiopian  forests, however, were able to supply the Egyptian armies with about one  elephant for every thousand men, which was the number then thought best  in the Greek military tactics. Asia had been the only country from which  the armies had been supplied with elephants before Philadelphus brought  them from Ethiopia.    The temple of Isis among the palm groves in Philae, a rocky island in the  Nile near the cataracts of Syene, was begun in this reign, though not  finished till some reigns later. It is still the wonder of travellers,  and by its size and style proves the wealth and good taste of the  priests. But its ornaments are not so simple as those of the older  temples; and the capitals of its columns are varied by the full-blown  papyrus flower of several sizes, its half-opened buds, its closed buds,  and its leaves, and by palm-branches. It seems to have been built on the  site of an older temple which may have 'been overthrown by the Persians.  This island of Philo is the most beautiful spot in Egypt; where the bend  of the river just above the cataracts forms a quiet lake surrounded on  all sides by fantastic cliffs of red granite. Its name is a corruption  from Abu-lakh, the city of the frontier. This temple was one of the  places in which Osiris was said to be buried. None but priests ever set  foot on this sacred island, and no oath was so binding as that sworn in  the name of Him that lies buried in Philae. The statues of the goddess  in the temple were all meant for portraits of the queen Arsinoe. The  priests who dwelt in the cells within the courtyards of the temples of  which we see the remains in this temple at Philae, were there confined  for life to the service of the altar by the double force of religion and  the stone walls. They showed their zeal for their gods by the amount of  want which they were able to endure, and they thought that sitting upon  the ground in idleness, with the knees up to the chin, was one of the  first of religious duties.    [Illustration: 116.jpg TEMPLE OF PHILAE]    The Museum of Alexandria held at this time the highest rank among the  Greek schools, whether for poetry, mathematics, astronomy, or medicine,  the four branches into which it was divided. Its library soon held two  hundred thousand rolls of papyrus; which, however, could hardly have  been equal to ten thousand printed volumes. Many of these were bought by  Philadelphus in Athens and Rhodes; and his copy of Aristotle's works was  bought of the philosopher Nileus, who had been a hearer of that great  man, and afterwards inherited his books through Theophrastus, to whom  they had been left by Aristotle. The books in the museum were of course  all Greek; the Greeks did not study foreign languages, and thought the  Egyptian writings barbarous.    At the head of this library had been Demetrius Phalereus, who, after  ruling Athens with great praise, was banished from his country, and fled  to Ptolemy Soter, under whom he consoled himself for the loss of power  in the enjoyment of literary leisure. He was at the same time the most  learned and the most polished of orators. He brought learning from the  closet into the forum; and, by the soft turn which he gave to public  speaking, made that sweet and lovely which had before been grave and  severe. Cicero thought him the great master in the art of speaking, and  seems to have taken him as the model upon which he wished to form his  own style. He wrote upon philosophy, history, government, and poetry;  but the only one of his works"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17331"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 11 (of 12) (#17)"],[1,"the Ptolemaic system.    In this reign was made a new survey of all the military roads in the  Roman empire, called the _Itinerary of Antoninus_. It included the  great roads of Egypt, which were only six in number. One was from  Contra-Pselcis in Nubia along the east bank of the Nile, to Babylon  opposite Memphis, and there turning eastward through Heliopolis and the  district of the Jews to Clysmon, where Trajan's canal entered the Red  Sea. A second, from Memphis to Pelusium, made use of this for  about thirty miles, joining it at Babylon, and leaving it at Scense  Veteranorum. By these two roads a traveller could go from Pelusium to  the head of the Red Sea; but there was a shorter road through the desert  which joined the first at Serapion, about fifty miles from Clysmon,  instead of at Sceno Veteranorum, which was therefore about a hundred  miles shorter. A fourth was along the west bank of the Nile from Hiera  Sycaminon in Nubia to Alexandria, leaving the river at Andropolis,  about sixty miles from the latter city. A fifth was from Palestine to  Alexandria, running along the coast of the Mediterranean from Raphia to  Pelusium, and thence, leaving the coast to avoid the flat country, which  was under water during the inundation; it joined the last at Andropolis.  The sixth road was from Koptos on the Nile to Berenice on the Red Sea.  These six were probably the only roads under the care of the prefect.  Though Syene was the boundary of the province of Egypt, the Roman power  was felt for about one hundred miles into Nubia, and we find the names  of the emperors on several temples between Syene and Hiera Sycaminon.  But beyond this, though we find inscriptions left by Roman travellers,  the emperors seem never to have aimed at making military roads, or  holding any cities against the inroads of the Blemmyes and other Arabs.    To this survey we must add the valuable geographical knowledge given  by Arrian in his voyage round the shores of the Red Sea, which has come  down to us in an interesting document, wherein he mentions the several  seaports and their distances, with the tribes and cities near the  coast. The trade of Egypt to India, Ethiopia, and Arabia was then most  valuable, and carried on with great activity; but, as the merchandise  was in each case carried only for short distances from city to city, the  traveller could gain but little knowledge of where it came from, or even  sometimes of where it was going.    [Illustration: 115.jpg STATUE OF THE NILE]    The Egyptians sent coarse linen, glass bottles, brazen vessels, brass  for money, and iron for weapons of war and hunting; and they received  back ivory, rhinoceros' teeth, Indian steel, Indian ink, silks, slaves,  tortoise-shell, myrrh, and other scents, with many other Eastern  articles of high price and little weight. The presents which the  merchants made to the petty kings of Arabia were chiefly horses, mules,  and gold and silver vases. Beside this, the ports on the Red Sea carried  on a brisk trade among themselves in grain, expressed oil, wicker  boats, and sugar. Of sugar, or honey from the cane, this is perhaps  the earliest mention found in history; but Arrian does not speak of  the sugar-cane as then new, nor does he tell us where it was grown. Had  sugar been then seen for the first time he would certainly have said  so; it must have been an article well known in the Indian trade. While  passing through Egypt on his travels, or while living there and holding  some post under the prefect, the historian Arrian has left us his name  and a few lines of poetry carved on the foot of the great sphinx near  the pyramids.    At this time also the travellers continued to carve their names and  their feelings of wonder on the foot of the musical statue at Thebes and  in the deep empty tombs of the Theban kings. These inscriptions are full  of curious information. For example, it has been doubted whether the  Roman army was provided with medical officers. Their writers have not  mentioned them. But part of the Second Legion was at this time stationed  at Thebes; and one Asclepiades, while cutting his name in a tomb which  once held some old Theban, has cleared up the doubt for us, by saying  that he was physician to the Second Legion.    Antoninus made a hippodrome, or race-course, for the amusement of the  citizens of Alexandria, and built two gates to the city, called the gate  of the sun and the gate of the moon, the former fronting the harbour and  the latter fronting the lake Mareotis, and joined by the great street  which ran across the whole width of the city. But this reign was not  wholly without trouble; there was a rebellion in which the prefect  Dinarchus lost his life, and for which the Alexandrians were severely  punished by the emperor.    [Illustration: 117.jpg COINS OF MARCUS AURELIUS]    The coins of Marcus Aurelius, the successor of Antoninus Pius, have a  rich variety of subjects, falling not far short of those of the last  reign. On those of the fifth year, the bountiful overflow of the Nile is  gratefully acknowledged by the figure of the god holding a cornucopia,  and a troop of sixteen children playing round him. It had been not  unusual in hieroglyphical writing to express a thought by means of a  figure which in the Koptic language had nearly the same sound; and we  have seen this copied on the coins in the case of a Greek word, when the  bird phoenix was used for the palm-branch phoenix, or the hieroglyphical  word _year_; and a striking instance may be noticed in the case of a  Latin word, as the sixteen children or _cupids_ mean sixteen _cubits_,  the wished-for height of the Nile's overflow. The statue of the Nile,  which had been carried by Vespasian to Rome and placed in the temple of  Peace, was surrounded by the same sixteen children. On the coins of his  twelfth year the sail held up by the goddess Isis is blown towards the  Pharos lighthouse, as if in that year the emperor had been expected in  Alexandria.    We find no coins in the eleventh or fourteenth years of this reign,  which makes it probable that it was in the eleventh year (A.D. 172) that  the rebellion of the native soldiers took place. These were very likely  Arabs who had been admitted into the ranks of the legions, but having  withdrawn to the desert they now harassed the towns with their marauding  inroads, and a considerable time elapsed before they were wholly put  down by Avidius Cassius at the head of the legions. But Cassius himself  was unable to resist the temptations which always beset a successful  general, and after this victory he allowed himself to be declared  emperor by the legions of Egypt; and this seems to have been the cause  of no coins being struck in Alexandria in the fourteenth year of the  reign. Cassius left his son Moecianus in Alexandria with the title of  Pretorian Prefect, while he himself marched into Syria to secure that  province. There the legions followed the example of their brethren in  Egypt, and the Syrians were glad to acknowledge a general of the Eastern  armies as their sovereign. But on Marcus leading an army into Syria he  was met with the news that the rebels had repented, and had put Cassius  to death, and he then moved his forces towards Egypt; but before his  arrival the Egyptian legions had in the same manner put Moecianus to  death, and all had returned to their allegiance.    When Marcus arrived in Alexandria the citizens were agreeably surprised  by the mildness of his conduct. He at once forgave his enemies; and  no offenders were put to death for having joined in the rebellion. The  severest punishment, even to the children of Cassius, was banishment  from the province, but without restraint, and with the forfeiture of  less than half their patrimony. In Alexandria the emperor laid aside the  severity of the soldier, and mingled with the people as a fellow-citizen  in the temples and public places; while with the professors in the  museum he was a philosopher, joining them in their studies in the  schools.    Borne and Athens at this time alike looked upon Alexandria as the centre  of the world's learning. The library was then in its greatest glory;  the readers were numerous, and Christianity had as yet raised no doubts  about the value of its pagan treasures. All the wisdom of Greece,  written on rolls of brittle papyrus or tough parchment, was ranged in  boxes on the shelves. Of these writings the few that have been saved  from the wreck of time are no doubt some of the best, and they are  perhaps enough to guide our less simple taste towards the unornamented  grace of the Greek model. But we often fancy those treasures most  valuable that are beyond our reach, and hence when we run over the names  of the authors in this library we think perhaps too much of those which  are now missing. The student in the museum could have read the lyric  poems of Alcaeus and Stersichorus, which in matter and style were  excellent enough to be judged not quite so good as Homer; the tender  lamentations of Simonides; the warm breathings of Sappho, the tenth  muse; the pithy iambics of Archilochus, full of noble flights and  brave irregularities; the comedies of Menander, containing every kind  of excellence; those of Eupolis and Cratinus, which were equal to  Aristophanes; the histories of Theopompus, which in the speeches were  as good as Thucydides; the lively, agreeable orations of Hyperides, the  accuser of Demosthenes; with the books of travels, chronologies, and  countless others of less merit for style and genius, but which, if they  had been saved, would not have left Egypt wholly without a history.    [Illustration: 120.jpg ALEXANDRIAN FORMS OF WRITING]    The trade of writing and making copies of the old authors employed  a great many hands in the neighbourhood of the museum.
