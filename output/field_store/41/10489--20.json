Are the  reports of these miracles really to be accepted literally, or have they  another meaning? It has been proved by exact science that the essence of  things does not change, and that all beings are under one universal law  and organization from which they cannot deviate; and, therefore, that  which is contrary to universal law is impossible.    Answer.--The Holy Manifestations are the sources of miracles and the  originators of wonderful signs. For Them, any difficult and impracticable  thing is possible and easy. For through a supernatural power wonders  appear from Them; and by this power, which is beyond nature, They  influence the world of nature. From all the Manifestations marvelous  things have appeared.    But in the Holy Books an especial terminology is employed, and for the  Manifestations these miracles and wonderful signs have no importance. They  do not even wish to mention them. For if we consider miracles a great  proof, they are still only proofs and arguments for those who are present  when they are performed, and not for those who are absent.    For example, if we relate to a seeker, a stranger to Moses and Christ,  marvelous signs, he will deny them and will say: \"Wonderful signs are also  continually related of false gods by the testimony of many people, and  they are affirmed in the Books. The Brahmans have written a book about  wonderful prodigies from Brahma.\" He will also say: \"How can we know that  the Jews and the Christians speak the truth, and that the Brahmans tell a  lie? For both are generally admitted traditions, which are collected in  books, and may be supposed to be true or false.\" The same may be said of  other religions: if one is true, all are true; if one is accepted, all  must be accepted. Therefore, miracles are not a proof. For if they are  proofs for those who are present, they fail as proofs to those who are  absent.    But in the day of the Manifestation the people with insight see that all  the conditions of the Manifestation are miracles, for They are superior to  all others, and this alone is an absolute miracle. Recollect that Christ,  solitary and alone, without a helper or protector, without armies and  legions, and under the greatest oppression, uplifted the standard of God  before all the people of the world, and withstood them, and finally  conquered all, although outwardly He was crucified. Now this is a  veritable miracle which can never be denied. There is no need of any other  proof of the truth of Christ.    The outward miracles have no importance for the people of Reality. If a  blind man receives sight, for example, he will finally again become  sightless, for he will die and be deprived of all his senses and powers.  Therefore, causing the blind man to see is comparatively of little  importance, for this faculty of sight will at last disappear. If the body  of a dead person be resuscitated, of what use is it since the body will  die again? But it is important to give perception and eternal life--that  is, the spiritual and divine life. For this physical life is not immortal,  and its existence is equivalent to nonexistence. So it is that Christ said  to one of His disciples: \"Let the dead bury their dead;\" for \"That which  is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is  spirit.\"(88)    Observe: those who in appearance were physically alive, Christ considered  dead; for life is the eternal life, and existence is the real existence.  Wherever in the Holy Books they speak of raising the dead, the meaning is  that the dead were blessed by eternal life; where it is said that the  blind received sight, the signification is that he obtained the true  perception; where it is said a deaf man received hearing, the meaning is  that he acquired spiritual and heavenly hearing. This is ascertained from  the text of the Gospel where Christ said: \"These are like those of whom  Isaiah said, They have eyes and see not, they have ears and hear not; and  I healed them.\"(89)    The meaning is not that the Manifestations are unable to perform miracles,  for They have all power. But for Them inner sight, spiritual healing and  eternal life are the valuable and important things. Consequently, whenever  it is recorded in the Holy Books that such a one was blind and recovered  his sight, the meaning is that he was inwardly blind, and that he obtained  spiritual vision, or that he was ignorant and became wise, or that he was  negligent and became heedful, or that he was worldly and became heavenly.    As this inner sight, hearing, life and healing are eternal, they are of  importance. What, comparatively, is the importance, the value and the  worth of this animal life with its powers? In a few days it will cease  like fleeting thoughts. For example, if one relights an extinguished lamp,  it will again become extinguished; but the light of the sun is always  luminous. This is of importance.          23: THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST      Question.--What is the meaning of Christ's resurrection after three days?    Answer.--The resurrections of the Divine Manifestations are not of the  body. All Their states, Their conditions, Their acts, the things They have  established, Their teachings, Their expressions, Their parables and Their  instructions have a spiritual and divine signification, and have no  connection with material things. For example, there is the subject of  Christ's coming from heaven: it is clearly stated in many places in the  Gospel that the Son of man came from heaven, He is in heaven, and He will  go to heaven. So in chapter 6, verse 38, of the Gospel of John it is  written: \"For I came down from heaven\"; and also in verse 42 we find: \"And  they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother  we know? How is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?\" Also in  John, chapter 3, verse 13: \"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but He  that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.\"    Observe that it is said, \"The Son of man is in heaven,\" while at that time  Christ was on earth. Notice also that it is said that Christ came from  heaven, though He came from the womb of Mary, and His body was born of  Mary. It is clear, then, that when it is said that the Son of man is come  from heaven, this has not an outward but an inward signification; it is a  spiritual, not a material, fact. The meaning is that though, apparently,  Christ was born from the womb of Mary, in reality He came from heaven,  from the center of the Sun of Reality, from the Divine World, and the  Spiritual Kingdom. And as it has become evident that Christ came from the  spiritual heaven of the Divine Kingdom, therefore, His disappearance under  the earth for three days has an inner signification and is not an outward  fact. In the same way, His resurrection from the interior of the earth is  also symbolical; it is a spiritual and divine fact, and not material; and  likewise His ascension to heaven is a spiritual and not material  ascension.    Beside these explanations, it has been established and proved by science  that the visible heaven is a limitless area, void and empty, where  innumerable stars and planets revolve.    Therefore, we say that the meaning of Christ's resurrection is as follows:  the disciples were troubled and agitated after the martyrdom of Christ.  The Reality of Christ, which signifies His teachings, His bounties, His  perfections and His spiritual power, was hidden and concealed for two or  three days after His martyrdom, and was not resplendent and manifest. No,  rather it was lost, for the believers were few in number and were troubled  and agitated. The Cause of Christ was like a lifeless body; and when after  three days the disciples became assured and steadfast, and began to serve  the Cause of Christ, and resolved to spread the divine teachings, putting  His counsels into practice, and arising to serve Him, the Reality of  Christ became resplendent and His bounty appeared; His religion found  life; His teachings and His admonitions became evident and visible. In  other words, the Cause of Christ was like a lifeless body until the life  and the bounty of the Holy Spirit surrounded it.    Such is the meaning of the resurrection of Christ, and this was a true  resurrection. But as the clergy have neither understood the meaning of the  Gospels nor comprehended the symbols, therefore, it has been said that  religion is in contradiction to science, and science in opposition to  religion, as, for example, this subject of the ascension of Christ with an  elemental body to the visible heaven is contrary to the science of  mathematics. But when the truth of this subject becomes clear, and the  symbol is explained, science in no way contradicts it; but, on the  contrary, science and the intelligence affirm it.          24: THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT UPON THE APOSTLES      Question.--What is the manner, and what is the meaning, of the descent of  the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles, as described in the Gospel?    Answer.--The descent of the Holy Spirit is not like the entrance of air  into man; it is an expression and a simile, rather than an exact or a  literal image. No, rather it is like the entrance of the image of the sun  into the mirror--that is to say, its splendor becomes apparent in it.    After the death of Christ the disciples were troubled, and their ideas and  thoughts were discordant and contradictory; later they became firm and  united, and at the feast of Pentecost they gathered together and detached  themselves from the things of this world. Disregarding themselves, they  renounced their comfort and worldly happiness, sacrificing their body and  soul to the Beloved, abandoning their houses, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1929"],[0,"The School for Scandal (#17)"],[1,"the Disappointment hasn't reached your  HEART--your interest only attached you to Maria--had you felt for  her--what I have for that ungrateful Libertine--neither your Temper nor  Hypocrisy could prevent your showing the sharpness of your Vexation.    SURFACE. But why should your Reproaches fall on me for this  Disappointment?    LADY SNEERWELL. Are not you the cause of it? what had you to bate in  your Pursuit of Maria to pervert Lady Teazle by the way.--had you not a  sufficient field for your Roguery in blinding Sir Peter and supplanting  your Brother--I hate such an avarice of crimes--'tis an unfair monopoly  and never prospers.    SURFACE. Well I admit I have been to blame--I confess I deviated from  the direct Road of wrong but I don't think we're so totally defeated  neither.    LADY SNEERWELL. No!    SURFACE. You tell me you have made a trial of Snake since we met--and  that you still believe him faithful to us--    LADY SNEERWELL. I do believe so.    SURFACE. And that he has undertaken should it be necessary--to swear and  prove that Charles is at this Time contracted by vows and Honour to  your Ladyship--which some of his former letters to you will serve to  support--    LADY SNEERWELL. This, indeed, might have assisted--    SURFACE. Come--come it is not too late yet--but hark! this is probably  my Unkle Sir Oliver--retire to that Room--we'll consult further when  He's gone.--    LADY SNEERWELL. Well but if HE should find you out to--    SURFACE. O I have no fear of that--Sir Peter will hold his tongue for  his own credit sake--and you may depend on't I shall soon Discover Sir  Oliver's weak side!--    LADY SNEERWELL. I have no diffidence of your abilities--only be constant  to one roguery at a time--         [Exit.]    SURFACE. I will--I will--So 'tis confounded hard after such bad Fortune,  to be baited by one's confederate in evil--well at all events  my character is so much better than Charles's, that I  certainly--hey--what!--this is not Sir Oliver--but old Stanley  again!--Plague on't that He should return to teaze me just now--I shall  have Sir Oliver come and find him here--and----         Enter SIR OLIVER    Gad's life, Mr. Stanley--why have you come back to plague me at this  time? you must not stay now upon my word!    SIR OLIVER. Sir--I hear your Unkle Oliver is expected here--and tho' He  has been so penurious to you, I'll try what He'll do for me--    SURFACE. Sir! 'tis impossible for you to stay now--so I must beg----come  any other time and I promise you you shall be assisted.    SIR OLIVER. No--Sir Oliver and I must be acquainted--    SURFACE. Zounds Sir then [I] insist on your quitting the--Room  directly--    SIR OLIVER. Nay Sir----    SURFACE. Sir--I insist on't--here William show this Gentleman out. Since  you compel me Sir--not one moment--this is such insolence.         [Going to push him out.]         Enter CHARLES    CHARLES. Heyday! what's the matter now?--what the Devil have you got  hold of my little Broker here! Zounds--Brother, don't hurt little  Premium. What's the matter--my little Fellow?    SURFACE. So! He has been with you, too, has He--    CHARLES. To be sure He has! Why, 'tis as honest a little----But sure  Joseph you have not been borrowing money too have you?    SURFACE. Borrowing--no!--But, Brother--you know sure we expect Sir  Oliver every----    CHARLES. O Gad, that's true--Noll mustn't find the little Broker here to  be sure--    SURFACE. Yet Mr. Stanley insists----    CHARLES. Stanley--why his name's Premium--    SURFACE. No no Stanley.    CHARLES. No, no--Premium.    SURFACE. Well no matter which--but----    CHARLES. Aye aye Stanley or Premium, 'tis the same thing as you say--for  I suppose He goes by half a hundred Names, besides A. B's at the  Coffee-House. [Knock.]    SURFACE. 'Sdeath--here's Sir Oliver at the Door----Now I beg--Mr.  Stanley----    CHARLES. Aye aye and I beg Mr. Premium----    SIR OLIVER. Gentlemen----    SURFACE. Sir, by Heaven you shall go--    CHARLES. Aye out with him certainly----    SIR OLIVER. This violence----    SURFACE. 'Tis your own Fault.    CHARLES. Out with him to be sure.     [Both forcing SIR OLIVER out.]         Enter SIR PETER TEAZLE, LADY TEAZLE, MARIA, and ROWLEY    SIR PETER. My old Friend, Sir Oliver!--hey! what in the name of  wonder!--Here are dutiful Nephews!--assault their Unkle at his first  Visit!    LADY TEAZLE. Indeed Sir Oliver 'twas well we came in to rescue you.    ROWLEY. Truly it was--for I perceive Sir Oliver the character of old  Stanley was no Protection to you.    SIR OLIVER. Nor of Premium either--the necessities of the former could  not extort a shilling from that benevolent Gentleman; and with the other  I stood a chance of faring worse than my Ancestors, and being knocked  down without being bid for.    SURFACE. Charles!    CHARLES. Joseph!    SURFACE. 'Tis compleat!    CHARLES. Very!    SIR OLIVER. Sir Peter--my Friend and Rowley too--look on that elder  Nephew of mine--You know what He has already received from my Bounty and  you know also how gladly I would have look'd on half my Fortune as held  in trust for him--judge then my Disappointment in discovering him to be  destitute of Truth--Charity--and Gratitude--    SIR PETER. Sir Oliver--I should be more surprized at this Declaration,  if I had not myself found him to be selfish--treacherous and  Hypocritical.    LADY TEAZLE. And if the Gentleman pleads not guilty to these pray let  him call ME to his Character.    SIR PETER. Then I believe we need add no more--if He knows himself He  will consider it as the most perfect Punishment that He is known to the  world--    CHARLES. If they talk this way to Honesty--what will they say to ME by  and bye!    SIR OLIVER. As for that Prodigal--his Brother there----    CHARLES. Aye now comes my Turn--the damn'd Family Pictures will ruin  me--    SURFACE. Sir Oliver--Unkle--will you honour me with a hearing--    CHARLES. I wish Joseph now would make one of his long speeches and I  might recollect myself a little--    SIR OLIVER. And I suppose you would undertake to vindicate yourself  entirely--    SURFACE. I trust I could--    SIR OLIVER. Nay--if you desert your Roguery in its Distress and try to  be justified--you have even less principle than I thought you had.--[To  CHARLES SURFACE] Well, Sir--and YOU could JUSTIFY yourself too I  suppose--    CHARLES. Not that I know of, Sir Oliver.    SIR OLIVER. What[!] little Premium has been let too much into the secret  I presume.    CHARLES. True--Sir--but they were Family Secrets, and should not be  mentioned again you know.    ROWLEY. Come Sir Oliver I know you cannot speak of Charles's Follies  with anger.    SIR OLIVER. Odd's heart no more I can--nor with gravity either--Sir  Peter do you know the Rogue bargain'd with me for all his  Ancestors--sold me judges and Generals by the Foot, and Maiden Aunts as  cheap as broken China!    CHARLES. To be sure, Sir Oliver, I did make a little free with the  Family Canvas that's the truth on't:--my Ancestors may certainly rise in  judgment against me there's no denying it--but believe me sincere when I  tell you, and upon my soul I would not say so if I was not--that if I do  not appear mortified at the exposure of my Follies, it is because I  feel at this moment the warmest satisfaction in seeing you, my liberal  benefactor.    SIR OLIVER. Charles--I believe you--give me your hand again: the  ill-looking little fellow over the Couch has made your Peace.    CHARLES. Then Sir--my Gratitude to the original is still encreased.    LADY TEAZLE. [Advancing.] Yet I believe, Sir Oliver, here is one whom  Charles is still more anxious to be reconciled to.    SIR OLIVER. O I have heard of his Attachment there--and, with the young  Lady's Pardon if I construe right that Blush----    SIR PETER. Well--Child--speak your sentiments--you know--we are going to  be reconciled to Charles--    MARIA. Sir--I have little to say--but that I shall rejoice to hear that  He is happy--For me--whatever claim I had to his Affection--I willing  resign to one who has a better title.    CHARLES. How Maria!    SIR PETER. Heyday--what's the mystery now? while he appeared an  incorrigible Rake, you would give your hand to no one else and now that  He's likely to reform I'll warrant You won't have him!    MARIA. His own Heart--and Lady Sneerwell know the cause.    [CHARLES.] Lady Sneerwell!    SURFACE. Brother it is with great concern--I am obliged to speak on  this Point, but my Regard to justice obliges me--and Lady Sneerwell's  injuries can no longer--be concealed--[Goes to the Door.]         Enter LADY SNEERWELL    SIR PETER. Soh! another French milliner egad! He has one in every Room  in the House I suppose--    LADY SNEERWELL. Ungrateful Charles! Well may you be surprised and feel  for the indelicate situation which your Perfidy has forced me into.    CHARLES. Pray Unkle, is this another Plot of yours? for as I have Life I  don't understand it.    SURFACE. I believe Sir there is but the evidence of one Person more  necessary to make it extremely clear.    SIR PETER. And that Person--I imagine, is Mr. Snake--Rowley--you were  perfectly right to bring him with us--and pray let him appear.    ROWLEY. Walk in, Mr. Snake--         Enter SNAKE    I thought his Testimony might be wanted--however it happens unluckily  that He comes to confront Lady Sneerwell and not to support her--    LADY SNEERWELL. A Villain!--Treacherous to me at last! Speak, Fellow,  have you too conspired against me?    SNAKE. I beg your Ladyship--ten thousand Pardons--you paid me extremely  Liberally for the Lie in question--but I unfortunately have been offer'd  double to speak the Truth.    LADY SNEERWELL. The Torments of Shame and Disappointment on you all!    LADY TEAZLE.
