Though some churls at our mirth repine,      Round your foreheads garlands twine;      Drown sorrow in a cup of wine,        And let us all be merry.        Now all our neighbours' chimnies smoke,        And Christmas logs are burning;      Their ovens they with baked meats choke,        And all their spits are turning.      Without the door let sorrow lie;      And if for cold it hap to die,      We'll bury't in a Christmas pie,        And evermore be merry.        Now every lad is wondrous trim,        And no man minds his labour;      Our lasses have provided them        A bag-pipe and a tabor;      Young men and maids, and girls and boys,      Give life to one another's joys;      And you anon shall by their noise        Perceive that they are merry.        Rank misers now do sparing shun;        Their hall of music soundeth;      And dogs thence with whole shoulders run,        So all things there aboundeth.      The country folks themselves advance      For crowdy-mutton's[A] come out of France;      And Jack shall pipe, and Jill shall dance,      And all the town be merry.

Faces there are that tremble,            Bleared with a silent weeping,          Weird in a shadowy sorrow,            As if endless vigil keeping.          Faces of dazzling brightness,            With childlike radiance lighted,          Flashing with many a beauty,            Nor care nor time had blighted.      But o'er them all there's a glamour thrown.      Bright with the dreamy distance alone.            Aglow in the Christmas halo,            Shining with heavenly lustre,          These are the fairy faces            That round the hearthstone cluster.          These the deep, tender records,            Sacred in all their meetness,          That, wakening purest fancies,            Soften us with their sweetness;      As, gathered where flickering fagots burn,      We welcome the holy season's return.           *       *       *       *       *        MERRY CHRISTMAS        ANON        In the rush of the merry morning,        When the red burns through the gray,      And the wintry world lies waiting        For the glory of the day;      Then we hear a fitful rushing        Just without upon the stair,      See two white phantoms coming,        Catch the gleam of sunny hair.        Are they Christmas fairies stealing        Rows of little socks to fill?      Are they angels floating hither        With their message of good-will?      What sweet spell are these elves weaving,        As like larks they chirp and sing?      Are these palms of peace from heaven        That these lovely spirits bring?        Rosy feet upon the threshold,        Eager faces peeping through,      With the first red ray of sunshine,        Chanting cherubs come in view;       Mistletoe and gleaming holly,        Symbols of a blessed day,      In their chubby hands they carry,        Streaming all along the way.        Well we know them, never weary        Of this innocent surprise;      Waiting, watching, listening always        With full hearts and tender eyes,      While our little household angels,      White and golden in the sun,      Greet us with the sweet old welcome,--        \"Merry Christmas, every one!\"           *       *       *       *       *    A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU    THEODORE LEDYARD CUYLER    My own boyhood was spent in a delightful home on one of the most  beautiful farms in Western New York--an experience that any city-bred  boy might envy. We had no religious festivals except Thanksgiving Day  and Christmas, and the latter was especially welcome, not only on  account of the good fare but its good gifts. Christmas was sacred to  Santa Claus, the patron saint of good boys and girls. We counted the  days until its arrival. If the night before the longed-for festival was  one of eager expectation in all our houses, it was a sad time in all  barn-yards and turkey-coops and chicken-roosts; for the slaughter was  terrible, and the cry of the feathered tribes was like \"the mourning of  Hadadrimmon.\" As to our experiences within doors, they are portrayed in  Dr. Clement C. Moore's immortal lines, \"The Night Before Christmas,\"  which is probably the most popular poem for children ever penned in  America. As the visits of Santa Claus in the night could only be through  the chimney, we hung our stockings where they would be in full sight.  Three score and ten years ago such modern contrivances as steam pipes,  and those unpoetical holes in the floor called \"hot-air registers,\" were  as entirely unknown in our rural regions as gas-burners or telephones.  We had a genuine fire-place in our kitchen, big enough to contain an  enormous back-log, and broad enough for eight or ten people to form \"a  circle wide\" before it and enjoy the genial warmth.    The last process before going to bed was to suspend our stockings in the  chimney jambs; and then we dreamed of Santa Claus, or if we awoke in the  night, we listened for the jingling of his sleigh-bells. At the peep of  day we were aroused by the voice of my good grandfather, who planted  himself in the stairway and shouted in a stentorian tone, \"I wish you  all a Merry Christmas!\" The contest was as to who should give the  salutation first, and the old gentleman determined to get the start of  us by sounding his greeting to the family before we were out of our  rooms. Then came a race for the chimney corner; all the stockings came  down quicker than they had gone up. What could not be contained in them  was disposed upon the mantelpiece, or elsewhere. I remember that I once  received an autograph letter from Santa Claus, full of good counsels;  and our colored cook told me that she awoke in the night and, peeping  into the kitchen, actually saw the veritable old visitor light a candle  and sit down at the table and write it! I believed it all as implicitly  as I believed the Ten Commandments, or the story of David and Goliath.  Happy days of childish credulity, when fact and fiction were swallowed  alike without a misgiving! During my long life I have seen many a  day-dream and many an air-castle go the way of Santa Claus and the  wonderful \"Lamp of Aladdin.\"    In after years, when I became a parent, my beloved wife and I,  determined to make the Christmastide one of the golden days of the  twelve months. In mid-winter, when all outside vegetation was bleak and  bare, the Christmas-tree in our parlor bloomed in many-colored beauty  and bounty. When the tiny candles were all lighted the children and our  domestics gathered round it and one of the youngsters rehearsed some  pretty juvenile effusion; as \"they that had found great spoil.\" After  the happy harvesting of the magic tree in my own home, it was my custom  to spend the afternoon or evening in some mission-school and to watch  the sparkling eyes of several hundreds of children while a huge  Christmas-tree shed down its bounties. Fifty years ago, when the  degradation and miseries of the \"Five-Points\" were first invaded by  pioneer philanthropy, it was a thrilling sight to behold the denizens of  the slums and their children as they flocked into Mr. Pease's new \"House  of Industry\" and the \"Brewery Mission\" building. The angelic host over  the hills of Bethlehem did not make a more welcome revelation to them  \"who had sat in darkness and the shadow of death.\" In these days the  squalid regions of our great cities are being explored and improved by  various methods of systematic beneficence. \"Christian Settlements\" are  established; Bureaus of Charity are formed and Associations for the  relief of the poor are organized. A noble work; but, after all, the most  effective \"bureau\" is one that, in a water-proof and a stout pair of  shoes, sallies off on a wintry night to some abode of poverty with not  only supplies for suffering bodies, but kind words of sympathy for  lonesome hearts. A dollar from a warm hand with a warm word is worth two  dollars sent by mail or by a messenger-boy. The secret of power in doing  good is _personal contact_. Our incarnate \"Elder Brother\" went in person  to the sick chamber. He anointed with His own hand the eyes of the blind  man and He touched the loathsome leper into health. The portentous chasm  between wealth and poverty must be bridged by a span of personal  kindness over which the footsteps must turn in only one direction. The  personal contact of self sacrificing benevolence with darkness, filth  and misery--that is the only remedy. Heart must touch heart. Benevolence  also cannot be confined to calendars. Those good people will exhibit the  most of the spirit of our Blessed Master who practice Christmas-giving  and cheerful, unselfish and zealous Christmas-living through all the  circling year.           *       *       *       *       *        CHRISTMAS BELLS        ANON        There are sounds in the sky when the year grows old,        And the winds of the winter blow--      When night and the moon are clear and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18909"],[0,"Poems Teachers Ask For (#17)"],[1,"by the gale!

How flattened the head is, how jammed down the neck is--  In short, the whole owl, what an ignorant wreck 'tis!  I make no apology; I've learned owleology.  I've passed days and nights in a hundred collections,  And cannot be blinded to any deflections  Arising from unskilful fingers that fail  To stuff a bird right, from his beak to his tail.  Mister Brown! Mister Brown! Do take that bird down,  Or you'll soon be the laughing-stock all over town!\"      And the barber kept on shaving.    \"I've _studied_ owls,  And other night fowls,  And I tell you  What I know to be true:  An owl cannot roost  With his limbs so unloosed;  No owl in this world  Ever had his claws curled,  Ever had his legs slanted,  Ever had his bill canted,  Ever had his neck screwed  Into that attitude.  He can't _do_ it, because  'Tis against all bird laws.  Anatomy teaches,  Ornithology preaches,  An owl has a toe  That _can't_ turn out so!  I've made the white owl my study for years,  And to see such a job almost moves me to tears!  Mister Brown, I'm amazed  You should be so gone crazed  As to put up a bird  In that posture absurd!  To _look_ at that owl really brings on a dizziness;  The man who stuffed him don't half know his business!\"        And the barber kept on shaving.    \"Examine those eyes.  I'm filled with surprise  Taxidermists should pass  Off on you such poor glass;  So unnatural they seem  They'd make Audubon scream,  And John Burroughs laugh  To encounter such chaff.  Do take that bird down;  Have him stuffed again, Brown!\"        And the barber kept on shaving.    \"With some sawdust and bark  I could stuff in the dark  An owl better than that.  I could make an old hat  Look more like an owl  Than that horrid fowl,  Stuck up here so stiff like a side of coarse leather.  In fact, about _him _there's not one natural feather.\"  Just then, with a wink and a sly normal lurch,  The owl, very gravely, got down from his perch,  Walked round, and regarded his fault-finding critic  (Who thought he was stuffed) with a glance analytic,  And then fairly hooted, as if he should say:  \"Your learning's at fault this time, anyway;  Don't waste it again on a live bird, I pray.  I'm an owl; you're another. Sir Critic, good-day!\"        And the barber kept on shaving.        _James T. Fields._          At School-Close      The end has come, as come it must    To all things; in these sweet June days  The teacher and the scholar trust    Their parting feet to separate ways.    They part: but in the years to be    Shall pleasant memories cling to each,  As shells bear inland from the sea    The murmur of the rhythmic beach.    One knew the joys the sculptor knows    When, plastic to his lightest touch,  His clay-wrought model slowly grows    To that fine grace desired so much.    So daily grew before her eyes    The living shapes whereon she wrought,  Strong, tender, innocently wise,    The child's heart with the woman's thought.    And one shall never quite forget    The voice that called from dream and play,  The firm but kindly hand that set    Her feet in learning's pleasant way,--    The joy of Undine soul-possessed,    The wakening sense, the strange delight  That swelled the fabled statue's breast    And filled its clouded eyes with sight!    O Youth and Beauty, loved of all!    Ye pass from girlhood's gate of dreams;  In broader ways your footsteps fall,    Ye test the truth of all that seems.    Her little realm the teacher leaves,    She breaks her wand of power apart,  While, for your love and trust, she gives    The warm thanks of a grateful heart.    Hers is the sober summer noon    Contrasted with your morn of spring;  The waning with the waxing moon,    The folded with the outspread wing.    Across the distance of the years    She sends her God-speed back to you;  She has no thought of doubts or fears;    Be but yourselves, be pure, be true,    And prompt in duty; heed the deep,    Low voice of conscience; through the ill  And discord round about you, keep    Your faith in human nature still.    Be gentle: unto griefs and needs    Be pitiful as woman should,  And, spite of all the lies of creeds,    Hold fast the truth that God is good.    Give and receive; go forth and bless    The world that needs the hand and heart  Of Martha's helpful carefulness    No less than Mary's better part.    So shall the stream of time flow by    And leave each year a richer good,  And matron loveliness outvie    The nameless charm of maidenhood.    And, when the world shall link your names    With gracious lives and manners fine,  The teacher shall assert her claims,    And proudly whisper, \"These were mine!\"        _John G. Whittier._          The Wild White Rose    Oh, that I might have my request, and that God would grant me the thing  that I long for.--_Job 6:8._      It was peeping through the brambles, that little wild white rose,  Where the hawthorn hedge was planted, my garden to enclose.  All beyond was fern and heather, on the breezy, open moor;  All within was sun and shelter, and the wealth of beauty's store.  But I did not heed the fragrance of flow'ret or of tree,  For my eyes were on that rosebud, and it grew too high for me.  In vain I strove to reach it through the tangled mass of green,  It only smiled and nodded behind its thorny screen.  Yet through that summer morning I lingered near the spot:  Oh, why do things seem sweeter if we possess them not?  My garden buds were blooming, but all that I could see  Was that little mocking wild rose, hanging just too high for me.    So in life's wider garden there are buds of promise, too,  Beyond our reach to gather, but not beyond our view;  And like the little charmer that tempted me astray,  They steal out half the brightness of many a summer's day.  Oh, hearts that fail with longing for some forbidden tree,  Look up and learn a lesson from my white rose and me.  'Tis wiser far to number the blessings at my feet,  Than ever to be sighing for just one bud more sweet.  My sunbeams and my shadows fall from a pierced Hand,  I can surely trust His wisdom since His heart I understand;  And maybe in the morning, when His blessed face I see,  He will tell me why my white rose grew just too high for me.        _Ellen H. Willis._          L'Envoi      When Earth's last picture is painted, and the tubes are twisted and dried,  When the oldest colors have faded, and the youngest critic has died,  We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it--lie down for an aeon or two,  Till the Master of All Good Workmen shall set us to work anew!    And those who were good shall be happy: they shall sit in a golden chair;  They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comet's hair;  They shall find real saints to draw from--Magdalene, Peter and Paul;  They shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all.    And only the Master shall praise us, and only the Master shall blame;  And no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame;  But each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star,  Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God of Things as They Are!        _Rudyard Kipling._          Whistling in Heaven      You're surprised that I ever should say so?    Just wait till the reason I've given  Why I say I sha'n't care for the music,    Unless there is whistling in heaven.  Then you'll think it no very great wonder,    Nor so strange, nor so bold a conceit,  That unless there's a boy there a-whistling,    Its music will not be complete.    It was late in the autumn of '40;    We had come from our far Eastern home  Just in season to build us a cabin,    Ere the cold of the winter should come;  And we lived all the while in our wagon    That husband was clearing the place  Where the house was to stand; and the clearing    And building it took many days.
