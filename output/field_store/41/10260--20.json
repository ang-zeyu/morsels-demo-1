Again he saw, beyond that silent vale,    One frail and old, without a rich man's gate    Laid down to die beneath a peepul-tree,    And parched with thirst and pierced with sudden pain,    A root his pillow and the earth his bed;    Alone he met the King of terrors there;    Whose wasting body, cumbering now the ground,    Chandalas cast upon the passing stream    To float and fester in the fiery sun,    Till whirled by eddies, caught by roots, it lay    A prey for vultures and for fishes food.      That selfsame day a dart of deadly pain    Shot through that rich man's hard, unfeeling heart,    That laid him low, beyond the power to save,    E'en while his servants cast without his gates    That poor old man, who came to beg him spare    His roof-tree, where his fathers all had died,    His hearth, the shrine of all his inmost joys,    His little home, to every heart so dear;    And in due season tongues of hissing flames    That rich man's robes like snowflakes whirled in air,    And curled his crackling skin, consumed his flesh,    And sucked the marrow from his whitened bones.      But here these two their places seem to change.    That rich man's houses, lands, and flocks and herds,    His servants, rich apparel, stores of gold,    And all he loved and lived for left behind,    The friends that nature gave him turned to foes,    Dependents whom his greed had wronged and crushed    Shrinking away as from a deadly foe;    No generous wish, no gentle, tender, thought    To hide his nakedness, his shriveled soul    Stood stark and bare, the gaze of passers-by;    Nothing within to draw him on and up,    He slinks away, and wanders on and down,    Till in the desert, groveling in the dust,    He digs and burrows, seeking treasures there--    While that poor man, as we count poverty,    Is rich in all that makes the spirit's wealth,    His heart so pure that thoughts of guile    And evil purpose find no lodgment there;    His life so innocent that bitter words    And evil-speaking ne'er escape his lips;    The little that he had he freely shared,    And wished it more that more he might have given;    Now rich in soul--for here a crust of bread    In kindness shared, a cup of water given,    Is worth far more than all Potosi's mines,    And Araby's perfumes and India's silks,    And all the cattle on a thousand hills--    And clothed as with a robe of innocence    The devas welcome him, his troubles passed,    The conflict ended and the triumph gained.      And there two Brahmans press their funeral-pile,    And sink to dust amid the whirling flames.    Each from his lisping infancy had heard    That Brahmans were a high and holy caste,    Too high and holy for the common touch,    And each had learned the Vedas' sacred lore.    But here they parted.  One was cold and proud,    Drawing away from all the humbler castes    As made to toil, and only fit to serve.    The other found within those sacred books    That all were brothers, made of common clay,    And filled with life from one eternal source,    While Brahmans only elder brothers were,    With greater light to be his brother's guide,    With greater strength to give his brother aid;    That he alone a real Brahman was    Who had a Brahman's spirit, not his blood.    With patient toil from youth to hoary age    He taught the ignorant and helped the weak.    And now they come where all external pomp    And rank and caste and creed are nothing worth.    But when that proud and haughty Brahman saw    Poor Sudras and Chandalas clothed in white,    He swept away with proud and haughty scorn,    Swept on and down where heartless selfishness    Alone can find congenial company.    The other, full of joy, his brothers met,    And in sweet harmony they journeyed on    Where higher joys await the pure in heart.      And there he saw all ranks and grades and castes,    Chandala, Sudra, warrior, Brahman, prince,    The wise and ignorant, the strong and weak,    In all the stages of our mortal round    From lisping; infancy to palsied age,    By all the ways to human frailty known,    Enter that vale of shadows, deep and still,    Leaving behind their pomp and power and wealth,    Leaving their rags and wretchedness and want,    And cast-off bodies, dust to dust returned,    By flames consumed or moldering to decay,    While here the real character appeared,    All shows, hypocrisies and shams cast off,    So that a life of gentleness and love    Shines through the face and molds the outer form    To living beauty, blooming not to fade,    While every act of cruelty and crime    Seems like a gangrened ever-widening wound,    Wasting the very substance of the soul,    Marring its beauty, eating out its strength.      And here arrived, the good, in little groups    Together drawn by inward sympathy,    And led by devas, take the upward way    To those sweet fields his opened eyes had seen,    Those ever-widening mansions of delight;    While those poor souls--O sad and fearful sight!--    The very well-springs of the life corrupt,    Shrink from the light and shun the pure and good,    Fly from the devas, who with perfect love    Would gladly soothe their anguish, ease their pain,    Fly on and down that broad and beaten road,    Till in the distance in the darkness lost.    Lost! lost! and must it be forever lost?    The gentle Buddha's all-embracing love    Shrunk from the thought, but rather sought relief    In that most ancient faith by sages taught,    That these poor souls at length may find escape,    The grasping in the gross and greedy swine,    The cunning in the sly and prowling fox,    The cruel in some ravening beast of prey;    While those less hardened, less depraved, may gain    Rebirth in men, degraded, groveling, base.[1]      But here in sadness let us drop the veil,    Hoping that He whose ways are not like ours,    Whose love embraces all His handiwork,    Who in beginnings sees the final end,    May find some way to save these sinful souls    Consistent with His fixed eternal law    That good from good, evil from evil flows.      Here Buddha saw the mystery of life    At last unfolded to its hidden depths.    He saw that selfishness was sorrow's root,    And ignorance its dense and deadly shade;    He saw that selfishness bred lust and hate,    Deformed the features, and defiled the soul    And closed its windows to those waves of love    That flow perennial from Nirvana's Sun.    He saw that groveling lusts and base desires    Like noxious weeds unchecked luxurious grow,    Making a tangled jungle of the soul,    Where no good seed can find a place to root,    Where noble purposes and pure desires    And gentle thoughts wither and fade and die    Like flowers beneath the deadly upas-tree.    He saw that selfishness bred grasping greed,    And made the miser, made the prowling thief,    And bred hypocrisy, pretense, deceit,    And made the bigot, made the faithless priest,    Bred anger, cruelty, and thirst for blood,    And made the tyrant, stained the murderer's knife,    And filled the world with war and want and woe,    And filled the dismal regions of the lost    With fiery flames of passions never quenched,    With sounds of discord, sounds of clanking chains,    With cries of anguish, howls of bitter hate,    Yet saw that man was free--not bound and chained[2]    Helpless and hopeless to a whirling wheel,    Rolled on resistless by some cruel power,    Regardless of their cries and prayers and tears--    Free to resist those gross and groveling lusts,    Free to obey Nirvana's law of love,    The law of order--primal, highest law--    Which guides the great Artificer himself,    Who weaves the garments of the joyful spring,    Who paints the glories of the passing clouds,    Who tunes the music of the rolling spheres,    Guided by love in all His mighty works,    Filling with love the humblest willing heart.      He saw that love softens and sweetens life,    And stills the passions, soothes the troubled breast,    Fills homes with joy and gives the nations peace,    A sovereign balm for all the spirit's wounds,    The living fountain of Nirvana's bliss;    For here before his eyes were countless souls,    Born to the sorrows of a sinful world,    With burdens bowed, by cares and griefs oppressed,    Who felt for others' sorrows as their own,    Who lent a helping hand to those in need,    Returning good for evil, love for hate,    Whose garments now were white as spotless wool,    Whose faces beamed with gentleness and love,    As onward, upward, devas guide their steps,    Nirvana's happy mansions full in view.      He saw the noble eightfold path that mounts    From life's low levels to Nirvana's heights.    Not by steep grades the strong alone can climb,    But by such steps as feeblest limbs may take.    He saw that day by day and step by step,    By lusts resisted and by evil shunned,    By acts of love and daily duties done,    Soothing some heartache, helping those in need,    Smoothing life's journey for a brother's feet,    Guarding the lips from harsh and bitter words,    Guarding the heart from gross and selfish thoughts,    Guarding the hands from every evil act,    Brahman or Sudra, high or low, may rise    Till heaven's bright mansions open to the view,    And heaven's warm sunshine brightens all the way;    While neither hecatombs of victims slain,    Nor clouds of incense wafted to the skies,    Nor chanted hymns, nor prayers to all the gods,    Can raise a soul that clings to groveling lusts.      He saw the cause of sorrow, and its cure.    He saw that waves of love surround the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14366"],[0,"Argentina from a British Point of View, and Notes on Argentine Life (#17)"],[1," one  night, measuring 1.84 metres from the tip of the nose to the root of the  tail, and 1.56 metres across. The man had suddenly come across it while  on foot in the monte, and after wounding it with his Winchester had run  it down with his dogs and killed it.    One evening we caught sight of a tapi (tapir) coming down to drink, but  were unable to shoot on account of the bad light. Each day we saw many  wild pigs (\"chancho moro\") and various kinds of wild cats, including the  splendid \"gato once\" or ounce cat, whose skin is one of the finest, and  only to be compared with the \"lobo\" or golden otter, which has a most  magnificent fluffy pelt with a golden tint on the tips. The latter is  unfortunately getting very rare now.    The great wolf or \"aguaras\" is still common, and is a very stately  beast, as he slopes along with his hind-quarters well under him, with  pricked ears and shaggy black mane.    The forests here are mostly in long strips and clumps, with excellent  pasture land between them; and they contain, among other commoner chaco  trees, lance wood, four crowns, and tala. Amongst the strange trees  there is one enormous broad-leafed tree called \"guapoij,\" which has long  creeping roots, which cling on to neighbouring trees and gradually pull  them down and absorb all their goodness, killing them, and in some  marvellous way apparently eating them up. One finds occasionally one of  these trees embracing another bigger than itself, and gradually rooting  it out of the ground.    On all low ground one generally finds \"Zeibos\"--a tree with very soft  wood and very pretty branches of scarlet flowers.    The wild apricot or \"ijguajay\" grows everywhere, and looks a very  tempting fruit, fatal, however, to most Europeans, as it is a very  powerful purge. The Indian children eat the fruit with joy, and it  apparently has no bad effect on them.    The forests are full of all kinds of animals, and, in addition to those  already mentioned, there are red deer, black and brown monkeys, and  bear, and the ring-tailed coons, which latter make noises like the  grunting of pigs.    Of ground game there are foxes, tattoo or mulita, armadillo, and  ostriches.    Amongst the birds the most common are various kinds of hawks, including  some very much like the great bustard, English brown buzzard, and osprey  falcon, and two or three kinds of parrots and cockatoos, the green  parrots being the curse to agriculturists, eating all the maize, as the  locusts do in the South.    There are many different kinds of \"carpinteros\" or woodpeckers, most of  them having most wonderful plumage of brown, green, scarlet, blue, and  yellow.    A strange bird which is not often seen is the \"tucan,\" a small black  bird, with a beak almost as big as his body, and of a splendid orange  colour with a scarlet tip; he is a top-heavy looking little chap when  seen seated on an orange tree, his favourite haunt.    Amongst table birds there are grey pheasants, martinetta, and  partridges. Of wild fowl, there are enormous varieties, including the  \"pato real\" or great tree duck, whistling mallard, various kinds of teal  and shovellers, widgeon, muscony and hooded duck, black-headed geese,  grey geese, and swans. Amongst water-birds are the black, grey, and  white \"garza\" or heron. The latter are especially valuable on account of  the splendid feathers on the back of their necks. Of the smaller birds  there is the gallinetta, a kind of landrail, the curse of hunters  shooting wild duck, their wretched screech warning every bird in the  district. The beautifully coloured and almost transparently winged  golden moorhen covers every stretch of water inland, and the \"chaja\" or  wild turkey, one of the most useless birds in the Chaco, and quite  uneatable, sends forth his dismal cry \"chaja.\"    The kingfishers are, perhaps, the most noticeable of all the river  birds, and are of all sizes, from the small European variety to one  almost ten times their size. Gorgeously plumaged, they skim, like  flashes of light, over the water, which is full of all kinds of fish  including \"Dorado,\" a splendid fighting fish, excellent eating, which  can be caught with rod or fly, and goes up to 10 kilos in weight;  \"Suravi,\" a great mud fish, which is seen sometimes basking out of  water, weighing up to 50 kilos, with enormous head, and good eating;  \"Savala,\" the mud-eating cruiser, which one sees nearly always with its  tail out of water, and which makes excellent revolver shooting;  \"Palmieta,\" the curse of the Chaco streams and rivers, making bathing  unadvisable on account of its hostile assaults on the extremities of all  foreign bodies; and the \"rallo,\" or sun fish, a large flat fish with a  long tail.    Thus was spent a week of happy days of excursions and explorations,  where sometimes we had to walk through great distances of undergrowth  and the everywhere-abundant prickly cactus, cutting our way with large  cavalry swords, always with our eyes skinned to catch sight of some  strange bird, beast, or flower. Sometimes we waded for miles through  swamps, which, in some places, abound with enormous water snakes up to 6  metres long.    We put up all kinds of water-fowl, as we struggled on, splashing  through rivers, clambering up and skeltering down slippery banks,  reaching home tired and weary every night to recount all the day's  doings, sitting out in the patio in the cool evening, eaten up by  mosquitoes.    So ended my holiday, with hurried packing, much toast-drinking, and a  final little farewell dance to the accompaniment of guitar, gramophone,  mouth-organ, and accordion. The journey south was of no great interest,  half on horseback, half in \"galera,\" or public mail coach, with, as  fellow passengers, a German traveller, a cure (most jovial of beings,  who had brought enough food with him to feed a whole regiment), a head  of police and his men, and two coach boys.    The coach, with five young horses tied in abreast, went bumping and  jolting along hour after hour, until we came to a big river,  unfortunately in flood. The horses were unhitched, tied together and  swum across; a boat coming from some unseen corner, took passengers and  luggage across, leaving the coach itself alone, with a long wire tied to  the end of the pole. The horses were fastened to the end of this wire on  the other side of the river, and then, with a whoop and a cheer, the  coach tumbled head-over-heels into the raging flood, twisting and  turning in all ways, first one side up and then the other, until at last  it reached the near bank. And so we travelled on, back to civilisation;  a tiring journey in dust and heat by rail, bringing us home to the same  old flat, treeless, priceless plains of the Central Argentine, to dream  for many days of birds, fishes, animals, flowers, trees, good friends,  and the fine natives of the Northern Chaco.          WORK IN THE WOODS.          WORK IN THE WOODS.      The worker in the forests is of necessity an early riser, the nature of  his task requiring that he should be up betimes. His preparations for  breakfast are simple, and he is ready to start out after half an hour  spent in imbibing a few mates full of yerba infusion. The cartmen tie in  their bullocks, kept overnight in a corral, and drive off to bring in  wood prepared by the axemen, the bullock-herd takes his charges to  pasture and the men's employer mounts his horse to visit the camp of his  axemen, or goes to the store to fetch meat and provisions. The axemen  generally live in tents or temporary shelters, convenient to their work,  and some distance from the contractor's rancho. They have to work hard,  stripped to the waist in summer; they fell the trees, and either square  the logs for baulks and sleepers, or cut the bark and outside layer of  white wood off to make logs for export, working by moonlight when the  heat of the day is excessive. Their food consists of biscuits, called  Galleta, dried to the consistency of flint; these they soften in soup  made from fresh meat or dried \"Charki.\" To this soup is added rice,  maize, or \"Fido's,\" which is coarse macaroni.    The favourite roast, called the \"Asado,\" is made from ribs of beef  impaled on a stick and placed near the fire till sufficiently cooked.  This delicacy, usually as hard as nails, is enjoyed by the men, who cut  off portions, which they hold in their teeth, while, with a jack-knife,  mouthfuls are sawn off close to the nose, at the risk of shortening that  organ. Water is drunk, or coffee sweetened liberally with moist sugar.  This coffee is made in the country, chiefly from beans or maize, with a  large percentage of chicory to give it body.    It is picturesque to see a long string of carts enter a deposit to the  sound of pistol cracks from long whips, and to watch the cartmen unload  the heavy logs.    A cartman will load his cart with logs of a ton and upwards, each with  the aid of his team of bullocks, placing the chains so that the animals,  at the desired moment, by advancing a short distance, roll the log from  the ground on to the cart. In the case of very heavy logs the cart is  placed upside down on the log, which is then bound to it, and the  bullocks pull the whole thing over. The distances which have to be  covered by these carts are considerable, fifteen miles in the day is not  unusual, changing bullocks once en route, but a great deal depends on  the roads being dry, as in wet weather the wheels sink up to the hubs in  the mud and the roads are soon dotted here and there with loads  abandoned till better conditions enable them to be reloaded and  delivered at a depository.    These cartmen are hardy fellows and work wet to the skin, covered with  mud up to their knees, or, again, hidden in the dust from the roads,  which envelopes the moving carts in a choking cloud.    It is little to be wondered at if the axemen and cartmen, when pay day  arrives, go in for a spree, which for"]]]
