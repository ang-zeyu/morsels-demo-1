I never at any time or place or in any way misrepresented that  organization. When asked what concerted action had been taken by churches  and great moral agencies in America to put down Lynch Law, I was compelled  in truth to say that no such action had occurred, that pulpit, press and  moral agencies in the main were silent and for reasons known to  themselves, ignored the awful conditions which to the English people  appeared so abhorent. Then the question was asked what the great moral  reformers like Miss Frances Willard and Mr. Moody had done to suppress  Lynch Law and again I answered nothing. That Mr. Moody had never said a  word against lynching in any of his trips to the South, or in the North  either, so far as was known, and that Miss Willard's only public utterance  on the situation had condoned lynching and other unjust practices of the  South against the Negro. When proof of these statements was demanded, I  sent a letter containing a copy of the _New York Voice_, Oct. 23,1890, in  which appeared Miss Willard's own words of wholesale slander against the  colored race and condonation of Southern white people's outrages against  us. My letter in part reads as follows:      But Miss Willard, the great temperance leader, went even further in    putting the seal of her approval upon the southerners' method of dealing    with the Negro. In October, 1890, the Women's Christian Temperance Union    held its national meeting at Atlanta, Georgia. It was the first time in    the history of the organization that it had gone south for a national    meeting, and met the southerners in their own homes. They were welcomed    with open arms. The governor of the state and the legislature gave    special audiences in the halls of state legislation to the temperance    workers. They set out to capture the northerners to their way of seeing    things, and without troubling to hear the Negro side of the question,    these temperance people accepted the white man's story of the problem    with which he had to deal. State organizers were appointed that year,    who had gone through the southern states since then, but in obedience to    southern prejudices have confined their work to white persons only. It    is only after Negroes are in prison for crimes that efforts of these    temperance women are exerted without regard to \"race, color, or previous    condition.\" No \"ounce of prevention\" is used in their case; they are    black, and if these women went among the Negroes for this work, the    whites would not receive them. Except here and there, are found no    temperance workers of the Negro race; \"the great dark-faced mobs\" are    left the easy prey of the saloonkeepers.      There was pending in the National Congress at this time a Federal    Election Bill, the object being to give the National Government control    of the national elections in the several states. Had this bill become a    law, the Negro, whose vote has been systematically suppressed since 1875    in the southern states, would have had the protection of the National    Government, and his vote counted. The South would have been no longer    \"solid\"; the Southerners saw that the balance of power which they    unlawfully held in the House of Representatives and the Electoral    College, based on the Negro population, would be wrested from them. So    they nick-named the pending elections law the \"Force Bill\"--probably    because it would force them to disgorge their ill-gotten political    gains--and defeated it. While it was being discussed, the question was    submitted to Miss Willard: \"What do you think of the race problem and    the Force Bill?\"      Said Miss Willard: \"Now, as to the 'race problem' in its minified,    current meaning, I am a true lover of the southern people--have spoken    and worked in, perhaps, 200 of their towns and cities; have been taken    into their love and confidence at scores of hospitable firesides; have    heard them pour out their hearts in the splendid frankness of their    impetuous natures. And I have said to them at such times: 'When I go    North there will be wafted to you no word from pen or voice that is not    loyal to what we are saying here and now.' Going South, a woman, a    temperance woman, and a Northern temperance woman--three great barriers    to their good will yonder--I was received by them with a confidence that    was one of the most delightful surprises of my life. I think we have    wronged the South, though we did not mean to do so. The reason was, in    part, that we had irreparably wronged ourselves by putting no safeguards    on the ballot box at the North that would sift out alien illiterates.    They rule our cities today; the saloon is their palace, and the toddy    stick their sceptre. It is not fair that they should vote, nor is it    fair that a plantation Negro, who can neither read nor write, whose    ideas are bounded by the fence of his own field and the price of his own    mule, should be entrusted with the ballot. We ought to have put an    educational test upon that ballot from the first. The Anglo-Saxon race    will never submit to be dominated by the Negro so long as his altitude    reaches no higher than the personal liberty of the saloon, and the power    of appreciating the amount of liquor that a dollar will buy. New England    would no more submit to this than South Carolina. 'Better whisky and    more of it' has been the rallying cry of great dark-faced mobs in the    Southern localities where local option was snowed under by the colored    vote. Temperance has no enemy like that, for it is unreasoning and    unreasonable. Tonight it promises in a great congregation to vote for    temperance at the polls tomorrow; but tomorrow twenty-five cents changes    that vote in favor of the liquor-seller.      \"I pity the southerners, and I believe the great mass of them are as    conscientious and kindly intentioned toward the colored man as an equal    number of white church-members of the North. Would-be demagogues lead    the colored people to destruction. Half-drunken white roughs murder them    at the polls, or intimidate them so that they do not vote. But the    better class of people must not be blamed for this, and a more    thoroughly American population than the Christian people of the South    does not exist. They have the traditions, the kindness, the probity, the    courage of our forefathers. The problem on their hands is immeasurable.    The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt. The grog-shop is    its center of power. 'The safety of woman, of childhood, of the home, is    menaced in a thousand localities at this moment, so that the men dare    not go beyond the sight of their own roof-tree.' How little we know of    all this, seated in comfort and affluence here at the North, descanting    upon the rights of every man to cast one vote and have it fairly    counted; that well-worn shibboleth invoked once more to dodge a living    issue.      \"The fact is that illiterate colored men will not vote at the South    until the white population chooses to have them do so; and under similar    conditions they would not at the North.\" Here we have Miss Willard's    words in full, condoning fraud, violence, murder, at the ballot box;    rapine, shooting, hanging and burning; for all these things are done and    being done now by the Southern white people. She does not stop there,    but goes a step further to aid them in blackening the good name of an    entire race, as shown by the sentences quoted in the paragraph above.    These utterances, for which the colored people have never forgiven Miss    Willard, and which Frederick Douglass has denounced as false, are to be    found in full in the Voice of October 23,1890, a temperance organ    published at New York City.    This letter appeared in the May number of _Fraternity_, the organ of the  first Anti-Lynching society of Great Britain. When Lady Henry Somerset  learned through Miss Florence Balgarnie that this letter had been  published she informed me that if the interview was published she would  take steps to let the public know that my statements must be received with  caution. As I had no money to pay the printer to suppress the edition  which was already published and these ladies did not care to do so, the  May number of _Fraternity_ was sent to its subscribers as usual. Three  days later there appeared in the daily _Westminster Gazette_ an  \"interview\" with Miss Willard, written by Lady Henry Somerset, which was  so subtly unjust in its wording that I was forced to reply in my own  defense. In that reply I made only statements which, like those concerning  Miss Willard's _Voice_ interview, have not been and cannot be denied. It  was as follows:      LADY HENRY SOMERSET'S INTERVIEW WITH MISS WILLARD      To the Editor of the _Westminster Gazette_: Sir--The interview published    in your columns today hardly merits a reply, because of the indifference    to suffering manifested. Two ladies are represented sitting under a tree    at Reigate, and, after some preliminary remarks on the terrible subject    of lynching, Miss Willard laughingly replies by cracking a joke. And the    concluding sentence of the interview shows the object is not to    determine how best they may help the Negro who is being hanged, shot and    burned, but \"to guard Miss Willard's reputation.\"      With me it is not myself nor my reputation, but the life of my people,    which is at stake, and I affirm that this is the first time to my    knowledge that Miss Willard has said a single word in denunciation of    lynching or demand for law. The year 1890, the one in which the    interview appears, had a larger lynching record than any previous year,    and the number and territory have increased, to say nothing of the human    beings burnt alive.

Two of the principles already discussed  are sufficient to explain most of the phenomena. These are, first,  that the subconscious is amenable to control by suggestion, and  secondly, that it is greatly influenced by emotion. Tracing back the  principles behind any example of the power of mind over body, one  finds at the root of the matter either a suggestion or an emotion, or  both. If, then, the stimulating and depressing effects of mental  states are to be understood, the first Step must be a fuller  understanding of the laws governing suggestion and emotion.      THE CONTAGION OF IDEAS    One of the most important points about the subconscious mind is its  openness to suggestion. It likes to believe what it is told and to act  accordingly. The conscious mind, too,--proud seat of reason though it  may be,--shares this habit of accepting ideas without demanding too  much proof of their truth. Even at his best, man is extremely  susceptible to the contagion of ideas. Most of us are even less immune  to this mental contagion than we are to colds or influenza; for ideas  are catching. They are such subtle, insinuating things that they creep  into our minds without our knowing it at all; and once there, they are  as powerful as most germs.    Let a person faint in a crowded room, and a good per cent. of the  women present will begin to fan themselves. The room has suddenly  become insufferably close. After we have read half a hundred times  that Ivory soap floats, a fair proportion of the population is likely  to be seized with desire for a soap that floats,--not because they  have any good reason for doing so, but simply because the suggestion  has \"taken.\" As for the harbingers of spring, they are neither the  birds nor the wild flowers, but the blooming windows of the  milliners, which successfully suggest in wintry February that summer  is coming, and that felt and fur are out of season. It is evident that  all advertising is suggestion.    The training of children, also, if it is done in the right way, is  largely a matter of suggestion. The little child who falls down and  bumps his head is very likely to cry if met with a sympathetic show of  concern, while the same child will often take his mishaps as a joke if  his elders meet them with a laugh or a diverting remark. Unlucky is  the child whose mother does not know, either consciously or  intuitively, that example and contagion are more powerful--and more  pleasant--than command and prohibition.    =Everything Suggestive.= Human beings are constantly communicating,  one to another. Sometimes they \"get over\" an idea by means of words,  but often they do it in more subtle ways,--by the elevation of an  eyelid, the gesture of a hand, composure of manner in a crisis, or a  laugh in a delicate situation. A suggestion is merely an idea passed  from one person to another, an idea that is accepted with conviction  and acted upon, even though there may be no logic, no reason, no proof  of its truth. It is an influence that takes hold of the mind and works  itself out to fulfilment, quite apart from its worth or  reasonableness. Of course, logical persuasion and argument have their  place in the communication of ideas; an idea may be conveyed by other  ways than suggestion. But while suggestion is not everything, it is  equally true that there is suggestion in everything. The doctor may  give a patient a very rational explanation of his case, but the  doubtful shake of the head or the encouraging look of his eye is quite  likely to color the patient's general impression. The eyes of our  subconscious are always open, and they are constantly getting  impressions, subtle suggestions that are implied rather than  expressed.    =Abnormal Suggestibility.= While everybody is suggestible, nervous  people are abnormally so. It may be, as McDougall suggests, that they  have so large an amount of submission or negative self-feeling in  their make-up that they believe anything, just because some one else  says it is true. Sometimes it is lack of knowledge that makes us  gullible, and at other times the cause of our suggestibility is  failure to use the knowledge that we have. Sometimes our ideas are  locked away in air-tight compartments with no interaction between  them. The psychologists tell us that suggestion is greatly favored by  a narrowing of the attention, a \"contraction of the field of  consciousness,\" a dissociation of other ideas through concentration.  This all simply means that we forget to let our common sense bring to  bear counter ideas that might challenge a false one; or that worry--a  veritable \"spasm of the attention\"--has fixed upon an idea to the  exclusion of all others; or that through fatigue or the dissociation  of sleep or hypnosis or hysteria, our reasoning powers have been  locked out and for the time being are unable to act.    It was through experiments on hypnotized subjects that scientists  first learned of the suggestibility of the subconscious mind. In  hypnosis a person can be made to believe almost anything and to do  almost anything compatible with the safety and the moral sense of the  individual. The instinct of self-preservation will not allow the most  deeply hypnotized person to do anything dangerous to himself; and the  moral complexes, laid in the subconscious, never permit a person to  perform in earnest an act of which the waking moral sense would  disapprove. Within these limits, a person in the dissociated hypnotic  state can be made to accept almost any suggestion. We found in the  last chapter how open to suggestion is a person in normal sleep. Of  the dissociation of hysteria we shall have occasion to speak in later  chapters. Although all these special states heighten suggestibility,  we must not forget how susceptible each of us is in his normal waking  state.    =Living Its Faith.= All this gathers meaning only when we realize that  ideas are dynamic. They always tend to work themselves out to  fulfilment. The subconscious no sooner gets a conviction than it tries  to act it out. Of course it can succeed only up to a certain limit.  If it believes the stomach to have cancer, it cannot make cancer, but  it can make the stomach misbehave. One of my patients, on hearing of a  case of brain-tumor immediately imagined this to be her trouble, and  developed a pain in her head. She could not manufacture a tumor, but  she could manufacture what she believed to be the symptoms.    There was another patient who was supposed to have brain-tumor. This  young woman seemed to have lost almost entirely the power to keep her  equilibrium in walking. Her center of gravity was never over her feet,  but away out in space, so that she was continually banging from one  side of the room to the other, only saving herself from injury by  catching at the wall or the furniture with her hands. Several  physicians who had been interested in the case had found the symptoms  strongly suggestive of brain-tumor. There were, however, certain  unmistakable earmarks of hysteria, such as childlike bland  indifference to the awkwardness of the gait which was a grotesque  caricature of several brain and spinal-cord diseases, with no accurate  picture of any single one. This was evidently a case, not of actual  loss of power but a dissociation of the memory-picture of walking. The  patient was a trained nurse and knew in a general way the symptoms of  brain-tumor. When the suggestion of brain-tumor had fixed itself in  her mind she was able subconsciously to manufacture what she believed  to be the symptoms of that disease.    By injecting a keen sense of disapprobation and skepticism into the  hitherto placidly accepted state of disability, by flashing a mirror  on the physical and moral attitudes which she was assuming, I was able  to rob the pathological complex of its (altogether unconscious)  pleasurable feeling-tone, and to restore to its former strength and  poise a personality of exceptional native worth and beauty. After a  few weeks at my house she was able to walk like a normal person and  went back to her work, for good.    We have already learned enough about the inner self to see in a faint  way how it works out its ideas. Since the subconscious mind runs the  bodily machinery, since it regulates digestion, the building up of  tissue, circulation, respiration, glandular secretion, muscular tonus,  and every other process pertaining to nutrition and growth, it is not  difficult to see how an idea about any of these matters can work  itself out into a fact. A thought can furnish the mental machinery  needed to fulfil the thought. Some one catches the suggestion:  \"Concentration is hard on the brain. It soon brings on brain-fag and  headache.\" Not knowing facts to the contrary, the suggestible mind  accepts the proposition. Then one day, after a little concentration,  the idea begins to work. Whereupon the autonomic nervous system  tightens up the blood-vessels that regulate the local blood supply,  too much blood stays in the head, and lo, it aches! The next time, the  suggestion comes with greater force, and soon the habit is  formed,--all the result of an idea. It is a good thing to remember  that constant thought about any part of the body never fails to send  an over-supply of blood to that part; of course that means congestion  and pain.    =Hands Off!= By sending messages directly to an organ through the  nerve-centers or by changing circulation, the subconscious director of  our bodies can make any part of us misbehave in a number of ways. All  it needs is a suggestion of an interfering thought about an organ. As  we have insisted before, the subconscious cannot stand interference.
