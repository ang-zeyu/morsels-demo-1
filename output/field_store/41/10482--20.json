However,  absolute equality is just as impossible, for absolute equality in  fortunes, honors, commerce, agriculture, industry, would end in a want of  comfort, in discouragement, in disorganization of the means of existence,  and in universal disappointment: the order of the community would be quite  destroyed. Thus, there is a great wisdom in the fact that equality is not  imposed by law: it is, therefore, preferable for moderation to do its  work. The main point is, by means of laws and regulations to hinder the  constitution of the excessive fortunes of certain individuals, and to  protect the essential needs of the masses. For instance, the manufacturers  and the industrials heap up a treasure each day, and the poor artisans do  not gain their daily sustenance: that is the height of iniquity, and no  just man can accept it. Therefore, laws and regulations should be  established which would permit the workmen to receive from the factory  owner their wages and a share in the fourth or the fifth part of the  profits, according to the wants of the factory; or in some other way the  body of workmen and the manufacturers should share equitably the profits  and advantages. Indeed, the direction and administration of affairs come  from the owner of the factory, and the work and labor, from the body of  the workmen. In other words, the workmen should receive wages which assure  them an adequate support, and when they cease work, becoming feeble or  helpless, they should receive from the owner of the factory a sufficient  pension. The wages should be high enough to satisfy the workmen with the  amount they receive, so that they may be able to put a little aside for  days of want and helplessness.    When matters will be thus fixed, the owner of the factory will no longer  put aside daily a treasure which he has absolutely no need of (without  taking into consideration that if the fortune is disproportionate, the  capitalist succumbs under a formidable burden, and gets into the greatest  difficulties and troubles; the administration of an excessive fortune is  very difficult, and exhausts man's natural strength). And, the workmen and  artisans will no longer be in the greatest misery and want, they will no  longer be submitted to the worst privations at the end of their life.    It is, then, clear and evident that the repartition of excessive fortunes  amongst a small number of individuals, while the masses are in misery, is  an iniquity and an injustice. In the same way, absolute equality would be  an obstacle to life, to welfare, to order and to the peace of humanity. In  such a question a just medium is preferable. It lies in the capitalists  being moderate in the acquisition of their profits, and in their having a  consideration for the welfare of the poor and needy; that is to say, that  the workmen and artisans receive a fixed and established daily wage, and  have a share in the general profits of the factory.    It would be well, with regard to the social rights of manufacturers,  workmen and artisans, that laws be established, giving moderate profits to  manufacturers, and to workmen the necessary means of existence and  security for the future. Thus, when they become feeble and cease working,  get old and helpless, and die leaving children under age, these children  will not be annihilated by excess of poverty. And it is from the income of  the factory itself, to which they have a right, that they will derive a  little of the means of existence.    In the same way, the workmen should no longer rebel and revolt, nor demand  beyond their rights; they should no longer go out on strike, they should  be obedient and submissive, and not ask for impudent wages. But the mutual  rights of both associated parties will be fixed and established according  to custom by just and impartial laws. In case one of the two parties  should transgress, the courts of justice would have to give judgment, and  by an efficacious fine put an end to the transgression; thus order will be  re-established, and the difficulties settled. The interference of courts  of justice and of the Government in difficulties pending between  manufacturers and workmen is legal, for the reason that current affairs  between workmen and manufacturers cannot be compared with ordinary affairs  between private persons, which do not concern the public, and with which  the Government should not occupy itself. In reality, although they appear  to be matters between private persons, these difficulties between patrons  and workmen produce a general detriment; for commerce, industry,  agriculture and the general affairs of the country are all intimately  linked together. If one of these suffers an abuse, the detriment affects  the mass. Thus the difficulties between workmen and manufacturers become a  cause of general detriment.    The court of justice and the Government have therefore the right of  interference. When a difficulty occurs between two individuals with  reference to private rights, it is necessary for a third to settle the  question: this is the part of the Government: then the question of  strikes--which cause troubles in the country and are often connected with  the excessive vexations of the workmen, as well as with the rapacity of  manufacturers--how could it remain neglected?    Good God! is it possible that, seeing one of his fellow-creatures  starving, destitute of everything, a man can rest and live comfortably in  his luxurious mansion? He who meets another in the greatest misery, can he  enjoy his fortune? That is why, in the religion of God, it is prescribed  and established that wealthy men each year give over a certain part of  their fortune for the maintenance of the poor and unfortunate. That is the  foundation of the religion of God, and the most essential of the  commandments.    As now man is not forced nor obliged by the Government, if by the natural  tendency of his good heart, with the greatest spirituality, he goes to  this expense for the poor, this will be a thing very much praised,  approved and pleasing.    Such is the meaning of the good works in the Divine Books and Tablets.          UNIVERSAL PEACE      This recent war has proved to the world and the people that war is  destruction while Universal Peace is construction; war is death while  peace is life; war is rapacity and bloodthirstiness while peace is  beneficence and humaneness; war is an appurtenance of the world of nature  while peace is of the foundation of the religion of God; war is darkness  upon darkness while peace is heavenly light; war is the destroyer of the  edifice of mankind while peace is the everlasting life of the world of  humanity; war is like a devouring wolf while peace is like the angels of  heaven; war is the struggle for existence while peace is mutual aid and  cooperation among the peoples of the world and the cause of the  good-pleasure of the True One in the heavenly realm.    There is not one soul whose conscience does not testify that in this day  there is no more important matter in the world than that of Universal  Peace. Every just one bears witness to this and adores that esteemed  Assembly because its aim is that this darkness may be changed into light,  this bloodthirstiness into kindness, this torment into bliss, this  hardship into ease and this enmity and hatred into fellowship and love.  Therefore, the effort of those esteemed souls is worthy of praise and  commendation.    But the wise souls who are aware of the essential relationships emanating  from the realities of things consider that one single matter cannot, by  itself, influence the human reality as it ought and should, for until the  minds of men become united, no important matter can be accomplished. At  present Universal Peace is a matter of great importance, but unity of  conscience is essential, so that the foundation of this matter may become  secure, its establishment firm and its edifice strong.    Therefore His Holiness Baha'u'llah, fifty years ago, expounded this  question of Universal Peace at a time when He was confined in the fortress  of Akka and was wronged and imprisoned. He wrote about this important  matter of Universal Peace to all the great sovereigns of the world, and  established it among His friends in the Orient. The horizon of the East  was in utter darkness, nations displayed the utmost hatred and enmity  towards each other, religions thirsted for each other's blood, and it was  darkness upon darkness. At such a time His Holiness Baha'u'llah shone  forth like the sun from the horizon of the East and illumined Iran with  the lights of these teachings.    Among His teachings was the declaration of Universal Peace. People of  different nations, religions and sects who followed Him came together to  such an extent that remarkable gatherings were instituted consisting of  the various nations and religions of the East. Every soul who entered  these gatherings saw but one nation, one teaching, one pathway, one order,  for the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah were not limited to the  establishment of Universal Peace. They embraced many teachings which  supplemented and supported that of Universal Peace.    Among these teachings was the independent investigation of reality so that  the world of humanity may be saved from the darkness of imitation and  attain to the truth; may tear off and cast away this ragged and outgrown  garment of 1,000 years ago and may put on the robe woven in the utmost  purity and holiness in the loom of reality. As reality is one and cannot  admit of multiplicity, therefore different opinions must ultimately become  fused into one.    And among the teachings of His Holiness Baha'u'llah is the oneness of the  world of humanity; that all human beings are the sheep of God and He is  the kind Shepherd. This Shepherd is kind to all the sheep, because He  created "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19240"],[0,"Bahá'í Prayers (#17)"],[1,"and joyful being. O  God! I will no longer be full of anxiety, nor will I let trouble harass  me. I will not dwell on the unpleasant things of life.    O God! Thou art more friend to me than I am to myself. I dedicate myself  to Thee, O Lord.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O my God! O my God! Glory be unto Thee...\"      O my God! O my God! Glory be unto Thee for that Thou hast confirmed me to  the confession of Thy oneness, attracted me unto the word of Thy  singleness, enkindled me by the fire of Thy love, and occupied me with Thy  mention and the service of Thy friends and maidservants.    O Lord, help me to be meek and lowly, and strengthen me in severing myself  from all things and in holding to the hem of the garment of Thy glory, so  that my heart may be filled with Thy love and leave no space for love of  the world and attachment to its qualities.    O God! Sanctify me from all else save Thee, purge me from the dross of  sins and transgressions, and cause me to possess a spiritual heart and  conscience.    Verily, Thou art merciful and, verily, Thou art the Most Generous, Whose  help is sought by all men.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O my Lord! O my Lord! This is a lamp lighted...\"      O my Lord! O my Lord! This is a lamp lighted by the fire of Thy love and  ablaze with the flame which is ignited in the tree of Thy mercy. O my  Lord! Increase his enkindlement, heat and flame, with the fire which is  kindled in the Sinai of Thy Manifestation. Verily, Thou art the Confirmer,  the Assister, the Powerful, the Generous, the Loving.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O my God! O my God! This, Thy servant,...\"      O my God! O my God! This, Thy servant, hath advanced towards Thee, is  passionately wandering in the desert of Thy love, walking in the path of  Thy service, anticipating Thy favors, hoping for Thy bounty, relying upon  Thy kingdom, and intoxicated by the wine of Thy gift. O my God! Increase  the fervor of his affection for Thee, the constancy of his praise of Thee,  and the ardor of his love for Thee.    Verily, Thou art the Most Generous, the Lord of grace abounding. There is  no other God but Thee, the Forgiving, the Merciful.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O God, my God! This is Thy radiant servant,...\"      O God, my God! This is Thy radiant servant, Thy spiritual thrall, who hath  drawn nigh unto Thee and approached Thy presence. He hath turned his face  unto Thine, acknowledging Thy oneness, confessing Thy singleness, and he  hath called out in Thy name among the nations, and led the people to the  streaming waters of Thy mercy, O Thou Most generous Lord! To those who  asked He hath given to drink from the cup of guidance that brimmeth over  with the wine of Thy measureless grace.    O Lord, assist him under all conditions, cause him to learn Thy  well-guarded mysteries, and shower down upon him Thy hidden pearls. Make  of him a banner rippling from castle summits in the winds of Thy heavenly  aid, make of him a wellspring of crystal waters.    O my forgiving Lord! Light up the hearts with the rays of a lamp that  sheddeth abroad its beams, disclosing to those among Thy people whom Thou  hast bounteously favored, the realities of all things.    Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, the Protector, the Strong, the  Beneficent! Verily, Thou art the Lord of all mercies!    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O God, my God! These are Thy feeble servants;...\"      O God, my God! These are Thy feeble servants; they are Thy loyal bondsmen  and Thy handmaidens, who have bowed themselves down before Thine exalted  Utterance and humbled themselves at Thy Threshold of light, and borne  witness to Thy oneness through which the Sun hath been made to shine in  midday splendor. They have listened to the summons Thou didst raise from  out Thy hidden Realm, and with hearts quivering with love and rapture,  they have responded to Thy call.    O Lord, shower upon them all the outpourings of Thy mercy, rain down upon  them all the waters of Thy grace. Make them to grow as beauteous plants in  the garden of heaven, and from the full and brimming clouds of Thy  bestowals and out of the deep pools of Thine abounding grace make Thou  this garden to flower, and keep it ever green and lustrous, ever fresh and  shimmering and fair.    Thou art, verily, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Powerful, He Who alone, in  the heavens and on the earth, abideth unchanged. There is none other God  save Thee, the Lord of manifest tokens and signs.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"He is God!...\"      He is God!    O God, my God! These are servants attracted in Thy days by the fragrances  of Thy holiness, enkindled with the flame burning in Thy holy tree,  responding to Thy voice, uttering Thy praise, awakened by Thy breeze,  stirred by Thy sweet savors, beholding Thy signs, understanding Thy  verses, hearkening to Thy words, believing Thy Revelation and assured of  Thy loving-kindness. Their eyes, O Lord, are fixed upon Thy kingdom of  effulgent glory and their faces turned toward Thy dominion on high, their  hearts beating with the love of Thy radiant and glorious beauty, their  souls consumed with the flame of Thy love, O Lord of this world and the  world hereafter, their lives seething with the ardor of their longing for  Thee, and their tears poured forth for Thy sake.    Shield them within the stronghold of Thy protection and safety, preserve  them in Thy watchful care, look upon them with the eyes of Thy providence  and mercy, make them the signs of Thy divine unity that are manifest  throughout all regions, the standards of Thy might that wave above Thy  mansions of grandeur, the shining lamps that burn with the oil of Thy  wisdom in the globes of Thy guidance, the birds of the garden of Thy  knowledge that warble upon the topmost boughs in Thy sheltering paradise,  and the leviathans of the ocean of Thy bounty that plunge by Thy supreme  mercy in the fathomless deeps.    O Lord, my God! Lowly are these servants of Thine, exalt them in Thy  kingdom on high; feeble, strengthen them by Thy supreme power; abased,  bestow upon them Thy glory in Thine all-highest realm; poor, enrich them  in Thy great dominion. Do Thou then ordain for them all the good Thou hast  destined in Thy worlds, visible and invisible, prosper them in this world  below, gladden their hearts with Thine inspiration, O Lord of all beings!  Illumine their hearts with Thy joyful tidings diffused from Thine  all-glorious Station, make firm their steps in Thy Most Great Covenant and  strengthen their loins in Thy firm Testament, by Thy bounty and promised  grace, O Gracious and Merciful One! Thou art, verily, the Gracious, the  All-Bountiful.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O Thou Provider! Thou hast breathed over...\"      O Thou Provider! Thou hast breathed over the friends in the West the sweet  fragrance of the Holy Spirit, and with the light of divine guidance Thou  hast lit up the western sky. Thou hast made those who were once remote to  draw near unto Thyself; Thou hast turned strangers into loving friends;  Thou hast awakened those who slept; Thou hast made the heedless mindful.    O Thou Provider! Assist Thou these noble friends to win Thy good pleasure,  and make them well wishers of stranger and friend alike. Bring them into  the world that abideth forever; grant them a portion of heavenly grace;  cause them to be true Baha'is, sincerely of God; save them from outward  semblances, and establish them firmly in the truth. Make them signs and  tokens of the Kingdom, luminous stars above the horizons of this nether  life. Make them to be a comfort and a solace to humankind and servants to  the peace of the world. Exhilarate them with the wine of Thy counsel, and  grant that all of them may tread the path of Thy commandments.    O Thou Provider! The dearest wish of this servant of Thy Threshold is to  behold the friends of East and West in close embrace; to see all the  members of human society gathered with love in a single great assemblage,  even as individual drops of water collected in one mighty sea; to behold  them all as birds in one garden of roses, as pearls of one ocean, as  leaves of one tree, as rays of one sun.    Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful, and Thou art the God of strength, the  Omnipotent, the All-Seeing.    --'Abdu'l-Baha          STEADFASTNESS        \"Glorified be Thy name, O Lord my God! I beseech...\"      Glorified be Thy name, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Thy power that  hath encompassed all created things, and by Thy Sovereignty that hath  transcended the entire creation, and by Thy Word which was hidden in Thy  wisdom and whereby Thou didst create Thy heaven and Thy earth, both to  enable us to be steadfast in our love for Thee and in our obedience to Thy  pleasure, and to fix our gaze upon Thy face, and celebrate Thy glory.  Empower us, then, O my God, to spread abroad Thy signs among Thy  creatures, and to guard Thy Faith in Thy realm. Thou hast ever existed  independently of the mention of any of Thy creatures, and wilt remain as  Thou hast been for ever and ever.    In Thee I have placed my whole confidence, unto Thee I have turned my  face, to the cord of Thy loving providence I have clung, and towards the  shadow of Thy mercy I have hastened. Cast me not as one disappointed out  of Thy door, O my God, and withhold not from me Thy grace, for Thee alone  do I seek. No God is there beside Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most  Bountiful.

I beseech Thee by Thy Name,  through which Thou hast enabled them that have recognized Thee to soar to  the sublimest heights "]]]
