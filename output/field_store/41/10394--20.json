[Illustration: 108a.jpg WOODEN HEAD-REST]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a head-rest in my possession       obtained at Gebelen (XIth dynasty): the foot of the head-       rest is usually solid, and cut out of a single piece of       wood.    [Illustration: 108b.jpg PIGEON ON WHEELS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by Petrie, _Hawara,       Biahmu, and Arsinoe_, pl. xiii. 21. The original, of rough       wood, is now in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.    The family crowded themselves together into two or three rooms in  winter, and slept on the roof in the open air in summer, in spite of  risk from affections of the stomach and eyes; the remainder of the  dwelling was used for stables or warehouses. The store-chambers  were often built in pairs; they were of brick, carefully limewashed  internally, and usually assumed the form of an elongated cone, in  imitation of the Government storehouses. For the valuables which  constituted the wealth of each household--wedges of gold or silver,  precious stones, ornaments for men or women--there were places of  concealment, in which the possessors attempted to hide them from robbers  or from the tax-collectors. But the latter, accustomed to the craft of  the citizens, evinced a peculiar aptitude for ferreting out the hoard:  they tapped the walls, lifted and pierced the roofs, dug down into the  soil below the foundations, and often brought to light, not only the  treasure of the owner, but all the surroundings of the grave and human  corruption. It was actually the custom, among the lower and middle  classes, to bury in the middle of the house children who had died at the  breast. The little body was placed in an old tool or linen box, without  any attempt at embalming, and its favourite playthings and amulets were  buried with it: two or three infants are often found occupying the same  coffin. The playthings were of an artless but very varied character;  dolls of limestone, enamelled pottery or wood, with movable arms and  wigs of artificial hair; pigs, crocodiles, ducks, and pigeons on wheels,  pottery boats, miniature sets of household furniture, skin balls filled  with hay, marbles, and stone bowls. However, strange it may appear, we  have to fancy the small boys of ancient Egypt as playing at bowls  like ours, or impudently whipping their tops along the streets without  respect for the legs of the passers-by.    [Illustration: 109.jpg APPARATUS FOR STRIKING A LIGHT]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch published in Fl.       Petrie, _Illahun, Kdhun and Gurob,_ pl. vii. The bow is       represented in the centre; on the left, at the top, is the       nut; below it the fire-stick, which was attached to the end       of the stock; at the bottom and right, two pieces of wood       with round carbonized holes, which took fire from the       friction of the rapidly rotating stick.    Some care was employed upon the decoration of the chambers. The  rough-casting of mud often preserves its original grey colour;  sometimes, however, it was limewashed, and coloured red or yellow, or  decorated with pictures of jars, provisions, and the interiors as well  as the exteriors of houses.    [Illustration: 110.jpg MITRAL PAINTINGS IN THE RUINS OF AN ANCIENT HOUSE  AT KAHUN]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the facsimile in Petrie's       _Illahun, Kahun and Gurob_, pl. xvi. 6.    The bed was not on legs, but consisted of a low framework, like the  \"angarebs\" of the modern Nubians, or of mats which were folded up in the  daytime, but upon which they lay in their clothes during the night, the  head being supported by a head-rest of pottery, limestone, or wood: the  remaining articles of furniture consisted of one or two roughly hewn  seats of stone, a few lion-legged chairs or stools, boxes and trunks  of varying sizes for linen and implements, kohl, or perfume, pots of  ababaster or porcelain, and lastly, the fire-stick with the bow by which  it was set in motion, and some roughly made pots and pans of clay or  bronze.    [Illustration: 111.jpg WOMAN GRINDING GRAIN]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Bechard (cf.       Mariette, _Alburn photographique du Musee de Boulaq_, pl.       20; Maspero, _Guide du Visiteur_, P- 220, Nos. 1012, 1013).    Men rarely entered their houses except to eat and sleep; their  employments or handicrafts were such as to require them for the most  part to work out-of-doors. The middle-class families owned, almost  always, one or two slaves--either purchased or born in the house--who  did all the hard work: they looked after the cattle, watched over the  children, acted as cooks, and fetched water from the nearest pool or  well. Among the poor the drudgery of the household fell entirely upon  the woman. She spun, wove, cut out and mended garments, fetched fresh  water and provisions, cooked the dinner, and made the daily bread. She  spread some handfuls of grain upon an oblong slab of stone, slightly  hollowed on its upper surface, and proceeded to crush them with a  smaller stone like a painter's muller, which she moistened from time to  time. For an hour and more she laboured with her arms, shoulders, loins,  in fact, all her body; but an indifferent result followed from the great  exertion. The flour, made to undergo several grindings in this rustic  mortar, was coarse, uneven, mixed with bran, or whole grains, which had  escaped the pestle, and contaminated with dust and abraded particles  of the stone. She kneaded it with a little water, blended with it, as a  sort of yeast, a piece of stale dough of the day before, and made from  the mass round cakes, about half an inch thick and some four inches in  diameter, which she placed upon a flat flint, covering them with hot  ashes. The bread, imperfectly raised, often badly cooked, borrowed, from  the organic fuel under which it was buried, a special odour, and a taste  to which strangers did not readily accustom themselves. The impurities  which it contained were sufficient in the long run to ruin the strongest  teeth; eating it was an action of grinding rather than chewing, and old  men were not unfrequently met with whose teeth had been gradually worn  away to the level of the gums, like those of an aged ass or ox.*         * The description of the woman grinding grain and kneading       dough is founded on statues in the Gizeh Museum. All the       European museums possess numerous specimens of the bread in       question, and the effect which it produces in the long run       on the teeth of those who habitually used it as an article       of diet, has been observed in mummies of the most important       personages.    Movement and animation were not lacking at certain hours of the day,  particularly during the morning, in the markets and in the neighbourhood  of the temples and government buildings: there was but little traffic  anywhere else; the streets were silent, and the town dull and sleepy. It  woke up completely only three or four times a year, at seasons of solemn  assemblies \"of heaven and earth:\" the houses were then opened and their  inhabitants streamed forth, the lively crowd thronging the squares and  crossways. To begin with, there was New Year's Day, quickly followed  by the Festival of the Bead, the \"Uagait.\" On the night of the 17th  of Thot, the priests kindled before the statues in the sanctuaries and  sepulchral chapels, the fire for the use of the gods and doubles during  the twelve ensuing months. Almost at the same moment the whole country  was lit up from one end to the other: there was scarcely a family,  however poor, who did not place in front of their door a new lamp in  which burned an oil saturated with salt, and who did not spend the whole  night in feasting and gossiping.*         * The night of the 17th Thot--which, according to our       computation, would be the night of the 16th to the 17th       --was, as may be seen from the Great Inscription of Siut,       appointed for the ceremony of \"lighting the fire\" before the       statues of the dead and of the gods. As at the \"Feast of       Lamps\"        The festivals of the living gods attracted considerable crowds, who  came not only from the nearest nomes, but also from great distances in  caravans and in boats laden with merchandise, for religious sentiment  did not exclude commercial interests, and the pilgrimage ended in a  fair.    [Illustration: 114.jpg TWO WOMEN WEAVING LINEN AT A HORIZANTAL LOOM]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a picture on the tomb of Khnum-       hotpu at Beni-Hasan. This is the loom which was       reconstructed in 1889 for the Paris Exhibition, and which is       now to be seen in the galleries of the Trocadero.    For several days the people occupied mentioned by Herodotus, the  religious ceremony was accompanied by a general illumination which  lasted all the night; the object of this, probably, was to facilitate  the visit which the souls of the dead were supposed to pay at this time  to the family residence themselves solely in prayers, sacrifices, and  processions, in which the faithful, clad in white, with palms in their  hands, chanted hymns as they escorted the priests on their way. \"The  gods of heaven exclaim 'Ah! ah! 'in satisfaction, the inhabitants of  the earth are full of gladness, the Hathors beat their tabors, the great  ladies wave their mystic whips, all those who are gathered together in  the town are drunk with wine and crowned with flowers; the tradespeople  of the place walk joyously about, their heads scented with perfumed  oils, all the children rejoice in honour of the goddess, from the rising  to the setting of the sun.\"*         * The people of Dendera crudely enough called this the    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17323"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 3 (of 12) (#17)"],[1,"the contour of his shoulder, and his hands       holding the reins. It is a large stele of close-grained       white limestone, rounded at the top, and covered with scenes       and inscriptions on both its faces. One of these faces       treats only of religious subjects. Two warlike goddesses,       crowned with plumed head-dresses and crescent-shaped horns,       are placed before a heap of weapons and various other       objects, which probably represent some of the booty       collected in the campaign. It would appear that they       accompany a tall figure of a god or king, possibly that of       the deity Ningirsu, patron of Lagash and its kings. Ningirsu       raises in one hand an ensign, of which the staff bears at       the top the royal totem, the eagle with outspread wings       laying hold by his talons of two half-lions back to back;       with the other hand he brings a, club down heavily upon a       group of prisoners, who struggle at his feet in the meshes       of a large net.      [Illustration: 103.jpg Page image. VULTURES FEEDING UPON THE DEAD.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the fragment of a bas-relief in       the Louvre. This is the human sacrifice after the victory,       such as we find it in Egypt--the offering to the national       god of a tenth of the captives, who struggle in vain to       escape from fate. On the other stele the battle is at its       height. Idingiranagin, standing upright in his chariot,       which is guided by an attendant, charges the enemy at the       head of his troops, and the plain is covered with corpses       cut down by his fierce blows: a flock of vultures accompany       him, and peck at each other in their struggles over the       arms, legs, and decapitated heads of the vanquished. Victory       once secured, he retraces his steps to bestow funeral       honours upon the dead.      [Illustration: 104.jpg PILING UP THE MOUND OF THE DEAD AFTER THE  BATTLE.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the fragment of a bas-relief in       the Louvre. The bodies raised regularly in layers form an       enormous heap: priests or soldiers wearing loin-cloths mount       to its top, where they pile the offerings and the earth       which are to form the funerary mound. The sovereign,       moreover, has, in honour of the dead, consigned to execution       some of the prisoners, and deigns to kill with his own hand       one of the principal chiefs of the enemy.    The design and execution of these scenes are singularly rude; men and  beasts--indeed, all the figures--have exaggerated proportions, uncouth  forms, awkward positions, and an uncertain and heavy gait. The war ended  in a treaty concluded with Enakalli, vicegerent of Grishban, by which  Lagash obtained considerable advantages. Idingiranagin replaced the  stele of Meshilim, overthrown by one of Enakalli's predecessors, and  dug a ditch from the Euphrates to the provinces of Guedln to serve  henceforth as a boundary. He further levied a tribute of corn for the  benefit of the goddess Nina and her consort Ningirsu, and applied  the spoils of the campaign to the building of new sanctuaries for the  patron-gods of his city.    [Illustration: 105.jpg KING URNINA AND HIS FAMILY.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief in the Louvre. Cf.       another bas-relief of the same king, p. 244; and for the       probable explanation of these pierced plaques, see p. 258 of       the present work.    His reign was, on the whole, a glorious and successful one. He conquered  the mountain district of Elam, rescued Uruk and Uru, which had both  fallen into the hands of the people of Gishban, organized an expedition  against the town of Az and killed its vicegerent, in addition to which  he burnt Arsua, and devastated the district of Mishime. He next directed  an attack against Zuran, king of Udban, and, by vanquishing this Prince  on the field of battle, he extended his dominion over nearly the whole  of Babylonia.    The prosperity of his dynasty was subjected to numerous and strange  vicissitudes. Whether it was that its resources were too feeble to  stand the exigencies and strain of war for any length of time, or that  intestine strife had been the chief cause of its decline, we cannot  say. Its kings married many wives and became surrounded with a numerous  progeny: Urnina had at least four sons. They often entrusted to their  children or their sons-in-law the government of the small towns which  together made up the city: these represented so many temporary fiefs, of  which the holders were distinguished by the title of \"vicegerents.\" This  dismemberment of the supreme authority in the interest of princes, who  believed for the most part that they had stronger claims to the throne  than its occupant, was attended with dangers to peace and to the  permanence of the dynasty. The texts furnish us with evidence of the  existence of at least half a dozen descendants of Akurgal--Inannatuma  I., Intemena, his grandson Inannatuma II, all of whom seem to have been  vigorous rulers who energetically maintained the supremacy of their city  over the neighbouring estates. Inannatuma I., however, proved no match  in the end against Urlamma, the vicegerent of Gishban, and lost part, at  least, of the territory acquired by Idingiranagin, but his son Intemena  defeated Urlamma on the banks of the Lumasirta Canal, and, having killed  or deposed him, gave the vicegerency of Gishban to a certain Hi, priest  of Ninab, who remained his loyal vassal to the end of his days. With  his aid Intemena restored the stelae and walls which had been destroyed  during the war; he also cleared out the old canals and dug new ones, the  most important of which was apparently an arm of the Shatt-el-Hai, and  ran from the Euphrates to the Tigris, through the very centre of the  domains of Ghirsu.    Other kings and vicegerents of doubtful sequence were followed lastly by  Urbau and his son Gudea. These were all piously devoted to Ningirsu in  general, and in particular to the patron of their choice from among  the divinities of the country--Papsukal, Dunziranna, and Ninagal. They  restored and enriched the temples of these gods: they dedicated to  them statues or oblation vases for the welfare of themselves and their  families. It would seem, if we are to trust the accounts which they give  of themselves, that their lives were passed in profound peace, without  other care than that of fulfilling their duties to heaven and its  ministers. Their actual condition, if we could examine it, would  doubtless appear less agreeable and especially less equable; revolutions  in the palace would not be wanting, nor struggles with the other peoples  of Chaldaea, with Susiana and even more distant nations. When Agade rose  into power in Northern Babylonia, they fell under its rule, and one of  them, Lugal-ushum-gal, acknowledged himself a dependant of Sargon. On  the decline of Agade, and when that city was superseded by Uru in the  hegemony of Babylonia proper, the vicegerents of Lagash were transferred  with the other great towns to the jurisdiction of Uru, and flourished  under the supremacy of the new dynasty.    Grudea, son of Urbau, who, if not the most powerful of its princes,  is at least the sovereign of whom we possess the greatest number of  monuments, captured the town of Anshan in Elam, and this is probably not  the only campaign in which he took part, for he speaks of his success  in an incidental manner, and as if he were in a hurry to pass to more  interesting subjects.    [Illustration: 108.jpg THE SACRIFICE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a stone in the Louvre.    That which seemed to him important in his reign, and which especially  called forth the recognition of posterity, was the number of his pious  foundations, distinguished as they were by beauty and magnificence. The  gods themselves had inspired him in his devout undertakings, and had  even revealed to him the plans which he was to carry out. An old man of  venerable aspect appeared to him in a vision, and commanded him to build  a temple: as he did not know with whom he had to do, Nina his mother  informed him that it was his brother, the god Ningirsu. This having been  made clear, a young woman furnished with style and writing tablet was  presented to him--Nisaba, the sister of Nina; she made a drawing in his  presence, and put before him the complete model of a building. He set  to work on it _con amore_, and sent for materials to the most distant  countries--to Magan, Amanus, the Lebanon, and into the mountains which  separate the valley of the Upper Tigris from that of the Euphrates.    [Illustration: 109.jpg SITTING STATUE OF GUDEA]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin    The sanctuaries which he decorated, and of which he felt so proud, are  to-day mere heaps of bricks, now returned to their original clay; but  many of the objects which he placed in them, and especially the statues,  have traversed the centuries without serious damage before finding a  resting-place in the Louvre. The sculptors of Lagash, after the time of  Idingi-ranagin, had been instructed in a good school, and had learned  their business. Their bas-reliefs are not so good as those of Naramsin;  the execution of them is not so refined, the drawing less delicate, and  the modelling of the parts not so well thought out. A good illustration  of their work is the fragment of a square stele which represents a scene  of offering or sacrifice. We see in the lower part of the picture a  female singer, who is accompanied by a musician, playing on a lyre  ornamented with the head of an ox, and a bull in the act of walking.  In the upper part an individual advances, clad in a fringed mantle, and  bearing in his right hand a kind of round paten, and in his left a short  staff.
