He hadn't gone very far before he heard a loud \"Honk-honk!\" in the bushes.    \"Oh, there is another one of those terrible automobiles!\" thought the  rabbit. But it wasn't at all. No, it was Grandfather Goosey Gander, and  there he sat on a flat stone, \"honk-honking\" through his yellow bill as  hard as he could, and, at the same time crying salty tears that ran down  his nose, making it all wet.    \"Why, whatever is the matter?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, as he went up to his  friend, the duck-drake gentleman. \"Have you stepped on a tack, too?\"    \"No, it isn't that,\" was the answer. \"But I am so sick that I don't know  what to do, and I'm far from my home, and from my friends, the  Wibblewobble family, and, oh, dear! it's just awful.\"    \"Let me look at your tongue,\" said the rabbit, and when Grandfather Goosey  Gander stuck it out, Uncle Wiggily said:    \"Why, you have the epizootic very bad. Very bad, indeed! But perhaps I can  cure you. Let me see, I think you need some bread and butter, and a cup of  catnip tea. I'll make you some.\"    So Uncle Wiggily made a little fire of sticks, and then he found an empty  tin tomato can, and he boiled some water in it over the fire, and made the  catnip tea. Then he gave some to Grandfather Goosey Gander, together with  some bread and butter.    \"Well, I feel a little better,\" said the old gentleman duck-drake, when he  had eaten, \"but I am not well yet. It seems to me that if I could have  some cherry pie I would feel better.\"    \"Perhaps you would,\" agreed Uncle Wiggily, \"but, though I know how to make  nice cherry pie, and though I made some for the hedgehog, I don't see any  cherry trees around here, so I can't make you one. There are no cherry  trees.\"    \"Yes, there is one over there,\" said the duck-drake, and he waved one foot  toward it, while he quacked real faint and sorrowful-like.    \"Sure enough, that _is_ a cherry tree,\" said Uncle Wiggily, as he hopped  over and looked at it. \"And the cherries are ripe, too. Now, if I could  only get some of them down I could make a cherry pie, and cure Grandfather  Goosey Gander.\"    But it wasn't easy to get the cherries off the tree, and Uncle Wiggily  couldn't climb up after them. So he sat down and looked up at them, hoping  some would fall off the stems. But none did.    \"Oh, dear, I wonder how I'm going to get them?\" sighed the rabbit.  \"Perhaps I can knock off some with a stone.\"    So he threw a stone, but no cherries came down. The stone did, though,  and hit Uncle Wiggily on the nose, making him sneeze.    \"Stones are no good!\" exclaimed the rabbit. \"I'll throw up my crutch.\" So  he threw that into the tree, but it brought no cherries down, and the  crutch, in falling, nearly hit Grandfather Goosey Gander, and almost gave  him the measles and mumps.    \"Well, I'll try and see what throwing up my valise will do,\" said the  rabbit, and he tossed up the satchel, but bless you, that stayed up in the  tree, and didn't come down at all, neither did any cherries.    \"Oh, I'll have to give up,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"I'm afraid you can't have  any cherry pie, Grandfather Goosey.\"    \"Oh, then I'll never get well,\" said the old duck-drake gentleman  sorrowfully.    \"Yes, you will, too!\" suddenly cried out a voice, and out from the bushes  ran the elephant. \"I'll pick the cherries off the tree with my long, nosey  trunk,\" he said, \"and you can make all the pie you want to, Uncle  Wiggily.\"    \"Why, I thought you went back to the circus,\" said the rabbit.    \"No, I ran away from the man,\" spoke the elephant. Then he reached up with  his long nose, and he picked a bushel of red, ripe, sweet delicious  cherries in less than a minute. Then he pulled down Uncle Wiggily's  valise out of the tree and then the old gentleman rabbit made three cherry  pies. One for Grandfather Goosey Gander, and another, a tremendous big  one, as large as a washtub, for the elephant, and a little one for  himself. Then they ate their pies, and the old gentleman duck-drake got  well almost at once. So all three of them traveled on together, to help  the rabbit seek his fortune.    Now in case the ice cream man brings some nice, hot roast chestnuts for  our canary bird, I'll tell you in another story about Uncle Wiggily, and  Grandfather Goosey Gander.          STORY XXV    UNCLE WIGGILY AND GRANDPA GOOSEY      One day, not very long after the elephant had picked the cherries off the  tree, so that Uncle Wiggily could make the cherry pies for Grandpa Goosey,  the three friends were traveling along together through a deep, dark,  dismal woods.    \"Where are we going?\" asked the elephant, who had run away from the circus  man to travel by himself.    \"Oh, to some place where we may find our fortune,\" said the old gentleman  rabbit.    \"I would much rather find some snails to eat,\" said Grandfather Goosey  Gander, the old gentleman duck, as I shall call him for short. \"For I am  very hungry.\"    \"What's that?\" cried the rabbit. \"Hungry after the nice pie I made for  you?\"    \"Oh, that was some time ago. I could eat another pie right now,\" spoke the  old duck. But there wasn't any pie for him, so he had to eat a cornmeal  sandwich with watercress salad on, and Uncle Wiggily ate some carrots and  cabbage, and the elephant ate a lot of grass from a field--oh! a terrible  lot--about ten bushels, I guess.    Then, all at once, as they were walking along over a bridge, a man  suddenly jumped out from behind a tree, and cried:    \"Ah, ha! Now you won't get away from me, Mr. Elephant. This time I am  surely going to take you back to the circus.\" And with that he threw a  rope around the elephant's trunk, and led him away. The elephant cried so  many tears that there was a muddy puddle right near the bridge, and the  big animal begged to be allowed to stay with Uncle Wiggily and Grandpa  Goosey Gander, but the man said it could not be done.    \"Well, then, you and I will have to go on together,\" said the old  gentleman rabbit to the duck, after a bit. \"Perhaps we may find our  fortune.\"    \"I think I could make money calling out 'honk-honk!' on an automobile,\"  said the grandfather. \"Jimmie Wibblewobble once did that for a man. I  think I'll look for a nice automobile gentleman to work for, and if I get  money enough we'll be rich.\"    Well, he looked and looked, but no one seemed to want an old duck for an  auto horn, and the rabbit and Grandfather Goosey Gander kept on traveling  together, over the fields and through the woods.    Pretty soon they came to a place where a June bug was sitting on the edge  of a stone wall, buzzing his wings.    \"Let's ask him where we can find our fortunes,\" said Uncle Wiggily. So  they asked the June bug.    \"Well,\" replied the buzzing creature, \"I am not sure, but a little way  from here are two roads. One or the other might bring you to your fortune.  One goes to the right, the other to the left hand.\"    \"We will take the left hand road,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"We will go down  that for some distance, and if we do not find a pot of gold, or some ice  cream cones at the end of it, we will come back, and try the other road.\"    So Uncle Wiggily and Grandfather Goosey Gander went down the left road. On  and on they went, walking in the dust when there was any dust, and in the  mud when there was any mud. But they didn't find any gold.    \"Oh, let's go back and try the other road,\" said the rabbit gentleman  after a bit. \"Perhaps that will be better.\"    So back they went, stopping on the way to look at a big apple tree, to see  if there were any ripe apples on it. But there was none, so they didn't  eat any. And I hope you children do the same this summer. Never eat green  apples, never, never, never! Wait until they are ripe.    Well, by and by, after a while, not so very long, Uncle Wiggily, who was  hopping along on his crutch, suddenly exclaimed:    \"Oh, I've lost my valise! What shall I do? I can't go on without it, for  it has our lunch in it.\"    \"I think you left it under the green-apple tree,\" said the duck. \"You had  better go back for it, and I will wait here in the shade,\" for Grandpa  Goosey knew the rabbit could hop faster than he could waddle.    Back Uncle Wiggily started, and, surely enough, he found his valise under  the apple tree, where he had forgotten it. He picked it up, and was  walking along with it back to where Grandfather Goosey Gander was waiting  for him when, all of a sudden, out from behind a stump came Jennie  Chipmunk, with a basket of popcorn balls.    \"Oh, Uncle Wiggily!\" she exclaimed. \"Don't you want to buy some popcorn  balls? Our church is having a little fair, and we are all trying to earn  some money. I am selling popcorn, to help the little heathen children buy  red-colored handkerchiefs.\"    \"Of course, I'll take some,\" said the old gentleman rabbit, \"popcorn  balls, I mean--not children, or hankerchiefs,\" he said quickly. So he  bought a pink one, and a white one, and a chocolate colored one, popcorn  balls you know--not children--and put them in his valise.    Then Uncle Wiggily sent his love to Sammie and Susie Littletail, by Jennie  Chipmunk, and off he started to go back to where Grandfather Goosey Gander  was waiting for him.    Well, something terrible was happening to the poor old gentleman duck, and  I'll tell you all about it. No sooner had the rabbit gotten near the shady  tree under which the grandfather gentleman was resting, than he heard a  cry:    \"Help! Help! Help!\" called the duck. \"Oh, help me quickly, somebody!\"    \"What is the matter?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, limping along as fast as he  could.    \"Oh, a bad snake has caught me!\" cried the duck. \"He has wound himself  around my legs, and I can't walk, and he is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15293"],[0,"Influences of Geographic Environment (#17)"],[1,"ces. When a state has taken advantage  of all its natural conditions, the land becomes a constituent part of  the state,[105] modifying the people which inhabit it, modified by them  in turn, till the connection between the two becomes so strong by  reciprocal interaction, that the people cannot be understood apart from  their land. Any attempt to divide them theoretically reduces the social  or political body to a cadaver, valuable for the study of structural  anatomy after the method of Herbert Spencer, but throwing little light  upon the vital processes.    [Sidenote: Weak land tenure of hunting and pastoral tribes.]    A people who makes only a transitory or superficial use of its land has  upon it no permanent or secure hold. The power to hold is measured by  the power to use; hence the weak tenure of hunting and pastoral tribes.  Between their scattered encampments at any given time are wide  interstices, inviting occupation by any settlers who know how to make  better use of the soil. This explains the easy intrusion of the English  colonists into the sparsely tenanted territory of the Indians, of the  agricultural Chinese into the pasture lands of the Mongols beyond the  Great Wall, of the American pioneers into the hunting grounds of the  Hudson Bay Company in the disputed Oregon country.[106] The frail bonds  which unite these lower societies to their soil are easily ruptured and  the people themselves dislodged, while their land is appropriated by the  intruder. But who could ever conceive of dislodging the Chinese or the  close-packed millions of India? A modern state with a given population  on a wide area is more vulnerable than another of like population more  closely distributed; but the former has the advantage of a reserve  territory for future growth.[107] This was the case of Kursachsen and  Brandenburg in the sixteenth century, and of the United States  throughout its history. But beside the danger of inherent weakness  before attack, a condition of relative underpopulation always threatens  a retardation of development. Easy-going man needs the prod of a  pressing population. [Compare maps pages 8 and 103 for examples.]    [Sidenote: Land and food supply.]    Food is the urgent and recurrent need of individuals and of society. It  dictates their activities in relation to their land at every stage of  economic development, fixes the locality of the encampment or village,  and determines the size of the territory from which sustenance is  drawn. The length of residence in one place depends upon whether the  springs of its food supply are perennial or intermittent, while the  abundance of their flow determines how large a population a given piece  of land can support.    [Sidenote: Advance from natural to artificial basis of subsistence.]    Hunter and fisher folk, relying almost exclusively upon what their land  produces of itself, need a large area and derive from it only an  irregular food supply, which in winter diminishes to the verge of  famine. The transition to the pastoral stage has meant the substitution  of an artificial for a natural basis of subsistence, and therewith a  change which more than any other one thing has inaugurated the advance  from savagery to civilization.[108] From the standpoint of economics, the  forward stride has consisted in the application of capital in the form  of flocks and herds to the task of feeding the wandering horde;[109] from  the standpoint of alimentation, in the guarantee of a more reliable and  generally more nutritious food supply, which enables population to grow  more steadily and rapidly; from the standpoint of geography, in the  marked reduction in the per capita amount of land necessary to yield an  adequate and stable food supply. Pastoral nomadism can support in a  given district of average quality from ten to twenty times as many souls  as can the chase; but in this respect is surpassed from twenty to  thirty-fold by the more productive agriculture. While the subsistence of  a nomad requires 100 to 200 acres of land, for that of a skillful farmer  from 1 to 2 acres suffice.[110] In contrast, the land of the Indians  living in the Hudson Bay Territory in 1857 averaged 10 square miles per  capita; that of the Indians in the United States in 1825, subsidized  moreover by the government, 1-1/4 square miles.[111]    [Sidenote: Land in relation to agriculture.]    With transition to the sedentary life of agriculture, society makes a  further gain over nomadism in the closer integration of its social  units, due to permanent residence in larger and more complex groups; in  the continuous release of labor from the task of mere food-getting for  higher activities, resulting especially in the rapid evolution of the  home; and finally in the more elaborate organization in the use of the  land, leading to economic differentiation of different localities and  to a rapid increase in the population supported by a given area, so that  the land becomes the dominant cohesive force in society. [See maps pages  8 and 9.]    [Sidenote: Migratory agriculture]    Agriculture is adopted at first on a small scale as an adjunct to the  chase or herding. It tends therefore to partake of the same extensive  and nomadic character[112] as these other methods of gaining subsistence,  and only gradually becomes sedentary and intensive. Such was the  superficial, migratory tillage of most American Indians, shifting with  the village in the wake of the retreating game or in search of fresh  unexhausted soil. Such is the agriculture of the primitive Korkus in the  Mahadeo Hills in Central India. They clear a forested slope by burning;  rake over the ashes in which they sow their grain, and reap a fairly  good crop in the fertilized soil. The second year the clearing yields a  reduced product and the third year is abandoned. When the hamlet of five  or six families has exhausted all the land about it, it moves to a new  spot to repeat the process.[113]    The same superficial, extensive tillage, with abandonment of fields  every few years, prevails in the Tartar districts of the Russian  steppes, as it did among the cattle-raising Germans at the beginning of  their history. Tacitus says of them, _Arva per annos mutant et superest  ager_,[114] commenting at the same time upon their abundance of land and  their reluctance to till. Where nomadism is made imperative by aridity,  the agriculture which accompanies it tends to become fixed, owing to the  few localities blessed with an irrigating stream to moisten the soil.  These spots, generally selected for the winter residence, have their  soil enriched, moreover, by the long stay of the herd and thus avoid  exhaustion.[115] Often, however, in enclosed basins the salinity of the  irrigating streams in their lower course ruins the fields after one or  two crops, and necessitates a constant shifting of the cultivated  patches; hence agriculture remains subsidiary to the yield of the  pastures. This condition and effect is conspicuous along the termini of  the streams draining the northern slope of the Kuen Lun into the Tarim  basin.[116]    [Sidenote: Geographic checks to progress.]    The desultory, intermittent, extensive use of the land practised by  hunters and nomads tends, under the growing pressure of population, to  pass into the systematic, continuous, intensive use practised by the  farmer, except where nature presents positive checks to the transition.  The most obvious check consists in adverse conditions of climate and  soil. Where agriculture meets insurmountable obstacles, like the intense  cold of Arctic Siberia and Lapland, or the alkaline soils of Nevada and  the Caspian Depression, or the inadequate rainfall of Mongolia and  Central Arabia, the land can produce no higher economic and social  groups than pastoral hordes. Hence shepherd folk are found in their  purest types in deserts and steppes, where conditions early crystallized  the social form and checked development. [Rainfall map chap. XIV.]    [Sidenote: Native animal and plant life as factors.]    Adverse conditions of climate and soil are not the only factors in this  retardation. The very unequal native equipment of the several continents  with plant and animal forms likely to accelerate the advance to nomadism  and agriculture also enters into the equation. In Australia, the lack of  a single indigenous mammal fit for domestication and of all cereals  blocked from the start the pastoral and agricultural development of the  natives. Hence at the arrival of the Europeans, Australia presented the  unique spectacle of a whole continent with its population still held in  the vise of nature. The Americas had a limited variety of animals  susceptible of domestication, but were more meagerly equipped than the  Old World. Yet the Eskimo failed to tame and herd the reindeer, though  their precarious food-supply furnished a motive for the transition.  Moreover, an abundance of grass and reindeer moss (_Cladonia  rangiferina_), and congenial climatic conditions favored it especially  for the Alaskan Eskimo, who had, besides, the nearby example of the  Siberian Chukches as reindeer herders.[117] The buffalo, whose  domesticability has been proved, was never utilized in this way by the  Indians, though the Spaniard Gomara writes of one tribe, living in the  sixteenth century in the southwestern part of what is now United States  territory, whose chief wealth consisted in herds of tame buffalo.[118]  North America, at the time of the discovery, saw only the dog hanging  about the lodges of the Indians; but in South America the llama and  alpaca, confined to the higher levels of the Andes (10,000 to 15,000  feet elevation) were used in domestic herds only in the mountain-rimmed  valleys of ancient Peru, where, owing to the restricted areas of these  intermontane basins, stock-raising early became stationary,[119] as we  find it in the Alps. Moreover, the high "]]]
