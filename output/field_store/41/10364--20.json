(96)    Charles Dickens. 1812-1870, one of the greatest novelists of modern,  times, was born in Portsmouth, but spent nearly all his life in London.  His father was a conscientious man, but lacked capacity for getting a  livelihood. In consequence, the boy's youth was much darkened by poverty.  It has been supposed that he pictured his father in the character of  \"Micawber.\" He began his active life as a lawyer's apprentice; but soon  left this employment to become a reporter. This occupation he followed  from 1831 to 1836. His first book was entitled \"Sketches of London  Society, by Boz.\" This was followed, in 1837, by the \"Pickwick Papers,\" a  work which suddenly brought much fame to the author. His other works  followed with great rapidity, and his last was unfinished at the time of  his death. He was buried in Westminster Abbey. Mr. Dickens visited America  in 1842, and again in 1867. During his last visit, he read his works in  public, in the principal cities of the United States.    The resources of Dickens's genius seemed exhaustless. He copied no author,  imitated none, but relied entirely on his own powers. He excelled  especially in humor and pathos. He gathered materials for his works by the  most careful and faithful observation. And he painted his characters with  a fidelity so true to their different individualities that, although they  sometimes have a quaint grotesqueness bordering on caricature, they stand  before the memory as living realities. He was particularly successful in  the delineation of the joys and griefs of childhood. \"Little Nell\" and  little \"Paul Dombey\" are known, and have been loved and wept over, in  almost every household where the English language is read. His writings  present very vividly the wants and sufferings of the poor, and have a  tendency to prompt to kindness and benevolence. His works have not escaped  criticism. It has been said that \"his good characters act from impulse,  not from principle,\" and that he shows \"a tricksy spirit of fantastic  exaggeration.\" It has also been said that his novels sometimes lack  skillful plot, and that he seems to speak approvingly of conviviality and  dissipation. \"The Old Curiosity Shop,\" from which the following extract is  taken, was published in 1840.  ###      She was dead. No sleep so beautiful and calm, so free from trace of pain,  so fair to look upon. She seemed a creature fresh from the hand of God,  and waiting for the breath of life; not one who had lived, and suffered  death. Her couch was dressed with here and there some winter berries and  green leaves, gathered in a spot she had been used to favor. \"When I die,  put near me something that has loved the light, and had the sky above it  always.\" These were her words.    She was dead. Dear, gentle, patient, noble Nell was dead. Her little bird,  a poor, slight thing the pressure of a finger would have crushed, was  stirring nimbly in its cage, and the strong heart of its child mistress  was mute and motionless forever! Where were the traces of her early cares,  her sufferings, and fatigues? All gone. Sorrow was dead, indeed, in her;  but peace and perfect happiness were born, imaged in her tranquil beauty  and profound repose.    And still her former self lay there, unaltered in this change. Yes! the  old fireside had smiled upon that same sweet face; it had passed, like a  dream, through haunts of misery and care; at the door of the poor  schoolmaster on the summer evening, before the furnace fire upon the cold  wet night, at the still bedside of the dying boy, there had been the same  mild and lovely look. So shall we know the angels, in their majesty, after  death.    The old man held one languid arm in his, and had the small hand tight  folded to his breast for warmth. It was the hand she had stretched out to  him with her last smile; the hand that had led him on through all their  wanderings. Ever and anon he pressed it to his lips; then hugged it to his  breast again, murmuring that it was warmer now, and, as he said it, he  looked in agony to those who stood around, as if imploring them to help  her.    She was dead, and past all help, or need of help. The ancient rooms she  had seemed to fill with life, even while her own was waning fast, the  garden she had tended, the eyes she had gladdened, the noiseless haunts of  many a thoughtful hour, the paths she had trodden, as it were, but  yesterday, could know her no more.    \"It is not,\" said the schoolmaster, as he bent down to kiss her on the  cheek, and gave his tears free vent, \"it is not in this world that  heaven's justice ends. Think what earth is, compared with the world to  which her young spirit has winged its early flight, and say, if one  deliberate wish, expressed in solemn tones above this bed, could call her  back to life, which of us would utter it?\"    She had been dead two days. They were all about her at the time, knowing  that the end was drawing on. She died soon after daybreak. They had read  and talked to her in the earlier portion of the night; but, as the hours  crept on, she sank to sleep. They could tell by what she faintly uttered  in her dreams, that they were of her journeyings with the old man; they  were of no painful scenes, but of people who had helped them, and used  them kindly; for she often said \"God bless you!\" with great fervor.    Waking, she never wandered in her mind but once, and that was at beautiful  music, which, she said, was in the air. God knows. It may have been.  Opening her eyes, at last, from a very quiet sleep, she begged that they  would kiss her once again. That done, she turned to the old man, with a  lovely smile upon her face, such, they said, as they had never seen, and  could never forget, and clung, with both her arms, about his neck. She had  never murmured or complained; but, with a quiet mind, and manner quite  unaltered, save that she every day became more earnest and more grateful  to them, faded like the light upon the summer's evening.    The child who had been her little friend, came there, almost as soon as it  was day, with an offering of dried flowers, which he begged them to lay  upon her breast. He told them of his dream again, and that it was of her  being restored to them, just as she used to be. He begged hard to see her:  saying, that he would be very quiet, and that they need not fear his being  alarmed, for he had sat alone by his young brother all day long, when he  was dead, and had felt glad to be so near him. They let him have his wish;  and, indeed, he kept his word, and was, in his childish way, a lesson to  them all.    Up to that time, the old man had not spoken once, except to her, or  stirred from the bedside. But, when he saw her little favorite, he was  moved as they had not seen him yet, and made as though he would have him  come nearer. Then, pointing to the bed, he burst into tears for the first  time, and they who stood by, knowing that the sight of this child had done  him good, left them alone together.    Soothing him with his artless talk of her, the child persuaded him to take  some rest, to walk abroad, to do almost as he desired him. And, when the  day came, on which they must remove her, in her earthly shape, from  earthly eyes forever, he led him away, that he might not know when she was  taken from him. They were to gather fresh leaves and berries for her bed.    And now the bell, the bell she had so often heard by night and day, and  listened to with solemn pleasure, almost as a living voice, rung its  remorseless toll for her, so young, so beautiful, so good. Decrepit age,  and vigorous life, and blooming youth, and helpless infancy,--on crutches,  in the pride of health and strength, in the full blush of promise, in the  mere dawn of life, gathered round her. Old men were there, whose eyes were  dim and senses failing, grandmothers, who might have died ten years ago,  and still been old, the deaf, the blind, the lame, the palsied, the living  dead, in many shapes and forms, to see the closing of that early grave.    Along the crowded path they bore her now, pure as the newly fallen snow  that covered it, whose day on earth had been as fleeting. Under that  porch, where she had sat when heaven, in its mercy, brought her to that  peaceful spot, she passed again, and the old church received her in its  quiet shade.        XIV. VANITY OF LIFE. (100)    Johann Gottfried von Herder, 1744-1803, an eminent German poet, preacher,  and philosopher, was born in Mohrungen, and died in Weimar. His published  works comprise sixty volumes. This selection is from his \"Hebrew Poetry.\"  ###      Man, born of woman,  Is of a few days,  And full of trouble;  He cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down;  He fleeth also as a shadow,  And continueth not.    Upon such dost thou open thine eye,  And bring me unto judgment with thee?  Among the impure is there none pure?  Not one.    Are his days so determined?  Hast thou numbered his months,  And set fast his bounds for him  Which he can never pass?  Turn then from him that he may rest,  And enjoy, as an hireling, his day.    The tree hath hope, if it be cut down,  It becometh green again,  And new shoots are put forth.  If even the root is old in the earth,  And its stock die in the ground,  From vapor of water it will bud,  And bring forth boughs as a young plant.    But man dieth, and his power is gone;  He is taken away, and where is he?    Till the waters waste from the sea,  Till the river faileth and is dry land,  Man lieth low, and riseth not again.

The shadow of the planet on the rings may be well seen with a good  2-inch telescope, which will also show Ball's division in the rings. The  shadow of the rings on the planet is a somewhat more difficult feature.  The shadow of the planet on the rings is best seen when the rings are  well open and the planet is in or near quadrature. It is to be looked  for to the left of the ball (in an inverting telescope) at quadrature  preceding opposition, and to the right at quadrature following  opposition. Saturn is more likely to be studied at the latter than at  the former quadrature, as in quadrature preceding opposition he is a  morning star. The shadow of the rings on the planet is best seen when  the rings are but moderately open, and Saturn is in or near quadrature.  When the shadow lies outside the rings it is best seen, as the dark ring  takes off from the sharpness of the contrast when the shadow lies within  the ring. It would take more space than I can spare here to show how it  is to be determined (independently) whether the shadow lies within or  without the ring. But the 'Nautical Almanac' gives the means of  determining this point. When, in the table for assigning the appearance  of the rings, _l_ is less than _l'_ the shadow lies outside the ring,  when _l_ is greater than _l'_ the shadow lies within the ring.    Uranus is just visible to the naked eye when he is in opposition, and  his place accurately known. But he presents no phenomena of interest. I  have seen him under powers which made his disc nearly equal to that of  the moon, yet could see nothing but a faint bluish disc.    Neptune also is easily found if his place be accurately noted on a map,  and a good finder used. We have only to turn the telescope to a few  stars seen in the finder nearly in the place marked in our map, and  presently we shall recognise the one we want by the peculiarity of its  light. What is the lowest power which will exhibit Neptune as a disc I  do not know, but I am certain no observer can mistake him for a fixed  star with a 2-inch aperture and a few minutes' patient scrutiny in  favourable weather.    [Illustration: PLATE VII.]          CHAPTER VII.    HALF-HOURS WITH THE SUN AND MOON.      The moon perhaps is the easiest of all objects of telescopic  observation. A very moderate telescope will show her most striking  features, while each increase of power is repaid by a view of new  details. Yet in one sense the moon is a disappointing object even to the  possessor of a first-class instrument. For the most careful and  persistent scrutiny, carried on for a long series of years, too often  fails to reward the observer by any new discoveries of interest. Our  observer must therefore rather be prepared to enjoy the observation of  recognised features than expect to add by his labours to our knowledge  of the earth's nearest neighbour.    Although the moon is a pleasing and surprising telescopic object when  full, the most interesting views of her features are obtained at other  seasons. If we follow the moon as she waxes or wanes, we see the true  nature of that rough and bleak mountain scenery, which when the moon is  full is partially softened through the want of sharp contrasts of light  and shadow. If we watch, even for half an hour only, the changing form  of the ragged line separating light from darkness on the moon's disc, we  cannot fail to be interested. \"The outlying and isolated peak of some  great mountain-chain becomes gradually larger, and is finally merged in  the general luminous surface; great circular spaces, enclosed with rough  and rocky walls many miles in diameter, become apparent; some with flat  and perfectly smooth floors, variegated with streaks; others in which  the flat floor is dotted with numerous pits or covered with broken  fragments of rock. Occasionally a regularly-formed and unusually  symmetrical circular formation makes its appearance; the exterior  surface of the wall bristling with terraces rising gradually from the  plain, the interior one much more steep, and instead of a flat floor,  the inner space is concave or cup-shaped, with a solitary peak rising in  the centre. Solitary peaks rise from the level plains and cast their  long narrow shadows athwart the smooth surface. Vast plains of a dusky  tint become visible, not perfectly level, but covered with ripples,  pits, and projections. Circular wells, which have no surrounding wall  dip below the plain, and are met with even in the interior of the  circular mountains and on the tops of their walls. From some of the  mountains great streams of a brilliant white radiate in all directions  and can be traced for hundreds of miles. We see, again, great fissures,  almost perfectly straight and of great length, although very narrow,  which appear like the cracks in moist clayey soil when dried by the  sun.\"[14]    But interesting as these views may be, it was not for such discoveries  as these that astronomers examined the surface of the moon. The  examination of mere peculiarities of physical condition is, after all,  but barren labour, if it lead to no discovery of physical variation. The  principal charm of astronomy, as indeed of all observational science,  lies in the study of change--of progress, development, and decay, and  specially of systematic variations taking place in regularly-recurring  cycles. And it is in this relation that the moon has been so  disappointing an object of astronomical observation. For two centuries  and a half her face has been scanned with the closest possible scrutiny;  her features have been portrayed in elaborate maps; many an astronomer  has given a large portion of his life to the work of examining craters,  plains, mountains, and valleys, for the signs of change; but until  lately no certain evidence--or rather, no evidence save of the most  doubtful character--has been afforded that the moon is other than \"a  dead and useless waste of extinct volcanoes.\" Whether the examination of  the remarkable spot called Linne--where lately signs were supposed to  have been seen of a process of volcanic eruption--will prove an  exception to this rule, remains to be seen. The evidence seems to me  strongly to favour the supposition of a change of some sort having taken  place in this neighbourhood.    The sort of scrutiny required for the discovery of changes, or for the  determination of their extent, is far too close and laborious to be  attractive to the general observer. Yet the kind of observation which  avails best for the purpose is perhaps also the most interesting which he  can apply to the lunar details. The peculiarities presented by a spot upon  the moon are to be observed from hour to hour (or from day to day,  according to the size of the spot) as the sun's light gradually sweeps  across it, until the spot is fully lighted; then as the moon wanes and the  sun's light gradually passes from the spot, the series of observations is  to be renewed. A comparison of them is likely--especially if the observer  is a good artist and has executed several faithful delineations of the  region under observation, to throw much light upon the real contour of the  moon's surface at this point.    In the two lunar views in Plate 7 some of the peculiarities I have  described are illustrated. But the patient observer will easily be able  to construct for himself a set of interesting views of different  regions.    It may be noticed that for observation of the waning moon there is no  occasion to wait for those hours in which only the waning moon is  visible _during the night_. Of course for the observation of a  particular region under a particular illumination, the observer has no  choice as to hour. But for generally interesting observations of the  waning moon he can wait till morning and observe by daylight. The moon  is, of course, very easily found by the unaided eye (in the day time)  when not very near to the sun; and the methods described in Chapter V.  will enable the observer to find the moon when she is so near to the sun  as to present the narrowest possible sickle of light.    One of the most interesting features of the moon, when she is observed  with a good telescope, is the variety of colour presented by different  parts of her surface. We see regions of the purest white--regions which  one would be apt to speak of as _snow-covered_, if one could conceive  the possibility that snow should have fallen where (now, at least) there  is neither air nor water. Then there are the so-called seas, large grey  or neutral-tinted regions, differing from the former not merely in  colour and in tone, but in the photographic quality of the light they  reflect towards the earth. Some of the seas exhibit a greenish tint, as  the Sea of Serenity and the Sea of Humours. Where there is a central  mountain within a circular depression, the surrounding plain is  generally of a bluish steel-grey colour. There is a region called the  Marsh of Sleep, which exhibits a pale red tint, a colour seen also near  the Hyrcinian mountains, within a circumvallation called Lichtenburg.  The brightest portion of the whole lunar disc is Aristarchus, the peaks  of which shine often like stars, when the mountain is within the  unillumined portion of the moon. The darkest regions are Grimaldi and  Endymion and the great plain called Plato by modern astronomers--but, by  Hevelius, the Greater Black Lake.    The Sun.--Observation of the sun is perhaps on the whole the most  interesting work to which the possessor of a moderately good telescope  can apply his instrument. Those wonderful varieties in the appearance of  the solar surface which have so long perplexed astronomers, not only  supply in themselves interesting subjects of observation and  examination, but gain an enhanced meaning from the consideration that  they speak meaningly to us of the structure of an "]]]
