I  shall not annoy you longer. Good night.\"    He arose to follow her. \"You need not come with me,\" she added. \"I  shall see Selma, and she will accompany me home--not you.\"    \"Very well, Marie.\"    She turned at the door. \"Will you not promise?\"    \"Promise what?\"    \"Not to do as you said--not to disgrace--\"    \"Marie, where the light shines, I must follow; where the truth beckons,  I must go.

One beautiful summer evening, Henrik Bogstad was baptized in the waters  of the Christiania fjord. After that, the truths of the gospel appeared  clearer than ever, and still whisperings of the Spirit, to which he now  had legal right, testified to his spirit that he was in the way of  salvation, narrow and straight perhaps, but glowing with a light that  comforted and cheered.    He told none of his family or friends of his baptism. They had already  rejected him as far as they could, and they asked him no questions. His  sister would hardly speak to him, and Marie cut him openly. His many  uncles, aunts, and cousins were cold and unfeeling. His mother, though  feeble, and sinking slowly, was the only one of his family that he could  talk to. She seemed to understand and believe him. He felt that in  spirit they were one, and he received great comfort from the thought.    About Midsummer the mother died. Then Henrik spent most of his time at  Nordal. There was peace in the solitude of the pine-clad hills, there  was comfort in the waving fields of grain and the clear-flowing streams.  The lake spread out to his view from his window, and he gazed at its  beauty, sometimes his mind wandering from the Dahl home on the island  westward to unknown America. And America had a new meaning for him now.  Before, it had been simply a new wonder-land, with untold possibilities  in a material way; but added to this there was now the fact that in  America the Latter-day Zion was to be built; there the people of God  were gathering, were building temples, preparatory to the glorious  coming of the Lord.    Henrik soon caught the spirit of gathering, but he quenched it as much  as possible. His brethren in the gospel advised him to remain where he  was and do his full duty to his sister and their interests. This he  tried to do. He would not quarrel with Selma, but was exceedingly  patient and considerate. He would \"talk religion\" with any of his  friends who expressed a desire to do so, but he would not contend.    Henrik mingled more freely with his tenants at Nordal, and they soon  became aware of a change in him. He gave them good treatment. Sometimes,  there were Sunday services in the large parlor of the Bogstad residence,  and the people were invited to attend. They turned out, it must be  admitted, more because of Hr. Bogstad's invitation than because of any  enthusiasm on their part.    Henrik, during this period of comparative loneliness, read much. He  always carried a book in his pocket when out among the hills and fields,  and many a moss-covered stone became his reading table. He had procured  a number of English books which he delighted in, for they brought to him  much that had not yet been printed in his own language.    After the harvesting was over that summer, Henrik directed his attention  to another line of work, pointed out to him by the New Light. He  gathered the genealogy of his forefathers. His was a large family, and  when he searched the old church records at Nordal, at Christiania, and  at a number of other places he found that the family was an old and  prominent one, reaching back to the ancient Norsemen. He derived a  peculiar satisfaction in this work, and he extended his researches until  he had a large list of names on his mother's side as well as on his  father's. \"Among these there are many noble and true,\" thought Henrik.  \"Many will receive the gospel in the spirit world, and all will have the  opportunity. I shall have the necessary earthly work done for them. If  my labors for the living will not avail, my dead ancestors shall have  their chance. Who knows but even now the gospel is being preached to  them, and many of them are looking eagerly for someone to do their work  for them.\" The thought filled him with enthusiasm.    The following spring Selma married, which left Henrik quite alone. He  met Marie at the wedding festivities. She was silent and quiet. He made  no strong efforts to win her back to him, so they drifted apart again.  Then Henrik arranged his affairs so that he could remain away for some  months. He said he was going to America to visit his uncles in  Minnesota,--and yes, very likely he would go farther west. His friends  shook their heads misgivingly, but he only smiled at their fears.    Henrik sailed from Christiania in company with a party of his  fellow-believers, and in due uneventful time, landed in the New World.  He found America a wonderfully big and interesting country. He went  directly westward first, crossing the great plains and rugged mountains  to the valleys beyond. Here he found and visited many of his former  friends. He lived with the Latter-day Saints in their homes, and learned  to know their true character and worth.    Then he saw the temples in which the Saints were doing a saving work  both for the living and the dead. While in conversation with some of the  temple workers, he told them of what he had in the way of genealogy,  which they commended highly, telling him that he had an opportunity to  do much good for his family.    \"I am glad to hear you say that,\" replied he, \"for you know, this work  for the dead was what first impressed me in the gospel. It came to me  naturally, it seems, for I had no trouble in accepting it.\"    Henrik learned much regarding the manner of procedure in this temple  work. He could do the work for the male members of his family, but a  woman must officiate for the female members. This was the true order,  he found.    \"Your sister or your wife or any other near relative would be the person  to help you in this,\" said his informant.    Henrik shook his head. \"I am the only member of the family that has  received the gospel,\" he replied.    \"Then, of course, any other sister in the faith will do; but the  blessings for doing this work belongs to the nearest kin, if they will  receive it. Have you no relatives in America?\"    \"Yes; a lot of them are up in Minnesota, but none that I know are  Latter-day Saints--but I'll go and find out,\" he added as an  afterthought.    And that is what Henrik did. Within a month he was on his way. He found  his Uncle Ole living not far from St. Paul. He was a prosperous farmer  with a family of grown-up sons and daughters who were pleased to see  their kinsman from the homeland. All the news from all the family had to  be told from both sides. Henrik was shown the big farm with its  up-to-date American machinery and methods. He was driven behind blooded  horses to the city and there introduced to many people. They knew that  Henrik was a person of some importance back in Norway, and they wanted  to show him that they also were \"somebody.\" That seemed to be the  principle upon which they lived. The father and mother still belonged to  the Lutheran church. The three daughters had joined a Methodist  congregation because their \"set\" was there. The two boys attended no  church.    Henrik was disappointed. He saw plainly that here was no help for him.  All these were entrapped by the world. At first, Henrik said nothing  about his own religious faith, but after a time he spoke of the subject  to one of his girl cousins. She was not the least interested. He tried  another with the same result. Then, one day at the table, he told them  all plainly what he believed and what he was called. They were merely  surprised. \"That's all right,\" said his cousin Jack who voiced the  universal opinion, \"we live in a free country, you know, where one's  religion isn't called into question.\"    Henrik's other uncle lived in the city. He was a mechanic, having worked  for years in the railroad shops. Some months previous he had been  discharged, and since then he had operated a small \"tinker\" shop of his  own. Uncle Jens lived in a small rented house. Uncle Ole's visits to his  brother were far between. \"Brother Jens is shiftless,\" Uncle Ole said.    Henrik was, however, made welcome in the humble home, and he soon found  the family a most interesting one. His uncle was a religious man,  having, as he put it, \"got religion\" some years ago at a Baptist  revival. He had joined that church and was an active member in it. The  wife and some of the children were devout believers. They indulged in  long family prayers and much scriptural reading. This branch of the  Bogstad family called the wealthy farmer and his children a \"godless  lot.\"    Uncle Jens' oldest daughter, one about Henrik's own age, did not live  at home, therefore he did not see her. He was getting well acquainted  with the others, but Rachel he did not know.    \"I must meet Rachel, too,\" he said one day to his uncle. \"Where can I  find her?\"    \"She works in a down-town department store; at night she stays with some  friends of hers. The fact is that Rachel is peculiar. She is not one  with us. She has been led astray--\"    \"Oh!\" cried Henrik.    \"She is not a bad girl--no, no; but she has been led away into a false  religion, and as she will talk and argue with us all, I thought it best  that she stay away from our home until she comes to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17253"],[0,"Dewey and Other Naval Commanders (#17)"],[1,"them closely, while glimpses of sailors  were caught as they moved about the deck and of the gun crews standing  quietly at their stations. Then, when there was a change of direction,  parties of marines were observed in her tops, muskets in hand, coolly  awaiting the time when the ships would engage at close quarters.    While Captain Carden and his officers were in doubt whether the ship was  a French one she gave her colors to the breeze. They were the Stars and  Stripes of the American Republic. One of the finest of its frigates had  thrown down the gage of battle to as superb a frigate as belonged to the  British navy.    Since all doubt of her nationality was dispelled, one of the American  seamen walked resolutely to Captain Carden, saluted and told him that he  and his companions had no wish to fight the flag of their country. In  reply the officer ordered him back to his station and with notice that  if the request was repeated he would be shot. Sad to say, the sailor  who made his wish known was one of the first killed in battle.    The two ships now began exchanging shots, but the distance was too great  for any damage on either side. A little after 9 o'clock on that bright  sunshiny Sunday morning they were close enough for the wonderful  marksmanship of the American to display itself. The first shot that  found the _Macedonian_ entered through the starboard bulwark and killed  the sergeant of marines. A minute later the mizzen topmast was sundered,  and, cluttered with sails, yards and rigging, it fell into the maintop,  where it hung suspended, liable to fall at any moment and crush those  beneath.    The fire of the American became frightfully destructive. It seemed as if  every shot splintered some part of the rigging or hull and killed and  wounded men right and left. The exasperating feature of this awful  business was that neither Captain Carden nor his aids, who were  directing operations from the quarter deck, could discover any  corresponding damage on the American ship. Her mizzen topgallant mast  had been carried away, but it looked as if all the other shots sent in  her direction sped past without harm. She was wrapped in an immense  volume of smoke made by her own broadsides, and through it constantly  shot tongues of crimson flame, while the roar of the rapidly discharged  guns was incessant.    Now and then a rift appeared in the billows of vapor, through which the  Stars and Stripes were seen fluttering, while the men worked as coolly  at their guns as if going through manoeuvres in time of peace. Finally  the smoke became so dense that the Americans were unable to see through  it. Ceasing firing for a few minutes, the frigate moved far enough  forward to pass from under the impenetrable blanket of vapor and then  renewed the battle with more terrific effect than before. Her firing was  so rapid that several times Captain Carden believed the incessant flame  indicated she was on fire. The report was spread among his men to  encourage them, but no such good fortune came to the Englishmen.    One of the men on board the _Macedonian_ gave the following graphic  account of his experience:    \"Our men kept cheering with all their might. I cheered with them, though  I confess I scarcely knew what for. Certainly there was nothing very  inspiriting in the aspect of things. Grape shot and canister were  pouring through our portholes like leaden hail. The large shot came  against the ship's side, shaking her to the very keel, and passing  through her timbers and scattering terrific splinters, which did more  appalling work than the shot itself. A constant stream of wounded men  were being hurried to the cockpit from all quarters of the ship. My  feelings were pretty much as I suppose every one else felt at such a  time. That men are without thought when they stand among the dying and  dead is too absurd an idea to be entertained. We all appeared cheerful,  but I know that many a serious thought ran through my mind. Still, what  could we do but keep up a semblance at least of animation? To run from  our quarters would have been certain death from the hands of our own  officers; to give way to gloom or show fear would do no good and might  brand us with the name of cowards and insure certain defeat.\"    In the desperate hope of warding off defeat, Captain Garden now ordered  his helm aport and directed that boarders be called. The response was  prompt, for the British sailor fights with unsurpassable heroism, but at  the critical moment the forebrace was carried away, the ship was thrown  into the wind and exposed to a raking fire. The American instantly  seized the advantage and swept the decks with murderous destructiveness.  In a brief time the _Macedonian_ was completely disabled. Her rigging  was in tatters and splinters and her hull had been pierced by more  than a hundred shot, many of which struck between wind and water.    [Illustration: BATTLE BETWEEN THE \"UNITED STATES\" AND THE \"MACEDONIAN.\"]    Finally the American ceased firing and drew off to make the few repairs  that were necessary. During the lull Captain Carden called his surviving  officers around him for council. There was indeed but one thing to do,  and it was agreed to surrender. As the American was returning,  therefore, to resume her appalling work the English colors were hauled  down. The victor lay to and lowered a boat, under charge of a  lieutenant, who, as he climbed aboard, gave his name and that of the  American 44-gun frigate as the _United States_, Captain Stephen Decatur.  The _United States_, whose crew numbered 478, had 5 killed and 7  wounded, while the 297 of the _Macedonian_ lost 36 killed and 68  wounded.    So it was that the old friends settled the question over which they had  argued many times. When the English officer came aboard of the _United  States_ and offered his sword to Decatur the latter said: \"I cannot  receive the sword of a man who has defended his ship with such bravery.\"    The chivalrous nature of Decatur was shown in a private letter in which  he wrote: \"One-half of the satisfaction arising from this victory is  destroyed in seeing the mortification of poor Carden, who deserved  success as much as we did who had the good fortune to obtain it.\"  Everything possible was done to alleviate the sufferings of the  prisoners. The private property of the officers and seamen was returned  or its equivalent in money. In a letter from Captain Carden to Captain  Decatur he expressed his feelings and added: \"I have much gratitude to  express to you, my dear sir, for all your kindnesses, and all my  officers feel it equally with myself. If ever we should turn the tables  we will endeavor, if possible, to improve on your unusual goodness.\"          CHAPTER XIV.    Occasional American Defeats as Well as Victories--Captain Decatur's  Misfortune--The _Chesapeake_ and _Shannon_.      You would gain a wrong impression if my account of the leading naval  events in the War of 1812 were made up wholly of American victories. It  was inevitable that our gallant officers and men should meet with some  defeats. In order, therefore, to give as true an idea as possible of  those times I shall devote this chapter to telling about some events  which went the wrong way.    Enough has been related concerning Stephen Decatur to show that he was  the most prominent of our naval leaders in our last war with Great  Britain. He entered into the work with the same dauntless enthusiasm he  showed whenever it was his privilege to serve his country, and his  capture of the _Macedonian_ was one of the most brilliant exploits of  the many that took place during those memorable years.    In order to understand my use of the words \"captain\" and \"commodore,\" it  is necessary to explain that at the time to which I now refer the latter  rank was different from what it is to-day. The commodore of a squadron  was the highest ranking officer and he might be lower than a captain.  Thus \"Commodore\" Perry, who won the remarkable victory on Lake Erie, was  promoted from that rank to \"captain.\"    Another interesting fact may be named. The Stars and Stripes used in  that war was slightly different in pattern from the present, for,  instead of containing thirteen stripes, as it did at the close of the  Revolution and as it does to-day, it had fifteen. The first law of  Congress bearing on this point was to add a stripe for every new State  admitted to the Union, but after two had come in and others were making  ready it became evident that before long the pattern of the beautiful  emblem would be spoiled if the rule were followed. So the increase in  the number of stripes stopped and remained fifteen for a few years after  the close of the war, even though new States had been admitted. Then the  law was changed so as to provide that the increase of States should be  shown by the stars in the blue field, while the stripes should always  remain thirteen in number, typical of the original colonies of the  Revolution.    It was decided early in the war to send a squadron consisting of the  _President_, Captain Stephen Decatur, and the sloops of war _Peacock_,  Captain Warrington, and _Hornet_, Lieutenant Biddle, and the storeship  _Tom Bowline_ on a cruise in the Indian Ocean. This squadron was to  rendezvous at Tristan d'Acunha, but failed to do so, for a reason that  has been stated in the account of the exploits of the _Hornet_ and  _Peacock_.    Captain Decatur lay in the harbor of New York with his vessels and found  himself so closely blockaded by the British squadron that it was  impossible for the Americans to sail in company. He sent out the two  ships named, and, on the night of January 14, 1815, when the blockading  squadron had been driven to the south by a gale, he sailed down the  Narrows, hoping to get to sea before it returned. There was good reason  to expect success, but misfortune speedily came. The beacon lights"]]]
