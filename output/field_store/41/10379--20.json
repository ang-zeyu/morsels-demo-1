But I was afraid of it last night. It's all this infernally strong air!\"    How I longed to tell him what it was, and to see his face! The thought  of Eva alone restrained me, and I retorted as before, in a tone I strove  to make as friendly, that it was his admirable wine and nothing else.    \"But you took hardly any.\"    \"I shouldn't have touched a drop. I can't stand it. Instead of soothing  me it excites me to the verge of madness. I'm almost over the verge--for  want of sleep--my trouble ever since the trouble.\"    Again I was speaking the literal truth, and again congratulating myself  as though it were a lie: the fellow looked so distressed at my state;  indeed I believe that his distress was as genuine as mine, and his  sentiments as involved. He took my hand again, and his brow wrinkled at  its heat. He asked for the other hand to feel my pulse. I had to drop my  letter to comply.    \"I wish to goodness there was something I could do for you,\" he said.  \"Would you--would you care to see a doctor?\"    I shook my head, and could have smiled at his visible relief.    \"Then I'm going to prescribe for you,\" he said with decision. \"It's the  place that doesn't agree with you, and it was I who brought you to the  place; therefore it's for me to get you out of it as quick as possible.  Up you get, and I'll drive you to the station myself!\"    I had another work to keep from smiling: he was so ingenuously  disingenuous. There was less to smile at in his really nervous anxiety  to get me away. I lay there reading him like a book: it was not my  health that concerned him, of course: was it my safety? I told him he  little knew how ill I was--an inglorious speech that came hard, though  not by any means untrue. \"Move me with this fever on me?\" said I; \"it  would be as much as my miserable life is worth.\"    \"I'm afraid,\" said he, \"that it may be as much as your life's worth to  stay on here!\" And there was such real fear, in his voice and eyes,  that it reconciled me there and then to the discomfort of a big revolver  between the mattress and the small of my back. \"We must get you out  of it,\" he continued, \"the moment you feel fit to stir. Shall we say  to-morrow?\"    \"If you like,\" I said, advisedly; \"and if I can get some sleep to-day.\"    \"Then to-morrow it is! You see I know it's the climate,\" he added,  jumping from tone to tone; \"it couldn't have been those two or three  glasses of sound wine.\"    \"Shall I tell you what it is?\" I said, looking him full in the face,  with eyes that I dare say were wild enough with fever and insomnia.  \"It's the burning of the Lady Jermyn!\" I cried. \"It's the faces and the  shrieks of the women; it's the cursing and the fighting of the men; it's  boat-loads struggling in an oily sea; it's husbands and wives jumping  overboard together; it's men turned into devils, it's hell-fire  afloat--\"    \"Stop! stop!\" he whispered, hoarse as a crow. I was sitting up with my  hot eyes upon him. He was white as the quilt, and the bed shook with his  trembling. I had gone as far as was prudent, and I lay back with a glow  of secret satisfaction.    \"Yes, I will stop,\" said I, \"and I wouldn't have begun if you hadn't  found it so difficult to understand my trouble. Now you know what it  is. It's the old trouble. I came up here to forget it; instead of that  I drink too much and tell you all about it; and the two things together  have bowled me over. But I'll go to-morrow; only give me something to  put me asleep till then.\"    \"I will!\" he vowed. \"I'll go myself to the nearest chemist, and he shall  give me the very strongest stuff he's got. Good-by, and don't you stir  till I come back--for your own sake. I'll go this minute, and I'll ride  like hell!\" And if ever two men were glad to be rid of each other, they  were this young villain and myself.    But what was his villany? It was little enough that I had overheard  at the window, and still less that poor Eva had told me in her hurried  lines. All I saw clearly was that the Lady Jermyn and some hundred souls  had perished by the foulest of foul play; that, besides Eva and myself,  only the incendiaries had escaped; that somehow these wretches had made  a second escape from the gig, leaving dead men and word of their own  death behind them in the boat. And here the motive was as much a mystery  to me as the means; but, in my present state, both were also matters  of supreme indifference. My one desire was to rescue my love from her  loathsome captors; of little else did I pause to think. Yet Rattray's  visit left its own mark on my mind; and long after he was gone I lay  puzzling over the connection between a young Lancastrian, of good  name, of ancient property, of great personal charm, and a crime of  unparalleled atrocity committed in cold blood on the high seas. That  his complicity was flagrant I had no room to doubt, after Eva's own  indictment of him, uttered to his face and in my hearing. Was it then  the usual fraud on the underwriters, and was Rattray the inevitable  accomplice on dry land? I could think of none but the conventional  motive for destroying a vessel. Yet I knew there must be another and a  subtler one, to account not only for the magnitude of the crime, but for  the pains which the actual perpetrators had taken to conceal the fact  of their survival, and for the union of so diverse a trinity as Senhor  Santos, Captain Harris, and the young squire.    It must have been about mid-day when Rattray reappeared, ruddy, spurred,  and splashed with mud; a comfort to sick eyes, I declare, in spite  of all. He brought me two little vials, put one on the chimney-piece,  poured the other into my tumbler, and added a little water.    \"There, old fellow,\" said he; \"swallow that, and if you don't get some  sleep the chemist who made it up is the greatest liar unhung.\"    \"What is it?' I asked, the glass in my hand, and my eyes on those of my  companion.    \"I don't know,\" said he. \"I just told them to make up the strongest  sleeping-draught that was safe, and I mentioned something about your  case. Toss it off, man; it's sure to be all right.\"    Yes, I could trust him; he was not that sort of villain, for all that  Eva Denison had said. I liked his face as well as ever. I liked his eye,  and could have sworn to its honesty as I drained the glass. Even had it  been otherwise, I must have taken my chance or shown him all; as it was,  when he had pulled down my blind, and shaken my pillow, and he gave  me his hand once more, I took it with involuntary cordiality. I only  grieved that so fine a young fellow should have involved himself in so  villainous a business; yet for Eva's sake I was glad that he had; for  my mind failed (rather than refused) to believe him so black as she had  painted him.    The long, long afternoon that followed I never shall forget. The opiate  racked my head; it did not do its work; and I longed to sleep till  evening with a longing I have never known before or since. Everything  seemed to depend upon it; I should be a man again, if only I could  first be a log for a few hours. But no; my troubles never left me for an  instant; and there I must lie, pretending that they had! For the other  draught was for the night; and if they but thought the first one had  taken due effect, so much the less would they trouble their heads about  me when they believed that I had swallowed the second.    Oh, but it was cruel! I lay and wept with weakness and want of sleep;  ere night fell I knew that it would find me useless, if indeed my reason  lingered on. To lie there helpless when Eva was expecting me, that would  be the finishing touch. I should rise a maniac if ever I rose at  all. More probably I would put one of my five big bullets into my own  splitting head; it was no small temptation, lying there in a double  agony, with the loaded weapon by my side.    Then sometimes I thought it was coming; and perhaps for an instant would  be tossing in my hen-coop; then back once more. And I swear that  my physical and mental torments, here in my bed, would have been  incomparably greater than anything I had endured on the sea, but for the  saving grace of one sweet thought. She lived! She lived! And the God who  had taken care o me, a castaway, would surely deliver her also from  the hands of murderers and thieves. But not through me--I lay weak and  helpless--and my tears ran again and yet again as I felt myself growing  hourly weaker.    I remember what a bright fine day it was, with the grand open country  all smiles beneath a clear, almost frosty sky, once when I got up on  tip-toe and peeped out. A keen wind whistled about the cottage; I felt  it on my feet as I stood; but never have I known a more perfect and  invigorating autumn day. And there I must lie, with the manhood ebbing  Out of me, the manhood that I needed so for the night! I crept back into  bed. I swore that I would sleep. Yet there I lay, listening sometimes to  that vile woman's tread below; sometimes to mysterious whispers, between  whom I neither knew nor cared; anon to my watch ticking by my side, to  the heart beating in my body, hour after hour--hour after hour. I prayed  as I have seldom prayed. I wept as I have never wept. I railed and  blasphemed--not with my lips, because the woman must think I was  asleep--but so much the more viciously in my heart.    Suddenly it turned dark. There were no gradations--not even a tropical  twilight. One minute I aw the sun upon the blind; the next--thank God!  Oh, thank God! No light broke any longer through the blind; just a faint  and narrow glimmer stole between it and the casement; and the light that  had been bright golden was palest silver now.    It was the moon. I had been in dreamless sleep for hours.    The joy of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17034"],[0,"English Fairy Tales (#17)"],[1,", on the  stairs, twisting her hands.    Then Childe Wynde looking at her cried:      \"Woe! Woe to thee, thou wicked Witch!       An ill fate shalt thine be!     The doom thou dreed on May Margret       The same doom shalt thou dree.       Henceforth thou'lt be a Laidly Toad       That in the clay doth wend,     And unspelled thou wilt never be       Till this world hath an end.\"    And as he spoke the wicked Queen began to shrivel, and she shrivelled  and shrivelled to a horrid wrinkled toad that hopped down the castle  steps and disappeared in a crevice.    But to this day a loathsome toad is sometimes seen haunting Bamborough  Keep; and that Laidly Toad is the wicked Witch Queen!    But Childe Wynde and Princess May Margret loved each other as much as  ever, and lived happily ever after.          [Illustration: Tatty sat down and wept]    TITTY MOUSE AND TATTY MOUSE      Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse both lived in a house.    Titty Mouse went a-gleaning, and Tatty Mouse went a-gleaning.    So they both went a-gleaning.    Titty Mouse gleaned an ear of corn, and Tatty Mouse gleaned an ear of  corn.    So they both gleaned an ear of corn.    Titty Mouse made a pudding, and Tatty Mouse made a pudding.    So they both made a pudding.    And Tatty Mouse put her pudding into the pot to boil.    But when Titty went to put hers in, the pot tumbled over, and scalded  her to death, and Tatty sat down and wept.    Then the three-legged stool said, \"Tatty, why do you weep?\"    \"Titty's dead,\" said Tatty, \"and so I weep.\"    \"Then,\" said the stool, \"I'll hop,\" so the stool hopped.    Then a broom in the corner of the room said, \"Stool, why do you hop?\"    \"Oh!\" said the stool, \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and so I hop.\"    \"Then,\" said the broom, \"I'll sweep,\" so the broom began to sweep.    Then said the door, \"Broom, why do you sweep?\"    \"Oh!\" said the broom, \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool  hops, and so I sweep.\"    \"Then,\" said the door, \"I'll jar,\" so the door jarred.    Then the window said, \"Door, why do you jar?\"    \"Oh!\" said the door, \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool hops,  and the broom sweeps, and so I jar.\"    \"Then,\" said the window, \"I'll creak,\" so the window creaked.    Now there was an old form outside the house, and when the window  creaked, the form said, \"Window, why do you creak?\"    \"Oh!\" said the window, \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool  hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and so I creak!\"    \"Then,\" said the old form, \"I'll gallop round the house.\" So the old  form galloped round the house.    Now there was a fine large walnut tree growing by the cottage, and the  tree said to the form, \"Form, why do you gallop round the house?\"    \"Oh!\" says the form, \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, and the stool  hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, and so  I gallop round the house.\"    \"Then,\" said the walnut tree, \"I'll shed my leaves.\" So the walnut tree  shed all its beautiful green leaves.    Now there was a little bird perched on one of the boughs of the tree,  and when all the leaves fell, it said, \"Walnut tree, why do you shed  your leaves?\"    \"Oh!\" said the tree, \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool hops, and  the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the old form  gallops round the house, and so I shed my leaves.\"    \"Then,\" said the little bird, \"I'll moult all my feathers,\" so he  moulted all his gay feathers.    Now there was a little girl walking below, carrying a jug of milk for  her brothers' and sisters' supper, and when she saw the poor little bird  moult all its feathers, she said, \"Little bird, why do you moult all  your feathers?\"    \"Oh!\" said the little bird, \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool  hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the  old form gallops round the house, the walnut tree sheds its leaves, and  so I moult all my feathers.\"    \"Then,\" said the little girl, \"I'll spill the milk.\" So she dropt the  pitcher and spilt the milk.    Now there was an old man just by on the top of a ladder thatching a  rick, and when he saw the little girl spill the milk, he said, \"Little  girl, what do you mean by spilling the milk? your little brothers and  sisters must go without their suppers.\"    Then said the little girl, \"Titty's dead, and Tatty weeps, the stool  hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window creaks, the  old form gallops round the house, the walnut tree sheds all its leaves,  the little bird moults all its feathers, and so I spill the milk.\"    \"Oh!\" said the old man, \"then I'll tumble off the ladder and break my  neck.\"    So he tumbled off the ladder and broke his neck; and when the old man  broke his neck, the great walnut tree fell down with a crash and upset  the old form and house, and the house falling knocked the window out,  and the window knocked the door down, and the door upset the broom, and  the broom upset the stool, and poor little Tatty Mouse was buried  beneath the ruins.          JACK AND THE BEANSTALK      A long long time ago, when most of the world was young and folk did what  they liked because all things were good, there lived a boy called Jack.    His father was bed-ridden, and his mother, a good soul, was busy early  morns and late eves planning and placing how to support her sick husband  and her young son by selling the milk and butter which Milky-White, the  beautiful cow, gave them without stint. For it was summer-time. But  winter came on; the herbs of the fields took refuge from the frosts in  the warm earth, and though his mother sent Jack to gather what fodder he  could get in the hedgerows, he came back as often as not with a very  empty sack; for Jack's eyes were so often full of wonder at all the  things he saw that sometimes he forgot to work!    So it came to pass that one morning Milky-White gave no milk at all--not  one drain! Then the good hard-working mother threw her apron over her  head and sobbed:    \"What shall we do? What shall we do?\"    Now Jack loved his mother; besides, he felt just a bit sneaky at being  such a big boy and doing so little to help, so he said, \"Cheer up! Cheer  up! I'll go and get work somewhere.\" And he felt as he spoke as if he  would work his fingers to the bone; but the good woman shook her head  mournfully.    \"You've tried that before, Jack,\" she said, \"and nobody would keep you.  You are quite a good lad but your wits go a-wool-gathering. No, we must  sell Milky-White and live on the money. It is no use crying over milk  that is not here to spill!\"    You see, she was a wise as well as a hard-working woman, and Jack's  spirits rose.    \"Just so,\" he cried. \"We will sell Milky-White and be richer than ever.  It's an ill wind that blows no one good. So, as it is market-day, I'll  just take her there and we shall see what we shall see.\"    \"But--\" began his mother.    \"But doesn't butter parsnips,\" laughed Jack. \"Trust me to make a good  bargain.\"    So, as it was washing-day, and her sick husband was more ailing than  usual, his mother let Jack set off to sell the cow.    \"Not less than ten pounds,\" she bawled after him as he turned the  corner.    Ten pounds, indeed! Jack had made up his mind to twenty! Twenty solid  golden sovereigns!    He was just settling what he should buy his mother as a fairing out of  the money, when he saw a queer little old man on the road who called  out, \"Good-morning, Jack!\"    \"Good-morning,\" replied Jack, with a polite bow, wondering how the queer  little old man happened to know his name; though, to be sure, Jacks were  as plentiful as blackberries.    \"And where may you be going?\" asked the queer little old man. Jack  wondered again--he was always wondering, you know--what the queer little  old man had to do with it; but, being always polite, he replied:    \"I am going to market to sell Milky-White--and I mean to make a good  bargain.\"    \"So you will! So you will!\" chuckled the queer little old man. \"You  look the sort of chap for it. I bet you know how many beans make five?\"    \"Two in each hand and one in my mouth,\" answered Jack readily. He really  was sharp as a needle.    \"Just so, just so!\" chuckled the queer little old man; and as he spoke  he drew out of his pocket five beans. \"Well, here they are, so give us  Milky-White.\"    Jack was so flabbergasted that he stood with his mouth open as if he  expected the fifth bean to fly into it.    \"What!\" he said at last. \"My Milky-White for five common beans! Not if I  know it!\"    \"But they aren't common beans,\" put in the queer little old man, and  there was a queer little smile on his queer little face. \"If you plant  these beans over-night, by morning they will have grown up right into  the very sky.\"    Jack was too flabbergasted this time even to open his mouth; his eyes  opened instead.    [Illustration: As he spoke he drew out of his pocket five beans]    \"Did you say right into the very sky?\" he asked at last; for, see you,  Jack had wondered more about the sky than about anything else.    \"_RIGHT UP INTO THE VERY SKY_\" repeated the queer old man, with a nod  between each word. \"It's a good bargain, Jack; and, as fair play's a  jewel, if they don't--why! meet me here to-morrow morning and you shall  have Milky-White back again. Will that please you?\"    \"Right as a trivet,\" cried Jack, without stopping to think, and the next  moment he found himself standing on an empty road.    \"Two in each hand and one in my mouth,\" repeated Jack. \"That is what I  said, and what I'll do. Everything in order, and if what the queer  little old man said isn't true, I shall get Milky-White back to-morrow  morning.\"    So whistling and munching the bean he trudged home cheerfully, wondering  what the sky would be like if he ever got there.    \"What a long time you've been!\" exclaimed his mother, who was watching  anxiously for him at the gate. \"It is past sun-setting; but I see you"]]]
