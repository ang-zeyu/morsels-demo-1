In that sense  the germs of the Mahayana existed in the life-time of Gotama. But the  difference between early and later Buddhism lies in this, that the  deities who surround the Buddha in the Pali Pitakas are mere  accessories: his teaching would not be affected if they were all  removed. But the Bodhisattvas in the Lotus or the Sutra of the Happy  Land have a doctrinal significance.    Though in India old ideas persist with unusual vitality, still even  there they can live only if they either develop or gather round them  new accretions. As one of the religions of India, Buddhism was  sensitive to the general movement of Indian thought, or rather it was  a part of that movement. We see as clearly in Buddhist as in  non-Buddhist India that there was a tendency to construct philosophic  systems and another tendency to create deities satisfying to the  emotions as well as to the intellect and yet another tendency to  compose new scriptures. But apart from this parallel development, it  becomes clear after the Christian era that Buddhism is becoming  surrounded by Hinduism. The influence is not indeed one-sided: there  is interdependence and interpenetration but the net result is that the  general Indian features of each religious period overpower the  specially Buddhist features and in the end we find that while Hinduism  has only been profoundly modified Buddhism has vanished.    If we examine the Pali Pitakas, including the heresies mentioned in  the Kathavatthu, we find that they contain the germs of many  Mahayanist ideas. Thus side by side with the human portrait of the  Buddha there is the doctrine that he is one in a series of  supernatural teachers, each with the same life-history, and this life  is connected with the whole course of nature, as is shown by the  sympathetic earthquakes which mark its crises. His birth is  supernatural and had he willed it he could have lived until the end of  the present Kalpa.[171] So, too, the nature of a Buddha when he is  released from form, that is after death, is deep and unfathomable as  the ocean.[172] The Kathavatthu condemns the ideas (thus showing that  they existed) that Buddhas are born in all quarters of the universe,  that the Buddha was superhuman in the ordinary affairs of life, that  he was not really born in the world of men and that he did not preach  the Law himself. These last two heresies are attributed by the  commentary to the Vetulyakas who are said to have believed that he  remained in the Tushita heaven and sent a phantom to preach on earth.  Here we have the rudiments of the doctrine afterwards systematized  under the name of the three bodies of Buddha. Similarly though Nirvana  is regarded as primarily an ethical state, the Pali Canon contains the  expression Nirvanadhatu and the idea[173] that Nirvana is a sphere or  realm (_ayatanam_) which transcends the transitory world and in which  such antitheses are coming and going, birth and death, cease to exist.  This foreshadows the doctrine of Bhuta-tathata and we seem to hear a  prelude to the dialectic of Nagarjuna when the Kathavatthu discusses  whether Sunnata or the void is predicable of the Skandhas and when it  condemns the views that anything now existing existed in the past: and  that knowledge of the present is possible (whereas the moment anything  is known it is really past). The Kathavatthu also condemns the  proposition that a Bodhisattva can be reborn in realms of woe or fall  into error, and this proposition hints that the career of a  Bodhisattva was considered of general interest.    The Mahayana grows out of the Hinayana and in many respects the  Hinayana passes into it and is preserved unchanged. It is true that in  reading the Lotus we wonder how this marvellous cosmic vision can  represent itself as the teaching of Gotama, but the Buddhacarita of  Asvaghosha, though embellished with literary mythology, hardly  advances in doctrine beyond the Pali sutras describing the marvels of  the Buddha's nativity[174] and the greater part of Nagarjuna's  Friendly Epistle, which purports to contain an epitome of the faith,  is in phraseology as well as thought perfectly in harmony with the  Pali Canon. Whence comes this difference of tone in works accepted by  the same school? One difficulty of the historian who essays to account  for the later phases of Buddhism is to apportion duly the influence of  Indian and foreign elements. On the one hand, the Mahayana, whether we  call it a development or perversion, is a product of Indian thought.  To explain its trinities, its saviours, its doctrine of self sacrifice  it is not necessary to seek abroad. New schools, anxious to claim  continuity and antiquity, gladly retained as much of the old doctrine  as they could. But on the other hand, Indian Buddhism came into  contact with foreign, especially Iranian, ideas and undoubtedly  assimilated some of them. From time to time I have drawn attention to  such cases in this work, but as a rule the foreign ideas are so  thoroughly mastered and indianized that they cease to be obvious. They  merely open up to Indian thought a new path wherein it can move in its  own way.    In the period following Asoka's death Buddhism suffered a temporary  eclipse. Pushyamitra who in 184 B.C. overthrew the Mauryas and  established the Sunga dynasty was a patron of the Brahmans. Taranatha  describes him[175] as a ferocious persecutor, and the Divyavadana  supports the story. But the persecution, if it really occurred, was  probably local and did not seriously check the spread of Buddhism,  which before the time of Kanishka had extended northwards to Bactria  and Kashmir. The latter territory became the special home of the  Sarvastivadins. It was in the reign of Pushyamitra that the  Graeco-Bactrian king Menander or Milinda invaded India (155-3 B.C.) and  there were many other invasions and settlements of tribes coming from  the north-west and variously described as Sakas, Pahlavas, Parthians  and Yavanas, culminating in the conquests of the Kushans. The whole  period was disturbed and confused but some general statements can be  made with considerable confidence.    From about 300 B.C. to 100 A.D. we find inscriptions, buildings and  statues testifying to the piety of Buddhist and Jain donors but hardly  any indications of a similar liberality to Brahmans. In the second and  third centuries A.D. grants of land to Brahmans and their temples  begin to be recorded and in the fourth century (that is with the rise  of the Gupta Dynasty) such grants become frequent. These facts can  hardly be interpreted otherwise than as meaning that from 300 B.C. to  100 A.D. the upper classes of India favoured Buddhism and Jainism and  did not favour the Brahmans in the same way or to the same extent. But  it must be remembered that the religion of the Brahmans continued  throughout this period and produced a copious literature, and also  that the absence of works of art may be due to the fact that their  worship was performed in sacrificial enclosures and that they had not  yet begun to use temples and statues. After the first century A.D. we  have first a gradual and then a rapid rise in Brahmanic influence.  Inscriptions as well as books indicate that a linguistic change  occurred in the same period. At first popular dialects were regarded  as sufficiently dignified and current to be the medium for both  scripture and official records. Sanskrit remained a thing apart--the  peculiar possession of the Brahman literati. Then the popular language  was Sanskritized, the rules of Sanskrit grammar being accepted as the  standard to which it ought to conform, though perfect conformity was  impracticable. In much the same way the modern Greeks try to bring  Romaic into line with classical Greek. Finally Sanskrit was recognized  as the proper language for literature, government and religion. The  earliest inscriptions[176] in correct Sanskrit seem to date from the  second century A.D. Further, the invaders who entered India from the  north-west favoured Buddhism on the whole. Coins indicate that some of  them worshipped Siva[177] but the number and beauty of Buddhist  monuments erected under their rule can hardly be interpreted except as  a sign of their patronage. And their conversion was natural for they  had no strong religious convictions of their own and the Brahmans  with their pride of caste shrank from foreigners. But Buddhism had no  prejudice of race or class: it was animated by a missionary spirit and  it was probably the stronger creed at this period. It not only met the  invaders on their entry into India but it sent missionaries to them in  Bactria and Afghanistan, so that to some extent they brought Buddhism  with them. But it was a Buddhism combined with the most varied  elements. Hellenic art and religion had made the figures of Apollo,  Herakles and Helios familiar in Bactria, and both Bactria and northern  India were in touch with Zoroastrians. The mixed cults of these  borderlands readily professed allegiance to the Buddha but, not  understanding Indian ideas, simply made him into a deity and having  done this were not likely to repudiate other Indian deities. Thus in  its outward form the Buddhism of the invaders tended to be a compound  of Indian, Greek and Persian ideas in which Sun worship played a large  part, for not only Indian myths, but Apollo and Helios and the Persian  Mithra all entered into it. Persian influence in art is discernible as  early as the architecture of Asoka: in doctrine it has something to do  with such figures as Vairocana and Amitabha. Graeco-Roman influence  also was powerful in art and through art affected religion. In Asoka's  time likenesses of the Buddha were unknown and the adoration of  images, if not entirely due to the art"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1658"],[0,"Phaedo (#17)"],[1," better able than myself answer him? for there is force in his attack  upon me. But perhaps, before we answer him, we had better also hear what  Cebes has to say that we may gain time for reflection, and when they  have both spoken, we may either assent to them, if there is truth in  what they say, or if not, we will maintain our position. Please to tell  me then, Cebes, he said, what was the difficulty which troubled you?    Cebes said: I will tell you. My feeling is that the argument is where it  was, and open to the same objections which were urged before; for I am  ready to admit that the existence of the soul before entering into  the bodily form has been very ingeniously, and, if I may say so, quite  sufficiently proven; but the existence of the soul after death is still,  in my judgment, unproven. Now my objection is not the same as that of  Simmias; for I am not disposed to deny that the soul is stronger and  more lasting than the body, being of opinion that in all such respects  the soul very far excels the body. Well, then, says the argument to me,  why do you remain unconvinced?--When you see that the weaker continues  in existence after the man is dead, will you not admit that the more  lasting must also survive during the same period of time? Now I will  ask you to consider whether the objection, which, like Simmias, I will  express in a figure, is of any weight. The analogy which I will adduce  is that of an old weaver, who dies, and after his death somebody  says:--He is not dead, he must be alive;--see, there is the coat which  he himself wove and wore, and which remains whole and undecayed. And  then he proceeds to ask of some one who is incredulous, whether a man  lasts longer, or the coat which is in use and wear; and when he is  answered that a man lasts far longer, thinks that he has thus certainly  demonstrated the survival of the man, who is the more lasting, because  the less lasting remains. But that, Simmias, as I would beg you to  remark, is a mistake; any one can see that he who talks thus is talking  nonsense. For the truth is, that the weaver aforesaid, having woven and  worn many such coats, outlived several of them, and was outlived by the  last; but a man is not therefore proved to be slighter and weaker than  a coat. Now the relation of the body to the soul may be expressed in a  similar figure; and any one may very fairly say in like manner that the  soul is lasting, and the body weak and shortlived in comparison. He may  argue in like manner that every soul wears out many bodies, especially  if a man live many years. While he is alive the body deliquesces and  decays, and the soul always weaves another garment and repairs the  waste. But of course, whenever the soul perishes, she must have on her  last garment, and this will survive her; and then at length, when  the soul is dead, the body will show its native weakness, and quickly  decompose and pass away. I would therefore rather not rely on the  argument from superior strength to prove the continued existence of the  soul after death. For granting even more than you affirm to be possible,  and acknowledging not only that the soul existed before birth, but also  that the souls of some exist, and will continue to exist after death,  and will be born and die again and again, and that there is a  natural strength in the soul which will hold out and be born many  times--nevertheless, we may be still inclined to think that she will  weary in the labours of successive births, and may at last succumb in  one of her deaths and utterly perish; and this death and dissolution of  the body which brings destruction to the soul may be unknown to any of  us, for no one of us can have had any experience of it: and if so,  then I maintain that he who is confident about death has but a foolish  confidence, unless he is able to prove that the soul is altogether  immortal and imperishable. But if he cannot prove the soul's  immortality, he who is about to die will always have reason to fear that  when the body is disunited, the soul also may utterly perish.    All of us, as we afterwards remarked to one another, had an unpleasant  feeling at hearing what they said. When we had been so firmly convinced  before, now to have our faith shaken seemed to introduce a confusion and  uncertainty, not only into the previous argument, but into any future  one; either we were incapable of forming a judgment, or there were no  grounds of belief.    ECHECRATES: There I feel with you--by heaven I do, Phaedo, and when you  were speaking, I was beginning to ask myself the same question: What  argument can I ever trust again? For what could be more convincing than  the argument of Socrates, which has now fallen into discredit? That  the soul is a harmony is a doctrine which has always had a wonderful  attraction for me, and, when mentioned, came back to me at once, as my  own original conviction. And now I must begin again and find another  argument which will assure me that when the man is dead the soul  survives. Tell me, I implore you, how did Socrates proceed? Did he  appear to share the unpleasant feeling which you mention? or did he  calmly meet the attack? And did he answer forcibly or feebly? Narrate  what passed as exactly as you can.    PHAEDO: Often, Echecrates, I have wondered at Socrates, but never more  than on that occasion. That he should be able to answer was nothing,  but what astonished me was, first, the gentle and pleasant and approving  manner in which he received the words of the young men, and then his  quick sense of the wound which had been inflicted by the argument, and  the readiness with which he healed it. He might be compared to a general  rallying his defeated and broken army, urging them to accompany him and  return to the field of argument.    ECHECRATES: What followed?    PHAEDO: You shall hear, for I was close to him on his right hand, seated  on a sort of stool, and he on a couch which was a good deal higher.  He stroked my head, and pressed the hair upon my neck--he had a way of  playing with my hair; and then he said: To-morrow, Phaedo, I suppose  that these fair locks of yours will be severed.    Yes, Socrates, I suppose that they will, I replied.    Not so, if you will take my advice.    What shall I do with them? I said.    To-day, he replied, and not to-morrow, if this argument dies and we  cannot bring it to life again, you and I will both shave our locks; and  if I were you, and the argument got away from me, and I could not hold  my ground against Simmias and Cebes, I would myself take an oath, like  the Argives, not to wear hair any more until I had renewed the conflict  and defeated them.    Yes, I said, but Heracles himself is said not to be a match for two.    Summon me then, he said, and I will be your Iolaus until the sun goes  down.    I summon you rather, I rejoined, not as Heracles summoning Iolaus, but  as Iolaus might summon Heracles.    That will do as well, he said. But first let us take care that we avoid  a danger.    Of what nature? I said.    Lest we become misologists, he replied, no worse thing can happen to a  man than this. For as there are misanthropists or haters of men, there  are also misologists or haters of ideas, and both spring from the same  cause, which is ignorance of the world. Misanthropy arises out of the  too great confidence of inexperience;--you trust a man and think him  altogether true and sound and faithful, and then in a little while he  turns out to be false and knavish; and then another and another, and  when this has happened several times to a man, especially when it  happens among those whom he deems to be his own most trusted and  familiar friends, and he has often quarreled with them, he at last hates  all men, and believes that no one has any good in him at all. You must  have observed this trait of character?    I have.    And is not the feeling discreditable? Is it not obvious that such an  one having to deal with other men, was clearly without any experience of  human nature; for experience would have taught him the true state of  the case, that few are the good and few the evil, and that the great  majority are in the interval between them.    What do you mean? I said.    I mean, he replied, as you might say of the very large and very small,  that nothing is more uncommon than a very large or very small man; and  this applies generally to all extremes, whether of great and small, or  swift and slow, or fair and foul, or black and white: and whether  the instances you select be men or dogs or anything else, few are the  extremes, but many are in the mean between them. Did you never observe  this?    Yes, I said, I have.    And do you not imagine, he said, that if there were a competition in  evil, the worst would be found to be very few?    Yes, that is very likely, I said.    Yes, that is very likely, he replied; although in this respect arguments  are unlike men--there I was led on by you to say more than I had  intended; but the point of comparison was, that when a simple man who  has no skill in dialectics believes an argument to be true which he  afterwards imagines to be false, whether really false or not, and  then another and another, he has no longer any faith left, and great  disputers, as you know, come to think at last that they have grown to be  the wisest of mankind; for they alone perceive the utter unsoundness and  instability of all arguments, or indeed, of all things, which, like the  currents in the Euripus, are going up and down in never-ceasing ebb and  flow.    That is quite true, I said.    Yes, Phaedo, he replied, and how melancholy, if there be such a thing as  truth or certainty or possibility of knowledge--that a man should have  lighted upon some argument or other which at first seemed true and then  turned out to be false, and instead of blaming himself and his own want  of wit, because he is annoyed, should at last be too glad to"]]]
