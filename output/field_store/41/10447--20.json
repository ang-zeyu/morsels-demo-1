Amendment [XX.][l]    Section 1. The terms of the President and Vice President shall  end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and  Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which  such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and  the terms of their successors shall then begin.    Sec. 2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every  year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of January,  unless they shall by law appoint a different day.    Sec. 3. If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of  the President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice President  elect shall become President. If a President shall not have been chosen  before the time fixed for the beginning of his term, or if the President  elect shall have failed to qualify, then the Vice President elect shall  act as President until a President shall have qualified; and the  Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a President  elect nor a Vice President elect shall have qualified, declaring who  shall then act as President, or the manner in which one who is to act  shall be selected, and such person shall act accordingly until a  President or Vice President shall have qualified.    Sec. 4. The Congress may by law provide for the case of the  death of any of the persons from whom the House of Representatives may  choose a President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon  them, and for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the  Senate may choose a Vice President whenever the right of choice shall  have devolved upon them.    Sec. 5. Sections 1 and 2 shall take effect on the 15th day of  October following the ratification of this article.    Sec. 6. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have  been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of  three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of  its submission.      Amendment [XXI.][m]    Section 1. The eighteenth article of amendment to the  Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed.    Sec. 2. The transportation or importation into any State,  Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use  therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is  hereby prohibited.    Sec. 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have  been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by conventions in the  several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from  the date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress.      Amendment [XXII.][n]    Section 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the  President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of  President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to  which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the  office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply  to any person holding the office of President when this Article was  proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be  holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term  within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of  President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.    Section 2. This Article shall be inoperative unless it shall  have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the  legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years  from the date of its submission to the States by the Congress.      Notes    [a] In Dillon _v._ Gloss, 256 U.S. 368 [1921], the Supreme Court stated  that it would take Judicial notice of the date on which a State ratified  a proposed constitutional amendment. Accordingly the Court consulted the  State Journals to determine the dates on which each house of the  legislature of certain States ratified the 18th Amendment. It,  therefore, follows that the date on which the governor approved the  ratification, or the date on which the secretary of state of a given  State certified the ratification, or the date on which the Secretary of  State of the United States received a copy of said certificate, or the  date on which he proclaimed that the amendment had been ratified are not  controlling. Hence, the ratification date given in the following notes  is the date on which the legislature of a given State approved the  particular amendment (signature by the speaker or presiding officers of  both houses being considered a part of the ratification of the  \"legislature\"). When that date is not available, the date given is that  on which it was approved by the governor or certified by the secretary  of state of the particular State. In each case such fact has been noted.  Except as otherwise indicated information as to ratification is based on  data supplied by the Department of State.    [b] Brackets enclosing an amendment number indicate that the number was  not specifically assigned in the resolution proposing the amendment. It  will be seen, accordingly, that only amendments XIII, XIV, XV and XVI  were thus technically ratified by number. The first 10 amendments along  with 2 others which failed of ratification were proposed by Congress on  September 25, 1789, when they passed the Senate [1 Ann. Cong. (1st  Cong., 1st sess.) 90], having previously passed the House on September  24 [_Id._, 948]. They appear officially in 1 Stat. 97. Ratification was  completed on December 15, 1791, when the eleventh State (Virginia)  approved these amendments, there being then 14 States in the Union.    The several State legislatures ratified the first 10 amendments to the  Constitution (i.e. nos. 3 to 12 of those proposed) on the following  dates: New Jersey, November 20, 1789; Maryland, December 19, 1789; North  Carolina, December 22, 1789; South Carolina, January 19, 1790; New  Hampshire, January 25, 1790; Delaware, January 28, 1790; New York,  February 27, 1790; Pennsylvania, March 10, 1790; Rhode Island, June 7,  1790; Vermont, November 3, 1791; Virginia, December 15, 1791. The two  amendments which failed of ratification (i.e. nos. 1 and 2 of those  proposed) prescribed the ratio of representation to population in the  House, and specified that no law varying the compensation of members of  Congress should be effective until after an intervening election of  Representatives. The first was ratified by 10 States (1 short of the  requisite number) and the second by 6 States [2 Doc. Hist. Const.,  325-390].    [c] The 11th Amendment was proposed by Congress on March 4, 1794, when  it passed the House [4 Ann. Cong. (3d Cong., 1st sess.) 477, 478],  having previously passed the Senate on January 14 [_Id._, 30, 31]. It  appears officially in 1 Stat. 402. Ratification was completed on  February 7, 1795, when the twelfth State (North Carolina) approved the  amendment, there being then 15 States in the Union. Official  announcement of ratification was not made until January 8, 1798, when  President John Adams in a message to Congress stated that the 11th  Amendment had been adopted by three-fourths of the States and that it  \"may now be deemed to be a part of the Constitution\" [1 Mess. and Papers  of Pres. 250]. In the interim South Carolina had ratified, and Tennessee  had been admitted into the Union as the Sixteenth State.    The several State legislatures ratified the 11th Amendment on the  following dates: New York, March 27, 1794; Rhode Island, March 31, 1794;  Connecticut, May 8, 1794; New Hampshire, June 16, 1794; Massachusetts,  June 26, 1794; Vermont, between October 9 and November 9, 1794;  Virginia, November 18, 1794; Georgia, November 29, 1794; Kentucky,  December 7, 1794; Maryland, December 26, 1794; Delaware, January 23,  1795; North Carolina, February 7, 1795; South Carolina, December 4, 1797  [State Department, Press Releases, vol. XII, p. 247 (1935)].    [d] The 12th Amendment was proposed by Congress on December 9, 1803,  when it passed the House [13 Ann. Cong. (8th Cong., 1st sess.) 775,  776], having previously passed the Senate on December 2 [_Id._, 209]. It  was not signed by the presiding officers of the House and Senate until  December 12. It appears officially in 2 Stat. 306. Ratification was  probably completed on June 15, 1804, when the legislature of the  thirteenth State (New Hampshire) approved the amendment, there being  then 17 States in the Union. The Governor of New Hampshire, however,  vetoed this act of the legislature on June 20, and the act failed to  pass again by two-thirds vote then required by the State constitution.  Inasmuch as art. V of the Federal Constitution specifies that amendments  shall become effective \"when ratified by the legislatures of  three-fourths of the several States or by conventions in three-fourths  thereof,\" it has been generally believed that an approval or veto by a  governor is without significance. If the ratification by New Hampshire  be deemed ineffective, then the amendment became operative by  Tennessee's ratification on July 27, 1804. On September 25, 1804, in a  circular letter to the Governors of the several States, Secretary of  State Madison declared the amendment ratified by three-fourths of the  States.    The several State legislatures ratified the 12th Amendment on the  following dates: North Carolina, December 22, 1803; Maryland, December  24, 1803; Kentucky, December 27, 1803; Ohio, between December 5 and  December 30, 1803; Virginia, between December 20, 1803 and February 3,  1804; Pennsylvania, January 5, 1804; Vermont, January 30, 1804; New  York, February 10, 1804; New Jersey, February 22, 1804; Rhode Island,  between February 27 and March 12, 1804; South Carolina, May 15, 1804;  Georgia, May 19, 1804; New Hampshire, June 15, 1804; and Tennessee, July  27, 1804.

Ye are at peace in the troubled stream;       Ho! brave land! with hearts like these,        Thy flag, that is rent in twain,        Shall be one again,       And without a seam!                --Longfellow      The naval battles of the Civil War possess an immense importance,  because they mark the line of cleavage between naval warfare under the  old, and naval warfare under the new, conditions. The ships with  which Hull and Decatur and McDonough won glory in the war of 1812 were  essentially like those with which Drake and Hawkins and Frobisher had  harried the Spanish armadas two centuries and a half earlier. They were  wooden sailing-vessels, carrying many guns mounted in broadside, like  those of De Ruyter and Tromp, of Blake and Nelson. Throughout  this period all the great admirals, all the famous single-ship  fighters,--whose skill reached its highest expression in our own  navy during the war of 1812,--commanded craft built and armed in a  substantially similar manner, and fought with the same weapons and under  much the same conditions. But in the Civil War weapons and methods  were introduced which caused a revolution greater even than that which  divided the sailing-ship from the galley. The use of steam, the casing of  ships in iron armor, and the employment of the torpedo, the ram, and the  gun of high power, produced such radically new types that the old  ships of the line became at one stroke as antiquated as the galleys of  Hamilcar or Alcibiades. Some of these new engines of destruction were  invented, and all were for the first time tried in actual combat, during  our own Civil War. The first occasion on which any of the new methods  were thoroughly tested was attended by incidents which made it one of  the most striking of naval battles.      In Chesapeake Bay, near Hampton Roads, the United States had collected  a fleet of wooden ships; some of them old-style sailing-vessels, others  steamers. The Confederates were known to be building a great iron-clad  ram, and the wooden vessels were eagerly watching for her appearance  when she should come out of Gosport Harbor. Her powers and capacity  were utterly unknown. She was made out of the former United States  steam-frigate Merrimac, cut down so as to make her fore and aft decks  nearly flat, and not much above the water, while the guns were mounted  in a covered central battery, with sloping flanks. Her sides, deck,  and battery were coated with iron, and she was armed with formidable  rifle-guns, and, most important of all, with a steel ram thrust out  under water forward from her bow. She was commanded by a gallant and  efficient officer, Captain Buchanan.    It was March 8, 1862, when the ram at last made her appearance within  sight of the Union fleet. The day was calm and very clear, so that the  throngs of spectators on shore could see every feature of the battle.  With the great ram came three light gunboats, all of which took part in  the action, harassing the vessels which she assailed; but they were  not factors of importance in the fight. On the Union side the vessels  nearest were the sailing-ships Cumberland and Congress, and the  steam-frigate Minnesota. The Congress and Cumberland were anchored not  far from each other; the Minnesota got aground, and was some distance  off. Owing to the currents and shoals and the lack of wind, no other  vessel was able to get up in time to take a part in the fight.    As soon as the ram appeared, out of the harbor, she turned and steamed  toward the Congress and the Cumberland, the black smoke rising from her  funnels, and the great ripples running from each side of her iron prow  as she drove steadily through the still waters. On board of the Congress  and Cumberland there was eager anticipation, but not a particle of fear.  The officers in command, Captain Smith and Lieutenant Morris, were two  of the most gallant men in a service where gallantry has always been  too common to need special comment. The crews were composed of veterans,  well trained, self-confident, and proud beyond measure of the flag whose  honor they upheld. The guns were run out, and the men stood at quarters,  while the officers eagerly conned the approaching ironclad. The Congress  was the first to open fire; and, as her volleys flew, the men on the  Cumberland were astounded to see the cannon-shot bound off the sloping  sides of the ram as hailstones bound from a windowpane. The ram  answered, and her rifle-shells tore the sides of the Congress; but for  her first victim she aimed at the Cumberland, and, firing her bow  guns, came straight as an arrow at the little sloop-of-war, which lay  broadside to her.    It was an absolutely hopeless struggle. The Cumberland was a  sailing-ship, at anchor, with wooden sides, and a battery of light guns.  Against the formidable steam ironclad, with her heavy rifles and steel  ram, she was as powerless as if she had been a rowboat; and from the  moment the men saw the cannon-shot bound from the ram's sides they knew  they were doomed. But none of them flinched. Once and again they fired  their guns full against the approaching ram, and in response received a  few shells from the great bow-rifles of the latter. Then, forging  ahead, the Merrimac struck her antagonist with her steel prow, and the  sloop-of-war reeled and shuddered, and through the great rent in her  side the black water rushed. She foundered in a few minutes; but her  crew fought her to the last, cheering as they ran out the guns, and  sending shot after shot against the ram as the latter backed off after  delivering her blow. The rush of the water soon swamped the lower decks,  but the men above continued to serve their guns until the upper deck  also was awash, and the vessel had not ten seconds of life left. Then,  with her flags flying, her men cheering, and her guns firing, the  Cumberland sank. It was shallow where she settled down, so that her  masts remained above the water. The glorious flag for which the brave  men aboard her had died flew proudly in the wind all that day, while the  fight went on, and throughout the night; and next morning it was still  streaming over the beautiful bay, to mark the resting-place of as  gallant a vessel as ever sailed or fought on the high seas.    After the Cumberland sank, the ram turned her attention to the Congress.  Finding it difficult to get to her in the shoal water, she began to  knock her to pieces with her great rifle-guns. The unequal fight between  the ironclad and the wooden ship lasted for perhaps half an hour. By  that time the commander of the Congress had been killed, and her  decks looked like a slaughterhouse. She was utterly unable to make  any impression on her foe, and finally she took fire and blew up. The  Minnesota was the third victim marked for destruction, and the Merrimac  began the attack upon her at once; but it was getting very late, and as  the water was shoal and she could not get close, the rain finally  drew back to her anchorage, to wait until next day before renewing and  completing her work of destruction.    All that night there was the wildest exultation among the Confederates,  while the gloom and panic of the Union men cannot be described. It  was evident that the United States ships-of-war were as helpless as  cockle-shells against their iron-clad foe, and there was no question  but that she could destroy the whole fleet with ease and with absolute  impunity. This meant not only the breaking of the blockade; but the  sweeping away at one blow of the North's naval supremacy, which was  indispensable to the success of the war for the Union. It is small  wonder that during that night the wisest and bravest should have almost  despaired.    But in the hour of the nation's greatest need a champion suddenly  appeared, in time to play the last scene in this great drama of sea  warfare. The North, too, had been trying its hand at building ironclads.  The most successful of them was the little Monitor, a flat-decked, low,  turreted, ironclad, armed with a couple of heavy guns. She was the first  experiment of her kind, and her absolutely flat surface, nearly level  with the water, her revolving turret, and her utter unlikeness to any  pre-existing naval type, had made her an object of mirth among most  practical seamen; but her inventor, Ericsson, was not disheartened in  the least by the jeers. Under the command of a gallant naval officer,  Captain Worden, she was sent South from New York, and though she almost  foundered in a gale she managed to weather it, and reached the scene  of the battle at Hampton Roads at the moment when her presence was  all-important.    Early the following morning the Merrimac, now under Captain Jones (for  Buchanan had been wounded), again steamed forth to take up the work she  had so well begun and to destroy the Union fleet. She steered straight  for the Minnesota; but when she was almost there, to her astonishment  a strange-looking little craft advanced from the side of the big  wooden frigate and boldly barred the Merrimac's path. For a moment the  Confederates could hardly believe their eyes. The Monitor was tiny,  compared to their ship, for she was not one fifth the size, and her  queer appearance made them look at their new foe with contempt; but the  first shock of battle did away with this feeling. The Merrimac turned on  her foe her rifleguns, intending to blow her out of the water, but  the shot glanced from the thick iron turret of the Monitor. Then the  Monitors guns opened fire, and as the great balls struck the sides of  the ram her plates started and her timbers gave. Had the Monitor been  such a vessel as those of her type produced later in the war, the ram  would have been sunk then and there; but as it was her shot were not  quite heavy enough to pierce the iron walls. Around and around the two  strange combatants hovered, their guns bellowing without cessation,  while"]]]
