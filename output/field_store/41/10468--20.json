Everything about this temple stamps it as the oldest in Sicily. An  inscription on the top step, in very archaic letters, much worn and  difficult to read, contains the name of Apollo in the ancient form....  The inscription may, of course, be later than the temple; but it is in  itself old enough to warrant the supposition that the temple was  erected soon after the first Corinthian colonists established themselves  in the island. While the inscription makes it reasonably certain that  the temple belonged to Apollo, the god under whose guiding hand all  these Dorians went out into these western seas, tradition, with strange  perversity, has given it the name of \"Temple of Diana.\" But it is all in  the family.    Another temple ruin on the edge of the plateau, which begins about two  miles south of the city, across the Anapos, one might also easily  overlook in a casual survey, because it consists only of two columns  without capitals, and a broad extent of the foundations from which the  accumulated earth has been only partially removed. This was the famous  temple of Olympian Zeus, built probably in the days of Hiero I., soon  after the Persian war, but on the site of a temple still more venerable.  One seeks a reason for the location of this holy place at such a  distance from the city. Holm, the German historian of Sicily, argues  with some plausibility that this was no mere suburb of Syracuse, but the  original Syracuse itself. In the first place, the list of the citizens  of Syracuse was kept here down at least to the time of the Athenian  invasion. In the second place, tradition, which, when rightly consulted,  tells so much, says that Archias, the founder of Syracuse, had two  daughters, Ortygia and Syracusa, which may point to two coordinate  settlements, Ortygia and Syracuse; the latter, which was on this temple  plateau, being subsequently merged in the former, but, as sometimes  happens in such cases, giving its name to the combined result.    Besides these temple ruins there are many more foundations that tell a  more or less interesting story. Then there are remains of the ancient  city that can never be ruined--for instance, the great stone quarries,  pits over a hundred feet deep and acres broad, in some of which the  Athenian prisoners were penned up to waste away under the gaze of the  pitiless captors; the Greek theater cut out of the solid rock; the great  altar of Hiero II., six hundred feet long and about half as broad, also  of solid rock. Then there is a mighty Hexapylon, which closed the  fortifications of Dionysius at the northwest at the point where they  challenged attack from the land side. With its sally-ports and rock-hewn  passages, some capacious enough to quarter regiments of cavalry, showing  holes cut in the projecting corners of rock, through which the  hitch-reins of the horses were wont to be passed, and its great  magazines, it stands a lasting memorial to the energy of a tyrant. But  while this fortress is practically indestructible, an impregnable  fortress is a dream incapable of realization. Marcellus and his stout  Romans came in through these fortifications, not entirely, it is true,  by their own might, but by the aid of traitors, against whom no walls  are proof.    One of the stone quarries, the Latomia del Paradiso, has an added  interest from its association with the tyrant who made himself hated as  well as feared, while Gelon was only feared without being hated. An  inner recess of the quarry is called the \"Ear of Dionysius,\" and  tradition says that at the inner end of this recess either he or his  creatures sat and listened to the murmurs that the people uttered  against him, and that these murmurs were requited with swift and fatal  punishment. Certain it is that a whisper in this cave produces a  wonderful resonance, and a pistol shot is like the roar of a cannon; but  that people who had anything to say about the butcher should come up  within ear-shot of him to utter it is not very likely. Historians are  not quite sure that the connection of Dionysius with this recess is  altogether mythical, but that he shaped it with the fell purpose above  mentioned is not to be thought of, as the whole quarry is older than his  time, and was probably, with the Latomia dei Cappuccini, a prison for  the Athenians.          MALTA[41]    BY THEOPHILE GAUTIER      The city of Valetta, founded in 1566, by the grand master whose name it  bears, is the capital of Malta. The city of La Sangle, and the city of  Victoria, which occupy two points of land on the other side of the  harbor of the Marse, together with the suburbs of Floriana and Burmola,  complete the town; encircled by bastions, ramparts, counterscarps,  forts, and fortifications, to an extent which renders siege impossible!  If you follow one of the streets which surround the town, at each step  that you take, you find yourself face to face with a cannon. Gibraltar  itself does not bristle more completely with mouths of fire. The  inconvenience of these extended works is, that they enclose a vast  radius, and demand to defend them, in case of attack, an enormous  garrison; always difficult to maintain at a distance from the mother  country.    From the height of the ramparts, one sees in the distance the blue and  transparent sea, broken into ripples by the breeze, and dotted with  snowy sails. The scarlet sentinels are on guard from point to point, and  the heat of the sun is so fierce upon the glacis, that a cloth stretched  upon a frame and turning upon a pivot at the top of a pole, forms a  shade for the soldiers, who, without this precaution, must inevitably be  roasted on their posts....    The city of Valetta, altho built with regularity, and, so to speak, all  in one \"block,\" is not, therefore, the less picturesque. The decided  slope of the ground neutralizes what the accurate lines of the street  might otherwise have of monotony, and the town mounts by degrees and by  terraces the hillside, which it forms into an amphitheater. The houses,  built very high like those of Cadiz, terminate in flat roofs that their  inhabitants may the better enjoy the sea view. They are all of white  Maltese stone; a sort of sandstone easy to work, and with which, at  small expense, one can indulge various caprices of sculpture and  ornamentation. These rectilinear houses stand well, and have an air of  grandeur, which they owe to the absence of (visible) roofs, cornices,  and attics. They stand out sharply and squarely against the azure of the  heavens, which their dazzling whiteness renders only the more intense;  but that which chiefly gives them a character of originality is the  projecting balcony hung upon each front; like the \"moucharabys\" of the  East, or the \"miradores\" of Spain.    The palace of the grand masters--to-day the palace of the  government--has nothing remarkable in the way of architecture. Its date  is recent, and it responds but imperfectly to the idea one would form of  the residence of Villiers de I'lle Adam, of Lavalette, and of their  warlike ancestors. Nevertheless, it has a certain monumental air, and  produces a fine effect upon the great Place, of which it forms one  entire side. Two doorways, with rustic columns, break the uniformity of  the long facade; while an immense balcony, supported by gigantic  sculptured brackets, encircles the building at the level of the first  floor, and gives to the edifice the stamp of Malta. This detail, so  strictly local in its character, relieves what might be heavy and flat  in this architecture; and this palace, otherwise vulgar, becomes thus  original. The interior, which I visited, presents a range of vast halls  and galleries, decorated with pictures representing battles by sea and  land, sieges, and combats between Turkish galleys and the galleys of the  \"Religion.\" ...    To finish with the knights, I turned my steps toward the Church of St.  John--the Pantheon of the Order. Its facade, with a triangular porch  flanked by two towers terminating in stone belfries, having for ornament  only four pillars, and pierced by a window and door, without sculpture  or decoration, by no means prepares the traveler for the splendor  within.    The first thing which arrests the sight is an immense arch, painted in  fresco, which runs the whole length of the nave. This fresco, unhappily  much deteriorated by time, is the work of Matteo Preti, called the  Calabrese; one of those great second-rate masters, who, if they have  less genius, have often more talent than the princes of the art. What  there is of science, facility, spirit, expression, and abundant  resource, in this colossal picture, is beyond description.    Each section of the arch contains a scene from the life of St. John, to  whom the church is dedicated, and who was the patron of the Order.  These sections are supported, at their descent, by groups of  captives--Saracens, Turks, Christians, and others--half naked, or clad  in the remains of shattered armor, and placed in positions of  humiliation or constraint, who form a species of barbaric caryatides  strikingly suited to the subject. All this part of the fresco is full of  character, and has a force of coloring very rare in this species of  picture. These solid and massive effects give additional strength to the  lighter tone of the arch, and throw the skies into a relief and distance  singularly profound. I know no similar work of equal grandeur except the  ceiling by Fumiana in the Church of St. Pantaleone at Venice,  representing the life, martyrdom, and apotheosis of that saint. But the  style of the decadence makes itself less felt in the work of the  Calabrese than in that of the Venetian. In recompense of this gigantic  work, the artist had the honor, like Carravaggio, to be made a Knight  of the Order.    The pavement of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19068"],[0,"Household Stories (#17)"],[1," had come and picked  them up. Hansel thought they might find the way all the same, but they  could not. They went on all that night, and the next day from the  morning until the evening, but they could not find the way out of the  wood, and they were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but the  few berries they could pick up. And when they were so tired that they  could no longer drag themselves along, they lay down under a tree and  fell asleep.    It was now the third morning since they had left their father's house.  They were always trying to get back to it, but instead of that they only  found themselves farther in the wood, and if help had not soon come they  would have been starved. About noon they saw a pretty snow-white bird  sitting on a bough, and singing so sweetly that they stopped to listen.  And when he had finished the bird spread his wings and flew before them,  and they followed after him until they came to a little house, and the  bird perched on the roof, and when they came nearer they saw that the  house was built of bread, and roofed with cakes; and the window was of  transparent sugar.    \"We will have some of this,\" said Hansel, \"and make a fine meal. I will  eat a piece of the roof, Grethel, and you can have some of the  window--that will taste sweet.\"    So Hansel reached up and broke off a bit of the roof, just to see how it  tasted, and Grethel stood by the window and gnawed at it. Then they  heard a thin voice call out from inside,        \"Nibble, nibble, like a mouse,      Who is nibbling at my house?\"    And the children answered,        \"Never mind,      It is the wind.\"    And they went on eating, never disturbing themselves. Hansel, who found  that the roof tasted very nice, took down a great piece of it, and  Grethel pulled out a large round window-pane, and sat her down and began  upon it. Then the door opened, and an aged woman came out, leaning upon  a crutch. Hansel and Grethel felt very frightened, and let fall what  they had in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and  said,    \"Ah, my dear children, how come you here? you must come indoors and stay  with me, you will be no trouble.\"    So she took them each by the hand, and led them into her little house.  And there they found a good meal laid out, of milk and pancakes, with  sugar, apples, and nuts. After that she showed them two little white  beds, and Hansel and Grethel laid themselves down on them, and thought  they were in heaven.    The old woman, although her behaviour was so kind, was a wicked witch,  who lay in wait for children, and had built the little house on purpose  to entice them. When they were once inside she used to kill them, cook  them, and eat them, and then it was a feast-day with her. The witch's  eyes were red, and she could not see very far, but she had a keen scent,  like the beasts, and knew very well when human creatures were near. When  she knew that Hansel and Grethel were coming, she gave a spiteful laugh,  and said triumphantly,    \"I have them, and they shall not escape me!\"    Early in the morning, before the children were awake, she got up to look  at them, and as they lay sleeping so peacefully with round rosy cheeks,  she said to herself,    \"What a fine feast I shall have!\"    Then she grasped Hansel with her withered hand, and led him into a  little stable, and shut him up behind a grating; and call and scream as  he might, it was no good. Then she went back to Grethel and shook her,  crying,    \"Get up, lazy bones; fetch water, and cook something nice for your  brother; he is outside in the stable, and must be fattened up. And when  he is fat enough I will eat him.\"    Grethel began to weep bitterly, but it was of no use, she had to do what  the wicked witch bade her.    And so the best kind of victuals was cooked for poor Hansel, while  Grethel got nothing but crab-shells. Each morning the old woman visited  the little stable, and cried,    \"Hansel, stretch out your finger, that I may tell if you will soon be  fat enough.\"    Hansel, however, used to hold out a little bone, and the old woman, who  had weak eyes, could not see what it was, and supposing it to be  Hansel's finger, wondered very much that it was not getting fatter. When  four weeks had passed and Hansel seemed to remain so thin, she lost  patience and could wait no longer.    \"Now then, Grethel,\" cried she to the little girl; \"be quick and draw  water; be Hansel fat or be he lean, to-morrow I must kill and cook  him.\"    Oh what a grief for the poor little sister to have to fetch water, and  how the tears flowed down over her cheeks!    \"Dear God, pray help us!\" cried she; \"if we had been devoured by wild  beasts in the wood at least we should have died together.\"    \"Spare me your lamentations,\" said the old woman; \"they are of no  avail.\"    Early next morning Grethel had to get up, make the fire, and fill the  kettle.    \"First we will do the baking,\" said the old woman; \"I have heated the  oven already, and kneaded the dough.\"    She pushed poor Grethel towards the oven, out of which the flames were  already shining.    \"Creep in,\" said the witch, \"and see if it is properly hot, so that the  bread may be baked.\"    And Grethel once in, she meant to shut the door upon her and let her be  baked, and then she would have eaten her. But Grethel perceived her  intention, and said,    \"I don't know how to do it: how shall I get in?\"    \"Stupid goose,\" said the old woman, \"the opening is big enough, do you  see? I could get in myself!\" and she stooped down and put her head in  the oven's mouth. Then Grethel gave her a push, so that she went in  farther, and she shut the iron door upon her, and put up the bar. Oh how  frightfully she howled! but Grethel ran away, and left the wicked witch  to burn miserably. Grethel went straight to Hansel, opened the  stable-door, and cried,    \"Hansel, we are free! the old witch is dead!\"    Then out flew Hansel like a bird from its cage as soon as the door is  opened. How rejoiced they both were! how they fell each on the other's  neck! and danced about, and kissed each other! And as they had nothing  more to fear they went over all the old witch's house, and in every  corner there stood chests of pearls and precious stones.    \"This is something better than flint stones,\" said Hansel, as he filled  his pockets, and Grethel, thinking she also would like to carry  something home with her, filled her apron full.    \"Now, away we go,\" said Hansel;--\"if we only can get out of the witch's  wood.\"    When they had journeyed a few hours they came to a great piece of water.    \"We can never get across this,\" said Hansel, \"I see no stepping-stones  and no bridge.\"    \"And there is no boat either,\" said Grethel; \"but here comes a white  duck; if I ask her she will help us over.\" So she cried,        \"Duck, duck, here we stand,      Hansel and Grethel, on the land,      Stepping-stones and bridge we lack,      Carry us over on your nice white back.\"    And the duck came accordingly, and Hansel got upon her and told his  sister to come too.    \"No,\" answered Grethel, \"that would be too hard upon the duck; we can go  separately, one after the other.\"    And that was how it was managed, and after that they went on happily,  until they came to the wood, and the way grew more and more familiar,  till at last they saw in the distance their father's house. Then they  ran till they came up to it, rushed in at the door, and fell on their  father's neck. The man had not had a quiet hour since he left his  children in the wood; but the wife was dead. And when Grethel opened her  apron the pearls and precious stones were scattered all over the room,  and Hansel took one handful after another out of his pocket. Then was  all care at an end, and they lived in great joy together.    [Illustration:        Sing every one,      My story is done,      And look! round the house      There runs a little mouse,      He that can catch her before she scampers in,      May make himself a very very large fur-cap out of her skin.]    [Illustration:        THE      WHITE SNAKE        \"THEY DIVIDED THE APPLE OF      LIFE AND ATE IT TOGETHER.\"]          THE WHITE SNAKE      A LONG time ago there lived a King whose wisdom was noised abroad in all  the country. Nothing remained long unknown to him, and it was as if the  knowledge of hidden things was brought to him in the air. However, he  had one curious custom. Every day at dinner, after the table had been  cleared and every one gone away, a trusty servant had to bring in one  other dish. But it was covered up, and the servant himself did not know  what was in it, and no one else knew, for the King waited until he was  quite alone before he uncovered it. This had gone on a long time, but at  last there came a day when the servant could restrain his curiosity no  longer, but as he was carrying the dish away he took it into his own  room. As soon as he had fastened the door securely, he lifted the cover,  and there he saw a white snake lying on the dish. After seeing it he  could not resist the desire to taste it, and so he cut off a small piece  and put it in his mouth. As soon as it touched his tongue he heard  outside his window a strange chorus of delicate voices. He went and  listened, and found that it was the sparrows talking together, and  telling each other all they had seen in the fields and woods. The virtue  of the snake had given him power to understand the speech of animals.    Now it happened one day that the Queen lost her most splendid ring, and  suspicion fell upon the trusty servant, who had the general  superintendence, and he was accused of stealing it. The King summoned  him to his presence, and after many reproaches told him that if by the  next day he was not able to name the thief he should be considered  guilty, and punished. It was in vain that he protested his innocence; he  could get no better sentence. In his uneasiness"]]]
