To the Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12) (#17)"],[1,"St. Jean d'Acre; he was proud of it,  and had devised a _ruse de guerre_ by taking advantage of a momentary  weakness to wrest from the French their valuable conquest. With this  view, he had disposed the grand vizier to listen to the overtures  of Kleber. Kleber, on his part, despatched Desaix and Poussielgue as  negotiators to Sir Sidney Smith; for, since the English were masters of  the sea, he wished to induce them to take part in the negotiation,  so that the return to France might be rendered possible. Sir Sidney  manifested a disposition to enter into arrangements, acting as \"Minister  Plenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty,\" and attributing to himself  a power which he had ceased to hold since the arrival of Lord Elgin  as ambassador at Constantinople. Poussielgue was an advocate for  evacuation; Desaix just the reverse. The conditions proposed by Kleber  were unreasonable: not that they were an exorbitant equivalent for what  was given up in giving up Egypt, but because they were not feasible.  Sir Sidney made Kleber sensible of this. Officers treating for a mere  suspension of arms could not include topics of vast extent in their  negotiation, such as the demand for the possession of the Venetian  Islands, and the annulment of the Triple Alliance. But it was urgently  necessary to settle two points immediately: the departure of the wounded  and of the scientific men attached to the expedition, for whom Desaix  solicited safe-conduct; and secondly, a suspension of arms, for the army  of the grand vizier, though marching slowly, would soon be in presence  of the French. It had actually arrived before the fort of El Arish,  the first French post on the frontiers of Syria, and had summoned it to  surrender. The negotiations, in fact, had been going on for a fortnight  on board _Le Tigre_, while floating at the pleasure of the winds off the  coasts of Syria and Egypt: the parties had said all they had to say, and  the negotiations could not be continued to any useful purpose without  the concurrence of the grand vizier. Sir Sidney, availing himself of a  favourable moment, pushed off in a boat which landed him on the coast,  after incurring some danger, and ordered the captain of _Le Tigre_ to  meet him in the port of Jaffa, where Poussielgue and Desaix were to be  put ashore, if the conferences were to be transferred to the camp of the  grand vizier.    At the moment when the English commodore reached the camp, a horrible  event had occurred at El Arish. The grand vizier had collected around  him an army of seventy or eighty thousand fanatic Mussulmans. The  Turks were joined by the Mamluks. Ibrahim Bey, who had some time before  retired to Syria, and Murad Bey, who had descended by a long circuit  from the cataracts to the environs of Suez, had become the auxiliaries  of their former adversaries. The English had made for this army a sort  of field-artillery, drawn by mules. The fort of El Arish, before which  the Turks were at this moment, was, according to the declaration of  General Bonaparte, one of the two keys of Egypt; Alexandria was the  other.    The Turkish advanced-guard having reached El Arish, Colonel Douglas,  an English officer in the service of Turkey, summoned Cazals, the  commandant, to surrender. The culpable sentiments which the officers had  too much encouraged in the army then burst forth. The soldiers in the  garrison at El Arish, vehemently longing, like their comrades, to leave  Egypt, declared to the commandant that they would not fight, and that he  must make up his mind to surrender the fort.    [Illustration: 130.jpg A MODERN FANATIC]    The gallant Cazals indignantly refused, and a struggle with the  Turks ensued. During this contest, the recreants, who insisted on  surrendering, threw ropes to the Turks; these ferocious enemies, once  hoisted up into the fort, rushed, sword in hand, upon those who had  given them admission into the fort, and slaughtered a great number  of them. The others, brought back to reason, joined the rest of the  garrison, and, defending themselves with desperate courage, were most of  them killed. A small number obtained quarter, thanks to that humane and  distinguished officer, Colonel Douglas.    It was now the 30th of December: the letter written by Sir Sidney Smith  to the grand vizier, to propose to him a suspension of arms, had not  reached him in time to prevent the melancholy catastrophe at El Arish.  Sir Sidney Smith was a man of generous feelings: this barbarous massacre  of a French garrison horrified him, and, above all, it made him  fearful of the rupture of the negotiations. He lost no time in sending  explanations to Kleber, both in his own name and that of the grand  vizier, and he added the formal assurance that all hostility should  cease during the negotiations.    Kleber, when informed of the massacre of El Arish, did not manifest as  much indignation as he ought to have done; he was aware that, if he was  too warm upon that subject, all the negotiations might be broken off.  He was more urgent than ever for a suspension of arms; and, at the  same time, by way of precaution, and to be nearer to the theatre of  the conferences, he left Cairo, and transferred his headquarters to  Salahieh, on the very border of the desert, two days' march from El  Arish.    In the meantime, Desaix and Poussielgue, detained by contrary winds,  had not been able to land at Gaza till the 11th, and to reach El Arish  before the 13th.    The evacuation and its conditions soon became the sole subject of  negotiation. After long discussions it was agreed that all hostility  should cease for three months; that those three months should be  employed by the vizier in collecting, in the ports of Rosetta, Abukir,  and Alexandria, the vessels requisite for the conveyance of the French  army; by General Kleber, in evacuating the Upper Nile, Cairo, and the  contiguous provinces, and in concentrating his troops about the point of  embarkation; that the French should depart with the honours of war;  that they should cease to impose contributions; but that, in return,  the French army should receive three thousand purses, equivalent at that  time to three million francs, and representing the sum necessary for its  subsistence during the evacuation and the passage. The forts of Katieh,  Salahieh, and the Belbeys, forming the frontier of Egypt towards the  desert of Syria, were to be given up ten days after the ratification;  Cairo forty days after.    The terms of the convention being arranged, there was nothing more to  be done but sign it. Kleber, who had a vague feeling of his fault,  determined, in order to cover it, to assemble a council of war, to which  all the generals of the army were summoned. The council met on the 21st  of January, 1800. The minutes of it still exist. Desaix, although deeply  grieved, was swept along by the torrent of popular opinion, gave way  to it himself, and affixed his signature on the 28th of January to the  convention of El Arish.    Meanwhile preparations were being made for departure; Sir Sidney Smith  had returned to his ship. The vizier advanced and took possession,  consecutively, of the entrenched positions of Katieh, Salahieh, and  Belbeys, which Kleber, in haste to execute the convention, faithfully  delivered up to him. Kleber returned to Cairo to make his preparations  for departure, to call in the troops that were guarding Upper Egypt, to  concentrate his army, and then to direct it upon Alexandria and Rosetta  at the time stipulated for embarkation.    While these events were occurring in Egypt, the English cabinet had  received advice of the overtures made by General Kleber to the grand  vizier and to Sir Sidney Smith. Believing that the French army was  reduced to the last extremity, it lost no time in sending off an express  order not to grant any capitulation unless they surrendered themselves  prisoners of war. These orders, despatched from London on the 17th of  December, reached Admiral Keith in the island of Minorca in the first  days of January, 1800; and, on the 8th of the same month, the admiral  hastened to forward to Sir Sidney Smith the instructions which he had  just received from the government. He lost no time in writing to Kleber,  to express his mortification, to apprise him honestly of what was  passing, to advise him to suspend immediately the delivery of the  Egyptian fortresses to the grand vizier, and to conjure him to wait  for fresh orders from England before he took any definite resolutions.  Unfortunately, when these advices from Sir Sidney arrived at Cairo, the  French army had already executed in part the treaty of El Arish.    Kleber instantly countermanded all the orders previously given to the  army. He brought back from Lower Egypt to Cairo part of the troops that  had already descended the Nile; he ordered his stores to be sent up  again; he urged the division of Upper Egypt to make haste to rejoin him,  and gave notice to the grand vizier to suspend his march towards Cairo,  otherwise he should immediately commence hostilities. The grand vizier  replied that the convention of El Arish was signed; that it must be  executed; that, in consequence, he should advance towards the capital.  At the same instant, an officer sent from Minorca with a letter from  Lord Keith to Kleber, arrived at the headquarters. Kleber, fired with  indignation at the demand for surrender, caused Lord Keith's letter  to be inserted in the order of the day, adding to it these few words:  \"Soldiers, to such insults there is no other answer than victory.  Prepare for action.\"    Agents from Sir Sidney had hastened up to interpose between the French  and the Turks, and to make fresh proposals of accommodation. Letters,  they said, had just been written to London, and, when the convention of  El Arish was known there, it would be ratified to a certainty; in this  situation, it would not be right to suspend"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17354"],[0,"Cave Regions of the Ozarks and Black Hills (#17)"],[1,"in all stages of  development and suggests a reasonable theory as to the cause of its  origin and variety of development. The volcanic disturbances which have  already been discussed as having been responsible for the various  uplifts and depressions of the Black Hills region, and also for opening  the fissures which gave the cave a beginning, must have supplied the  conditions that were necessary to the formation of box work. And these  preliminary conditions were merely cracks in the rock. By the violence  of earth movement the limestone has been crushed, probably when the land  was undergoing depression, prior to the upheaval which opened the great  parallel fissures. The varying hardness of the rock, as well as  proximity to the surface, would readily account for the difference in  size of the fractures, which is from one-half inch to twelve inches; the  largest being the most distant from the surface. That this crushing was  done before the salt waters retired from the region, which was towards  the close of the Cretaceous Age, is sufficiently evident in the fact  that portions of the Red Beds show similar fractures with the cracks  filled with gypsum, and gypsum, as we have already seen, is a salt  water deposit.    After the crushing was done the cracks in the Carboniferous Limestone  were filled with water heavily charged with calcium carbonate, taken in  solution from the rock, first from pulverized particles, and afterwards  by percolation and contact with exposed surfaces. This calcium carbonate  was slowly deposited in crystalline form, so that in time the cracks  were filled and the crushed rock firmly cemented with calcite seams. But  in the meantime the removal of the calcium carbonate had started  disintegration of the more exposed portions of the rock, which steadily  continuing, finally reduced the porous body between the crystal seams to  a soft clay which was gradually dissolved and carried out through small  imperfections in the thin crystal sheets, leaving the empty box work as  we find it. But where blasting has exposed fresh surfaces, much of the  solid limestone carries the box-like sheets of crystal.    The thinnest box work is seen in the upper levels, from which the waters  retired soonest, and the heaviest and most beautiful is in the Blue  Grotto, on the eighth level where the water remained longest and its  diminished volume became most heavily charged. In many places, however,  there is another heavy variety known as pop-corn box work, which seems  to be an impure lime carbonate not so finely crystallized as the other,  but at the time of my visit no explanation had been given of the manner  of its deposit; and my own theory that it was not formed under water had  nothing to sustain it until, a few weeks later, while visiting Crystal  Cave, the work was found in active progress on surfaces occupying every  position, and the agent was dripping water. In all cases the original  box work has been in thin sheets of calcite, and the heavy varieties are  due to later deposits of calcite and aragonite crystals or, pop corn.    The colors are white, yellow, blue and chocolate brown; the last named  predominating to a great extent in that portion of the cave most easily  traveled by visitors, and forming the ceiling and a part of one wall in  the Post Office, where, as has been said before, it first appears. The  effect is not dreary as might be imagined, and parties are generally  photographed here because one side of the room is white and greatly  assists the flash. This is a smooth, perpendicular wall marking the line  of the fissure and showing the strata of the rock in horizontal position  whitened with a thin coating of carbonate of lime. All visitors are  cordially invited to please themselves in leaving cards, letters or  papers in this chamber, which is reserved for that purpose, and to  refrain from leaving them in other portions of the cave or defacing the  walls with names.    Roe's Misery is a long, narrow passage into which, during the early  times before its size had been increased by blasting, a large man named  Roe crawled to his sorrow. Being larger than the hole he stuck fast, and  neither his own efforts nor those of the guides could relieve the  situation until a rope was sent for, and having been brought, was  securely fastened to his feet, when a long pull and a strong one finally  opened the passage. It is told that he claimed to have reviewed all the  objectionable acts of his life, by which his friends understood that he  occupied the motionless position not less than three weeks.    Red Hall is very nearly described by its name and is quite a showy room,  with the bright red walls contrasting sharply with their limited  ornamentation of pure white carbonate of lime and pearly crystals of  calcite.    Off to one side of Red Hall is a beautiful little chamber called Old  Maids' Grotto, probably on account of its trim appearance and ideal  location. It is so entirely concealed from the view of those passing on  the public highway, that its existence is not even suspected, until  special attention is called to its cosiness, and then it is necessary to  mount an accumulation of great water-rounded rocks in order to obtain  convincing evidence of its actual reality. It is a long, narrow room,  shut in by a straight wall sufficiently high for rigid seclusion, or  protection, without preventing a glimpse of passing events.    A break in the description is made here for the purpose of inserting a  description, written at the author's request, by Mr. E.L. McDonald. He  was generally our special guide. He has chosen to describe the route  taken by the majority of visitors and therefore the balance of my  observations within those limits are omitted.    All who are familiar with those passages and chambers will observe while  reading the next chapter that no imaginary attractions are added to the  existing facts, but many interesting minor points are missing.    Only such changes are made as were agreed to as the condition on which  he would attempt a piece of work so at variance with his usual  occupations.    FOOTNOTES:    [4] U.S. Geological Survey.

THE FAIR GROUNDS ROUTE.    \"At 9:30 in the morning the train bringing health-seekers and tourists  arrives at Hot Springs, a beautiful little city nestled in the  southernmost foot-hills of the world-reputed Black Hills of South  Dakota. The choice of a hotel is soon made, and when located, the  new-comers observe the other guests and acquaint themselves with the  attractions of the resort. Probably during the day they are approached  by the solicitor of the wonderful Wind Cave, who explains that the best  way to reach the cave is by means of the coach and four seen at the  hotel in the morning, and arrangements are made for the following day.  The next morning, seated in the tally-ho coach with strangers who are  soon acquaintances, you start on a beautiful twelve-mile drive to one of  nature's most interesting sights.    \"Immediately after leaving town you begin to admire the scenery and  enjoy the cool, refreshing breezes, wafted from the mountains to the  north, down the slopes to the arid plains.    \"After climbing a gently sloping 'hog-back' for about eight miles, you  are at the top of the divide and one thousand feet higher than Hot  Springs, which may be seen on the left. Looking ahead you can see Harney  Peak, the highest mountain in the Black Hills district; and on the right  you see Buffalo Gap, through which the creek runs that heads at  Min-ne-pa-juta Springs. The Indians used to drive buffalo through this  gap, hence its name. A small but thriving little town to the eastward  takes its name from this Buffalo Gap. From here you begin to go down a  gentle and winding incline to the cave, which is reached all too soon.    \"At the office you register and procure tickets, and then have from  one-half to three-quarters of an hour in which to eat lunch or dine at  the hotel. Then all congregate in the office, from whence the start is  made, after every one has put on a cave cap, _not a suit, as such is  entirely unnecessary_. The guide leads the way to the entrance of the  cave which is separated from the office by some little distance, and is  located in the bed of a long since dry run, which in former times has  bared the carboniferous strata, and within this kind of rock the cave is  found.    \"As the author has asked me for an article descriptive of the cave, I  will only attempt to say something of our medium length route to the  Fair Grounds, or in other words, the Fair Grounds' Route. A collective  description of the whole cave would take months--even years--to  complete. Besides, the above route is the one most used by visitors at  the present time.    \"On entering the Cave House (a log structure) you will in all  probability ask from whence comes the murmur of a waterfall. The guide  answers that it is the rushing current of air at the mouth of the cave,  sometimes in and sometimes out. Prof. J.E. Todd, in bulletin No. 1, S.  Dakota Geological Survey, p. 48, says: 'This phenomenon is found to  correspond with the varying pressure of the barometer, and with its  single opening and capacious chambers is easily accounted for.'    \"The rushing air is sometimes strong enough to require a man's weight to  open the entrance door. Five days and nights is the longest time the  wind has been known to move in one direction without ceasing. This is  one of nature's greatest atmospherical phenomena.    \"Some one says, 'Tickets, please!' and into the hole we go, single file  down a lighted passageway to where we can light our candles. After  descending about one hundred and fifty-five feet we come into the Bridal  Chamber (named by some of the earlier explorers before the present  management took hold of the property), "]]]
