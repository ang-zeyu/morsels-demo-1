[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19354"],[0,"Lessons in Music Form (#17)"],[1,"Song.\"  (Other names, which the student will encounter, are \"maggiore,\"  \"minore,\" \"intermezzo,\" \"alternative,\" etc.).    Like the principal song, its fellow (the subordinate song) may be  either a Two-Part or a Three-Part design.  It is very likely to  resemble its principal song in species of measure, tempo, and general  style; and its key may be the same as that of the principal division,  or, at least, related to it.  But similarity of style is by no means  obligatory, the element of contrast having become more important than  Unity, in a design of such extent.  It is also usually complete in  itself, though its connection with its principal song may involve a few  measures of transitional material.      THE \"DA CAPO.\"--This association of song-forms is subject to the  principle which governs all tripartite forms, namely, the return to the  beginning, and confirmation of the first (or principal) statement; not  only because of the general desirability of such a return, but because  _the necessity for it increases with the growth of the form_.  In a  design that comprises a number of entire song-forms, it may be regarded  as indispensable.    Therefore, the subordinate song is followed by a recurrence of the  principal song,--called the _da capo_ (or \"from the beginning\"),  because of those Italian words of direction given to the player upon  reaching the end of the \"Trio,\" or subordinate song.  The reproduction  of the principal division is likely to be literal, so that the simple  directions \"_da capo_\" suffice, instead of re-writing the entire  division.  But, here again, changes may be made,--generally unimportant  variations which do not obscure the form; or an abbreviation, or even  slight extension.  And a codetta or coda is sometimes added to the  whole.    The Song with Trio is thus seen to correspond to the Three-Part  Song-form, upon a larger scale.  The several _Parts_ of the latter  become complete _Song-forms_.  An important distinction, to which  especial attention must be directed, is the _completeness_ of the  contents of each song-form, and their fairly distinct _separation_ from  each other, in the Song with Trio.  The significance of these traits  will become apparent to the analytic student, as he progresses along  the line of form-evolution into the still larger designs.      LESSON 12.--The following examples all belong to the Song with Trio.  They should be analyzed as usual, each Song separately, defining the  Parts, their form, and other details, as minutely as possible.  Careful  analysis is the first condition of intelligent interpretation; and the  more complete the analysis, the fuller and more authoritative the  interpretation:--    Beethoven, pianoforte sonatas: op. 2, No. 1, third movement; the  divisions are called _Menuetto_ and _Trio_, therefore this is an  authentic type of the present design; each is a complete Three-Part  Song-form; the key is the same, though a change from minor into major  takes place; after the _Trio_, the _Menuetto_ does not re-appear (on  the printed page), but its reproduction is demanded by the words  _Menuetto da capo_, at the end of the Trio.    Op. 2, No. 2, _Scherzo_ and _Trio_.    Op. 2, No. 3, _Scherzo_ and _Trio_.    Op. 7, third movement, _Allegro_ and _Minore_.    Op. 10, No. 2, second movement, _Allegretto_ (the subordinate song is  not marked, but is easily distinguished; there are no _da capo_  directions, because the principal song is re-written, with alterations).    Op. 10, No. 3, _Menuetto_ and _Trio_.    Op. 14, No. 1, second movement.  _Allegretto_ and _Maggiore_; a coda is  added.    Op. 22, _Menuetto_ and _Minore_.    Op. 26, _Scherzo_ and _Trio_.    Op. 27, No. 1, second movement, _Allegro molto_; the Trio is not  marked; the \"_da capo_\" is variated, and a coda follows.    Op. 27, No. 2, _Allegretto_ and _Trio_.    Op. 28, _Scherzo_ and _Trio_.    Op. 31, No. 3, _Menuetto_ and _Trio_.    Schumann, op. 68, No. 11; here there are no outward indications of the  Song with Trio, but that is the design employed; for the subordinate  song the measure is changed from 6-8 to 2-4, but the key remains the  same; the reproduction of the principal song is indicated in German,  instead of Italian.    No. 12, No. 29, No. 39 (here the _da capo_ is considerably changed).    In No. 37 the \"subordinate song\" is represented by no more than a brief  Interlude (measures 33-40) between the principal song and its  recurrence,--just sufficient to provide an occasion for the latter  (which, by the way, is also abbreviated).    Mozart, pianoforte sonatas: No. 2, _Andante cantabile_; each song-form  has two Parts; the subordinate song changes into the minor.    No. 9, second movement, _Menuettos_; the subordinate song is marked  \"Menuetto II,\" a custom probably antedating the use of the word \"Trio\"  (see Bach, 2d English Suite, _Bourree_ I and II).    No. 12, _Menuetto_.    Schubert, _Momens musicals_, op. 94, Nos. 1, 4, and 6.    Schumann, op. 82 (_Waldscenen_), Nos. 7 and 8.    Chopin, _Mazurkas_, Nos. 6, 12, 23, 47, 50.  In Nos. 10, 45, 46 and 51,  the subordinate song consists of one Part only, but is sufficiently  distinct, complete, and separate to leave no doubt of the form.    Also Chopin, _Nocturne_ No. 13 (op. 48, No. 1).    Examples of this compound Song-form will also be found, almost without  exception, in Marches, Polonaises, and similar Dance-forms; and in many  pianoforte compositions of corresponding broader dimensions, which, _if  extended beyond the very common limits of the Three-Part form_, will  probably prove to be Song with Trio.  This the student may verify by  independent analysis of pianoforte literature,--never forgetting that  uncertain examples may need (if small) to be classed among the  group-forms, or (if large) may be suspected of belonging to the higher  forms, not yet explained, and are therefore to be set aside for future  analysis.  Mention must be made of the fact that in some rare cases--as  in Mendelssohn's well-known \"Wedding March\"--_two Trios_, and  consequently two _da capos_, will be found.          CHAPTER XIII.  THE FIRST RONDO-FORM.    EVOLUTION.--It cannot have escaped the observant student of the  foregoing pages, that the successive enlargement of the structural  designs of musical composition is achieved by a process of natural  growth and progressive evolution.  No single form intrudes itself in an  arbitrary or haphazard manner; each design emerges naturally and  inevitably out of the preceding, in response to the necessity of  expansion, and conformably with the same constant laws of unity and  variety,--the active agents, along the entire unbroken line of  continuous evolution, being _reproduction_ (Unity) and legitimate  _modification_ (Variety); or, in other words, _modified repetition_.  It is upon the indisputable evidence of such normal evolution in the  system of musical structure, that our conviction of the legitimacy and  permanence of this system rests.    The diagrams which appear on pages 78 and 98 partly illustrate the line  of evolution, which, in its fullest significance, may be traced as  follows: the _tone_, by the simplest process of reproduction, became a  _figure_; the figure, by multiplication or repetition, gave rise to the  _motive_; the latter, in the same manner, to the _phrase_.  The  repetition of the phrase, upon the infusion of a certain quality and  degree of modification (chiefly affecting the cadences) became the  _period_; the latter, by the same process, became the double-period.  The limit of coherent phrase-succession (without a determined  interruption) being therewith reached, the larger Part-forms became  necessary.  The _Two-Part_ form emerged out of the double-period, the  two \"connected\" periods of which separated into two \"independent\"  Parts, by the determined interruption in the center.  And, be it well  understood, each new design having once been thus established, its  enlargement within its own peculiar boundaries followed as a matter of  course; I mean, simply, that the two Parts did not need to remain the  _periods_ that were their original type; the process of growth cannot  be stopped.  The _Three-Part_ form resulted from adding to the Two-Part  the perfecting reversion to the starting-point, and confirmation of the  principal statement.  The _Five-part_ form, and the _Song with Trio_  are enlargements of the Three-Part forms by repetition or  multiplication; and with the latter the limit of this particular  process appears to be achieved.  Any further growth must take place  from within, rather than by addition from without.    But the process of evolution continues steadily, as the student will  witness.  To one vital fact his attention is here called,--a fact which  he is enjoined to hold in readiness for constant application,--namely,  _that perfection of structural design is attained in the Three-Part  form, and that every larger (or higher) form will have its type in this  design, and its basis upon it_.  The coming designs will prove to be  expansions of the Three-Part form.      THE RONDO-FORMS.--The structural basis of the Rondo, and other larger  or (as they are sometimes called) higher forms, is the Subject or  Theme.  The form and contents of this factor, the Theme, are so  variable that a precise definition can scarcely be given.  It is a  musical sentence of very distinct character, as concerns its melodic,  harmonic and, particularly, its rhythmic consistency; and of sufficient  length to establish this individuality,--seldom, if ever, less than an  entire period or double-period; often a Two-Part, not infrequently a  complete Three-Part Song-form, though never more than the latter.    In the Rondo-forms, two or three such Themes are associated in such  _alternating succession that, after each new Theme, the first or  Principal Theme recurs_.  The term \"Rondo\" may be referred to this  trait, the periodic return of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19368"],[0,"The Mide'wiwin or \"Grand Medicine Society\" of the Ojibwa (#17)"],[1,"bark is sometimes given to relieve pains        and soreness of the chest.      _Prunus Pennsylvanica_, L.

Used        also in conjunction with Ginseng.        This plant, according to some peculiarities, is considered the male        plant at certain seasons of the year, and is given only to men and        boys, while the same plant at other seasons, because of size,        color of fruit, or something else, is termed the female, and is        prepared for women and girls in the following manner, viz: The        roots are rolled in basswood leaves and baked, when they become        black; an infusion is then prepared, and used in a similar manner        as above.        The latter is called Wash/kub[)i]dzhi/bikak[)o]k/.      _Botrychium Virginicum_, Swartz.  Moonwort.  Ozaga/tig[)u]m.        The root is bruised and applied to cuts.      _Aralia trifolia_, Gr.  Dwarf Ginseng.  Nes[-o]/wak[)o]k-- \"Three      Leafed.\"        The roots are chewed and the mass applied to cuts to arrest        hemorrhage.      _Echinospermum lappula_, Lehm.  Stickweed.  Ozaga/t[)i]gom[)e][n]s--      \"Burr Bush.\"        The roots are placed in a hole in the ground upon hot stones, to        cause the fumes to rise, when the patient puts down his face and        has a cloth or blanket thrown over his head. The fumes are inhaled        for headache. The raw roots are also sniffed at for the same        purpose.    It is affirmed by various members of the Mid[-e]/ Society that in former  times much of the information relating to some of these plants was not  imparted to a candidate for initiation into the first degree, but was  reserved for succeeding degrees, to induce a Mid[-e]/ of the first  degree to endeavor to attain higher distinction and further advancement  in the mysteries of the order. As much knowledge is believed to have  been lost through the reticence and obstinacy of former chief priests,  the so-called higher secrets are now imparted at the first and second  degree preparatory instructions. The third and fourth degrees are very  rarely conferred, chiefly because the necessary presents and fees are  beyond the reach of those who so desire advancement, and partly also  because the missionaries, and in many instances the Indian agents, have  done their utmost to suppress the ceremonies, because they were a direct  opposition and hindrance to progress in Christianizing influences.    When the preparatory instruction has come to an end and the day of the  ceremony of initiation is at hand, the preceptor sings to his pupil a  song, expatiating upon his own efforts and the high virtue of the  knowledge imparted. The pipe is brought forward and an offering of  tobacco smoke made by both preceptor and pupil, after which the former  sings a song (Pl. X, A.), the time of its utterance being tediously  prolonged. The mnemonic characters were drawn by Sikas/sig[)e], and are  a copy of an old birch-bark scroll which has for many years been in his  possession, and which was made in imitation of one in the possession of  his father, Bai[-e]/dz[)i]k, one of the leading Mid[-e]/ at Mille Lacs,  Minnesota.
