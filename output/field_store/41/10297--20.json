The  exceptionally talented man knows anyhow where he belongs, and the  exceptionally untalented one will be excluded anyhow. The  psychological aid in the selection of the fit refers only to the  remaining four fifths of mankind for whom the chances of success can  indeed be increased as soon as the psychological personal equation is  systematically and with scientific exactitude brought into the  calculation of the life development. How far a part of this effort  will have to be undertaken by the school is a social problem which  must be considered from various points of view. Its discussion would  lead us beyond the limits of our present inquiry, but it seems  probable that the real psychological laboratory experiment in the  service of vocational guidance does not belong in the schoolroom  itself, but ought to be left to special municipal institutions.          XII    INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS      One point here must not be overlooked. The effort to discover the  personal structure of the individual in the interest of his vocational  chance does not always necessarily involve a direct analysis of his  individuality, as material of some value can be gained indirectly.  Such indirect knowledge of a man's mental traits may be secured first  of all through referring the man to the groups to which he belongs and  inquiring into the characteristic traits of those groups. The  psychology of human variations gives not only an account of the  differences from person to person, but studies no less the psychical  inequalities of the races, of the nations, of the ages, of the  professions, and so on. If an economic activity demands a combination  of mental traits, we may take it for granted that an individual will  be fit for the work as soon as we find out that he belongs to a group  in which these required mental traits habitually occur. Such a  judgment based on group psychology can of course be no more than a  mere approach to a solution of the problem, as the psychical qualities  may vary strongly in the midst of the group. The special individual  may happen to stand at the extreme limit of the group, and the traits  which are usually characteristic of it may be very little developed or  entirely lacking in his special case. We may know that the inhabitants  of a special country are rather alert, and yet the particular  individual with whom we have to deal may be clumsy and phlegmatic. The  interests of economy will, therefore, be served by such considerations  of group psychology only if the employment, not of a single person,  but of a large number, is in question, as it is most probable that the  average character will show itself in a sufficient degree as soon as  many members of the group are involved.    Even in this case the presupposition ought to be that the average  characteristics found out with scientific exactitude by statistical  and experimental methods, and not that they are simply deduced from  superficial impressions. I have found that just this race  psychological diagnosis is frequently made in factories with great  superficiality. Some of the American industrial centres offer  extremely favorable conditions for the comparative study of  nationality. I have visited many manufacturing establishments in which  almost all workers are immigrants from foreign countries and in which  up to twenty different nationalities are represented. The employment  officers there easily develop some psychological theories on the  basis of which they are convinced that they are selecting the men with  especial skill, knowing for each in which department he will be most  successful. They consider it settled that for a particular kind of  activity the Italians are the best, and for another, the Irish, and  for a third, the Hungarians, and for a fourth, the Russian Jews. But  as soon as these factory secrets have been revealed, you may be  surprised to find that in the next factory a decidedly different  classification of the wage-earners is in force. In a gigantic  manufacturing concern, I received the definite information that the  Swedish laborers are preferable wherever a steady eye is needed, and  in another large factory on the same street I was assured that just  the Swedes are unfit for such work. Sometimes this diversity of  opinion is the result of different points of view. In one factory in  which a certain industrial operation is rather dangerous, they told me  that they took no southern Europeans, especially no Italians and  Greeks, because they are too hasty and careless in their movements,  while they gladly filled the places with Irishmen. In a quite similar  factory, on the other hand, they had a prejudice against the Irishmen  alone for this work, because the Irish laborers are too willing to run  a risk and to expose themselves to danger. Probably both  psychological observations are on the whole correct, but in the first  factory only the one and in the second factory only the other was  recognized. Much more thorough statistical inquiries than those which  as yet exist, especially as to the actual differences of wages and  piecework for wage-earners of various nationalities, would have to  furnish a basis for such race psychological statements, until the time  arrives when the psychological experiment comes to its own.    In a similar way so far we have to rely on general theories of group  psychology when the psychological differences of the sexes are to be  reckoned with in economic interests. So long as laboratory methods for  individual tests are not usual, the mental analysis of the general  groups of men and women must form the background for industrial  decisions. To be sure, it is not difficult to emphasize certain mental  traits as characteristic of women in general in contrast to men in  general, and to relate them to certain fundamental tendencies of their  psychophysical organism. As soon as this is done, it is easy  theoretically to deduce that certain industrial functions are  excellently adapted to the minds of women and that certain others  stand in striking antagonism to them. If the employment of large  numbers is in question, and average values alone are involved, such a  decision on the basis of group psychology may be adequate. In most  factories this vague sex psychology, to be sure, usually with a strong  admixture of wage questions, suggests for which machines men and for  which women ought to be employed. But here again it is not at all  improbable that in the case of a particular woman the traditional  group value may be entirely misleading and the personality accordingly  unfit for the place. Only the subtle psychological individual analysis  can overcome the superficial prejudices of group psychology. The  situation lies differently when problems of economic policy are before  us. Such general policies as, for instance, colonial politics, or  immigration politics, or politics concerned with city and rural  communities, or with coast and mountain population, will always have  to be based on group psychology as far as the economic problems are  involved, inasmuch as they refer to the average and not to the  individual, differences.    Finally, another indirect scheme to determine the personal qualities  needed for economic efficiency may be suggested by the psychology of  the typical correlations of human traits. We have seen that group  psychology proclaims that a certain individual probably has certain  traits because he belongs to this or that nation or to this or that  otherwise well-known group. Correlation psychology proclaims that a  particular individual possesses or does not possess certain traits  because he shows or does not show some other definite qualities. A  correlation, for instance, which the commercial world often  presupposes, may exist between individual traits and the handwriting.  Graphologists are convinced that a certain loop or flourish, or the  steepness or the length of the letters, or the position of the _i_  dot, is a definite indication that the writer possesses certain  qualities of personality; and if just these qualities are essential  requirements for the position, the impression of the handwriting in a  letter may be taken as a sufficient basis for appointment. The  scientist has reason to look upon this particular case of  graphological correlation with distrust. Yet even he may acknowledge  that certain correlations exist between the neatness, carefulness,  uniformity energy, and similar features of the letter, and the general  carefulness, steadiness, neatness, and energy of the personality.    However, the laboratory psychologists nowadays have gone far beyond  such superficial claims for correlations of symptoms. With  experimental and statistical methods they have gathered ample material  which demonstrates the exact degree of probability with which we have  a right to expect that certain qualities will occur together.  Theoretically we may take it for granted that those traits which are  always present together or absent together ultimately have a common  mental root. Yet practically they appear as two independent traits,  and therefore it remains important to know that, if we can find one of  them, we may be sure that the other will exist there too. Inasmuch as  the one of the two traits may be easily detected, while the other may  be hidden and can be found out only by long careful tests, it would be  valuable, indeed, for the employment manager to become acquainted with  such correlations as the psychologist may discover: as soon as he  becomes aware of the superficially noticeable symptom, he can foresee  that the other disposition is most probably present. To give an  illustration: in the interest of such measurements of correlations we  have studied in the Harvard laboratory the various characteristics of  attention and their mutual dependence.[18] We found that typical"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15164"],[0,"Folk Tales Every Child Should Know (#17)"],[1,"found with him a beautiful black gelding. And  so for ten nights, he left the horse among the hills, and each morning  he found a different coloured horse, a bay, a roan, a gray, a blue, a  spotted horse, and all of them finer than any horses that the Pawnees  had ever had in their tribe before.    Now the boy was rich, and he married the beautiful daughter of the Head  Chief, and when he became older he was made Head Chief himself. He had  many children by his beautiful wife, and one day when his oldest boy  died, he wrapped him in the spotted calf robe and buried him in it. He  always took good care of his old grandmother, and kept her in his own  lodge until she died. The dun horse was never ridden except at feasts,  and when they were going to have a doctors' dance, but he was always led  about with the Chief wherever he went. The horse lived in the village  for many years, until he became very old. And at last he died.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 7: From \"Pawnee Hero Stories and Folk Tales.\" Copyright, 1890,  by George Bird Grinnell; published by Charles Scribner's Sons.]          XVII    THE GREEDY YOUNGSTER      Once upon a time there were five women who were in a field reaping corn.  None of them had any children, but they were all wishing for a child.  All at once they found a big goose egg, almost as big as a man's head.    \"I saw it first,\" said one. \"I saw it just as soon as you did,\" shouted  another. \"But I'll have it,\" screamed the third, \"I saw it first of  all.\"    Thus they kept on quarrelling and fighting about the egg, and they were  very near tearing each other's hair. But at last they agreed that it  should belong to them all, and that they should sit on it as the geese  do and hatch a gosling. The first woman sat on it for eight days, taking  it very comfortably and doing nothing at all, while the others had to  work hard both for their own and her living. One of the women began to  make some insinuations to her about this.    \"Well, I suppose you didn't come out of the egg either before you could  chirp,\" said the woman who was on the egg, \"But I think there is  something in this egg, for I fancy I can hear some one inside grumbling  every other moment: 'Herring and soup! Porridge and milk!' You can come  and sit for eight days now, and then we will sit and work in turn, all  of us.\"    So when the fifth in turn had sat for eight days, she heard plainly some  one inside the egg screeching for \"Herring and soup! Porridge and milk!\"  And so she made a hole in it; but instead of a gosling out came a baby,  but it was awfully ugly, and had a big head and a tiny little body. The  first thing it screamed out for, as soon as it put its head outside the  egg, was \"Herring and soup! Porridge and milk!\" And so they called it  \"the greedy youngster.\"    Ugly as he was, they were fond of him at first; but before long he  became so greedy that he ate up all the meat they had. When they boiled  a dish of soup or a pot of porridge which they thought would be  sufficient for all six, he finished it all by himself. So they would not  have him any longer.    \"I have not had a decent meal since this changeling crept out of the  eggshell,\" said one of them, and when the youngster heard that they were  all of the same opinion, he said he was quite willing to go his way; \"if  they did not want him, he was sure he did not want them,\" and with that  he left the place.    After a long time he came to a farm where the fields were full of  stones, and he went in and asked for a situation. They wanted a labourer  on the farm, and the farmer put him to pick up stones from the field.  Yes, the youngster went to work and picked up the stones, some of which  were so big that they would make many cartloads; but whether they were  big or small, he put them all into his pocket. It did not take him long  to finish that job, so he wanted to know what he should do next.    \"You will have to get all the stones out of the field,\" said the farmer.  \"I suppose you can't be ready before you have commenced?\"    But the youngster emptied his pockets and threw all the stones in a  heap. Then the farmer saw that he had finished the work, and he thought  he ought to look well after one who was so strong. He must come in and  get something to eat, he said. The youngster thought so too, and he  alone ate what was prepared both for master and servants, and still he  was only half satisfied.    \"He is the right sort of man for a labourer, but he is a terrible eater,  to be sure,\" thought the farmer. \"A man like him would eat a poor farmer  out of house and home before anybody knew a word about it,\" he said. He  had no more work for him; it was best for him to go to the king's  palace.    The youngster set out for the palace, where he got a place at once.  There was plenty of food and plenty of work. He was to be errand boy,  and to help the girls to carry wood and water and do other odd jobs. So  he asked what he was to do first.    \"You had better chop some wood in the mean time,\" they said. Yes, he  commenced to chop and cut wood till the splinters flew about him. It was  not long before he had chopped up everything in the place, both firewood  and timber, both rafters and beams, and when he was ready with it, he  came in and asked what he was to do now.    \"You can finish chopping the wood,\" they said.    \"There is no more to chop,\" he answered.    That could not be possible, thought the overlooker, and had a look into  the wood-shed. But yes, the youngster had chopped up everything; he had  even cut up the timber and planks in the place. This was vexatious, the  overlooker said; and then he told the youngster that he should not taste  food until he had gone into the forest and cut just as much timber as he  had chopped up for firewood.    The youngster went to the smithy and got the smith to help him to make  an axe of five hundredweight of iron, and then he set out for the forest  and began to make a regular clearance, not only of the pine and the  lofty fir trees, but of everything else which was to be found in the  king's forests, and in the neighbours' as well. He did not stop to cut  the branches or the tops off, but he left them lying there as if a  hurricane had blown them down. He put a proper load on the sledge and  put all the horses to it, but they could not even move it; so he took  the horses by the heads to give the sledge a start, but he pulled so  hard that the horses' heads came off. He then turned the horses out of  the shafts and drew the load himself.    When he came to the palace, the king and his overlooker were standing in  the hall to give him a scolding for having destroyed the forest--the  overlooker had been there and seen what he had been doing. But when the  king saw the youngster dragging half the forest after him, he got both  angry and afraid; but he thought he had better be a little careful with  him, since he was strong.    \"Well, you are a wonderful workman, to be sure,\" said the king; \"but how  much do you eat at a time, because I suppose you are hungry now?\"    Oh, when he was to have a proper meal of porridge, it would take twelve  barrels of meal to make it, thought the youngster; but when he had put  that away, he could wait awhile, of course, for his next meal.    It took some time to boil such a dish of porridge, and meantime he was  to bring in a little firewood for the cook. He put a lot of wood on a  sledge, but when he was coming through the door with it he was a little  rough and careless again. The house got almost out of shape, and all the  joists creaked; he was very near dragging down the whole palace. When  the porridge was nearly ready, they sent him out to call the people home  from the fields. He shouted so that the mountains and hills around rang  with echoes, but the people did not come quick enough for him. He came  to blows with them, and killed twelve of them.    \"You have killed twelve men,\" said the king; \"and you eat for many times  twelve; but how many do you work for?\"    \"For many times twelve as well,\" answered the youngster.    When he had finished his porridge, he was to go into the barn to thrash.  He took one of the rafters from the roof and made a flail out of it, and  when the roof was about to fall in, he took a big pine tree with  branches and all and put it up instead of the rafter. So he went on  thrashing the grain and the straw and the hay all together. This was  doing more damage than good, for the corn and the chaff flew about  together, and a cloud of dust arose over the whole palace.    When he had nearly finished thrashing, enemies came into the country, as  a war was coming on. So the king told the youngster that he should take  men with him to go and meet the enemy and fight them, for the king  thought they would surely kill him.    No, he would not have any men with him to be cut to pieces; he would  fight by himself, answered the youngster.    \"So much the better,\" thought the king; \"the sooner I shall get rid of  him; but he must have a proper club.\"    They sent for the smith; he forged a club which weighed a hundredweight.  \"A very nice thing to crack nuts with,\" said the youngster. So the smith  made one of three hundredweight. \"It would be very well for hammering  nails into boots,\" was the answer. Well, the smith could not make a  bigger one with the men he had. So the youngster set out for the smithy  himself, and made a club that weighed five tons, and it took a hundred  men to turn it on the anvil. \"That one might do for lack of a better,\"  thought the youngster. He wanted next a bag with some provisions; they  had to make one out of fifteen oxhides, and they filled it with food,  and away he went down the hill with the bag on his back and the club on  his shoulder.    When he came so far that the enemy saw him, they sent a soldier to ask  him if he was going to fight them.    \"Yes; but wait a little till I have had something to eat,\" "]]]
