It was real. It  was terribly real, the way that team was fleeing down the grade. She had  never seen anything like that before, never seen horses so frantically  trying to run from the swaying load behind them. Always, she had been  accustomed to moderation in the pace and a slowed camera to speed up the  action on the screen. Yellowjacket, too--she had never ridden at that  terrific speed down hill. Twice she lost a stirrup and grabbed the  saddle horn to save herself from going over his head.    They neared a sharp turn, and it took all her strength to pull her horse  to the inside and save him from plunging off down the canyon's side. The  nose of the hill hid for a moment her dad, and in that moment she heard  a crash and knew what had happened. But she could not stop; Yellowjacket  had his ears laid back flat on his senseless head, and the bit clamped  tight in his teeth.    She heard the crash repeated in diminuendo farther down in the canyon.  There was no longer the rattle of the wagon coming down the trail, the  sharp staccato of pounding hoofs.          CHAPTER ELEVEN    SWAN TALKS WITH HIS THOUGHTS      Lorraine, following instinct rather than thought, pulled Yellowjacket  into the first opening that presented itself. This was a narrow, rather  precipitous gully that seamed the slope just beyond the bend. The bushes  there whipped her head and shoulders cruelly as the horse forged in  among them, but they trapped him effectually where the gully narrowed to  a point. He stopped perforce, and Lorraine was out of the saddle and  running down to the trail before she quite realized what she was doing.    At the bend she looked down, saw the marks where the wagon had gone  over, scraping rocks and bushes from its path. Fence posts were strewn  at all angles down the incline, and far down a horse was standing with  part of the harness on him and with his head drooping dispiritedly. Her  father she could not see, nor the other horse, nor the wagon. A clump  of young trees hid the lower declivity. Lorraine did not stop to think  of what she would find down there. Sliding, running, she followed the  traces of the wreck to where the horse was standing. It was Caroline,  looking very dejected but apparently unhurt, save for skinned patches  here and there where she had rolled over rocks.    A little farther, just beyond the point of the grove which they seemed  to have missed altogether, lay the other horse and what was left of the  wagon. Brit she did not see at all. She searched the bushes, looked  under the wagon, and called and called.    A full-voiced shout answered her from farther up the canyon, and she ran  stumbling toward the sound, too agonized to shed tears or to think very  clearly. It was not her father's voice; she knew that beyond all doubt.  It was no voice that she had ever heard before. It had a clear resonance  that once heard would not have been easily forgotten. When she saw them  finally, her father was being propped up in a half-sitting position, and  the strange man was holding something to his lips.    \"Just a little water. I carry me a bottle of water always in my pocket,\"  said Swan, glancing up at her when she had reached them. \"It sometimes  makes a man's head think better when he has been hurt, if he can drink a  little water or something.\"    Brit swallowed and turned his face away from the tilted bottle. \"I  jumped--but I didn't jump quick enough,\" he muttered thickly. \"The chain  pulled loose. Where's the horses, Raine?\"    \"They're all right. Caroline's standing over there. Are you hurt much,  dad?\" It was a futile question, because Brit was already going off into  unconsciousness.    \"He's hurt pretty bad,\" Swan declared honestly, looking up at her with  his eyes grown serious. \"I was across the walley and I saw him coming  down the road like rolling rocks down a hill. I came quick. Now we make  stretcher, I think, and carry him home. I could take him on my back, but  that is hurting him too much.\" He looked at her--through her, it seemed  to Lorraine. In spite of her fear, in spite of her grief, she felt that  Swan was reading her very soul, and she backed away from him.    \"I could help your father very much,\" he said soberly, \"but I should  tell you a secret if I do that. I should maybe ask that you tell a lie  if somebody asks questions. Could you do that, Miss?\"    \"Lie?\" Lorraine laughed uncertainly. \"I'd _kill_!--if that would help  dad.\"    Swan was folding his coat very carefully and placing it under Brit's  head. \"My mother I love like that,\" he said, without looking up. \"My  mother I love so well that I talk with my thoughts to her sometimes. You  believe people can talk with their thoughts?\"    \"I don't know--what's that got to do with helping dad?\" Lorraine knelt  beside Brit and began stroking his forehead softly, as is the soothing  way of women with their sick.    \"I could send my thought to my mother. I could say to her that a man is  hurt and that a doctor must come very quickly to the Quirt ranch. I  could do that, Miss, but I should not like it if people knew that I did  it. They would maybe say that I am crazy. They would laugh at me, and it  is not right to laugh at those things.\"    \"I'm not laughing. If you can do it, for heaven's sake go ahead! I don't  believe it, but I won't tell any one, if that's what you want.\"    \"If some neighbors should ask, 'How did that doctor come so quick?'----\"    \"I'd rather lie and say I sent for him, than say that you or any one  else sent a telepathic message. That would sound more like a lie than a  lie would. How are we going to make a stretcher? We've got to get him  home, somehow----\"    \"At my cabin is blankets,\" Swan told her briskly. \"I can climb the  hill--it is up there. In a little while I will come back.\"    He started off without waiting to see what Lorraine would have to say  about it, and with some misgivings she watched him run down to the  canyon's bottom and go forging up the opposite side with a most amazing  speed and certainty. In travel pictures she had seen mountain sheep  climb like that, and she likened him now to one of them. It seemed a  shame that he was a bit crazy, she thought; and immediately she recalled  his perfect assurance when he told her of sending thought messages to  his mother. She had heard of such things, she had even read a little on  the subject, but it had never seemed to her a practical means of  communicating. Calling a doctor, for instance, seemed to Lorraine  rather far-fetched an application of what was at best but a debatable  theory.    Considering the distance, he was back in a surprisingly short time with  two blankets, a couple of light poles and a flask of brandy. He seemed  as fresh and unwinded as if he had gone no farther than the grove, and  he wore, more than ever, his air of cheerful assurance.    \"The doctor will be there,\" he remarked, just as if it were the simplest  thing in the world. \"We can carry him to Fred Thurman's. There I can get  horses and a wagon, and you will not have to carry so far. And when we  get to your ranch the doctor will be there, I think. He is starting now.  We will hurry. I will fix it so you need not carry much. It is just to  make it steady for me.\"    While he talked he was working on the stretcher. He had a rope, and he  was knotting it in a long loop to the poles. Lorraine wondered why,  until he had lifted her father and placed him on the stretcher and  placed the loop over his own head and under one arm, as a ploughman  holds the reins, so that his hands may be free.    \"If you will carry the front,\" said Swan politely, \"it will not be  heavy for you like this. But you will help me keep it steady.\"    Lorraine was past discussing anything. She obeyed him silently, lifting  the end of the stretcher and leading the way down to the canyon's  bottom, where Swan assured her they could walk quite easily and would  save many detours which the road above must take. At the bottom Swan  stopped her so that he might shorten the rope and take more of the  weight on his shoulders. She protested half-heartedly, but Swan only  laughed.    \"I am strong like a mule,\" he said. \"You should see me wrestle with  somebody. Clear over my head--I can carry a man in my hands. This is so  you can walk fast. Three miles straight down we come to Thurman's ranch,  where I get the horses. It's funny how hills make a road far around.  Just three miles--that's all. I have walked many times.\"    Lorraine did not answer him. She felt that he was talking merely to keep  her from worrying, and she was fairly sick with anxiety and did not hear  half of what he was saying. She was nervously careful about choosing her  steps so that she would not stumble and jolt her father. She did not  believe that he was wholly unconscious, for she had seen his eyelids  tighten and his lips twitch several times, when she was waiting for  Swan. He had seemed to be in pain and to be trying to hide the fact from  her. She felt that Swan knew it, else he would have talked of her dad,  would at least have tried to reassure her. But it is difficult to speak  of a person who hears what you are saying, and Swan was talking of  everything, it seemed to her, except the man they were carrying.    She wondered if it were really true that Swan had sent a call through  space for a doctor; straightway she would call herself crazy for even  considering for a moment its possibility. If he could do that--but of  course he couldn't. He must just imagine it.    Many times Swan had her lower the stretcher to the ground, and would  make a great show of rubbing his arms and easing his shoulder muscles.  Whenever Lorraine looked full into his face he would grin at her as  though nothing was wrong, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19172"],[0,"An Australian in China (#17)"],[1,"and commands a noble view of mountain, valley, and river. Its largest  hong is the coffin-maker's, which is always filled with shells of the  thickest timber that money can buy.    Stress is laid in China upon the necessity of a secure resting-place  after death. The filial affection of a son can do no more thoughtful act  than present a coffin to his father, to prove to him how composedly he  will lie after he is dead. And nothing will a father in China show the  stranger with more pride than the coffin-boards presented to him by his  dutiful son.    Tak-wan-leo is the highest point on the road between Suifu and Chaotong.  For centuries it has been known to the Chinese as the highest point;  how, then, with their defective appliances did they arrive at so  accurate a determination? Twenty li beyond the village the stage ends at  the town of Tawantzu, where I had good quarters in the pavilion of an  old temple. The shrine was thick with the dust of years; the three gods  were dishevelled and mutilated; no sheaves of joss sticks were  smouldering on the altar. The steps led down into manure heaps and a  piggery, into a garden rank and waste, which yet commands an outlook  over mountain and river worthy of the greatest of temples.    [Illustration: THE OPIUM-SMOKER OF ROMANCE.]    On March 30th I reached Tak-wan-hsien, the day's stage having been  seventy li (twenty-three and one-third miles). I was carried all the way  by three chair-coolies in a heavy chair in steady rain that made the  unpaved track as slippery as ice--and this over the dizzy heights of a  mountain pathway of extraordinary irregularity. Never slipping, never  making a mistake, the three coolies bore the chair with my thirteen  stone, easily and without straining. From time to time they rested a  minute or two to take a whiff of tobacco; they were always in good  humour, and finished the day as strong and fresh as when they began it.  Within an hour of their arrival all these three men were lying on their  sides in the room opposite to mine, with their opium-pipes and little  wooden vials of opium before them, all three engaged in rolling and  heating in their opium-lamps treacly pellets of opium. Then they had  their daily smoke of opium. \"They were ruining themselves body and  soul.\" Two of the men were past middle age; the third was a strapping  young fellow of twenty-five. They may have only recently acquired the  habit, I had no means of asking them; but those who know Western China  will tell you that it is almost certain that the two elder men had used  the opium-pipe as a stimulant since they were as young as their  companion. All three men were physically well-developed, with large  frames, showing unusual muscular strength and endurance, and differed,  indeed, from those resurrected corpses whose fleshless figures, drawn by  imaginative Chinese artists, we have known for years to be typical of  our poor lost brothers--the opium-smoking millions of China. For their  work to-day, work that few men out of China would be capable of  attempting, the three coolies were paid sevenpence each, out of which  they found themselves, and had to pay as well one penny each for the  hire of the chair.    On arriving at the inn in Tak-wan-hsien my estimable comrade, one of the  six surviving converts of Suifu, indicated to me that his cash belt was  empty--up the road he could not produce a single cash for me to give a  beggar--and pointing in turn to the bag where I kept my silver, to the  ceiling and to his heart, he conveyed to me the pious assurance that if  I would give him some silver from the bag he would bring me back the  true change, on his honour, so witness Heaven! I gave him two lumps of  silver which I made him understand were worth 3420 cash; he went away,  and after a suspicious absence returned quite gleefully with 3050 cash,  the bank, no doubt, having detained the remainder pending the  declaration of a bogus dividend. But he also brought back with him what  was better than cash, some nutritious maize-meal cakes, which proved a  welcome change from the everlasting rice. They were as large as an  English scone, and cost two cash apiece, that is to say, for one  shilling I could buy twenty dozen.    Money in Western China consists of solid ingots of silver, and copper  cash. The silver is in lumps of one tael or more each, the tael being a  Chinese ounce and equivalent roughly to between 1400 and 1500 cash.  Speaking generally a tael was worth, during my journey, three shillings,  that is to say, forty cash were equivalent to one penny. There are  bankers in every town, and the Chinese methods of banking, it is well  known, are but little inferior to our own. From Hankow to Chungking my  money was remitted by draft through a Chinese bank. West from Chungking  the money may be sent by draft, by telegraph, or in bullion, as you  choose. I carried some silver with me; the rest I put up in a package  and handed to a native post in Chungking, which undertook to deliver it  intact to me at Yunnan city, 700 miles away, within a specified time. By  my declaring its contents and paying the registration fee, a mere  trifle, the post guaranteed its safe delivery, and engaged to make good  any loss. Money is thus remitted in Western China with complete  confidence and security. My money arrived, I may add, in Yunnan at the  time agreed upon, but after I had left for Talifu. As there is a  telegraph line between Yunnan and Tali, the money was forwarded by  telegraph and awaited my arrival in Tali.    There are no less than four native post-offices between Chungking and  Suifu. All the post-offices transmit parcels, as well as letters and  bullion, at very moderate charges. The distance is 230 miles, and the  charges are fifty cash (_1-1/4d._) the catty (1-1/3lb.), or any part  thereof; thus a single letter pays fifty cash, a catty's weight of  letters paying no more than a single letter.    From Chungking to Yunnan city, a distance of 630 miles, letters pay two  hundred cash (fivepence) each; packages of one catty, or under, pay  three hundred and fifty cash; while for silver bullion there is a  special fee of three hundred and fifty cash for every ten taels,  equivalent to ninepence for thirty shillings, or two-and-a-half per  cent., which includes postage registration, guarantee, and insurance.    Tak-wan-hsien is a town of some importance, and was formerly the seat of  the French missionary bishop. It is a walled town, ranking as a Hsien  city, with a Hsien magistrate as its chief ruler. There are 10,000  people (more or less), within the walls, but the city is poor, and its  poverty is but a reflex of the district. Its mud wall is crumbling; its  houses of mud and wood are falling; the streets are ill-paved and the  people ill-clad.          CHAPTER VIII.    THE CITY OF CHAOTONG, WITH SOME REMARKS ON ITS POVERTY, INFANTICIDE,  SELLING FEMALE CHILDREN INTO SLAVERY, TORTURES, AND THE CHINESE  INSENSIBILITY TO PAIN.      By the following day we had crossed the mountains, and were walking  along the level upland that leads to the plain of Chaotong. And on  Sunday, April 1st, we reached the city. Cedars, held sacred, with  shrines in the shelter of their branches, dot the plain; peach-trees and  pear-trees were now in full bloom; the harvest was ripening in the  fields. There were black-faced sheep in abundance, red cattle with short  horns, and the ubiquitous water-buffalo. Over the level roads primitive  carts, drawn by red oxen, were rumbling in the dust. There were mud  villages, poor and falling into ruins; there were everywhere signs of  poverty and famine. Children ran about naked, or in rags. We passed the  likin-barrier, known by its white flag, and I was not even asked for my  visiting card, nor were my boxes looked into--they were as beggarly as  the district--but poor carriers were detained, and a few cash unjustly  wrung from them. At a crowded teahouse, a few miles from the city, we  waited for the stragglers, while many wayfarers gathered in to see me.  Prices were ranging higher. Tea here was 4 cash, and not 2 cash as  hitherto. But even this charge was not excessive. In Canton one day,  after a weary journey on foot through the crowded streets, I was taken  to a five-storied pagoda overlooking the city. At the topmost story tea  was brought me, and I drank a dozen cups, and was asked threepence in  payment. I thought that the cheapest refreshment I ever had. Yet here I  was served as abundantly with better tea at a charge compared with which  the Canton charge was twenty-five times greater. Previously in this  province the price I had paid for tea in comparison with the price at  Canton was as one to fifty.    Early in the afternoon we passed through the south gate into Chaotong,  and, picking our way through the streets, were led to the comfortable  home of the Bible Christian Mission, where I was kindly received by the  Rev. Frank Dymond, and welcomed as a brother missionary of whose arrival  he had been advised. Services were ended, but the neighbours dropped in  to see the stranger, and ask my exalted age, my honourable name, and my  dignified business; they hoped to be able to congratulate me upon being  a man of virtue, the father of many sons; asked how many thousands of  pieces of silver I had (daughters), and how long I proposed to permit my  dignified presence to remain in their mean and contemptible city.    Mr. Dymond is a Devonshire man, and that evening he gave me for tea  Devonshire cream and blackberry jam made in Chaotong, and native oatmeal  cakes, than which I never tasted any better in Scotland.    Chaotong is a walled Fu city with 40,000 inhabitants. Roman Catholics  have been established here for many years, and the Bible Christian  Mission, which is affiliated to the China Inland Mission, has been  working here since 1887.    There were formerly five missionaries; there are now only two, and one  of"]]]
