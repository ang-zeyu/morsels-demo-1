Here  again, what is related should be typical rather than exceptional.    EXAMPLES OF THE CONFESSION STORY. That an intimate account of the  financial difficulties of a young couple as told by the wife, may not  only make an interesting story but may serve as a warning to others, is  shown in the confession story below. Signed \"F.B.,\" and illustrated with  a pen and ink sketch of the couple at work over their accounts, it was  printed in _Every Week_, a popular illustrated periodical formerly  published by the Crowell Publishing Company, New York.        THE THINGS WE LEARNED TO DO WITHOUT        We were married within a month of our commencement, after three      years of courtship at a big Middle West university. Looking back, it      seems to me that rich, tumultuous college life of ours was wholly      pagan. All about us was the free-handed atmosphere of \"easy money,\"      and in our \"crowd\" a tacit implication that a good time was one of      the primary necessities of life. Such were our ideas when we married      on a salary of one hundred dollars a month. We took letters of      introduction to some of the \"smart\" people in a suburb near Chicago,      and they proved so delightfully cordial that we settled down among      them without stopping to consider the discrepancies between their      ways and our income. We were put up at a small country club--a      simple affair enough, comparatively speaking--that demanded six      weeks' salary in initial dues and much more in actual subsequent      expense. \"Everybody\" went out for Saturday golf and stayed for      dinner and dancing.        By fall there was in working operation a dinner club of the \"younger      married set,\" as our local column in the city papers called us; an      afternoon bridge club; and a small theater club that went into town      every fortnight for dinner and a show. Costly little amusements, but      hardly more than were due charming young people of our opportunities      and tastes. I think that was our attitude, although we did not admit      it. In September we rented a \"smart\" little apartment. We had      planned to furnish it by means of several generous checks which were      family contributions to our array of wedding gifts. What we did was      to buy the furniture on the instalment plan, agreeing to pay twenty      dollars a month till the bill was settled, and we put the furniture      money into running expenses.        It was the beginning of a custom. They gave most generously, that      older generation. Visiting us, Max's mother would slip a bill into      my always empty purse when we went shopping; or mine would drop a      gold piece into my top bureau drawer for me to find after she had      gone. And there were always checks for birthdays.        Everything went into running expenses; yet, in spite of it, our      expenses ran quite away. Max said I was \"too valuable a woman to put      into the kitchen,\" so we hired a maid, good-humoredly giving her      _carte blanche_ on the grocery and meat market. Our bills, for all      our dining out, were enormous. There were clothes, too. Max      delighted in silk socks and tailored shirts, and he ordered his      monogramed cigarettes by the thousand. My own taste ran to expensive      little hats.        It is hardly necessary to recount the details. We had our first      tremendous quarrel at the end of six months, when, in spite of our      furniture money and our birthday checks, we found ourselves two      hundred and fifty dollars in debt. But as we cooled we decided that      there was nothing we could do without; we could only be \"more      careful.\"        Every month we reached that same conclusion. There was nothing we      could do without. At the end of the year on a $1200 salary we were      $700 behind; eight months later, after our first baby came, we were      over a thousand--and by that time, it seemed, permanently estranged.      I actually was carrying out a threat of separation and stripping the      apartment, one morning, when Max came back from town and sat down to      discuss matters with me.        A curious labyrinthine discussion it was, winding from      recriminations and flat admissions that our marriage was a failure      and our love was dead, to the most poignant memories of our      engagement days. But its central point was Max's detached insistence      that we make marriage over into a purely utilitarian affair.        \"Man needs the decencies of a home,\" he said over and over. \"It      doesn't do a fellow any good with a firm like mine to have them know      he can't manage his affairs. And my firm is the kind of firm I want      to work for. This next year is important; and if I spend it dragging      through a nasty divorce business, knowing that everybody knows, I'll      be about thirty per cent efficient. I'm willing to admit that      marriage--even a frost like ours--is useful. Will you?\"        I had to. My choice rested between going home, where there were two      younger sisters, or leaving the baby somewhere and striking out for      myself.        \"It seems to me,\" said Max, taking out his pencil, \"that if two      reasonably clever people can put their best brain power and eight      hours a day into a home, it might amount to something sometime. The      thing resolves itself into a choice between the things we can do      without and the things we can't. We'll list them. We can't do      without three meals and a roof; but there must be something.\"        \"You can certainly give up silk socks and cigarettes,\" I said; and,      surprisingly, on this old sore point between us Max agreed.        \"You can give up silk stockings, then,\" he said, and put them down.      Silk socks and silk stockings! Out of all possible economies, they      were the only things that we could think of. Finally--        \"We could make baby an excuse,\" I said, \"and never get out to the      club till very late--after dinner--and stay just for the dancing.      And we could get out of the dinner club and the theater bunch. Only,      we ought to have some fun.\"        \"You can go to matinees, and tell me about them, so we can talk      intelligently. We'll say we can't leave the kid nights--\"        \"We can buy magazines and read up on plays. We'll talk well enough      if we do that, and people won't know we haven't been. Put down:      'Magazines for plays.'\"        He did it quite seriously. Do we seem very amusing to you? So      anxious lest we should betray our economies--so impressed with our      social \"position\" and what people might think! It is funny enough to      me, looking back; but it was bitter business then.        I set myself to playing the devoted and absorbed young mother. But      it was a long, long time before it became the sweetest of realities.      I cried the first time I refused a bridge game to \"stay with baby\";      and I carried a sore heart those long spring afternoons when I      pushed his carriage conspicuously up and down the avenue while the      other women motored past me out for tea at the club. Yet those long      walks were the best thing that ever happened to me. I had time to      think, for one thing; and I gained splendid health, losing the      superfluous flesh I was beginning to carry, and the headaches that      usually came after days of lunching and bridge and dining.        I fell into the habit, too, of going around by the market, merely to      have an objective, and buying the day's supplies. The first month of      that habit my bills showed a decrease of $16.47. I shall always      remember that sum, because it is certainly the biggest I have ever      seen. I began to ask the prices of things; and I made my first faint      effort at applying our game of substitution to the food problem, a      thing which to me is still one of the most fascinating factors in      housekeeping.        One afternoon in late summer, I found a delightful little bungalow      in process of building, on a side street not so _very_ far from the      proper avenue. I investigated idly, and found that the rent was      thirty dollars less than we were paying. Yet even then I hesitated.        It was Max who had the courage to decide.        \"The only thing we are doing without is the address,\" he said, \"And      that isn't a loss that looks like $360 to me.\"        All that fall and winter we kept doggedly at our game of      substitution. Max bought a ready-made Tuxedo, and I ripped out the      label and sewed in one from a good tailor. I carried half a dozen      dresses from the dyer's to a woman who evolved three very decent      gowns; and then I toted them home in a box with a marking calculated      to impress any chance acquaintance. We were so ashamed of our      attempts at thrift that they came hard.        Often enough we quarreled after we had been caught in some sudden      temptation that set us back a pretty penny, and we were inevitably      bored and cross when we refused some gayety for economy's sake. We      resolutely decided to read aloud the evenings the others went to the      theater club; and as resolutely we substituted a stiff game of chess      for the bridge that we could not afford. But we had to learn to like      them both.        Occasionally we entertained at very small, very informal dinners,      \"on account of the baby\"; and definitely discarded the wines that      added the \"smartness\" demanded at formal affairs. People came to      those dinners in their second or third best: but they stayed late,      and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15721"],[0,"The Hawk of Egypt (#17)"],[1,"  direction in answer to the summons of the gong.    \"Idrabuh,\" he said quietly to four of the terror-stricken domestic  staff, pointing to the eunuch.  \"Upon the soles of the feet so that he  walketh not for many a day--if ever.\"  And as the wretch was dragged  screaming from the room, he beckoned to four others, and pointed to the  body of the woman.  \"Carry that out and throw it in the street, in such  wise that it is not known from whence it came.  Touch not the jewels,  lest thou sharest thy brother's fate.\"    With falcon upon wrist and blood-stained dogs at his heels, he passed  out of the ill-fated court to his own apartment, and, having bathed and  dressed himself, to his body-servant's grief, in hot, European  riding-kit, with boots from Peter Yapp, tucked the cleansed dogs of  Billi in beside him, and raced his car to the Obelisk which is all that  remains upright of the Biblical City of On.         *     *     *     *     *     *    The Ethiopian slave Qatim gathered up the broken body of the woman from  the filth of the gutter and carried her to his hovel and flung her upon  the filthy straw under which he hid the jewels he stripped from her.          CHAPTER XIII      \"_Best springs from strife and dissonant chords beget    Divinest harmonies_.\"              SIR LEWIS MORRIS.      As the sky lightened way down in the east and the faithful turned to  prayer, the little old lady sat at her window, taking her hour of  rest--her hour of understanding--with hands clasped peacefully in her  lap, a little smile at the corner of her whimsical mouth and her  snow-white hair fluttered by the breeze of dawn.    Bodily, mentally, spiritually, she was resting, having filched this  hour in which, before donning the garish trappings of her toilet, to  sit in fine cashmere night attire, covered in camel's-hair wrap as soft  as satin, with her little crimson bed-room slippers peeping from under  the hem and her snow-white hair confined by priceless lace; just as she  had thrown aside the thoughts and worries which are the outcome of the  turmoil and unrest of civilisation, to sit awhile, quietly, with her  eyes upon the dazzling peaks which show so clearly when we push aside  the nightmare fog we have wrapped about ourselves.    Not for her own relief did she sit at rest, for in that way rest does  not come to us; but to the relieving of others by withdrawing from the  lights and noises of this tumultuous planet and so obtaining a better  perspective of things as they stand spiritually, and a clearer insight  into the message of the only book she considered worth studying and  committing to memory.    She was no great thinker, this little old lady, neither did she store  up the printed thoughts of others to repeat them aptly upon fitting  occasions; she invariably mixed up the philosophers and their works;  'osophies simply bewildered her; ritual left her cold, psychology  troubled her but little, save only in its practical application to the  lives of those she loved.  But she knew the book of life, with its  tragedies and comedies, humour and crass stupidity, nettles and balm  from the first chapter to the last, and could prescribe you a remedy to  cure your mental hurt just as easily as she could undress your  screaming baby, find the criminal pin and re-dress it for you; and  every member of every Church and every disciple of every creed could  have fought a pitched battle at her feet and left her unmoved, so long  as the sick and sinning crept to her for help and children, rich or  poor, in silks or rags, rushed at her coming to cling about her knees.    She had no fixed time for her hour of understanding.  At her window in  moonlight, starlight or the coming of the dawn; in her gilded armchair  in the firelight or the light of the sun; in her rose-garden, in her  parks, anywhere, as long as she was withdrawn from noise and strife.    Not that she did not thoroughly enjoy going out to battle upon the most  mundane of material planes.  A born fighter, she would plunge into the  strife for the sheer love of fighting and would take the bull by the  horns or the man by the scruff of his neck and lay about her right  heartily with her stout ebony stick backed by verbal blows from her  vitriolic tongue.    Well, if we all rested for one hour, even for one minute, out of the  twenty-four during the frantic passing of modern days, what a boon we  should grant our neighbours!    And as the duchess sat quietly, with Dekko the parrot fast asleep upon  the back of her chair, as becomes a well-conducted bird, Fate crept up  behind and dropped the black thread of hate and the purple thread of  grief amongst the others she had tossed into the old lady's lap.    She suddenly sat upright with a shiver.    Qatim the Ethiopian lifted the body of a woman from out the gutter, and  the messenger from the Oasis of Khargegh strode through the gateway of  the hotel and kicked the somnolent _ghafir_ or watchman, who coughed  discreetly behind the sleeping night-porter's back.    And when Hobson, some time later, entered the bedroom with her grace's  early cup of tea, which included an egg and fruit, she said nothing of  the terrible story which had run like wildfire through the servants'  quarters and had turned her cold with horror.    Hobson was an autocrat in her own domain and ruled with a cast-iron rod.    \"Don't you utter one word of this disgusting tale to her grace,\" she  had said fiercely as she had sailed through the door of the  ladies-maids' room, held meekly open for her by one of the under-maids,  who had been caught gossiping, \"or back you go to England, both of  you.\"  She turned back into the room and rattled the tray to emphasise  her orders.  \"I won't have my lady troubled with it, d'you hear?  Common circus trash! what has it got to do with you, I should like to  know, if she's been killed or not?  That's what they all come to, as  you'll find out, if you don't take care.\"    She had swept from the room leaving the plump, rosy-cheeked Devonshire  lasses trembling.    Many, many years ago the duchess had taken the bright, intelligent  daughter of a Devonshire farmer on the estate into her service; trained  her and promoted her as her seniors in the lady's service had married  or been pensioned off, until she had finally risen to the post of head  maid and confidential companion.    Love and marriage had passed Maria Hobson by, but she adored her  mistress and constituted herself as dragon, sheep-dog and buffer, so as  to save her from unpleasantness or pain; at the same time issuing  orders as to health and hours which her grace usually meekly  obeyed--though you would not have taken a bet upon it with any feeling  of security.    It is curious, the ascendancy which such a type of maid can obtain over  a strong-willed mistress.  Think of Abigail Hill and the influence she  had over Queen Anne, which finally ousted the great Sarah Jennings,  Duchess of Marlborough, brought disturbance into English politics and  ruin to the fortune of the Jacobites.    But at times there was a look in her mistress' eyes and a certain  atmosphere radiating from the frail little person before which Hobson  quailed, so that she said quite gently, \"Tea and one letter, your  grace,\" when she found her sitting at the open window, looking out at  the morning sky.    But although she spoke gently and tucked an extra shawl about the bent  shoulders with a tender hand, she was thinking viciously all the same  over her mistresses leniency towards her god-daughter.    \"I wish the young lady could be safely married to that proper English  gentleman.  One can see he wants her, but she doesn't seem to know her  own mind.  Too pleased by half she is, to my thinking, with this  country and the silly nonsense of their nasty, heathen ways!\"    And she left the room with a swish of starched petticoat, when Damaris,  who had just returned from her desert ride, entered to greet her  godmother.    She knelt at the side of the chair and, encircling her in her strong  young arms, laid her cheek against the old lady's, and knelt without  movement, looking out to the desert, whilst one wrinkled old hand  stroked her head and the other turned the pages of the letter.    A piteous letter of appeal from a woman whose love had brought forth  the bitterest of bitter fruit.      \". . . _Is_ there a way out, Petite _Maman_?\" wrote Jill, the English  wife of Hahmed Sheikh el-Umbar.  \"Will you undertake the long journey  and come and see me, for who knows if together we could not find a way  to ensure my boy's happiness?  I would come to you, only Hugh is near  you, and our men in the East tolerate no interference from their  women-folk.  My messenger will wait for your answer.  I am overwhelmed  with foreboding for Hugh my first-born.  If you can, come to me.  JILL.\"      And as the sun rose the old lady still sat near the window, trying to  come to a decision.    Could she turn a deaf ear to the woman she had known as a girl almost  twenty-five years ago?  Could she, on the other hand, go to her and  risk leaving the girl at her side exposed to the indescribable appeal  of the East?  Should she send her back to England, or take her as far  as Luxor and leave her there under the social wing of Lady Thistleton?    \"Have you learned any more about the Arab who follows at a distance  when you ride in the morning, dear?\"    Damaris nodded.    It seemed she had overheard Lady Thistleton talking about him; his  palaces in the desert and at Cairo; his stables and falcons.    The girl stopped for a moment, then continued:    \"He has an English name and seems to be a millionaire, and something  else which I could not catch, but by the sound of the  Prickly-Thistleton's voice it seemed to be something awful!\"    \"This\"--the old lady touched the letter in her lap--\"this is from his,  mother, dear, asking me to go and see her.  If I do, I will tell you  the whole story when I"]]]
