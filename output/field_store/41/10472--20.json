Then, as fluidly as he had melted into the  woods, McNeil returned. \"Company,\" he said in a soft voice.    \"What kind?\"    \"Tribesmen, but wilder than any I've seen, even on the tapes. We are  certainly out on the fringes now. These people look about cave level. I  don't think they've ever heard of traders.\"    \"How many?\"    \"Three, maybe four families. Most of the males must be out hunting, but  there're about ten children and six or seven women. I don't think  they've had good luck lately by the look of them.\"    \"Maybe their luck and ours are going to turn together,\" Ashe said,  motioning Ross forward with the donkeys. \"We will circle about them to  the river and then try bartering later. But I do want to establish  contact.\"          CHAPTER 9      \"Not to be too hopeful--\" McNeil rubbed his arm across his hot face--\"so  far, so good.\" After kicking from his path some of the branches Ross had  lopped from the trees they had been felling, he went to help his  companion roll another small log up to a shelter which was no longer  temporary. If there had been any eyes other than the woodland hunters'  to spy upon them, they would have seen only the usual procedure of the  Beaker traders, busily constructing one of their posts.    That they were being watched by the hunters, all three were certain.  That there might be other spies in the forest, they had to assume for  their own safety. They might prowl at night, but in the daytime all of  the time agents kept within the bounds of the roles they were acting.    Barter with the head men of the hunting clan had brought those shy  people into the camp of the strangers who had such wonders to exchange  for tanned deer hides and better furs. The news of the traders' arrival  spread quickly during the short time they had been here, so that two  other clans had sent men to watch the proceedings.    With the trade came news which the agents sifted and studied. Each of  them had a list of questions to insert into their conversations with the  tribesmen if and when that was possible. Although they did not share a  common speech with the forest men, signs were informative and certain  nouns could be quickly learned. In the meantime Ashe became friendly  with the nearest and first of the clan groups they discovered, going  hunting with the men as an excuse to penetrate the unknown section they  must quarter in their search for the Red base.    Ross drank river water and mopped his own hot face. \"If the Reds aren't  traders,\" he mused aloud, \"what _is_ their cover?\"    McNeil shrugged. \"A hunting tribe--fishermen--\"    \"Where would they get the women and children?\"    \"The same way they get their men--recruit them in our own time. Or in  the way lots of tribes grew during periods of stress.\"    Ross set down the water jug. \"You mean, kill off the men, take over  their families?\" This was a cold-bloodedness he found sickening.  Although he had always prided himself on his toughness, several times  during his training at the project he had been confronted by things  which shook his belief in his own strong stomach and nerve.    \"It has been done,\" McNeil remarked bleakly, \"hundreds of times by  invaders. In this setup--small family clans, widely scattered--that move  would be very easy.\"    \"They would have to pose as farmers, not hunters,\" Ross pointed out.  \"They couldn't move a base around with them.\"    \"All right, so they set up a farming village. Oh, I see what you  mean--there isn't any village around here. Yet they are here, maybe  underground.\"    How right their guesses were they learned that night when Ashe returned,  a deer's haunch on his shoulder. Ross knew him well enough by now to  sense his preoccupation. \"You found something?\"    \"A new set of ghosts,\" Ashe replied with a strange little smile.    \"Ghosts!\" McNeil pounced upon that. \"The Reds like to play the  supernatural angle, don't they? First the voice of Lurgha and now  ghosts. What do these ghosts do?\"    \"They inhabit a bit of mountainous territory southeast of here, a  stretch strictly taboo for all hunters. We were following a bison track  until the beast headed for the ghost country. Then Ulffa called us off  in a hurry. It seems that the hunter who goes in there after his quarry  never reappears, or if he does, it's in a damaged condition, blown upon  by ghosts and burned to death! That's one point.\"    He sat down by the fire and stretched his arms wearily. \"The second is a  little more disturbing for us. A Beaker camp about twenty miles south of  here, as far as I can judge, was exterminated just a week ago. The  message was passed to me because I was thought to be a kinsman of the  slain----\"    McNeil sat up. \"Done because they were hunting us?\"    \"Might well be. On the other hand, the affair may have been just one of  general precaution.\"    \"The ghosts did it?\" Ross wanted to know.    \"I asked that. No, it seems that strange tribesmen overran it at night.\"    \"At night?\" McNeil whistled.    \"Just so.\" Ashe's tone was dry. \"The tribes do not fight that way.  Either someone slipped up in his briefing, or the Reds are overconfident  and don't care about the rules. But it was the work of tribesmen, or  their counterfeits. There is also a nasty rumor speeding about that the  ghosts do not relish traders and that they might protest intrusions of  such with penalties all around----\"    \"Like the Wrath of Lurgha,\" supplied Ross.    \"There is a certain repetition in this which suggests a lot to the  suspicious mind,\" Ashe agreed.    \"I'd say no more hunting expeditions for the present,\" McNeil said. \"It  is too easy to mistake a friend for a deer and weep over his grave  afterward.\"    \"That is a thought which entered my mind several times this afternoon,\"  Ashe agreed. \"These people are deceptively simple on the surface, but  their minds do not work along the same patterns as ours. We try to  outwit them, but it takes only one slip to make it fatal. In the  meantime, I think we'd better make this place a little more snug, and it  might be well to post sentries as unobtrusively as possible.\"    \"How about faking some signs of a ruined camp and heading into the blue  ourselves?\" McNeil asked. \"We could strike for the ghost mountains,  traveling by night, and Ulffa's crowd would think we were finished off.\"    \"An idea to keep in mind. The point against it would be the missing  bodies. It seems that the tribesmen who raided the Beaker camp left some  very distasteful evidence of what happened to the camp's personnel. And  those we can't produce to cover our trail.\"    McNeil was not yet convinced. \"We might be able to fake something along  that line, too----\"    \"We may have to fake nothing,\" Ross cut in softly. He was standing close  to the edge of the clearing where they were building their hut, his hand  on one of the saplings in the palisade they had set up so laboriously  that day. Ashe was beside him in an instant.    \"What is it?\"    Ross's hours of listening to the sounds of the wilderness were his  measuring gauge now. \"That bird has never called from inland before. It  is the blue one we've seen fishing for frogs along the river.\"    Ashe, not even glancing at the forest, went for the water jug. \"Get your  trail supplies,\" he ordered.    Their leather pouches which held enough iron rations to keep them going  were always at hand. McNeil gathered them from behind the fur curtain  fronting their half-finished cabin. Again the bird called, its cry  piercing and covering a long distance. Ross could understand why a  careless man would select it for the signal. He crossed the clearing to  the donkeys' shelter, slashing through their nose halters. Probably the  patient little beasts would swiftly fall victims to some forest  prowlers, but at least they would have their chance to escape.    McNeil, his cloak slung about him to conceal the ration bags, picked up  the leather bucket as if he were merely going down to the river for  water, and came to join Ross. They believed that they were carrying it  off well, that the camp must appear normal to any lurkers in the woods.  But either they had made some slip or the enemy was impatient. An arrow  sped out of the night to flash across the fire, and Ashe escaped death  only because he had leaned forward to feed the flames. His arm swung out  and sent the water in the jar hissing onto the blaze as he himself  rolled in the other direction.    Ross plunged for the brush with McNeil. Lying flat on the half-frozen  ground, they started to work their way to the river bank where the open  area would make surprise less possible.    \"Ashe?\" he whispered and felt McNeil's warm breath on his cheek as he  replied:    \"He'll make it the other way! He's the best we have for this sort of  job.\"    They made a worm's progress, twice lying, with dagger in hand, while  they listened to a faint rustle which betrayed the passing of one of the  attackers. Both times Ross was tempted to rise and try to cut off the  stranger, but he fought down the impulse. He had learned a control of  himself that would have been impossible for him a few months earlier.    The glimmer of the river was pale through the clumps of bushes which  sometimes grew into the flood. In this country winter still clung  tenaciously in shadowy places with cups of leftover snow, and there was  a bite in the wind and water. Ross rose to his knees with an involuntary  gasp as a scream cut through the night. He wrenched around toward the  camp, only to feel McNeil's hand clamp on his forearm.    \"That was a donkey,\" whispered McNeil urgently. \"Come on, let's go down  to that ford we discovered!\"    They turned south, daring now to trot, half bent to the ground. The  river was swollen with spring floods which were only now beginning to  subside, but two days earlier they had noticed a sandbar at one spot."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19164"],[0,"Lectures on Art, Delivered Before the University of Oxford in Hilary Term, 1870 (#17)"],[1,"attaining some moderately accurate skill of sketching  architecture, and greater pleasure still in directing it usefully.  Suppose, for instance, we were to take up the historical scenery in  Carlyle's \"Frederick.\" Too justly the historian accuses the genius of  past art, in that, types of too many such elsewhere, the galleries of  Berlin--\"are made up, like other galleries, of goat-footed Pan, Europa's  Bull, Romulus's She-Wolf, and the Correggiosity of Correggio, and  contain, for instance, no portrait of Friedrich the Great,--no likeness  at all, or next to none at all, of the noble series of Human Realities,  or any part of them, who have sprung, not from the idle brains of  dreaming _dilettanti_, but from the head of God Almighty, to make this  poor authentic earth a little memorable for us, and to do a little work  that may be eternal there.\" So Carlyle tells us--too truly! We cannot  now draw Friedrich for him, but we can draw some of the old castles and  cities that were the cradles of German life--Hohenzollern, Hapsburg,  Marburg, and such others;--we may keep some authentic likeness of these  for the future. Suppose we were to take up that first volume of  \"Friedrich,\" and put outlines to it: shall we begin by looking for Henry  the Fowler's tomb--Carlyle himself asks if he has any--at Quedlinburgh,  and so downwards, rescuing what we can? That would certainly be making  our work of some true use.      116. But I have told you enough, it seems to me, at least to-day, of  this function of art in recording fact; let me now finally, and with all  distinctness possible to me, state to you its main business of all;--its  service in the actual uses of daily life.    You are surprised, perhaps, to hear me call this its main business. That  is indeed so, however. The giving brightness to picture is much, but the  giving brightness to life more. And remember, were it as patterns only,  you cannot, without the realities, have the pictures. _You cannot have a  landscape by Turner, without a country for him to paint; you cannot have  a portrait by Titian, without a man to be portrayed._ I need not prove  that to you, I suppose, in these short terms; but in the outcome I can  get no soul to believe that the beginning of art _is in getting our  country clean, and our people beautiful_. I have been ten years trying  to get this very plain certainty--I do not say believed--but even  thought of, as anything but a monstrous proposition. To get your country  clean, and your people lovely;--I assure you that is a necessary work of  art to begin with! There has indeed been art in countries where people  lived in dirt to serve God, but never in countries where they lived in  dirt to serve the devil. There has indeed been art where the people were  not all lovely--where even their lips were thick--and their skins black,  because the sun had looked upon them; but never in a country where the  people were pale with miserable toil and deadly shade, and where the  lips of youth, instead of being full with blood, were pinched by famine,  or warped with poison. And now, therefore, note this well, the gist of  all these long prefatory talks. I said that the two great moral  instincts were those of Order and Kindness. Now, all the arts are  founded on agriculture by the hand, and on the graces, and kindness of  feeding, and dressing, and lodging your people. Greek art begins in the  gardens of Alcinous--perfect order, leeks in beds, and fountains in  pipes. And Christian art, as it arose out of chivalry, was only possible  so far as chivalry compelled both kings and knights to care for the  right personal training of their people; it perished utterly when those  kings and knights became +demoboroi+, devourers of the people.  And it will become possible again only, when, literally, the sword is  beaten into the ploughshare, when your St. George of England shall  justify his name, and Christian art shall be known as its Master was, in  breaking of bread.      117. Now look at the working out of this broad principle in minor  detail; observe how, from highest to lowest, health of art has first  depended on reference to industrial use. There is first the need of cup  and platter, especially of cup; for you can put your meat on the  Harpies',[10] or on any other, tables; but you must have your cup to  drink from. And to hold it conveniently, you must put a handle to it;  and to fill it when it is empty you must have a large pitcher of some  sort; and to carry the pitcher you may most advisably have two handles.  Modify the forms of these needful possessions according to the various  requirements of drinking largely and drinking delicately; of pouring  easily out, or of keeping for years the perfume in; of storing in  cellars, or bearing from fountains; of sacrificial libation, of  Panathenaic treasure of oil, and sepulchral treasure of ashes,--and you  have a resultant series of beautiful form and decoration, from the rude  amphora of red earth up to Cellini's vases of gems and crystal, in which  series, but especially in the more simple conditions of it, are  developed the most beautiful lines and most perfect types of severe  composition which have yet been attained by art.    [Footnote 10: Virg., _AEn._, iii. 209 _seqq._]      118. But again, that you may fill your cup with pure water, you must go  to the well or spring; you need a fence round the well; you need some  tube or trough, or other means of confining the stream at the spring.  For the conveyance of the current to any distance you must build either  enclosed or open aqueduct; and in the hot square of the city where you  set it free, you find it good for health and pleasantness to let it leap  into a fountain. On these several needs you have a school of sculpture  founded; in the decoration of the walls of wells in level countries, and  of the sources of springs in mountainous ones, and chiefly of all, where  the women of household or market meet at the city fountain.    There is, however, a farther reason for the use of art here than in any  other material service, so far as we may, by art, express our reverence  or thankfulness. Whenever a nation is in its right mind, it always has a  deep sense of divinity in the gift of rain from heaven, filling its  heart with food and gladness; and all the more when that gift becomes  gentle and perennial in the flowing of springs. It literally is not  possible that any fruitful power of the Muses should be put forth upon a  people which disdains their Helicon; still less is it possible that any  Christian nation should grow up \"tanquam lignum quod plantatum est secus  decursus aquarum,\" which cannot recognise the lesson meant in their  being told of the places where Rebekah was met;--where Rachel,--where  Zipporah,--and she who was asked for water under Mount Grerizim by a  Stranger, weary, who had nothing to draw with.      119. And truly, when our mountain springs are set apart in vale or  craggy glen, or glade of wood green through the drought of summer, far  from cities, then it is best to let them stay in their own happy peace;  but if near towns, and liable therefore to be defiled by common usage,  we could not use the loveliest art more worthily than by sheltering the  spring and its first pools with precious marbles: nor ought anything to  be esteemed more important, as a means of healthy education, than the  care to keep the streams of it afterwards, to as great a distance as  possible, pure, full of fish, and easily accessible to children. There  used to be, thirty years ago, a little rivulet of the Wandel, about an  inch deep, which ran over the carriage-road and under a foot-bridge just  under the last chalk hill near Croydon. Alas! men came and went; and it  did _not_ go on for ever. It has long since been bricked over by the  parish authorities; but there was more education in that stream with its  minnows than you could get out of a thousand pounds spent yearly in the  parish schools, even though you were to spend every farthing of it in  teaching the nature of oxygen and hydrogen, and the names, and rate per  minute, of all the rivers in Asia and America.      120. Well, the gist of this matter lies here then. Suppose we want a  school of pottery again in England, all we poor artists are ready to do  the best we can, to show you how pretty a line may be that is twisted  first to one side, and then to the other; and how a plain household-blue  will make a pattern on white; and how ideal art may be got out of the  spaniel's colours of black and tan. But I tell you beforehand, all that  we can do will be utterly useless, unless you teach your peasant to say  grace, not only before meat, but before drink; and having provided him  with Greek cups and platters, provide him also with something that is  not poisoned to put into them.      121. There cannot be any need that I should trace for you the conditions  of art that are directly founded on serviceableness of dress, and of  armour; but it is my duty to affirm to you, in the most positive manner,  that after recovering, for the poor, wholesomeness of food, your next  step towards founding schools of art in England must be in recovering,  for the poor, decency and wholesomeness of dress; thoroughly good in  substance, fitted for their daily work, becoming to their rank in life,  and worn with order and dignity. And this order and dignity must be  taught them by the women of the upper and middle classes, whose minds  can be in nothing right, as long as they are so wrong in this matter as  to endure the squalor of the poor, while they themselves dress gaily.  And on the proper pride and comfort of both poor and rich in dress, must  be founded the true arts of dress; carried on by masters of manufacture  no less careful of the perfectness and beauty of their tissues, and of  all that in substance and design can be bestowed upon them, than ever  the armourers of Milan and "]]]
