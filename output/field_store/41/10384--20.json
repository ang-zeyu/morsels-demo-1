A palavra _tribu_, á qual as familias romanas pertenciam, fica sempre  subentendida, e só se menciona o nome.

Then the rest of the  money and spoils were divided among all the buccaneers without reference  to what had been paid to the wounded. The shares of those who had been  killed were given to friends or acquaintances, who undertook to deliver  them to their families.    The spoils in this case consisted of two hundred and sixty thousand  dollars in money and a great quantity of valuable goods, besides many  slaves and precious stones and jewels. These latter were apportioned  among the men in the most ridiculous manner, the pirates having no idea  of the relative value of the jewels, some of them preferring large and  worthless colored stones to smaller diamonds and rubies. When all their  wickedly gained property had been divided, the pirates sailed to  Tortuga, where they proceeded, without loss of time, to get rid of the  wealth they had amassed. They ate, they drank, they gambled; they  crowded the taverns as taverns have never been crowded before; they sold  their valuable merchandise for a twentieth part of its value to some of  the more level-headed people of the place; and having rioted, gambled,  and committed every sort of extravagance for about three weeks, the  majority of L'Olonnois' rascally crew found themselves as poor as when  they had started off on their expedition. It took them almost as long to  divide their spoils as it did to get rid of them.    As these precious rascals had now nothing to live upon, it was necessary  to start out again and commit some more acts of robbery and ruin; and  L'Olonnois, whose rapacious mind seems to have been filled with a desire  for town-destroying, projected an expedition to Nicaragua, where he  proposed to pillage and devastate as many towns and villages as  possible. His reputation as a successful commander was now so high that  he had no trouble in getting men, for more offered themselves than he  could possibly take.    He departed with seven hundred men and six ships, stopping on the way  near the coast of Cuba, and robbing some poor fishermen of their boats,  which he would need in shallow water. Their voyage was a very long one,  and they were beset by calms, and instead of reaching Nicaragua, they  drifted into the Gulf of Honduras. Here they found themselves nearly out  of provisions, and were obliged to land and scour the country to find  something to eat. Leaving their ships, they began a land march through  the unfortunate region where they now found themselves. They robbed  Indians, they robbed villages; they devastated little towns, taking  everything that they cared for, and burning what they did not want, and  treating the people they captured with viler cruelties than any in which  the buccaneers had yet indulged. Their great object was to take  everything they could find, and then try to make the people confess  where other things were hidden. Men and women were hacked to pieces with  swords; it was L'Olonnois' pleasure, when a poor victim had nothing to  tell, to tear out his tongue with his own hands, and it is said that on  some occasions his fury was so great that he would cut out the heart of  a man and bite at it with his great teeth. No more dreadful miseries  could be conceived than those inflicted upon the peaceful inhabitants of  the country through which these wretches passed. They frequently met  ambuscades of Spaniards, who endeavored to stop their progress; but this  was impossible. The pirates were too strong in number and too savage in  disposition to be resisted by ordinary Christians, and they kept on  their wicked way.    At last they reached a town called San Pedro, which was fairly well  defended, having around it a great hedge of prickly thorns; but thorns  cannot keep out pirates, and after a severe fight the citizens  surrendered, on condition that they should have two hours' truce. This  was given, and the time was occupied by the people in running away into  the woods and carrying off their valuables. But when the two hours had  expired, L'Olonnois and his men entered the town, and instead of  rummaging around to see what they could find, they followed the  unfortunate people into the woods, for they well understood what they  wanted when they asked for a truce, and robbed them of nearly everything  they had taken away.    But the capture of this town was not of much service to L'Olonnois, who  did not find provisions enough to feed his men. Their supplies ran very  low, and it was not long before they were in danger of starvation.  Consequently they made their way by the most direct course to the coast,  where they hoped to be able to get something to eat. If they could find  nothing else, they might at least catch fish. On their way every rascal  of them prepared himself a net, made out of the fibres of a certain  plant, which grew in abundance in those regions, in order that he might  catch himself a supper when he reached the sea.    After a time the buccaneers got back to their fleet and remained on the  coast about three months, waiting for some expected Spanish ships, which  they hoped to capture. They eventually met with one, and after a great  deal of ordinary fighting and stratagem they boarded and took her, but  found her not a very valuable prize.    Now L'Olonnois proposed to his men that they should sail for Guatemala,  but he met with an unexpected obstacle; the buccaneers who had enlisted  under him had expected to make great fortunes in this expedition, but  their high hopes had not been realized. They had had very little booty  and very little food, they were hungry and disappointed and wanted to go  home, and the great majority of them declined to follow L'Olonnois any  farther. But there were some who declared that they would rather die  than go home to Tortuga as poor as when they left it, and so remained  with L'Olonnois on the biggest ship of the fleet, which he commanded.  The smaller vessels now departed for Tortuga, and after some trouble  L'Olonnois succeeded in getting his vessel out of the harbor where it  had been anchored, and sailed for the islands of de las Pertas. Here he  had the misfortune to run his big vessel hopelessly aground.    When they found it absolutely impossible to get their great vessel off  the sand banks, the pirates set to work to break her up and build a boat  out of her planks. This was a serious undertaking, but it was all they  could do. They could not swim away, and their ship was of no use to them  as she was. But when they began to work they had no idea it would take  so long to build a boat. It was several months before the unwieldy craft  was finished, and they occupied part of the time in gardening, planting  French beans, which came to maturity in six weeks, and gave them some  fresh vegetables. They also had some stores and portable stoves on board  their dismantled ship, and made bread from some wheat which was among  their provisions, thus managing to live very well.    L'Olonnois was never intended by nature to be a boat-builder, or  anything else that was useful and honest, and when the boat was finished  it was discovered that it had been planned so badly that it would not  hold them all, so all they could do was to draw lots to see who should  embark in her, for one-half of them would have to stay until the others  came back to release them. Of course L'Olonnois went away in the boat,  and reached the mouth of the Nicaragua River. There his party was  attacked by some Spaniards and Indians, who killed more than half of  them and prevented the others from landing. L'Olonnois and the rest of  his men got safely away, and they might now have sailed back to the  island where they had left their comrades, for there was room enough for  them all in the boat. But they did nothing of the sort, but went to the  coast of Cartagena.    The pirates left on the island were eventually taken off by a  buccaneering vessel, but L'Olonnois had now reached the end of the  string by which the devil had allowed him to gambol on this earth for so  long a time. On the shores where he had now landed he did not find  prosperous villages, treasure houses, and peaceful inhabitants, who  could be robbed and tortured, but instead of these he came upon a  community of Indians, who were called by the Spaniards, Bravos, or wild  men. These people would never have anything to do with the whites. It  was impossible to conquer them or to pacify them by kind treatment. They  hated the white man and would have nothing to do with him. They had  heard of L'Olonnois and his buccaneers, and when they found this  notorious pirate upon their shores they were filled with a fury such as  they had never felt for any others of his race.    These bloody pirates had always conquered in their desperate fights  because they were so reckless and so savage, but now they had fallen  among thoroughbred savages, more cruel and more brutal and pitiless than  themselves. Nearly all the buccaneers were killed, and L'Olonnois was  taken prisoner. His furious captors tore his living body apart, piece by  piece, and threw each fragment into the fire, and when the whole of this  most inhuman of inhuman men had been entirely consumed, they scattered  his ashes to the winds so that not a trace should remain on earth of  this monster. If, in his infancy, he had died of croup, the history of  the human race would have lost some of its blackest pages.          Chapter XVI    A Pirate Potentate      Sometime in the last half of the seventeenth century on a quiet farm in  a secluded part of Wales there was born a little boy baby. His father  was a farmer, and his mother churned, and tended the cows and the  chickens, and there was no reason to imagine that this gentle little  baby, born and reared in this rural solitude, would become one of the  most formidable pirates that the world ever knew. Yet such was the case.    The baby's name was Henry "]]]
