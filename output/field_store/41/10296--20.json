This the elder sister noticed, in spite of her stupidity, and she  would gladly have given all her beauty for half the cleverness of  her sister, and sometimes the Queen, although full of kindness, would  reproach her daughter for her foolishness, which caused the Princess  almost to die of grief.    One day when she had retreated to a wood to brood over her  unhappiness, she saw a little man coming towards her. He was  uncommonly ugly and unpleasing in appearance, but was very richly  dressed.    It was the young Prince Tufty Riquet, who had fallen in love with the  pictures he had seen of her, and had left his father's kingdom for the  sake of making her acquaintance.    Delighted to meet her alone in this manner, he accosted her as  courteously as possible, but soon, noticing that she was melancholy,  he said:    \"I cannot understand how it is that anyone as beautiful as you are,  can be as sad as you appear to be; for I must own, that although I  can boast of having seen many beauties, not one have I ever met whose  beauty equalled yours.\"    [Illustration]    \"It pleases you to say so, sir,\" replied the Princess, and relapsed  into silence.    \"Beauty,\" went on Riquet, \"is so delightful that one would give  everything for it, and if anyone is beautiful I can't understand  anything troubling greatly.\"    \"I would rather be as ugly as you,\" answered the Princess, \"and be  clever, than as beautiful as I am, and be stupid.\"    \"To think you are stupid is a sure sign that you have a certain amount  of cleverness, madam,\" replied Riquet.    \"I don't think about that,\" said the Princess, \"but I am quite sure  that I am very silly, and the grief of that is killing me.\"    \"If that is all that troubles you, I can soon put an end to your  grief,\" said Riquet, \"for I have the power of giving cleverness to the  person whom I love the best, and if only you will marry me, you shall  become as clever as you can wish.\"    The Princess was greatly astonished, but remained silent.    \"I can see,\" continued Riquet, \"that this proposal is not to your  taste, and I am not astonished. I will give you a year to think about  it.\"    So great was the longing of the Princess to be clever, that she at  once promised Riquet to marry him in a year's time, and no sooner had  she made the promise than a great change took place in her, and she  found she could say all sorts of pleasant things, on all sorts of  subjects, in quite an easy manner.    She at once began a conversation with Riquet, making such brilliant  remarks, that he could almost think he had given her all his  cleverness and had kept none for himself.    When the Princess returned to the Palace, everybody was astonished  at the sudden and extraordinary change, for, instead of saying stupid  things, or just nothing at all, she was now full of beautiful ideas  which she expressed most charmingly.    The report of this transformation was soon spread abroad, and all  the young Princes of the neighbouring kingdoms asked for her hand in  marriage, but not one did she find altogether suitable.    However, at last one arrived, who was so powerful, rich, clever and  handsome, that she could not help approving of him, and her father,  noticing this, told her she was quite free to choose what husband she  wished.    The Princess thanked him, and asked for time to consider the matter.    [Illustration]    Then, to think it over, she went by chance, into the wood where she had  met Tufty Riquet.    While she was walking, deep in thought, she noticed a loud noise  beneath her feet, as of many persons hastening to and fro; then,  listening attentively, she heard a voice say, \"Bring me the saucepan,\"  and another voice cry, \"Put some wood on the fire.\"    At the same moment the earth opened and she saw a big kitchen full  of cooks, and all sorts of things necessary for the making of a  magnificent banquet, and everybody hard at work.    The Princess, astonished at this sight, asked the men for whom they  were working.    \"For the Prince Tufty Riquet,\" answered the head cook, \"for to-morrow  is his wedding day.\"    The Princess, more surprised than ever, all at once recollected that  it was just a year ago that very day that she had promised to marry  the ugly Tufty Riquet.    [Illustration: \"TO THINK IT OVER SHE WENT INTO THE WOOD.\"]    The reason that she had not remembered her promise before was that she  was foolish when she made it, and in becoming clever she had forgotten  all her former stupidities.    She had only walked on a few steps further, when Riquet appeared  before her, magnificently clad, as a Prince about to marry.    \"Here you see me, madam,\" said he, \"keeping my word, and I have no  doubt that you also came here to keep yours, and by giving me your  hand to make me the happiest of men.\"    \"I frankly confess,\" replied the Princess, \"that I have not yet made  up my mind, and I do not think I can ever do as you wish.\"    \"You surprise me, madam,\" said Riquet.    \"I can quite believe that,\" said the Princess, \"and if you were not  a good and clever man, I should not know how to act. But you are well  aware that it was when I was stupid I promised to marry you, but now,  as you may imagine, I am not so easily pleased.\"    \"Except for my ugliness,\" said Riquet, \"have you anything against me?  Do you object to my birth, my character, or my manners?\"    \"Not at all,\" replied the Princess, \"I love those things in you.\"    \"If that is so,\" answered Riquet, \"I shall indeed be made happy,  because you can cause me to become the most delightful of men if only  you will desire it. For know, madam, the same fairy who at my birth  gave me the power to impart cleverness to whomsoever I should love,  gave you a gift also, that of being able to render beautiful the one  to whom you would grant this favour.\"    \"If that is the case,\" exclaimed the Princess, \"I desire with all my  heart that you might be the most handsome and pleasing Prince in the  world.\"    No sooner had the Princess uttered these words than her wish was  fulfilled, though some say that no change really took place in Riquet,  but that the Princess loved him now so much that all his ugliness was  seen as beauty by her eyes.    However that may be, she straightway consented to be his bride, and,  as the preparations had already been made, the wedding took place the  very next day.    [Illustration: _Painted by Jennie Harbour_  THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS--\"TUFTY RIQUET\"]    [Illustration]          THUMBLING      There was once a poor woodman sitting by the fire in his cottage and  his wife sat by his side spinning. \"How lonely it is,\" said he, \"for  you and me to sit here by ourselves without any children to play about  and amuse us, while other people seem so happy and merry with their  children!\" \"What you say is very true,\" said the wife, sighing, and  turning her wheel; \"how happy should I be if I had but one child! and  if it were ever so small, nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb, I  should be very happy, and love it dearly.\" Now it came to pass that  this good woman's wish was fulfilled just as she desired; for, some  time afterwards, she had a little boy, who was quite healthy and  strong, but not much bigger than my thumb. So they said, \"Well, we  cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and, little as he is,  we will love him dearly;\" and they called him Thumbling.    They gave him plenty of food, yet he never grew bigger, but remained  just the same size as when he was born; still, his eyes were sharp and  sparkling and he soon showed himself to be a clever little fellow,  who always knew well what he was about. One day, as the woodman was  getting ready to go into the wood to cut fuel, he said, \"I wish I had  some one to bring the cart after me, for I want to make haste.\" \"Oh,  father!\" cried Thumbling, \"I will take care of that; the cart shall  be in the wood by the time you want it.\" Then the woodman laughed and  said, \"How can that be? You cannot reach up to the horse's bridle.\"  \"Never mind that, father,\" said Thumbling; \"if my mother will only  harness the horse, I will get into his ear, and tell him which way to  go.\" \"Well,\" said the father, \"we will try for once.\"    When the time came, the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and  put Thumbling into its ear; and as he sat there, the little man told  the beast how to go, crying out, \"Go on,\" and \"Stop,\" as he wanted;  so the horse went on just as if the woodman had driven it himself into  the wood. It happened that, as the horse was going a little too fast,  and Thumbling was calling out \"Gently, gently!\" two strangers came up.  \"What an odd thing that is!\" said one, \"there is a cart going along,  and I heard a carter talking to the horse but can see no one.\" \"That  is strange,\" said the other; \"let us follow the cart and see where it  goes.\" So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the  place where the woodman was. Then Thumbling, seeing his father, cried  out, \"See, father, here I am, with the cart, all right and safe; now  take me down.\" So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and  with the other took his son out of the ear; then he put him down upon  a straw, where he sat as merry as you please. The two strangers were  all this time looking on, and did not know what to say for wonder. At  last one took the other aside and said, \"That little urchin will make  our fortune if we can get him, and carry him about from town to town  as a show; we must buy him.\" So they went to the woodman and asked him  what he would take for the little man: \"He will be better off,\" said  they, \"with us than with you.\" \"I won't sell him at all,\" said the  father, \"my own flesh and blood is dearer to me than all the silver  and gold in the world.\" But Thumbling, hearing of the bargain they  wanted to make, crept up his father's coat to his shoulder, and  whispered in his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15147"],[0,"Beeton's Book of Needlework (#17)"],[1,"--Acacia Spray.]    This spray of acacia is worked in raised satin stitch embroidery; the  flowers should be carefully shaded, and the veinings should be worked  before the leaves are embroidered.
