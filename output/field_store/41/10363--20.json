It is used to separate gold and  silver from the foreign matter found with those metals. Calomel, a  valuable medicine, and vermilion, a color, are both preparations of  mercury.         _Globules_, small particles of matter having the form of a       ball or sphere.      What is a Thermometer?    An instrument for measuring temperature. It consists of a fine glass  tube, terminated at one end in a bulb, usually filled with mercury,  which expands or contracts according to the degree of heat or cold. On  the scale of the Fahrenheit thermometer, the freezing point of water  is marked 32 deg. and the boiling point at 212 deg.. In both the Centigrade  and the Reaumur scales the freezing point is at 0, and the boiling  point at 100 deg. in the Centigrade and at 80 deg. in Reaumur's. The invention  of this instrument dates from about the close of the sixteenth  century; but it is not known by whom it was first brought into use.         _Terminated_, finished, ended.      When and by whom were Watches and Clocks invented?    Watches were invented about the year 1500, but who was the inventor is  disputed. They were, however, of little value as time-keepers, before  the application of the spiral spring as a regulator to the balance;  the glory of this excellent invention lies between Dr. Hooke and M.  Huygens; the English ascribing it to the former, the Dutch, French,  &c., to the latter. Some assert that pocket-watches were first made  about 1477, at Nuremberg, in Germany. The most ancient clock of which  we possess any certain account, was made in 1634 by Henry de Wycke, a  German artist; it was erected in a tower of the palace of Charles V.,  king of France. The pendulum was applied by Huygens, in 1656.      What is a Pendulum?    A weight so suspended from a fixed point that it may easily swing  backward and forward; its oscillations are always performed in equal  times, provided the length of the pendulum and the gravity remain the  same. It is said that the idea of employing the pendulum for the  measurement of time, was first conceived by Galileo, while a young  man, upon his observing attentively the regular oscillations of a lamp  suspended from the roof of a church in Pisa. It was not, however, till  the time of Huygens that a method was devised of continuing its  motions, and registering the number of its oscillations.         _Oscillation_, a swinging backward and forward.         _Gravity_, the tendency of a body toward the centre of the       earth.         _Registering_, recording.    [Illustration: CHARCOAL BURNING.]    [Illustration: GOLD MINERS WASHING ORE.]      To whom is the invention of Gunpowder ascribed?    Most authors suppose it was invented by Bartholdus Schwartz, a monk of  Goslar, a town of Brunswick, in Germany, about the year 1320; it  appears, however, that it was known much earlier in many parts of the  world, and that the famous Roger Bacon, who died in 1292, knew its  properties; but it is not certain that he was acquainted with its  application to fire-arms.      Who was Roger Bacon?    A learned Franciscan, born at Ilchester, England, in 1214. He studied  at Oxford, and afterwards became professor at that great University.  He was familiar with every branch of human knowledge, but was  especially distinguished for his extraordinary proficiency in the  natural sciences. To him we owe the invention of the telescope; that  of gunpowder is ascribed to him, as stated above, although we have no  evidence to show whether he discovered its ingredients himself, or  whether he derived the knowledge from some ancient manuscripts. Bacon  suffered some from the ignorance of the age in which he lived, many of  his experiments being looked upon as magic. He died at Oxford in the  year 1294.      What is understood by Magic?    Magic is a term used to signify an unlawful and wicked kind of  science, depending, as was pretended, on the assistance of superhuman  beings and of departed souls. The term was anciently applied to all  kinds of learning, and in particular to the science of the Magi or  Wise Men of Persia, from whom it was called magic. _Natural_ magic is  no more than the application of natural active causes to passive  things or subjects, to produce effects apparently supernatural.         _Supernatural_, beyond the powers of nature; miraculous.      Of what is Gunpowder composed?    Of saltpetre,[10] sulphur, and charcoal, mixed together and powdered;  its explosive force when fired, is owing to the instantaneous and  abundant liberation of gaseous matter by the intense heat resulting  from the action of the combustibles upon the saltpetre. It is not  known by whom it was first applied to the purposes of war, but it is  certain that it was used early in the fourteenth century. Cannons were  used at the battle of Cressy, in 1346; small guns, or muskets, were  introduced into the Spanish army in 1521.    [Footnote 10: See Chapter XIII.]         _Explosive_, bursting out with violence and noise.         _Liberation_, a setting at liberty.      Is not Gunpowder highly combustible?    So combustible is gunpowder, that a single spark of fire, lighting  upon any of it, will cause it to explode with immense force; and  instances have occurred, when any store or magazine of it has taken  fire, that have been attended with the most fatal effects. It is  useful to the miner and engineer as a ready means of overcoming the  obstacles which are presented in their search for mineral treasures,  and in procuring materials for building. From many passages in the  ancient authors, there is reason to suppose that gunpowder, or a  composition extremely like it, was known to them; but it does not  appear to have been in general use, and the invention of fire-arms is  comparatively modern. Dynamite, a recent invention, has a still  greater explosive force than gunpowder.         _Engineer_, one who works or directs an engine.         _Obstacles_, hinderances, obstructions.      What is Saltpetre?    A bitter kind of salt, called by the ancients nitre, but more commonly  among us saltpetre. It is composed of nitric acid and potassa.[11] It  is found in earthy substances; sometimes native or pure, in the form  of a shapeless salt. Vast quantities are found in several of the  marly earths of the East Indies, China, Persia, and also in South  America. In India it is found naturally crystallized, and forming thin  crusts upon the surface of the earth. It is especially abundant in the  United States, being found in immense quantities in the limestone  caves in the south-western States.    [Footnote 11: See Potash, Chapter VII., article Glass.]      What do you mean by _Marly_?    Consisting of marl, a kind of earth composed of different proportions  of clay and carbonate of lime; it is much used for manure. There are  several different-colored marls, each possessing different qualities.  The most common are the red and the white, though there are grey,  brown, blue, and yellow colored marls.      What is a Telescope?    An optical instrument, which serves for discovering and viewing  distant objects, either directly by glasses, or by reflection. The  invention of the telescope is one of the noblest and most useful of  which modern ages can boast, since by means of this instrument the  wonderful motions of the planets and fixed stars, and all the heavenly  bodies, are revealed to us. The honor of the invention is much  disputed; it is certain, however, that the celebrated Galileo was the  first who improved the telescope so as to answer astronomical  purposes. The name is formed from two Greek words, one signifying  _far_, the other _to observe_.         _Optical_, relating to Optics, the science of vision.         _Astronomical_, relating to Astronomy.      Who was Galileo?    A most eminent astronomer and mathematician, born at Florence, in  Italy. His inventions and discoveries in Astronomy, Geometry, and  Mechanics, contributed much to the advancement of those sciences. He  died in 1642.         _Astronomer_, one versed in Astronomy.         _Mathematician_, one versed in Mathematics; a science which       treats of magnitude and number.      What is Astronomy?[12]    That science which teaches the knowledge of the heavenly bodies, with  the nature and causes of their various phenomena.    [Footnote 12: See Chapter xviii.]      What is Geometry?    An ancient, perfect, and beautiful science, which treats of the  relations and properties of lines, surfaces, and solids.      What is meant by Mechanics?    The science which investigates the laws of forces and powers, and  their action on bodies, either directly or by machinery. When the term  _mechanic_ is applied to a _person_, it means one skilled in  mechanics, accustomed to manual labor.         _Investigate_, to search, to inquire into.         _Manual_, performed by the hand.      What is a Microscope?    An optical instrument, by means of which very minute objects are  represented exceedingly large, and viewed very distinctly according to  the laws of refraction or reflection. Nothing certain is known  respecting the inventor of microscopes, or the exact time of their  invention, but that they were first used in Germany, about 1621.         _Minute_, small, diminutive.         _Refraction_, a change in the direction of a ray of light,       when it passes through transparent substances of different       densities.         _Reflection_, a turning back of a ray of light after       striking upon any surface.      What is the Steam Engine?    A machine that derives its moving power from the force of the steam  produced from boiling water, which is very great, especially when, as  in the steam engine, it is confined within a limited compass: this  useful machine is one of the most valuable presents that the arts of  life have received from the philosopher, and is of the greatest  importance in working mines; supplying "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16737"],[0,"International Language, Past, Present & Future (#17)"],[1,"opposing a universal language on the score of artificiality.                                         II           OUTLINE OF THE HISTORY OF THE IDEA OF A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE                            List of Schemes proposed    The story of Babel in the Old Testament reflects the popular feeling  that confusion of tongues is a hindrance and a curse. Similarly in the  New Testament the Pentecostal gift of tongues is a direct gift of God.  But apparently it was not till about 300 years ago that philosophers  began to think seriously about a world-language.    The earliest attempts were based upon the mediaeval idea that man might  attain to a perfect knowledge of the universe. The whole sum of things  might, it was thought, be brought by division and subdivision within  an orderly scheme of classification. To any conceivable idea or thing  capable of being represented by human speech might therefore be attached  a corresponding word, like a label, on a perfectly regular and logical  system. Words would thus be self-explanatory to any person who had  grasped the system, and would serve as an index or key to the things  they represented. Language thus became a branch of philosophy as the men  of the time conceived it, or at all events a useful handmaid. Thus arose  the idea of a \"philosophical language.\"    A very simple illustration will serve to show what is meant. Go into  a big library and look up any work in the catalogue. You will find  a reference number--say, 04582.g. 35,c. If you learnt the system of  classification of that library, the reference number would explain to  you where to find that particular book out of any number of millions.  The fact of the number beginning with a \"0\" would at once place the book  in a certain main division, and so on with the other numbers, till \"g\"  in that series gave you a fairly small subdivision. Within that, \"35\"  gives you the number of the case, and \"c\" the shelf within the case. The  book is soon run to earth.    Just so a word in a philosophical language. Suppose the word is _brabo_.  The final _o_ shows it to be a noun. The monosyllabic root shows it to  be concrete. The initial _b_ shows it to be in the animal category. The  subsequent letters give subdivisions of the animal kingdom, till the  word is narrowed down by its form to membership of one small class of  animals. The other members of the class will be denoted by an ordered  sequence of words in which only the letter denoting the individual is  changed. Thus, if _brabo_ means \"dog,\" _braco_ may be \"cat,\" and so on:  _brado_, _brafo_, _brago_... etc., according to the classification  set up.    Words, then, are reduced to mere formulae; and grammar, inflections,  etc., are similarly laid out on purely logical, systematic lines,  without taking any account of existing languages and their structure.  To languages of this type the historians of the universal language have  given the name of _a priori_ languages.    Directly opposed to these is the other group of artificial languages,  called _a posteriori_. These are wholly based on the principle of  borrowing from existing language: their artificiality consists in  choice of words and in regularization and simplification of vocabulary  and grammar. They avoid, as far as possible, any elements of arbitrary  invention, and confine themselves to adapting and making easier what  usage has already sanctioned.    Between the two main types come the _mixed languages_, partaking of the  nature of each.    The following list is taken from the _Histoire de la langue  universelle_, by MM. Couturat and Leau:                               I. A PRIORI LANGUAGES    1. The philosopher Descartes, in a letter of 1629, forecasts a system  (realized in our days by Zamenhof) of a regular universal grammar: words  to be formed with fixed roots and affixes, and to be in every case  immediately decipherable from the dictionary alone. He rejects this  scheme as fit \"for vulgar minds,\" and proceeds to sketch the outline  of all subsequent \"philosophic\" languages. Thus the great thinker  anticipates both types of universal language.    2. Sir Thomas Urquhart, 1653--_Logopandekteision_ (see next chapter).    3. Dalgarno, 1661--_Ars Signorum_. Dalgarno was a Scotchman born at  Aberdeen in 1626. His language is founded on the classification of  ideas. Of these there are seventeen main classes, represented by  seventeen letters. Each letter is the initial of all the words in its  class.    4. Wilkins, 1668--_An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical  Language_. Wilkins was Bishop of Chester, and first secretary and one  of the founders of the Royal Society. Present members please note. His  system is a development of Dalgarno's.    5. Leibnitz, 1646-1716. Leibnitz thought over this matter all his life,  and there are various passages on it scattered through his works,  though no one treatise is devoted to it. He held that the systems of  his predecessors were not philosophical enough. He dreamed of a logic  of thought applicable to all ideas. All complex ideas are compounds of  simple ideas, as non-primary numbers are of primary numbers. Numbers  can be compounded _ad infinitum._ So if numbers are translated into  pronouncible words, these words can be combined so as to represent every  possible idea.    6. Delormel, 1795 (An III)--_Projet d'une langue universelle_. Delormel  was inspired by the humanitarian ideas of the French Revolution. He  wished to bring mankind together in fraternity. His system rests on a  logical classification of ideas on a decimal basis.    7. Jean François Sudre, 1817--_Langue musicale universelle_. Sudre was a  schoolmaster, born in 1787. His language is founded on the seven notes  of the scale, and he calls it Solresol.    8. Grosselin, 1836--_Systeme de langue universelle_. A language  composed of 1500 words, called \"roots,\" with 100 suffixes, or modifying  terminations.    9. Vidal, 1844--_Langue universelle et analytique_. A curious  combination of letters and numbers.    10. Letellier, 1852-1855--_Cours complet de langue universelle_, and  many subsequent publications. Letellier was a former schoolmaster and  school inspector. His system is founded on the \"theory of language,\"  which is that the word ought to represent by its component letters an  analysis of the idea it conveys.    11. Abbé Bonifacio Sotos Ochando, 1852, Madrid. The abbé had been  a deputy to the Spanish Cortes, Spanish master to Louis Philippe's  children, a university professor, and director of a polytechnic  college in Madrid, etc. His language is a logical one, intended for  international scientific use, and chiefly for writing. He does not think  a spoken language for all purposes possible.    12. _Societé Internationale de linguistique_. First report dated 1856.  The object of the society was to carry out a radical reform of French  orthography, and to prepare the way for a universal language--\"the need  of which is beginning to be generally felt.\" In the report the idea of  adopting one of the most widely spoken national languages is considered  and rejected. The previous projects are reviewed, and that of Sotos  Ochando is recommended as the best. The _a posteriori_ principle is  rejected and the _a priori_ deliberately adopted. This is excusable,  owing to the fact that most projects hitherto had been _a priori_. The  philosopher Charles Renouvier gave proof of remarkable prescience by  condemning the _a priori_ theory in an article in _La Revue_, 1855, in  which he forecasts the _a posteriori_ plan.    13. Dyer, 1875--_Lingwalumina; or, the Language of Light_.    14. Reinaux, 1877.    15. Maldent, 1877--_La langue naturelle_. The author was a civil  engineer.    16. Nicolas, 1900--_Spokil_. The author is a ship's doctor and former  partisan of Volapük.    17. Hilbe, 1901--_Die Zablensprache_, Based on numbers which are  translated by vowels.    18. Dietrich, 1902--_Völkerverkehrssprache_.    19. Mannus Talundberg, 1904--_Perio, eine auf Logik und Gedachtnisskunst  aufgebaute Weltsprache_.                                II. MIXED LANGUAGES    These are chiefly Volapük and its derivates.    1. August Theodor von Grimm, state councillor of the Russian Empire,  worked out a \"programme for the formation of a universal language,\"  which contains some _a priori_ elements, as well as nearly all the  principles which subsequent authors of _a posteriori_ languages have  realized. This Grimm is not to be confused with the famous philologist  Jacob von Grimm, though he wrote about the same time.    2. Schleyer, 1879--_Volapük_. (See below.)    3. Verheggen, 1886--_Nal Bino_.    4. Menet, 1886--_Langue universelle_. An imitation of Volapük.    5. Bauer, 1886--_Spelin_. A development of Volapük with more words taken  from neutral languages.    6. St. de Max, 1887--_Bopal_. An imitation of Volapük.    7. Dormoy, 1887--_Balta_. A simplification of Volapük.    8. Fieweger, 1893--_Dil_. An exaggeration of Volapük for good and ill.    9. Guardiola, 1893--_Orba_. A fantastic language.    10. W. von Arnim, 1896--_Veltparl_. A derivative of Volapük.    11. Marchand, 1898--_Dilpok_. Simplified Volapük.    12. Bollack, 1899--_La langue bleue_. Aims merely at commercial and  common use. Ingenious, but too difficult for the memory.                            III. A POSTERIORI LANGUAGES    1. Faiguet, 1765--_Langue nouvelle_. Faiguet was treasurer of France. He  published his project, which is a scheme for simplifying grammar, in the  famous eighteenth-century encyclopaedia of Diderot and d'Alembert.    2. Schipfer, 1839--_Communicationssprache_. This scheme has an  historical interest for two reasons. First, the fact that it is founded  on French reflects the feeling of the time that French was, as he  says, \"already to a certain extent a universal language.\" The point of  interest is to compare the date when the projects began to be founded on  English. In 1879 Volapük took"]]]
