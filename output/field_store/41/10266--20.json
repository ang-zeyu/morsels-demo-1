He reported it all well, and  that the inhabitants were leading a mole existence, owing to the  constant shelling. The Boers evidently preferred dropping in shells at a  safe distance to risking their lives by a storming attack. With great  pride Mr. P. showed me a basket of carrier pigeons, by which he assured  me I could now communicate swiftly and safely with the garrison. He was  even kind enough to send off one at once on a trial trip, with a short  note signed with his name, informing Colonel Baden-Powell that I was at  Setlagoli, and that I would be able to forward any letters or  information they might wish to send. I had never had any experience of  such birds, and was delighted to think how much quicker they would  travel than old Boaz. When the pigeon was released, however, I must  confess it was rather disturbing to note that it did not seem at all  sure of the direction it should take, circling round at least twenty  times in the air. However, Mr. P. assured me this was their usual habit,  and that this particular bird knew its business, having taken several  prizes; so, as it eventually disappeared, I thought no more about it.  The next day Mr. P. left for Cape Town, and passed out of our ken, but  we were soon to be reminded of him in an unpleasant fashion.    On going into the dining-room to lunch one day, I saw little Mr.----, a  kinsman of Mrs. Fraser's, and particularly short of stature, with an axe  in hand, in the act of taking up the boards in a corner of the room,  revealing as he did so a sort of shallow cellar, with no light or  ventilation. Watching the operation was another man, an Englishman, the  dispossessed manager of a local store, who had sought a temporary  lodging at the hotel, and was a big, strong individual, over 6 feet in  height. I inquired in amazement, of this strangely assorted pair, what  they were trying to do. \"We are going to hide, Lady Sarah,\" chirped the  former. \"The Boers are on the premises.\" So saying, he was about to  descend into the cavity, and evidently expected the companionship of his  tall friend. When I pointed out to them that they would probably  suffocate in this modern Black Hole of Calcutta, the little man  proceeded to dance round the room, still shouldering his axe, jibbering  the while: \"I will not go to fight; I am an American. I will not be put  in the front rank to be shot by the English, or made to dig trenches.\"  The whole scene was so comic that I sat down and laughed, and the climax  was reached when the cock-sparrow, who had always talked so big of what  he was going to do and to say to the Boers, crawled under the old grand  piano in the farther corner of the big room. I was forced to tell him  that no American or Englishman could be found in such an ignominious  position, should the house be searched, and I even assured the little  gentleman that I did not think it was the least likely his services  would be wanted. The other man, whose position was more risky, I advised  to lie down on the sofa and feign illness; and I really believe anxiety  and worry had so preyed on him that he was as ill as he looked. When  calm had been restored, I sat down to lunch, Mrs. Fraser coming in at  intervals to report what our visitors were doing at the store. They had  demanded coffee and many tins of salmon and sardines. Of these  delicacies they seemed particularly fond, eating the latter with their  fingers, after which they drank the oil, mixed for choice with golden  syrup. After their repast they fitted themselves out in clothes and  luxuries, such as silver watches and chains, white silk  pocket-handkerchiefs, cigarettes, saddles, and even harness, taking  altogether goods to the amount of about L50. This amusement finished,  they proceeded to practise shooting, setting up bottles at a distance of  about 50 yards. We followed all their doings from behind the green  Venetian blinds, kept down on account of the heat. Up to this time none  of them had come up to the house, for which we had reason to be  grateful, as the \"dop\" they had found, and quickly finished, was  beginning to affect their demeanour and spirits, particularly of the one  named Dietrich, who appeared to be the boss of the party. At last the  immediate reason for their visit filtered out. This slightly intoxicated  gentleman inquired of Mr. Fraser where they could find a man named Mr.  P. and the English lady of whom he had written. The old gentleman, who  could be more than common deaf when he chose, affected utter vacancy at  the mention of these individuals, merely stating that he knew a man of  the name of P. fifteen years ago. Then the whole story was told. They  had captured our pigeon, with its tell-tale note. This confiding bird  had flown straight to the laager, had perched on the General's house,  where it had been shot by this same Dietrich, and we owed the present  visit to the information supplied therein by Mr. P., Dietrich informing  us he attributed this occurrence to the Almighty working for the Boers.  They stated they were now awaiting the arrival of the _Veldtcornet_ and  of Mr. Lamb, a neighbouring farmer, whom they had sent for, and they  proceeded to make their preparations to spend the night. After supper we  were relieved to hear Mr. Lamb's cheerful voice, as he rode up in the  dark with the jovial Dietrich, who had ridden out to meet him, and who,  it appeared, was an old friend of his. I must say the pleasure of  meeting was more on the Dutchman's side than on the Englishman's. By  this time the former was quite intoxicated, and Mr. Lamb cleverly  managed to get him to his room, and after having, as he thought,  disposed of him, he came and joined us on the stoep. There we freely  discussed our visitors, and were having a cheery conversation, when I  suddenly looked up, and round the corner of the verandah saw the  unsteady form of a typical Boer--slouch hat, bandolier, and rifle,  complete--staggering towards us, truly a weird apparition. The rising  moon shining on the rifle-barrel made it glitter like silver. I confess  I disappeared round the corner to my room with more haste than dignity.  To Boers by daytime, when sober, I had by now become accustomed, but at  night, after liberal doses of \"dop,\" armed with a loaded rifle, I  preferred their room to their company. Luckily, Mr. Lamb was equal to  the occasion, and persuaded Dietrich to return to his quarters, in spite  of his assurance that he (Dietrich) \"was the man who watched, and who  did not sleep.\" With the morning arrived nine or ten more, including the  newly-appointed _Veldtcornet_, by name De Koker, who had been lately  convicted of sheep-stealing. After a long idle morning and more  refreshments, they all adjourned to the living-room, where, with much  difficulty, one of them stumbled through the reading of a printed  proclamation, which enacted that \"This country now being part of the  Transvaal, the residents must within seven days leave their homes or  enrol themselves as burghers.\" Nothing was mentioned about fighting, so  all there complied with what was required--namely, to sign their names  on a blank sheet of paper. By evening all had left for Mosita, as Mr. P.  had also mentioned Mr. Keeley's name in his unlucky note. Three,  however, remained to keep a watch on myself, and one of these, I  regretted to observe, was the jovially-inclined Dietrich. It can be  imagined that our irritation with Mr. P. was great for having so  foolishly mentioned names and places, and still more with the idiotic  bird, the real origin of a very unpleasant two days. I reflected that,  if these were the tricks carrier-pigeons were wont to play, I greatly  preferred the old nigger as a letter-carrier in wartime.    We were not to wait long for more developments. Next day at dusk arrived  a large cavalcade, which included Mr. Keeley, a prisoner. He went on  with his escort at daybreak, leaving us full of sympathy for his poor  wife. I sent by his bodyguard, under the command of another Dietrich,  brother to the drunkard, who seemed a decent sort of man, a letter to  General Snyman, begging for a pass into Mafeking to rejoin my husband.  Mr. Keeley told me their Intelligence Department was very perfect, as  they had been aware of every one of my movements since I left Mafeking,  and even of my rides during the last fortnight. He also told me General  Cronje and a great number of Boers had left Mafeking and trekked South.  This encouraged me in my belief that it would be better for me to be in  that beleaguered town than to submit to the possible insults of Boer  sentinels at Setlagoli.    The next day was Sunday, and in the morning returned the energetic  Veldtcornet De Koker. He had heard of my letter to Snyman, and, wishing  to be important, had come to offer me a pass to the laager for a  personal interview with the General, assuring me the latter was always  very polite to ladies. He even wished to escort me there that very day.  However, I had no mind to act hastily, so I made an excuse of the mules  being away--also that I did not like to travel on a Sunday. This latter  reason he fully appreciated, and arranged with me to come to his house  the following day, for which purpose he left me a permit, vilely  scrawled in Dutch. I mentally reserved to myself the decision as to  keeping the rendezvous. We sat down to breakfast together, although, as  he could speak no English and I could speak no Dutch, the conversation  was nil. He was pleased with the cigarette I offered him, and observed  me with some curiosity, probably never having seen anything approaching  an English lady previously. Before he left, I complained, through an  interpreter, of the insobriety of my self-constituted sentinel Dietrich,  remarking it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14470"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 12 (#17)"],[1," in this evening's _Union_  which deals with your personality was written by me and inserted by me  in the paper without Oldendorf's knowledge.    COLONEL.    It can interest me little to know who wrote the article.    BOLZ (_courteously_).    But I consider it important to tell you that it is not by Oldendorf  and that Oldendorf knew nothing about it. My friend was so taken up  these last weeks with his own sad and painful experiences that he left  the management of the paper entirely to me. For all that has lately  appeared in it I alone am responsible.    COLONEL.    And why do you impart this information?    BOLZ.    You have sufficient penetration to realize, Colonel, that, after the  scene which took place today between you and my friend, Oldendorf as a  man of honor could neither write such an article nor allow it to  appear in his paper.    COLONEL.    How so, sir? In the article itself I saw nothing unsuitable.    BOLZ.    The article exposes my friend in your eyes to the suspicion of having  tried to regain your good-will by unworthy flattery. Nothing is  further from his thoughts than such a method. You, Colonel, are too  honorable a man yourself to consider a mean action natural to your  friend.    COLONEL.    You are right. (_Aside_.) This defiance is unbearable! (_Aloud_.) Is  your explanation at an end?    BOLZ.    It is. I must add still another: that I myself regret very much having  written this article.    COLONEL.    I imagine I do not wrong you in assuming that you have already written  others that were still more to be regretted.    BOLZ (_continuing_).    I had the article printed before hearing of your last interview with  Oldendorf. (_Very courteously_.) My reason for regretting it is, that  it is not quite true. I was too hasty in describing your personality  to the public. Today, at least, it is no longer a true portrait; it is  flattering.    COLONEL (_bursting out_).    Well, by the devil, that is rude!    BOLZ.    Your pardon--it is only true. I wish to convince you that a journalist  can regret having written falsehoods.    COLONEL.    Sir! (_Aside_.) I must restrain myself, or he will always get the  better of me.--Dr. Bolz, I see that you are a clever man and know your  trade. Since, in addition, you seem inclined today to speak only the  truth, I must beg you to tell me further if you, too, organized the  demonstrations which purport to represent to me public sentiment.    BOLZ (_bowing_).    I have, as a matter of fact, not been inactive in the matter.    COLONEL (_holding out the letter to him, angrily_).    Did you prompt these, too?    BOLZ.    In part, Colonel. This poem is the heart-outpouring of an honest youth  who reveres in you the paternal friend of Oldendorf and the ideal of a  chivalrous hero. I inspired him with the courage to send you the poem.  It was well-meant, at any rate. The poet will have to seek another  ideal. The address comes from women and girls who constitute the  Association for the Education of Orphans. The Association includes  among its members Miss Ida Berg. I myself composed this address for  the ladies; it was written down by the daughter of the wine-merchant  Piepenbrink.    COLONEL.    That was just about my opinion concerning these letters. It is  needless to ask if you too are the contriver who sent me the citizens?    BOLZ.    At all events I did not discourage them. [_From without a male chorus  of many voices_.]        Hail! Hail! Hail!    Within the precincts of our town,    Blessed by each burgher's son,    There dwells a knight of high renown,    A noble, faithful one.      Who doth in need for aid apply    To this brave knight sends word;    For love is his bright panoply    And mercy is his sword.      We laud him now in poem and song    Protector of the lowly throng.    The Colonel, the Colonel,    The noble Colonel Berg!      COLONEL (_rings after the first measure of the song_. CARL _enters_).    You are to let no one in if you wish to remain in my service.    CARL.    Colonel, they are already in the garden, a great company of them. It  is the glee club; the leaders are already at the steps.    BOLZ (_who has opened the window_).    Very well sung, Colonel--from _La Juive_--he is the best tenor in town  and the accompaniment is exceedingly original.    COLONEL (_aside_).    It is enough to drive one mad. [_Aloud_.] Show the gentlemen in!    _Exit_ CARL. _At the end of the verse enter_ FRITZ KLEINMICHEL _and  two other gentlemen_.    FRITZ KLEINMICHEL.    Colonel, the local glee club asks to be allowed to sing you some  songs--kindly listen to the little serenade as a feeble expression of  the general veneration and love.    COLONEL.    Gentlemen, I regret exceedingly that a case of illness in my family  makes it desirable for me to have you curtail your artistic  performance. I thank you for your intentions, and beg you will sing to  Professor Oldendorf the songs you had designed for me.    FRITZ KLEINMICHEL.    We considered it our duty first to greet you before visiting your  friend. In order not to disturb invalids, we will, with your  permission, place ourselves further away from the house, in the  garden.    COLONEL.    Do as you please.    [FRITZ KLEINMICHEL _and the two others leave_.]    Is this act, too, an invention of yours?    BOLZ (_with a bow_).    Partially at least. But you are too kind, Colonel, if you look upon me  as the sole originator of all these demonstrations. My share in it is  really a small one. I have done nothing but edit public opinion a  little; all these different people are not dolls, which a skilful  puppet-man can move around by pulling wires. These are all voices of  capable and honorable persons, and what they have said to you is  actually the general opinion of the town--that is to say, the  conviction of the better and more sensible elements in the town. Were  that not the case I should have labored quite in vain with these good  people to bring a single one of them into your house.    COLONEL.    He is right again, and I am always in the wrong!    BOLZ (_very courteously_).    Permit me to explain further, that I consider these tender expressions  of general regard out of place now, and that I deeply regret my share  in them. Today at least, no friend of Oldendorf has any occasion to  praise your chivalrous sentiments or your self-effacement.    COLONEL (_going toward him_).    Doctor Bolz, you use the privilege of your profession to speak  recklessly, and are insulting outsiders in a way that exhausts my  patience. You are in my house, and it is a customary social amenity to  respect the domicile of one's opponent.    BOLZ (_leaning on a chair, good-naturedly_).    If you mean by that that you have a right to expel from your house  unwelcome guests you did not need to remind me of it, for this very  day you shut your doors on another whose love for you gave him a  better right to be here than I have.    COLONEL.    Sir, such brazen-facedness I have never yet experienced.    BOLZ (_with a bow_).    I am a journalist, and claim what you have just called the privilege  of my profession.    [_Grand march by brass band. Enter_ CARL _quickly_.]    COLONEL (_going toward him_).    Shut the garden gate; no one is to come in. [_The music stops_.]    BOLZ (_at the window_).    You are locking your friends out; this time I am innocent.    CARL.    Ah, Colonel, it is too late. The singers are back there in the garden,  and in front a great procession is approaching the house; it is Mr.  von Senden and the entire club.    [_Goes to rear of stage_.]    COLONEL (_to_ BOLZ).    Sir, I wish the conversation between us to end.    BOLZ (_speaking back at him from the window_).    In your position, Colonel, I find the desire very natural. [_Looking  out again_.] A brilliant procession! They all carry paper lanterns,  and on the lanterns are inscriptions! Besides the ordinary club  mottoes, I see others. Why isn't Bellmaus ever looking when he might  be helping the newspaper! [_Taking out a note book_.] We'll quickly  note those inscriptions for our columns. [_Over his shoulder_.] Pardon  me! Oh, that is truly remarkable: \"Down with our enemies!\" And here a  blackish lantern with white letters--\"Death to the _Union_!\" Holy  thunder! [_Calls out of the window_.] Good evening, gentlemen!    COLONEL (_going up to him_).    Sir, you're in league with the devil!    BOLZ (_turning quickly around_).    Very kind of you, Colonel, to show yourself at the window with me.    [COLONEL _retreats_.]    SENDEN (_from below_).    Whose voice is that!    BOLZ.    Good evening, Mr. von Senden!--The gentleman with the dark lantern and  white inscription would oblige us greatly by kindly lifting it up to  the Colonel. Blow your light out, man, and hand me the lantern. So,  thank you--man with the witty motto! [_Pulling in the stick and  lantern_.] Here, Colonel, is the document of the brotherly love your  friends cherish toward us. [_Tears the lantern from the stick_.] The  lantern for you, the stick for the lantern-bearer! [_Throws the stick  out of the window_.] I have the honor to bid you good day!    [_Turns to go, meets_ ADELAIDE.]    _Male chorus, close at hand again: \"Within the precincts of our town;\"  trumpets join in; then many voices: \"Long live_ COLONEL BERG!  _Hurrah!_\" ADELAIDE _has entered on the left, during the noise_.    ADELAIDE.    Well, is the whole town upside-down today?    BOLZ.    I've done my share; he is half converted. Good night!    COLONEL (_throwing the lantern on the ground--in a rage_).    To the devil with all journalists!    _Male chorus_, SENDEN, BLUMENBERG _and many other gentlemen, in  procession, are visible through the door into the garden; the  deputation comes in; chorus and lantern-bearers form a group at the  entrance_.    SENDEN (_with a loud voice while the curtain is lowered_).    Colonel, the Club has the honor of greeting its revered members!          ACT IV      SCENE I"]]]
