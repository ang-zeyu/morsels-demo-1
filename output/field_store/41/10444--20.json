So, in all probability, were more people and of other countries  to emigrate to Soudan, they would soon become Soudanee, and lose their  nationality. In these countries of Soudan above-mentioned, Mahommedanism  has been but lately professed. But the great distinguishing mark between  paganism and Mahommedanism appears to be the drinking or not drinking  gia, the latter being the people who of course abstain from this  intoxicating beverage.    Overweg says, that within three-quarters of an hour's walk are found  hereabout granite, sandstone, and basalt, a variety of stones somewhat  remarkable.    The study of _sau_, \"footsteps\" of men and animals, is quite a science  in this part of the world. The Fezzanee are reckoned the most expert in  this knowledge; they are said to be able to distinguish the footsteps of  people when printed upon the trunk of a palm, the print-step being made  by dipping the feet in water! As to animals, the people observe near the  neighbouring rocks the sau of the lion--a very deep, heavy impression of  his five claws, of the monkey, the hare, the gazelle, the fox, the  jackal, the hyaena, the mouse, &c. &c. Indeed, we appear to be  surrounded with animals; and in the morning I found the sau of the dog,  the cat, the hare, and the mouse, on the sandy floor of my tent. It is  my intention, before I leave Africa, to draw the forms of the footsteps  of the more remarkable animals. _Inshallah!_    _4th._--Visit from his highness the Sheikh every day. He is now kind  enough to send me every morning--at the suggestion of his principal  wife--a small can of milk, which, besides the value of the milk itself,  saves my sugar, enabling me to drink tea and coffee without sweetening.  This evening the _shara_ was brought of the arrival of couriers from the  salt-caravan, to say it was near. Like the Arabs, for this shara or  news, or first advice of the coming of something good or agreeable, the  Kailouees ask some present. We gave a little bit of sugar to the slave  who brought the welcome intelligence.    _Dec. 5th to 9th._--I was occupied with vocabulary of Haussa and Bornou.  Weather mild and misty, but a little cold this morning; thermometer, at  three-quarters of an hour after sunrise, 43 deg..    Nearly all the salt-caravan has arrived, and proceeded in advance,  coming in small detachments. They rendezvous in a fine wady full of  herbage, with water higher up. We are expected to leave in a few days,  three or four at most. Nothing seems now to detain En-Noor. But the  Fadeea have returned from the Hagar, finding themselves not pursued.  They very naturally prefer their own fine valley in Asben to the stony,  desert wilds of Hagars. I suppose a razzia will be executed against  them, for the restoration of the camels of Tintaghoda, on the return of  the salt-caravan from Soudan.    En-Noor gives a tremendously unfavourable account of the Oulimad, who  occupy the desert of Sahara between Aghadez and Timbuctoo, and keep the  road there shut against caravans. He says, they would sleep in our tents  in the day, eat and drink with us; but in the night they would carry  away the tent, and make themselves clothing with it. In fact, En-Noor  considers them the veriest barbarians in this region of Africa. There  may be a little exaggeration in this, and the Oulimad may not be worse  than the Hagars of Ghemama, or even than some of his own people. The  Kailouees do not hunt, nor do they cultivate the soil; so that this  country abounds with animals. Some of the country is extremely wild and  rocky, and affords many a retired den for the lions, who descend from  the rocks and prowl abroad for prey in great numbers. Their footmarks  frequently cover the length and breadth of the wadys. Barth himself saw  (very fortunately, for it is a sight seen by very few persons indeed) as  many as five together. Monkeys also abound in great numbers. I related  to En-Noor the anecdote, as a joke, of the monkey shaving the cat in  Paris; but this he took seriously, for he observed, \"That is nothing; I  have seen the monkeys crack lice just like men.\" It is always a  difficult matter to translate a joke to these people. Overweg has been  out these last two days hunting for ostrich eggs, in the places which  these birds frequent. He saw their footprints, dung, feathers, &c., and  two specimens, but found no eggs. It appears this is a most difficult  bird to catch.    En-Noor continues to be very friendly. I get milk now every morning, for  which I pay sugar and coffee. His highness and his people went out  yesterday to dig a well, about two hours distant. All the water in this  place is exhausted. It appears to be merely a deposit of rain-water  under the sand, at a depth of from four or five to eight feet. It  becomes, as in this case, entirely exhausted before the commencement of  the next rains; but of course there are some springs, and many wells  which are not dried up during the whole year.    N.B.--If I remain a month at Zinder, I must make a little excursion  amongst the Bornou villages and see the rustic life of the people; but I  fear it will be a bad place to hear the pure Bornouese language. I still  hope to go off early to Sakkatou, and finish quickly with Soudan. In  these matters the Germans are better off than I am, and have not to wait  for money.[10]     [10] Nearly the whole of this long account of a residence in        Aheer consists in the journals of Mr. Richardson of        disjointed fragments, jotted down almost without any        connexion. This was necessarily the case. Few incidents,        save an occasional visit from thieves, or a dispute with        that strange old gentleman, Sultan En-Noor, diversified        this period. However, the simple commonplace book of a        traveller in a totally new country can never be without its        interest. No doubt Mr. Richardson would have attempted, had        he survived, to throw all these observations into a        picture; but any attempt to do so on my part would have        probably resulted in the omission of characteristic traits,        and the introduction of extraneous ideas.

It is reported that we leave here to-morrow, or the day following. There  is arrived from Aghadez the first man of that city after the sultan,  called Amagai. He is come here respecting the affairs of the Fadeea.  En-Noor also asked to-day for a list of all the things taken by force  from us on the frontiers. It appears the Sultan of Aghadez had captured  the Sheikh of the Fadeea, or some one sheikh, and allowed him to go out  of prison on the promise that he would restore all the things taken from  us--but not to us; so these Sultans and Sheikhs of Aheer will probably  get all these things back, and divide the spoil. But, nevertheless, it  is better that the people in authority should have them, than that they  should remain in the possession of the robbers, the lawless plundering  tribes of the frontier. Probably these people will be more cautious how  they plunder another caravan of Christians. It will always be a  satisfaction to us that the robbers were made to disgorge their booty. I  have also heard that a small camel was brought in exchange for my large  lost one; and En-Noor sent it back, ordering them to restore the large  camel of the boat. My camel has been to fetch salt from Bilma.    The children call Tesaoua, and the countries thereabout, Haussa, and say  it is near, and that they go on donkeys. From this it is certain this  portion of Soudan still has the ancient name of Haussa. Afaou is merely  the Bornou name for Haussa, there being no place or district of that  name. All these countries have most of them two names, or two  pronunciations of the same name; one by the natives, and one by the  Moorish merchants and other strangers. Thus the village of En-Noor is  called by strangers Tintalous, and by the people themselves Chintullus.  Travellers had better adhere to the name the place has amongst the  strangers and foreign merchants, otherwise their narrative might be  questioned by the people abroad, who do not know the native name.  Maradee has its native name of Mariadi, but if you were to mention this  name in Mourzuk and Tripoli none would know the country of which you  were speaking. In fact, it is just the same as calling Florence Firenza,  when speaking to persons who have not travelled in Tuscany, or who are  unacquainted with Italian. I continue much occupied with the Bornouese  and Haussa languages, and am now collecting the names of insects and  animals. This is extremely difficult, as for many of the animals of  Soudan there are no Arabic names.    I measured an ant-track, and found it 125 feet. The ants were fetching  the cottony dried blossom of a withered plant, and were amazingly busy.  The tracks did not wind much. I noticed, also, in my walk, the footmarks  of hares and many other animals. This country is full of live things.    _11th._--I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18560"],[0,"Chopin and Other Musical Essays (#17)"],[1,"Baron, \"a delightfully innocent, childish soul, tender  and pensive, attached to me and to everything artistic by the most  sincere love, extremely musical--in short, just the kind of a girl I  could wish to marry.\" He did become engaged to her, but the following  year the engagement was dissolved; and soon after this he discovered  that his artistic admiration for Clara Wieck had assumed the form of  love. Although her father opposed their union several years, on  account of Schumann's poverty, the young couple often met, and not  only in the music-room. In 1833 he writes to his mother regarding  Clara: \"The other day, when we went to Connewitz (we take a two or  three hours' walk almost daily), I heard her say to herself, 'How  happy I am! how happy!' Who would not like to hear that! On this road  there are a number of very useless stones in the midst of the  footpath. Now, as it happens in conversation that I more frequently  look up than down, she always walks behind me and gently pulls my coat  at every stone, lest I may fall.\"    It was most fortunate for Schumann that his bride and wife was one of  the greatest living pianists. For, owing to the accident to his hand,  though he could still improvise, he could not appear in public to  interpret his own compositions, which depended so much for their  success on a sympathetic performance, since they differed so greatly  from the prevalent style of Hummel and the classical masters, that  even so gifted a musician as Mendelssohn failed to understand them.  But Clara made it the task of her life to secure him recognition, and  this was an additional bond that united their souls. \"When you are  mine,\" he writes, \"you will occasionally hear something new from me; I  believe you will often inspire me, and the mere fact that I shall then  frequently hear my own compositions will cheer me up;\" and: \"Your  Romance showed me once more that we must become man and wife. Every  one of your thoughts comes from my soul, even as I owe all my music  to you.\" To Dorn he writes that many of his compositions, including  the Noveletten, the Kreisleriana, and the Kinderscenen, were inspired  by Clara; and it is well known that his love became the incentive to  the composition, in one year, of over a hundred wonderful songs--his  previous compositions, up to 1840, having all been for the piano  alone. In the last letter of this collection he says: \"Sometimes it  appears to me as if I were treading entirely new paths in music;\" and  there are many other passages showing that he realized well that the  very things which his contemporaries criticised and decried as  eccentric and obscure (Hummel, _e.g._, objects to his frequent changes  of harmony and his originality!), were really his most inspired  efforts. Though he never allowed the desire for popularity to  influence his work, yet he occasionally craves appreciation. \"I am  willing to confess that I should be greatly pleased if I could succeed  in composing something which would impel the public, after hearing you  play it, to run against the walls in their delight; for vain we  composers are, even though we have no reason to be so.\" It must have  given him a strange shock when an amateur asked him, at one of his  wife's concerts in Vienna, if he also was musical!    In her efforts to win appreciation for her husband, Clara was nobly  assisted by Liszt. Just like Wagner, Schumann was not at first very  favorably impressed with Liszt, owing to the sensational flavor of his  early performances. But he soon changed his mind, especially when  Liszt played some of his (Schumann's) compositions. \"Many things were  different from my conception of them, but always '_genial_,' and  marked by a tenderness and boldness of expression which even he  presumably has not at his command every day. Becker was the only other  person present, and he had tears in his eyes.\" And two days later:  \"But I must tell you that Liszt appears to me grander every day. This  morning he again played at Raimund Haertel's, in a way to make us all  tremble and rejoice, some etudes of Chopin, a number of the Rossini  soirees, and other things.\" Of other contemporary pianists Hummel,  \"ten years behind the time,\" and Thalberg, whom he liked better as  pianist than as composer, are alluded to. Yet he writes in 1830 that  he intends going to Weimar, \"for the sly reason of being able to _call  myself_ a pupil of Hummel.\" Wieck, his father-in-law, he esteemed  greatly as teacher and adviser, but it offended him deeply that Wieck  should have followed the common error of estimating genius with a  yard-stick, and asked where were his \"Don Juan\" and his \"Freischuetz?\"  His enthusiasm for Schubert, Chopin, and especially for Bach, finds  frequent expression. Bach's \"Well-Tempered Clavichord\" he declares is  his \"grammar, and the best of all grammars. The fugues I have  analyzed successively to the minutest details; the advantage resulting  from this is great, and has a morally bracing effect on the whole  system, for Bach was a man through and through; in him there is  nothing done by halves, nothing morbid, but all is written for time  eternal.\" Six years later: \"Bach is my daily bread; from him I derive  gratification and get new ideas--'compared with him we are all  children,' Beethoven has said, I believe.\" One day a caller remarked  that Bach was old and wrote in old-fashioned manner: \"But I told him  he was neither old nor new, but much more than that, namely, eternal.  I came near losing my temper.\" Concerning the unappreciative  Mendelssohn, he writes to Clara:    \"I am told that he is not well disposed toward me. I should feel sorry  if that were true, since I am conscious of having preserved noble  sentiments toward him. If you know anything let me hear it on  occasion; that will at least make me cautious, and I do not wish to  squander anything where I am ill-spoken of. Concerning my relations  toward him as a musician [1838], I am quite aware that I could learn  of him for years; but he, too, some things of me. Brought up under  similar circumstances, destined for music from childhood, I would  surpass you all--that I feel from the energy of my inventive powers.\"    Concerning this energy he says, some time after this, when he had  just finished a dozen songs: \"Again I have composed so much that I am  sometimes visited by a mysterious feeling. Alas! I cannot help it. I  could wish to sing myself to death, like a nightingale.\"    One of the most interesting bits of information contained in this  correspondence is that, when quite a young man, Schumann commenced a  treatise on musical aesthetics. In view of the many epoch-making  thoughts contained in his two volumes of collected criticisms, it is  very much to be regretted that this plan was not carried out. On one  question of musical psychology light is thrown by several of these  letters. Like many other composers, it seems that Schumann often, if  not generally, had some pictorial image or event in his mind in  composing. \"When I composed my first songs,\" he writes to Clara, \"I  was entirely within you. Without such a bride one cannot write such  music.\" \"I am affected by everything that goes on in the  world--politics, literature, mankind. In my own manner I meditate on  everything, which then seeks utterance in music. That is why many of  my compositions are so difficult to understand, because they relate to  remote affairs; and often significant, because all that's remarkable  in our time affects me, and I have to give it expression in musical  language.\" One of the letters to Clara begins: \"Tell me what the first  part of the Fantasia suggests to you. Does it not bring many pictures  before your mind?\" Concerning the \"Phantasiestuecke\" he writes: \"When  they were finished I was delighted to find the story of Hero and  Leander in them.... Tell me if you, too, find this picture fitting the  music.\" \"The Papillons,\" he says once more, are intended to be a  musical translation of the final scene in Jean Paul's \"Flegeljahre.\"    Believers in telepathy will be interested in the following additional  instance of composing with a visual object in mind: \"I wrote to you  concerning a presentiment; it occurred to me on the days from March  24th to 27th, when I was at work on my new composition. There is a  place in it to which I constantly recurred; it is as if some one  sighed, 'Ach, Gott!' from the bottom of his heart. While composing, I  constantly saw funeral processions, coffins, unhappy people in  despair; and when I had finished, and long searched for a title, the  word 'corpse-fantasia' continually obtruded itself. Is not that  remarkable? During the composition, moreover, I was often so deeply  affected that tears came to my eyes, and yet I knew not why and had no  reason--till Theresa's letter arrived, which made everything clear.\"  His brother was on his death-bed.           *       *       *       *       *    The collection of Schumann's letters so far under consideration met  with such a favorable reception that a second edition was soon called  for, and this circumstance no doubt promoted the publication of a  second series, extending to 1854, two years before Schumann's sad  death in the lunatic asylum near Bonn. This second volume includes a  considerable number of business letters to his several publishers. In  one of these he confides to Dr. Haertel his plan of collecting and  revising his musical criticisms, and publishing them in two volumes.  But as this letter was, a few months later, followed by a similar one  addressed to the publisher Wigand, who subsequently printed the  essays, it is to be inferred that Breitkopf & Haertel, though assured  of the future of Schumann's compositions, doubted the financial value  of his musical essays--an attitude pardonable at a time when there was  still a ludicrous popular prejudice against literary utterances by a  musician. In 1883, however,"]]]
