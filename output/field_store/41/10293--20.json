THE REAPER AND THE FLOWERS.    Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (b. 1807, d. 1882), the son of Hon. Stephen  Longfellow, an eminent lawyer, was born in Portland, Maine. He graduated  at Bowdoin College in 1825. After spending four years in Europe, he was  Professor of Modern Languages and Literature at Bowdoin till 1835, when he  was appointed to the chair of Modern Languages and Belles-lettres in  Harvard University. He resigned his professorship in 1854, after which  time he resided in Cambridge, Mass. Longfellow wrote many original works  both in verse and prose, and made several translations, the most famous of  which is that of the works of Dante. His poetry is always chaste and  elegant, showing traces of careful scholarship in every line. The numerous  and varied editions of his poems are evidences of their popularity.    1. There is a Reaper whose name is Death,       And, with his sickle keen,     He reaps the bearded grain at a breath,       And the flowers that grow between.    2. \"Shall I have naught that is fair?\" saith he;       \"Have naught but the bearded grain?     Though the breath of these flowers is sweet to me,       I will give them all back again.\"    3. He gazed at the flowers with tearful eyes,       He kissed their drooping leaves;     It was for the Lord of Paradise       He bound them in his sheaves.    4. \"My Lord has need of these flowerets gay,\"       The Reaper said, and smiled;     \"Dear tokens of the earth are they,       Where he was once a child.    5. \"They shall all bloom in the fields of light,       Transplanted by my care,     And saints, upon their garments white,       These sacred blossoms wear.\"    6. And the mother gave in tears and pain       The flowers she most did love;     She knew she should find them all again       In the fields of light above.    7. O, not in cruelty, not in wrath,       The Reaper came that day,     'T was an angel visited the green earth,       And took the flowers away.      DEFINITIONS.--3. Sheaves, bundles of grain. 4.

Nathaniel Hawthorne (b.1804, d.1864) was born in Salem, Mass. He graduated  at Bowdoin College in 1825. His earliest literary productions, written for  periodicals, were published in two volumes--the first in 1837, the second  in 1842--under the title of \"Twice-Told Tales,\" \"Mosses from an Old  Manse,\" another series of tales and sketches, was published in 1845. From  1846 to 1850 he was surveyor of the port of Salem. In 1852 he was  appointed United States consul for Liverpool. After holding this office  four years, he traveled for some time on the continent. His most popular  works are \"The Scarlet Letter,\" a work showing a deep knowledge of human  nature, \"The House of the Seven Gables,\" \"The Blithedale Romance.\" and  \"The Marble Faun,\" an Italian romance, which is regarded by many as the  best of his works. Being of a modest and retiring disposition, Mr.  Hawthorne avoided publicity. Most of his works are highly imaginative. As  a prose writer he has no superior among American authors. He died at  Plymouth, N. H., while on a visit to the White Mountains for his health.    [SCENE.--The corner of two principal streets. The Town Pump  talking through its nose.]    1. Noon, by the north clock! Noon, by the east! High noon, too, by those  hot sunbeams which fall, scarcely aslope, upon my head, and almost make  the water bubble and smoke in the trough under my nose. Truly, we public  characters have a tough time of it! And among all the town officers,  chosen at the yearly meeting, where is he that sustains, for a single  year, the burden of such manifold duties as are imposed, in perpetuity,  upon the Town Pump?    2. The title of town treasurer is rightfully mine, as guardian of the best  treasure the town has. The overseers of the poor ought to make me their  chairman, since I provide bountifully for the pauper, without expense to  him that pays taxes. I am at the head of the fire department, and one of  the physicians of the board of health. As a keeper or the peace, all water  drinkers confess me equal to the constable. I perform some of the duties  of the town clerk, by promulgating public notices, when they are pasted on  my front.    3. To speak within bounds, I am chief person of the municipality, and  exhibit, moreover, an admirable pattern to my brother officers by the  cool, steady, upright, downright, and impartial discharge of my business,  and the constancy with which I stand to my post. Summer or winter, nobody  seeks me in vain; for all day long I am seen at the busiest corner, just  above the market, stretching out my arms to rich and poor alike; and at  night I hold a lantern over my head, to show where I am, and to keep  people out of the gutters.    4. At this sultry noontide, I am cupbearer to the parched populace, for  whose benefit an iron goblet is chained to my waist Like a dramseller on  the public square, on a muster day, I cry aloud to all and sundry, in my  plainest accents, and at the very tiptop of my voice. \"Here it is,  gentlemen! Here is the good liquor! Walk up, walk up, gentlemen, walk up,  walk up! Here is the superior stuff! Here is the unadulterated ale of  father Adam! better than Cognac, Hollands, Jamaica, strong beer, or wine  of any price; here it is, by the hogshead or the single glass, and not a  cent to pay. Walk up, gentlemen, walk up and help yourselves!\"    5. It were a pity if all this outcry should draw no customers. Here they  come. A hot day, gentlemen. Quaff and away again, so as to keep yourselves  in a nice, cool sweat. You, my friend, will need another cupful to wash  the dust out of your throat, if it be as thick there as it is on your  cowhide shoes. I see that you have trudged half a score of miles to-day,  and, like a wise man, have passed by the taverns, and stopped at the  running brooks and well curbs. Otherwise, betwixt heat without and fire  within, you would have been burnt to a cinder, or melted down to nothing  at all--in the fashion of a jellyfish.    6. Drink, and make room for that other fellow, who seeks my aid to quench  the fiery fever of last night's potations, which he drained from no cup of  mine. Welcome, most rubicund sir! You and I have been strangers hitherto;  nor, to confess the truth, will my nose be anxious for a closer intimacy,  till the fumes of your breath be a little less potent.    7. Mercy on you, man! The water absolutely hisses down your red-hot  gullet, and is converted quite into steam in the miniature Tophet, which  you mistake for a stomach. Fill again, and tell me, on the word of an  honest toper, did you ever, in cellar, tavern, or any other kind of  dramshop, spend the price of your children's food for a swig half so  delicious? Now, for the first time these ten years, you know the flavor of  cold water. Good-by; and whenever you are thirsty, recollect that I keep a  constant supply at the old stand.    8. Who next? Oh, my little friend, you are just let loose from school, and  come hither to scrub your blooming face, and drown the memory of certain  taps of the ferule, and other schoolboy troubles, in a draught from the  Town Pump. Take it, pure as the current of your young life; take it, and  may your heart and tongue never be scorched with a fiercer thirst than  now.    9. There, my dear child, put down the cup, and yield your place to this  elderly gentleman, who treads so tenderly over the paving stones that I  suspect he is afraid of breaking them. What! he limps by without so much  as thanking me, as if my hospitable offers were meant only for people who  have no wine cellars.    10. Well, well, sir, no harm done, I hope! Go, draw the cork, tip the  decanter; but when your great toe shall set you a-roaring, it will be no  affair of mine. If gentlemen love the pleasant titillation of the gout, it  is all one to the Town Pump. This thirsty dog, with his red tongue lolling  out, does not scorn my hospitality, but stands on his hind legs, and laps  eagerly out of the trough. See how lightly he capers away again! Jowler,  did your worship ever have the gout?    11. Your pardon, good people! I must interrupt my stream of eloquence, and  spout forth a stream of water to replenish the trough for this teamster  and his two yoke of oxen, who have come all the way from Staunton, or  somewhere along that way. No part of my business gives me more pleasure  than the watering of cattle. Look! how rapidly they lower the watermark on  the sides of the trough, till their capacious stomachs are moistened with  a gallon or two apiece, and they can afford time to breathe, with sighs of  calm enjoyment! Now they roll their quiet eyes around the brim of their  monstrous drinking vessel. An ox is your true toper.    12. I hold myself the grand reformer of the age. From my spout, and such  spouts as mine, must flow the stream that shall cleanse our earth of a  vast portion of its crime and anguish, which have gushed from the fiery  fountains of the still. In this mighty enterprise, the cow shall be my  great confederate. Milk and water!    13. Ahem! Dry work this speechifying, especially to all unpracticed  orators. I never conceived till now what toil the temperance lecturers  undergo for my sake."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15043"],[0,"The Works of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke, Vol. 01 (of 12) (#17)"],[1,"of opium than  in that of butter or honey, to be presented with a bolus of squills;  there is hardly any doubt but that he would prefer the butter or honey  to this nauseous morsel, or to any other bitter drug to which he had not  been accustomed; which proves that his palate was naturally like that of  other men in all things, that it is still like the palate of other men  in many things, and only vitiated in some particular points. For in  judging of any new thing, even of a taste similar to that which he has  been formed by habit to like, he finds his palate affected in the  natural manner, and on the common principles. Thus the pleasure of all  the senses, of the sight, and even of the taste, that most ambiguous of  the senses, is the same in all, high and low, learned and unlearned.    Besides the ideas, with their annexed pains and pleasures, which are  presented by the sense; the mind of man possesses a sort of creative  power of its own; either in representing at pleasure the images of  things in the order and manner in which they were received by the  senses, or in combining those images in a new manner, and according to  a different order. This power is called imagination; and to this belongs  whatever is called wit, fancy, invention, and the like. But it must be  observed, that this power of the imagination is incapable of producing  anything absolutely new; it can only vary the disposition of those ideas  which it has received from the senses. Now the imagination is the most  extensive province of pleasure and pain, as it is the region of our  fears and our hopes, and of all our passions that are connected with  them; and whatever is calculated to affect the imagination with these  commanding ideas, by force of any original natural impression, must have  the same power pretty equally over all men. For since the imagination is  only the representation of the senses, it can only be pleased or  displeased with the images, from the same principle on which the sense  is pleased or displeased with the realities; and consequently there must  be just as close an agreement in the imaginations as in the senses of  men. A little attention will convince us that this must of necessity be  the case.    But in the imagination, besides the pain or pleasure arising from the  properties of the natural object, a pleasure is perceived from the  resemblance which the imitation has to the original: the imagination, I  conceive, can have no pleasure but what results from one or other of  these causes. And these causes operate pretty uniformly upon all men,  because they operate by principles in nature, and which are not derived  from any particular habits or advantages. Mr. Locke very justly and  finely observes of wit, that it is chiefly conversant in tracing  resemblances; he remarks, at the same time, that the business of  judgment is rather in finding differences. It may perhaps appear, on  this supposition, that there is no material distinction between the wit  and the judgment, as they both seem to result from different operations  of the same faculty of _comparing_. But in reality, whether they are or  are not dependent on the same power of the mind, they differ so very  materially in many respects, that a perfect union of wit and judgment is  one of the rarest things in the world. When two distinct objects are  unlike to each other, it is only what we expect; things are in their  common way; and therefore they make no impression on the imagination:  but when two distinct objects have a resemblance, we are struck, we  attend to them, and we are pleased. The mind of man has naturally a far  greater alacrity and satisfaction in tracing resemblances than in  searching for differences; because by making resemblances we produce  _new images_; we unite, we create, we enlarge our stock; but in making  distinctions we offer no food at all to the imagination; the task itself  is more severe and irksome, and what pleasure we derive from it is  something of a negative and indirect nature. A piece of news is told me  in the morning; this, merely as a piece of news, as a fact added to my  stock, gives me some pleasure. In the evening I find there was nothing  in it. What do I gain by this, but the dissatisfaction to find that I  had been imposed upon? Hence it is that men are much more naturally  inclined to belief than to incredulity. And it is upon this principle,  that the most ignorant and barbarous nations have frequently excelled in  similitudes, comparisons, metaphors, and allegories, who have been weak  and backward in distinguishing and sorting their ideas. And it is for a  reason of this kind, that Homer and the oriental writers, though very  fond of similitudes, and though they often strike out such as are truly  admirable, seldom take care to have them exact; that is, they are taken  with the general resemblance, they paint it strongly, and they take no  notice of the difference which may be found between the things compared.    Now as the pleasure of resemblance is that which principally flatters  the imagination, all men are nearly equal in this point, as far as their  knowledge of the things represented or compared extends. The principle  of this knowledge is very much accidental, as it depends upon experience  and observation, and not on the strength or weakness of any natural  faculty; and it is from this difference in knowledge, that what we  commonly, though with no great exactness, call a difference in taste  proceeds. A man to whom sculpture is new, sees a barber's block, or some  ordinary piece of statuary; he is immediately struck and pleased,  because he sees something like a human figure; and, entirely taken up  with this likeness, he does not at all attend to its defects. No person,  I believe, at the first time of seeing a piece of imitation ever did.  Some time after, we suppose that this novice lights upon a more  artificial work of the same nature; he now begins to look with contempt  on what he admired at first; not that he admired it even then for its  unlikeness to a man, but for that general though inaccurate resemblance  which it bore to the human figure. What he admired at different times in  these so different figures, is strictly the same; and though his  knowledge is improved, his taste is not altered. Hitherto his mistake  was from a want of knowledge in art, and this arose from his  inexperience; but he may be still deficient from a want of knowledge in  nature. For it is possible that the man in question may stop here, and  that the masterpiece of a great hand may please him no more than the  middling performance of a vulgar artist; and this not for want of better  or higher relish, but because all men do not observe with sufficient  accuracy on the human figure to enable them to judge properly of an  imitation of it. And that the critical taste does not depend upon a  superior principle in men, but upon superior knowledge, may appear from  several instances. The story of the ancient painter and the shoemaker is  very well known. The shoemaker set the painter right with regard to some  mistakes he had made in the shoe of one of his figures, which the  painter, who had not made such accurate observations on shoes, and was  content with a general resemblance, had never observed. But this was no  impeachment to the taste of the painter; it only showed some want of  knowledge in the art of making shoes. Let us imagine, that an anatomist  had come into the painter's working-room. His piece is in general well  done, the figure in question in a good attitude, and the parts well  adjusted to their various movements; yet the anatomist, critical in his  art, may observe the swell of some muscle not quite just in the peculiar  action of the figure. Here the anatomist observes what the painter had  not observed; and he passes by what the shoemaker had remarked. But a  want of the last critical knowledge in anatomy no more reflected on the  natural good taste of the painter, or of any common observer of his  piece, than the want of an exact knowledge in the formation of a shoe. A  fine piece of a decollated head of St. John the Baptist was shown to a  Turkish emperor: he praised many things, but he observed one defect: he  observed that the skin did not shrink from the wounded part of the neck.  The sultan on this occasion, though his observation was very just,  discovered no more natural taste than the painter who executed this  piece, or than a thousand European connoisseurs, who probably never  would have made the same observation. His Turkish majesty had indeed  been well acquainted with that terrible spectacle, which the others  could only have represented in their imagination. On the subject of  their dislike there is a difference between all these people, arising  from the different kinds and degrees of their knowledge; but there is  something in common to the painter, the shoemaker, the anatomist, and  the Turkish emperor, the pleasure arising from a natural object, so far  as each perceives it justly imitated; the satisfaction in seeing an  agreeable figure; the sympathy proceeding from a striking and affecting  incident. So far as taste is natural, it is nearly common to all.    In poetry, and other pieces of imagination, the same parity may be  observed. It is true, that one man is charmed with Don Bellianis, and  reads Virgil coldly; whilst another is transported with the AEneid, and  leaves Don Bellianis to children. These two men seem to have a taste  very different from each other; but in fact they differ very little. In  both these pieces, which inspire such opposite sentiments, a tale  exciting admiration is told; both are full of action, both are  passionate; in both are voyages, battles, triumphs, and continual  changes of fortune. The admirer of Don Bellianis perhaps does not  understand the refined language of the AEneid, who, if it was degraded  into the style of the \"Pilg"]]]
