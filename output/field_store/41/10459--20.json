The town of Samosch was conquered by the Austrian Sokol troops, those  beautiful slender people whom you do not forget when once you have seen  them train in the capital of Galicia. When they were driven away from  the Russian Army the Poles accused the Jews of the town of having been  the accomplices of the Austrians. Twelve Jews were arrested. When they  denied the charge they were sentenced to death. Five of them had been  already hanged, when in the middle of the execution a Russian priest,  carrying an image of the Virgin in his hand, appeared and with his hand  on this image took the oath that the Jews were innocent and that the  accusation was all an outcome of Polish hatred of the Jews. He proved  that the Poles of the town themselves had supported the Austrians and  that even a telephone connection with Lemberg could be found. The seven  Jews were then set free; five had already been hanged.    In the town of Jusefow, the Jews were accused of having poisoned the  wells through which hundreds of Cossacks had lost their lives.  Seventy-eight Jews were killed, many women were ravished, and houses and  shops plundered.    Similar events happened and still happen daily by hundreds. Greater or  smaller pogroms with murder, rape, and plunder have thus taken place in  the districts of Warsaw, Random, Petrikow, and Kelts.    Only a few Russian Governors, such as Korff, in Warsaw; Kelepowski, in  Lublin, and the Governors of Wilna, Petrikow, and Grodno have spoken,  although too late, against the pogroms, but neither the Government nor  the Poles take these warnings seriously.    Eyewitnesses have told me about Jewish soldiers in the different  lazarets who have turned mad, not through the unavoidable horrors of the  war, but because of the pogroms they have witnessed in the towns they  have passed. They mistake those they have seen murdered for their own  relations; they imagine they see their own mothers, sisters, or beloved  ones in that plight. They are always raving about the same thing.    The pursuit of the Jews by the Russian-Polish anti-Semites is the more  invidious under these circumstances, as 300,000 Jewish soldiers, among  them many volunteers, are serving in the Russian Army, and as the  self-sacrifice of the army and the Red Cross hitherto has been  immeasurable. In the great congregations are special hospitals for  Russian soldiers--regardless of their creed--founded by Jews and with  Jewish money. Not a few Jewish soldiers have already won the highest  military distinctions, nay, a few of them have even received them from  Mr. Rennenkampf, the Commander in Chief himself, who used to be a  zealous anti-Semite, as the Russian Court on the whole is passionately  anti-Semitic. The manifesto from the Czar _To my dear Jewish subjects_,  which has been printed in the French newspapers, has never been anything  but a fabrication.    While the usual accusation against the Jews in Russian Poland was that  of sympathizing with the Russians--for which they have no special  reason--Mr. A. Warinski, who in Russia is classed among the black ones,  also called the true Russians--in \"Politiken\" has made the charge  against them that the German attempts of gaining the Poles \"have only  had the effect desired on the Russian and Polish Jews, as these  elements, because of psychological relation with the Prussians, feel  disposed to place themselves at the side of Germany.\" This accusation  and the arguments for it might express the culmination. The Jew shall  and must be Judas. If it cannot be accomplished in one way the opposite  way is tried. Mr. Warinski does not say one word about how many Jews  have gone into the war as volunteers out of pure enthusiasm for Poland.  They have not been able to believe, as I for my part cannot believe,  that the last outcrop of nationalism in Russian Poland is more than a  temporary epidemic.    How could Russian Poles in the long run be unfaithful to the only powers  they have been able to appeal to, the only powers which took an  interest in them? How can they who are fighting for their liberty after  so many years' ill-treatment be willing to seize an opportunity to  ill-treat the only people who (to its misfortune) is in their power, the  only people who have suffered far more and twenty times as long as they  themselves; and the only ones who are too strong to be destroyed through  any ill-treatment? How can the Poles, who were at times ruined as a  State through the treachery of their own men, want to fling out the  accusation of treason against a tribe which has never betrayed itself  and which even in the deepest abasement never betrayed the only Slavic  tribe who in the Middle Ages gave a refuge to its children?    I suppose that the Poles will maintain against this appeal to them that  I, whom the Ruthenians could never bring to make any attack on them, am  now, because of my descent, speaking in favor of a matter, which is very  unpleasant to them. My personal descent has so little influenced my  proceedings and way of thinking that during the whole of my public life  I have been subject to continual attacks in national Jewish periodicals  and newspapers as the man who denied community of descent and supposed  community of faith.    This Spring during my stay in America I was continually attacked in the  American Jewish papers as the callous denier of the Jews. It was  nonsense, as is most of that which appears in print, but it proves at  least that it is not on behalf of my blood but on behalf of my mind that  I speak on this occasion. My sympathy is not with the Jews as Jews, but  as the suppressed and ill-treated.    I am the man who a generation ago wrote: \"We love Poland, not in the  same way that we love Germany or France or England, but as we love  liberty. For what is to love Poland but to love liberty, to feel a deep  sympathy with misfortune and to admire courage and combative enthusiasm?  Poland is the symbol of all that which the supreme among mankind have  loved and for which they have fought.\"    These were my words and hitherto I have adhered to them.    Shall I have to feel ashamed of having written them, now that Poland's  future is being decided?    GEORG BRANDES.    [Illustration: decoration]          Commercial Treaties After the War    By P. Maslov.    [From Russkia Vedomosti, No. 207, Sept. 10, (23,) 1914.]      For reasons beyond my control,[2] I am unable as a member of the Free  Economic Association[3] to participate in the discussion of the methods  of raising money by taxation for the war expenditures. The political  group to which I belong may not give full expression to its views. What  follows is my personal opinion shared by several men.    [Footnote 2: Mr. Maslov, who is a well-known Russian economist, was  arrested shortly after the beginning of the war on suspicion of not  being loyal enough.--Translator.]    [Footnote 3: The Russian Free Economic Association is one of the oldest  scientific bodies of Russia. It considers at its meetings proposed  taxation and various questions of economic policy. It is but natural  that the proposed new taxes should have provoked ardent discussion in  this association. How the war taxes should be levied (direct versus  indirect taxation) and who shall be the taxpayers, were among the chief  topics discussed at its recent meetings.--Translator.]    The attack by Germany is not only a menace to the democracy of France  and Belgium, it not only threatens a political dictatorship by the  Prussian nobility over Europe, but is a danger of far greater magnitude  than these. For the first time Europe is in peril of having her  commercial treaties determined by the sword. Up to this time even the  smaller countries have been saved from such a violent course, and  European capital has been obliged to restrict itself to the oppression  of Asiatic countries. Now for the first time--in case of a German  victory--Europe stands in danger of having her commercial arrangements  forced upon her by an iron hand, and is threatened with being turned  into a German colony. For in the case of a German victory no power in  Europe will be able to withstand Germany. And Germany will deal without  ceremony even with Austria.    On the other hand, in case of German defeat, the foremost capitalistic  country, Great Britain, may not menace Europe for two reasons: First,  Great Britain holds to the policy of free trade; second--and this is the  main point--she cannot support with armed force her policy as against  her allies.    In the meantime the danger indicated above threatens economically  backward Russia; her agricultural population may be ruined, her  industries may be destroyed. An unprecedented situation has arisen for  Russia. All the social classes of the empire are deeply interested in  the repulse of the armies of the Kaiser. The working class is just as  much interested in the existence of Russian industries as are the  employers. The peasants are in no lesser degree interested in the  development of agriculture; the killing of industries and agriculture  like that committed by England in Ireland centuries ago is a gloomy  prospect for all classes of society. If France and Belgium are  threatened with a political oppression then Russia is threatened with an  even more terrible economic subjugation. Such is the situation.    The poorest classes of the people are taking part in this fight with  what they have, with their blood. It is but natural that they should  expect that the material burdens of the war will fall not upon their  shoulders, but upon big business.    It seems to me that in discussing the sinews of war the Free Economic  Association has not considered fully the psychology of the masses. And  yet this psychology has a decisive influence upon the war, and is bound  to be unfavorable to the war, if the masses of the people feel that the  financial burdens of the war "]]]
