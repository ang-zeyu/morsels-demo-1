No wonder that the bull-roarer is sometimes used to bring luck  in a mystic way to hunters. More commonly, however, at the present  day, the bull-roarer serves another type of mystic purpose, its noise,  which is so suggestive of thunder or wind, with a superadded touch  of weirdness and general mystery, fitting it to play a leading part  in rain-making ceremonies. From these not improbably have developed  all sorts of other ceremonies connected with making vegetation and  the crops grow, and with making the boys grow into men, as is done  at the initiation rites. It is not surprising, therefore, to find a  carved human face appearing on the bull-roarer in New Guinea, and again  away in North America, whilst in West Africa it is held to contain  the voice of a very god. In Australia, too, all their higher notions  about a benevolent deity and about religious matters in general seem  to concentrate on this strange symbol, outwardly the frailest of toys,  yet to the spiritual eye of these simple folk a veritable holy of  holies.    And now for the merest sketch of its distribution, the details of which  are to be learnt from Dr. Haddon's valuable paper in _The Study of  Man_. England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales have it. It can be tracked  along central Europe through Switzerland, Germany, and Poland beyond  the Carpathians, whereupon ancient Greece with its Dionysiac mysteries  takes up the tale. In America it is found amongst the Eskimo, is  scattered over the northern part of the continent down to the Mexican  frontier, and then turns up afresh in central Brazil. Again, from the  Malay Peninsula and Sumatra it extends over the great fan of darker  peoples, from Africa, west and south, to New Guinea, Melanesia, and  Australia, together with New Zealand alone of Polynesian islands--a  fact possibly showing it to have belonged to some earlier race of  colonists. Thus in all of the great geographical areas the bull-roarer  is found, and that without reckoning in analogous implements like the  so-called \"buzz,\" which cover further ground, for instance, the  eastern coastlands of Asia. Are we to postulate many independent  origins, or else far-reaching transportations by migratory peoples,  by the American Indians and the negroes, for example? No attempt can  be made here to answer these questions. It is enough to have shown  by the use of a single illustration how the study of the geographical  distribution of inventions raises as many difficulties as it solves.    Our conclusion, then, must be that the anthropologist, whilst  constantly consulting his physical map of the world, must not suppose  that by so doing he will be saved all further trouble. Geographical  facts represent a passive condition, which life, something by its very  nature active, obeys, yet in obeying conquers. We cannot get away from  the fact that we are physically determined. Yet, physical  determinations have been surmounted by human nature in a way to which  the rest of the animal world affords no parallel. Thus man, as the  old saying has it, makes love all the year round. Seasonal changes  of course affect him, yet he is no slave of the seasons. And so it  is with the many other elements involved in the \"geographic control.\"  The \"road,\" for instance--that is to say, any natural avenue of  migration or communication, whether by land over bridges and through  passes, or by sea between harbours and with trade-winds to swell the  sails--takes a hand in the game of life, and one that holds many trumps;  but so again does the non-geographical fact that your travelling-machine  may be your pair of legs, or a horse, or a boat, or a railway, or an  airship. Let us be moderate in all things, then, even in our references  to the force of circumstances. Circumstances can unmake; but of  themselves they never yet made man, nor any other form of life.          CHAPTER V  LANGUAGE      The differentia of man--the quality that marks him off from the other  animal kinds--is undoubtedly the power of articulate speech. Thereby  his mind itself becomes articulate. If language is ultimately a  creation of the intellect, yet hardly less fundamentally is the  intellect a creation of language. As flesh depends on bone, so does  the living tissue of our spiritual life depend on its supporting  framework of steadfast verbal forms. The genius, the heaven-born  benefactor of humanity, is essentially he who wrestles with \"thoughts  too deep for words,\" until at last he assimilates them to the scheme  of meanings embodied in his mother-tongue, and thus raises them  definitely above the threshold of the common consciousness, which is  likewise the threshold of the common culture.    There is good reason, then, for prefixing a short chapter on language  to an account of those factors in the life of man that together stand  on the whole for the principle of freedom--of rational self-direction.  Heredity and environment do not, indeed, lie utterly beyond the range  of our control. As they are viewed from the standpoint of human history  as a whole, they show each in its own fashion a certain capacity to  meet the needs and purposes of the life-force halfway. Regarded  abstractly, however, they may conveniently be treated as purely  passive and limiting conditions. Here we are with a constitution not  of our choosing, and in a world not of our choosing. Given this  inheritance, and this environment, how are we, by taking thought and  taking risks, to achieve the best-under-the-circumstances? Such is  the vital problem as it presents itself to any particular generation  of men.    The environment is as it were the enemy. We are out to conquer and  enslave it. Our inheritance, on the other hand, is the impelling force  we obey in setting forth to fight; it tingles in our blood, and nerves  the muscles of our arm. This force of heredity, however, abstractly  considered, is blind. Yet, corporately and individually, we fight with  eyes that see. This supervening faculty, then, of utilizing the light  of experience represents a third element in the situation; and, from  the standpoint of man's desire to know himself, the supreme element.  The environment, inasmuch as under this conception are included all  other forms of life except man, can muster on its side a certain amount  of intelligence of a low order. But man's prerogative is to dominate  his world by the aid of intelligence of a high order. When he defied  the ice-age by the use of fire, when he outfaced and outlived the  mammoth and the cave bear, he was already the rational animal, _homo  sapiens_. In his way he thought, even in those far-off days. And  therefore we may assume, until direct evidence is forthcoming to the  contrary, that he likewise had language of an articulate kind. He tried  to make a speech, we may almost say, as soon as he had learned to stand  up on his hind legs.    Unfortunately, we entirely lack the means of carrying back the history  of human speech to its first beginnings. In the latter half of the  last century, whilst the ferment of Darwinism was freshly seething,  all sorts of speculations were rife concerning the origin of language.  One school sought the source of the earliest words in imitative sounds  of the type of bow-wow; another in interjectional expressions of the  type of tut-tut. Or, again, as was natural in Europe, where, with the  exception of Basque in a corner of the west, and of certain Asiatic  languages, Turkish, Hungarian and Finnish, on the eastern border, all  spoken tongues present certain obvious affinities, the comparative  philologist undertook to construct sundry great families of speech;  and it was hoped that sooner or later, by working back to some  linguistic parting of the ways, the central problem would be solved  of the dispersal of the world's races.    These painted bubbles have burst. The further examination of the forms  of speech current amongst peoples of rude culture has not revealed  a conspicuous wealth either of imitative or of interjectional sounds.  On the other hand, the comparative study of the European, or, as they  must be termed in virtue of the branch stretching through Persia into  India, the Indo-European stock of languages, carries us back three  or four thousand years at most--a mere nothing in terms of  anthropological time. Moreover, a more extended search through the  world, which in many of its less cultured parts furnishes no literary  remains that may serve to illustrate linguistic evolution, shows  endless diversity of tongues in place of the hoped-for system of a  few families; so that half a hundred apparently independent types must  be distinguished in North America alone. For the rest, it has become  increasingly clear that race and language need not go together at all.  What philologist, for instance, could ever discover, if he had no  history to help him, but must rely wholly on the examination of modern  French, that the bulk of the population of France is connected by way  of blood with ancient Gauls who spoke Celtic, until the Roman conquest  caused them to adopt a vulgar form of Latin in its place. The Celtic  tongue, in its turn, had, doubtless not so very long before, ousted  some earlier type of language, perhaps one allied to the still  surviving Basque; though it is not in the least necessary, therefore,  to suppose that the Celtic-speaking invaders wiped out the previous  inhabitants of the land to a corresponding extent. Races, in short,  mix readily; languages, except in very special circumstances, hardly  at all.    Disappointed in its hope of presiding over the reconstruction of the  distant past of man, the study of language has in recent years tended  somewhat to renounce the historical--that is to say,  anthropological--method altogether. The alternative is a purely  formal treatment of the subject.

Ambition for  his family was a great offence to his subjects, and at the same time a  nobleman, the Duke de Praslin, who had murdered his wife, committed  suicide in prison to avoid public execution; and the republicans  declared, whether justly or unjustly, that this had been allowed rather  than let a noble die a felon's death.      3. The Revolution of 1848.--In spite of the increased prosperity of  the country, there was general disaffection. There were four  parties--the Orleanists, who held by Louis Philippe and his minister  Guizot, and whose badge was the tricolour; the Legitimists, who retained  their loyalty to the exiled Henry, and whose symbol was the white  Bourbon flag; the Buonapartists; and the Republicans, whose badge was  the red cap and flag. A demand for a franchise that should include the  mass of the people was rejected, and the general displeasure poured  itself out in speeches at political banquets. An attempt to stop one of  these led to an uproar. The National Guard refused to fire on the  people, and their fury rose unchecked; so that the king, thinking  resistance vain, signed an abdication, and fled to England in February,  1848. A provisional Government was formed, and a new constitution was to  be arranged; but the Paris mob, who found their condition unchanged, and  really wanted equality of wealth, not of rights, made disturbances again  and again, and barricaded the streets, till they were finally put down  by General Cavaignac, while the rest of France was entirely dependent on  the will of the capital. After some months, a republic was determined  on, which was to have a president at its head, chosen every five years  by universal suffrage. Louis Napoleon Buonaparte, nephew to the great  Napoleon, was the first president thus chosen; and, after some  struggles, he not only mastered Paris, but, by the help of the army,  which was mostly Buonapartist, he dismissed the chamber of deputies, and  imprisoned or exiled all the opponents whom the troops had not put to  death, on the plea of an expected rising of the mob. This was called a  _coup d'etat_, and Louis Napoleon was then declared president for ten  years.      4. The Second Empire.--In December, 1852, the president took the title  of Emperor, calling himself Napoleon III., as successor to the young son  of the great Napoleon. He kept up a splendid and expensive court, made  Paris more than ever the toy-shop of the world, and did much to improve  it by the widening of streets and removal of old buildings. Treaties  were made which much improved trade, and the country advanced in  prosperity. The reins of government were, however, tightly held, and  nothing was so much avoided as the letting men think or act for  themselves, while their eyes were to be dazzled with splendour and  victory. In 1853, when Russia was attacking Turkey, the Emperor united  with England in opposition, and the two armies together besieged  Sebastopol, and fought the battles of Alma and Inkermann, taking the  city after nearly a year's siege; and then making what is known as the  Treaty of Paris, which guaranteed the safety of Turkey so long as the  subject Christian nations were not misused. In 1859 Napoleon III. joined  in an attack on the Austrian power in Italy, and together with Victor  Emanuel, King of Sardinia, and the Italians, gained two great victories  at Magenta and Solferino; but made peace as soon as it was convenient to  him, without regard to his promises to the King of Sardinia, who was  obliged to purchase his consent to becoming King of United Italy by  yielding up to France his old inheritance of Savoy and Nice. Meantime  discontent began to spring up at home, and the Red Republican spirit was  working on. The huge fortunes made by the successful only added to the  sense of contrast; secret societies were at work, and the Emperor, after  twenty years of success, felt his popularity waning.      5. The Franco-German War.--In 1870 the Spaniards, who had deposed  their queen, Isabel II., made choice of a relation of the King of  Prussia as their king. There had long been bitter jealousy between  France and Prussia, and, though the prince refused the offer of Spain,  the French showed such an overbearing spirit that a war broke out. The  real desire of France was to obtain the much-coveted frontier of the  Rhine, and the Emperor heated their armies with boastful proclamations  which were but the prelude to direful defeats, at Weissenburg, Woerth,  and Forbach. At Sedan, the Emperor was forced to surrender himself as a  prisoner, and the tidings no sooner arrived at Paris than the whole of  the people turned their wrath on him and his family. His wife, the  Empress Eugenie, had to flee, a republic was declared, and the city  prepared to stand a siege. The Germans advanced, and put down all  resistance in other parts of France. Great part of the army had been  made prisoners, and, though there was much bravado, there was little  steadiness or courage left among those who now took up arms. Paris,  which was blockaded, after suffering much from famine, surrendered in  February, 1871; and peace was purchased in a treaty by which great part  of Elsass and Lorraine, and the city of Metz, were given back to  Germany.
