Il s'est sacrifie pour l'humanite: pour elle il a donne son  corps et son ame, pour elle il a subi les privations, les affronts, les  injures, la torture et le martyre. Il a scelle de son sang le pacte de la  fraternite universelle, et comme Jesus il a paye de sa vie l'annonce du  regne de la concorde, de l'equite et de l'amour du prochain.\" \"Un fait  etrange, unique dans les annales de l'humanite,\" is a further testimony  from the pen of that same scholar commenting on the circumstances  attending the Bab's martyrdom. \"A veritable miracle,\" is the pronouncement  made by a noted French Orientalist. \"A true God-man,\" is the verdict of a  famous British traveler and writer. \"The finest product of his country,\"  is the tribute paid Him by a noted French publicist. \"That Jesus of the  age ... a prophet, and more than a prophet,\" is the judgment passed by a  distinguished English divine. \"The most important religious movement since  the foundation of Christianity,\" is the possibility that was envisaged for  the Faith the Bab had established by that far-famed Oxford scholar, the  late Master of Balliol.    \"Many persons from all parts of the world,\" is 'Abdu'l-Baha's written  assertion, \"set out for Persia and began to investigate wholeheartedly the  matter.\" The Czar of Russia, a contemporary chronicler has written, had  even, shortly before the Bab's martyrdom, instructed the Russian Consul in  Tabriz to fully inquire into, and report the circumstances of so startling  a Movement, a commission that could not be carried out in view of the  Bab's execution. In countries as remote as those of Western Europe an  interest no less profound was kindled, and spread with great rapidity to  literary, artistic, diplomatic and intellectual circles. \"All Europe,\"  attests the above-mentioned French publicist, \"was stirred to pity and  indignation... Among the litterateurs of my generation, in the Paris of  1890, the martyrdom of the Bab was still as fresh a topic as had been the  first news of His death. We wrote poems about Him. Sarah Bernhardt  entreated Catulle Mendes for a play on the theme of this historic  tragedy.\" A Russian poetess, member of the Philosophic, Oriental and  Bibliological Societies of St. Petersburg, published in 1903 a drama  entitled \"The Bab,\" which a year later was played in one of the principal  theatres of that city, was subsequently given publicity in London, was  translated into French in Paris, and into German by the poet Fiedler, was  presented again, soon after the Russian Revolution, in the Folk Theatre in  Leningrad, and succeeded in arousing the genuine sympathy and interest of  the renowned Tolstoy, whose eulogy of the poem was later published in the  Russian press.    It would indeed be no exaggeration to say that nowhere in the whole  compass of the world's religious literature, except in the Gospels, do we  find any record relating to the death of any of the religion-founders of  the past comparable to the martyrdom suffered by the Prophet of _Sh_iraz.  So strange, so inexplicable a phenomenon, attested by eye-witnesses,  corroborated by men of recognized standing, and acknowledged by government  as well as unofficial historians among the people who had sworn undying  hostility to the Babi Faith, may be truly regarded as the most marvelous  manifestation of the unique potentialities with which a Dispensation  promised by all the Dispensations of the past had been endowed. The  passion of Jesus Christ, and indeed His whole public ministry, alone offer  a parallel to the Mission and death of the Bab, a parallel which no  student of comparative religion can fail to perceive or ignore. In the  youthfulness and meekness of the Inaugurator of the Babi Dispensation; in  the extreme brevity and turbulence of His public ministry; in the dramatic  swiftness with which that ministry moved towards its climax; in the  apostolic order which He instituted, and the primacy which He conferred on  one of its members; in the boldness of His challenge to the time-honored  conventions, rites and laws which had been woven into the fabric of the  religion He Himself had been born into; in the role which an officially  recognized and firmly entrenched religious hierarchy played as chief  instigator of the outrages which He was made to suffer; in the indignities  heaped upon Him; in the suddenness of His arrest; in the interrogation to  which He was subjected; in the derision poured, and the scourging  inflicted, upon Him; in the public affront He sustained; and, finally, in  His ignominious suspension before the gaze of a hostile multitude--in all  these we cannot fail to discern a remarkable similarity to the  distinguishing features of the career of Jesus Christ.    It should be remembered, however, that apart from the miracle associated  with the Bab's execution, He, unlike the Founder of the Christian  religion, is not only to be regarded as the independent Author of a  divinely revealed Dispensation, but must also be recognized as the Herald  of a new Era and the Inaugurator of a great universal prophetic cycle. Nor  should the important fact be overlooked that, whereas the chief  adversaries of Jesus Christ, in His lifetime, were the Jewish rabbis and  their associates, the forces arrayed against the Bab represented the  combined civil and ecclesiastical powers of Persia, which, from the moment  of His declaration to the hour of His death, persisted, unitedly and by  every means at their disposal, in conspiring against the upholders and in  vilifying the tenets of His Revelation.    The Bab, acclaimed by Baha'u'llah as the \"Essence of Essences,\" the \"Sea  of Seas,\" the \"Point round Whom the realities of the Prophets and  Messengers revolve,\" \"from Whom God hath caused to proceed the knowledge  of all that was and shall be,\" Whose \"rank excelleth that of all the  Prophets,\" and Whose \"Revelation transcendeth the comprehension and  understanding of all their chosen ones,\" had delivered His Message and  discharged His mission. He Who was, in the words of 'Abdu'l-Baha, the  \"Morn of Truth\" and \"Harbinger of the Most Great Light,\" Whose advent at  once signalized the termination of the \"Prophetic Cycle\" and the inception  of the \"Cycle of Fulfillment,\" had simultaneously through His Revelation  banished the shades of night that had descended upon His country, and  proclaimed the impending rise of that Incomparable Orb Whose radiance was  to envelop the whole of mankind. He, as affirmed by Himself, \"the Primal  Point from which have been generated all created things,\" \"one of the  sustaining pillars of the Primal Word of God,\" the \"Mystic Fane,\" the  \"Great Announcement,\" the \"Flame of that supernal Light that glowed upon  Sinai,\" the \"Remembrance of God\" concerning Whom \"a separate Covenant hath  been established with each and every Prophet\" had, through His advent, at  once fulfilled the promise of all ages and ushered in the consummation of  all Revelations. He the \"Qa'im\" (He Who ariseth) promised to the  _Sh_i'ahs, the \"Mihdi\" (One Who is guided) awaited by the Sunnis, the  \"Return of John the Baptist\" expected by the Christians, the  \"U_sh_idar-Mah\" referred to in the Zoroastrian scriptures, the \"Return of  Elijah\" anticipated by the Jews, Whose Revelation was to show forth \"the  signs and tokens of all the Prophets\", Who was to \"manifest the perfection  of Moses, the radiance of Jesus and the patience of Job\" had appeared,  proclaimed His Cause, been mercilessly persecuted and died gloriously. The  \"Second Woe,\" spoken of in the Apocalypse of St. John the Divine, had, at  long last, appeared, and the first of the two \"Messengers,\" Whose  appearance had been prophesied in the Qur'an, had been sent down. The  first \"Trumpet-Blast\", destined to smite the earth with extermination,  announced in the latter Book, had finally been sounded. \"The Inevitable,\"  \"The Catastrophe,\" \"The Resurrection,\" \"The Earthquake of the Last Hour,\"  foretold by that same Book, had all come to pass. The \"clear tokens\" had  been \"sent down,\" and the \"Spirit\" had \"breathed,\" and the \"souls\" had  \"waked up,\" and the \"heaven\" had been \"cleft,\" and the \"angels\" had  \"ranged in order,\" and the \"stars\" had been \"blotted out,\" and the \"earth\"  had \"cast forth her burden,\" and \"Paradise\" had been \"brought near,\" and  \"hell\" had been \"made to blaze,\" and the \"Book\" had been \"set,\" and the  \"Bridge\" had been \"laid out,\" and the \"Balance\" had been \"set up,\" and the  \"mountains scattered in dust.\" The \"cleansing of the Sanctuary,\"  prophesied by Daniel and confirmed by Jesus Christ in His reference to  \"the abomination of desolation,\" had been accomplished. The \"day whose  length shall be a thousand years,\" foretold by the Apostle of God in His  Book, had terminated. The \"forty and two months,\" during which the \"Holy  City,\" as predicted by St. John the Divine, would be trodden under foot,  had elapsed. The \"time of the end\" had been ushered in, and the first of  the \"two Witnesses\" into Whom, \"after three days and a half the Spirit of  Life from God\" would enter, had arisen and had \"ascended up to heaven in a  cloud.\" The \"remaining twenty and five letters to be made manifest,\"  according to Islamic tradition, out of the \"twenty and seven letters\" of  which Knowledge has been declared to consist, had been revealed. The \"Man  Child,\" mentioned in the Book of Revelation, destined to \"rule all nations  with a rod of iron,\" had released, through His coming, the creative  energies which, reinforced by the effusions of a swiftly succeeding and  infinitely mightier Revelation, were to instill into the entire human"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19279"],[0,"Memorials of the Faithful (#17)"],[1,"recompense to come. He could not bear  for the Light of the World to have disappeared, and what he sought was the  paradise of reunion with Him, and what his eyes hungered to behold was the  glory of the Abha Realm. At last his prayer was answered and he rose  upward into the world of God, to the gathering-place of the splendors of  the Lord of Lords.    Upon him be God's benediction and praise, and may God bring him into the  abode of peace, as He has written in His book: \"For them is an abode of  peace with their Lord.\"(62) \"And to those who serve Him, is God full of  kindness.\"(63)            SHAYKH 'ALI-AKBAR-I-MAZGANI      This chief of free souls, of wanderers for the love of God, was only an  infant when, in Mazgan, he was suckled at the breast of grace. He was a  child of the eminent scholar, _Sh_ay_kh_-i-Mazgani; his noble father was  one of the leading citizens of Qamsar, near Ka_sh_an, and for piety,  holiness, and the fear of God he had no peer. This father embodied all the  qualities that are worthy of praise; moreover his ways were pleasing, his  disposition good, he was an excellent companion, and for all these things  he was well known. When he threw off restraint and openly declared himself  a believer, the faithless, whether friend or stranger, turned their backs  on him and began to plot his death. But he continued to further the Cause,  to alert the people's hearts, and to welcome the newcomers as generously  as ever. Thus in Ka_sh_an the fame of his strong faith reached as high as  the Milky Way. Then the pitiless aggressors rose up, plundered his  possessions and killed him.    'Ali-Akbar, the son of him who had laid down his life in the pathway of  God, could live in that place no longer. Had he remained, he too, like his  father, would have been put to the sword. He passed some time in 'Iraq,  and received the honor of being in the presence of Baha'u'llah. Then he  went back to Persia, but again he longed to look upon Baha'u'llah, and  with his wife he set out over the deserts and mountains, sometimes riding,  sometimes on foot, measuring off the miles, passing from one shore to the  other, reaching the Holy Place at last and in the shade of the Divine  Lote-Tree finding safety and peace.    When the beauty of the Desired One had vanished from this world,  'Ali-Akbar remained loyal to the Covenant and prospered under the grace of  God. By disposition and because of the intense love in his heart, he  yearned to write poetry, to fashion odes and _gh_azals, but he lacked both  meter and rhyme:    I planned a poem, but my Beloved told me,  \"Plan only this, that thine eyes should behold Me.\"    With rapturous longing, his heart desired the realms of his compassionate  Lord; consumed by burning love, he left this world at last, and pitched  his tent in the world above. May God send down upon his grave, from the  Kingdom of His forgiveness, a heavy rain(64) of blessings, bestow a great  victory upon him, and grant him mercies, pressed down and running over, in  the retreats of Heaven.            MIRZA MUHAMMAD, THE SERVANT AT THE TRAVELERS' HOSPICE      This youth of God was from Isfahan, and from an early age was known to its  leading divines for his excellent mind. He was of gentle birth, his family  was known and respected, and he was an accomplished scholar. He had  profited from philosophy and history alike, from sciences and arts, but he  thirsted after the secret of reality, and longed for knowledge of God. His  feverish thirst was not allayed by the arts and sciences, however limpid  those waters. He kept on seeking, seeking, carrying on debates in  gatherings of learned men until at last he discovered the meaning of his  longing dream, and the enigma, the inviolable secret, lay open before him.  Suddenly he caught the scent of fresh flowers from the gardens of the  splendor of God, and his heart was ashine with a ray from the Sun of  Truth. Whereas before, he was like a fish taken from the water, now he had  come to the wellspring of eternal life; before, he was a questing moth;  now he had found the candle flame. A true seeker after truth, he was  instantly revived by the supreme Glad Tidings; his heart's eye was  brightened by the new dawn of guidance. So blinding was the fire of Divine  love that he turned his face away from his life, its peace, its blessings,  and set out for the Most Great Prison.    In Isfahan he had enjoyed every comfort, and the world was good to him.  Now his yearning for Baha'u'llah freed him from all other bonds. He passed  over the long miles, suffered intense hardships, exchanged a palace for a  prison, and in the Akka fortress assisted the believers and attended upon  and served Baha'u'llah. He who had been waited upon, now waited on others;  he who had been the master was now the servant, he who had once been a  leader was now a captive. He had no rest, no leisure, day or night. To the  travelers he was a trusted refuge; to the settlers, a companion without  peer. He served beyond his strength, for he was filled with love of the  friends. The travelers were devoted to him, and the settlers grateful. And  because he was continuously busy, he kept silent at all times.    Then the Supreme Affliction came upon us and the absence of Baha'u'llah  was not to be endured. Mirza Muhammad could not stay quiet, day or night.  He wasted away, like a candle burning down; from the fiery anguish, his  liver and heart were inflamed, and his body could bear no more. He wept  and supplicated day and night, yearning to soar away to that undiscovered  country. \"Lord, free me, free me from this absence,\" he would cry, \"let me  drink of reunion's cup, find me a lodging in the shelter of Thy mercy,  Lord of Lords!\"    At last he quit this dust heap, the earth, and took his flight to the  world that has no end. May it do him good, that cup brimming with the  grace of God, may he eat with healthy relish of that food which gives life  to heart and soul. May God lead him to that happy journey's end and grant  him an abundant share in the gifts which shall then be bestowed.(65)            MIRZA MUHAMMAD-I-VAKIL      One of the captives who were sent on from Ba_gh_dad to Mosul was Mirza  Muhammad-i-Vakil. This righteous soul was among those who became believers  in Ba_gh_dad. It was there he drank from the cup of resignation to the  will of God and sought his rest in the shade of the celestial Tree. He was  a man high-minded and worthy of trust. He was also an extremely capable  and energetic administrator of important affairs, famous in 'Iraq for his  wise counsel. After he became a believer, he was distinguished by the  title of Vakil--deputy. It happened in this way:    There was a notable in Ba_gh_dad by the name of Haji Mirza Hadi, the  jeweler. He had a distinguished son, Aqa Mirza Musa, who had received from  Baha'u'llah the title \"Letter of Eternity.\" This son had become a staunch  believer. As for his father, the Haji, he was a princely individual known  for his lavish open-handedness not only in Persia and 'Iraq but as far  away as India. To begin with he had been a Persian vazir; but when he saw  how the late Fath-'Ali _Sh_ah eyed worldly riches, particularly the  worldly riches of Persian vazirs, and how he snatched whatever they had  accumulated, and how, not content with confiscating their costly vanities  and lumber, he punished and tortured them right and left, calling it a  legal penalty--the Haji dreaded that he too might be catapulted into the  abyss. He abandoned his position as vazir, and his mansion, and fled to  Ba_gh_dad. Fath-'Ali _Sh_ah demanded that the Governor of Ba_gh_dad, Davud  Pa_sh_a, send him back, but the Pa_sh_a was a man of courage and the Haji  was widely known for his able mind. Accordingly, the Pa_sh_a respected and  helped him and the Haji set up in business as a jeweler. He lived with  pomp and splendor, like a great prince. He was one of the most remarkable  men of his time, for within his palace he carried on a life of  gratification and opulence, but he left his pomp, style and retinue  behind, occupied himself with his business affairs and realized great  profits.    The door of his house was always open. Turks and Persians, neighbors,  strangers from far places, all were his honored guests. Most of Persia's  great, when they came on pilgrimage to the Holy Shrines, would stop at his  house, where they would find a banquet laid out, and every luxury ready to  hand. The Haji was, indeed, more distinguished than Persia's Grand Vazir;  he outshone all the vazirs for magnificence, and as the days passed by he  dispensed ever more largesse to all who came and went. He was the pride of  the Persians throughout 'Iraq, the glory of his fellow nationals. Even on  the Turkish vazirs and ministers and the grandees of Ba_gh_dad he bestowed  gifts and favors; and for intelligence and perceptivity he had no equal.    Because of the Haji's advancing years, toward the end of his days his  business affairs declined. Still, he made no change in his way of life.  Exactly as before, he continued to live with elegance. The prominent would  borrow heavily from him, and never pay him back. One of them, the mother  of Aqa _Kh_an Mahallati, borrowed 100,000 tumans(66) from him and did not  repay one penny, for she died soon after. The Il-_Kh_an, 'Ali-Quli _Kh_an,  was another debtor; another was Sayfu'd-Dawlih, a son of Fath-'Ali _Sh_ah;  another, Valiyyih, a daughter of Fath-'Ali _Sh_ah; these are only a few  examples out of many, from among the Turkish amirs and the great of Persia  and 'Iraq. All these debts remained unpaid and irrecoverable.  Nevertheless, that eminent and princely man continued to live exactly as  before.    Toward the close of his life he conceived a remarkable love for  Baha'u'llah, and most humbly, would enter His presence. I remember him  saying one day, to the Blessed Beauty, that in the year 1250 and something  over, Mirza Mawkab "]]]
