But as these inducements could naturally appeal only to  comparatively few, more stringent measures were resorted to. Hitherto  the Jews had been excused from military service, paying an annual sum of  money for the privilege. On September 7, 1827, an ukase was issued  requiring them not only to pay the same amount as theretofore, but also  to serve in the army; and while Christians had to furnish only seven  recruits per thousand, and only at certain intervals, the Jews had to  contribute ten recruits for each thousand, and that at every  conscription. The only exception was made in the case of the Karaites,  who, according to Nicholas's decision, had emigrated from Palestine  before the Christian era, and could not therefore have participated in  the crucifixion of Jesus. Jews found outside of their native towns  without passports, and those in arrears with their taxes, frequently  even those who, having lagged behind in their payment to the Government,  eventually discharged their obligations, were to be seized and sentenced  to serve in the army, and this meant a lifetime, or at least twenty-five  years, of the most abject slavery imaginable. This grievous measure  caused the utmost misery. No Jewish youth leaving home could be sure of  returning and seeing his dear ones again. The scum of the Jewish  population (poimshchiki, or \"catchers\") made it their profession to  ensnare helpless young men or poor itinerant students suspected of the  Haskalah heresy, destroy their passports, and deliver them up as  poimaniki (recruits), to spare the rich who paid for the substitutes. To  form an idea of the time we need but read some of the numerous  folk-songs of that day. Here is one of many:      Quietly I walk in the street,    When behind me I hear the rush of feet.    Woes have come and sought me,    Alas, had I bethought me.      \"Your passport,\" they ask. Alas, it is lost!    \"Then serve the White Czar!\" that is the cost.    Woe has come and sought me,    Alas, had I bethought me.      There are many rooms, they take me to one,    And strip from my body the poor homespun.    Woe has come and sought me,    Alas, had I bethought me.      They take me to another room,    The uniform,--that is my doom.    Woe has come and sought me,    Alas, had I bethought me.      Rather than wear the cap of the czar,    To study the Torah were better by far.    Woe has come and sought me,    Alas, had I bethought me.      Rather than eat of the czar's black bread,    I'd study the Scriptures head by head.    Woes have come and sought me,    Alas, had I bethought me.    Yet this was not all. Knowing that it is easier to convert the children  than their elders, the Government of Nicholas I, out-Heroding Herod,  inaugurated a system so cruel as to fill with terror and pity the heart  of the most ferocious barbarian. Infants were torn from their mothers,  boys of the age of twelve, sometimes of ten and eight, were herded like  cattle, sent to distant parts of Russia, and there distributed as  chattels among the officers of the army. Many of these Cantonists, as  they were called, either died on the way, or were killed off when they  resisted conversion. Those who survived sometimes returned to Judaism,  and formed the nucleus of Jewish settlements in the interior of Russia.  These \"soldiers of Nicholas\" (Nikolayevskiye soldati), with their  uncouth demeanor and devoted, though ignorant, adherence to the faith of  their fathers, furnished much material for the folk-songs of the time  and the novelists of the somewhat happier reigns of Nicholas's  successors.[36]    One of these Cantonists, the first to give a description of the life of  his fellow-sufferers, was Wolf Nachlass, or Alexander Alekseyev. For  many years he remained faithful to the religion of his forefathers,  though he had been pressed into the service at the age of ten. About  1845 he changed his views, became an ardent Greek Catholic, and  converted five hundred Cantonists, to the great delight of Nicholas I,  who thanked him in person for his zeal. He lost his leg, and during the  long illness that followed Nachlass settled in Novgorod, and wrote  several works on Jewish customs and on missionary topics.    Less horrifying, but equally aiming at disintegration, was Nicholas's  scheme of colonization. What better means was there for \"diminishing the  number of Jews\" than to scatter them over the wilderness of Russia and  leave them to shift for themselves? This, of course, was necessarily a  slow process and one involving some expense, but it was fraught with  great importance not only for the Russian Church, but for Russian trade  and agriculture as well.    \"Back to the soil!\" Was not this the cry of the romantic Maskilim in  Germany, in Galicia, and particularly in Russia? And have not country  life and field labor been depicted by them in the most glowing colors?  Here was an opportunity to save the honor of the Jewish name and also  ameliorate the material condition of the Russian Jews. The permission  given to them by Alexander I to establish themselves as farmers in the  frigid yet free Siberian steppes was greeted with enthusiasm by all.  Nicholas's ukase was hailed with joy. Elias Mitauer and Meyer  Mendelssohn, at the head of seventy families from Courland, were the  first to migrate to the new region (1836), and they were followed by  hundreds more. Indeed, the exodus assumed such proportions that the  Christians in the parts of the country abandoned by the colonists  complained of the decline in business and the depreciation of property.  The movement was heartily approved by the rabbis; the populace, its  imagination stimulated, began to dream dreams and see visions of  brighter days, and all gave vent to their hopefulness in songs of  gladness and gratitude, in strains like these:[37]      Who lives so free      As the farmer on his land?    His farm his companion is,      His never-failing friend.      His sleep to him is sweet      After a hearty meal;    Neither grief nor worry      The farmer-man doth feel.      He rises very early      To start betimes his toil,    Healthy and very happy      On his ever-smiling soil.      O blessings on our czar,      Czar Nikolai, then be,    Who granted us this gladness,      And bade the Jews be free.    Alas, this joy was of short duration! Very soon Nicholas became  suspicious of his Siberian colonization scheme, that it was in reality a  philanthropic measure, and in place of saving the Jew's soul it only  promoted his physical well-being. This suspicion grew into a conviction  when he learned that the Jewish community at Tomsk, still faithful to  the heritage of Israel, applied for permission to appoint a spiritual  leader. The autocrat, therefore, signed an ukase checking settlement in  the hitherto free land, depriving honest men of the privilege enjoyed by  the worst of criminals, and enrolling the children of those already  there among the military Cantonists (January 5, 1837).    Then began real misery. Believing at first that the czar's intentions  were sincere, many Jews had sold their hut and land and left for  Siberia. No sooner were they there than they were sent, on foot, to  Kherson. The decree of the \"little father\" was executed in--no other  phrase can describe it so well--Russian fashion. The innocent Jews who  had come to Siberia by invitation were seized, treated as vagabonds, and  deported to their destination. Want and suffering produced contagious  diseases, and many became a burden to the Jews of Kremenchug and such  Christians as could not witness unmoved the infernal comedy played by  the defender of the Greek Catholic Church. Help could be rendered only  secretly, and those who dared complain were severely punished.    At the same time that this was taking place in the wilderness of  Siberia, a phenomenon of rare occurrence was to be witnessed in the very  heart of the Jewish Pale, in Lithuania. Aroused by the wretched  condition of his coreligionists, Solomon Posner (1780-1848) determined  to erect cloth factories exclusively for Jews. He sent to Germany for  experts to teach them the trade. These Jewish workingmen proved so  industrious and intelligent that before the end of three years they  surpassed their teachers in mechanical skill. But this attempt of Posner  was only prefatory to the greater and more arduous task he set himself.  It was nothing less than the establishment of a colony in which some of  the most Utopian theories would be applied to actual life. Ten years  after Robert Owen founded his communistic settlement at New Harmony,  Indiana, several hundred robust Russian Jews settled on some of the  thousands of acres in Lithuania that were lying fallow for want of  tillers. With these farmers Posner hoped to realize his Utopia. He  provided every family with sufficient land, the necessary agricultural  implements, as well as with horses, cows, etc., free of charge, for a  term of twenty-five years. In return, the members of the community  pledged themselves to use simple homespun for their apparel, black on  holidays, gray on week-days, not to indulge in the luxuries of city  life, and to avoid trading of any sort. As time passed, Posner opened  coeducational technical schools for the children and batte midrashim for  adults, and soon the homesteads presented the appearance of progressive  and flourishing farms. Posner's successful effort attracted the  admiration of Prince Pashkevich, and was both a living protest against  the accusation of Nicholas that Jews were unfit to be farmers and an  eloquent plea for the unfortunate victims of a capricious tyrant in  Siberia and Kherson.[38]    In his efforts to curb the stiff-necked Jews by all manner of fiendish  persecution, Nicholas did not neglect to try the efficacy of some of the  plans advocated by Lewis Way. Undismayed by the failure of the Committee  of Guardians for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15932"],[0,"The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians (#17)"],[1," they repented of their  murmurings, and the next morning they went out with bows and arrows to  fight the enemies of the Sun-god. As a reward for this Ra forgave those  men their former blasphemies, but persisted in his intention of retiring  from the earth. He ascended into the heights of heaven, being still on  the back of the Cow-goddess Nut, and he created there Sekhet-hetep and  Sekhet-Aaru as abodes for the blessed, and the flowers that blossomed  therein he turned into stars. He also created the millions of beings who  lived there in order that they might praise him. The height to which Ra  had ascended was now so great that the legs of the Cow-goddess on which  he was enthroned trembled, and to give her strength he ordained that Nut  should be held up in her position by the godhead and upraised arms of  the god Shu. This is why we see pictures of the body of Nut being  supported by Shu. The legs of the Cow-goddess were supported by the  various gods, and thus the seat of the throne of Ra became stable. When  this was done Ra caused the Earth-god Keb to be summoned to his  presence, and when he came he spake to him about the venomous reptiles  that lived in the earth and were hostile to him. Then turning to Thoth,  he bade him to prepare a series of spells and words of power, which  would enable those who knew them to overcome snakes and serpents and  deadly reptiles of all kinds. Thoth did so, and the spells which he  wrote under the direction of Ra served as a protection of the servants  of Ra ever after, and secured for them the help of Keb, who became sole  lord of all the beings that lived and moved on and in his body, the  earth. Before finally relinquishing his active rule on earth, Ra  summoned Thoth and told him of his desire to create a Light-soul in the  Tuat and in the Land of the Caves. Over this region he appointed Thoth  to rule, and he ordered him to keep a register of those who were there,  and to mete out just punishments to them. In fact, Thoth was to be ever  after the representative of Ra in the Other World.                             THE LEGEND OF RA AND ISIS    This Legend is found written in the hieratic character upon a papyrus  preserved in Turin, and it illustrates a portion of the preceding  Legend. We have seen that Ra instructed Thoth to draw up a series of  spells to be used against venomous reptiles of all kinds, and the reader  will perceive from the following summary that Ra had good reason for  doing this. The Legend opens with a list of the titles of Ra, the  \"self-created god,\" creator of heaven, earth, breath of life, fire,  gods, men, beasts, cattle, reptiles, feathered fowl, and fish, the King  of gods and men, to whom cycles of 120 years are as years, whose  manifold names are unknown even by the gods. The text continues: \"Isis  had the form of a woman, and knew words of power, but she was disgusted  with men, and she yearned for the companionship of the gods and the  spirits, and she meditated and asked herself whether, supposing she had  the knowledge of the Name of Ra, it was not possible to make herself as  great as Ra was in heaven and on the earth? Meanwhile Ra appeared in  heaven each day upon his throne, but he had become old, and he dribbled  at the mouth, and his spittle fell on the ground. One day Isis took some  of the spittle and kneaded up dust in it, and made this paste into the  form of a serpent with a forked tongue, so that if it struck anyone the  person struck would find it impossible to escape death. This figure she  placed on the path on which Ra walked as he came into heaven after his  daily survey of the Two Lands (_i.e._ Egypt). Soon after this Ra rose  up, and attended by his gods he came into heaven, but as he went along  the serpent drove its fangs into him. As soon as he was bitten Ra felt  the living fire leaving his body, and he cried out so loudly that his  voice reached the uttermost parts of heaven. The gods rushed to him in  great alarm, saying, \"What is the matter?\" At first Ra was speechless,  and found himself unable to answer, for his jaws shook, his lips  trembled, and the poison continued to run through every part of his  body. When he was able to regain a little strength, he told the gods  that some deadly creature had bitten him, something the like of which he  had never seen, something which his hand had never made. He said, \"Never  before have I felt such pain; there is no pain worse than this.\" Ra then  went on to describe his greatness and power, and told the listening gods  that his father and mother had hidden his name in his body so that no  one might be able to master him by means of any spell or word of power.  In spite of this something had struck him, and he knew not what it was.  \"Is it fire?\" he asked. \"Is it water? My heart is full of burning fire,  my limbs are shivering, shooting pains are in all my members.\" All the  gods round about him uttered cries of lamentation, and at this moment  Isis appeared. Going to Ra she said, \"What is this, O divine father?  What is this? Hath a serpent bitten thee? Hath something made by thee  lifted up its head against thee? Verily my words of power shall  overthrow it; I will make it depart in the sight of thy light.\" Ra then  repeated to Isis the story of the incident, adding, \"I am colder than  water, I am hotter than fire. All my members sweat. My body quaketh.  Mine eye is unsteady. I cannot look on the sky, and my face is bedewed  with water as in the time of the Inundation.\"[1] Then Isis said,  \"Father, tell me thy name, for he who can utter his own name liveth.\"    [Footnote 1: _i.e._ in the period of summer. The season Shemmu began in  April and ended about July 15.]    Ra replied, \"I am the maker of heaven and earth. I knit together the  mountains and whatsoever liveth on them. I made the waters. I made  Mehturit[1] to come into being. I made Kamutef.[2] I made heaven, and  the two hidden gods of the horizon, and put souls into the gods. I open  my eyes, and there is light; I shut my eyes, and there is darkness. I  speak the word[s], and the waters of the Nile appear. I am he whom the  gods know not. I make the hours. I create the days. I open the year. I  make the river [Nile]. I create the living fire whereby works in the  foundries and workshops are carried out. I am Khepera in the morning, Ra  at noon, and Temu in the evening.\" Meanwhile the poison of the serpent  was coursing through the veins of Ra, and the enumeration of his works  afforded the god no relief from it. Then Isis said to Ra, \"Among all the  things which thou hast named to me thou hast not named thy name. Tell me  thy name, and the poison shall come forth from thee.\" Ra still  hesitated, but the poison was burning in his blood, and the heat thereof  was stronger than that of a fierce fire. At length he said, \"Isis shall  search me through, and my name shall come forth from my body and pass  into hers.\" Then Ra hid himself from the gods, and for a season his  throne in the Boat of Millions of Years was empty. When the time came  for the heart of the god to pass into Isis, the goddess said to Horus,  her son, \"The great god shall bind himself by an oath to give us his two  eyes (_i.e._ the sun and the moon).\" When the great god had yielded up  his name Isis pronounced the following spell: \"Flow poison, come out of  Ra. Eye of Horus, come out of the god, and sparkle as thou comest  through his mouth. I am the worker. I make the poison to fall on the  ground. The poison is conquered. Truly the name of the great god hath  been taken from him. Ra liveth! The poison dieth! If the poison live Ra  shall die.\" These were the words which Isis spoke, Isis the great lady,  the Queen of the gods, who knew Ra by his own name.    [Footnote 1: An ancient Cow-goddess of heaven.]    [Footnote 2: A form of Amen-Ra.]    In late times magicians used to write the above Legend on papyrus above  figures of Temu and Heru-Hekenu, who gave Ra his secret name, and over  figures of Isis and Horus, and sell the rolls as charms against snake  bites.                THE LEGEND OF HORUS OF BEHUTET AND THE WINGED DISK    The text of this Legend is cut in hieroglyphs on the walls of the temple  of Edfu, in Upper Egypt, and some of the incidents described in it are  illustrated by large bas-reliefs. The form of the Legend here given  dates from the Ptolemaic Period, but the subject matter is some  thousands of years older. The great historical fact underlying the  Legend is the Conquest of Egypt by some very early king who invaded  Egypt from the south, and who succeeded in conquering every part of it,  even the northern part of the Delta. The events described are supposed  to have taken place whilst Ra was still reigning on the earth. The  Legend states that in the three hundred and sixty-third year of the  reign of Ra-Harmakhis, the ever living, His Majesty was in Ta-sti  (_i.e._ the Land of the Bow, or Nubia) with his soldiers; the enemy had  reviled him, and for this reason the land is called \"Uauatet\" to this  day. From Nubia Ra sailed down the river to Apollinopolis (Edfu), and  Heru-Behutet, or Horus of Edfu, was with him. On arriving there Horus  told Ra that the enemy were plotting against him, and Ra told him to go  out and slay them. Horus took the form of a great winged disk, which  flew up into the air and pursued the enemy, and it attacked them with  such terrific force that they could neither see nor hear, and they fell  upon each other, and slew each other, and in a moment not a single foe  was left alive. Then Horus returned to the Boat of Ra-Harmakhis, in the  form of the winged disk which shone with many colours, and said,  \"Advance, O Ra, and look upon thine enemies who are lying under thee in  this land.\" Ra set out on the journey, taking with him the goddess  Ashtoreth, and he saw his enemies lying on the ground, each of them  being fettered. After looking upon his slaughtered foes Ra said to the  gods"]]]
