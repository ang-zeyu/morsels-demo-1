Another group again might come to worship a Serpent as its  presiding genius, or a particular kind of Tree, simply because these  objects were and had been for centuries prominent factors in its yearly  and seasonal Magic. As Reinach and others suggest, it was the Taboo  (bred by Fear) which by first forbidding contact with the totem-animal  or priest or magician-chief gradually invested him with Awe and  Divinity.    According to this theory the god--the full-grown god in human shape,  dwelling apart and beyond the earth--did not come first, but was a late  and more finished product of evolution. He grew up by degrees and out of  the preceding animal-worships and totem-systems. And this theory is much  supported and corroborated by the fact that in a vast number of early  cults the gods are represented by human figures with animal heads. The  Egyptian religion was full of such divinities--the jackal-headed  Anubis, the ram-headed Ammon, the bull-fronted Osiris, or Muth, queen of  darkness, clad in a vulture's skin; Minos and the Minotaur in Crete; in  Greece, Athena with an owl's head, or Herakles masked in the hide  and jaws of a monstrous lion. What could be more obvious than that,  following on the tribal worship of any totem-animal, the priest or  medicine-man or actual king in leading the magic ritual should don the  skin and head of that animal, and wear the same as a kind of mask--this  partly in order to appear to the people as the true representative of  the totem, and partly also in order to obtain from the skin the magic  virtues and mana of the beast, which he could then duly impart to the  crowd? Zeus, it must be remembered, wears the aegis, or goat-skin--said  to be the hide of the goat Amaltheia who suckled him in his infancy;  there are a number of legends which connected the Arcadian Artemis with  the worship of the bear, Apollo with the wolf, and so forth. And, most  curious as showing similarity of rites between the Old and New Worlds,  there are found plenty of examples of the wearing of beast-masks in  religious processions among the native tribes of both North and South  America. In the Atlas of Spix and Martius (who travelled together in  the Amazonian forests about 1820) there is an understanding and  characteristic picture of the men (and some women) of the tribe of the  Tecunas moving in procession through the woods mostly naked, except for  wearing animal heads and masks--the masks representing Cranes of various  kinds, Ducks, the Opossum, the Jaguar, the Parrot, etc., probably  symbolic of their respective clans.    By some such process as this, it may fairly be supposed, the forms of  the Gods were slowly exhaled from the actual figures of men and women,  of youths and girls, who year after year took part in the ancient  rituals. Just as the Queen of the May or Father Christmas with us are  idealized forms derived from the many happy maidens or white-bearded  old men who took leading parts in the May or December mummings and thus  gained their apotheosis in our literature and tradition--so doubtless  Zeus with his thunderbolts and arrows of lightning is the idealization  into Heaven of the Priestly rain-maker and storm-controller; Ares the  god of War, the similar idealization of the leading warrior in the  ritual war-dance preceding an attack on a neighboring tribe; and Mercury  of the foot-running Messenger whose swiftness in those days (devoid of  steam or electricity) was so precious a tribal possession.    And here it must be remembered that this explanation of the genesis of  the gods only applies to the SHAPES and FIGURES of the various deities.  It does not apply to the genesis of the widespread belief in spirits or  a Great Spirit generally; that, as I think will become clear, has  quite another source. Some people have jeered at the 'animistic' or  'anthropomorphic' tendency of primitive man in his contemplation of the  forces of Nature or his imaginations of religion and the gods. With a  kind of superior pity they speak of \"the poor Indian whose untutored  mind sees God in clouds and hears him in the wind.\" But I must confess  that to me the \"poor Indian\" seems on the whole to show more good sense  than his critics, and to have aimed his rude arrows at the philosophic  mark more successfully than a vast number of his learned and scientific  successors. A consideration of what we have said above would show that  early people felt their unity with Nature so deeply and intimately  that--like the animals themselves--they did not think consciously or  theorize about it. It was just their life to be--like the beasts of the  field and the trees of the forest--a part of the whole flux of things,  non-differentiated so to speak. What more natural or indeed more  logically correct than for them to assume (when they first began to  think or differentiate themselves) that these other creatures, these  birds, beasts and plants, and even the sun and moon, were of the same  blood as themselves, their first cousins, so to speak, and having the  same interior nature? What more reasonable (if indeed they credited  THEMSELVES with having some kind of soul or spirit) than to credit these  other creatures with a similar soul or spirit? Im Thurn, speaking of the  Guiana Indians, says that for them \"the whole world swarms with beings.\"  Surely this could not be taken to indicate an untutored mind--unless  indeed a mind untutored in the nonsense of the Schools--but rather a  very directly perceptive mind. And again what more reasonable (seeing  that these people themselves were in the animal stage of evolution) than  that they should pay great reverence to some ideal animal--first cousin  or ancestor--who played an important part in their tribal existence, and  make of this animal a totem emblem and a symbol of their common life?    And, further still, what more natural than that when the tribe passed  to some degree beyond the animal stage and began to realize a life more  intelligent and emotional--more specially human in fact--than that  of the beasts of the field, that it should then in its rituals and  ceremonies throw off the beast-mask and pay reverence to the interior  and more human spirit. Rising to a more enlightened consciousness of its  own intimate quality, and still deeply penetrated with the sense of its  kinship to external nature, it would inevitably and perfectly logically  credit the latter with an inner life and intelligence, more  distinctly human than before. Its religion in fact would become MORE  'anthropomorphic' instead of less so; and one sees that this is a  process that is inevitable; and inevitable notwithstanding a  certain parenthesis in the process, due to obvious elements in our  'Civilization' and to the temporary and fallacious domination of  a leaden-eyed so-called 'Science.' According to this view the true  evolution of Religion and Man's outlook on the world has proceeded not  by the denial by man of his unity with the world, but by his seeing and  understanding that unity more deeply. And the more deeply he understands  himself the more certainly he will recognize in the external world a  Being or beings resembling himself.    W. H. Hudson--whose mind is certainly not of a quality to be jeered  at--speaks of Animism as \"the projection of ourselves into nature:  the sense and apprehension of an intelligence like our own, but more  powerful, in all visible things\"; and continues, \"old as I am this same  primitive faculty which manifested itself in my early boyhood, still  persists, and in those early years was so powerful that I am almost  afraid to say how deeply I was moved by it.\" (1) Nor will it be quite  forgotten that Shelley once said:--         The moveless pillar of a mountain's weight       Is active living spirit. Every grain       Is sentient both in unity and part,       And the minutest atom comprehends       A world of loves and hatreds.     (1) Far Away and Long Ago, ch. xiii, p. 225.      The tendency to animism and later to anthropomorphism is I say  inevitable, and perfectly logical. But the great value of the work done  by some of those investigators whom I have quoted has been to show that  among quite primitive people (whose interior life and 'soul-sense' was  only very feeble) their projections of intelligence into Nature were  correspondingly feeble. The reflections of themselves projected into  the world beyond could not reach the stature of eternal 'gods,' but  were rather of the quality of ephemeral phantoms and ghosts; and the  ceremonials and creeds of that period are consequently more properly  described as, Magic than as Religion. There have indeed been great  controversies as to whether there has or has not been, in the course  of religious evolution, a PRE-animistic stage. Probably of course human  evolution in this matter must have been perfectly continuous from stages  presenting the very feeblest or an absolutely deficient animistic sense  to the very highest manifestations of anthropomorphism; but as there is  a good deal of evidence to show that ANIMALS (notably dogs and horses)  see ghosts, the inquiry ought certainly to be enlarged so far as to  include the pre-human species. Anyhow it must be remembered that the  question is one of CONSCIOUSNESS--that is, of how far and to what degree  consciousness of self has been developed in the animal or the primitive  man or the civilized man, and therefore how far and to what degree the  animal or human creature has credited the outside world with a similar  consciousness. It is not a question of whether there IS an inner life  and SUB-consciousness common to all these creatures of the earth and  sky, because that, I take it, is a fact beyond question; they all emerge  or have emerged from the same matrix, and are rooted in identity; but  it is a question of how far they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15620"],[0,"Recreations in Astronomy (#17)"],[1," down upon the earth aerolites; and comets, vast extents  of ghostly light, that come we know not whence and go we know not  whither. All these forms of matter are governed by the same laws  as the worlds, and are an integral part of the solar system--a  part of the unity of the universe.    [Illustration: Fig. 48.--Explosion of a Bolide.]    Everyone has seen the so-called shooting-stars. They break out  with a sudden brilliancy, shoot a few degrees with quiet speed,  and are gone before we can say, \"See there!\" The cause of their  appearance, the [Page 120] conversion of force into heat by their  contact with our atmosphere, has been already explained. Other facts  remain to be studied. They are found to appear about seventy-three  miles above the earth, and to disappear about twenty miles nearer  the surface. Their average velocity, thirty-five, sometimes rises to  one hundred miles a second. They exhibit different colors, according  to their different chemical substances, which are consumed. The  number of them to be seen on different nights is exceedingly  variable; sometimes not more [Page 121] than five or six an hour,  and sometimes so many that a man cannot count those appearing in a  small section of sky. This variability is found to be periodic.  There are everywhere in space little meteoric masses of matter, from  the weight of a grain to a ton, and from the density of gas to rock.  The earth meets 7,500,000 little bodies every day--there is  collision--the little meteoroid gives out its lightning sign of  extinction, and, consumed in fervent heat, drops to the earth as gas  or dust. If we add the number light enough to be seen by a  telescope, they cannot be less than 400,000,000 a day. Everywhere we  go, in a space as large as that occupied by the earth and its  atmosphere, there must be at least 13,000 bodies--one in 20,000,000  cubic miles--large enough to make a light visible to the naked eye,  and forty times that number capable of revealing themselves to  telescopic vision. Professor Peirce is about to publish, as the  startling result of his investigations, \"that the heat which the  earth receives directly from meteors is the same in amount which it  receives from the sun by radiation, and that the sun receives  five-sixths of its heat from the meteors that fall upon it.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 49.--Bolides.]    [Page 121]  In 1783 Dr. Schmidt was fortunate enough to have a telescopic view  of a system of bodies which had turned into meteors. These were two  larger bodies followed by several smaller ones, going in parallel  lines till they were extinguished. They probably had been revolving  about each other as worlds and satellites before entering our  atmosphere. It is more than probable that the earth has many such  bodies, too small to be visible, revolving around it as moons.    [Illustration: Fig. 50.--Santa Rosa Aerolite.]    _Aerolites._    Sometimes the bodies are large enough to bear the heat, and the  unconsumed centre comes to the earth. [Page 123] Their velocity has  been lessened by the resisting air, and the excessive heat  diminished. Still, if found soon after their descent, they are too  hot to be handled. These are called aerolites or air-stones. There  was a fall in Iowa, in February, 1875, from which fragments  amounting to five hundred pounds weight were secured. On the evening  of December 21st, 1876, a meteor of unusual size and brilliancy  passed over the states of Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and  Ohio. It was first seen in the western part of Kansas, at an  altitude of about sixty miles. In crossing the State of Missouri it  began to explode, and this breaking up continued while passing  Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, till it consisted of a large flock of  brilliant balls chasing each other across the sky, the number being  variously estimated at from twenty to one hundred. It was  accompanied by terrific explosions, and was seen along a path of not  less than a thousand miles. When first seen in Kansas, it is said to  have appeared as large as the full moon, and with a train from  twenty-five to one hundred feet long. Another, very similar in  appearance and behavior, passed over a part of the same course in  February, 1879. At Laigle, France, on April 26th, 1803, about one  o'clock in the day, from two to three thousand fell. The largest did  not exceed seventeen pounds weight. One fell in Weston, Connecticut,  in 1807, weighing two hundred pounds. A very destructive shower is  mentioned in the book of Joshua, chap. x. ver. 11.    These bodies are not evenly distributed through space. In some  places they are gathered into systems which circle round the sun  in orbits as certain as those of the [Page 124] planets. The chain  of asteroids is an illustration of meteoric bodies on a large scale.  They are hundreds in number--meteors are millions. They have their  region of travel, and the sun holds them and the giant Jupiter by  the same power. The Power that cares for a world cares for a  sparrow. If their orbit so lies that a planet passes through it, and  the planet and the meteors are at the point of intersection at the  same time, there must be collisions, and the lightning signs of  extinction proportioned to the number of little bodies in a given  space.    It is demonstrated that the earth encounters more than one hundred  such systems of meteoric bodies in a single year. It passes through  one on the 10th of August, another on the 11th of November. In  a certain part of the first there is an agglomeration of bodies  sufficient to become visible as it approaches the sun, and this is  known as the comet of 1862; in the second is a similar agglomeration,  known as Temple's comet. It is repeating the same thing to say that  meteoroids follow in the train of the comets. The probable orbit  of the November meteors and the comet of 1866 is an exceedingly  elongated ellipse, embracing the orbit of the earth at one end and  a portion of the orbit of Uranus at the other (Fig. 51). That of  the August meteors and the comet of 1862 embraces the orbit of  the earth at one end, and thirty per cent. of the other end is  beyond the orbit of Neptune.    [Illustration: Fig. 51.--Orbit of the November Meteors and the Comet  or 1866.]    In January, 1846, Biela's comet was observed to be divided. At  its next return, in 1852, the parts were 1,500,000 miles apart.  They could not be found on their periodic returns in 1859, 1865,  and 1872; but it [Page 125] should have crossed the earth's orbit  early in September, 1872. The earth itself would arrive at the point  of crossing two or three months later. If the law of revolution  held, we might still expect to find some of the trailing meteoroids  of the comet not gone by on our arrival. It was shown that the point  of the earth that would strike them would be toward a certain place  in the constellation of Andromeda, if the remains of the diluted  comet were still there. The prediction was verified in every  respect. At the appointed time, place, [Page 126] and direction, the  streaming lights were in our sky. That these little bodies belonged  to the original comet none can doubt. By the perturbations of  planetary attraction, or by different original velocities, a comet  may be lengthened into an invisible stream, or an invisible stream  agglomerated till it is visible as a comet.    _Comets._    Comets will be most easily understood by the foregoing considerations.  They are often treated as if they were no part of the solar system;  but they are under the control of the same laws, and owe their  existence, motion, and continuance to the same causes as Jupiter and  the rest of the planets. They are really planets of wider wandering,  greater ellipticity, and less density. They have periodic times  less than the earth, and fifty times as great as Neptune. They  are little clouds of gas or meteoric matter, or both, darting into  the solar system from every side, at every angle with the plane  of the ecliptic, becoming luminous with reflected light, passing  the sun, and returning again to outer darkness. Sometimes they  have no tail, having a nucleus surrounded by nebulosity like a  dim sun with zodiacal light; sometimes one tail, sometimes half a  dozen. These follow the comet to perihelion, and precede it afterward  (Fig. 52). The orbits of some comets are enormously elongated; one  end may lie inside the earth's orbit, and the other end be as far  beyond Neptune as that is from the sun. Of course only a small  part of such a curve can be studied by us: the comet is visible  only when near the sun. The same curve around the sun may be an  orbit that will bring it back again, [Page 127] or one that will  carry it off into infinite space, never to return. One rate of speed  on the curve indicates an elliptical orbit that returns; a greater  rate of speed indicates that it will take a parabolic orbit, which  never returns. The exact rate of speed is exceedingly difficult to  determine; hence it cannot be confidently asserted that any comet  ever visible will not return. They may all belong to the solar  system; but some will certainly be gone thousands of years before  their fiery forms will greet the watchful eyes of dwellers on the  earth. A comet that has an elliptic orbit may have it changed to  [Page 128] parabolic by the accelerations of its speed, by  attracting planets; or a parabolic comet may become elliptic, and so  permanently attracted to the system by the retardations of  attracting bodies. A comet of long period may be changed to one of  short period by such attraction, or _vice versa_.    [Illustration: Fig. 52.--Aspects of Remarkable Comets.]    The number of comets, like that of meteor streams, is exceedingly  large. Five hundred have been visible to the naked eye since the  Christian era. Two hundred have been seen by telescopes invented  since their invention. Some authorities estimate the number"]]]
