One of you boys will  stay with Muata to skin and cut up. It will be a good lesson.\"    The two looked at each other, and then away over the plain. Skinning  and cutting up was not exactly amusing.    \"All right; I'll stay,\" said Venning.    \"Each in his turn,\" said the hunter. \"Come along, Compton;\" and they  went off, as Venning turned up his shirt-sleeves.    It was hard work, this cutting up, but Muata was a master at the  job, and Venning learnt his lesson thoroughly.    The great hide was taken off in one piece without a slit; then long  strips of meat were cut off and hung over the branches of a tree.  When the rest of the meat had been stripped off, they packed it all  away in the hide, slung the bundle to a sapling, and, with each end  of the pole on a shoulder, they slowly carried the whole to the  camp. Venning hoped that his labours were over; but they had only  completed one task.  They had now to build a scaffolding on which to  hang the strips, after each had been well peppered to keep off the  flies, for the drying and smoking. This took another slice out of  the day; and when Venning had washed in the river, and cooked and  eaten his buffalo-steak, he resigned himself to the study of insects  in place of the pursuit of game, while Muata, who had melted down  the fat from the kidneys, sat and rubbed the oil into his limbs till  his skin shone.    \"Have you seen many buffalo?\" asked Venning, with a keen eye on a  bit of crooked stick that had seemed to move.    \"Many.\"    \"And you understand their ways?\"    \"I have watched as you watch the stick that is not a stick.\"    Venning picked up an insect--a strange creature which had adapted  itself to its surroundings by pretending to be a dried twig.    \"Tell me what you saw.\"    \"I saw the twin bulls when they were calves, and I saw them when  they led the herd, and when they lost the leadership. I watched  them. Ow aye, I knew their ways. Sometime, when I was yet a boy, I  could understand what they said.\"    \"What they said, chief?\"    \"See, the creatures are like men in their ways, and men are like  animals--each man like to one kind of animal. Haw! So I judged what  the buffalo would say if he could talk like men.\"    \"And what was the talk? Tell it me; for I also have given speech to  animals when I have watched alone.\"    \"I will tell you what I thought when I was young, and watched the  things of the forest. The wisest among the people I have met is a  woman; and among the things of the forest, the wisest were even a  buffalo cow who never had calf, and the mother of the yellow pack,  who had white eyes in her long head. Haw!    \"Now, the pack hunted on the same veld where a troop of buffalo  grazed, but the bull who led the troop was wise. He took counsel  with the old cow that was calf-less, and the pack could never find  the fat heifers or the younger calves unguarded. In the troop were  two young bulls--brothers; and these I had watched grow--watched  from my hiding. They were strong and fierce, and they eyed the old  bull full. Scarcely would they turn from his path. Wow! One morning  the old bull stood in the game-path, considering in his mind how it  came to happen that the earth had been fresh turned. While he stood,  the young bulls pressing behind suddenly put their horns to his  flanks and urged him forward. Mawoh! The old bull stepped on to the  newly turned earth, and went down into a pit that the hunters had  dug. He called to the troop to run from the danger, and they crashed  through the wood to the open glade.    \"Haw! A young dog of the pack heard the bellow from the earth, and  creeping near, he looked down upon the great bull. Then, with his  nose to the ground, he ran upon the trail of the troop till he saw  them in the opening. The young bulls moved among the cows. They  pushed the old cow aside, and later went through the tall grass into  a shallow vlei, where they wallowed in the mud. Then the young dog  ran back to the pack. This is what he said, as I understood--    \"'Behold, O mother,' he said, 'the great bull, even the leader, is  fallen in the trap made by man in the path.'    \"Who leads the troop now--the old cow or the two brothers?\"    'The young bulls, O mother, and they lie in the mud.'    \"Then the she-dog called the pack together. I heard the call, and  knew there would be hunting. She called them and made a plan. I saw  afterwards the plan she made. The young dogs she sent round to the  far side of the vlei, and she came with the biggest of the pack to  the side nearest the forest. From the edge of the wood she looked  out on the open. The old cow stood alone, with her head turning now  this way, then that way. The others grazed with their calves. The  heifers stood foot-deep in the water near the bulls.    \"The old dog turned to the pack. 'This comes of the folly of the  young,' she said; and her white eyes ran from dog to dog. 'Those two  lie like pigs. We will eat buffalo to-night. Scatter and wait.'    \"Three dogs went to the right of her and three to the left. They  stretched themselves in the grass. The old cow blew through her  nostrils. She struck the ground, and the cows with the young calves  ran to her. They gathered in a bunch, heads out. From beyond came  the hunting-cry of the young dogs. The heifers moved, but the bulls  kept still.' It is but a dog yapping after a hare,' they said.  'Stand you still.'    \"But the hunting-cry drew nearer. The cows lowered their heads,  bellowing, and the heifers ran. Wow! The young dogs cut one out, and  raced her right to where the great mother of the pack crouched. As  the heifer came by, the white jaws snapped at her belly, and bit  deep, so that blood flowed, and on the scent of the blood the pack  went into the forest. They ate buffalo that night.    \"The young bulls rose from the mud. They ran to and fro in the open;  their eyes were red, and the foam dripped from their black lips.  Wow! they were angry, Ow aye, they were covered with shame and mud.  The old cow moved away, and the cows with young followed her. The  heifers, trembling in their limbs, would have followed also, but the  bulls headed them off. There was much talk in the forest over this.  They said the bulls had learnt wisdom. No dog would take a member of  the troop again. The bulls tossed their horns. 'If a lion comes,'  they said, 'we would beat him off.'    \"The pack tried again, and were beaten off; but the old she yawned.  'In a few days, my children,' she said, 'we will eat buffalo, even  of the meat of the young bulls. There never were two leaders in a  pack'--and her white eyes went to a dog who had hopes of the  leadership--'never; and in a day, or two days, these brothers will  fight. They will fight hard; and when the fight is done the pack  will steal upon them. When they stand panting, with lowered heads  and feet wide apart, we will bite at the softness of their bellies.'  She licked her lips, and the tongues of the pack curled over their  lips also. So the young dogs were set to watch upon the brothers;  and it came to pass as the old mother said--the brothers fought. It  began in play. One swung his head at the other, and the other swung  back.    \"When a grown bull swings his head, O white boy, who picked me out  of the sea, it is like the blow of a falling tree. There is the  weight of his head with the heavy horns, the arch of his neck, and  the power in his shoulders where the muscles lie. The blows roused  the fury in them. They looked sideways at each other, then their  tails went up, and they came together. Wow!! The noise rang far. The  hunting dogs ran swiftly to the pack, and as they ran there followed  them the noise of the fight.    \"I stole near to watch. It was a battle. The ground was torn up as  in the hoeing, where their hoofs clung for a footing under the  pressure. First they pushed, head to head, nose near the ground, red  eyes looking into red eyes. The heifers stood in a cluster watching.  It was a still battle. They saved their breath, and as they breathed  the dust flew. For many minutes they pushed, swaying, one losing  ground for a time, then gaining it back. The foam gathered on their  lips and dropped to the ground. The sweat ran under their bellies.  Then one slipped, and the other struck under the shoulder. From the  lower rib to the back there ran a white mark. The white mark turned  black, and blood came out. At the pain of it the stricken bull  grunted and struck up.  His horn struck under the body, and with the  cracking of his joints he heaved the other over. Haw! He rolled him  right over and sprang at him. Wow!! He struck and stood back. The  other was on his feet swiftly. With the swiftness of a little cat he  gained his feet. So they stood with their heads up, staring with red  eyes. Again they came together. Again they shoved and strained, and  the dust caked on the blood that covered them. The ground beneath  them that was dry, was now muddy from the trampled blood. Then they  swung their heads and struck, grunting at the blows, and stood  apart, and came together, till the blood started from their ears.  Their breath came in gasps, and the silence was broken. From their  lips, all blood-covered, there came a moaning. Ow aye, the moaning  of a mother over her dead. The heifers ran forward, then back; they  ran round and galloped away, afraid--galloped into the forest.    \"In my heart, O white friend, I was sorry for the brothers. The  moaning was the cry of sorrow that one felt for the other. 'O my  brother, I must slay you,' that was the meaning of the moaning.  Their tongues rolled out, swollen; their legs shook, their eyes were  covered with mist. Yet they swung their heads, and each time the  horns were wet with blood, and the moaning came"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17636"],[0,"The Mystery at Putnam Hall: The School Chums' Strange Discovery (#17)"],[1,"w; and I'll let Ruddy have one, too.\"    Again came a ringing war-cry, and in a moment more the battle was  continued. Back and forth swayed the lines of cadets, first towards one  end of the field and then towards the other. It was plainly to be seen  that the commands were about evenly matched.    \"How long is this battle to last?\" questioned Joe Nelson.    \"Half an hour,\" answered Fred Century, who was beside him.    \"Time is almost up, then,\" came from Bert Field, who had been fighting  so hard he was almost out of breath.    \"Five minutes more!\" came from the referee. \"Now then, if either side  is going to do something, pitch in!\"    \"Forward!\" came simultaneously from both captains, and forward plunged  Company A and Company B, and the snowballs commenced to fly as thickly  as before. Neither side would give ground, and at last the two lines  were within fifteen to twenty feet of each other, right in the center of  the field.    The time was almost up, and each command was getting rid of the last of  the snowballs, when Jack saw a snowball leave Coulter's hand and sail  swiftly towards Pepper. The Imp did not see it until it was quite close  to him and failed in his attempt to dodge. The snowball hit him full in  the temple and over he went as if struck with a club.    \"Pepper!\" cried the young major in horror, and started to rush to his  chum's assistance, when another snowball came flying through the air. It  struck Jack over the ear, and he, too, went down, all but knocked  unconscious.    A bugle blew, and the great snowballing contest came to an end.    \"A tie! A tie!\" was the cry. \"Neither side wins!\"    \"Let the two captains shake hands and call it off!\" said one cadet.    \"I'm willing!\" cried Bart, readily.    \"So am I,\" added Henry, and then the pair shook hands, while a great  cheer rolled up from both sides. But the cheer came to an abrupt end  when Fred Century cried out:    \"Pepper Ditmore is hurt!\"    \"And so is Major Ruddy!\" came from Emerald Hogan.    A crowd quickly gathered around each wounded cadet. Pepper had a nasty  cut over the left eye and Jack had a lump behind his right ear.    \"They must have been hit with soakers,\" was Dale's comment, as he bent  over Pepper.    \"Looks as if Pepper was hit with a stone,\" came from Andy.    \"A stone!\" cried Bart Field.    \"Yes, a stone! That cut was never made by a snowball, or a piece of ice,  either!\"    \"Shall I get a doctor?\" asked Stuffer, anxiously.    \"Oh, are they as bad as that?\" asked Bob Grenwood.    \"I don't know,\" answered Bert, soberly. \"Wait a minute and we'll see if  they come around.\"    \"Oh, what a crack!\" murmured Jack, and then he sat up and stared around  him. Pepper was also stirring and he slowly put one hand to the cut on  his temple.    \"Let us carry 'em to the Hall,\" suggested Bert. \"It's getting too cold  out here and besides, they are all in a sweat from the snowballing.\"    When Pepper was picked up, Andy saw something lying beneath him in the  snow. He picked it up.    \"Hello! look here!\" he called out, and held the object up.    \"A stone!\"    \"Where did it come from, Andy?\"    \"It was under Pepper's body. I believe it was in the snowball that hit  him!\"    \"Who would be so mean?\"    \"I rather guess I know,\" answered Pepper, and looked around for Ritter  and Coulter, but the bully and his crony had disappeared.    Pepper and Jack were carried tenderly into the Hall and placed in easy  chairs in the reception room. Presently both had recovered consciousness  fully, and each had his head bound up in bandages.    \"Phew, but that was a crack I got!\" sighed The Imp. \"I thought a rock  had hit me!\"    \"It was Coulter who threw that snowball,\" said the young major. \"I saw  him do it, and I was running to help you up when I got struck myself,  and went down.\"    \"And I am pretty sure Ritter hit you, Jack,\" came from Andy. \"Anyway, I  saw him aiming for you just before you staggered and fell.\"    \"Andy, those fellows must have hit us with stones!\" muttered The Imp.    \"I feel sure they did. Ritter struck me with a snowball, on the hand,  and it left a deep scratch. Now, no ordinary snowball would do that.  Besides that, I picked up a sharp stone from where Pepper was lying.\"    \"It was against the rules of the contest to use stones,\" put in Dale,  who was near.    \"Sure it was!\" cried Stuffer. \"If those chaps really used stones they  ought to be punished for it.\"    The news quickly went the rounds, as was to be expected. When Henry Lee  heard it he quickly sought out Captain Bart.    \"I hope you don't think I allowed any such underhand work,\" he said  anxiously.    \"Not for a minute, Henry!\" cried the captain of Company B. \"If Ritter  and Coulter did it, they did it on their own responsibility. I think  them just mean enough, too, for they are down on Major Ruddy and Pepper  Ditmore.\"    \"If they are guilty, I'd like to have them court-martialed!\" muttered  the commander of Company A. \"Such underhand work is a disgrace to Putnam  Hall!\"    \"Wait and see if it can be proven,\" answered Bart Conners. \"Then, if it  is proven, we'll read Ritter and Coulter a lecture they won't forget in  a hurry!\" he added significantly.          CHAPTER XVI    IN WHICH MORE VALUABLES VANISH      That night it snowed again, and in the morning the storm raged furiously  around Putnam Hall, so that the landscape on all sides was completely  blotted out. The cadets had to remain indoors, and it was hard work to  keep a path clear to the gymnasium and the stables.    \"We'll be snowbound and no mistake,\" observed Andy. \"Well, I don't care  much; it will give me a chance to catch up in my lessons.\"    \"Very far behind, Andy?\" asked Jack.    \"More than I like to think about, Jack. I want to graduate with honor,  you know.\"    \"Oh, we all want to do that.\"    \"How's the head?\"    \"Still sore. But I guess I'll be all right again in a few days.\"    \"How about you, Pepper?\"    \"I'll be all right, too, Andy. But it was a fierce crack!\" added  Pepper, as his hand went up gingerly to his plastered-up cut.    \"Going to lodge a complaint against Ritter and Coulter?\"    \"What good would it do? We can't actually prove that they used stones?\"    \"Let it pass. If we make a complaint it will only stir up more bad  blood,\" said the young major. \"But in the future I am going to watch  Ritter and Coulter pretty closely.\"    The boys were kept at the Hall for all of that week, getting no further  than the gymnasium for recreation. The wind blew furiously at times, so  that the snow was piled up into numerous drifts, one reaching almost to  the top of the carriage-shed, and another completely hiding the posts of  the gate entrance.    \"This must be tough on some of the farmers,\" observed Dale. \"Think of  trying to get the milk to the station in such weather.\"    \"Well, a farmer usually has enough to eat,\" answered Stuffer. \"That  counts for a good deal. Now if a fellow was snowbound and didn't have  any grub----\" He did not finish but shook his head dolefully. To Stuffer  such a fate was beyond words.    As was to be expected, Ritter and Coulter kept out of the way of Jack  and Pepper. Once the young major met the pair on the stairs, but they  simply glared at him and passed on before he could say a word.    During all this time Captain Putnam had been doing his best to solve the  mystery concerning the disappearance of Jack's gold watch and chain.  But, though all the hired help and the cadets and teachers were watched  and questioned, nothing of importance came to light. Peleg Snuggers said  he had once seen a strange man near the stables, and Captain Putnam  wondered if that individual could have sneaked into the school and  committed the robbery.    \"But if he did that, why didn't he take more?\" he said, in speaking of  the matter to George Strong.    \"I am sure I don't know, sir,\" answered the teacher. \"For the matter of  that, why wouldn't any thief take more, if he had the chance?\"    \"I give it up, Strong. This thing makes me feel sick.\"    \"Well, we must keep our eyes open,\" answered George Strong; and then the  conversation changed to the lessons for the next day.    On Tuesday morning, Pepper chanced to go to a bureau-drawer in which he  kept his collars, cuffs, neckties and jewelry. He commenced to look for  something and ended by turning out everything in the compartment.    \"What's wrong, Pepper?\" asked Jack. \"Lost some diamonds?\"    \"It's my ruby scarfpin, Jack. Did you see it?\"    \"No, not for some time. Did you have it in that drawer?\"    \"I did.\"    \"When did you wear it last?\"    \"The night we took dinner with the Fords.\"    \"Are you sure you put it back when you came home?\"    \"Positive. I keep it in this case,\" and Pepper held up an empty jewelry  case.    \"Gracious! This is becoming interesting!\" murmured the young major.  \"First my watch and chain and now your scarfpin!\" He looked pointedly at  his chum. \"Pepper, do you think----\" He stopped short.    \"Think what, Jack?\"    \"Oh, I'd hate to say it, Pepper,\" and the young major shrugged his  shoulders.    \"Were you going to mention Ritter and Coulter?\"    \"I was. But maybe it wouldn't be fair. It's a terrible thing to think  anybody a thief.\"    \"That is true. But maybe they took them as a joke and hid them.\"    \"That is past a joke.\"    Pepper continued to hunt around until it was time to go below. Then he  marched straight to Captain Putnam's private office.    The captain listened with a sinking heart to what the cadet had to say.  It was terrible to think that a thief was at large in the school and  could not be caught.    \"You are positive that you had the scarfpin when you came home,  Ditmore?\" he questioned.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And you put it in the case in the drawer?\"    \"I did.\"    \"Was the drawer locked?\"    \"Part of the time. Sometimes I forgot and left the key in the lock.\"    \"What sort of a scarfpin was it?\"    \"It was a sort of a clover effect, of gold, with a ruby and three small  "]]]
