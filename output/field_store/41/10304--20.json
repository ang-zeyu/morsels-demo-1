He commanded a Neapolitan warship called  the _Tancredi_, and had fought in Admiral Hotham's action on the 14th  March, 1795, and gained distinction, accompanying the Royal Family to  Palermo. He was given permission by the King to return for the purpose  of protecting his large property. The French had entered Neapolitan  territory and seized his estates, on the ground that he was a  Royalist, and the only way he could recover them was by agreeing to  take command of the Neapolitan fleet. The French were obliged to  evacuate the country, and left their friends to settle matters for  themselves as best they could. Carraciolli concealed himself, but was  discovered in disguise and put on board the _Foudroyant_ with his  hands tied behind his back. Captain Hardy, who was a man with a heart,  was indignant when he saw the old man subjected to such gross  indignity, and immediately ordered his hands to be liberated.    Nelson committed him for trial, which commenced at ten o'clock, and at  twelve he was declared guilty. At five o'clock he was hanged at the  yardarm of the Neapolitan frigate _Minerva_. This poor old man was  tried solely by his enemies without being allowed to have counsel or  call witnesses. A miscreant called Count Thurn, a worse enemy than  all, presided over the court. Carraciolli asked Lieutenant Parkinson  to obtain for him a new trial. Nelson, who had ordered the first,  could not or would not grant a second. Carraciolli asked to be shot,  and this also was refused. On the grounds of former association, he  sought the aid of Lady Hamilton, but she, being an approving party to  the execution, only came from her concealment to enjoy the sight of  the old Prince's dead body dangling at the yardarm. \"Come, Bronte,  come,\" said she, \"let us take the barge and have another look at  Carraciolli\"; and there they feasted their eyes on the lifeless  remains of their former associate, who had assuredly cursed them both  with his last dying breath. It is the custom when sailors are buried  at sea to weight their feet so that the body may sink in an upright  position. The same course was adopted with Carraciolli; shot was put  at his feet, but not sufficient, and he was cast into the sea. In a  few days the putrified body rose to the surface head upwards, as  though the murdered man had come again to haunt his executioners and  give them a further opportunity of gazing at the ghastly features of  their victim.[11] The sight of his old friend emerging again terrified  Ferdinand, and he became afflicted with a feeling of abiding horror  which he sought to appease by having the body interred in a Christian  burial-ground. But the spirit of his executed friend worried him all  his remaining days, and the act of burial did not save Naples from  becoming a shambles of conflict, robbery, and revolution. Neither did  Emma Hamilton escape her just deserts for the vile part she played in  one of the most abominable crimes ever committed. Her latter hours  were made terrible by the thought of the mockery of a trial, and the  constant vision of the Prince's ghost glowering at her from the  _Minerva's_ yardarm and from the surface of his watery tomb from which  he had risen again to reproach her with the inhuman pleasure she had  taken in watching the dreadful act. Nor did her shrieking avowal of  repentance give the wretched Jezebel of a woman the assurance of  forgiveness. She sought for distractions, and found most of them in  wickedness, and passed into the presence of the Great Mystery with all  her deeds of faithlessness, deceit, and uncontrollable revenge before  her eyes.    It is sad to read of and hear the insensate rubbish that is talked of  new earths that are to evolve from war, as though it could be divorced  from wounds and death, unspeakable crime, suffering in all its varied  forms, and the destruction of property which must always be a direct  result. The spectacle of it can never be other, except to the  martially-minded, than a shuddering horror. I would ask any one who is  imbued with the idea that out of wars spring new worlds to name a  single instance where a nation that has engaged in it has not been  left bleeding at its extremities, no matter whether it emerges as  victor or vanquished. I would further ask the writer or orator who  talks in this strain if he imagines that the sending of myriads of men  to death can contribute to the making of new earths. The consequences  are much too tragically serious to the nation, and indeed to the  world, to be played with by smug diplomatists who seek to excite the  populace into support of their calamitous efforts at statesmanship by  shallow bursts of eloquence about the new conditions of life which are  to accrue from their imitation of Germanism.    No doubt Nelson thought, when he had poor old Prince Carraciolli  hung, that he would create a new earth by striking terror into the  hearts of the Neapolitan race, but natural laws are not worked out by  methods of this kind, and Nelson had the mortification of seeing his  plan of regulating human affairs create a new and more ferocious  little hell on earth. His judgment at this time was very much warped  through the evil influence of the Court of Naples and more especially  by his infatuation for Lady Hamilton.    Greville, and subsequently Sir William Hamilton, had taken great pains  to educate Emma Hart. Hamilton writes to his nephew: \"I can assure you  her behaviour is such as has acquired her many sensible admirers, and  we have good man society, and all the female nobility, with the Queen  at their head, show her every mark of civility.\" Hamilton writes  further: \"Hitherto, her behaviour is irreproachable, but her temper,  as you must know, unequal.\" Lady Malmesbury (with a decidedly sly  scratch) says of her: \"She really behaves as well as possible, and  quite wonderfully, considering her origin and education.\" Sir George  Elliot says: \"Her manners are perfectly, unpolished, very easy, but  not with the ease of good breeding, but of a barmaid; excessively  good-humoured, wishing to please and be admired by everybody that came  in her way. She has acquired since her marriage some knowledge of  history and of the arts, and one wonders at the application and pains  she has taken to make herself what she is. With men her language and  conversation are exaggerations of anything I ever heard anywhere; and  I was wonderfully struck with these inveterate remains of her origin,  though the impression was very much weakened by seeing the other  ladies of Naples.\" A naval lieutenant at Naples stated he \"thought her  a very handsome, vulgar woman.\" There is no stabbing with a sneer  about this opinion. It expresses in a few words the candid opinion of  the sailor. Mrs. St. George thinks her \"bold, daring, vain even to  folly, and stamped with the manners of her first situation much more  strongly than one would suppose, after having represented Majesty and  lived in good company fifteen years. Her dress is frightful. Her waist  is absolutely between her shoulders. Her figure is colossal, but,  excepting her feet, which are hideous, well shaped. The shape of all  her features is fine, as is the form of her head, and particularly her  ears; her teeth are a little irregular, but tolerably white; her eyes  light blue, with a brown spot in one, which, though a defect, takes  nothing away from her beauty or expression. Her eyebrows and hair,  which, by the bye, is never clean, are dark and her complexion coarse.  Her expression is strongly marked, variable, and interesting; her  movements in common life ungraceful, her voice loud, yet not  disagreeable.\" This female critic seems to have been overburdened with  the weight of Emma's defects, mental and physical! Elliot says: \"Her  person is nothing short of monstrous for its enormity, and is growing  every day. Her face is beautiful.\" The latter view tones down the  apparent desire not to say too much in her favour.    We are persuaded, in fact, that the foregoing views of Lady Hamilton's  personal appearance are not correct. They give the impression that the  opinions of her critics are based on the woman's lowly origin, and  that they assume that because she was the offspring of poor parents  she ought to be described as a fat hoyden with the manners of the  kitchen. The people who knew her intimately do not make her out to be  a stout, unwholesome, East-End Palestiner. The sister of Marie  Antoinette, be it remembered, was her close companion, and many  English ladies living in Naples and visiting there were scarcely  likely to associate with a person who could not display better looks  and manners than those set forth. Nelson, the Prince of Wales, and her  many other men admirers, were hardly likely to tumble over each other  in competition for her smiles and favours if \"her dress was  frightful,\" \"her waist between her shoulders,\" \"her hair dirty,\" \"her  feet hideous,\" \"her bones large,\" \"her complexion coarse,\" and \"her  person monstrous for its enormity, growing every day.\"    We are inclined to place little dependence on the accuracy of people  who seem to have described her according to their moods or perhaps  according to the manner of her admirers towards themselves. That she  was clever and attractive there can be no doubt, and it is equally  certain that she won for herself the mortal enmity of many ladies who  saw her powerful influence over prominent men and women whom they  themselves bored. Some importance must be given to her husband's  position as British representative; his influence must have been  great, especially in Neapolitan circles. This would help her natural  gifts of fascination, even though her breeding and education did not  reach the standard of her blue-blooded critics. She had something that  stood her in greater"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15319"],[0,"The Government Class Book (#17)"],[1,"owner for his land; for it is declared by the state constitutions, that  \"private property shall not be taken for public use without just  compensation.\"    Sec.12. If, therefore, the legislature deem a proposed railroad to be of  public utility, they pass an act to incorporate a company with the  requisite powers to construct the road, on making compensation for the  land, the value of which is to be estimated in such manner as the law  prescribes. The law also prescribes the manner in which the affairs of  the road are to be conducted.    Sec.13. The amount of capital to be employed by the company, is mentioned  in the act of incorporation, or charter, and is raised in this way: The  amount of the capital, or stock, is divided into shares of $100, or  less. Persons wishing to invest money in the road, subscribe the number  of shares they will respectively take. When all the shares are thus sold  and the money is paid in, the company is ready to proceed to the  construction of the road. The owners of these shares are called  _stockholders_, who choose from among themselves such number of  _directors_ as the charter authorizes. The directors elect from their  number a _president_.    Sec.14. Persons buying shares receive certificates signed by the proper  officers, stating the number of shares for which each certificate is  given. The holders of these certificates, if they wish to make other use  of the money they have invested in the business, may sell their stock to  others, to whom they pass their certificates, which are evidence of the  amount of stock purchased. Thus these certificates are bought and sold  as promissory notes.    Sec.15. Stockholders depend, for the reimbursement of their capital, upon  the money to be received for the transportation of passengers and  freight. Such portion of the income of the road as remains after paying  all expenses of running and repairs, is divided semi-annually among the  stockholders. Hence the sums thus divided are called _dividends_. The  earnings of some roads are so large as to make the investment a  profitable one; so that the holder of shares is enabled to sell them at  an advance. When shares in the stock of any institution are sold at  their nominal value, the price named in the certificates, the stock is  said to be at _par_. When they are sold for more or less than their  nominal value, they are said to be above or below _par_. In large  commercial cities, as New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and others, the  purchase and sale of state stocks, and stocks in rail-roads, banks, &c.,  is a regular and extensive business of capitalists.          Chapter XXIV.    Banks and Insurance Companies.        Sec.1. Banks, we are told, were first instituted in Italy, where certain  Jews assembled, seated on benches, ready to lend money, and to exchange  money and bills; and _banco_ being the Italian name for bench, banks  took their title from this word. The first banks are said to have been  only places where money was laid up or deposited for safe-keeping. But  banks at the present day are not used for depositing alone.    Sec.2. Banks in this country can be established only by authority of law.  They are incorporated by an act of the legislature. The capital stock is  raised by the sale of shares, and issue of certificates, as in the case  of rail-roads. (Chap. XXIII., Sec.13.) The stockholders elect of their  number (usually) thirteen _directors_, who choose one of themselves as  _president_. The president and directors choose a cashier and clerks.    Sec.3. Merchants and others in commercial places, deposit in banks, for  safe-keeping, the money they receive in the course of business, and then  draw it out on their written orders as they have occasion to use it. An  order of this kind is called a _check_.    Sec.4. Persons depositing money only once, or very seldom, and intending to  draw for the same at once, usually receive from the cashier a  _certificate of deposit_, which states the name of the depositor, the  sum deposited, and to whose order it is to be paid. For the use of money  deposited for any considerable period, banks agree to pay interest,  usually less, however, than the rate established by law. Certificates of  deposit may, by indorsement, be made transferable as promissory notes  and other negotiable paper, (Chap. LX., Sec.2,) and are often remitted,  instead of money, to distant places, where, by presenting them at a  bank, they may, for a trifling compensation, be converted into money.    Sec.5. A material part of the business of banks is to assist merchants and  others in transmitting money to distant places. Thus: A, in New York,  wishing to send $1,000 to B, in Philadelphia, puts the money into a bank  in New York, takes for it an order, called _draft_, on a bank in  Philadelphia, for that amount, to be paid to B. The draft is sent by  mail to B, who presents his draft at the bank, and receives the money;  and the bank charges the amount to the New York bank.    Sec.6. But persons unacquainted with commercial business, especially young  persons, may not know how the bank in Philadelphia is to be repaid. In  the course of trade between the two cities, business men are constantly  remitting money both ways through the banks, which thus receive the  money and draw upon each other. Thus millions of dollars may be annually  transmitted between the two cities, without any expense except the small  charge of the banks for doing the business, and without the risk of loss  by accident or robbery which attends the conveyance of money in person.    Sec.7. Banks also lend money. The borrower gives a note for the sum  wanted, signed by himself, and indorsed by one or more others as  sureties. The cashier pays the money for the note, retaining out of it  the interest on the sum lent, instead of waiting for it until the note  becomes due. This is called _discounting_ a note.    Sec.8. The bills of banks pass as money. A bank bill or note is a promise  of the bank to pay the bearer a certain sum on demand, signed by the  president and cashier. It passes as money, because the bank is bound to  pay it in specie if it is demanded. Paying notes thus is _redeeming_  them. When a bank is unable to redeem all its bills, it is said to have  failed, or to be broken; and the bill holders suffer loss, unless some  security has been provided. This has been done in some states by making  the stockholders individually liable for the redemption of the bills;  that is, the property owned by them as individuals may be taken and sold  on execution for that purpose. Such security, however, has never been  generally provided.    Sec.9. But a system of banking, sometimes called _free banking_, has more  recently been adopted in some states. It is so called, because the  business of banking is thrown open to all by a _general law_. Any  person, or any number of persons, may, by complying with the provisions  of this general law, establish a bank without a special law for this  purpose. Hence it is also called the _general banking_ system.    Sec.10. Persons, before commencing business under this law, must put into  the hands of the proper state officers ample securities for the  redemption of their bills; and they may not issue bills to a greater  amount than the amount of their securities. These securities must  consist of approved state stocks, or United States stocks, or partly of  public stocks, and partly of real estate. When a bank fails, the lands  and stocks held in pledge by the state are sold, and the avails are  applied to the redemption of the bills. This system of banking seems to  be growing into public favor.    Sec.11. _Insurance companies_ also are authorized by law. Their business is  to insure persons against loss by fire. The corporators, on being paid a  small sum, consisting generally of a certain percentage on the amount  for which the property is insured, promise to pay such amount if the  property shall be destroyed by fire. There are companies also for  insuring vessels at sea; and _life_ insurance companies, that agree to  pay, in case of the death of the person insured, a certain sum for the  benefit of his family, or of some other person named in the policy. The  word _policy_ as here used, means the writing containing the terms or  conditions on which the company agrees to indemnify the person insured  in case of loss. The money paid to obtain insurance, is called  _premium_.    Sec.12. The profits of the stockholders consist of the excess of money  received for premiums over the amount paid out for losses. Thus, if a  company has issued 2,000 policies, each covering property of an average  amount of $1,000, the amount of risk is $2,000,000; and if the rate of  insurance is one per cent., the amount received in premiums is $20,000.  Hence, if none of the 2,000 buildings is burned within the time the  insurance is to run, the $20,000 are gained. If ten of them should be  burned, there would still be a gain of $10,000. If twenty should be  destroyed, there would be no gain, but an actual loss to the amount of  the expenses of the concern.    Sec.13. But from the average number and amount of losses annually for many  years, companies are enabled so to fix the rates of insurance as to give  the stockholders a fair profit on their capital. The rates are not the  same on all kinds of property; a higher per centage is charged on that  which is deemed hazardous, or more exposed to fire, than on that which  is less exposed. The profits on the business of the company, or the  _dividends_, as they are called, are annually or semi-annually divided  among the stockholders, in proportion to the amount of their respective  shares.    Sec.14. There is another kind of insurance companies, which differ  materially from the _stock_ companies described in the preceding  sections. They are _mutual_ insurance companies. They are so called  because the members unite "]]]
