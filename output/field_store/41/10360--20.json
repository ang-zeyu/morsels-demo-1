The only reply he gave was to exclaim, \"This  is the day of the victory of Zama. Let us give thanks to the gods for  it;\" and he led all that was noble and good in Rome with him to the  temple of Jupiter and offered the anniversary sacrifice. No one durst  say another word against him or his brother; but he did not choose to  remain among the citizens who had thus insulted him, but went away to  his estate at Liternum, and when he died, desired to be buried there,  saying that he would not even leave his bones to his ungrateful country.  The Cornelian family was the only one among the higher Romans who buried  instead of burning their dead. He left no son, only a daughter, who was  married to Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, a brave officer who was among  those who were sent to finish reducing Spain. It was a long, terrible  war, fought city by city, inch by inch; but Gracchus is said to have  taken no less than three hundred fortresses. But he was a milder  conqueror than some of the Romans, and tried to tame and civilize the  wild races instead of treating them with the terrible severity shown by  Marcus Porcius Cato, the sternest of all old Romans. However, by the  year 178 Spain had been reduced to obedience, and the cities and the  coast were in good order, though the mountains harbored fierce tribes  always ready for revolt.    Gracchus died early, and Cornelia, his widow, devoted herself to the  cause of his three children, refusing to be married again, which was  very uncommon in a Roman lady. When a lady asked her to show her her  ornaments, she called her two boys, Tiberius and Caius, and their sister  Sempronia, and said, \"These are my jewels;\" and when she was  complimented on being the daughter of Africanus, she said that the  honor she should care more for was the being called \"the mother of the  Gracchi.\"    It was not, however, one of her sons that was chosen to carry on their  grandfather's name and the sacrifices of the Cornelian family. Probably  Caius was not born when Scipio died, for his choice had been the second  son of his sister and of Lucius AEmilius Paulus (son of him who died at  Cannae.) This child being adopted by his uncle, was called Publius  Cornelius Scipio AEmilianus, and when he grew up was to marry his cousin  Sempronia.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER XXI.    THE CONQUEST OF GREECE, CORINTH, AND CARTHAGE.    179--145.      It was a great change when Rome, which to the Greeks of Pyrrhus' time  had seemed so rude and simple, was thought such a school of policy that  Greek and half-Greek kings sent their sons to be educated there, partly  as hostages for their own peaceableness, and partly to learn the spirit  of Roman rule. The first king who did this was Philip of Macedon, who  sent his son Demetrius to be brought up at Rome; but when he came back,  his father and brother were jealous of him, and he was soon put to  death.    When his brother Perseus came to the throne, there was hatred between  him and the Romans, and ere long he was accused of making war on their  allies. He offered to make peace, but they replied that they would hear  nothing till he had laid down his arms, and this he would not do, so  that Lucius AEmilius Paulus (the brother-in-law of Scipio) was sent to  reduce him. As AEmilius came into his own house after receiving the  appointment, he met his little daughter crying, and when he asked her  what was the matter, she answered, \"Oh, father, Perseus is dead!\" She  meant her little dog, but he kissed her and thanked her for the good  omen. He overran Macedon, and gained the great battle of Pydna, after  which Perseus was obliged to give himself up into the hands of the  Romans, begging, however, not to be made to walk in AEmilius' triumph.  The general answered that he might obtain that favor from himself,  meaning that he could die by his own hand; but Perseus did not take the  hint, which seems to us far more shocking than it did to a Roman; he did  walk in the triumph, and died a few years after in Italy. AEmilius' two  sons were with him throughout this campaign, though still boys under  Polybius, their Achaian tutor. Macedon was divided into four provinces,  and became entirely subject to Rome.    [Illustration: CORINTH.]    The Greeks of the Achaian League began to have quarrels among  themselves, and when the Romans interfered a fierce spirit broke out,  and they wanted to have their old freedom, forgetting how entirely  unable they were to stand against the power of the Romans. Caius  Caecilius Metellus, a man of one of the best and most gracious Roman  families, was patient with them and did his best to pacify them, being  most unwilling to ruin the noble old historical cities; but these  foolish Greeks fancied that his kindness showed weakness, and forced on  the war, sending a troop to guard the pass of Thermopylae, but they were  swept away. Unfortunately, Metellus had to go out of office, and Lucius  Mummius, a fierce, rude, and ignorant soldier, came in his stead to  complete the conquest. Corinth was taken, utterly ruined and plundered  throughout, and a huge amount of treasure was sent to Rome, as well as  pictures and statues famed all over the world. Mummius was very much  laughed at for having been told they must be carried in his triumph; and  yet, not understanding their beauty, he told the sailors to whose charge  they were given, that if they were lost, new ones must be supplied.  However, he was an honest man, who did not help himself out of the  plunder, as far too many were doing. After that, Achaia was made a Roman  province.    At this time the third and last Punic war was going on. The old Moorish  king, Massinissa, had been continually tormenting Carthage ever since  she had been weak, and declaring that Phoenician strangers had no  business in Africa. The Carthaginians, who had no means of defending  themselves, complained; but the Romans would not listen, hoping,  perhaps, that they would be goaded at last into attacking the Moor, and  thus giving a pretext for a war. Old Marcus Porcius Cato, who was sent  on a message to Carthage, came back declaring that it was not safe to  let so mighty a city of enemies stand so near. He brought back a branch  of figs fresh and good, which he showed the Senate in proof of how near  she was, and ended each sentence with saying, \"_Delenda est Carthago_\"  (Carthage is to be wiped out). He died that same year at ninety years  old, having spent most of his life in making a staunch resistance to the  easy and luxurious fashions that were coming in with wealth and  refinement. One of his sayings always deserves to be remembered. When he  was opposing a law giving permission to the ladies to wear gold and  purple, he said they would all be vying with one another, and that the  poor would be ashamed of not making as good an appearance as the rich.  \"And,\" said he, \"she who blushes for doing what she ought, will soon  cease to blush for doing what she ought not.\"    One wonders he did not see that to have no enemy near at hand to guard  against was the very worst thing for the hardy, plain old ways he was so  anxious to keep up. However, Carthage was to be wiped out, and Scipio  AEmilianus was sent to do the terrible work. He defeated Hasdrubal, the  last of the Carthaginian generals, and took the citadel of Byrsa; but  though all hope was over, the city held out in utter desperation.  Weapons were forged out of household implements, even out of gold and  silver, and the women twisted their long hair into bow-strings; and when  the walls were stormed, they fought from street to street and house to  house, so that the Romans gained little but ruins and dead bodies.  Carthage and Corinth fell on the same day of the year 179.    Part of Spain still had to be subdued, and Scipio AEmilianus was sent  thither. The city of Numantia, with only 5000 inhabitants, endured one  of those long, hopeless sieges for which Spanish cities have in all  times been remarkable, and was only taken at last when almost every  citizen had perished.    At the same time, Attalus, king of Pergamus in Asia Minor, being the  last of his race, bequeathed his dominions to the Romans, and thus gave  them their first solid footing there.    All this was altering Roman manners much. Weak as the Greeks were, their  old doings of every kind were still the admiration of every one, and the  Romans, who had always been rough, straightforward doers, began to wish  to learn of them to think. All the wealthier families had Greeks for  tutors for their sons, and expected them to talk and write the language,  and study the philosophy and poetry till they should be as familiar with  it as if they were Greeks themselves. Unluckily, the Greeks themselves  had fallen from their earnestness and greatness, so that there was not  much to be learnt of them now but vain deceit and bad taste.    Rich Romans, too, began to get most absurdly luxurious. They had  splendid villas on the Italian hill-sides, where they went to spend the  summer when Rome was unhealthy, and where they had beautiful gardens,  with courts paved with mosaic, and fish-ponds for the pet fish for which  many had a passion. One man was laughed at for having shed tears when  his favorite fish died, and he retorted by saying that it was more than  his accuser had done for his wife.    Their feasts were as luxurious as they could make them, in spite of laws  to keep them within bounds. Dishes of nightingales' tongues, of fatted  dormice, and even of snails, were among their food: and sometimes a  stream was made to flow along the table, containing the living companion  of the mullet which served as part of the meal.          CHAPTER XXII.    THE GRACCHI.    137-122.      Young Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, the eldest of Cornelia's jewels, was  sent in the year 137 to join the Roman army in Spain. As he went through"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16672"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#17)"],[1,", and I told him that his decision was the best piece of  news I had heard in the country: he was evidently pleased with my  approbation, and, turning to his people, asked if they heard what I  said. He repeated my remark, and said, \"You silly fellows think me  wrong in returning the captives, but all wise men will approve of it,\"  and he then scolded them roundly.    I was accidentally spectator of this party going back, for on going  out of the town I saw a meat market opened, and people buying with  maize and meal. On inquiring, I was told that the people and cattle  there were the Nyassas, and they had slaughtered an ox, in order to  exchange meat for grain as provisions on the journey. The women and  children numbered fifty-four, and about a dozen boys were engaged in  milking the cows: the cattle were from twenty-five to thirty head.    The change from hard and scanty fare caused illness in several of our  party. I had tasted no animal food except what turtle-doves and  guinea-fowls could be shot since we passed Matawatawa,--true, a fowl  was given by Mtende. The last march was remarkable for the scarcity of  birds, so eight days were spent on porridge and rice without relish.    I gave Mataka a trinket, to be kept in remembrance of his having sent  back the Nyassa people: he replied that he would always act in a  similar manner. As it was a spontaneous act, it was all the more  valuable.    The sepoys have become quite intolerable, and if I cannot get rid of  them we shall all starve before we accomplish what we wish. They  dawdle behind picking up wild fruits, and over our last march (which  we accomplished on the morning of the eighth day) they took from  fourteen to twenty-two days. Retaining their brutal feelings to the  last they killed the donkey which I lent to the havildar to carry his  things, by striking it on the head when in boggy places into which  they had senselessly driven it loaded; then the havildar came on (his  men pretending they could go no further from weakness), and killed the  young buffalo and eat it when they thought they could hatch up a  plausible story. They said it had died, and tigers came and devoured  it--they saw them. \"Did you see the stripes of the tiger?\" said I. All  declared that they saw the stripes distinctly. This gave us an idea of  their truthfulness, as there is no striped tiger in all Africa. All  who resolved on skulking or other bad behaviour invariably took up  with the sepoys; their talk seemed to suit evil-doers, and they were  such a disreputable-looking lot that I was quite ashamed of them. The  havildar had no authority, and all bore the sulky dogged look of  people going where they were forced but hated to go. This hang-dog  expression of countenance was so conspicuous that I many a time have  heard the country people remark, \"These are the slaves of the party.\"  They have neither spirit nor pluck as compared with the Africans, and  if one saw a village he turned out of the way to beg in the most  abject manner, or lay down and slept, the only excuse afterwards  being, \"My legs were sore.\" Having allowed some of them to sleep at  the fire in my house, they began a wholesale plunder of everything  they could sell, as cartridges, cloths, and meat, so I had to eject  them. One of them then threatened to shoot my interpreter Simon if he  got him in a quiet place away from the English power. As this threat  had been uttered three times, and I suspect that something of the kind  had prevented the havildar exerting his authority, I resolved to get  rid of them by sending them back to the coast by the first trader. It  is likely that some sympathizers will take their part, but I strove to  make them useful. They had but poor and scanty fare in a part of the  way, but all of us suffered alike. They made themselves thoroughly  disliked by their foul talk and abuse, and if anything tended more  than another to show me that theirs was a moral unfitness for travel,  it was the briskness assumed when they knew they were going back to  the coast. I felt inclined to force them on, but it would have been  acting from revenge, and to pay them out, so I forbore. I gave Mataka  forty-eight yards of calico, and to the sepoys eighteen yards, and  arranged that he should give them food till Suleiman, a respectable  trader, should arrive. He was expected every day, and we passed him  near the town. If they chose to go and get their luggage, it was of  course all safe for them behind. The havildar begged still to go on  with me, and I consented, though he is a drag on the party, but he  will count in any difficulty.    Abraham recognised his uncle among the crowds who came to see us. On  making himself known he found that his mother and two sisters had been  sold to the Arabs after he had been enslaved. The uncle pressed him to  remain, and Mataka urged, and so did another uncle, but in vain. I  added my voice, and could have given him goods to keep him afloat a  good while, but he invariably replied, \"How can I stop where I have no  mother and no sister?\" The affection seems to go to the maternal side.  I suggested that he might come after he had married a wife, but I fear  very much that unless some European would settle, none of these  Nassick boys will come to this country. It would be decidedly better  if they were taught agriculture in the simplest form, as the Indian.  Mataka would have liked to put his oxen to use, but Abraham could not  help him with that. He is a smith, or rather a nothing, for unless he  could smelt iron he would be entirely without materials to work with.    _14th-28th July, 1866._--One day, calling at Mataka's, I found as  usual a large crowd of idlers, who always respond with a laugh to  everything he utters as wit. He asked, if he went to Bombay what ought  he to take to secure some gold? I replied, \"Ivory,\" he rejoined,  \"Would slaves not be a good speculation?\" I replied that, \"if he took  slaves there for sale, they would put him in prison.\" The idea of the  great Mataka in \"chokee\" made him wince, and the laugh turned for once  against him. He said that as all the people from the coast crowd to  him, they ought to give him something handsome for being here to  supply their wants. I replied, if he would fill the fine well-watered  country we had passed over with people instead of sending them off to  Kilwa, he would confer a benefit on visitors, but we had been starved  on the way to him; and I then told him what the English would do in  road-making in a fine country like this. This led us to talk of  railways, ships, ploughing with oxen--the last idea struck him most. I  told him that I should have liked some of the Nassick boys to remain  and teach this and other things, but they might be afraid to venture  lest they should be sold again. The men who listened never heard such  decided protests against selling each other into slavery before!    The idea of guilt probably floated but vaguely in their minds, but  the loss of life we have witnessed (in the guilt of which the sellers  as well as the buyers participate) comes home very forcibly to their  minds.    Mataka has been an active hand in slave wars himself, though now he  wishes to settle down in quiet. The Waiyau generally are still the  most active agents the slave-traders have. The caravan leaders from  Kilwa arrive at a Waiyau village, show the goods they have brought,  are treated liberally by the elders, and told to wait and enjoy  themselves, slaves enough to purchase all will be procured: then a  foray is made against the Manganja, who have few or no guns. The  Waiyau who come against them are abundantly supplied with both by  their coast guests. Several of the low coast Arabs, who differ in  nothing from the Waiyau, usually accompany the foray, and do business  on their own account: this is the usual way in which a safari is  furnished with slaves.    Makanjela, a Waiyau chief about a third of the way from Mtende's to  Mataka, has lost the friendship of all his neighbours by kidnapping  and selling their people; if any of Mataka's people are found in the  district between Makanjela and Moembe, they are considered fair game  and sold. Makanjela's people cannot piss Mataka to go to the Manganja,  so they do what they can by kidnapping and plundering all who fall  into their hands.    When I employed two of Mataka's people to go back on the 14th with  food to the havildar and sepoys, they went a little way and relieved  some, but would not venture as far as the Luatize, for fear of losing  their liberty by Makanjela's people. I could not get the people of the  country to go back; nor could I ask the Nassick boys, who had been  threatened by the sepoys with assassination,--and it was the same with  the Johanna men, because, though Mahometans, the sepoys had called  them Caffirs, &c., and they all declared, \"We are ready to do  anything for you, but we will do nothing for these Hindis.\" I sent  back a sepoy, giving him provisions; he sat down in the first village,  ate all the food, and returned.    An immense tract of country lies uninhabited. To the north-east of  Moembe we have at least fifty miles of as fine land as can be seen  anywhere, still bearing all the marks of having once supported a  prodigious iron-smelting and grain-growing population. The clay pipes  which are put on the nozzles of their bellows and inserted into the  furnace are met with everywhere--often vitrified. Then the ridges on  which they planted maize, beans, cassava, and sorghum, and which they  find necessary to drain off the too abundant moisture of the rains,  still remain unlevelled to attest the industry of the former  inhabitants; the soil being clayey, resists for a long time the  influence of the weather. These ridges are very regular, for in  crossing the old fields, as the path often compels us to do, one foot  treads regularly on the ridge, and the other in the hollow, for a  considerable "]]]
