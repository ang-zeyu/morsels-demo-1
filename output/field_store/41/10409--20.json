After her father's death, she acquired a distaste of everything in  life, including her art.  She went through the CONSERVATOIRE like a  poor soulless singing-machine.  And, suddenly, she awoke as though  through the intervention of a god.  The Angel of Music appeared upon  the scene!  She sang Margarita in FAUST and triumphed! ...    The Angel of Music! ... For three months the Angel of Music had been  giving Christine lessons ...  Ah, he was a punctual singing-master! ...  And now he was taking her for drives in the Bois! ...    Raoul's fingers clutched at his flesh, above his jealous heart.  In his  inexperience, he now asked himself with terror what game the girl was  playing?  Up to what point could an opera-singer make a fool of a  good-natured young man, quite new to love?  O misery! ...    Thus did Raoul's thoughts fly from one extreme to the other.  He no  longer knew whether to pity Christine or to curse her; and he pitied  and cursed her turn and turn about.  At all events, he bought a white  domino.    The hour of the appointment came at last.  With his face in a mask  trimmed with long, thick lace, looking like a pierrot in his white  wrap, the viscount thought himself very ridiculous.  Men of the world  do not go to the Opera ball in fancy-dress! It was absurd.  One  thought, however, consoled the viscount:  he would certainly never be  recognized!    This ball was an exceptional affair, given some time before Shrovetide,  in honor of the anniversary of the birth of a famous draftsman; and it  was expected to be much gayer, noisier, more Bohemian than the ordinary  masked ball.  Numbers of artists had arranged to go, accompanied by a  whole cohort of models and pupils, who, by midnight, began to create a  tremendous din.  Raoul climbed the grand staircase at five minutes to  twelve, did not linger to look at the motley dresses displayed all the  way up the marble steps, one of the richest settings in the world,  allowed no facetious mask to draw him into a war of wits, replied to no  jests and shook off the bold familiarity of a number of couples who had  already become a trifle too gay.  Crossing the big crush-room and  escaping from a mad whirl of dancers in which he was caught for a  moment, he at last entered the room mentioned in Christine's letter.  He found it crammed; for this small space was the point where all those  who were going to supper in the Rotunda crossed those who were  returning from taking a glass of champagne.  The fun, here, waxed fast  and furious.    Raoul leaned against a door-post and waited.  He did not wait long.  A  black domino passed and gave a quick squeeze to the tips of his  fingers.  He understood that it was she and followed her:    \"Is that you, Christine?\" he asked, between his teeth.    The black domino turned round promptly and raised her finger to her  lips, no doubt to warn him not to mention her name again.  Raoul  continued to follow her in silence.    He was afraid of losing her, after meeting her again in such strange  circumstances.  His grudge against her was gone.  He no longer doubted  that she had \"nothing to reproach herself with,\" however peculiar and  inexplicable her conduct might seem.  He was ready to make any display  of clemency, forgiveness or cowardice.  He was in love.  And, no doubt,  he would soon receive a very natural explanation of her curious absence.    The black domino turned back from time to time to see if the white  domino was still following.    As Raoul once more passed through the great crush-room, this time in  the wake of his guide, he could not help noticing a group crowding  round a person whose disguise, eccentric air and gruesome appearance  were causing a sensation.  It was a man dressed all in scarlet, with a  huge hat and feathers on the top of a wonderful death's head.  From his  shoulders hung an immense red-velvet cloak, which trailed along the  floor like a king's train; and on this cloak was embroidered, in gold  letters, which every one read and repeated aloud, \"Don't touch me!  I  am Red Death stalking abroad!\"    Then one, greatly daring, did try to touch him ... but a skeleton hand  shot out of a crimson sleeve and violently seized the rash one's wrist;  and he, feeling the clutch of the knucklebones, the furious grasp of  Death, uttered a cry of pain and terror.  When Red Death released him  at last, he ran away like a very madman, pursued by the jeers of the  bystanders.    It was at this moment that Raoul passed in front of the funereal  masquerader, who had just happened to turn in his direction.  And he  nearly exclaimed:    \"The death's head of Perros-Guirec!\"    He had recognized him! ... He wanted to dart forward, forgetting  Christine; but the black domino, who also seemed a prey to some strange  excitement, caught him by the arm and dragged him from the crush-room,  far from the mad crowd through which Red Death was stalking...    The black domino kept on turning back and, apparently, on two occasions  saw something that startled her, for she hurried her pace and Raoul's  as though they were being pursued.    They went up two floors.  Here, the stairs and corridors were almost  deserted.  The black domino opened the door of a private box and  beckoned to the white domino to follow her.  Then Christine, whom he  recognized by the sound of her voice, closed the door behind them and  warned him, in a whisper, to remain at the back of the box and on no  account to show himself.  Raoul took off his mask.  Christine kept hers  on.  And, when Raoul was about to ask her to remove it, he was  surprised to see her put her ear to the partition and listen eagerly  for a sound outside.  Then she opened the door ajar, looked out into  the corridor and, in a low voice, said:    \"He must have gone up higher.\"  Suddenly she exclaimed:  \"He is coming  down again!\"    She tried to close the door, but Raoul prevented her; for he had seen,  on the top step of the staircase that led to the floor above, A RED  FOOT, followed by another ... and slowly, majestically, the whole  scarlet dress of Red Death met his eyes.  And he once more saw the  death's head of Perros-Guirec.    \"It's he!\" he exclaimed.  \"This time, he shall not escape me! ...\"    But Christian{sic} had slammed the door at the moment when Raoul was on  the point of rushing out.  He tried to push her aside.    \"Whom do you mean by 'he'?\" she asked, in a changed voice.  \"Who shall  not escape you?\"    Raoul tried to overcome the girl's resistance by force, but she  repelled him with a strength which he would not have suspected in her.  He understood, or thought he understood, and at once lost his temper.    \"Who?\" he repeated angrily.  \"Why, he, the man who hides behind that  hideous mask of death! ... The evil genius of the churchyard at Perros!  ... Red Death! ... In a word, madam, your friend ...  your Angel of  Music! ... But I shall snatch off his mask, as I shall snatch off my  own; and, this time, we shall look each other in the face, he and I,  with no veil and no lies between us; and I shall know whom you love and  who loves you!\"    He burst into a mad laugh, while Christine gave a disconsolate moan  behind her velvet mask.  With a tragic gesture, she flung out her two  arms, which fixed a barrier of white flesh against the door.    \"In the name of our love, Raoul, you shall not pass! ...\"    He stopped.  What had she said? ... In the name of their love? ...  Never before had she confessed that she loved him.  And yet she had had  opportunities enough ...  Pooh, her only object was to gain a few  seconds! ... She wished to give the Red Death time to escape ...  And,  in accents of childish hatred, he said:    \"You lie, madam, for you do not love me and you have never loved me!  What a poor fellow I must be to let you mock and flout me as you have  done!  Why did you give me every reason for hope, at Perros ...  for  honest hope, madam, for I am an honest man and I believed you to be an  honest woman, when your only intention was to deceive me!  Alas, you  have deceived us all!  You have taken a shameful advantage of the  candid affection of your benefactress herself, who continues to believe  in your sincerity while you go about the Opera ball with Red Death! ...  I despise you! ...\"    And he burst into tears.  She allowed him to insult her.  She thought  of but one thing, to keep him from leaving the box.    \"You will beg my pardon, one day, for all those ugly words, Raoul, and  when you do I shall forgive you!\"    He shook his head.  \"No, no, you have driven me mad!  When I think that  I had only one object in life:  to give my name to an opera wench!\"    \"Raoul! ... How can you?\"    \"I shall die of shame!\"    \"No, dear, live!\" said Christine's grave and changed voice.  \"And ...  good-by. Good-by, Raoul ...\"    The boy stepped forward, staggering as he went.  He risked one more  sarcasm:    \"Oh, you must let me come and applaud you from time to time!\"    \"I shall never sing again, Raoul! ...\"    \"Really?\" he replied, still more satirically.  \"So he is taking you off  the stage:  I congratulate you! ... But we shall meet in the Bois, one  of these evenings!\"    \"Not in the Bois nor anywhere, Raoul:  you shall not see me again ...\"    \"May one ask at least to what darkness you are returning? ... For what  hell are you leaving, mysterious lady ... or for what paradise?\"    \"I came to tell you, dear, but I can't tell you now ... you would not  believe me!  You have lost faith in me, Raoul; it is finished!\"    She spoke in such a despairing voice that the lad began to feel remorse  for his cruelty.    \"But look here!\" he cried.  \"Can't you tell me what all this means!  ...  You are free, there is no one to interfere with you...  You go  about Paris ...  You put on a domino to come to the ball...  Why do you  not go home? ... What have you been doing this past fortnight?"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17530"],[0,"Maida's Little Shop (#17)"],[1,"of some great bird.    \"It's one-session, Maida,\" he said jubilantly, \"did you hear the  bell?\"    \"What's one session, Dicky?\" Maida asked.    \"Why, when it's too stormy for the children to go to school in the  afternoon the fire-bells ring twenty-two at quarter to twelve. They  keep all the classes in until one o'clock though.\"    \"Oh, that's why they don't come out,\" Maida said.    At one o'clock the umbrellas began to file out of the school door.  The street looked as if it had grown a monster crop of shiny black  toad-stools. But it was the only sign of life that the neighborhood  showed for the rest of the day. The storm was too violent for even  the big boys and girls to brave. A very long afternoon went by. Not  a customer came into the shop. Maida felt very lonely. She wandered  from shop to living-room and from living-room to chamber. She tried  to read. She sewed a little. She even popped corn for a lonesome  fifteen minutes. But it seemed as if the long dark day would never  go.    As they were sitting down to dinner that night, Billy bounced in--his  face pink and wet, his eyes sparkling like diamonds from his  conflict with the winds.    \"Oh, Billy, how glad I am to see you,\" Maida said. \"It's been the  lonesomest day.\"    \"Sure, the sight av ye's grand for sore eyes,\" said Granny.    Maida had noticed that Billy's appearance always made the greatest  difference in everything. Before he came, the noise of the wind  howling about the store made Maida sad. Now it seemed the jolliest  of sounds. And when at seven, Rosie appeared, Maida's cup of  happiness brimmed over.    While Billy talked with Granny, the two little girls rearranged the  stock.    \"My mother was awful mad with me just before supper,\" Rosie began at  once. \"It seems as if she was so cross lately that there's no living  with her. She picks on me all the time. That's why I'm here. She  sent me to bed. But I made up my mind I wouldn't go to bed. I  climbed out my bedroom window and came over here.\"    \"Oh, Rosie, I wish you wouldn't do that,\" Maida said. \"Oh, do run  right home! Think how worried your mother would be if she went up  into your room and found you gone. She wouldn't know what had become  of you.\"    \"Well, then, what makes her so strict with me?\" Rosie cried. Her  eyes had grown as black as thunder clouds. The scowl that made her  face so sullen had come deep between her eyebrows.    \"Oh, how I wish I had a mother,\" Maida said longingly. \"I guess I  wouldn't say a word to her, no matter how strict she was.\"    \"I guess you don't know what you'd do until you tried it,\" Rosie  said.    Granny and Billy had been curiously quiet in the other room.  Suddenly Billy Potter stepped to the door.    \"I've just thought of a great game, children,\" he said. \"But we've  got to play it in the kitchen. Bring some crayons, Maida.\"    The children raced after him. \"What is it?\" they asked in chorus.    Billy did not answer. He lifted Granny's easy-chair with Granny,  knitting and all, and placed it in front of the kitchen stove. Then  he began to draw a huge rectangle on the clean, stone floor.    \"Guess,\" he said.    \"Sure and Oi know what ut's going to be,\" smiled Granny.    Maida and Rosie watched him closely. Suddenly they both shouted  together:    \"Hopscotch! Hopscotch!\"    \"Right you are!\" Billy approved. He searched among the coals in the  hod until he found a hard piece of slate.    \"All ready now!\" he said briskly. \"Your turn, first, Rosie, because  you're company.\"    Rosie failed on \"fivesy.\" Maida's turn came next and she failed on  \"threesy.\" Billy followed Maida but he hopped on the line on  \"twosy.\"    \"Oi belave Oi cud play that game, ould as Oi am,\" Granny said  suddenly.    \"I bet you could,\" Billy said.    \"Sure, 'twas a foine player Oi was when Oi was a little colleen.\"    \"Come on, Granny,\" Billy said.    The two little girls jumped up and down, clapping their hands and  shrieking, \"Granny's going to play!\" \"Granny's going to play!\" They  made so much noise finally, that Billy had to threaten to stand them  on their heads in a corner.    Granny took her turn after Billy. She hopped about like a very  active and a very benevolent old fairy.    \"Oh, doesn't she look like the Dame in fairy tales?\" Maida said.    They played for a half an hour. And who do you suppose won? Not  Maida with all her new-found strength, not Rosie with all her  nervous energy, not Billy with all his athletic training.    \"Mrs. Delia Flynn, champion of America and Ireland,\" Billy greeted  the victor. \"Granny, we'll have to enter you in the next Olympic  games.\"    They returned after this breathless work to the living-room.    \"Now I'm going to tell you a story,\" Billy announced.    \"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" Maida squealed. \"Do! Billy tells the most wonderful  stories, Rosie--stories he's heard and stories he's read. But the  most wonderful ones are those that he makes up as he goes along.\"    The two little girls settled themselves on the hearth-rug at Billy's  feet. Granny sat, not far off, working with double speed at her  neglected knitting.    \"Once upon a time,\" Billy said, \"there lived a little girl named  Klara. And Klara was the naughtiest little girl in the world. She  was a pretty child and a clever child and everybody would have loved  her if she had only given them a chance. But how can you love a  child who is doing naughty things all the time? Particularly was she  a great trial to her mother. That poor lady was not well and needed  care and attention, herself. But instead of giving her these, Klara  gave her only hard words and disobedient acts. The mother used  sometimes to punish her little daughter but it seemed as if this  only made her worse. Both father and mother were in despair about  her. Klara seemed to be growing steadily worse and worse. And,  indeed, lately, she had added to her naughtiness by threatening to  run away.    \"One night, it happened, Klara had been so bad that her mother had  put her to bed early. The moment her mother left the room, Klara  whipped over to the window. 'I'm going to dress myself and climb out  the window and run away and never come back, she said to herself.'    \"The house in which Klara lived was built on the side of a cliff,  overlooking the sea. As Klara stood there in her nightgown the moon  began to rise and come up out of the water. Now the moonrise is  always a beautiful sight and Klara stopped for a moment to watch it,  fascinated.    \"It seemed to her that she had never seen the moon look so big  before. And certainly she had never seen it such a color--a soft deep  orange. In fact, it might have been an immense orange--or better, a  monster pumpkin stuck on the horizon-line.    \"The strange thing about the moon, though, was that it grew larger  instead of smaller. It rose higher and higher, growing bigger and  bigger, until it was half-way up the curve of the sky. Then it  stopped short. Klara watched it, her eyes bulging out of her head.  In all her experience she had never seen such a surprising thing.  And while she watched, another remarkable thing happened. A great  door in the moon opened suddenly and there on the threshold stood a  little old lady. A strange little old lady she was--a little old lady  with short red skirts and high, gayly-flowered draperies at her  waist, a little old lady with a tall black, sugar-loaf hat, a great  white ruff around her neck and little red shoes with bright silver  buckles on them--a little old lady who carried a black cat perched on  one shoulder and a broomstick in one hand.    \"The little old lady stooped down and lifted something over the  threshold. Klara strained her eyes to see what it was. It looked  like a great roll of golden carpeting. With a sudden deft movement  the little old lady threw it out of the door. It flew straight  across the ocean, unrolling as swiftly as a ball of twine that  you've flung across the room. It came nearer and nearer. The farther  it got from the moon, the faster it unrolled. After a while it  struck against the shore right under Klara's window and Klara saw  that it was the wake of the moon. She watched.    \"The little old lady had disappeared from the doorway in the moon  but the door did not close. And, suddenly, still another wonderful  thing happened. The golden wake lifted itself gradually from the  water until it was on a level with Klara's window. Bending down she  touched it with both her soft little hands. It was as firm and hard  as if it had been woven from strands of gold.    \"'Now's my time to run away from my cross mother,' Klara said to  herself. 'I guess that nice old lady in the moon wants me to come  and be her little girl. Well, I'll go. I guess they'll be sorry in  this house to-morrow when they wake up and find they're never going  to see me again.'    \"Opening the window gently that nobody might hear her, she stepped  on to the Wake of Gold. It felt cool and hard to her little bare  feet. It inclined gently from her window. She ran down the slope  until she reached the edge of the sea. There she hesitated. For a  moment it seemed a daring thing to walk straight out to the moon  with nothing between her and the water but a path of gold. Then she  recalled how her mother had sent her to bed and her heart hardened.  She started briskly out.    \"From Klara's window it had looked as though it would take her only  a few moments to get to the moon. But the farther she went, the  farther from her the doorway seemed to go. But she did not mind that  the walk was so long because it was so pretty. Looking over the edge  of the Wake of Gold, deep down in the water, she could see all kinds  of strange sights.    \"At one place a school of little fish swam up to the surface of the  water. Klara knelt down and watched their pretty, graceful motions.  The longer she gazed the more fish she saw and the more beautiful  they seemed. Pale-blue fishes with silver spots.
