Come,  let us go.\"    Carley rode all that afternoon in the rear of the caravan, gradually  succumbing to the cold raw wind and the aches and pains to which she had  subjected her flesh. Nevertheless, she finished the day's journey, and,  sorely as she needed Glenn's kindly hand, she got off her horse without  aid.    Camp was made at the edge of the devastated timber zone that Carley  had found so dispiriting. A few melancholy pines were standing, and  everywhere, as far as she could see southward, were blackened fallen  trees and stumps. It was a dreary scene. The few cattle grazing on  the bleached grass appeared as melancholy as the pines. The sun shone  fitfully at sunset, and then sank, leaving the land to twilight and  shadows.    Once in a comfortable seat beside the camp fire, Carley had no further  desire to move. She was so far exhausted and weary that she could no  longer appreciate the blessing of rest. Appetite, too, failed her this  meal time. Darkness soon settled down. The wind moaned through the  pines. She was indeed glad to crawl into bed, and not even the thought  of skunks could keep her awake.    Morning disclosed the fact that gray clouds had been blown away. The  sun shone bright upon a white-frosted land. The air was still. Carley  labored at her task of rising, and brushing her hair, and pulling on  her boots; and it appeared her former sufferings were as naught compared  with the pangs of this morning. How she hated the cold, the bleak,  denuded forest land, the emptiness, the roughness, the crudeness! If  this sort of feeling grew any worse she thought she would hate Glenn.  Yet she was nonetheless set upon going on, and seeing the sheep-dip, and  riding that fiendish mustang until the trip was ended.    Getting in the saddle and on the way this morning was an ordeal that  made Carley actually sick. Glenn and Flo both saw how it was with  her, and they left her to herself. Carley was grateful for this  understanding. It seemed to proclaim their respect. She found further  matter for satisfaction in the astonishing circumstance that after  the first dreadful quarter of an hour in the saddle she began to feel  easier. And at the end of several hours of riding she was not suffering  any particular pain, though she was weaker.    At length the cut-over land ended in a forest of straggling pines,  through which the road wound southward, and eventually down into a wide  shallow canyon. Through the trees Carley saw a stream of water, open  fields of green, log fences and cabins, and blue smoke. She heard the  chug of a gasoline engine and the baa-baa of sheep. Glenn waited for  her to catch up with him, and he said: \"Carley, this is one of Hutter's  sheep camps. It's not a--a very pleasant place. You won't care to see  the sheep-dip. So I'm suggesting you wait here--\"    \"Nothing doing, Glenn,\" she interrupted. \"I'm going to see what there is  to see.\"    \"But, dear--the men--the way they handle sheep--they'll--really it's no  sight for you,\" he floundered.    \"Why not?\" she inquired, eying him.    \"Because, Carley--you know how you hate the--the seamy side of things.  And the stench--why, it'll make you sick!\"    \"Glenn, be on the level,\" she said. \"Suppose it does. Wouldn't you think  more of me if I could stand it?\"    \"Why, yes,\" he replied, reluctantly, smiling at her, \"I would. But I  wanted to spare you. This trip has been hard. I'm sure proud of you.  And, Carley--you can overdo it. Spunk is not everything. You simply  couldn't stand this.\"    \"Glenn, how little you know a woman!\" she exclaimed. \"Come along and  show me your old sheep-dip.\"    They rode out of the woods into an open valley that might have been  picturesque if it had not been despoiled by the work of man. A log fence  ran along the edge of open ground and a mud dam held back a pool of  stagnant water, slimy and green. As Carley rode on the baa-baa of sheep  became so loud that she could scarcely hear Glenn talking.    Several log cabins, rough hewn and gray with age, stood down inside the  inclosure; and beyond there were large corrals. From the other side of  these corrals came sounds of rough voices of men, a trampling of hoofs,  heavy splashes, the beat of an engine, and the incessant baaing of the  sheep.    At this point the members of Hutter's party dismounted and tied their  horses to the top log of the fence. When Carley essayed to get off Glenn  tried to stop her, saying she could see well enough from there. But  Carley got down and followed Flo. She heard Hutter call to Glenn: \"Say,  Ryan is short of men. We'll lend a hand for a couple of hours.\"    Presently Carley reached Flo's side and the first corral that contained  sheep. They formed a compact woolly mass, rather white in color, with a  tinge of pink. When Flo climbed up on the fence the flock plunged as  one animal and with a trampling roar ran to the far side of the corral.  Several old rams with wide curling horns faced around; and some of  the ewes climbed up on the densely packed mass. Carley rather enjoyed  watching them. She surely could not see anything amiss in this sight.    The next corral held a like number of sheep, and also several Mexicans  who were evidently driving them into a narrow lane that led farther  down. Carley saw the heads of men above other corral fences, and there  was also a thick yellowish smoke rising from somewhere.    \"Carley, are you game to see the dip?\" asked Flo, with good nature that  yet had a touch of taunt in it.    \"That's my middle name,\" retorted Carley, flippantly.    Both Glenn and this girl seemed to be bent upon bringing out Carley's  worst side, and they were succeeding. Flo laughed. The ready slang  pleased her.    She led Carley along that log fence, through a huge open gate, and  across a wide pen to another fence, which she scaled. Carley followed  her, not particularly overanxious to look ahead. Some thick odor had  begun to reach Carley's delicate nostrils. Flo led down a short lane and  climbed another fence, and sat astride the top log. Carley hurried along  to clamber up to her side, but stood erect with her feet on the second  log of the fence.    Then a horrible stench struck Carley almost like a blow in the face, and  before her confused sight there appeared to be drifting smoke and active  men and running sheep, all against a background of mud. But at first it  was the odor that caused Carley to close her eyes and press her knees  hard against the upper log to keep from reeling. Never in her life had  such a sickening nausea assailed her. It appeared to attack her whole  body. The forerunning qualm of seasickness was as nothing to this.  Carley gave a gasp, pinched her nose between her fingers so she could  not smell, and opened her eyes.    Directly beneath her was a small pen open at one end into which sheep  were being driven from the larger corral. The drivers were yelling. The  sheep in the rear plunged into those ahead of them, forcing them on. Two  men worked in this small pen. One was a brawny giant in undershirt and  overalls that appeared filthy. He held a cloth in his hand and strode  toward the nearest sheep. Folding the cloth round the neck of the sheep,  he dragged it forward, with an ease which showed great strength, and  threw it into a pit that yawned at the side. Souse went the sheep into  a murky, muddy pool and disappeared. But suddenly its head came up and  then its shoulders. And it began half to walk and half swim down what  appeared to be a narrow boxlike ditch that contained other floundering  sheep. Then Carley saw men on each side of this ditch bending over with  poles that had crooks at the end, and their work was to press and pull  the sheep along to the end of the ditch, and drive them up a boarded  incline into another corral where many other sheep huddled, now a dirty  muddy color like the liquid into which they had been emersed. Souse!  Splash! In went sheep after sheep. Occasionally one did not go under.  And then a man would press it under with the crook and quickly lift its  head. The work went on with precision and speed, in spite of the yells  and trampling and baa-baas, and the incessant action that gave an effect  of confusion.    Carley saw a pipe leading from a huge boiler to the ditch. The dark  fluid was running out of it. From a rusty old engine with big smokestack  poured the strangling smoke. A man broke open a sack of yellow powder  and dumped it into the ditch. Then he poured an acid-like liquid after  it.    \"Sulphur and nicotine,\" yelled Flo up at Carley. \"The dip's poison. If  a sheep opens his mouth he's usually a goner. But sometimes they save  one.\"    Carley wanted to tear herself away from this disgusting spectacle. But  it held her by some fascination. She saw Glenn and Hutter fall in line  with the other men, and work like beavers. These two pacemakers in the  small pen kept the sheep coming so fast that every worker below had a  task cut out for him. Suddenly Flo squealed and pointed.    \"There! that sheep didn't come up,\" she cried. \"Shore he opened his  mouth.\"    Then Carley saw Glenn energetically plunge his hooked pole in and out  and around until he had located the submerged sheep. He lifted its  head above the dip. The sheep showed no sign of life. Down on his knees  dropped Glenn, to reach the sheep with strong brown hands, and to haul  it up on the ground, where it flopped inert. Glenn pummeled it and  pressed it, and worked on it much as Carley had seen a life-guard work  over a half-drowned man. But the sheep did not respond to Glenn's active  administrations.    \"No use, Glenn,\" yelled Hutter, hoarsely. \"That one's a goner.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18828"],[0,"Selections From the Writings of the Báb (#17)"],[1,"He willeth, and hath not revealed nor will He reveal  them save through the Focal Point of God's Primal Will. He it is, through  Whose dispensations divine Messengers are raised up and heavenly Books are  sent down. Had human beings been able to accomplish this deed surely  someone would have brought forth at least one verse during the period of  twelve hundred and seventy years which hath elapsed since the revelation  of the Qur'an until that of the Bayan. However, all men have proved  themselves impotent and have utterly failed to do so, although they  endeavoured, with their vehement might, to quench the flame of the Word of  God. II, 1.          \"Thou beholdest how vast is the number of people who ...\"      Thou beholdest how vast is the number of people who go to Mecca each year  on pilgrimage and engage in circumambulation, while He, through the  potency of Whose Word the Ka'bah [the sanctuary in Mecca] hath become the  object of adoration, is forsaken in this mountain. He is none other but  the Apostle of God Himself, inasmuch as the Revelation of God may be  likened to the sun. No matter how innumerable its risings, there is but  one sun, and upon it depends the life of all things. It is clear and  evident that the object of all preceding Dispensations hath been to pave  the way for the advent of Muhammad, the Apostle of God. These, including  the Muhammadan Dispensation, have had, in their turn, as their objective  the Revelation proclaimed by the Qa'im. The purpose underlying this  Revelation, as well as those that preceded it, has, in like manner, been  to announce the advent of the Faith of Him Whom God will make manifest.  And this Faith--the Faith of Him Whom God will make manifest--in its turn,  together with all the Revelations gone before it, have as their object the  Manifestation destined to succeed it. And the latter, no less than all the  Revelations preceding it, prepare the way for the Revelation which is yet  to follow. The process of the rise and setting of the Sun of Truth will  thus indefinitely continue--a process that hath had no beginning and will  have no end.    Well is it with him who in every Dispensation recognizeth the Purpose of  God for that Dispensation, and is not deprived therefrom by turning his  gaze towards the things of the past. IV, 12.          \"The substance of this chapter is this, that what is intended ...\"      The substance of this chapter is this, that what is intended by the Day of  Resurrection is the Day of the appearance of the Tree of divine Reality,  but it is not seen that any one of the followers of _Sh_i'ih Islam hath  understood the meaning of the Day of Resurrection; rather have they  fancifully imagined a thing which with God hath no reality. In the  estimation of God and according to the usage of such as are initiated into  divine mysteries, what is meant by the Day of Resurrection is this, that  from the time of the appearance of Him Who is the Tree of divine Reality,  at whatever period and under whatever name, until the moment of His  disappearance, is the Day of Resurrection.    For example, from the inception of the mission of Jesus--may peace be upon  Him--till the day of His ascension was the Resurrection of Moses. For  during that period the Revelation of God shone forth through the  appearance of that divine Reality, Who rewarded by His Word everyone who  believed in Moses, and punished by His Word everyone who did not believe;  inasmuch as God's Testimony for that Day was that which He had solemnly  affirmed in the Gospel. And from the inception of the Revelation of the  Apostle of God--may the blessings of God be upon Him--till the day of His  ascension was the Resurrection of Jesus--peace be upon Him--wherein the Tree  of divine Reality appeared in the person of Muhammad, rewarding by His  Word everyone who was a believer in Jesus, and punishing by His Word  everyone who was not a believer in Him. And from the moment when the Tree  of the Bayan appeared until it disappeareth is the Resurrection of the  Apostle of God, as is divinely foretold in the Qur'an; the beginning of  which was when two hours and eleven minutes had passed on the eve of the  fifth of Jamadiyu'l-Avval, 1260 A.H.,(66) which is the year 1270 of the  Declaration of the Mission of Muhammad. This was the beginning of the Day  of Resurrection of the Qur'an, and until the disappearance of the Tree of  divine Reality is the Resurrection of the Qur'an. The stage of perfection  of everything is reached when its resurrection occurreth. The perfection  of the religion of Islam was consummated at the beginning of this  Revelation; and from the rise of this Revelation until its setting, the  fruits of the Tree of Islam, whatever they are, will become apparent. The  Resurrection of the Bayan will occur at the time of the appearance of Him  Whom God shall make manifest. For today the Bayan is in the stage of seed;  at the beginning of the manifestation of Him Whom God shall make manifest  its ultimate perfection will become apparent. He is made manifest in order  to gather the fruits of the trees He hath planted; even as the Revelation  of the Qa'im [He Who ariseth], a descendant of Muhammad--may the blessings  of God rest upon Him--is exactly like unto the Revelation of the Apostle of  God Himself [Muhammad]. He appeareth not, save for the purpose of  gathering the fruits of Islam from the Qur'anic verses which He [Muhammad]  hath sown in the hearts of men. The fruits of Islam cannot be gathered  except through allegiance unto Him [the Qa'im] and by believing in Him. At  the present time, however, only adverse effects have resulted; for  although He hath appeared in the midmost heart of Islam, and all people  profess it by reason of their relationship to Him [the Qa'im], yet  unjustly have they consigned Him to the Mountain of Maku, and this  notwithstanding that in the Qur'an the advent of the Day of Resurrection  hath been promised unto all by God. For on that Day all men will be  brought before God and will attain His Presence; which meaneth appearance  before Him Who is the Tree of divine Reality and attainment unto His  presence; inasmuch as it is not possible to appear before the Most Holy  Essence of God, nor is it conceivable to seek reunion with Him. That which  is feasible in the matter of appearance before Him and of meeting Him is  attainment unto the Primal Tree. II, 7.          \"The evidence set forth by God can never be compared ...\"      The evidence set forth by God can never be compared with the evidences  produced by any one of the peoples and kindreds of the earth; and beyond a  shadow of doubt no evidence is set forth by God save through the One Who  is appointed as His supreme Testimony. Moreover, the proof of revealed  verses doth, alone and of itself, conclusively demonstrate the utter  impotence of all created things on earth, for this is a proof which hath  proceeded from God and shall endure until the Day of Resurrection.    And if anyone should reflect on the appearance of this Tree, he will  undoubtedly testify to the loftiness of the Cause of God. For if one from  whose life only twenty-four years have passed, and who is devoid of those  sciences wherein all are learned, now reciteth verses after such fashion  without thought or hesitation, writes a thousand verses of prayer in the  course of five hours without pause of the pen, and produceth commentaries  and learned treatises on such lofty themes as the true understanding of  God and of the oneness of His Being, in a manner which doctors and  philosophers confess surpasseth their power of understanding, then there  is no doubt that all that hath been manifested is divinely inspired.  Notwithstanding their life-long diligent study, what pains do these  divines take when writing a single line in Arabic! Yet after such efforts  the result is but words which are unworthy of mention. All these things  are for a proof unto the people; otherwise the religion of God is too  mighty and glorious for anyone to comprehend through aught but itself;  rather by it all else is understood. II, 1.          \"Praise be to God that He hath enabled us to become ...\"      Praise be to God that He hath enabled us to become cognizant of Him Whom  God shall make manifest in the Day of Resurrection, so that we may derive  benefit from the fruit of our existence and be not deprived of attaining  the presence of God. For indeed this is the object of our creation and the  sole purpose underlying every virtuous deed we may perform. Such is the  bounty which God hath conferred upon us; verily He is the All-Bountiful,  the Gracious. Know thou, that thou wilt succeed in doing so if thou  believest with undoubting faith. However, since thou canst not attain the  state of undoubting faith, due to the intervening veils of thy selfish  desires, therefore thou wilt tarry in the fire, though realizing it not.  On the Day of His manifestation, unless thou truly believest in Him,  naught can save thee from the fire, even if thou dost perform every  righteous deed. If thou embracest the Truth, everything good and seemly  shall be set down for thee in the Book of God, and by virtue of this thou  wilt rejoice in the all-highest Paradise until the following Resurrection.    Consider with due attention, for the path is very strait, even while it is  more spacious than the heavens and the earth and what is between them. For  instance, if all those who were expecting the fulfilment of the promise of  Jesus had been assured of the manifestation of Muhammad, the Apostle of  God, not one would have turned aside from the sayings of Jesus. So  likewise in the Revelation of the Point of the Bayan, if all should be  assured that this is that same Promised Mihdi [One Who is guided] whom the  Apostle of God foretold, not one of the believers in the Qur'an would turn  aside from the sayings of the Apostle of God. So likewise in the  Revelation "]]]
