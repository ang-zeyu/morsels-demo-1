Mineral or  pigment colours. I described experiments to illustrate what we mean by  monogenetic and polygenetic colours, and indicating that the monogenetic  colours are mainly included in the group of substantive colours, whilst  the polygenetic colours are mainly included in the adjective colours.  But I described also an illustration of Group III., the mineral or  pigment colours, by which we may argue that chromate of lead is a  polygenetic mineral colour, for, according to the treatment, we were  able to obtain either chrome yellow (neutral lead chromate) or chrome  orange (basic lead chromate). I also said there was a kind of borderland  whichever mode of classification be adopted. Thus, for example, there  are colours that are fixed on the fibre either directly like indigo, and  so are substantive, or they may be, and generally are, applied with a  mordant like the adjective and polygenetic colours; examples of these  are Coerulein, Alizarin Blue, and a few more. We have now before us a  vast territory, namely, that of the _b_ group of substantive colours,  or, the largest proportion, indeed almost all of those prepared from  coal-tar sources; Alizarin, also prepared from coal-tar, belongs to the  adjective colours. With regard to the source of these coal-tar colours,  the word \"coal-tar,\" I was going to say, speaks volumes, for the  destructive and dry distillation of coal in gas retorts at the highest  temperatures to yield illuminating gas, also yields us tar. But, coal  distilled at lower temperatures, as well as shale, as in Scotland, will  yield tar, but tar of another kind, from which colour-generating  substances cannot be obtained practically, but instead, paraffin oil and  paraffin wax for making candles, etc. Coal-tar contains a very large  number of different substances, but only a few of them can be extracted  profitably for colour-making. All the useful sources of colours and dyes  from coal-tar are simply compounds of carbon and hydrogen--hydrocarbons,  as they are called, with the exception of one, namely, phenol, or  carbolic acid. I am not speaking here of those coal-tar constituents  useful for making dyes, but of those actually extracted from coal-tar  for that purpose, _i.e._ extracted to profit. For example, aniline is  contained in coal-tar, but if we depended on the aniline contained ready  made in coal-tar for our aniline dyes, the prices of these dyes would  place them beyond our reach, would place them amongst diamonds and  precious stones in rarity and cost, so difficult is it to extract the  small quantity of aniline from coal-tar. The valuable constituents  actually extracted are then these: benzene, toluene, xylene,  naphthalene, anthracene, and phenol or carbolic acid. One ton of  Lancashire coal, when distilled in gas retorts, yields about 12 gallons  of coal-tar. Let us now learn what those 12 gallons of tar will give us  in the shape of hydrocarbons and carbolic acid, mentioned as extracted  profitably from tar. This is shown very clearly in the following table  (Table A).    The 12 gallons of tar yield 1-1/10 lb. of benzene, 9/10 lb. of toluene,  1-1/2 lb. of carbolic acid, between 1/10 and 2/10 lb. of xylene, 6-1/2  lb. of naphthalene, and 1/2 lb. of anthracene, whilst the quantity of  pitch left behind is 69-1/2 lb. But our table shows us more; it  indicates to us what the steps are from each raw material to each  colouring matter, as well as showing us each colouring matter. We see  here that our benzene yields us an equal weight of aniline, and the  toluene (9/10 lb.) about 3/4 lb. of toluidine, the mixture giving, on  oxidation, between 1/2 and 3/4 lb of Magenta. From carbolic acid are  obtained both Aurin and picric acid, and here is the actual quantity of  Aurin obtainable (1-1/4 lb.). From naphthalene, either naphthylamine (a  body like aniline) or naphthol (resembling phenol) may be prepared. The  amounts obtainable you see in the table. There are two varieties of  naphthol, called alpha- and beta-naphthol, but only one phenol, namely,  carbolic acid. Naphthol Yellow is of course a naphthol colour, whilst  Vermilline Scarlet is a dye containing both naphthylamine and naphthol.  You see the quantities of these dyes, namely 7 lb. of Scarlet and 9-1/2  lb. of the Naphthol Yellow. The amount of pure anthracene obtained is  1/2 lb. This pure anthracene exhibits the phenomenon of fluorescence,  that is, it not only looks white, but when the light falls on it, it  seems to reflect a delicate violet or blue light. Our table shows us  that from the 12 gallons of tar from 1 ton of coal we may gain 2-1/4 lb.  of 20 per cent. Alizarin paste. Chemically pure Alizarin crystallises in  bright-red needles; it is the colouring principle of madder, and also of  Alizarin paste. But the most wonderful thing about substantive coal-tar  colours is their immense tinctorial power, _i.e._ the very little  quantity of each required compared with the immense superficies of cloth  it will dye to a full shade.

The next table (Table C) shows the latent dyeing power resident, so to  speak, in 1 lb. of coal.    By a very simple experiment a little of a very fine violet dye can be  made from mere traces of the materials. One of the raw materials for  preparing this violet dye is a substance with a long name, which itself  was prepared from aniline. This substance is  tetramethyldiamidobenzophenone, and a little bit of it is placed in a  small glass test-tube, just moistened with a couple of drops of another  aniline derivative called dimethylaniline, and then two drops of a  fuming liquid, trichloride of phosphorus, added. On simply warming this  mixture, the violet dyestuff is produced in about a minute. Two drops of  the mixture will colour a large cylinder of water a beautiful violet.  The remainder (perhaps two drops more) will dye a skein of silk a bright  full shade of violet. Here, then, is a magnificent example of enormous  tinctorial power. I must now draw the rein, or I shall simply transport  you through a perfect wonderland of magic, bright colours and apparent  chemical conjuring, without, however, an adequate return of solid  instruction that you can carry usefully with you into every-day life and  practice.

For a few days the neighborhood of McNaney's camp had been  entirely deserted by buffaloes, not even one remaining. But one morning  about daybreak a great herd which was traveling south began to pass  their camp. A long line of moving forms was seen advancing rapidly from  the northwest, coming in the direction of the hunters' camp. It  disappeared in the creek valley for a few moments, and presently the  leaders suddenly came in sight again at the top of \"a rise\" a few  hundred yards away, and came down the intervening slope at full speed,  within 50 yards of the two tents. After them came a living stream of  followers, all going at a gallop, described by the observer as \"a long  lope,\" from four to ten buffaloes abreast. Sometimes there would be a  break in the column of a minute's duration, then more buffaloes would  appear at the brow of the hill, and the column went rushing by as  before. The calves ran with their mothers, and the young stock got over  the ground with much less exertion than the older animals. For about  four hours, or until past 11 o'clock, did this column of buffaloes  gallop past the camp over a course no wider than a village street. Three  miles away toward the south the long dark line of bobbing humps and  hind quarters wound to the right between two hills and disappeared. True  to their instincts, the hunters promptly brought out their rifles, and  began to fire at the buffaloes as they ran. A furious fusilade was kept  up from the very doors of the tents, and from first to last over fifty  buffaloes were killed. Some fell headlong the instant they were hit, but  the greater number ran on until their mortal wounds compelled them to  halt, draw off a little way to one side, and finally fall in their death  struggles.    Mr. McNaney stated that the hunters estimated the number of buffaloes  _on that portion_ of the range that winter (1881-'82) at 100,000.    It is probable, and in fact reasonably certain, that such forced-march  migrations as the above were due to snow-covered pastures and a scarcity  of food on the more northern ranges. Having learned that a journey south  will bring him to regions of less snow and more grass, it is but natural  that so lusty a traveler should migrate. The herds or bands which  started south in the fall months traveled more leisurely, with frequent  halts to graze on rich pastures. The advance was on a very different  plan, taking place in straggling lines and small groups dispersed over  quite a scope of country.    Unless closely pursued, the buffalo never chose to make a journey of  several miles through hilly country on a continuous run. Even when  fleeing from the attack of a hunter, I have often had occasion to notice  that, if the hunter was a mile behind, the buffalo would always walk  when going uphill; but as soon as the crest was gained he would begin to  run, and go down the slope either at a gallop or a swift trot. In former  times, when the buffalo's world was wide, when retreating from an attack  he always ran against the wind, to avoid running upon a new danger,  which showed that he depended more upon his sense of smell than his  eye-sight. During the last years of his existence, however, this habit  almost totally disappeared, and the harried survivors learned to run for  the regions which offered the greatest safety. But even to-day, if a  Texas hunter should go into the Staked Plains, and descry in the  distance a body of animals running against the wind, he would, without a  moment's hesitation, pronounce them buffaloes, and the chances are that  he would be right.    In winter the buffalo used to face the storms, instead of turning tail  and \"drifting\" before them helplessly, as domestic cattle do. But at the  same time, when beset by a blizzard, he would wisely seek shelter from  it in some narrow and deep valley or system of ravines. There the herd  would lie down and wait patiently for the storm to cease. After a heavy  fall of snow, the place to find the buffalo was in the flats and creek  bottoms, where the tall, rank bunch-grasses showed their tops above the  snow, and afforded the best and almost the only food obtainable.    When the snow-fall was unusually heavy, and lay for a long time on the  ground, the buffalo was forced to fast for days together, and sometimes  even weeks. If a warm day came, and thawed the upper surface of the snow  sufficiently for succeeding cold to freeze it into a crust, the outlook  for the bison began to be serious. A man can travel over a crust through  which the hoofs of a ponderous bison cut like chisels and leave him  floundering belly-deep. It was at such times that the Indians hunted him  on snow-shoes, and drove their spears into his vitals as he wallowed  helplessly in the drifts. Then the wolves grew fat upon the victims  which they, also, slaughtered almost without effort.    Although buffaloes did not often actually perish from hunger and cold  during the severest winters (save in a few very exceptional cases), they  often came out in very poor condition. The old bulls always suffered  more severely than the rest, and at the end of winter were frequently in  miserable plight.    Unlike most other terrestrial quadrupeds of America, so long as he could  roam at will the buffalo had settled migratory habits.[39] While the elk  and black-tail deer change their altitude twice a year, in conformity  with the approach and disappearance of winter, the buffalo makes a  radical change of latitude. This was most noticeable in the great  western pasture region, where the herds were most numerous and their  movements most easily observed.    [Note 39: On page 248 of his \"North American Indians,\" vol. I, Mr.  Catlin declares pointedly that \"these animals are, truly speaking,  gregarious, but not migratory; they graze in immense and almost  incredible numbers at times, and roam about and over vast tracts of  country from east to west and from west to east as often as from north  to south, which has often been supposed they naturally and habitually  did to accommodate themselves to the temperature of the climate in the  different latitudes.\" Had Mr. Catlin resided continuously in any one  locality on the great buffalo range, he would have found that the  buffalo had decided migratory habits. The abundance of proof on this  point renders it unnecessary to eater fully into the details of the  subject.]    At the approach of winter the whole great system of herds which ranged  from the Peace River to the Indian Territory moved south a few hundred  miles, and wintered under more favorable circumstances than each band  would have experienced at its farthest north. Thus it happened that  nearly the whole of the great range south of the Saskatchewan was  occupied by buffaloes even in winter.    The movement north began with the return of mild weather in the early  spring. Undoubtedly this northward migration was to escape the heat of  their southern winter range rather than to find better pasture; for as a  grazing country for cattle all the year round, Texas is hardly  surpassed, except where it is overstocked. It was with the buffaloes a  matter of choice rather than necessity which sent them on their annual  pilgrimage northward.    Col. R. I. Dodge, who has made many valuable observations on the  migratory habits of the southern buffaloes, has recorded the  following:[40]    \"Early in spring, as soon as the dry and apparently desert prairie had  begun to change its coat of dingy brown to one of palest green, the  horizon would begin to be dotted with buffalo, single or in groups of  two or three, forerunners of the coming herd. Thicker and thicker and in  larger groups they come, until by the time the grass is well up the  whole vast landscape appears a mass of buffalo, some individuals  feeding, others standing, others lying down, but the herd moving slowly,  moving constantly to the northward. * * * Some years, as in 1871, the  buffalo appeared to move northward in one immense column oftentimes from  20 to 50 miles in width, and of unknown depth from front to rear. Other  years the northward journey was made in several parallel columns, moving  at the same rate, and with their numerous flankers covering a width of a  hundred or more miles.    \"The line of march of this great spring migration was not always the  same, though it was confined within certain limits. I am informed by old  frontiersmen that it has not within twenty-five years crossed the  Arkansas River east of Great Bend nor west of Big Sand Creek. The most  favored routes crossed the Arkansas at the mouth of Walnut Creek, Pawnee  Fork, Mulberry Creek, the Cimarron Crossing, and Big Sand Creek.    \"As the great herd proceeds northward it is constantly depleted, numbers  wandering off to the right and left, until finally it is scattered in  small herds far and wide over the vast feeding grounds, where they pass  the summer.    \"When the food in one locality fails they go to another, and towards  fall, when the grass of the high prairie becomes parched by the heat and  drought, they gradually work their way back to the south, concentrating  on the rich pastures of Texas and the Indian Territory, whence, the same  instinct acting on all, they are ready to start together on the  northward march as soon as spring starts the grass.\"    [Note 40: Our Wild Indians, p. 283, _et seq._]    So long as the bison held undisputed possession of the great plains his  migratory habits were as above--regular, general, and on a scale that  was truly grand. The herds that wintered in Texas, the Indian Territory,  and New Mexico probably spent their summers in Nebraska, southwestern  Dakota, and Wyoming. The winter herds of northern Colorado, Wyoming,  Nebraska, and southern Dakota went to northern Dakota and Montana, while  the great Montana herds spent the summer on the Grand Coteau des"]]]
