[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1740"],[0,"The Flying U's Last Stand (#17)"],[1,"Montana, an even five hundred head of the Flying U's best  grade cows and their calves were settling down for the night upon a  knoll that had been the bed-ground of many a herd. At the Flying U  ranch, in the care of the Old Man, were the mortgages that would make  the Happy Family nominal owners of those five hundred cows and their  calves. In the morning Andy would ride back and help bring the herd upon  its spring grazing ground, which was the claims; in the meantime he was  leisurely obeying an impulse to ride into One Man coulee and spend  the night under his own roof. And, say what you will, there is a  satisfaction not to be denied in sleeping sometimes under one's own  roof; and it doesn't matter in the least that the roof is made of  prairie dirt thrown upon cottonwood poles. So he sang while he rode, and  his voice boomed loud in the coulee and scared long stilled echoes into  repeating the song:            \"We're here because we're here, because we're here,          because we're here,            \"We're here because we're here, because we're here,          because we're here--\"    That, if you please, is a song; there are a lot more verses exactly  like this one, which may be sung to the tune of Auld Lang Syne with much  effectiveness when one is in a certain mood. So Andy sang, while his  tired horse picked its way circumspectly among the scattered rocks of  the trail up the coulee.            \"It's time you're here, it's time you're here,          It's time that you were here--\"    mocked an echo not of the hills.    Andy swore in his astonishment and gave his horse a kick as a mild hint  for haste. He thought he knew every woman-voice in the neighborhood--or  had until the colony came--but this voice, high and sweet and with a  compelling note that stirred him vaguely, was absolutely strange. While  he loped forward, silenced for the moment, he was conscious of a swift,  keen thankfulness that Pink had at the last minute decided to stay in  camp that night instead of accompanying Andy to One Man. He was in  that mood when a sentimental encounter appealed to him strongly; and a  woman's voice, singing to him from One Man cabin, promised undetermined  adventure.    He did not sing again. There had been something in the voice that held  him quiet, listening, expectant. But she also was silent after that  last, high note--like a meadow lark startled in the middle of his song,  thought Andy whimsically.    He came within sight of the cabin, squatting in the shadow of the grove  at its back. He half expected to see a light, but the window was  dark, the door closed as he had left it. He felt a faint, unreasoning  disappointment that it was so. But he had heard her. That high note that  lingered upon the word \"here\" still tingled his senses. His eyes sent  seeking glances here and there as he rode up.    Then a horse nickered welcomingly, and someone rode out from the deeper  shadow at the corner of the cabin, hesitated as though tempted to  flight, and came on uncertainly. They met full before the cabin, and the  woman leaned and peered through the dusk at Andy.    \"Is this--Mr. Mallory--Irish?\" she asked nervously. \"Oh dear! Have I  gone and made a fool of myself again?\"    \"Not at all! Good evening, Miss Allen.\" Andy folded his hands upon the  saddle horn and regarded her with a little smile, Keen for what might  come next.    \"But you're not Irish Mallory. I thought I recognized the voice, or I  wouldn't have--\" She urged her horse a step closer, and Andy observed  from her manner that she was not accustomed to horses. She reined as if  she were driving, so that the horse, bewildered, came sidling up to him.  \"Who are you?\" she asked him sharply.    \"Me? Why, I'm a nice young man--a lot better singer than Irish. I guess  you never heard him, did you?\" He kept his hands folded on the horn, his  whole attitude passive--a restful, reassuring passivity that lulled her  uneasiness more than words could have done.    \"Oh, are you Andy Green? I seem to connect that name with your  voice--and what little I can see of you.\"    \"That's something, anyway.\" Andy's tone was one of gratitude. \"It's two  per cent. better than having to tell you right out who I am. I met you  three different times, Miss Allen,\" he reproached.    \"But always in a crowd,\" she defended, \"and I never talked with you,  particularly.\"    \"Oh, well, that's easily fixed,\" he said. \"It's a nice night,\" he added,  looking up appreciatively at the brightening star-sprinkle. \"Are you  living on your claim now? We can talk particularly on the way over.\"    Miss Allen laughed and groped for a few loose hairs, found them and  tucked them carefully under her hatcrown. Andy remembered that gesture;  it helped him to visualize her clearly in spite of the deepening night.    \"How far have you ridden today, Mr. Green?\" she asked irrelevantly.    \"Since daylight, you mean? Not so very far counting miles--We were  trailing a herd, you see. But I've been in the saddle since sunrise,  except when I was eating.\"    \"Then you want a cup of coffee, before you ride any farther. If I get  down, will you let me make it or you? I'd love to. I'm crazy to see  inside your cabin, but I only rode up and tried to peek in the window  before you came. I have two brothers and a cousin, so I understand men  pretty well and I know you can talk better when you aren't hungry.\"    \"Are you living on your claim?\" he asked again, without moving.    \"Why, yes. We moved in last week.\"    \"Well, we'll ride over, then, and you can make coffee there. I'm not  hungry right now.\"    \"Oh.\" She leaned again and peered at him, trying to read his face. \"You  don't WANT me to go in!\"    \"Yes, I do--but I don't. If you stayed and made coffee, tomorrow you'd  be kicking yourself for it, and you'd be blaming me.\" Which, considering  the life he had lived, almost wholly among men, was rather astute of  Andy Green.    \"Oh.\" Then she laughed. \"You must have some sisters, Mr. Green.\" She was  silent for a minute, looking at him. \"You're right,\" she said quietly  then. \"I'm always making a fool of myself, just on the impulse of the  moment. The girls will be worried about me, as it is. But I don't want  you to ride any farther, Mr. Green. What I came to say need not take  very long, and I think I can find my way home alone, all right.\"    \"I'll take you home when you're ready to go,\" said Andy quietly. All at  once he had wanted to shield her, to protect her from even so slight an  unconventionality as making his coffee for him. He had felt averse to  putting her at odds with her conventional self, of inviting unfavorable  criticism of himself; dimly, because instinct rather than cold analysis  impelled him. What he had told her was the sum total of his formulated  ideas.    \"Well, I'm ready to go now, since you insist on my being conventional.  I did not come West with the expectation of being tied to a book of  etiquette, Mr. Green. But I find one can't get away from it after all.  Still, living on one's own claim twelve miles from a town is something!\"    \"That's a whole lot, I should say,\" Andy assured her politely, and  refrained from asking her what she expected to do with that eighty  acres of arid land. He turned his tired horse and rode alongside her,  prudently waiting for her to give the key.    \"I'm not supposed to be away over here, you know,\" she began when they  were near the foot of the bluff up which the trail wound seeking the  easiest slopes and avoiding boulders and deep cuts. \"I'm supposed to  be just out riding, and the girls expected me back by sundown. But I've  been trying and trying to find some of you Flying U boys--as they call  you men who have taken so much land--on your claims. I don't know that  what I could tell you would do you a particle of good--or anyone else.  But I wanted to tell you, anyway, just to clear my own mind.\"    \"It does lots of good just to meet you,\" said Andy with straightforward  gallantry. \"Pleasures are few and far between, out here.\"    \"You said that very nicely, I'm sure,\" she snubbed. \"Well, I'm going  to tell you, anyway--just on the chance of doing some good.\" Then she  stopped.    Andy rode a rod or two, glancing at her inquiringly, waiting for her to  go on. She was guiding her horse awkwardly where it needed only to be  let alone, and he wanted to give her a lesson in riding. But it seemed  too early in their acquaintance for that, so he waited another minute.    \"Miss Hallman is going to make you a lot of trouble,\" she began  abruptly. \"I thought perhaps it might be better for you--all of  you--if you knew it in advance, so there would be no sudden anger and  excitement. All the settlers are antagonistic, Mr. Green--all but me,  and one or two of the girls. They are going to do everything they can to  prevent your land-scheme from going through. You are going to be watched  and--and your land contested--\"    \"Well, we'll be right there, I guess, when the dust settles,\" he filled  in her thought unmoved.    \"I--almost hope so,\" she ventured. \"For my part, I can see the  side--your side. I can see where it is very hard for the cattle men to  give up their range. It is like the big plantations down south, when  the slaves were freed. It had to be done, and yet it was hard upon those  planters who depended on free labor. They resented it deeply; deeply  enough to shed blood--and that is one thing I dread here. I hope, Mr.  Green, that you will not resort to violence. I want to urge you all  to--to--\"    \"I understand,\" said Andy softly. \"A-course, we're pretty bad when we  get started, all right. We're liable to ride up on dark nights and shoot  our enemies through the window--I can't deny it, Miss Allen. And if it  comes right to a show-down, I may as well admit that some of us would  think nothing at all of taking a man out and hanging him to the first  three we come to, that was big enough to hold him. But now that ladies  have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17404"],[0,"Kinship Organisations and Group Marriage in Australia (#17)"],[1,"e,  originally very different no doubt, how different we can, indeed, hardly  say, must have so far coalesced, owing to the interchange of wives (in  so far as a distinct woman's language, traces of which are found among  some savage tribes, was not developed), as to produce a single tongue.    This theory Mr Lang has now fortified and elaborated in _The Secret of  the Totem_, the most important new point being the demonstration of the  fact that totem kins which bear names of the same significance as the  phratry names are almost invariably in the eponymous phratries--a clear  proof that law and not chance has determined their position.    As an explanation of the distribution of phratry names Mr Lang adopts a  theory which combines the hypotheses of evolution and borrowing, and  thus explains both the wide area covered by some systems, and the  increasing multitude of organisations confined to small districts, which  more minute research reveals. This does not, it is true, explain the  geographical remoteness of different parts of the same system or of  allied systems, shown to be so by the identity of phratry animal or  name. Not only is Wuthera-Mallera split into two sections; but a portion  of Wuthera-Yungaru seems to be in the same position; if we may take the  Badieri Yungo as equivalent to Yungaru, dispersion alone suffices to  explain the case; but if Yungo is derived from the Kurnandaburi, who  have Mattera as the sister phratry, then we have the Badieri phratry  names borrowed each from a different tribe, at any rate in appearance.    In reality this state of things affords the strongest possible support  to Mr Lang's hypothesis, if only we can suppose that the formation of  tribes is subsequent to the elaboration of the phratriac system. For it  might well happen that an original Yungo local group divided, from  economic causes, but that each half retained its original name. Under  these circumstances the two portions formed connubial alliances with  other groups; and in the tribes as we see the names of these split  groups are found as phratry names, combined in each case with a  different sister phratry name. We find for example Wuthera-Yungo,  Yungo-Mattera, Matteri-Kiraru in the central area. The same theory will  explain the appearance of Wuthera beside three other sister names,  though here we must call in the borrowing and migration theories as  well, to explain the wide area over which the names are found. We have  seen that in the northern tribes one of the phratry names appears to be  in each case from the same root; if this is so, we can apply to them too  the split-group hypothesis.    The case of Eaglehawk-Crow is less simple. Separated from the Darling  area by a considerable space lie four systems of the same name in the  east of Victoria. Here it is hardly possible to assume that the latter  systems have migrated; on the other hand the area covered by the Darling  group suggests that it is unlikely to have been forced from its original  home by pressure from outside. Perhaps it is simplest to suppose that  the Wiradjeri have gradually forced their way in, wedge fashion, between  the different sections, and either swallowed up the intervening members  or driven them before them; this would account for the existence of the  anomalous groups to the south-west.    In this area, too, we seem to have a case of the split group; but the  identity of meaning of the other phratry names (Malian and Multa both  mean Eaglehawk) makes it clear that it is simply a case of  translation--a possibility which must be kept in mind in the other cases  also. It is a common phenomenon for two tribes to have the name of one  animal in common, while for that of another entirely different words are  in use. The four Victorian groups appear to have borrowed the phratry  names, but the centre from which they took them must remain uncertain.    It may be noted in passing that the view of Prof. Gregory, who holds  that the occupation of Victoria by the blacks dates back no more than  300 years, is hardly borne out by the distribution of the phratriac  systems. It is clearly improbable that they were developed _in situ_,  for this would make the organisation of very much more recent date than  we have any warrant for supposing. On the other hand it is improbable  that four tribes, all with the same phratriac names, should have taken  their course in the same direction, and settled in proximity to one  another, at any rate, unless the natural features of the country made  this course the only possible one.    To return to Mr Lang's theory, it obviously suggests, if it does not  demand, that such phratries as are spread over wide areas should in the  main follow the lines of linguistic or cultural areas. Our knowledge of  these is hardly sufficient to enable us to say at present how far the  presumption of coincidence is fulfilled; but it is certain that in more  than one large area the facts are as Mr Lang's theory requires them to  be.    On the other hand in New South Wales we find an area in which we fail to  discern the lines on which the phratriac systems are distributed. Here,  however, we are at a disadvantage in consequence of the uncertainty  introduced by the unsettled question of \"blood\" organisations[109].  Further research may show that the supposed phratriac areas, which are  apparently only portions of the Wiradjeri territory, are in reality to  be assigned to the \"blood\" organisations, which we may probably assign  to a later date than the phratries and classes.    Perhaps Mr Lang's theory hardly accounts for the fact that eaglehawk and  crow figure not only as phratry names but also in the myths and rites.  It is not apparent why eaglehawk and crow groups should take the lead  and give their names to the phratries unless it was as contrasted  colours; on the other hand, if they were selected as the names from  among a number of others this difficulty vanishes, but then we do not  see why these names are not more widely found, unless indeed the  untranslated names mean eaglehawk and crow; but possibly all express a  contrast of some sort.    On the whole, however, it may be said that Mr Lang's theory holds the  field. Not only is it internally consistent, which cannot be affirmed of  the reformation theory, but it colligates the facts far better. This may  be illustrated by a single point.    On the reformation theory, unaccompanied, as it is, by any hypothesis of  borrowing of phratry names, we should _prima facie_ find the latter,  where they are translateable, to be those of the animals which are most  frequently found as totems. Now in the area covered by Dr Howitt's  recent work, omitting those tribes for which our lists of totems are  admittedly not complete, we find that emu, kangaroo, snake, eaglehawk,  and iguana are found as totems in about two-thirds of the cases; then,  after a long interval, come wallaby and crow, less than half as often,  with opossum rather more frequently, in half the total number. But it is  clearly outside the bounds of probability that four of the commonest  totems should not give their names, so far as is known, to phratries,  while eaglehawk recurs five, crow six, and cockatoo three times, the two  latter in one case in a remote area. Not only so, but the opposition  between the phratry names--black and white or the like--is  unintelligible, if, as on Dr Durkheim's theory, the phratries are simply  the elementary totem groups which intermarried and threw off secondary  totem kins. But criticism of other theories opens a wide field, into  which it is best not to diverge.    On the development theory the phratries came into existence perhaps as  the result of the persistence of an old custom of exogamy, non-moral in  its inception, or, it may be, as a result of the rise of totemic tabus.  The reformation theory, on the other hand, makes the conscious  attainment of a better state of society the object of the institution of  a dichotomous organisation. It will therefore be well to see what  results in practice from the phratriac organisation.    In the two-phratry area (other rules, which usually exist, apart) it is  impossible for children of the same mother or father, or of sisters or  of brothers, to marry, nor can one of the parents, either mother or  father, according to the rule of descent, take her or his own child in  marriage. Now if the object of the reformation was to prevent parents  from marrying children, it was clearly not attained. If, on the other  hand, it was intended to prevent children of the same mother or father  from intermarrying, the result could have been attained far more simply,  either by direct prohibition, such as is found in other cases, or by the  institution of totemic exogamy, which, in the view of some authorities,  already existed, and consequently made the phratry superfluous.    According to Dr Frazer's 1905 theory, phratries were introduced to  prevent brother and sister marriage and exogamous bars began in the  female line[110]. Against this hypothesis may be urged not only the  objections first stated but also the fact that for Dr Frazer the Arunta  are primitive and yet reckon descent (of the class) in the _male_ line.  If, as he conceives, conceptional totemism was transformed in the  central tribes into patrilineal totemism, I fail to see why the  phratries or classes should descend in the female line.    If in the third place, it was proposed to prevent children of sisters or  of brothers from intermarrying, it is completely mysterious why children  of brothers and sisters should not only not have been prevented in the  same way, but absolutely be regarded as the proper mates for each other.  Even if a single community reformed itself on these lines, it is hardly  conceivable that many should have done so, even if we suppose that the  advantages of prohibition were preached from tribe to tribe by  missionaries of"]]]
