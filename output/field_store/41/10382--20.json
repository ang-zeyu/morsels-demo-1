There was nothing inherently uncanny, magical or wizardly about       their occupation whatever. It was nothing but plain hard work       and keeping everlastingly at it. Now, what was the actual thing       behind that chemical laboratory that we did not have at home?       It was money, willing to back such activity, convinced that in       the final outcome, a profit would be made; money, willing to       take university graduates expecting from them no special       knowledge other than a good and thorough grounding in       scientific research and provide them with opportunity to become       specialists suited to the factory's needs.    It is evidently not impossible to make the United States self-sufficient  in the matter of coal-tar products. We've got the tar; we've got the  men; we've got the money, too. Whether such a policy would pay us in the  long run or whether it is necessary as a measure of military or  commercial self-defense is another question that cannot here be decided.  But whatever share we may have in it the coal-tar industry has increased  the economy of civilization and added to the wealth of the world by  showing how a waste by-product could be utilized for making new dyes and  valuable medicines, a better use for tar than as fuel for political  bonfires and as clothing for the nakedness of social outcasts.          V    SYNTHETIC PERFUMES AND FLAVORS      The primitive man got his living out of such wild plants and animals as  he could find. Next he, or more likely his wife, began to cultivate the  plants and tame the animals so as to insure a constant supply. This was  the first step toward civilization, for when men had to settle down in a  community (_civitas_) they had to ameliorate their manners and make laws  protecting land and property. In this settled and orderly life the  plants and animals improved as well as man and returned a hundredfold  for the pains that their master had taken in their training. But still  man was dependent upon the chance bounties of nature. He could select,  but he could not invent. He could cultivate, but he could not create. If  he wanted sugar he had to send to the West Indies. If he wanted spices  he had to send to the East Indies. If he wanted indigo he had to send to  India. If he wanted a febrifuge he had to send to Peru. If he wanted a  fertilizer he had to send to Chile. If he wanted rubber he had to send  to the Congo. If he wanted rubies he had to send to Mandalay. If he  wanted otto of roses he had to send to Turkey. Man was not yet master of  his environment.    This period of cultivation, the second stage of civilization, began  before the dawn of history and lasted until recent times. We might  almost say up to the twentieth century, for it was not until the  fundamental laws of heredity were discovered that man could originate  new species of plants and animals according to a predetermined plan by  combining such characteristics as he desired to perpetuate. And it was  not until the fundamental laws of chemistry were discovered that man  could originate new compounds more suitable to his purpose than any to  be found in nature. Since the progress of mankind is continuous it is  impossible to draw a date line, unless a very jagged one, along the  frontier of human culture, but it is evident that we are just entering  upon the third era of evolution in which man will make what he needs  instead of trying to find it somewhere. The new epoch has hardly dawned,  yet already a man may stay at home in New York or London and make his  own rubber and rubies, his own indigo and otto of roses. More than this,  he can make gems and colors and perfumes that never existed since time  began. The man of science has signed a declaration of independence of  the lower world and we are now in the midst of the revolution.    Our eyes are dazzled by the dawn of the new era. We know what the hunter  and the horticulturist have already done for man, but we cannot imagine  what the chemist can do. If we look ahead through the eyes of one of the  greatest of French chemists, Berthelot, this is what we shall see:         The problem of food is a chemical problem. Whenever energy can       be obtained economically we can begin to make all kinds of       aliment, with carbon borrowed from carbonic acid, hydrogen       taken from the water and oxygen and nitrogen drawn from the       air.... The day will come when each person will carry for his       nourishment his little nitrogenous tablet, his pat of fatty       matter, his package of starch or sugar, his vial of aromatic       spices suited to his personal taste; all manufactured       economically and in unlimited quantities; all independent of       irregular seasons, drought and rain, of the heat that withers       the plant and of the frost that blights the fruit; all free       from pathogenic microbes, the origin of epidemics and the       enemies of human life. On that day chemistry will have       accomplished a world-wide revolution that cannot be estimated.       There will no longer be hills covered with vineyards and fields       filled with cattle. Man will gain in gentleness and morality       because he will cease to live by the carnage and destruction of       living creatures.... The earth will be covered with grass,       flowers and woods and in it the human race will dwell in the       abundance and joy of the legendary age of gold--provided that a       spiritual chemistry has been discovered that changes the nature       of man as profoundly as our chemistry transforms material       nature.    But this is looking so far into the future that we can trust no man's  eyesight, not even Berthelot's. There is apparently no impossibility  about the manufacture of synthetic food, but at present there is no  apparent probability of it. There is no likelihood that the laboratory  will ever rival the wheat field. The cornstalk will always be able to  work cheaper than the chemist in the manufacture of starch. But in rarer  and choicer products of nature the chemist has proved his ability to  compete and even to excel.    What have been from the dawn of history to the rise of synthetic  chemistry the most costly products of nature? What could tempt a  merchant to brave the perils of a caravan journey over the deserts of  Asia beset with Arab robbers? What induced the Portuguese and Spanish  mariners to risk their frail barks on perilous waters of the Cape of  Good Hope or the Horn? The chief prizes were perfumes, spices, drugs and  gems. And why these rather than what now constitutes the bulk of oversea  and overland commerce? Because they were precious, portable and  imperishable. If the merchant got back safe after a year or two with a  little flask of otto of roses, a package of camphor and a few pearls  concealed in his garments his fortune was made. If a single ship of the  argosy sent out from Lisbon came back with a load of sandalwood, indigo  or nutmeg it was regarded as a successful venture. You know from reading  the Bible, or if not that, from your reading of Arabian Nights, that a  few grains of frankincense or a few drops of perfumed oil were regarded  as gifts worthy the acceptance of a king or a god. These products of the  Orient were equally in demand by the toilet and the temple. The  unctorium was an adjunct of the Roman bathroom. Kings had to be greased  and fumigated before they were thought fit to sit upon a throne. There  was a theory, not yet altogether extinct, that medicines brought from a  distance were most efficacious, especially if, besides being expensive,  they tasted bad like myrrh or smelled bad like asafetida. And if these  failed to save the princely patient he was embalmed in aromatics or, as  we now call them, antiseptics of the benzene series.    Today, as always, men are willing to pay high for the titillation of the  senses of smell and taste. The African savage will trade off an ivory  tusk for a piece of soap reeking with synthetic musk. The clubman will  pay $10 for a bottle of wine which consists mostly of water with about  ten per cent. of alcohol, worth a cent or two, but contains an  unweighable amount of the \"bouquet\" that can only be produced on the  sunny slopes of Champagne or in the valley of the Rhine. But very likely  the reader is quite as extravagant, for when one buys the natural violet  perfumery he is paying at the rate of more than $10,000 a pound for the  odoriferous oil it contains; the rest is mere water and alcohol. But you  would not want the pure undiluted oil if you could get it, for it is  unendurable. A single whiff of it paralyzes your sense of smell for a  time just as a loud noise deafens you.    Of the five senses, three are physical and two chemical. By touch we  discern pressures and surface textures. By hearing we receive  impressions of certain air waves and by sight of certain ether waves.  But smell and taste lead us to the heart of the molecule and enable us  to tell how the atoms are put together. These twin senses stand like  sentries at the portals of the body, where they closely scrutinize  everything that enters. Sounds and sights may be disagreeable, but they  are never fatal. A man can live in a boiler factory or in a cubist art  gallery, but he cannot live in a room containing hydrogen sulfide. Since  it is more important to be warned of danger than guided to delights our  senses are made more sensitive to pain than pleasure. We can detect by  the smell one two-millionth of a milligram of oil of roses or musk, but  we can detect one two-billionth of a milligram of mercaptan, which is  the vilest smelling compound that man has so far invented. If you do not  know how much a milligram is consider a drop picked up by the point of  a needle and imagine"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17160"],[0,"Modern Prose And Poetry; For Secondary Schools (#17)"],[1,"that flashed through my  mind, not half understood, unrelated to my utterable thoughts, concerned  something for which I had as yet no name. Every imaginative growing  child has these flashes of intuition, especially one that becomes  intimate with some one aspect of nature. With me it was the growing  time, that idle summer by the sea, and I grew all the faster because I  had been so cramped before. My mind, too, had so recently been worked  upon by the impressive experience of a change of country that I was more  than commonly alive to impressions, which are the seeds of ideas.    Let no one suppose that I spent my time entirely, or even chiefly, in  inspired solitude. By far the best part of my day was spent in  play--frank, hearty, boisterous play, such as comes natural to American  children. In Polotzk I had already begun to be considered too old for  play, excepting set games or organized frolics. Here I found myself  included with children who still played, and I willingly returned to  childhood. There were plenty of playfellows. My father's energetic  little partner had a little wife and a large family. He kept them in the  little cottage next to ours; and that the shanty survived the tumultuous  presence of that brood is a wonder to me to-day. The young Wilners  included an assortment of boys, girls, and twins, of every possible  variety of age, size, disposition, and sex. They swarmed in and out of  the cottage all day long, wearing the door-sill hollow, and trampling  the ground to powder. They swung out of windows like monkeys, slid up  the roof like flies, and shot out of trees like fowls. Even a small  person like me couldn't go anywhere without being run over by a Wilner;  and I could never tell which Wilner it was because none of them ever  stood still long enough to be identified; and also because I suspected  that they were in the habit of interchanging conspicuous articles of  clothing, which was very confusing.    You would suppose that the little mother must have been utterly lost,  bewildered, trodden down in this horde of urchins; but you are mistaken.  Mrs. Wilner was a positively majestic little person. She ruled her brood  with the utmost coolness and strictness. She had even the biggest boy  under her thumb, frequently under her palm. If they enjoyed the wildest  freedom outdoors, indoors the young Wilners lived by the clock. And so  at five o'clock in the evening, on seven days in the week, my father's  partner's children could be seen in two long rows around the supper  table. You could tell them apart on this occasion, because they all had  their faces washed. And this is the time to count them: there are twelve  little Wilners at table.    I managed to retain my identity in this multitude somehow, and while I  was very much impressed with their numbers, I even dared to pick and  choose my friends among the Wilners. One or two of the smaller boys I  liked best of all, for a game of hide-and-seek or a frolic on the beach.  We played in the water like ducks, never taking the trouble to get dry.  One day I waded out with one of the boys, to see which of us dared go  farthest. The tide was extremely low, and we had not wet our knees when  we began to look back to see if familiar objects were still in sight. I  thought we had been wading for hours, and still the water was so shallow  and quiet. My companion was marching straight ahead, so I did the same.  Suddenly a swell lifted us almost off our feet, and we clutched at each  other simultaneously. There was a lesser swell, and little waves began  to run, and a sigh went up from the sea. The tide was turning--perhaps a  storm was on the way--and we were miles, dreadful miles from dry land.    Boy and girl turned without a word, four determined bare legs ploughing  through the water, four scared eyes straining toward the land. Through  an eternity of toil and fear they kept dumbly on, death at their heels,  pride still in their hearts. At last they reach high-water mark--six  hours before full tide.    Each has seen the other afraid, and each rejoices in the knowledge. But  only the boy is sure of his tongue.    \"You was scared, warn't you?\" he taunts.    The girl understands so much, and is able to reply:    \"You can schwimmen, I not.\"    \"Betcher life I can schwimmen,\" the other mocks.    And the girl walks off, angry and hurt.    \"An' I can walk on my hands,\" the tormentor calls after her. \"Say, you  greenhorn, why don'tcher look?\"    The girl keeps straight on, vowing that she would never walk with that  rude boy again, neither by land nor sea, not even though the waters  should part at his bidding.    I am forgetting the more serious business which had brought us to  Crescent Beach. While we children disported ourselves like mermaids and  mermen in the surf, our respective fathers dispensed cold lemonade, hot  peanuts, and pink popcorn, and piled up our respective fortunes, nickel  by nickel, penny by penny. I was very proud of my connection with the  public life of the beach. I admired greatly our shining soda fountain,  the rows of sparkling glasses, the pyramids of oranges, the sausage  chains, the neat white counter, and the bright array of tin spoons. It  seemed to me that none of the other refreshment stands on the  beach--there were a few--were half so attractive as ours. I thought my  father looked very well in a long white apron and shirt sleeves. He  dished out ice cream with enthusiasm, so I supposed he was getting rich.  It never occurred to me to compare his present occupation with the  position for which he had been originally destined; or if I thought  about it, I was just as well content, for by this time I had by heart my  father's saying, \"America is not Polotzk.\" All occupations were  respectable, all men were equal, in America.    If I admired the soda fountain and the sausage chains, I almost  worshipped the partner, Mr. Wilner. I was content to stand for an hour  at a time watching him make potato chips. In his cook's cap and apron,  with a ladle in his hand and a smile on his face, he moved about with  the greatest agility, whisking his raw materials out of nowhere, dipping  into his bubbling kettle with a flourish, and bringing forth the  finished product with a caper. Such potato chips were not to be had  anywhere else on Crescent Beach. Thin as tissue paper, crisp as dry  snow, and salt as the sea--such thirst-producing, lemonade-selling,  nickel-bringing potato chips only Mr. Wilner could make. On holidays,  when dozens of family parties came out by every train from town, he  could hardly keep up with the demand for his potato chips. And with a  waiting crowd around him our partner was at his best. He was as voluble  as he was skilful, and as witty as he was voluble; at least so I guessed  from the laughter that frequently drowned his voice. I could not  understand his jokes, but if I could get near enough to watch his lips  and his smile and his merry eyes, I was happy. That any one could talk  so fast, and in English, was marvel enough, but that this prodigy should  belong to _our_ establishment was a fact to thrill me. I had never seen  anything like Mr. Wilner, except a wedding jester; but then he spoke  common Yiddish. So proud was I of the talent and good taste displayed at  our stand that if my father beckoned to me in the crowd and sent me on  an errand, I hoped the people noticed that I, too, was connected with  the establishment.    And all this splendor and glory and distinction came to a sudden end.  There was some trouble about a license--some fee or fine--there was a  storm in the night that damaged the soda fountain and other  fixtures--there was talk and consultation between the houses of Antin  and Wilner--and the promising partnership was dissolved. No more would  the merry partner gather the crowd on the beach; no more would the  twelve young Wilners gambol like mermen and mermaids in the surf. And  the less numerous tribe of Antin must also say farewell to the jolly  seaside life; for men in such humble business as my father's carry their  families, along with their other earthly goods, wherever they go, after  the manner of the gypsies. We had driven a feeble stake into the sand.  The jealous Atlantic, in conspiracy with the Sunday law, had torn it  out. We must seek our luck elsewhere.    In Polotzk we had supposed that \"America\" was practically synonymous  with \"Boston.\" When we landed in Boston, the horizon was pushed back,  and we annexed Crescent Beach. And now, espying other lands of promise,  we took possession of the province of Chelsea, in the name of our  necessity.    In Chelsea, as in Boston, we made our stand in the wrong end of the  town. Arlington Street was inhabited by poor Jews, poor Negroes, and a  sprinkling of poor Irish. The side streets leading from it were occupied  by more poor Jews and Negroes. It was a proper locality for a man  without capital to do business. My father rented a tenement with a store  in the basement. He put in a few barrels of flour and of sugar, a few  boxes of crackers, a few gallons of kerosene, an assortment of soap of  the \"save the coupon\" brands; in the cellar a few barrels of potatoes,  and a pyramid of kindling-wood; in the showcase, an alluring display of  penny candy. He put out his sign, with a gilt-lettered warning of  \"Strictly Cash,\" and proceeded to give credit indiscriminately. That was  the regular way to do business on Arlington Street. My father, in his  three years' apprenticeship, had learned the tricks of many trades. He  knew when and how to \"bluff.\" The legend of \"Strictly Cash\" was a  protection against notoriously irresponsible customers; while none of  the \"good\" customers, who had a record for paying regularly on Saturday,  hesitated to enter the store with empty purses.    If my father knew the tricks of the trade, my mother could be counted on  to throw all her talent and tact into the business. Of course "]]]
