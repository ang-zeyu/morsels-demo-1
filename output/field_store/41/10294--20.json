Proceeding in this direction they arrived at a large lake, which they  examined, though not without great labour. It was surrounded by a  considerable extent of bog and marshy ground, in which, in the course of  their progress, they were frequently plunged up to the waist. On this  lake they first observed a black swan, which species, though proverbially  rare in other parts of the world, is here by no means uncommon, being  found on most of the lakes. This was a very noble bird, larger than the  common swan, and equally beautiful in form. On being shot at, it rose and  discovered that its wings were edged with white: the bill was tinged with  red.    In three days, with great difficulty, they passed the swamps and marshes  which lie near the harbour. Nothing can more fully point out the great  improvement which may be made by the industry of a civilized people in  this country, than the circumstances of the small streams which descend  into Port Jackson. They all proceed from swamps produced by the  stagnation of the water after rising from the springs. When the obstacles  which impede their course can be removed, and free channels opened  through which they may flow, the adjacent ground will gradually be  drained, and the streams themselves will become more useful; at the same  time habitable and salubrious situations will be gained in places where  at present perpetual damps prevail, and the air itself appears to  stagnate.    On leaving these low grounds, they found them succeeded by a rocky and  barren country. The hills were covered with flowering shrubs, but by  means of various obstacles the ascending and descending was difficult,  and in many parts impracticable. At the distance of about fifteen miles  from the sea coast Governor Phillip obtained a very fine view of the  inland country and its mountains, to several of which he now gave names.  The most northern of them he named Carmarthen Hills, the most southern  Lansdown Hills; one which lay between these was called Richmond Hill.  From the manner in which these mountains appeared to rise, it was thought  almost certain that a large river must descend from among them. But it  was now necessary to return, without making any further examination.    22 April 1788    On the 22d another excursion of the same kind was undertaken: Governor  Phillip landed with his party near the head of the harbour. Here they  found a good country, but in a short time arrived at a very close cover;  and after passing the chief part of the day in fruitless attempts to make  their way through it, were obliged to relinquish the attempt, and return.  The next day, by keeping close to the banks of a small creek for about  four miles, they contrived to pass the cover, and for the three  succeeding days continued their course to the west-ward. The country  through which they travelled was singularly fine, level, or rising in  small hills of a very pleasing and picturesque appearance. The soil  excellent, except in a few small spots where it was stony. The trees  growing at the distance of from twenty to forty feet from each other, and  in general entirely free from underwood, which was confined to the stony  and barren spots. On the fifth day they ascended a small eminence,  whence, for the first time in this second expedition, they saw Carmarthen  and Lansdown Hills. The country round this hill was so beautiful, that  Governor Phillip gave it the name of Belle-vue. They were still  apparently thirty miles from the mountains which it had been their object  to reach, and not having found it practicable, with the tents, arms, and  other necessaries, to carry more than six days provisions, were obliged  to return. Even with this small stock, the officers as well as men, had  been under the necessity of carrying heavy loads. Water for the use of  the day was always taken; for though it happened in every instance that  pools of water were found which had remained after the rains, yet this  was a supply on which they could not previously depend. The extraordinary  difficulty of penetrating into this country had now been fully  experienced; where unexpected delays from deep ravines and other  obstacles, frequently force the traveller from his direct course, and  baffle every conjecture concerning the time required for passing a  certain tract. The utmost extent of this excursion in a direct line had  not been more than thirty miles, and it had taken up five days. The  return of the party was effected with much more ease; the track was made,  and the trees marked the whole way where they had passed; with these  assistances they reached their boats in a day and a half.    It was still the general opinion that the appearance of the country  promised the discovery of a large river in that district, whenever the  line now taken could be fully pursued. Another expedition was therefore  planned, in which it was determined, if possible, to reach either  Lansdown or Carmarthen Hills: and the hope of so important a discovery as  that of a river made every one anxious to go, notwithstanding the great  fatigue with which these undertakings were attended. But this design was  for the present unavoidably deferred. Governor Phillip, who had not been  perfectly well even at the time of setting out on the excursion to Broken  Bay, had then contracted a severe pain in his side, by sleeping  frequently on the wet ground. This complaint had in the two last journeys  received so much increase, that he found it absolutely necessary to allow  himself the respite of a few weeks, before he again encountered so much  fatigue.    The country explored in this last journey was so good and so fit for the  purposes of cultivation, that the Governor resolved to send a detachment  to settle there, as soon as a sufficient number could be spared from  works of more immediate necessity. But notwithstanding the goodness of  the soil it is a matter of astonishment how the natives, who know not how  to avail themselves of its fertility, can subsist in the inland country.  On the coast fish makes a considerable part of their food, but where that  cannot be had, it seems hardly possible that with their spears, the only  missile weapon yet observed among them, they should be able to procure  any kind of animal food. With the assistance of their guns the English  gentlemen could not obtain, in the last six days they were out, more than  was barely sufficient for two meals. Yet, that these parts are frequented  by the natives was undeniably proved by the temporary huts which were  seen in several places. Near one of these huts the bones of a kanguroo  were found, and several trees were seen on fire. A piece of a root  resembling that of the fern tree was also picked up by Governor Phillip;  part of this root had been chewed, and so recently that it was thought it  could not have been left many minutes. It seemed evident by several  marks, that the natives had only fled at the approach of the English  party, but so effectually did they conceal themselves that not one was  seen.    The number of the natives in these inland parts must, however, be very  small. Whether these reside by choice where they must encounter so many  difficulties, or whether they are driven from the society of those who  inhabit the coast, has not yet been discovered. The huts seen here  consisted of single pieces of bark, about eleven feet in length, and from  four to six in breadth, bent in the middle while fresh from the tree, and  set up so as to form an acute angle, not a little resembling cards set up  by children. In the plate inserted here, not only the huts, but some of  the spears of the natives are introduced. It was conjectured, that the  chief use of these imperfect structures might be, to conceal them from  the animals for which they must frequently be obliged to lie in wait.  They may also afford shelter from a shower of rain to one or two who sit  or lie under them. The bark of many trees was observed to be cut into  notches, as if for the purpose of climbing; and in several there were  holes, apparently the retreat of some animal, but enlarged by the natives  for the purpose of catching the inhabitant. The enlargement of these  holes with their imperfect instruments, must itself be a work of time,  and must require no little patience. In some places, where the hole was  rather too high to be reached from the ground, boughs of trees were laid  to facilitate the ascent. The animals that take refuge in those places  are probably the squirrel, the opossum, or the kanguroo-rat. At the  bottom of one of these trees, the skin of a flying squirrel was found.    In many places fires had lately been made; but in one only were seen any  shells of oysters or muscles, and there not more than half a dozen.  Fish-bones were not found at all, which seems to prove, that in their  journies inland these people do not carry with them any provisions of  that kind. Kanguroos were frequently seen, but were so shy that it was  very difficult to shoot them. With respect to these animals, it is rather  an extraordinary circumstance, that, notwithstanding their great shyness,  and notwithstanding they are daily shot at, more of them are seen near  the camp than in any other part of the country. The kanguroo, though it  resembles the jerboa in the peculiarity of using only the hinder legs in  progression, does not belong to that genus. The pouch of the female, in  which the young are nursed, is thought to connect it rather with the  opossum tribe. This extraordinary formation, hitherto esteemed peculiar  to that one genus, seems, however, in New Holland not to be sufficiently  characteristic: it has been found both in the rat and the squirrel kind.  The largest kanguroo which has yet been shot weighed about one hundred  and forty pounds. But it has been discovered that there are two kinds,  one of which seldom exceeds sixty pounds in weight: "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15106"],[0,"Origin of the Anglo-Boer War Revealed (2nd ed.) (#17)"],[1,"to that fabrication by the  pro-Boer Press have, however, scored another success to Bond propaganda  in fixing the belief with Boer partisans, of England's really  predetermined designs to annex both Republics. Every Boer has since been  more than ever so persuaded, the conviction fanning the fervour of  patriotism and stimulating his eagerness to resist the would-be  ravishers of his country.    Considering, on the other hand, that the English Government had known  much about the Afrikaner Bond menace, it is singular that precautionary  measures had halted with that bare effort of making military  observations. The only way to account for this apparent lethargic  inaction is the assumption that a persevering patience and friendly  attitude was expected in time to effectually dissipate all trouble in  South Africa, and that a display of anxiety or of force would have  frustrated such peaceable tactics. In refutation of the aspersion  against England, it may be sufficient to point to the fact that during  those very years (1896-7) both Republics were in a condition of complete  helplessness through the rinderpest scourge which was then raging. If  any hostile designs had in reality existed they could have been carried  out with utmost ease then, as that scourge presented no obstacle to  England. But it was the programme of peace which was pursued as  undeviatingly then as since, with a constancy which refused to be  foiled.      Pamphlet entitled _A Hundred Years of Injustice_    A mass of so-called proof against England of her guilt in provoking the  present war and justifying the Boer attitude was presented to the public  in South Africa and abroad in November last in the shape of a voluminous  pamphlet entitled _A Hundred Years of Injustice_ (published both in  English and Dutch, and later even translated into French). That  production covers Boer history and its troubles with England up to 1881.  It then travels over the diplomatic appeals of the Transvaal delegation,  which resulted in the renewed convention of 1884. Then it wades through  all the mire of academic squabble _re_ suzerainty, etc. After exhausting  the Jameson episode with bitter invective, and seeking applause for the  Transvaal Government for its professed desire to conciliate and to  propitiate England by the offer of a seven years' franchise, the reader  is, in conclusion, 'treated to a literary display of pyrotechnic  denunciations and prophetic burdens against wicked Albion, with appeals  to divine justice for righting the cause of an innocent nation so foully  driven to a war of pure self-defence.    Lest he be taken unawares the reader of that pamphlet would do well to  note the significant fact in connection with those preferred accusations  and aspersions that not a single act construable to the prejudice of  England is adduced dating after the Anglo-Transvaal peace of 1881, that  peace which had been mutually understood to close up all by-gones. But  the recriminations all revert to previous history, nothing having  occurred since 1881 to form real grounds for accusations. There had, on  the contrary, been an exhibition of unwearied friendly endeavours on the  part of Great Britain to maintain loyal peace with an ever-shifty and  truculent Government, and to induce it to desist from scandalous  intrigue against imperial interests in South Africa, and to adopt a more  rational attitude towards Uitlanders, which in itself would have  precluded troubles like that of the Johannesburg revolt and the Jameson  raid.          AN OLD FREE STATER'S ADMONITION      The doctrines of the Afrikaner Bond coterie have been so assiduously and  deeply instilled into the Boer mind that demonstrations are utterly  futile in shaking the national conviction of the divinely approved  justice of his cause. The first occasion when I saw this illustrated,  and also the people's unreasoning adherence to their leaders' opinions,  happened about ten years ago at burgher meetings which had been convened  to discuss the then projected law for restraining Uitlanders from  admission to Transvaal franchise and other political topics.    An old Free State burgher was led then and subsequently to express his  views upon the subject in about the following strain: \"It is our duty to  guard our nation against being swamped out or supplanted by strangers;  they are in great force already, and their number will constantly  increase, yet what attracts them, as you know, is our gold. That will  give out eventually, when the majority will again depart. Those  strangers, who then elect to remain with us, might be admitted to full  burgher rights. In the meantime it behoves us to reserve the full  franchise, nor will many aspire to it if they are only treated well as  strangers should be, as we should wish to be treated if we were in their  place. This is what they expect from us, and it can well be done without  giving full franchise, which they indeed do not need and will then not  claim. They will be content if their own interests are not hampered or  interfered with, and will be satisfied with such rights and privileges  as are reasonably due to guests, and we may say welcome guests (for it  is plain that the land is also largely benefited by their presence). In  other respects let us support law and order to suppress evil, which they  desire as well as we do.    \"Does the Bible not say, 'The Lord loveth the stranger?' so also then  must we; and again, 'Thou shalt not devise mischief against the stranger  who dwelleth in peace with thee.' We are reputed as a God-fearing  people. Is it not well that we should take great care to act in  accordance? But I have observed with shame that instead of love and  peace a spirit of hatred and strife has been allowed to gain upon us.  Let us strive to expel that evil, lest we fall under God's displeasure  and forfeit His favour. We cannot afford to lose that.\"    At this stage the speaker was interrupted by violent remarks about  England's incurable perfidy and the like, when he added, prolonging his  speech more than he had probably intended: \"Yes, we may not trust  England, but what we must do is to trust in God. Did God not pull us  through all along? was it not He who provided the peace of 1881 which  restored our independence? And can that gracious Lord, if we only let  Him act, not also protect us against any wiles and dangers if such  should occur in the future? As yet none such have arisen. The Lord was  with us in our battles for liberty; He was equally present and prompted  the sense and conditions of that very convention of 1881, which the  people were subsequently dissatisfied with and in their own wisdom  sacrificed for that of 1884. It is just possible that that presumptuous  act of wanting to improve upon the Lord's work will result in trouble  and prove to our sorrow that we have simply tampered and tinkered with a  good thing and spoilt it to our hurt.    \"'Thou shalt not provoke thy children to wrath lest they be discouraged  and be tempted to do evil,' applies specially also to the duties of  Governments. Our rulers need wisdom in this direction, and will be  responsible if our strangers are subjected to unfair laws. The older  people here will call to mind, when the old voortrekkers were obliged to  go hundreds of miles, as far as Pietermaritzburg, for their supplies,  that we prayed for shopkeepers in our land so that we might be spared  those long journeys. What was done soon after we had attracted strangers  to establish businesses with us? We were seduced to deliberately attempt  their ruin by starting those _nationale Boerenwinkels_ (national Boer  stores), supported by our own capital, but governed by Hollanders who  eventually squandered our money. Was that dealing fairly by confiding  strangers? Later on, again in response to our prayers, we got railways;  skilled men and much capital from foreign countries, first to prospect  for gold and then to develop and exploit the mines. Their labour and  hard-earned money were risked when the return was still problematic.  Shall we begrudge them their successes now, seeing that our whole land  is equally enriched at the same time, and but for them and their  enterprise the gold would still be lying uselessly hidden in the depths  of the ground? There are now, in 1890, over 100,000 such strangers in  the land, and probably over 200 millions capital invested. Shall they be  treated in a manner to justify the accusation that they were inveigled  into our land with the object of despoiling them afterwards after the  style of 'Come into my parlour, says the spider to the fly'? These  people count upon our honest friendship, especially the many English  among them who ground that confidence upon the honourable peace accorded  us in 1881. Shall we deceive them? May we hate them for old questions  which that peace was intended to bury for ever? Think of the Lord's  dealings with our people--poor, wandering, and despised at first. He had  blessings in store for the tried voortrekkers and their children. 'The  beggar was raised from the dunghill [_asch-hoop, i.e._, ash-heap, was  the word he used] to sit with princes'--'a table laid for us in the  sight of our enemies.' All this is literally fulfilled. Our President  and others representing us have been to Europe and sat with princes, and  we have a country full of riches enough to make any enemy to rage with  jealousy at the sight. Who else but the devil is that enemy? It is he  who persecuted our Dutch and Huguenot ancestors for their faith, and is  pursuing us since. It is he and his army that rage the most at our  unexampled blessings. It is he who wants us to forfeit them all and the  Lord's favour as well. It emanates from the evil one that so many among  us are seduced into wicked political plans to subvert authority  installed by God, to incite our brethren to sedition in the Colonies,  wanting to dispossess the"]]]
