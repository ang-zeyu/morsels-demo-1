At times she'll be laughing, seldom smile,  At times wept-out she'll seem,  Then again tranquil, you'd deem,--  Lovesick all the while.    _Faust_. Viper! Viper!    _Mephistopheles_ [_aside_].  Ay! and the prey grows riper!    _Faust_. Reprobate! take thee far behind me!  No more that lovely woman name!  Bid not desire for her sweet person flame  Through each half-maddened sense, again to blind me!    _Mephistopheles_. What then's to do? She fancies thou hast flown,  And more than half she's right, I own.    _Faust_. I'm near her, and, though far away, my word,  I'd not forget her, lose her; never fear it!  I envy e'en the body of the Lord,  Oft as those precious lips of hers draw near it.    _Mephistopheles_. No doubt; and oft my envious thought reposes  On the twin-pair that feed among the roses.    _Faust_. Out, pimp!    _Mephistopheles_. Well done! Your jeers I find fair game for laughter.  The God, who made both lad and lass,  Unwilling for a bungling hand to pass,  Made opportunity right after.  But come! fine cause for lamentation!  Her chamber is your destination,  And not the grave, I guess.    _Faust_. What are the joys of heaven while her fond arms enfold me?  O let her kindling bosom hold me!  Feel I not always her distress?  The houseless am I not? the unbefriended?  The monster without aim or rest?  That, like a cataract, from rock to rock descended  To the abyss, with maddening greed possest:  She, on its brink, with childlike thoughts and lowly,--  Perched on the little Alpine field her cot,--  This narrow world, so still and holy  Ensphering, like a heaven, her lot.  And I, God's hatred daring,  Could not be content  The rocks all headlong bearing,  By me to ruins rent,--  Her, yea her peace, must I o'erwhelm and bury!  This victim, hell, to thee was necessary!  Help me, thou fiend, the pang soon ending!  What must be, let it quickly be!  And let her fate upon my head descending,  Crush, at one blow, both her and me.    _Mephistopheles_. Ha! how it seethes again and glows!  Go in and comfort her, thou dunce!  Where such a dolt no outlet sees or knows,  He thinks he's reached the end at once.  None but the brave deserve the fair!  Thou _hast_ had devil enough to make a decent show of.  For all the world a devil in despair  Is just the insipidest thing I know of.               MARGERY'S ROOM.      MARGERY [_at the spinning-wheel alone_].        My heart is heavy,      My peace is o'er;      I never--ah! never--      Shall find it more.        While him I crave,      Each place is the grave,      The world is all      Turned into gall.        My wretched brain      Has lost its wits,      My wretched sense      Is all in bits.        My heart is heavy,      My peace is o'er;      I never--ah! never--      Shall find it more.        Him only to greet, I      The street look down,      Him only to meet, I      Roam through town.        His lofty step,      His noble height,      His smile of sweetness,      His eye of might,        His words of magic,      Breathing bliss,      His hand's warm pressure      And ah! his kiss.        My heart is heavy,      My peace is o'er,      I never--ah! never--      Shall find it more.        My bosom yearns      To behold him again.      Ah, could I find him      That best of men!      I'd tell him then      How I did miss him,      And kiss him      As much as I could,      Die on his kisses      I surely should!                MARTHA'S GARDEN.          MARGARET. FAUST.    _Margaret_. Promise me, Henry.    _Faust_. What I can.    _Margaret_. How is it now with thy religion, say?  I know thou art a dear good man,  But fear thy thoughts do not run much that way.    _Faust_. Leave that, my child! Enough, thou hast my heart;  For those I love with life I'd freely part;  I would not harm a soul, nor of its faith bereave it.    _Margaret_. That's wrong, there's one true faith--one must believe it?    _Faust_. Must one?    _Margaret_. Ah, could I influence thee, dearest!  The holy sacraments thou scarce reverest.    _Faust_. I honor them.    _Margaret_. But yet without desire.  Of mass and confession both thou'st long begun to tire.  Believest thou in God?    _Faust_. My. darling, who engages  To say, I do believe in God?  The question put to priests or sages:  Their answer seems as if it sought  To mock the asker.    _Margaret_. Then believ'st thou not?    _Faust_. Sweet face, do not misunderstand my thought!  Who dares express him?  And who confess him,  Saying, I do believe?  A man's heart bearing,  What man has the daring  To say: I acknowledge him not?  The All-enfolder,  The All-upholder,  Enfolds, upholds He not  Thee, me, Himself?  Upsprings not Heaven's blue arch high o'er thee?  Underneath thee does not earth stand fast?  See'st thou not, nightly climbing,  Tenderly glancing eternal stars?  Am I not gazing eye to eye on thee?  Through brain and bosom  Throngs not all life to thee,  Weaving in everlasting mystery  Obscurely, clearly, on all sides of thee?  Fill with it, to its utmost stretch, thy breast,  And in the consciousness when thou art wholly blest,  Then call it what thou wilt,  Joy! Heart! Love! God!  I have no name to give it!  All comes at last to feeling;  Name is but sound and smoke,  Beclouding Heaven's warm glow.    _Margaret_. That is all fine and good, I know;  And just as the priest has often spoke,  Only with somewhat different phrases.    _Faust_. All hearts, too, in all places,  Wherever Heaven pours down the day's broad blessing,  Each in its way the truth is confessing;  And why not I in mine, too?    _Margaret_. Well, all have a way that they incline to,  But still there is something wrong with thee;  Thou hast no Christianity.    _Faust_. Dear child!    _Margaret_. It long has troubled me  That thou shouldst keep such company.    _Faust_. How so?    _Margaret_. The man whom thou for crony hast,  Is one whom I with all my soul detest.  Nothing in all my life has ever  Stirred up in my heart such a deep disfavor  As the ugly face that man has got.    _Faust_. Sweet plaything; fear him not!    _Margaret_. His presence stirs my blood, I own.  I can love almost all men I've ever known;  But much as thy presence with pleasure thrills me,  That man with a secret horror fills me.  And then for a knave I've suspected him long!  God pardon me, if I do him wrong!    _Faust_. To make up a world such odd sticks are needed.    _Margaret_. Shouldn't like to live in the house where he did!  Whenever I see him coming in,  He always wears such a mocking grin.  Half cold, half grim;  One sees, that naught has interest for him;  'Tis writ on his brow and can't be mistaken,  No soul in him can love awaken.  I feel in thy arms so happy, so free,  I yield myself up so blissfully,  He comes, and all in me is closed and frozen now.    _Faust_. Ah, thou mistrustful angel, thou!    _Margaret_. This weighs on me so sore,  That when we meet, and he is by me,  I feel, as if I loved thee now no more.  Nor could I ever pray, if he were nigh me,  That eats the very heart in me;  Henry, it must be so with thee.    _Faust_. 'Tis an antipathy of thine!    _Margaret_. Farewell!    _Faust_. Ah, can I ne'er recline  One little hour upon thy bosom, pressing  My heart to thine and all my soul confessing?    _Margaret_. Ah, if my chamber were alone,  This night the bolt should give thee free admission;  But mother wakes at every tone,  And if she had the least suspicion,  Heavens! I should die upon the spot!    _Faust_. Thou angel, need of that there's not.  Here is a flask! Three drops alone  Mix with her drink, and nature  Into a deep and pleasant sleep is thrown.    _Margaret_. Refuse thee, what can I, poor creature?  I hope, of course, it will not harm her!    _Faust_. Would I advise it then, my charmer?    _Margaret_. Best man, when thou dost look at me,  I know not what, moves me to do thy will;  I have already done so much for thee,  Scarce any thing seems left me to fulfil.       [_Exit_.]         Enter_ MEPHISTOPHELES.    _Mephtftopheles_. The monkey! is she gone?    _Faust_. Hast played the spy again?    _Mephistopheles_. I overheard it all quite fully.  The Doctor has been well catechized then?  Hope it will sit well on him truly.  The maidens won't rest till they know if the men  Believe as good old custom bids them do.  They think: if there he yields, he'll follow our will too.    _Faust_. Monster, thou wilt not, canst not see,  How this true soul that loves so dearly,  Yet hugs, at every cost,  The faith which she  Counts Heaven itself, is horror-struck sincerely  To think of giving up her dearest man for lost.    _Mephistopheles_. Thou supersensual, sensual wooer,  A girl by the nose is leading thee.    _Faust_. Abortion vile of fire and sewer!    _Mephistopheles_. In physiognomy, too, her skill is masterly.  When I am near she feels she knows not how,  My little mask some secret meaning shows;  She thinks, I'm certainly a genius, now,  Perhaps the very devil--who knows?  To-night then?--    _Faust_. Well, what's that to you?    _Mephistopheles_. I find my pleasure in it, too!              AT THE WELL.        MARGERY _and_ LIZZY _with Pitchers._    _Lizzy_. Hast heard no news of Barbara to-day?    _Margery_. No, not a word. I've not been out much lately.    _Lizzy_. It came to me through Sybill very straightly.  She's made a fool of herself at last, they say.  That comes of taking airs!    _Margery_. What meanst thou?    _Lizzy_.                     Pah!  She daily eats and drinks for two now.    _Margery_.                    Ah!    _Lizzy_. It serves the jade right for being so callow.  How long she's been hanging upon the fellow!  Such a promenading!  To fair and dance parading!  Everywhere as first she must shine,  He was treating her always with tarts and wine;  She began to think herself something fine,  And let her vanity so degrade her  That she even accepted the presents he made her.  There was hugging and smacking, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14461"],[0,"Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft (#17)"],[1,"nymph, Phidyle, would have been a crime of a  deep dye in a Christian convert, and must have subjected him to  excommunication, as one relapsed to the rites of paganism; but he might  indulge his superstition by supposing that though he must not worship  Pan or Ceres as gods, he was at liberty to fear them in their new  capacity of fiends. Some compromise between the fear and the conscience  of the new converts, at a time when the church no longer consisted  exclusively of saints, martyrs, and confessors, the disciples of  inspired Apostles, led them, and even their priestly guides, subject  like themselves to human passions and errors, to resort as a charm, if  not as an act of worship, to those sacrifices, words, and ritual, by  which the heathen, whom they had succeeded, pretended to arrest evil or  procure benefits.    [Footnote 12: By this more ancient code, the punishment of death was  indeed denounced against those who destroyed crops, awakened storms, or  brought over to their barns and garners the fruits of the earth; but, by  good fortune, it left the agriculturists of the period at liberty to use  the means they thought most proper to render their fields fertile and  plentiful. Pliny informs us that one Caius Furius Cresinus, a Roman of  mean estate, raised larger crops from a small field than his neighbours  could obtain from more ample possessions. He was brought before the  judge upon a charge averring that he conjured the fruits of the earth,  produced by his neighbours' farms, into his own possession. Cresinus  appeared, and, having proved the return of his farm to be the produce of  his own hard and unremitting labour, as well as superior skill, was  dismissed with the highest honours.]    When such belief in a hostile principle and its imaginations was become  general in the Roman empire, the ignorance of its conquerors, those wild  nations, Franks, Goths, Vandals, Huns, and similar classes of unrefined  humanity, made them prone to an error which there were few judicious  preachers to warn them against; and we ought rather to wonder and admire  the Divine clemency, which imparted to so rude nations the light of the  Gospel, and disposed them to receive a religion so repugnant to their  warlike habits, than that they should, at the same time, have adopted  many gross superstitions, borrowed from the pagans, or retained numbers  of those which had made part of their own national forms of heathenism.    Thus, though the thrones of Jupiter and the superior deities of the  heathen Pantheon were totally overthrown and broken to pieces, fragments  of their worship and many of their rites survived the conversion to  Christianity--nay, are in existence even at this late and enlightened  period, although those by whom they are practised have not preserved the  least memory of their original purpose. We may hastily mention one or  two customs of classical origin, in addition to the Beltane and those  already noticed, which remain as examples that the manners of the Romans  once gave the tone to the greater part of the island of Britain, and at  least to the whole which was to the south of the wall of Severus.    The following customs still linger in the south of Scotland, and belong  to this class: The bride, when she enters the house of her husband, is  lifted over the threshold, and to step on it or over it voluntarily is  reckoned a bad omen. This custom was universal in Rome, where it was  observed as keeping in memory the rape of the Sabines, and that it was  by a show of violence towards the females that the object of peopling  the city was attained. On the same occasion a sweet cake, baked for the  purpose, is broken above the head of the bride; which is also a rite of  classic antiquity.    In like manner, the Scottish, even of the better rank, avoid contracting  marriage in the month of May, which genial season of flowers and breezes  might, in other respects, appear so peculiarly favourable for that  purpose. It was specially objected to the marriage of Mary with the  profligate Earl of Bothwell, that the union was formed within this  interdicted month. This prejudice was so rooted among the Scots that, in  1684, a set of enthusiasts, called Gibbites, proposed to renounce it,  among a long list of stated festivals, fast-days, popish relics, not  forgetting the profane names of the days of the week, names of the  months, and all sorts of idle and silly practices which their tender  consciences took an exception to. This objection to solemnize marriage  in the merry month of May, however fit a season for courtship, is also  borrowed from the Roman pagans, which, had these fanatics been aware of  it, would have been an additional reason for their anathema against the  practice. The ancients have given us as a maxim, that it is only bad  women who marry in that month.[13]    [Footnote 13: \"Malae nubent Maia.\"]    The custom of saying God bless you, when a person in company sneezes,  is, in like manner, derived from sternutation being considered as a  crisis of the plague at Athens, and the hope that, when it was attained  the patient had a chance of recovery.    But besides these, and many other customs which the various nations of  Europe received from the classical times, and which it is not our object  to investigate, they derived from thence a shoal of superstitious  beliefs, which, blended and mingled with those which they brought with  them out of their own country, fostered and formed the materials of a  demonological creed which has descended down almost to our own times.  Nixas, or Nicksa, a river or ocean god, worshipped on the shores of the  Baltic, seems to have taken uncontested possession of the attributes of  Neptune. Amid the twilight winters and overpowering tempests of these  gloomy regions, he had been not unnaturally chosen as the power most  adverse to man, and the supernatural character with which he was  invested has descended to our time under two different aspects. The Nixa  of the Germans is one of those fascinating and lovely fays whom the  ancients termed Naiads; and unless her pride is insulted or her jealousy  awakened by an inconstant lover, her temper is generally mild and her  actions beneficent. The Old Nick known in England is an equally genuine  descendant of the northern sea-god, and possesses a larger portion of  his powers and terrors The British sailor, who fears nothing else,  confesses his terror for this terrible being, and believes him the  author of almost all the various calamities to which the precarious life  of a seaman is so continually exposed.    The Bhar-guest, or Bhar-geist, by which name it is generally  acknowledged through various country parts of England, and particularly  in Yorkshire, also called a Dobie--a local spectre which haunts a  particular spot under various forms--is a deity, as his name implies, of  Teutonic descent; and if it be true, as the author has been informed,  that some families bearing the name of Dobie carry a phantom or spectre,  passant, in their armorial bearings,[14] it plainly implies that,  however the word may have been selected for a proper name, its original  derivation had not then been forgotten.    [Footnote 14: A similar bearing has been ascribed, for the same reason,  to those of the name of Fantome, who carried of old a goblin, or  phantom, in a shroud sable passant, on a field azure. Both bearings are  founded on what is called canting heraldry, a species of art disowned by  the writers on the science, yet universally made use of by those who  practice the art of blazonry.]    The classic mythology presented numerous points in which it readily  coalesced with that of the Germans, Danes, and Northmen of a later  period. They recognized the power of Erictho, Canidia, and other  sorceresses, whose spell could perplex the course of the elements,  intercept the influence of the sun, and prevent his beneficial operation  upon the fruits of the earth, call down the moon from her appointed  sphere, and disturb the original and destined course of Nature by their  words and charms and the power of the evil spirits whom they invoked.  They were also professionally implicated in all such mystic and secret  rites and ceremonies as were used to conciliate the favour of the  infernal powers, whose dispositions were supposed as dark and wayward as  their realms were gloomy and dismal. Such hags were frequent agents in  the violation of unburied bodies, and it was believed, by the vulgar at  least, that it was dangerous to leave corpses unguarded lest they should  be mangled by the witches, who took from them the most choice  ingredients composing their charms. Above all, it must not be forgotten  that these frightful sorceresses possessed the power of transforming  themselves and others into animals, which are used in their degree of  quadrupeds, or in whatever other laborious occupation belongs to the  transformed state. The poets of the heathens, with authors of fiction,  such as Lucian and Apuleius, ascribe all these powers to the witches of  the pagan world, combining them with the art of poisoning, and of making  magical philtres to seduce the affections of the young and beautiful;  and such were the characteristics which, in greater or less extent, the  people of the Middle Ages ascribed to the witches of their day.    But in thus adopting the superstitions of the ancients, the conquerors  of the Roman Empire combined them with similar articles of belief which  they had brought with them from their original settlements in the North,  where the existence of hags of the same character formed a great feature  in their Sagas and their Chronicles. It requires but a slight  acquaintance with these compositions to enable the reader to recognize  in the Galdrakinna of the Scalds the _Stryga_ or witch-woman of more  classical climates. In the northern ideas of witches there was no  irreligion concerned with their "]]]
