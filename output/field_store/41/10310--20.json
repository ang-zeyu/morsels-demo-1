The Colonel has been reading President Wilson's speech carefully, and  what seemed to impress him more than anything else was this passage from  it:    \"There is such a thing as a man being too proud to fight. There is such  a thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince  others by force that it is right.\"    Asked if he cared to make any comment upon the speech of the President,  Mr. Roosevelt said:    \"I think that China is entitled to draw all the comfort she can from  this statement and it would be well for the United States to ponder  seriously what the effect upon China has been of managing her foreign  affairs during the last fifteen years on the theory thus enunciated.    \"If the United States is satisfied with occupying some time in the  future the precise international position that China now occupies, then  the United States can afford to act on this theory. But it cannot act on  this theory if it desires to retain or regain the position won for it by  the men who fought under Washington and by the men who, in the days of  Abraham Lincoln, wore the blue under Grant and the gray under Lee.    \"I very earnestly hope that we will act promptly. The proper time for  deliberation was prior to sending the message that our Government would  hold Germany to a strict accountability if it did the things it has now  actually done. The 150 babies drowned on the Lusitania the hundreds of  women drowned with them, scores of these women and children being  Americans, and the American ship, the Gulflight, which was torpedoed,  offer an eloquent commentary on the actual working of the theory that  force is not necessary to assert, and that a policy of blood and iron  can with efficacy be met by a policy of milk and water.    \"I see it stated in the press dispatches from Washington that Germany  now offers to stop the practice on the high seas, committed in violation  of the neutral rights that she is pledged to observe, if we will abandon  further neutral rights, which by her treaty she has solemnly pledged  herself to see that we exercise without molestation. Such a proposal is  not even entitled to an answer. The manufacturing and shipment of arms  and ammunition to any belligerent is moral or immoral according to the  use to which the arms and munitions are to be put. If they are to be  used to prevent the redress of the hideous wrongs inflicted on Belgium,  then it is immoral to ship them. If they are to be used for the redress  of those wrongs and the restoration of Belgium to her deeply wronged and  unoffending people, then it is eminently moral to send them.    \"Without twenty-four hours' delay this country could, and should, take  effective action by declaring that in view of Germany's murderous  offenses against the rights of neutrals, all commerce with Germany shall  be forthwith forbidden, and all commerce of every kind permitted and  encouraged with France, England, and the rest of the civilized world.  This would not be a declaration of war. It would merely prevent  munitions of war being sent to a power which by its conduct has shown  willingness to use munitions to slaughter American men and women and  children. I do not believe the assertion of our rights means war, but we  will do well to remember there are things worse than war.    \"Let us, as a nation, understand that peace is worthy only when it is  the handmaiden of international righteousness and of national  self-respect.\"      MR. TAFT SPEAKS.    [By The Associated Press.]    MILWAUKEE, May 8.--\"The news of the sinking of the Lusitania as it comes  this morning is most distressing,\" said former President Taft on his  arrival from Madison today. \"It presents a situation of the most  difficult character, properly awakening great national concern.    \"I do not wish to embarrass the President of the Administration by a  discussion of the subject at this stage of the information, except to  express confidence that the President will follow a wise and patriotic  course.\"    _That it is possible for the United States to hold Germany \"strictly  accountable\" for the destruction of American lives on the Lusitania  without resort to war is Mr. Taft's opinion, reported in the following  dispatch from Philadelphia to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _on May 11:_    \"We must bear in mind that if we have a war it is the people, the men  and women, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, who must pay with  lives and money the cost of it, and therefore they should not be hurried  into the sacrifices until it is made clear that they wish it and know  what they are doing when they wish it.\"    This was the keynote of a speech by ex-President Taft at the celebration  of the fiftieth anniversary of the Union League's occupancy of the  historic home which it occupies in this city.    \"Is war the only method of making a nation accountable? Let us look into  our own history. England connived at the fitting out of armed vessels,  to prey on our commerce, to attack our navy, and to kill our sailors. We  protested, and what did we do then? We held her strictly accountable in  the Geneva Conference. Was not our honor as much preserved by this  method as it would have been had we declared war?    \"I agree that the inhumanity of the circumstances in the case now  presses us on, but in the heat of even just indignation is this the best  time to act, when action involves such momentous consequences and means  untold loss of life and treasure? There are things worse than war, but  delay, due to calm deliberation, cannot change the situation or minimize  the effect of what we finally conclude to do.    \"With the present condition of the war in Europe, our action, if it is  to be extreme, will not lose efficiency by giving time to the people,  whose war it will be, to know what they are facing.    \"A demand for war that cannot survive the passion of the first days of  public indignation and will not endure the test of delay and  deliberation by all the people is not one that should be yielded to.\"          President Wilson's Note    By Ex-President William H. Taft.      _At the dinner of Methodist laymen in New York on May 14, 1915,  following the publication of President Wilson's note to Germany,  ex-President Taft said:_    \"Admirable in tone, moderate in the judicial spirit that runs through  the entire communication, dignified in the level that the writer takes  with respect to international obligations, accurate in its statement of  international law, he puts the case of the United States in a way that  may well call for our earnest concurrence and confirmation.\"          Another View    By Beatrice Barry.      \"When the torch is near the powder\"--when a boat, f'r instance, sinks,  And the \"hyphens\" raise a loud hurrah and blow themselves to drinks;  When 'bout a hundred neutral lives are snuffed out like a torch,  An' \"hyphens\" read the news an' smoke, a-settin' on the porch--  Well, it's then the native's kind o' apt to see a little red,  An' it's hardly fair to criticise the burning things he sed.  For since the eagle's not a bird that thrives within a cage,  One kind o' hears with sympathy his screams of baffled rage.    There's something sort o' horrible, that catches at the breath,  To visualize some two score babes most foully done to death;  To see their fright, their struggles--to watch their lips turn blue--  There ain't no use denyin', it will raise the deuce with you.  O yes, God bless the President--he's an awful row to hoe,  An' God grant, too, that peace with honor hand in hand may go,  But let's not call men \"rotters,\" 'cause, while we are standing pat,  They lose their calm serenity, an' can't see things like that!          In the Submarine War Zone    [By The Associated Press.]      LIVERPOOL, May 16.--The passengers on board the American Line steamer  Philadelphia, which arrived here today from New York, the steamer  docking at 1 P.M., experienced during the voyage much anxiety. On Friday  afternoon, out in the Atlantic off the west coast of Ireland, a cruiser  appeared and approached the liner. The chief topic of conversation  during the voyage had been about the German submarine activities, and  the sight of the warship caused some alarm. The cruiser approached near  enough to the steamer to exchange signals with her.    A number of passengers spent last night on deck in their chairs with  lifebelts beside them in case of danger. The boats of the Philadelphia  were ready for use. The steamer kept a course much further out from the  Irish coast than the Lusitania was traversing when she was torpedoed.    The port officials subjected the passengers of the Philadelphia to a  careful examination to discover if there were any spies on board, but  nobody was detained. By reason of this precaution it was more than an  hour after the steamer arrived before her passengers began to debark.          American Shipments of Arms    By Count von Bernstorff, German Ambassador at Washington           Count von Bernstorff, the German Ambassador, made public on       April 11, 1915, a memorandum addressed to the United States       Government on April 4, complaining of its attitude toward the       shipment of war munitions to the Allies and the non-shipment       of foodstuffs to Germany. After picturing the foreign policy       of the United States Government as one of futility, Count von       Bernstorff's memorandum says it must be \"assumed that the       United States Government has accepted England's violations of       international law.\" Its full text appears below, followed by       that of the American State Department's reply.    The different British Orders in Council have altered the universally  recognized rules of international law in such a one-sided manner that  they arbitrarily suppress the trade"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15483"],[0,"Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official (#17)"],[1,"by European officers, either from  their ignorance or their indolence. They do not like the trouble of  seeing the men paid either for their wood or their labour; and their  head servants of the kitchen or the wardrobe weary and worry them out  of their best resolutions on the subject. They make the poor men sit  aloof by telling them that their master is a tiger before breakfast,  and will eat them if they approach; and they tell their masters that  there is no hope of getting the poor men to come for their money till  they have bathed or taken their breakfast. The latter wait in hopes  that the gentleman will come out or send for them as soon as he has  been tamed by his breakfast; but this meal has put him in good humour  with all the world, and he is now no longer unwilling to trust the  payment of the poor men to his butler, or his _valet de chambre_.  They keep the poor wretches waiting, declaring that they have as yet  received no orders to pay them, till, hungry and weary, in the  afternoon they all walk back to their homes in utter despair of  getting anything.    If, in the meantime, the gentleman comes out, and finds the men, his  servants pacify him by declaring either that they have not yet had  time to carry his orders into effect, that they could not get copper  change for silver rupees, or that they were anxious to collect all  the people together before they paid any, lest they might pay some of  them twice over. It is seldom, however, that he comes among them at  all; he takes it for granted that the people have all been paid; and  passes the charge in the account of his servants, who all get what  these porters ought to have received. Or, perhaps the gentleman may  persuade himself that, if he pays his valet or butler, these  functionaries will never pay the poor men, and think that he had  better sit quiet and keep the money in his own pocket. The native  police or revenue officer is directed by his superior to have wood  collected for the camp of a regiment or great civil officers, and he  sends out his myrmidons to employ the people around in felling trees,  and cutting up wood enough to supply not only the camp, but his own  cook-rooms and those of his friends for the next six months. The men  so employed commonly get nothing; but the native officer receives  credit for all manner of superlatively good qualities, which are  enumerated in a certificate. Many a fine tree, dear to the affections  of families and village communities, has been cut down in spite, or  redeemed from the axe by a handsome present to this officer or his  myrmidons. Lambs, kids, fowls, milk, vegetables, all come flowing in  for the great man's table from poor people, who are too hopeless to  seek for payment, or who are represented as too proud and wealthy to  receive it. Such always have been and such always will be some of the  evils of the purveyance system. If a police officer receives an order  from the magistrate to provide a regiment, detachment, or individual  with boats, carts, bullocks, or porters, he has all that can be found  within his jurisdiction forthwith seized--releases all those whose  proprietors are able and willing to pay what he demands, and  furnishes the rest, which are generally the worst, to the persons who  require them. Police officers derive so much profit from these  applications that they are always anxious they should be made; and  will privately defeat all attempts of private individuals to provide  themselves by dissuading or intimidating the proprietors of vehicles  from voluntarily furnishing them. The gentleman's servant who is sent  to procure them returns and tells his master that there are plenty of  vehicles, but that their proprietors dare not send them without  orders from the police; and that the police tell him they dare not  give such orders without the special sanction of the magistrate. The  magistrate is written to, but declares that his police have been  prohibited from interfering in such matters without special orders,  since the proprietors ought to be permitted to send their vehicles to  whom they choose, except on occasions of great public emergency; and,  as the present cannot be considered as one of these occasions, he  does not feel authorized to issue such orders. On the Ganges, many  men have made large fortunes by pretending a general authority to  seize boats for the use of the commissariat, or for other Government  purposes, on the ground of having been once or twice employed on that  duty; and what they get is but a small portion of that which the  public lose. One of these self-constituted functionaries has a boat  seized on its way down or up the river; and the crew, who are merely  hired for the occasion, and have a month's wages in advance, seeing  no prospect of getting soon out of the hands of this pretended  Government servant, desert, and leave the boat on the sands; while  the owner, if he ever learns the real state of the case, thinks it  better to put up with his loss than to seek redress through expensive  courts, and distant local authorities. If the boat happens to be  loaded and to have a supercargo, who will not or cannot bribe high  enough, he is abandoned on the sands by his crew; in his search for  aid from the neighbourhood, his helplessness becomes known--he is  perhaps murdered, or runs away in the apprehension of being so--the  boat is plundered and made a wreck. Still the dread of the delays and  costs of our courts, and the utter hopelessness of ever recovering  the lost property, prevent the proprietors from seeking redress, and  our Government authorities know nothing of the circumstances.    We remained at Baghauri the 21st to enable our people to prepare for  the long march they had before them, and to see a little more of our  Jubbulpore friends, who were to have another day's shooting, as black  partridges[2] and quail had been found abundant in the neighbourhood  of our camp.[3]      Notes:    1.

The  author took charge of the Sagar district in January 1831.    2. _Francolinus vulgaris_.    3. The purveyance system (Persian _rasad rasani_) above described is  one of the necessary evils of Oriental life. It will be observed that  the author, though so keenly sensitive to the abuses attending the  system, proposes no substitute for it, and confesses that the small  attempt he made to check abuse was a failure. From time immemorial it  has been the custom for Government officials in India to be supplied  with necessaries by the people of the country through which their  camps pass. Under native Governments no officials ever dream of  paying for anything. In British territory requisitions are limited,  and in well ordered civil camps nothing is taken without payment  except wood, coarse earthen vessels, and grass. The hereditary  village potter supplies the pots, and this duty is fully recognized  as one attaching to his office. The landholders supply the wood and  grass. None of these things are ordinarily procurable by private  purchase in sufficient quantity, and in most cases could not be  bought at all. Officers commanding troops send in advance  requisitions specifying the quantities of each article needed, and  the indent is met by the civil authorities. Everything so indented  for, including wood and grass, is supposed to be paid for, but in  practice it is often impossible, with the agency available, to ensure  actual payment to the persons entitled. Troops and the people in  civil camps must live, and all that can be done is to check abuse, so  far as possible, by vigilant administration. The obligation of  landholders to supply necessaries for troops and officials on the  march is so well established that it forms one of the conditions of  the contract with Government under which proprietors in the  permanently settled province of Benares hold their lands. The extreme  abuses of which the system is capable under a lax and corrupt native  Government are abundantly illustrated in the author's _Journey  through the Kingdom of Oudh_. 'The System of Purveyance and Forced  Labour' is the subject of article xxv in the Hon. F, J, Shore's  curious book, _Notes on Indian Affairs_ (London, 1837, 2 vols. 8vo).  Many of the abuses denounced by Mr. Shore have been suppressed, but  some, unhappily, still exist, and are likely to continue for many  years.

Mir Salamat Ali, the head native collector of the district, a  venerable old Musalman and most valuable public servant, who has been  labouring in the same vineyard with me for the last fifteen years  with great zeal, ability, and integrity, came to visit me after  breakfast with two very pretty and interesting young sons. While we  were sitting together my wife's under-woman[2] said to some one who  was talking with her outside the tent-door, 'If that were really the  case, should I not be degraded?' 'You see, Mir Sahib',[3] said I,  'that the very lowest members of society among these Hindoos still  feel the pride of caste, and dread exclusion from their own, however  low.'[4]    'Yes', said the Mir, 'they are a very strange kind of people, and I  question whether they ever had a real prophet among them.'    'I question, Mir Sahib, whether they really ever had such a person.  They of course think the incarnations of their three great divinities  were beings infinitely superior to prophets, being in all their  attributes and prerogatives equal to the divinities themselves.[5]  But we are disposed to think that these incarnations were nothing  more than great men whom their flatterers and poets have exalted into  gods--this was the way in which men made their gods in ancient Greece  and Egypt.
