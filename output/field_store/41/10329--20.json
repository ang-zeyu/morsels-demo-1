He  himself eagerly disclaims any pretension to the original conception of  the use of electricity as an errand-boy. Hundreds of people had thought  of that and suggested it: but Morse was the first to give the errand-boy  such a written message, that he could not lose it on the way, nor  mistake it when he arrived. The public, eager to thank Morse, as he  deserves, thanks him for something he did not invent. For this he  probably cares very little; nor do I care more. But the public does not  thank him for what he did originate,--this invaluable and simple  alphabet. Now, as I use it myself in every detail of life, and see every  hour how the public might use it, if it chose, I am really sorry for  this negligence,--both on the score of his fame, and of general  convenience.    Please to understand, then, ignorant Reader, that this curious alphabet  reduces all the complex machinery of Cadmus and the rest of the  writing-masters to characters as simple as can be made by a dot, a  space, and a line, variously combined. Thus, the marks .-- designate the  letter A. The marks --... designate the letter B. All the other letters  are designated in as simple a manner.    Now I am stripping myself of one of the private comforts of my life,  (but what will one not do for mankind?) when I explain that this simple  alphabet need not be confined to electrical signals. _Long_ and _short_  make it all,--and wherever long and short can be combined, be it in  marks, sounds, sneezes, fainting-fits, canes, or children, ideas can be  conveyed by this arrangement of the long and short together. Only last  night I was talking scandal with Mrs. Wilberforce at a summer party at  the Hammersmiths. To my amazement, my wife, who scarcely can play \"The  Fisher's Hornpipe,\" interrupted us by asking Mrs. Wilberforce if she  could give her the idea of an air in \"The Butcher of Turin.\" Mrs.  Wilberforce had never heard that opera,--indeed, had never heard of it.  My angel-wife was surprised,--stood thrumming at the piano,--wondered  she could not catch this very odd bit of discordant accord at all,--but  checked herself in her effort, as soon as I observed that her long notes  and short notes, in their tum-tee, tee,--tee-tee, tee-tum tum, meant,  \"He's her brother.\" The conversation on her side turned from \"The  Butcher of Turin,\" and I had just time on the hint thus given me by Mrs.  I. to pass a grateful eulogium on the distinguished statesman whom Mrs.  Wilberforce, with all a sister's care, had rocked in his  baby-cradle,--whom, but for my wife's long and short notes, I should  have clumsily abused among the other statesmen of the day.    You will see, in an instant, awakening Reader, that it is not the  business simply of \"operators\" in telegraphic dens to know this Morse  alphabet, but your business, and that of every man and woman. If our  school committees understood the times, it would be taught, even before  phonography or physiology, at school. I believe both these sciences now  precede the old English alphabet.    As I write these words, the bell of the South Congregational strikes  dong, dong, dong,--dong, dong, dong, dong,--dong,--dong. Nobody has  unlocked the church-door. I know that, for I am locked up in the vestry.  The old tin sign, \"In case of fire, the key will be found at the  opposite house,\" has long since been taken down, and made into the nose  of a water-pot. Yet there is no Goody Two-Shoes locked in. No one except  me, and certainly I am not ringing the bell. No! But, thanks to Dr.  Channing's Fire Alarm,[M] the bell is informing the South End that  there is a fire in District Dong-dong-dong,--that is to say, District  No. 3. Before I have explained to you so far, the \"Eagle\" engine, with a  good deal of noise, has passed the house on its way to that fated  district. An immense improvement this on the old system, when the  engines radiated from their houses in every possible direction, and the  fire was extinguished by the few machines whose lines of quest happened  to cross each other at the particular place where the child had been  building cob-houses out of lucifer-matches in a paper warehouse. Yes, it  is a very great improvement. All those persons, like you and me, who  have no property in District Dong-dong-dong, can now sit at home at  ease;--and little need we think upon the mud above the knees of those  who have property in that district and are running to look after it. But  for them the improvement only brings misery. You arrive wet, hot/or  cold, or both, at the large District No. 3, to find that the  lucifer-matches were half a mile away from your store,--and that your  own private watchman, even, had not been waked by the working of the  distant engines. Wet property holder, as you walk home, consider this.  When you are next in the Common Council, vote an appropriation for  applying Morse's alphabet of long and short to the bells. Then they can  be made to sound intelligibly. Daung ding ding,--ding,--ding  daung,--daung daung daung, and so on, will tell you as you wake in the  night that it is Mr. B.'s store which is on fire, and not yours, or that  it is yours and not his. This is not only a convenience to you and a  relief to your wife and family, who will thus be spared your excursions  to unavailable and unsatisfactory fires, and your somewhat irritated  return,--it will be a great relief to the Fire Department. How placid  the operations of a fire where none attend except on business! The  various engines arrive, but no throng of distant citizens, men and boys,  fearful of the destruction of their all. They have all roused on their  pillows to learn that it is No. 530 Pearl Street which is in flames. All  but the owner of No. 530 Pearl Street have dropped back to sleep. He  alone has rapidly repaired to the scene. That is he, who stands in the  uncrowded street with the Chief Engineer, on the deck of No. 18, as she  plays away. His property destroyed, the engines retire,--he mentions the  amount of his insurance to those persons who represent the daily press,  they all retire to their homes,--and the whole is finished as simply,  almost, as was his private entry in his day-book the afternoon  before.[N]    This is what might be, if the magnetic alarm only struck _long_ and  _short_, and we had all learned Morse's alphabet. Indeed, there is  nothing the bells could not tell, if you would only give them time  enough. We have only one chime, for musical purposes, in the town. But,  without attempting tunes, only give the bells the Morse alphabet, and  every bell in Boston might chant in monotone the words of \"Hail  Columbia\" at length, every Fourth of July. Indeed, if Mr. Barnard should  report any day that a discouraged 'prentice-boy had left town for his  country home, all the bells could instantly be set to work to speak  articulately, in language regarding which the dullest imagination need  not be at loss,        \"Turn again, Higginbottom,      Lord Mayor of Boston!\"    I have suggested the propriety of introducing this alphabet into the  primary schools. I need not say I have taught it to my own  children,--and I have been gratified to see how rapidly it made head,  against the more complex alphabet, in the grammar schools. Of course it  does;--an alphabet of two characters matched against one of  twenty-six,--or of forty-odd, as the very odd one of the phonotypists  employ! On the Franklin-medal day I went to the Johnson-School  examination. One of the committee asked a nice girl what was the capital  of Brazil. The child looked tired and pale, and, for an instant,  hesitated. But, before she had time to commit herself, all answering was  rendered impossible by an awful turn of whooping-cough which one of my  own sons was seized with,--who had gone to the examination with me.  Hawm, hem hem;--hem hem hem;--hem, hem;--hawm, hem hem;--hem hem  hem;--hem, hem,--barked the poor child, who was at the opposite extreme  of the school-room. The spectators and the committee looked to see him  fall dead with a broken blood-vessel. I confess that I felt no alarm,  after I observed that some of his gasps were long and some very  _staccato_;--nor did pretty little Mabel Warren. She recovered her  color,--and, as soon as silence was in the least restored, answered,  \"_Rio_ is the capital of Brazil,\"--as modestly and properly as if she  had been taught it in her cradle. They are nothing but children, any of  them,--but that afternoon, after they had done all the singing the city  needed for its annual entertainment of the singers, I saw Bob and Mabel  start for a long expedition into West Roxbury,--and when he came back, I  know it was a long featherfew, from her prize school-bouquet, that he  pressed in his Greene's \"Analysis,\" with a short frond of maiden's hair.    I hope nobody will write a letter to \"The Atlantic,\" to say that these  are very trifling uses. The communication of useful information is never  trifling. It is as important to save a nice child from mortification on  examination-day, as it is to tell Mr. Fremont that he is not elected  President. If, however, the reader is distressed, because these  illustrations do not seem to his more benighted observation to belong to  the big bow-wow strain of human life, let him consider the arrangement  which ought to have been made years since, for lee shores, railroad  collisions, and that curious class of maritime accidents where one  steamer runs into mother under the impression that she is a light  house. Imagine the Morse alphabet applied to a steam-whistle, which is  often heard five miles. It needs only _long_ and _short_ again. \"_Stop  Comet_,\" for instance, when you send it down the railroad line, by the  wire, is expressed thus:        ... -- . .  ....,...  . . -- ---  . --    Very good message, if Comet happens to be at the telegraph station when  it comes!

The  wind being at south, we were obliged to ply, and first stretched over for  the west shore, from which we were three miles at noon, when our latitude  was 14 deg. 55' 30\" S., longitude 167 deg. 3' E.; the mouth of the bay extending  from N. 64 deg. W., to S. 86 deg. E., which last direction was the bluff-head,  distant three leagues. In the afternoon the wind veering to E.S.E., we  could look up to the head of the bay; but as the breeze was faint, a N.E.  swell hurtled us over to the west shore; so that, at half past four o'clock  p.m., we were no more than two miles from it, and tacked in one hundred and  twenty fathoms water, a soft muddy bottom. The bluff-head, or east point of  the bay, bore north 53 deg. east.    We had no sooner tacked than it fell calm, and we were left to the mercy of  the swell, which continued to hurtle us towards the shore, where large  troops of people were assembled. Some ventured off in two canoes; but all  the signs of friendship we could make, did not induce them to come along-side,  or near enough to receive any present from us. At last they took  sudden fright at something, and returned ashore. They were naked, except  having some long grass, like flags, fastened to a belt, and hanging down  before and behind, nearly as low as the knee. Their colour was very dark,  and their hair woolly, or cut short, which made it seem so. The canoes  were small and had outriggers. The calm continued till near eight o'clock,  in which time we drove into eighty-five fathoms water, and so near the  shore that I expected we should be obliged to anchor. A breeze of wind  sprung up at E.S.E., and first took us on the wrong side; but, contrary to  all our expectations, and when we had hardly room to veer, the ship came  about, and having filled on the starboard tack, we stood off N.E. Thus we  were relieved from the apprehensions of being forced to anchor in a great  depth, on a lee shore, and in a dark and obscure night.    We continued to ply upwards, with variable light breezes between E.S.E. and  S., till ten next morning, when it fell calm. We were, at this time, about  seven or eight miles from the head of the bay, which is terminated by a low  beach; and behind that, is an extensive flat covered with wood, and bounded  on each side by a ridge of mountains. At noon we found the latitude to be  15 deg. 5' S., and were detained here by the calm till one o'clock p.m., when  we got a breeze at N. by W., with which we steered up to within two miles  of the head of the bay; and then I sent Mr Cooper and Mr Gilbert to sound  and reconnoitre the coast, while we stood to and fro with the ship. This  gave time to three sailing canoes which had been following us some time, to  come up. There were five or six men in each; and they approached near  enough to receive such things as were thrown to them fastened to a rope,  but would not advance alongside. They were the same sort of people as those  we had seen the preceding evening; indeed we thought they came from the  same place. They seemed to be stouter and better shaped men than those of  Mallicollo; and several circumstances concurred to make us think they were  of another nation. They named the numerals as far as five or six in the  language of Anamocka, and understood us when we asked the names of the  adjacent lands in that language. Some, indeed, had black short frizzled  hair like the natives of Mallicollo, but others had it long, tied up on the  crown of the head, and ornamented with feathers like the New Zealanders.  Their other ornaments were bracelets and necklaces; one man had something  like a white shell on his forehead, and some were painted with a blackish  pigment. I did not see that they had any other weapon but darts and gigs,  intended only for striking of fish. Their canoes were much like those of  Tanna, and navigated in the same manner, or nearly so. They readily gave us  the names of such parts as we pointed to; but we could not obtain from them  the name of the island. At length, seeing our boats coming, they paddled in  for the shore, notwithstanding all we could say or do to detain them.    When the boats returned, Mr Cooper informed me, that they had landed on the  beach which is at the head of the bay, near a fine river, or stream of  fresh water, so large and deep that they judged boats might enter it at  high water. They found three fathoms depth close to the beach, and fifty-five  and fifty, two cables' length off. Farther out they did not sound; and  where we were with the ship, we had no soundings with a hundred and seventy  fathoms line. Before the boats got on board, the wind had shifted to the  S.S.E. As we were in want of nothing, and had no time to spare, I took the  advantage of this shift of wind, and steered down the bay. During the  fore-part of the night, the country was illuminated with fires, from the  sea-shore to the summits of the mountains; but this was only on the west side  of the shore. I cannot pretend to say what was the occasion of these fires,  but have no idea of their being on our account. Probably, they were burning  or clearing the ground for new plantations. At day-break on the 27th, we  found ourselves two-thirds down the bay, and, as we had but little wind, it  was noon before we were the length of the N.W. point, which at this time  bore N. 82 deg. W., distant five miles. Latitude observed 14 deg. 39' 30\".    Some of our gentlemen were doubtful of this being the bay of St Philip and  St Jago, as there was no place which they thought could mean the port of  Vera Cruz. For my part I found general points to agree so well with  Quiros's description, that I had not the least doubt about it. As to what  he calls the Port of Vera Cruz, I understand that to be the anchorage at  the head of the bay, which in some places may extend farther off than where  our boats landed. There is nothing in his account of the port which  contradicts this supposition*. It was but natural for his people to give a  name to the place, independent of so large a bay, where they lay so long at  anchor. A port is a vague term, like many others in geography, and has been  very often applied to places far less sheltered than this.    [See Quiros's Voyage, in Dalrymple's Collection, vol i, p.136, 137.]    Our officers observed that grass and other plants grew on the beach close  to high water-mark, which is always a sure sign of pacific anchorage, and  an undeniable proof that there never is a great surf on the shore. They  judged that the tide rose about four or five feet, and that boats and such  craft might, at high-water, enter the river, which seemed to be pretty deep  and broad within; so that this, probably, is one of those mentioned by  Quiros; and if we were not deceived, we saw the other.    The bay hath twenty leagues sea-coast, six on the east side, which lies in  the direction of S. half W. and N. half E., two at the head, and twelve on  the west side, the direction of which is S. by E. and N. by W., from the  head down to two-thirds of its length, and then N.W. by N. to the N.W.  point. The two points which form the entrance, lie in the direction of S.  53 deg. E., and N. 53 deg. W., from each other, distant ten leagues. The bay is  every where free from danger, and of an unfathomable depth, except near the  shores, which are for the most part low. This, however, is only a very  narrow strip between the sea-shore and the foot of the hills; for the bay,  as well as the flat land at the head of it, is bounded on each side by a  ridge of hills, one of which, that to the west, is very high and double,  extending the whole length of the island. An uncommonly luxuriant  vegetation was every where to be seen; the sides of the hills were  chequered with plantations; and every valley watered by a stream. Of all  the productions of nature this country was adorned with, the cocoa-nut  trees were the most conspicuous. The columns of smoke we saw by day, and  fires by night all over the country, led us to believe that it is well  inhabited and very fertile. The east point of this bay, which I name Cape  Quiros, in memory of its first discoverer, is situated in latitude 14 deg. 56'  S., longitude 167 deg. 13' E. The N.W. point, which I named Cape Cumberland, in  honour of his Royal Highness the Duke, lies in the latitude of 14 deg. 38' 45\"  S., longitude 166 deg. 49' 1/2 E., and is the N.W. extremity of this  archipelago; for, after doubling it, we found the coast to trend gradually  round to the S. and S.S.E.    On the 28th and 29th, we had light airs and calms, so that we advanced but  little. In this time, we took every opportunity, when the horizon was  clearer than usual, to look out for more land, but none was seen. By  Quiros's track to the north, after leaving the bay above-mentioned, it  seems probable that there is none nearer than Queen Charlotte's Island,  discovered by Captain Carteret, which lies about ninety leagues N.N.W. from  Cape Cumberland, and I take to be the same with Quiros's Santa Cruz.    On the 30th, the calm was succeeded by a fresh breeze at S.S.E. which  enabled us to ply up the coast. At noon we observed in 15 deg. 20'; afterwards  we stretched in east, to within a mile of the shore, and then tacked in  seventy-five fathoms, before a sandy flat, on which several of the natives  made their appearance. We observed on the sides of the hills, several  plantations that were laid out by line, and fenced round.    On the 31st, at noon, the S. or S.W. point of the island bore N. 62 deg. E.,  distant four leagues. This forms the N.W. point of what I call  Bougainville's Passage; the N.E. point at this time bore N. 85 deg. E., and the  N.W. end of Mallicollo from S. 54 deg. E. to S. 72 deg. E. Latitude observed 15 deg.  45' S. In the afternoon, in stretching to the east, we weathered the S.S.W.  point of the"]]]
