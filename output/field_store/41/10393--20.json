Not smashed themselves up with those wings,  I hope?\"    \"No,\" said Robert; \"but the wings got us into a row, just like all the  wishes always do. So the others are kept indoors, and I was only let out  for half an hour--to get the wish. So please let me wish as quickly as I  can.\"    \"Wish away,\" said the Psammead, twisting itself round in the sand. But  Robert couldn't wish away. He forgot all the things he had been thinking  about, and nothing would come into his head but little things for  himself, like candy, a foreign stamp album, or a knife with three blades  and a corkscrew. He sat down to think better of things the others would  not have cared for--such as a football, or a pair of leg-guards, or to  be able to lick Simpkins Minor thoroughly when he went back to school.    \"Well,\" said the Psammead at last, \"you'd better hurry up with that wish  of yours. Time flies.\"    \"I know it does,\" said Robert. \"_I_ can't think what to wish for. I wish  you could give one of the others their wish without their having to  come here to ask for it. Oh, _don't_!\"    But it was too late. The Psammead had blown itself out to about three  times its proper size, and now it collapsed like a pricked bubble, and  with a deep sigh leaned back against the edge of the sand-pool, quite  faint with the effort.    \"There!\" it said in a weak voice; \"it was tremendously hard--but I did  it. Run along home, or they're sure to wish for something silly before  you get there.\"    They were--quite sure; Robert felt this, and as he ran home his mind was  deeply occupied with the sort of wishes he might find they had wished in  his absence. They might wish for rabbits, or white mice, or chocolate,  or a fine day to-morrow, or even--and that was most likely--someone  might have said, \"I do wish to goodness Robert would hurry up.\" Well, he  _was_ hurrying up, and so they would have had their wish, and the day  would be wasted. Then he tried to think what they could wish  for--something that would be amusing indoors. That had been his own  difficulty from the beginning. So few things are amusing indoors when  the sun is shining outside and you mayn't go out, however much you want  to do so.    Robert was running as fast as he could, but when he turned the corner  that ought to have brought him within sight of the architect's  nightmare--the ornamental iron-work on the top of the house--he opened  his eyes so wide that he had to drop into a walk; for you cannot run  with your eyes wide open. Then suddenly he stopped short, for there was  no house to be seen. The front garden railings were gone too, and where  the house had stood--Robert rubbed his eyes and looked again. Yes, the  others _had_ wished,--there was no doubt about it,--and they must have  wished that they lived in a castle; for there the castle stood, black  and stately, and very tall and broad, with battlements and lancet  windows, and eight great towers; and, where the garden and the orchard  had been, there were white things dotted like mushrooms. Robert walked  slowly on, and as he got nearer he saw that these were tents, and men in  armor were walking about among the tents--crowds and crowds of them.    [Illustration: There the castle stood, black and stately]    \"Oh!\" said Robert fervently. \"They _have_! They've wished for a castle,  and it's being besieged! It's just like that Sand-fairy! I wish we'd  never seen the beastly thing!\"    At the little window above the great gateway, across the moat that now  lay where the garden had been but half an hour ago, someone was waving  something pale dust-colored. Robert thought it was one of Cyril's  handkerchiefs. They had never been white since the day when he had upset  the bottle of \"Combined Toning and Fixing Solution\" into the drawer  where they were. Robert waved back, and immediately felt that he had  been unwise. For this signal had been seen by the besieging force, and  two men in steel-caps were coming towards him. They had high brown boots  on their long legs, and they came towards him with such great strides  that Robert remembered the shortness of his own legs and did not run  away. He knew it would be useless to himself, and he feared it might be  irritating to the foe. So he stood still--and the two men seemed quite  pleased with him.    \"By my halidom,\" said one, \"a brave varlet this!\"    Robert felt pleased at being _called_ brave, and somehow it made him  _feel_ brave. He passed over the \"varlet.\" It was the way people talked  in historical romances for the young, he knew, and it was evidently not  meant for rudeness. He only hoped he would be able to understand what  they said to him. He had not been always able quite to follow the  conversations in the historical romances for the young.    \"His garb is strange,\" said the other. \"Some outlandish treachery,  belike.\"    \"Say, lad, what brings thee hither?\"    Robert knew this meant, \"Now then, youngster, what are you up to here,  eh?\"--so he said--    \"If you please, I want to go home.\"    \"Go, then!\" said the man in the longest boots; \"none hindereth, and  nought lets us to follow. Zooks!\" he added in a cautious undertone, \"I  misdoubt me but he beareth tidings to the besieged.\"    \"Where dwellest thou, young knave?\" inquired the man with the largest  steel-cap.    \"Over there,\" said Robert; and directly he had said it he knew he ought  to have said \"Yonder!\"    \"Ha--sayest so?\" rejoined the longest boots. \"Come hither, boy. This is  matter for our leader.\"    And to the leader Robert was dragged forthwith--by the reluctant ear.    [Illustration: Robert was dragged forthwith--by the reluctant ear]    The leader was the most glorious creature Robert had ever seen. He was  exactly like the pictures Robert had so often admired in the historical  romances. He had armor, and a helmet, and a horse, and a crest, and  feathers, and a shield and a lance and a sword. His armor and his  weapons were all, I am almost sure, of quite different periods. The  shield was thirteenth century, while the sword was of the pattern  used in the Peninsular War. The cuirass was of the time of Charles I.,  and the helmet dated from the Second Crusade. The arms on the shield  were very grand--three red running lions on a blue ground. The tents  were of the latest brand approved of by our modern War Office, and the  whole appearance of camp, army, and leader might have been a shock to  some. But Robert was dumb with admiration, and it all seemed to him  perfectly correct, because he knew no more of heraldry or archaeology  than the gifted artists who usually drew the pictures for the historical  romances. The scene was indeed \"exactly like a picture.\" He admired it  all so much that he felt braver than ever.    \"Come hither, lad,\" said the glorious leader, when the men in  Cromwellian steel-caps had said a few low eager words. And he took off  his helmet, because he could not see properly with it on. He had a kind  face, and long fair hair. \"Have no fear; thou shalt take no scathe,\" he  said.    Robert was glad of that. He wondered what \"scathe\" was, and if it was  nastier than the medicine which he had to take sometimes.    \"Unfold thy tale without alarm,\" said the leader kindly. \"Whence comest  thou, and what is thine intent?\"    \"My what?\" said Robert.    \"What seekest thou to accomplish? What is thine errand, that thou  wanderest here alone among these rough men-at-arms? Poor child, thy  mother's heart aches for thee e'en now, I'll warrant me.\"    \"I don't think so,\" said Robert; \"you see, she doesn't know I'm out.\"    [Illustration: He wiped away a manly tear]    The leader wiped away a manly tear, exactly as a leader in a historical  romance would have done, and said--    \"Fear not to speak the truth, my child; thou hast nought to fear from  Wulfric de Talbot.\"    Robert had a wild feeling that this glorious leader of the besieging  party--being himself part of a wish--would be able to understand better  than Martha, or the gipsies, or the policeman in Rochester, or the  clergyman of yesterday, the true tale of the wishes and the Psammead.  The only difficulty was that he knew he could never remember enough  \"quothas\" and \"beshrew me's,\" and things like that, to make his talk  sound like the talk of a boy in a historical romance. However, he began  boldly enough, with a sentence straight out of _Ralph de Courcy; or, The  Boy Crusader_. He said--    \"Grammercy for thy courtesy, fair sir knight. The fact is, it's like  this--and I hope you're not in a hurry, because the story's rather a  breather. Father and mother are away, and when we went down playing in  the sand-pits we found a Psammead.\"    \"I cry thee mercy! A Sammyadd?\" said the knight.    \"Yes, a sort of--of fairy, or enchanter--yes, that's it, an enchanter;  and he said we could have a wish every day, and we wished first to be  beautiful.\"    \"Thy wish was scarce granted,\" muttered one of the men-at-arms, looking  at Robert, who went on as if he had not heard, though he thought the  remark very rude indeed.    \"And then we wished for money--treasure, you know; but we couldn't spend  it. And yesterday we wished for wings, and we got them, and we had a  ripping time to begin with\"--    \"Thy speech is strange and uncouth,\" said Sir Wulfric de Talbot. \"Repeat  thy words--what hadst thou?\"    \"A ripping--I mean a jolly--no--we were contented with our lot--that's  what I mean; only, after we got into an awful fix.\"    \"What is a fix? A fray, mayhap?\"    \"No--not a fray. A--a--a tight place.\"    \"A dungeon? Alas for thy youthful fettered limbs!\" said the knight, with  polite sympathy.    \"It wasn't a dungeon. We just--just encountered undeserved misfortunes,\"  Robert explained, \"and to-day we are punished by not being allowed to go  out. That's where I live,\"--he pointed to the castle. \"The others are in  there, and they're not allowed to go out. It's "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17321"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldea, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria in the Light of Recent (#17)"],[1,"at the Court of King Arthur. The interiors of  the later tombs are often decorated with reliefs which imitate those of  the early period, but with a kind of delicate grace which at once marks  them for what they are, so that it is impossible to confound them with  the genuine ancient originals from which they were adapted.    Riding from Sakkara southwards to Dashur, we pass on the way the  gigantic stone mastaba known as the _Mastabat el-Fara'un_, \"Pharaoh's  Bench.\" This was considered to be the tomb of the Vth Dynasty king,  Unas, until his pyramid was found by Prof. Maspero at Sakkara. From its  form it might be thought to belong to a monarch of the Hid Dynasty, but  the great size of the stone blocks of which it is built seems to point  rather to the XIIth. All attempts to penetrate its secret by actual  excavation have been unavailing.    Further south across the desert we see from the Mastabat el-Fara'un  four distinct pyramids, symmetrically arranged in two lines, two in each  line. The two to the right are great stone erections of the usual  type, like those of Giza and Abusir, and the southernmost of them has a  peculiar broken-backed appearance, due to the alteration of the angle  of inclination of its sides during construction. Further, it is covered  almost to the ground by the original casing of polished white limestone  blocks, so that it gives a very good idea of the original appearance  of the other pyramids, which have lost their casing. These two  pyramids very probably belong to kings of the Hid Dynasty, as does the  Step-Pyramid of Sakkara. They strongly resemble the Giza type, and  the northernmost of the two looks very like an understudy of the Great  Pyramid. It seems to mark the step in the development of the royal  pyramid which was immediately followed by the Great Pyramid. But no  excavations have yet proved the accuracy of this view. Both pyramids  have been entered, but nothing has been found in them. It is very  probable that one of them is the second pyramid of Snefru.    The other two pyramids, those nearest the cultivation, are of very  different appearance. They are half-ruined, they are black in colour,  and their whole effect is quite different from that of the stone  pyramids. For they are built of brick, not of stone. They are pyramids,  it is true, but of a different material and of a different date from  those which we have been describing. They are built above the sepulchres  of kings of the XIIth Dynasty, the Theban house which transferred  its residence northwards to the neighbourhood of the ancient Northern  capital. We have, in fact, reached the end of the Old Kingdom at  Sakkara; at Dashur begin the sepulchres of the Middle Kingdom. Pyramids  are still built, but they are not always of stone; brick is used,  usually with stone in the interior. The general effect of these brick  pyramids, when new, must have been indistinguishable from that of the  stone ones, and even now, when it has become half-ruined, such a great  brick pyramid as that of Usertsen (Senusret) III at Dashur is not  without impressiveness. After all, there is no reason why a brick  building should be less admirable than a stone one. And in its own way  the construction of such colossal masses of bricks as the two eastern  pyramids of Dashur must have been as arduous, even as difficult, as that  of building a moderate-sized stone pyramid. The photograph of the brick  pyramids of Dashur on this page shows well the great size of these  masses of brickwork, which are as impressive as any of the great brick  structures of Babylonia and Assyria.    [Illustration: 109.jpg EXTERIOR OF THE SOUTHERN BRICK PYRAMID OF DASHUR]         XIITH DYNASTY. Excavated by M. de Morgan, 1895. This is the       secondary tomb of Amenemhat III; about 2200 B.C.    The XIIth Dynasty use of brick for the royal tombs was a return to the  custom of earlier days, for from the time of Aha to that Tjeser, from  the 1st Dynasty to the Hid, brick had been used for the building of the  royal mastaba-tombs, out of which the pyramids had developed.    At this point, where we take leave of the great pyramids of the Old  Kingdom, we may notice the latest theory as to the building of these  monuments, which has of late years been enunciated by Dr. Borchardt, and  is now generally accepted. The great Prussian explorer Lepsius, when he  examined the pyramids in the 'forties, came to the conclusion that each  king, when he ascended the throne, planned a small pyramid for himself.  This was built in a few years' time, and if his reign were short, or if  he were unable to enlarge the pyramid for other reasons, it sufficed for  his tomb. If, however, his reign seemed likely to be one of some length,  after the first plan was completed he enlarged his pyramid by building  another and a larger one around it and over it. Then again, when this  addition was finished, and the king still reigned and was in possession  of great resources, yet another coating, so to speak, was put on to the  pyramid, and so on till colossal structures like the First and Second  Pyramid of Giza, which, we know, belonged to kings who were unusually  long-lived, were completed. And finally the aged monarch died, and was  buried in the huge tomb which his long life and his great power had  enabled him to erect. This view appeared eminently reasonable at the  time, and it seemed almost as though we ought to be able to tell whether  a king had reigned long or not by the size of his pyramid, and even  to obtain a rough idea of the length of his reign by counting the  successive coats or accretions which it had received, much as we tell  the age of a tree by the rings in its bole. A pyramid seemed to have  been constructed something after the manner of an onion or a Chinese  puzzle-box.    Prof. Petrie, however, who examined the Griza pyramids in 1881, and  carefully measured them all up and finally settled their trigonometrical  relation, came to the conclusion that Lepsius's theory was entirely  erroneous, and that every pyramid was built and now stands as it was  originally planned. Dr.    [Illustration: 111.jpg THE PYRAMIDS OF GIZA DURING THE INUNDATION.]    Borchardt, however, who is an architect by profession, has examined  the pyramids again, and has come to the conclusion that Prof. Petrie's  statement is not correct, and that there is an element of truth in  Lepsius's hypothesis. He has shown that several of the pyramids, notably  the First and Second at Giza, show unmistakable signs of a modified,  altered, and enlarged plan; in fact, long-lived kings like Khufu seem  to have added considerably to their pyramids and even to have entirely  remodelled them on a larger scale. This has certainly been the case with  the Great Pyramid. We can, then, accept Lepsius's theory as modified by  Dr. Borchardt.    Another interesting point has arisen in connection with the Great  Pyramid. Considerable difference of opinion has always existed between  Egyptologists and the professors of European archaeology with regard  to the antiquity of the knowledge of iron in Egypt. The majority of  the Egyptologists have always maintained, on the authority of the  inscriptions, that iron was known to the ancient Egyptians from the  earliest period. They argued that the word for a certain metal in old  Egyptian was the same as the Coptic word for \"iron.\" They stated that in  the most ancient religious texts the Egyptians spoke of the firmament  of heaven as made of this metal, and they came to the conclusion that it  was because this metal was blue in colour, the hue of iron or steel; and  they further pointed out that some of the weapons in the tomb-paintings  were painted blue and others red, some being of iron, that is to  say, others of copper or bronze. Finally they brought forward as  incontrovertible evidence an actual fragment of worked iron, which had  been found between two of the inner blocks, down one of the air-shafts,  in the Great Pyramid. Here was an actual piece of iron of the time of  the IVth Dynasty, about 3500 B.C.    This conclusion was never accepted by the students of the development of  the use of metal in prehistoric Europe, when they came to know of it.  No doubt their incredulity was partly due to want of appreciation of the  Egyptological evidence, partly to disinclination to accept a conclusion  which did not at all agree with the knowledge they had derived from  their own study of prehistoric Europe. In Southern Europe it was quite  certain that iron did not come into use till about 1000 B.C.; in Central  Europe, where the discoveries at Hallstatt in the Salzkammergut exhibit  the transition from the Age of Bronze to that of Iron, about 800 B.C.  The exclusively Iron Age culture of La Tene cannot be dated earlier than  the eighth century, if as early as that. How then was it possible that,  if iron had been known to the Egyptians as early as 3500 B.C., its  knowledge should not have been communicated to the Europeans until over  two thousand years later? No; iron could not have been really known to  the Egyptians much before 1000 B.C. and the Egyptological evidence was  all wrong. This line of argument was taken by the distinguished  Swedish archaeologist, Prof. Oscar Montelius, of Upsala, whose previous  experience in dealing with the antiquities of Northern Europe, great as  it was, was hardly sufficient to enable him to pronounce with authority  on a point affecting far-away African Egypt. And when dealing with Greek  prehistoric antiquities Prof. Montelius's views have hardly met with  that ready agreement which all acknowledge to be his due when he is  giving us the results of his ripe knowledge of Northern antiquities. He  has, in fact, forgotten, as most \"prehistoric\" archaeologists do forget,  that the antiquities of Scandinavia, Greece, Egypt, the Semites,  the bronze-workers of Benin, the miners of Zimbabwe, and the Ohio  mound-builders are not"]]]
