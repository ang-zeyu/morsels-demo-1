If so, let us not recoil before the absurd:  let us allow that the blindness of chance is gifted with marvellous  foresight.    The Praying Mantis commences her nest at the blunter extremity, and  completes it at the pointed tail. The latter is often prolonged in a  sort of promontory, in which the insect expends the last drop of  glutinous liquid as she stretches herself after her task. A sitting of  two hours, more or less, without interruption, is required for the total  accomplishment of the work. Directly the period of labour is over, the  mother withdraws, indifferent henceforth to her completed task. I have  watched her, half expecting to see her return, to discover some  tenderness for the cradle of her family. But no: not a trace of maternal  pleasure. The work is done, and concerns her no longer. Crickets  approach; one of them even squats upon the nest. The Mantis takes no  notice of them. They are peaceful intruders, to be sure; but even were  they dangerous, did they threaten to rifle the nest, would she attack  them and drive them away? Her impassive demeanour convinces me that she  would not. What is the nest to her? She is no longer conscious of it.    I have spoken of the many embraces to which the Praying Mantis submits,  and of the tragic end of the male, who is almost invariably devoured as  though a lawful prey. In the space of a fortnight I have known the same  female to adventure upon matrimony no less than seven times. Each time  the readily consoled widow devoured her mate. Such habits point to  frequent laying; and we find the appearance confirmed, though not as a  general rule. Some of my females gave me one nest only; others two, the  second as capacious as the first. The most fruitful of all produced  three; of these the two first were of normal dimensions, while the third  was about half the usual size.    From this we can reckon the productivity of the insect's ovaries. From  the transverse fissures of the median zone of the nest it is easy to  estimate the layers of eggs; but these layers contain more or fewer eggs  according to their position in the middle of the nest or near the ends.  The numbers contained by the widest and narrowest layers will give us  an approximate average. I find that a nest of fair size contains about  four hundred eggs. Thus the maker of the three nests, of which the last  was half as large as the others, produced no less than a thousand eggs;  eight hundred were deposited in the larger nests and two or three  hundred in the smaller. Truly a fine family, but a thought ungainly,  were it not that only a few of its members can survive.    Of a fair size, of curious structure, and well in evidence on its twig  or stone, the nest of the Praying Mantis could hardly escape the  attention of the Provencal peasant. It is well known in the country  districts, where it goes by the name of _tigno_; it even enjoys a  certain celebrity. But no one seems to be aware of its origin. It is  always a surprise to my rustic neighbours when they learn that the  well-known _tigno_ is the nest of the common Mantis, the _Prego-Dieu_.  This ignorance may well proceed from the nocturnal habits of the Mantis.  No one has caught the insect at work upon her nest in the silence of the  night. The link between the artificer and the work is missing, although  both are well known to the villager.    No matter: the singular object exists; it catches the eye, it attracts  attention. It must therefore be good for something; it must possess  virtue of some kind. So in all ages have the simple reasoned, in the  childlike hope of finding in the unfamiliar an alleviation of their  sorrows.    By general agreement the rural pharmacopoeia of Provence pronounces  the _tigno_ to be the best of remedies against chilblains. The method of  employment is of the simplest. The nest is cut in two, squeezed and the  affected part is rubbed with the cut surface as the juices flow from  it. This specific, I am told, is sovereign. All sufferers from blue and  swollen fingers should without fail, according to traditional usage,  have recourse to the _tigno_.    Is it really efficacious? Despite the general belief, I venture to doubt  it, after fruitless experiments on my own fingers and those of other  members of my household during the winter of 1895, when the severe and  persistent cold produced an abundant crop of chilblains. None of us,  treated with the celebrated unguent, observed the swelling to diminish;  none of us found that the pain and discomfort was in the least assuaged  by the sticky varnish formed by the juices of the crushed _tigno_. It is  not easy to believe that others are more successful, but the popular  renown of the specific survives in spite of all, probably thanks to a  simple accident of identity between the name of the remedy and that of  the infirmity: the Provencal for \"chilblain\" is _tigno_. From the moment  when the chilblain and the nest of the Mantis were known by the same  name were not the virtues of the latter obvious? So are reputations  created.    In my own village, and doubtless to some extent throughout the Midi, the  _tigno_--the nest of the Mantis, not the chilblain--is also reputed as a  marvellous cure for toothache. It is enough to carry it upon the person  to be free of that lamentable affection. Women wise in such matters  gather them beneath a propitious moon, and preserve them piously in some  corner of the clothes-press or wardrobe. They sew them in the lining of  the pocket, lest they should be pulled out with the handkerchief and  lost; they will grant the loan of them to a neighbour tormented by some  refractory molar. \"Lend me thy _tigno_: I am suffering martyrdom!\" begs  the owner of a swollen face.--\"Don't on any account lose it!\" says the  lender: \"I haven't another, and we aren't at the right time of moon!\"    We will not laugh at the credulous victim; many a remedy triumphantly  puffed on the latter pages of the newspapers and magazines is no more  effectual. Moreover, this rural simplicity is surpassed by certain old  books which form the tomb of the science of a past age. An English  naturalist of the sixteenth century, the well-known physician, Thomas  Moffat, informs us that children lost in the country would inquire their  way of the Mantis. The insect consulted would extend a limb, indicating  the direction to be taken, and, says the author, scarcely ever was the  insect mistaken. This pretty story is told in Latin, with an adorable  simplicity.          CHAPTER VIII    THE GOLDEN GARDENER.--ITS NUTRIMENT      In writing the first lines of this chapter I am reminded of the  slaughter-pens of Chicago; of those horrible meat factories which in the  course of the year cut up one million and eighty thousand bullocks and  seventeen hundred thousand swine, which enter a train of machinery alive  and issue transformed into cans of preserved meat, sausages, lard, and  rolled hams. I am reminded of these establishments because the beetle I  am about to speak of will show us a compatible celerity of butchery.    In a spacious, glazed insectorium I have twenty-five Carabi aurati. At  present they are motionless, lying beneath a piece of board which I gave  them for shelter. Their bellies cooled by the sand, their backs warmed  by the board, which is visited by the sun, they slumber and digest their  food. By good luck I chance upon a procession of pine-caterpillars, in  process of descending from their tree in search of a spot suitable for  burial, the prelude to the phase of the subterranean chrysalis. Here is  an excellent flock for the slaughter-house of the Carabi.    I capture them and place them in the insectorium. The procession is  quickly re-formed; the caterpillars, to the number of perhaps a hundred  and fifty, move forward in an undulating line. They pass near the piece  of board, one following the other like the pigs at Chicago. The moment  is propitious. I cry Havoc! and let loose the dogs of war: that is to  say, I remove the plank.    The sleepers immediately awake, scenting the abundant prey. One of them  runs forward; three, four, follow; the whole assembly is aroused; those  who are buried emerge; the whole band of cut-throats falls upon the  passing flock. It is a sight never to be forgotten. The mandibles of the  beetles are at work in all directions; the procession is attacked in the  van, in the rear, in the centre; the victims are wounded on the back or  the belly at random. The furry skins are gaping with wounds; their  contents escape in knots of entrails, bright green with their aliment,  the needles of the pine-tree; the caterpillars writhe, struggling with  loop-like movements, gripping the sand with their feet, dribbling and  gnashing their mandibles. Those as yet unwounded are digging desperately  in the attempt to take refuge underground. Not one succeeds. They are  scarcely half buried before some beetle runs to them and destroys them  by an eviscerating wound.    If this massacre did not occur in a dumb world we should hear all the  horrible tumult of the slaughter-houses of Chicago. But only the ear of  the mind can hear the shrieks and lamentations of the eviscerated  victims. For myself, I possess this ear, and am full of remorse for  having provoked such sufferings.    Now the beetles are rummaging in all directions through the heap of  dead and dying, each tugging and tearing at a morsel which he carries  off to swallow in peace, away from the inquisitive eyes of his fellows.  This mouthful disposed of, another is hastily cut from the body of some  victim, and the process is repeated so long as there are bodies left. In  a few minutes the procession is reduced to a few shreds of still  palpitating flesh.    There were a hundred and fifty caterpillars; the butchers were  twenty-five. This amounts to six victims dispatched by each beetle.
