The policy of territorial separation, which is now part of the law of  the Union of South Africa,[27] is the only policy that will make  possible a home existence for the Natives in their own homeland, for we  know that, however educated and however worthy the civilised Native may  become, he cannot hope to find a home, or to feel at home, among the  whites. Rightly or wrongly, the whites have banged, bolted and barred  their doors against the blacks, and neither moral worth nor educational  qualifications will serve to open them. But in their own areas the  Natives will have their own homes and their own home-life, without which  human existence is indeed miserable. Those among them who long for the  privilege of private ownership will be able to acquire land in freehold  in localities set aside therefor, while those who cling to the old ways  will be allowed to continue as before under their old system of communal  land tenure.    With freedom of movement and action under a minimum of European  supervision and control the Natives will, in their own areas, have full  opportunity and scope for the development of a home-civilisation of  their own along lines similar to, if not identical with, those by which  the Europeans follow their separate ways. It is a heroic plan, and it  will demand great sacrifice from both peoples, but who can doubt that  the end will be worth the effort? The Natives may in some places have to  leave the land where their ancestors are buried, and the whites will, in  many places, have to accept the price of expropriation for land and  houses hallowed and made precious by effort and memories, but the great  general gain at the end will undoubtedly be worth all that must be  surrendered now. This policy is the only one that holds out hope of  peace and happiness for both races. If the fears and objections that are  being raised by a few Natives and by individual Europeans here and there  are allowed to frustrate this, the only practical plan so far devised,  the future generations of both white and black in South Africa will  assuredly curse the day their fathers wavered and failed to make the  only just and fair provision that could be made.    To those, who for religious reasons feel doubtful about the  righteousness of a plan that denies to the Natives the privilege of  social equality which is implied in the ideal of the brotherhood of man,  I would quote the words of Paul who, when speaking at Athens of the  separation of the sons of Adam, said that God \"hath made of one blood  all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath  determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their  habitations,\"[28] for, whether we take this statement to be the inspired  utterance of a holy apostle, or simply the reasoned opinion of an acute  observer, we must admit that the words convey the experience of the ages  that races which are physically dissimilar tend naturally, and  therefore, rightly, to dwell apart within their respective racial  boundaries.    Some people have professed to be afraid that the territorial separation  of the two races will tend to consolidate the Natives, and thereby  foster animosity towards the whites which may eventually lead to open  war, but this fear seems to have no ground in reason, because it is not  proposed, nor, indeed, would it be physically possible, to segregate the  Natives by themselves in one great area. On the contrary, it is proposed  to dispose of the Natives, as far as possible, according to present  geographical and tribal conditions, in several and separate territories,  so that race-consolidation of a kind inimical to the whites will  naturally be less likely to occur where the Natives live as separate  tribes, speaking their different languages, than where, as in the  Southern States of America, the Negroes have English as a common medium  for the expression of a common race-interest.    Other people, again, are in doubt as to whether the Natives, as a whole,  approve of this policy by which their future existence is to be shaped  and determined. The answer is contained in the words of Sir William  Beaumont, in his report of the findings of the Native Lands Commission,  which gathered evidence from all concerned in 1916, where he says \"The  great mass of the Native population in all parts of the Union are  looking to the Act (the Act providing for territorial separation) to  relieve them in two particulars--the first is to give them more land for  their stock, and the second is to secure to them fixity of tenure.\"[29]  Regarding the Natives of Rhodesia I am able to say that all the elderly  Native men with whom I have spoken about this subject--and I have  conversed with a large number--agree that the policy, as outlined in the  Native Lands Act and the Native Affairs Act of 1920, as I have explained  it to them, is good and sound.    It is true that certain prominent Natives of the educated class have  protested strongly against this policy, but it is not true that these  men have spoken on behalf of the Natives as a whole; indeed, it is safe  to say that the vast bulk of the Natives of South Africa have even now  no clear knowledge of the legislation that has been made recently in the  pursuance of this policy. The protests that have been made from the  Native side, moreover, have been directed against the hardship caused  through harshness in carrying out the Act in certain places, and against  the relative smallness of the areas proposed for Native occupation, and  not against the principle itself, and there can be no doubt that the  statement quoted from the Report of the Native Lands Commission conveys  the true feeling of the large majority of the Natives.    These are some of the objections that have been raised to the policy of  territorial separation, but the gravest danger to the successful working  of that policy remains to be mentioned. It is the possibility that the  cupidity of the whites may lead them to remove their black neighbour's  landmarks in the event of the discovery of new fields of gold or other  valuable minerals within the Native areas. The danger of such a lapse  from the righteousness that exalteth a nation can only be averted by the  constant exercise of the public conscience of the whites themselves.    No reasonable person will expect that this policy will do away entirely  with all the little troubles that arise from the clashing of opposite  racial interests. In the white areas the Native, who can come there only  as a labourer or visitor, not as a settler, will remain subordinate to  the whites, but his unavoidable competition in trade and industry may  nevertheless lead to friction now and then, and the continuance of the  present pin-prick policy of enforcing humiliating pass-laws and similar  racial restrictions will certainly lead to trouble. But if tolerance and  honesty prevail in our councils we shall be able to adjust and settle  the many questions that are bound to arise from time to time through the  juxtaposition in the industrial field of the two immiscible elements.    But I must come to an end. I have tried to show that there is good  reason for accepting the Bantu as the equals of Europeans in every  respect save past achievement, but that because of unalterable physical  disparity, and not because of any mental inequality, the whites and the  blacks cannot live in peace and good-will together in one place,  wherefore it follows, as a necessary conclusion, that territorial  separation is the only way to lasting peace and happiness in South  Africa. I say, therefore, that the black man's place in his own country  must be assigned not below, nor above, but apart from that of the white  man, for that which nature has made separate man may not join together.  I have endeavoured also to show that there is good reason for believing  the Bantu to be no less capable of adopting and adapting Western  civilisation than other races which in the past have risen from rude  barbarism to high culture, but here I admit that the full proof of my  belief must be given by the Natives themselves.    The difficulties in the way are many and serious, but if we of the  power-holding race remain true to the great principles of justice and  fairness which have guided our forefathers in their upward path we shall  not go astray. So long as we remember the lesson of history voiced in  the saying of the Romans \"As many slaves so many enemies\" we shall  refrain from the means of repression which have always reacted adversely  on the repressors; we shall realise that we cannot set artificial  barriers in the way of the civilised Native if he proves that he has the  capacity for going higher and the will to try, and we shall learn to  treat him, not as a slave, nor as a child, nor yet as a brother in the  house, but as a man. The Natives can in fairness demand no more, the  whites can in fairness yield no less.            _Printed by_ CAPE TIMES, LTD., _Cape Town_.--S6420.             *       *       *       *       *      FOOTNOTES      [1] Article on Anthropology in Nelson's Encyclopaedia.

Do you remember it, papa? And this Christmas day when he gave it to  me? the first Christmas that you were with me.\"    She was holding up a tiny gold thimble.    \"Yes, I think I do,\" he said. \"I certainly remember the day, the first  Christmas after my return from Europe, the first on which I heard myself  addressed as papa--the sweetest of child voices calling me that, and  wishing me a merry Christmas, as the dearest, loveliest of little girls  ran into my arms. Dear daughter, what a priceless treasure you have been  to me ever since!\" he added, bending over her and softly smoothing her  hair. \"It has always been a joy to call you mine.\"    She caught his hand in hers and pressed it to her lips. \"Yes, dear, dear  father! and to me to be so called. We loved one another very dearly then,  each was all the other had, and I think our mutual love has never been  less because of the other many tender ties God has given us since.\"    \"I am sure you are right, daughter, but at that time,\" he added with a  smile, \"you were not willing to share your father's love with another; at  least with one other whom you suspected of trying to win it. Do you  remember how you slipped away to your bed without bidding your papa  good-night, and cried yourself to sleep?\"    \"Yes, foolish child that I was!\" she said, with a low musical laugh; \"and  how you surprised me the next morning by your knowledge of my fears, and  then set them all at rest, like the dear, kind father that you were and  always have been.\"    \"No, not always,\" he sighed.    \"Yes, papa, always,\" she said with playful tenderness. \"I will insist upon  that; because even when most severe with me, you did what at the time you  deemed your duty, and believed to be for my good.\"    \"Yes, that is true, my dear, forgiving child! and yet I can never think of  the suffering you endured during the summer that succeeded the Christmas  we have been talking of, without keen remorse.\"    \"Yet, long before the next Christmas came I was happier than ever,\" she  said, looking up into his face with a smile full of filial love. \"It was  the first in our own dear home at the Oaks, you remember, papa. You gave  me a lovely set of pearls--necklace and bracelets--and this,\" taking up a  pearl ring, \"was Edward's gift. Mr. Travilla he was to me then, and no  thought of one day becoming his wife even so much as entered my head. But  years afterward he told me he had it in his mind even then; had already  resolved to wait till I grew up and win me for his wife if he could.\"    \"Yes, he told me after you were grown and he had offered himself, that it  had been love at first sight with him, little child that you were when he  first made your acquaintance. That surprised me, though less than the  discovery that you fancied one so many years your senior.\"    \"But so good, so noble, so lovable!\" she said. \"Surely, it was not half so  strange, papa, as that he should fancy a foolish young thing such as I was  then; not meaning that I am yet very greatly improved,\" she added, with a  half tearful smile.    \"I am fully satisfied with you just as you are,\" he said, bending down  over her and touching his lips two or three times to her forehead, \"My  darling, my first-born and best-beloved child! no words can express the  love and tenderness I feel for you, or my pity for the grief which is  beyond my power to relieve.\"    \"Dear papa, your sympathy is very sweet,\" she said in tremulous tones,  \"very, very sweet in itself, and it helps me to a fuller realization of  the depth of meaning in those sweet words, 'Like as a father pitieth his  children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.'\"    \"You cannot be wholly miserable while that precious love and pity are  yours, my dear child, even if all earthly loves should be taken from you,  which may God forbid should ever happen.\"    \"No, papa; dearly as I loved my husband, I am happy in that divine love  still mine, though parted from him; and dearly as I love you and my  children, I know that were you all taken from me, I could still rejoice in  the love of Him who died for me, and who has said, 'I am with you alway,  even unto the end of the world.' 'I will never leave thee nor forsake  thee.' 'I have loved thee with an everlasting love.'\"    Silence fell between them for some moments, both seemingly wrapped in  thought; then Mr. Dinsmore said inquiringly, \"You will go to Roselands  to-morrow?\"    \"Yes, papa, if you go, as I heard you say you intended, and nothing  happens to prevent. Rosie was particularly delighted with Cal's  invitation,\" she added, smiling up at him, \"because I had been telling the  story of those Christmas holidays that we have been discussing, to her and  the other children, and naturally she wants to look upon the scene of all  those important events.\"    \"It will not be by any means her first visit to Roselands,\" he remarked in  a tone of surprise.    \"Oh, no, sir! only the first after hearing of those interesting episodes  in her mother's life.\"    \"But the house is not the same.\"    \"No, sir; yet the hall and parlors, your rooms and mine are about where  and what they were in the old house.\"    \"Ah! well I hope Rosie will enjoy it. And that you may do so, I shall  leave you now, begging you to go at once to bed. Good-night, daughter.\"    \"Good-night, my dearest, best of fathers,\" she responded, putting her arms  round his neck as he stooped to give her a parting caress.    Calhoun and Arthur Conly were now joint proprietors at Roselands. \"Aunt  Maria,\" an old negress born and bred on the estate, was their housekeeper,  and managed so well that they found themselves as comfortable as in the  days of their mother's administration.    They, with one younger sister and brother, were all of the once large  family now left to occupy the old home, and these younger two were there  now only for the Christmas holidays, and at their close would return to  distant boarding-schools. Ella, the sister, was eighteen; Ralph two years  younger.    The house whence the mother and grandfather had been carried out to their  last long home but a few months before, could not be made the scene of  mirth and jollity, but to a day of quiet social intercourse with near and  dear relatives and friends none could object; so the family at Ion had  been invited to dine there the next day, and had accepted the invitation.    Lulu had been greatly interested in Grandma Elsie's party of children as  it told of had been invited to Ion for these holidays; but she did not  covet such a father as Mr. Dinsmore; he was much too strict and severe,  she thought, with all his petting and caressing, and she would far rather  have her own papa. Still Grandma Elsie's lot, when a little girl, seemed  to her an enviable one, so beautiful and so rich, and with a nice old  mammy always ready to wait on and do everything for her; and she (Lulu)  was sure she wouldn't have minded much when such a father as Mr. Dinsmore  was vexed with her; he wouldn't have found it so easy to manage her; no  indeed! She almost thought she should enjoy trying her strength in a tilt  with him even now.    Lulu was a rebel by nature, and ever found it difficult to combat the  inclination to defy authority and assert her entire independence of  control.    But fortunately this inclination was in great measure counterbalanced by  the warmth of her affections. She was ready to love all who treated her  with justice and kindness, and her love for her father was intense. To  please him she would do or endure almost anything; that more than any  other influence had kept her on her good behavior all these weeks.    She had sometimes rebelled inwardly, but there had been no greater  outward show of it than a frown or a pout, which soon vanished under the  kind and gentle treatment she received at the hands of Grandma Elsie and  Mamma Vi.    Captain Raymond would have been much gratified could he have seen how, not  only she, but all his children, were improving morally, mentally and  physically in the wholesome atmosphere of their new home.    Gracie had gained largely in strength and vivacity, her cheeks were  rounder and rosier than when she came to Ion, her eyes brighter; and  though not yet equal to violent exercise, she could enjoy quiet plays, and  would often laugh right merrily.    She had grown very fond of Dr. Conly, or Cousin Arthur as he told her to  call him, and he of his little patient. She was frequently hovering about  him during Christmas day; and received a special invitation to Roselands.    \"You and your mamma are to be my particular guests,\" he said, \"and if you  fail to enjoy yourselves it shall be from no fault of mine.\"    \"We shall not fail,\" Violet said with confidence. \"How could we with Cal  and yourself for our hosts?\"    The day proved propitious, all went and all enjoyed their visit, though to  the older ones there was at first a feeling of subdued sadness in  thinking of the old grandfather, whose chair was now vacant, and who had  been wont to greet their coming with words of cordial welcome.    It was after dinner that Rose claimed her mother's promise.    \"Well,\" said Elsie, glancing dreamily about, \"this parlor where we are all  sitting occupies the same part of the house, and is almost exactly like  the one where the scenes I told you of took place.\"    \"What scenes?\" asked Dr. Conly, drawing near, with a look of interest.    Mr. Dinsmore, too, turned to listen.    \"I have been telling the children about the Christmas holidays at  Roselands the first winter after my father's return from Europe,\" she  answered. \"It was before you were born, Cousin Arthur, while your mother  was still a very young girl.\"    \"Mamma,\" asked Rosie, \"where was grandpa sitting when"]]]
