The British  people, on the contrary, were entering upon a further stage of  democratic evolution at home, and, under the influence of new liberal  and humanitarian doctrines, their sympathies were going out abroad to  every down-trodden nationality that was struggling, whether in Greece or  in South America, to throw off the yoke of oppressive despotisms. Their  growing sense of responsibility towards alien races which they  themselves held in subjection was manifested most conspicuously in the  generous movement which resulted in the abolition of slavery in our West  Indian Colonies. It could not fail to be extended also to India. Under  Lord Hastings British dominion had again rapidly expanded between 1813  and 1823, when he left it firmly established from the extreme south to  the Sutlej in the north. Then ten years of internal and external peace  had followed in which the educational labours, chiefly in Bengal, of a  generation of great missionaries began not only to meet with unexpected  reward in India itself, but also to stir the public mind at home to new  aspects of a mission which came to be regarded as providential, and to  the moral duties which it imposed upon us in return for the material  advantages to be derived from political dominion. Some of our great  administrators in India were themselves beginning to look forward to a  time, however far distant, when we should have made the people of India  capable of self-government--not yet, of course, on the lines now  contemplated, since even in Great Britain self-government was not  established then on a broad popular basis. As early as 1824 Sir Thomas  Munro, then Governor of Madras, raised in an official minute the \"one  great question to which we should look in all our arrangements: What is  to be their final result on the character of the people?\" The following  passage in that remarkable document may be commended to our  faint-hearted doubters of to-day:         Liberal treatment has always been found the most effectual way of       elevating the character of any people, and we may be sure that it       will produce a similar effect on that of the people of India. The       change will no doubt be slow, but that is the very reason why no       time should be lost in commencing the work. We should not be       discouraged by difficulties, nor, because little progress may be       made in our own time, abandon the enterprise as hopeless, and       charge upon the obstinacy and bigotry of the nations the failure       occasioned by our own fickleness in not pursuing steadily the only       line of conduct on which any hope of success can be reasonably       founded. We should make the same allowances for the Hindus as for       other nations and consider how slow the progress of improvement has       been among the nations of Europe and through what a long course of       barbarous ages they had to pass before they attained their present       state. When we compare other countries with England, we usually       speak of England as she now is. We scarcely ever think of going       back beyond the Reformation, and we are apt to regard every foreign       nation as ignorant and uncivilised, whose state of government does       not in some degree approximate to our own, even should it be higher       than our own was at no distant date.         We should look upon India not as a temporary possession but as one       to be maintained permanently until the natives shall in some future       age have abandoned most of their superstitions and prejudices and       become sufficiently enlightened to frame a regular government for       themselves and to conduct and preserve it. Whenever such a time       shall arrive it will probably be best for both countries that the       British control over India should be gradually withdrawn. That the       desirable change contemplated may in some after age be effected in       India there is no cause to despair. Such a change was at one time       in Britain itself at least as hopeless as it is here. When we       reflect how much the character of nations has always been       influenced by that of governments, and that some, once the most       cultivated, have sunk into barbarism, while others, formerly the       rudest, have attained the highest point of civilisation, we shall       see no reason to doubt that if we pursue steadily the proper       measures, we shall in time so far improve the character of our       Indian subjects as to enable them to govern and protect themselves.    It was a splendid vision for a great British administrator to have  entertained nearly one hundred years ago, though, with no self-governing  Dominions in those days to point a better way, the only possibility that  could occur to Munro's mind in the event of its fulfilment was an  amicable but complete severance of our connection with India; and it is  well to be reminded of the faith that was already in him and not a few  other experienced and broad-minded Englishmen in India as well as at  home, now that many of us are inclined to contemplate only with  scepticism and apprehension an approach to its fulfilment on the new  lines which the evolution of the British Empire and of democratic  government throughout all its component parts, neither of which could  then be foreseen, have in the meantime suggested.    Indians were at that time already employed in large numbers in the  Company's services, but only in subordinate posts, for which in most  cases their educational backwardness alone fitted them, and only as an  act of grace on the part of their British rulers. Parliament had  recognised the right of the Indian people to expect from us the benefits  of good and honest government--perhaps as a duty which we owed to  ourselves as much as to them--but it had not yet risen to a recognition  of their right to any active share in the government of their country.    One of the first questions to come before the new Parliament elected  after the great Reform Bill was that of the renewal of the Company's  charter in 1833. The Parliamentary Committee appointed to inquire and  report on the subject struck a new note when it laid distinct stress on  the Indian point of view. It admitted frankly that \"Indians were alive  to the grievance of being excluded from a larger share in the executive  government,\" and proceeded to state that in its opinion ample evidence  had been given to show \"that such exclusion is not warranted on the  score of their own incapacity for business or the want of application or  trustworthiness.\" Accordingly, when the Charter was renewed, Parliament  laid it down that \"no native of the said Indian territories, nor any  natural British-born subject of His Majesty resident therein, shall by  reason only of his religion, place of birth, descent, colour, or any of  them be disabled from holding any place, office, or employment under the  Company.\" This was the first substantial promise given to India that  British rule was not to spell merely the unqualified dominion, however  beneficent, of alien rulers. It invited the co-operation of the subject  race, instead of merely postulating unconditional submission. It  heralded at the same time the introduction of Western education, without  which the promise would have been empty.    The problem of Indian education had occupied the minds of far-sighted  Englishmen from the days of Warren Hastings, who had been the first to  provide out of the Company's funds for the maintenance of indigenous  educational institutions, and it had been definitely provided in the  renewal of the Charter in 1813 that the Company should set aside a  certain portion of its revenues to be spent annually upon education. But  long delays had been caused by an interminable and fierce controversy  over the rival merits of the vernaculars and of English as the more  suitable vehicle for the diffusion of education. The champions of  English were much encouraged by the immediate success which attended the  opening of an English school in Calcutta in 1830 by Dr. Alexander Duff,  a great missionary who was convinced that English education could alone  win over India to Christianity, and Macaulay's famous Minute of March 7,  1835, disfigured as it is by the quite unmerited and ignorant scorn  which he poured out on Oriental learning with his customary  self-confidence, finally turned the scales in favour of the adoption of  English as essential to the spread of Western education. One of the  immediate objects in view--and incidentally as a measure of economy--was  undoubtedly the training of Indians, and in much larger numbers, for the  more efficient performance of the work allotted to them in the  administrative and judicial services of the Company. But if Macaulay was  quite wrong in imagining that Western education would assimilate Indians  to Englishmen in everything but their complexions, he was by no means  blind to the larger implications of the new departure he was advocating.  Like other great Englishmen of his day, he believed that good government  and, still less, mere dominion were not the only ends to which our  efforts should be directed. \"It may be,\" he declared, \"that the public  mind of India may expand under our system until it has outgrown that  system; that by good government we may educate our subjects into a  capacity for better government; that having become instructed in  European knowledge they may, in some future age, demand European  institutions. Whether such a day will ever come, I know not. But never  will I attempt to avert or retard it. Whenever it comes, it will be the  proudest day in English history.\"    Peace and law and order British rule had restored to India, and its  foremost purpose henceforth, as set forth by Lord William Bentinck, a  great Governor-General, imbued with the progressive spirit of the best  Englishmen in India, to which Parliament had given a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15604"],[0,"Piano Mastery: Talks with Master Pianists and Teachers (#17)"],[1,"also  lives in the newer western portion of the city, where so many other  artists are located. One feels on entering the spacious rooms that this  home has the true German atmosphere. Adele Aus der Ohe, whose  personality is well remembered in America, on account of her various  pianistic tours, now wears her brown hair softly drawn down over her  ears, in Madonna fashion, a mode which becomes her vastly.    \"My time is divided between playing in concert, composing, and my own  studies,\" began the artist. \"I give almost no lessons, for I have not  time for them. I never have more than a couple of pupils studying with  me at one time; they must be both talented and eager. The amount of time  I consider necessary for practise depends, of course, on quickness of  comprehension. In general, I may say four, or at most five hours are  quite sufficient, If used with absolute concentration. The quality of  practise is the great essential. If the passage under consideration is  not understood, a thousand times going over it will be only vain  repetitions; therefore, understand the construction and meaning of the  passage in the beginning, and then a thousand repetitions ought to make  it perfect.    \"There is so much practise which can be done away from the instrument,  by reading the notes from the printed page and thinking about them. Is  this understood in America? Always _listen_ to your playing, to every  note you make on the piano; I consider this point of the very first  importance. My pupils are generally well advanced or are those who  intend making music a profession. I have, however, occasionally taken a  beginner. This point of listening to every note, of training the ear,  should stand at the very foundation.      LETTING THE HAND FIND ITSELF    \"In regard to hand position, I endeavor not to be narrow and pedantic.  If pupils play with good tone and can make reasonably good effects, I  take them, at the point where they are and try to bring them forward,  even if the hand position is not just what I would like. If I stop  everything and let them do nothing but hand position, they will be  discouraged and think they are beginning all over again. This beginning  again is sometimes detrimental. To take a pupil at his present point,  and carry him along was also Liszt's idea. He did not like to change a  hand position to which the player has grown accustomed for one which  seems unnatural, and which the pianist has to work a long time to  acquire. He felt that one's time could be spent to more advantage. There  are so many legitimate positions, each hand is a separate study, and is  apt to take the position most natural to itself.    \"I shall play numerous concerts and recitals in Europe the coming  season, but shall not be in America. I know your country well as I have  made several tours and have lived there. I left it the last time under  sad circumstances, as my sister, who always accompanied me, had just  passed away after quite a long illness. So you see I have not much zest  to return.    \"However I am fond of America, and admire the great progress you are  making in music and art. And you have the courage of your convictions;  you do not admire a musical work simply because some one else says you  should, or the critics tell you to. You do not ask your neighbor's  opinion before you applaud it. If you do not like it you are not afraid  to say so. Even when it is only ragtime that pleases you, you are not  afraid to own up to it. When you learn what is better you say so. It Is  this honesty which leads to progressive results. You are rapidly  becoming competent to judge what is best. I have found the most  appreciative audiences in America.\"    Miss Aus der Ohe had much to relate of the Woman's Lyceum. The  Department of Music was founded by Aus der Ohe herself. Not long ago  there was an exhibition of woman's work in music. Women composers from  all over the country sent examples of their work. Our own Mrs. H.A.A.  Beach, who has been located for some time in Munich, was well  represented. There are branches of this institution in other German  cities.    Several paintings of large size and striking originality hang on the  walls of the pianist's home. They all illustrate religious themes and  are the work of Herr Aus der Ohe, the pianist's only brother, who passed  away at the height of his career.    \"Yes,\" said the composer, \"my mother, brother and sister have been taken  away, since I was last in America, and now I am quite alone; but I have  my art.\"          XIX    ELEANOR SPENCER    MORE LIGHT ON LESCHETIZKY'S IDEAS      Eleanor Spencer, whose first American tour is announced for the coming  season, happened to be in Berlin during my visit there. I found her in  her charming apartments in the Schoenberg section of the city, far away  from the noise and bustle of traffic. Her windows look out upon a wide  inner court and garden, and she seems to have secured the quiet,  peaceful environment so essential to an artist's development. Indeed  Miss Spencer has solved the problems of how to keep house, with all the  comforts of an American home, in a great German city.    \"I grew so tired of living in _pensions_ that I took this little  apartment over two years ago,\" she said, \"and I like it so much better.    \"I have been away from America for nine years, so the foreign cities  where I have lived seem almost more like home to me than my native land,  to which I have only paid two short visits during those nine years. But  I love America, and perhaps you can imagine how eagerly I am looking  forward to my coming tour.    \"The first eight years of my life were spent in Chicago, and then my  family moved to New York. Here I studied with Dr. William Mason. When I  was about fifteen I went to Europe for further study, and although I had  another master at first, it was not so very long before I went to  Vienna, to Leschetizky, for I felt the need of more thorough preparation  than I had yet had. There is nothing like a firm technical foundation;  it is a rock to build upon; one cannot do great things without it. I  have had to labor hard for what I have attained, and am not ashamed to  say so. I practise 'all my spare time,' as one of my colleagues  expresses it; though, of course, if one studies with the necessary  concentration one cannot practise more than five hours to advantage.    [Illustration: To Miss Brower in appreciation and pleasant remembrance  of our Berlin meeting ...ELEANOR SPENCER]    \"I thoroughly believe in practising technic outside of pieces; I have  always done so and still continue to do it. This brings the hand into  condition, and keeps it up to the mark, so that difficult compositions  are more readily within the grasp, and the technical requirements in  them are more easily met. When the hand is in fine condition, exhaustive  technical practise in pieces is not necessary, and much wear and tear of  nerve force is saved. In this technical practise, to which I give an  hour or more daily, I use very simple exercises, but each one contains  some principle of touch, movement or condition. Hand over thumb and  thumb under hand; different qualities of tone; staccato or clinging  touch; scales, arpeggios and various other forms are used. Part of the  technic study period is always given to Bach.    \"I began my studies in Vienna with Mme. Bree, to get the preparatory  foundation, but before long combined her lessons with those of the  professor, and later went to him entirely.\"    \"Just here I should like to mention a trifling point, yet it seems one  not understood in America by those who say they are teachers of the  Leschetizky method. These teachers claim that the professor wishes the  fingers placed on a straight line at the edge of the keys, and in some  cases they place the tip of the thumb in the middle of its key, so that  it extends considerably beyond the tips of the other fingers. Is this  the position taught by the _Vorbereiters_, or favored by Leschetizky?\"    Miss Spencer's laugh rang out merrily.    \"This is the first I have ever heard of the idea! Such a position must  seem very strained and unnatural. Leschetizky, on the contrary, wishes  everything done in the most easy, natural way. Of course, at first, when  one is seeking to acquire strength and firmness of hand and fingers, one  must give time and thought to securing an arched hand and steady first  joints of fingers. Later, when these conditions have been thoroughly  established, the hand can take any position required. Leschetizky's hand  often lies quite flat on the keys. He has a beautiful piano hand; the  first joints of the fingers have so long been held firmly curved, that  they always keep their position, no matter what he is doing; if he only  passes his fingers through his hair, his hand is in shape.    \"Leschetizky is indeed a wonderful teacher! The player, however, must  divine how to be receptive, how to enter into the master's thought, or  it may go hard with him. If he does not understand, nor grasp the  master's words he may suffer terribly during the ordeal of the lessons.  I have witnessed such scenes! Those who are equal to the situation  receive most illuminative instruction.    \"I trust I do not give you the impression of being so devoted to, and  enthusiastic in, the work I enjoyed with my venerated master that I wish  to exclude other masters and schools. I think narrowness one of the most  unpleasant of traits, and one I should dread to be accused of. I see so  much good in others, _their_ ways and ideas, that, to me, all things  great and beautiful in art seem very closely related.      MEMORIZING    \"How do I memorize a composition? I first play it over a few times to  become somewhat familiar with its form and shape. Then I begin to  analyze and study it, committing it by phrases, or _ideas_, one or two  measures at a time. I do not always take each hand alone, unless very"]]]
