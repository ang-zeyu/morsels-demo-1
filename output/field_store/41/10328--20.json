We used the International Telegraph  Code, which we had been studying every evening for a week, but it was  many weeks before we learned how to use it correctly, even slowly. The  International Telegraph Code is as follows:    A .-  B -...  C -.-.  D -..  E .  F ..-.  G --. H ....  I ..  J .---  K -.-  L .-..  M --  N -.  O ---  P .--.  Q --.-  R .-.  S ...  T -  U ..-  V ...-  W .--  X -..-  Y -.--  Z --..  1 .----  2 ..---  3 ...--  4 ....-  5 .....  6 -....  7 --...  8 ---..  9 ----.  0 -----    The three short flashes Bill sent represented the letter S, which stood  for the word \"signal.\" A was formed by a short flash followed by a long  flash; B by a long flash followed by three short ones, and so on. The  key was held down three times as long for the long flash as for the  short one. We found the best way of learning to send the signals  properly was to count 1 for each short flash, and for each pause between  parts of the letter, and 3 for each dash and for each pause between  letters. Between words we counted 6. Thus, for the letter A the key  would be down when we counted 1, up when we counted 2, down while we  counted 3, 4, 5, and up while we counted 6, 7, 8, for the pause after  each letter. It was rather a confusing code, I admit, but in time we  mastered it, all but Reddy and Fred, who never would learn, but instead  used the wigwag code, letting a short flash stand for 1, a long flash  for 2 and a double long flash for 3.      THE DOUBLE MIRROR INSTRUMENT.    [Illustration: Fig. 161. The Double Mirror Instrument.]    [Illustration: Fig. 162. Top View, showing position of the Two Mirrors  and the Screen.]    Our heliographing instrument did excellent service sending flashes from  the cliff to the island, but we couldn't make it work very well sending  messages from the island to the cliff, because we had to face almost due  north, and then the sun was nearly always at our backs and couldn't  shine squarely on the mirror. This led to our building a double mirrored  heliograph the following summer. To begin with, we built an instrument  which was the exact duplicate of our first heliograph; then, in  addition, to fit in the socket of the sighting rod, we rigged up a  second mirror, which was mounted in exactly the same way as the first.  The second mirror was called the station mirror, and differed from the  other, or sun mirror, in having a small patch of white paper pasted at  the center instead of a peep hole. When using this instrument, we set it  up so that the station mirror faced the ledge, then by sighting through  the hole in the sun mirror at the reflection in the station mirror we  could see just what was in focus. The station mirror had to be moved  until the patch at its center hid the ledge from view. After that the  sun mirror was shifted until the shadow spot fell on the white patch of  the station mirror. When once the station mirror was focused, it could  be clamped tightly in place by screwing up the trunnion and swivel nuts.  But the sun mirror had to be constantly shifted to keep the shadow on  the patch. Another way of focusing the mirrors was to stand behind the  instrument with the head close to the station mirror, shift the sun  mirror until the entire station mirror was reflected in it, with the  white patch squarely over the unsilvered spot; then still looking at the  sun mirror, the station mirror was shifted until the reflection of the  distant station was brought squarely in line with the unsilvered spot on  the mirror. The station mirror was now firmly bolted and the sun mirror  adjusted until the shadow spot fell on the paper patch.          CHAPTER XIV.    ICE BOATS, SLEDGES AND TOBOGGANS.      As our vacation was drawing to a close, we began to make plans for the  Christmas holidays. Our previous Christmas vacation had been so  completely taken up with preparations for the trip to Willow Clump  Island that we had had no time for the trip itself. We resolved this  time to have everything ready beforehand, so that we could spend the  entire two weeks in solid pleasure. Our skate sails and snow shoes were  stored in the attic, ready for use. If we were to make a trip in the  snow we would need a sledge, and then, too, we wanted to make an ice  boat. It would hardly pay to build these on the island and then cart  them home, so it was decided to break up camp a couple of weeks before  school commenced.      BREAKING CAMP.    Consequently, on the first day of September we gathered up our  belongings, corraled our chickens, packed our goods, and the next day  started for home. Mr. Schreiner, in response to a letter from the  secretary, came down with a large wagon in which the majority of the  things were packed. The rest of our luggage was stowed in the scow and  the canoes, and these were towed down the canal, as before. We reached  home late in the afternoon, tired and hungry. It was a treat to sit at  the table again and eat some of Mother's appetizing dishes. And say,  wasn't that pie great, though! My, how ravenous we were! And then a  soft, comfortable bed with spotless white sheets and pillow cases. How  soundly we did sleep that night! You can just bet we were all glad  enough to get back to civilization, though, of course, no one could have  dragged out the confession from a single one of us.      THE ICE BOAT.    [Illustration: Fig. 163. The Backbone.]    [Illustration: Fig. 164. Frame of the Ice Boat.]    [Illustration: Fig. 165. Runner Shoe.]    [Illustration: Fig. 166. The Rudder Shoe.]    School commenced on the 20th of September that year, so we hadn't much  time to spare. Work was begun immediately on the ice boat. Our first ice  boat was rather a crude one. A 2 by 4 inch scantling 14 feet long was  used for the backbone of the boat. The scantling was placed on edge, and  to lighten it and improve its appearance it was tapered fore and aft  from a point 4 feet from the bow end. The thickness of the ends of the  backbone was but 2 inches, as shown in Fig. 163. To the under edge of  the backbone, 5 feet from the forward end, a crosspiece was nailed. This  crosspiece was a 1-inch board 6 inches wide and 9 feet long. Braces were  then run from the ends of the crosspiece to the forward and rear ends of  the backbone, and at the rear end several boards nailed across the  braces served as a seat for the boat.    Our next task was to rig up the runners. For these we used skates, which  were so arranged that we could remove them whenever we wanted to. Three  blocks of wood were used for the runner shoes. Two of them were cut from  a 2 by 4 scantling and measured a foot in length. The third block was  only 1 inch thick, but was otherwise of the same dimensions. The skates  were laid face downward on the blocks with the clamping levers open;  then we marked the places where the clamping jaws touched the wood and  drilled holes at these points. The forward end of each block was also  tapered off to fit flat against the face of the skate. Then by inserting  the jaws in the holes and closing the levers, the skate was clamped to  the block, just as it would be to a shoe. The two 2-inch blocks were  bolted to the ends of the crosspiece, but the third block needed further  attention, as it was to be used for the rudder or steering runner.    [Illustration: Fig. 167. The Tiller.]    [Illustration: Fig. 168. Drilling the Mast Step.]    The rudder post was shaped from a block of hardwood 3 inches square and  10 inches long. Two inches from the lower end saw cuts were made in the  side of the block to a depth of 3/4 inch. Then with a chisel the sides  were split off, forming a large pin with a square shank 8 inches long.  Next the corners of the shank were cut off, rounding it to a diameter of  1-1/2 inches. The runner block was fastened securely to the head of the  rudder post with screws. A 1-1/2-inch hole was now drilled into the  backbone at the stern end to receive the rudder post. A tiller was next  cut out of a 1-inch board to the shape shown in Fig. 167. A slot was cut  in the end of the tiller, and the latter fitted snugly over the top of  the post, where it was held in place by screws threaded in through the  sides.    [Illustration: Fig. 169. The Mainsail.]    The mast of our boat was a pole 8 feet long, tapering from a diameter 2  inches at the base to 1-1/2 inches at the top. A step for the mast was  cut from a 2 by 4 block 8 inches long. A 2-inch hole was drilled into  the face of this block. We had no drill large enough to bore this hole,  but accomplished the same result by drilling eight 1/2-inch holes inside  of a 2-inch circle (Fig. 168), and then used a chisel to cut off the  projecting pieces. The mast step was firmly bolted to the backbone at  its thickest part, that is, just four feet from the forward end. The  mast was braced with stay ropes stretched from the top to the forward  end of the backbone and to the ends of the crosspiece. A 9-foot pole,  tapering from 1-1/2 inches to 1 inch in diameter, was used for the boom  of the mainsail, and for the gaff we used a 6-foot pole of the same  diameter.    [Illustration: Fig. 170. Jaws of the Boom.]    [Illustration: Fig. 171. A Cleat.]    The dimensions of the mainsail are given in Fig. 169. For mast hoops we  used curtain rings. Five were attached to the sail along the luff, and  one was fastened with a piece of leather to the end of the gaff. We used  a different scheme for holding the boom to the mast. The forward end of  the boom was flattened at the sides and a couple of cheek blocks were  bolted on, forming jaws of the shape indicated in Fig. 170. The jaws  were whittled out to fit nicely around the mast, and were kept from  slipping off by a piece of rope passed around the mast and threaded  through the ends of the cheek blocks. Half a dozen small pulley blocks  were now procured, of the type used on awnings. A rope called the throat  halyard was strung from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],[0,"The Rebel of the School (#17)"],[1,"the palest blue cashmere blouse,  most exquisitely trimmed with blue embroidery flecked with pink silk.  The blouse had real lace round the neck and cuffs, and must have cost a  great deal of money.    \"Don't you think Alice would look very nice in one of these?\" said  Kathleen, gazing with a very earnest face at Mrs. Tennant.    \"Pink is more Alice's color. She is too pale for blue,\" was Mrs.  Tennant's reply.    \"Well, then, look here. Isn't this a perfect duck? See for yourself.  It's a sort of cross between a coral and a rose--oh, so exquisite! And  see how it is made, with all these teeny tucks and the embroidery let in  between. And the sleeves--aren't they just illegant entirely? Don't you  think we might make her wear it?\"    \"I am sorry, Kathleen, but you are not getting on very well with Alice.  I wish it were different. Could you not do something to propitiate her?\"    \"Wisha, then, darling!\" said Kathleen, pausing a moment to consider;  \"that's just what I can't do. Alice's ways are not my ways, and if I  copied her it's kilt I'd be entirely. She never likes to see a smile on  my face, and she can't abide to watch me if I dance a step, and she  wouldn't take a joke out of me if it was to save her life. To please  Alice I'd have to be the primmest of the prim, and always stooping over  my horrid lessons, and the end of it there'd be no more of poor Kathleen  O'Hara--- it's dead and in her grave she'd be, the creature. Indeed, I'm  glad I'm not made on Alice's pattern, even if she is your daughter. I  can't aspire to anything so fine and high up even for your sake,  darling, and you are one of the sweetest women on God's earth. I  couldn't do it--not by no means.\"    Mrs. Tennant could not help laughing as Kathleen described the sort of  girl she would be if she adopted Alice's role.    \"But the question is now,\" said the girl, \"what are we to do to make her  have some of these pretty things? Mightn't I give the blouse to you  first, and you could give it to her? She'd look so sweet in this pink  blouse when she went to tea at her chosen friends. She'd be almost  pretty if she was nicely dressed. I've got this white one for little  Ruth Craven, and I want Alice to have this so badly. Can't you manage  it, dear Mrs. Tennant?\"    Mrs. Tennant felt tempted. The blouse was very dainty and pretty, and  unlike anything she could afford to buy for her only daughter. Kathleen  threw her arms round her neck and kissed her.    \"You will--you will, dear Mrs. Tennant,\" she said. \"It is yours  entirely. You tell her you got it at a cheap sale. Say you went to a  jumble sale and bought it; you paid one-and-twopence-halfpenny for it.  That's the right figure, isn't it, for the best things at a jumble sale?  Tell her it's _quite_ new, and was thrown in promiscuous like.\"    \"But, my darling child, I can't tell her what isn't true. She would wear  it if she didn't know it came from you. She would not only wear it, but  she would delight in it; but nothing would induce her to take it if she  thought you had given it.\"    \"Then don't let's tell her. Besides, it wouldn't be true, for I have  given it to you, dear. And now, see, here is something for your sweet  self. I wrote to Aunt Katie, and Aunt Katie is so clever. See! come to  the glass.\"    Kathleen had opened a cardboard box, and out of it she took a black  velvet bonnet with nodding plumes and a little pink strip of velvet  fastened under the brim. This she put with trembling fingers on Mrs.  Tennant's head. Mrs. Tennant was in reality not at all old, and she  looked quite young and pretty in the new toque.    \"You are charming, that's what you are,\" said Kathleen. \"And I can't  take it back, for you know perfectly well that it is a wee bit too old  for me. You will have to wear it.\"    \"But what will Alice say?\"    \"Never mind. Don't tell her; just be mum. Say, 'it is mine, and I mean  to wear it.' Oh, I'd manage Alice if I happened to be her mother.\"    \"I don't think you would, dear.\"    \"Indeed, but I would. And now I must consider whom I am to give the  other things to.\"    When Kathleen had finally parcelled out her treasures there was not such  a great deal left for herself, for this girl and the other who had taken  her fancy were all allotted a treasure out of that famous box. And there  was a thick albert chain made of solid silver for Ben, and a keyless  silver watch for David; and what could boys possibly want more? Kathleen  had remembered all her friends, and Aunt Katie O'Flynn was more than  willing to carry out her request.    Finally, at the very bottom of the trunk was a little parcel which she  refrained from opening while Mrs. Tennant was present. It contained the  badges of the new society. Kathleen had decided that they were to call  themselves \"The Wild Irish Girls,\" and this title was neatly engraved on  the little badges, which were of the shape of hearts. Below the name was  the device--a harp with a bit of shamrock trailing round it. The badges  were small and exceedingly neat, and there were about sixty of them in  all.    \"Now then, I can go ahead,\" thought Kathleen. \"What with the finery for  my dear, darling chosen ones, and the badges for all the members, I  shall do.\"    She was utterly reckless with regard to expense. Her father was rich,  and he did not mind what he spent on his only child. The box seemed to  fill up every crevice of her heart, as she expressed it, and it was a  very happy girl who dressed to go to the Weldons' that evening.  Kathleen was intensely affectionate, and would have done anything in the  world to please Mrs. Tennant; but when it came to wearing a very quiet  gray dress with a little lace round the collar and cuffs, she begun to  demur.    \"It can't be done,\" she thought. \"Half of them will be in gray and half  of them in brown, and a few old dowdies will perhaps be in black. But I  must be gay; it isn't fair to Aunt Katie to be anything else.\"    She made a wild and scarcely judicious selection. She put on crimson  silk stockings, and tucked into her bag a pair of crimson satin shoes.  Her dress consisted of a black velvet skirt over a crimson petticoat,  and her bodice was of crimson silk very much embroidered and with  elbow-sleeves. Round her neck she wore innumerable beads of every  possible color, and twisted through her lovely hair were some more  beads, which shone as the light fell on them. Altogether it was a very  bizarre and fascinating little figure that appeared that evening at the  Weldons' hall door. Over her showy dress she wore a long opera-cloak, so  that at first her splendors were not fully visible. This gaily dressed  little person entered a room full of sober people. The effect was  somewhat the same as though a gorgeous butterfly had flown into the  room. She lit up the dullness and made a centre of attraction--all eyes  were fastened upon her; for Kathleen in her well-made dress,  notwithstanding the gayety of its color, looked simply radiant. The  mischief in her dark eyes, too, but added to her charm. She glanced with  almost maliciousness at Alice, who, in the dowdiest of pale-gray  dresses, with her hair rather untidy and her face destitute of color,  was standing near one of the windows. And as Alice glanced at Kathleen  she felt that she almost hated the Irish girl.          CHAPTER IX.    CONSCIENCE AND DIFFICULTIES.      All the people who knew her were beginning to make a fuss over Ruth  Craven. She who had hardly ever been noticed during the early part of  her life, who was just her grandfather's darling and her grandmother's  idol, was now petted and made much of and fussed over by every one. It  was quite an extraordinary thing for the paying girls of the Great  Shirley School to be so interested and excited about a foundationer.  Cassandra Weldon was not the only girl who had taken Ruth up; some of  the best and nicest girls of the school began to patronize her. The fact  was that she was very modest and a perfect lady, and it was impossible  to feel anything but good-will towards her. The rest of the foundation  girls at first determined that they would leave her with her fine  friends, but when Kathleen insisted on Ruth's joining the secret society  of the Wild Irish Girls, they were obliged to submit.    \"We'd do anything in the world for our queen,\" said Susy Hopkins,  talking to another foundation girl one day as they strolled along the  road. \"It is to-night we are to meet again, and she says she will bring  the rules all drawn up, and she will read them to us. There are about  thirty of us now, and more and more offer to join every day. The  difficulty is that we have got to keep the thing from the knowledge of  the teachers and the paying girls of the school. Kathleen is certain  that it would be suppressed if it were known; and it must not be known,  for it is the biggest lark and the greatest fun we ever had in all our  lives.\"    \"Yes,\" said Rosy Myers; \"I feel now quite honored at being a foundation  girl.\"    \"She does promise us wonderful things,\" said Kate Rourke. \"She says when  the summer comes we shall have all sorts of nice excursions. Of course,  we can't do anything special in the daytime, unless sometimes on  Saturday, when we have a whole holiday; but at least; she says, the  nights are our own and we can do as we like. It really is grand. I  suppose it is wicked, but then that makes it rather more fascinating.\"    \"We are in the queen's Cabinet, bless her, the duck!\" said Susy Hopkins.  \"There are a dozen of us now, and there is talk of a sort of livery or  badge for the members of the Cabinet; but we'll know all about it when  we meet sharp at nine to-night. We are the twelve members of the  Cabinet, and there are about twenty girls who are our sort of standing  army. It is really most exciting.\"    The girls talked a little longer and then parted. As Susy Hopkins was  running home helter-skelter--for she wanted to get her lessons"]]]
