The re-arrival of the _Krimhilde_ at this point aroused  considerable interest, and the authorities demanded the reason. The  captain explained, but receiving a re-assurance that everything was in  order and as originally expressed, he was free to travel down the  river.    Again the journey was attempted and all went well until the boat was  approaching Wesel. Then another patrol boat fussed up, the officer of  which boarded the steamer. Again the captain presented his permit and  expressed his determination to go ahead.    \"We don't know anything about that,\" returned the boarding officer,  referring to the permit. \"My orders are to stop every vessel carrying  Englishmen!\"    The boarding-officer turned and ordered all the male prisoners to  separate themselves from the ladies. Passports were produced upon demand  and closely scrutinised. Then the officer, stepping back a few paces,  beckoned the nearest man. His name was demanded to identify the passport  and then a brief hurried cross-examination proceeded, culminating in the  question:    \"How old are you?\"    \"Thirty-eight!\"    \"Step this side!\" retorted the officer, who proceeded to examine the  succeeding passenger, to whom the self-same questions were repeated, the  final interrogation being the passenger's age.    \"Fifty-seven!\" came the response.    The officer scanned the passport and finding the answer to be correct  remarked, \"Step over there!\" indicating his left.    By the time the officer had completed his interrogations the male  passengers were divided into two groups. Meanwhile the women and  children had gathered round, following the proceedings, which appeared  inexplicable to them, with a strange silence and a fearful dread.    \"All you men of military age,\" continued the officer speaking to the  group of younger-looking men, \"are to go ashore. You will be detained as  prisoners of war. You have ten minutes to pack your trunks and to say  'Good-bye!' So hurry up!\"    At this intelligence a fearful hubbub broke out. The women and children  who were to be separated from their husbands, fathers, and relatives  gave way to lamentation and hysterical raving. While the men packed  their trunks under official supervision their wives and children clung  to them desperately. But the men realising that war is war, accepted the  situation philosophically, even cheerfully. They were buoyed up by the  official assurance that their detention was merely a matter of form, and  that they would soon be released and free to proceed to their homes.    I may say that this is a favourite ruse followed by the Germans in all  the camps in which I was interned, and I discovered that it was general  throughout the country. It is always expressed whenever the Teutons see  trouble brewing. Undoubtedly it is practised to keep the prisoners keyed  up to a feverish pitch of hopefulness. Certainly it succeeded for a  time, although such announcements at a later date, when we had seen  through the subterfuge, were received with ironical cheering and jeers.    At such a sudden and summary cleavage between families many distressing  and pathetic scenes were witnessed. On board there happened to be a  wealthy young member of the Russian nobility--Prince L----. He was  travelling with his sister and friends and was far from well.    The sister approached the officer and pleaded hard for her brother's  release. It was refused. Grief-stricken the Princess fell on her knees  and with tears streaming down her cheeks, kissed the officer's boots and  offered all her jewels--they must have been worth a considerable amount  of money--which she hastily tore off and held in her outstretched hands.    For the moment even the officer was somewhat moved. Then in a quiet,  determined voice he remarked,    \"I am exceedingly sorry, but I cannot grant your request. I am merely  acting on my orders. But I can assure you that your brother in common  with all the others here, will be looked after. Not a hair of their  heads shall be injured. They will all be treated according to the best  and noblest traditions of German honour,[4] and the regulations which  have been drawn up among the Powers concerning the treatment of  prisoners of war.\" With these words the Prince was cast aside with the  others.        [Footnote 4: The traditions of German honour were dinned into      our ears at every turn.--H.C.M.]    In another instance the wife and child of an Englishman, Mr. C----,  refused to be parted. The wife clung round her husband's neck while the  child held to his coat. She expressed her determination to go with her  husband, no matter what might happen, and was on the verge of hysterics.  Every one was moved and strove to coax her into quietness, while an  officer even accompanied her off the boat with her husband. On the quay  efforts were repeated to placate her and to induce her to allow her  husband to proceed. But all in vain. At last, drawing the lady forcibly  away, though with no greater force than was necessary, the officer  himself attempted to console her.    \"Do not worry. I will do all I can for you, and will see you do not want  during the time your husband is interned.\"    What became of Mrs. C---- and her child just then I do not know, because  at that moment the boat sheered off with a sorrowful and crying list of  passengers who waved frantic farewells. Alas! I fear that in some  instances that was the last occasion upon which husband and wife ever  saw one another, and when children were parted from \"daddy\" for life.    Such was the story related by Mr. K----. After the boat had left, the  detained prisoners, he explained, were formed up on the quay, and  surrounded by an imposing guard with fixed bayonets, were marched off.  It was a sad party. All that was dearest in life to them had been torn  away at a few minutes' notice through the short-sightedness of Prussian  militarism or the desire of the Road-hog of Europe to display his  officialism and the authority he had enjoyed for but a few days. Many of  these tourists, as one might naturally expect, were sorely worried by  the thoughts as to what would become of their loved ones upon their  arrival in England, many without money or friends to receive them. This  was the discussion that occupied their minds when they were marching  towards Wesel Station, and when the tiny party, of which I was one,  being marched from Wesel prison, met them in the street, as already  related.    As for ourselves we were soon destined to taste the pleasures of the  best traditions of German honour. No provisions of any kind whatever had  been placed on the train for our requirements. What was more we were  denied the opportunity to purchase any food at any station where we  happened to stop. At one point a number of girls pressed round the  carriages offering glasses of milk at 20 pfennigs. As we were all  famished and parched there was a brisk trade. But the moment the  officers saw what was happening they rushed forward and drove the girls  back by force of arms.    So far as our compartment was concerned we were more fortunate than many  of our colleagues. Our soldier warden was by no means a bad fellow at  heart. In his pack he carried his daily ration--two thick hunks of black  bread. He took this out and instantly proffered one hunk to us, which we  gladly accepted and divided among ourselves.    Those being the early days of the war the German soldier was a universal  favourite among the civilians. Directly one was espied he became a  magnet. The women, girls and elder men rushed forward and wildly thrust  all sorts of comestibles into his hands. Unhappily we did not stop at  many stations; our train displayed a galling preference for lonely  signal posts, so that the chances of our guard receiving many such gifts  were distinctly limited. But at one station he did receive an armful of  broedchen--tiny loaves--which he divided amongst us subsequently with the  greatest camaraderie.    But his comrades in other compartments were not so well-disposed. With  true Prussian fiendishness they refused to permit their prisoners to buy  anything for themselves, and to drive them to exasperation and to make  them feel their position, the guards would ostentatiously devour their  own meals and gifts. While we did not really receive sufficient to stay  us, still our guard did his best for us, an act which we appreciated and  reciprocated by making a collection on his behalf. When we proffered  this slight recognition of his courtesy and sympathetic feeling he  declined to accept it. [*gap] He was one of the very few well-disposed  Germans I ever met.    Upon arriving at Sennelager Station we were unceremoniously bundled out  of the train. Those who had trunks and bags were roughly bidden to  shoulder them and to fall in for the march to the camp. The noon heat  was terrible. The sun poured down unmercifully, and after twelve hours'  confinement in the stuffy railway carriages few could stretch their  limbs. But the military guards set the marching pace and we had to keep  to it. If we lagged we were prodded into activity by means of the rifle.    Sennelager camp lies upon a plateau overlooking the railway, and it is  approached by a winding road. The acclivity although somewhat steep is  not long, but we, famished and worn from hunger, thirst, and lack of  sleep, found the struggle with the sand into which our feet sank over  our ankles, almost insuperable. Those burdened with baggage soon showed  signs of distress. Many were now carrying a parcel for the first time in  their lives and the ordeal completely broke them up. Prince L---- had a  heavy bag, and before he had gone far the soft skin of one hand had been  completely chafed away, leaving a gaping, bleeding wound. To make  matters worse the hot sand was drifting sulkily and clogging his wound  set up untold agony.    Prince L---- made a representation to the officer-in-char"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18183"],[0,"Trees, Fruits and Flowers of Minnesota, 1916 (#17)"],[1,"trees, variety No.  1; and fifty everbearing strawberry plants, variety No. 1017. Both plum  trees and strawberry plants made a good growth. Although the  strawberries were set heavily with fruit, but little of it ripened  before the heavy frosts came. The plant is very vigorous, and the berry  is large and of excellent quality.          Annual Report, 1915, Vice-President, Tenth Congressional District.    M. H. HEGERLE, SUPT., ST. BONIFACIUS.      On May 18th we had several inches of snow accompanied by a fierce  northwest wind, and orchards without any shelter suffered seriously, and  both apples and plums in such orchards were scarce and of a rather  inferior quality. A few orchards had a fair crop, while a couple of  others with a natural windbreak had a fairly good crop, but on an  average it was the lightest apple and plum crop we have had for some  time.    Mr. Beiersdorf and Mr. Swichtenberg report a good crop of Wealthy and  Peter. Their orchards are close to a lake and are well protected on the  north and west by a natural grove.    Of the twenty-four report blanks sent out, eleven were returned properly  filled in, and they all report conditions about as above outlined.    Cherries and grapes suffered even more from the cold than the apples,  and that crop was very light. My Homer cherry trees look healthy and are  growing fine, but the past two years had not enough fruit to supply the  birds.    Raspberries and strawberries were a good crop and of exceptional fine  quality, but the currants and gooseberries were a total failure in my  garden as well as elsewhere, according to all reports received.    There were not many fruit trees planted in this district the past year.  For instance, at this station the deliveries last spring consisted  principally of bundles containing one-half dozen or a dozen trees each,  and the total number delivered in that way did not exceed 200 trees and,  according to all information, the planting throughout this district was  very light.    I know of only one new orchard started with 700 four and five year old  trees. About 500 are Wealthys and the balance Patten Greenings. The  trees made a good start but were somewhat neglected during the summer,  the field being planted to corn and some to barley, and all was handled  rather rough.    There was very little blight in this district the past year. I noticed  just a little on two or three Transcendents, and Mr. Jos. Boll, who has  about 1,500 bearing trees, reports no blight at all.    I did no spraying this year, did not consider it worth while, as there  was no fruit, and most others felt the same way. Other years though a  lot of spraying is done, and the more progressive ones spray two and  three times.    There is plenty of moisture in the soil, and the trees are going into  winter quarters in good shape, therefore prospects for apple and plum  crop the coming season are excellent.    [Illustration: Residence of M. H. Hegerle, St. Bonifacius.]    Probably a hundred or more different kinds of apple and plum trees and  berries of all kinds are grown here. Farmers in the past usually bought  what the salesman recommended, just to get rid of him; lately though  they are taking more interest in the selection, and the Wealthy,  Patten's or Northwestern Greenings, Okabena, Peter and perhaps a few  Duchess are about the only apple trees planted now. Surprise plums,  Dunlap and everbearing strawberries are the leaders.    Ornamental shrubs are found here of all names and descriptions and  colors, and they all seem to do well.           *       *       *       *       *    HONEY VINEGAR.--Vinegar made from honey has an exceptionally  fine flavor and is not expensive.

GUST JOHNSON, RETIRED FRUIT GROWER, MINNEAPOLIS.      Of the growing of fruit, it may well be said, \"Experience is a good  teacher, but a dear school.\"    When I began fruit growing, some thirty years ago, I did not begin it  merely as an experiment. I was interested in every branch of the work  and, being very much in earnest about it, I felt confident of success.    Thinking that the failures and drawbacks sometimes experienced could be  easily overcome by a thorough understanding of the work at hand, I began  by getting all the information possible. I found that great books such  as by Downing, Thomas, etc., were more suitable for the advanced fruit  grower, but I studied all the pamphlets and books obtainable during the  winter months and put this knowledge into practice during the summer. Of  course I could not put into practice all I had obtained from this  reading, but I remembered distinctly the advice to all amateur fruit  growers to start out slowly. This was particularly suited to my case,  for the land was covered with timber, some of which I grubbed each  summer, gradually adding acres as I cleared the land.    My first venture was in planting raspberries, planting potatoes between  the rows the first year. One delusion I had was in planting as many  different and untested varieties as I could afford to buy and not  confining myself to those that had been tried and had proven  satisfactory. Fortunately for me, the high cost of plants at this time  did not warrant my buying as many different varieties as I desired, and  I had to be contented with fewer plants. From the most promising of  these, I saved all the plants possible.    I had an idea that I could do better by sending to some of the Eastern  states for my plants, but here again I was mistaken, for the plants  often did not arrive until late in May, and by the time they had reached  their destination were practically all dried out. The warm weather then  coming on, I lost the greater part of them, although I had carefully  hoed and tended them in the hope that they would finally revive. Here I  might also mention that the express charges added considerably to the  cost of these already expensive plants.    As a beginner I put much unnecessary labor on these plants. While I do  not wish to leave the impression that hoeing and caring for them is not  all right, still there should be a happy medium which I later learned as  I became more experienced along this line. I must admit, however, that  this rich, new land thus cultivated certainly yielded some wonderful  fruit.    As time went by, I kept adding to my plantation, and owing to the large  yield and the good demand for the black caps I took a fancy to raising  them. When the Palmer variety was first introduced, I planted quite a  field of them. I shall never forget the way these berries ripened, and  such a lot of them as there were. Practically every one by this time  having planted black caps, their great yield soon overstocked the  market, and berries finally dropped as low as 65c or 70c a crate.    Having decided to dig up these black caps, I began paying closer  attention to the red raspberry. I noticed that the raspberries growing  wild on my place grew mostly in places where big trees had been cut down  and young trees had grown up, thus partly shading the plants. Having  this fact in mind, I planted the raspberries as follows: I planted an  orchard, having the trees in parallel rows, and between the trees in  these same rows I planted the raspberries. By planting in this manner,  the cultivation would benefit the trees as well as the smaller plants.  Of course after the trees began bearing heavily, the plants nearest the  trees had to be removed, and later the other plants likewise were  removed.    As a beginner it was a puzzle to me which varieties I should plant. All  varieties listed in the numerous catalogs were so highly recommended as  being hardy, large yielders, good shippers, etc., that the selection of  plants was not an easy matter.    The speed with which a new variety of raspberry is sent out over the  country and discarded is surprising. The most popular sort at this time  was the \"Turner\" variety. I did not, however, fancy this variety, for it  suckered so immensely that it required continual hoeing to keep the new  plants cut down. The berries were unusually soft and settled down in the  boxes, which greatly detracted from their appearance in the crates.  There were also at this time a few of the \"Philadelphia\" variety being  planted. They are a dark, soft variety and somewhat similar to the  Turner.    Just at this time there was being sent out a new variety, known as the  Cuthbert, or Queen of the Market, and queen it was indeed. This was a  large, firm berry, and after ripening it would remain on the plant a  long time without falling off. These plants grew up in remarkably long  canes, but not knowing how to head them back they would often topple  over during a heavy storm. This added another valuable lesson to my  increasing experience, which resulted in my pinching of the new canes as  soon as they had attained a height of from three to four feet. This made  the plants more stocky and more able to support their load of berries  without the aid of wire or stakes.    Next came the Marlboro, plants of which sold at as much as a dollar  apiece in the east. I then set out a bed of Marlboro, which proved to be  even better than the Cuthbert, previously mentioned. They could be  picked while still quite light in color, thus reaching the market while  still firm and not over-ripe. There was only one possible drawback, and  that was the fact that I had planted them on a southern exposure, while  they were more adapted to a colder or northern exposure. This variety on  a new field, as it was, practically bore itself to death.    About this time, there originated in Wisconsin"]]]
