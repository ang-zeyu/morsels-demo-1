As the language will evolve based  on internal definitions, the quality of the language will improve.    MDT is able to generate a definition, and then a word has to be associated to  that definition. Unfortunately, the words have already an external definition.  Thus, there are two possibilities: to invent a new word, or to use an already  existing word. In the latter situation, two definitions associated to the same  word could exist: an internal one generated by MDT, and an external one, as we  can find in dictionaries. My decision was to use as much as possible the  already existing words, with the risk to have two different definitions  associated to the same word. As MDT will be accepted, all the words associated  to functions of the brain will be associated only to their internal  definitions.    11: To be irritated, to be under stress  Such a phrase is used when there is a temporary situation of instability of  the structure of models. Such a status can affect the short-range models (to  be irritated) or the long-range models (to be under stress).    In the following, we will describe some situations when such a temporary  instability can occur.    11a. There is a normal model associated to the actual external reality. The  problem occurs when such external reality evolves in a cyclical way, for very  long time. In such a situation, the prediction of the evolution of the  external reality is identical with IR, forever.    If the external reality is a sound, and if the sound contains a sequence which  is repeated on and on, this uses a lot of energy of the brain for a nonsense  activity (due to the hardware design, it is impossible not to hear a sound).  Because the activation of other models becomes difficult, there will be an  instability of the structure of models, and so there is an irritation-status.    Examples: the use as weapon of the rattlesnake's rattle and of the \"Chinese  drop\"    It is important to observe two parameters: the length of the sequence and the  repetition interval. The musical piece called \"Bolero\" by Maurice Ravel  contains a sequence, which is long enough to produce no irritation. In fact,  every time when the sequence is repeated, there are other musical instruments.  In this way, this musical piece is not too close to the irritation limit. Even  so, at the end of the piece, the repeated sequence ends, producing an instant  relaxation.    Let's see this problem in the case of visual arts. Let's suppose a large white  surface. Such a surface can produce irritation, because in any point of this  surface, the IR is identical with the prediction. There is a natural tendency  to put some elements on that surface, to reduce the irritation. But, if the  details are randomly spread, the prediction will be different of the IR in  most of the points. This also can produce some irritation. The solution found  in about all cultural zones and times was to have some sequence made of  identical elements, but every element has to be complicated enough so that  sometimes the IR is identical with the prediction, and sometimes not. When  such a surface is explored, the brain seems to have a pleasure. The pleasure  can be defined as a situation when the prediction is close to IR, but about  never the same. This can be seen mainly on cultural products of ancient  cultures, but also nowadays.    We can see this also on the shape of the Christian cross: a Christian-Orthodox  cross has more detail than a Christian-Catholic cross because the Orthodox  religion is mostly oriented to image models while the Catholic religion is  more oriented to symbolic models.    The modern cultural zones are based mainly on symbolic models. There is a  reduced tendency to see all the details in a symbolic environment. Thus a  perfectly plane surface, without details, will produce no irritation. This is  so because, in a symbolic environment, the interaction based on image models  is not important anymore.    11b. The lack of stability of the structure of models could occur when the  external reality is unchanging for a very long time. Here, the prediction is  also identical with IR, but there is an additional technological feature,  which will be described below.    As we know from the main theory, any active model will predict in a continuous  automatic way the possible evolution of the external reality (this is a basic  hardware feature). Now, the problem is how often this prediction is made. My  supposition is that the speed of this activity is variable, and depends on the  speed of changing of the external reality. That is, when the external reality  is changing very fast, the new predictions are made also very often.    Now, if the external reality is not changing anymore, there could be a  problem: the model has to make a new prediction, but there is no reason to do  this. Such a situation can also produce a temporary perturbation of the  stability of the structure of models, i.e. irritation.    In such a situation, the brain could activate other ZMs, (e.g. ZMs which are  not connected to the unchanging external reality) up to the moment when there  will be a change in the main external reality. This activity could be a source  of mistakes or even accidents, as the local-ZM becomes, temporarily, one,  which is not connected to the main external reality. The accidents can occur,  for instance, when the external reality is changing and the suitable local-ZM  has not enough time to reinitialize.    Example: a driver is in a hurry and stops at a stoplight. The external reality  is not changing for a while and so there could be an irritation. Under stress  conditions, the driver could activate another model (associated or not to the  external reality) and so, he/she is not properly prepared for the moment when  the traffic light changes to green. Because this is an important source of  irritation, in some cities there is an additional display, which counts the  time for red or green status, and so the irritation is diminished.    Thus, time flows with a variable speed, depending on the speed of change of  the external reality (see ETA about \"time\").    11c. The word \"irritation\" is used also when an external factor interferes  with the activity of a main model. This external factor could also activate  the PSM. Such a situation can also affect the stability of the structure of  models and so, produce irritation.    As we know, faced with a new external reality (for instance a strong noise),  the brain will switch from the actual-ZM to another model, which understands  the new situation. When such external perturbation occurs on and on, the brain  is forced to switch the ZMs very often. Such activity can be affected by  mistakes, because switching from a model to another is a very complex  activity. When a model is deactivated, some information has to be stored to be  used when the model will be reactivated. Sometimes, the external reality can  change so much that the stored information becomes of no use. But the brain  does not know easily if the stored information is good or not at the new  activation. So, there could be mistakes, and the stability of the structure of  models can also be affected (irritation occurs).    Because the activation and deactivation of a symbolic model is much more  complicated than for an image model, the switching between a symbolic model  and an image model, or even worse, between two symbolic models, is very  dangerous (don't use the mobile phone when you drive, e.g.)    12. Love, to love    The main model of any brain (human or animal) is the Protection and Survival  Model (PSM). If something (a person, an animal, an object, an idea...) is  included by a person in his/her PSM (as a model, of course), the relation  between that \"something\" and that person is a love relation. That is, e.g. a  person A includes a person B (as model) in his/her PSM. The person A will  treat person B in the same way as he/she treats his/her legs, hands, eyes etc.    Here we use the convention that A indicates the person who is in love and B is  the person included in the PSM as a model.    The most important love-relation seems to be between a mother and her  children.    As we defined the term \"love\" the fact that A loves B is totally independent  on the fact that B loves A.    We already described love based on PSM. There is another type of love, which  is not based on PSM. Thus, the person A makes a structure of models which  contains B in about all of them. If B disappears, the models would become  obsolete, which produces a large instability of the structure. The problem  could be solved by another \"B\" or by a shielding model or by suicide.    Because love is based mainly on image models, about all of the written above  is true for animals too.      13. Happiness, to be happy  MDT considers that there are two basic modes of interaction of the brain with  the external reality: to generate the reality based on the external reality  and to modify the external reality.    Continuous happiness is associated to the status of the brain which builds  action models (ZAMs) based on ZMs-only. That is, to do and want only what is  possible (as ZMs predict). So any activation of a ZAM is a success (ZAM is  able to reach its aims). The happy persons have a big contribution to the  stability of the society, but small contribution to its advance.    We already defined the disharmonic person as the person who builds and  activates ZAMs without taking in account too much the predictions of the ZMs.  Usually such persons are unhappy, but sometimes they are able to reach their  aims and so, at least for a short time, they are in a status of high level  happiness.    14. Intuition    Based on MDT, intuition is associated to the capacity to obtain image  information in a symbolic frame.    That is, when we are in the frame of a symbolic model and there is a problem  without a solution, an image model can"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14591"],[0,"Faust [part 1].

FAUST    An angel, if like thee!    MARGARET    I brought it up, and it was fond of me.  Father had died before it saw the light,  And mother's case seemed hopeless quite,  So weak and miserable she lay;  And she recovered, then, so slowly, day by day.  She could not think, herself, of giving  The poor wee thing its natural living;  And so I nursed it all alone  With milk and water: 'twas my own.  Lulled in my lap with many a song,  It smiled, and tumbled, and grew strong.    FAUST    The purest bliss was surely then thy dower.    MARGARET    But surely, also, many a weary hour.  I kept the baby's cradle near  My bed at night: if 't even stirred, I'd guess it,  And waking, hear.  And I must nurse it, warm beside me press it,  And oft, to quiet it, my bed forsake,  And dandling back and forth the restless creature take,  Then at the wash-tub stand, at morning's break;  And then the marketing and kitchen-tending,  Day after day, the same thing, never-ending.  One's spirits, Sir, are thus not always good,  But then one learns to relish rest and food.    [_They pass_.    MARTHA    Yes, the poor women are bad off, 'tis true:  A stubborn bachelor there's no converting.    MEPHISTOPHELES    It but depends upon the like of you,  And I should turn to better ways than flirting.    MARTHA    Speak plainly, Sir, have you no one detected?  Has not your heart been anywhere subjected?    MEPHISTOPHELES    The proverb says: One's own warm hearth  And a good wife, are gold and jewels worth.    MARTHA    I mean, have you not felt desire, though ne'er so slightly?    MEPHISTOPHELES    I've everywhere, in fact, been entertained politely.

Not unto me in vain  Hast thou thy countenance revealed in fire.  Thou gav'st me Nature as a kingdom grand,  With power to feel and to enjoy it. Thou  Not only cold, amazed acquaintance yield'st,  But grantest, that in her profoundest breast  I gaze, as in the bosom of a friend.  The ranks of living creatures thou dost lead  Before me, teaching me to know my brothers  In air and water and the silent wood.  And when the storm in forests roars and grinds,  The giant firs, in falling, neighbor boughs  And neighbor trunks with crushing weight bear down,  And falling, fill the hills with hollow thunders,--  Then to the cave secure thou leadest me,  Then show'st me mine own self, and in my breast  The deep, mysterious miracles unfold.  And when the perfect moon before my gaze  Comes up with soothing light, around me float  From every precipice and thicket damp  The silvery phantoms of the ages past,  And temper the austere delight of thought.    That nothing can be perfect unto Man  I now am conscious. With this ecstasy,  Which brings me near and nearer to the Gods,  Thou gav'st the comrade, whom I now no more  Can do without, though, cold and scornful, he  Demeans me to myself, and with a breath,  A word, transforms thy gifts to nothingness.  Within my breast he fans a lawless fire,  Unwearied, for that fair and lovely form:  Thus in desire I hasten to enjoyment,  And in enjoyment pine to feel desire.    (MEPHISTOPHELES _enters_.)    MEPHISTOPHELES    Have you not led this life quite long enough?  How can a further test delight you?  'Tis very well, that once one tries the stuff,  But something new must then requite you.    FAUST    Would there were other work for thee!  To plague my day auspicious thou returnest.    MEPHISTOPHELES    Well! I'll engage to let thee be:  Thou darest not tell me so in earnest.  The loss of thee were truly very slight,--  comrade crazy, rude, repelling:    [Illustration]    One has one's hands full all the day and night;  If what one does, or leaves undone, is right,  From such a face as thine there is no telling.    FAUST    There is, again, thy proper tone!--  That thou hast bored me, I must thankful be!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Poor Son of Earth, how couldst thou thus alone  Have led thy life, bereft of me?  I, for a time, at least, have worked thy cure;  Thy fancy's rickets plague thee not at all:  Had I not been, so hadst thou, sure,  Walked thyself off this earthly ball  Why here to caverns, rocky hollows slinking,  Sit'st thou, as 'twere an owl a-blinking?  Why suck'st, from sodden moss and dripping stone,  Toad-like, thy nourishment alone?  A fine way, this, thy time to fill!  The Doctor's in thy body still.    FAUST    What fresh and vital forces, canst thou guess,  Spring from my commerce with the wilderness?  But, if thou hadst the power of guessing,  Thou wouldst be devil enough to grudge my soul the blessing.    MEPHISTOPHELES    A blessing drawn from supernatural fountains!  In night and dew to lie upon the mountains;  All Heaven and Earth in rapture penetrating;  Thyself to Godhood haughtily inflating;  To grub with yearning force through Earth's dark marrow,  Compress the six days' work within thy bosom narrow,--  To taste, I know not what, in haughty power,  Thine own ecstatic life on all things shower,  Thine earthly self behind thee cast,  And then the lofty instinct, thus--    (_With a gesture_:)    at last,--  daren't say how--to pluck the final flower!    FAUST    Shame on thee!    MEPHISTOPHELES    Yes, thou findest that unpleasant!  Thou hast the moral right to cry me \"shame!\" at present.  One dares not that before chaste ears declare,  Which chaste hearts, notwithstanding, cannot spare;  And, once for all, I grudge thee not the pleasure  Of lying to thyself in moderate measure.  But such a course thou wilt not long endure;  Already art thou o'er-excited,  And, if it last, wilt soon be plighted  To madness and to horror, sure.  Enough of that! Thy love sits lonely yonder,  By all things saddened and oppressed;  Her thoughts and yearnings seek thee, tenderer, fonder,--  mighty love is in her breast.  First came thy passion's flood and poured around her  As when from melted snow a streamlet overflows;  Thou hast therewith so"]]]
