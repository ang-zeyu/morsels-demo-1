CONFLICT AND INDEPENDENCE          CHAPTER V    THE NEW COURSE IN BRITISH IMPERIAL POLICY      On October 25, 1760, King George II died and the British crown passed to  his young grandson. The first George, the son of the Elector of Hanover  and Sophia the granddaughter of James I, was a thorough German who never  even learned to speak the language of the land over which he reigned.  The second George never saw England until he was a man. He spoke English  with an accent and until his death preferred his German home. During  their reign, the principle had become well established that the king did  not govern but acted only through ministers representing the majority in  Parliament.      GEORGE III AND HIS SYSTEM    =The Character of the New King.=--The third George rudely broke the  German tradition of his family. He resented the imputation that he was a  foreigner and on all occasions made a display of his British sympathies.  To the draft of his first speech to Parliament, he added the popular  phrase: \"Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of  Briton.\" Macaulay, the English historian, certainly of no liking for  high royal prerogative, said of George: \"The young king was a born  Englishman. All his tastes and habits, good and bad, were English. No  portion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with.... His age,  his appearance, and all that was known of his character conciliated  public favor. He was in the bloom of youth; his person and address were  pleasing; scandal imputed to him no vice; and flattery might without  glaring absurdity ascribe to him many princely virtues.\"    Nevertheless George III had been spoiled by his mother, his tutors, and  his courtiers. Under their influence he developed high and mighty  notions about the sacredness of royal authority and his duty to check  the pretensions of Parliament and the ministers dependent upon it. His  mother had dinned into his ears the slogan: \"George, be king!\" Lord  Bute, his teacher and adviser, had told him that his honor required him  to take an active part in the shaping of public policy and the making of  laws. Thus educated, he surrounded himself with courtiers who encouraged  him in the determination to rule as well as reign, to subdue all  parties, and to place himself at the head of the nation and empire.    [Illustration: _From an old print._    GEORGE III]    =Political Parties and George III.=--The state of the political parties  favored the plans of the king to restore some of the ancient luster of  the crown. The Whigs, who were composed mainly of the smaller  freeholders, merchants, inhabitants of towns, and Protestant  non-conformists, had grown haughty and overbearing through long  continuance in power and had as a consequence raised up many enemies in  their own ranks. Their opponents, the Tories, had by this time given up  all hope of restoring to the throne the direct Stuart line; but they  still cherished their old notions about divine right. With the  accession of George III the coveted opportunity came to them to rally  around the throne again. George received his Tory friends with open  arms, gave them offices, and bought them seats in the House of Commons.    =The British Parliamentary System.=--The peculiarities of the British  Parliament at the time made smooth the way for the king and his allies  with their designs for controlling the entire government. In the first  place, the House of Lords was composed mainly of hereditary nobles whose  number the king could increase by the appointment of his favorites, as  of old. Though the members of the House of Commons were elected by  popular vote, they did not speak for the mass of English people. Great  towns like Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, for example, had no  representatives at all. While there were about eight million inhabitants  in Great Britain, there were in 1768 only about 160,000 voters; that is  to say, only about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the  government. Many boroughs returned one or more members to the Commons  although they had merely a handful of voters or in some instances no  voters at all. Furthermore, these tiny boroughs were often controlled by  lords who openly sold the right of representation to the highest bidder.  The \"rotten-boroughs,\" as they were called by reformers, were a public  scandal, but George III readily made use of them to get his friends into  the House of Commons.      GEORGE III'S MINISTERS AND THEIR COLONIAL POLICIES    =Grenville and the War Debt.=--Within a year after the accession of  George III, William Pitt was turned out of office, the king treating him  with \"gross incivility\" and the crowds shouting \"Pitt forever!\" The  direction of affairs was entrusted to men enjoying the king's  confidence. Leadership in the House of Commons fell to George Grenville,  a grave and laborious man who for years had groaned over the increasing  cost of government.    The first task after the conclusion of peace in 1763 was the adjustment  of the disordered finances of the kingdom. The debt stood at the highest  point in the history of the country. More revenue was absolutely  necessary and Grenville began to search for it, turning his attention  finally to the American colonies. In this quest he had the aid of a  zealous colleague, Charles Townshend, who had long been in public  service and was familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal  governors in America. These two men, with the support of the entire  ministry, inaugurated in February, 1763, \"a new system of colonial  government. It was announced by authority that there were to be no more  requisitions from the king to the colonial assemblies for supplies, but  that the colonies were to be taxed instead by act of Parliament.  Colonial governors and judges were to be paid by the Crown; they were to  be supported by a standing army of twenty regiments; and all the  expenses of this force were to be met by parliamentary taxation.\"    =Restriction of Paper Money (1763).=--Among the many complaints filed  before the board of trade were vigorous protests against the issuance of  paper money by the colonial legislatures. The new ministry provided a  remedy in the act of 1763, which declared void all colonial laws  authorizing paper money or extending the life of outstanding bills. This  law was aimed at the \"cheap money\" which the Americans were fond of  making when specie was scarce--money which they tried to force on their  English creditors in return for goods and in payment of the interest and  principal of debts. Thus the first chapter was written in the long  battle over sound money on this continent.    =Limitation on Western Land Sales.=--Later in the same year (1763)  George III issued a royal proclamation providing, among other things,  for the government of the territory recently acquired by the treaty of  Paris from the French. One of the provisions in this royal decree  touched frontiersmen to the quick. The contests between the king's  officers and the colonists over the disposition of western lands had  been long and sharp. The Americans chafed at restrictions on  settlement. The more adventurous were continually moving west and  \"squatting\" on land purchased from the Indians or simply seized without  authority. To put an end to this, the king forbade all further purchases  from the Indians, reserving to the crown the right to acquire such lands  and dispose of them for settlement. A second provision in the same  proclamation vested the power of licensing trade with the Indians,  including the lucrative fur business, in the hands of royal officers in  the colonies. These two limitations on American freedom and enterprise  were declared to be in the interest of the crown and for the  preservation of the rights of the Indians against fraud and abuses.    =The Sugar Act of 1764.=--King George's ministers next turned their  attention to measures of taxation and trade. Since the heavy debt under  which England was laboring had been largely incurred in the defense of  America, nothing seemed more reasonable to them than the proposition  that the colonies should help to bear the burden which fell so heavily  upon the English taxpayer. The Sugar Act of 1764 was the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16965"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#17)"],[1,"hand in our system of colonization, and that Europe  will soon recur to the principles of the ancient polity.\"    This feeling of pride in the growth and expansion of our great  over-seas dominions is comparatively new, and there was a time when  British ministers seriously proposed separation, from what they  considered to be a useless burden.    The ignorance of all that concerned the colonies in the early years  of Victoria's reign was extraordinary, and this accounted, to a great  extent, for the indifference with which the English people regarded  the prospect of drifting apart.    Lord Beaconsfield was a true prophet, for this indifference is now  a thing of the past, and in the year 1875 an Imperial Federation  League was formed, which, together with the celebrations at the  Jubilees in 1887 and 1897, helped to knit this country and the  Dominions together in bonds of friendship and sympathy. The rapid  improvements in communication have brought the different parts of  the Empire closer together; the Imperial Penny Postage and an  all-British cable route to Australia have kept us in constant touch  with our kinsmen in every part of the world where the Union Jack is  flown.    But this did not all come about in a day. Prejudice and dislike are  difficult to conquer, and it was chiefly owing to the efforts of Lord  Beaconsfield that they were eventually overcome.    Imperialism too often means 'Jingoism,'--wild waving of flags and  chanting of such melodies as:        We don't want to fight,        But, by Jingo, if we do,      We've got the ships, we've got the men,        We've got the money too.    The true Imperialism is \"defence, not defiance.\" Beaconsfield looked  back into the past and sought to \"resume the thread of our ancient  empire.\" For him empire meant no easy burden but a solemn duty, a  knitting together of all the varied races and religions in one common  cause. \"Peace with honour\" was his and England's watchword. He  believed, in fact, like Shakespeare, in saying                                       Beware      Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,      Bear't, that th' opposed may beware of thee.    He was very particular on the duty of \"if necessary, saying rough  things kindly, and not kind things roughly,\" which was a lesson Lord  Palmerston never seemed to be capable of learning. Another of his  maxims was that it was wiser from every point of view to treat  semi-barbarous nations with due respect for their customs and  feelings. He preached Confederation and not Annexation. \"By pursuing  the policy of Confederation,\" he declared, \"we bind states together,  we consolidate their resources, and we enable them to establish a  strong frontier, that is the best security against annexation.\"    His whole policy was to foster the growth of independence and build  the foundations of a peace which should be enduring. \"Both in the  East and in the West our object is to have prosperous, happy, and  contented neighbours.\"    The object of his imperialism was to progress, at the same time paying  due respect to the traditions of the past; he rightly believed that  the character of a nation, like that of an individual, is  strengthened by responsibility.    \"The glory of the Empire and the prosperity of the people\" was what  he hoped to achieve.    During the anxious times of the Indian Mutiny he alone seemed to grasp  the real meaning of this sudden uprising of alien races. He declared  that it was a revolt and not a mutiny; a revolt against the English  because of their lack of respect for ancient rights and customs.    After the war was ended he declared that the Government ought to tell  the people of India \"that the relation between them and their real  ruler and sovereign, Queen Victoria, shall be drawn nearer.\" This  should be done \"in the Queen's name and with the Queen's authority.\"  He appealed to the whole Indian nation by his 'Royal Titles Bill,'  by means of which the Queen received the title of Empress of India.  This brought home to the minds and imaginations of the native races  the real meaning and grandeur of the Empire of which they were now  a part. The great Queen was now _their_ Empress, or, to use the Indian  title, '_Kaiser-i-Hind_.'    The Queen took the deepest interest in the Proclamation to the Indian  people in 1858, and insisted on a number of alterations before she  would allow it to be passed as satisfactory. She wrote to Lord Derby  asking him to remember that \"it is a female sovereign who speaks to  more than a hundred millions of Eastern people on assuming the direct  government over them after a bloody, civil war, giving them pledges  which her future reign is to redeem, and explaining the principles  of her government. Such a document should breathe feelings of  generosity, benevolence, and religious feeling, pointing out the  privileges which the Indians will receive in being placed on an  equality with the subjects of the British Crown, and the prosperity  following in the train of civilization.\"    Direct mention was to be made of the introduction of railways, canals,  and telegraphs, with an assurance that such works would be the cause  of general welfare to the Indian people. In conclusion she added:  \"Her Majesty wishes expression to be given to her feelings of horror  and regret at the results of this bloody civil war, and of pleasure  and gratitude to God at its approaching end, and Her Majesty thinks  the Proclamation should terminate by an invocation to Providence for  its blessing on a great work for a great and good end.\"    The amended Proclamation was read in every province in India and met  everywhere with cordial approval by princes and natives alike. The  feeling of loyalty was aroused by the Queen's assurance that \"in your  prosperity is our strength, in your contentment our security, and  in your gratitude our best reward.\"    On May 1, 1859, in England, and on July 28, 1859, in India, there  was a general thanksgiving for the restoration of peace.    Although the Queen was never able to visit India in person, in 1875  the Prince of Wales went, at her request, to mark her appreciation  of the loyalty of the native princes. The welcome given to the future  King of England was truly royal. Reviews, banquets, illuminations,  state dinners followed one another in rapid succession. Benares, the  sacred city of the Hindoos, was visited, and here the Prince  witnessed a great procession which included large numbers of  elephants and camels, and an illumination of the entire river and  city.    At Delhi, the capital of the Great Mogul, the Prince was met by Lord  Napier of Magdala at the head of fifteen thousand troops, and at  Lucknow an address and a crown set with jewels were presented to him.    [Illustration: The Secret of England's Greatness  J.T. Baker  Photo W.A. Mansell & Co.]    It was in the same year that Disraeli, on behalf of the British  Government, purchased a very large number of shares in the Suez Canal,  thus gaining for us a hand in its administration--a vitally important  matter when one realizes how much closer India has been brought by  this saving in time over the long voyage round the Cape.    To pass in review the growth and expansion of the Empire during the  Queen's reign would be a difficult task, and an impossible one within  the limits of a small volume. The expressions of loyalty and devotion  from the representatives of the great over-seas dominions on the  occasion of the Queen's Jubilee in 1887 were proof enough that  England and the English were no longer an insular land and people,  but a mighty nation with one sovereign head.    In the address which was presented to the Queen it was stated that  during her reign her colonial subjects of European descent had  increased from two to nine millions, and in Asia and India there was  an increase of population from ninety-six to two hundred and  fifty-four millions.    After the great ceremony of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral the  Queen expressed her thanks to her people in the following message:    \"I am anxious to express to my people my warm thanks for the kind,  and more than kind, reception I met with on going to and returning  from Westminster Abbey with all my children and grandchildren.    \"The enthusiastic reception I met with then, as well as on those  eventful days in London, as well as in Windsor, on the occasion of  my Jubilee, has touched me most deeply, and has shown that the labours  and anxieties of fifty long years--twenty-two years of which I spent  in unclouded happiness, shared with and cheered by my beloved husband,  while an equal number were full of sorrows and trial borne without  his sheltering arm and wise help--have been appreciated by my people.  This feeling and the sense of duty towards my dear country and  subjects, who are so inseparably bound up with my life, will  encourage me in my task, often a very difficult and arduous one,  during the remainder of my life.    \"The wonderful order preserved on this occasion, and the good  behaviour of the enormous multitudes assembled, merits my highest  admiration. That God may protect and abundantly bless my country is  my fervent prayer.\"    And in laying the foundation-stone of the Imperial Institute, she  said:    \"I concur with you in thinking that the counsel and exertions of my  beloved husband initiated a movement which gave increased vigour to  commercial activity, and produced marked and lasting improvements  in industrial efforts. One indirect result of that movement has been  to bring more before the minds of men the vast and varied resources  of the Empire over which Providence has willed that I should reign  during fifty prosperous years.    \"I believe and hope that the Imperial Institute will play a useful  part in combining those resources for the common advantage of all  my subjects, conducing towards the welding of the colonies, India,  and the mother-country, into"]]]
