Babies of nervous inheritance, on the other hand, will show clearly by  the violence of the response provoked that their nervous system is  easily stimulated and exhausted. They will wriggle and squirm for  hours together, emitting the same constant reflex cry. The whole body  will start convulsively at a sudden touch or a loud sound which would  evoke no response from a more stolid infant. The sleeplessness and  crying exhaust the baby, rendering the nervous system more and more  irritable, while the sensation of hunger which is delayed in other  children by twelve hours or more of deep sleep appears early and is of  extreme intensity. We must see to it that sense stimuli are reduced to  the lowest possible level. True, we cannot again restore the child to  a bath of warm fluid, of the same temperature as his body, where he  can be free from irksome pressure and from all sensations of sound and  light, but we can so arrange matters that he is not disturbed by loud  sounds and bright lights, and that he is not moved more than is  necessary. Sudden unexpected movements are especially harmful. Jogging  him up and down, patting him on the back, expostulation, and  entreaties are all out of place and do all the harm in the world. The  first bath should be as expeditious as possible, and above all the  baby must not be chilled by tedious exposure. Cold irritates his  nervous system more than anything else, unless it be excessive warmth.  In preserving the proper temperature so that we do not render the  child restless by excess of heat or by excess of cold, we  too-civilised people have made our own difficulties. We have  exaggerated the completeness of the sudden separation of mother and  child which nature decrees. It is the function of all mother animals  to approximate the unstable temperature of the newly born to their own  by the close contact of their bodies, which provide just the proper  heat. Labour is nowadays so complicated and exhausting a process for  mothers that, all things considered, we are wise in completing the  separation of mother and child and in removing the baby to his own  cot. But the difficulty remains, and we must arrange that any  artificial heating needed is constant and of proper degree.    If the baby is very restless and irritable, too wide awake and too  conscious of his surroundings, the all-important task of getting him  to the breast and getting him to draw the milk into the breast is apt  to be difficult. His sucking is a purely reflex and involuntary act.  It can be produced by anything which gently presses down the tongue,  and a finger placed in the proper position will provoke the movement  without the child's consciousness being aroused. The placid child  whose mind is at rest will suck well and strongly. If, on the other  hand, the brain is too much stimulated and the child is restless and  irritable, the reflex act of suction is inhibited, and it is a  difficult matter to get the child to the breast. He is too eager,  mouthing, and gulping, and spluttering. Or sometimes his mental  sufferings seem too much for his appetite, and though wide awake and  crying loudly, he refuses to grasp the nipple, turning his head away  and wriggling blindly hither and thither. This effect of mental unrest  on the newborn infant is often disastrous, because it is one of the  common causes of the failure of women to nurse their children. This is  not the place to sketch in detail a scheme for the proper technique of  breast nursing, a matter which is much misunderstood at the present  day. It will be enough shortly to say that an efficient supply of milk  depends upon the complete and regular emptying of the breast. The  breasts of all mothers will secrete milk if strong and vigorous  suction is applied to the nipple by the child. If anything interferes  with suction, the milk does not appear or, if it has appeared, it  rapidly declines in amount. The mother's part is to a great extent a  passive one, provided that she can supply one essential--a nipple that  is large enough for the child to grasp properly. Within wide limits  what the mother eats or drinks, whether she be robust or whether she  has always been something of an invalid, matters not at all. A frail  woman may naturally not be able to stand the strain of nursing for  many months, but that is not here the point in question. We are  dealing only with the establishment of lactation and with the milk  supply of the early days and weeks which is of such vital importance  for the child. If the mother is ill, if, for example, she has  consumption, we may separate her from the child in the interests of  both; but if this is not done, she will continue to secrete milk for a  time as readily as if she were in perfect health, and the breasts of  many a dying woman are to be seen full of milk. Mothers are too apt to  attribute the disappointment of a complete failure to nurse to some  weakness or want of robustness in their own health. This is never the  reason of the failure, and the fault, if the mother has a well-formed  nipple, is generally to be found in some disturbance in the child.  Prematurity, with extreme somnolence, breathlessness from respiratory  disease, nasal catarrh, which hinders breathing through the nose,  infections of all sorts, are common causes of this failure to suck  effectively. But perhaps the most common cause of all is the  inhibition from nervous unrest of that reflex act of sucking which  works so well in the placid and quiet child. It is a point to which  too little attention is paid, and mothers and the books which mothers  read commonly neglect the nervous system of the child and devote  themselves to such considerations as the relative merits of two-hourly  and four-hourly feedings--important points in their way, but less  important than this.    The matter is complicated in two other ways. In the first place, the  nervous baby, just because he is so active and wakeful and restless,  is apt rapidly to lose weight and to have an increased need for food.  The restlessness is generally attributed to hunger, and this is true,  because hunger is soon added to the other sensations from which he  suffers, and like them is unduly acute. It is difficult not to give  way and to provide artificial food from the bottle. Yet if we do so we  must face the fact that these restless little mortals are quicker to  form habits than most, and once they have tasted a bottle that flows  easily without hard suction, they will often obstinately refuse the  ungrateful task of sucking at a breast which has not yet begun to  secrete readily. The suction that is devoted to the bottle is removed  from the breast, and the natural delay in the coming in of the milk is  increased indefinitely. At the worst, the supply of milk fails almost  at its first appearance. We must devote our attention to quieting the  nervous unrest by removing all unnecessary sensory stimulation from  the baby. He must be in a warm cot, in a warm, well-aired, darkened,  and silent room, and the necessary handling must be reduced to a  minimum. Sometimes sound sleep will come for the first time if he is  placed gently in his mother's bed, close to her warm body. If he is  apt to bungle at the breast from eagerness and restlessness, it is not  wise always to choose the moment when he has roused himself into a  passion of crying to attempt the difficult task. So far as is possible  he should be carried to the breast when he is drowsy and sleepy, not  when he is crying furiously, and then the reflex sucking act may  proceed undisturbed.    In the second place, we must guard against the ill effect which the  ceaseless crying of these nervous babies has upon the mother. She may  be so exhausted by the labour that her nerves are all on edge, and she  grows apprehensive and frightened over all manner of little things.  The tired mother is apt to fear that she will have no milk, and her  agitation grows with each failure on the part of the child. Now the  first secretion of milk is very closely dependent upon the nervous  system of the mother. We have said that within wide limits her  physical condition is of less importance, but her peace of mind is  essential. And so it is wise for some part of the day to keep the  nervous baby out of hearing of the mother, and so far as possible to  choose moments when the child is quiet to put him to the breast. A  nurse with a confident, hopeful manner will effect most; a fussy,  over-anxious, or despondent attitude will do untold harm. We shall  sometimes fail if the nervous unrest is very obstinate either in  mother or in child, but we shall fail less often if we diagnose the  cause correctly in the cases we are considering. Lastly, it is  possible to control the condition in both mother and child by the  careful use of bromide or chloral.    It is not, of course, suggested that these drugs should be given  freely or as a routine to every hungry baby wailing for the breast, or  that we can hope to combat or ward off an inherited neuropathy by a  few doses of a sedative. There are, however, not a few babies in whom  there develops soon after birth a sort of vicious circle. They can  suck efficiently and digest without pain only when they sleep soundly.  If they are put to the breast after much crying and restlessness,  each meal is followed by flatulence, colic, and renewed crying. The  only effective treatment is to secure sleep and to carry a slumbering  or drowsy infant to the breast. Then the sucking reflex comes to its  own again, the breast is drained steadily and well, and digestion  proceeds thereafter without disturbance and during a further spell of  sleep.

Numerous details narrated by these victims of an Act of Parliament  kept us awake all that night, and by next morning we were glad enough  to hear no more of the sickening procedure of extermination  voluntarily instituted by the South African Parliament.  We had spent a hideous night under a bitterly cold sky,  conditions to which hundreds of our unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen  in various parts of the country are condemned by the provisions  of this Parliamentary land plague.  At five o'clock in the morning  the cold seemed to redouble its energies; and never before  did we so fully appreciate the Master's saying:  \"But pray ye that your flight  be not in the winter.\"          Chapter V       Another Night with the Sufferers      Heureux ceux qui sont morts dans le calme des soirs,    Avant ces jours affreux de carnage et de haine!    Ils se sont endormis, le coeur rempli d'espoirs,    Dans un reve d'amour et de concorde humaine!      Ils n'ont pas entendu la sinistre remeur    Qui monte des hameaux consumes par la flamme,    Ni les cris des enfants et des vierges en pleurs,    Ni le gemissement des vieillards et des femmes!              Heureux les morts!                                         Maurice Kufferath.        We parted sadly from these unfortunate nomads of an ungrateful  and inhospitable country, after advising them to trek from the Union  into the arid deserts of Bechuanaland.  In our advice we laid special stress  upon the costliness of such an expedition as theirs and upon  the many and varying regulations to be complied with, on such a trek,  through the Western Transvaal.  But, cost whatever it may,  they, like ourselves, understood that as the law stood  they would be better off and safer beyond the boundaries of the Union.    From here we worked our way into the Hoopstad district.  There we saw  some Natives who were, as it were, on pins and needles, their landlords  having given them a few days in which to consider the advisability  of either accepting the new conditions or leaving their houses.  Our advice to these tenants was to accept, for the time being,  any terms offered by their landlords, pending an appeal to His Majesty  the King; we also passed through a few farms where the white farmers were  visibly sympathetic towards the harried Natives.  Some of the white farmers  were accepting Natives as tenants on their farms in defiance of the law.  We naturally thanked these for their humanity and went our way,  promising never to disclose their magnanimity to the Government officials.  \"What has suddenly happened?\" one of these landlords asked.  \"We were living so nicely with your people, and why should the law  unsettle them in this manner?\"    We may here mention that a fortnight later we were in General Botha's  constituency in the Transvaal.  A few days before we arrived there  a meeting of white farmers was held at one of the Dutch farm-houses  at which it was resolved to take the fullest advantage of the new law,  which had placed the entire native population in the hands of the farmers.  It was further resolved that a Kafir who refused to become a servant  should at once be consigned to the road.    A similar resolution was passed at another meeting of landlords  at another place.  Part of the proceedings of this meeting  was reported in some, though not all, of the Dutch newspapers.  Without breaking our promise not to disclose any names of landlords  who felt it a duty to resist injustice, even though it bears the garb of law,  we will mention Mr. X., a Boer farmer, of the farm ----, near Thingamejig,  between the town of ---- and the river ----.  He protested at the meeting,  stating that the Transvaalers were not compelled to turn the Natives out,  and that they were only debarred from taking any new native tenants;  that it was wicked to expel a Kafir from the farm for no reason whatever,  and so make him homeless, since he could not, if evicted, go either  to another farm or back to his old place.  For expressing his views so frankly  Mr. X. was threatened by his compatriots with physical violence!  His opponents also said that, if he continued to harbour Kafirs on his farm  as tenants, they would hold him responsible for any stock  that they might lose.  The incidents of the meeting were related  to the Natives by Mr. X. himself.  He told the Natives, further,  that he would go to the expense of fencing his farm with the Natives inside,  so that they may be out of the reach of his infuriated neighbours.    We spent the next night in some native huts on a farm  in the district of Hoopstad.  On that occasion we met a man  who had had a month's notice to leave his farm, and was going  from farm to farm in search of a new place.  He had heard  alarming stories about evictions wherever he went.  During that evening  we were treated to some more pitiful stories concerning  the atrocities of the wretched land Act.  Many native wanderers  had actually passed that farm during the preceding few days,  trudging aimlessly from place to place in search of some farmer  who might give them a shelter.  At first they thought  the stories about a new law were inventions or exaggerations,  but their own desperate straits and the prevailing native dislocation  soon taught them otherwise.    The similarity in the experiences of the sufferers would make  monotonous reading if given individually, but there are instances  here and there which give variety to the painful record,  and these should yield the utmost satisfaction to the promoters of the Act,  in proving to them the fell measure of their achievement.  One example of these experiences was that of a white farmer  who had induced a thrifty Native in another district to come and farm  on his estate.  The contract was duly executed about the end of May, 1913.  It was agreed that the Native should move over to the new place  after gathering his crops and sharing them with his old landlord,  which he did in the third week in June.  On his arrival, however,  the new landlord's attitude towards him aroused his suspicions;  his suspicions were confirmed when, after some hesitation,  the landlord told him that their contract was illegal.  Having already  left his old place the legal embargo was also against his return there,  and so his only course was to leave that place and wander about  with his stock and family.  They went in the direction of Kroonstad,  and they have not been heard of since.    The next example is that of the oldest man in the \"Free\" State.  He had been evicted (so we were told during that evening on the farm)  along with his aged wife, his grey-headed children,  the children's children and grandchildren.  We may here add that we read  a confirmation of this case in the English weekly newspaper of Harrismith.  The paper's reference to this case will also illustrate the easy manner  in which these outrageous evictions are reported in white newspapers.  There is no reference to the sinister undercurrent and hardships  attending these evictions.  The paper in question, the `Harrismith Chronicle',  simply says: --    ==                                 AN ANCIENT COUPLE    A venerable Native whose age is no less than 119 years,  accompanied by his wife, aged 98, and a son who is approaching 80,  left Harrismith on Tuesday by train for Volksrust.  The old man  acquired some property in the Transvaal, and is leaving this district  to start a new home with as much interest in the venture  as if he were a stripling of twenty.  The old lady had to be carried  to the train, but the old man walked fairly firmly.  The aged couple  were the centre of much kindly attraction, and were made  as comfortable as possible for their journey by the railway officials.  It is difficult to realize in these days of rapid change  that in the departure from the \"Free\" State of this venerable party  we are losing from our midst a man who was born in 1794,  and has lived in no less than three centuries of time.  Good luck to them both; may they still live long and prosper!  ==    Now, as a matter of fact, this \"ancient couple\" had not left the \"Free\" State  of their own free will.  Their stock had been expelled from  their grazing areas, and they were told that they could only continue to graze  if the centenarian tenant agreed to supply a certain number of labourers  to work on the landowner's farm and with his sons ceased to do any ploughing  as tenants.  This system of sharing the crops has been followed  ever since the Boers planted themselves in the \"Free\" State, and the family  had had no other means of support.  Happily the aid of Providence  in the case of this \"ancient couple\" was speedy, as the old people  quickly found an asylum on the farm of Mr. P. ka I. Seme, a native solicitor  in the Transvaal.    At the same place on the same evening we were told of a conversation  between a well-known Dutchman and a Native.  \"The object of this law,\"  said the Burgher, \"is to goad the Natives into rebellion,  so that the Government may legally confiscate what little ground  was left to them, and hand over the dispossessed Kafirs and their families  to work for the farmers, just for their food.\"  The policy of  goading the Natives into rebellion is not wholly foreign to Colonial policy;  but the horrible cruelty to which live stock is exposed under the new Act  is altogether a new departure.  King Solomon says, \"The righteous man  regardeth the life of his beast, but the tender mercies of the wicked  are cruel\"; but there is a Government of professed Bible readers who,  in defiance of all Scriptural precepts, pass a law which penalizes  a section of the community along with their oxen, sheep, goats,  horses and donkeys on account of the colour of their owners.  The penalty clause (Section 5) imposes a fine of 100 Pounds on a landowner  who accommodates a Native on his farm; and if after the fine is paid  the Native"]]]
