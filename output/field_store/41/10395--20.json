Here should be placed the episode       of Dinah seduced by an Amorite prince, and the consequent       massacre of the inhabitants by Simeon and Levi (_Gen._       xxxiv.). The almost complete dispersion of the two tribes of       Simeon and Levi is attributed to this massacre: cf. _Gen._       xlix. 5-7.         **** _Gen._ xxxv. 1-15, where is found the Elohistic version       (9-15) of the circumstances which led to the change of name       from Jacob to Israel.    By his two wives and their maids he had twelve sons. Leah was the mother  of Keuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zabulon; Gad. and Asher  were the children of his slave Zilpah; while Joseph and Benjamin were  the only sons of Rachel--Dan and Naphtali being the offspring of her  servant Bilhah. The preference which his father showed to him caused  Joseph to be hated by his brothers; they sold him to a caravan of  Midianites on their way to Egypt, and persuaded Jacob that a wild beast  had devoured him. Jahveh was, however, with Joseph, and \"made all that  he did to prosper in his hand.\" He was bought by Potiphar, a great  Egyptian lord and captain of Pharaoh's guard, who made him his overseer;  his master's wife, however, \"cast her eyes upon Joseph,\" but finding  that he rejected her shameless advances, she accused him of having  offered violence to her person. Being cast into prison, he astonished  his companions in misfortune by his skill in reading dreams, and was  summoned to Court to interpret to the king his dream of the seven lean  kine who had devoured the seven fat kine, which he did by representing  the latter as seven years of abundance, of which the crops should be  swallowed up by seven years of famine. Joseph was thereupon raised by  Pharaoh to the rank of prime minister. He stored up the surplus of the  abundant harvests, and as soon as the famine broke out, distributed  the corn to the hunger-stricken people in exchange for their silver and  gold, and for their flocks and fields. Hence it was,that the whole  of the Nile valley, with the exception of the lands belonging to the  priests, gradually passed into the possession of the royal treasury.  Meanwhile his brethren, who also suffered from the famine, came down  into Egypt to buy corn. Joseph revealed himself to them, pardoned the  wrong they had done him, and presented them to the Pharaoh. \"And Pharaoh  said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts,  and go, get you unto the land of Canaan: and take your father and your  household, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of  Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.\" Jacob thereupon raised his  camp and came to Beersheba, where he offered sacrifices to the God  of his father Isaac; and Jahveh commanded him to go down into Egypt,  saying, \"I will there make of thee a great nation: I will go down with  thee into Egypt: and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph  shall put his hand upon thine eyes.\" The whole family were installed by  Pharaoh in the province of Goshen, as far as possible from the centres  of the native population, \"for every shepherd is an abomination unto the  Egyptians.\"    In the midst of these stern yet touching narratives in which the Hebrews  of the times of the Kings delighted to trace the history of their remote  ancestors, one important fact arrests our attention: the Beni-Israel  quitted Southern Syria and settled on the banks of the Nile. They  had remained for a considerable time in what was known later as the  mountains of Judah. Hebron had served as their rallying-point; the broad  but scantily watered wadys separating the cultivated lands from the  desert, were to them a patrimony, which they shared with the inhabitants  of the neighbouring towns. Every year, in the spring, they led their  flocks to browse on the thin herbage growing in the bottoms of the  valleys, removing them to another district only when the supply of  fodder was exhausted. The women span, wove, fashioned garments, baked  bread, cooked the viands, and devoted themselves to the care of the  younger children, whom they suckled beyond the usual period. The men  lived like the Bedouin--periods of activity alternating regularly with  times of idleness, and the daily routine, with its simple duties and  casual work, often gave place to quarrels for the possession of some  rich pasturage or some never-failing well.    A comparatively ancient tradition relates that the Hebrews arrived in  Egypt during the reign of Aphobis, a Hyksos king, doubtless one of the  Apopi, and possibly the monarch who restored the monuments of the Theban  Pharaohs, and engraved his name on the sphinxes of Amenemhait III. and  on the colossi of Mirmashau.* The land which the Hebrews obtained is  that which, down to the present day, is most frequently visited by  nomads, who find there an uncertain hospitality.         * The year XVII. of Apophis has been pointed out as the date       of their arrival, and this combination, probably proposed by       some learned Jew of Alexandria, was adopted by Christian       chroniclers. It is unsupported by any fact of Egyptian       history, but it rests on a series of calculations founded on       the information contained in the Bible. Starting from the       assumption that the Exodus must have taken place under       Ahmosis, and that the children of Israel had been four       hundred and thirty years on the banks of the Nile, it was       found that the beginning of their sojourn fell under the       reign of the Apophis mentioned by Josephus, and, to be still       more correct, in the XVIIth year of that prince.    The tribes of the isthmus of Suez are now, in fact, constantly shifting  from one continent to another, and their encampments in any place are  merely temporary. The lord of the soil must, if he desire to keep them  within his borders, treat them with the greatest prudence and tact.  Should the government displease them in any way, or appear to curtail  their liberty, they pack up their tents and take flight into the desert.  The district occupied by them one day is on the next vacated and left to  desolation. Probably the same state of things existed in ancient times,  and the border nomes on the east of the Delta were in turn inhabited or  deserted by the Bedouin of the period. The towns were few in number,  but a series of forts protected the frontier. These were mere  village-strongholds perched on the summit of some eminence, and  surrounded by a strip of cornland. Beyond the frontier extended a region  of bare rock, or a wide plain saturated with the ill-regulated surplus  water of the inundation. The land of Goshen was bounded by the cities of  Heliopolis on the south, Bubastis on the west, and Tanis and Mendes on  the north: the garrison at Avaris could easily keep watch over it and  maintain order within it, while they could at the same time defend it  from the incursions of the Monatiu and the Hiru-Shaitu.*         * Goshen comprised the provinces situated on the borders of       the cultivable cornland, and watered by the infiltration of       the Nile, which caused the growth of a vegetation sufficient       to support the flocks during a few weeks; and it may also       have included the imperfectly irrigated provinces which were       covered with pools and reedy swamps after each inundation.    The Beni-Israel throve in these surroundings so well adapted to their  traditional tastes. Even if their subsequent importance as a nation  has been over-estimated, they did not at least share the fate of many  foreign tribes, who, when transplanted into Egypt, waned and died out,  or, at the end of two or three generations, became merged in the native  population.* In pursuing their calling as shepherds, almost within sight  of the rich cities of the Nile valley, they never forsook the God of  their fathers to bow down before the Enneads or Triads of Egypt; whether  He was already known to them as Jahveh, or was worshipped under the  collective name of Elohim, they served Him with almost unbroken fidelity  even in the presence of Ra and Osiris, of Phtah and Sutkhu.         * We are told that when the Hebrews left Ramses, they were       \"about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside       children. And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and       flocks and herds, even very much cattle\" (_Exod._ xii. 37,       38).    The Hyksos conquest had not in any way modified the feudal system of the  country. The Shepherd-kings must have inherited the royal domain just as  they found it at the close of the XIVth dynasty, but doubtless the whole  Delta, from Avaris to Sais, and from Memphis to Buto, was their personal  appanage. Their direct authority probably extended no further south than  the pyramids, and their supremacy over the fiefs of the Said was at best  precarious. The turbulent lords who shared among them the possession of  the valley had never lost their proud or rebellious spirit, and under  the foreign as under the native Pharaohs regulated their obedience  to their ruler by the energy he displayed, or by their regard for  the resources at his disposal. Thebes had never completely lost the  ascendency which it obtained over them at the fall of the Memphite  dynasty. The accession of the Xoite dynasty, and the arrival of the  Shepherd-kings, in relegating Thebes unceremoniously to a second rank,  had not discouraged it, or lowered its royal prestige in its own eyes or  in those of others: the lords of the south instinctively rallied around  it, as around their natural citadel, and their resources, combined with  its own, rendered it as formidable a power as that of the masters of the  Delta. If we had fuller information as to the history of this period, we  should doubtless see that the various Theban "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17325"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 5 (of 12) (#17)"],[1,"e; it is rather the result of the  extraordinary appearance of the sovereign whose features they were  called on to portray, and the novelty of several of the subjects which  they had to treat. That artist among them who first gave concrete form  to the ideas circulated by the priests of Atonu, and drew the model  cartoons, evidently possessed a master-hand, and was endowed with  undeniable originality and power. No other Egyptian draughtsman ever  expressed a child's grace as he did, and the portraits which he sketched  of the daughters of Khuniatonu playing undressed at their mother's side,  are examples of a reserved and delicate grace. But these models, when  once composed and finished even to the smallest details, were entrusted  for execution to workmen of mediocre powers, who were recruited not only  from Thebes, but from the neighbouring cities of Hermopolis and Siut.  These estimable people, with a praiseworthy patience, traced bit by bit  the cartoons confided to them, omitting or adding individuals or groups  according to the extent of the wall-space they had to cover, or to the  number of relatives and servants whom the proprietor of the tomb desired  should share in his future happiness. The style of these draughtsmen  betrays the influence of the second-rate schools in which they had  learned their craft, and the clumsiness of their work would often repel  us, were it not that the interest of the episodes portrayed redeems it  in the eyes of the Egyptologist.    Khuniatonu left no son to succeed him; two of his sons-in-law  successively occupied the throne--Saakeri, who had married his eldest  daughter Maritatonu, and Tutankhamon, the husband of Ankhnasaton. The  first had been associated in the sovereignty by his father-in-law;* he  showed himself a zealous partisan of the \"Disk,\" and he continued to  reside in the new capital during the few years of his sole reign.** The  second son-in-law was a son of Amenothes III., probably by a concubine.  He returned to the religion of Amon, and his wife, abjuring the creed  of her father, changed her name from Ankhnasaton to that of Ankhnasamon.  Her husband abandoned Khuitatonu*** at the end of two or three years,  and after his departure the town fell into decadence as quickly as it  had arisen. The streets were unfrequented, the palaces and temples stood  empty, the tombs remained unfinished and unoccupied, and its patron god  returned to his former state, and was relegated to the third or fourth  rank in the Egyptian Pantheon.         * He and his wife are represented by the side of Khuniatonu,       with the protocol and the attributes of royalty. Petrie       assigns to this double reign those minor objects on which       the king's prenomen Ankhkhopiruri is followed by the epithet       beloved of Uanira, which formed part of the name of       Khuniatonu.         ** Petrie thinks, on the testimony of the lists of Manetho,       which give twelve years to Akenkheres, daughter of Horos,       that Saakeri reigned twelve years, and only two or three       years as sole monarch without his father-in-law. I think       these two or three years a probable maximum length of his       reign, whatever may be the value we should here assign to       the lists of Manetho.         *** Petrie, judging from the number of minor objects which       he has found in his excavations at Tel el-Amarna, believes       that he can fix the length of Tutankhamon's sojourn at       Khuitatonu at six years, and that of his whole reign at nine       years.    The town struggled for a short time against its adverse fate, which  was no doubt retarded owing to the various industries founded in it by  Khuniatonu, the manufactories of enamel and coloured glass requiring the  presence of many workmen; but the latter emigrated ere long to Thebes  or the neighbouring city of Hermopolis, and the \"Horizon of Atonu\"  disappeared from the list of nomes, leaving of what might have been the  capital of the Egyptian empire, merely a mound of crumbling bricks with  two or three fellahin villages scattered on the eastern bank of the  Nile.*         * Petrie thinks that the temples and palaces were       systematically destroyed by Harmhabi, and the ruins used by       him in the buildings which he erected at different places in       Egypt. But there is no need for this theory: the beauty of       the limestone which Khuniatonu had used sufficiently       accounts for the rapid disappearance of the deserted       edifices.    Thebes, whose influence and population had meanwhile never lessened,  resumed her supremacy undisturbed. If, out of respect for the past,  Tutankhamon continued the decoration of the temple of Atonu at Karnak,  he placed in every other locality the name and figure of Amon; a little  stucco spread over the parts which had been mutilated, enabled the  outlines to be restored to their original purity, and the alteration was  rendered invisible by a few coats of colour. Tutankhamon was succeeded  by the divine father Ai, whom Khuniatonu had assigned as husband to one  of his relatives named Tii, so called after the widow of Amenothes  III. Ai laboured no less diligently than his predecessor to keep up  the traditions which had been temporarily interrupted. He had been  a faithful worshipper of the Disk, and had given orders for the  construction of two funerary chapels for himself in the mountain-side  above Tel el-Amarna, the paintings in which indicate a complete  adherence to the faith of the reigning king. But on becoming Pharaoh,  he was proportionally zealous in his submission to the gods of Thebes,  and in order to mark more fully his return to the ancient belief, he  chose for his royal burying-place a site close to that in which rested  the body of Amenothes III.*         * The first tomb seems to have been dug before his marriage,       at the time when he had no definite ambitions; the second       was prepared for him and his wife Tii.    His sarcophagus, a large oblong of carved rose granite, still lies open  and broken on the spot.    [Illustration: 111.jpg SARCOPHAGUS OF THE PHARAOH AI]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after the drawing of Prisse d'Avenues.    Figures of goddesses stand at the four angles and extend their winged  arms along its sides, as if to embrace the mummy of the sovereign.  Tutankhamon and Ai were obeyed from one end of Egypt to the other, from  Napata to the shores of the Mediterranean. The peoples of Syria raised  no disturbances during their reigns, and paid their accustomed tribute  regularly;* if their rule was short, it was at least happy. It would  appear, however, that after their deaths, troubles arose in the state.  The lists of Manetho give two or three princes--Rathotis, Khebres, and  Akherres--whose names are not found on the monuments.** It is possible  that we ought not to regard them as historical personages, but merely  as heroes of popular romance, of the same type as those introduced so  freely into the history of the preceding dynasties by the chroniclers  of the Saite and Greek periods. They were, perhaps, merely short-lived  pretenders who were overthrown one by the other before either had  succeeded in establishing himself on the seat of Horus. Be that as it  may, the XVIIIth dynasty drew to its close amid strife and quarreling,  without our being able to discover the cause of its overthrow, or the  name of the last of its sovereigns.***         * Tutankhamon receives the tribute of the Kushites as well       as that of the Syrians; Ai is represented at Shataui in       Nubia as accompanied by Pauiru, the prince of Kush.         ** Wiedemann has collected six royal names which, with much       hesitation, he places about this time.         *** The list of kings who make up the XVIIIth dynasty can be       established with certainty, with the exception of the order       of the three last sovereigns who succeed Khuniatonu. It is       here given in its authentic form, as the monuments have       permitted us to reconstruct it, and in its Greek form as it       is found in the lists of Manetho:         [Illustration: 112.jpg Table]         Manetho's list, as we have it, is a very ill-made extract,       wherein the official kings are mixed up with the legitimate       queens, as well as, at least towards the end, with persons       of doubtful authenticity. Several kings, between Khuniatonu       and Harmhabi, are sometimes added at the end of the list;       some of these I think, belonged to previous dynasties, e.g.       Teti to the VIth, Rahotpu to the XVIIth; several are heroes       of romance, as Mernebphtah or Merkhopirphtah, while the       names of the others are either variants from the cartouche       names of known princes, or else are nicknames, such as was       Sesu, Sesturi for Ramses II. Dr. Mahler believes that he can       fix, within a few days, the date of the kings of whom the       list is composed, from Ahmosis I. to Ai. I hold to the       approximate date which I have given in vol. iv. p. 153 of       this History, and I give the years 1600 to 1350 as the       period of the dynasty, with a possible error of about fifty       years, more or less.    Scarcely half a century had elapsed between the moment when the XVIII's  dynasty reached the height of its power under Amenothes III. and that of  its downfall. It is impossible to introduce with impunity changes of any  kind into the constitution or working of so complicated a machine as an  empire founded on conquest. When the parts of the mechanism have been  once put together and set in motion, and have become accustomed to  work harmoniously at a proper pace, interference with it must not be  attempted except to replace such parts as are broken or worn out, by  others exactly like them. To make alterations while the machine is in  motion, or to introduce new combinations, however ingenious, into any  part of the original plan, might"]]]
