I rejoiced to read thy letter, for it indicated thy progress unto the  Kingdom of thy Glorious Lord, thy wish to serve in His vineyard and thy  faith in this Cause which has shed its light upon those regions.    Blessed art thou for having opened the door of thy home unto the people to  come and hear of the Kingdom.    The maid-servant of God remembered thee in her letter, mentioning thy  great joy and progress in the Cause of thy Lord.    Verily, I pray God to make thy home a center for the radiation of light  and the glowing of His love in the hearts of His people. Know that in  every home where God is praised and prayed to, and His Kingdom proclaimed,  that home is a garden of God and a paradise of His happiness.          \"O Spiritual Assembly !...\"      O Spiritual Assembly(46) !    Everything produces an impression in existence and results in the course  of ages. The (earthly) assemblies established in the different parts of  Europe, Asia and America have no results save the help of the physical and  the mortal life in this lesser world, for the removal of its conditions  and reformation of its customs, and in the end no name will remain  thereof. But every spiritual assembly of solid foundation, good structure  and unwavering constancy will last forever and will send forth its  illumination unto all regions.    Observe the gatherings of the disciples after Christ: Their light is still  shining, their power is still revealing and their trumpets still  resounding throughout the ages. Such is the spiritual meeting.          \"O God! Confirm them in the promotion of Thy...\"      O God! Confirm them in the promotion of Thy Word among the people and in  strengthening and multiplying Thy servants. Verily Thou art the Bounteous,  the Merciful!          \"O ye two birds warbling in the Garden of Wisdom....\"      O ye(47) two birds warbling in the Garden of Wisdom.    Verily, I saw your photographs, whose beauty proved the turning of your  hearts unto the Center of Guidance and the dilation of your breasts by the  appearance of the Kingdom of God. The light of God is verily shining in  the face of the man who is of the Kingdom, spiritual, heavenly, divine and  Bahai. The rest among the people are like animals; nay, they are led  astray from the Path.    Thank God for that He enlightened your faces by the light of guidance,  deposited in your hearts the sign of faith, and made you of the chosen  ones in this new century.    The truth I say unto you! If ye were aware of what God hath destined for  you in the kingdom of His glory, verily ye would rejoice exceedingly and  soar with the wings of joy unto the heights of happiness, crying with the  most loud voice: \"Blessings and happiness from this great attainment and  evident bounty.\"          \"O thou handsome child!...\"      O thou handsome child!    Thy spiritual father and thy good mother sent me thy radiant picture and I  rejoiced on seeing it. I pray God to illumine thy heart with the light of  the Manifestation, to nurture thee in His mercy so that thou mayest attain  maturity in His love; thy spirit be enlightened with beholding His light  and thy spirit revived by the bounty of the Holy Spirit, so that thou  mayest be a sign of the love of God, speaking in the name of God, joyous  by the favors of God, attaining unto the sea of the mercy of God, and  being baptized with the water of life, the fire of love and the spirit of  attraction.          \"O thou blooming rose in the garden of the Love of...\"      O thou blooming rose in the garden of the Love of God!    Verily, the heavenly angels address thee from the Supreme Horizon, saying:  \"O maid-servant of God! Be rejoiced for God hath chosen thee for His love  and sheltered thee under the shade of His Kingdom, the lights of which  shone forth, the signs of which were manifested, the mysteries of which  were unfolded, the fragrance of which emanated, the waves of which surged,  the causes of which were promulgated, the suns of which appeared, the  moons of which shone and the stars of which sparkled.\"    Therefore, praise God for that He honored thee with presence in this great  century and new cycle and caused thee to attain this new bounty.    I ask God to send down upon thee a blessing and upon thy family a favor  from His Kingdom.          \"O thou who art anticipating the appearance of the Gift...\"      O thou who art anticipating the appearance of the Gift of God!    Verily, I read thy letter which indicated that thou hast turned unto the  Blessed Spot, that the Truth (of God) hath revealed itself to thee, that  thy fear is quieted and that thou hast attained to composure, assuredly  believing in this great Cause.    Know thou, verily, there are many veils in which the Truth is enveloped:  gloomy veils; then delicate and transparent veils; then the envelopment of  Light, the sight of which dazzles the eyes, as doth the sun which is  enveloped only in its own light and, as we look at it, the sight is  blinded and eyes are dazzled.    I beg of God to remove all the veilings and familiarize the light with all  eyes, so that man may not be veiled from witnessing the Sun of Truth.    O maid-servant of God! Verily, the tests and trials of God are very great  and very violent. Beseech thou God to protect thee from all doubts and to  guard thee from the interpretations of parabolical(48) verses, as made by  those who know not in what valley they are roving, who speak according to  their own selfish purposes and after their own evil inclinations; who  accept and then reject; who believe in God and then deny Him; and who  appear firm and then backslide: thus thou beholdest these oscillating  daily.    \"Leave them to amuse themselves with their own vain discourses,\" and turn  thou to the light of the Testament, and rejoice at the bounty of the  effulgence, and seek shelter under the shadow of the standard of the  Covenant. Thou wilt soon find it fluttering on the highest summits of  glory, surrounded by the valiant hosts of the angels of heaven and  assisted by spiritual armies of great number that proceed from the Supreme  Concourse.          \"O my tender friend!...\"      O my tender friend!    Verily, the union between myself and thee is on a solid foundation and a  well made basis. Neither the winds can remove it nor the events of time  annihilate it. It is everlasting and eternal, heavenly, spiritual and  divine, and it is of no end or termination. Consequently be rejoiced at  these words which cheer the hearts of the righteous and the souls of the  pious when hearing them.          \"O thou lamp who art illuminated with the light of the...\"      O thou lamp who art illuminated with the light of the Love of God!    Leave thou the world and abandon the people and turn unto the Kingdom of  thy independent Lord. Beseech Him every morn and eve and supplicate to the  Gate of His Oneness to make thee firm and steadfast in the Testament and  to guard thee from all calamities, with the eye of His protection, and  protect thee from the tests which are (so violent) as the whirlwinds which  uproot trees.          \"O thou who hearest and seest in this wonderful Cause!...\"      O thou who hearest and seest in this wonderful Cause!    Verily, I read thy interesting letter, its beautiful composition and I  noted its purpose which indicated spiritual aspiration to the Kingdom of  thy Great Lord.    Thank God for guiding thee unto the Straight Path, manifesting unto thee  the Evident Light. He shall give thee a draught of the cup whereby thy  spiritual power will be increased. Thou shalt advance unto the Lofty  Station, acquire heavenly qualities and attain knowledge of the  significances of the words of God in this glorious day.    It is incumbent upon thee to turn wholly unto the Kingdom of God, to enter  entirely into this wonderful Cause, and to make thy thought, remembrance  and effort confined to the education of thy character, the enlightenment  through the Light of ABHA, and to guide the people to the Source of the  mercy of thy Lord, the Clement, the Merciful.    Comfort thy mother and endeavor to do what is conducive to the happiness  of her heart. Approach not those who are drowned in the sea of this world,  but rather be enkindled by the fire of the love of God. Be thou such a  flame whereby the hearts may be set aglow.    It is incumbent upon thee to assemble continuously with the beloved of God  and to meet with those whose faces are illumined with the light of the  love of God. Verily, I supplicate to God to make thee sincere in this  love, to illumine thee with the light of His Kingdom, to destine unto thee  the illumination by the light of His attributes, to make thee a sign of  mercy, a bird warbling the verses of unity; that thou mayest be nurtured  in the bosom of His providence, and become a growing tree bearing fruit in  the Paradise of El-ABHA.    Verily, thy Lord confirmeth him whom He willeth, and He is the Forgiving,  the Merciful.          \"O thou who art agitated as oceans by the winds blown...\"      O thou who art agitated as oceans by the winds blown from the direction of  the Kingdom of God!    Verily I read thy wonderful letter, declaring the grandeur of thy nature  and the excess of thy love and thine attaining the knowledge of God.  Verily its contents were as spiritual meanings poured forth from a heart  throbbing by the spirit of the love of God. I beseech God to confer on  thee, and on thy noble husband, a perfect favor from His Supreme Kingdom,  until your faces may sparkle by its light, among the creatures, and by  which the fame of your love in God may be renowned among the horizons.    By my life, this is a favor "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19317"],[0,"Gallipoli Diary,  Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"encouraged--so far!    During the afternoon Admirals de Robeck and Wemyss came on board to work  together with the General Staff on technical details. They too have  heard these rumours about the second French Division, and Wemyss is in  dismay at the thought of having to squeeze more ships into Mudros  harbour. His anxiety has given me exactly the excuse I wanted, so I have  dropped this fly just in front of K.'s nose, telling him that \"There are  persistent rumours here amongst the French that General d'Amade's  Command is to be joined by another French Division. Just in case there  is truth in the report you should know that Mudros harbour is as full as  it will hold until our dash for the Peninsula has been made.\" We will  see what he says. If the Division exists, then the Naval people will  recommend Bizerta for their base; the ships can sail right up to the  Peninsula from there and land right away until things on Lemnos and  Tenedos have shaken themselves down.    Our first Taube: it passed over the harbour at a great height. One of  our lumbering seaplanes went up after it like an owl in sunlight, but  could rise no higher than the masts of the Fleet.    _12th April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian.\" Lemnos._ The _Queen Elizabeth_ has  been having some trouble with her engines and in the battle of the 18th  was only able to use one of her propellers. Now she has been overhauled  and the Admiral has asked me to come on board for her steam trials.  These are to take place along the coastline of the Peninsula and I have  got leave to bring with me a party selected from Divisions and Brigades.  So when I went aboard this morning at 8.30 there were about thirty-five  Officers present. Starting at once, we steamed at great pace half way up  the Gulf of Saros and about 1 o'clock turned to go back, slowing down  and closing in to let me take a second good look at the coast. Our  studies were enlivened by an amusing incident. Nearing Cape Helles, the  _Queen Elizabeth_ went astern, so as to test her reverse turbines. The  enemy, who must have been watching us like a mouse does a cat, had the  ill-luck to select just this moment to salute us with a couple of  shells. As they had been allowing for our speed they were ludicrously  out of it, the shot striking the water half a mile ahead. We then lay  off Cape Helles whilst a very careful survey of the whole of that  section was being made. The Turks, disgusted by their own bad aim, did  not fire again. On our way back we passed three fakes, old liners  painted up, funnelled and armed with dummy guns to take off the _Tiger_,  the _Inflexible_ and the _Indomitable_. Riding at anchor there, they had  quite the man-o'-war air and if they draw the teeth of enemy submarines  (their torpedoes), as they are meant to do, the artists should be given  decorations. At 6 p.m. dropped anchor and I transhipped myself to the  _Arcadian_. Birdwood and Hunter-Weston had turned up during the day; the  latter dined and is now more sanguine than myself. He has been getting  to know his new command better and he says that he did not appreciate  the 29th Division when he wrote his appreciation!    _13th April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian.\"_ Heavy squalls of rain and wind last  night. _Band-o-bast_ badly upset; boats also bottoms upwards and at  dawn--here in harbour--we found ourselves clean cut off from the shore.  What a ticklish affair the great landing is going to be! How much at the  mercy of the winds and waves! Aeolus and Neptune have hardly lost power  since Greeks and Trojans made history out yonder!    Have sent K. an electrical pick-me-up saying that the height of the  _Queen Elizabeth_ fire control station had enabled me to see the lie of  the land better than on my previous reconnaissance, and that, given good  luck, we hope to get ashore without too great a loss.    In the afternoon the wind moderated and I spent an hour or two watching  practice landings by Senegalese. Our delay is loss, but yet not clear  loss; that's a sure thing. These niggy-wigs were as awkward as  golly-wogs in the boats. Every extra hour's practice will save some  lives by teaching them how to make short work of the ugliest bit of  their job.    _14th April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian,\" Lemnos._ A day so exquisitely lovely  that it should be chronicled in deathless verse. But we gaze at the  glassy sea and turn to the deep blue cloudless sky, victory our only  thought.    Colonel Dick, King's Messenger, has arrived bringing letters up to 3rd  instant. Or rather, he was supposed to have brought them, and it was  hoped the abundance of his intelligence would have borne some relation  to the cost of his journey,--about L80 it has been reckoned. As a matter  of fact, apart from some rubbish, he brings _one_ letter for me; none  for any of the others. Not even a file of newspapers; not even a  newspaper! In India many, many years ago, we used to call Dick _Burra  dik hai_, Hindustani for, _it is a great worry_. So he is only playing  up to his sobriquet. The little ewe lamb is an epistle from Fitz giving  me a lively sketch of the rumpus at the War Office when its pontiffs  grasped for the first time the true bearing of their own orders. There  was a rush to saddle poor us with the delay as soon as the Cabinet began  to show impatience. They seem to have expected the 29th Division to  arrive at top speed in a united squadron to rush straightway ashore.  They don't yet quite realise, I daresay, that not one of their lovely  ships has yet put in an appearance. That the men who packed the  transports and fixed their time tables should say we are too slow is  hardly playing the game.    Never lose your hair: that is a good soldier's motto. My cable of last  night, wherein I tried to calm their minds by telling them the sea was  rough and that, even if every one had been here with gaiter buttons  complete, I must have waited for a change in the weather, has answered  Fitz's letter by anticipation.    Worked all day in my office like a nigger and by mid-day had got almost  as black as my simile! We are coaling and life has grown dark and noisy.  In the middle of it, Ashmead-Bartlett came aboard to see me. He has his  quarters on the _Queen Elizabeth_ as one of the Admiralty authorised  Press Correspondents, or rather, as the only authorised correspondent.  In Manchuria he was known and his writing was well liked. When he had  gone, de Robeck and I put through a good lot of business very smoothly.  A little later on, Captain Ivanoff, commanding H.I.M.S. _Askold_, (a  Russian cruiser well-known to fame in Manchurian days), did me the  honour to call.    After lunch went ashore and saw parties of Australians at embarking and  disembarking drill. Colonel Paterson, the very man who bear-led me on  tour during my Australian inspection, was keeping an eye on the \"Boys.\"  The work of the Australians and Senegalese gave us a good object lesson  of the relative brain capacities of the two races. Next I went and  inspected the Armoured Car Section of the Royal Naval Division under  Lieutenant-Commander Wedgwood. He is a mighty queer chap. Took active  part in the South African War. Afterwards became a pacifist M.P.; here  he is again with war paint and tomahawk. Give me a Pacifist in peace and  a Jingo in war. Too often it is the other way about.    All this took me on to 5.30 p.m. and when I came back on board,  Hunter-Weston was here. He has been out since last night on H.M.S.  _Dartmouth_ to inspect the various landing places. His whole tone about  the Expedition has been transformed. Now he has become the most sanguine  of us all. He has great hopes that we shall have Achi Baba in our hands  by sunset on the day of landing. If so he thinks we need have no fear  for the future.    All is worked out now and I do not quite see how we could improve upon  our scheme with the means at our disposal. If these \"means\" included a  larger number of boats and steam launches, then certainly, by  strengthening our forces on either flank, viz., at Morto Bay (where we  are sending only one Battalion) and at a landing under the cliffs a mile  West of Krithia (where we are sending one Battalion), we should greatly  better our chances. Also, a battery of field guns attached to the Morto  Bay column, and a couple of mountain guns added to the Krithia column  would add to our prospects of making a real big scoop. But we cannot  spare the sea transport except by too much weakening and delaying the  landing at the point of the Peninsula; nor dare I leave myself without  any reserve under my own hand. I am inclined, all the same, to squeeze  one Marine Battalion out of the Naval Division to strengthen our threat  to Krithia. Hunter-Weston will be in executive command of everything  South of Achi Baba; Birdwood of everything to the North.    I went very closely with Hunter-Weston into the question of a day or  night attack. My own leanings are in favour of the first boat-loads  getting ashore before break of dawn, but Hunter-Weston is clear and  strong for daylight. There is a very strong current running round the  point; the exact lie of the beaches is unknown and he thinks the  confusion inseparable from any landing will be so aggravated by  attempting it in the dark that he had rather face the losses the men in  boats must suffer from aimed fire. Executively he is responsible and he  is backed by his naval associates.    Birdwood, on the other hand, is of one mind with me and is going to get  his first boat-loads ashore before it is light enough to aim. He has no  current to trouble him, it is true, but he is not landing on any  surveyed beach and the opposition he will meet with is even more unknown  than in the case of Helles and Sedd-el-Bahr.    When a sportsman goes shark fishing, he should beware lest he be  mistaken for the bait. Gaily I cast my fly over K. and now he has  snapped off my head. That story about a second French Division was  false. K."]]]
