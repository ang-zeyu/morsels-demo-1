Mr. Saxon, like many parents, pooh-poohed his  boy's business efforts, and would sometimes--to Egbert's huge  indignation--point out his mistakes before the clerks. He would declare,  in a high and mighty way, that his own son should not receive special  preference at the office, and so overdid his attitude of impartiality  that he contrived to give him a worse time than any of his other  articled pupils.    Athelstane, who had begun his medical course at the University of  Birkshaw, also had his troubles. He had hoped to study at Guy's Hospital  in preparation for the London M.D., and to an ambitious young fellow it  was hard to be satisfied with a provincial degree. The thirty-mile motor  ride to and from Birkshaw soon lost its charm, and the difficulties of  home study in the evenings were great in a bungalow with thin partition  walls and a family not always disposed to quiet. As a rule, he kept his  feelings to himself, but he went about with a depressed look, and got  into a habit of lifting his eyebrows which was leaving permanent lines  on a hitherto smooth and unwrinkled forehead.    Pretty Quenrede, who had just left school, was going through the awkward  phase of discovering her individuality. At the College, with a full  program of lessons and games, she had followed the general lead of the  form. Now, cast upon her own resources, she was quite vague as to any  special bent or taste. The war-time occupations which had tempted her  imagination were no longer available, and _Careers for Women_ did not  attract her, even if family funds had run to the necessary training. So,  for the present, she stayed at home, going once a week to the School of  Art at Grovebury, and practicing singing in a rather desultory fashion.  Though she pretended to be glad she was an emancipated young lady, as a  matter of fact she missed school immensely, and was finding life  decidedly slow and tame.    With their elders palpably dissatisfied, Ingred and Hereward would have  been hardly human if they had not raised some personal grievances of  their own to grumble at, and matters would often have been dismal enough  at the bungalow but for Mrs. Saxon's happy capacity for looking on the  bright side of things. The whole household centered round \"Mother.\" She  was a woman in a thousand. Naturally it had hurt her to relinquish  Rotherwood, and it grieved her--for the girls' sake--that most of her  old acquaintances in Grovebury had not troubled to pay calls at  Wynchcote. The small rooms, the one maid from the Orphanage, the  necessity of doing much of the housework herself, the difficulties of  shopping on a limited purse, and her husband's fretfulness and  fault-finding, might have soured a less unselfish disposition: she had  married, however, \"for better or for worse,\" and took the altered  circumstances with cheery optimism. She was a great lover of nature and  of scenery, and the nearness of the moors, with their ever-changing  effects of storm and sunshine, and the opportunities they gave for the  study of birds and insects, proved compensation for some of the things  which life otherwise lacked.    Every morning, after the fuss of getting off the family to their several  avocations, she would run down the garden, and stand for a few minutes  by the wall that overlooked the moor, watching great shafts of sunlight  fall from a gray sky on to brown wastes of heather and bracken,  listening to the call of the curlews or to the trilling autumn warble of  the robin, perched on the red-berried hawthorn bush. Kind Mother Nature  could always soothe her spirits, and send her back with fresh courage  for the day's work. And, in the evening, when husband and children came  home to fire and lamp-light, she had generally some nature notes to tell  them, or some amusing little incident to make them laugh and forget  their various woes and worries.    \"I'm so glad, Muvvie dear, you're not a melancholy lugubrious person!\"  said Ingred once. \"It would be _so_ trying if you sat at the tea-table  and sighed.\"    \"Humor is the salt of life,\" smiled Mrs. Saxon. \"We may just as well get  all the fun out of the little daily happenings. Even 'the orphan' has  her bright side!\"    As \"the orphan\" was a temporary member of the Wynchcote establishment  she merits a word of description. She came from an institution in the  neighborhood, and, being the only servant procurable at the time, was  tolerated in spite of a terrible propensity for smashing plates, and for  carolling at the very pitch of a nasal voice. She was a rough,  good-tempered girl, devoted to Minx, the cat, and really kind if anybody  had a headache or toothache, but quite without any sense of  discrimination: she would show a traveling hawker into the drawing-room,  and leave the clergyman standing on the doorstep, took the best  serviettes to wipe the china, scoured the silver with Monkey Brand Soap,  and systematically bespattered the kitchen tablecloth with ink. Her love  of music was a terrible trial to the medical student of the family on  Saturday morning, when he was endeavoring to read at home.    \"Carlyle says somewhere: 'Give, oh, give me a man who sings at his  work!'\" growled Athelstane one day, bursting forth from his den to  complain of the nuisance, \"but I bet the old buffer didn't write that  sentiment with a maid-servant howling popular songs in the next room.  According to all accounts he loathed noise and couldn't even stand the  crowing of a cock. I should call that bit of eloquence just bunkum. If  the orphan doesn't stop this voice-production business I shall have to  go and slay her. How _can_ a fellow study in the midst of such a racket?  Where's the Mater? Down in Grovebury? I suppose that accounts for it.  While the cat's away, &c.\"    \"Hardly complimentary to compare your maternal relative to a cat!\"  chuckled Ingred. \"Stop the orphan if you can, but you might as well try  to stop the brook! She's quiet for five minutes then bursts out into  song again like a chirruping cricket or a croaking corn-crake. I want to  spiflicate her myself sometimes.\"        \"'Late last night I slew my wife,      Stretched her on the parquet flooring;      I was loath to take her life,      But I _had_ to stop her snoring!'\"    quoted Hereward from _Ruthless Rhymes_.    \"Look here!\" said Quenrede, emerging from the kitchen with a half-packed  lunch basket. \"We three are taking sandwiches, and going for a good old  tramp over the moors. Why not drop your work for once and come with us?  You look as if you needed a holiday.\"    \"I've a beast of a headache,\" admitted Athelstane.    \"You want fresh air, not study,\" decreed Quenrede with sisterly  firmness, \"and I shall just make some extra sandwiches and put another  apple in the basket. With mother out, the orphan will carol all the  morning, unless you gag her, so you may as well accept the inevitable.\"    \"Cut and run, in fact!\" added Hereward.    \"The voice of the siren tempts me to go--to escape the voice of the  siren who stays!\" wavered Athelstane.    \"Oh, come along, old sport!\" urged Ingred. \"What are a few old bones to  Red Ridge Barrow? You can swat to-night to make up, if you want to.\"    \"It's three to one!\" said Athelstane, giving way gracefully; \"and there  mayn't be any more fine Saturdays for walks.\"    The four young people started forth with the delightful sense of having  the day before them. It was fairly early, and a hazy November sun had  not yet drawn the moisture from the heather. On the moor the few trees  were bare, but the golden autumn leaves still clothed the woods in the  sheltered valley that stretched below. Masses of gossamer covered with  dew-drops lay among the bracken, like fairies' washing hung out to dry.  There was a hint of hoarfrost under the bushes. The air had that  delicious invigorating quality when every breath sets the body dancing.  It was too late in the year for flowers, though here and there a little  gorse lingered, or a few buttercups and hawkweeds. After about an hour  of red haziness the sun pierced the bank of mist and shone out  gloriously, almost as in summer; the birds, ready to snatch a moment's  joy, were flitting about tweeting and calling, a water-wagtail took a  bath in a shallow pool of a stream, and a great flock of bramblings,  rare visitors in those parts, paused in their migration to hold a  chattering conference round an old elder tree.    The Saxons were determined to-day to go farther afield than their walks  had hitherto taken them. The local guide-book mentioned some prehistoric  menhirs and a chambered barrow on the top of Red Ridge, a distant hill,  so they had fixed that as their Mecca.    It was a considerable tramp, but the bracing air helped them on, and  they sat down at last to eat their lunch by the side of the path that  led to the summit. The boys had wished to mount to the top without  calling a halt, but the girls had struck, and insisted on a rest before  the final climb.    \"Pity Mother isn't here!\" said Ingred, voicing the general feeling of  the family, which always missed its central pivot.    \"Yes, but it would have been too great a trapse for her, poor darling!\"  qualified Quenrede. \"I don't see how we could get her all this way  unless we hired a pony.\"    \"Or borrowed an aeroplane. One seems about as possible as the other,\"  grunted Ingred.    \"She shall have a photo of the stones at any rate,\" said Hereward,  fingering his camera. \"Hurry up and finish, you girls, or the light will  be gone!\"    \"Well, we can't bolt our sandwiches at the rate you do! I wonder you  don't choke!\"    The old gray stones stood in a circle on the top of the hill, from  whence they had possibly seen four thousand summers and winters pass by.  Whether their original purpose was temple, astronomical observatory, or  both is one of the riddles of antiquarian research, for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18525"],[0,"On the Trail: An Outdoor Book for Girls (#17)"],[1,"ss. Also one must learn to be  fearless. It is said that while animals may not understand our language  they do understand, or feel, our attitude toward them; and if it is that  of fear or dislike we stand little chance of really knowing them, to say  nothing of establishing any kind of friendly relations with them. By  quiet watchfulness, keenness of sight and hearing, you may obtain a  certain amount of knowledge of their ways, but when you add real  sympathy and kindly feeling you gain their confidence and friendship.  Make them understand that you will not interfere with or harm them, and  they will go about their own affairs unafraid in your presence. Then you  may silently watch their manner of living, their often amusing habits,  and their frank portrayal of character. As a guest in the wild,  conducting yourself as a courteous guest should, you will be well  treated by your wild hosts, some of whom, in time, may even permit you  to feed and stroke them. They do not dislike but fear you; they would  rather be your friends than your enemies. The baby animal which has not  yet learned to fear a human being will sometimes, when in danger, run to  you for protection. This must win your heart if nothing else can.    [Illustration: Making friends with a ruffed grouse.]      =Stalking=    You may stalk an animal by remaining quiet as well as by following its  trail. To even see some of the inhabitants of woods, fields, and shore  you must be willing to exercise great patience and conform to their  method of hiding by remaining absolutely still. It is the thing that  moves that they fear. Some of the animals appear not even to see a  person who remains motionless. At any rate, they ignore him as they do a  stump or stone.    For this quiet stalking, find as comfortable a seat as you can where you  have reason to think some kind of animal or animals will pass and resign  yourself to immovable waiting. If the rock beneath you grows  unreasonably hard or the tree roots develop sharp edges, or the ground  sends up unnoticed stones of torment; if your foot \"goes to sleep\" or  your nose itches, bear the annoyances bravely and your reward will be  sure and ample. If the wait is unduly long and movement of some kind  becomes imperative, let such movement be made so slowly as to be almost  imperceptible. Remember that unseen, suspicious eyes will be attracted  by any sudden action and the faintest sound will be heard, for these  spell danger to the wilderness folk and if frightened away they are not  apt to return.    Keep your ears open to detect the first sound of approaching life. There  is a thrill in this experience, and another when the animal you have  heard comes boldly out before you. Then it is you will find that, in  some mysterious way, all bodily discomfort has vanished. Your whole  being is absorbed in the movements of the creature who is unconscious of  your presence, and there is no room for other sensations. More animals  may appear and perhaps a little drama may be enacted as if for your  benefit.    [Illustration: Found on the trail.    Chipmunk and white-footed mouse, panther, kangaroo rat, raccoon, and  weasel.]    It may be a tragedy, it may be a comedy, or it may be only a bit of  every-day family life; but you do not know the plot nor how many actors  will take part, and your very uncertainty adds zest to the situation.      =Animals Found on the Trail=    The animals most frequently seen in the woods where there is no longer  any large game are the chipmunk, the red, the gray, and the black  squirrel, the rabbit and hare, the fox, weasel, pine-marten, woodchuck,  raccoon, opossum, and skunk, also the pack-rat (of the west), the  white-footed and field mouse. In deeper and wilder forests there are  deer and porcupine, though deer are found quite near habitations at  times. In more remote places there are the moose and caribou; the bear,  mountain-lion, lynx or wildcat, and the timber-wolf. The wolf is,  however, equally at home in the open and at this day is most plentiful  on the wide plains of the west. Unless your trail leads through the  remote wilderness, you will hardly come across the more savage animals,  and when you do invade their territory it will give you greater courage  to call to mind the fact that they, as well as the smaller wild things,  are afraid of man. Our most experienced hunters and our best writers on  the subject of animal life agree that a wild animal's first emotion upon  seeing a human being is undoubtedly _fear_. When you come upon one  suddenly you may feel sure that he is as much frightened as you are and  will probably turn aside to avoid you unless he thinks you are going to  attack him. All wild creatures are afraid of fire, therefore the  camp-fire is a barrier they will not pass, and a blazing firebrand will  drive any of them away.    [Illustration: Timber wolves.]      =Birds=    Among the feathered tribes of the woods you will find the owl, the  woodcock, and the grouse. Of the smaller birds, the nuthatch, the wood  and hermit thrush, whippoorwill, woodpeckers, wood-pewee, and others.  Most of the birds prefer the edge of the woods, where they can dip into  the sunshine and take long flights through the free air of the open; but  the hermit-thrush, shyest and sweetest of singers, makes his home deep  in the silent, shadowy forest. In these depths, and oftenest near a bog  or marsh, you may also hear the call of the partridge, or more properly,  the ruffed grouse. As given by the writer William J. Long, the call is  like this:    \"Prut, prut, pr-r-r-rt! Whit-kwit? Pr-r-r-rt, pr-r-r-rt! Ooo-it, ooo-it?  Pr-r-reeee!\"    Or perhaps you will be startled by the rolling drum-call. This begins  slowly, increases rapidly, and ends something like this: \"Dum! dum! dum!  dum-dum-dum-dumdumdum!\" The drum-call is made by the male bird who,  beating the air with his wings, produces the sound. It is said to be a  mating-call, but is heard at other times as well, long after the  mating-season is over.    [Illustration: Baby moose.]      =Stalking the Ruffed Grouse=    If you want to see the birds, stalk them when you hear their call. Wait  until you locate the direction of the sound, then walk silently and  follow it. As soon as the birds are sighted slip from one tree to  another, stopping instantly when you think they may see you, until you  can conceal yourself behind a bush, tree, or stump near enough for you  to peer around and have a good view of your game. It may sometimes be  necessary to drop to your knees in order to keep out of sight. If you  have heard the drum it is the cock that you have stalked and, if early  in the season, you will soon see his demure little mate steal through  the underbrush to meet her lordly master as he stands proudly on an old  log awaiting her. The \"whit-kwit\" call may lead you to the hen grouse  with her brood of little chicks which are so much the color of the brown  leaves you will not see them until they move. If the call comes later in  the year you may come upon a flock of well-grown young birds who have  left their mother and are now following a leader.    The ruffed grouse is a beautiful bird. He is yellowish-brown or rusty,  splashed with black or dark brown, and white, with under-parts of a  light buff. His beak is short and on his small, dainty head he carries  his crest proudly. His shoulders bear epaulets of dark feathers, called  the ruff, and his fan-like tail is banded and cross-barred. The nest of  the grouse is on the ground, usually against a fallen log, at the foot  of a tree, or in a hollow made by the roots; or it may be hidden amid  underbrush. It is easily overlooked, being made of dry leaves with,  perhaps, some feathers. In the season it contains from eight to fourteen  eggs.      =Woodcock=    The woodcock, another forest bird, seldom shows himself in broad  daylight except when hunted; then he will rise a few feet, fly a short  distance, drop and run, hiding again as quickly as he can. You will know  the woodcock from the ruffed grouse by his _long bill_, his short legs,  and his very short tail. He frequents the banks of wooded streams or the  bogs of the forests and, like the grouse, nests on the ground; but the  woodcock's nest seldom contains more than four eggs.    [Illustration: Stalking wild birds.]      =Beaver=    Along the shores of sluggish streams, of lonely lakes and ponds, you may  see the beaver, the muskrat, very rarely the otter, and sometimes an  ugly little, long-bodied animal belonging to the marten family called  the fisher. These are all interesting, each in its own way, and well  worth hours of quiet observation. The beaver, otter, and fisher choose  wild, secluded places for their homes, but the muskrat may be found also  in the marshes of farm lands. On the edges of our Long Island meadows  the boys trap muskrats for their skins.    You will find the beaver house in the water close to the shore and  overlapping it. Though strongly and carefully built, it looks very much  like a jumble of small driftwood, with bleached sticks well packed  together, and the ends standing out at all angles. The sticks are  stripped of their bark and the house gleams whitely against the dark  water. The houses vary in size, some being built as high as five feet.  The beaver is rarely seen early in the day, most of his work is done at  night, so the best time to watch for him is just before dusk or perhaps  an hour before sundown. It is not well to wait to see the beaver if your  trail back to camp is a long one, leading through dense forests. You  would far better postpone making its acquaintance than to risk going  over the, perhaps, treacherous paths after dark. Night comes early in  the woods and darkness shuts down closely while it is still light in the  open. If your camp is near the beaver house or beaver dam, or if your  trip can be made by water, then, with no anxiety about your return, you"]]]
