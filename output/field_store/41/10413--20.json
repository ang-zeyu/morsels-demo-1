I speak as to the wise, judge ye what I say.    The adjective _that_ has obtained a very extensive application in  language. However, it may seem to vary in its different positions, it  still retains its primitive meaning. It is comprised of _the_ and _it_,  thait, theat, thaet (Saxon,) thata (Gothic,) dat (Dutch.) It is the most  decided definitive in our language. It is by use applied to things in  the singular, or to a multitude of things regarded as a whole. By use,  it applies to a collection of ideas expressed in a sentence; as, it was  resolved, _that_. What? Then follows _that fact_ which was resolved.  \"Provided _that_, in case he does\" so and so. \"It was agreed _that_,\"  _that fact_ was agreed to which is about to be made known. I wish you to  understand, all thro these lectures, _that_ I shall honestly endeavor to  expose error and establish truth. Wish you to understand _what_? _that  fact_, afterwards stated, \"I shall endeavor,\" &c. You can not mistake my  meaning: _that_ would be impossible. What would be impossible? Why, to  mistake my meaning.    You can not fail to observe the true character of this word called by  our grammarians \"adjective pronoun,\" \"relative pronoun,\" and  \"conjunction.\" They did not think to look for its meaning. Had that  (duty) been done, it would have stood forth in its true character, an  important defining word.    The only difficulty in the explanation of this word, originates in the  fact, that it was formerly applied to the plural as well as singular  number. It is now applied to the singular only when referring directly  to an object; as, _that man_. And it never should be used otherwise. But  we often see phrases like this; \"These are the men _that_ rebeled.\" It  should be, \"these are the men _who_ rebeled.\" This difficulty can not be  overcome in existing grammars on any other ground. In modern writings,  such instances are rare. _This_ and _that_ are applied to the singular;  _these_ and _those_ to the plural.           *       *       *       *       *    =What= is a compound of two original words, and often retains the  meaning of both, when employed as a compound relative, \"having in itself  both the antecedent and the relative,\" as our authors tell us. But when  it is dissected, it will readily enough be understood to be an  adjective, defining things under particular relations.    But I shall weary your patience, I fear, if I stay longer in this place  to examine the etymology of small words. I intended to have shown the  meaning and use of many words included in the list of conjunctions,  which are truly adjectives, such as _both_, _as_, _so_, _neither_,  _and_, etc.; but I let them pass for the present, to be resumed under  the head of contractions.    From the view we have given of this class of words, we are saved the  tediousness of studying the grammatical distinctions made in the books,  where no real distinctions exist. In character these words are like  adjectives; their meaning, like the meaning of all other words, is  peculiar to themselves. Let that be known, and there will be little  difficulty in classing them. We need not confuse the learner with  \"adjective pronouns, possessive adjective pronouns, distributive  adjective pronouns, demonstrative adjective pronouns, _indefinite_  adjective pronouns,\" nor any other adjective pronouns, which can never  be understood nor explained. Children will be slow to apprehend the  propriety of a union of _adjectives_ and _pronouns_, when told that the  former is always used _with_ a noun, and never _for_ one; and the latter  always _for_ a noun, but never _with_ one; and yet, that there is such a  strange combination as a \"_distributive or indefinite adjective  pronoun_,\"--\"confusion worse confounded.\"    In the french language, the gender of adjectives is varied so as to  agree with the nouns to which they belong. \"Possessive pronouns,\" as  they are called, come under the same rule, which proves them to be in  character, and formation, adjectives; else the person using them must  change gender. The father says, _ma_ (feminine) _fille_, my daughter;  and the mother, _mon_ (masculine) _fils_, my son; the same as they would  say, _bon pere_, good father; _bonne mere_, good mother; or, in Latin,  _bonus pater_, or _bona mater_; or, in Spanish, _bueno padre_, _buena  madre_. In the two last languages, as well as all others, where the  adjectives vary the termination so as to agree with the noun, the same  fact may be observed in reference to their \"pronouns.\" If it is a fact  that these words are _pronouns_, that is, stand for other _nouns_, then  the father is _feminine_, and the mother is _masculine_; and whoever  uses them in reference to the opposite sex must change gender to do so.           *       *       *       *       *    Describing adjectives admit of variation to express different degrees of  comparison. The regular degrees have been reckoned three; positive,  comparative, and superlative. These are usually marked by changing the  termination. The _positive_ is determined by a comparison with other  things; as, a great house, a small book, compared with others of their  kind. This is truly a comparative degree. The _comparative_ adds _er_;  as, a great_er_ house, a small_er_ book. The _superlative_, _est_; as,  the great_est_ house, the small_est_ book.    Several adjectives express a comparison less than the positive, others  increase or diminish the regular degrees; as, whit_ish_ white, _very_  white, _pure_ white; whit_er_, _considerable_ whiter, _much_ whiter;  whit_est_, the _very_ whitest, _much_ the whitest _beyond all  comparison_, so that there can be none _whiter_, nor _so white_.    We make an aukward use of the words _great_ and _good_, in the  comparison of things; as, a _good deal_, or _great deal_ whiter; a  _good_ many men, or a _great_ many men. As we never hear of a _small_  deal, or a _bad_ deal whiter, nor of a _bad many_, nor _little many_, it  would be well to avoid such phrases.    The words which are added to other adjectives, to increase or diminish  the comparison, or assist in their definition, may properly be called  _secondary adjectives_, for such is their character. They do not refer  to the thing to be _defined_ or _described_, but to the adjective which  is affected, in some way, by them. They are easily distinguished from  the rest by noticing this fact. Take for example: \"A _very dark red_ raw  silk lady's dress handkerchief.\" The resolution of this sentence would  stand thus:        _A_ (                                               ) handkerchief.       A  (           ) _red_ (                           ) handkerchief.       A  (    ) _dark_  red  (                           ) handkerchief.       A  _very_  dark   red  (                           ) handkerchief.       A   very   dark   red  (   ) _silk_ (              ) handkerchief.       A   very   dark   red  _raw_  silk  (              ) handkerchief.       A   very   dark   red   raw   silk  (      ) _dress_ handkerchief.       A   very   dark   red   raw   silk  _lady's_  dress  handkerchief.    We might also observe that _hand_ is an adjective, compounded by use  with _kerchief_. It is derived from the french word _couvrir_, to cover,  and _chef_, the head. It means a head dress, a cloth to cover, a neck  cloth, a napkin. By habit we apply it to a single article, and speak of  _neck_ handkerchief.    The nice shade of meaning, and the appropriate use of adjectives, is  more distinctly marked in distinguishing colors than in any thing else,  for the simple reason, that there is nothing in nature so closely  observed. For instance, take the word _green_, derived from _grain_,  because it is grain color, or the color of the fair carpet of nature in  spring and summer. But this hue changes from the _deep grass green_, to  the light olive, and words are chosen to express the thousand varying  tints produced by as many different objects. In the adaptation of  language to the expression of ideas, we do not separate these shades of  color from the things in which such colors are supposed to reside. Hence  we talk of _grass_, _pea_, _olive_, _leek_, _verdigris_, _emerald_,  _sea_, and _bottle_ green; also, of _light_, _dark_, _medium_; _very_  light, or dark grass, pea, olive, or _invisible_ green.    _Red_, as a word, means _rayed_. It describes the appearance or  substance produced when _rayed_, reddened, or radiated by the morning  beams of the sun, or any other _radiating_ cause.    _Wh_ is used for _qu_, in white, which means _quite_, _quited_,  _quitted_, _cleared_, _cleansed_ of all _color_, _spot_, or _stain_.    _Blue_ is another spelling for _blew_. Applied to color, it describes  something in appearance to the sky, when the clouds and mists are  _blown_ away, and the clear _blue ether_ appears.    You will be pleased with the following extract from an eloquent writer  of the last century,[9] who, tho somewhat extravagant in some of his  speculations, was, nevertheless, a close observer of nature, which he  studied as it is, without the aid of human theories. The beauty of the  style, and the correctness of the sentiment, will be a sufficient  apology for its length.    \"We shall employ a method, not quite so learned, to convey an idea of  the generation of colors, and the decomposition of the solar ray.  Instead of examining them in a prism of glass, we shall consider them in  the heavens, and there we shall behold the five primordial colours  _unfold themselves_ in the order which we have indicated.    \"In a fine summer's night, when the sky is loaded only with some light  vapours, sufficient to stop and to refract the rays of the sun, walk out  into an open plain, where the first fires of Aurora may be perceptible.  You will first observe the horizon _whiten_ at the spot where she is to  make her appearance; and this radiance, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17607"],[0,"Superstition In All Ages (1732) (#17)"],[1,"that these two substances, so  different in essence, always act in harmony. You will tell us that this  harmony is a mystery; and I will tell you that I do not see my soul,  that I know and feel but my body; that it is my body which feels, which  reflects, which judges, which suffers, and which enjoys, and that all of  its faculties are the necessary results of its own mechanism or of its  organization.          CI.--THE EXISTENCE OF A SOUL IS AN ABSURD SUPPOSITION, AND THE EXISTENCE  OF AN IMMORTAL SOUL IS A STILL MORE ABSURD SUPPOSITION.    Although it is impossible for men to have the least idea of the soul, or  of this pretended spirit which animates them, they persuade themselves,  however, that this unknown soul is exempt from death; everything proves  to them that they feel, think, acquire ideas, enjoy or suffer, but by  the means of the senses or of the material organs of the body. Even  admitting the existence of this soul, one can not refuse to recognize  that it depends wholly on the body, and suffers conjointly with it all  the vicissitudes which it experiences itself; and however it is imagined  that it has by its nature nothing analogous with it; it is pretended  that it can act and feel without the assistance of this body; that  deprived of this body and robbed of its senses, this soul will be able  to live, to enjoy, to suffer, be sensitive of enjoyment or of rigorous  torments. Upon such a tissue of conjectural absurdities the wonderful  opinion of the immortality of the soul is built.    If I ask what ground we have for supposing that the soul is immortal:  they reply, it is because man by his nature desires to be immortal, or  to live forever. But I rejoin, if you desire anything very much, is it  sufficient to conclude that this desire will be fulfilled? By what  strange logic do they decide that a thing can not fail to happen because  they ardently desire it to happen? Man's childish desires of the  imagination, are they the measure of reality? Impious people, you say,  deprived of the flattering hopes of another life, desire to be  annihilated. Well, have they not just as much right to conclude by this  desire that they will be annihilated, as you to conclude that you will  exist forever because you desire it?          CII.--IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE WHOLE OF MAN DIES.    Man dies entirely. Nothing is more evident to him who is not delirious.  The human body, after death, is but a mass, incapable of producing any  movements the union of which constitutes life. We no longer see  circulation, respiration, digestion, speech, or reflection. It is  claimed then that the soul has separated itself from the body. But to  say that this soul, which is unknown, is the principle of life, is  saying nothing, unless that an unknown force is the invisible principle  of imperceptible movements. Nothing is more natural and more simple than  to believe that the dead man lives no more, nothing more absurd than to  believe that the dead man is still living.    We ridicule the simplicity of some nations whose fashion is to bury  provisions with the dead--under the idea that this food might be useful  and necessary to them in another life. Is it more ridiculous or more  absurd to believe that men will eat after death than to imagine that  they will think; that they will have agreeable or disagreeable ideas;  that they will enjoy; that they will suffer; that they will be conscious  of sorrow or joy when the organs which produce sensations or ideas are  dissolved and reduced to dust? To claim that the souls of men will be  happy or unhappy after the death of the body, is to pretend that man  will be able to see without eyes, to hear without ears, to taste without  a palate, to smell without a nose, and to feel without hands and without  skin. Nations who believe themselves very rational, adopt, nevertheless,  such ideas.          CIII.--INCONTESTABLE PROOFS AGAINST THE SPIRITUALITY OF THE SOUL.    The dogma of the immortality of the soul assumes that the soul is a  simple substance, a spirit; but I will always ask, what is a spirit? It  is, you say, a substance deprived of expansion, incorruptible, and which  has nothing in common with matter. But if this is true, how came your  soul into existence? how did it grow? how did it strengthen? how weaken  itself, get out of order, and grow old with your body? In reply to all  these questions, you say that they are mysteries; but if they are  mysteries, you understand nothing about them. If you do not understand  anything about them, how can you positively affirm anything about them?  In order to believe or to affirm anything, it is necessary at least to  know what that consists of which we believe and which we affirm. To  believe in the existence of your immaterial soul, is to say that you are  persuaded of the existence of a thing of which it is impossible for you  to form any true idea; it is to believe in words without attaching any  sense to them; to affirm that the thing is as you claim, is the highest  folly or assumption.          CIV.--THE ABSURDITY OF SUPERNATURAL CAUSES, WHICH THEOLOGIANS CONSTANTLY        CALL TO THEIR AID.    Are not theologians strange reasoners? As soon as they can not guess the  natural causes of things, they invent causes, which they call  supernatural; they imagine them spirits, occult causes, inexplicable  agents, or rather words much more obscure than the things which they  attempt to explain. Let us remain in nature when we desire to understand  its phenomena; let us ignore the causes which are too delicate to be  seized by our organs; and let us be assured that by seeking outside of  nature we can never find the solution of nature's problems. Even upon  the theological hypothesis--that is to say, supposing an Almighty motor  in matter--what right have theologians to refuse their God the power to  endow this matter with thought? Would it be more difficult for Him to  create combinations of matter from which results thought, than spirits  which think? At least, in supposing a substance endowed with thought, we  could form some idea of the object of our thoughts, or of what thinks in  us; while attributing thought to an immaterial being, it is impossible  for us to form the least idea of it.          CV.--IT IS FALSE THAT MATERIALISM CAN BE DEBASING TO THE HUMAN RACE.    Materialism, it is objected, makes of man a mere machine, which is  considered very debasing to the human race. But will the human race be  more honored when it can be said that man acts by the secret impulsions  of a spirit, or a certain something which animates him without his  knowing how? It is easy to perceive that the superiority which is given  to mind over matter, or to the soul over the body, is based upon the  ignorance of the nature of this soul; while we are more familiarized  with matter or the body, which we imagine we know, and of which we  believe we have understood the springs; but the most simple movements of  our bodies are, for every thinking man, enigmas as difficult to divine  as thought.          CVI.--CONTINUATION.    The esteem which so many people have for the spiritual substance,  appears to result from the impossibility they find in defining it in an  intelligible way. The contempt which our metaphysicians show for matter,  comes from the fact that \"familiarity breeds contempt.\" When they tell  us that the soul is more excellent and noble than the body, they tell us  nothing, except that what they know nothing about must be more beautiful  than that of which they have some faint ideas.          CVII.--THE DOGMA OF ANOTHER LIFE IS USEFUL BUT FOR THOSE WHO PROFIT BY IT  AT THE EXPENSE OF THE CREDULOUS PUBLIC.    We are constantly told of the usefulness of the dogma of life hereafter.  It is pretended that even if it should be a fiction, it is advantageous,  because it imposes upon men and leads them to virtue. But is it true  that this dogma renders men wiser and more virtuous? The nations where  this fiction is established, are they remarkable for the morality of  their conduct? Is not the visible world always preferred to the  invisible world? If those who are charged to instruct and to govern men  had themselves enlightenment and virtue, they would govern them far  better by realities than by vain chimeras; but deceitful, ambitious, and  corrupt, the legislators found it everywhere easier to put the nations  to sleep by fables than to teach them truths; than to develop their  reason; than to excite them to virtue by sensible and real motives; than  to govern them in a reasonable way.    Theologians, no doubt, have had reasons for making the soul immaterial.  They needed souls and chimeras to populate the imaginary regions which  they have discovered in the other life. Material souls would have been  subjected, like all bodies, to dissolution. Moreover, if men believe  that everything is to perish with the body, the geographers of the other  world would evidently lose the chance of guiding their souls to this  unknown abode. They would draw no profits from the hopes with which they  feast them, and from the terrors with which they take care to overwhelm  them. If the future is of no real utility to the human race, it is at  least of the greatest advantage to those who take upon themselves the  responsibility of conducting mankind thither.          CVIII.--IT IS FALSE THAT THE DOGMA OF ANOTHER LIFE CAN BE CONSOLING; AND  IF IT WERE, IT WOULD BE NO PROOF THAT THIS ASSERTION IS TRUE.    But, it will be said, is not the dogma of the immortality of the soul  consoling for beings who often find themselves very unhappy here below?  If this should be an illusion, is it not a sweet and agreeable one? Is  it not a benefit for man to believe that he can live again and enjoy,  sometime, the happiness which is refused to him on earth? Thus, poor  mortals! you make your wishes the measure of the truth! Because you  desire to live forever, and to be"]]]
