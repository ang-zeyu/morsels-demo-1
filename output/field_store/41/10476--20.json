He was looking at it when he saw something which made him drop the  fish on the deck.    Out of the forecastle door thick clouds of black mist were rolling,  exactly as if the hold of the ship were on fire. For a meddlesome pirate  had found the leather bag of storm-wind and had opened it, mistaking it  for a bag of wine.    The strange clouds, swirling round the deck, grew instant by instant  darker and denser. Soon the tops of the masts could no longer be  distinguished. The sun took on a horrible copper hue, and the sea became  a mottled black and green. A howling wind arose.    A moment later, with the violence of an explosion, the storm burst.  Mountain-high rose the glassy white-capped waves. The lightning fell in  violet cataracts, and thunder roared and tumbled through the caverns of  the sky. An ocean of hissing rain fell into the waters.    Suddenly the pirate chief, as he staggered down the stairs, shouted, \"We  are lost!\"    Just astern, an enormous, glassy wave, higher than the masts of the  ship, was about to break. The pirates yelled, but little good their  yelling did them. An instant later the wave broke upon the deck, and  crashing tons of green water swept every single pirate into the sea.  Slowly, and with the tense struggle of a wounded animal, the good ship  lifted itself from the waves.    The Princess was the only human being left on board. Only the cords  which bound her to the mast had saved her from being swept away.    Now, when the water swept the deck, the silver fish which lay at the  Princess's feet became alive and darted over the rail into the sea.    The storm continued. The helpless Princess expected every minute to sink  with the ship into the roaring waters. Suddenly, to her horror, a high  rocky island appeared a few miles ahead. Toward this island, over whose  cruel reefs the ocean was foaming and breaking, the ship was drifting  fast. Tied to the mast, the Princess listened to the terrible cry of the  breakers, and, spell-bound, watched the jagged rocks of the island ever  drawing nearer.    Now while the Princess was in this terrible situation, the Master  Mariner, who had been blown before the storm like a feather, also came  in sight of the rocky island. The instant he caught sight of the shore,  and heard the roaring of the breakers, he knew that he could not hope to  reach the land. He was on the edge of the reefs when the King of the  Caves of the Sea, who had been summoned by the silver fish, rose out of  the water beside him, and taking him in his webbed hands, swam with him  to a place of safety. Just as they reached the shallows, the mists of  the tempest parted, and driving through the darkness and the storm,  headed for the reefs, came the Master Mariner's ship with the Princess  tied to the mast.    \"Oh, save her! Save the Princess!\" cried the Master Mariner.    The King of the Caves of the Sea stretched out his hands over the island  and uttered a strange and mysterious word. So awful was its power that  the rocky cliffs split open, forming a safe and sheltered harbor. Into  this port came the ship, safe at last as a bird in its nest.    So the Master Mariner, the Princess, and the ship were all wonderfully  preserved, and when the storm was over, the King of the Caves saw them  home to Silk Land. There the Master Mariner found his crew waiting for  him, and in a few days they had rigged new sails for the ship which were  even whiter than the old. The inhabitants got back the fifty-three scarf  pins, the hundred and eighty-five sterling silver berry-spoons, the  thousand clocks, and the rest of the booty which the pirates had stowed  away in the Master Mariner's ship.    Great was the rejoicing.    Greater still was the joy, however, when the Master Mariner married the  Princess.             THE MARVELOUS DOG AND THE WONDERFUL CAT    [Illustration: Background, books scattered on library shelves.  Foreground, a white dog with glasses and a black cat seated at a low  table, studying books and making notes.]      Once upon a time there was an old enchanter who taught magic and  enchantment to the younger fairies. Year after year, and morning after  morning, he was to be found at his school-room in the Fairies' College,  standing between his desk and a blackboard, now writing down the spell  for turning noses into turnips, now changing sunflower seeds into pearls  before the very eyes of his pupils.    The old enchanter liked this life of quiet and study, and doubtless  would have been teaching in Fairyland to this very day, had he not been  so unfortunate as to quarrel with the terrible sorcerer Zidoc, who was  then Lord High Chancellor of the Fairies' College. I have forgotten  exactly what the quarrel was about, but I think that it had to do with  the best spell for causing castles to fall to pieces in an instant. At  any rate, Zidoc, who considered himself quite the most wonderful  enchanter in Fairyland, was furious at being opposed, and told the old  enchanter, very angrily, that he was not to have his classes any more  and must leave the college at once. So the poor old gentleman packed up  his magic books, put his enchanter's wand into its silver case, and went  to the country one pleasant day in search of a house.    Thanks to the advice of a friendly chimney swift, it did not take him  long to find one. The dwelling was the property of the Fairy Jocapa. It  stood just off the high road, close by a lane of great oaks whose shiny,  fringed leaves glistened in the hot noon-day sun; it had a high roof  with sides steep as mountain slopes, and one great chimney; and its  second story thrust itself out over the first in the old-fashioned way.  Green fields, little hills, and pleasant meadows in which red and white  cows were grazing lay behind the dwelling.    Seeing the front door wide open, the enchanter walked in. It was very  quiet. Only the far away klingle-klangle of a cow-bell could be heard.    \"Here shall I live,\" said the enchanter. And he brought his possessions  to the house.    Now, one autumnal morning, when a blue haze hung over the lonely fields  from which the reapers had departed, and the golden leaves were wet  underfoot, the old enchanter went for a walk down the lane, and finding  the day agreeable, kept on until he found himself in the woods. Arriving  at the crest of a little hill in the woodland, he saw below him, almost  at the foot of the slope, a countryman with a white puppy and a black  kitten following at his heels. The little dog barked merrily out of pure  high spirits, whilst the kitten leaped and struck with its tiny paws at  the passing white butterflies.    As the old enchanter approached the countryman, he happened to hear him  say to the animals,--    \"Alas, my poor innocents, what a pity that I should have to abandon  you!\"    \"What's that?\" said the enchanter, halting the countryman. \"You intend  to abandon these helpless creatures?\"    \"Alas, I must,\" replied the countryman, pulling a large blue bandanna  handkerchief from his pocket and applying it to the corners of his eyes.  \"We are too poor to be able to feed them, and my children love them so  well that I cannot find it in my heart to do them harm. I am taking them  into these woods to abandon them, in the hope that, like the wild  animals, they will soon learn to shift for themselves.\"    \"Give them to me,\" said the old enchanter, \"I will bring them up.\" The  countryman nodded his head. \"As for you, here is a golden florin. May it  bring you better fortune.\"    Thus did the white puppy and black kitten change hands.    Once he had led the animals safely home, the enchanter resolved to make  them the most wonderful animals that had ever been seen in the whole  wide world, whether in Fairyland or out of it. Being an enchanter, he  could, of course, do this more easily than other people. So he taught  the cat and the dog all the known languages, then history, arithmetic,  dancing, social deportment, and a variety of the best magic and spells.  The cat, as was to be expected, was particularly good on anything that  had 'cat' in it; he once catalogued all the principal catastrophes;  while the dog, although a good student, had a fancy for writing  doggerel. Many and many a time, when the enchanter and his wonderful  animals were seated in their armchairs round a blazing fire, talking  exactly as any three good friends might talk, a nose would flatten  itself against the panes, and the three companions would see looking in  at them some stranger whose curiosity had got the better of his manners.    The dog, I may say, had grown up to be a fine fellow of the  short-haired, white bull terrier family; the cat had grown to be as  aristocratic as a panther. When their education was complete, the  animals came to their teacher and begged him to let them go away and see  the world. For a long time the enchanter, who loved his charges very  much indeed, resisted their request; but as they continued to press him,  he came at length to yield. Calling them before him, he said to them:--    \"Well, dear pupils, if you must go, you must go. I owe the Fairy Jocapa  twelve months rent for this house. She is now living with her nephew,  the King of the Land of the Runaway Rivers. You shall take twelve golden  florins to her. Your route will take you over all the kingdoms of the  whole wide world.\"    So the white dog, who was the stronger of the two, took the purse with  the twelve golden coins, and put it in a large wallet which he wore at  his side, and then both the wonderful animals said good-bye. At the  corner of the lane they turned again to look for the last time at their  dwelling, and saw their old master still waving at them from the little  window over the door. Then they fared over the hills and far away.    So wise, so well-bred and good-tempered were these wonderful animals,  that their journey across the world was a great "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19209"],[0,"The Andes and the Amazon; Or, Across the Continent of South America (#17)"],[1,"since submerged near Behring's Straits, from Siberia  into North America, and thence, on land since submerged in the West  Indies, into South America, where for a time they mingled with the forms  characteristic of that southern continent, and have since become  extinct.\"[42] The rise of the Mexican table-land split up the New World  into two well-defined zoological provinces. A few species, as the puma,  peccari, and opossum, have crossed the barrier; but South America is  characterized by possessing a family of monkeys, the llama, tapir, many  peculiar rodents, and several genera of edentates.    [Footnote 42: _Journal of Researches_, p. 132.]    The tapir, the largest native quadruped, is sometimes found on the  mountains, but never descends into the Quito Valley. A link between the  elephant and hog, its true home is in the lowlands. The tapir and  peccari (also found on the Andean slopes) are the only indigenous  pachyderms in South America, while the llama[43] and deer (both  abounding in the valley) are the only native ruminants; there is not one  native hollow-horned ruminant on the continent. The llama is the only  native domesticated animal; indeed, South America never furnished any  other animal serviceable to man: the horse, ox, hog, and sheep (two,  four, and six-horned), are importations. Of these animals, which  rendered such important aid in the early civilization of Asia and  Europe, the genera even were unknown in South America four centuries  ago; and to-day pure Indians with difficulty acquire a taste for beef,  mutton, and pork. The llama is still used as a beast of burden; but it  seldom carries a quintal more than twelve miles a day. The black bear of  the Andes ascends as high as Mont Blanc, and is rarely found below three  thousand five hundred feet. The puma, or maneless American lion, has an  immense range, both in latitude and altitude, being found from Oregon to  the Straits of Magellan, and nearly up to the limit of eternal snow. It  is as cowardly as the jaguar of the lowlands is ferocious. It is a very  silent animal, uttering no cry even when wounded. Its flesh, which is  very white, and remarkably like veal in taste, is eaten in Patagonia.  Squirrels, hares, bats (a small species), opossums, and a large  guinea-pig (_Cuye del Monte_), are found in the neighborhood of Quito.    [Footnote 43: The llama, or \"mountain-camel\" is a beautiful animal, with  long, slender neck and fine legs, a graceful carriage, pointed ears,  soft, restless eyes, and quivering lips. It has a gentle disposition;  but when angry it will spit, and when hurt will shed tears. We have seen  specimens entirely white; but it is generally dark brown, with patches  of white. It requires very little food and drink. Since the introduction  of horses, asses, and mules, the rearing of llamas has decreased. They  are more common in Peru. The llama, guanaco, alpaca, and vicuna were  \"the four sheep of the Incas:\" the first clothing the common people, the  second the nobles, the third the royal governors, the fourth the Incas.  The price of sheep's wool in Quito was formerly four cents a pound; it  is now twelve.]    As only about sixty species of birds are common to North and South  America, the traveler from the United States recognizes few ornithic  forms in the Valley of Quito. Save the hummers, beautiful plumage is  rare, as well as fine songsters. But the moment we descend the Eastern  Cordillera into the interior of the continent, we find the feathered  race in robes of richest colors. The exact cause of this brilliant  coloring in the tropics is still a problem. It can not be owing to  greater light and heat, for the birds of the Galapagos Islands, directly  under the equator, are dull.[44]    [Footnote 44: Mr. Gould, however, holds that the difference of  coloration is due to the different degrees of exposure to the sun's  rays, the brilliantly-colored species being inhabitants of the edges of  the forest. Birds from Ucayali, in the centre of the continent, are far  more splendid than those which represent them in countries nearer the  sea, owing to the clearer atmosphere inland. But it is a fact, at least  exceptional to this theory, that the \"Cock of the Rock\" (Rupicola) on  the western side of the Andes (Esmeraldas) is of a richer, deeper color  than the same species on the eastern slope (Napo). In keeping with Mr.  Gould's theory is the statement by Mr. Bates, that the most gaudy  butterflies (the males) flutter in the sunshine.]    The males, both of birds and butterflies, are the most gaudily dressed.  In the highlands the most prominent birds are the condor and the  humming-bird. These two extremes in size are found side by side on the  summit of Pichincha. The condor appears in its glory among the mountains  of Quito. Its ordinary haunt is at the height of Etna. No other living  creature can remove at pleasure to so great a distance from the earth;  and it seems to fly and respire as easily under the low barometric  pressure of thirteen inches as at the sea-shore. It can dart in an  instant from the dome of Chimborazo to the sultry coast of the Pacific.  It has not the kingly port of the eagle, and is a cowardly robber: a  true vulture, it prefers the relish of putrescence and the flavor of  death. It makes no nest, but lays two eggs on a jutting ledge of some  precipice, and fiercely defends them. The usual spread of wings is nine  feet. It does not live in pairs like the eagle, but feeds in flocks like  its loathsome relative, the buzzard. It is said to live forty days  without food in captivity, but at liberty it is very voracious. The  usual method of capture is to kill an old mare (better than horse, the  natives say), and allow the bird to gorge himself, when he becomes so  sluggish as to be easily lassoed. It is such a heavy sleeper, it is  possible to take it from its roost. The evidences in favor of and  against its acute smelling powers are singularly balanced. For reasons  unknown, the condor does not range north of Darien, though it extends  its empire through clouds and storms to the Straits of Magellan. In the  Inca language it was called _cuntur_, and was anciently an object of  worship. The condor, gallinazo, turkey-buzzard, and caracara eagle (says  Darwin) \"in their habits well supply the place of our carrion crows,  magpies, and ravens--a tribe of birds widely distributed over the rest  of the world, but entirely absent in South America.\" The condor appears  on the gold coins of New Granada and Chile. Of _Trochilidae_ there are  hosts. The valley swarms with these \"winged jewels\" of varied hues, from  the emerald green of Pichincha to the white of Chimborazo. They build  long, purse-like nests by weaving together fine vegetable fibres and  lichens, and thickly lining them with silk-cotton. In this delicate  cradle, suspended from a branch, the female lays two eggs, which are  hatched in about twelve days. The eggs are invariably white, with one  exception, those of a species on the Upper Amazon, which are spotted.  The young have much shorter bills than their parents. The humming-bird  is exclusively American: the nearest form in the Old World is the  nectarinia, or sunbird. Other birds most commonly seen in the valley  are: _Cyanocitta turcosa_ (Jay), _Poecilothraupis atrierissa_,  _Pheuticus chrysogaster_, _Chlorospingus superciliaris_, _Buthraupis  chloronata_, _Tanagra Darwini_, _Dubusia selysia_, _Buarremon  latinuchus_, and _B. assimilis_. The only geese in the valley are a few  imported from Europe by Senor Aguirre, of Chillo, and these refuse to  propagate.    Reptiles are so rare in the highlands the class can hardly be said to be  represented. During a residence of nearly three months in the Quito  Valley we saw but one snake.[45] Nevertheless, we find the following  sentence in such a respectable book as Bohn's Hand-book of Modern  Geography: \"The inhabitants of Quito are dreadfully tormented by  reptiles, which it is scarcely possible to keep out of the beds!\" Of  frogs there are not enough to get up a choir, and of fishes there is  but one solitary species, about a finger long.[46] The entomology of  Quito is also brief, much to the satisfaction of travelers from the  insectiferous coast. Musquitoes and bedbugs do not seem to enjoy life at  such an altitude, and jiggers[47] and flies are rare. Fleas, however,  have the hardihood to exist and bite in the summer months, and if you  attend an Indian fair you will be likely to feel something \"gently o'er  you creeping.\" But fleas and lice are the only blood-thirsty animals, so  that the great Valley of Quito is an almost painless paradise. Of  beetles and butterflies there are a few species, the latter belonging  for the most part to the familiar North American genera _Pyrameis_ and  _Colias_. At Vinces, on the coast, we found the pretty brown butterfly,  _Anartia Jatrophae_, which ranges from Texas to Brazil. A light-colored  coleopter is eaten roasted by the inhabitants. The cochineal is raised  in the southern part of the valley, particularly in Guananda, at the  foot of Tunguragua, where the small, flat-leaved cactus (_Opuntia  tuna_), on which, the insect feeds, is extensively cultivated. The male  is winged, but the female is stationary, fixed to the cactus, and is of  a dark brown color. It takes seventy thousand to make a pound, which is  sold in the valley for from sixty cents to $3. The best cochineal comes  from Teneriffe, where it was introduced from Honduras in 1835. The  silk-worm is destined to work a revolution in the finances of Ecuador;  Quito silk gained a gold medal at the Paris Exhibition. No bees are  hived in the republic; the people seem to be content with treacle. The  Italian species would undoubtedly thrive here. The bees of Ecuador, like  all the bees of the New World, are inferior to those of the Old World.  Their cells are not perfectly hexagonal, and their stings are  undeveloped. They"]]]
