The sons of Jacob refused the  invitation of the steward, and a scuffle ensued. While he  tried to force them into the banqueting hall, they tried to  force him out,[238] for they feared it was but a ruse to get  possession  of them and their asses, on account of the money  they had found in their sacks on their return from their first  journey to Egypt. In their modesty they put the loss of  their beasts upon the same level as the loss of their personal  liberty. To the average man property is as precious as life  itself.[239]    Standing at the door of Joseph's house, they spake to the  steward, and said: \"We are in badly reduced circumstances.  In our country we supported others, and now we depend  upon thee to support us.\" After these introductory words,  they offered him the money they had found in their sacks.  The steward reassured them concerning the money, saying,  \"However it may be, whether for the sake of your own  merits, or for the sake of the merits of your fathers, God  hath caused you to find a treasure, for the money ye paid for  the corn came into my hand.\" Then he brought Simon out  to them. Their brother looked like a leather bottle, so fat  and rotund had he grown during his sojourn in Egypt.[240]  He told his brethren what kind treatment had been accorded  unto him. The very moment they left the city he had been  released from prison, and thereafter he had been entertained  with splendor in the house of the ruler of Egypt.    When Joseph made his appearance, Judah took Benjamin  by the hand, and presented him to the viceroy, and they  all bowed down themselves to him to the earth.[241] Joseph  asked them concerning the welfare of their father and  their grandfather, and they made reply, \"Thy servant  our father is well; he is yet alive,\" and Joseph knew from  their words that his grandfather Isaac was no more.[242] He  had died at the time when Joseph was released from prison,  and the joy of God in the liberation of Joseph was overcast  by His sorrow for Isaac.[243] Then Judah handed his father's  letter to Joseph, who was so moved at seeing the well-known  handwriting that he had to retire to his chamber and weep.  When he came back, he summoned Benjamin to approach  close to him, and he laid his hand upon his youngest  brother's head, and blessed him with the words, \"God be  gracious unto thee, my son.\"[244] His father had once mentioned  \"the children which God hath graciously given Thy  servant,\" and as Benjamin was not among the children thus  spoken of, for he was born later, Joseph compensated him  now by blessing him with the grace of God.[245]    The table was set in three divisions, for Joseph, for his  brethren, and for the Egyptians. The sons of Jacob did not  venture to eat of the dishes set before them, they were afraid  they might not have been prepared according to the ritual  prescriptions--a punishment upon Joseph for having slandered  his brethren, whom he once charged with not being  punctilious in the observance of the dietary laws.[246] The  Egyptians, again, could not sit at the same table with the  sons of Jacob, because the latter ate the flesh of the animals  to which the former paid divine worship.[247]    When all was ready, and the guests were to be seated,  Joseph raised his cup, and, pretending to inhale his knowledge  from it, he said, \"Judah is king, therefore let him sit  at the head of the table, and let Reuben the first-born take  the second seat,\" and thus he assigned places to all his  brethren corresponding to their dignity and their age.[248]  Moreover, he seated the brothers together who were the  sons of the same mother, and when he reached Benjamin,  he said, \"I know that the youngest among you has no  brother borne by his own mother, next to whom he might be  seated, and also I have none, therefore he may take his place  next to me.\"    The brethren marvelled one with another at all this. During  the meal, Joseph took his portion, and gave it to Benjamin,  and his wife Asenath followed his example, and also  Ephraim and Manasseh, so that Benjamin had four portions  in addition to that which he had received like the other sons  of Jacob.[249]    Wine was served at the meal, and it was the first time in  twenty-two years that Joseph and his brethren tasted of it,  for they had led the life of Nazarites, his brethren because  they regretted the evil they had done to Joseph, and Joseph  because he grieved over the fate of his father.[250]    Joseph entered into conversation with his brother Benjamin.  He asked him whether he had a brother borne by his  own mother, and Benjamin answered, \"I had one, but I do  not know what hath become of him.\" Joseph continued his  questions: \"Hast thou a wife?\"    Benjamin: \"Yes, I have a wife and ten sons.\"    Joseph: \"And what are their names? \"    Benjamin: \"Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and  Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.\"    Joseph: \"Why didst thou give them such peculiar  names?\"    Benjamin: \"In memory of my brother and his sufferings:  Bela, because my brother disappeared among the  peoples; Becher, he was the first-born son of my mother;  Ashbel, he was taken away from my father; Gera, he dwells  a stranger in a strange land; Naaman, he was exceedingly  lovely; Ehi, he was my only brother by my father and my  mother together; Rosh, he was at the head of his brethren;  Muppim, he was beautiful in every respect; Huppim, he was  slandered; and Ard, because he was as beautiful as a rose.\"[251]    Joseph ordered his magic astrolabe to be brought to  him, whereby he knew all things that happen, and he said  unto Benjamin, \"I have heard that the Hebrews are acquainted  with all wisdom, but dost thou know aught of  this?\" Benjamin answered, \"Thy servant also is skilled  in all wisdom, which my father hath taught me.\" He then  looked upon the astrolabe, and to his great astonishment he  discovered by the aid of it that he who was sitting upon the  throne before him was his brother Joseph. Noticing Benjamin's  amazement, Joseph asked him, \"What hast thou  seen, and why art thou astonished?\" Benjamin said, \"I  can see by this that Joseph my brother sitteth here before  me upon the throne.\" And Joseph said: \"I am Joseph thy  brother! Reveal not the thing unto our brethren. I will  send thee with them when they go away, and I will command  them to be brought back again into the city, and I will  take thee away from them. If they risk their lives and fight  for thee, then shall I know that they have repented of what  they did unto me, and I will make myself known unto them.  But if they forsake thee, I will keep thee, that thou shouldst  remain with me. They shall go away, and I will not make  myself known unto them.\"[252]    Then Joseph inquired of Benjamin what his brethren had  told their father after they had sold him into slavery, and  he heard the story of the coat dipped in the blood of a kid  of the goats. \"Yes, brother,\" spoke Joseph, \"when they  had stripped me of my coat, they handed me over to the  Ishmaelites,  who tied an apron around my waist, scourged me,  and bade me run off. But a lion attacked the one that beat  me, and killed him, and his companions were alarmed, and  they sold me to other people.\"[253]    Dismissed by Joseph with kind words, his brethren started  on their homeward journey as soon as the morning was  light, for it is a good rule to \"leave a city after sunrise, and  enter a city before sundown.\"[254] Besides, Joseph had a specific  reason for not letting his brethren depart from the city  during the night. He feared an encounter between them and  his servants, and that his men might get the worst of it, for  the sons of Jacob were like the wild beasts, which have the  upper hand at night.      THE THIEF CAUGHT    They were not yet far beyond the city gates, when Joseph  dispatched Manasseh, the steward of his house, to follow  after them, and look for the silver cup that he had concealed  in Benjamin's sack. He knew his brethren well, he  did not venture to let them get too far from the city before  he should attempt to force their return. He hoped that the  nearness of the city would intimidate them and make them  heed his commands. Manasseh therefore received the order  to bring them to a halt, by mild speech if he could, or by  rough speech if he must, and carry them back to the city.[255]  He acted according to his instructions. When the brethren  heard the accusation of theft , they said: \"With whomsoever  of thy servants the cup be found, let him die, and we  also will be my lord's bondmen.\" And Manasseh said, \"As  you say, so were it proper to do, for if ten persons are  charged with theft, and the stolen object is found with one  of them, all are held responsible. But I will not be so hard.  He with whom the cup is found shall be the bondman, and  the rest shall be blameless.\"    He searched all the sacks, and in order not to excite the  suspicion that he knew where the cup was, he began at Reuben,  the eldest, and left off at Benjamin, the youngest, and  the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. In a rage, his  brethren shouted at Benjamin, \"O thou thief and son of a  thief! Thy mother brought shame upon our father by her  thievery, and now thou bringest shame upon us.\" But he  replied, \"Is this matter as evil as the matter of the kid of  the goats--as the deed of the brethren that sold their own  brother into slavery?\"[256]    In their fury and vexation, the brethren rent their clothes.  God paid them in their own coin. They had caused Jacob  to tear his clothes in his grief over Joseph, and now they  were made to do the same on account of their own troubles.

COSS                                          I    1     Of this poem lines 1-8, 81-84, 97-100, were included in the Roman       Breviary as a hymn to be sung at Lauds, on Tuesday.    2     The allusions to the cock in this and the following poem (ii. 37-55)       were doubtless inspired by the lines of Ambrose in his morning hymn       beginning _Aeterne rerum conditor_. Cf. ll. 5-8 and 16-24:              _\"praeco diei iam sonat            noctis profundae pervigil,            nocturna lux viantibus            a nocte noctem segregans._                *       *       *       *       *              _surgamus ergo strenue:            gallus iacentes excitat,            et somnolentos increpat:            gallus negantes arguit._              _gallo canente spes redit,            aegris salus refunditur,            mucro latronis conditur,            lapsis fides revertitur.\"_                              _Translation._              \"Dawn's herald now begins to cry,            Lone watcher of the nightly sky:            Light of the dark to pilgrims dear,            Speeding successive midnights drear.                *       *       *       *       *              Brisk from our couch let us arise!            Hark to the cock's arousing cries!            He chides the sluggard's slumbrous ease,            And shames his unconvincing pleas.              At cock-crow Hope revives again,            Health banishes the stress of pain,            Sheathed is the nightly robber's sword,            And Faith to fallen hearts restored.\"         See also Ambrose, _Hexaem._, v. 24, for an eloquent passage in       the same strain. The cock was the familiar Christian symbol of early       rising or vigilance, and numerous representations of it are found in       the Catacombs. Cf. the painting from the Catacomb of St. Priscilla       reproduced in Bottari's folio of 1754, where the Good Shepherd is       depicted as feeding the lambs, with a crowing cock on His right and       left hand. It is also a symbol of the Resurrection, our Lord being       supposed to have risen from the grave at the early cockcrowing: see       l. 65 _et seq._ In l. 16 the first bird-notes are interpreted       by the poet as a summons to the general judgment. Cf. Mark xiii. 35:       \"Ye know not when the lord of the house cometh, whether at even, or       at midnight, or _at cockcrowing_, or in the morning.\" This       passage serves as a kind of text for Prudentius' first two hymns,       and perhaps explains why he has one for cockcrowing and another for       morning.    26     A common idea in all literatures. Cf. Virg., _Aen._, vi. 278       (taken from Homer), _tum consanguineus Leti Sopor_, and Tennyson's       \"Sleep, Death's twin-brother\" (_In Memoriam_, 68).    44     Cf. Augustine, _Serm._ 103: \"These evil spirits seek to seduce       the soul: but when the sun has arisen, they take to flight.\"    59     The denial of Peter forms a subject of Christian casuistry in       patristic literature, and this passage recalls the famous classical       parallel in Euripides (_Hipp._ 612), \"the tongue hath sworn: yet       unsworn is the heart.\" Cf. Augustine, _cont. mendacium_: \"In that       denial he held fast the truth in his heart, while with his lips he       uttered falsehood.\" For a striking representation of Peter and the       cock, on a sarcophagus discovered in the Catacombs and now deposited       in the Vatican library, see Maitland's _Church in the Catacombs_,       p. 347. The closing words of the passage in Ambrose's _Hexaemeron_,       already referred to under l. 2, may here be quoted: \"As the cock       peals forth his notes, the robber leaves his plots: Lucifer himself       awakes and lights up the sky: the distressful sailor lays aside his       gloom, and all the storms and tempests that have risen in fury under       the winds of the evening begin to die down: the soul of the saint       leaps to prayer and renews the study of the written word: and       finally, the very Rock of the Church is cleansed of the stain he had       contracted by his denials before the cock crew.\"    81 ff.     The best commentary on these words is to be found in the       following passage from the second epistle of Basil to Gregory       Nazianzen: \"What can be more blessed than to imitate on earth the       angelic host by giving oneself at the peep of dawn to prayer and by       turning at sunrise to work with hymns and songs: yea, all the day       through to make prayer the accompaniment of our toils and to season       them with praise as with salt? For the solace of hymns changes the       soul's sadness into mirth.\"                                         II    1    This poem furnishes two hymns to the Roman Breviary, one to be sung       on Wednesday at Lauds, and consisting of ll. 1-8, 48-53 (omitting l.       50), 57, 59, 60, 67 (_tu vera lux caelestium_) and 68: the other       for Thursday at Lauds, consisting of ll. 25 (_lux ecce surgit       aurea_), 93-108.    17     Cf. Ambrose, ii. 8, _de Cain et Abel_: \"The thief shuns the day       as the witness of his crime: the adulterer is abashed by the dawn       as the accomplice of his adultery.\"    51     The practice of praying on bended knees is frequently referred to       in early Christian writers. Cf. Clem., 1 Ad. Cor. cc. xlviii.: \"Let       us fall down before the Lord,\" and Shepherd of Hermas, vis. 1. i.:       \"After I had crossed that river I came unto the banks and there       knelt down and began to pray.\" Dressel quotes from Juvencus (iv.       648), a Spanish poet and Christian contemporary of Prudentius,       _genibus nixi regem dominumque salutant_, \"on bended knees they       make obeisance unto their King and Lord.\"    63     The Jordan is a poetical figure for baptism, suggested doubtless  by the baptism of our Lord in that river. Cf. vii. 73-75.    67     Cf. Milton, _Paradise Regained_, i. 293: \"So spake our Morning       Star, then in his rise.\" The figure is suggested by Rev. xxii. 16:       \"I am ... the bright, the morning star.\"    105     The conception of God as _speculator_ may be paralleled by a       passage in the epistle of Polycarp _ad Philipp._ iv., where God is       described as the Arch-critic (_panta momoschopeitai_) and subsequently       (vii.) as _ton pantepopten theon_, \"the All-witnessing God.\" The       last verse contains a distinct echo of the closing words of the       fourth chapter of Polycarp: \"None of the reasonings or thoughts,       nor any of the hidden things of the heart escape His notice.\"                                         III    2     _Word-begot._ The original _verbigena_, on the analogy of such       words (cf. _terrigena_, _Martigena_, etc.), can only mean \"begotten       of the Word.\" It is evident, therefore, the \"Word\" in this connection       is not the Johannine Logos or Second Person in the Trinity.       Prudentius cannot be guilty of the error which he expressly       condemns (_Apoth._ 249) as _perquam ridiculum_ and regard the       Logos as begetting Himself. Consequently, both in this passage and       in xi. 18 (_verbo editus_) the \"Word\" must be taken as approximating       rather to the Alexandrian conception of the Logos as the Divine       Reason. In this way Christ is expressly described as the offspring       of the _Intellectus Dei_, the immanent Intelligence of the Deity.       If this conception is considered to be beyond Prudentius, we can only       suppose that both here and in xi. 18, his language is theologically       loose. Some excuse may be offered for this on the ground that the       Latin language is ill-adapted for expressing metaphysical truths.       The late Bishop Westcott remarked on the inadequacy of the Latin       original of \"the Word was made flesh\" (_verbum caro factum est_),       both substantive and verb falling short of the richness of their       Greek equivalents. (_Vid._ also note on iv. 15.)    11     Cf. Ambrose, _Hymn_ vii.:--              _\"Christusque nobis sit cibus            Potusque noster sit fides;            Laeti bibamus sobriam            Ebrietatem Spiritus.\"_                             _Translation._              \"May Christ be now the Bread we eat,            Be simple Faith our potion sweet:            Let our intoxication be            The Spirit's calm sobriety.\"         The idea is familiar to readers of Herbert and Herrick, though it       is elaborated by them with quaint conceits somewhat foreign to the       Latin poet. Cf. Herbert, _The Banquet_:--              \"O what sweetnesse from the bowl                          Fills my soul!                *       *       *       *       *              Is some starre (fled from the sphere)                          Melted there,            As we sugar melt in wine?                *       *       *       *       *              Doubtless neither starre nor flower                          Hath the power            Such a sweetnesse to impart:            Only God, Who gives perfumes,                          Flesh assumes,            And with it perfumed my heart.\"         Also Herrick, _A Thanksgiving to God_:--              \"Lord, I confess too, when I dine,                          The pulse is thine.                *       *       *       *       *              'Tis thou that crown'st my glittering hearth                          With guiltless mirth,            And giv'st me wassail bowls to drink,                          Spiced to the brink.\"    28     The original _dactylico_ refers to the metre of the Latin of this       poem. For a rendering of ll. 1-65 in the metre of the original see       Glover, _Life and Letters in the Fourth Century_, pp. 267-269.    58     This and the following lines should satisfy the most ardent "]]]
