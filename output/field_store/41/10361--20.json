He was well educated and had a touch of the artist's  temperament, loving fair churches, beautiful sculpture, delicate  goldsmith's work, and richly illuminated books. He had a horror of  violence, and never wept more bitter tears than when he learned how  treacherously his name had been used to lure Richard Marshal to his  doom. But he was extraordinarily deficient in stability of purpose. For  the moment it was easy to influence him either for good or evil, but  even the ablest of his counsellors found it impossible to retain any  hold over him for long. One day he lavished all his affection on Hubert  de Burgh; the next he played into the hands of his enemies. In the same  way he got rid of Peter des Roches, the preceptor of his infancy, the  guide of his early manhood. Jealous, self-assertive, restless, and  timid, he failed in just those qualities that his subjects expected to  find in a king. Born and brought up in England, and never leaving it  save for short and infrequent visits to the continent, he was proud of  his English ancestors and devoted to English saints, more especially to  royal saints such as Edward the Confessor and Edmund of East Anglia.  Yet he showed less sympathy with English ways than many of his  foreign-born predecessors. Educated under alien influences, delighting  in the art, the refinement, the devotion, and the absolutist principles  of foreigners, he seldom trusted a man of English birth. Too weak to  act for himself, too suspicious to trust his natural counsellors, he  found the friendship and advice for which he yearned in foreign  favourites and kinsmen. Thus it was that the hopes excited by the fall  of the Poitevins were disappointed. The alien invasion, checked for a  few years, was renewed in a more dangerous shape.    During the ten years after the collapse of Peter des Roches, swarms of  foreigners came to England, and spoiled the land with the king's entire  good-will. Henry's marriage brought many Provencals and Savoyards to  England. The renewed troubles between pope and emperor led to a renewal  of Roman interference in a more exacting form. The continued  intercourse with foreign states resulted in fresh opportunities of  alien influence. A new attempt on Poitou brought as its only result the  importation of the king's Poitevin kinsmen. The continued close  relationship between the English and the French baronage involved the  frequent claim of English estates and titles by men of alien birth.  Even such beneficial movements as the establishment of the mendicant  orders in England, and the cosmopolitan outlook of the increasingly  important academic class contributed to the spread of outlandish ideas.  As wave after wave of foreigners swept over England, Englishmen  involved them in a common condemnation. And all saw in the weakness of  the king the very source of their power.    The first great influx of foreigners followed directly from Henry's  marriage. For several years active negotiations had been going on to  secure him a suitable bride. There had also at various times been talk  of his selecting a wife from Brittany, Austria, Bohemia, or Scotland,  and in the spring of 1235 a serious negotiation for his marriage with  Joan, daughter and heiress of the Count of Ponthieu, only broke down  through the opposition of the French court. Henry then sought the hand  of Eleanor, a girl twelve years old, and the second of the four  daughters of Raymond Berengar IV., Count of Provence, and his wife  Beatrice, sister of Amadeus III., Count of Savoy. The marriage contract  was signed in October. Before that time Eleanor had left Provence under  the escort of her mother's brother, William, bishop-elect of Valence.  On her way she spent a long period with her elder sister Margaret, who  had been married to Louis IX. of France in 1234. On January 14, 1236,  she was married to Henry at Canterbury by Archbishop Edmund, and  crowned at Westminster on the following Sunday.    The new queen's kinsfolk quickly acquired an almost unbounded  ascendency over her weak husband. With the exception of the reigning  Count Amadeus of Savoy, her eight maternal uncles were somewhat  scantily provided for. The prudence of the French government prevented  them from obtaining any advantage for themselves at the court of their  niece the Queen of France, and they gladly welcomed the opportunity of  establishing themselves at the expense of their English nephew.  Self-seeking and not over-scrupulous, able, energetic, and with the  vigour and resource of high-born soldiers of fortune, several of them  play honourable parts in the history of their own land, and are by no  means deserving of the complete condemnation meted out to them by the  English annalists.[1] The bishop-elect of Valence was an able and  accomplished warrior. He stayed on in England after accomplishing his  mission, and with him remained his clerk, the younger son of a house of  Alpine barons, Peter of Aigueblanche, whose cunning and dexterity were  as attractive to Henry as the more martial qualities of his master.  Weary of standing alone, the king eagerly welcomed a trustworthy  adviser who was outside the entanglements of English parties, and made  Bishop William his chief counsellor. It was believed that he was  associated with eleven others in a secret inner circle of royal  advisers, whose advice Henry pledged himself by oath to follow. Honours  and estates soon began to fall thickly on William and his friends. He  made himself the mouthpiece of Henry's foreign policy. When he  temporarily left England, he led a force sent by the king to help  Frederick II. in his war against the cities of northern Italy. His  influence with Henry did much to secure for his brother, Thomas of  Savoy, the hand of the elderly countess Joan of Flanders. With Thomas  as the successor of Ferdinand of Portugal, the rich Flemish county,  bound to England by so many political and economic ties, seemed in safe  hands, and preserved from French influence. In 1238 Thomas visited  England, and received a warm welcome and rich presents from the king.        [1] For Eleanor's countrymen see Mugnier, _Les Savoyards en      Angleterre au XIIIe siecle, et Pierre d'Aigueblanche, eveque      d'Hereford_ (1890).    Despite the establishment of the Savoyards, the Poitevin influence began  to revive. Peter des Roches, who had occupied himself after his fall by  fighting for Gregory IX. against the revolted Romans, returned to  England in broken health in 1236, and was reconciled to the king. Peter  of Rivaux was restored to favour, and made keeper of the royal wardrobe.  Segrave and Passelewe again became justices and ministers. England was  now the hunting-ground of any well-born Frenchmen anxious for a wider  career than they could obtain at home.[1] Among the foreigners attracted  to England to prosecute legal claims or to seek the royal bounty came  Simon of Montfort, the second son of the famous conqueror of the  Albigenses. Amice, the mother of the elder Simon, was the sister and  heiress of Robert of Beaumont, the last of his line to hold the earldom  of Leicester. After Amice's death her son used the title and claimed the  estates of that earldom. But these pretensions were but nominal, and  since 1215 Randolph of Chester had administered the Leicester lands as  if his complete property. However, Amaury of Montfort, the Count of  Toulouse's eldest son, ceded to his portionless younger brother his  claims to the Beaumont inheritance, and in 1230 Simon went to England to  push his fortunes. Young, brilliant, ambitious and attractive, he not  only easily won the favour of the king, but commended himself so well to  Earl Randolph that in 1231 the aged earl was induced to relax his grasp  on the Leicester estates. In 1239 the last formalities of investiture  were accomplished. Amaury renounced his claims, and after that Simon  became Earl of Leicester and steward of England. A year before that he  had secured the great marriage that he had long been seeking. In  January, 1238, he was wedded to the king's own sister, Eleanor, the  childless widow of the younger William Marshal. Simon was for the moment  high in the affection of his brother-in-law. To the English he was  simply another of the foreign favourites who turned the king's heart  against his born subjects.        [1] This is well illustrated by Philip de Beaumanoir's      well-known romance, _Jean de Dammartin et Blonde d'Oxford_ (ed.      by Suchier, Soc. des anciens Textes francais, and by Le Roux de      Lincy, Camden Soc.).    In 1238 Peter des Roches died. With all his faults the Poitevin was an  excellent administrator at Winchester,[1] and left his estates in  such a prosperous condition that Henry coveted the succession for the  bishop-elect of Valence, though William already had the prospect of the  prince-bishopric of liege. But the monks of St. Swithun's refused to  obey the royal order, and Henry sought to obtain his object from the  pope. Gregory gave William both Liege and Winchester, but in 1239 death  ended his restless plans. William's death left more room for his  kinsfolk and followers. His clerk, Peter of Aigueblanche, returned to  the land of promise, and in 1240 secured his consecration as Bishop of  Hereford. William's brother, Peter of Savoy, lord of Romont and  Faucigny, was invited to England in the same year. In 1241 he was  invested with the earldom of Richmond, which a final breach with Peter  of Brittany had left in the king's hands. Peter, the ablest member of  his house, thus became its chief representative in England.[2]        [1] See H. Hall, _Pipe Roll of the Bishop of Winchester_,      1207-8.        [2] For Peter see Wurstemberger, _Peter II., Graf von Savoyen_      (1856).    With the Provencals and Savoyards came a fresh swarm of Romans. In 1237  the first papal legates _a latere_ since the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16702"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol. 1, January 9, 1915 (#17)"],[1,"intenance, even here, of a  competent and efficient naval and military force?\" I asked.    Mr. Carnegie shook his head emphatically.    \"That is the old, old argument cropping up again,\" said he, \"the  argument that a provocative is a preventive. For us to maintain a great  army for the purpose of preventing war thereby would be as sensible as  for each of us to be afraid to walk about except with a lightning rod  down his back, since men have been struck by lightning. No nation wants  to fight us. We have friends throughout the world.    \"Millions now resident in military nations are hoping that some day they  may be able to become citizens of our beloved republic, principally  because it now is not, nor is it every likely to be, military. Humanity  loves peace. Here peace abides, and, if we follow reason, will remain  unbroken.    \"Note the advantages of our own position. Imagine what the task would be  of landing seventy thousand hostile soldiers on our shores! First they  would need to cross three thousand miles of the Atlantic or five  thousand miles of the Pacific.    \"And what if they should come? My plan of operation would be to bid them  welcome as our visitors, considering them as men, not soldiers; to take  them to our great interior, say, as far west as Chicago, and there to  say to them:    \"'Here we shall leave you. Make yourselves at home, if that thought  pleases you; fight us if it does not. If you think you can conquer us,  try it.'    \"They would make themselves at home and, learning the advantages of  staying with us, would become applicants for our citizenship, rather  than our opponents in warfare.    \"And if they tried to fight us, what would happen to them? Our nation is  unique in an important respect. Its individuals are the best armed in  the world. Not only, for example, are its farmers armed, but they can  shoot, which is far more than can be said of those of Britain or of any  other nation.    \"The Governments of Europe cannot afford to give their citizenry arms,  and, as for the European citizenry, it not only cannot afford to  purchase arms, but cannot afford even to pay the license fees which  Government demands of those possessing arms with the right to use them.    \"But ours? Most Americans can afford to and do own guns with which to  shoot, and, furthermore, most Americans, when they shoot, can hit the  things at which they shoot.    \"Combine this powerful protective influence with the fact that thousands  of any army coming to invade us would not want to fight when once they  got here, but would want to settle here and enjoy peace, and we find  that we thus are protected as no nation in the world ever has been  protected or can be.    \"Imagine the effect upon the European fighting man's psychology if he  found that an army transport had conveyed him to a land where one man's  privilege is every man's right! Learning this, it is not a joke to say,  but is a statement of the probable fact, that the invading soldiery  would not want to fire its first volleys, but would want to file its  first papers. They would not ask for cartridges, but for citizenship.    \"America is protected by a force incomparable, which I may call its  peaceful militia, and the man who, above all other men, I most should  wish to see appointed to its command would be Gen. Leonard Wood were it  not for the fact that there would be some danger that in such an  eventuation his professional training would carry him beyond the rule of  reason.    \"That is likely to be the most serious trouble with the trained soldier.  The doctor wants to dose, the parson to preach, and the soldier to  fight. Professional habit may make any of us dangerous.    \"But if it came to fighting I do not consider it within the bounds of  possibility that we could lose. I once asked Gen. Sherman how the troops  which he commanded during the civil war compared for efficiency with  European troops. His answer was:    \"'The world never has seen the army that I would be afraid to trust my  boys with, man for man.'\"      Would Surprise the Enemy.    \"That thought of welcoming an invading army appeals strongly to me. The  hostile General would be amazed by the ease with which he got his forces  in, but he would be more startled by the difficulty he would find if he  tried to get them out. If they once learned the advantages of our  liberties they would find it hard not to get away, but to go away. I  restrain my temper with difficulty when I contemplate the foolishness of  the people who discuss with gravity the possibility of a successful  invasion of these United States by a foreign foe. The thought always  arises when I hear these cries from our army and naval officers for a  greater armament: 'Are these men cowards?' I don't believe it. It is  their profession which makes them alarmists.    \"Not only are the physical difficulties which would hamper an invasion  practically insuperable, but the reception enemies would get, if any of  them landed, would be wholly without parallel in the world's history.    \"If our liberties really were threatened, every man, and very nearly  every woman, in our vast population would rise to their defense as never  any people yet has risen to any national defense. Americans, young and  old, en masse, would sweep to the protection of what they know, and what  the world knows, would be the cause of right and human liberty.    \"I, myself, should wish to be invited to advance and meet invading  forces if they came. I would approach them without any weapons on my  person. I would not shoot at them. I would make a speech to them.    \"'Gentlemen,' I would say, 'here's the chance of your life to win life's  chief prize. Now you are peasant soldiers. You have the opportunity to  become citizen kings. We are all kings here. Here the least of you can  take a rank much higher than that of any General in your army. He can  become a sovereign in a republic.'    \"I think they would hurrah for me, not harm me, after they had heard my  speech.    \"Striving for peace, we shall become so powerful that if war comes we  shall be invincible. Peace, not war, makes riches; the rich nation is  the powerful nation.    \"Perhaps I was as much a peace man in my youth as I am now, but when I  was asked, during the civil war, to organize a corps of telegraph  operators and railroad conductors and engineers and take them to  Washington, I considered it the greatest of all privileges to obey the  order.    \"I was the last man to get on the last train leaving Burkes Station,  after Bull Run, and, now, if the country ever should be invaded, I would  be, I hope, one of the first to rush to meet the enemy--but I think my  haste would be to convert, not to kill, him.    \"The man who has done well in business, however, learns to abhor all  waste, and I must admit that it does pain me to see hundreds of millions  of our dollars spent on battleships which will but rust away, and  thousands of our able men vegetating on them or in an army.    \"The men who urge this vast waste of our money and men mean well, no  doubt, but they do not know the nation of which they have the good  fortune to be citizens--they do not realize how very potent a force we  have become in the wide world, nor the fact that one of the great  reasons why we have become a force lies in the circumstance that our  national development has not been hampered by the vast expense of  militarism.\"    Mr. Carnegie paused.    Some weeks ago, in an interview granted me for publication in THE NEW  YORK TIMES, Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, President of Columbia  University, predicted that the present war would find its final outcome  in the establishment of the United States of Europe. I asked Mr.  Carnegie to express his view upon this subject.    \"Nothing else could occur which would be of such immense advantage to  Europe,\" he replied.    \"United we stand, and divided they fall. If the territory now occupied  by the homogeneous and co-operative federation known as the United  States of America were occupied instead by a large number of small,  independent competitive nations, that is, if each section of our  territory which now is a State were an independent country, America  would be constantly in turmoil.    \"Europe has been set back a century because she substituted the present  war of nations for the promotion of a federation plan. The latter would  have meant peace and prosperity, the former means ruin.    \"If in Europe this year such a federation as Dr. Butler regards as a  future probability had been a present actuality, 1914 would have left a  record very different from that which it is making.    \"For instance, it would have been as difficult for the State of Germany  to fight the State of Russia, or the State of France, or that of  England, or all of them, and to trample neutral Belgium, as it now  would be, here, for the State of Pennsylvania to declare war on the  States of New York and Connecticut and to wreck New Jersey as she sent  her troops to the invasion.    \"Originally we had thirteen States, and thirteen only, but there was  other territory here, and the attractive force of the successful union  of the thirteen States brought the other territory in as it was  organized.    \"Thus we started right. Europe had begun before men had become so wise,  and, having begun wrong, has found herself, through the centuries,  unable to correct old errors.\"      A Federation of Europe.    \"Certainly I hope that out of the great crime of this vast war some good  will come. The greatest good which could come would be a general  European federation. I do not believe that this will come at once; but  the world will be infinitely the better if it comes at length--if the  natural law of mutual attraction for mutual advantage draws these  nations now at war into a union which shall make such wars impossible in  future, as wars between our States, here, are impossible.    \"But before"]]]
