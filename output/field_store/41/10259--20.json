For  if the will be lacking, no attempt at all is made to do what is not  willed; whereas if there be no power, the will is all in vain. And so,  if thou seest any man wishing to attain some end, yet utterly failing to  attain it, thou canst not doubt that he lacked the power of getting what  he wished for.'    'Why, certainly not; there is no denying it.'    'Canst thou, then, doubt that he whom thou seest to have accomplished  what he willed had also the power to accomplish it?'    'Of course not.'    'Then, in respect of what he can accomplish a man is to be reckoned  strong, in respect of what he cannot accomplish weak?'    'Granted,' said I.    'Then, dost thou remember that, by our former reasonings, it was  concluded that the whole aim of man's will, though the means of pursuit  vary, is set intently upon happiness?'    'I do remember that this, too, was proved.'    'Dost thou also call to mind how happiness is absolute good, and  therefore that, when happiness is sought, it is good which is in all  cases the object of desire?'    'Nay, I do not so much call to mind as keep it fixed in my memory.'    'Then, all men, good and bad alike, with one indistinguishable purpose  strive to reach good?'    'Yes, that follows.'    'But it is certain that by the attainment of good men become good?'    'It is.'    'Then, do the good attain their object?'    'It seems so.'    'But if the bad were to attain the good which is _their_ object, they  could not be bad?'    'No.'    'Then, since both seek good, but while the one sort attain it, the other  attain it not, is there any doubt that the good are endued with power,  while they who are bad are weak?'    'If any doubt it, he is incapable of reflecting on the nature of things,  or the consequences involved in reasoning.'    'Again, supposing there are two things to which the same function is  prescribed in the course of nature, and one of these successfully  accomplishes the function by natural action, the other is altogether  incapable of that natural action, instead of which, in a way other than  is agreeable to its nature, it--I will not say fulfils its function, but  feigns to fulfil it: which of these two would in thy view be the  stronger?'    'I guess thy meaning, but I pray thee let me hear thee more at large.'    'Walking is man's natural motion, is it not?'    'Certainly.'    'Thou dost not doubt, I suppose, that it is natural for the feet to  discharge this function?'    'No; surely I do not.'    'Now, if one man who is able to use his feet walks, and another to whom  the natural use of his feet is wanting tries to walk on his hands,  which of the two wouldst thou rightly esteem the stronger?'    'Go on,' said I; 'no one can question but that he who has the natural  capacity has more strength than he who has it not.'    'Now, the supreme good is set up as the end alike for the bad and for  the good; but the good seek it through the natural action of the  virtues, whereas the bad try to attain this same good through all manner  of concupiscence, which is not the natural way of attaining good. Or  dost thou think otherwise?'    'Nay; rather, one further consequence is clear to me: for from my  admissions it must needs follow that the good have power, and the bad  are impotent.'    'Thou anticipatest rightly, and that as physicians reckon is a sign that  nature is set working, and is throwing off the disease. But, since I see  thee so ready at understanding, I will heap proof on proof. Look how  manifest is the extremity of vicious men's weakness; they cannot even  reach that goal to which the aim of nature leads and almost constrains  them. What if they were left without this mighty, this well-nigh  irresistible help of nature's guidance! Consider also how momentous is  the powerlessness which incapacitates the wicked. Not light or  trivial[L] are the prizes which they contend for, but which they cannot  win or hold; nay, their failure concerns the very sum and crown of  things. Poor wretches! they fail to compass even that for which they  toil day and night. Herein also the strength of the good conspicuously  appears. For just as thou wouldst judge him to be the strongest walker  whose legs could carry him to a point beyond which no further advance  was possible, so must thou needs account him strong in power who so  attains the end of his desires that nothing further to be desired lies  beyond. Whence follows the obvious conclusion that they who are wicked  are seen likewise to be wholly destitute of strength. For why do they  forsake virtue and follow vice? Is it from ignorance of what is good?  Well, what is more weak and feeble than the blindness of ignorance? Do  they know what they ought to follow, but lust drives them aside out of  the way? If it be so, they are still frail by reason of their  incontinence, for they cannot fight against vice. Or do they knowingly  and wilfully forsake the good and turn aside to vice? Why, at this rate,  they not only cease to have power, but cease to be at all. For they who  forsake the common end of all things that are, they likewise also cease  to be at all. Now, to some it may seem strange that we should assert  that the bad, who form the greater part of mankind, do not exist. But  the fact is so. I do not, indeed, deny that they who are bad are bad,  but that they _are_ in an unqualified and absolute sense I deny. Just as  we call a corpse a dead man, but cannot call it simply \"man,\" so I would  allow the vicious to be bad, but that they _are_ in an absolute sense I  cannot allow. That only _is_ which maintains its place and keeps its  nature; whatever falls away from this forsakes the existence which is  essential to its nature. \"But,\" thou wilt say, \"the bad have an  ability.\" Nor do I wish to deny it; only this ability of theirs comes  not from strength, but from impotence. For their ability is to do evil,  which would have had no efficacy at all if they could have continued in  the performance of good. So this ability of theirs proves them still  more plainly to have no power. For if, as we concluded just now, evil is  nothing, 'tis clear that the wicked can effect nothing, since they are  only able to do evil.'    ''Tis evident.'    'And that thou mayst understand what is the precise force of this power,  we determined, did we not, awhile back, that nothing has more power than  supreme good?'    'We did,' said I.    'But that same highest good cannot do evil?'    'Certainly not.'    'Is there anyone, then, who thinks that men are able to do all things?'    'None but a madman.'    'Yet they are able to do evil?'    'Ay; would they could not!'    'Since, then, he who can do only good is omnipotent, while they who can  do evil also are not omnipotent, it is manifest that they who can do  evil have less power. There is this also: we have shown that all power  is to be reckoned among things desirable, and that all desirable things  are referred to good as to a kind of consummation of their nature. But  the ability to commit crime cannot be referred to the good; therefore it  is not a thing to be desired. And yet all power is desirable; it is  clear, then, that ability to do evil is not power. From all which  considerations appeareth the power of the good, and the indubitable  weakness of the bad, and it is clear that Plato's judgment was true; the  wise alone are able to do what they would, while the wicked follow their  own hearts' lust, but can _not_ accomplish what they would. For they go  on in their wilfulness fancying they will attain what they wish for in  the paths of delight; but they are very far from its attainment, since  shameful deeds lead not to happiness.'

THE BONDAGE OF PASSION.          When high-enthroned the monarch sits, resplendent in the pride      Of purple robes, while flashing steel guards him on every side;      When baleful terrors on his brow with frowning menace lower,      And Passion shakes his labouring breast--how dreadful seems his power!      But if the vesture of his state from such a one thou tear,      Thou'lt see what load of secret bonds this lord of earth doth wear.      Lust's poison rankles; o'er his mind rage sweeps in tempest rude;      Sorrow his spirit vexes sore, and empty hopes delude.      Then thou'lt confess: one hapless wretch, whom many lords oppress,      Does never what he would, but lives in thraldom's helplessness.        III.      'Thou seest, then, in what foulness unrighteous deeds are sunk, with  what splendour righteousness shines. Whereby it is manifest that  goodness never lacks its reward, nor crime its punishment. For, verily,  in all manner of transactions that for the sake of which the particular  action is done may justly be accounted the reward of that action, even  as the wreath for the sake of which the race is run is the reward  offered for running. Now, we have shown happiness to be that very good  for the sake of which all things are done. Absolute good, then, is  offered as the common prize, as it were, of all human actions. But,  truly, this is a reward from which it is impossible to separate the good  man, for one who is without good cannot properly be called good at all;  wherefore righteous dealing never misses its reward. Rage the wicked,  then, never so violently, the crown shall not fall from the head of the  wise, nor wither. Verily, other men's unrighteousness cannot pluck from  righteous souls their proper glory.

The teacher's, or mother's, discretion should, however,      decide what and how much of such original should be read, and what      it is best to say of it.    40: I have not attempted to quote the exact words usually given.    41: Socrates.
