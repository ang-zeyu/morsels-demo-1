Urgent to curtail if necessary expenditure on  Public Relations, National Programming and Radio during the next two  years. Ardently praying for solution of problem, removal of difficulties,  attainment of high objectives.    [November 25, 1948]            PRELIMINARY TEMPLE CONTRACTS      Welcome preliminary contracts for Temple and determination to ensure  completion. Advise drastic reduction in appropriation for activities  except budgets for Latin America and European campaign, if maximum sum for  Temple is exceeded. Praying for removal of difficulties, continual divine  guidance, wise conduct of manifold activities for Faith. Deepest love.

Carmel of  a consignment of thirty-two granite monolith columns, part of the initial  shipment of material ordered for construction of the arcade of the Bab's  Sepulcher, designed to envelop and preserve the sacred previous structure  reared by 'Abdu'l-Baha. Building operations are soon starting  notwithstanding the difficulties of the present situation. I am  supplicating the Almighty's guidance and sustaining grace for successive  stages of an enterprise envisaged sixty years ago by Baha'u'llah,  initiated by the Center of His Covenant, designed to culminate as  contemplated by Him in erection of a superstructure to be crowned by a  golden dome marking the consummation at the heart of the Mountain of God  of the momentous undertaking born through the generating influence of the  Will of the Founder of our beloved Faith, so dear to the heart of His  blessed Son, and dedicated to the memory of the Martyr-Prophet, the  immortal Herald of the Baha'i Dispensation.    [December 13, 1948]            DRASTIC BUDGET REDUCTION      Further drastic reduction in budget for next two years including temporary  suspension of Public Relations, National Programming, radio activities;  World Order, Baha'i World publications permissible if necessary.    [December 22, 1948]            FURTHER BUDGET REDUCTION      Advise plan two. Urge, however, maintain permanent entrance ways,  vestibules and metal doors. Also permanent rubber tile or terrazzo floor.  Considering soaring prices, shortness of period, weighty issues involved,  approve still more drastic reduction of budget, complete suspension during  two years of appropriations for activities unconnected with European  project, Latin American work and assembly consolidation in United States.    [January 13, 1949]    (\"Plan two\" refers to a series of possible Temple construction schedules  submitted to the Guardian.)            CURTAILMENT OF SOME ACTIVITIES      Budgets for activities in Europe, Latin America and consolidation work in  United States should not be reduced owing to their vital relation to  Second Seven Year Plan. All other activities, whether connected with  proclamation of Faith, publications, Baha'i Magazine, Baha'i World or  schools, should either be drastically curtailed or suspended during two  years. Holding Annual Convention and maintenance of Baha'i News essential.

Appeal on my behalf to  subscribers in East and West to devote their subscription fee to Temple  Fund. Owing to present emergency such action would be highly meritorious.    [February 28, 1949]            A TESTING PERIOD RECALLING ORDEALS OF THE DAWN-BREAKERS      The first half of the opening decade of the second Baha'i century is  terminating. The great-minded, stout-hearted, high-spirited American  Baha'i Community, laden with the trophies accumulated in the course of its  fifty years' magnificent stewardship of the Faith of Baha'u'llah is  irresistibly embarking upon a two and a half year period unsurpassed in  its fateful consequences by any previous stage traversed in the  community's eventful history.    Its members, without exception, are called upon to steel themselves  without delay to face an unexpected emergency, seize a God-given  opportunity, meet a supreme challenge, and show forth a tenacity of  purpose, a solidarity in sacrifice, an austerity in everyday life, worthy  the Martyr-Prophet of their Faith as well as their heroic spiritual  forebears, the hundredth anniversary of whose agonizing tribulations,  including captivity, sieges, betrayals, spoliation and martyrdom, is being  commemorated during this same period.    No lesser tribute can be paid the memory of the glorious Bab, the immortal  Quddus, the lion-hearted Mulla Husayn, the erudite Vahid, the audacious  Hujjat, the illustrious seven martyrs of Tihran and a host of unnumbered  heroes whose lifeblood flowed so copiously in the course of the opening  decade of the first Baha'i century, by the privileged champion-builders of  the World Order of Baha'u'llah during the present critical stage in the  unfoldment of the Formative Age of His Dispensation, than a parallel  outpouring of their substance by the builders of the most holy House of  Worship laboring in the corresponding decade of the succeeding century.    The American Baha'i Community, exalted, singled out among sister  communities of East and West through revelation of the Tablets of the  Divine Plan, is unavoidably approaching a testing period, crucial,  prolonged, potent, purifying, clearly envisaged by 'Abdu'l-Baha, different  from but recalling in its severity the ordeals which afflicted the  dawn-breakers in a former Age.    The anticipated trials will enable its members to plumb greater depths of  consecration, soar to nobler heights of collective endeavor, and disclose  in fuller measure the future glory of their destiny.    Might not the strain, the stress, of the strenuous period now being  ushered in through inscrutable dispensations of Providence be productive  of perspicuous benefits and blessings reminiscent of the incalculable  outpourings of divine grace which followed closely in the train of the  woeful trials immortalizing the initial, the bloodiest, the most dramatic  period in the Heroic Age of the Baha'i Dispensation.    [March 16, 1949]            ARCADE OF THE BAB'S SHRINE BEGUN      Convey to friends the joyful historic news of commencement of construction  of arcade of the Bab's Shrine coinciding with fortieth anniversary of the  placing of His remains in marble sarcophagus in vault of the same shrine  by 'Abdu'l-Baha.    [March 21, 1949]            ONE REMAINING OBJECTIVE HANGS IN THE BALANCE      The American Baha'i Community, undefeated as yet in the performance of any  task undertaken collectively by its members, in the course of its eventful  history, is now entering a period of grave emergency, that will try the  mettle of every single one of its members. Severe as the challenge will  be, however prolonged the test, no matter how distracting the condition of  the world about them, the issues which claim every ounce of their energy  and call for their sustained, wholehearted, concentrated attention are so  weighty that none can evaluate at present the influence they will exert on  the course of the community's future destiny.    There can be no doubt that the Second Seven Year Plan, the vital link  binding the initial and concluding stages of the first epoch in the  progressive evolution of 'Abdu'l-Baha's long-term continually unfolding  Plan, has reached its crucial phase--a phase on which hinge the fortunes  not only of the Plan itself but of the community as a whole. The fourth  objective of the Plan, the transatlantic project, on which its members  have embarked, has, four years ahead of schedule, been, to all intents and  purposes, victoriously achieved. The third objective has been partly  attained, while its complete fulfillment, as a direct consequence of the  marvelous success that has attended the valiant labors of the American  pioneers and the newly enrolled native believers in Latin America, appears  to be now fully assured. The attainment of the first objective has, as a  result of the remarkable impetus given, during the opening years of the  Plan, to the multiplication of spiritual assemblies and the proclamation  of the Faith in North America, been greatly facilitated, and will, with  steady effort, involving not too great an expenditure of energy, be  insured in the course of the concluding phase of the Plan. The completion  of the Mother Temple of the West, the sacredness of which neither the  first Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar of the Baha'i world, nor any future House of  Worship to be erected by the followers of Baha'u'llah, in any country, at  any future date, can rival, in time for the celebration of its Jubilee, is  the one remaining objective that now hangs precariously in the balance.  Owing to a combination of circumstances wholly beyond the control of its  builders, this task has assumed a critical importance, and is of such  vital urgency, that no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19270"],[0,"Directives from the Guardian (#17)"],[1,"Assembly. This  distinguishing right which the believer possesses, however, does not carry  with it nor does it imply an obligation to cast his vote, if he feels that  the circumstances under which he lives do not justify or allow him to  exercise that right intelligently and with understanding. This is a matter  which should be left to the individual to decide himself according to his  own conscience and discretion.\"            216: VOTING RIGHTS (STATUS OF INDIVIDUALS DEPRIVED OF)      \"Concerning your question as to the status of those individuals whom the  Local Assembly or the N.S.A. have considered it necessary to deprive of  the voting right and to suspend from local meetings and gatherings; such  action which Local and National Assemblies have been empowered to take  against such recalcitrant members, however justified and no matter how  severe, should under no circumstances be considered as implying the  complete expulsion of the individuals affected from the Cause. The  suspension of voting and other administrative rights of an individual,  always conditional and therefore temporary, can never have such far  reaching implications, since it constitutes merely an administrative  sanction; whereas his expulsion or ex-communication from the Faith, which  can be effected by the Guardian alone in his capacity as the supreme  spiritual head of the community, has far-reaching spiritual implications  affecting the very soul of that believer. The former, as already stated,  is an administrative sanction, whereas the latter is essentially  spiritual, involving not only the particular relationship of a believer to  his local or National Assembly, but his very spiritual existence in the  Cause. It follows, therefore, that a believer can continue calling himself  a Baha'i even though he may cease to be a voting member of the community.  But in case he is excluded from the body of the Cause by an act of the  Guardian he ceases to be a believer and cannot possibly identify himself  even nominally with the Faith.\"            217: WORK, BAHA'I      \"If the believers could properly evaluate the work they are doing they  would be astonished at its importance, but they are in the position of not  being able to see the forest for the trees; they are too close to it to  realize its true import.\"            218: WORK, DAILY--(BAHA'U'LLAH'S COMMAND CONCERNING DAILY WORK)      \"With reference to Baha'u'llah's command concerning the engagement of the  believers in some sort of profession; the teachings are most emphatic on  this matter, particularly the statement in the Aqdas to this effect which  makes it quite clear that idle people who lack the desire to work can have  no place in the new World Order. As a corollary of this principle,  Baha'u'llah further states that mendicity should not only be discouraged  but entirely wiped out from the face of society. It is the duty of those  who are in charge of the organization of society to give every individual  the opportunity of acquiring the necessary talent in some kind of  profession, and also the means of utilizing such a talent, both for its  own sake and for the sake of earning the means of his livelihood. Every  individual, no matter how handicapped and limited he may be, is under the  obligation of engaging in some work or profession, for work, especially  when performed in the spirit of service, is according to Baha'u'llah, a  form of worship. It has not only a utilitarian purpose, but has a value in  itself, because it draws us nearer to God, and enables to better grasp His  purpose for us in this world. It is obvious, therefore, that the  inheritance of wealth cannot make anyone immune from daily work. As to the  question of retirement from work for individuals who have reached a  certain age, this is a matter on which the International House of Justice  will have to legislate as there are no provisions in the Aqdas concerning  it.\"            219: WORLD FEDERATION--(ON BAHA'I PARTICIPATION IN INTERNATIONAL  CONFERENCES)      \"He feels that the statement which your assembly made in your letter to  him ... regarding Baha'is cooperating with peace and world unity  conferences, covers the subject adequately. There is no reason to draw a  line of demarcation as to whether the type of world federation being  promoted by a certain society involves governments or peoples. The point  is that if it is not allied to any particular political faction, and is  not either Eastern or Western in its projects, the Baha'is may appear as  speakers on its platform and give it moral support.\"            220: YEAR NINE, THE      \"The 'Year Nine' is an abbreviation of 1269 A.H. The beginning of the Year  Nine occurred about two months after His (Baha'u'llah's) imprisonment in  that dungeon. We do not know the exact time He received this first  intimation... We therefore regard the entire Year Nine as a Holy Year, and  the emphasis should be placed ... on the entire year, which started in  October, 1852. This means our Centenary Year of Celebration will be from  October, 1952 to October, 1953.\"            221: YOUTH      \"He quite agrees that the dangers facing the modern youth are becoming  increasingly grave, and call for immediate solution. But, as experience  clearly shows, the remedy to this truly sad and perplexing situation is  not to be found in traditional and ecclesiastical religion. The dogmatism  of the Church has been discarded once for all. What can control youth and  save it from the pitfalls of the crass materialism of the age is the power  of a genuine, constructive and living Faith such as the one revealed to  the world by Baha'u'llah. Religion as in the past, is still the world's  sole hope, but not that form of religion which our ecclesiastical leaders  strive vainly to preach. Divorced from true religion, morals lose their  effectiveness and cease to guide and control man's individual and social  life. But when true religion is combined with true ethics, then moral  progress becomes a possibility and not a mere ideal.    \"The need of our modern youth is for such a type of ethics founded on pure  religious faith. Not until these two are rightly combined and brought into  full action can there be any hope for the future of the race.\"    \"The world that lies ahead of us after this war is going to be in a  terrible condition, and if the believers are going to accomplish their  duty and present the Divine Solution to mankind, they must prepare  themselves for the great tasks that lie ahead. This particularly applies  to Baha'i youth. Young men and women in the Faith must be deep and  thoughtful scholars of its teachings, so that they can teach in a way that  will convince people that all the problems facing them have a remedy. They  must grasp the Administration, so that they can wisely and efficiently  administer the ever-growing affairs of the Cause; and they must exemplify  the Baha'i way of living. All this is not easy--but the Guardian is always  greatly encouraged to see the spirit animating such young believers as  yourself. He has high hopes of what your generation will accomplish.\"            222: YOUTH (REGARDING THE AGE OF FIFTEEN)      \"Regarding the age of fifteen fixed by Baha'u'llah: This relates only to  purely spiritual functions and obligations and is not related to the  degree of administrative capacity and fitness which is a totally different  thing, and is, for the present, fixed at twenty-one.\"    \"Baha'i youth under twenty-one may serve on Committees.    \"The question of young Baha'is being permitted to serve on committees  other than the Youth Committee has been raised in a number of letters  recently, and in considering the matter he felt that Baha'i young people  under twenty-one should not be denied the privilege of committee work.  Though they cannot be voting members of Baha'i communities (or exercise  the electoral vote at all until they reach that age), and though they  cannot, likewise, be elected to Assemblies, there is no reason why they  should not serve the Cause on various committees as all committees,  national or local, are subordinate to Assemblies and their members not  elected but appointed, and appointed by Assemblies. We have many devoted  and talented young believers who can be of great assistance to the Cause  even though not yet legally of age.\"    \"This Cause, although it embraces with equal esteem people of all ages,  has a special message and mission for the youth of your generation. It is  their charter for their future, their hope, their guarantee of better days  to come. Therefore the Guardian is especially happy that the young Baha'is  are active in the pioneer work.\"    \"The importance of young Baha'is to become thoroughly steeped in every  branch of the teachings can not be over-emphasized, as they have great  teaching tasks ahead of them to accomplish.\"            223: BAHA'I YOUTH IN SCHOOL      \"The problem with which you are faced is one which concerns and seriously  puzzles many of our present-day youth. How to attain spirituality is  indeed a question to which every young man and woman must sooner or later  try to find a satisfactory answer. It is precisely because no such  satisfactory answer has been given or found, that the modern youth finds  itself bewildered, and is being consequently carried away by the  materialistic forces that are so powerfully undermining the foundations of  man's moral and spiritual life.    \"Indeed the chief reason for the evils now rampant in society is the lack  of spirituality. The materialistic civilization of our age has so much  absorbed the energy and interest of mankind that people in general do no  longer feel the necessity of raising themselves above the forces and  conditions of their daily material existence. There is not sufficient  demand for things that we call spiritual to differentiate them from the  needs and requirements of our physical existence.    \"The"]]]
