[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19271"],[0,"Dawn of a New Day (#17)"],[1," some definite  results are accomplished. Also, he feels, your Assembly should endeavour  to strengthen the weak areas which have been recently opened, and also  launch a wide and systematic campaign for the dissemination of Baha'i  literature throughout the whole country. Membership in Baha'i Assembly or  Committee is a Sacred Obligation    ...The Guardian wishes you to make clear to all the believers that  membership in a Baha'i Assembly or Committee is a sacred obligation which  should be gladly and confidently accepted by every loyal and conscientious  member of the Community, no matter how humble and inexperienced. Once  elected to serve in a given Assembly a believer's duty is to do his utmost  to attend all Assembly meetings, and cooperate with his fellow-members,  unless, however, he is prevented from doing so by some major reason such  as illness, and even then he should notify the Assembly to this effect.  The N.S.A.'s duty is to urge, and also facilitate attendance at assembly  meetings. If a member has no valid reason to justify his repeated absence  from assembly meetings, he should be advised, and even warned, and if such  warning is deliberately ignored by him, the assembly will then have the  right to suspend his rights as a voting member of the Community. Such  administrative sanction would seem to be absolutely imperative and  necessary, and while not tantamount to a complete expulsion of such a  member from the Cause, deprives him of any real participation in its  administrative functions and affairs, and is thus a most effective  corrective measure which the Assembly can use against all such  half-hearted and irresponsible individuals in the Community.          Meaning of Resurrection      ...Concerning the meaning of \"Resurrection\": although this term is often  used by Baha'u'llah in His Writings, as in the passage quoted in your  letter, its meaning is figurative. The tomb mentioned is also allegorical,  i.e. the tomb of unbelief. The Day of Resurrection, according to Baha'i  interpretation, is the Judgement Day, the Day when unbelievers will be  called upon to give account of their actions, and whether the world has  prevented them from acknowledging the new Revelation.    The passage in Baha'u'llah's Tablet in which He explains the Sura of \"The  Sun\" should not be interpreted literally. It does not mean that after the  Day of Resurrection praise and peace will cease to be vouchsafed to the  Prophet. Rather it means to the end of time, i.e. indefinitely and for all  times.    The intercession spoken of by Baha'u'llah in one of His prayers which you  have quoted is a purely spiritual act and is applicable to Muhammad as  well as to all Prophets. This passage, however, refers more particularly  to that kind of intercession in which Muslims believe, though the manner  and circumstances of it, according to Baha'i belief, are mysterious and  unknowable.          Teaching--The Paramount Task      [From the Guardian:]    I long to hear of the progress of your teaching work in those areas and  provinces where the light of the Faith has not as yet shone forth.  Teaching is the paramount task that urgently demands the concentrated  attention and the complete consecration of the united and persistent  efforts of the believers of India and Burma at the present stage of the  Six-Year Plan which they of their own accord have so magnificently  initiated. No dissipation of efforts, no delay in the initiation and  execution of the necessary measures for its success should be allowed. All  assemblies, all committees and individuals should regard the teaching work  as the most essential factor in the discharge of their obligations to the  Faith of Baha'u'llah, and as the supreme purpose of the machinery of the  Administrative Order which they have lately so laboriously and faithfully  erected. I will from all my heart pray that the high aim they pursue may  be reached, that their hopes may be fulfilled, and that their individual  and corporate lives may equally reflect the noble principles that animate  their Cause.    July 2, 1939          Martha Root's Arrival in Bombay      Your joint and welcome message of October 18th written on the occasion of  our beloved sister Miss Martha Root's arrival in Bombay has duly reached  the Guardian and his heart is filled with gratitude to you for the very  warm and befitting welcome you have so kindly extended to that  well-beloved star-servant of the Cause. This is truly in keeping with the  tradition of warm hospitality for which our Indian believers have already  won such a high reputation. The cordiality you have shown this  distinguished international teacher on her previous visits to India could  have hardly been surpassed, and there is every reason to believe,  therefore, that on this trip, which will be probably the most extended one  she has ever been able to undertake throughout that continent, she will be  the object of the same devotion and love manifested towards her on  previous occasions.    [From the Guardian:]    May the Almighty bless you for the magnificent welcome accorded to such an  outstanding champion of the Cause, and may He enable you, in conjunction  with her, to lend a mighty impetus to the progress of the Faith and the  extension of its institutions.    November 4, 1939          Paramount Task Facing the Believers      What you had written him regarding the various steps taken by the N.S.A.  to further the Six-Year Plan of Teaching has immeasurably rejoiced his  heart, and he too joins with your Assembly in humbly supplicating  Baha'u'llah to vouchsafe to all those dear friends who have offered to  undertake pioneer teaching in various parts of India such measure of His  guidance and blessings as would enable them to effectively further the  interests of this Plan. He would urge you all to persevere in your  self-sacrificing exertions, and, notwithstanding the various handicaps  under which you may be compelled to labour, to confidently strive to  achieve this high teaching objective.    [From the Guardian:]    The energetic prosecution of the Six-Year Plan, despite the perils, the  uncertainties and gravity of the present hour, is the paramount task  facing the believers of India and Burma. All projects and activities,  however desirable and urgent, must henceforth be subordinated to this most  pressing and vital issue, inasmuch as it is the fountain-head from which  all future blessings will flow and the one and only instrument which can  at the present time, most effectively establish and consolidate the  administrative order of the Faith throughout the Indian Peninsula. My  prayers for your signal success in such a mighty and glorious enterprise  will continue to be offered, with increasing fervour, at the Threshold of  Baha'u'llah. Persevere and be confident.    November 26, 1939          Passing Away of Dearest Martha      Your very kind message ... expressing your profound sorrow and sympathy at  the passing away of our beloved sister Miss Martha Root has just reached  our dear Guardian, and he feels indeed most deeply touched by the very  thoughtful words which you had been moved to convey to him. The loss which  the entire Baha'i world has come to sustain through her untimely departure  from this world is indeed enormous, and can be compensated only partially  by the self-sacrificing efforts which our dear Baha'i teachers in East and  West are now exerting in their respective fields of teaching.    The Guardian's hope, however, is that, spurred by the noble example of  Martha's life and character, the friends in every land will make a supreme  and united effort to carry onward the great teaching task which she had so  untiringly been endeavouring to accomplish during all these years, and  thus bring eternal joy and impart infinite hope and solace to her heart in  the other world.    [From the Guardian:]    I deeply appreciate, and am greatly touched by, the noble sentiments you  have expressed. The passing of dearest Martha, that distinguished hero of  the Cause of Baha'u'llah, is indeed a great loss to those who labour for  His Cause, both in the East and West. May her glorious example continue to  inspire the friends in India and Burma to tread in her footsteps, and to  extend the work she so nobly initiated.    December 8, 1939          Sacred Task      It greatly pleased and encouraged him to know that the Annual Convention  held this year in Poona has proved such a high success, and that the  important decisions taken by the delegates with the view of intensifying  the teaching campaign in India and Burma are being effectively implemented  by the offer made by so many of the friends to teach and travel in virgin  territories. He wishes these dear believers, who have so heroically  responded to the call of the hour, every blessing and success in their  respective fields of teaching, and will pray most earnestly for the  confirmation of their labours in the pursuit of their high and sacred  task.    May 14, 1940          Steady Extension of the Teaching Campaign      The slow yet steady extension of the teaching campaign throughout India is  a matter which greatly rejoices his heart, and for which he feels moved to  convey his warmest congratulations to the N.S.A. Considering the well-nigh  insufferable obstacles in your way, and the difficult conditions created  by the war, the progress so far achieved, though small, has been  remarkable in many ways, and augurs well for the future of the Six-Year  Plan which your Assembly is so energetically carrying out.    The signal success which the able and untiring efforts of Mr. & Mrs.  Bakhtiari, Mr. M. H. Ilmi ... have won for the Cause in Kashmir deserves  particular mention; and it is to be hoped that the group already  established in that center will steadily develop and soon attain the  status of a Spiritual Assembly. To these dear teachers who have so  successfully"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19274"],[0,"Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand (#17)"],[1,"and  dearly-beloved community, and particularly its elected representatives, my  heartfelt congratulations on their splendid achievements which posterity  will recognize as deeds that have truly enriched and adorned the annals of  the Faith in the opening years of the second Baha'i century.    As the processes impelling a rapidly evolving Order on the highroad of its  destiny multiply and gather momentum, attention should be increasingly  directed to the vital need of ensuring, by every means possible, the  deepening of the Faith, the understanding and the spiritual life of the  individuals who, as the privileged members of this community, are called  upon to participate in this glorious unfoldment, and are lending their  assistance to this historic evolution. A profound study of the Faith which  they have espoused, its history, its spiritual as well as administrative  principles; a thorough understanding of the Covenant of Baha'u'llah and of  the Will of 'Abdu'l-Baha, a deeper realization of the implications of the  claims advanced by the Founders of the Faith; strict adherence to the laws  and principles which they have established; a greater dedication to the  fundamentals and verities enshrined in their teachings--these constitute, I  feel convinced, the urgent need of the members of this rapidly expanding  community. For upon this spiritual foundation must depend the solidity of  the institutions which they are now so painstakingly erecting. Every  outward thrust into new fields, every multiplication of Baha'i  institutions, must be paralleled by a deeper thrust of the roots which  sustain the spiritual life of the community and ensure its sound  development. From this vital, this ever-present need, attention must at no  time be diverted; nor must it be, under any circumstances, neglected, or  subordinated to the no less vital and urgent task of ensuring the outer  expansion of Baha'i administrative institutions. That this community, so  alive, so devoted, so strikingly and rapidly developing, may maintain a  proper balance between these two essential aspects of its development, and  march forward with rapid strides and along sound lines toward the goal of  the Plan it has adopted, is the ardent hope of my heart and my constant  prayer.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF AUGUST 22, 1949      The National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Australia and New  Zealand.    August 22, 1949    Dear Baha'i Friends:    Your letters dated February 23; March 14, 16; April 4, 5, 11; May 2, 13,  27; June 1, 7, 21 (3 of this date), 24; have all been received, as well as  their enclosures, and the material sent under separate cover, and our  beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.    He has gone over the copy of the By-Laws of a local assembly which you  sent him, and he approves of the slight changes you have made in the  wording, as well as the additions at the very beginning, providing you  consider the addition essential in order to secure the government  recognition you are going to seek in the future. However, he feels that  Article VI is not correct in the form you have given it, because you state  \"all persons resident ... who have attained the age of 15 years\". The  original New York By-Laws are more correct, because they differentiate  clearly between all members of the Community and voting members who are 21  years of age or more. In other words children under 15 are Baha'is  according to the New York version, which is correct, but according to your  version only people over 15 years are Baha'is which is not correct. He  thinks you should go back to the New York version. The declaration of  faith by children when they reach the age of 15 in the United States is in  order to enable the American Youth to apply for exemption, under the  American laws, from active military service. It has no other purpose, but  in that country is expedient. It is not necessary to add such a clause to  your By-Laws.    Other points which he feels are not necessary and should be deleted are  those heavily underlined portions in Section 5 of Article XII and Article  XIII. In both these cases the New York By-Laws should be followed and not  added to. Likewise he feels that in Article XIV, under the heading \"These  By-Laws\" (on page 11) B and C should be deleted as they are not in the New  York original and not necessary. Naturally, all Assemblies are under  N.S.A. jurisdiction, but this need not be included.    He wishes the essentials to be maintained as per the New York By-Laws, but  not amplified and added to, as this will gradually lead, all over the  Baha'i world, to a steady addition of unessential rules and restrict the  freedom and plasticity of the Cause. As he has repeatedly told the  American and other National assemblies, it is much better to deal with  situations and new requirements as they arise, and not to have it all down  in black and white and rigid before hand.    He is very happy to see you are steadily working towards the goal of  having local assemblies empowered to hold property legally and to perform  Baha'i marriages. No doubt the act of the Canadian Parliament recently  passed, and giving the Canadian N.S.A. legal status will act as an  important precedent when the time is ripe for you to present your own  petitions to your Government.    The news that there is now a spiritual assembly in every capital city of  the various states in Australia pleased him immensely. This is an historic  land-mark in your progress out there, and must act as a keen incentive to  further exploits on the part of the Australian Baha'is.    He was also delighted to see that certain of the Baha'is have received  official permission not to work on Baha'i Holy Days. He admires the  initiative these believers have shown, and hopes many others will follow  their example.    Likewise, he was very pleased to see you are holding your N.S.A. meetings  in various centers, as this will greatly stimulate the local work, draw  the friends closer to your body, and promote unity and enthusiasm amongst  them.    The Act of your Assembly in depriving Mr. ... of his voting rights was  wise and correct. Unless he demonstrates an entire change of character he  certainly cannot claim to be a member of any Baha'i Community.    He appreciated the Secretary's forwarding to him copies of the Bishop's  letters acknowledging receipt of \"God Passes By\"--though their answers in  no way imply any spiritual wakefulness on their parts, alas!    He was very happy to see that New Zealand friends were present at the  Convention. In general the work in New Zealand is certainly progressing,  and beginning to show really promising signs for the immediate future.    The generous donation of land to Yerrinbool School by Mr. Styles will  certainly re-inforce that valuable Baha'i property, and the Guardian very  much appreciated this act of his.    His confidence in, and admiration for, the Baha'is of Australia and New  Zealand is steadily increasing, as he witnesses the enthusiasm and  self-confidence of the believers out there, and the increased capacity of  their National Body to handle wisely and capably the affairs of the Cause.    He assures you all, and through you the believers, of his loving prayers  for your success and the attainment of all the goals of your historic  Plan.    With Baha'i love,  R. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The notable progress achieved in recent months, in so many fields and in  spite of adverse circumstances, demonstrates afresh the vitality of the  faith and the soundness of the outlook, of the members of the  fast-advancing and steadily consolidating community of the followers of  the Cause of Baha'u'llah in Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania. This  remarkable process of expansion and consolidation augurs well for the  ultimate success of the Plan to which the combined resources of this  community are committed. The various reports, both local and national  which I have perused with sustained interest and quickened admiration,  attest the rapid and sound development, of the institutions of a Faith  that is so rich in promise, and whose interests are being promoted with  such devotion, energy, loyalty and consecration by the members of this  community.    What has been achieved, in both the teaching field and in the  administrative sphere of Baha'i service, however is but a stepping stone  to the still greater victories which the gradual unfoldment of the Plan  must inevitably produce. The multiplication of the groups and assemblies  that constitute the bedrock of the Faith, must accompany the consolidating  process which must bring in its wake, on the one hand, the incorporation  of these assemblies and their recognition by the civil authorities, and  the establishment, on the other, of Baha'i local endowments and the right  of these assemblies to execute, officially, the fundamental laws of the  Most Holy Book regarding both marriage and divorce that constitute the  distinguishing feature of this most holy and august Dispensation.    The task undertaken is immense, fraught with momentous possibilities,  highly delicate in nature, and bound to have far-reaching repercussions,  not only in the West, and particularly in the continent of Europe, where  the institutions of Baha'u'llah's Administrative Order are emerging with  such rapidity and showing such promise, but on the continent of Asia,  where the overwhelming majority of the followers of the Most Great Name,  have endured such grievous afflictions, and are faced with grave peril,  and are battling so heroically against the forces of darkness with which  they are encompassed.    The nature of the work in which this wide-awake, untrammelled  unprejudiced, freedom-loving community, is so energetically engaged,  cannot, therefore, be regarded as a purely local and isolated enterprise,  "]]]
