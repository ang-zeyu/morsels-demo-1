In some countries the \"fire  drake\" is a bird with gleaming breast: in Babylonia it assumed the  form of a bull, and may have had some connection with the bull of  lshtar. Like the Indian \"Dasyu\" and \"Dasa\",[88] Gallu was applied in  the sense of \"foreign devil\" to human and superhuman adversaries of  certain monarchs. Some of the supernatural beings resemble our elves  and fairies and the Indian Rakshasas. Occasionally they appear in  comely human guise; at other times they are vaguely monstrous. The  best known of this class is Lilith, who, according to Hebrew  tradition, preserved in the Talmud, was the demon lover of Adam. She  has been immortalized by Dante Gabriel Rossetti:        Of Adam's first wife Lilith, it is told      (The witch he loved before the gift of Eve)      That, ere the snake's, her sweet tongue could deceive,      And her enchanted hair was the first gold.      And still she sits, young while the earth is old,      And, subtly of herself contemplative,      Draws men to watch the bright web she can weave,      Till heart and body and life are in its hold.      The rose and poppy are her flowers; for where      Is he not found, O Lilith, whom shed scent      And soft shed kisses and soft sleep shall snare?      Lo! as that youth's eyes burned at thine, so went      Thy spell through him, and left his straight neck bent      And round his heart one strangling golden hair.    Lilith is the Babylonian Lilithu, a feminine form of Lilu, the  Sumerian Lila. She resembles Surpanakha of the _Ramayana_, who made  love to Rama and Lakshmana, and the sister of the demon Hidimva, who  became enamoured of Bhima, one of the heroes of the _Mahabharata_,[89]  and the various fairy lovers of Europe who lured men to eternal  imprisonment inside mountains, or vanished for ever when they were  completely under their influence, leaving them demented. The elfin  Lilu similarly wooed young women, like the Germanic Laurin of the  \"Wonderful Rose Garden\",[90] who carried away the fair lady Kunhild to  his underground dwelling amidst the Tyrolese mountains, or left them  haunting the place of their meetings, searching for him in vain:        A savage place! as holy and enchanted      As ere beneath the waning moon was haunted      By woman wailing for her demon lover...      His flashing eyes, his floating hair!      Weave a circle round him thrice,      And close your eyes with holy dread,      For he on honey dew hath fed      And drunk the milk of Paradise.                _Coleridge's Kubla Khan._    Another materializing spirit of this class was Ardat Lili, who appears  to have wedded human beings like the swan maidens, the mermaids, and  Nereids of the European folk tales, and the goddess Ganga, who for a  time was the wife of King Shantanu of the _Mahabharata_.[91]    The Labartu, to whom we have referred, was a female who haunted  mountains and marshes; like the fairies and hags of Europe, she stole  or afflicted children, who accordingly had to wear charms round their  necks for protection. Seven of these supernatural beings were reputed  to be daughters of Anu, the sky god.    The Alu, a storm deity, was also a spirit which caused nightmare. It  endeavoured to smother sleepers like the Scandinavian hag Mara, and  similarly deprived them of power to move. In Babylonia this evil  spirit might also cause sleeplessness or death by hovering near a bed.  In shape it might be as horrible and repulsive as the Egyptian ghosts  which caused children to die from fright or by sucking out the breath  of life.    As most representatives of the spirit world were enemies of the  living, so were the ghosts of dead men and women. Death chilled all  human affections; it turned love to hate; the deeper the love had  been, the deeper became the enmity fostered by the ghost. Certain  ghosts might also be regarded as particularly virulent and hostile if  they happened to have left the body of one who was ceremonially  impure. The most terrible ghost in Babylonia was that of a woman who  had died in childbed. She was pitied and dreaded; her grief had  demented her; she was doomed to wail in the darkness; her impurity  clung to her like poison. No spirit was more prone to work evil  against mankind, and her hostility was accompanied by the most tragic  sorrow. In Northern India the Hindus, like the ancient Babylonians,  regard as a fearsome demon the ghost of a woman who died while  pregnant, or on the day of the child's birth.[92] A similar belief  prevailed in Mexico. In Europe there are many folk tales of dead  mothers who return to avenge themselves on the cruel fathers of  neglected children.    A sharp contrast is presented by the Mongolian Buriats, whose outlook  on the spirit world is less gloomy than was that of the ancient  Babylonians. According to Mr. Jeremiah Curtin, this interesting people  are wont to perform a ceremony with purpose to entice the ghost to  return to the dead body--a proceeding which is dreaded in the Scottish  Highlands.[93] The Buriats address the ghost, saying: \"You shall sleep  well. Come back to your natural ashes. Take pity on your friends. It  is necessary to live a real life. Do not wander along the mountains.  Do not be like bad spirits. Return to your peaceful home.... Come back  and work for your children. How can you leave the little ones?\" If it  is a mother, these words have great effect; sometimes the spirit moans  and sobs, and the Buriats tell that there have been instances of it  returning to the body.[94] In his _Arabia Deserta_[95] Doughty relates  that Arab women and children mock the cries of the owl. One explained  to him: \"It is a wailful woman seeking her lost child; she has become  this forlorn bird\". So do immemorial beliefs survive to our own day.    The Babylonian ghosts of unmarried men and women and of those without  offspring were also disconsolate night wanderers. Others who suffered  similar fates were the ghosts of men who died in battle far from home  and were left unburied, the ghosts of travellers who perished in the  desert and were not covered over, the ghosts of drowned men which rose  from the water, the ghosts of prisoners starved to death or executed,  the ghosts of people who died violent deaths before their appointed  time. The dead required to be cared for, to have libations poured out,  to be fed, so that they might not prowl through the streets or enter  houses searching for scraps of food and pure water. The duty of giving  offerings to the dead was imposed apparently on near relatives. As in  India, it would appear that the eldest son performed the funeral  ceremony: a dreadful fate therefore awaited the spirit of the dead  Babylonian man or woman without offspring. In Sanskrit literature  there is a reference to a priest who was not allowed to enter  Paradise, although he had performed rigid penances, because he had no  children.[96]    There were hags and giants of mountain and desert, of river and ocean.  Demons might possess the pig, the goat, the horse, the lion, or the  ibis, the raven, or the hawk. The seven spirits of tempest, fire, and  destruction rose from the depths of ocean, and there were hosts of  demons which could not be overcome or baffled by man without the  assistance of the gods to whom they were hostile. Many were sexless;  having no offspring, they were devoid of mercy and compassion. They  penetrated everywhere:        The high enclosures, the broad enclosures, like a flood        they pass through,      From house to house they dash along.      No door can shut them out;      No bolt can turn them back.      Through the door, like a snake, they glide,      Through the hinge, like the wind, they storm,      Tearing the wife from the embrace of the man,      Driving the freedman from his family home.[97]    These furies did not confine their unwelcomed attentions to mankind  alone:        They hunt the doves from their cotes,      And drive the birds from their nests,      And chase the marten from its hole....      Through the gloomy street by night they roam,      Smiting sheepfold and cattle pen,      Shutting up the land as with door and bolt.                _R.C. Thompson's Translation._    The Babylonian poet, like Burns, was filled with pity for the animals  which suffered in the storm:        List'ning the doors an' winnocks rattle,      I thought me o' the ourie cattle,      Or silly sheep, wha bide this brattle        O' winter war....      Ilk happing bird, wee, helpless thing!      That in the merry months o' spring      Delighted me to hear thee sing,        What comes o' thee?      Whare wilt thou cow'r thy chittering wing,        And close thy e'e?    According to Babylonian belief, \"the great storms directed from  heaven\" were caused by demons. Mankind heard them \"loudly roaring  above, gibbering below\".[98] The south wind was raised by Shutu, a  plumed storm demon resembling Hraesvelgur of the Icelandic Eddas:        Corpse-swallower sits at the end of heaven,        A Joetun in eagle form;      From his wings, they say, comes the wind which fares        Over all the dwellers of earth.[99]    The northern story of Thor's fishing, when he hooked and wounded the  Midgard serpent, is recalled by the Babylonian legend of Adapa, son of  the god Ea. This hero was engaged catching fish, when Shutu, the south  wind, upset his boat. In his wrath Adapa immediately attacked the  storm demon and shattered her pinions. Anu, the sky god, was moved to  anger against Ea's son and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16658"],[0,"Piano and Song (#17)"],[1,"ent,  discouragement, and anxious haste are apt to take the place of boldness,  confidence in one's self, and command of the music. It is the duty of  teachers, in choosing studies for the improvement of technique, to  select only such as are within the mechanical powers of the pupil, in  order that he may make steady progress, and may acquire a pure and  delicate style of execution, retaining at the same time a lively  interest in his pursuit. But why has the acquirement of this technique  been usually unsuccessful?    1. Because you begin to acquire it too late. In order to gain facility  and flexibility of the fingers and wrist (which a child in the sixth or  seventh year, with a skilful teacher, may acquire in four lessons), from  fifteen to twenty lessons, according to the construction of the hand,  are necessary with persons from ten to fourteen years old. For other  reasons also, we must urge that the mechanical facility should usually  be acquired, or at least a complete foundation for it laid in childhood,  and not left to be formed by a course which is destructive of all  spirit, at an age when labor is performed with self-consciousness,--an  age when our ladies are talking a great deal of musical interpretations,  of tenderness and depth of feeling, of poetry and inspiration in  playing, to which they are led by the possession of our classical piano  compositions and immortal master-works, and by intellectual friends and  teachers aiming at the highest culture. You reply: \"But even if your  mode of elementary instruction should meet with faithful disciples, how,  in such young pupils, are we to find perseverance and sense enough to  continue these severe exercises, even in your interesting manner?\" My  dear ladies, children ought to do it merely from habit, although in many  cases, after the beginning, talent and correct musical instinct may make  their appearance. Uninterrupted enjoyment would indeed be unnatural, and  where you find it vanity will usually be its moving spring, and this  seldom bears good fruit. You may as well ask whether our great literary  men and artists always like to go to school, or whether they did not  delight in a holiday. Let this be the answer to the strange question, Do  your daughters like to play? Good heavens! After they are able to play,  and that without much effort, and a little at sight; when they can  master, with a musical appreciation, easy, graceful salon music, or even  the easier compositions of Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Hummel,  Moscheles, &c.,--then they take pleasure in playing, and they play a  great deal, and with enthusiasm.    2. But, in case children should sometimes begin in their sixth year, you  must remember what is said, in the first chapter of this work, with  regard to the prevalent false method of teaching beginners. You,  however, are supposed to have had better and more sensible teachers. Let  me nevertheless quote for your amusement the remark which I have heard  so frequently in the course of my long life as a piano-teacher: \"In the  beginning, a poor, rattling piano, that is forty years old, and that is  tuned regularly once a year, and a cheap teacher, will do well enough.  As soon as the children learn to play really well, then we will have a  better piano and a better teacher.\" Yes; but that time never comes, and  the parents soon conclude that even the most gifted children have no  talent, and take no pleasure in music; and so they stop learning, only  to regret it when they are older. But the parents console themselves,  and after a while the old piano is never tuned at all. But, as I have  told you, I do not refer here to _your_ teachers, for whom I have a  personal regard, and who teach on excellent pianos.    3. Don't be angry with me for my suggestion, ladies: _you do not make  enough use of the minutes_. While our learned education absorbs so much  time, while our friends require so many hours, while, alas! balls and  dinners consume whole days, we must be sparing of the remaining minutes.    \"Now I must rush to the piano! I must go to dinner in ten minutes: two  scales, two finger exercises, two difficult passages out of the piece I  have to learn, and one exercise to invent on the dominant and  sub-dominant, are soon done; and then the dinner will taste all the  better.\"    \"My dear Agnes, we might talk for ever about this dreadful snow, it  won't melt the sooner for it: how do you like this passage that I am  going to play to you? It is from a charming Nocturne, by Chopin, and is  so difficult that I shall have to play it over fifty times, or else I  shall always stumble at this place, and I never shall know the Nocturne  to play to any one. Don't you think it is beautiful?--so spiritual and  original! I can tell you it will be something to boast of, when I have  accomplished that. You like it better the oftener I play it? So do I.\"    \"We have an invitation out. Mother has a great deal to arrange, and  directions to give. We shall have to go in ten minutes. I must rush to  the piano, though I am in rather an inconvenient toilette: I may as well  accustom myself to play in it. I shall have to spend three hours this  evening without any music. Well, to make up for it, I will occupy myself  for the next ten minutes with an exercise for this obstinate fourth  finger, though it is pretty dry. That weak finger has been a hindrance  to many a fine passage and scale. That is better! Now I can put on my  tight gloves. Suppose I should put on the left glove on the way.\"    Well, my young ladies, how many hours do you think all those minutes  would make in a year? But I hear you say, \"What is the use of worrying  to pick up all those stray minutes, like lost pins? We have a whole hour  to practise every day, when nothing prevents.\" Exactly, when nothing  prevents.    I will now tell you a few of my secrets for piano performers.    If in piano-playing, or in any art, you wish to attain success, you must  resolve to work every day, at least a little, on the technique. Sickness  and other unavoidable interruptions deprive you of days enough.    Practise always with unexhausted energy: the result will be tenfold. Do  you not frequently use the time for practising, when you have already  been at work studying for five or six hours? Have you then strength and  spirit enough to practise the necessary exercises for an hour or more,  and to study your music-pieces carefully and attentively, as your  teacher instructed you? Is not your mind exhausted, and are not your  hands and fingers tired and stiff with writing, so that you are tempted  to help out with your arms and elbows, which is worse than no practice  at all? But, my dear ladies, if you practise properly, several times  every day, ten minutes at a time, your strength and your patience are  usually sufficient for it; and, if you are obliged to omit your regular  \"hour's practice,\" you have, at any rate, accomplished something with  your ten minutes before breakfast, or before dinner, or at any leisure  moment. So, I beg of you, let me have my minutes.    Practise often, slowly, and without pedal, not only the smaller and  larger etudes, but also your pieces. In that way you gain, at least, a  correct, healthy mode of playing, which is the foundation of beautiful  playing. Do you do this when neither your teacher, nor your father or  mother is present to keep watch over you? Do you never say, \"Nobody is  listening\"?    Do you take enough healthy exercise in the open air? Active exercise, in  all weather, makes strong, enduring piano fingers, while subsisting on  indoor-air results in sickly, nervous, feeble, over-strained playing.  Strong, healthy fingers are only too essential for our present style of  piano-playing, which requires such extraordinary execution, and for our  heavy instruments. So I still beg for the minutes: your walks take up  hours enough.    Excessive and fatiguing feminine occupations, and drawing, or painting,  are by no means consistent with an earnest, practical musical education;  not only because both those occupations require so much time, but  because they deprive the fingers of the requisite pliability and  dexterity, while knitting, according to the latest discoveries, produces  an unnatural nervous excitement, which is unfavorable to healthy  progress in music. I at least, in my instruction on the piano, have  never been able to accomplish much with ladies who are devoted to  knitting, crochet, and embroidering. My dear ladies, you who have been  born in fortunate circumstances, and have been educated by your parents,  without regard to expense, should, at least, allow the poor girl in the  country, who is obliged to hide her talents under a bushel, the small  privilege of making a collar for your mother's or your aunt's birthday  present. I assure you your mother or your aunt, if you surprise them  instead with a fine piano performance, will be as much pleased as if you  strained your eyes and bent your back for days and nights over the  needle-work. And now as regards painting: painting and music, though  theoretically so nearly related, agree but poorly in practice; at least,  if you are in earnest about either. You say painters often play on the  guitar and the flute. That may be true: I will allow them those two  instruments. But piano-playing stands on a different footing, even for  mere amateurs. Sweet melodies on those instruments may afford an  agreeable companionship for the painter in his rambles through the woods  and over the hills; but piano-playing should be the friend of a  life-time, ennobled by the elevating enjoyment of lofty master-works.  Therefore, I beg you, do not dissipate your powers too much. Leave the  art of painting to your friends, who are either without talent for  music, or who have no opportunity to study it. Our short lives do not  allow the successful practice of several arts. Of what advantage to our  higher"]]]
