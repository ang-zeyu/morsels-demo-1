He was bigger than the Cocks, the  Hens, the Geese, and the Ducks, so when they were in his way and he  gobbled a gruff \"Move along,\" they murmured \"Oh, certainly,\" and  scampered away as fast as their legs would carry them. The Peacock was  larger than the Turkey Gobbler, it is true, but as long as he could sit  on a fence in the sunshine and have somebody admiring his train, he did  not care anything about the Gobbler, and they did not get in each  other's way.    There were seven Hen Turkeys, timid, sweet-tempered people, who were  fond of walking. They had never been known to answer back when the  Gobbler scolded them, although at times he was very unreasonable. This  was polite of them, but it made the Gobbler more careless than ever of  the way in which he spoke. The Black Spanish Hen said it made her  wattles tingle to hear him find fault with them. She wouldn't have stood  it--no, indeed!    When the Black Spanish Cock heard her say so, he shook his feathers and  smiled a queer little smile, and said, \"I certainly know that she would  not.\" The other fowls looked at each other, and the Shanghai Cock winked  his round little eyes at the Dorking Hen, and she had to oil a feather  on the under side of her wing just then, so, of course, nobody saw her  laugh--if she did laugh.    The Black Spanish fowls were kind-hearted and honest, and had fine  manners, but they would not stand it to be spoken to hastily by any one  who was not very much bigger than they, and it was said that the Cock  had once--only once--but then, perhaps it would be just as well not to  tell what the other fowls had heard about their family quarrel, for,  after all, it did not come very straight, the Pigs having told the  Geese, and the Geese telling the Ducks, and the Ducks just mentioning it  to the Peacock, and the Peacock having spoken of it to the Dorking Hen.    It was now late in the fall, and all the Turkeys went walking together  again. One would think that, after being separated from the rest all  summer and part of the spring, the Gobbler would have been very polite  when he joined them, but no; he was more quick-tempered than ever. He  was not fond of young Turkeys, and their constant chattering annoyed  him. \"Can't you find some way to keep those children quiet?\" he would  say, and made such a fuss that the Hen Turkeys called them aside and  tried to amuse them for a while.    Hen Turkeys are most loving mothers, and in the early spring first one  and then another had stolen away to lay and hatch her eggs. If a Hen  Turkey wanted a chance to lay an egg at this season, she watched the  Gobbler and left the flock when his back was turned. As she came near  her nest, she would stop and look around to make sure he did not see  where it was. She knew that the Gobbler did not like to have her raise  young Turkeys, and that if he could find the nest, he would break every  egg in it. After she had laid her egg, she would wander back in a  careless way, quite as though she had only been to the watering-trough  for a drink.    Once the Hen Turkeys had talked about this when the Gobbler could not  hear. \"It doesn't seem right not to tell him,\" the youngest had said.    \"Well, my dear,\" said another, \"it is the only way we can do, if we want  to save our eggs and raise our children. Gobblers always act in that  way.\"    \"Are you sure?\" said the young Hen Turkey.    \"Sure!\" was the answer. \"You wouldn't be here to-day if your mother  hadn't done as we do.\"    So the youngest Hen Turkey had changed her mind and hidden her eggs like  the rest, for, in spite of aching legs and all that is hard in hatching  eggs, Hen Turkeys always want to raise broods in the springtime. When  one of them had laid as many eggs as she wanted to hatch, she began  sitting on them, and would not walk with the flock at all. One by one  the Hen Turkeys had done this until the Gobbler was left quite alone. He  did not like it at all, and wanted more than ever to find and break the  eggs. When the Turkey Chicks were hatched, their mothers kept them out  of the Gobbler's way, because, you know, he did not like small children  and it was better that they should not meet.    The Hen Turkeys were very sorry for him, and often wished that he might  watch with them the growth of their piping darlings, to see the tiny  feathers push their way through the down and broaden and lengthen until  there was no down to be seen--only feathers. It was too bad; yet that  was the way in all Turkey families, and the Gobblers couldn't help  disliking the children any more than the Hen Turkeys could help wanting  to sit in the springtime.    By another year the Gobbler would love the young Turkeys dearly. Even  now he did not try to strike them, as he might have done a while before.  They were afraid of him, yet down in their hearts the brothers all  thought that when they were grown up they wanted to be just like him  and strut around with their wings trailing, their tails spread, their  necks drawn back, and their feathers ruffled. Then, they thought, when  other people came near them, they would puff and gobble and cry, \"Get  out of my way!\" They tried it once in a while to see how it would seem,  but they were still slender and their voices were not yet deep enough.  The sisters laughed at them when they did this, and that made them feel  very uncomfortable. The long, limp red wattles that grew out between  their eyes became redder and redder as they swung to and fro under their  short, thick bills.    \"Just wait,\" said one young fellow to another. \"Just you wait until I am  really grown up and strut before your sister next spring. I don't think  she will laugh at me then.\" And he comforted himself by eating fully  twice as much grain as he should have done.    The farmer's little girl came into the farmyard, and all the fowls  stopped eating to look at her. She was so young that she had never  before been out there alone. Her father had brought her in his arms, and  she had laughed with delight and clapped her little hands when the  farmyard people passed by her. Now she had slipped out of the house and  stood in the sunshine smiling at every one. She came without a cap, and  the wind blew her soft yellow curls around her rosy face. It fluttered  her red dress, too, and the Gobbler saw it and became exceedingly angry.    \"Red-red-red!\" he cried. \"Why in the world did she wear red? I hate it!\"  He stalked toward her in his most disagreeable way, and you could tell  by the stiff brushing of his wing-tips on the ground that he was very  angry. \"Get away from here!\" he cried. \"This is my home and little girls  can't wear red dresses when they visit me. Pffff! Get away!\"    The little girl turned to run as the big Gobbler came puffing toward  her. In her fright she stumbled and fell, and he hurried forward to  strike her. The Black Spanish Cock began to ruffle his neck feathers and  stretch his head forward. He did not mean to have their visitor treated  so. He ran between the Gobbler's feet and they tumbled over together.  The little girl picked herself up and hurried into the house.    If the Gobbler was angry before, he was much more so after his fall.  \"What do you mean, sir,\" he said, \"by tripping me?\"    \"And what do you mean,\" said the Black Spanish Cock, \"by knocking me  over?\"    \"Pffff! You were under my feet.\"    \"Erruuuu! You were over my head.\"    Now nobody had dared to disagree with the Gobbler in so long that he did  not know what to make of it, and when the Shanghai Cock strolled over  to help his friend, the Gobbler was fairly sputtering with rage. \"Ah,  Gobbler,\" said the Shanghai, \"wonder what has become of the little girl?  It was nice of her to come out here, and I wish she had stayed longer.\"    [Illustration: THE BIG GOBBLER CAME PUFFING TOWARD HER.]    \"I told her to get away,\" was the answer. \"She had on a red dress. I  chased her. I always have chased anybody who wore red, and I always  shall. It's my way.\"    \"Is it your way, too, to be cross whenever you feel like it?\"    \"Of course. I wouldn't be cross when I didn't feel like it,\" answered  the Gobbler.    \"Some of us are not cross when we do feel like it,\" said the Dorking  Cock. \"I am always happier for keeping my temper when I can.\"    \"Pffff!\" said the Gobbler. \"That is not my way. I say right out what I  think, and then I am all right again and forget all about it.\"    \"Humph!\" said the Bantam Hen. \"I wonder if the other people forget as  soon? It would do him more good to remember it and feel sorry. He needs  a lesson.\" Then she stalked up to him, looking as brave as you please,  although she was really quite frightened. \"I never noticed it before,\"  she cackled, \"but the tuft of hairy feathers on your breast is  dreadfully ragged. And what very ugly looking feet you have! If I were  going to have any webs between my toes I should want good big ones like  those of the Ducks and Geese, not snippy little halfway webs like yours.  I hope you don't mind my speaking of it. I always say what I think. It's  just my way, and I never remember it afterward.\" She gave a graceful  flutter and a queer little squawk, and was off before the Gobbler got  over his surprise.    Fowls do enjoy a joke, and now the Dorking Cock took his turn. \"I've  always wanted to know how you spread your tail in that fashion. It's a  good time to see.\" He walked up beside the Gobbler and pecked and pulled  until three feathers lay on the ground. \"Ah,\" said the Dorking Cock, \"I  see I loosened some of your tail feathers. I hope you don't mind. It is  just my way, when I want to know about anything, to find out as soon as  I can.\"   "]]]
