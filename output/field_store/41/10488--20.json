For the body of man is  accidental; it is of no importance. The time of its disintegration will  inevitably come. But the spirit of man is essential and, therefore,  eternal. It is a divine bounty. It is the effulgence of the Sun of Reality  and, therefore, of greater importance than the physical body.    I pray for you. You have come to visit me, and I am most grateful. I shall  ask confirmation and assistance for you from God, the Generous, the  Bestower, that you may be aided in serving the world of humanity.          25 April 1912  Message to Esperantists  Home of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur J. Parsons  1700 Eighteenth Street, NW, Washington, D.C.      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    Today the greatest need of the world of humanity is discontinuance of the  existing misunderstandings among nations. This can be accomplished through  the unity of language. Unless the unity of languages is realized, the Most  Great Peace and the oneness of the human world cannot be effectively  organized and established because the function of language is to portray  the mysteries and secrets of human hearts. The heart is like a box, and  language is the key. Only by using the key can we open the box and observe  the gems it contains. Therefore, the question of an auxiliary  international tongue has the utmost importance. Through this means  international education and training become possible; the evidence and  history of the past can be acquired. The spread of the known facts of the  human world depends upon language. The explanation of divine teachings can  only be through this medium. As long as diversity of tongues and lack of  comprehension of other languages continue, these glorious aims cannot be  realized. Therefore, the very first service to the world of man is to  establish this auxiliary international means of communication. It will  become the cause of the tranquillity of the human commonwealth. Through it  sciences and arts will be spread among the nations, and it will prove to  be the means of the progress and development of all races. We must  endeavor with all our powers to establish this international auxiliary  language throughout the world. It is my hope that it may be perfected  through the bounties of God and that intelligent men may be selected from  the various countries of the world to organize an international congress  whose chief aim will be the promotion of this universal medium of speech.          25 April 1912  Talk at Home of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur J. Parsons  1700 Eighteenth Street, NW, Washington, D.C.      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    In the world of existence the greatest bestowals of God are His teachings.  The other bounties of God are limited as regards their benefits and  provision. Human existence itself is a divine bestowal, but it is  circumscribed with limitations. Sight and hearing are bounties of God;  both are limited. And so it is with all the other bestowals; the circle of  their operation is confined, restricted, whereas the sphere of the divine  teachings is boundless. Centuries and ages pass away, but their efficacy  continues like the spirit of life which animates the world of existence.  Without the teachings of God the world of humanity is like the animal  kingdom. What difference is there between the animal and man? The  difference is this: that the animal is not capable of apprehending the  divine teachings, whereas man is worthy of them and possesses the capacity  to understand. In the animal kingdom there is no such bestowal; therefore,  there is limited progression. At most, evolution in that kingdom is a  development of the organism. In the beginning it is small, undeveloped; it  develops, becomes larger; but its sphere of intellectual growth is  limited. Therefore, the teachings of God are the bestowals specialized for  man.    Although the divine teachings are truth and reality, yet with the passage  of time thick clouds envelop and obscure them. These clouds are imitations  and superstitions; they are not the fundamentals. Then the Sun of Truth,  the Word of God, arises again, shines forth once more in the glory of its  power and disperses the enveloping darkness.    For a long time the divine precepts of the effulgent Word were obscured by  clouds of superstition and error until Baha'u'llah appeared upon the  horizon of humanity, rent the shadows, scattered the clouds and revealed  anew the foundations of the teachings of God.    The first teaching of Baha'u'llah is the duty incumbent upon all to  investigate reality. What does it mean to investigate reality? It means  that man must forget all hearsay and examine truth himself, for he does  not know whether statements he hears are in accordance with reality or  not. Wherever he finds truth or reality, he must hold to it, forsaking,  discarding all else; for outside of reality there is naught but  superstition and imagination. For example, during the days of Jesus Christ  the Jews were expecting the appearance of the Messiah, praying and  beseeching God day and night that the Promised One might appear. Why did  they reject Him when He did appear? They denied Him absolutely, refused to  believe in Him. There was no abuse and persecution which they did not heap  upon Him. They reviled Him with curses, placed a crown of thorns upon His  head, led Him through the streets in scorn and derision and finally  crucified Him. Why did they do this? Because they did not investigate the  truth or reality of Christ and were not able to recognize Him as the  Messiah of God. Had they investigated sincerely for themselves, they would  surely have believed in Him, respected Him and bowed before Him in  reverence. They would have considered His manifestation the greatest  bestowal upon mankind. They would have accepted Him as the very Savior of  man; but, alas, they were veiled, they held to imitations of ancestral  beliefs and hearsay and did not investigate the truth of Christ. They were  submerged in the sea of superstitions and were, therefore, deprived of  witnessing that glorious bounty; they were withheld from the fragrances or  breaths of the Holy Spirit and suffered in themselves the greatest  debasement and degradation.    Reality or truth is one, yet there are many religious beliefs,  denominations, creeds and differing opinions in the world today. Why  should these differences exist? Because they do not investigate and  examine the fundamental unity, which is one and unchangeable. If they seek  reality itself, they will agree and be united; for reality is indivisible  and not multiple. It is evident, therefore, that there is nothing of  greater importance to mankind than the investigation of truth.    The second teaching of Baha'u'llah is the oneness of the world of  humanity. Every human creature is the servant of God. All have been  created and reared by the power and favor of God; all have been blessed  with the bounties of the same Sun of divine truth; all have quaffed from  the fountain of the infinite mercy of God; and all in His estimation and  love are equal as servants. He is beneficent and kind to all. Therefore,  no one should glorify himself over another; no one should manifest pride  or superiority toward another; no one should look upon another with scorn  and contempt; and no one should deprive or oppress a fellow creature. All  must be considered as submerged in the ocean of God's mercy. We must  associate with all humanity in gentleness and kindliness. We must love all  with love of the heart. Some are ignorant; they must be trained and  educated. One is sick; he must be healed. Another is as a child; we must  assist him to attain maturity. We must not detest him who is ailing,  neither shun him, scorn nor curse him, but care for him with the utmost  kindness and tenderness. An infant must not be treated with disdain simply  because it is an infant. Our responsibility is to train, educate and  develop it in order that it may advance toward maturity.    The third teaching or principle of Baha'u'llah is that religion and  science are in complete agreement. Every religion which is not in  accordance with established science is superstition. Religion must be  reasonable. If it does not square with reason, it is superstition and  without foundation. It is like a mirage, which deceives man by leading him  to think it is a body of water. God has endowed man with reason that he  may perceive what is true. If we insist that such and such a subject is  not to be reasoned out and tested according to the established logical  modes of the intellect, what is the use of the reason which God has given  man? The eye is the organ of sense by which we view the world of outer  phenomena; hearing is the faculty for distinguishing sounds; taste senses  the properties of objects, such as bitter, sweet; smell detects and  differentiates odors; touch reveals attributes of matter and perfects our  communication with the outer world; yet after all, the circle and range of  perception by the five senses is exceedingly limited. But the intellectual  faculty of man is unlimited in its sphere of action. The eye views details  perhaps a mile, but the intellect can perceive the far East and West. The  ear may hear tone modulations at one thousand feet, but the mind of man  can detect the harmonies of the heavenly spheres as they swing in their  courses. Mind makes geological discoveries in subterranean depths and  determines the processes of creation in the earth's lowest strata. The  sciences and arts, all inventions, crafts, trades and their products have  come forth from the intellect of man. It is evident that within the human  organism the intellect occupies the supreme station. Therefore, if  religious belief, principle or creed is not in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19287"],[0,"Selections from the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá (#17)"],[1,"world, have been released from the chains of self and the  desires of the flesh, and anchored their hearts to the heavenly realms of  the Lord. These are of the Kingdom, heavenly; these are of God, spiritual;  these are revealers of God's abounding grace; these are dawning-points of  His spiritual bestowals.    O handmaid of God! Praise be to Him, thy dear husband hath perceived the  sweet scents that blow from the gardens of heaven. Now, as day followeth  day, must thou, through the love of God, and thine own good actions, draw  him ever closer to the Faith.    Those were indeed dire events in San Francisco.(29) Disasters of this kind  should serve to awaken the people, and diminish the love of their hearts  for this inconstant world. It is in this nether world that such tragic  things take place: this is the cup that yieldeth bitter wine.            40: O YE WHOM 'ABDU'L-BAHA LOVETH! I HAVE READ YOUR ...      O ye whom 'Abdu'l-Baha loveth! I have read your reports with great joy;  they are of a nature to cheer and refresh the heart and gladden the soul.  If this Assembly, through the holy breathings of the All-Merciful and His  divine confirmations, endure and remain fixed and firm, it shall produce  notable results and it shall succeed in enterprises of great moment.    The Spiritual Assemblies to be established in this Age of God, this holy  century, have, it is indisputable, had neither peer nor likeness in the  cycles gone before. For those assemblages that wielded power were based on  the support of mighty leaders of men, while these Assemblies are based on  the support of the Beauty of Abha. The defenders and patrons of those  other assemblages were either a prince, or a king, or a chief priest, or  the mass of the people. But these Spiritual Assemblies have for their  defender, their supporter, their helper, their inspirer, the omnipotent  Lord.    Look ye not upon the present, fix your gaze upon the times to come. In the  beginning, how small is the seed, yet in the end it is a mighty tree. Look  ye not upon the seed, look ye upon the tree, and its blossoms, and its  leaves and its fruits. Consider the days of Christ, when none but a small  band followed Him; then observe what a mighty tree that seed became,  behold ye its fruitage. And now shall come to pass even greater things  than these, for this is the summons of the Lord of Hosts, this is the  trumpet-call of the living Lord, this is the anthem of world peace, this  is the standard of righteousness and trust and understanding raised up  among all the variegated peoples of the globe; this is the splendour of  the Sun of Truth, this is the holiness of the spirit of God Himself. This  most powerful of dispensations will encompass all the earth, and beneath  its banner will all peoples gather and be sheltered together. Know then  the vital import of this tiny seed that the true Husbandman hath, with the  hands of His mercy, sown in the ploughed fields of the Lord, and watered  with the rain of bestowals and bounties and is now nurturing in the heat  and light of the Day-Star of Truth.    Wherefore, O ye loved ones of God, offer up thanks unto Him, since He hath  made you the object of such bounties, and the recipients of such gifts.  Blessed are ye, glad tidings to you, for this abounding grace.            41: O THOU WHO ART STEADFAST IN THE COVENANT, AND ...      O thou who art steadfast in the Covenant, and staunch! The letter which  thou didst write ... hath been shown to me, and the opinions expressed  therein were most commendable. It is incumbent upon the Spiritual  Consultative Assembly of New York to be in complete agreement with that of  Chicago, and for these two assemblies of consultation jointly to approve  whatever they consider suitable for publication and distribution.  Following that, let them send one copy to Akka, so that it may also be  approved from here, after which the material will be returned to be  published and circulated.    The question of co-ordinating and unifying the two Spiritual Assemblies,  that of Chicago and of New York, is of the utmost importance, and once a  Spiritual Assembly is duly formed in Washington, these two Assemblies  should also establish ties of unity with that Assembly. To sum it up, it  is the desire of the Lord God that the loved ones of God and the handmaids  of the Merciful in the West should come closer together in harmony and  unity as day followeth day, and until this is accomplished, the work will  never go forward. The Spiritual Assemblies are collectively the most  effective of all instruments for establishing unity and harmony. This  matter is of the utmost importance; this is the magnet that draweth down  the confirmations of God. If once the beauty of the unity of the  friends--this Divine Beloved--be decked in the adornments of the Abha  Kingdom, it is certain that within a very short time those countries will  become the Paradise of the All-Glorious, and that out of the west the  splendours of unity will cast their bright rays over all the earth.    We are striving with heart and soul, resting neither day nor night,  seeking not a moment's ease, to make this world of man the mirror of the  unity of God. Then how much more must the beloved of the Lord reflect that  unity? And this cherished hope, this yearning wish of ours will be visibly  fulfilled only on the day when the true friends of God arise to carry out  the Teachings of the Abha Beauty--may my life be a ransom for His lovers!  One amongst His Teachings is this, that love and good faith must so  dominate the human heart that men will regard the stranger as a familiar  friend, the malefactor as one of their own, the alien even as a loved one,  the enemy as a companion dear and close. Who killeth them, him will they  call a bestower of life; who turneth away from them, him will they regard  as turning towards them; who denieth their message, him will they consider  as one acknowledging its truth. The meaning is that they must treat all  humankind even as they treat their sympathizers, their fellow-believers,  their loved ones and familiar friends.    Should such a torch light up the world community, ye will find that the  whole earth is sending forth a fragrance, that it hath become a  delightsome paradise, and the face of it the image of high heaven. Then  will the whole world be one native land, its diverse peoples one single  kind, the nations of both east and west one household.    It is my hope that such a day will come, that such a splendour will shine  forth, that such a vision will be unveiled in its full beauty.            42: O YE CO-WORKERS WHO ARE SUPPORTED BY ARMIES ...      O ye co-workers who are supported by armies from the realm of the  All-Glorious! Blessed are ye, for ye have come together in the sheltering  shade of the Word of God, and have found a refuge in the cave of His  Covenant; ye have brought peace to your hearts by making your home in the  Abha Paradise, and are lulled by the gentle winds that blow from their  source in His loving-kindness; ye have arisen to serve the Cause of God  and to spread His religion far and wide, to promote His Word and to raise  high the banners of holiness throughout all those regions.    By the life of Baha! Verily will the consummate power of the Divine  Reality breathe into you the bounties of the Holy Spirit, and aid you to  perform an exploit whose like the eye of creation hath never looked upon.    O ye League of the Covenant! Verily the Abha Beauty made a promise to the  beloved who are steadfast in the Covenant, that He would reinforce their  strivings with the strongest of supports, and succour them with His  triumphant might. Erelong shall ye see that your illumined assemblage hath  left conspicuous signs and tokens in the hearts and souls of men. Hold ye  fast to the hem of God's garment, and direct all your efforts toward  furthering His Covenant, and burning ever more brightly with the fire of  His love, that your hearts may leap for joy in the breathings of servitude  which well out from the breast of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Rally your hearts, make  firm your steps, trust in the everlasting bounties that will be shed upon  you, one following another from the Kingdom of Abha. Whensoever ye gather  in that radiant assemblage, know ye that the splendours of Baha are  shining over you. It behoveth you to seek agreement and to be united; it  behoveth you to be in close communion one with the other, at one both in  body and soul, till ye match the Pleiades or a string of lustrous pearls.  Thus will ye be solidly established; thus will your words prevail, your  star shine out, and your hearts be comforted....    Whenever ye enter the council-chamber, recite this prayer with a heart  throbbing with the love of God and a tongue purified from all but His  remembrance, that the All-Powerful may graciously aid you to achieve  supreme victory:    O God, my God! We are servants of Thine that have turned with devotion to  Thy Holy Face, that have detached ourselves from all besides Thee in this  glorious Day. We have gathered in this Spiritual Assembly, united in our  views and thoughts, with our purposes harmonized to exalt Thy Word amidst  mankind. O Lord, our God! Make us the signs of Thy Divine Guidance, the  Standards of Thine exalted Faith amongst men, servants to Thy mighty  Covenant, O Thou our Lord Most High, manifestations of Thy Divine Unity in  Thine Abha Kingdom, and resplendent stars shining upon all regions. Lord!  Aid us to become seas surging with the billows of Thy wondrous Grace,  streams flowing from Thine all-glorious Heights, goodly fruits upon the  Tree of Thy heavenly Cause, trees waving through the breezes of Thy Bounty  in Thy celestial Vineyard. O God! Make our souls dependent upon the Verses  of Thy Divine Unity, our hearts cheered with the outpourings of Thy Grace,  that we may unite even as the waves of one sea and become merged together  as the"]]]
