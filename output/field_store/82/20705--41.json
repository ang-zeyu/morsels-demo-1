Or is it a mere savage invention, surviving (like  certain other features of the Greek mysteries) from a distant stage of  savagery?  Our answer to all these questions is that in all probability  the presence of the [Greek], or bull-roarer, in Greek mysteries was a  survival from the time when Greeks were in the social condition of  Australians.    In the first place, the bull-roarer is associated with mysteries and  initiations.  Now mysteries and initiations are things that tend to  dwindle and to lose their characteristic features as civilisation  advances.  The rites of baptism and confirmation are not secret and  hidden; they are common to both sexes, they are publicly performed, and  religion and morality of the purest sort blend in these ceremonies.  There  are no other initiations or mysteries that civilised modern man is  expected necessarily to pass through.  On the other hand, looking widely  at human history, we find mystic rites and initiations numerous,  stringent, severe, and magical in character, in proportion to the lack of  civilisation in those who practise them.  The less the civilisation, the  more mysterious and the more cruel are the rites.  The more cruel the  rites, the less is the civilisation.  The red-hot poker with which Mr.  Bouncer terrified Mr. Verdant Green at the sham masonic rites would have  been quite in place, a natural instrument of probationary torture, in the  Freemasonry of Australians, Mandans, or Hottentots.  In the mysteries of  Demeter or Bacchus, in the mysteries of a civilised people, the red-hot  poker, or any other instrument of torture, would have been out of place.  But in the Greek mysteries, just as in those of South Africans, Red  Indians, and Australians, the disgusting practice of bedaubing the  neophyte with dirt and clay was preserved.  We have nothing quite like  that in modern initiations.  Except at Sparta, Greeks dropped the  tortures inflicted on boys and girls in the initiations superintended by  the cruel Artemis. {33}  But Greek mysteries retained the daubing with  mud and the use of the bull-roarer.  On the whole, then, and on a general  view of the subject, we prefer to think that the bull-roarer in Greece  was a survival from savage mysteries, not that the bull-roarer in New  Mexico, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa is a relic of  civilisation.    Let us next observe a remarkable peculiarity of the turndun, or  Australian bull-roarer.  The bull-roarer in England is a toy.  In  Australia, according to Howitt and Fison, {34} the bull-roarer is  regarded with religious awe.  'When, on lately meeting with two of the  surviving Kurnai, I spoke to them of the turndun, they first looked  cautiously round them to see that no one else was looking, and then  answered me in undertones.'  The chief peculiarity in connection with the  turndun is that women may never look upon it.  The Chepara tribe, who  call it bribbun, have a custom that, 'if seen by a woman, or shown by a  man to a woman, the punishment to both is _death_.'    Among the Kurnai, the sacred mystery of the turndun is preserved by a  legend, which gives a supernatural sanction to secrecy.  When boys go  through the mystic ceremony of initiation they are shown turnduns, or  bull-roarers, and made to listen to their hideous din.  They are then  told that, if ever a woman is allowed to see a turndun, the earth will  open, and water will cover the globe.  The old men point spears at the  boy's eyes, saying: 'If you tell this to any woman you will die, you will  see the ground broken up and like the sea; if you tell this to any woman,  or to any child, you will be killed!'  As in Athens, in Syria, and among  the Mandans, the deluge-tradition of Australia is connected with the  mysteries.  In Gippsland there is a tradition of the deluge.  'Some  children of the Kurnai in playing about found a turndun, which they took  home to the camp and showed the women.  Immediately the earth crumbled  away, and it was all water, and the Kurnai were drowned.'    In consequence of all this mummery the Australian women attach great  sacredness to the very name of the turndun.  They are much less  instructed in their own theology than the men of the tribe.  One woman  believed she had heard Pundjel, the chief supernatural being, descend in  a mighty rushing noise, that is, in the sound of the turndun, when boys  were being 'made men,' or initiated. {35}  On turnduns the Australian  sorcerers can fly up to heaven.  Turnduns carved with imitations of water-  flowers are used by medicine-men in rain-making.  New Zealand also has  her bull-roarers; some of them, carved in relief, are in the Christy  Museum, and one is engraved here.  I have no direct evidence as to the  use of these Maori bull-roarers in the Maori mysteries.  Their  employment, however, may perhaps be provisionally inferred.    One can readily believe that the New Zealand bull-roarer may be whirled  by any man who is repeating a Karakia, or 'charm to raise the wind':--       Loud wind,     Lasting wind,     Violent whistling wind,     Dig up the calm reposing sky,        Come, come.    In New Zealand {36a} 'the natives regarded the wind as an indication of  the presence of their god,' a superstition not peculiar to Maori  religion.  The 'cold wind' felt blowing over the hands at spiritualistic  seances is also regarded (by psychical researchers) as an indication of  the presence of supernatural beings.  The windy roaring noise made by the  bull-roarer might readily be considered by savages, either as an  invitation to a god who should present himself in storm, or as a proof of  his being at hand.  We have seen that this view was actually taken by an  Australian woman.  The hymn called 'breath,' or haha, a hymn to the  mystic wind, is pronounced by Maori priests at the moment of the  initiation of young men in the tribal mysteries.  It is a mere  conjecture, and possibly enough capable of disproof, but we have a  suspicion that the use of the mystica vannus Iacchi was a mode of raising  a sacred wind analogous to that employed by whirlers of the turndun.  {36b}    Servius, the ancient commentator on Virgil, mentions, among other  opinions, this--that the vannus was a sieve, and that it symbolised the  purifying effect of the mysteries.  But it is clear that Servius was only  guessing; and he offers other explanations, among them that the vannus  was a crate to hold offerings, primitias frugum.    We have studied the bull-roarer in Australia, we have caught a glimpse of  it in England.  Its existence on the American continent is proved by  letters from New Mexico, and by a passage in Mr. Frank Cushing's  'Adventures in Zuni.' {37}  In Zuni, too, among a semi-civilised Indian  tribe, or rather a tribe which has left the savage for the barbaric  condition, we find the bull-roarer.  Here, too, the instrument--a 'slat,'  Mr. Gushing calls it--is used as a call to the ceremonial observance of  the tribal ritual.  The Zunis have various 'orders of a more or less  sacred and sacerdotal character.'  Mr. Cushing writes:--       These orders were engaged in their annual ceremonials, of which little     was told or shown me; but, at the end of four days, I heard one     morning a _deep whirring noise_.  Running out, I saw a procession of     three priests of the bow, in plumed helmets and closely-fitting     cuirasses, both of thick buckskin--gorgeous and solemn with sacred     embroideries and war-paint, begirt with bows, arrows, and war-clubs,     and each distinguished by his badge of degree--coming down one of the     narrow streets.  The principal priest carried in his arms a wooden     idol, ferocious in aspect, yet beautiful with its decorations of     shell, turquoise, and brilliant paint.  It was nearly hidden by     symbolic slats and prayer-sticks most elaborately plumed.  He was     preceded by a guardian with drawn bow and arrows, while another     followed, _twirling the sounding slat_, which had attracted alike my     attention and that of hundreds of the Indians, who hurriedly flocked     to the roofs of the adjacent houses, or lined the street, bowing their     heads in adoration, and scattering sacred prayer-meal on the god and     his attendant priests.  Slowly they wound their way down the hill,     across the river, and off toward the mountain of Thunder.  Soon an     identical procession followed and took its way toward the western     hills.  I watched them long until they disappeared, and a few hours     afterward there arose from the top of 'Thunder Mountain' a dense     column of smoke, simultaneously with another from the more distant     western mesa of 'U-ha-na-mi,' or 'Mount of the Beloved.'       Then they told me that for four days I must neither touch nor eat     flesh or oil of any kind, and for ten days neither throw any refuse     from my doors, nor permit a spark to leave my house, for 'This was the     season of the year when the \"grandmother of men\" (fire) was precious.'    Here then, in Zuni, we have the bull-roarer again, and once more we find  it employed as a summons to the mysteries.  We do not learn, however,  that women in Zuni are forbidden to look upon the bull-roarer.  Finally,  the South African evidence, which is supplied by letters from a  correspondent of Mr. Tylor's, proves that in South Africa, too, the bull-  roarer is employed to call the men to the celebration of secret  functions.  A minute description of the instrument, and of its magical  power to raise a wind, is given in Theal's 'Kaffir Folklore,' p. 209.  The  bull-roarer has not been made a subject of particular research; very  probably later investigations will find it in other parts of the modern  world besides America, Africa, New Zealand, and Australia.

Wilson Co.]    The young person who would learn to write a good business letter,  should, with pen, ink and suitable paper, sit down and practice  faithfully after the above model. Write and re-write it a dozen times  or more, until your letter resembles it closely. Then take any of the  models for letters given near the close of this chapter, and with this  matter, write a letter which will conform with the foregoing model in  appearance and dress. Write the same matter over again, and improve  it in its defects. Criticise each line and word. See that no words  or letters are omitted, and that the punctuation is according to  the models in this book. Eliminate all ungainly letters, shorten the  loops, see that each letter rests on the line, and that, withal your  page is clean and regular.    The person who will thus devote a little earnest study and practice,  may early acquire the valuable accomplishment of writing a pleasing  business letter, so far as the mechanical structure goes.      ADDRESSING THE ENVELOPE.    After the letter is finished, and while it yet lies open before you,  the Envelope should be addressed. As before stated, the directions  on the envelope must conform to the address at the beginning of the  letter, hence the necessity for addressing the envelope before the  letter is folded.    The first line of the address of the envelope should consist of the name  of the person or firm to whom the letter is written, together with any  appropriate titles, and should be written across or a little below the  middle of the envelope, but never above it, beginning near the left  edge. The space between this first line and the bottom of the envelope  should be about equally divided among the other lines, each of which  begins still farther to the right than the one above, thus:    [Illustration:          Messrs. Arnold, Constable & Co.,          Cor. Broadway & 19th Sts.,            New York City.]    When writing to a person in a large city the number and street should  be a part of the address, and may be placed as in the above form, or  in the left hand lower corner as follows:    [Illustration:            Lewis H. Taylor, Esq.,              Chicago,          118 Wabash Ave.     Ill.]    In case the letter is addressed in care of any one this should be  placed in the lower left corner. If a letter of introduction, the  words _Introducing Mr. John Smith,_ or similar words, should be placed  in this corner.    Letters addressed to small towns or villages should bear the name of  the county as follows:    [Illustration:          Mr. Henry D. Chambers,          Washington,            Porter County,                      Ala.]    Or the name of the county may be placed in the lower left corner. The  Post Office box number is usually placed in the lower left corner.      FOLDING A LETTER.    Having written an excellent letter, and faultlessly addressed the  envelope, all may be easily stamped as unbusiness-like, and spoiled,  by improperly performing so simple a part as the folding. Remember  that excellent rule that, whatever is worth doing should be well done.    With the letter sheet lying before you, turn the bottom edge up  so that it lies along with the top edge, thus making a fold in the  middle, which press down with the thumb nail or with a paper folder.  Then fold the right edge over so that it falls two-thirds the distance  across the sheet, and press down the edge. Next fold the left edge of  the sheet over to the right, breaking the fold at the edge of the part  folded over just before.    In case a check, note, draft, bill or currency is to be sent by  letter, it should be placed on the upper half of the sheet as it lies  open, and then the letter should be folded the same as if it were not  there. This will fold the paper or document in the letter so that it  will be difficult to extract it while being transmitted in the mails,  and so that it will not be dropped or lost in opening the letter.    The letter is now folded so that it will be of equal thickness in  every part of the envelope. Insert the last broken or folded edge in  the envelope first, with original edges of the sheet at the end of  the envelope which the stamp is on; when taken from the envelope the  letter will then be proper side up.      THE LITERATURE OF A LETTER.    To be able to compose a letter requires more ability than to give it  the proper arrangement and mechanical dress. A mind well stored with  useful knowledge as well as command of language, is necessary in  writing a letter on general subjects. The strictly business letter  requires a thorough understanding of the facts concerning which  the letter is written, and these facts to be set forth in plain and  unmistakable language. All display of rhetoric or flourish of words is  entirely out of place in the sober, practical letter of business. The  proper use of capital letters, punctuation, and correct spelling  are essential to the well written letter, and with a little care and  striving may be easily acquired.      ARRANGEMENT OF ITEMS.    As stated before, each item or subject in a letter should be embraced  in a separate paragraph. These should be arranged in the order in  which they would naturally come, either in point of time, importance,  or as regards policy. Never begin a letter abruptly with a complaint,  but rather bring in all unpleasant subjects toward the close. If  an answer to a letter of inquiry, take up the questions as they are  asked, indicate first what the question is, and then state clearly  the answer. The first paragraph should acknowledge the receipt of  the communication now to be answered, giving date and indicating its  nature and contents, thus:    [Illustration: Your letter of the 10th instant concerning damaged  goods is received, etc.]    The closing paragraph usually begins with such words as _Hoping,  Trusting, Awaiting, Thanking_, or similar expressions, and is  complimentary in its tone and designed as a courtesy.      BREVITY.    Business letters should be brief and to the point. The best letter  states clearly all the facts in the fewest words. Brevity is not  inconsistent with a long letter, as so much may need to be said as  to require a long letter, but all repetitions, lengthy statements and  multiplication of words should be avoided. Use short sentences, and  make every word mean something. Short sentences are more forcible, and  more easily understood or remembered, than long drawn out utterances.      STYLE.    Style refers to the tone, air, or manner of expression. Dignity and  strength should characterize the style of the business letter. No  ornament of expression or eloquence of language is necessary or  appropriate in a correspondence between business men. Come to your  meaning at once. State the facts. Let every sentence bristle with  points.    The successful business man must possess energy, decision, and force,  and these qualities should be conspicuous in his correspondence in  order to command respect. Never use loose or slang expressions.  The business man should be a _gentleman_. Indulge in no display  of superior knowledge or education, but temper each paragraph with  respect and deference to others. The learner who would aspire to write  a good letter, should, after having finished his attempt, go over  each sentence carefully and wherever the pronoun I occurs, modify the  expression so as to leave this out.      ORDERING GOODS.    In ordering goods of any kind, care should be used to state very  explicitly the color, size, quality, and quantity of the articles  desired. If manufactured goods, the name of the manufacturer, or his  trade mark or brand should be given. Also state when you desire the  goods shipped and in what way. If by freight or express, state what  Freight line or Express Company.      SENDING MONEY BY LETTER.    Paper currency should seldom be trusted to pass through the mails, as  the liability to loss is too great. Better send draft or P. O. money  order, and in every case the amount of the remittance should be stated  in the letter, and also whether by draft or otherwise sent. The letter  may become important evidence in regard to payment at some future  time.      INSTRUCTIONS.    In giving instructions to agents, manufacturers and others, let each  order occupy a separate paragraph. State in unmistakable language the  instructions desired to be conveyed. If possible a diagram or plan  should be enclosed in the letter. Cautions and complaints, if any,  should be clearly set forth in paragraphs near the close of the  letter.      A DUNNING LETTER.    State when the debt was contracted, its amount, the fact of it having  been long past due, the necessity for immediate payment, and any other  facts depending on the peculiarities of the case, which it may seem best  to make use of, such as promises to pay, which have not been met;  the inconvenience as well as injury and distrust caused by such  irregularities, etc.      LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION.    Be just and truthful, avoiding any stereotyped form in letters of  introduction. Never give a letter of introduction unless you have  entire confidence in the person to whom it is given; it may reflect  on your character or be used against you. Be very guarded that no  expressions may be construed into a letter of credit, thus making the  writer liable for payment. Use no unfounded statements or assertions,  over-estimating your friend, as these may prove untrue.    Willing to extend a favor to a friend by giving a letter of  introduction, do not be guilty of "]]]
