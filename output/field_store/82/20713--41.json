But at those lonely posts, distant a month to three months' march  from the capital, the cruelties still continue. I did not see them.  Neither, last year, did a great many people in the United States see  the massacre of blacks in Atlanta. But they have reason to believe  it occurred. And after one has talked with the men and women who  have seen the atrocities, has seen in the official reports that  those accused of the atrocities do not deny having committed them,  but point out that they were merely obeying orders, and after one  has seen that even at the capital of Boma all the conditions of  slavery exist, one is assured that in the jungle, away from the  sight of men, all things are possible. Merchants, missionaries, and  officials even in Leopold's service told me that if one could spare  a year and a half, or a year, to the work in the hinterland he would  be an eye-witness of as cruel treatment of the natives as any that  has gone before, and if I can trust myself to weigh testimony and  can believe my eyes and ears I have reason to know that what they  say is true. I am convinced that to-day a man, who feels that a year  and a half is little enough to give to the aid of twenty millions of  human beings, can accomplish in the Congo as great and good work as  that of the Abolitionists.    Three years ago atrocities here were open and above-board. For  instance. In the opinion of the State the soldiers, in killing game  for food, wasted the State cartridges, and in consequence the  soldiers, to show their officers that they did not expend the  cartridges extravagantly on antelope and wild boar, for each empty  cartridge brought in a human hand, the hand of a man, woman, or  child. These hands, drying in the sun, could be seen at the posts  along the river. They are no longer in evidence. Neither is the  flower-bed of Lieutenant Dom, which was bordered with human skulls.  A quaint conceit.    The man to blame for the atrocities, for each separate atrocity, is  Leopold. Had he shaken his head they would have ceased. When the hue  and cry in Europe grew too hot for him and he held up his hand they  did cease. At least along the main waterways. Years before he could  have stopped them. But these were the seven fallow years, when  millions of tons of red rubber were being dumped upon the wharf at  Antwerp; little, roughly rolled red balls, like pellets of  coagulated blood, which had cost their weight in blood, which would  pay Leopold their weight in gold.    He can not plead ignorance. Of all that goes on in his big  plantation no man has a better knowledge. Without their personal  honesty, he follows every detail of the \"business\" of his rubber  farm with the same diligence that made rich men of George Boldt and  Marshall Field. Leopold's knowledge is gained through many spies, by  voluminous reports, by following up the expenditure of each centime,  of each arm's-length of blue cloth. Of every Belgian employed on  his farm, and ninety-five per cent. are Belgians, he holds the  _dossier_; he knows how many kilos a month the agent whips out of  his villages, how many bottles of absinthe he smuggles from the  French side, whether he lives with one black woman or five, why his  white wife in Belgium left him, why he left Belgium, why he dare not  return. The agent knows that Leopold, King of the Belgians, knows,  and that he has shared that knowledge with the agent's employer, the  man who by bribes of rich bonuses incites him to crime, the man who  could throw him into a Belgian jail, Leopold, King of the Congo.    The agent decides for him it is best to please both Leopolds, and  Leopold makes no secret of what best pleases him. For not only is he  responsible for the atrocities, in that he does not try to suppress  them, but he is doubly guilty in that he has encouraged them. This  he has done with cynical, callous publicity, without effort at  concealment, without shame. Men who, in obtaining rubber, committed  unspeakable crimes, the memory of which makes other men  uncomfortable in their presence, Leopold rewarded with rich  bonuses, pensions, higher office, gilt badges of shame, and rapid  advancement. To those whom even his own judges sentenced to many  years' imprisonment he promptly granted the royal pardon, promoted,  and sent back to work in the vineyard.    \"That is the sort of man for _me_,\" his action seemed to say. \"See  how I value that good and faithful servant. That man collected much  rubber. You observe I do not ask how he got it. I will not ask you.  All you need do is to collect rubber. Use our improved methods. Gum  copal rubbed in the kinky hair of the chief and then set on fire  burns, so my agents tell me, like vitriol. For collecting rubber the  chief is no longer valuable, but to his successor it is an  object-lesson. Let me recommend also the _chicotte_, the torture  tower, the 'hostage' house, and the crucifix. Many other stimulants  to labor will no doubt suggest themselves to you and to your  cannibal 'sentries.' Help to make me rich, and don't fear the  'State.' '_L'Etat, c'est moi!_' Go as far as you like!\"    I said the degradations and tortures practised by the men \"working  on commission\" for Leopold are unprintable, but they have been  printed, and those who wish to read a calmly compiled, careful, and  correct record of their deeds will find it in the \"Red Rubber\" of  Mr. E.R. Morel. An even better book by the same authority, on the  whole history of the State, is his \"King Leopold's Rule in the  Congo.\" Mr. Morel has many enemies. So, early in the nineteenth  century, had the English Abolitionists, Wilberforce and Granville  Sharp. After they were dead they were buried in the Abbey, and their  portraits were placed in the National Gallery. People who wish to  assist in freeing twenty millions of human beings should to-day  support Mr. Morel. It will be of more service to the blacks than,  after he is dead, burying him in Westminster Abbey.    Mr. Morel, the American and English missionaries, and the English  Consul, Roger Casement, and other men, in Belgium, have made a  magnificent fight against Leopold; but the Powers to whom they have  appealed have been silent. Taking courage of this silence, Leopold  has divided the Congo into several great territories in which the  sole right to work rubber is conceded to certain persons. To those  who protested that no one in the Congo \"Free\" State but the King  could trade in rubber, Leopold, as an answer, pointed with pride at  the preserves of these foreigners. And he may well point at them  with pride, for in some of those companies he owns a third, and in  most of them he holds a half, or a controlling interest. The  directors of the foreign companies are his cronies, members of his  royal household, his brokers, bankers. You have only to read the  names published in the lists of the Brussels Stock Exchange to see  that these \"trading companies,\" under different aliases, are  Leopold. Having, then, \"conceded\" the greater part of the Congo to  himself, Leopold set aside the best part of it, so far as rubber is  concerned, as a _Domaine Prive_. Officially the receipts of this pay  for running the government, and for schools, roads and wharfs, for  which taxes were levied, but for which, after twenty years, one  looks in vain. Leopold claims that through the Congo he is out of  pocket; that this carrying the banner of civilization in Africa  does not pay. Through his press bureaus he tells that his sympathy  for his black brother, his desire to see the commerce of the world  busy along the Congo, alone prevents him giving up what is for him a  losing business. There are several answers to this. One is that in  the Kasai Company alone Leopold owns 2,010 shares of stock. Worth  originally $50 a share, the value of each share rose to $3,100,  making at one time his total shares worth $5,421,000. In the  A.B.I.R. Concession he owns 1,000 shares, originally worth $100  each, later worth $940. In the \"vintage year\" of 1900 each of these  shares was worth $5,050, and the 1,000 shares thus rose to the value  of $5,050,000.    These are only two companies. In most of the others half the shares  are owned by the King.    As published in the \"State Bulletin,\" the money received in eight  years for rubber and ivory gathered in the _Domaine Prive_ differs  from the amount given for it in the market at Antwerp. The official  estimates show a loss to the government. The actual sales show that  the government, over and above its own estimate of its expenses,  instead of losing, made from the _Domaine Prive_ alone $10,000,000.  We are left wondering to whom went that unaccounted-for $10,000,000.  Certainly the King would not take it, for, to reimburse himself for  his efforts, he early in the game reserved for himself another tract  of territory known as the _Domaine de la Couronne_. For years he  denied that this existed. He knew nothing of Crown Lands. But, at  last, in the Belgian Chamber, it was publicly charged that for years  from this private source, which he had said did not exist, Leopold  had been drawing an income of $15,000,000. Since then the truth of  this statement has been denied, but at the time in the Chamber it  was not contradicted.    To-day, grown insolent by the apathy of the Powers, Leopold finds  disguising himself as a company, as a laborer worthy of his hire,  irksome. He now decrees that as \"Sovereign\" over the Congo all of  the Congo belongs to him. It is as much his property as is a  pheasant drive, as is a staked-out mining claim, as your hat is your  property. And the twenty millions of people who inhabit it are there  only on his sufferance. They are his \"tenants.\" He permits each  the hut in which he lives, and the garden adjoining that hut, but  his work must be for Leopold, and everything else, animal, mineral,  or vegetable, belongs to Leopold. The natives not only may "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1430"],[0,"Beautiful Stories from Shakespeare (#6)"],[1,"that his name was Doricles, and that he  was a private gentleman; and then, being deeply in love with the pretty  Perdita, he came almost daily to see her.    The King could not understand what it was that took his son nearly every  day from home; so he set people to watch him, and then found out that  the heir of the King of Bohemia was in love with Perdita, the pretty  shepherd girl. Polixenes, wishing to see whether this was true,  disguised himself, and went with the faithful Camillo, in disguise  too, to the old shepherd's house. They arrived at the feast of  sheep-shearing, and, though strangers, they were made very welcome.  There was dancing going on, and a peddler was selling ribbons and laces  and gloves, which the young men bought for their sweethearts.    Florizel and Perdita, however, were taking no part in this gay scene,  but sat quietly together talking. The King noticed the charming manners  and great beauty of Perdita, never guessing that she was the daughter of  his old friend, Leontes. He said to Camillo--    \"This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever ran on the green  sward. Nothing she does or seems but smacks of something greater than  herself--too noble for this place.\"    And Camillo answered, \"In truth she is the Queen of curds and cream.\"    But when Florizel, who did not recognize his father, called upon the  strangers to witness his betrothal with the pretty shepherdess, the King  made himself known and forbade the marriage, adding that if ever she saw  Florizel again, he would kill her and her old father, the shepherd; and  with that he left them. But Camillo remained behind, for he was charmed  with Perdita, and wished to befriend her.    Camillo had long known how sorry Leontes was for that foolish madness of  his, and he longed to go back to Sicily to see his old master. He now  proposed that the young people should go there and claim the protection  of Leontes. So they went, and the shepherd went with them, taking  Perdita's jewels, her baby clothes, and the paper he had found pinned to  her cloak.    Leontes received them with great kindness. He was very polite to Prince  Florizel, but all his looks were for Perdita. He saw how much she was  like the Queen Hermione, and said again and again--    \"Such a sweet creature my daughter might have been, if I had not cruelly  sent her from me.\"    When the old shepherd heard that the King had lost a baby daughter, who  had been left upon the coast of Bohemia, he felt sure that Perdita, the  child he had reared, must be the King's daughter, and when he told  his tale and showed the jewels and the paper, the King perceived that  Perdita was indeed his long-lost child. He welcomed her with joy, and  rewarded the good shepherd.    Polixenes had hastened after his son to prevent his marriage with  Perdita, but when he found that she was the daughter of his old friend,  he was only too glad to give his consent.    Yet Leontes could not be happy. He remembered how his fair Queen,  who should have been at his side to share his joy in his daughter's  happiness, was dead through his unkindness, and he could say nothing for  a long time but--    \"Oh, thy mother! thy mother!\" and ask forgiveness of the King of  Bohemia, and then kiss his daughter again, and then the Prince Florizel,  and then thank the old shepherd for all his goodness.    Then Paulina, who had been high all these years in the King's favor,  because of her kindness to the dead Queen Hermione, said--\"I have a  statue made in the likeness of the dead Queen, a piece many years in  doing, and performed by the rare Italian master, Giulio Romano. I keep  it in a private house apart, and there, ever since you lost your Queen,  I have gone twice or thrice a day. Will it please your Majesty to go and  see the statue?\"    So Leontes and Polixenes, and Florizel and Perdita, with Camillo and  their attendants, went to Paulina's house where there was a heavy purple  curtain screening off an alcove; and Paulina, with her hand on the  curtain, said--    \"She was peerless when she was alive, and I do believe that her dead  likeness excels whatever yet you have looked upon, or that the hand  of man hath done. Therefore I keep it lonely, apart. But here it  is--behold, and say, 'tis well.\"    And with that she drew back the curtain and showed them the statue. The  King gazed and gazed on the beautiful statue of his dead wife, but said  nothing.    \"I like your silence,\" said Paulina; \"it the more shows off your wonder.  But speak, is it not like her?\"    \"It is almost herself,\" said the King, \"and yet, Paulina, Hermione was  not so much wrinkled, nothing so old as this seems.\"    \"Oh, not by much,\" said Polixenes.    \"Al,\" said Paulina, \"that is the cleverness of the carver, who shows her  to us as she would have been had she lived till now.\"    And still Leontes looked at the statue and could not take his eyes away.    \"If I had known,\" said Paulina, \"that this poor image would so have  stirred your grief, and love, I would not have shown it to you.\"    But he only answered, \"Do not draw the curtain.\"    \"No, you must not look any longer,\" said Paulina, \"or you will think it  moves.\"    \"Let be! let be!\" said the King. \"Would you not think it breathed?\"    \"I will draw the curtain,\" said Paulina; \"you will think it lives  presently.\"    \"Ah, sweet Paulina,\" said Leontes, \"make me to think so twenty years  together.\"    \"If you can bear it,\" said Paulina, \"I can make the statue move, make  it come down and take you by the hand. Only you would think it was by  wicked magic.\"    \"Whatever you can make her do, I am content to look on,\" said the King.    And then, all folks there admiring and beholding, the statue moved from  its pedestal, and came down the steps and put its arms round the King's  neck, and he held her face and kissed her many times, for this was  no statue, but the real living Queen Hermione herself. She had lived  hidden, by Paulina's kindness, all these years, and would not discover  herself to her husband, though she knew he had repented, because she  could not quite forgive him till she knew what had become of her little  baby.    Now that Perdita was found, she forgave her husband everything, and it  was like a new and beautiful marriage to them, to be together once more.    Florizel and Perdita were married and lived long and happily.    To Leontes his many years of suffering were well paid for in the moment  when, after long grief and pain, he felt the arms of his true love  around him once again.          KING LEAR        King Lear was old and tired. He was aweary of the business of his  kingdom, and wished only to end his days quietly near his three  daughters. Two of his daughters were married to the Dukes of Albany  and Cornwall; and the Duke of Burgundy and the King of France were both  suitors for the hand of Cordelia, his youngest daughter.    Lear called his three daughters together, and told them that he proposed  to divide his kingdom between them. \"But first,\" said he, \"I should like  to know much you love me.\"    Goneril, who was really a very wicked woman, and did not love her father  at all, said she loved him more than words could say; she loved him  dearer than eyesight, space or liberty, more than life, grace, health,  beauty, and honor.    \"I love you as much as my sister and more,\" professed Regan, \"since I  care for nothing but my father's love.\"    Lear was very much pleased with Regan's professions, and turned to his  youngest daughter, Cordelia. \"Now, our joy, though last not least,\" he  said, \"the best part of my kingdom have I kept for you. What can you  say?\"    \"Nothing, my lord,\" answered Cordelia.    \"Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again,\" said the King.    And Cordelia answered, \"I love your Majesty according to my duty--no  more, no less.\"    And this she said, because she was disgusted with the way in which her  sisters professed love, when really they had not even a right sense of  duty to their old father.    \"I am your daughter,\" she went on, \"and you have brought me up and loved  me, and I return you those duties back as are right and fit, obey you,  love you, and most honor you.\"    Lear, who loved Cordelia best, had wished her to make more extravagant  professions of love than her sisters. \"Go,\" he said, \"be for ever a  stranger to my heart and me.\"    The Earl of Kent, one of Lear's favorite courtiers and captains, tried  to say a word for Cordelia's sake, but Lear would not listen. He divided  the kingdom between Goneril and Regan, and told them that he should only  keep a hundred knights at arms, and would live with his daughters by  turns.    When the Duke of Burgundy knew that Cordelia would have no share of the  kingdom, he gave up his courtship of her. But the King of France was  wiser, and said, \"Thy dowerless daughter, King, is Queen of us--of ours,  and our fair France.\"    \"Take her, take her,\" said the King; \"for I will never see that face of  hers again.\"    So Cordelia became Queen of France, and the Earl of Kent, for having  ventured to take her part, was banished from the kingdom. The King now  went to stay with his daughter Goneril, who had got everything from her  father that he had to give, and now began to grudge even the hundred  knights that he had reserved for himself. She was harsh and undutiful  to him, and her servants either refused to obey his orders or pretended  that they did not hear them.    Now the Earl of Kent, when he was banished, made as though he would  go into another country, but instead he came back in the disguise of  a servingman and took service with the King. The King had now two  friends--the Earl of Kent, whom he only knew as his servant, and his  Fool, who was faithful to him. Goneril told her father plainly that his  knights only served to fill her Court with riot and feasting; and so she  begged him only to keep a few old men about him such as himself.    \"My train are men who "]]]
