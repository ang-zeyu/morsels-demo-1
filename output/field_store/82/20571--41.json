He replied yes, by reason that (upon the time of his tryall) he  had taken a vow and protestation, wishing God to punish him, body and  soul, if ever he appeared on the scaffold to do the act, or lift up his  hand against him. He likewise confessed that he had 30_l_. for his  pains, all paid him in half-crowns within an hour after the blow was  given; and he had an orange stuck full with cloves, and a handkircher  out of the King's pocket, so soon as he was carried off the scaffold;  for which orange he was proffered twenty shillings by a gentleman in  Whitechapel, but refused the same, and afterwards sold it for ten  shillings in Rosemary Lane. About eight o'clock at night he returned  home to his wife, living in Rosemary Lane, and gave her the money,  saying, it was the dearest money, he earned in his life, for it would  cost him his life. About three days before he died, he lay speechless,  uttering many a sigh and heavy groan, and so in a desperate state  departed from his bed of sorrow. For the burial whereof great _store of  wines were sent in by the sheriff of the city of London_, and a great  multitude of people stood wayting to see his corpse carried to the  churchyard, some crying out, 'Hang him, rogue!'--'Bury him in the  dunghill.'--Others pressing upon him, saying they would quarter him for  executing the King, insomuch that the churchwardens and masters of the  parish were fain to come for the suppressing of them: and with great  difficulty he was at last carried to Whitechapel churchyard, having (as  it is said) a branch of rosemary at each end of the coffin, on the top  thereof, with a rope crosse from one end to the other, a merry conceited  cook, living at the sign of the Crown, having a black fan (worth the  value of 30_s_.), took a resolution to rent the same in pieces: and to  every feather tied a piece of packthread, dyed in black ink, and gave  them to divers persons, who, in derision, for a while wore them in their  hats.\"--See Ellis, _ubi supra_. The second tract states, that the first  victim Brandon beheaded was the Earl of Stratford.    \"When the body was put into a coffin at Whitehall,\" says Rushworth,  \"there were many sighs and weeping eyes at the scene; and divers strove  to dip their handkerchiefs in the King's blood.\" A general gloom and  consternation pervaded London on the day of this atrocious perpetration;  many of the chief inhabitants either shut themselves up in their houses,  or absented themselves from the city. On that day none of the courts of  justice sat; and on the next, Whitelocke, one of the commissioners of  the Great Seal, says, \"The commissioners met, but did not think fit to  do any business, or seal any writs, because of the King's death.\"  Whitelocke says, \"I went not to the House, but stayed all day at home in  my study, and at my prayers, that this day's work might not so displease  God as to bring prejudice to this poor afflicted nation.\"[8] Evelyn, in  his Diary, writes, \"I kept the day of this martyrdom as a fast, and  would not be present at that execrable wickedness, receiving the sad  account of it from my brother George and Mr. Owen, who came to visit me  this afternoon, and recounted all the circumstances.\" Archbishop Usher  came out to witness the scene from his house at Whitehall; but he  fainted when the King was led out on the scaffold.        [8] There is, I am informed, a tradition in Westminster School,      that South, the celebrated divine, was the boy whose turn it was      to read prayers on the day of Charles's death; and that he read      the prayer for the king as usual. South at that time must have      been about fourteen years of age. Five years afterwards, when      the loyal and learned divine was at Christ Church, Oxford, we      find his name to a copy of Latin verses, addressed to the      Protector on his conclusion of a treaty with the States of      Holland. This, no doubt, was a mere college exercise. See _Musae      Oxoniensies_, 1654.    The Journals of the Commons show, either that nothing was done, or that  it was thought fit to enter nothing on these eventful days. On the day  of the execution there is only the following remarkable entry:--    \"Ordered, _That the common post be stayed until to-morrow morning 10  o'clock_.\"    On the 31st, Commissary-general Ireton reports a paper of divers  particulars touching the King's body, his George, his diamond, and two  seals. The question being put, that the diamond be sent to Charles  Stuart, son of the late King, commonly called Prince of Wales, _it  passed with the negative_. The same question was then put, separately,  as to the garter, the George, and the seals: as to each, it passed in  the negative.    When the news of the decapitation of the King reached Scotland, that  loyal people were moved with horror and indignation.    Most of the gentry put on mourning; the chair of state in the parliament  house, the uppermost seats in the kirks, and almost all the pulpits,  were clothed in black.    The body of the King being embalmed, under the orders of Herbert and  bishop Juxon, was removed to St. James's. The usurpers of the government  refused permission to bury it in Henry the VII.'s Chapel, from a dread  of the indignation of the crowds who would assemble on so solemn and  interesting an occasion; but, at last, after some deliberation, the  council allowed it to be privately interred in St. George's Chapel at  Windsor, provided the expenses of the funeral should not exceed five  hundred pounds. The last duties of love and respect were (according to  Charles's express desire) paid to their sovereign's corpse by the Duke  of Richmond, the Marquess of Hertford, Lord Southampton, Lord Lindsey,  the Bishop of London, Herbert, and Mildmay, who, on producing a vote of  the Commons, were admitted by Whichcote, the Governor of Windsor Castle,  to the chapel. When the body was carried out of St. George's Hall, the  sky was serene and clear; but presently a storm of snow fell so fast,  that before it reached the chapel the pall and the mourners were  entirely whitened. When the bishop proposed to read the burial service  according to the rites of the Church of England, this fanatical governor  roughly refused, saying, \"that that Common Prayer Book was put down, and  he would not suffer it to be used in that garrison where he commanded.\"  Clarendon thus describes, with graphic simplicity, the sad scene to its  close:--    \"But when they entered into it (the chapel), which they had been so well  acquainted with, they found it so altered and transformed, all  inscriptions and those landmarks pulled down, by which all men knew  every particular place in that church, and such a dismal mutation over  the whole that they knew not where they where; nor was there one old  officer that had belonged to it, or knew where our Princes had used to  be interred. At last there was a fellow of the town who undertook to  tell them the place where, he said, 'there was a vault in which King  Harry the Eighth and Queen Jane Seymour were interred.' As near that  place as could conveniently be they caused the grave to be made.  There the King's body was laid, without any words, or other ceremonies,  than the tears and sighs of the few beholders. Upon the coffin was a  plate of silver fixed, with these words only, '_King Charles_, 1648.'  When the coffin was put in, the black velvet pall that had covered it  was thrown over it, and then the earth thrown in; which the governor  staid to see perfectly done, and then took the keys of the church.    \"Owing to the privacy of this interment, doubts were at the time current  as to its having actually taken place. It was asserted that the King's  body was buried in the sand at Whitehall; and Aubrey states a report,  that the coffin carried to Windsor was filled with rubbish and  brick-bats. These doubts were entirely removed by the opening of the  coffin (which was found where Clarendon described it,) in the presence  of George the Fourth, then Prince Regent, in April, 1813--of which Sir  Henry Halford has published an interesting narrative. On removing the  black pall which Herbert described, a plain leaden coffin was found,  with the inscription 'King Charles, 1648.' Within this was a wooden  coffin, much decayed, and the body carefully wrapped in cerecloth, into  the folds of which an unctuous matter mixed with resin had been melted,  to exclude the external air. The skin was dark and discoloured--the  pointed beard perfect--the shape of the face was a long oval--many of  the teeth remained--the hair was thick at the back of the head, and in  appearance nearly black--that of the beard was of a redder brown. The  head was severed from the body. The fourth cervical vertebra was found  to be cut through transversely, leaving the surfaces of the divided  portions perfectly smooth and even;--'an appearance,' says Sir H.  Halford, 'which could have been produced only by a heavy blow inflicted  with a very sharp instrument, and which furnished the last proof wanting  to identify King Charles I.'\"    (The volume is embellished with a Portrait of the King, and Outline  Prints of the Trial and Execution.)           *       *       *       *       *        NOTES OF A READER.             *       *       *       *       *      ATLAS OF THE BIBLE.

The tinas or  amalgamating vats constitute the prominent feature of the Francke process;  they are large wooden vats, shown in Figs. 1 and 2, page 173, from 6 ft.  to 10 ft. in diameter and 5 ft. deep, capacious enough to treat about 21/2  tons of ore at a time. Each vat is very strongly constructed, being bound  with thick iron hoops. At the bottom it is fitted with copper plates about  3 in. thick, A in Fig. 1; and at intervals round the sides of the vat are  fixed copper plates, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, with ribs on their inner  faces, slightly inclined to the horizontal, for promoting a more thorough  mixing. It is considered essential to the success of the process that the  bottom plates should present a clear rubbing surface of at least 10 square  feet.    [Illustration: THE FRANCKE \"TINA\" PROCESS FOR THE AMALGAMATION OF SILVER  ORES.]    Within the vat, and working on the top of the copper plates, there is a  heavy copper stirrer or muller, B, Figs. 1 and 2, caused to revolve by the  shafting, C, at the rate of 45 revolutions per minute. At Huanchaca this  stirrer has been made with four projecting radial arms, D D, Figs. 1 and  2; but at Guadalupe it is composed of one single bell-shaped piece, Figs.  3 and 4, without any arms, but with slabs like arms fixed on its  underside; and this latter is claimed to be the most effective. The  stirrer can be lifted or depressed in the vat at will by means of a worm  and screw at the top of the driving shaft, Fig. 3.    The bevel gearing is revolved by shafting connected with pulley wheels and  belting, the wheels being 3 ft. and 11/2 ft. in diameter, and 6 in. broad.  The driving engine is placed at one end of the building. Each vat requires  from 21/2 to 3 horse-power, or in other words, an expenditure of 1  horse-power per ton of ore treated.    At the bottom of the vat, and in front of it, a large wooden stop-cock is  fitted, through which the liquid amalgam is drawn off at the end of the  process into another shallow-bottomed and smaller vat, Figs. 1 and 2.  Directly above this last vat there is a water hose, supplied with a  flexible spout, through which a strong stream of water is directed upon  the amalgam as it issues from the grinding vat, in order to wash off all  impurities.    The following is the mode of working usually employed. The grinding vat or  tina is first charged to about one-fifth of its depth with water and from  6 cwt. to 7 cwt. of common salt. The amount of salt required in the  process depends naturally on the character of the ore to be treated, as  ascertained by actual experiment, and averages from 150 lb. to 300 lb. per  ton of ore. Into this brine a jet of steam is then directed, and the  stirrer is set to work for about half an hour, until the liquid is in a  thoroughly boiling condition, in which state it must be kept until the end  of the process.    As soon as the liquid reaches boiling point, the stamped and roasted ore  is run into the vat, and at the end of another half-hour about 1 cwt. of  mercury is added, further quantities being added as required at different  stages of the process. The stirring is kept up continuously for eight to  twelve hours, according to the character and richness of the ores. At the  end of this time the amalgam is run out through the stop-cock at bottom of  the vat, is washed, and is put into hydraulic presses, by means of which  the mercury is squeezed out, leaving behind a thick, pulpy mass, composed  mainly of silver, and locally termed a \"pina,\" from its resembling in  shape the cone of a pine tree. These pinas are then carefully weighed and  put into a subliming furnace, Figs. 5 and 6, in order to drive off the  rest of the mercury, the silver being subsequently run into bars. About  four ounces of mercury are lost for every pound of silver made.    The actual quantities of mercury to be added in the grinding vat, and the  times of its addition, are based entirely on practical experience of the  process. With ore assaying 150 oz. to 175 oz. of silver to the ton, 75  lb. of mercury are put in at the commencement, another 75 lb. at intervals  during the middle of the process, and finally another lot of 75 lb.  shortly before the termination. When treating \"pacos,\" or earthy chlorides  of silver, assaying only 20 oz. to 30 oz. of silver to the ton, 36 lb. of  mercury is added to 21/2 tons of ore at three different stages of the  process as just described.    The _rationale_ of the process therefore appears to be that the  chlorination of the ores is only partially effected during the roasting,  so as to prevent the formation of injurious salts, and is completed in the  vats, in which the chloride of copper is formed progressively as required,  by the gradual grinding away of the copper by friction between the bottom  copper plates and the stirrer; and this chloride subsequently becoming  incorporated with the boiling brine is considered to quicken the action of  the mercury upon the silver.    _Subliming_.--The subliming furnace, shown in Figs. 5 and 6, is a plain  cylindrical chamber, A, about 4 ft. diameter inside and 41/2 ft. high, lined  with firebrick, in the center of which is fixed the upright cast-iron  cylinder or retort, C, of 1 ft. diameter, closed at top and open at  bottom. The furnace top is closed by a cast-iron lid, which is lifted off  for charging the fuel. Round the top of the furnace is a tier of radial  outlet holes for the fuel smoke to escape through; and round the bottom is  a corresponding tier of inlet air-holes, through which the fuel is  continually rabbled with poles by hand. The fuel used is llama dung,  costing 80 cents, or 2s. 6d., per 250 lb.; it makes a very excellent fuel  for smelting purposes, smouldering and maintaining steadily the low heat  required for subliming the mercury from the amalgam. Beneath the furnace  is a vault containing a wrought-iron water-tank, B, into which the open  mouth of the retort, C, projects downward and is submerged below the  water. For charging the retort, the water-tank is placed on a trolly; and  standing upright on a stool inside the tank is placed the pina, or conical  mass of silver amalgam, which is held together by being built up on a  core-bar fitted with a series of horizontal disks. The trolly is then run  into the vault, and the water-tank containing the pina is lifted by  screw-jacks, so as to raise the pina into the retort, in which position  the tank is then supported by a cross-beam. The sublimed mercury is  condensed and collected in the water; and on the completion of the process  the tank is lowered, and the spongy or porous cone of silver is withdrawn  from the retort. The subliming furnaces are ranged in a row, and  communicate by lines of rails with the weigh-house.           *       *       *       *       *          INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT PLATINUM.      After an excellent day of weakfishing on Barnegat Bay and an exceptionable  supper of the good, old fashioned, country tavern kind, a social party of  anglers sat about on Uncle Jo Parker's broad porch at Forked River,  smoking and enjoying the cool, fragrant breath of the cedar swamp, when  somehow the chat drifted to the subject of assaying and refining the  precious metals. That was just where one of the party, Mr. D.W. Baker, of  Newark, was at home, and in the course of an impromptu lecture he told the  party more about the topic under discussion, and especially the platinum  branch of it, than they ever knew before.    \"Our firm,\" he said, \"practically does all the platinum business of this  country, and the demand for the material is so great that we never can get  more than we want of it. The principal portion, or, in fact, nearly all of  it, comes from the famous mines of the Demidoff family, who have the  monopoly of the production in Russia. It is all refined and made into  sheets of various thicknesses, and into wire of certain commercial sizes,  before it comes to us; but we have frequently to cut, roll, and redraw it  to new forms and sizes to meet the demands upon us. At one time it was  coined in Russia, but it is no longer applied to that use. We have  obtained some very good crude platinum ore from South America and have  refined it successfully, but the supply from that source is, as yet, very  small. I am not aware that it has been found anywhere else than in  Colombia, on that continent, but the explorations thus far made into the  mineral resources of South America have been very meager, and it is by no  means improbable that platinum may yet be discovered there in quantities  rivaling the supply of Russia.    \"A popular error respecting platinum is that its intrinsic value is the  same as that of gold. At one time it did approximate to gold in value, but  never quite reached it, and is now worth only $8 to $12 an ounce,  according to the work expended upon it in getting it into required forms  and the amount of alloy it contains. The alloy used for it is iridium,  which hardens it, and the more iridium it contains the more difficult it  is to work, and consequently the more expensive. When pure, platinum is as  soft as silver, but by the addition of iridium it becomes the hardest of  metals. The great difficulty in manipulating platinum is its excessive  resistance to heat. A temperature that will make steel run like water and  melt down fireclay has absolutely no effect upon it. You may put a piece  of platinum wire no thicker than human hair into a blast furnace where  ingots of steel are melting down all around it, and the bit of wire will  come out as absolutely unchanged as if it had been in an ice box all the  time.    \"No means has been discovered for accurately determining the melting  temperature of platinum, but it must be enormous. And yet,"]]]
