My choice is Hodgson  for centre.\"    \"Too lazy, Roberts. Mine is Chalmers.\"    \"Rot! He's a winger.\"    And so the selection of an eleven against the Cognoscenti went on in the  usual old-fashioned style.    Bourne dropped into my study afterwards and said, gloomily; \"On the whole,  Carr, had I not better tell the fellows that they may elect Acton for our  school fixtures, but he cannot have his cap? That will take the bull by  the horns from the beginning.\"    \"By no means. The other fellows have nothing whatever to do with giving  caps away; that is your business entirely. Besides, who knows? Acton may  not care to play when he knows he cannot get his cap.\"    \"I'd be agreeably surprised if he didn't. But that won't be his little  game. Take my word for it, he'll turn out on every blessed occasion, play  like a master of the game, and give us no end of trouble.\"    \"Perhaps he may. Anyhow, something may turn up between now and the last  match--we'll hope so, anyhow; and until the last cap is given away the  fellows generally won't spot your little game.\"    \"'Tis only putting off the evil day, Carr,\" said Phil, discontentedly.    \"A good day to put off.\"    Thus, when Hodgson was given the first cap, there was the general comment  that he was pretty sure to annex a cap sooner or later, and might as well  have it soon. Acton's turn--so said the school would come later, though  Biffen's house sneered. \"Of course, Hodgson is in the Sixth. What else but  a Sixth Form fellow is wanted in a footer eleven?\"    Sharpe's house secured the next two caps, and Biffen's groaned aloud.  \"Whatever is old Phil about? One might think he was blind in his right eye  and straddled in his left. We'll send him a pair of gig lamps, and then  perhaps he may discover Acton--Acton, of Biffen's.\"    The weeks went by, and after a spirited display by Chalmers against the  Emeriti, he was given his cap, and for the first time since Biffen's was a  house they had a man in the eleven. But they gasped as Chalmers came out  of the pavilion with his blue and silver cap on his curls. \"That ass  Bourne found the house at last, and then he goes and carefully spots the  wrong man. Whatever _is_ the matter with him? To pick Chalmers before  Acton! Rot!\"    Over tea that night Biffen's bubbled and choked, and the other houses  began to take a lively interest in the next distribution, for this  constant passing of Acton was becoming exciting. But still--and I was glad  to see it--the school had faith in Phil; they counted on justice being  done, as it were, in the last laps. No one mentioned a word to him about  the intense curiosity and even anxiety that his odd bestowal of caps had  excited amongst them, for Phil has that way with him that can shut up a  fellow quicker than you can snap a knife if that fellow is travelling out  of bounds.    However, when Place, of Merishall's, came out of the pavilion a full-blown  member of the school eleven there was a scene. The whole body of fellows  now thought that the comedy was pretty nearly becoming a tragedy, and they  showed their feelings unmistakably. Place was cheered by Merishall's, but  not overwhelmingly, and from the other houses there was an ominous  silence. Place, as he trotted out, looked rather puzzled, and a bit  undecided how to take his odd reception, and glanced rather helplessly  round at the sea of faces all turned anxiously towards him. There would be  pretty nearly seven hundred fellows round the pavilion, for there was no  end of excitement.    \"Keep up your pecker, Place! You're all right, anyhow!\" shouted some one.    The other members came out one by one, and were cheered to the echo, and  at last Phil came out with Hodgson. He was rather pale, but had his back  very straight. There was a dead silence, and, for the first time since he  had been captain, Phil walked down the steps without a friendly cheer. I  think even now the old school behaved itself very well--the fellows were  not behind the scenes, and didn't see more than was before their eyes, but  there was not a single word thrown out at Phil. Acton came out with  Worcester, and the pity was that he didn't deserve the cheers he got.    [Illustration: PHIL WALKED DOWN THE STEPS WITHOUT A FRIENDLY CHEER.]    The week before the Carthusian match there was but one solitary player to  be promoted. The position was back, and every fellow in the place knew  that, bar Bourne himself, there wasn't another man that could hold a  candle to Acton there. The committee doggedly, and with meaning, elected  the only player there was to elect, and Acton signified that he was  willing to play. Bourne, as usual, was there, and no one felt more than he  the air of distrust and constraint which hung over the meeting. When Acton  was unanimously elected for back Phil stolidly wrote out the list of the  team and had it pinned up on the notice-board. He had carefully drawn the  line in red ink above the last name--Acton's--which showed that the  pride of Biffen's was not in the eleven yet.    Probably Acton on the next day played as well as even he had ever played  in his life, for he was almost impassable, and the crowd of fellows  cheered him till they were hoarse. The minute the whistle blew, like one  man the whole school swarmed round the pavilion. The question each asked  himself and his chum was, \"Would Acton get the last cap?\" And the answer  was, \"Why, of course! Who else should have it?\"    That afternoon to most of the fellows the eleven seemed an age getting  into their sweaters and coats. When Acton appeared first, and it was seen  that he was wearing the pink cap of Biffen's on his head there was more  than astonishment, there was consternation. Whatever did it mean? Acton  smiled good-naturedly at the school as they cheered him to the echo, and  hurried unconcernedly along. The others of the eleven came out dejectedly,  and filed up the hill in gloomy little groups. The whole school waited for  Phil, and when he came out, pale and worried, they received him in icy  silence. As he was coming down the steps one of Biffen's fags shouted  shrilly, \"Three cheers for Acton!\"    Phil stalked through the shouting school, and as I joined him and we  walked up together, he said, through his clenched teeth--    \"I wish, old man, I had never seen that brute.\"    That evening Bourne wrote to Worcester offering him the remaining cap.    Worcester flew across to Acton's room, and said, \"Bourne has offered me  the place--the last cap. He must be stark, staring mad!\"    \"Take it,\" said Acton, coolly.    \"No fear,\" said Worcester. \"We have a stupid kind of prejudice here for  having the best eleven we can get, and it isn't the best if you're out of  it. Bourne has always been a most impartial fellow up to this date, so  this little occurrence has thrown us off the rails. Before I go to  protest, though, have you any idea what is the matter?\"    \"He does not consider me fit for the eleven,\" said Acton with a light  laugh, but also with perfect truth.    \"Rot!\" said Dick, hurrying away.    He hunted up the other nine fellows, and said bluntly his business.    \"I vote we all protest to Bourne. A round robin should meet the case.\"    \"Good,\" said Mivart. \"Draw one up, Dicky dear.\"    Dick in time produced the following:--    \"We, the undersigned, think that the St. Amory eleven is incomplete  without John Acton, of Biffen's house, and, consequently, that he ought to  have the last cap; and we would beg the captain to offer it him unless  there be very good reasons for not doing so. We would suggest that if John  Acton isn't to have the cap he be told the reason. The undersigned do not  wish in the smallest degree to prejudice the right of the captain to  select members for the eleven, but think that in the present case the  withholding of a cap from John Acton inexplicable.\"    \"You're a ready scribe, Dick,\" said Chalmers. \"We may all sign that, eh?\"    \"Yes,\" said Worcester. \"I first, because I am undeservedly offered the  cap, and the rest of you in order of membership.\"    No one saw any objection to signing Dick's memorandum, and forthwith, with  all legal formality, the round robin was signed by the ten, and sent to  Phil by Dick's fag with orders to wait for an answer.    It came within five minutes.           \"DEAR WORCESTER,         I have no intention of offering John Acton a place in the St.       Amory's football eleven. There are good reasons for not doing       so, and I have already told Acton the reasons. Please let me       know whether you accept the vacant place I had the pleasure of       offering you.                         Yours sincerely,                               PHILIP BOURNE.\"    This was a thunderbolt among the fellows. Then Acton knew!    Worcester posted back to Acton, lost in amazement.    \"Look at this, Acton!\"    Acton carefully read Bourne's letter, and Dick, who was watching him  anxiously, saw him bite his lips with rage; for Phil's icy contempt stood  out in every word of the letter.    \"He says you know why you are not in the eleven.\"    Acton knew that he would have to explain something, or else Bourne would  win the day yet. So he said--    \"That is true. He told me so at the beginning of the season, but, of  course, I never bargained for his keeping his word; and when you hear the  reason he gave me--if this is his reason--you'll gasp.\"    \"Well,\" said Dick, \"although I've no right to ask you, I'd like to hear  the plain, unvarnished tale, for, speaking out, Phil Bourne has always  passed for a decent, level fellow. This business, somehow, doesn't seem  his form at all, and it is only fair to him to say it.\"    \"Did you see the match we had with Shannon's scratch team when the term  began?\"    \"I did.\"    \"Did you notice"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14776"],[0,"The Arabian Art of Taming and Training Wild & Vicious Horses (#6)"],[1,"you some instructions about getting him in.      HOW TO LEAD A COLT INTO THE STABLE AND HITCH HIM WITHOUT HAVING HIM PULL  ON THE HALTER.    You should lead the broke horse into the stable first, and get the colt,  if you can, to follow in after him. If he refuses to go, step up to him,  taking a little stick or switch in your right hand; then take hold of the  halter close to his head with your left hand, at the same time reaching  over his back with your right arm so that you can tap him on the opposite  side with your switch; bring him up facing the door, tap him lightly with  your switch, reaching as far back with it as you can. This tapping, by  being pretty well back, and on the opposite side, will drive him ahead,  and keep him close to you, then by giving him the right direction with  your left hand you can walk into the stable with him. I have walked colts  into the stable this way, in less than a minute, after men had worked at  them half an hour, trying to pull them in. If you cannot walk him it at  once this way, turn him about and walk him round in every direction, until  you can get him up to the door without pulling at him. Then let him stand  a few minutes, keeping his head in the right direction with the halter,  and he will walk in, in less than ten minutes. Never attempt to pull the  colt into the stable; that would make him think at once that it was a  dangerous place, and if he was not afraid of it before, he would be then.  Besides we don't want him to know anything about pulling on the halter.  Colts are often hurt, and sometimes killed, by trying to force them into  the stable; and those who attempt to do it in that way, go into an up-hill  business, when a plain smooth road is before them.    If you want to hitch your colt, put him in a tolerably wide stall which  should not be too long, and should be connected by a bar or something of  that kind to the partition behind it; so that, after the colt is in he  cannot get far enough back to take a straight, backward pull on the  halter; then by hitching him in the center of the stall, it would be  impossible for him to pull on the halter, the partition behind preventing  him from going back, and the halter in the center checking him every time  he turns to the left or right. In a state of this kind you can break every  horse to stand hitched by a light strap, any where, without his ever  knowing any thing about pulling. But if you have broke your horse to lead,  and have learned him the use of the halter (which you should always do  before you hitch him to any thing), you can hitch him in any kind of a  stall, and give him something to eat to keep him up to his place for a few  minutes at first and there is not one colt in fifty that will pull on his  halter.      THE KIND OF BIT AND HOW TO ACCUSTOM A HORSE TO IT.    You should use a large, smooth, snaffle bit, so as not to hurt his mouth,  with a bar to each side, to prevent the bit from pulling through either  way. This you should attach to the head-stall of your bridle and put it on  your colt without any reins to it, and let him run loose in a large stable  or shed, some time, until he becomes a little used to the bit, and will  bear it without trying to get it out of his mouth. It would be well, if  convenient, to repeat this several times before you do anything more with  the colt; as soon as he will bear the bit, attach a single rein to it,  without any martingale. You should also have a halter on your colt, or a  bridle made after the fashion of a halter, with a strap to it, so that you  can hold or lead him about without pulling on the bit much. He is now  ready for the saddle.      HOW TO SADDLE A COLT.    Any one man, who has this theory, can put a saddle on the wildest colt  that ever grew, without any help, and without scaring him. The first thing  will be to tie each stirrup strap into a loose knot to make them short,  and prevent the stirrups from flying about and hitting him. Then double up  the skirts and take the saddle under your right arm, so as not to frighten  him with it as you approach. When you get to him, rub him gently a few  times with your hand, and then raise the saddle very slowly until he can  see it, and smell, and feel it with his nose. Then let the skirts loose,  and rub it very gently against his neck the way the hair lays, letting him  hear the rattle of the skirts as he feels them against him; each time  getting a little farther backward, and finally slip it over his shoulders  on his back. Shake it a little with your hand, and in less than five  minutes you can rattle it about over his back as much as you please, and  pull it off and throw it on again, without his paying much attention to  it.    As soon as you have accustomed him to the saddle, fasten the girth. Be  careful how you do this. It often frightens a Colt when he feels the girth  binding him, and making the saddle fit tight on his back. You should bring  up the girth very gently, and not draw it too tight at first, just enough  to hold the saddle on. Move him a little, and then girth it as tight as  you choose, and he will not mind it.    You should see that the pad of your saddle is all right before you put it  on, and that there is nothing to make it hurt him, or feel unpleasant to  his back. It should not have any loose straps on the back part of it to  flap about and scare him. After you have saddled him in this way, take a  switch in your right hand to tap him up with, and walk about in the stable  a few times with your right arm over the saddle, taking hold of the reins  on each side of his neck, with your right and left hands. Thus marching  him about in the stable until you learn him the use of the bridle, and can  turn him about in any direction, and stop him by a gentle pull of the  rein. Always caress him, and loose the reins a little every time you stop  him.    You should always be alone, and have your colt in some tight stable or  shed, the first time you ride him; the loft should be high so that you can  sit on his back without endangering your head. You can learn him more in  two hours time in a stable of this kind, than you could in two weeks in  the common way of breaking colts, out in an open place. It you follow my  course of treatment, you need not run any risk, or have any trouble in  riding the worst kind of a horse. You take him a step at a time, until you  get up a mutual confidence and trust between yourself and horse. First  learn him to lead and stand hitched, next acquaint him with the saddle,  and the use of the bit; and then all that remains, is to get on him  without scaring him, and you can ride him as well as any horse.      HOW TO MOUNT THE COLT.    First gentle him well on both sides, about the saddle, and all over,  until he will stand still without holding, and is not afraid to see you  any where about him.    As soon as you have him thus gentled, get a small block, about one foot or  eighteen inches in height, and set it down by the side of him, about where  you want to stand to mount him; step up on this, raising yourself very  gently; horses notice every change of position very closely, and if you  were to step up suddenly on the block, it would be very apt to scare him;  but by raising yourself gradually on it, he will see you, without being  frightened, in a position very near the same as when you are on his back.    As soon as he will bear this without alarm, untie the stirrup strap next  to you, and put your left foot into the stirrup, and stand square over it,  holding your knee against the horse, and your toe out, so as to touch him  under the shoulder with the toe of your boot. Place your right hand on the  front of the saddle and on the opposite side of you. Taking hold of a  portion of the mane and the reins as they hang loosely over his neck with  your left hand; then gradually bear your weight on the stirrup, and on  your right hand, until the horse feels your whole weight on the saddle;  repeat this several times, each time raising yourself a little higher from  the block, until he will allow you to raise your leg over his croop, and  place yourself in the saddle.    There are three great advantages in having a block to mount from. First, a  sudden change of position is very apt to frighten a young horse that has  never been handled; he will allow you to walk up to him, and stand by his  side without scaring at you, because you have gentled him to that  position, but if you get down on your hands and knees and crawl towards  him, he will be very much frightened, and upon the same principle, he  would frighten at your new position if you had the power to hold yourself  over his back without touching him. Then the first great advantage of the  block is to gradually gentle him to that new position in which he will see  you when you ride him.    Secondly, by the process of leaning your weight in the stirrups, and on  your hand, you can gradually accustom him to your weight, so as not to  frighten him by having him feel it all at once. And in the third place the  block elevates you so that you will not have to make a spring in order to  get on to the horse's back, but from it you can gradually raise yourself  into the saddle. When you take these precautions, there is no horse so  wild, but what you can mount him without making him jump. I have tried it  on the worst horses that could be found, and have never failed in any  case. When mounting, your horse should always stand without being held. A  horse is never well broke when he has to be held with a tight rein while  mounting; and a colt is never so safe to mount, as when you see that  assurance of confidence, and absence of fear, which causes him to stand  without holding.      HOW TO RIDE THE COLT.    When you want him to start do not touch him on the side with your heel or  do anything to frighten him and make him jump. But speak to him kindly,  and if he does not start pull him"]]]
