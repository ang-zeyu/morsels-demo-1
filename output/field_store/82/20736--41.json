Listen to the kitchen clock!       To itself it ever talks,       From its place it never walks;     \"Tick-tock-tick-tock: \"       Tell me what it says.    2. \"I'm a very patient clock,       Never moved by hope or fear,       Though I've stood for many a year;     Tick-tock-tick-tock: \"       That is what it says.    3. \"I'm a very truthful clock:       People say about the place,       Truth is written on my face;     Tick-tock-tick-tock: \"       That is what it says.    4. \"I'm a most obliging clock;       If you wish to hear me strike,       You may do it when you like;     Tick-tock-tick-tock: \"       That is what it says.    5. \"I'm a very friendly clock;       For this truth to all I tell,       Life is short, improve it well;     Tick-tock-tick-tock: \"       That is what it says.    6.

I. \"Herbert, will you please peel my orange?\" said Lucy. Herbert was  reading his new book, but he put it down at once, and took the orange from  his little sister.    2. \"Shall I make a pair of scales, Lucy, for you to use when you play  store?\"    3. \"Oh yes! but how can you do that'!\"    4.  \"I'll show you. First, we must take the peel off in two little cups,  one just as large as the other. While I do this, see if you can find me  two nice sticks about ten inches long.\"    5. Lucy ran out to the woodhouse to find the sticks.--\" Will these do?\"    6. \"No, they are too hard. Find some pine sticks if you can.\"    7.  \"Here are some.\"    8. \"These will do nicely. Now I must make a scale beam and a post. Can you  find me a little block for a post, Lucy'!\"    9. \"Will a ribbon block do, Herbert?\"    10.  \"Yes, if it is not too thick.\"    11.  \"Here is one an inch thick.\"    12. \"That will be just right. Now get the little gimlet.\"    [Footnote: gimlet: Hand tool with a spiraled shank, a screw tip, and a  cross handle; used for boring holes.]    13. Herbert worked away until he had made the beam and the post. Then he  made a hole in the middle of the block, and put the post in. Next, he put  the beam into a little groove at the top of the post, so that it would  balance nicely.    14. \"Now, Lucy, we must have a needle and some thread. We must put four  threads to each cup; then we will tie the threads to the ends of the beam.      15. \"There, Lucy, what do you think of that?\"    16. \"Why, Herbert, that is just as nice as the real scales in father's  store; and you may have all my orange for making them.\"    [Illustration: Orange halves and other parts of the scale.]        LESSON XXXIX.    smelt    hide    crept    laid    floor    inn    bear    fur    young'est    danced    joy'ful ly    marched    sol'diers    bad'ly    run'ning     eld'est      [Illustration: Three children and a bear; surprised woman in background.]    THE BEAR AND THE CHILDREN.    1. In the parlor of an inn in a small town, sat a man who had been going  about with a bear. He was waiting for his supper, and the bear was tied up  in the yard.    2. Up in the attic, three little children were playing together. The  eldest might have been six years old; the youngest, not more than two.    3. Stump! stump! stump! Some one was coming up the stairs.    4. The door flew open suddenly, and there stood the great, shaggy bear. He  had got tired of waiting, and had found his way to the stairs.    5. The children were badly frightened. Each one crept into a corner, but  the bear found them all out, and smelt their clothes, but did not hurt  them.    6. \"This must be a great dog,\" they said, and they began to pat him.    7. Then the bear lay down on the floor, and the youngest boy climbed on  his back, hid his head in the shaggy fur, and played at \"hide and seek.\"    8. The eldest boy took his drum and began to strike it, when the bear rose  on his hind legs and danced. At that the children gave a merry shout.    9. The two younger boys took their wooden guns, and gave the bear one.  Away they all marched around the room, keeping step.    10. Now the frightened mother of the children came to the door. But the  youngest boy shouted, joyfully. \"See, we are playing soldiers!\"    11. Then the bear's master came running up, and took the bear away.

The fishhawk, or osprey, is not so large as the eagle; but he has, like  the eagle, a hooked bill and sharp claws.    2. His color is a dark brown, with black and white spots, and his length  is from twenty to twenty-two inches. His breast is mostly white. His tail  and wings are long.    3. The fishhawk is often found sitting upon a tree over a pond, or lake,  or river. He is also found by the seaside.    4. He watches the fish as they swim in the water beneath him; then he  darts down suddenly and catches one of them.    5. When he catches a fish in his sharp, rough claws, he carries it off to  eat, and, as he flies away with it for his dinner, an eagle sometimes  meets him.    6. The eagle flies at him fiercely with his sharp bill and claws, and  compels the hawk to drop the fish.    7. Then the eagle catches the fish as it falls, before it reaches the  ground, and carries it off.    8. The poor fish hawk, with a loud cry, timidly flies away. He must go  again to the water and catch another fish for his dinner.    9. Thus you see, that the eagle is a robber. He robs fishhawks, whose only  mode of getting a living is by catching fish.

Once or twice a little leaf was heard to cry and sigh, as leaves often  do, when a gentle wind is blowing. And the twig said, \"What is the matter,  little leaf?\"    2. \"The wind,\" said the leaf, \"just told me that one day it would pull me  off, and throw me on the ground to die.\"    3. The twig told it to the branch, and the branch told it to the tree.  When the tree heard it, it rustled all over, and sent word back to the  trembling leaf.    4. \"Do not be afraid,\" it said; \"hold on tight, and you shall not go off  till you are ready.\"    5. So the leaf stopped sighing, and went on singing and rustling. It grew  all the summer long till October. And when the bright days of autumn came,  the leaf saw all the leaves around growing very beautiful.    6. Some were yellow, some were brown, and many were striped with different  colors. Then the leaf asked the tree what this meant.    7. The tree said, \"All these leaves are getting ready to fly away, and  they have put on these colors because of their joy.\"    8. Then the little leaf began to want to go, and grew very beautiful in  thinking of it. When it was gay in colors, it saw that the branches of the  tree had no bright colors on them.    9. So the leaf said, \"O branch! why are you lead- colored while we are all  beautiful and golden?\"    10. \"We must keep on our working clothes,\" said the tree, \"for our work is  not yet done; but your clothes are for holidays, because your task is now  over.\"    11. Just then a little puff of wind came, and the leaf let go without  thinking, and the wind took it up and turned it over and over.    12. Then it fell gently down under the edge of the fence, among hundreds  of leaves, and has never waked to tell us what it dreamed about.

The passage in which Caesar sums up the Gaulish pantheon runs: \"They  worship chiefly the god Mercury; of him there are many symbols, and they  regard him as the inventor of all the arts, as the guide of travellers,  and as possessing great influence over bargains and commerce. After him  they worship Apollo and Mars, Juppiter and Minerva. About these they  hold much the same beliefs as other nations. Apollo heals diseases,  Minerva teaches the elements of industry and the arts, Juppiter rules  over the heavens, Mars directs war.... All the Gauls assert that they  are descended from Dispater, their progenitor.\"[53]    As will be seen in this chapter, the Gauls had many other gods than  these, while the Roman gods, by whose names Caesar calls the Celtic  divinities, probably only approximately corresponded to them in  functions. As the Greeks called by the names of their own gods those of  Egypt, Persia, and Babylonia, so the Romans identified Greek, Teutonic,  and Celtic gods with theirs. The identification was seldom complete, and  often extended only to one particular function or attribute. But, as in  Gaul, it was often part of a state policy, and there the fusion of cults  was intended to break the power of the Druids. The Gauls seem to have  adopted Roman civilisation easily, and to have acquiesced in the process  of assimilation of their divinities to those of their conquerors. Hence  we have thousands of inscriptions in which a god is called by the name  of the Roman deity to whom he was assimilated and by his own Celtic  name--Jupiter Taranis, Apollo Grannus, etc. Or sometimes to the name of  the Roman god is added a descriptive Celtic epithet or a word derived  from a Celtic place-name. Again, since Augustus reinstated the cult of  the Lares, with himself as chief Lar, the epithet Augustus was given to  all gods to whom the character of the Lares could be ascribed, e.g.  Belenos Augustus. Cults of local gods became cults of the genius of the  place, coupled with the genius of the emperor. In some cases, however,  the native name stands alone. The process was aided by art. Celtic gods  are represented after Greco-Roman or Greco-Egyptian models. Sometimes  these carry a native divine symbol, or, in a few cases, the type is  purely native, e.g. that of Cernunnos. Thus the native paganism was  largely transformed before Christianity appeared in Gaul. Many Roman  gods were worshipped as such, not only by the Romans in Gaul, but by the  Gauls, and we find there also traces of the Oriental cults affected by  the Romans.[54]    There were probably in Gaul many local gods, tribal or otherwise, of  roads and commerce, of the arts, of healing, etc., who, bearing  different names, might easily be identified with each other or with  Roman gods. Caesar's Mercury, Mars, Minerva, etc., probably include many  local Minervas, Mars, and Mercuries. There may, however, have been a few  great gods common to all Gaul, universally worshipped, besides the  numerous local gods, some of whom may have been adopted from the  aborigines. An examination of the divine names in Holder's  _Altceltischer Sprachschatz_ will show how numerous the local gods of  the continental Celts must have been. Professor Anwyl reckons that 270  gods are mentioned once on inscriptions, 24 twice, 11 thrice, 10 four  times, 3 five times, 2 seven times, 4 fifteen times, 1 nineteen times  (Grannos), and 1 thirty-nine times (Belenos).[55]    The god or gods identified with Mercury were very popular in Gaul, as  Caesar's words and the witness of place-names derived from the Roman name  of the god show. These had probably supplanted earlier names derived  from those of the corresponding native gods. Many temples of the god  existed, especially in the region of the Allobrogi, and bronze  statuettes of him have been found in abundance. Pliny also describes a  colossal statue designed for the Arverni who had a great temple of the  god on the Puy de Dome.[56] Mercury was not necessarily the chief god,  and at times, e.g. in war, the native war-gods would be prominent. The  native names of the gods assimilated to Mercury are many in number; in  some cases they are epithets, derived from the names of places where a  local \"Mercury\" was worshipped, in others they are derived from some  function of the gods.[57] One of these titles is Artaios, perhaps  cognate with Irish _art_, \"god,\" or connected with _artos_, \"bear.\"  Professor Rh[^y]s, however, finds its cognate in Welsh _ar_, \"ploughed  land,\" as if one of the god's functions connected him with  agriculture.[58] This is supported by another inscription to Mercurius  Cultor at Wurtemberg. Local gods of agriculture must thus have been  assimilated to Mercury. A god Moccus, \"swine,\" was also identified with  Mercury, and the swine was a frequent representative of the corn-spirit  or of vegetation divinities in Europe. The flesh of the animal was often  mixed with the seed corn or buried in the fields to promote fertility.  The swine had been a sacred animal among the Celts, but had apparently  become an anthropomorphic god of fertility, Moccus, assimilated to  Mercury, perhaps because the Greek Hermes caused fertility in flocks and  herds. Such a god was one of a class whose importance was great among  the Celts as an agricultural people.    Commerce, much developed among the settled Gauls, gave rise to a god or  gods who guarded roads over which merchants travelled, and boundaries  where their transactions took place. Hence we have an inscription from  Yorkshire, \"To the god who invented roads and paths,\" while another  local god of roads, equated with Mercury, was Cimiacinus.[59]    Another god, Ogmios, a native god of speech, who draws men by chains  fastened to the tip of his tongue, is identified in Lucian with  Heracles, and is identical with the Goidelic Ogma.[60] Eloquence and  speech are important matters among primitive peoples, and this god has  more likeness to Mercury as a culture-god than to Heracles, Greek  writers speaking of eloquence as binding men with the chains of Hermes.    Several local gods, of agriculture, commerce, and culture, were thus  identified with Mercury, and the Celtic Mercury was sometimes worshipped  on hilltops, one of the epithets of the god, Dumias, being connected  with the Celtic word for hill or mound. Irish gods were also associated  with mounds.    Many local gods were identified with Apollo both in his capacity of god  of healing and also that of god of light.[61] The two functions are not  incompatible, and this is suggested by the name Grannos, god of thermal  springs both in Britain and on the Continent. The name is connected with  a root which gives words meaning \"burning,\" \"shining,\" etc., and from  which comes also Irish _grian_, \"sun.\" The god is still remembered in a  chant sung round bonfires in Auvergne. A sheaf of corn is set on fire,  and called \"Granno mio,\" while the people sing, \"Granno, my friend;  Granno, my father; Granno, my mother.\"[62] Another god of thermal  springs was Borvo, Bormo, or Bormanus, whose name is derived from  _borvo_, whence Welsh _berw_, \"boiling,\" and is evidently connected with  the bubbling of the springs.[63] Votive tablets inscribed Grannos or  Borvo show that the offerers desired healing for themselves or others.    The name Belenos found over a wide area, but mainly in Aquileia, comes  from _belo-s_, bright, and probably means \"the shining one.\" It is thus  the name of a Celtic sun-god, equated with Apollo in that character. If  he is the Belinus referred to by Geoffrey of Monmouth,[64] his cult must  have extended into Britain from the Continent, and he is often mentioned  by classical writers, while much later Ausonius speaks of his priest in  Gaul.[65] Many place and personal names point to the popularity of his  cult, and inscriptions show that he, too, was a god of health and of  healing-springs. The plant _Belinuntia_ was called after him and  venerated for its healing powers.[66] The sun-god's functions of light  and fertility easily passed over into those of health-giving, as our  study of Celtic festivals will show.    A god with the name Maponos, connected with words denoting  \"youthfulness,\" is found in England and Gaul, equated with Apollo, who  himself is called _Bonus Puer_ in a Dacian inscription. Another god  Mogons or Mogounos, whose name is derived from _Mago_, \"to increase,\"  and suggests the idea of youthful strength, may be a form of the  sun-god, though some evidence points to his having been a sky-god.[67]    The Celtic Apollo is referred to by classical writers.
