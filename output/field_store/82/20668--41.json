And Mary, many of the old-time industries  which I had been accustomed to as a girl have passed away. Electricity  and numerous labor-saving devices make household tasks easier,  eliminating some altogether. When housekeeping you will find time to  devote to many important questions of the day which we old-time  housekeepers never dreamed of having. Considerable thought should be  given to studying to improve and simplify conditions of the home-life.  It is your duty. Obtain books; study food values and provide those  foods which nourish the body, instead of spending time uselessly  preparing dainties to tempt a jaded appetite. Don't spoil Ralph when  you marry him. Give him good, wholesome food, and plenty of it; but  although the cooking of food takes up much of a housekeeper's time, it  is not wise to allow it to take up one's time to the exclusion of  everything else. Mary, perhaps my views are old-fashioned. I am not a  'new woman' in any sense of the word. The new woman may take her place  beside man in the business world and prove equally as efficient, but  I do not think woman should invade man's sphere any more than he  should assume her duties.\"    \"Aunt Sarah, I am surprised to hear you talk in that manner about  woman's sphere,\" replied Mary, \"knowing what a success you are in the  home, and how beautifully you manage everything you undertake. I felt,  once you recognized the injustice done woman in not allowing them to  vote, you would feel differently, and since women are obliged to obey  the laws, should they not have a voice in choosing the lawmakers? When  you vote, it will not take you out of the home. You and Uncle John  will merely stop on your way to the store, and instead of Uncle John  going in to write and register what he thinks should be done and by  whom it should be done, you too will express your opinion. This will  likely be twice a year. By doing this, no woman loses her womanliness,  goodness or social position, and to these influences the vote is but  another influence. I know there are many things in connection with the  right of equal suffrage with what you do not sympathize.    \"Aunt Sarah, let me tell you about a dear friend of mine who taught  school with me in the city. Emily taught a grammar grade, and did not  get the same salary the men teachers received for doing the same work,  which I think was unfair. Emily studied and frequently heard and read  about what had been done in Colorado and other States where women  vote. She got us all interested, and the more we learned about the  cause the harder we worked for it. Emily married a nice, big, railroad  man. They bought a pretty little house in a small town, had three  lovely children and were very happy. More than ever as time passed  Emily realized the need of woman's influence in the community. It is  true, I'll admit, Aunt Sarah, housekeeping and especially home-making  are the great duties of every woman, and to provide the most  wholesome, nourishing food possible for the family is the duty of  every mother, as the health, comfort and happiness of the family  depend so largely on the _common sense_ (only another name for  efficiency) and skill of the homemaker, and the wise care and though  she expends on the preparation of wholesome, nutritious food in the  home, either the work of her own hands or prepared under her  direction. You can _not_ look after these duties without getting  _outside_ of your home, especially when you live like Emily, in a  town where the conditions are so different from living as you do on a  farm in the country. Milk, bread and water are no longer controlled by  the woman in her home, living in cities and towns; and just because  women want to look out for their families they should have a voice in  the larger problems of municipal housekeeping. To return to Emily, she  did not bake her own bread, as you do, neither did she keep a cow, but  bought milk and bread to feed the children. Wasn't it her duty to  leave the home and see where these products were produced, and if they  were sanitary? And, knowing the problem outside the home would so  materially affect the health, and perhaps lives, of her children, she  felt it her distinctive duty to keep house in a larger sense. When the  children became old enough to attend school, Emily again took up her  old interest in schools. She began to realize how much more just it  would be if an equal number of women were on the school board.\"    \"But what did the husband think of all this?\" inquired Aunt Sarah,  dubiously.    \"Oh, Tom studied the case, too, at first just to tease Emily, but he  soon became as enthusiastic as Emily. He said, 'The first time you are  privileged to vote, Emily, I will hire an automobile to take you to  the polls in style.' But poor Emily was left alone with her children  last winter. Tom died of typhoid fever. Contracted it from the bad  drainage. They lived in a town not yet safeguarded with sewerage. Now  Emily is a taxpayer as well as a mother, and she has no say as far as  the town and schools are concerned. There are many cases like that,  where widows and unmarried women own property, and they are in no way  represented. And think of the thousands and thousands of women who  have no home to stay in and no babies to look after.\"    \"Mercy, Mary! Do stop to take breath. I never thought when I started  this subject I would have an enthusiastic suffragist with whom to  deal.\"    \"I am glad you started the subject, Aunt Sarah, because there is so  much to be said for the cause. I saw you glance at the clock and I see  it is time to prepare supper. But some day I'm going to stop that old  clock and bring down some of my books on 'Woman's Suffrage' and you'll  he surprised to hear what they have done in States where equal  privileges were theirs. I am sure 'twill not be many years before  every State in the Union will give women the right of suffrage.\"           *       *       *       *       *    After Mary retired that evening Aunt Sarah had a talk with her John,  whom she knew needed help on the farm. As a result of the conference,  Mary wrote to Ralph the following day, asking him to spend his  vacation on the farm as a \"farm hand.\" Needless to say, the offer was  gladly accepted by Ralph, if for no other reason than to be near the  girl he loved.    Ralph came the following week--\"a strapping big fellow,\" to quote  Uncle John, being several inches over six feet.    \"All you need, young chap,\" said Mary's Uncle, \"is plenty of good,  wholesome food of Sarah's and Mary's preparing, and I'll see that you  get plenty of exercise in the fresh air to give you an appetite to  enjoy it, and you'll get a healthy coat of tan on your pale cheeks  before the Summer is ended.\"    Ralph Jackson, or \"Jack,\" as he was usually called by his friends, an  orphan like Mary, came of good, old Quaker stock, his mother having  died immediately after giving birth to her son. His father, supposed  to be a wealthy contractor, died when Ralph was seventeen, having lost  his fortune through no fault of his own, leaving Ralph penniless.    Ralph Jackson possessed a good face, a square, determined jaw, sure  sign of a strong will and quick temper; these Berserker traits he  inherited from his father; rather unusual in a Quaker. He possessed a  head of thick, coarse, straight brown hair, and big honest eyes. One  never doubted his word, once it had been given. 'Twas good as his  bond. This trait he inherited also from his father, noted for his  truth and integrity. Ralph was generous to a fault. When a small boy  he was known to take off his shoes and give them to a poor little  Italian (who played a violin on the street for pennies) and go home  barefoot.    Ralph loved Mary devotedly, not only because she fed him well at the  farm, as were his forefathers, the \"Cave Men,\" fed by their mates in  years gone by, but he loved her first for her sweetness of disposition  and lovable ways; later, for her quiet unselfishness and lack of  temper over trifles--so different from himself.    When speaking to Mary of his other fine qualities, Aunt Sarah said:  \"Ralph is a manly young fellow; likeable, I'll admit, but his hasty  temper is a grave fault in my eyes.\"    Mary replied, \"Don't you think men are very queer, anyway, Aunt Sarah?  I do, and none of us is perfect.\"    [Illustration: RALPH JACKSON]    To Mary, Ralph's principal charm lay in his strong, forceful way of  surmounting difficulties, she having a disposition so different. Mary  had a sweet, motherly way, seldom met with in so young a girl, and  this appealed to Ralph, he having never known \"mother love,\" and  although not at all inclined to be sentimental, he always called Mary  his \"Little Mother Girl\" because of her motherly ways.    [Illustration: ROCKY VALLEY]    \"Well,\" continued Mary's Aunt, \"a quick temper is one of the most  difficult faults to overcome that flesh is heir to, but Ralph, being a  young man of uncommon good sense, may in time curb his temper and  learn to control it, knowing that unless be does so it will handicap  him in his career. Still, a young girl will overlook many faults in  the man she loves. Mary, ere marrying, one should be sure that no love  be lacking to those entering these sacred bonds. 'Tis not for a day,  but for a lifetime, to the right thinking. Marriage, as a rule, is too  lightly entered into in this Twentieth Century of easy divorces, and  but few regard matrimony in its true holy relation, ordained by our  Creator. If it be founded on the tower of enduring love and not  ephemeral passion, it is unassailable, lasting in faith and honor  until death breaks the sacred union and annuls the vows pledged at  God's holy altar.\"    \"Well,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13559"],[0,"The Backwoods of Canada (#6)"],[1,"contrast with the azure  sky and waters of the St. Laurence. The scenery of the river near  Montreal is of a very different character to that below Quebec; the  latter possesses a wild and rugged aspect, and its productions are  evidently those of a colder and less happy climate. What the former  loses in grandeur and picturesque effect, it gains in fertility of soil  and warmth of temperature. In the lower division of the province you  feel that the industry of the inhabitants is forcing a churlish soil for  bread; while in the upper, the land seems willing to yield her increase  to a moderate exertion. Remember, these are merely the cursory remarks  of a passing traveller, and founded on no personal experience.    There was a feeling of anxiety and dread upon our minds that we would  hardly acknowledge to each other as we drew near to the city of the  pestilence, as if ashamed of confessing a weakness that was felt; but no  one spoke on the subject. With what unmixed delight and admiration at  any other time should we have gazed on the scene that opened upon us.    The river here expands into a fine extensive basin, diversified with  islands, on the largest of which Montreal is situated.    The lofty hill from which the town takes its name rises like a crown  above it, and forms a singular and magnificent feature in the landscape,  reminding me of some of the detached hills in the vicinity of Inverness.    Opposite to the Quebec suburbs, just in front of the rapids, is situated  the island of St. Helens, a spot of infinite loveliness. The centre of  it is occupied by a grove of lofty trees, while the banks, sloping down  to the water, seem of the most verdant turf. The scene was heightened by  the appearance of the troops which garrison the island.    The shores of the river, studded with richly cultivated farms; the  village of La Prairie, with the little island of St. Anne's in the  distance; the glittering steeples and roofs of the city, with its  gardens and villas,--looked lovely by the softened glow of a Canadian  summer sunset.    The church bells ringing for evening prayer, with the hum of voices from  the shore, mingled not inharmoniously with the rush of the rapids.    These rapids are caused by a descent in the bed of the river. In some  places this declination is gradual, in others sudden and abrupt. Where  the current is broken by masses of limestone or granite rock, as at the  Cascades, the Cedars, and the Long Sault, it creates whirlpools and  cataracts. But the rapids below Montreal are not of this magnificent  character, being made perceptible only by the unusual swiftness of the  water, and its surface being disturbed by foam, and waving lines and  dimples. In short, I was disappointed in my expectation of seeing  something very grand; and was half angry at these pretty behaved quiet  rapids, to the foot of which we were towed in good style by our faithful  consort the _British America_.    As the captain is uncertain how long he may be detained at Montreal, I  shall send this letter without further delay, and write again as soon as  possible.          LETTER IV.

Once more on terra ferma, dearest mother: what a strange sensation it is  to tread the land once again, free from the motion of the heaving  waters, to which I was now, in truth, glad to bid farewell.    By daybreak every creature on board was up and busily preparing for  going on shore. The captain himself obligingly escorted us, and walked  as far with us as the hotel, where we are at present lodged.    We found some difficulty in getting on shore, owing to the badness of  the landing. The river was full of floating timbers, between which it  required some skill to guide the boat. A wharf is now being built--not  before it was needed*. [* Some excellent wharfs have since been  completed.]    We were struck by the dirty, narrow, ill-paved or unpaved streets of the  suburbs, and overpowered by the noisome vapour arising from a deep open  fosse that ran along the street behind the wharf. This ditch seemed the  receptacle for every abomination, and sufficient in itself to infect a  whole town with malignant fevers*.    [* This has since been arched over. A market has been erected above it.]    I was greatly disappointed in my first acquaintance with the interior of  Montreal; a place of which travellers had said so much. I could compare  it only to the fruits of the Dead sea, which are said to be fair and  tempting to look upon, but yield only ashes and bitterness when tasted  by the thirsty traveller**.    ..........    [** The following description of Montreal is given by M'Gregor in his  British America, vol. ii. p. 504:--\"Betwixt the royal mountain and the  river, on a ridge of gentle elevation, stands the town. Including the  suburbs, it is more extensive than Quebec. Both cities differ very  greatly in appearance; the low banks of the St. Laurence at Montreal  want the tremendous precipices frowning over them, and all that grand  sublimity which characterizes Quebec.    \"There are no wharfs at Montreal, and the ships and steamers lie quietly  in pretty deep water, close to the clayey and generally filthy bank of  the city. The whole of the lower town is covered with gloomy-looking  houses, having dark iron shutters; and although it may be a little  cleaner than Quebec, it is still very dirty; and the streets are not  only narrow and ill-paved, but the footpaths are interrupted by slanting  cellar doors and other projections.\"    \"It is impossible (says Mr. Talbot, in his Five Years' Residence) to  walk the streets of Montreal on a Sunday or holiday, when the shops are  closed, without receiving the most gloomy impressions; the whole city  seems one vast prison;\"--alluding to the window-shutters and outer doors  of iron, that have been adopted to counteract the effects of fire.]    ..........    I noticed one peculiar feature in the buildings along the suburb facing  the river--that they were mostly furnished with broad wooden balconies  from the lower to the upper story; in some instances they surrounded the  houses on three sides, and seemed to form a sort of outer chamber. Some  of these balconies were ascended by flights of broad stairs from the  outside.    I remember when a child dreaming of houses so constructed, and fancying  them very delightful; and so I think they might be rendered, if shaded  by climbing shrubs, and adorned with flowers, to represent a hanging-  garden or sweet-scented bowery walk. But nothing of this kind gladdened  our eyes as we toiled along the hot streets. Every house of public  resort was crowded from the top to the bottom with emigrants of all  ages, English, Irish, and Scotch. The sounds of riotous merriment that  burst from them seemed but ill-assorted with the haggard, careworn faces  of many of the thoughtless revellers.    The contrast was only too apparent and too painful a subject to those  that looked upon this show of outward gaiety and inward misery.    The cholera had made awful ravages, and its devastating effects were to  be seen in the darkened dwellings and the mourning habiliments of all  classes. An expression of dejection and anxiety appeared in the faces of  the few persons we encountered in our walk to the hotel, which plainly  indicated the state of their minds.    In some situations whole streets had been nearly depopulated; those that  were able fled panic-stricken to the country villages, while others  remained to die in the bosom of their families.    To no class, I am told, has the disease proved so fatal as to the poorer  sort of emigrants. Many of these, debilitated by the privations and  fatigue of a long voyage, on reaching Quebec or Montreal indulged in  every sort of excess, especially the dangerous one of intoxication; and,  as if purposely paving the way to certain destruction, they fell  immediate victims to the complaint.    In one house eleven persons died, in another seventeen; a little child  of seven years old was the only creature left to tell the woful tale.  This poor desolate orphan was taken by the nuns to their benevolent  institution, where every attention was paid that humanity could suggest.    The number both of Catholic and Protestant benevolent societies is very  great, and these are maintained with a liberality of principle that does  honour to both parties, who seem indeed actuated by a fervent spirit of  Christian charity.    I know of no place, not even excepting London itself, where the exercise  of benevolent feelings is more called for than in these two cities,  Quebec and Montreal. Here meet together the unfortunate, the  improvident, the helpless orphan, the sick, the aged, the poor virtuous  man, driven by the stern hand of necessity from his country and his  home, perhaps to be overtaken by sickness or want in a land of  strangers.    It is melancholy to reflect that a great number of the poorest class of  emigrants that perished in the reign of the cholera have left no trace  by which their sorrowing anxious friends in the old country may learn  their fate. The disease is so sudden and so violent that it leaves no  time for arranging worldly matters; the sentinel comes, not as it did to  Hezekiah, \"Set thine house "]]]
