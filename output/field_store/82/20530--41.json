Little Sagastao generally spent his  hour, either with his father or some trusty Indian, playing with and  watching the gambols of the great dogs, of which not a few were kept at  that mission home. Minnehaha was with her mother, and was interested in the  bestowal of gifts to the poor widows and children who generally came at  that hour.    Owing to the isolated situation of the mission, and the fact that there  were no organized schools within hundreds of miles, some hours of the  forenoon were devoted to the education of the children in the home. The  afternoons, according to the season, were devoted to reading and amusement.    Mary, the nurse, while able to read fluently in the Cree syllabics, had no  knowledge of English. As the children's education progressed they wanted to  teach Mary. She stubbornly resisted, however, declaring that if they taught  her to read English they would want to make her talk it.    The mother noted the unusual expectancy manifested by the children during  the day, and on inquiring the reason was promptly informed that Mary had  promised to tell them a story, or legend, and \"had got to do it.\"    \"Why has she _got_ to do it?\" said the loving mother, struck with the  emphasis which they had placed on the word.    The little mischiefs were cunning enough to see that they had nearly run  themselves into trouble, and were wisely silent. Mary also noticed this,  and at once her great loyalty to the little folk manifested itself, and  quickly turning to her mistress she said, with an emphasis which was quite  unusual:    \"Mary has promised them a story, and as she always keeps her word she has  _got_ to tell it.\"    Saying this she quickly sprang from the floor, where she had been sitting,  and taking a child by each hand she marched with them out of the room.    \"Hurrah for you, Mary! you saved us that time,\" said little Sagastao.    Mary would not have been sorry if in some way the parents received an  inkling of what was in the minds of the children, yet she had such peculiar  ideas that she would never herself be the one to convey that information.    During the brief summer months the pleasantest walks were along the shores  of the lake. Many were the cosy little cave-like retreats where Mary often  led the children. There, with the sunlit waters before them, and the  rippling waves making music at their feet, the old nurse crooned out many  an Indian legend or exciting story about the red men of the past. To-day,  however, she was perplexed by the attitude of the children and could not  select any story that she thought of sufficient interest to divert their  minds from Souwanas and Nanahboozhoo. So for a time they wandered on along  the pleasant shore, or turned aside to gather the brilliant wild flowers.    A scream of pain from Minnehaha interrupted their pleasure. In gathering  some wild lilies she was stung on both hands by some honey bees that were  in the flowers. Mary quickly made a batter of clay and bound up the wounded  hands in it. Then she sat down and took the child in her lap.    \"Naughty bees to sting me like this,\" said Minnehaha, with tears streaming  down her cheeks. \"I was not doing them any harm.\"    \"Yes, you were, and so were we all,\" said the brother. \"We were carrying  off the flowers from which they get their honey, which is their food.\"    \"Well, they might let us have a few flowers without stinging us,\" replied  Minnehaha.    The intense pain of the stings rapidly abated under Mary's homely but  skillful treatment, and as the child still retained her place in Mary's lap  she said,    \"Can you tell us why such pretty little things as bees have such terrible  stings? My hands felt as if they were on fire when I was first stung, and I  could not help crying out with the pain.\"    \"Well,\" said Mary, \"there was a time when the bees had no stings, and they  were as harmless as the house flies. They were just as industrious as they  are now, but they had any amount of trouble in keeping their honey from  being stolen from them, for every creature loves it.    \"In vain they hid their combs away up in hollow trees and in the clefts of  high rocks. The bears, which are very fond of honey, were ever on the  lookout for it, and were very clever in getting it when once they found  where it was hidden away. Birds with long beaks would suck it out, and even  the little squirrels were always stealing it. The result was that whole  swarms often starved in the long winters, because all their honey, which is  their winter food, was stolen from them. The bees were in danger of being  destroyed. They gave up working in great numbers together, and scattered  into little companies, and in the most secret places tried to store away a  little honey, just enough to keep them alive from season to season. But  even these little hives were often discovered and the honey devoured.    \"Things had come to such a pass with them that they had almost given up  hope of lasting much longer.    \"Fortunately for them, word was circulated that Wakonda, the strong  spirit--the one who sent the mosquitoes--was coming around on a tour, to  see how everything was progressing. He was greater than even Nanahboozhoo,  and was perhaps a relative of his, but he very seldom appeared, or did  anything for anyone. However, it happened that he had this year left his  beautiful home at Spirit Lake and was journeying through the country, and  he was willing to help all who were in real distress.    \"So the bees resolved to apply to him for help. Wakonda received them very  graciously, and ate heartily of the present of beautiful honey which some  of them had made and had succeeded in keeping out of the way of bears and  their other enemies.    \"When his feast of honey was over he listened to their tales of sorrow and  woe. He was indignant when he heard of the numbers of their enemies, and of  the persistency of their attacks upon such industrious little creatures.    \"For a time Wakonda was uncertain as to the best method to adopt to help  them. He dismissed them for that day, and told them to come again on a day  he mentioned, saying that by that time he would know just what to do--for  help them he would. The bees were so delighted with this news that they  could not keep it to themselves but must go and tell their cousins, the  wasps and hornets, and even bumblebees.    \"When the appointed time arrived the bees were on hand--and so were the  wasps, hornets, and bumblebees. Wakonda welcomed the bees most kindly, but  was a little suspicious about their visitors, and he asked some sharp  questions. But the bees were in such good humor about the help that was  coming that they did not refer to the bad habits of their cousins at all.  Then Wakonda made a speech to the bees, and told them how much he loved  them for their industrious habits, which he wished all creatures had. He  praised them for the fact that, instead of idly wasting the summer days,  they used them in gathering up food for the long, cold winter.    \"Then he proceeded to give them the terrible stings which they have had  ever since, and as the wasps and hornets claimed to be their cousins  Wakonda was good-natured enough to give them the same sort of weapons.  Some people, especially boys, think this was a, great mistake, and would be  very glad if Wakonda had refused to give stings to the yellow wasp and the  black hornet.\"    \"Well, what happened after the bees got their stings?\" said Sagastao.    \"A good deal happened,\" said Mary, \"and that very soon. A lot of them,  without as much effort to conceal their nest as formerly, selected a tall,  hollow tree, and using a big knot hole as the door began secreting their  honey in it. They had made the combs, and were now filling them, when along  came a couple of bears. These animals, as you have been told, are great  honey thieves, but they always had hard work to find where the timid bees  had cunningly hid it away, and now they could hardly believe that right  here before them was a great swarm of bees filling the air with their  buzzing as they flew in and out of the knot hole.    \"With saucy assurance they at once began climbing the tree, expecting to be  able to put their long paws into that big hole and draw out the combs. But  they never reached that knot hole. The noise they made in their climbing  alarmed the bees. Out they came in great numbers, and now, instead of  flying around in a panic, like so many house flies, and seeing their honey  devoured, they at once flew at their enemies, the bears. They stung them on  their noses and about their eyes and lips, and indeed in every spot where  they could possibly reach them with their terrible new weapons.    \"The bears could not make out what the trouble was. They howled with rage  and terror, yet they were resolved to get that honey, and still tried to  crawl up higher on the tree. But at length the bees mustered in such vast  numbers--for those away gathering honey, as they returned, joined in the  attack--that the bears became wild with pain and fear, and had to give up  their effort and drop to the ground. Even then the bees gave them no peace,  and continued to sting them until they were obliged to run into the dark  forest for relief.    \"Thus it happens now that almost all creatures that bother the bees are  similarly treated.\"    [Illustration: \"They howled with rage and terror.\"]    \"Well,\" said Minnehaha, \"they need not have stung me because I was picking  a few flowers; but, after all, I am glad they have their stings or I  suppose we should never have any honey.\"    \"They are not big enough to have much sense,\" replied Sagastao, \"and so  they go for everyone that gets in their way.\"    Mary now carefully removed the clay poultices, which had effectually done  their work. A wash followed, in the waters of the lake which rippled at  their feet, and soon not the slightest trace of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10897"],[0,"The Wendigo (#6)"],[1,"the  helpless prey of anything that chose to happen. Had a muskrat poked its  pointed muzzle over a rock, or a squirrel scuttled in that instant down  the bark of a tree, he would most likely have collapsed without more ado  and fainted. For he felt about the whole affair the touch somewhere of a  great Outer Horror ... and his scattered powers had not as yet had time  to collect themselves into a definite attitude of fighting self-control.    Nothing did happen, however. A great kiss of wind ran softly through the  awakening forest, and a few maple leaves here and there rustled  tremblingly to earth. The sky seemed to grow suddenly much lighter.  Simpson felt the cool air upon his cheek and uncovered head; realized  that he was shivering with the cold; and, making a great effort,  realized next that he was alone in the Bush--_and_ that he was called  upon to take immediate steps to find and succor his vanished companion.    Make an effort, accordingly, he did, though an ill-calculated and futile  one. With that wilderness of trees about him, the sheet of water cutting  him off behind, and the horror of that wild cry in his blood, he did  what any other inexperienced man would have done in similar  bewilderment: he ran about, without any sense of direction, like a  frantic child, and called loudly without ceasing the name of the guide:    \"Defago! Defago! Defago!\" he yelled, and the trees gave him back the  name as often as he shouted, only a little softened--\"Defago! Defago!  Defago!\"    He followed the trail that lay a short distance across the patches of  snow, and then lost it again where the trees grew too thickly for snow  to lie. He shouted till he was hoarse, and till the sound of his own  voice in all that unanswering and listening world began to frighten him.  His confusion increased in direct ratio to the violence of his efforts.  His distress became formidably acute, till at length his exertions  defeated their own object, and from sheer exhaustion he headed back to  the camp again. It remains a wonder that he ever found his way. It was  with great difficulty, and only after numberless false clues, that he at  last saw the white tent between the trees, and so reached safety.    Exhaustion then applied its own remedy, and he grew calmer. He made the  fire and breakfasted. Hot coffee and bacon put a little sense and  judgment into him again, and he realized that he had been behaving like  a boy. He now made another, and more successful attempt to face the  situation collectedly, and, a nature naturally plucky coming to his  assistance, he decided that he must first make as thorough a search as  possible, failing success in which, he must find his way into the home  camp as best he could and bring help.    And this was what he did. Taking food, matches and rifle with him, and a  small axe to blaze the trees against his return journey, he set forth.  It was eight o'clock when he started, the sun shining over the tops of  the trees in a sky without clouds. Pinned to a stake by the fire he left  a note in case Defago returned while he was away.    This time, according to a careful plan, he took a new direction,  intending to make a wide sweep that must sooner or later cut into  indications of the guide's trail; and, before he had gone a quarter of a  mile he came across the tracks of a large animal in the snow, and beside  it the light and smaller tracks of what were beyond question human  feet--the feet of Defago. The relief he at once experienced was natural,  though brief; for at first sight he saw in these tracks a simple  explanation of the whole matter: these big marks had surely been left by  a bull moose that, wind against it, had blundered upon the camp, and  uttered its singular cry of warning and alarm the moment its mistake was  apparent. Defago, in whom the hunting instinct was developed to the  point of uncanny perfection, had scented the brute coming down the wind  hours before. His excitement and disappearance were due, of course,  to--to his--    Then the impossible explanation at which he grasped faded, as common  sense showed him mercilessly that none of this was true. No guide, much  less a guide like Defago, could have acted in so irrational a way, going  off even without his rifle ...! The whole affair demanded a far more  complicated elucidation, when he remembered the details of it all--the  cry of terror, the amazing language, the grey face of horror when his  nostrils first caught the new odor; that muffled sobbing in the  darkness, and--for this, too, now came back to him dimly--the man's  original aversion for this particular bit of country....    Besides, now that he examined them closer, these were not the tracks of  a bull moose at all! Hank had explained to him the outline of a bull's  hoofs, of a cow's or calf's, too, for that matter; he had drawn them  clearly on a strip of birch bark. And these were wholly different. They  were big, round, ample, and with no pointed outline as of sharp hoofs.  He wondered for a moment whether bear tracks were like that. There was  no other animal he could think of, for caribou did not come so far  south at this season, and, even if they did, would leave hoof marks.    They were ominous signs--these mysterious writings left in the snow by  the unknown creature that had lured a human being away from safety--and  when he coupled them in his imagination with that haunting sound that  broke the stillness of the dawn, a momentary dizziness shook his mind,  distressing him again beyond belief. He felt the _threatening_ aspect of  it all. And, stooping down to examine the marks more closely, he caught  a faint whiff of that sweet yet pungent odor that made him instantly  straighten up again, fighting a sensation almost of nausea.    Then his memory played him another evil trick. He suddenly recalled  those uncovered feet projecting beyond the edge of the tent, and the  body's appearance of having been dragged towards the opening; the man's  shrinking from something by the door when he woke later. The details now  beat against his trembling mind with concerted attack. They seemed to  gather in those deep spaces of the silent forest about him, where the  host of trees stood waiting, listening, watching to see what he would  do. The woods were closing round him.    With the persistence of true pluck, however, Simpson went forward,  following the tracks as best he could, smothering these ugly emotions  that sought to weaken his will. He blazed innumerable trees as he went,  ever fearful of being unable to find the way back, and calling aloud at  intervals of a few seconds the name of the guide. The dull tapping of  the axe upon the massive trunks, and the unnatural accents of his own  voice became at length sounds that he even dreaded to make, dreaded to  hear. For they drew attention without ceasing to his presence and exact  whereabouts, and if it were really the case that something was hunting  himself down in the same way that he was hunting down another--    With a strong effort, he crushed the thought out the instant it rose.  It was the beginning, he realized, of a bewilderment utterly diabolical  in kind that would speedily destroy him.           *       *       *       *       *    Although the snow was not continuous, lying merely in shallow flurries  over the more open spaces, he found no difficulty in following the  tracks for the first few miles. They went straight as a ruled line  wherever the trees permitted. The stride soon began to increase in  length, till it finally assumed proportions that seemed absolutely  impossible for any ordinary animal to have made. Like huge flying leaps  they became. One of these he measured, and though he knew that \"stretch\"  of eighteen feet must be somehow wrong, he was at a complete loss to  understand why he found no signs on the snow between the extreme points.  But what perplexed him even more, making him feel his vision had gone  utterly awry, was that Defago's stride increased in the same manner, and  finally covered the same incredible distances. It looked as if the great  beast had lifted him with it and carried him across these astonishing  intervals. Simpson, who was much longer in the limb, found that he could  not compass even half the stretch by taking a running jump.    And the sight of these huge tracks, running side by side, silent  evidence of a dreadful journey in which terror or madness had urged to  impossible results, was profoundly moving. It shocked him in the secret  depths of his soul. It was the most horrible thing his eyes had ever  looked upon. He began to follow them mechanically, absentmindedly  almost, ever peering over his shoulder to see if he, too, were being  followed by something with a gigantic tread.... And soon it came about  that he no longer quite realized what it was they signified--these  impressions left upon the snow by something nameless and untamed, always  accompanied by the footmarks of the little French Canadian, his guide,  his comrade, the man who had shared his tent a few hours before,  chatting, laughing, even singing by his side....          V      For a man of his years and inexperience, only a canny Scot, perhaps,  grounded in common sense and established in logic, could have preserved  even that measure of balance that this youth somehow or other did manage  to preserve through the whole adventure. Otherwise, two things he  presently noticed, while forging pluckily ahead, must have sent him  headlong back to the comparative safety of his tent, instead of only  making his hands close more tightly upon the rifle stock, while his  heart, trained for the Wee Kirk, sent a wordless prayer winging its way  to heaven. Both tracks, he saw, had undergone a change, and this change,  so far as it concerned the footsteps of the man, was in some  undecipherable manner--appalling.    It was in the bigger tracks he first noticed this, and for a long"]]]
