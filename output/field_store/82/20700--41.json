[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14012"],[0,"Ice-Caves of France and Switzerland (#6)"],[1,"deg.; a difference so remarkable, at the same horizontal level, that  I am inclined to doubt the accuracy of the figures, though they were  registered on the spot with due care. The uncovered hole, it must be  remembered, is so large, and so completely open, that the rain falls  freely on to the stones on the floor below.    By far the most striking part of this glaciere is the north-west  wall, which is covered with a sheet of ice 70 feet long, and 22 feet  high at the highest part: in the neighbourhood of the ladders, this  turns the corner of the cave, and passes up for about 9 feet under the  second ladder. The general thickness of the sheet is from a foot to a  foot and a half; and this is the chief source from which the _fermier_  draws the ice, as it is much more easily quarried than the solid  floor. Some of my friends went to the cave a few weeks after my visit,  and found that the whole sheet had been pared off and carried away. On  some parts of the wall the sheet was not completely continuous, being  formed of broad and distinct cascades, connected by cross channels of  ice, and uniting at their upper and lower ends, thus presenting many  curious and ornamental groupings. On cutting through this ice, it was  found not to lie closely on the rock, a small intermediate space being  generally left, almost filled with minute limestone particles in a  very wet state; and the whole cavern showed signs of more or less  thaw.    [Illustration: THE GLACIERE OF S. GEORGES. VERTICAL SECTIONS OF THE  GLACIERE OF S. GEORGES.]    It was natural to examine the structure of the ice in this glaciere,  after what we had observed on La Genolliere. The same prismatic  structure was universal in the sheet on the wall, and in the blocks  which lay here and there on the floor and formed the sole remains of  former columns. It was to be observed also in many parts of the  ice-floor itself. The base of one large column still remained standing  in its original position, and its upper end presented a tolerably  accurate horizontal section of the column. The centre was composed of  turbid ice, round which limpid prisms were horizontally arranged,  diverging like the feathers of a fan; then came a ring of turbid ice,  and then a second concentric ring of limpid prisms, diverging in the  same manner as those which formed the inner ring. There were in all  three or four of these concentric rings, the details showing a  considerable amount of confusion and interference: the general law,  however, was most evident, and has held in all the similar columns which  I have since examined in other glacieres. The rings were not accurately  circular, but presented rather the appearance of having been formed  round a roughly-fluted pillar on an elliptical base.    The examination of the ice on the wall gave some curious results. The  horizontal arrangement of the prisms, which we had found to prevail in  vertical columns, was here modified to suit the altered conditions of  the case, and the axes of the prisms changed their inclination so as to  be always perpendicular to the surface on which the ice lay, as far as  could be determined by the eye. Thus, in following the many changes of  inclination of the wall, the axes of the prisms stood at many different  angles with the vertical, from a horizontal position where the wall  chanced to be vertical, to a vertical position on the horizontal ledges  of the rock. The extreme edges, too, of the ice, presented a very  peculiar appearance. The general thickness, as has been said, varied  from a foot to a foot and a half; and this diminished gradually along  horizontal lines, till, at the edges of the sheet, where the ice ceased,  it became of course nothing. The extreme edge was formed of globular or  hemispherical beads of ice, like the freezing of a sweating-stone, lying  so loosely on the rock that I could sweep them off in detail with one  hand, and catch them with the other as they fell. Passing farther on  towards the thicker parts of the ice, these beads stood up higher and  higher, losing their roundness, and becoming compressed into prisms of  all shapes, in very irregular imitation of the cellular tissue in  plants, the axes of the prisms following the generally-observed law.  There seems to be nothing in this phenomenon which cannot be accounted  for by the supposition of gradual thaw of small amount being applied to  a sheet of prismatic ice.    One fact was remarkable from its universal appearance. Wherever an  incision was made in this sheet of ice, the prisms snapped off at the  depth of an inch, and could be mowed down like corn by means of a stout  knife. Although they broke naturally at this constant depth, and left a  surface of limpid ice without any signs of external or internal  division, still the laminae obtained by chiselling this lower surface  carefully, broke up regularly into the shapes to be expected in sections  of prisms cut at right angles to the axis. The roughness of my  instruments made it impossible to discover how far this extended, and  whether it ceased to be the case at any given depth in the ice.    The sea of ice on the floor was in a very wet state at the surface,  being at a lower level than the stones on to which the rain from the  open hole fell; and here the prismatic structure was not apparent to the  eye, nor do I know whether it existed at all. In the Glaciere of La  Genolliere I carried a large block of perfectly prismatic ice into the  outer cave, where it was exposed to the free currents of air passing  from the pit of entrance to the hole newly opened by the falling in of  the ground; and, two days after, the external lines were scarcely  perceptible, while on the occasion of our third visit I found that they  had entirely disappeared, and the whole block was rapidly following  their example. This disappearance of the surface-lines under the action  of atmospheric thaw is probably the same thing as their absence when the  flooring of ice is thinly covered with water. Wherever the flooring rose  slightly towards the edges of the sea of ice, the usual structure  appeared again.    There were no currents of air in the cave, the candles burning steadily  through the whole time of our visit. Excepting for the purpose of  detecting disturbance in the air, there is no need of candles, as the  two holes in the roof supply sufficient light. Some account of the  careful observations made here by M. Thury, at different seasons of the  year, will be found in other parts of this book. We passed, on our  return, by the source of water which springs from the foot of a rock at  some distance from the glaciere, and is supposed to form the outlet for  the drainage of the cave; but it is difficult to understand how this can  be the case, considering the form and character of the intervening  ground.    The two ice-caves so far described are the least interesting of all that  I have visited; but a peasant informed me, a day or two after, that if  we had penetrated to the back of the pyramid of snow which lay half  under the open hole, being the remains of the large collection which is  formed there in the winter, we might have found a deep pit which is  sometimes exposed by the melting of the snow. He had some idea that its  depth was 30 feet a few years ago, and that its sides were solid ice. I  shall have occasion to mention such pits in another glaciere; if one  does exist here, it has probably been quarried in the ice by the drops  from the hole in the roof, and there might be some interest attached to  an attempt to investigate it.[17]    We reached S. Georges again in a wretched state of wet and cold, and  Renaud went off to bed, and imbibed abundant and super-abundant  kirsch,--at least, when drawn thence the next morning, his manner left  no doubt about either the fact or the abundance of the potations  overnight. Warned by many experiences, I had gone no nearer to a  specification of the bill of fare than a vague suggestion that  _quelque chose_ must be forthcoming, with an additional stipulation  that this must be something more than mere onions and fat. The  landlady's rendering of _quelque chose_ was very agreeable, but, for  the benefit of future diners _au Cavalier_, it is as well to say that  those who do not like anisette had better make a private arrangement  with their hostess, otherwise they will swallow with their soup an  amount sufficient for many generations of the drag: they may also  safely order savoury rice, with browned veal and wine-sauce, which is  evidently a strong point with the Cavalier. All meals there are  picturesque; for the omelette lay on the Castle of Grandson and a part  of the Lake of Neufchatel, while the butter reposed on the ruined  Cathedral of Sion, and the honey distilled pleasantly from the comb on  to the walls of Wufflens. No one should put any trust in the spoons,  which are constructed apparently of pewter shavings in a chronic state  of semi-fusion. On the evening of the second day, the landlady allowed  a second knife at tea, as the knife-of-all-work had begun to knock up  under the heavy strain upon its powers; but this supplementary  instrument was of the ornamental kind, and, like other ornamental  things, broke down at a crisis, which took the form of a piece of  crust.    Lest this account should raise anyone's expectations too high, it is as  well to add that they have no snuffers in S. Georges, beyond such as  Nature provided when she gave men fingers; and they burn attenuated  tallow candles with full-bodied wicks. Also, the tea is flavoured with  vanille, unless that precious flavouring is omitted by private contract.

TO SEPTIMUS.      Septimus, who art ready to go with me, even to Gades, and to the  Cantabrian, still untaught to bear our yoke, and the inhospitable  Syrtes, where the Mauritanian wave perpetually boils. O may Tibur,  founded by a Grecian colony, be the habitation of my old age! There let  there be an end to my fatigues by sea, and land, and war; whence if the  cruel fates debar me, I will seek the river of Galesus, delightful for  sheep covered with skins, and the countries reigned over by  Lacedaemonian Phalantus. That corner of the world smiles in my eye  beyond all others; where the honey yields not to the Hymettian, and the  olive rivals the verdant Venafrian: where the temperature of the air  produces a long spring and mild winters, and Aulon friendly to the  fruitful vine, envies not the Falernian grapes. That place, and those  blest heights, solicit you and me; there you shall bedew the glowing  ashes of your poet friend with a tear due [to his memory].           *       *       *       *       *        ODE VII.    TO POMPEIUS VARUS.      O thou, often reduced with me to the last extremity in the war which  Brutus carried on, who has restored thee as a Roman citizen, to the gods  of thy country and the Italian air, Pompey, thou first of my companions;  with whom I have frequently broken the tedious day in drinking, having  my hair, shining with the Syrian maiobathrum, crowned [with flowers]!  Together with thee did I experience the [battle of] Phillippi and a  precipitate flight, having shamefully enough left my shield; when valor  was broken, and the most daring smote the squalid earth with their  faces. But Mercury swift conveyed me away, terrified as I was, in a  thick cloud through the midst of the enemy. Thee the reciprocating sea,  with his tempestuous waves, bore back again to war. Wherefore render to  Jupiter the offering that is due, and deposit your limbs, wearied with a  tedious war, under my laurel, and spare not the casks reserved for you.  Fill up the polished bowls with care-dispelling Massic: pour out the  perfumed ointments from the capacious shells. Who takes care to quickly  weave the chaplets of fresh parsely or myrtle? Whom shall the Venus  pronounce to be master of the revel? In wild carouse I will become  frantic as the Bacchanalians. 'Tis delightful to me to play the madman,  on the reception of my friends.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE VIII.    TO BARINE.      If any punishment, Barine, for your violated oath had ever been of  prejudice to you: if you had become less agreeable by the blackness of a  single tooth or nail, I might believe you. But you no sooner have bound  your perfidious head with vows, but you shine out more charming by far,  and come forth the public care of our youth. It is of advantage to you  to deceive the buried ashes of your mother, and the silent  constellations of the night, together with all heaven, and the gods free  from chill death. Venus herself, I profess, laughs at this; the  good-natured nymphs laugh, and cruel Cupid, who is perpetually  sharpening his burning darts on a bloody whetstone. Add to this, that  all our boys are growing up for you; a new herd of slaves is growing up;  nor do the former ones quit the house of their impious mistress,  notwithstanding they often have threatened it. The matrons are in dread  of you on account of their young ones; the thrifty old men are in dread  of you; and the girls but just married are in distress, lest your beauty  should slacken [the affections of] their husbands.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE IX.    TO TITUS VALGIUS.      Showers do not perpetually pour down upon the rough fields, nor do  varying hurricanes forever harass the Caspian Sea; nor, my friend  Valgius, does the motionless ice remain fixed throughout all the months,  in the regions of Armenia; nor do the Garganian oaks [always] labor  under the northerly winds, nor are the ash-trees widowed of their  leaves. But thou art continually pursuing Mystes, who is taken from  thee, with mournful measures: nor do the effects of thy love for him  cease at the rising of Vesper, or when he flies the rapid approach of  the sun. But the aged man who lived three generations, did not lament  the amiable Antilochus all the years of his life: nor did his parents or  his Trojan sisters perpetually bewail the blooming Troilus. At length  then desist from thy tender complaints; and rather let us sing the fresh  trophies of Augustus Caesar, and the Frozen Niphates, and the river  Medus, added to the vanquished nations, rolls more humble tides, and the  Gelonians riding within a prescribed boundary in a narrow tract of land.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE X.    TO LICINIUS MURENA.      O Licinius, you will lead a more correct course of life, by neither  always pursuing the main ocean, nor, while you cautiously are in dread  of storms, by pressing too much upon the hazardous shore. Whosoever  loves the golden mean, is secure from the sordidness of an antiquated  cell, and is too prudent to have a palace that might expose him to  envy, if the lofty pine is more frequently agitated with winds, and high  towers fall down with a heavier ruin, and lightnings strike the summits  of the mountains. A well-provided breast hopes in adversity, and fears  in prosperity. 'Tis the same Jupiter, that brings the hideous winters  back, and that takes them away. If it is ill with us now, it will not be  so hereafter. Apollo sometimes rouses the silent lyric muse, neither  does he always bend his bow. In narrow circumstances appear in high  spirits, and undaunted. In the same manner you will prudently contract  your sails, which are apt to be too much swollen in a prosperous gale.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XI.    TO QUINTIUS HIRPINUS.      O Quintius Hirpinus, forbear to be inquisitive what the Cantabrian, and  the Scythian, divided from us by the interposed Adriatic, is meditating;  neither be fearfully solicitous for the necessaries of a life, which  requires but a few things. Youth and beauty fly swift away, while  sapless old age expels the wanton loves and gentle sleep. The same glory  does not always remain to the vernal flowers, nor does the ruddy moon  shine with one continued aspect; why, therefore, do you fatigue you  mind, unequal to eternal projects? Why do we not rather (while it is in  our power) thus carelessly reclining under a lofty plane-tree, or this  pine, with our hoary locks made fragrant by roses, and anointed with  Syrian perfume, indulge ourselves with generous wine? Bacchus dissipates  preying cares. What slave is here, instantly to cool some cups of ardent  Falernian in the passing stream? Who will tempt the vagrant wanton Lyde  from her house? See that you bid her hasten with her ivory lyre,  collecting her hair into a graceful knot, after the fashion of a Spartan  maid.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XII.    TO MAECENAS.      Do not insist that the long wars of fierce Numantia, or the formidable  Annibal, or the Sicilian Sea impurpled with Carthaginian blood, should  be adapted to the tender lays of the lyre: nor the cruel Lapithae, nor  Hylaeus excessive in wine and the earth born youths, subdued by  Herculean force, from whom the splendid habitation of old Saturn dreaded  danger. And you yourself, Maecenas, with more propriety shall recount  the battles of Caesar, and the necks of haughty kings led in triumph  through the streets in historical prose. It was the muse's will that I  should celebrate the sweet strains of my mistress Lycimnia, that I  should celebrate her bright darting eyes, and her breast laudably  faithful to mutual love: who can with a grace introduce her foot into  the dance, or, sporting, contend in raillery, or join arms with the  bright virgins on the celebrated Diana's festival. Would you,  [Maecenas,] change one of Lycimnia's tresses for all the rich Achaemenes  possessed, or the Mygdonian wealth of fertile Phrygia, or all the  dwellings of the Arabians replete with treasures? Especially when she  turns her neck to meet your burning kisses, or with a gentle cruelty  denies, what she would more delight to have ravished than the  petitioner--or sometimes eagerly anticipates to snatch them her self.           *       *       *       *       *        ODE XIII.    TO A TREE.      O tree, he planted thee on an unlucky day whoever did it first, and with  an impious hand raised thee for the destruction of posterity, and the  scandal of the village. I could believe that he had broken his own  father's neck, and stained his most secret apartments with the midnight  blood of his guest. He was wont to handle Colchian poisons, and whatever  wickedness is anywhere conceived, who planted in my field thee, a sorry  log; thee, ready to fall on the head of thy inoffensive master. What we  ought to be aware of, no man is sufficiently cautious at all hours. The  Carthaginian sailor thoroughly dreads the Bosphorus; nor, beyond"]]]
