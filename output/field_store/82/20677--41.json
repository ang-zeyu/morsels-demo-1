We got rich by pursuing our own  immediate advantage instinctively; that is, with a natural childish  selfishness; and when any question of our justification arose, we found  it easy to silence it with any sort of plausible twaddle (provided it  flattered us, and did not imply any trouble or sacrifice) provided by  our curates at L70 a year, or our journalists at a penny a line, or  commercial moralists with axes to grind. In the end we became fatheaded,  and not only lost all intellectual consciousness of what we were doing,  and with it all power of objective self-criticism, but stacked up a  lumber of pious praises for ourselves which not only satisfied our  corrupted and half atrophied consciences, but gave us a sense that there  is something extraordinarily ungentlemanly and politically dangerous in  bringing these pious phrases to the test of conduct. We carried Luther's  doctrine of Justification by Faith to the insane point of believing that  as long as a man says what we have agreed to accept as the right thing  it does not matter in the least what he actually does. In fact, we do  not clearly see why a man need introduce the subject of morals at all,  unless there is something questionable to be whitewashed. The  unprejudiced foreigner calls this hypocrisy: that is why we call him  prejudiced. But I, who have been a poor man in a poor country,  understand the foreigner better.    Now from the general to the particular. In describing the course of the  diplomatic negotiations by which our Foreign Office achieved its design  of at last settling accounts with Germany at the most favourable moment  from the Militarist point of view, I shall have to exhibit our Secretary  of State for Foreign Affairs as behaving almost exactly as we have  accused the Kaiser of behaving. Yet I see him throughout as an honest  gentleman, \"perplexed in the extreme,\" meaning well, revolted at the  last moment by the horror of war, clinging to the hope that in some  vague way he could persuade everybody to be reasonable if they would  only come and talk to him as they did when the big Powers were kept out  of the Balkan war, but hopelessly destitute of a positive policy of any  kind, and therefore unable to resist those who had positive business in  hand. And do not for a moment imagine that I think that the conscious  Sir Edward Grey was Othello, and the subconscious, Iago. I do think that  the Foreign Office, of which Sir Edward is merely the figure head, was  as deliberately and consciously bent on a long deferred Militarist war  with Germany as the Admiralty was; and that is saying a good deal. If  Sir Edward Grey did not know what he wanted, Mr. Winston Churchill was  in no such perplexity. He was not an \"ist\" of any sort, but a  straightforward holder of the popular opinion that if you are threatened  you should hit out, unless you are afraid to. Had he had the conduct of  the affair he might quite possibly have averted the war (and thereby  greatly disappointed himself and the British public) by simply  frightening the Kaiser. As it was, he had arranged for the co-operation  of the French and British fleets; was spoiling for the fight; and must  have restrained himself with great difficulty from taking off his coat  in public whilst Mr. Asquith and Sir Edward Grey were giving the country  the assurances which were misunderstood to mean that we were not bound  to go to war, and not more likely to do so than usual. But though Sir  Edward did not clear up the misunderstanding, I think he went to war  with the heavy heart of a Junker Liberal (such centaurs exist) and not  with the exultation of a Junker Jingo.    I may now, without more than the irreducible minimum of injustice to Sir  Edward Grey, proceed to tell the story of the diplomatic negotiations as  they will appear to the Congress which, I am assuming, will settle the  terms on which Europe is to live more or less happily ever after.    *Diplomatic History of the War.*    The evidence of how the Junker diplomatists of our Foreign Office let us  in for the war is in the White Paper, Miscellaneous No. 6 (1914),  containing correspondence respecting the European crisis, and since  reissued, with a later White Paper and some extra matter, as a penny  bluebook in miniature. In these much-cited and little-read documents we  see the Junkers of all the nations, the men who have been saying for  years \"It's bound to come,\" and clamouring in England for compulsory  military service and expeditionary forces, momentarily staggered and not  a little frightened by the sudden realization that it has come at last.  They rush round from foreign office to embassy, and from embassy to  palace, twittering \"This is awful. Can't you stop it? Won't you be  reasonable? Think of the consequences,\" etc., etc. One man among them  keeps his head and looks the facts in the face. That man is Sazonoff,  the Russian Secretary for Foreign Affairs. He keeps steadily trying to  make Sir Edward Grey face the inevitable. He says and reiterates, in  effect, \"You know very well that you cannot keep out of a European war.  You know you are pledged to fight Germany if Germany attacks France. You  know that your arrangments for the fight are actually made; that already  the British army is commanded by a Franco-British Council of War; that  there is no possible honourable retreat for you. You know that this old  man in Austria, who would have been superannuated years ago if he had  been an exciseman, is resolved to make war on Servia, and sent that  silly forty-eight hours ultimatum when we were all out of town so that  he could begin fighting before we could get back to sit on his head. You  know that he has the Jingo mob of Vienna behind him. You know that if he  makes war, Russia must mobilize. You know that France is bound to come  in with us as you are with France. You know that the moment we mobilize,  Germany, the old man's ally, will have only one desperate chance of  victory, and that is to overwhelm our ally, France, with one superb rush  of her millions, and then sweep back and meet us on the Vistula. You  know that nothing can stop this except Germany remonstrating with  Austria, and insisting on the Servian case being dealt with by an  international tribunal and not by war. You know that Germany dares not  do this, because her alliance with Austria is her defence against the  Franco-Russian alliance, and that she does not want to do it in any  case, because the Kaiser naturally has a strong class prejudice against  the blowing up of Royal personages by irresponsible revolutionists, and  thinks nothing too bad for Servia after the assassination of the  Archduke. There is just one chance of avoiding Armageddon: a slender  one, but worth trying. You averted war in the Algeciras crisis, and  again in the Agadir crisis, by saying you would fight. Try it again. The  Kaiser is stiffnecked because he does not believe you are going to fight  this time. Well, convince him that you are. The odds against him will  then be so terrible that he may not dare to support the Austrian  ultimatum to Servia at such a price. And if Austria is thus forced to  proceed judicially against Servia, we Russians will be satisfied; and  there will be no war.\"    Sir Edward could not see it. He is a member of a Liberal Government, in  a country where there is no political career for the man who does not  put his party's tenure of office before every other consideration. What  would _The Daily News_ and _The Manchester Guardian_ have said had he,  Bismarck-like, said bluntly: \"If war once breaks out, the old score  between England and Prussia will be settled, not by ambassadors' tea  parties and Areopaguses, but by blood and iron?\" In vain did Sazonoff  repeat, \"But if you are going to fight, as you know you are, why not say  so?\" Sir Edward, being Sir Edward and not Winston Churchill or Lloyd  George, could not admit that he was going to fight. He might have  forestalled the dying Pope and his noble Christian \"I bless peace\" by a  noble, if heathen, \"I fight war.\" Instead, he persuaded us all that he  was under no obligation whatever to fight. He persuaded Germany that he  had not the slightest serious intention of fighting. Sir Owen Seaman  wrote in _Punch_ an amusing and witty No-Intervention poem. Sporting  Liberals offered any odds that there would be no war for England. And  Germany, confident that with Austria's help she could break France with  one hand and Russia with the other if England held aloof, let Austria  throw the match into the magazine.      *The Battery Unmasked.*    Then the Foreign Office, always acting through its amiable and popular  but confused instrument Sir Edward, unmasked the Junker-Militarist  battery. He suddenly announced that England must take a hand in the war,  though he did not yet tell the English people so, it being against the  diplomatic tradition to tell them anything until it is too late for them  to object. But he told the German Ambassador, Prince Lichnowsky, caught  in a death trap, pleaded desperately for peace with Great Britain. Would  we promise to spare Germany if Belgium were left untouched? No. Would we  say on what conditions we would spare Germany? No. Not if the Germans  promised not to annex French territory? No. Not even if they promised  not to touch the French colonies? No. Was there no way out? Sir Edward  Grey was frank. He admitted there was just one chance; that Liberal  opinion might not stand the war if the neutrality of Belgium were not  violated. And he provided against that chance by committing England to  the war the day before he let the cat out of the bag in Parliament.    All this is recorded in the language of diplomacy in the White Paper on  or between the lines. That language is not so straightforward as my  language; but at the crucial points it is clear enough. Sazonoff's tone  is politely diplomatic in No. 6; but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1364"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive; Or, Two Miles a Minute on the Rails (#6)"],[1,"rks. Follow him footmarks. Not find.  When do find--kill!\"    \"That is, after first obtaining my permission,\" said Tom dryly.    \"It is so,\" agreed the imperturbable Koku. \"See! Show Master footmarks.  Him look in at window. See! Koku have got the wonder lamp.\"    He flashed the electric torch in his hand. He left the car and strode  into the yard. Tom followed him, and Mr. Damon's curiosity brought him  along.    The giant pointed the ray of the flashlight at the ground below the  porch. Several footprints--the marks of boots at least number twelve in  size--were imbedded in the soil. Koku went around the house to the  other side, following repeated marks of the same boots.    \"How came you to find them, Koku?\" asked Tom softly.    \"Me look. All around stockade,\" and he waved a generous gesture with  his free hand including the fence about the works. \"Enemy may come.  Anytime he come. Now he come.\"    \"Bless my slippery shoes!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, who had hard work to  keep up both physically and mentally with the giant.  \"What does he  mean?\"    \"Koku has always had it in his head,\" explained Tom, \"that we built  that fence about the works to keep out enemies. And, to tell the truth,  we did! But all that is over--\"    \"Is it?\" asked Mr. Damon pointedly. \"Enemy here,\" added Koku, flashing  the lamplight upon the footprints on the ground.    \"Those bootmarks,\" added Mr. Damon, \"are doubtless those of that fellow  who jumped upon the running board of the car.\"    \"Humph! And who robbed me of my wallet,\" added Tom musingly.  \"Well, it  might be. And, if so, Koku is right. The enemy has come.\"    \"Me kill!\" exclaimed the giant, stretching himself to his full height.    \"We'll consider the killing later,\" said Tom, who well knew his  influence with this big fellow. \"You are forbidden to kill anybody, or  chase anybody away from here, until I have a talk with them. Enemy or  not--understand?\"    \"Me understand,\" said Koku in his deep voice. \"Master say--me do.\"    \"Just the same,\" Tom said, aside to Mr. Damon, \"there has been somebody  around here. I guess Mr. Bartholomew was right. He is being spied upon.  And now that we Swifts are going to try to do something for him, we are  likely to be spied upon too.\"    \"Bless my statue of Nathan Hale!\" murmured the eccentric gentleman. \"I  believe you. And you've been already attacked twice by some thug! You  are positively in danger, Tom.\"    \"I don't know about that. Save that the fellow who robbed me was sore  because I fooled him. Naturally he might like to get square about those  shorthand notes. He knows no more now about Mr. Bartholomew's business  with us than he did before he held me up.\"    \"That is a fact,\" agreed Mr. Damon.    \"And that brings me to another warning, Mr. Damon,\" added Tom  earnestly, as his friend climbed into the motor car again. \"Keep all  that has happened, and all that I told you and Ned about the H. & P. A.  railroad, to yourself.\"    \"Surely! Surely!\"    \"If Mr. Bartholomew's rivals continue to keep their spies hanging  around the works here, we'll handle them properly. Trust Koku for  that,\" and Tom chuckled.    \"And don't forget my barbed wire entanglements,\" put in Mr. Damon,  starting his engine. \"I want to fix those chicken thieves.''    \"All right. I'll be over tomorrow,\" promised Tom Swift.    Then he stood a minute on the curb and looked after the disappearing  lights of Mr. Damon's car. The latter's problem dovetailed, after all,  into this discovery of possible marauders lurking about the Swift  premises. Koku had made no mistake in bringing his attention to the  matter of the footprints. Tom had seen somebody dodging into the  darkness outside the house when he had come out on his way to visit  Mary Nestor.    \"And sure as taxes,\" muttered Tom, as he finally turned toward the  front door again, \"the fellow who twice attacked me this evening wore  the boots the prints of which Koku found.    \"Those fellows, whoever they are, whether Montagne Lewis and his  associates, or not, have bitten off several mouthfuls that they may be  unable to chew. Anyhow, before they get through they may learn  something about the Swifts that they never knew before.\"          Chapter VI    The Contract Signed      Tom Swift went to bed that night without the least fear that the man  who had twice attacked him in the streets of Shopton would be able to  trouble him unless he went abroad again. Koku was on guard.    The giant whom Tom had brought home from one of his distant wanderings  was wholly devoted to his master. Koku never had, and he never would,  become entirely civilized.    He was naturally a born tracker of men. For generations his people had  lived amid the alarms of threat and attack. He could not be made to  understand how so many \"tribes,\" as he called them, of civilized men  could live in anything like harmony.    That somebody should prowl about the Swift house at night with a desire  to rob his young master or injure him, did not surprise Koku in the  least. He accepted the fact of the marauder's presence as quite the  expected thing.    But the man who had robbed Tom and later tried to repay him for playing  what appeared to be a practical joke on the robber, did not trouble the  Swift premises with his presence before morning.  Koku, thrusting  Eradicate Sampson aside and striding to his bedroom to report this  fact, was what awoke Tom at eight o'clock.    \"Hey! What you want, tromping in here for, man?\" demanded old Rad  angrily. \"An' totin' that spear, too. Where you t'ink yo' is?  In de  jungle again? Go 'way, chile!\"    Both Rad and Koku were rapidly outliving the sudden friendship of Rad's  sick days, when it was thought he might be blind for life, and were  dropping back into their old ways of bickering and rivalry for Tom's  attention.    \"I report to the Master,\" declared the giant, in his deep voice.    \"You tell me, I tell him,\" Rad said pompously. \"No need yo' 'sturbing  Massa Tom at dis hour.\"    \"Koku go in!\" declared the giant sternly.    \"Jes' stay out dere on de stair an' res' yo'self,\" said Rad.    Koku lost his temper with old Rad. There was a feud between them,  although deep in their hearts they really were fond of each other. But  the two were jealous of each other's services to young Tom Swift.    Suddenly Tom heard the old negro utter a frightened squeal. The door  which had been only ajar, burst inward and banged against the door-stop  with a mighty smash.    Rad went through the big bedroom like a chocolate-colored streak,  entered Tom's bathroom, and the next moment there was the sound of  crashing glass as Eradicate Sampson went through the lower sash of the  window, headfirst, out upon the roof of the porch!    \"What do you mean by this?\" shouted Tom, sitting up in bed.    Koku paused in the doorway, bulking almost to the top of the door. His  right arm was drawn back, displaying his mighty biceps, and he poised a  ten foot spear with a copper head that he had seized from a nest of  such implements which was a decoration of the lower hall.    Had the giant ever flung that spear at poor Rad's back, half the length  of the staff might have passed through his body.  Little wonder that  the colored man, having roused the giant's rage to such a pitch, had  given small consideration to the order of his going, but had gone at  once!    \"You want to scare Rad out of half a year's growth?\" Tom pursued  sternly, slipping out of bed and reaching for his robe and slippers.  \"And he's broken that window to smithereens.\"    \"Koku come make report, Master,\" said the giant.    \"You go put that spear back where you found it and come up properly,\"  commanded the young fellow, with difficulty hiding his amusement. \"Go  on now!\"    He shuffled into the bathroom while the giant disappeared. He peered  out of the broken window. It was a wonder Rad had not carried the sash  with him! The broken glass was scattered all about the roof of the  porch and the old colored man lay groaning there.    \"What did you do this for, Eradicate?\" demanded Tom. \"You act worse  than a ten-year-old boy.\"    \"I's done killed, Massa Tom!\" groaned Rad with confidence. \"I's blood  from haid to foot!\"    There was a scratch on his bald crown from which a few drops of blood  flowed. But with all his terror, Eradicate had put both arms over his  head when he made his dive through the window, and he really was very  little injured.    \"Come in here,\" repeated Tom. \"Fix something over this broken window so  that I can take my bath. And then go and put something on that scratch.  Don't you know better yet, than to cross Koku when he is excited?\"    \"Dat crazy ol' cannibal!\" spat out Rad viciously. \"I'll fix him yet.  I'll pizen his rations, dat's what I'll do.\"    \"You wouldn't be so bad as that, Rad!\"    \"Well, mebbe not,\" said the colored man, crawling in through the  bathroom window. \"It would take too much pizen, anyway, to kill that  giant. Take as much as dey has to give an el'phant to kill it. Anyways,  I's bound to fix him proper some time, yet.\"    These quarrels between Eradicate and Koku were intermittent.  They  almost always arose, too, because of the desire of the two servants to  wait upon Tom or his father. They were very jealous of each other, and  their clashes afforded Tom and his friends a good deal of amusement.    While the young inventor was in his bath the giant strode back into the  bedroom, out of which Rad had scurried by another door, and proceeded  to report the result of his night watch about the premises.    He had not much to tell. In fact, after Tom had gone into the house  Koku had seen nobody lurking about at all. The fact remained that,  earlier in the evening, somebody had made a close surveillance of the  Swift house, but the mysterious marauder had not come back.    \"All right, Koku. Keep your eyes open. I expect that enemy may return  sometime. Too bad,\" he added to himself, \"that I didn't get a better  look at"]]]
