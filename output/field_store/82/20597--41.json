The dream gives us something tangible to start with, something near at home  to the dreamer or patient, something interesting and amusing to him,  something baffling and so frequently unintelligible to him, and, as a  consequence, a more conscientious, earnest and wholehearted co-operation can  be obtained from the person whose mental life is being investigated. Here is  something vivid to him, something of personal interest to him. And so we can  look to him to lend us his aid in better spirit and in fuller measure than  might otherwise be obtainable.    I have been referring in my previous remarks, for the most part, to  unravelment of the normal individual's life history. But my remarks are  equally applicable to a mentally disturbed individual's life history and to  the genesis of abnormal psychic states, particularly those to be met with in  the neuroses and psychoneuroses.    So true is the generalization, indeed the truism or dictum here laid down,  that, in only the psychoanalyst knows how many instances, by the analysis of  a single, even the very first dream, one can arrive at the rock-bottom depth  of the trouble at hand--yes, at the very genesis of the condition. It is not  my intention in this paper to report such cases in full detail, since the  presentation of even a single such case would be too lengthy for publication  in an ordinary medical or other journal, and in many instances might well go  to make a good-sized book, a real autobiography of more or less interest, if  not to the average reader, at least to the psychoanalyst and to the person  who has undergone the psychoanalysis. Without attempting to present an  elaborate history or complete analysis, but rather merely to call attention  to the truth of the general problem which is being discussed in this paper,  I shall, however, mention a few definite illustrations of this sort.    A man of sixty was brought to my dispensary clinic by his wife (I say  \"brought\" and not \"accompanied\" by his wife, advisedly). She accompanied him  into my examining room.  He had an almost complete aphonia, spoke hoarsely  and in a whisper and presented all the signs of abductor laryngeal  paralysis; added to which there was a partial hemiplegia of the right side  involving the upper and lower extremities, but not the face or any of the  cranial nerves other than that supplying the right laryngeal abductor. I  shall not give any other points in the history except that this paralysis  was of four months' duration, there was some resistance to movements at the  elbow and knee, but Babinski and other indications of a central organic  lesion were absent. The results of the rest of the physical examination need  not be mentioned except that the patient presented evidences of  arteriosclerosis. The patient was of dull mentality, meek humble and  subservient; he was much below par mentally (I did not put him through any  special intelligence tests), had little information to offer, constantly  resorted to \"I don't know\" as a reply, and could co-operate but little.  I  did, however, obtain the important bit of information that seventeen years  ago he had had an almost complete aphonia of several weeks' duration and  that one day, while on board ship, he became seasick, vomited, became  frightened, went to his room, and suddenly his voice returned to him. So  sudden was the transformation that many of his fellow-passengers insisted  that he had been deceiving them and had purposely simulated the condition he  had previously presented. The case was one of hysteria, the patient  presenting at the time of my examination signs of abductor laryngeal  paralysis (laryngological examination disclosed a right-sided abductor  palsy) and right-sided partial hemiplegia.    For the next two visits the wife accompanied, or rather, brought the patient  to the clinic and I could get but little information and consequently  progressed but little.  I asked him, in her presence, to come alone the next  time--which he did. The description of the onset of the attack, which was  furnished me on his previous visits, proved the hysterical nature of the  condition: he had suddenly been attacked by nausea and vomiting, fell to the  floor, lay there, more or less unconscious (as he described it) for five or  ten or more minutes, was assisted to his feet, went to his bed with  practically no assistance, a few hours later found that he could speak  little more than above a whisper, and in another few hours or more his right  side became weak and failed him.  He had insisted that the onset came on  suddenly. He had denied any quarrels or trouble at home.  Nothing could be  obtained from him as to his thoughts just prior to the attack or as to any  special emotional shocks.    On his fourth visit I asked him to tell me any dream he had had recently and  which had made an impression upon him.  He could give me no aid. Nothing  came to mind.  I asked him if he had dreamed the night before, and he told  me he had had a dream the afternoon of the preceding day, during an  afternoon nap.  Here is the dream:  He found himself struggling with a  tremendous snake, the upper part of which was in human form, the features  being very hazy and not at all recalled.  The snake was vigorously  endeavoring to enwrap itself about him and to strangle him, and he was  desperately and fiercely struggling to defend himself against it and to free  himself from it--and yet he could not fight it off. In desperation and in  fear he cried aloud for help.  This was the end of the dream, for, at this  point, members of his family came rushing toward him to inquire what was  wrong with him, and due partly to shock and his own activity in the dream,  and partly perhaps to the noise of the footsteps and of the conversation of  those who came running toward him to inquire into the cause of his  distressful cries, he awoke.    The thoughts and reveries just preceding the dream and the thoughts and  experiences during the morning preceding the dream, although the true  inciters of the dream, and although concerned with the central figure (his  wife) in this little drama, need not be detailed since the dream has a wider  and more deeply arising significance.    I could not learn definitely from him whether the series of associated  thoughts turned first from his wife to his troubles with her, to her  attitude toward him, and then to her resemblance in this respect (her  nagging, pestering persistence and actual persecution of him) to a snake  which is endeavoring to enwrap itself about him, to strangle him, to  withdraw from him his very life's blood, etc. This may or may not have been  the line of associations just preceding the dream.    He had no idea as to what the dream meant.  Using free association, in  ordinary face-to-face conversation, I asked him what \"snake\" reminded him  of.  The association came in a moment.  He smiled, became embarrassed, said  it was foolish of him to tell me this, but it reminded him of his wife. He  had always looked upon his wife as a snake in human form. He had frequently  called her \"snake\" because of her conduct toward him. She had wound herself  about his life in snake-like fashion.    And then came the story of their troubles.  This was his second wife. She  was fifteen years his junior.  He was meek, feeble, of weak will-power,  without initiative.  She was domineering. Although his wife never told him  so openly and in so many words, he felt convinced that the trouble had begun  more or less because his wife's sexual libido was not satisfied in her  sexual relations with him. He admits that she is a passionate woman, her  sexual libido was of such strength that he, much older than she, and not too  strong physically, could but little gratify her.  The first complaints and  the sole trouble which appeared on the surface were financial--he barely  made a living and she complained thereat continually, bitterly and  tyrannically. It seems that her complaint in this direction was justified.  It is difficult to determine just what role her lack of sexual gratification  played-- whether it only acted as stirring up the embers of dissatisfaction  (with his weekly earnings) which already existed, or whether it was the  basic factor, led to her dissatisfaction with her matrimonial choice, and  caused her to seek some more or less valid cause for complaint, in that way  permitting her, more or less consciously, to transfer her dissatisfaction  and discontent from the lack of sexual gratification to the hard pressed  financial condition (which perhaps she might, for that matter, have been  willing to endure, did she but obtain the full gratification of her sexual  craving). At any rate, both of these factors played their role in causing  domestic disagreement, one factor being openly acknowledged as the cause by  his wife, the other factor never mentioned by her, but believed by him to be  an important accessory, if not the main, fundamental and primary source of  the trouble. His wife, using his poor earning capacity as a weapon, and with  the demand for \"more money\" as her battle-cry, carried on a campaign of  complaint, grumbling, nagging, fault-finding, insult and abuse, but little  short of persecution, making conditions wretched and miserable at home.  Things at length became quite unbearable to him--so much so that, feeble in  willpower and lacking in initiative as he was and is, he was compelled to  leave home and live with his aunt, since his wife had practically deserted  him.

Thus, for example,  the most sacred object of the Arunta tribe in Central Australia is, or  rather used to be, a pole about twenty feet high, which is completely  smeared with human blood, crowned with an imitation of a human head, and  set up on the ground where the final initiatory ceremonies of young men  are performed. A young gum-tree is chosen to form the pole, and it must  be cut down and transported in such a way that it does not touch the  earth till it is erected in its place on the holy ground. Apparently the  pole represents some famous ancestor of the olden time.[21]    [Festival of the wild manog tree in British New Guinea.]    Again, at a great dancing festival celebrated by the natives of Bartle  Bay, in British New Guinea, a wild mango tree plays a prominent part.  The tree must be self-sown, that is, really wild and so young that it  has never flowered. It is chosen in the jungle some five or six weeks  before the festival, and a circle is cleared round its trunk. From that  time the master of the ceremonies and some eight to twenty other men,  who have aided him in choosing the tree and in clearing the jungle,  become strictly holy or tabooed. They sleep by themselves in a house  into which no one else may intrude: they may not wash or drink water,  nor even allow it accidentally to touch their bodies: they are forbidden  to eat boiled food and the fruit of mango trees: they may drink only the  milk of a young coco-nut which has been baked, and they may eat certain  fruits and vegetables, such as paw-paws (_Carica papaya_) and  sugar-cane, but only on condition that they have been baked. All refuse  of their food is kept in baskets in their sleeping-house and may not be  removed from it till the festival is over. At the time when the men  begin to observe these rules of abstinence, some six to ten women,  members of the same clan as the master of the ceremonies, enter on a  like period of mortification, avoiding the company of the other sex, and  refraining from water, all boiled food, and the fruit of the mango tree.  These fasting men and women are the principal dancers at the festival.  The dancing takes place on a special platform in a temporary village  which has been erected for the purpose. When the platform is about to be  set up, the fasting men rub the stepping posts and then suck their hands  for the purpose of extracting the ghost of any dead man that might  chance to be in the post and might be injured by the weight of the  platform pressing down on him. Having carefully extracted these poor  souls, the men carry them away tenderly and set them free in the forest  or the long grass.    [The wild mango tree not allowed to touch the ground.]    On the day before the festival one of the fasting men cuts down the  chosen mango tree in the jungle with a stone adze, which is never  afterwards put to any other use; an iron tool may not be used for the  purpose, though iron tools are now common enough in the district. In  cutting down the mango they place nets on the ground to catch any leaves  or twigs that might fall from the tree as it is being felled and they  surround the trunk with new mats to receive the chips which fly out  under the adze of the woodman; for the chips may not drop on the earth.  Once the tree is down, it is carried to the centre of the temporary  village, the greatest care being taken to prevent it from coming into  contact with the ground. But when it is brought into the village, the  houses are connected with the top of the mango by means of long vines  decorated with the streamers. In the afternoon the fasting men and women  begin to dance, the men bedizened with gay feathers, armlets, streamers,  and anklets, the women flaunting in parti-coloured petticoats and sprigs  of croton leaves, which wave from their waistbands as they dance. The  dancing stops at sundown, and when the full moon rises over the shoulder  of the eastern hill (for the date of the festival seems to be determined  with reference to the time of the moon), two chiefs mount the gables of  two houses on the eastern side of the square, and, their dusky figures  standing sharply out against the moonlight, pray to the evil spirits to  go away and not to hurt the people. Next morning pigs are killed by  being speared as slowly as possible in order that they may squeal loud  and long; for the people believe that the mango trees hear the  squealing, and are pleased at the sound, and bear plenty of fruit,  whereas if they heard no squeals they would bear no fruit. However, the  trees have to content themselves with the squeals; the flesh of the pigs  is eaten by the people. This ends the festival.    [Final disposition of the wild mango tree.]    Next day the mango is taken down from the platform, wrapt in new mats,  and carried by the fasting men to their sleeping house, where it is hung  from the roof. But after an interval, it may be of many months, the tree  is brought forth again. As to the reason for its reappearance in public  opinions are divided; but some say that the tree itself orders the  master of the ceremonies to bring it forth, appearing to him in his  dreams and saying, \"Let me smell the smoking fat of pigs. So will your  pigs be healthy and your crops will grow.\" Be that as it may, out it  comes, conducted by the fasting men in their dancing costume; and with  it come in the solemn procession all the pots, spoons, cups and so forth  used by the fasting men during their period of holiness or taboo, also  all the refuse of their food which has been collected for months, and  all the fallen leaves and chips of the mango in their bundles of mats.  These holy relics are carried in front and the mango tree itself brings  up the rear of the procession. While these sacred objects are being  handed out of the house, the men who are present rush up, wipe off the  hallowed dust which has accumulated on them, and smear it over their own  bodies, no doubt in order to steep themselves in their blessed  influence. Thus the tree is carried as before to the centre of the  temporary village, care being again taken not to let it touch the  ground. Then one of the fasting men takes from a basket a number of  young green mangoes, cuts them in pieces, and places them with his own  hands in the mouths of his fellows, the other fasting men, who chew the  pieces small and turning round spit the morsels in the direction of the  setting sun, in order that \"the sun should carry the mango bits over the  whole country and everyone should know.\" A portion of the mango tree is  then broken off and in the evening it is burnt along with the bundles of  leaves, chips, and refuse of food, which have been stored up. What  remains of the tree is taken to the house of the master of the  ceremonies and hung over the fire-place; it will be brought out again at  intervals and burned bit by bit, till all is consumed, whereupon a new  mango will be cut down and treated in like manner. The ashes of the holy  fire on each occasion are gathered by the people and preserved in the  house of the master of the ceremonies.[22]    [The ceremony apparently intended to fertilize the mango trees.]    The meaning of these ceremonies is not explained by the authorities who  describe them; but we may conjecture that they are intended to fertilize  the mango trees and cause them to bear a good crop of fruit. The central  feature of the whole ritual is a wild mango tree, so young that it has  never flowered: the men who cut it down, carry it into the village, and  dance at the festival, are forbidden to eat mangoes: pigs are killed in  order that their dying squeals may move the mango trees to bear fruit:  at the end of the ceremonies pieces of young green mangoes are solemnly  placed in the mouths of the fasting men and are by them spurted out  towards the setting sun in order that the luminary may carry the  fragments to every part of the country; and finally when after a longer  or shorter interval the tree is wholly consumed, its place is supplied  by another. All these circumstances are explained simply and naturally  by the supposition that the young mango tree is taken as a  representative of mangoes generally, that the dances are intended to  quicken it, and that it is preserved, like a May-pole of old in England,  as a sort of general fund of vegetable life, till the fund being  exhausted by the destruction of the tree it is renewed by the  importation of a fresh young tree from the forest. We can therefore  understand why, as a storehouse of vital energy, the tree should be  carefully kept from contact with the ground, lest the pent-up and  concentrated energy should escape and dribbling away into the earth be  dissipated to no purpose.    [Sacred objects of various sorts not allowed to touch the ground.]    To take other instances of what we may call the conservation of energy  in magic or religion by insulating sacred bodies from the ground, the  natives of New Britain have a secret society called the Duk-duk, the  members of which masquerade in petticoats of leaves and tall headdresses  of wickerwork shaped like candle extinguishers, which descend to the  shoulders of the wearers, completely concealing their faces. Thus  disguised they dance about to the awe and terror, real or assumed, of  the women and uninitiated, who take, or pretend to take, them for  spirits. When lads are being initiated into the secrets of this august  society, the adepts cut down some very large and heavy bamboos, one for  each lad, and the novices carry them, carefully wrapt up in leaves, to  the sacred ground, where they arrive very tired and weary, for they may  not let the bamboos touch the "]]]
