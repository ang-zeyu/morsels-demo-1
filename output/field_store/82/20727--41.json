There is only one specimen at present in the Museum. Professor Ansted  mentions it in his list, but only as found in Guernsey and Sark; but it  is quite as common in Alderney, from which Island I have seen  specimens, and I think also from Herm, but I cannot be quite sure about  this, though of course there can be no reason why it should not be found  there, as Herm is only three miles as the crow flies from Guernsey.      17. BARN OWL. _Aluco flammeus_, Linnaeus. French, \"Chouette effraie.\"--I  have never seen the Barn or Yellow Owl alive in the Channel Islands  myself, but Mr. MacCulloch does not consider it at all rare in Guernsey,  and Mr. Jago informs me the Barn Owls have taken possession of a  pigeon-hole in a house in the Brock Road opposite his, and that he sees  and hears them every night. Some years ago he told me he shot one near  the Queen's Tower. He was not scared like the man who shot one in the  churchyard, and thought he had shot a cherubim, but he had to give up  shooting owls, as the owner of the pigeon-hole where the owls have taken  up their abode remonstrated with him, and he has since refrained, though  he has had several chances. The vacancy caused by the one being shot was  soon filled up.    The Barn Owl is mentioned in Professor Ansted's list, and restricted to  Guernsey and Sark. There are two specimens in the Museum, both of which  are said to have been killed in Guernsey.      18. REDBACKED SHRIKE. _Lanius Collurio_, Linnaeus. French, \"Pie-grieche  ecorcheur.\"--The Red-backed Shrike may be considered a tolerably  regular, but not very common, summer visitant to the Channel Islands. In  June, 1876, I several times saw a male bird about the Vallon, in  Guernsey. The female no doubt had a nest at the time in the Vallon  grounds, but I could not then get in there to search for it.    As the Red-backed Shrike frequently returns to the same place every  year, I expected again to find this bird, and perhaps the female and the  nest this year, 1878, about the Vallon, but I could see nothing of  either birds or nest, though I searched both inside and outside the  Vallon grounds.    Young Mr. Le Cheminant, who lives at Le Ree and has a small collection  of Guernsey eggs mostly collected by himself in the Island, had one  Red-backed Shrike's egg of the variety which has the reddish, or rather  perhaps pink, tinge. There were also some eggs in a Guernsey collection  in the Museum. These were all of the more ordinary variety. There were  also two skins--a male and female--in the Museum. The bird seems rather  local in its distribution about the Island, as I never saw one about the  Vale in any of my visits, not even this year, 1878, when I was there for  two months, and had ample opportunity of observing it had it been there.  There are, however, plenty of places nearly as well suited to it in the  Vale as about the Vallon or Le Ree. I have never seen it in either of  the other Islands, though no doubt it occasionally occurs both in Sark  and Herm, if not in Alderney.    Professor Ansted includes the Red-backed Shrike in his list, and marks  it only as occurring in Guernsey. I have no evidence of any other Shrike  occurring in the Islands, though I should think the Great Grey Shrike,  _Lanius excubitor_, might be an occasional autumn or winter visitant to  the Islands; but I have never seen a specimen myself or been able to  glean any satisfactory information as to the occurrence of one, either  from the local bird-stuffers or from Mr. MacCulloch, or any of my  friends who have so kindly supplied me with notes; neither does  Professor Ansted mention it in his list.      19. SPOTTED FLYCATCHER. _Muscicapa grisola_, Linnaeus. French,  \"Gobe-mouche gris.\"--The Spotted Flycatcher is a regular and numerous  summer visitant, generally quite as numerous in certain localities as in  England, its arrival and departure being about the same time. It occurs  also in Sark and Herm, and probably in Alderney, but I do not remember  having seen one there. In Guernsey it is perhaps a little local in its  distribution, avoiding to a great extent such places as the Vale and the  open ground on the cliffs, but in all the gardens and orchards it is  very common.    Spotted Flycatchers appear, however, to vary in numbers to a certain  extent in different years. This year, 1878, they came out in great  force, especially on the lawn at Candie where they availed themselves to  a large extent of the croquet-hoops, from which they kept a good  look-out either for insects on the wing or on the ground, and they might  be as frequently seen dropping to the ground for some unfortunate  creeping thing that attracted their attention as rising in the air to  give chase to something on the wing. Certainly, when I was in Guernsey  about the same time in 1866, Spotted Flycatchers did not appear to be  quite so numerous as in 1878. This was probably only owing to one of  those accidents of wind and weather which render migratory birds  generally, less numerous in some years than they are in others, however  much they may wish and endeavour, which seems to be their usual rule, to  return to their former breeding stations.    Professor Ansted mentions the Spotted Flycatcher in his list, but does  not add, as he usually does, any letter showing its distribution through  the Islands. This probably is because it is generally distributed  through them all. There is no specimen in the Museum.      20. GOLDEN ORIOLE. _Oriolus galbula_, Linnaeus. French, \"Le Loriot.\"--I  have never seen the bird alive or found any record of the occurrence of  the Golden Oriole in Guernsey or the neighbouring Islands, and beyond  the fact that there was one example--a female--in the Museum (which may  have been from Jersey) I had been able to gain no information on the  subject except of a negative sort. No specimen had passed through the  hands of the local bird-stuffers certainly for a good many years, for  Mr. Jago's mother who about twenty or thirty years ago, when she was  Miss Cumber, had been for some considerable time the only bird-stuffer  in the Island, told me she did not know the bird, and had never had one  through her hands. It seemed to me rather odd that a bird which occurs  almost every year in the British Islands, occasionally even as far west  as Ireland, as a straggler, and which is generally distributed over the  continent of Europe in the summer, should be totally unknown in the  Channel Islands. Consequently writing to the 'Star' about another  Guernsey bird--a Hoopoe--which had been recorded in that paper, I asked  for information as to the occurrence of the Golden Oriole in the  Islands, and shortly after the following letter signed \"Tereus\"[8]  appeared in the 'Star':--\"Concerning the occurrence of the Golden Oriole  I cannot speak from my own personal knowledge, but I believe there can  be no doubt that the bird has been occasionally seen here. Its presence,  however, must be much more rare than that of the Hoopoe, for a bird of  such plumage as the Oriole would be more likely to attract even more  attention than the comparatively sober-coloured Hoopoe, and if half so  common as the latter would be sure to fall before the gun of the fowler.  There was a specimen of the female bird in the Museum of the Mechanics'  Institution, but I am not sure about its history, and I have some reason  to suppose it was shot in Jersey. Our venerable national poet, Mr.  George Metivier, has many allusions to the Oriole in his early  effusions, whether written in English, French, or our vernacular  dialect. It seems to have been an occasional visitor at St. George's;  but in Mr. Metivier's early days the island was far more wooded than it  is at present, and it is possible that the wholesale destruction of  hedgerow elms and the grubbing-up of so many orchards in order to employ  the ground more profitably in the culture of early potatoes and brocoli,  by which the island has lost much of its picturesque beauty, may have  had the effect of deterring some of the occasional visitors from  alighting here in their periodical migrations.\" Signed \"Tereus.\"    A short time after the appearance of this letter in the 'Star' on the  16th of May, 1878, Mr. MacCulloch himself wrote to me on the subject and  said:--\"I had yesterday a very satisfactory interview with Mr. George  Metivier. He is now in his 88th or 89th year. He told me he was about  thirteen when he went to reside with his relations, the Guilles, at St.  George. There was then a great deal of old timber about the place and a  long avenue of oaks, besides three large cherry orchards. One day he was  startled by the sight of a male Oriole. He had never seen the bird  before. Whether it was that one that was killed or another in a  subsequent year I don't know, but he declares that for several years  afterwards they were seen in the oak trees and among the cherries, and  that he has not the least doubt but that they bred there. One day an old  French gentleman of the name of De l'Huiller from the South of France,  an emigrant, noticed the birds and made the remark--'Ah! vous avez des  loriots ici; nous en avons beaucoup chez nous, ils sont grands gobeurs  de cerises.' It would appear from this that cherries are a favourite  food with this bird, and the presence of cherry orchards would account  for their settling down at St. George. I believe they are said to be  very shy, and the absence of wood would account for their not being seen  in the present day.\"    I have no doubt that Mr. MacCulloch is right that the cherry orchards,  to say nothing of other fruit trees, tempted the Golden Orioles to  remain to breed in the Island, for they are \"grand gobeurs\" not only of  \"cerises,\" but of many other sorts of fruit, particularly of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14474"],[0,"The Chemical History of a Candle (#6)"],[1,"call hydrogen, and which you shall  know all about next time we meet. And here is a substance called oxygen,  by means of which this hydrogen can burn; and although we produce, by  their mixture, far greater heat[8] than you can obtain from the candle,  yet there is very little light. If, however, I take a solid substance, and  put that into it, we produce an intense light If I take a piece of lime, a  substance which will not burn, and which will not vaporise by the heat  (and because it does not vaporise, remains solid, and remains heated), you  will soon observe what happens as to its glowing. I have here a most  intense heat, produced by the burning of hydrogen in contact with the  oxygen; but there is as yet very little light--not for want of heat, but  for want of particles which can retain their solid state; but when I hold  this piece of lime in the flame of the hydrogen as it burns in the oxygen,  see how it glows! This is the glorious lime-light, which rivals the  voltaic-light, and which is almost equal to sunlight. I have here a piece  of carbon or charcoal, which will burn and give us light exactly in the  same manner as if it were burnt as part of a candle. The heat that is in  the flame of a candle decomposes the vapour of the wax, and sets free the  carbon particles--they rise up heated and glowing as this now glows, and  then enter into the air. But the particles when burnt never pass off from  a candle in the form of carbon. They go off into the air as a perfectly  invisible substance, about which we shall know hereafter.    Is it not beautiful to think that such a process is going on, and that  such a dirty thing as charcoal can become so incandescent? You see it  comes to this--that all bright flames contain these solid particles; all  things that burn and produce solid particles, either during the time they  are burning, as in the candle, or immediately after being burnt, as in the  case of the gunpowder and iron-filings,--all these things give us this  glorious and beautiful light.    I will give you a few illustrations. Here is a piece of phosphorus, which  burns with a bright flame. Very well; we may now conclude that phosphorus  will produce, either at the moment that it is burning or afterwards, these  solid particles. Here is the phosphorus lighted, and I cover it over with  this glass for the purpose of keeping in what is produced. What is all  that smoke? That smoke consists of those very particles which are produced  by the combustion of the phosphorus. Here, again, are two substances. This  is chlorate of potassa, and this other sulphuret of antimony. I shall mix  these together a little, and then they may be burnt in many ways. I shall  touch them with a drop of sulphuric acid, for the purpose of giving you an  illustration of chemical action, and they will instantly burn[9]. [The  Lecturer then ignited the mixture by means of sulphuric acid.] Now, from  the appearance of things, you can judge for yourselves whether they  produce solid matter in burning. I have given you the train of reasoning  which will enable you to say whether they do or do not; for what is this  bright flame but the solid particles passing off?    [Illustration: Fig. 9.]    Mr. Anderson has in the furnace a very hot crucible,--I am about to throw  into it some zinc filings, and they will burn with a flame like gunpowder.  I make this experiment because you can make it well at home. Now, I want  you to see what will be the result of the combustion of this zinc. Here it  is burning--burning beautifully like a candle, I may say. But what is all  that smoke, and what are those little clouds of wool which will come to  you if you cannot come to them, and make themselves sensible to you in the  form of the old philosophic wool, as it was called? We shall have left in  that crucible, also, a quantity of this woolly matter. But I will take a  piece of this same zinc and make an experiment a little more closely at  home, as it were. You will have here the same thing happening. Here is the  piece of zinc, there [pointing to a jet of hydrogen] is the furnace, and  we will set to work and try and burn the metal. It glows, you see: there  is the combustion, and there is the white substance into which it burns.  And so, if I take that flame of hydrogen as the representative of a  candle, and shew you a substance like zinc burning in the flame, you will  see that it was merely during the action of combustion that this substance  glowed--while it was kept hot; and if I take a flame of hydrogen, and put  this white substance from the zinc into it, look how beautifully it glows,  and just because it is a solid substance.    I will now take such a flame as I had a moment since, and set free from it  the particles of carbon. Here is some camphine, which will burn with a  smoke; but if I send these particles of smoke through this pipe into the  hydrogen flame, you will see they will burn and become luminous, because  we heat them a second time. There they are. Those are the particles of  carbon re-ignited a second time. They are those particles which you can  easily see by holding a piece of paper behind them, and which, whilst they  are in the flame, are ignited by the heat produced, and, when so ignited,  produce this brightness. When the particles are not separated, you get no  brightness. The flame of coal-gas owes its brightness to the separation,  during combustion, of these particles of carbon, which are equally in that  as in a candle. I can very quickly alter that arrangement. Here, for  instance, is a bright flame of gas. Supposing I add so much air to the  flame as to cause it all to burn before those particles are set free, I  shall not have this brightness; and I can do that in this way:--If I place  over the jet this wire-gauze cap, as you see, and then light the gas over  it, it burns with a non-luminous flame, owing to its having plenty of air  mixed with it before it burns; and if I raise the gauze, you see it does  not burn below[10]. There is plenty of carbon in the gas; but, because the  atmosphere can get to it, and mix with it before it burns, you see how  pale and blue the flame is. And if I blow upon a bright gas-flame, so as  to consume all this carbon before it gets heated to the glowing point, it  will also burn blue: [The Lecturer illustrated his remarks by blowing on  the gas-light.] The only reason why I have not the same bright light when  I thus blow upon the flame is, that the carbon meets with sufficient air  to burn it before it gets separated in the flame in a free state. The  difference is solely due to the solid particles not being separated before  the gas is burnt.    You observe that there are certain products as the result of the  combustion of a candle, and that of these products one portion may be  considered as charcoal, or soot; that charcoal, when afterwards burnt,  produces some other product; and it concerns us very much now to ascertain  what that other product is. We shewed that something was going away; and I  want you now to understand how much is going up into the air; and for that  purpose we will have combustion on a little larger scale. From that candle  ascends heated air, and two or three experiments will shew you the  ascending current; but, in order to give you a notion of the quantity of  matter which ascends in this way, I will make an experiment by which I  shall try to imprison some of the products of this combustion. For this  purpose I have here what boys call a fire-balloon. I use this fire-balloon  merely as a sort of measure of the result of the combustion we are  considering; and I am about to make a flame in such an easy and simple  manner as shall best serve my present purpose. This plate shall be the  \"cup,\" we will so say, of the candle; this spirit shall be our fuel; and I  am about to place this chimney over it, because it is better for me to do  so than to let things proceed at random.    [Illustration: Fig. 10.]    Mr. Anderson will now light the fuel, and here at the top we shall get the  results of the combustion. What we get at the top of that tube is exactly  the same, generally speaking, as you get from the combustion of a candle;  but we do not get a luminous flame here, because we use a substance which  is feeble in carbon. I am about to put this balloon--not into action,  because that is not my object--but to shew you the effect which results  from the action of those products which arise from the candle, as they  arise here from the furnace. [The balloon was held over the chimney, when  it immediately commenced to fill.] You see how it is disposed to ascend;  but we must not let it up, because it might come in contact with those  upper gas-lights, and that would be very inconvenient. [The upper  gas-lights were turned out, at the request of the Lecturer, and the  balloon was allowed to ascend.] Does not that shew you what a large bulk  of matter is being evolved? Now, there is going through this tube [placing  a large glass tube over a candle] all the products of that candle, and you  will presently see that the tube will become quite opaque. Suppose I take  another candle, and place it under a jar, and then put a light on the  other side, just to shew you what is going on. You see that the sides of  the jar become cloudy, and the light begins to burn feebly. It is the  products, you see, which make the light so dim, and this is the same thing  which makes the sides of the jar so opaque. If you go home and take a  spoon that has been in the cold air, and hold it over a candle--not so as  to soot it--you will find that it becomes dim, just as that jar is dim. If  you can get a silver dish, or something of that kind, you will make the  experiment still better. And now, just to carry your thoughts forward to  the time we shall next meet, let me tell you that it is _water_ which  causes the dimness; and when we next meet. I will shew you"]]]
