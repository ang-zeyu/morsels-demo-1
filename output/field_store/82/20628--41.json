They flourish like the morning flow'r,       In beauty's pride array'd;       But long ere night cut down it lies       All wither'd and decay'd.          Prayer, In The Prospect Of Death         O Thou unknown, Almighty Cause       Of all my hope and fear!       In whose dread presence, ere an hour,       Perhaps I must appear!         If I have wander'd in those paths       Of life I ought to shun,       As something, loudly, in my breast,       Remonstrates I have done;         Thou know'st that Thou hast formed me       With passions wild and strong;       And list'ning to their witching voice       Has often led me wrong.         Where human weakness has come short,       Or frailty stept aside,       Do Thou, All-Good--for such Thou art--       In shades of darkness hide.         Where with intention I have err'd,       No other plea I have,       But, Thou art good; and Goodness still       Delighteth to forgive.          Stanzas, On The Same Occasion         Why am I loth to leave this earthly scene?       Have I so found it full of pleasing charms?       Some drops of joy with draughts of ill between--       Some gleams of sunshine 'mid renewing storms,       Is it departing pangs my soul alarms?       Or death's unlovely, dreary, dark abode?       For guilt, for guilt, my terrors are in arms:       I tremble to approach an angry God,       And justly smart beneath His sin-avenging rod.         Fain would I say, \"Forgive my foul offence,\"       Fain promise never more to disobey;       But, should my Author health again dispense,       Again I might desert fair virtue's way;       Again in folly's part might go astray;       Again exalt the brute and sink the man;       Then how should I for heavenly mercy pray       Who act so counter heavenly mercy's plan?       Who sin so oft have mourn'd, yet to temptation ran?         O Thou, great Governor of all below!       If I may dare a lifted eye to Thee,       Thy nod can make the tempest cease to blow,       Or still the tumult of the raging sea:       With that controlling pow'r assist ev'n me,       Those headlong furious passions to confine,       For all unfit I feel my pow'rs to be,       To rule their torrent in th' allowed line;       O, aid me with Thy help, Omnipotence Divine!              1782          Fickle Fortune: A Fragment         Though fickle Fortune has deceived me,       She pormis'd fair and perform'd but ill;       Of mistress, friends, and wealth bereav'd me,       Yet I bear a heart shall support me still.         I'll act with prudence as far 's I'm able,       But if success I must never find,       Then come misfortune, I bid thee welcome,       I'll meet thee with an undaunted mind.          Raging Fortune--Fragment Of Song         O raging Fortune's withering blast       Has laid my leaf full low, O!       O raging Fortune's withering blast       Has laid my leaf full low, O!         My stem was fair, my bud was green,       My blossom sweet did blow, O!       The dew fell fresh, the sun rose mild,       And made my branches grow, O!         But luckless Fortune's northern storms       Laid a' my blossoms low, O!       But luckless Fortune's northern storms       Laid a' my blossoms low, O!          Impromptu--\"I'll Go And Be A Sodger\"         O why the deuce should I repine,       And be an ill foreboder?       I'm twenty-three, and five feet nine,       I'll go and be a sodger!         I gat some gear wi' mickle care,       I held it weel thegither;       But now it's gane, and something mair--       I'll go and be a sodger!          Song--\"No Churchman Am I\"         Tune--\"Prepare, my dear Brethren, to the tavern let's fly.\"           No churchman am I for to rail and to write,       No statesman nor soldier to plot or to fight,       No sly man of business contriving a snare,       For a big-belly'd bottle's the whole of my care.         The peer I don't envy, I give him his bow;       I scorn not the peasant, though ever so low;       But a club of good fellows, like those that are here,       And a bottle like this, are my glory and care.         Here passes the squire on his brother--his horse;       There centum per centum, the cit with his purse;       But see you the Crown how it waves in the air?       There a big-belly'd bottle still eases my care.         The wife of my bosom, alas! she did die;       for sweet consolation to church I did fly;       I found that old Solomon proved it fair,       That a big-belly'd bottle's a cure for all care.         I once was persuaded a venture to make;       A letter inform'd me that all was to wreck;       But the pursy old landlord just waddl'd upstairs,       With a glorious bottle that ended my cares.         \"Life's cares they are comforts\"--a maxim laid down       By the Bard, what d'ye call him, that wore the black gown;       And faith I agree with th' old prig to a hair,       For a big-belly'd bottle's a heav'n of a care.          A Stanza Added In A Mason Lodge         Then fill up a bumper and make it o'erflow,       And honours masonic prepare for to throw;       May ev'ry true Brother of the Compass and Square       Have a big-belly'd bottle when harass'd with care.          My Father Was A Farmer         Tune--\"The weaver and his shuttle, O.\"           My father was a farmer upon the Carrick border, O,       And carefully he bred me in decency and order, O;       He bade me act a manly part, though I had ne'er a farthing, O;       For without an honest manly heart, no man was worth regarding, O.         Then out into the world my course I did determine, O;       Tho' to be rich was not my wish, yet to be great was charming, O;       My talents they were not the worst, nor yet my education, O:       Resolv'd was I at least to try to mend my situation, O.         In many a way, and vain essay, I courted Fortune's favour, O;       Some cause unseen still stept between, to frustrate each endeavour, O;       Sometimes by foes I was o'erpower'd, sometimes by friends forsaken, O;       And when my hope was at the top, I still was worst mistaken, O.         Then sore harass'd and tir'd at last, with Fortune's vain delusion, O,       I dropt my schemes, like idle dreams, and came to this conclusion, O;       The past was bad, and the future hid, its good or ill untried, O;       But the present hour was in my pow'r, and so I would enjoy it, O.         No help, nor hope, nor view had I, nor person to befriend me, O;       So I must toil, and sweat, and moil, and labour to sustain me, O;       To plough and sow, to reap and mow, my father bred me early, O;       For one, he said, to labour bred, was a match for Fortune fairly, O.         Thus all obscure, unknown, and poor, thro' life I'm doom'd to wander, O,       Till down my weary bones I lay in everlasting slumber, O:       No view nor care, but shun whate'er might breed me pain or sorrow, O;       I live to-day as well's I may, regardless of to-morrow, O.         But cheerful still, I am as well as a monarch in his palace, O,       Tho' Fortune's frown still hunts me down, with all her wonted malice, O:       I make indeed my daily bread, but ne'er can make it farther, O:       But as daily bread is all I need, I do not much regard her, O.         When sometimes by my labour, I earn a little money, O,       Some unforeseen misfortune comes gen'rally upon me, O;       Mischance, mistake, or by neglect, or my goodnatur'd folly, O:       But come what will, I've sworn it still, I'll ne'er be melancholy, O.         All you who follow wealth and power with unremitting ardour, O,       The more in this you look for bliss, you leave your view the farther, O:       Had you the wealth Potosi boasts, or nations to adore you, O,       A cheerful honest-hearted clown I will prefer before you, O.          John Barleycorn: A Ballad         There was three kings into the east,       Three kings both great and high,       And they hae sworn a solemn oath       John Barleycorn should die.         They took a plough and plough'd him down,       Put clods upon his head,       And they hae sworn a solemn oath       John Barleycorn was dead.         But the cheerful Spring came kindly on,       And show'rs began to fall;       John Barleycorn got up again,       And sore surpris'd them all.         The sultry suns of Summer came,       And he grew thick and strong;       His head weel arm'd wi' pointed spears,       That no one should him wrong.         The sober Autumn enter'd mild,       When he grew wan and pale;       His bending joints and drooping head       Show'd he began to fail.         His colour sicken'd more and more,       He faded into age;       And then his enemies began       To show their deadly rage.         They've taen a weapon, long and sharp,       And cut him by the knee;       Then tied him fast upon a cart,       Like a rogue for forgerie.         They laid him down upon his back,       And cudgell'd him full sore;       They hung him up before the storm,       And turned him o'er and o'er.         They filled up a darksome pit       With water to the brim;       They heaved in John Barleycorn,       There let him sink or swim.         They laid him out upon the floor,       To work him farther woe;       And still, as signs of life appear'd,       They toss'd him to and fro.         They wasted, o'er a scorching flame,       The marrow of his bones;       But a miller us'd him worst of all,       For he crush'd him between two stones.         And they hae taen his very heart's blood,       And drank it round and round;       And still the more and more they drank,       Their joy did more abound.         John Barleycorn was a hero bold,       Of noble enterprise;       For if you do but "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12797"],[0,"The Log of a Cowboy: A Narrative of the Old Trail Days (#6)"],[1,"the next day returning, and was feeling quite gala on my  good fortune. When evening came on, I sighted a little ranch house  some distance off the trail, and concluded to ride to it and stay  overnight. As I approached, I saw that some one lived there, as there  were chickens and dogs about, but not a person in sight. I dismounted  and knocked on the door, when, without a word, the door was thrown  wide open and a half dozen guns were poked into my face. I was ordered  into the house and given a chance to tell my story again. Whether my  story was true or not, they took no chances on me, but kept me all  night. One of the men took my horse to the stable and cared for him,  and I was well fed and given a place to sleep, but not a man offered a  word of explanation, from which I took it they did not belong to the  vigilance faction. When it came time to go to bed, one man said to me,  'Now, sonny, don't make any attempt to get away, and don't move out of  your bed without warning us, for you'll be shot as sure as you do. We  won't harm a hair on your head if you're telling us the truth; only do  as you're told, for we'll watch you.'    \"By this time I had learned to obey orders while in that county, and  got a fair night's sleep, though there were men going and coming all  night. The next morning I was given my breakfast; my horse, well  cuffed and saddled, was brought to the door, and with this parting  advice I was given permission to go: 'Son, if you've told us the  truth, don't look back when you ride away. You'll be watched for the  first ten miles after leaving here, and if you've lied to us it will  go hard with you. Now, remember, don't look back, for these are times  when no one cares to be identified.' I never questioned that man's  advice; it was 'die dog or eat the hatchet' with me. I mounted my  horse, waved the usual parting courtesies, and rode away. As I turned  into the trail about a quarter mile from the house, I noticed two men  ride out from behind the stable and follow me. I remembered the story  about Lot's wife looking back, though it was lead and not miracles  that I was afraid of that morning.    \"For the first hour I could hear the men talking and the hoofbeats of  their horses, as they rode along always the same distance behind me.  After about two hours of this one-sided joke, as I rode over a little  hill, I looked out of the corner of my eye back at my escort, still  about a quarter of a mile behind me. One of them noticed me and raised  his gun, but I instantly changed my view, and the moment the hill hid  me, put spurs to my horse, so that when they reached the brow of the  hill, I was half a mile in the lead, burning the earth like a canned  dog. They threw lead close around me, but my horse lengthened the  distance between us for the next five miles, when they dropped  entirely out of sight. By noon I came into the old stage road, and by  the middle of the afternoon reached home after over sixty miles in the  saddle without a halt.\"    Just at the conclusion of Bull's story, Flood rode in from the herd,  and after picketing his horse, joined the circle. In reply to an  inquiry from one of the boys as to how the cattle were resting, he  replied,--    \"This herd is breaking into trail life nicely. If we'll just be  careful with them now for the first month, and no bad storms strike us  in the night, we may never have a run the entire trip. That last drink  of water they had this evening gave them a night-cap that'll last them  until morning. No, there's no danger of any trouble to-night.\"    For fully an hour after the return of our foreman, we lounged around  the fire, during which there was a full and free discussion of  stampedes. But finally, Flood, suiting the action to the word by  arising, suggested that all hands hunt their blankets and turn in for  the night. A quiet wink from Bull to several of the boys held us for  the time being, and innocently turning to Forrest, Durham inquired,--    \"Where was--when was--was it you that was telling some one about a run  you were in last summer? I never heard you tell it. Where was it?\"    \"You mean on the Cimarron last year when we mixed two herds,\" said  Quince, who had taken the bait like a bass and was now fully embarked  on a yarn. \"We were in rather close quarters, herds ahead and behind  us, when one night here came a cow herd like a cyclone and swept right  through our camp. We tumbled out of our blankets and ran for our  horses, but before we could bridle\"--    Bull had given us the wink, and every man in the outfit fell back, and  the snoring that checked the storyteller was like a chorus of rip saws  running through pine knots. Forrest took in the situation at a glance,  and as he arose to leave, looked back and remarked,--    \"You must all think that's smart.\"    Before he was out of hearing, Durham said to the rest of us,--    \"A few doses like that will cure him of sucking eggs and acting smart,  interrupting folks.\"        CHAPTER IV      THE ATASCOSA    For the next few days we paralleled the coast, except when forced  inland by various arms of the Laguna Madre. When about a week out from  the Arroyo Colorado, we encountered the Salt Lagoon, which threw us at  least fifty miles in from the coast. Here we had our last view of salt  water, and the murmurings of the Gulf were heard no more. Our route  now led northward through what were then the two largest ranches in  Texas, the \"Running W\" and Laurel Leaf, which sent more cattle up the  trail, bred in their own brand, than any other four ranches in the  Lone Star State. We were nearly a week passing through their ranges,  and on reaching Santa Gertruda ranch learned that three trail herds,  of over three thousand head each, had already started in these two  brands, while four more were to follow.    So far we had been having splendid luck in securing water for the  herd, once a day at least, and often twice and three times. Our herd  was becoming well trail-broken by this time, and for range cattle had  quieted down and were docile and easy to handle. Flood's years of  experience on the trail made him a believer in the theory that  stampedes were generally due to negligence in not having the herd full  of grass and water on reaching the bed ground at night. Barring  accidents, which will happen, his view is the correct one, if care has  been used for the first few weeks in properly breaking the herd to the  trail. But though hunger and thirst are probably responsible for more  stampedes than all other causes combined, it is the unexpected which  cannot be guarded against. A stampede is the natural result of fear,  and at night or in an uncertain light, this timidity might be imparted  to an entire herd by a flash of lightning or a peal of thunder, while  the stumbling of a night horse, or the scent of some wild animal,  would in a moment's time, from frightening a few head, so infect a  herd as to throw them into the wildest panic. Amongst the thousands of  herds like ours which were driven over the trail during its brief  existence, none ever made the trip without encountering more or less  trouble from runs. Frequently a herd became so spoiled in this manner  that it grew into a mania with them, so that they would stampede on  the slightest provocation,--or no provocation at all.    A few days after leaving Santa Gertruda Ranch, we crossed the Nueces  River, which we followed up for several days, keeping in touch with it  for water for the herd. But the Nueces, after passing Oakville, makes  an abrupt turn, doubling back to the southwest; and the Atascosa, one  of its tributaries, became our source of water supply. We were  beginning to feel a degree of overconfidence in the good behavior of  our herd, when one night during the third week out, an incident  occurred in which they displayed their running qualities to our  complete satisfaction.    It occurred during our guard, and about two o'clock in the morning.  The night was an unusually dark one and the atmosphere was very humid.  After we had been on guard possibly an hour, John Officer and I riding  in one direction on opposite sides of the herd, and The Rebel circling  in the opposite, Officer's horse suddenly struck a gopher burrow with  his front feet, and in a moment horse and rider were sprawling on the  ground. The accident happened but a few rods from the sleeping herd,  which instantly came to their feet as one steer, and were off like a  flash. I was riding my Nigger Boy, and as the cattle headed toward me,  away from the cause of their fright, I had to use both quirt and rowel  to keep clear of the onrush. Fortunately we had a clear country near  the bed ground, and while the terrified cattle pressed me close, my  horse kept the lead. In the rumbling which ensued, all sounds were  submerged by the general din; and I was only brought to the  consciousness that I was not alone by seeing several distinct flashes  from six-shooters on my left, and, realizing that I also had a gun,  fired several times in the air in reply. I was soon joined by Priest  and Officer, the latter having lost no time in regaining his seat in  the saddle, and the three of us held together some little distance,  for it would have been useless to attempt to check or turn this  onslaught of cattle in their first mad rush.    The wagon was camped about two hundred yards from the bed ground, and  the herd had given ample warning to the boys asleep, so that if we  three could hold our position in the lead, help would come to us as  soon as the men in camp could reach their horses. Realizing the wide  front of the running cattle, Priest sent Officer to the left and  myself to the right, to point in the leaders in order to keep the herd  from splitting or scattering, while he remained in the centre and led  the herd. I soon gained the outside of the leaders, and by dropping  back and coming up the line, pointed them in to the best of "]]]
