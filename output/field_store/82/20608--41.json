Once accepted, nothing but  an event of the last importance should cause you to fail in your  engagement.    To be exactly punctual is the strictest politeness on these occasions.  If you are too early, you are in the way; if too late, you spoil the  dinner, annoy the hostess, and are hated by the rest of the guests.  Some authorities are even of opinion that in the question of a  dinner-party \"never\" is better than \"late;\" and one author has gone so  far as to say, \"if you do not reach the house till dinner is served,  you had better retire, and send an apology, and not interrupt the  harmony of the courses by awkward excuses and cold acceptance.\"    When the party is assembled, the mistress or master of the house will  point out to each gentleman the lady whom he is to conduct to table.  The guests then go down according to precedence of rank. This order of  precedence must be arranged by the host or hostess, as the guests are  probably unacquainted, and cannot know each other's social rank.    When the society is of a distinguished kind the hostess will do well  to consult Debrett or Burke, before arranging her visitors.    When rank is not in question, other claims to precedence must be  considered. The lady who is the greatest stranger should be taken  down by the master of the house, and the gentleman who is the greatest  stranger should conduct the hostess. Married ladies take precedence of  single ladies, elder ladies of younger ones, and so forth.    When dinner is announced, the host offers his arm to the lady of most  distinction, invites the rest to follow by a few words or a bow,  and leads the way. The lady of the house should then follow with the  gentleman who is most entitled to that honour, and the visitors follow  in the order that has been previously arranged. The lady of the house  frequently remains, however, till the last, that she may see her  guests go down in their prescribed order; but the plan is not a  convenient one. It is much better that the hostess should be in her  place as the guests enter the dining-room, in order that she may  indicate their seats to them as they enter, and not find them all  crowded together in uncertainty when she arrives.    The number of guests at a dinner-party should always be determined  by the size of the table. When the party is too small, conversation  flags, and a general air of desolation pervades the table. When they  are too many, every one is inconvenienced. A space of two feet should  be allowed to each person. It is well to arrange a party in such wise  that the number of ladies and gentlemen be equal.    It requires some tact to distribute your guests so that each shall  find himself with a neighbour to his taste; but as much of the success  of a dinner will always depend on this matter, it is worth some  consideration. If you have a wit, or a particularly good talker, among  your visitors, it is well to place him near the centre of the table,  where he can be heard and talked to by all. It is obviously a bad plan  to place two such persons in close proximity. They extinguish each  other. Neither is it advisable to assign two neighbouring seats to  two gentlemen of the same profession, as they are likely to fall  into exclusive conversation and amuse no one but themselves. A little  consideration of the politics, religious opinions, and tastes of his  friends, will enable a judicious host to avoid many quicksands, and  establish much pleasant intercourse on the occasion of a dinner-party.    The lady of the house takes the head of the table. The gentleman who  led her down to dinner occupies the seat on her right hand, and the  gentleman next in order of precedence, that on her left. The master of  the house takes the foot of the table. The lady whom he escorted sits  on his right hand, and the lady next in order of precedence on his  left.    As soon as you are seated at table, remove your gloves, place your  table-napkin across your knees, and remove the roll which you find  probably within it to the left side of your plate.    The soup should be placed on the table first. Some old-fashioned  persons still place soup and fish together; but \"it is a custom more  honoured in the breach than the observance.\" Still more old-fashioned,  and in still worse taste is it to ask your guests if they will take  \"soup or fish.\" They are as much separate courses as the fish and  the meat; and all experienced diners take both. In any case, it is  inhospitable to appear to force a choice upon a visitor, when that  visitor, in all probability, will prefer to take his soup first and  his fish afterwards. All well-ordered dinners begin with soup, whether  in summer or winter. The lady of the house should help it, and send  it round without asking each individual in turn. It is as much an  understood thing as the bread beside each plate, and those who do not  choose it are always at liberty to leave it untasted.    In eating soup, remember always to take it from the side of the spoon,  and to make no sound in doing so.    If the servants do not go round with wine the gentlemen should help  the ladies and themselves to sherry or sauterne immediately after the  soup.    You should never ask for a second supply of either soup or fish; it  delays the next course, and keeps the table waiting.    Never offer to \"assist\" your neighbours to this or that dish. The word  is inexpressibly vulgar--all the more vulgar for its affectation  of elegance. \"Shall I send you some mutton?\" or \"may I help you to  grouse?\" is better chosen and better bred.    As a general rule, it is better not to ask your guests if they will  partake of the dishes; but to send the plates round, and let them  accept or decline them as they please. At very large dinners it is  sometimes customary to distribute little lists of the order of the  dishes at intervals along the table. It must be confessed that  this gives somewhat the air of a dinner at an hotel; but it has the  advantage of enabling the visitors to select their fare, and, as  \"forewarned is forearmed,\" to keep a corner, as the children say, for  their favourite dishes.    As soon as you are helped, begin to eat; or, if the viands are too hot  for your palate, take up your knife and fork and appear to begin. To  wait for others is now not only old-fashioned, but ill-bred.    Never offer to pass on the plate to which you have been helped. This  is a still more vulgar piece of politeness, and belongs to the manners  of a hundred years ago. The lady of the house who sends your plate to  you is the best judge of precedence at her own table.    In helping soup, fish, or any other dish, remember that to overfill a  plate is as bad as to supply it too scantily. Silver fish-knives will  now always be met with at the best tables; but where there are none,  a piece of crust should be taken in the left hand, and the fork in the  right. There is no exception to this rule in eating fish.    We presume it is scarcely necessary to remind our fair reader that she  is never, under any circumstances, to convey her knife to her mouth.  Peas are eaten with the fork; tarts, curry, and puddings of all kinds  with the spoon.    Always help fish with a fish-slice, and tart and puddings with a  spoon, or, if necessary, a spoon and fork.    Asparagus must be helped with the asparagus-tongs.    In eating asparagus, it is well to observe what others do, and act  accordingly. Some very well-bred people eat it with the fingers;  others cut off the heads, and convey them to the mouth upon the fork.  It would be difficult to say which is the more correct.    In eating stone fruit, such as cherries, damsons, &c., the same rule  had better be observed. Some put the stones out from the month into a  spoon, and so convey them to the plate. Others cover the lips with the  hand, drop them unseen into the palm, and so deposit them on the side  of the plate. In our own opinion, the last is the better way, as it  effectually conceals the return of the stones, which is certainly the  point of highest importance. Of one thing we may be sure, and that is,  that they must never be dropped from the mouth to the plate.    In helping sauce, always pour it on the side of the plate.    If the servants do not go round with the wine (which is by far  the best custom), the gentlemen at a dinner-table should take upon  themselves the office of helping those ladies who sit near them. Young  ladies seldom drink more than three glasses of wine at dinner; but  married ladies, professional ladies, and those accustomed to society  and habits of affluence, will habitually take five or even six,  whether in their own homes or at the tables of their friends.    The habit of taking wine with each other has almost wholly gone out  of fashion. A gentleman may ask the lady whom he conducted down to  dinner; or he may ask the lady of the house to take wine with him.  But even these last remnants of the old custom are fast falling into  disuse.    Unless you are a total abstainer, it is extremely uncivil to decline  taking wine if you are invited to do so. In accepting, you have only  to pour a little fresh wine into your glass, look at the person who  invited you, bow slightly, and take a sip from the glass.    It is particularly ill-bred to empty your glass on these occasions.    Certain wines are taken with certain dishes, by old-established  custom--as sherry, or sauterne, with soup and fish; hock and claret  with roast meat; punch with turtle; champagne with whitebait; port  with venison; port, or burgundy, with game; sparkling wines between  the roast and the confectionery; madeira with sweets; port with  cheese; and for dessert, port, tokay, madeira, sherry, and claret. Red  wines should never be iced, even in summer. Claret and burgundy should  always be slightly warmed; claret-cup and champagne-cup should, of  course, be iced.

Of those who compose the first class, defined as it has now been, I cannot  name any individual who took a part in this cause till between the years  1670 and 1680. For in the year 1640, and for a few years afterwards, the  nature of the trade and of the slavery was but little known, except to a  few individuals, who were concerned in them; and it is obvious that these  would neither endanger their own interest nor proclaim their own guilt by  exposing it. The first, whom I shall mention, is Morgan Godwyn, a clergyman  of the established church. This pious divine wrote a Treatise upon the  subject, which he dedicated to the then archbishop of Canterbury. He gave  it to the world, at the time mentioned, under the title of \"The Negros and  Indians Advocate.\" In this treatise he lays open the situation of these  oppressed people, of whose sufferings he had been an eye-witness in the  island of Barbadoes. He calls forth the pity of the reader in an affecting  manner, and exposes with a nervous eloquence the brutal sentiments and  conduct of their oppressors. This seems to have been the first work  undertaken in England expressly in favour of the cause.    The next person, whom I shall mention, is Richard Baxter, the celebrated  divine among the Nonconformists. In his Christian Directory, published  about the same time as the Negros and Indians Advocate, he gives advice to  those masters in foreign plantations, who have Negros and other slaves. In  this he protests loudly against this trade. He says expressly that they,  who go out as pirates, and take away poor Africans, or people of another  land, who never forfeited life or liberty, and make them slaves and sell  them, are the worst of robbers, and ought to be considered as the common  enemies of mankind; and that they, who buy them, and use them as mere  beasts for their own convenience, regardless of their spiritual welfare,  are fitter to be called demons than Christians. He then proposes several  queries, which he answers in a clear and forcible manner, showing the great  inconsistency of this traffic, and the necessity of treating those then in  bondage with tenderness and a due regard to their spiritual concerns.    The Directory of Baxter was succeeded by a publication called \"Friendly  Advice to the Planters: in three parts.\" The first of these was, \"A brief  Treatise of the principal Fruits and Herbs that grow in Barbadoes, Jamaica,  and other Plantations in the West Indies.\" The second was, \"The Negros  Complaint, or their hard Servitude, and the Cruelties practised upon them  by divers of their Masters professing Christianity.\" And the third was, \"A  Dialogue between an Ethiopian and a Christian, his Master, in America.\" In  the last of these, Thomas Tryon, who was the author, inveighs both against  the commerce and the slavery of the Africans, and in a striking manner  examines each by the touchstone of reason, humanity, justice, and religion.    In the year 1696, Southern brought forward his celebrated tragedy of  Oronooko, by means of which many became enlightened upon the subject, and  interested in it. For this tragedy was not a representation of fictitious  circumstances, but of such as had occurred in the colonies, and as had been  communicated in a publication by Mrs. Behn.    The person, who seems to have noticed the subject next was Dr. Primatt. In  his \"Dissertation on the Duty of Mercy, and on the Sin of Cruelty to  Brute-animals,\" he takes occasion to advert to the subject of the African  Slave-trade. \"It has pleased God,\" says he, \"to cover some men with white  skins and others with black; but as there is neither merit nor demerit in  complexion, the white man, notwithstanding the barbarity of custom and  prejudice, can have no right by virtue of his colour to enslave and  tyrannize over the black man. For whether a man be white or black, such he  is by God's appointment, and, abstractedly considered, is neither a subject  for pride, nor an object of contempt.\"    After Dr. Primatt, we come to baron Montesquieu. \"Slavery,\" says he, \"is  not good in itself. It is neither useful to the master nor to the slave.  Not to the slave, because he can do nothing from virtuous motives. Not to  the master, because he contracts among his slaves all sorts of bad habits,  and accustoms himself to the neglect of all the moral virtues. He becomes  haughty, passionate, obdurate, vindictive, voluptuous, and cruel.\" And with  respect to this particular species of slavery he proceeds to say, \"it is  impossible to allow the Negros are men, because, if we allow them to be  men, it will begin to be believed that we ourselves are not Christians.\"    Hutcheson, in his System of Moral Philosophy, endeavours to show that he,  who detains another by force in slavery, can make no good title to him, and  adds, \"Strange that in any nation where a sense of liberty prevails, and  where the Christian religion is professed, custom and high prospect of gain  can so stupefy the consciences of men and all sense of natural justice,  that they can hear such computations made about the value of their  fellow-men and their liberty without abhorrence and indignation!\"    Foster, in his Discourses on Natural Religion and Social Virtue, calls the  slavery under our consideration \"a criminal and outrageous violation of the  natural rights of mankind.\" I am sorry that I have not room to say all that  he says on this subject. Perhaps the following beautiful extracts may  suffice:        \"But notwithstanding this, we ourselves, who profess to be      Christians, and boast of the peculiar advantages we enjoy by means      of an express revelation of our duty from heaven, are in effect      these very untaught and rude heathen countries. With all our      superior light we instil into those, whom we call savage and      barbarous, the most despicable opinion of human nature. We, to the      utmost of our power, weaken and dissolve the universal tie, that      binds and unites mankind. We practise what we should exclaim      against as the utmost excess of cruelty and tyranny, if nations of      the world, differing in colour and form of government from      ourselves, were so possessed of empire, as to be able to reduce us      to a state of unmerited and brutish servitude. Of consequence we      sacrifice our reason, our humanity, our christianity, to an      unnatural sordid gain. We teach other nations to despise and      trample under foot all the obligations of social virtue. We take      the most effectual method to prevent the propagation of the gospel,      by representing it as a scheme of power and barbarous oppression,      and an enemy to the natural privileges and rights of man.\"        \"Perhaps all that I have now offered may be of very little weight      to restrain this enormity, this aggravated iniquity. However, I      shall still have the satisfaction of having entered my private      protest against a practice, which, in my opinion, bids that God,      who is the God and Father of the Gentiles unconverted to      Christianity, most daring and bold defiance, and spurns at all the      principles both of natural and revealed religion.\"    The next author is sir Richard Steele, who, by means of the affecting story  of Inkle and Yarico, holds up this trade again to our abhorrence.    In the year 1735, Atkins, who was a surgeon in the navy, published his  Voyage to Guinea, Brazil, and the West-Indies, in his Majesty's ships  Swallow and Weymouth. In this work he describes openly the manner of making  the natives slaves, such as by kidnapping, by unjust accusations and  trials, and by other nefarious means. He states also the cruelties  practised upon them by the white people, and the iniquitous ways and  dealings of the latter, and answers their argument, by which they  insinuated that the condition of the Africans was improved by their  transportation to other countries.    From this time the trade beginning to be better known, a multitude of  persons of various stations and characters sprung up, who by exposing it  are to be mentioned among the forerunners and coadjutors in the cause.    Pope, in his Essay on Man, where he endeavours to show that happiness in  the present depends, among other things, upon the hope of a future state,  takes an opportunity of exciting compassion in behalf of the poor African,  while he censures the avarice and cruelty of his master:      \"Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind    Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;    His soul proud Science never taught to stray    Far as the solar walk, or milky-way;    Yet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n    Behind the cloud-topt hill an humbler heav'n;    Some safer world in depth of woods embrac'd,    Some happier island in the watry waste,    Where slaves once more their native land behold,    No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold.\"    Thomson also, in his Seasons, marks this traffic as destructive and cruel,  introducing the well-known fact of sharks following the vessels employed in  it;      \"Increasing still the sorrows of those storms,    His jaws horrific arm'd with three-fold fate,    Here dwells the direful shark. Lur'd by the scent    Of steaming crowds, of rank disease, and death,    Behold! he rushing cuts the briny flood,    Swift as the gale can bear the ship along,    And from the partners of that cruel trade,    Which spoils unhappy Guinea of her sons,    Demands his share of prey, demands themselves.    The stormy fates descend: one death involves    Tyrants and slaves; when straight their mangled limbs    Crashing at once, he dyes the purple seas    With gore, and riots in the vengeful meal.\"    Neither was Richard "]]]
