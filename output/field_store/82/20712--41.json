They seized all the islands in that division of the sea, or at any  rate prevented any other nation from settling in Corsica, Sardinia,  and the Balearic Isles. In particular Carthage took possession  of the western part of Sicily, which had been settled by sister  Phoenician colonies. While Rome did everything in its power to  consolidate its conquests by admitting the other Italians to some  share in the central government, Carthage only regarded its foreign  possessions as so many openings for trade. In fact, it dealt with  the western littoral of the Mediterranean something like the East  India Company treated the coast of Hindostan: it established factories  at convenient spots. But just as the East India Company found it  necessary to conquer the neighbouring territory in order to secure  peaceful trade, so Carthage extended its conquests all down the  western coast of Africa and the south-east part of Spain, while Rome  was extending into Italy. To continue our conchological analogy, by  the time of the first Punic War Rome and Carthage had each expanded  into a shell, and between the two intervened the eastern section of  the island of Sicily. As the result of this, Rome became master  of Sicily, and then the final struggle took place with Hannibal in  the second Punic War, which resulted in Rome becoming possessed  of Spain and Carthage. By the year 200 B.C. Rome was practically  master of the Western Mediterranean, though it took another century  to consolidate its heritage from Carthage in Spain and Mauritania.  During that century--the second before our era--Rome also extended  its Italian boundaries to the Alps by the conquest of Cisalpine  Gaul, which, however, was considered outside Italy, from which it  was separated by the river Rubicon. In that same century the Romans  had begun to interfere in the affairs of Greece, which easily fell  into their hands, and thus prepared the way for their inheritance  of Alexander's empire.    This, in the main, was the work of the first century before our  era, when the expansion of Rome became practically concluded. This  was mainly the work of two men, Caesar and Pompey. Following the  example of his uncle, Marius, Caesar extended the Roman dominions  beyond the Alps to Gaul, Western Germany, and Britain; but from  our present standpoint it was Pompey who prepared the way for Rome  to carry on the succession of empire in the more civilised portions  of the world, and thereby merited his title of \"Great.\" He pounded  up, as it were, the various states into which Asia Minor was divided,  and thus prepared the way for Roman dominion over Western Asia and  Egypt. By the time of Ptolemy the empire was thoroughly consolidated,  and his map and geographical notices are only tolerably accurate  within the confines of the empire.    [Illustration: EUROPE. Showing the principal Roman Roads.]    One of the means by which the Romans were enabled to consolidate  their dominion must be here shortly referred to. In order that  their legions might easily pass from one portion of this huge empire  to another, they built roads, generally in straight lines, and so  solidly constructed that in many places throughout Europe they  can be traced even to the present day, after the lapse of fifteen  hundred years. Owing to them, in a large measure, Rome was enabled  to preserve its empire intact for nearly five hundred years, and  even to this day one can trace a difference in the civilisation  of those countries over which Rome once ruled, except where the  devastating influence of Islam has passed like a sponge over the  old Roman provinces. Civilisation, or the art of living together  in society, is practically the result of Roman law, and this sense  all roads in history lead to Rome.    The work of Claudius Ptolemy sums up to us the knowledge that the  Romans had gained by their inheritance, on the western side, of  the Carthaginian empire, and, on the eastern, of the remains of  Alexander's empire, to which must be added the conquests of Caesar  in North-West Europe. Caesar is, indeed, the connecting link between  the two shells that had been growing throughout ancient history. He  added Gaul, Germany, and Britain to geographical knowledge, and,  by his struggle with Pompey, connected the Levant with his northerly  conquests. One result of his imperial work must be here referred  to. By bringing all civilised men under one rule, he prepared them  for the worship of one God. This was not without its influence on  travel and geographical discovery, for the great barrier between  mankind had always been the difference of religion, and Rome, by  breaking down the exclusiveness of local religions, and substituting  for them a general worship of the majesty of the Emperor, enabled  all the inhabitants of this vast empire to feel a certain communion  with one another, which ultimately, as we know, took on a religious  form.    The Roman Empire will henceforth form the centre from which to  regard any additions to geographical knowledge. As we shall see,  part of the knowledge acquired by the Romans was lost in the Dark  Ages succeeding the break-up of the empire; but for our purposes  this may be neglected and geographical discovery in the succeeding  chapters may be roughly taken to be additions and corrections of  the knowledge summed up by Claudius Ptolemy.          CHAPTER III    GEOGRAPHY IN THE DARK AGES    We have seen how, by a slow process of conquest and expansion, the  ancient world got to know a large part of the Eastern Hemisphere,  and how this knowledge was summed up in the great work of Claudius  Ptolemy. We have now to learn how much of this knowledge was lost  or perverted--how geography, for a time, lost the character of  a science, and became once more the subject of mythical fancies  similar to those which we found in its earliest stages. Instead of  knowledge which, if not quite exact, was at any rate approximately  measured, the mediaeval teachers who concerned themselves with the  configuration of the inhabited world substituted their own ideas  of what ought to be.[1] This is a process which applies not alone  to geography, but to all branches of knowledge, which, after the  fall of the Roman Empire, ceased to expand or progress, became mixed  up with fanciful notions, and only recovered when a knowledge of  ancient science and thought was restored in the fifteenth century.  But in geography we can more easily see than in other sciences  the exact nature of the disturbing influence which prevented the  acquisition of new knowledge.    [Footnote 1: It is fair to add that Professor Miller's researches  have shown that some of the \"unscientific\" qualities of the mediaeval  _mappoe mundi_ were due to Roman models.]    Briefly put, that disturbing influence was religion, or rather  theology; not, of course, religion in the proper sense of the word,  or theology based on critical principles, but theological conceptions  deduced from a slavish adherence to texts of Scripture, very often  seriously misunderstood. To quote a single example: when it is  said in Ezekiel v. S, \"This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the  midst of the nations... round about her,\" this was not taken by  the mediaeval monks, who were the chief geographers of the period,  as a poetical statement, but as an exact mathematical law, which  determined the form which all mediaeval maps took. Roughly speaking,  of course, there was a certain amount of truth in the statement,  since Jerusalem would be about the centre of the world as known  to the ancients--at least, measured from east to west; but, at  the same time, the mediaeval geographers adopted the old Homeric  idea of the ocean surrounding the habitable world, though at times  there was a tendency to keep more closely to the words of Scripture  about the four corners of the earth. Still, as a rule, the orthodox  conception of the world was that of a circle enclosing a sort of T  square, the east being placed at the top, Jerusalem in the centre;  the Mediterranean Sea naturally divided the lower half of the circle,  while the AEgean and Red Seas were regarded as spreading out right  and left perpendicularly, thus dividing the top part of the world,  or Asia, from the lower part, divided equally between Europe on  the left and Africa on the right. The size of the Mediterranean  Sea, it will be seen, thus determined the dimensions of the three  continents. One of the chief errors to which this led was to cut  off the whole of the south of Africa, which rendered it seemingly  a short voyage round that continent on the way to India. As we  shall see, this error had important and favourable results on  geographical discovery.    [Illustration: GEOGRAPHICAL MONSTERS]    Another result of this conception of the world as a T within an  O, was to expand Asia to an enormous extent; and as this was a  part of the world which was less known to the monkish map-makers  of the Middle Ages, they were obliged to fill out their ignorance  by their imagination. Hence they located in Asia all the legends  which they had derived either from Biblical or classical sources.  Thus there was a conception, for which very little basis is to be  found in the Bible, of two fierce nations named Gog and Magog,  who would one day bring about the destruction of the civilised  world. These were located in what would have been Siberia, and  it was thought that Alexander the Great had penned them in behind  the Iron Mountains. When the great Tartar invasion came in the  thirteenth century, it was natural to suppose that these were no  less than the Gog and Magog of legend. So, too, the position of  Paradise was fixed in the extreme east, or, in other words, at the  top of mediaeval maps. Then, again, some of the classical authorities,  as Pliny and Solinus, had admitted into their geographical accounts  legends of strange tribes of monstrous men, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14293"],[0,"The Complete Book of Cheese (#6)"],[1,"praise from a host of  admirers, among them the French cook, Clementine, in Phineas Beck's  _Kitchen_, who raised it to the par of French immortals by calling it  Fromage de Coon. Clementine used it \"with scintillating success in  countless French recipes which ended with the words _gratiner au four  et servir tres chaud_. She made _baguettes_ of it by soaking sticks  three-eights-inch square and one and a half inches long in lukewarm  milk, rolling them in flour, beaten egg and bread crumbs and browning  them instantaneously in boiling oil.\"      Herkimer County Cheese    The standard method for making American Cheddar was established in  Herkimer County, New York, in 1841 and has been rigidly maintained  down to this day. Made with rennet and a bacterial \"starter,\" the curd  is cut and pressed to squeeze out all of the whey and then aged in  cylindrical forms for a year or more.    Herkimer leads the whole breed by being flaky, brittle, sharp and  nutty, with a crumb that will crumble, and a soft, mouth-watering pale  orange color when it is properly aged.      Isigny    Isigny is a native American cheese that came a cropper. It seems to be  extinct now, and perhaps that is all to the good, for it never meant  to be anything more than another Camembert, of which we have plenty of  imitation.    Not long after the Civil War the attempt was made to perfect Isigny.  The curd was carefully prepared according to an original formula,  washed and rubbed and set aside to come of age. But when it did, alas,  it was more like Limburger than Camembert, and since good domestic  Limburger was then a dime a pound, obviously it wouldn't pay off. Yet  in shape the newborn resembled Camembert, although it was much larger.  So they cut it down and named it after the delicate French Creme  d'lsigny.      Jack, California Jack and Monterey Jack    Jack was first known as Monterey cheese from the California county  where it originated. Then it was called Jack for short, and only now  takes its full name after sixty years of popularity on the West Coast.  Because it is little known in the East and has to be shipped so far,  it commands the top Cheddar price.    Monterey Jack is a stirred curd Cheddar without any annatto coloring.  It is sweeter than most and milder when young, but it gets sharper  with age and more expensive because of storage costs.      Liederkranz    No native American cheese has been so widely ballyhooed, and so  deservedly, as Liederkranz, which translates \"Wreath of Song.\"    Back in the gay, inventive nineties, Emil Frey, a young delicatessen  keeper in New York, tried to please some bereft customers by making an  imitation of Bismarck Schlosskaese. This was imperative because the  imported German cheese didn't stand up during the long sea trip and  Emil's customers, mostly members of the famous Liederkranz singing  society, didn't feel like singing without it. But Emil's attempts at  imitation only added indigestion to their dejection, until one  day--_fabelhaft!_ One of those cheese dream castles in Spain came  true. He turned out a tawny, altogether golden, tangy and mellow  little marvel that actually was an improvement on Bismarck's old  Schlosskaese. Better than Brick, it was a deodorized Limburger, both a  man's cheese and one that cheese-conscious women adored.    Emil named it \"Wreath of Song\" for the Liederkranz customers. It soon  became as internationally known as tabasco from Texas or Parisian  Camembert which it slightly resembles. Borden's bought out Frey in  1929 and they enjoy telling the story of a G.I. who, to celebrate V-E  Day in Paris, sent to his family in Indiana, only a few miles from the  factory at Van Wert, Ohio, a whole case of what he had learned was  \"the finest cheese France could make.\" And when the family opened it,  there was Liederkranz.    Another deserved distinction is that of being sandwiched in between  two foreign immortals in the following recipe:       Schnitzelbank Pot    1 ripe Camembert cheese  1 Liederkranz  1/8 pound imported Roquefort  1/4 pound butter  1 tablespoon flour  1 cup cream  1/2 cup finely chopped olives  1/4 cup canned pimiento  A sprinkling of cayenne         Depending on whether or not you like the edible rind of Camembert       and Liederkranz, you can leave it on, scrape any thick part off,       or remove it all. Mash the soft creams together with the       Roquefort, butter and flour, using a silver fork. Put the mix       into an enameled pan, for anything with a metal surface will       turn the cheese black in cooking.         Stir in the cream and keep stirring until you have a smooth,       creamy sauce. Strain through sieve or cheesecloth, and mix in the       olives and pimiento thoroughly. Sprinkle well with cayenne and       put into a pot to mellow for a few days, or much longer.    The name _Schnitzelbank_ comes from \"school bench,\" a game. This  snappy-sweet pot is specially suited to a beer party and stein songs.  It is also the affinity-spread with rye and pumpernickel, and may be  served in small sandwiches or on crackers, celery and such, to make  appetizing tidbits for cocktails, tea, or cider.    Like the trinity of cheeses that make it, the mixture is eaten best at  room temperature, when its flavor is fullest. If kept in the  refrigerator, it should be taken out a couple of hours before serving.  Since it is a natural cheese mixture, which has gone through no  process or doping with preservative, it will not keep more than two  weeks. This mellow-sharp mix is the sort of ideal the factory  processors shoot at with their olive-pimiento abominations. Once  you've potted your own, you'll find it gives the same thrill as  garnishing your own Liptauer.      Minnesota Blue    The discovery of sandstone caves in the bluffs along the Mississippi,  in and near the Twin Cities of Minnesota, has established a  distinctive type of Blue cheese named for the state. Although the  Roquefort process of France is followed and the cheese is inoculated  in the same way by mold from bread, it can never equal the genuine  imported, marked with its red-sheep brand, because the milk used in  Minnesota Blue is cow's milk, and the caves are sandstone instead of  limestone. Yet this is an excellent, Blue cheese in its own right.      Pineapple    Pineapple cheese is named after its shape rather than its flavor,  although there are rumors that some pineapple flavor is noticeable  near the oiled rind. This flavor does not penetrate through to the  Cheddar center. Many makers of processed cheese have tampered with the  original, so today you can't be sure of anything except getting a  smaller size every year or two, at a higher price. Originally six  pounds, the Pineapple has shrunk to nearly six ounces. The proper  bright-orange, oiled and shellacked surface is more apt to be a sickly  lemon.    Always an ornamental cheese, it once stood in state on the side-board  under a silver bell also made to represent a pineapple. You cut a top  slice off the cheese, just as you would off the fruit, and there was a  rose-colored, fine-tasting, mellow-hard cheese to spoon out with a  special silver cheese spoon or scoop. Between meals the silver top was  put on the silver holder and the oiled and shellacked rind kept the  cheese moist. Even when the Pineapple was eaten down to the rind the  shell served as a dunking bowl to fill with some salubrious cold  Fondue or salad.    Made in the same manner as Cheddar with the curd cooked harder,  Pineapple's distinction lies in being hung in a net that makes  diamond-shaped corrugations on the surface, simulating the sections of  the fruit. It is a pioneer American product with almost a century and  a half of service since Lewis M. Norton conceived it in 1808 in  Litchfield County, Connecticut. There in 1845 he built a factory and  made a deserved fortune out of his decorative ingenuity with what  before had been plain, unromantic yellow or store cheese.    Perhaps his inspiration came from cone-shaped Cheshire in old England,  also called Pineapple cheese, combined with the hanging up of  Provolones in Italy that leaves the looser pattern of the four  sustaining strings.       Sage, Vermont Sage and Vermont State    The story of Sage cheese, or green cheese as it was called originally,  shows the several phases most cheeses have gone through, from their  simple, honest beginnings to commercialization, and sometimes back to  the real thing.    The English _Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery_ has an early Sage  recipe:         This is a species of cream cheese made by adding sage leaves and       greening to the milk. A very good receipt for it is given thus:       Bruise the tops of fresh young red sage leaves with an equal       quantity of spinach leaves and squeeze out the juice. Add this to       the extract of rennet and stir into the milk as much as your       taste may deem sufficient. Break the curd when it comes, salt it,       fill the vat high with it, press for a few hours, and then turn       the cheese every day.    _Fancy Cheese in America, lay_ Charles A. Publow, records the  commercialization of the cheese mentioned above, a century or two  later, in 1910:         Sage cheese is another modified form of the Cheddar variety. Its       distinguishing features are a mottled green color and a sage       flavor. The usual method of manufacture is as follows: One-third       of the total amount of milk is placed in a vat by itself and       colored green by the addition of eight to twelve ounces of       commercial sage color to each 1,000 pounds of milk. If green corn       leaves (unavailable in England) or other substances are used for       coloring, the amounts will vary accordingly. The milk is then       made up by the regular Cheddar method, as is also the remaining       two-thirds, in a separate vat. At the time of removing the whey       the green and white curds are mixed.
