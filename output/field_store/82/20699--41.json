(2) If a word ends in _-y_ preceded by a consonant (the _y_ being then  changed to _i_); e.g., _fancies, allies, daisies, fairies_.    [Sidenote: _Words in -ies._]    Formerly, however, these words ended in _-ie_, and the real ending is  therefore _-s_. Notice these from Chaucer (fourteenth century):--    [Sidenote: _Their old form._]         The _lilie_ on hir stalke grene.       Of _maladie_ the which he hadde endured.    And these from Spenser (sixteenth century):--         Be well aware, quoth then that _ladie_ milde.       At last fair Hesperus in highest _skie_       Had spent his lampe.    (3) In the case of some words ending in -_f_ or -_fe_, which have  the plural in _-ves_: _calf_--_calves_, _half_--_halves_,  _knife_--_knives_, _shelf_--_shelves_, etc.      Special Lists.      43. Material nouns and abstract nouns are always singular. When  such words take a plural ending, they lose their identity, and go over  to other classes (Secs. 15 and 17).      44. Proper nouns are regularly singular, but may be made plural  when we wish to speak of several persons or things bearing the same  name; e.g., _the Washingtons_, _the Americas_.      45. Some words are usually singular, though they are plural in  form. Examples of these are, _optics_, _economics_, _physics_,  _mathematics_, _politics_, and many branches of learning; also _news_,  _pains_ (care), _molasses_, _summons_, _means_: as,--         _Politics_, in its widest extent, is both the science and the art       of government.--_Century Dictionary_.         So live, that when thy _summons comes_, etc.--BRYANT.         It served simply as _a means_ of sight.--PROF. DANA.    [Sidenote: Means _plural_.]    Two words, means and politics, _may be plural_ in their  construction with verbs and adjectives:--         Words, by strongly conveying the passions, by _those means_ which       we have already mentioned, fully compensate for their weakness in       other respects.--BURKE.         With great dexterity _these means_ were now applied.--MOTLEY.         By _these means_, I say, riches will accumulate.--GOLDSMITH.

Some words have no corresponding singular.      aborigines    amends    annals    assets    antipodes    scissors    thanks    spectacles    vespers    victuals    matins    nuptials    oats    obsequies    premises    bellows    billiards    dregs    gallows    tongs    [Sidenote: _Occasionally singular words_.]    Sometimes, however, a few of these words have the construction of  singular nouns. Notice the following:--         They cannot get on without each other any more than one blade of       _a scissors_ can cut without the other.--J.L. LAUGHLIN.         A relic which, if I recollect right, he pronounced to have been       _a tongs_.--IRVING.         Besides this, it is furnished with _a forceps_.--GOLDSMITH.

What _thank_ have ye?--_Bible_      47. Three words were _originally singular_, the present ending _-s_  not being really a plural inflection, but they are regularly construed  as plural: _alms, eaves, riches_.      [Sidenote: _two plurals_.]    48. A few nouns have two plurals differing in meaning.      brother--brothers (by blood), brethren (of a society or church).      cloth--cloths (kinds of cloth), clothes (garments).      die--dies (stamps for coins, etc.), dice (for gaming).      fish--fish (collectively), fishes (individuals or kinds).      genius--geniuses (men of genius), genii (spirits).      index--indexes (to books), indices (signs in algebra).      pea--peas (separately), pease (collectively).      penny--pennies (separately), pence (collectively).      shot--shot (collective balls), shots (number of times fired).    In speaking of coins, _twopence_, _sixpence_, etc., may add _-s_,  making a double plural, as two _sixpences_.      [Sidenote: _One plural, two meanings._]    49. Other words have one plural form with two meanings,--one  corresponding to the singular, the other unlike it.      custom--customs: (1) habits, ways; (2) revenue duties.      letter--letters: (1) the alphabet, or epistles; (2) literature.      number--numbers: (1) figures; (2) poetry, as in the lines,--         I lisped in _numbers_, for the numbers came.--POPE.         Tell me not, in mournful _numbers_.--LONGFELLOW.    _Numbers_ also means issues, or copies, of a periodical.      pain--pains: (1) suffering; (2) care, trouble,      part--parts: (1) divisions; (2) abilities, faculties.      [Sidenote: _Two classes of compound words._]    50. Compound words may be divided into two classes:--    (1) _Those whose parts are so closely joined as to constitute one  word._ These make the last part plural.      courtyard    dormouse    Englishman    fellow-servant    fisherman    Frenchman    forget-me-not    goosequill    handful    mouthful    cupful    maidservant    pianoforte    stepson    spoonful    titmouse    (2) _Those groups in which the first part is the principal one,  followed by a word or phrase making a modifier._ The chief member adds  _-s_ in the plural.      aid-de-camp    attorney at law    billet-doux    commander in chief    court-martial    cousin-german    father-in-law    knight-errant    hanger-on    NOTE.--Some words ending in _-man_ are not compounds of the English  word _man_, but add _-s_; such as _talisman_, _firman_, _Brahman_,  _German_, _Norman_, _Mussulman_, _Ottoman_.      51. Some groups pluralize both parts of the group; as _man singer_,  _manservant_, _woman servant_, _woman singer_.      [Sidenote: _Two methods in use for names with titles._]    52. As to plurals of names with titles, there is some disagreement  among English writers. The title may be plural, as _the Messrs.  Allen_, _the Drs. Brown_, _the Misses Rich_; or the name may be  pluralized.    The former is perhaps more common in present-day use, though the  latter is often found; for example,--         Then came Mr. and Mrs. Briggs, and then _the three Miss       Spinneys_, then Silas Peckham.--DR. HOLMES.         Our immortal Fielding was of the younger branch of the _Earls of       Denbigh_, who drew their origin from the _Counts of       Hapsburgh_.--GIBBON.         The _Miss Flamboroughs_ were reckoned the best dancers in the       parish.--GOLDSMITH.         The _Misses Nettengall's_ young ladies come to the Cathedral       too.--DICKENS.         The _Messrs. Harper_ have done the more than generous thing by       Mr. Du Maurier.--_The Critic_.      53. A number of foreign words have been adopted into English  without change of form. These are said to be _domesticated_, and  retain their foreign plurals.    Others have been adopted, and by long use have altered their power so  as to conform to English words. They are then said to be  _naturalized_, or _Anglicized_, or _Englished_.    [Sidenote: _Domesticated words._]    The domesticated words may retain the original plural. Some of them  have a secondary English plural in _-s_ or _-es_.      Exercise.    Find in the dictionary the plurals of these words:--    I.

Letters, figures, etc., form their plurals by adding _-s_ or  _'s_. Words quoted merely as words, without reference to their  meaning, also add _-s_ or _'s_; as, \"His _9's_ (or _9s_) look like  _7's_ (or _7s_),\" \"Avoid using too many _and's_ (or _ands_),\" \"Change  the _+'s_ (or _+s_) to _-'s_ (or _-s_).\"      CASE.      [Sidenote: _Definition._]    55. Case is an inflection or use of a noun (or pronoun) to show its  relation to other words in the sentence.    In the sentence, \"He sleeps in a felon's cell,\" the word _felon's_  modifies _cell_, and expresses a relation akin to possession; _cell_  has another relation, helping to express the idea of place with the  word _in_.      56. In the general wearing-away of inflections, the number of case  forms has been greatly reduced.    [Sidenote: _Only two_ case forms.]    There are now only two case forms of English nouns,--one for the  _nominative_ and _objective_, one for the _possessive_: consequently  the matter of inflection is a very easy thing to handle in learning  about cases.    [Sidenote: _Reasons for speaking of_ three cases _of nouns_.]    But there are reasons why grammars treat of _three_ cases of nouns  when there are only two forms:--    (1) Because the relations of all words, whether inflected or not, must  be understood for purposes of analysis.    (2) Because pronouns still have three case forms as well as three case  relations.      57. Nouns, then, may be said to have three cases,--the  nominative, the objective, and the possessive.      I. Uses of the Nominative.    58. The nominative case is used as follows:--    (1) _As the subject of a verb_: \"_Water_ seeks its level.\"    (2) _As a predicate noun_, completing a verb, and referring to or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1401"],[0,"Tarzan the Untamed (#6)"],[1,"being  seen from within, while he was at the same time hidden from the view  of anyone who might chance to pass along the post of the sentinel  he had slain. Momentarily he was expecting a patrol or a relief to  appear and discover that the sentinel was missing, when he knew an  immediate and thorough search would be made.    Impatiently he awaited the coming of the man he sought and at  last he was rewarded by the reappearance of the aide who had been  dispatched to fetch him accompanied by an officer of medium size  with fierce, upstanding mustaches. The newcomer strode to the table,  halted and saluted, reporting.  The general acknowledged the salute  and turned toward the girl.    \"Fraulein Kircher,\" he said, \"allow me to present Major Schneider--\"    Tarzan waited to hear no more. Placing a palm upon the sill of  the window he vaulted into the room into the midst of an astounded  company of the Kaiser's officers. With a stride he was at the table  and with a sweep of his hand sent the lamp crashing into the fat  belly of the general who, in his mad effort to escape cremation,  fell over backward, chair and all, upon the floor. Two of the aides  sprang for the ape-man who picked up the first and flung him in the  face of the other.  The girl had leaped from her chair and stood  flattened against the wall. The other officers were calling aloud  for the guard and for help. Tarzan's purpose centered upon but  a single individual and him he never lost sight of. Freed from  attack for an instant he seized Major Schneider, threw him over his  shoulder and was out of the window so quickly that the astonished  assemblage could scarce realize what had occurred.    A single glance showed him that the sentinel's post was still vacant  and a moment later he and his burden were in the shadows of the  hay dump. Major Schneider had made no outcry for the very excellent  reason that his wind was shut off. Now Tarzan released his grasp  enough to permit the man to breathe.    \"If you make a sound you will be choked again,\" he said.    Cautiously and after infinite patience Tarzan passed the final  outpost. Forcing his captive to walk before him he pushed on toward  the west until, late into the night, he re-crossed the railway where  he felt reasonably safe from discovery. The German had cursed and  grumbled and threatened and asked questions; but his only reply  was another prod from Tarzan's sharp war spear. The ape-man herded  him along as he would have driven a hog with the difference that  he would have had more respect and therefore more consideration  for a hog.    Until now Tarzan had given little thought to the details of revenge.  Now he pondered what form the punishment should take. Of only one  thing was he certain--it must end in death.  Like all brave men  and courageous beasts Tarzan had little natural inclination to  torture--none, in fact; but this case was unique in his experience.  An inherent sense of justice called for an eye for an eye and his  recent oath demanded even more. Yes, the creature must suffer even  as he had caused Jane Clayton to suffer. Tarzan could not hope to  make the man suffer as he had suffered, since physical pain may  never approach the exquisiteness of mental torture.    All through the long night the ape-man goaded on the exhausted and  now terrified Hun. The awful silence of his captor wrought upon the  German's nerves. If he would only speak! Again and again Schneider  tried to force or coax a word from him; but always the result was  the same--continued silence and a vicious and painful prod from the  spear point. Schneider was bleeding and sore. He was so exhausted  that he staggered at every step, and often he fell only to be  prodded to his feet again by that terrifying and remorseless spear.    It was not until morning that Tarzan reached a decision and it came  to him then like an inspiration from above. A slow smile touched  his lips and he immediately sought a place to lie up and rest--he  wished his prisoner to be fit now for what lay in store for him.  Ahead was a stream which Tarzan had crossed the day before. He knew  the ford for a drinking place and a likely spot to make an easy  kill. Cautioning the German to utter silence with a gesture the  two approached the stream quietly. Down the game trail Tarzan saw  some deer about to leave the water. He shoved Schneider into the  brush at one side and, squatting next him, waited.  The German  watched the silent giant with puzzled, frightened eyes. In the new  dawn he, for the first time, was able to obtain a good look at his  captor, and, if he had been puzzled and frightened before, those  sensations were nothing to what he experienced now.    Who and what could this almost naked, white savage be?  He had  heard him speak but once--when he had cautioned him to silence--and  then in excellent German and the well-modulated tones of culture.  He watched him now as the fascinated toad watches the snake that  is about to devour it.  He saw the graceful limbs and symmetrical  body motionless as a marble statue as the creature crouched in the  concealment of the leafy foliage. Not a muscle, not a nerve moved.  He saw the deer coming slowly along the trail, down wind and  unsuspecting. He saw a buck pass--an old buck--and then a young and  plump one came opposite the giant in ambush, and Schneider's eyes  went wide and a scream of terror almost broke from his lips as he  saw the agile beast at his side spring straight for the throat of  the young buck and heard from those human lips the hunting roar of  a wild beast. Down went the buck and Tarzan and his captive had  meat. The ape-man ate his raw, but he permitted the German to build  a fire and cook his portion.    The two lay up until late in the afternoon and then took up the  journey once again--a journey that was so frightful to Schneider  because of his ignorance of its destination that he at times groveled  at Tarzan's feet begging for an explanation and for mercy; but on  and on in silence the ape-man went, prodding the failing Hun whenever  the latter faltered.    It was noon of the third day before they reached their destination.  After a steep climb and a short walk they halted at the edge of  a precipitous cliff and Schneider looked down into a narrow gulch  where a single tree grew beside a tiny rivulet and sparse grass  broke from a rock-strewn soil. Tarzan motioned him over the edge;  but the German drew back in terror. The Ape-man seized him and  pushed him roughly toward the brink. \"Descend,\" he said. It was  the second time he had spoken in three days and perhaps his very  silence, ominous in itself, had done more to arouse terror in the  breast of the Boche than even the spear point, ever ready as it  always was.    Schneider looked fearfully over the edge; but was about to essay  the attempt when Tarzan halted him. \"I am Lord Greystoke,\" he  said. \"It was my wife you murdered in the Waziri country. You will  understand now why I came for you.  Descend.\"    The German fell upon his knees. \"I did not murder your wife,\"  he cried. \"Have mercy! I did not murder your wife.  I do not know  anything about--\"    \"Descend!\" snapped Tarzan, raising the point of his spear.  He knew  that the man lied and was not surprised that he did.  A man who  would murder for no cause would lie for less.  Schneider still  hesitated and pled. The ape-man jabbed him with the spear and Schneider  slid fearfully over the top and began the perilous descent. Tarzan  accompanied and assisted him over the worst places until at last  they were within a few feet of the bottom.    \"Be quiet now,\" cautioned the ape-man. He pointed at the entrance  to what appeared to be a cave at the far end of the gulch. \"There  is a hungry lion in there. If you can reach that tree before  he discovers you, you will have several days longer in which to  enjoy life and then--when you are too weak to cling longer to the  branches of the tree Numa, the man-eater, will feed again for the  last time.\" He pushed Schneider from his foothold to the ground  below. \"Now run,\" he said.    The German trembling in terror started for the tree. He had almost  reached it when a horrid roar broke from the mouth of the cave and  almost simultaneously a gaunt, hunger mad lion leaped into the  daylight of the gulch. Schneider had but a few yards to cover;  but the lion flew over the ground to circumvent him while Tarzan  watched the race with a slight smile upon his lips.    Schneider won by a slender margin, and as Tarzan scaled the cliff  to the summit, he heard behind him mingled with the roaring of the  baffled cat, the gibbering of a human voice that was at the same  time more bestial than the beast's.    Upon the brink of the cliff the ape-man turned and looked back  into the gulch. High in the tree the German clung frantically to  a branch across which his body lay. Beneath him was Numa--waiting.    The ape-man raised his face to Kudu, the sun, and from his mighty  chest rose the savage victory cry of the bull ape.          Chapter III    In the German Lines      Tarzan was not yet fully revenged. There were many millions of  Germans yet alive--enough to keep Tarzan pleasantly occupied the  balance of his life, and yet not enough, should he kill them all,  to recompense him for the great loss he had suffered--nor could  the death of all those million Germans bring back his loved one.    While in the German camp in the Pare Mountains, which lie just  east of the boundary line between German and British East Africa,  Tarzan had overheard enough to suggest that the British were getting  the worst of the fighting in Africa. At first he had given the  matter but little thought, since, after the death of his wife, the  one strong tie that had held him to civilization, he had renounced  all mankind, considering himself no longer man, but ape.    After accounting for Schneider as satisfactorily as lay within his"]]]
