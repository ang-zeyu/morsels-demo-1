We are now sending a scout to Rome; but no  man sends a cowardly scout, who, if he only hears a noise and sees a  shadow anywhere, comes running back in terror and reports that the enemy  is close at hand. So now if you should come and tell us: \"Fearful is the  state of affairs at Rome; terrible is death; terrible is exile; terrible  is calumny; terrible is poverty; fly, my friends, the enemy is near,\" we  shall answer: \"Begone, prophesy for yourself; we have committed only one  fault, that we sent such a scout.\"    Diogenes, who was sent as a scout before you, made a different report to  us. He says that death is no evil, for neither is it base; he says that  fame (reputation) is the noise of madmen. And what has this spy said  about pain, about pleasure, and about poverty? He says that to be naked  is better than any purple robe, and to sleep on the bare ground is the  softest bed; and he gives as a proof of each thing that he affirms his  own courage, his tranquillity, his freedom, and the healthy appearance  and compactness of his body. There is no enemy near, he says; all is  peace. How so, Diogenes? \"See,\" he replies, \"if I am struck, if I have  been wounded, if I have fled from any man.\" This is what a scout ought  to be. But you come to us and tell us one thing after another. Will you  not go back, and you will see clearer when you have laid aside fear?           *       *       *       *       *    ON THE SAME.--If these things are true, and if we are not silly, and are  not acting hypocritically when we say that the good of man is in the  will, and the evil too, and that everything else does not concern us,  why are we still disturbed, why are we still afraid? The things about  which we have been busied are in no man's power; and the things which  are in the power of others, we care not for. What kind of trouble have  we still?    But give me directions. Why should I give you directions? Has not Zeus  given you directions? Has he not given to you what is your own free from  hindrance and free from impediment, and what is not your own subject to  hindrance and impediment? What directions then, what kind of orders did  you bring when you came from him? Keep by every means what is your own;  do not desire what belongs to others. Fidelity (integrity) is your own,  virtuous shame is your own; who then can take these things from you? who  else than yourself will hinder you from using them? But how do you act?  When you seek what is not your own, you lose that which is your own.  Having such promptings and commands from Zeus, what kind do you still  ask from me? Am I more powerful than he, am I more worthy of confidence?  But if you observe these, do you want any others besides? \"Well, but he  has not given these orders,\" you will say. Produce your praecognitions  ([Greek: prolaepseis]), produce these proofs of philosophers, produce  what you have often heard, and produce what you have said yourself,  produce what you have read, produce what you have meditated on; and you  will then see that all these things are from God.    If I have set my admiration on the poor body, I have given myself up to  be a slave; if on my poor possessions, I also make myself a slave. For I  immediately make it plain with what I may be caught; as if the snake  draws in his head, I tell you to strike that part of him which he  guards; and do you be assured that whatever part you choose to guard,  that part your master will attack. Remembering this, whom will you still  flatter or fear?    But I should like to sit where the Senators sit. Do you see that you are  putting yourself in straits, you are squeezing yourself? How then shall  I see well in any other way in the amphitheatre? Man, do not be a  spectator at all, and you will not be squeezed. Why do you give yourself  trouble? Or wait a little, and when the spectacle is over, seat yourself  in the place reserved for the Senators and sun yourself. For remember  this general truth, that it is we who squeeze ourselves, who put  ourselves in straits; that is, our opinions squeeze us and put us in  straits. For what is it to be reviled? Stand by a stone and revile it,  and what will you gain? If then a man listens like a stone, what profit  is there to the reviler? But if the reviler has as a stepping-stone (or  ladder) the weakness of him who is reviled, then he accomplishes  something. Strip him. What do you mean by him? Lay hold of his garment,  strip it off. I have insulted you. Much good may it do you.    This was the practice of Socrates; this was the reason why he always had  one face. But we choose to practise and study anything rather than the  means by which we shall be unimpeded and free. You say: \"Philosophers  talk paradoxes.\" But are there no paradoxes in the other arts? And what  is more paradoxical than to puncture a man's eye in order that he may  see? If any one said this to a man ignorant of the surgical art, would  he not ridicule the speaker? Where is the wonder, then, if in philosophy  also many things which are true appear paradoxical to the inexperienced?           *       *       *       *       *    IN HOW MANY WAYS APPEARANCES EXIST, AND WHAT AIDS WE SHOULD PROVIDE  AGAINST THEM.--Appearances are to us in four ways. For either things  appear as they are; or they are not, and do not even appear to be; or  they are, and do not appear to be; or they are not, and yet appear to  be. Further, in all these cases to form a right judgment (to hit the  mark) is the office of an educated man. But whatever it is that annoys  (troubles) us, to that we ought to apply a remedy. If the sophisms of  Pyrrho and of the Academics are what annoys (troubles), we must apply  the remedy to them. If it is the persuasion of appearances, by which  some things appear to be good, when they are not good, let us seek a  remedy for this. If it is habit which annoys us, we must try to seek aid  against habit. What aid, then, can we find against habit? The contrary  habit. You hear the ignorant say: \"That unfortunate person is dead; his  father and mother are overpowered with sorrow; he was cut off by an  untimely death and in a foreign land.\" Hear the contrary way of  speaking. Tear yourself from these expressions; oppose to one habit the  contrary habit; to sophistry oppose reason, and the exercise and  discipline of reason; against persuasive (deceitful) appearances we  ought to have manifest praecognitions ([Greek: prolaepseis]), cleared of  all impurities and ready to hand.    When death appears an evil, we ought to have this rule in readiness,  that it is fit to avoid evil things, and that death is a necessary  thing. For what shall I do, and where shall I escape it? Suppose that I  am not Sarpedon, the son of Zeus, nor able to speak in this noble way. I  will go and I am resolved either to behave bravely myself or to give to  another the opportunity of doing so; if I cannot succeed in doing  anything myself, I will not grudge another the doing of something noble.  Suppose that it is above our power to act thus; is it not in our power  to reason thus? Tell me where I can escape death; discover for me the  country, show me the men to whom I must go, whom death does not visit.  Discover to me a charm against death. If I have not one, what do you  wish me to do? I cannot escape from death. Shall I not escape from the  fear of death, but shall I die lamenting and trembling? For the origin  of perturbation is this, to wish for something, and that this should not  happen. Therefore if I am able to change externals according to my wish,  I change them; but if I cannot, I am ready to tear out the eyes of him  who hinders me. For the nature of man is not to endure to be deprived of  the good, and not to endure the falling into the evil. Then at last,  when I am neither able to change circumstances nor to tear out the eyes  of him who hinders me, I sit down and groan, and abuse whom I can, Zeus  and the rest of the gods. For if they do not care for me, what are they  to me? Yes, but you will be an impious man. In what respect, then, will  it be worse for me than it is now? To sum up, remember that unless piety  and your interest be in the same thing, piety cannot be maintained in  any man. Do not these things seem necessary (true)?           *       *       *       *       *    THAT WE OUGHT NOT TO BE ANGRY WITH MEN; AND WHAT ARE THE SMALL AND THE  GREAT THINGS AMONG MEN.--What is the cause of assenting to anything? The  fact that it appears to be true. It is not possible then to assent to  that which appears not to be true. Why? Because this is the nature of  the understanding, to incline to the true, to be dissatisfied with the  false, and in matters uncertain to withhold assent. What is the proof of  this? Imagine (persuade yourself), if you can, that it is now night. It  is not possible. Take away your persuasion that it is day. It is not  possible. Persuade yourself or take away your persuasion that the stars  are even in number. It is impossible. When then any man assents to that  which is false, be assured that he did not intend to assent to it as  false, for every soul is unwillingly deprived of the truth, as Plato  says; but the falsity seemed to him to be true. Well, in acts what have  we of the like kind as we have here truth or falsehood? We have the fit  and the not fit (duty and not duty), the profitable and the  unprofitable, that which is suitable to a person and that which is not,  and whatever is like these. Can then a man think that a thing is useful  to him and not choose it? He cannot. How says Medea?      \"'Tis true I know what evil I shall do,    But passion overpowers the better counsel.\"    She thought that to indulge her passion and take vengeance on her  husband was more profitable than to spare her children. It was so; but  she was deceived.

And in that  House were many lights, and no sound. And so had it been through an  uncountable Eternity of Years. Always those steady lights, and no  whisper of sound--not even such as our distance-microphones could have  discovered. And the danger of this House was accounted the greatest  danger of all those Lands.    And round by the House of Silence, wound the Road Where The Silent Ones  Walk. And concerning this Road, which passed out of the Unknown Lands,  nigh by the Place of the Ab-humans, where was always the green, luminous  mist, nothing was known; save that it was held that, of all the works  about the Mighty Pyramid, it was, alone, the one that was bred, long  ages past, of healthy human toil and labour. And on this point alone,  had a thousand books, and more, been writ; and all contrary, and so to  no end, as is ever the way in such matters.    And as it was with the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, so it was with  all those other monstrous things ... whole libraries had there been made  upon this and upon that; and many a thousand million mouldered into the  forgotten dust of the earlier world.    I mind me now that presently I stepped upon the central  travelling-roadway which spanned the one thousandth plateau of the Great  Redoubt. And this lay six miles and thirty fathoms above the Plain of  the Night Land, and was somewhat of a great mile or more across. And so,  in a few minutes, I was at the South-Eastern wall, and looking out  through The Great Embrasure towards the Three Silver-fire Holes, that  shone before the Thing That Nods, away down, far in the South-East.  Southward of this, but nearer, there rose the vast bulk of the  South-East Watcher--The Watching Thing of the South-East. And to the  right and to the left of the squat monster burned the Torches; maybe  half-a-mile upon each side; yet sufficient light they threw to show the  lumbered-forward head of the never-sleeping Brute.    To the East, as I stood there in the quietness of the Sleeping-Time on  the One Thousandth Plateau, I heard a far, dreadful sound, down in the  lightless East; and, presently, again--a strange, dreadful laughter,  deep as a low thunder among the mountains. And because this sound came  odd whiles from the Unknown Lands beyond the Valley of The Hounds, we  had named that far and never-seen Place \"The Country Whence Comes The  Great Laughter.\" And though I had heard the sound, many and oft a time,  yet did I never hear it without a most strange thrilling of my heart,  and a sense of my littleness, and of the utter terror which had beset  the last millions of the world.    Yet, because I had heard the Laughter oft, I paid not over-long  attention to my thoughts upon it; and when, in a little it died away  into that Eastern Darkness, I turned my spy-glass upon the Giants' Pit,  which lay to the South of the Giants' Kilns. And these same Kilns were  tended by the giants, and the light of the Kilns was red and fitful, and  threw wavering shadows and lights across the mouth of the pit; so that I  saw giants crawling up out of the pit; but not properly seen, by reason  of the dance of the shadows. And so, because ever there was so much to  behold, I looked away, presently, to that which was plainer to be  examined.    To the back of the Giants' Pit was a great, black Headland, that stood  vast, between the Valley of The Hounds (where lived the monstrous Night  Hounds) and the Giants. And the light of the Kilns struck the brow of  this black Headland; so that, constantly, I saw things peer over the  edge, coming forward a little into the light of the Kilns, and drawing  back swiftly into the shadows. And thus it had been ever, through the  uncounted ages; so that the Headland was known as The Headland From  Which Strange Things Peer; and thus was it marked in our maps and charts  of that grim world.    And so I could go on ever; but that I fear to weary; and yet, whether I  do weary, or not, I must tell of this country that I see, even now as I  set my thoughts down, so plainly that my memory wanders in a hushed and  secret fashion along its starkness, and amid its strange and dread  habitants, so that it is but by an effort I realise me that my body is  not there in this very moment that I write. And so to further tellings:    Before me ran the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk; and I searched it, as  many a time in my earlier youth had I, with the spy-glass; for my heart  was always stirred mightily by the sight of those Silent Ones.    And, presently, alone in all the miles of that night-grey road, I saw  one in the field of my glass--a quiet, cloaked figure, moving along,  shrouded, and looking neither to right nor left. And thus was it with  these beings ever. It was told about in the Redoubt that they would harm  no human, if but the human did keep a fair distance from them; but that  it were wise never to come close upon one. And this I can well believe.    And so, searching the road with my gaze, I passed beyond this Silent  One, and past the place where the road, sweeping vastly to the  South-East, was lit a space, strangely, by the light from the  Silver-fire Holes. And thus at last to where it swayed to the South of  the Dark Palace, and thence Southward still, until it passed round to  the Westward, beyond the mountain bulk of the Watching Thing in the  South--the hugest monster in all the visible Night Lands. My spy-glass  showed it to me with clearness--a living hill of watchfulness, known to  us as The Watcher Of The South. It brooded there, squat and tremendous,  hunched over the pale radiance of the Glowing Dome.    Much, I know, had been writ concerning this Odd, Vast Watcher; for it  had grown out of the blackness of the South Unknown Lands a million  years gone; and the steady growing nearness of it had been noted and set  out at length by the men they called Monstruwacans; so that it was  possible to search in our libraries, and learn of the very coming of  this Beast in the olden-time.    And, while I mind me, there were even then, and always, men named  Monstruwacans, whose duty it was to take heed of the great Forces, and  to watch the Monsters and the Beasts that beset the great Pyramid, and  measure and record, and have so full a knowledge of these same that, did  one but sway an head in the darkness, the same matter was set down with  particularness in the Records.    And, so to tell more about the South Watcher. A million years gone, as I  have told, came it out from the blackness of the South, and grew  steadily nearer through twenty thousand years; but so slow that in no  one year could a man perceive that it had moved.    Yet it had movement, and had come thus far upon its road to the Redoubt,  when the Glowing Dome rose out of the ground before it--growing slowly.  And this had stayed the way of the Monster; so that through an eternity  it had looked towards the Pyramid across the pale glare of the Dome, and  seeming to have no power to advance nearer.    And because of this, much had been writ to prove that there were other  forces than evil at work in the Night Lands, about the Last Redoubt. And  this I have always thought to be wisely said; and, indeed, there to be  no doubt to the matter, for there were many things in the time of which  I have knowledge, which seemed to make clear that, even as the Forces of  Darkness were loose upon the End of Man; so were there other Forces out  to do battle with the Terror; though in ways most strange and unthought  of by the human mind. And of this I shall have more to tell anon.    And here, before I go further with my telling, let me set out some of  that knowledge which yet remains so clear within my mind and heart. Of  the coming of these monstrosities and evil Forces, no man could say much  with verity; for the evil of it began before the Histories of the Great  Redoubt were shaped; aye, even before the sun had lost all power to  light; though, it must not be a thing of certainty, that even at this  far time the invisible, black heavens held no warmth for this world; but  of this I have no room to tell; and must pass on to that of which I have  a more certain knowledge.    The evil must surely have begun in the Days of the Darkening (which I  might liken to a story which was believed doubtfully, much as we of this  day believe the story of the Creation). A dim record there was of olden  sciences (that are yet far off in our future) which, disturbing the  unmeasurable Outward Powers, had allowed to pass the Barrier of Life  some of those Monsters and Ab-human creatures, which are so wondrously  cushioned from us at this normal present. And thus there had  materialized, and in other cases developed, grotesque and horrible  Creatures, which now beset the humans of this world. And where there was  no power to take on material form, there had been allowed to certain  dreadful Forces to have power to affect the life of the human spirit.  And this growing very dreadful, and the world full of lawlessness and  degeneracy, there had banded together the sound millions, and built the  Last Redoubt; there in the twilight of the world--so it seems to us, and  yet to them (bred at last to the peace of usage) as it were the  Beginning; and this I can make no clearer; and none hath right to expect  it; for my task is very great, and beyond the power of human skill.    And when the humans had built the great Pyramid, it had one thousand  three hundred and twenty floors; and the thickness of each floor was  according to the strength of its need. And the whole height of this  pyramid exceeded seven miles, by near a mile, and above it was a tower  from which the Watchmen looked (these being called the Monstruwacans).  But where the Redoubt was built, I know not; save that I believe in a  mighty valley, of which I may tell more in due time.    And when the Pyramid was built, the last"]]]
