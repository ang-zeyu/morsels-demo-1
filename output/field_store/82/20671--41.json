ANGEL, a gold coin, first used in France (_angelot, ange_) in 1340,  and introduced into England by Edward IV. in 1465 as a new issue of  the \"noble,\" and so at first called the \"angel-noble.\" It varied in  value between that period and the time of Charles I. (when it was  last coined) from 6s. 8d. to 10s. The name was derived from the  representation it bore of St. Michael and the dragon. The angel was the  coin given to those who came to be touched for the disease known  as king's evil; after it was no longer coined, medals, called  touch-pieces, with the same device, were given instead.        ANGELICA, a genus of plants of the natural order _Umbelliferae_,  represented in Britain by one species, _A. sylvestris_, a tall  perennial herb with large bipinnate leaves and large compound umbels  of white or purple flowers. The name Angelica is popularly given to  a plant of an allied genus, _Archangelica officinalis_, the tender  shoots of which are used in making certain kinds of aromatic  sweetmeats. _Angelica balsam_ is obtained by extracting the roots with  alcohol, evaporating and extracting the residue with ether. It is of  a dark brown colour and contains angelica oil, angelica wax and  angelicin, C_{18}_H_{30}_O. The essential oil of the roots of  _Angelica archangelica_ contains ss-terebangelene, C_{10}_H_{16}, and  other terpenes; the oil of the seeds also contains ss-terebangelene,  together with methylethylacetic acid and hydroxymyristic acid.    The angelica tree is a member of the order _Avaliaceae_, a species of  _Aralia (A. spinosa_), a native of North America; it grows 8 to 12 ft.  high, has a simple prickle-bearing stem forming an umbrella-like head,  and much divided leaves.        ANGELICO, FRA (1387-1455), Italian painter. Il Beato Fra Giovanni  Angelico da Fiesole is the name given to a far-famed painter-friar of  the Florentine state in the 15th century, the representative, beyond  all other men, of pietistic painting. He is often, but not accurately,  termed simply \"Fiesole,\" which is merely the name of the town where he  first took the vows; more often Fra Angelico. If we turn his compound  designation into English, it runs thus--\"the Beatified Friar John the  Angelic of Fiesole.\" In his lifetime he was known no doubt simply as  Fra Giovanni or Friar John; \"The Angelic\" is a laudatory term which  was assigned to him at an early date,--we find it in use within thirty  years after his death; and, at some period which is not defined in  our authorities, he was beatified by due ecclesiastical process. His  baptismal name was Guido, Giovanni being only his name in religion. He  was born at Vicchio, in the Tuscan province of Mugello, of unknown  but seemingly well-to-do parentage, in 1387 (not 1390 as sometimes  stated); in 1407 he became a novice in the convent of S. Domenico at  Fiesole, and in 1408 he took the vows and entered the Dominican order.  Whether he had previously been a painter by profession is not certain,  but may be pronounced probable. The painter named Lorenzo Monaco may  have contributed to his art-training, and the influence of the Sienese  school is discernible in his work.    [v.02 p.0007]    According to Vasari, the first paintings of this artist were in the  Certosa of Florence; none such exist there now. His earliest extant  performances, in considerable number, are at Cortona, whither he  was sent during his novitiate, and here apparently he spent all the  opening years of his monastic life. His first works executed in fresco  were probably those, now destroyed, which he painted in the convent  of S. Domenico in this city; as a fresco-painter, he may have worked  under, or as a follower of, Gherardo Starnina. From 1418 to 1436  he was back at Fiesole; in 1436 he was transferred to the Dominican  convent of S. Marco in Florence, and in 1438 undertook to paint the  altarpiece for the choir, followed by many other works; he may have  studied about this time the renowned frescoes in the Brancacci chapel  in the Florentine church of the Carmine and also the paintings of  Orcagna. In or about 1445 he was invited by the pope to Rome. The pope  who reigned from 1431 to 1447 was Eugenius IV., and he it was who in  1445 appointed another Dominican friar, a colleague of Angelico, to  be archbishop of Florence. If the story (first told by Vasari) is  true--that this appointment was made at the suggestion of Angelico  only after the archbishopric had been offered to himself, and by  him declined on the ground of his inaptitude for so elevated and  responsible a station--Eugenius, and not (as stated by Vasari) his  successor Nicholas V., must have been the pope who sent the invitation  and made the offer to Fra Giovanni, for Nicholas only succeeded in  1447. The whole statement lacks authentication, though in itself  credible enough. Certain it is that Angelico was staying in Rome in  the first half of 1447; and he painted in the Vatican the Cappella del  Sacramento, which was afterwards demolished by Paul III. In June  1447 he proceeded to Orvieto, to paint in the Cappella Nuova of the  cathedral, with the co-operation of his pupil Benozzo Gozzoli. He  afterwards returned to Rome to paint the chapel of Nicholas V. In  this capital he died in 1455, and he lies buried in the church of the  Minerva.    According to all the accounts which have reached us, few men on  whom the distinction of beatification has been conferred could  have deserved it more nobly than Fra Giovanni. He led a holy and  self-denying life, shunning all advancement, and was a brother to  the poor; no man ever saw him angered. He painted with unceasing  diligence, treating none but sacred subjects; he never retouched  or altered his work, probably with a religious feeling that such as  divine providence allowed the thing to come, such it should remain. He  was wont to say that he who illustrates the acts of Christ should  be with Christ. It is averred that he never handled a brush without  fervent prayer and he wept when he painted a Crucifixion. The Last  Judgment and the Annunciation were two of the subjects he most  frequently treated.    Bearing in mind the details already given as to the dates of Fra  Giovanni's sojournings in various localities, the reader will be able  to trace approximately the sequence of the works which we now proceed  to name as among his most important productions. In Florence, in the  convent of S. Marco (now converted into a national museum), a series  of frescoes, beginning towards 1443; in the first cloister is the  Crucifixion with St. Dominic kneeling; and the same treatment recurs on  a wall near the dormitory; in the chapterhouse is a third Crucifixion,  with the Virgin swooning, a composition of twenty life-sized  figures--the red background, which has a strange and harsh effect, is  the misdoing of some restorer; an \"Annunciation,\" the figures of about  three-fourths of life-size, in a dormitory; in the adjoining passage,  the \"Virgin enthroned,\" with four saints; on the wall of a cell,  the \"Coronation of the Virgin,\" with Saints Paul, Thomas Aquinas,  Benedict, Dominic, Francis and Peter Martyr; two Dominicans welcoming  Jesus, habited as a pilgrim; an \"Adoration of the Magi\"; the \"Marys  at the Sepulchre.\" All these works are later than the altarpiece which  Angelico painted (as before mentioned) for the choir connected  with this convent, and which is now in the academy of Florence; it  represents the Virgin with Saints Cosmas and Damian (the patrons of  the Medici family), Dominic, Peter, Francis, Mark, John Evangelist and  Stephen; the pediment illustrated the lives of Cosmas and Damian, but  it has long been severed from the main subject.

Yes mam, I will do anything if Albert can get better. 'All right  then', she says. 'Catch the Federal Prison car and get off at Butler  St.' In them days that car came down Forrest Ave. 'When you get to  Butler St.', she says, 'walk up to Clifton St. and go to such and such a  number. Knock on the door and a 'oman by the name of Mrs. Hirshpath will  come ter the door. Fore she let you in she go ask who sent you there;  when you tell 'er, she'll let you in. Now lemme tell you she keeps two  quarts of whisky all the time and you have ter drink a little with her;  sides that she cusses nearly every word she speaks; but don't let that  scare you; she will sho get your son up if it kin be done.' Sho nuff  that old 'oman did jest lak Mrs. Yancy said she would do. She had a  harsh voice and she spoke right snappy. When she let me in she said, sit  down. You lak whisky?' I said, well, I take a little dram sometimes.  'Well, here take some of this', she said. I poured a little bit and  drank it kinda lak I wuz afraid. She cursed and said 'I ain't go conjure  you. Drink it.' She got the cards and told me to cut 'em, so I did.  Looking at the cards, she said: 'You lak ter wait too long; they got him  marching to the cemetery. The poor thing! I'll fix those devils. (A  profane word was used instead of devils). He got a knot on his side,  ain't he?' Yes, Mam, I said. That 'oman told me everything that was  wrong with Albert and zackly how he acted. All at once she said; 'If  them d----d things had hatched in him it would a been too late. If you  do zackly lak I tell you I'll get him up from there.' I sho will, I told  her. 'Well, there's a stable sets east of his house. His house got three  rooms and a path go straight to the stable. I see it there where he  hangs his harness. Yes, I see it all, the devils! Have you got any  money?' Yes, mam, a little, I said. 'All right then,' she said. 'Go to  the drug store and get 5c worth of blue stone; 5c wheat bran; and go ter  a fish market and ask 'em ter give you a little fish brine; then go in  the woods and get some poke-root berries. Now, there's two kinds of  poke-root berries, the red skin and the white skin berry. Put all this  in a pot, mix with it the guts from a green gourd and 9 parts of red  pepper. Make a poultice and put to his side on that knot. Now, listen,  your son will be afraid and think you are trying ter do something ter  him but be gentle and persuade him that its fer his good.' Child, he sho  did act funny when I told him I wanted to treat his side. I had ter tell  him I wuz carrying out doctors orders so he could get well. He reared  and fussed and said he didn't want that mess on him. I told him the  doctor says you do very well till you go ter the horse lot then you go  blind and you can't see. He looked at me. 'Sho nuff, Ma, he said, 'that  sho is the trufe. I have ter always call one of the chillun when I go  there cause I can't see how ter get back ter the house.' Well, that  convinced him and he let me fix the medicine for him. I put him ter bed  and made the poultice, then I put it ter his side. Now this 'oman said  no one wuz ter take it off the next morning but me. I wuz suppose ter  fix three, one each night, and after taking each one off ter bury it lak  dead folks is buried, east and west, and ter make a real grave out of  each one. Well, when I told him not ter move it the next morning, but  let me move it, he got funny again and wanted to know why. Do you know I  had ter play lak I could move it without messing up my bed clothes and  if he moved it he might waste it all. Finally he said he would call me  the next morning. Sho nuff, the next morning he called me, ma! ma! come  take it off. I went in the room and he wuz smiling. I slept all night  long he said, and I feel so much better. I'm so glad, I said, and do you  know he could reach down and fasten up his shoe and it had been a long  time since he could do that. Later that day I slipped out and made my  first grave under the fig bush in the garden. I even put up head boards,  too. That night Albert said, 'Mama, fix another one. I feel so much  better.' I sho will, I said. Thank God you're better; so fer three  nights I fixed poultices and put ter his side and each morning he would  tell me how much better he felt. Then the last morning I wuz fixing  breakfast and he sat in the next room. After while Albert jumped up and  hollered, Ma! Ma!' What is it,' I said. 'Mama, that knot is gone. It  dropped down in my pants.' What! I cried. Where is it? Chile, we looked  but we didn't find anything, but the knot had sho gone. Der 'oman had  told me ter come back when the knot moved and she would tell me what  else ter do. That same day I went ter see her and when I told her she  just shouted, 'I fixed 'em, The devils! Now, says she, do you [TR:  know?] where you can get a few leaves off a yellow peachtree. It must be  a yellow peach tree, though. Yes, mam, I says to her. I have a yellow  peachtree right there in my yard. Well, she says, get a handful of  leaves, then take a knife and scrape the bark up, then make a tea and  give him so it will heal up the poison from that knot in his side, also  mix a few jimson weeds with it. I come home and told him I wanted ter  give him a tea. He got scared and said, what fer, Ma? I had ter tell him  I wuz still carrying out the doctor's orders. Well, he let me give him  the tea and that boy got well. I went back to Mrs. Hirshpath and told  her my son was well and I wanted to pay her. Go on, she said, keep the  dollar and send your chillun ter school. This sho happened ter me and I  know people kin fix you. Yes sir.\"    The next story was told to Mrs. Heard by Mrs. Hirshpath, the woman who  cured her son.    I used to go see that 'oman quite a bit and even sent some of my  friends ter her. One day while I wuz there she told me about this piece  of work she did.    \"There was a young man and his wife and they worked fer some white  folks. They had jest married and wuz trying ter save some money ter buy  a home with. All at onct the young man went blind and it almost run him  and his wife crazy cause they didn't know what in the world ter do.  Well, somebody told him and her about Mrs. Hirshpath, so they went ter  see her. One day, says Mrs. Hirshpath, a big fine carriage drew up in  front of her door and the coachman helped him to her door. She asked him  who sent him and he told her. She only charged 50c for giving advice and  after you wuz cured it wuz up ter you to give her what you wanted to.  Well, this man gave her 50c and she talked ter him. She says, boy, you  go home and don't you put that cap on no more. What cap? he says. That  cap you wears ter clean up the stables with, cause somebody done dressed  that cap fer you, and every time you perspire and it run down ter your  eyes it makes you blind. You jest get that cap and bring it ter me. I'll  fix 'em; they's trying ter make you blind, but I go let you see. The boy  was overjoyed, and sho nuff he went back and brought her that cap, and  it wuzn't long fore he could see good as you and me. He brought that  'oman $50, but she wouldn't take but $25 and give the other $25 back ter  him.    \"What I done told you is the trufe, every word of it; I know some other  things that happened but you come back anudder day fer that.\"          PLANTATION LIFE    GEORGIA BAKER, Age 87  369 Meigs Street  Athens, Georgia    Written by:  Mrs. Sadie B. Hornsby [HW: (White)]  Athens    Edited by:  Mrs. Sarah H. Hall  Athens    and  John N. Booth  Dist. Supvr.  Federal Writers' Project  Residencies 6 & 7  Augusta, Ga.    August 4, 1938      Georgia's address proved to be the home of her daughter, Ida Baker. The  clean-swept walks of the small yard were brightened by borders of gay  colored zinnias and marigolds in front of the drab looking two-story,  frame house. \"Come in,\" answered Ida, in response to a knock at the  front door. \"Yessum, Mammy's here. Go right in dat dere room and you'll  find her.\"    Standing by the fireplace of the next room was a thin, very black woman  engaged in lighting her pipe. A green checked gingham apron partially  covered her faded blue frock over which she wore a black shirtwaist  fastened together with \"safety first\" pins. A white cloth, tied turban  fashion about her head, and gray cotton hose worn with black and white  slippers that were run down at the heels, completed her costume.    \"Good mornin'. Yessum, dis here's Georgia,\" was her greeting. \"Let's go  in dar whar Ida is so us can set down. I don't know what you come for,  but I guess I'll soon find out.\"    Georgia was eager to talk but her articulation had been impaired by a  paralytic stroke and at times it was difficult to understand her jumble  of words. After observance of the amenities; comments on the weather,  health and such subjects, she began:    \"Whar was I born? Why I was born on de plantation of a great man. It was  Marse Alec Stephens' plantation 'bout a mile and a half from  Crawfordville, in Taliaferro County. Mary and Grandison Tilly was my Ma  and Pa. Ma was cook up at de big house and she died when I was jus' a  little gal. Pa was a field hand, and he belonged to Marse Britt Tilly.    \"Dere was four of us chillun: me, and Mary, and Frances, and Mack,\" she  counted on the fingers of one hand. \"Marse Alec let Marse Jim Johnson  have Mack for his bodyguard. Frances, she wuked in de field, and Mary  was de baby--she was too little to wuk. Me, I was 14 years old when de  war was over. I swept yards, toted water to de field, and played 'round  de house and yard wid de rest of de chillun.    \"De long, log houses what us lived in was called \"shotgun\" houses 'cause  dey had three rooms, one behind de other in a row lak de barrel of a  shotgun. All de chillun slept in one end room and de grown folkses slept  in de other end room. De kitchen whar us cooked and et was de middle  room."]]]
