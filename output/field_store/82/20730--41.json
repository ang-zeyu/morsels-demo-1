It was an honored  guest at a wedding, a christening, or a funeral. The minister whose  hands were laid in baptismal blessing on babes, or raised in the holy  sacrament of love over brides, lifted also the glass; and the selfsame  lips which had spoken the last words over the dead, drank and made merry  presently afterward among the decanters on the side-board. It mattered  not for what the building was intended--whether for church, school, or  parsonage, rum was the grand master of ceremonies, the indispensable  celebrant at the various stages of its completion. The party who dug the  parson out after a snow-storm, verily got their reward, a sort of  prelibation of the visionary sweets of that land, flowing not, according  to the Jewish notion, with milk and _honey_, but according to the  revised version of Yankeedom, with milk and _rum_. Rum was, forsooth, a  very decent devil, if judged by the exalted character of the company it  kept. It stood high on the rungs of the social ladder and pulled and  pushed men from it by thousands to wretchedness and ruin. So flagrant  and universal was the drinking customs of Boston then that dealers  offered on the commons during holidays, without let or hindrance, the  drunkard's glass to the crowds thronging by extemporized booths and  bars. Shocking as was the excesses of this period \"nothing comparatively  was heard on the subject of intemperance--it was seldom a theme for the  essayist--the newspapers scarcely acknowledged its existence, excepting  occasionally in connection with some catastrophes or crimes--the  Christian and patriot, while they perceived its ravages, formed no plans  for its overthrow--and it did not occur to any that a paper devoted  mainly to its suppression, might be made a direct and successful engine  in the great work of reform. Private expostulations and individual  confessions were indeed sometimes made; but no systematic efforts were  adopted to give precision to the views or a bias to the sentiments of  the people.\" Such was the state of public morals and the state of public  sentiment up to the year 1826, when there occurred a change. This change  was brought about chiefly through the instrumentality of a Baptist city  missionary, the Rev. William Collier. His labors among the poor of  Boston had doubtless revealed to him the bestial character of  intemperance, and the necessity of doing something to check and put an  end to the havoc it was working. With this design he established the  _National Philanthropist_ in Boston, March 4, 1826. The editor was one  of Garrison's earliest acquaintances in the city. Garrison went after  awhile to board with him, and still later entered the office of the  _Philanthropist_ as a type-setter. The printer of the paper, Nathaniel  H. White and young Garrison, occupied the same room at Mr. Collier's.  And so almost before our hero was aware, he had launched his bark upon  the sea of the temperance reform. Presently, when the founder of the  paper retired, it seemed the most natural thing in the world, that the  young journeyman printer, with his editorial experience and ability,  should succeed him as editor. His room-mate, White, bought the  _Philanthropist_, and in April 1828, formally installed Garrison into  its editorship. Into this new work he carried all his moral earnestness  and enthusiasm of purpose. The paper grew under his hand in size,  typographical appearance, and in editorial force and capacity. It was a  wide-awake sentinel on the wall of society; and week after week its  columns bristled and flashed with apposite facts, telling arguments,  shrewd suggestions, cogent appeals to the community to destroy the  accursed thing. No better education could he have had as the preparation  for his life work. He began to understand then the strength of  deep-seated public evils, to acquaint himself with the methods and  instruments with which to attack them. The _Philanthropist_ was a sort  of forerunner, so far as the training in intelligent and effective  agitation was concerned, of the _Genius of Universal Emancipation_ and  of the _Liberator_. One cannot read his sketch of the progress made by  the temperance reform, from which I have already quoted, and published  by him in the _Philanthropist_ in April, 1828, without being struck by  the strong similitude of the temperance to the anti-slavery movement in  their beginnings. \"When this paper was first proposed,\" the young  temperance editor records, \"it met with a repulsion which would have  utterly discouraged a less zealous and persevering man than our  predecessor. The moralist looked on doubtfully--the whole community  esteemed the enterprise desperate. Mountains of prejudice, overtopping  the Alps, were to be beaten down to a level--strong interest, connected  by a thousand links, severed--new habits formed; Every house, and almost  every individual, in a greater or less degree, reclaimed. Derision and  contumely were busy in crushing this sublime project in its  birth--coldness and apathy encompassed it on every side--but our  predecessor, nevertheless, went boldly forward with a giant's strength  and more than a giant's heart--conscious of difficulties and perils,  though not disheartened, armed with the weapons of truth--full of  meekness, yet certain of a splendid victory--and relying on the promises  of God for the issue.\" What an inestimable object-lesson to Garrison was  the example of this good man going forth singlehanded to do battle with  one of the greatest evils of the age! It was not numerical strength, but  the faith of one earnest soul that is able in the world of ideas and  human passions to remove mountains out of the way of the onward march of  mankind. This truth, we may be sure, sunk many fathoms deep into the  mind of the young moralist. And no wonder. For the results of two years  agitation and seed sowing were of the most astonishing character. \"The  change which has taken place in public sentiment,\" he continues, \"is  indeed remarkable ... incorporated as intemperance _was_, and still  _is_, into our very existence as a people.... A regenerating spirit is  everywhere seen; a strong impulse to action has been given, which,  beginning in the breasts of a few individuals, and then affecting  villages, and cities, and finally whole States, has rolled onward  triumphantly through the remotest sections of the republic. As union and  example are the levers adopted to remove this gigantic vice, temperance  societies have been rapidly multiplied, many on the principle of entire  abstinence, and others making it a duty to abstain from encouraging the  distillation and consumption of spirituous liquors. Expressions of the  deep abhorrence and sympathy which are felt in regard to the awful  prevalence of drunkenness are constantly emanating from legislative  bodies down to various religious conventions, medical associations,  grand juries, etc., etc. But nothing has more clearly evinced the  strength of this excitement than the general interest taken in this  subject by the conductors of the press. From Maine to the Mississippi,  and as far as printing has penetrated--even among the Cherokee  Indians--but one sentiment seems to pervade the public papers, viz., the  necessity of strenuous exertion for the suppression of intemperance.\"  Such a demonstration of the tremendous power of a single righteous soul  for good, we may be sure, exerted upon Garrison lasting influences. What  a revelation it was also of the transcendent part which the press was  capable of playing in the revolution of popular sentiment upon moral  questions; and of the supreme service of organization as a factor in  reformatory movements. The seeds sowed were faith in the convictions of  one man against the opinions, the prejudices, and the practices of the  multitude; and knowledge of and skill in the use of the instruments by  which the individual conscience may be made to correct and renovate the  moral sense of a nation. But there was another seed corn dropped at this  time in his mind, and that is the immense utility of woman in the work  of regenerating society. She it is who feels even more than man the  effects of social vices and sins, and to her the moral reformer should  strenuously appeal for aid. And this, with the instinct of genius,  Garrison did in the temperance reform, nearly seventy years ago. His  editorials in the _Philanthropist_ in the year 1828 on \"Female  Influence\" may be said to be the _courier avant_ of the Woman's  Christian Temperance Union of to-day, as they were certainly the  precursors of the female anti-slavery societies of a few years later.    But now, without his knowing it, a stranger from a distant city entered  Boston with a message, which was to change the whole purpose of the  young editor's life. It was Benjamin Lundy, the indefatigable friend of  the Southern slave, the man who carried within his breast the whole  menagerie of Southern slavery. He was fresh from the city which held the  dust of Fanny Garrison, who had once written to her boy in Newburyport,  how the good God had cared for her in the person of a colored woman.  Yes, she had written: \"The ladies are all kind to me, and I have a  colored woman that waits on me, that is so kind no one can tell how kind  she is; and although a slave to man, yet a free-born soul, by the grace  of God. Her name is Henny, and should I never see you again, and you  should come where she is, remember her, for your poor mother's sake.\"  And now, without his dreaming of it, this devoted Samaritan in black,  who, perhaps, had long ago joined her dear friend in the grave, was  coming to that very boy, now grown to manhood, to claim for her race  what the mother had asked for her, the kind slave-woman. Not one of all  those little ones of the nation but who had a home in the many-mansioned  heart of Lundy. He had been an eye and ear "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14558"],[0,"Darwinism (1889) (#6)"],[1,"of variation. These chapters will be followed by a  discussion of certain difficulties, and of the vexed question of  hybridity. Then will come a rather full account of the more important of  the complex relations of organisms to each other and to the earth  itself, which are either fully explained or greatly elucidated by the  theory. The concluding chapter will treat of the origin of man and his  relations to the lower animals.

There is perhaps no phenomenon of nature that is at once so important,  so universal; and so little understood, as the struggle for existence  continually going on among all organised beings. To most persons nature  appears calm, orderly, and peaceful. They see the birds singing in the  trees, the insects hovering over the flowers, the squirrel climbing  among the tree-tops, and all living things in the possession of health  and vigour, and in the enjoyment of a sunny existence. But they do not  see, and hardly ever think of, the means by which this beauty and  harmony and enjoyment is brought about. They do not see the constant and  daily search after food, the failure to obtain which means weakness or  death; the constant effort to escape enemies; the ever-recurring  struggle against the forces of nature. This daily and hourly struggle,  this incessant warfare, is nevertheless the very means by which much of  the beauty and harmony and enjoyment in nature is produced, and also  affords one of the most important elements in bringing about the origin  of species. We must, therefore, devote some time to the consideration of  its various aspects and of the many curious phenomena to which it gives  rise.    It is a matter of common observation that if weeds are allowed to grow  unchecked in a garden they will soon destroy a number of the flowers.  It is not so commonly known that if a garden is left to become  altogether wild, the weeds that first take possession of it, often  covering the whole surface of the ground with two or three different  kinds, will themselves be supplanted by others, so that in a few years  many of the original flowers and of the earliest weeds may alike have  disappeared. This is one of the very simplest cases of the struggle for  existence, resulting in the successive displacement of one set of  species by another; but the exact causes of this displacement are by no  means of such a simple nature. All the plants concerned may be perfectly  hardy, all may grow freely from seed, yet when left alone for a number  of years, each set is in turn driven out by a succeeding set, till at  the end of a considerable period--a century or a few centuries  perhaps--hardly one of the plants which first monopolised the ground  would be found there.    Another phenomenon of an analogous kind is presented by the different  behaviour of introduced wild plants or animals into countries apparently  quite as well suited to them as those which they naturally inhabit.  Agassiz, in his work on Lake Superior, states that the roadside weeds of  the northeastern United States, to the number of 130 species, are all  European, the native weeds having disappeared westwards; and in New  Zealand there are no less than 250 species of naturalised European  plants, more than 100 species of which have spread widely over the  country, often displacing the native vegetation. On the other hand, of  the many hundreds of hardy plants which produce seed freely in our  gardens, very few ever run wild, and hardly any have become common. Even  attempts to naturalise suitable plants usually fail; for A. de Candolle  states that several botanists of Paris, Geneva, and especially of  Montpellier, have sown the seeds of many hundreds of species of hardy  exotic plants in what appeared to be the most favourable situations, but  that, in hardly a single case, has any one of them become  naturalised.[4] Even a plant like the potato--so widely cultivated, so  hardy, and so well adapted to spread by means of its many-eyed  tubers--has not established itself in a wild state in any part of  Europe. It would be thought that Australian plants would easily run  wild in New Zealand. But Sir Joseph Hooker informs us that the late Mr.  Bidwell habitually scattered Australian seeds during his extensive  travels in New Zealand, yet only two or three Australian plants appear  to have established themselves in that country, and these only in  cultivated or newly moved soil.    These few illustrations sufficiently show that all the plants of a  country are, as De Candolle says, at war with each other, each one  struggling to occupy ground at the expense of its neighbour. But,  besides this direct competition, there is one not less powerful arising  from the exposure of almost all plants to destruction by animals. The  buds are destroyed by birds, the leaves by caterpillars, the seeds by  weevils; some insects bore into the trunk, others burrow in the twigs  and leaves; slugs devour the young seedlings and the tender shoots,  wire-worms gnaw the roots. Herbivorous mammals devour many species  bodily, while some uproot and devour the buried tubers.    In animals, it is the eggs or the very young that suffer most from their  various enemies; in plants, the tender seedlings when they first appear  above the ground. To illustrate this latter point Mr. Darwin cleared and  dug a piece of ground three feet long and two feet wide, and then marked  all the seedlings of weeds and other plants which came up, noting what  became of them. The total number was 357, and out of these no less than  295 were destroyed by slugs and insects. The direct strife of plant with  plant is almost equally fatal when the stronger are allowed to smother  the weaker. When turf is mown or closely browsed by animals, a number of  strong and weak plants live together, because none are allowed to grow  much beyond the rest; but Mr. Darwin found that when the plants which  compose such turf are allowed to grow up freely, the stronger kill the  weaker. In a plot of turf three feet by four, twenty distinct species of  plants were found to be growing, and no less than nine of these perished  altogether when the other species were allowed to grow up to their full  size.[5]    But besides having to protect themselves against competing plants and  against destructive animals, there is a yet deadlier enemy in the  forces of inorganic nature. Each species can sustain a certain amount of  heat and cold, each requires a certain amount of moisture at the right  season, each wants a proper amount of light or of direct sunshine, each  needs certain elements in the soil; the failure of a due proportion in  these inorganic conditions causes weakness, and thus leads to speedy  death. The struggle for existence in plants is, therefore, threefold in  character and infinite in complexity, and the result is seen in their  curiously irregular distribution over the face of the earth. Not only  has each country its distinct plants, but every valley, every hillside,  almost every hedgerow, has a different set of plants from its adjacent  valley, hillside, or hedgerow--if not always different in the actual  species yet very different in comparative abundance, some which are rare  in the one being common in the other. Hence it happens that slight  changes of conditions often produce great changes in the flora of a  country. Thus in 1740 and the two following years the larva of a moth  (Phalaena graminis) committed such destruction in many of the meadows of  Sweden that the grass was greatly diminished in quantity, and many  plants which were before choked by the grass sprang up, and the ground  became variegated with a multitude of different species of flowers. The  introduction of goats into the island of St. Helena led to the entire  destruction of the native forests, consisting of about a hundred  distinct species of trees and shrubs, the young plants being devoured by  the goats as fast as they grew up. The camel is a still greater enemy to  woody vegetation than the goat, and Mr. Marsh believes that forests  would soon cover considerable tracts of the Arabian and African deserts  if the goat and the camel were removed from them.[6] Even in many parts  of our own country the existence of trees is dependent on the absence of  cattle. Mr. Darwin observed, on some extensive heaths near Farnham, in  Surrey, a few clumps of old Scotch firs, but no young trees over  hundreds of acres. Some portions of the heath had, however, been  enclosed a few years before, and these enclosures were crowded with  young fir-trees growing too close together for all to live; and these  were not sown or planted, nothing having been done to the ground beyond  enclosing it so as to keep out cattle. On ascertaining this, Mr. Darwin  was so much surprised that he searched among the heather in the  unenclosed parts, and there he found multitudes of little trees and  seedlings which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. In one  square yard, at a point about a hundred yards from one of the old clumps  of firs, he counted thirty-two little trees, and one of them had  twenty-six rings of growth,"]]]
