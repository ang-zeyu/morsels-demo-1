[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Plan of second fortress at Abydos, Eleventh or  Twelfth Dynasty.]    [Illustration: Fig. 27.--Walls of second fort at Abydos, restored.]    [Illustration: Fig. 28.--Facade of fort, from wall-scene, Beni Hasan,  Twelfth Dynasty.]    [Illustration: Fig. 29.--Plan of main gate, second fortress of Abydos.]    [Illustration: Fig. 30.--Plan of south-east gate, second fortress of  Abydos.]    [Illustration: Fig. 31.--Plan of gate, fortress of Kom el Ahmar.]    The early Egyptians possessed no engines calculated to make an impression  on very massive walls. They knew of but three ways of forcing a stronghold;  namely, scaling the walls, sapping them, or bursting open the gates. The  plan adopted by their engineers in building the second fort is admirably  well calculated to resist each of these modes of attack (fig. 26). The  outer walls are long and straight, without towers or projections of any  kind; they measure 430 feet in length from north to south, by 255 feet in  width. The foundations rest on the sand, and do not go down more than a  foot. The wall (fig. 27) is of crude brick, in horizontal courses. It has a  slight batter; is solid, without slits or loopholes; and is decorated  outside with long vertical grooves or panels, like those depicted on the  stelae of the ancient empire. In its present state, it rises to a height of  some thirty-six feet above the plain; when perfect, it would scarcely have  exceeded forty feet, which height would amply suffice to protect the  garrison from all danger of scaling by portable ladders. The thickness of  the wall is about twenty feet at the base, and sixteen feet above. The top  is destroyed, but the bas-reliefs and mural paintings (fig. 28) show that  it must have been crowned with a continuous cornice, boldly projecting,  furnished with a slight low parapet, and surmounted by battlements, which  were generally rounded, but sometimes, though rarely, squared. The walk  round the top of the ramparts, though diminished by the parapet, was still  twelve or fifteen feet wide. It ran uninterruptedly along the four sides,  and was reached by narrow staircases formed in the thickness of the walls,  but now destroyed. There was no ditch, but in order to protect the base of  the main wall from sappers, they erected, about ten feet in advance of it,  a battlemented covering wall, some sixteen feet in height. These  precautions sufficed against sap and scaling; but the gates remained as  open gaps in the circuit. It was upon these weak points that besiegers and  besieged alike concentrated their efforts. The fortress of Abydos had two  gates, the main one being situate at the east end of the north front (fig.  29). A narrow cutting (A), closed by a massive wooden door, marked the  place in the covering wall. Behind it was a small _place d'armes_ (B), cut  partly in the thickness of the wall, and leading to a second gate (C) as  narrow as the first. When, notwithstanding the showers of missiles poured  upon them from the top of the walls, not only in front, but also from both  sides, the attacking party had succeeded in carrying this second door, they  were not yet in the heart of the place. They would still have to traverse  an oblong court (D), closely hemmed in between the outer walls and the  cross walls, which last stood at right angles to the first. Finally, they  must force a last postern (E), which was purposely placed in the most  awkward corner. The leading principle in the construction of fortress-gates  was always the same, but the details varied according to the taste of the  engineer. At the south-east gate of the fort of Abydos (fig. 30) the _place  d'armes_ between the two walls is abolished, and the court is constructed  entirely in the thickness of the main wall; while at Kom el Ahmar, opposite  El Kab (fig. 31), the block of brickwork in the midst of which the gate is  cut projects boldly in front. The posterns opening at various points  facilitated the movements of the garrison, and enabled them to multiply  their sorties.    [Illustration: Fig. 32.--Plan of the walled city at El Kab.]    The same system of fortification which was in use for isolated fortresses  was also employed for the protection of towns. At Heliopollis, at San, at  Sais, at Thebes, everywhere in short, we find long straight walls forming  plain squares or parallelograms, without towers or bastions, ditches or  outworks. The thickness of the walls, which varied from thirty to eighty  feet, made such precautions needless. The gates, or at all events the  principal ones, had jambs and lintels of stone, decorated with scenes and  inscriptions; as, for instance, that of Ombos, which Champollion beheld yet  _in situ_, and which dated from the reign of Thothmes III. The oldest and  best preserved walled city in Egypt, namely, El Kab, belongs probably to  the ancient empire (fig. 32). The Nile washed part of it away some years  ago; but at the beginning of the present century it formed an irregular  quadrilateral enclosure, measuring some 2,100 feet in length, by about a  quarter less in breadth. The south front is constructed on the same  principles as the wall at Kom es Sultan, the bricks being bedded in  alternate horizontal and concave sections. Along the north and west fronts  they are laid in undulating layers from end to end. The thickness is  thirty-eight feet, and the average height thirty feet; and spacious ramps  lead up to the walk upon the walls. The gates are placed irregularly, one  in each side to north, east, and west, but none in the south face; they  are, however, in too ruinous a state to admit of any plan being taken of  them. The enclosure contained a considerable population, whose dwellings  were unequally distributed, the greater part being concentrated towards the  north and west, where excavations have disclosed the remains of a large  number of houses. The temples were grouped together in a square enclosure,  concentric with the outer wall; and this second enclosure served for a  keep, where the garrison could hold out long after the rest of the town had  fallen into the hands of the enemy.    [Illustration: Fig. 33.--Plan of walled city at Kom Ombo.]    [Illustration: Fig. 34.--Plan of fortress of Kummeh.]    [Illustration: Fig. 35.--Plan of fortress of Semneh.]    [Illustration: Fig. 36.--Section of the platform at A B, of the preceding  plan.]    The rectangular plan, though excellent in a plain, was not always  available in a hilly country. When the spot to be fortified was situate  upon a height, the Egyptian engineers knew perfectly well how to adapt  their lines of defence to the nature of the site. At Kom Ombo (fig. 33) the  walls exactly followed the outline of the isolated mound on which the town  was perched, and presented towards the east a front bristling with  irregular projections, the style of which roughly resembles our modern  bastions. At Kummeh and Semneh, in Nubia, where the Nile rushes over the  rocks of the second cataract, the engineering arrangements are very  ingenious, and display much real skill. Usertesen III. had fixed on this  pass as the frontier of Egypt, and the fortresses which he there  constructed were intended to bar the water-way against the vessels of the  neighbouring negro tribes. At Kummeh, on the right bank, the position was  naturally strong (fig. 34). Upon a rocky height surrounded by precipices  was planned an irregular square measuring about 200 feet each way. Two  elongated bastions, one on the north-east and the other on the south-east,  guarded respectively the path leading to the gate, and the course of the  river. The covering wall stood thirteen feet high, and closely followed the  line of the main wall, except at the north and south corners, where it  formed two bastion-like projections. At Semneh, on the opposite bank, the  site was less favourable. The east side was protected by a belt of cliffs  going sheer down to the water's edge; but the three other sides were well-  nigh open (fig. 35). A straight wall, about fifty feet in height, carried  along the cliffs on the side next the river; but the walls looking towards  the plain rose to eighty feet, and bristled with bastion-like projections  (A.B.) jutting out for a distance of fifty feet from the curtain wall,  measuring thirty feet thick at the base and thirteen feet at the top, and  irregularly spaced, according to the requirements of the defence. These  spurs, which are not battlemented, served in place of towers. They added to  the strength of the walls, protected the walk round the top, and enabled  the besieged to direct a flank attack against the enemy if any attempt were  made upon the wall of circuit. The intervals between these spurs are  accurately calculated as to distance, in order that the archers should be  able to sweep the intervening ground with their arrows. Curtains and  salients are alike built of crude brick, with beams bedded horizontally in  the mass. The outer face is in two parts, the lower division being nearly  vertical, and the upper one inclined at an angle of about seventy degrees,  which made scaling very difficult, if not impossible. The whole of the  ground enclosed by the wall of circuit was filled in to nearly the level of  the ramparts (fig. 36). Externally, the covering wall of stone was  separated from the body of the fortress by a dry ditch, some 100 to 130  feet in width. This wall closely followed the main outline, and rose to a  height which varied according to the situation from six to ten feet above  the level of the plain. On the northward side it was cut by the winding  road, which led down into the plain. These arrangements, skilful as they  were, did not prevent the fall of the place.
