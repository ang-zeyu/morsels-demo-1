The  circumstances, distorted by gross anachronisms, have been weaved into the  delightful romance of \"Kenilworth.\"    Of the goose and posts, _we_ can suggest no better explanation than that  the goose was intended for poor Amy, and the cross posts for the Protector  Somerset, and his rival Dudley Duke of Northumberland, both of whom were  bred to the devil's trade, ambition. Others may be possessed of more  successful elucidation. At all events, it is plain that the people had a  very suspicious opinion of Leicester, amounting to this, that he was a  great rascal, who played a deep game, and stuck at nothing which he could  do without danger to himself.[3]--_Gentleman's Magazine_.

It appears that, on an average of the fifteen years previous to the  revolution, about twenty-two millions of dollars were exported, and that  there was an accumulation of about two millions. Since the revolution,  the exports have averaged 13,587,052 dollars, while the produce has  decreased to eleven millions. This change was the natural consequence of  the revolution. The favourable accounts of Humboldt excited a spirit of  speculation that was wholly regardless of passing events; and the Act of  Congress, facilitating the co-operation of foreigners with the natives,  produced a mania which has been destructive to numberless individuals,  who trusted too much to names. Seven English companies, with a capital  of at least three millions, were established, and these were followed by  two American, and one German, companies. Such was the rage for mining on  the Royal Exchange, that for a time it was only necessary for any one  to appear with contracts made with Mexican mine owners to establish a  company. Many who were so ignorant as not even to know the difference  between a shaft and a level, commenced speculators, not for the purpose  of fairly earning a reward for doing some service to those to whom they  offered their mines, but to fill their own purses without reference to  consequences. Such a system of unprincipled conduct could not last;  almost all the minor performers have been driven from the stage, and the  respectable associations alone maintain their footing, though the want  of returns for the immense sums invested has tended to produce a general  want of confidence.    Since these enterprises have been undertaken, an immense and fruitless  expenditure has been incurred by sending out machinery, which could be  of no earthly use--by despising the native processes, and substituting  others that have been found wholly inapplicable--and by introducing  British labourers, who when abroad reverse all the good qualities for  which they are valuable at home. A reform in this system we believe to  have been generally adopted, and we are sure that a reduction of  expense, a management purely European, and native labour, with only such  modifications in working, smelting, or amalgamating, as experience will  prove to be advantageous, will, in a moderate time, return the capital  already expended, with a commensurate advantage. But these things can  only take place provided the public tranquillity be maintained, and the  government keep their engagements with foreigners inviolate. The  insecurity arising from the domestic feuds now disturbing this fine  country, must, if it continues, finally annihilate its best  resources.--_Foreign Quarterly Review._           *       *       *       *       *      Of the abhorrence with which the Dutch regard the French tongue, the  following lines of Bilderdyk are an amusing example:--      Begone, thou bastard-tongue! so base--so broken--    By human jackals and hyaenas spoken;    Formed for a race of infidels, and fit    To laugh at truth--and scepticize in wit;    What stammering, snivelling sounds, which scarcely dare,    Bravely through nasal channels meet the ear--    Yet helped by apes' grimaces--and the devil,    Have ruled the world, and ruled the world for evil!    _Ibid._           *       *       *       *       *      COALS.      One of the pamphlets of the age of the Commonwealth is said, in the  title-page, to be              Printed in the year    That sea-coal was exceeding dear.      The remembrance of this inconvenience, which the Londoners had suffered  during the stoppage of their supply from Newcastle, made \"the committees  of both kingdoms conclude and agree among themselves, that some of the  most notorious delinquents and malignants, late coal-owners in the town  of Newcastle, be wholly excluded from intermeddling with any shares or  parts of colleries;\" \"but as the parliament might find a difficulty in  _driving on the trade_, they did not conceive it for their service to  put out all the said malignants at once, but were rather constrained,  for the present, to make use of those delinquents in working their own  collieries as tenants and servants.\" The more stubborn and _wealthy_,  therefore, were selected for example; and the others had this favour  shown them.           *       *       *       *       *      LADY-POETS OF ENGLAND.      The following is a Frenchman's expression of homage to our modern female  poets, in which we excel all the world:--    It is remarkable, that in the latter years of the eighteenth century, and  also during the whole course of our revolution, there appeared in England  a whole school, as it were, of female authors, whose pure and graceful  productions are disfigured by no exaggerations, nor are they of that  sombre character which distinguishes the modern literature of their  country. Of the lady-authors of England, the most celebrated is Lady  Wortley Montagu, the contemporary of Pope, who has left poems, but more  especially letters, highly remarkable for their talent and philosophy. It  is impossible to give here the names of the authoresses who appeared all  on a sudden about half a century after Lady Wortley Montagu. One of the  earliest of them was a lady of the same name, Mrs. E. Montagu, the author  of the Essays on Shakspeare, and Mrs. Anna Laetitia Barbauld, who wrote  numerous poems and admirable hymns for children. There is great beauty in  the Epistle of Mrs. Barbauld to Wilberforce, on the subject of the  Abolition of the Slave Trade (1781.) Mrs. Hannah More has also written  several works of _religious fiction_, and above all, some charming poems;  Florio (1786,) and the Blue Stocking, or Conversation. The Blue Stocking  is a burlesque name given to a lady's coterie, in which several females  attempted to start a sort of _bureau d'esprit_ under the direction of  Mesdames Robinson and Piozzi, a coterie innocent enough, but which excited  the wrath of Mr. Gifford, the Editor of the _Quarterly Review_, who  fulminated against it several satires in excessively bad taste, and  written in a tone of disgusting pedantry. The verses of Mr. Gifford are  infinitely more ridiculous than those he pretends to correct. Amongst the  English ladies who have written romance, Miss Edgeworth, Mrs. Inchbald,  and Lady Morgan, are worthy of especial note. Several ladies, without  having written works of great importance, have still produced poetical  pieces of graceful beauty; in this number it is but justice to distinguish  Mrs. Opie. And lastly, in order to finish this hasty catalogue, we may  remark that there have appeared in England, in our days, several ladies of  a high order of literary, poetical, and at the same time, philosophical  talent. Lady Morgan herself has contrived to mix up history and romance  in her writings, with great ability; but among the ladies, who inscribed  their fame on monuments more durable than romantic stories, we must select  for honourable mention the names of Joanna Baillie, Aikin, Benger, and  Helen Maria Williams. Miss Baillie, sister of the celebrated Dr. Baillie,  the physician, is a woman of the highest talent. It is not your pretty  nothings, your elegant trifles, which occupy her genius; on the contrary,  she has attempted in a series of dramatic pieces, to paint the most  energetic passion of the human heart; and her pieces, written in the most  elevated and _Shakspearian_ tone, will always be regarded as the work of a  superior mind. John Kemble, in the part of _Montfort_, reached the sublime  of agony. In the writings of Miss Baillie there is a combination of the  solemn and the poetical, which is rarely observed in women. Miss Aikin has  written some charming poems, far more beautiful than any I have met with  in the writings of Miss Landon and Miss Mitford. The _Mouse's Petition_,  by Miss Aikin, is a _chef-d'oeuvre_. Miss Benger has published some  historical works of great interest, which place her in the same line with  Miss Aikin. Lastly, there is Helen Maria Williams, whose muse, half  English, half French, has published poems, sonnets, and other pieces of  verse, besides several political and historical works. This superior woman,  at the same time that she gave birth, under the influence of sensibility  and fancy, to works of inspiration, portrayed the details of the events of  the French revolution, in the centre of which she threw herself, in 1792,  from pure enthusiasm for liberty.--_Foreign Quarterly Review._           *       *       *       *       *      AMERICAN LAW.      \"No commentator,\" says Judge Hall, in his Letters from the West, \"has  taken any notice of _Linch's Law_, which was once the _lex loci_ of  the frontiers.

The common danger unites all in a common  effort, and the man who shirks this duty to the community is deservedly  spurned. This union contains a liberating power which produces happy and  permanent results in the national life. We need only recall the uniting  power of the War of Liberation or the Franco-German War and their  historical consequences. The brutal incidents inseparable from every war  vanish completely before the idealism of the main result. All the sham  reputations which a long spell of peace undoubtedly fosters are  unmasked. Great personalities take their proper place; strength, truth,  and honour come to the front and are put into play. \"A thousand touching  traits testify to the sacred power of the love which a righteous war  awakes in noble nations.\" [G]    [Footnote G: Treitschke, \"Deutsche Geschichte,\" i., p. 482.]    Frederick the Great recognized the ennobling effect of war. \"War,\" he  said, \"opens the most fruitful field to all virtues, for at every moment  constancy, pity, magnanimity, heroism, and mercy, shine forth in it;  every moment offers an opportunity to exercise one of these virtues.\"    \"At the moment when the State cries out that its very life is at stake,  social selfishness must cease and party hatred be hushed. The individual  must forget his egoism, and feel that he is a member of the whole body.  He should recognize how his own life is nothing worth in comparison with  the welfare of the community. War is elevating, because the individual  disappears before the great conception of the State. The devotion of the  members of a community to each other is nowhere so splendidly  conspicuous as in war.... What a perversion of morality to wish to  abolish heroism among men!\" [H]    [Footnote H: Treitschke, \"Politik\" i., p. 74.]    Even defeat may bear a rich harvest. It often, indeed, passes an  irrevocable sentence on weakness and misery, but often, too, it leads to  a healthy revival, and lays the foundation of a new and vigorous  constitution. \"I recognize in the effect of war upon national  character,\" said Wilhelm von Humboldt, \"one of the most salutary  elements in the moulding of the human race.\"    The individual can perform no nobler moral action than to pledge his  life on his convictions, and to devote his own existence to the cause  which he serves, or even to the conception of the value of ideals to  personal morality. Similarly, nations and States can achieve no loftier  consummation than to stake their whole power on upholding their  independence, their honour, and their reputation.    Such sentiments, however, can only be put into practice in war. The  possibility of war is required to give the national character that  stimulus from which these sentiments spring, and thus only are nations  enabled to do justice to the highest duties of civilization by the  fullest development of their moral forces. An intellectual and vigorous  nation can experience no worse destiny than to be lulled into a Phaecian  existence by the undisputed enjoyment of peace.    From this point of view, efforts to secure peace are extraordinarily  detrimental to the national health so soon as they influence politics.  The States which from various considerations are always active in this  direction are sapping the roots of their own strength. The United States  of America, e.g., in June, 1911, championed the ideas of universal  peace in order to be able to devote their undisturbed attention to  money-making and the enjoyment of wealth, and to save the three hundred  million dollars which they spend on their army and navy; they thus incur  a great danger, not so much from the possibility of a war with England  or Japan, but precisely because they try to exclude all chance of  contest with opponents of their own strength, and thus avoid the stress  of great political emotions, without which the moral development of the  national character is impossible. If they advance farther on this road,  they will one day pay dearly for such a policy.    Again, from the Christian standpoint we arrive at the same conclusion.  Christian morality is based, indeed, on the law of love. \"Love God above  all things, and thy neighbour as thyself.\" This law can claim no  significance for the relations of one country to another, since its  application to politics would lead to a conflict of duties. The love  which a man showed to another country as such would imply a want of love  for his own countrymen. Such a system of politics must inevitably lead  men astray. Christian morality is personal and social, and in its nature  cannot be political. Its object is to promote morality of the  individual, in order to strengthen him to work unselfishly in the  interests of the community. It tells us to love our individual enemies,  but does not remove the conception of enmity. Christ Himself said: \"I am  not come to send peace on earth, but a sword.\" His teaching can never be  adduced as an argument against the universal law of struggle. There  never was a religion which was more combative than Christianity. Combat,  moral combat, is its very essence. If we transfer the ideas of  Christianity to the sphere of politics, we can claim to raise the power  of the State--power in the widest sense, not merely from the material  aspect--to the highest degree, with the object of the moral advancement  of humanity, and under certain conditions the sacrifice may be made  which a war demands. Thus, according to Christianity, we cannot  disapprove of war in itself, but must admit that it is justified morally  and historically.    Again, we should not be entitled to assume that from the opposite, the  purely materialistic, standpoint war is entirely precluded. The  individual who holds such views will certainly regard it with disfavour,  since it may cost him life and prosperity. The State, however, as such  can also come from the materialistic standpoint to a decision to wage  war, if it believes that by a certain sacrifice of human lives and  happiness the conditions of life of the community may be improved.    The loss is restricted to comparatively few, and, since the fundamental  notion of all materialistic philosophy inevitably leads to selfishness,  the majority of the citizens have no reason for not sacrificing the  minority in their own interests. Thus, those who from the materialistic  standpoint deny the necessity of war will admit its expediency from  motives of self-interest.    Reflection thus shows not only that war is an unqualified necessity, but  that it is justifiable from every point of view. The practical methods  which the adherents of the peace idea have proposed for the prevention  of war are shown to be absolutely ineffective.    It is sometimes assumed that every war represents an infringement of  rights, and that not only the highest expression of civilization, but  also the true welfare of every nation, is involved in the fullest  assertion of these rights, and proposals are made from time to time on  this basis to settle the disputes which arise between the various  countries by Arbitration Courts, and so to render war impossible. The  politician who, without side-interests in these proposals, honestly  believes in their practicability must be amazingly short-sighted.    Two questions in this connection are at once suggested: On what right is  the finding of this Arbitration Court based? and what sanctions insure  that the parties will accept this finding?    To the first question the answer is that such a right does not, and  cannot, exist. The conception of right is twofold. It signifies,  firstly, the consciousness of right, the living feeling of what is right  and good; secondly, the right laid down by society and the State, either  written or sanctioned by tradition. In its first meaning it is an  indefinite, purely personal conception; in its second meaning it is  variable and capable of development. The right determined by law is only  an attempt to secure a right in itself. In this sense right is the  system of social aims secured by compulsion. It is therefore impossible  that a written law should meet all the special points of a particular  case. The application of the legal right must always be qualified in  order to correspond more or less to the idea of justice. A certain  freedom in deciding on the particular case must be conceded to the  administration of justice. The established law, within a given and  restricted circle of ideas, is only occasionally absolutely just.    The conception of this right is still more obscured by the complex  nature of the consciousness of right and wrong. A quite different  consciousness of right and wrong develops in individuals, whether  persons or peoples, and this consciousness finds its expression in most  varied forms, and lives in the heart of the people by the side of, and  frequently in opposition to, the established law. In Christian countries  murder is a grave crime; amongst a people where blood-vengeance is a  sacred duty it can be regarded as a moral act, and its neglect as a  crime. It is impossible to reconcile such different conceptions of  right.    There is yet another cause of uncertainty. The moral consciousness of  the same people alters with the changing ideas of different epochs and  schools of philosophy. The established law can seldom keep pace with  this inner development, this growth of moral consciousness; it lags  behind. A condition of things arises where the living moral  consciousness of the people conflicts with the established law, where  legal forms are superannuated, but still exist, and Mephistopheles'  scoffing words are true:      \"Laws are transmitted, as one sees,    Just like inherited disease.    They're handed down from race to race,    And noiseless glide from place to place.    Reason they turn to nonsense; worse,    They make beneficence"]]]
