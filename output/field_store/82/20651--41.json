Flavor with vanilla, and stir over the fire until melted  so much that it will pour from the spoon. Take the saucepan to the table  and dip one-half the cones in, one at a time, just as the Chocolate  Creams, No. 1, were dipped in the melted chocolate. If liked, a second  coating may be given the cones. Now put the remainder of the creamed  sugar on to melt, and add two tablespoonfuls of hot water to it. Stir  the remainder of the melted chocolate into this, and if too thick to dip  the candy in, add hot water, a few drops at a time, until the mixture is  of the right consistency; then dip the rest of the cones in this.      GENESEE BON-BONS    Make the cream chocolate caramels, and get them quite firm by placing  the pan on ice. Make the chocolate coating as directed for chocolate  cones. Dip the caramels in this and put on a buttered dish.      CHOCOLATE SYRUP    Into a granite-ware saucepan put one ounce--three tablespoonfuls--of  Walter Baker & Co.'s Soluble Chocolate, and gradually pour on it half a  pint of boiling water, stirring all the time. Place on the fire, and  stir until all the chocolate is dissolved. Now add one pint of  granulated sugar, and stir until it begins to boil. Cook for three  minutes longer, then strain and cool. When cool, add one tablespoonful  of vanilla extract. Bottle, and keep in a cold place.      REFRESHING DRINKS FOR SUMMER    Put into a tumbler about two tablespoonfuls of broken ice, two  tablespoonfuls of chocolate syrup, three tablespoonfuls of whipped  cream, one gill of milk, and half a gill of soda-water from a syphon  bottle, or Apollinaris water. Stir well before drinking. A tablespoonful  of vanilla ice-cream is a desirable addition. It is a delicious drink,  even if the soda or Apollinaris water and ice-cream be omitted. A  plainer drink is made by combining the syrup, a gill and a half of milk,  and the ice, shaking well.      A FEW SUGGESTIONS IN REGARD TO CHOCOLATE    The best flavor to add to chocolate is vanilla; next to that, cinnamon.  Beyond these two things one should use great caution, as it is very easy  to spoil the fine natural flavor of the bean. Chocolate absorbs odors  readily; therefore it should be kept in a pure, sweet atmosphere. As  about eleven per cent. of the chocolate bean is starch, chocolate and  cocoa are of a much finer flavor if boiled for a few minutes. Long  boiling, however, ruins their flavor and texture.          Recipes Specially Prepared _by_ Miss Elizabeth Kevill Burr    (All measurements should be level.)      FORMULA FOR MAKING THREE GALLONS OF BREAKFAST COCOA        1/2 a pound of Walter Baker & Co.'s Cocoa,      1-1/2 gallons of water, hot,      1-1/2 gallons of milk, hot.    This should not be allowed to boil. Either make it in a large  double-boiler, or a large saucepan or kettle over water. Mix the cocoa  with enough cold water to make a paste, and be sure it is free from  lumps. Heat together the milk and water, and pour in the cocoa; then  cook at least an hour, stirring occasionally.      CRACKED COCOA    To one-third a cup of Baker's Cracked Cocoa (sometimes called \"Cocoa  Nibs\") use three cups of cold water; cook slowly at least one hour--the  longer the better. Then strain the liquid and add one cup (or more if  desired) of milk, and serve very hot. Do not allow the mixture to boil  after milk has been added.      VANILLA CHOCOLATE WITH WHIPPED CREAM        One cake (1/2 a pound) of Walter Baker & Co.'s Vanilla Sweet Chocolate,      4 cups of boiling water,      Pinch of salt,      4 cups of hot milk.    This must be made in a double-boiler. Put the chocolate, boiling water  and salt in upper part of the double-boiler. Stir and beat with a wooden  spoon until the chocolate is dissolved and smooth. Add the milk and when  thoroughly hot, strain, and serve with unsweetened whipped cream. More  cooking will improve it.      CHOCOLATE CREAM PIE    Line a pie plate with rich pie crust, putting on an extra edge of crust  the same as for custard pie. Fill with the chocolate filling made after  the following recipe. Bake in a hot oven until crust is done; remove,  and when cool, cover with a meringue and brown very slowly in moderate  oven.      CHOCOLATE FILLING        1 cup of milk,      Pinch of salt,      1-1/2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,      2 level tablespoonfuls of flour,      2 eggs (yolks),      5 tablespoonfuls of sugar (level),      1 teaspoonful of vanilla.    Put milk, salt and chocolate in upper part of the double-boiler, and  when hot and smooth, stir in the flour, which has been mixed with enough  cold milk to be thin enough to pour into the hot milk. Cook, stirring  constantly, until it thickens; then let it cook eight or ten minutes.  Mix the eggs and sugar together and pour the hot mixture over them,  stirring well; put back in double-boiler and cook, stirring constantly  one minute. Remove, and when cool add one teaspoonful of vanilla.      MERINGUE        2 eggs (whites),      Pinch of salt,      4 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla.    Add salt to eggs and beat in a large shallow dish with fork or egg-whip  until stiff and flaky and dish can be turned upside down. Beat in the  sugar slowly, then the vanilla, and beat until the dish can be turned  upside down.      COCOA STICKS        6 tablespoonfuls of butter,      3/4 cup of sugar (scant),      1 egg,      1 tablespoonful of milk,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla or pinch of cinnamon,      5 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,      1/8 teaspoonful of baking powder,      1-1/4 to 1-1/2 cups of sifted pastry flour.    Cream the butter until soft; add the sugar gradually and beat well; add  the beaten egg, milk and vanilla; mix thoroughly. Sift cocoa, baking  powder, and a pinch of salt with about one-half cup of the flour; stir  this into the mixture first, then use the remainder of the flour, and  more if necessary, to make a firm dough that will not stick to the  fingers. Set on the ice to harden. Sprinkle the board with cocoa and a  very little sugar. Use small pieces of the dough at a time, toss it over  the board to prevent sticking, roll out thin, cut in strips about  one-half inch wide and three inches long. Place closely in pan and bake  in moderately hot oven three or four minutes. Great care should be taken  in the baking to prevent burning.    It is advisable to gather the scraps after each rolling, if soft, and  set away to harden, for fear of getting in too much cocoa, thus making  them bitter.    The colder and harder the dough is, the better it can be handled;  therefore it can be made the day before using.      COCOA FROSTING        4 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,      2 tablespoonfuls of cold water,      3 tablespoonfuls of hot water,      1/2 a teaspoonful of vanilla,      About 1-3/4 cups of confectioners' sugar.    Put the cocoa in a small saucepan; add the cold water and stir until  perfectly smooth; then the hot water, and cook for one or two minutes,  add vanilla and a speck of salt, then stir in enough sugar to make it  stiff enough to spread nicely. Beat until smooth and glossy and free  from lumps.    If too thick, add a little cold water. If not thick enough, add a little  sugar. Never make a frosting so stiff that it will have to be made  smooth with a wet knife. It is better to let it run to the sides of the  cake. For frosting sides of the cake, make a little stiffer.    This frosting never cracks as an egg frosting, but is hard enough to cut  nicely.      COCOA SAUCE        2 tablespoonfuls of butter,      1 cup of boiling water,      2 tablespoonfuls of flour,      4 tablespoonfuls of sugar,      4 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla.    Melt the butter in the saucepan; mix the flour and cocoa together and  stir into the butter; add gradually the hot water, stirring and beating  each time; cook until it thickens. Just before serving, add the sugar,  vanilla and a pinch of salt, if necessary.    Use more cocoa if liked stronger. This sauce will be found excellent for  cottage puddings, Dutch apple cakes, steamed apple puddings, etc.      COCOA CAKE        1/2 a cup of butter,      3/4 a cup of milk,      1 cup of sugar,      6 level tablespoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,      3 eggs,      2 level teaspoonfuls of baking powder,      1 teaspoonful of vanilla,      1-1/2 or 2 cups of sifted pastry flour.    Cream the butter, stir in the sugar gradually, add the unbeaten eggs,  and beat all together until very creamy. Sift together one-half cup of  the flour, the cocoa and baking powder; use this flour first, then  alternate the milk and remaining flour, using enough to make mixture  stiff enough to drop from the spoon; add vanilla and beat until very  smooth; then bake in loaf in moderately hot oven thirty-five or forty  minutes.    Tests for baking cake. It is baked enough when:  1. It shrinks from the pan.  2. Touching it on the top, springs back.  3. No singing sound.      COCOA MERINGUE PUDDING        1 cup of milk,      2 eggs (yolks),      2 tablespoonfuls of flour,      Pinch of salt,      4 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,      3 tablespoonfuls of sugar,      1/2 a teaspoonful of vanilla.    Put the milk in the upper part of the double-boiler, and heat. Mix flour  and cocoa together and soften in a little cold milk; mix until free  from lumps. When the milk is hot, add the flour, and cook, stirring  often, eight or ten minutes. Beat yolks of eggs lightly; add sugar and  salt, and mix well. When mixture in double-boiler has cooked  sufficiently, strain it over the mixture in the bowl. Put back in  double-boiler and allow it to cook one or two minutes (stirring  constantly), just enough to slightly thicken the eggs. Remove from the  stove, and when cool add vanilla and put in the serving-dish. Cover with  a meringue. Place dish on a board, put in the oven with the door open,  and allow it to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1319"],[0,"Increasing Human Efficiency in Business (#6)"],[1,"remarkable increase in efficiency  William R. Jones--``Captain Bill'' Jones as  he was familiarly known--contributed more  than any other operating man. He was a  genius among executives as well as an inventor  <p 48>  <p 49>  of resource and initiative--a natural leader  and handler of men. When he was asked by  the British Iron and Steel Institute in 1881,  to explain the reasons for the amazing development  in the United States, he attributed it to  organization spirit of the workmen and the  rivalry among the various mills.    ``So long as the record made by a mill  stands first,'' he wrote, ``its workmen are  content to labor at a moderate rate. But let  it be known that some other establishment  has beaten that record and there is no content  until the rival's record is eclipsed.''    _It was on this idea of competition for  efficiency--of production as a game and achievement  as a goal--that the wonderful growth of  the steel industry was based_.    On the intensive development of this idea  by Andrew Carnegie, within his expanding  organization, hinged the tremendous progress  and profits of the Carnegie Company. ``The  little boss'' matched furnace against furnace,  mill against mill, superintendent against  superintendent. He scanned his weekly and  <p 50>  monthly reports not merely for records of  output, but for comparative consumption of  ore, fuel, and other supplies, for time and labor  costs in proportion to product.    If a superintendent, foreman, or gang failed  to respond to this urging, failed to get into  the race for the famous broom which crowned  the stack of the champion Carnegie mill or  furnace, the parallel showing of the other mills  became a club to drive the laggards into line.  So intense was the competition, so sharp the  verbal goads applied that Jones, after resigning  in indignation, parodied in sarcastic  notes in this manner the Carnegie fashion of  bringing executives to task: ``Puppy dog  number three, you have been beaten by puppy  dog number two on fuel. Puppy dog number  two, you are higher on labor than puppy  dog number one.''    How effective was this system of pitting  man against man, plant against plant, was  shown by the dominant position of the Carnegie  Company in the trade when the Steel  Corporation was launched and by the stag-  <p 51>  gering value put upon its business. Indirect  testimony of the same fact was given another  time by Jones when he refused thousands of  dollars in yearly royalties for the use of his  inventions by outside companies, this though  the men who sought them were personal friends  and his contract with the Carnegie Company  allowed such licenses. His excuse was eloquent  of the power residing in the Carnegie  contest for efficiency and results: leadership  for his charge, the Edgar Thompson works, in  output and costs, meant more to him than  money and a chance to help his friends.    _The Carnegie system was one of the most  comprehensive applications in business of man's  instinct of competition to the work of increasing  individual and organization efficiency_.    In the handling of executives it was carried  to such extremes as few great managers would  approve to-day. Undeniably, however, the  contest idea was an important influence in the  building up of a vast business in relatively brief  time, while the influence on the pace of the  whole industry gave the United States its  <p 52>  present supremacy in steel and iron. It survives  in the parallel comparisons of records  with which the Steel Corporation measures  the efficiency of its units of production and  keeps its mill superintendents to the mark.  It is utilized, in some degree and in varying  departments, by hundreds of successful houses.    Let us analyze the facts, the habits of  thought, the emotions behind competition and  determine where and how it may be applied  to the task of increasing our own and our  employees' efficiency.    The experienced horseman knows that a  horse is unable to attain his greatest speed  apart from a pacemaker. The horse needs the  stimulus of an equal to get under way quickly,  to strike his fastest gait and to keep it up.  In this particular an athlete in sprinting is like  the horse. He is unable by sheer force of will  to run a hundred yards in ten seconds. To  achieve it he needs a competitor who will push  him to his utmost effort.    _The struggle for existence, one of the main  factors in the evolution of man, has raged most_  <p 53>  _fiercely among equals; without it, development  scarcely would have been possible_.    So fundamental has been this struggle  that the necessity for it has become firmly  established within us. We require it to stimulate  us to attain our highest ends.    As is made evident by a consideration of  imitation we are eminently social creatures.  We imitate the acts of those about us. Imitation  is, however, only the first stage of our  social relationship. We first imitate and then  compete. I purchase an automobile in imitation  of the acts of my friends, but I compete  with them by securing a more powerful or  swifter car. By erecting a new building because  some other banker has done so, the  second individual does more than imitate.  He competes with the first by planning to  erect a more magnificent structure and on a  more commanding site. Or a great retail  store, announcing a ``February sale'' of ``white  goods'' or furniture, invariably tries to surpass  the bargains offered by rival establishments.  <p 54>    We do indeed imitate and compete with all  our associates, but those whom we recognize  as our peers are the ones who stimulate  us more to the instinctive acts of imitation and  competition.    _Our actual equals stimulate us less than those  whom we recognize as the peers of our ideal  selves--of ourselves as we strive and intend to  become. The man on the ladder just above me  stirs me irresistibly_.    The effect of one individual upon others,  then, is not confined to imitation. There is  a constant tendency to vary from and to excel  the model. My devotion to golf is mainly due  to he example of some of my friends. My  ambition is to outplay these same friends.  Imitation and competition, apparently antagonistic,  are in reality the two expressions  for our social relationships. We first imitate  and then attempt to differentiate ourselves  from our companions.    The manufacturer or merchant imitates his  competitor, but tries also to surpass him.  Indeed it is a truism that competition is the  <p 55>  life of trade. In the shop and in the office,  on the road and behind the counter, in all  buying and selling, competition is essential  to the greatest success. Competition, the  desire to excel, is universal and instinctive.  It gives a zest to our work that would otherwise  be lacking. In every sphere of human  activity competition seems essential for securing  the best results.    _We assume ordinarily that competition exists  only between individuals. As a matter of fact,  a slight degree of competition may be aroused  between a man's present efforts and his previous  records_.    While not so tense or so compelling as is  competition between individuals, it has the  advantage of avoiding the creation of jealousies.  In all the more exciting and stimulating  games, rivalry between individuals is a  prominent feature. In golf the game is frequently  played without this factor, the only  competition being with previous records or  with the mythical Bogy.    Such competition adds considerable zest  <p 56>  to the game, and the same principle is applicable  to business. The most compelling rivalry  is between peers; without this, however,  it is possible to pit the possibilities of the  present month against the achievements of  the previous four weeks or the past year or  even against a hypothetical individual ``bogy.''  This bogy may be fixed by the executive, and  the man induced to compete with it. Thus  the dangers of competition may be minimized  and the advantages of the human instinctive  desire for competition be gained.    In the average well-organized business the  carrying out of such a plan would not be difficult.  Studying the previous records of his  men, a manager or foreman could determine  what each individual bogy should be. The  employee should know just what the _*record  is_ that he is competing with, and that his  success or failure would be recorded to his  credit or otherwise. Above all, the bogy  must be fair and within the power of the man  to accomplish.    _Competition need not be confined to individuals._  <p 57>  _Frequently one city finds a stimulus in competing  with another. Nations compete with one another.  In any organization one section may compete  with another_.    In an army there may be competition between  regiments. Within the regiment there  may be the keenest rivalry between the different  companies. We are such social creatures  that we easily identify ourselves with our  block, our street, our town, our social set, our  party, our firm, or our department in the firm.  Like teams in any game or sport, these groups  may be rendered self-conscious and thus made  units for competition.    It is possible to create such units for  competition in business organizations. In some  instances individual employees of one firm  are pitted against those of a competing firm,  the contest proving stimulating to the men in  both. In other instances the competition is  restricted to the house, and similar departments  or sections are the units.    The closer the parallel between the units  and their activities, as in the Carnegie blast  <p 58>  furnaces and steel mills, the more interesting  and effective the competition becomes.    This principle has received widest recognition  and achieved greatest success in the  sales department. Here individuals are on  a footing of approximate equality or may be  given equality by a system of"]]]
