[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12400"],[0,"Bismarck and the Foundation of the German Empire (#6)"],[1," was gradually falling before the inroads of  the dominant bureaucracy. The same year he was appointed to the  position of Inspector of Dykes for Jerichow. The duties of this office  were of considerable importance for Schoenhausen and the neighbouring  estate; as he writes, \"it depends on the managers of this office  whether from time to time we come under water or not.\" He often refers  to the great damages caused by the floods; he had lost many of his  fruit-trees, and many of the finest elms in the park had been destroyed  by the overflowing of the Elbe.    As Bismarck grew in age and experience he associated more with the  neighbouring families. Pomerania was at this time the centre of a  curious religious movement; the leader was Herr von Thadden, who lived  at Triglaff, not many miles from Kniephof. He was associated with Herr  von Semft and three brothers of the family of Below. They were all  profoundly dissatisfied with the rationalistic religion preached by the  clergy at that time, and aimed at greater inwardness and depth of  religious feeling. Herr von Thadden started religious exercises in his  own house, which were attended not only by the peasants from the village  but by many of the country gentry; they desired the strictest  enforcement of Lutheran doctrine, and wished the State directly to  support the Church. This tendency of thought acquired greater importance  when, in 1840, Frederick William IV succeeded to the throne; he was also  a man of deep religious feeling, and under his reign the extreme  Lutheran party became influential at Court. Among the ablest of these  were the three brothers von Gerlach. One of them, Otto, was a  theologian; another, Ludwig, was Over-President of the Saxon province,  and with him Bismarck had much official correspondence; the third,  Leopold, who had adopted a military career, was attached to the person  of the King and was in later years to have more influence upon him than  anyone except perhaps Bunsen. The real intellectual leader of the party  was Stahl, a theologian.    From about the year 1844 Bismarck seems to have become very intimate  with this religious coterie; his friend Moritz v. Blankenburg had  married Thadden's daughter and Bismarck was constantly a visitor at  Triglaff. It was at Blankenburg's wedding that he first met Hans v.  Kleist, who was in later years to be one of his most intimate friends.  He was, we are told, the most delightful and cheerful of companions; in  his tact and refinement he shewed an agreeable contrast to the ordinary  manners of Pomerania. He often rode over to take part in Shakespeare  evenings, and amused them by accounts of his visit to England[3]. He was  present occasionally at the religious meetings at Triglaff, and though  he never quite adopted all the customs of the set the influence on him  of these older men was for the next ten years to govern all his  political action. That he was not altogether at one with them we can  understand, when we are told that at Herr von Thadden's house it would  never have occurred to anyone even to think of smoking. Bismarck was  then, as in later life, a constant smoker.    The men who met in these family parties in distant Pomerania were in a  few years to change the whole of European history. Here Bismarck for the  first time saw Albrecht von Roon, a cousin of the Blankenburgs, then a  rising young officer in the artillery; they often went out shooting  together. The Belows, Blankenburgs, and Kleists were to be the founders  and leaders of the Prussian Conservative party, which was Bismarck's  only support in his great struggle with the Parliament; and here, too,  came the men who were afterwards to be editors and writers of the _Kreuz  Zeitung_.    The religious convictions which Bismarck learnt from them were to be  lasting, and they profoundly influenced his character. He had probably  received little religious training from his mother, who belonged to the  rationalistic school of thought. It was by them that his monarchical  feeling was strengthened. It is not at first apparent what necessary  connection there is between monarchical government and Christian faith.  For Bismarck they were ever inseparably bound together; nothing but  religious belief would have reconciled him to a form of government so  repugnant to natural human reason. \"If I were not a Christian, I would  be a Republican,\" he said many years later; in Christianity he found the  only support against revolution and socialism. He was not the man to be  beguiled by romantic sentiment; he was not a courtier to be blinded by  the pomp and ceremony of royalty; he was too stubborn and independent to  acquiesce in the arbitrary rule of a single man. He could only obey the  king if the king himself held his authority as the representative of a  higher power. Bismarck was accustomed to follow out his thought to its  conclusions. To whom did the king owe his power? There was only one  alternative: to the people or to God. If to the people, then it was a  mere question of convenience whether the monarchy were continued in  form; there was little to choose between a constitutional monarchy where  the king was appointed by the people and controlled by Parliament, and  an avowed republic. This was the principle held by nearly all his  contemporaries. He deliberately rejected it. He did not hold that the  voice of the people was the voice of God. This belief did not satisfy  his moral sense; it seemed in public life to leave all to interest and  ambition and nothing to duty. It did not satisfy his critical intellect;  the word \"people\" was to him a vague idea. The service of the People or  of the King by the Grace of God, this was the struggle which was soon to  be fought out.    Bismarck's connection with his neighbours was cemented by his marriage.  At the beginning of 1847, he was engaged to a Fraeulein von Puttkammer,  whom he had first met at the Blankenburgs' house; she belonged to a  quiet and religious family, and it is said that her mother was at first  filled with dismay when she heard that Johanna proposed to marry the mad  Bismarck. He announced the engagement to his sister in a letter  containing the two words, \"All right,\" written in English. Before the  wedding could take place, a new impulse in his life was to begin. As  representative of the lower nobility he had to attend the meeting of the  Estates General which had been summoned in Berlin. From this time the  story of his life is interwoven with the history of his country.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER III.    THE REVOLUTION.    1847-1852.      Bismarck was a subject of the King of Prussia, but Prussia was after all  only one part of a larger unit; it was a part of Germany. At this time,  however, Germany was little more than a geographical expression. The  medieval emperors had never succeeded in establishing permanent  authority over the whole nation; what unity there had been was  completely broken down at the Reformation, and at the Revolution the  Empire itself, the symbol of a union which no longer existed, had been  swept away. At the restoration in 1815 the reorganisation of Germany was  one of the chief tasks before the Congress of Vienna. It was a task in  which the statesmen failed. All proposals to restore the Empire were  rejected, chiefly because Francis, who had taken the style of Emperor of  Austria, did not desire to resume his old title. Germany emerged from  the Revolution divided into thirty-nine different States; Austria was  one of the largest and most populous monarchies in Europe, but more than  half the Austrian Empire consisted of Italian, Slavonic, and Hungarian  provinces. The Emperor of Austria ruled over about 20,000,000 Germans.  The next State in size and importance was Prussia. Then came four  States, the Kingdoms of Saxony, Hanover, Bavaria, and Wuertemberg,  varying in size from five to two million inhabitants; below them were  some thirty principalities of which the smallest contained only a few  thousand inhabitants. By the principles adopted in the negotiations  which preceded the Congress of Vienna, every one of these States was  recognised as a complete independent monarchy, with its own laws and  constitutions. The recognition of this independence made any common  government impossible. Neither Austria nor Prussia would submit to any  external authority, or to one another; the Kings of Bavaria and  Wuertemberg were equally jealous of their independence. All that could be  done was to establish a permanent offensive and defensive alliance  between these States. For the management of common concerns, a Diet was  appointed to meet at Frankfort; the Diet, however, was only a union of  diplomatists; they had to act in accordance with instructions from their  governments and they had no direct authority over the Germans; each  German was officially regarded as a subject, as the case might be, of  the King of Prussia, the Prince of Reuss, the Grand Duke of Weimar.  There was no German army, no German law, no German church. No  development of common institutions was possible, for no change could be  introduced without the universal consent of every member of the  Confederation.    This lamentable result of the Congress of Vienna caused much  dissatisfaction among the thinking classes in Germany. A very strong  national feeling had been aroused by the war against Napoleon. This  found no satisfaction in the new political institutions. The discontent  was increased when it was discovered that the Diet, so useless for all  else, was active only against liberty. Prince Metternich, a very able  diplomatist, knew that the Liberal and National ideas, which were so  generally held at that time, would be fatal to the existence of the  Austrian Empire; he therefore attempted to suppress them, not only in  Austria, but also in Germany, as he did in Italy. Unfortunately the King  of Prussia, Frederick William III.,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12406"],[0,"Kepler (#6)"],[1,"should have been ample for  his expenses, increased though they were by his growing family, but in  the depleted state of the treasury there were many who objected to any  payment for such \"unpractical\" purposes. This particular attitude has  not been confined to any special epoch or country, but the obvious  result in Kepler's case was to compel him to apply himself to less  expensive matters than the Planetary Tables, and among these must be  included not only the horoscopes or nativities, which owing to his  reputation were always in demand, but also other writings which probably  did not pay so well. In 1604 he published \"A Supplement to Vitellion,\"  containing the earliest known reasonable theory of optics, and  especially of dioptrics or vision through lenses. He compared the  mechanism of the eye with that of Porta's \"Camera Obscura,\" but made no  attempt to explain how the image formed on the retina is understood by  the brain. He went carefully into the question of refraction, the  importance of which Tycho had been the first astronomer to recognise,  though he only applied it at low altitudes, and had not arrived at a  true theory or accurate values. Kepler wasted a good deal of time and  ingenuity on trial theories. He would invariably start with some  hypothesis, and work out the effect. He would then test it by  experiment, and when it failed would at once recognise that his  hypothesis was _a priori_ bound to fail. He rarely seems to have noticed  the fatal objections in time to save himself trouble. He would then at  once start again on a new hypothesis, equally gratuitous and equally  unfounded. It never seems to have occurred to him that there might be a  better way of approaching a problem. Among the lines he followed in this  particular investigation were, first, that refraction depends only on  the angle of incidence, which, he says, cannot be correct as it would  thus be the same for all refracting substances; next, that it depended  also on the density of the medium. This was a good shot, but he  unfortunately assumed that all rays passing into a denser medium would  apparently penetrate it to a depth depending only on the medium, which  means that there is a constant ratio between the tangents, instead of  the sines, of the inclination of the incident and refracted rays to the  normal. Experiment proved that this gave too high values for refraction  near the vertical compared with those near the horizon, so Kepler \"went  off at a tangent\" and tried a totally new set of ideas, which all  reduced to the absurdity of a refraction which vanished at the horizon.  These were followed by another set, involving either a constant amount  of refraction or one becoming infinite. He then came to the conclusion  that these geometrical methods must fail because the refracted image is  not real, and determined to try by analogy only, comparing the equally  unreal image formed by a mirror with that formed by refraction in water.  He noticed how the bottom of a vessel containing water appears to rise  more and more away from the vertical, and at once jumped to the analogy  of a concave mirror, which magnifies the image, while a convex mirror  was likened to a rarer medium. This line of attack also failed him, as  did various attempts to find relations between his measurements of  refraction and conic sections, and he broke off suddenly with a diatribe  against Tycho's critics, whom he likened to blind men disputing about  colours. Not many years later Snell discovered the true law of  refraction, but Kepler's contribution to the subject, though he failed  to discover the actual law, includes several of the adopted \"by-laws\".  He noted that atmospheric refraction would alter with the height of the  atmosphere and with temperature, and also recognised the fact that  rainbow colours depend on the angle of refraction, whether seen in the  rainbow itself, or in dew, glass, water, or any similar medium. He thus  came near to anticipating Newton. Before leaving the subject of Kepler's  optics it will be well to recall that a few years later after hearing of  Galileo's telescope, Kepler suggested that for astronomical purposes two  convex lenses should be used, so that there should be a real image where  measuring wires could be placed for reference. He did not carry out the  idea himself, and it was left to the Englishman Gascoigne to produce the  first instrument on this \"Keplerian\" principle, universally known as the  Astronomical Telescope.    In 1606 came a second treatise on the new star, discussing various  theories to account for its appearance, and refusing to accept the  notion that it was a \"fortuitous concourse of atoms\". This was followed  in 1607 by a treatise on comets, suggested by the comet appearing that  year, known as Halley's comet after its next return. He regarded comets  as \"planets\" moving in straight lines, never having examined sufficient  observations of any comet to convince himself that their paths are  curved. If he had not assumed that they were external to the system and  so could not be expected to return, he might have anticipated Halley's  discovery. Another suggestive remark of his was to the effect that the  planets must be self-luminous, as otherwise Mercury and Venus, at any  rate, ought to show phases. This was put to the test not long afterwards  by means of Galileo's telescope.    In 1607 Kepler rushed into print with an alleged observation of Mercury  crossing the sun, but after Galileo's discovery of sun-spots, Kepler at  once cheerfully retracted his observation of \"Mercury,\" and so far was  he from being annoyed or bigoted in his views, that he warmly adopted  Galileo's side, in contrast to most of those whose opinions were liable  to be overthrown by the new discoveries. Maestlin and others of Kepler's  friends took the opposite view.              CHAPTER V.    KEPLER'S LAWS.      When Gilbert of Colchester, in his \"New Philosophy,\" founded on his  researches in magnetism, was dealing with tides, he did not suggest that  the moon attracted the water, but that \"subterranean spirits and  humours, rising in sympathy with the moon, cause the sea also to rise  and flow to the shores and up rivers\". It appears that an idea,  presented in some such way as this, was more readily received than a  plain statement. This so-called philosophical method was, in fact, very  generally applied, and Kepler, who shared Galileo's admiration for  Gilbert's work, adopted it in his own attempt to extend the idea of  magnetic attraction to the planets. The general idea of \"gravity\"  opposed the hypothesis of the rotation of the earth on the ground that  loose objects would fly off: moreover, the latest refinements of the old  system of planetary motions necessitated their orbits being described  about a mere empty point. Kepler very strongly combated these notions,  pointing out the absurdity of the conclusions to which they tended, and  proceeded in set terms to describe his own theory.    \"Every corporeal substance, so far forth as it is corporeal, has a  natural fitness for resting in every place where it may be situated by  itself beyond the sphere of influence of a body cognate with it. Gravity  is a mutual affection between cognate bodies towards union or  conjunction (similar in kind to the magnetic virtue), so that the earth  attracts a stone much rather than the stone seeks the earth. Heavy  bodies (if we begin by assuming the earth to be in the centre of the  world) are not carried to the centre of the world in its quality of  centre of the world, but as to the centre of a cognate round body,  namely, the earth; so that wheresoever the earth may be placed, or  whithersoever it may be carried by its animal faculty, heavy bodies will  always be carried towards it. If the earth were not round, heavy bodies  would not tend from every side in a straight line towards the centre of  the earth, but to different points from different sides. If two stones  were placed in any part of the world near each other, and beyond the  sphere of influence of a third cognate body, these stones, like two  magnetic needles, would come together in the intermediate point, each  approaching the other by a space proportional to the comparative mass of  the other. If the moon and earth were not retained in their orbits by  their animal force or some other equivalent, the earth would mount to  the moon by a fifty-fourth part of their distance, and the moon fall  towards the earth through the other fifty-three parts, and they would  there meet, assuming, however, that the substance of both is of the same  density. If the earth should cease to attract its waters to itself all  the waters of the sea would he raised and would flow to the body of the  moon. The sphere of the attractive virtue which is in the moon extends  as far as the earth, and entices up the waters; but as the moon flies  rapidly across the zenith, and the waters cannot follow so quickly, a  flow of the ocean is occasioned in the torrid zone towards the westward.  If the attractive virtue of the moon extends as far as the earth, it  follows with greater reason that the attractive virtue of the earth  extends as far as the moon and much farther; and, in short, nothing  which consists of earthly substance anyhow constituted although thrown  up to any height, can ever escape the powerful operation of this  attractive virtue. Nothing which consists of corporeal matter is  absolutely light, but that is comparatively lighter which is rarer,  either by its own nature, or by accidental heat. And it is not to be  thought that light bodies are escaping to the surface of the universe  while they are carried upwards, or that they are not attracted by the  earth. They are attracted, but in a less degree, and so are driven  outwards by the heavy bodies; which being done, they stop, and are kept  by the earth in their own place. But although the"]]]
