Provided my  experiences were not corroborated, I could find strength somehow to deny  them, perhaps. With the daylight I could persuade myself that it was all a  subjective hallucination, a fantasy of the night, a projection of the  excited imagination.    Nothing further came in to disturb me, and I fell asleep almost at once,  utterly exhausted, yet still in dread of hearing again that weird sound of  multitudinous pattering, or of feeling the pressure upon my heart that had  made it difficult to breathe.    The sun was high in the heavens when my companion woke me from a heavy  sleep and announced that the porridge was cooked and there was just time to  bathe. The grateful smell of frizzling bacon entered the tent door.    \"River still rising,\" he said, \"and several islands out in mid-stream have  disappeared altogether. Our own island's much smaller.\"    \"Any wood left?\" I asked sleepily.    \"The wood and the island will finish tomorrow in a dead heat,\" he laughed,  \"but there's enough to last us till then.\"    I plunged in from the point of the island, which had indeed altered a lot  in size and shape during the night, and was swept down in a moment to the  landing-place opposite the tent. The water was icy, and the banks flew by  like the country from an express train. Bathing under such conditions was  an exhilarating operation, and the terror of the night seemed cleansed out  of me by a process of evaporation in the brain. The sun was blazing hot;  not a cloud showed itself anywhere; the wind, however, had not abated one  little jot.    Quite suddenly then the implied meaning of the Swede's words flashed across  me, showing that he no longer wished to leave post-haste, and had changed  his mind. \"Enough to last till tomorrow\"--he assumed we should stay on the  island another night. It struck me as odd. The night before he was so  positive the other way. How had the change come about?    Great crumblings of the banks occurred at breakfast, with heavy splashings  and clouds of spray which the wind brought into our frying-pan, and my  fellow-traveler talked incessantly about the difficulty the Vienna-Pesth  steamers must have to find the channel in flood. But the state of his mind  interested and impressed me far more than the state of the river or the  difficulties of the steamers. He had changed somehow since the evening  before. His manner was different--a trifle excited, a trifle shy, with a  sort of suspicion about his voice and gestures. I hardly know how to  describe it now in cold blood, but at the time I remember being quite  certain of one thing--that he had become frightened?    He ate very little breakfast, and for once omitted to smoke his pipe. He  had the map spread open beside him, and kept studying its markings.    \"We'd better get off sharp in an hour,\" I said presently, feeling for an  opening that must bring him indirectly to a partial confession at any rate.  And his answer puzzled me uncomfortably: \"Rather! If they'll let us.\"    \"Who'll let us? The elements?\" I asked quickly, with affected indifference.    \"The powers of this awful place, whoever they are,\" he replied, keeping his  eyes on the map. \"The gods are here, if they are anywhere at all in the  world.\"    \"The elements are always the true immortals,\" I replied, laughing as  naturally as I could manage, yet knowing quite well that my face reflected  my true feelings when he looked up gravely at me and spoke across the  smoke:    \"We shall be fortunate if we get away without further disaster.\"    This was exactly what I had dreaded, and I screwed myself up to the point  of the direct question. It was like agreeing to allow the dentist to  extract the tooth; it had to come anyhow in the long run, and the rest was  all pretence.    \"Further disaster! Why, what's happened?\"    \"For one thing--the steering paddle's gone,\" he said quietly.    \"The steering paddle gone!\" I repeated, greatly excited, for this was our  rudder, and the Danube in flood without a rudder was suicide. \"But what--\"    \"And there's a tear in the bottom of the canoe,\" he added, with a genuine  little tremor in his voice.    I continued staring at him, able only to repeat the words in his face  somewhat foolishly. There, in the heat of the sun, and on this burning  sand, I was aware of a freezing atmosphere descending round us. I got up to  follow him, for he merely nodded his head gravely and led the way towards  the tent a few yards on the other side of the fireplace. The canoe still  lay there as I had last seen her in the night, ribs uppermost, the paddles,  or rather, the paddle, on the sand beside her.    \"There's only one,\" he said, stooping to pick it up. \"And here's the rent  in the base-board.\"    It was on the tip of my tongue to tell him that I had clearly noticed two  paddles a few hours before, but a second impulse made me think better of  it, and I said nothing. I approached to see.    There was a long, finely made tear in the bottom of the canoe where a  little slither of wood had been neatly taken clean out; it looked as if the  tooth of a sharp rock or snag had eaten down her length, and investigation  showed that the hole went through. Had we launched out in her without  observing it we must inevitably have foundered. At first the water would  have made the wood swell so as to close the hole, but once out in  mid-stream the water must have poured in, and the canoe, never more than  two inches above the surface, would have filled and sunk very rapidly.    \"There, you see an attempt to prepare a victim for the sacrifice,\" I heard  him saying, more to himself than to me, \"two victims rather,\" he added as  he bent over and ran his fingers along the slit.    I began to whistle--a thing I always do unconsciously when utterly  nonplussed--and purposely paid no attention to his words. I was determined  to consider them foolish.    \"It wasn't there last night,\" he said presently, straightening up from his  examination and looking anywhere but at me.    \"We must have scratched her in landing, of course,\" I stopped whistling to  say. \"The stones are very sharp.\"    I stopped abruptly, for at that moment he turned round and met my eye  squarely. I knew just as well as he did how impossible my explanation was.  There were no stones, to begin with.    \"And then there's this to explain too,\" he added quietly, handing me the  paddle and pointing to the blade.    A new and curious emotion spread freezingly over me as I took and examined  it. The blade was scraped down all over, beautifully scraped, as though  someone had sand-papered it with care, making it so thin that the first  vigorous stroke must have snapped it off at the elbow.    \"One of us walked in his sleep and did this thing,\" I said feebly, \"or--or  it has been filed by the constant stream of sand particles blown against it  by the wind, perhaps.\"    \"Ah,\" said the Swede, turning away, laughing a little, \"you can explain  everything.\"    \"The same wind that caught the steering paddle and flung it so near the  bank that it fell in with the next lump that crumbled,\" I called out after  him, absolutely determined to find an explanation for everything he showed  me.    \"I see,\" he shouted back, turning his head to look at me before  disappearing among the willow bushes.    Once alone with these perplexing evidences of personal agency, I think my  first thoughts took the form of \"One of us must have done this thing, and  it certainly was not I.\" But my second thought decided how impossible it  was to suppose, under all the circumstances, that either of us had done it.  That my companion, the trusted friend of a dozen similar expeditions, could  have knowingly had a hand in it, was a suggestion not to be entertained for  a moment. Equally absurd seemed the explanation that this imperturbable and  densely practical nature had suddenly become insane and was busied with  insane purposes.    Yet the fact remained that what disturbed me most, and kept my fear  actively alive even in this blaze of sunshine and wild beauty, was the  clear certainty that some curious alteration had come about in his  mind--that he was nervous, timid, suspicious, aware of goings on he did not  speak about, watching a series of secret and hitherto unmentionable  events--waiting, in a word, for a climax that he expected, and, I thought,  expected very soon. This grew up in my mind intuitively--I hardly knew how.    I made a hurried examination of the tent and its surroundings, but the  measurements of the night remained the same. There were deep hollows formed  in the sand I now noticed for the first time, basin-shaped and of various  depths and sizes, varying from that of a tea-cup to a large bowl. The wind,  no doubt, was responsible for these miniature craters, just as it was for  lifting the paddle and tossing it towards the water. The rent in the canoe  was the only thing that seemed quite inexplicable; and, after all, it was  conceivable that a sharp point had caught it when we landed. The  examination I made of the shore did not assist this theory, but all the  same I clung to it with that diminishing portion of my intelligence which I  called my \"reason.\" An explanation of some kind was an absolute necessity,  just as some working explanation of the universe is necessary--however  absurd--to the happiness of every individual who seeks to do his duty in  the world and face the problems of life. The simile seemed to me at the  time an exact parallel.    I at once set the pitch melting, and presently the Swede joined me at the  work, though under the best conditions in the world the canoe could not be  safe for traveling till the following day. I drew his attention casually to  the hollows in the sand.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"I know. They're all over the island. But you can explain  them, no doubt!\"    \"Wind, of course,\" I answered without hesitation. \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11440"],[0,"Tales of Three Hemispheres (#6)"],[1,"thirty thousand pounds.  A little  bargaining followed, the price came down and the old brown coat  changed hands once more, for twenty thousand pounds.    Let any who may be inclined to doubt my story understand that in the  City, as any respectable company promoter will tell them, twenty  thousand pounds is invested almost daily with less return for it than  an old tail coat.  And, whatever doubts Mr. Peters felt that day about  the wisdom of his investment, there before him lay that tangible  return, that something that may be actually fingered and seen, which  is so often denied to the investor in gold mines and other Selected  Investments.  Yet as the days wore on and the old coat grew no  younger, nor any more wonderful, nor the least useful, but more and  more like an ordinary old coat, Peters began once more to doubt his  astuteness. Before the week was out his doubts had grown acute.  And  then one morning, Santiago returned.  A man, he said, had just arrived  from Spain, a friend unexpected all of a sudden in Paris, from whom he  might borrow money: and would Peters resell the coat for thirty  thousand pounds?    It was then that Peters, seeing his opportunity, cast aside the  pretence that he had maintained for so long of knowing something about  the mysterious coat, and demanded to know its properties. Santiago  swore that he knew not, and repeatedly swore the same by many sacred  names; but when Peters as often threatened not to sell, Santiago at  last drew out a thin cigar and, lighting it and settling himself in a  chair, told all he knew of the coat.    He had been on its tracks for weeks with suspicions growing all the  time that it was no ordinary coat, and at last he had run it to earth  in that auction room but would not bid for it more than twenty pounds  for fear of letting every one into the secret.  What the secret was he  swore he did not know, but this much he knew all along, that the  weight of the coat was absolutely nothing; and he had discovered by  testing it with acids that the brown stuff of which the coat was made  was neither cloth nor silk nor any known material, and would neither  burn nor tear. He believed it to be some undiscovered element.  And  the properties of the coat which he was convinced were marvellous he  felt sure of discovering within another week by means of experiments  with his chemicals.  Again he offered thirty thousand pounds, to be  paid within two or three days if all went well.  And then they started  haggling together as business men will.    And all the morning went by over the gardens of the Tuileries and the  afternoons came on, and only by two o'clock they arrived at an  understanding, on a basis, as they called it, of thirty thousand  guineas.  And the old tail coat was brought out and spread on the  table, and they examined it together and chatted about its properties,  all the more friendly for their strenuous argument.  And Santiago was  rising up to go, and Peters pleasantly holding out his hand, when a  step was heard on the stair.  It echoed up to the room, the door  opened.  And an elderly labouring man came stumping in.  He walked  with difficulty, almost like a bather who has been swimming and  floating all morning and misses the buoyancy of the water when he has  come to land. He stumped up to the table without speaking and there at  once caught sight of the old brown coat.    \"Why,\" he said, \"that be my old coat.\"    And without another word he put it on.  In the fierce glare of his  eyes as he fitted on that coat, carefully fastening the buttons,  buttoning up the flap of a pocket here, unbuttoning one there, neither  Peters nor Santiago found a word to say.  They sat there wondering how  they had dared to bid for that brown tail coat, how they had dared to  buy it, even to touch it, they sat there silent without a single  excuse.  And with no word more the old labourer stumped across the  room, opened wide the double window that looked on the Tuileries  gardens and, flashing back over his shoulder one look that was full of  scorn, stumped away up through the air at an angle of forty degrees.    Peters and Santiago saw him bear to his left from the window; passing  diagonally over the Rue de Rivoli and over a corner of the Tuileries  gardens; they saw him clear the Louvre, and thence they dumbly watched  him still slanting upwards, stepping out with a firmer and more  confident stride as he dwindled and dwindled away with his old brown  coat.    Neither spoke till he was no more than a speck in the sky far away  over Paris going South Eastwards.    \"Well I am blowed,\" said Peters.    But Santiago sadly shook his head.  \"I knew it was a good coat,\" he  said.  \"I _knew_ it was a good coat.\"          AN ARCHIVE OF THE OLDER MYSTERIES    It is told in the Archive of the Older Mysteries of China that one of  the house of Tlang was cunning with sharpened iron and went to the  green jade mountains and carved a green jade god.  And this was in the  cycle of the Dragon, the seventy-eighth year.    And for nearly a hundred years men doubted the green jade god, and  then they worshipped him for a thousand years; and after that they  doubted him again, and the green jade god made a miracle and whelmed  the green jade mountains, sinking them down one evening at sunset into  the earth so that there is only a marsh where the green jade mountains  were.  And the marsh is full of the lotus.    By the side of this lotus marsh, just as it glitters at evening, walks  Li La Ting, the Chinese girl, to bring the cows home; she goes behind  them singing of the river Lo Lang Ho.  And thus she sings of the  river, even of Lo Lang Ho: she sings that he is indeed of all rivers  the greatest, born of more ancient mountains than even the wise men  know, swifter than hares, more deep than the sea, the master of other  rivers perfumed even as roses and fairer than the sapphires around the  neck of a prince.  And then she would pray to the river Lo Lang Ho,  master of rivers and rival of the heaven at dawn, to bring her down in  a boat of light bamboo a lover rowing out of the inner land in a  garment of yellow silk with turquoises at his waist, young and merry  and idle, with a face as yellow as gold and a ruby in his cap with  lanterns shining at dusk.    Thus she would pray of an evening to the river Lo Lang Ho as she went  behind the cows at the edge of the lotus marshes and the green jade  god under the lotus marshes was jealous of the lover that the maiden  Li La Ting would pray for of an evening to the river Lo Lang Ho, and  he cursed the river after the manner of gods and turned it into a  narrow and evil smelling stream.    And all this happened a thousand years ago, and Lo Lang Ho is but a  reproach among travelers and the story of that great river is  forgotten, and what became of the maiden no tale saith though all men  think she became a goddess of jade to sit and smile at a lotus on a  lotus carven of stone by the side of the green jade god far under the  marshes upon the peaks of the mountains, but women know that her ghost  still haunts the lotus marshes on glittering evenings, singing of Lo  Lang Ho.          A CITY OF WONDER    Past the upper corner of a precipice the moon rode into view.  Night  had for some while now hooded the marvelous city.  They had planned it  to be symmetrical, its maps were orderly, near; in two dimensions,  that is length and breadth, its streets met and crossed each other  with regular exactitude, with all the dullness of the science of man.  The city had laughed as it were and shaken itself free and in the  third dimension had soared away to consort with all the careless,  irregular things that know not man for their master.    Yet even there, even at those altitudes, man had still clung to his  symmetry, still claimed that these mountains were houses; in orderly  rows the thousand windows stood watching each other precisely, all  orderly, all alike, lest any should guess by day that there might be  mystery here.  So they stood in the daylight.  The sun set, still they  were orderly, as scientific and regular as the labour of only man and  the bees.  The mists darken at evening.  And first the Woolworth  Building goes away, sheer home and away from any allegiance to man, to  take his place among mountains; for I saw him stand with the lower  slopes invisible in the gloaming, while only his pinnacles showed up  in the clearer sky.  Thus only mountains stand.    Still all the windows of the other buildings stood in their regular  rows--all side by side in silence, not yet changed, as though waiting  one furtive moment to step from the schemes of man, to slip back to  mystery and romance again as cats do when they steal on velvet feet  away from familiar hearths in the dark of the moon.    Night fell, and the moment came.  Someone lit a window, far up another  shone with its orange glow.  Window by window, and yet not nearly all.  Surely if modern man with his clever schemes held any sway here still  he would have turned one switch and lit them all together; but we are  back with the older man of whom far songs tell, he whose spirit is kin  to strange romances and mountains.  One by one the windows shine from  the precipices; some twinkle, some are dark; man's orderly schemes  have gone, and we are amongst vast heights lit by inscrutable beacons.    I have seen such cities before, and I have told of them in _The Book  of Wonder_.    Here in New York a poet met a welcome.                        ** BEYOND THE FIELDS WE KNOW **    PUBLISHER'S NOTE    Beyond the fields we know, in the Lands of Dream, lies the Valley of  the Yann where the mighty river of that name, rising in the Hills of  Hap, idleing its way by massive dream-evoking amethyst cliffs,  orchid-laden forests, and ancient mysterious cities, comes to the Gates  of Yann and passes to the sea.
