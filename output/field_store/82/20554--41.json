He is next recognised by an old friend at a  gaming-table, who mentions the sale of an estate there for his last  stake, which property our student really had sold, though under  different circumstances; and then rejected by his _chere amie_ for a  slight which he never offered. The last event or link of this mysterious  chain is familiarly narrated as follows:--    In returning one morning from Westminster, as I was passing through one  of those small courts between Essex-street and Norfolk-street, (for of  late I had sought the most retired ways,) I observed that two persons,  of rather mean appearance, seemed to be dogging my footsteps. Uneasy at  this circumstance, I hastened directly on to my chambers. I had,  however, scarcely seated myself, when my servant informed me that two  men wished to speak to me. On being admitted, they told me that they  were officers of the police, and that they had a warrant to arrest me on  a charge of felony. Surprise at the moment prevented my speaking; but as  soon as I recovered myself I offered to accompany them to the  magistrate. He was sitting, and the witnesses being in attendance, my  examination took place immediately. A young man, of gentleman-like  address, swore, that on the preceding evening he had been induced by one  of his friends to visit one of the gambling-houses in the  Haymarket--that he there saw me both playing and betting very  rashly--that I appeared to be losing--that at length I quitted the room,  and that soon afterwards his friend and himself followed. Now came the  accusation. He swore, that just as he was leaving the door he felt some  person drawing his purse from his pocket--that he immediately pursued  the man, and at the corner of Jermyn-street seized _me._ That at first I  submitted, and he dragged me to one of the lamps, and there most  distinctly saw my countenance, when at that moment, by some piece of  adroitness, which he could not explain, I slipped from his grasp, and  instantly disappeared. His friend corroborated the story. The  magistrate, after cautioning me, and expressing his regret at seeing a  person of my appearance before him, asked me whether I wished to say any  thing in my defence, I answered that I was the victim of some secret and  devilish conspiracy, and that I would prove that I was at my chambers on  the night in question. \"I hope you may be able to do so,\" said the  magistrate; \"but in the mean time it is, my duty to commit you;\" and I  was conducted to gaol in a hackney-coach. I immediately summoned one or  two of my friends, and after laying open to them the circumstances in  which I had been placed, we concerted the best means of defence. My  laundress could swear that I was in chambers the whole of the evening  when the robbery was committed; and though this was the only direct  evidence in my favour, yet I assembled at least a dozen persons, men of  repute and station, as witnesses to my character. The trial excited  prodigious interest, but what was that interest to the agony with which  I regarded the issue! Should I be convicted, my mysterious enemies would  enjoy, in triumph, my disgrace and degradation, and might probably  proceed by the same diabolical contrivances to attempt even my life. The  day came, and I was arraigned among a herd of common felons; but the  consciousness of my innocence, and the hope of establishing it,  supported my heart. No sooner had I heard the witnesses for the  prosecution, than that hope died within me. A number of persons deposed,  that on the night in question they had seen me in the gambling-house;  but they were men of indifferent character, and not personally  acquainted with me. At last, with astonishment and horror I saw my  venerable friend, Mr. B----, put into the box, and heard him swear in  positive terms that he was present in the room, and saw me at play. My  defence availed nothing. The wretched old woman, whom I produced, as the  court and jury believed, to establish my defence by perjury, was  immediately discredited, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty. I  was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. My feelings I will not  attempt to describe.    During my confinement I made the most energetic attempts to reconcile  myself to my fatal destiny. I formed a plan for my future life, complete  in every particular. My character being destroyed, and most of my  friends alienated, I determined to convert my property into money, and  to seek a refuge in the United States. At length the term of my  imprisonment approached its close, and on the 30th of September, 1791, I  was liberated--my flesh creeps as I name the day.    I waited in the prison till it was dusk. Finding that I had the key of  my chambers upon my person, I resolved, in the first instance, to visit  once again the scene of my former tranquil studies. Before I reached the  Temple the gates had been closed, and the gatekeeper, as I entered, eyed  me with an unpleasant curiosity. I reached my chambers. There was still  light sufficient to enable me to select some papers which I particularly  wished to secure. I entered the chambers and walked in to my  sitting-room, but suddenly stopped on seeing a figure reclining on the  sofa. My library-table was before him, covered with law books. At first  I imagined that my laundress had permitted some stranger to occupy my  rooms during my incarceration. As I entered the chamber the figure rose,  and with feelings of indescribable horror I perceived the semblance of  myself--    --\"And my flesh's hair upstood,  'Twas mine own similitude.\"    --I cannot relate what followed, for my senses deserted me. On  recovering, my mysterious visiter had departed without leaving the  slightest clue by which I might fathom the impenetrable secret of my  persecutions. I have sometimes imagined that they arose from one of  those wonderful natural resemblances which in some instances appear to  be well authenticated; but, natural or supernatural, they changed the  current of my life. Unable to endure the disgrace of being pointed at as  a convicted felon, I converted my property into money, and, under  another name, I now live respected in a foreign land.--_Ibid._           *       *       *       *       *    THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF NEW WORKS.           *       *       *       *       *    \"FASHIONABLE TALES.\"    Lord Normanby has written one of the best, if not _the best_, of this  class of works, the tendency of which is in most instances of  questionable character. But they give a tone to the reading taste of the  day, as the recent circumstance of two of them forming the first subject  of three _literary_ reviews will sufficiently attest. The work to which  we specially allude, is _Matilda, a Tale of the Day_, the noble author  of which has just produced another of the same stamp, entitled _Yes and  No_, to whose sketches and portraits we shall shortly introduce our  readers. It will be seen that his lordship is no mean artist, nor does  he belong to the novel-making tribe, whose hole-and-corner curiosity has  made us as familiar with the _Corso_ as we are with our own Bond-street.  But the following snatch from _Yes and No_ proves that these smatterers  of fashion--these clippers of reputation--are encouraged by some portion  of that class whose vanities they affect to expose:--    SCENE--_A \"Hall\" in the Country._    \"It is always as well here to know who one's next neighbour is,\"  continued Fitzalbert, \"for this is not one of those snug parties where  one can do or say what one pleases without observation.\" \"How do you  mean?\" asked Germain. \"Why, Lady Boreton encourages these literary  poachers on the manors, or rather _manners_ of high life; she gives a  sort of right of free chase to all cockney sportsmen to wing one's  follies in a double-barrelled duodecimo, or hunt one's eccentricities  through a hot-pressed octavo. Not that they are, generally speaking,  very formidable shots--they often bring down a different bird from the  one they aimed at, and sometimes shut their eyes and blaze away at the  whole covey; which last is, after all, the best way. Their coming here  to pick out individuals is needless trouble. Do you know the modern  recipe for a finished picture of fashionable life? Let a gentleman_ly_  man, with a gentleman_ly_ style, take of foolscap paper a few quires;  stuff them well with high-sounding titles--dukes and duchesses, lords  and ladies, _ad libitum_. Then open the peerage at random, pick a  supposititious author out of one page of it, and fix the imaginary  characters upon some of the rest; mix it all up with quantum suff. of  puff, and the book is in a second edition before ninety-nine readers out  of a hundred have found out the one is as little likely to have written,  as the others to have done what is attributed to them.\"    Again--here is a picture of the guests: \"Captains that have been to the  North Pole; chemists who can extract ice from caloric; transatlantic  travellers and sedentary bookworms; some authors, who own to anonymous  publications they have never written; and others who are suspected of  those they deny; besides the usual quantum of young ladies and  gentlemen, who rest their claims to distinction upon the traditionary  deeds of their great grandfathers.\"           *       *       *       *       *    SOCIETY OF UNITED IRISHMEN.    At the head of the table, which occupied the centre of the apartment,  and in an arm-chair raised by a few steps from the floor, sat the  president of the society of United Irishmen.

I  was highly delighted; and jealousing that Nosey was ower supple to be  easily catched, I had nae apprehension for the event, and remained  snug in my birth to see the upshot.    In a short time, in comes Mr. Weft wi' a piece of lowing paper in his  hand that he had got frae the next door to licht the shop; and nae  sooner did Donald see him than he ax'd him for his note.    \"What note, honest man?\" said Mr. Weft.    \"Got tamn,\" quo' Donald; \"the note the auld scounrel, your  grandfather, stole frae me.\"    \"My grandfaither!\" answered the ither wi' amazement. \"I am thinking,  honest man, ye hae had a glass ower muckle. My grandfaither has been  dead for saxteen years, and I ne'er heard tell till now that he was a  fief.\"    \"Weel, weel, then,\" quo' the Heelandman, \"I don't care naething about  it. If he's no your grandfaither, he'll be your faither, or your  brither, or your cousin.\"    \"My faither or my brither, or my cousin!\" repeated Mr. Weft. \"I maun  tell ye plainly, frien', that I hae neither faither, nor brither, nor  cousin of ony description on this side of the grave. I dinna  understand ye, honest man, but I reckon that ye hae sat ower lang at  the whisky, and my advice to ye is to stap awa hame and sleep it aff.\"    At this speech the Heelandman lost a' patience, and lookit sae awfully  fairce, that ance or twice I was on the nick of coming forrit, and  explaining how matters really stood; but curiosity keepit me chained  to the back shop, and I just thocht I would bide a wee, and see how  the affair was like to end.    \"Pray, wha are you, sir?\" said Donald, putting his hands in his sides,  and looking through his specks upon Mr. Weft, like a deevil incarnit.  \"Wha are you, sir, that daar to speak to me in this manner?\"    \"Wha am I?\" said the ither, drapping the remnant of the paper, which  was burnin' close to his fingers. \"I am Saunders Weft, manufacturir In  Hamilton--that's what I am.\"    \"And I am Tonald Campbell, piper's sister's son to his grace the  great, grand Tuke of Argyle,\" thundered out the Heelandman, wi' a  voice that was fearsome to hear.    \"And what about that?\" quo' Mr. Weft, rather snappishly, as I thocht.  \"If ye were the great, grand Duke of Argyle himself, as ye ca' him,  I'll no permit you to kick up a dust in my shop.\"    \"Ye scounrel,\" said Donald, seizing Mr. Weft by the throat, and  shaking him till he tottered like an aspen leaf, \"div ye mean to speak  ill of his grace the Tuke of Argyle?\" And he gi'ed him anither  shake--then, laying haud of his nose, he swore that he would pu't as  lang as a cow's tail, if he didna that instant restore him his lost  property. At this sicht I began to grew a' ower, and now saw the  needcessity of stapping ben, and saving my employer frae farther  damage, bodily and itherwise. Nae sooner had I made my appearance than  Donald let go his grip of Mr. Weft's nose, and the latter, in a great  passion, cried out, \"William M'Gee, I tak ye to witness what I hae  sufferit frae this bluid-thirsty Heelandman! It's no to be endured in  a Christian country. I'll hae the law of him, that I will. I'll be  whuppit but I'll hae amends, although it costs me twenty pounds!\"    \"What's the matter?\" quo' I, pretending ignorance of the haill  concern. \"What, in the name of Nebuchadnezzar, has set ye thegither by  the lugs?\" Then Mr. Weft began his tale, how he had been collared and  weel nigh thrappled in his ain shop;--then the ither tauld how, in the  first place, Mr. Weft's grandfather, as he ca'd Nosey, had stolen his  note, and how, in the second place, Mr. Weft himsell had insulted the  great, grand Duke of Argyle. In a word, there was a desperate kick-up  between them, the ane threeping that he would tak the law of the ither  immediately. Na, in this respect Donald gaed the greatest lengths, for  he swore that, rather than be defeat, he wad carry his cause to the  house of lords, although it cost him thretty pounds sterling. I now  saw it was time to put in a word.    \"Houts-touts, gentlemen,\" quo' I, \"what's the use of a' this  clishmaclaver? Ye've baith gotten the wrang sow by the lug, or my  name's no William M'Gee. I'll wager ye a pennypiece, that my monkey,  Nosey is at the bottom of the business.\"    Nae sooner had I spoken the word, than the twa, looking round the  shop, spied the beastie sitting upon the shelf girning at them, and  putting out his tongue, and wiggle-waggling his walking-stick ower his  left elbow, as if he had been playing upon the fiddle. Mr. Weft at  this apparition set up a loud lauch; his passion left him in a moment,  when he saw the ridiculous mistake that the Heelandman had fa'en into,  and I thocht he would hae bursted his sides wi' evendown merriment. At  first Donald lookit desperate angry, and judging frae the way he was  twisting about his mouth and rowing his een, I opined that he intended  some deadly skaith to the monkey. But his gude sense, of which  Heelandmen are no a'thegither destitute, got the better of his anger,  and he roared and lauched like the very mischief. Nor was this a', for  nae sooner had he began to lauch, than the monkey did the same thing,  and held its sides in precisely the same manner, imitating his  actions, in the maist amusin' way imaginable. This only set Donald a  lauching mair than ever, and when he lifted up his nieve, and shook it  at Nosey in a gude humoured way, what think ye that the cratur did?  Odds man, he took the note frae his pouch, whare it lay rowed up like  a baw, and, papping it at Donald, hit him as fairly upon the nose, as  if it had been shot out of a weel-aimed musket. There was nae  resisting this. The haill three, or rather the haill four, for Nosey  joined us, set up a loud lauch; and the Heelandman's was the loudest  of a', showing that he was really a man of sense, and could tak a joke  as weel as his neighbours.    When the lauchin' had a wee subsided, Mr. Campbell, in order to show  that he had nae ill wull to Mr. Weft, ax'd his pardon for the rough  way he had treated him, but the worthy manufacturer wadna hear o't.  \"Houts, man,\" quo' he, \"dinna say a word about it. It's a mistak  a'thegether, and Solomon himsell, ye ken, whiles gaed wrang.\"  Whereupon the Heelandman bought a Kilmarnock nichtcap, price  elevenpence happeny, frae Mr. Weft, and paid him wi' part of the very  note that brocht on the ferly I hae just been relating. But his gude  wull didna end here, for he insisted on takin' us a'--Nosey amang the  lave--to the nearest public, where he gi'ed us a frien'ly glass, and  we keepit tawking about monkeys, and what not, in a manner at ance  edifying and amusing to hear.--_Blackwood's Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *      SCOTCH SONG.

This life is a garden where all choose their posies:    In the spring of our youth let us gather the roses;    For brief is their bloom like the dews of the morn,    If you seek them too late you will find but a thorn.

There is something so satisfactory in knowing at once the limit of  your fortunes--in making yourself secure in the first instance of that  happiness to which all your exertions are directed,--which is in fact  the end and aim of your worldly existence, and of all your worldly  toils--the enjoyment of domestic peace and love;--in quenching that  restless, burning anxiety, which is ever busy within the bosom of the  young and the aspiring. Marrying early, in fact, is taking time by the  forelock, and leading your future destinies after you, instead of  suffering yourself to be led and tossed about by them,--it is tearing  away the black veil from the brow of futurity, and perusing all her  lineaments in her own despite. It is [he continued with an oratorical  attitude] building your fate upon a rock--\"    \"Ah!\" I exclaimed, \"stop there--that _rock_ is so commonplace.\"    Harry laughed and went on with his argument.--\"Besides, there is the  gratification of making yourself _considered_ in society--which no  single man is. A single man is a kind of protected or licensed  vagabond--rambling to and fro without stamp or mark, as Witwould might  say,--like a sheep that has been overlooked at tarring time. His home  is a desert to him,--and the love of social converse, which is so  natural, and so amiable at the same time keeps him eternally in a  state of fidgetty restlessness, which precludes all possibility of  serious and persevering labour. Only think of the horrors of a house  without a queen--Yawning servants, negligent housekeepers, extorting  tradespeople,--these and a thousand other annoyances, for which you  have no relief, because you cannot stoop to meddle or make in such  transactions--are the agitations which perpetually infest the domestic  commonwealth of a bachelor.--But turn your eyes into the house of  'Benedick, the married man'--He wears his rue with a difference,  indeed!--There is a sense of life, bustle, mirth, and happiness, in  the very air of the dwelling.
