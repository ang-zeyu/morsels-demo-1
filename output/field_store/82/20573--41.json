[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1167"],[0,"A Strange Disappearance (#6)"],[1,"ver, it was  whispered in my ear by one gentleman, a former political colleague of  his who had been with him in Washington, that he was known at one time  to show considerable attention to Miss Evelyn Blake, that cousin of  his who has since made such a brilliant thing of it by marrying, and  straightway losing by death, a wealthy old scapegrace of a French noble,  the Count De Mirac. But that was not a matter to be talked about,  Madame the Countess being free at present and in New York, though to all  appearance upon anything but pleasant terms with her quondam admirer.    Remembering the picture I had seen in Mr. Blake's private apartment, I  asked if this lady was a brunette, and being told she was, and of the  most pronounced type, felt for the moment I had stumbled upon something  in the shape of a clue; but upon resorting to Mr. Gryce with my  information, he shook his head with a short laugh and told me I would  have to dive deeper than that if I wanted to fish up the truth lying at  the bottom of this well.        CHAPTER V. A NEW YORK BELLE      Meanwhile all our efforts to obtain information in regard to the fate or  whereabouts of the missing girl, had so far proved utterly futile. Even  the advertisements inserted by Mrs. Daniels had produced no effect; and  frustrated in my scheme I began to despair, when the accounts of that  same Mrs. Daniels' strange and unaccountable behavior during these days  of suspense, which came to me through Fanny, (the pretty housemaid at  Mr. Blake's, whose acquaintance I had lately taken to cultivating,)  aroused once more my dormant energies and led me to ask myself if the  affair was quite as hopeless as it seemed.    \"If she was a ghost,\" was her final expression on the subject, \"she  could'nt go peramberlating this house more than she does. It seems as if  she could'nt keep still a minute. Upstairs and down, upstairs and down,  till we're most wild. And so white as she is and so trembling! Why her  hands shake so all the time she never dares lift a dish off the table.  And then the way she hangs about Mr. Blake's door when he's at home!  She never goes in, that's the oddest part of it, but walks up and down  before it, wringing her hands and talking to herself just like a mad  woman. Why, I have seen her almost put her hand on the knob twice in  an afternoon perhaps, then draw back as if she was afraid it would burn  her; and if by any chance the door opened and Mr. Blake came out, you  ought to have seen how she run. What it all means I don't know, but I  have my imaginings, and if she is'nt crazy, why--\" etc., etc.    In face of facts like these I felt it would be pure insanity to despair.  Let there be but a mystery, though it involved a man of the position of  Mr. Blake and I was safe. My only apprehension had been that the whole  affair would dissolve itself into an ordinary elopement or some such  common-place matter.    When, therefore, a few minutes later, Fanny announced that Mr. Blake  had ordered a carriage to take him to the Charity Ball that evening,  I determined to follow him and learn if possible what change had  taken place in himself or his circumstances, to lead him into such an  innovation upon his usual habits. Though the hour was late I had but  little difficulty in carrying out my plan, arriving at the Academy  something less than an hour after the opening dance.    The crowd was great and I circulated the floor three times before I came  upon him. When I did, I own I was slightly disappointed; for instead of  finding him as I anticipated, the centre of an admiring circle of ladies  and gentlemen, I espied him withdrawn into a corner with a bland old  politician of the Fifteenth Ward, discussing, as I presently overheard,  the merits and demerits of a certain Smith who at that time was making  some disturbance in the party.    \"If that is all he has come for,\" thought I, \"I had better have stayed  at home and made love to the pretty Fanny.\" And somewhat chagrined, I  took up my stand near by, and began scrutinizing the ladies.    Suddenly I felt my heart stand still, the noise of voices ceasing  the same instant behind me. A lady was passing on the arm of a  foreign-looking gentleman, whom it did not require a second glance to  identify with the subject of the portrait in Mr. Blake's house. Older by  some few years than when her picture was painted, her beauty had assumed  a certain defiant expression that sufficiently betrayed the fact that  the years had not been so wholly happy as she had probably anticipated  when she jilted handsome Holman Blake for the old French Count. At all  events so I interpreted the look of latent scorn that burned in her dark  eyes, as she slowly turned her richly bejeweled head towards the corner  where that gentleman stood, and meeting his eyes no doubt, bowed with a  sudden loss of self-possession that not all the haughty carriage of  her noble form, held doubly erect for the next few moments, could quite  conceal or make forgotten.    \"She still loves him,\" I inwardly commented and turned to see if the  surprise had awakened any expression on his uncommunicative countenance.    Evidently not, for the tough old politician of the Fifteenth Ward was  laughing, at one of his own jokes probably, and looking up in the  face of Mr. Blake, whose back was turned to me, in a way that entirely  precluded all thought of any tragic expression in that quarter. Somewhat  disgusted, I withdrew and followed the lady.    I could not get very near. By this time the presence of a live countess  in the assembly had become known, and I found her surrounded by a swarm  of half-fledged youths. But I cared little for this; all I wanted to  know was whether Mr. Blake would approach her or not during the evening.  Tediously the moments passed; but a detective on duty, or on fancied  duty, succumbs to no weariness. I had a woman before me worth studying  and the time could not be thrown away. I learned to know her beauty;  the poise of her head, the flush of her cheek, the curl of her lip, the  glance--yes, the glance of her eye, though that was more difficult to  understand, for she had a way of drooping her lids at times that, while  exceedingly effective upon the poor wretch toward whom she might be  directing that half-veiled shaft of light, was anything but conducive to  my purposes.    At length with a restless shrug of her haughty shoulders she turned away  from her crowd of adorers, her breast heaving under its robing of garnet  velvet, and her whole face flaring with a light that might mean resolve  and might mean simply love. I had no need to turn my head to see who was  advancing towards her; her stately attitude as countess, her thrilling  glance as woman, betrayed only too readily.    He was the more composed of the two. Bowing over her hand with a few  words I could not hear, he drew back a step and began uttering the usual  common-place sentiments of the occasion.    She did not respond. With a splendor of indifference not often seen even  in the manner of our grandest ladies, she waited, opening and shutting  her richly feathered fan, as one who would say, \"I know all this has to  be gone through with, therefore I will be patient.\" But as the moments  passed, and his tone remained unchanged, I could detect a slight gleam  of impatience flash in the depths of her dark eyes, and a change  come into the conventional smile that had hitherto lighted, without  illuminating her countenance. Drawing still further back from the crowd  that was not to be awed from pressing upon her, she looked around as if  seeking a refuge. Her glance fell upon a certain window, with a gleam  of satisfaction. Seeing they would straightway withdraw there, I took  advantage of the moment and made haste to conceal myself behind a  curtain as near that vicinity as possible. In another instant I heard  them approaching.    \"You seem to be rather overwhelmed with attention to-night,\" were the  first words I caught, uttered in Mr. Blake's calmest and most courteous  tones.    \"Do you think so?\" was the slightly sarcastic reply. \"I was just  deciding to the contrary when you came up.\"    There was a pause. Taking out my knife, I ripped open a seam in the  curtain hanging before me, and looked through. He was eyeing her  intently, a firm look upon his face that made its reserve more marked  than common. I saw him gaze at her handsome head piled with its midnight  tresses amid which the jewels, doubtless of her dead lord, burned with  a fierce and ominous glare, at her smooth olive brow, her partly veiled  eyes where the fire passionately blazed, at her scarlet lips trembling  with an emotion her rapidly flushing cheeks would not allow her to  conceal. I saw his glances fall and embrace her whole elegant form with  its casing of ruby velvet and ornamentation of lace and diamonds, and  an expectant thrill passed through me almost as if I already beheld the  mask of his reserve falling, and the true man flash out in response to  the wooing beauty of this full-blown rose, evidently in waiting for him.  But it died away and a deeper feeling seized me as I saw his glances  return unkindled to her countenance, and heard him say in still more  measured accents than before:    \"Is it possible then that the Countess De Mirac can desire the adulation  of us poor American plebeians? I had not thought it, madame.\"    Slowly her dark eyes turned towards him; she stood a statue.    \"But I forget,\" he went on, a tinge of bitterness for a moment showing  itself in his smile: \"perhaps in returning to her own country, Evelyn  Blake has so far forgotten the last two years as to find pleasure again  in the toys and foibles of her youth. Such things have been, I hear.\"  And he bowed almost to the ground in his half sarcastic homage.    \"Evelyn Blake! It is long since I have heard that name,\" she murmured.    He could not restrain the quick flush from mounting to his brow."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11692"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 03 (#6)"],[1,"olitude;--    Silence unstirr'd--save where the guilty tread    Call'd the dull echo from mysterious vaults!      High from the opening of the dome above,    Came with wan smile the silver-shining moon.    And, awful as some pale presiding god,    Dim-gleaming through the hush of that large gloom,    In its wan veil the Giant Image stood.       With an unsteady step he onward past,    Already touch'd the violating hand    The Holy--and recoil'd! a shudder thrill'd    His limbs, fire-hot and icy-cold in turns,    As if invisible arms would pluck the soul    Back from the deed.                       \"O miserable man!    What would'st thou?\" (Thus within the inmost heart    Murmur'd the warning whisper.) \"Wilt thou dare    The All-hallow'd to profane? 'No mortal-born'    (So spake the oracular word)--'may lift the veil    Till I myself shall raise!' Yet said it not--    The same oracular word--'who lifts the veil    Shall see the truth?' Behind, be what there may,    I dare the hazard--I will lift the veil--\"    Loud rang his shouting voice--\"and I will see!\"                                           \"SEE!\"    A lengthen'd echo, mocking, shrill'd again!    He spoke and rais'd the veil! And ask'st thou what    Unto the sacrilegious gaze lay bare?    I know not--pale and senseless, stretch'd before    The statue of the great Egyptian queen,    The priests beheld him at the dawn of day;    But what he saw, or what did there befall,    His lips reveal'd not. Ever from his heart    Was fled the sweet serenity of life,    And the deep anguish dug the early grave    \"Woe--woe to him\"--such were his warning words,    Answering some curious and impetuous brain,    \"Woe--for her face shall charm him never more!    Woe--woe to him who treads through Guilt to TRUTH!\"           *       *       *       *       *        THE IDEAL AND THE ACTUAL LIFE (1795)      I      Forever fair, forever calm and bright,    Life flies on plumage, zephyr-light,      For those who on the Olympian hill rejoice--    Moons wane, and races wither to the tomb,    And 'mid the universal ruin, bloom      The rosy days of Gods--                         With Man, the choice,    Timid and anxious, hesitates between      The sense's pleasure and the soul's content;    While on celestial brows, aloft and sheen,      The beams of both are blent.      II      Seek'st thou on earth the life of Gods to share,    Safe in the Realm of Death?--beware      To pluck the fruits that glitter to thine eye;    Content thyself with gazing on their glow--    Short are the joys Possession can bestow,      And in Possession sweet Desire will die.    'Twas not the ninefold chain of waves that bound      Thy daughter, Ceres, to the Stygian river--    She pluck'd the fruit of the unholy ground,      And so--was Hell's forever!      III      The Weavers of the Web--the Fates--but sway    The matter and the things of clay;      Safe from each change that Time to Matter gives,    Nature's blest playmate, free at will to stray      With Gods a god, amidst the fields of Day,      The FORM, the ARCHETYPE,[4] serenely lives.    Would'st thou soar heavenward on its joyous wing?      Cast from thee, Earth, the bitter and the real,    High from this cramp'd and dungeon being, spring      Into the Realm of the Ideal!      IV      Here, bathed, Perfection, in thy purest ray,    Free from the clogs and taints of clay,      Hovers divine the Archetypal Man!    Dim as those phantom ghosts of life that gleam    And wander voiceless by the Stygian stream,--      Fair as it stands in fields Elysian,    Ere down to Flesh the Immortal doth descend:--      If doubtful ever in the Actual life    Each contest--_here_ a victory crowns the end      Of every nobler strife.      V      Not from the strife itself to set thee free,    But more to nerve--doth Victory      Wave her rich garland from the Ideal clime.    Whate'er thy wish, the Earth has no repose--    Life still must drag thee onward as it flows,      Whirling thee down the dancing surge of Time.    But when the courage sinks beneath the dull      Sense of its narrow limits--on the soul,    Bright from the hill-tops of the Beautiful,      Bursts the attained goal!      VI      If worth thy while the glory and the strife    Which fire the lists of Actual Life--      The ardent rush to fortune or to fame,    In the hot field where Strength and Valor are,    And rolls the whirling thunder of the car,      And the world, breathless, eyes the glorious game--    Then dare and strive--the prize can but belong      To him whose valor o'er his tribe prevails;    In life the victory only crowns the strong--      He who is feeble fails.      VII      But Life, whose source, by crags around it pil'd,    Chafed while confin'd, foams fierce and wild,      Glides soft and smooth when once its streams expand,    When its waves, glassing in their silver play,    Aurora blent with Hesper's milder ray,      Gain the Still BEAUTIFUL--that Shadow-Land!    Here, contest grows but interchange of Love;      All curb is but the bondage of the Grace;    Gone is each foe,--Peace folds her wings above      Her native dwelling-place.      VIII      When, through dead stone to breathe a soul of light,    With the dull matter to unite      The kindling genius, some great sculptor glows;    Behold him straining every nerve intent--    Behold how, o'er the subject element,      The stately THOUGHT its march laborious goes!    For never, save to Toil untiring, spoke      The unwilling Truth from her mysterious well--    The statue only to the chisel's stroke      Wakes from its marble cell.      IX      But onward to the Sphere of Beauty--go    Onward, O Child of Art! and, lo,      Out of the matter which thy pains control    The Statue springs!--not as with labor wrung    From the hard block, but as from Nothing sprung--      Airy and light--the offspring of the soul!    The pangs, the cares, the weary toils it cost      Leave not a trace when once the work is done--    The Artist's human frailty merged and lost      In Art's great victory won!      X      If human Sin confronts the rigid law    Of perfect Truth and Virtue, awe      Seizes and saddens thee to see how far    Beyond thy reach, Perfection;--if we test    By the Ideal of the Good, the best,      How mean our efforts and our actions are!    This space between the Ideal of man's soul      And man's achievement, who hath ever past?    An ocean spreads between us and that goal      Where anchor ne'er was cast!      XI      But fly the boundary of the Senses--live    The Ideal life free Thought can give;      And, lo, the gulf shall vanish, and the chill    Of the soul's impotent despair be gone!    And with divinity thou sharest the throne,      Let but divinity become thy will!    Scorn not the Law--permit its iron band      The sense (it cannot chain the soul) to thrall.    Let man no more the will of Jove withstand,      And Jove the bolt lets fall!      XII      If, in the woes of Actual Human Life--    If thou could'st see the serpent strife      Which the Greek Art has made divine in stone--    Could'st see the writhing limbs, the livid cheek,    Note every pang, and hearken every shriek      Of some despairing lost Laocoon,    The human nature would thyself subdue      To share the human woe before thine eye--    Thy cheek would pale, and all thy soul be true      To Man's great Sympathy.      XIII      But in the Ideal Realm, aloof and far,    Where the calm Art's pure dwellers are,      Lo, the Laocoon writhes, but does not groan.    Here, no sharp grief the high emotion knows--    Here, suffering's self is made divine, and shows      The brave resolve of the firm soul alone:    Here, lovely as the rainbow on the dew      Of the spent thunder-cloud, to Art is given,    Gleaming through Grief's dark veil, the peaceful blue      Of the sweet Moral Heaven.      XIV      So, in the glorious parable, behold    How, bow'd to mortal bonds, of old      Life's dreary path divine Alcides trod:    The hydra and the lion were his prey,    And to restore the friend he loved today,      He went undaunted to the black-brow'd God;    And all the torments and the labors sore      Wroth Juno sent--the meek majestic One,    With patient spirit and unquailing, bore,      Until the course was run--      XV      Until the God cast down his garb of clay,    And rent in hallowing flame away      The mortal part from the divine--to soar    To the empyreal air! Behold him spring    Blithe in the pride of the unwonted wing,      And the dull matter that confined before    Sinks downward, downward, downward as a dream!      Olympian hymns receive the escaping soul,    And smiling Hebe, from the ambrosial stream,      Fills for a God the bowl!           *       *       *       *       *        GENIUS (1795)      Do I believe, thou ask'st, the Master's word,    The Schoolman's shibboleth that binds the herd?    To the soul's haven is there but one chart?    Its peace a problem to be learned by art?    On system rest the happy and the good?    To base the temple must the props be wood?    Must I distrust the gentle law, imprest,    To guide and warn, by Nature on the breast,    Till, squared to rule the instinct of the soul,--    Till the School's signet stamp the eternal scroll,    Till in one mold some dogma hath confined    The ebb and flow--the light waves--of the mind?    Say thou, familiar to these depths of gloom,    Thou, safe ascended from the dusty tomb,    Thou, who hast trod these weird Egyptian cells--    Say--if Life's comfort with yon mummies dwells!--    Say--and I grope--with saddened steps indeed--    But on, thro' darkness, if to Truth it lead!        Nay, Friend, thou know'st the golden time--the age    Whose legends live in many a poet's page?    When heavenlier shapes with Man walked side by side,    And the chaste Feeling was itself a guide;    Then the great law, alike divine amid    Suns bright in Heaven, or"]]]
