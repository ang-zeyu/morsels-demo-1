There will be the usual amount of specialized tastes, curiosity,          timidity, laziness, and rattle-brained thinking. The questioning          should probe these peculiarities, and stimulate the pupil's          ambition to improve his preparation at its weakest point.          Needless to say the questions should not be asked with the daily          idea of making the pupil fail. Like any other surgical          instrument the question probe should be used skillfully and with          a proper motive. It would be as great an error to bend your          questions continually away from the student's special tastes and          abilities as to be perpetually guided by them.         6. The bulk of the teacher's attention should be given neither to          the few exceptionally able students nor to the few very poor          pupils. It is to the average normal boy and girl that the most          of the questioning should be directed. The brilliant student          should be called on sufficiently to retain his interest and to          set a standard of excellence for the class. He should be given          the most difficult of the assignments of outside work and if          necessary an additional number of them. As to the few pupils          whom the teacher deems exceptionally poor, it may be said that          the effect of questioning should never be to discourage the          pupil who has made an honest effort at preparation. During the          early part of the course the efforts of the teacher may well be          directed to asking the backward student questions to which he          can make reasonably satisfactory answers. By saving the student          from the daily humiliation of failure before the class, and by          tactfully encouraging him to greater effort, the teacher may          shortly discover that the poor pupil is far from hopeless.         7. Do not allow your questions to consume a disproportionate amount          of time with details. Until very recently in all our history          teaching, battles have been exalted to a place immeasurably          greater than their importance. We are coming to see that the          fighting is one of the least important things in the war. The          causes and results, the financial, political, and social effects          now absorb our attention. One or two battles in a course may          profitably be studied in detail, particularly in the history of          our own country, but in the press of considerations far more          interesting and vital, it is a waste of time to give more than a          moment's notice to the remainder. Student descriptions of          battles are bound to be stereotyped. The ordinary textbook          describes each of the thousand battles of the world in about the          same fifty words.         8. Let some of the questions be directed towards cultivating the          student's powers of oral description. History is not altogether          a matter of analysis or generalization. There can scarcely be          assigned a lesson in history that does not contain events which          lend themselves to dramatic description. Their recital should be          made the occasion of the student's best efforts in this          direction. Let the pupils be taught to use adjectives and          adverbs. Break down the barrier of listlessness or fear or          self-consciousness which keeps the student from rendering a          graphic and thrilling account of great events.         9. Let the questions from day to day develop the continuity of          history. Avoid questioning that fails to unite the events of          previous lessons with the one being studied. Bring out the          connection of the past and the present. Slavery existed in          America for two hundred years before the Civil War was fought.          Your teaching of those two centuries of history should be so          conducted that when the Civil War is finally reached, the class          can tell the process by which anti-slavery sentiment was finally          crystallized. The hiatus between the mobbing of Garrison in          Boston and the extraordinary contribution of Massachusetts to          the Northern army should be bridged, not by a heroic question or          two when the war is finally reached, but by a daily attention to          the events which effected the metamorphosis.        10. If the answer to your question requires the use of a map, ask          it in such a way that the student can talk and use the map at          the same time. The geographical provisions of a treaty, the          routes of explorers, the grants of commercial companies,          campaigns, or military frontiers should all be recited in this          way. A wall map with simply the outline of the territory, with          its rivers, will be of considerable assistance in testing the          accuracy of the student's geographical knowledge. While          reciting, let him locate with chalk or pointer the cities,          arbitrary boundary lines, and routes he finds it necessary to          mention in his recitation. It will require special attention          early in the course to teach students the necessity for          preparation of this sort. Like everything else, map work should          be reasonable in its requirements. A knowledge of geography is          imperative to the correct understanding of history, and the          indifference or ignorance of teachers should never excuse          inattention to this vital necessity. On the other hand, however,          it is equally reprehensible to require of high school students          the labored preparation of maps in the drawing of which hours of          valuable time are spent in searching for places of trivial          importance and small historical value. Map work in a high school          history course should require no more than geographical accuracy          in locating boundaries, routes, and places really vital to the          history of the people being studied. If it does more than this          it usurps time disproportionate to its value.          V    VARIOUS MODES OF REVIEW      _The place of drill in the history recitation_    We have long since learned the folly of spending very many of the  minutes of a recitation in drilling students in dates, outlines, and  charts. Work of this sort never made a recitation vital; never inspired  a student with enthusiasm for historical inquiry; never really dispelled  the fog which surrounds, for the student, the cabinets and  constitutions, battles and boundaries, declarations and decrees, so  briefly treated in the text.      _Good reviews will develop a knowledge of the sequence of events_    But it may be seriously questioned whether many teachers, in their zeal  to escape the over-emphasis of dates, have not gone to the extreme of  neglecting them altogether. That a student should remember sufficient  dates to fix in his mind the sequence of important events is hardly open  to question. That he can never do so without some special attention to  dates is equally indisputable. Without doubt, drill in important dates  is necessary, but it should be so conducted as to take but little time.  Each day the teacher has indicated the dates worthy to be remembered and  has been careful to select the landmarks of history. He has called  attention to the various collateral circumstances which might assist to  fix the dates in the child's mind. The student has kept his list of  dates in the back of his text or in some convenient place of reference.  Once a week for three minutes the teacher gives the class a rapid review  on the dates contained in the list. Occasionally the class are sent to  the board and asked to write the dates of the reigns of the English  monarchs from William down to the point which the class has reached, or  the Presidents in their order, or some other similar exercise calculated  to give a backbone to the history being studied. The class will know  that such a review is liable to be given at any time. They will endeavor  to be prepared. The result will be that with the expenditure of a few  minutes at intervals in rapid review, history will cease to be a  spineless narrative and become for the student an orderly procession of  events. Drill in dates is only one method to this end. There may be a  rapid review in battles, generals, wars, treaties, proclamations, and  inventions. Such exercises encourage the classification of facts and  stimulate fluency of expression. It is of the highest importance for the  student so to arrange in his mind what he has learned in recitation that  he can call to his command at a second's notice the fact, date, or  illustration he desires. There will be many times in his school and  college career when such an ability will be indispensable; in business  or the professions it is an invaluable asset, infinitely more useful  than the history itself. It will be well for the teacher to inquire:  \"What am I doing to cultivate such an ability in my students?\"      _They will give a view of the whole subject_    Few teachers will deny that too little time is spent in giving the  student a general view of the whole subject, either in its entirety or  in its various phases. The text has been studied by chapters or by  months or by movements. The history as a whole has never been seen. By  the time the student has reached the \"Aldrich Currency Plan\" in American  history he has forgotten all about the experiments with the first United  States Bank. He could no more outline the financial history of the  United States as given in his text than he could outline the industrial  or political history of the American people. And yet he has studied the  facts given in his textbook; he has supplemented the text by his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14586"],[0,"The Brain, A Decoded Enigma (#6)"],[1,"level 2 is the highest level achieved by the animal brain. The evolution  of the brain continues with level 3.    We already saw that, at level 2, a label-type model activates a ZM model. The  next step is to activate not the whole model, but only some associated truth  of the ZM-model. In this way, the brain has to manage a reduced quantity of  information and so becomes more efficient.    This is a critical point, because it is the barrier to separate the animal  world of human world.    Thus, there is a ZM-model and an associated label-model. The problem is to  associate to the label-model only some truths generated by the associated ZM-  model. A ZM-model is an image model, and so its truths are also of image-type.  The problem is to record such truths in a different way, based on a totally  new function.    MDT cannot indicate how exactly this facility works. The theory is not  concerned with the technological implementation of the functions. The theory  just says that some truths generated by a ZM-model have to be recorded in a  different way. In this way, the label-models become words, and the associated  truths become symbolic definitions of the words.    On level 3 a label-type model can activate an associated ZM model, but it can  activate only a collection of truths as well, which are different from the  'ordinary' image-truths of the ZM.    It is possible that the General Communication Language (GCL) appeared based on  this facility. The presence of a GCL in a brain will characterize that brain  as a human brain.    Example: when the word \"dog\" is heard, it is very probable that we activate at  least one suitable ZM. But when we use the sentence \"I go to the forest with a  gun and a dog\", it is very probable that we do not activate any ZM-model. The  sentence is understood based on symbolic models and based on logic and so we  do not need any image-model. In this way, the quantity of information that has  to be processed by the brain is reduced very much. The image models will be  used only when we have to make a precise model of the action.    The human brain continues to evolve with level 4. On this level we have words  and associated symbolic definitions, but no ZM-image-model.    Example: Let's take the following words: \"this apple\", \"apple\", \"fruit\",  \"food\". \"This apple\" is associated with a pure image model. \"Apple\" is a  concept type image model. \"Fruit\" and \"food\" cannot be associated with any  image model (we cannot imagine what is fruit or what is food).    So, on level 4, the human brain can make and operate symbolic models without  any connection with image-models.    On this level it is possible to develop logical and mathematical languages  and, in this way, to make positive sciences associated to the external  reality.    Example: Newton's Mechanics is a symbolic model associated with the physical  bodies. The basic terms of this symbolic model are mass, space and time. None  of these terms can be associated with image models.    The evolution of the brain continues with level 4+, but I prefer to call it  level 5 (up to now it is the highest). This level was attained only 100 years  ago. On this level the symbolic models break totally with image models.    Example: Newton's Mechanics describes the movements of physical bodies. But we  can imagine such movements. Here Newton's symbolic model can be translated  also in image models.    The pure symbolic models cannot be translated in any image models. The only  symbolic model of this type is Quantum Mechanics.    Example: in association with Quantum Mechanics there is a \"classical\" problem  called \"the dual nature of light\". There are some experiments, which prove  that light is a wave. But there are also some other experiments, which prove  that light is made of particles. It seems that we have big logical problems  here. The aberration with \"the dual nature of light\" is supported also by some  great physicists (R. Feynman, for instance).    Physicists in Quantum Mechanics already solved the problem of the nature of  the light. The \"dual nature of light\" is not a problem of Physics, but a  problem of thinking.    The problem occurs when the physicists try to explain to us what happens. At  that moment, they use terms as \"wave\" or \"particle\" which are associated with  image models. The same terms, in Quantum Mechanics, are associated with  mathematical formulae. There is no connection between the world of Quantum  Mechanics and the world of image models. If someone forces such a connection,  then some big logical problems can occur.    As MDT says, any information is non-sense without declaring the model that  generated that information. In the above example, the nature of light is well  understood by physicists in the symbolic model called Quantum Mechanics. If we  don't know Quantum Mechanics, then it is not possible to understand the  answer. So, if we do not know Quantum Mechanics, then it is forbidden to ask  any question associated with that field.    Let's evaluate the world based on these levels. There is a fraction of the  population who is staying on level 2, and just occasionally goes on level 3.  The majority of the population is on level 3, and occasionally goes on level  4. There is a small fraction, which is on level 4, and occasionally on level  5. This fraction produces scientific and technological advance.    To understand the MDT theory, at least level 4 is necessary.        HUMAN BRAIN: EVOLUTION OR EXTERNAL INTERVENTION    Some activities of the human and animal beings are similar. So, there is an  idea that evolution from animal brain to human brain could be possible.    As we already emphasized, MDT is just a tool, which is used here to see if  there is any possibility to evolve from an animal brain to a human brain. The  theory does neither support, nor reject such a possibility.    Based on MDT, the main difference between a human brain and an animal brain is  the facility of the human brain only, to make and operate symbolic models. The  common part of the two types of brains is the facility to make and operate  image models.    The evolution problem is to see if there is any possibility to change some  parameters in the structure of image-model devices to reach the capability of  making and operating symbolic models. On the other hand, a new hardware that  should be added to the animal brain is considered as not compatible with an  evolutive process.    As we saw in the previous section, the highest level reached by the animal  brain is level 2. With a peak on level 5, the superiority of the human brain  is huge.    Let's see some arguments that support the evolutive process. For instance,  let's analyze whether by increasing the level of conceptualization of the  models, it will be possible to get closer to the ability to make and operate  symbolic models. Thus, if a class of models is more and more conceptualized,  such models should be so simplified that they could be very close to a  symbolic definition. Therefore, a change from level 2 to level 3 could be  reached by evolution.    But, let's analyze an example. So, we have \"this apple\", \"an apple\", \"a  fruit\", \"food\". This is an example of increasing level of conceptualization  with the last two items as symbolic elements. The animals have a shortcut by  making a model to tell them if what they meet is or not food. In this way, the  animals have a fast solution for problems based on image models. There is no  advantage to increase the level of conceptualization. Thus the evolution could  be blocked by a fast solution, based on image-models.    The advanced conceptualization should be supported in a group of vulnerable  animals. To survive, the communication could be decisive. By increasing the  level of conceptualization, the communication could be more and more precise.  This seems to be the only serious argument for increasing the level of  conceptualization. On the other hand, there is already a system of  communication on level 2. Thus, a sound or a combination of sounds is  associated with a label-type model. It can activate any ZM-model. This type of  communication is faster than that based on symbolic models and usually precise  enough for the normal necessities of a group of animals. Unfortunately, here  we did not see again any advantage from increasing the level of  conceptualization.    But, if, for a group of animals, there is a lot of information which comes in  fast succession, then the animals will be forced to make more and more  simplified models and this should force them to increase the level of  conceptualization.    Let's see another example. A person goes somewhere in the desert. Without  special equipment, his chance to survive should be very low. But, around him,  could be some animals which survive without special efforts. For animals, it  is more important \"to invest\" in \"equipment\" then to increase the level of  conceptualization of the models.    Anyways, at least in theory, it is possible to evolve from an animal brain to  a human brain based on an increase in the level of conceptualization. If the  animals have or not the tendency to do this, is another issue.    Let's analyze again the evolution of the brain. A concept model is a model  which fits a large number of entities. It has to be recorded, maybe, by the  same hardware as the hardware that records a normal image-model. Also, there  must be a connection between a concept model and every particular model  covered by it.    By increasing the level of conceptualization (e.g. from \"apple\" to \"fruit\")  the structure becomes very complex. The structure becomes even more complex  when it evolves from \"fruit\" to \"food\". In theory, an evolutive process could  produce this process but the increase of the complexity is so huge that it is  difficult to believe that this could be produced without specialized hardware.    Level 2 is very close to level 3, but, as we see, no"]]]
