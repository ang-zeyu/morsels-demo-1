[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13486"],[0,"The Story of Sigurd the Volsung (#6)"],[1,"Signy sent another son to the  wild-wood, and the lad was called Sinfiotli. Sigmund thrust him into  many dangers, and burdened him with heavy loads, and he bore all  passing well.    Now after a year Sigmund deemed that the time for his testing was  come, and once again he set an adder in the meal-sack and bade the  lad bake bread. And the boy feared not the worm, but kneaded it with  the dough and baked all together. So Sigmund cherished him as his own  son, and he grew strong and valiant and loved Sigmund as his father.    Now Sigmund began to ponder how he might at last take vengeance on  Siggeir, and gladly did Sinfiotli hear him, for all his love was  given to Sigmund, so that he no longer deemed himself the Goth-king's  son.    At last when the long mirk nights of winter were come, Sigmund and his  foster-son went their way to the home of Siggeir and sought to lurk  therein. Then Sinfiotli led the way to a storehouse where lay great  wine-casks, and whence they could see the lighted feast-hall, and  hear the clamour of Siggeir's folk. There they had to abide the time  when the feasters should be hushed in sleep. Long seemed the hours to  Sinfiotli, but Sigmund was calm and clear-eyed.    Then it befell that two of Queen Signy's youngest-born children threw  a golden toy hither and thither in the feast-hall, and at last it  rolled away among the wine-casks till it lay at Sigmund's feet. So the  children followed it, and coming face to face with those lurkers, they  fled back to the feast-hall. And Sigmund and his foster-son saw all  hope was ended, for they heard the rising tumult as men ran to their  weapons; so they made ready to go forth and die in the hall. Then on  came the battle around the twain, and but short is the tale to tell,  for Sinfiotli slipped on the blood-stained floor and the shield wall  encompassed Sigmund, and so they were both hoppled strait and fast.    The Goth-folk washed their hall of blood and got them to slumber, but  Siggeir lay long pondering what dire death he might bring on his foes.    Now at the first grey dawning Siggeir's folk dight a pit and it had  two chambers with a sundering stone in the midst. Then they brought  the Volsung kindred and set them therein, one in each chamber, that  they might abide death alone, and yet in hearing of one another's woe.  And over the top the thralls laid roofing turfs, but so lingering were  their hands that eve drew on ere the task was finished. Then stole  Signy forth in the dusk, and spake the thralls fair, and gave them  gold that they might hold their peace of what she did. And when they  gainsaid her nought she drew out something wrapped in wheat straw, and  cast it down swiftly into the pit where Sinfiotli lay, and departed.    Sinfiotli at first deemed it food, but after a space Sigmund heard him  laugh aloud for joy, for within the wrappings lay the sword of the  Branstock. And Sinfiotli cried out the joyous tidings to his  foster-father, and tarried not to set the point to the stone that  sundered them, and lo, the blade pierced through, and Sigmund grasped  the point. Then sawed Sigmund and Sinfiotli together till they cleft  the stone, and they hewed full hard at the roofing, till they cast the  turfs aside, and their hearts were gladdened with the sight of the  starry heaven.    Forth they leapt, and no words were needed of whither they should  wend, but they fell on King Siggeir's night-watch and slew them  sleeping, and made haste to find the store of winter faggots,  wherewith they built a mighty bale about the hall of Siggeir. They  set a torch to the bale, and Sigmund gat him to one hall door and  Sinfiotli to the other, and now the Goth-folk awoke to their last  of days.    Then cried Siggeir to his thralls and offered them joyous life-days  and plenteous wealth if they would give him life, deeming that they  had fired the hall in hatred. But there came a great voice crying  from the door, \"Nay, no toilers are we; wealth is ours when we list,  but now our hearts are set to avenge our kin; now hath the murder  seed sprung and borne its fruit; now the death-doomed and buried work  this deed; now doom draweth nigh thee at the hand of Sigmund the  Volsung, and Sinfiotli, Signy's son.\"    Then the voice cried again, \"Come ye forth, women of the Goths, and  thou, O Signy, my sister, come forth to seek the boughs of the  Branstock.\" So fled the white-faced women from the fire, and passed  scatheless by Sinfiotli's blade, but Signy came not at all. Then the  earls of Siggeir strove to burst from the hall, but ever the two  glaives at the doorways drove them back to the fire.    And, lo, now came Signy in queenly raiment, and stood before Sinfiotli  and said, \"O mightiest son, this is the hour of our parting, and fain  am I of slumber and the end of my toil now I have seen this day. And  the blither do I leave thee because thy days on earth shall be but  few; I charge thee make thy life glorious, and leave a goodly tale.\"    She kissed him and turned to Sigmund, and her face in the dawn-light  seemed to him fair and ruddy as in the days when they twain dwelt by  the Branstock. And she said, \"My youth was happy, yet this hour is  the crown of my life-days which draw nigh their ending. And now I  charge thee, Sigmund, when thou sittest once more a mighty king  beneath the boughs of the Branstock, that thou remember how I loved  the Volsung name, and spared not to spend all that was mine for its  blossoming.\" Then she kissed him and turned again, and the dawn  brightened at her back, and the fire shone red before her, and so for  the last time was Signy beheld by the eyes of men. Thereafter King  Siggeir's roof-tree bowed earthward, and the mighty walls crashed  down, and so that dark murder-hall lay wasted, and its glory was  swept away.      _How Sigmund cometh to the Land of the Volsungs again, and of the  death of Sinfiotli his Son._      Now Sigmund the king bestirs him, and Sinfiotli, Sigmund's son,    And they gather a host together, and many a mighty one;    Then they set the ships in the sea-flood and sail from the stranger's shore,    And the beaks of the golden dragons see the Volsungs' land once more;    And men's hearts are fulfilled of joyance; and they cry, The sun shines now    With never a curse to hide it, and they shall reap that sow!    Then for many a day sits Sigmund 'neath the boughs of the Branstock green,    With his earls and lords about him as the Volsung wont hath been.    And oft he thinketh on Signy and oft he nameth her name,    And tells how she spent her joyance and her life-days and her fame    That the Volsung kin might blossom and bear the fruit of worth    For the hope of unborn people and the harvest of the earth.    And again he thinks of the word that he spake that other day,    How he should abide there lonely when his kin was passed away,    Their glory and sole avenger, their after-summer seed.    But far and wide went Sinfiotli through the earth, mowing the war  swathe and wasting the land, and passing but little time in song and  laughter in his father's hall. So went his days in warfare and valour,  and yet his end was not glorious, for he drank of the poisoned cup  given him by the sister of a warrior he had rightly slain.    None might come nigh Sigmund in his anguish as he lifted the head of  his fallen foster-child, and then swiftly bare him from the hall. On  he went through dark thicket and over wind-swept heath, past the  foot-hills and the homes of the deer, till he came to a great rushing  water, whereon was a white-sailed boat, manned by a mighty man,  \"one-eyed and seeming ancient.\" This mighty one told Sigmund he had  been bidden to waft a great king over the water, and bade him lay his  burden on board, but when Sigmund would have followed he could see  neither ship nor man.    But Sigmund went back to his throne, and behaved himself as a king,  listening to his people's plaints, and dealing out justice.      _Of the last battle of King Sigmund, and the death of him._      Now there was a king of the Islands, whom the tale doth Eylimi call,    And saith he was wise and valiant, though his kingdom were but small:    He had one only daughter that Hiordis had to name,    A woman wise and shapely beyond the praise of fame.    And now saith the son of King Volsung that his time is short enow    To labour the Volsung garden, and the hand must be set to the plough:    So he sendeth an earl of the people to King Eylimi's high-built hall,    Bearing the gifts and the tokens, and this word in his mouth withal:      \"King Sigmund the son of Volsung hath sent me here with a word    That plenteous good of thy daughter among all folk he hath heard,    And he wooeth that wisest of women that she may sit on his throne.           *       *       *       *       *      \"Now hereof would he have an answer within a half-month's space,    And these gifts meanwhile he giveth for the increase of thy grace.\"      So King Eylimi hearkened the message, and hath no word to say,    For an earl of King Lyngi the mighty is come that very day,    He too for the wooing of Hiordis: and Lyngi's realm is at hand,    But afar King Sigmund abideth o'er many a sea and land:    And the man is young and eager, and grim and guileful of mood.      At last he sayeth: \"Abide here such space as thou deemest good,    But tomorn shalt thou have thine answer that thine heart may the lighter be,    For the hearkening of harp and songcraft, and the dealing with game and         glee.\"    Then he went to Queen Hiordis' bower, where she worked in the silk and the         gold    The deeds of the world that should be, and the deeds that were of old.    And he stood before her and said:    \"Often have I told thee that thou shouldst wed only the man thou  wouldst. Now it hath come to pass that two kings desire thee.\"    And she swiftly rose to her feet as she said, \"And which be they?\"      He spake: \"The first is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13487"],[0,"The Ideal Bartender (#6)"],[1,"Whiskey glass.    1 jigger Scotch Whiskey.
