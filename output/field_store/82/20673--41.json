Finally, among another allied primitive people, the Australians, it would  appear that homosexuality has long been well established in tribal  customs. Among the natives of Kimberley, Western Australia (who are by no  means of low type, quick and intelligent, with special aptitudes for  learning languages and music), if a wife is not obtainable for a young man  he is presented with a boy-wife between the ages of 5 and 10 (the age when  a boy receives his masculine initiation). The exact nature of the  relations between the boy-wife and his protector are doubtful; they  certainly have connection, but the natives repudiate with horror and  disgust the idea of sodomy.[40]    Further light is thrown on homosexuality in Australia by the supposition  of Spencer and Gillen that the _mika_ operation (urethral subincision), an  artificial hypospadias, is for the purpose of homosexual intercourse.  Klaatsch has discussed the homosexual origin of the _mika_ operation on  the basis of information he received from missionaries at Niol-Niol, on  the northwest coast. The subincised man acts as a female to the as yet  unoperated boys, who perform coitus in the incised opening. Both informed  Klaatsch in 1906 that at Boulia in Queensland the operated men are said to  \"possess a vulva.\"[41]    These various accounts are of considerable interest, though for the most  part their precise significance remains doubtful. Some of them,  however,--such as Holder's description of the _bote_, Baumann's account of  homosexual phenomena in Zanzibar, and especially Seligmann's observations  in British New Guinea,--indicate not only the presence of esthetic  inversion but of true congenital sexual inversion. The extent of the  evidence will doubtless be greatly enlarged as the number of competent  observers increases, and crucial points are no longer so frequently  overlooked.    On the whole, the evidence shows that among lower races homosexual  practices are regarded with considerable indifference, and the real  invert, if he exists among them, as doubtless he does exist, generally  passes unperceived or joins some sacred caste which sanctifies his  exclusively homosexual inclinations.    Even in Europe today a considerable lack of repugnance to homosexual  practices may be found among the lower classes. In this matter, as  folklore shows in so many other matters, the uncultured man of  civilization is linked to the savage. In England, I am told, the soldier  often has little or no objection to prostitute himself to the \"swell\" who  pays him, although for pleasure he prefers to go to women; and Hyde Park  is spoken of as a center of male prostitution.        \"Among the working masses of England and Scotland,\" Q. writes,      \"'comradeship' is well marked, though not (as in Italy) very      conscious of itself. Friends often kiss each other, though this      habit seems to vary a good deal in different sections and      coteries. Men commonly sleep together, whether comrades or not,      and so easily get familiar. Occasionally, but not so very often,      this relation delays for a time, or even indefinitely, actual      marriage, and in some instances is highly passionate and      romantic. There is a good deal of grossness, no doubt, here and      there in this direction among the masses; but there are no male      prostitutes (that I am aware of) whose regular clients are manual      workers. This kind of prostitution in London is common enough,      but I have only a slight personal knowledge of it. Many youths      are 'kept' handsomely in apartments by wealthy men, and they are,      of course, not always inaccessible to others. Many keep      themselves in lodgings by this means, and others eke out scanty      wages by the same device: just like women, in fact. Choirboys      reinforce the ranks to a considerable extent, and private      soldiers to a large extent. Some of the barracks (notably      Knightsbridge) are great centres. On summer evenings Hyde Park      and the neighborhood of Albert Gate is full of guardsmen and      others plying a lively trade, and with little disguise, in      uniform or out. In these cases it sometimes only amounts to a      chat on a retired seat or a drink at a bar; sometimes recourse is      had to a room in some known lodging-house, or to one or two      hotels which lend themselves to this kind of business. In any      case it means a covetable addition to Tommy Atkins's      pocket-money.\" And Mr. Raffalovich, speaking of London, remarks:      \"The number of soldiers who prostitute themselves is greater than      we are willing to believe. It is no exaggeration to say that in      certain regiments the presumption is in favor of the venality of      the majority of the men.\" It is worth noting that there is a      perfect understanding in this matter between soldiers and the      police, who may always be relied upon by the former for      assistance and advice. I am indebted to my correspondent \"Z\" for      the following notes: \"Soldiers are no less sought after in France      than in England or in Germany, and special houses exist for      military prostitution both in Paris and the garrison-towns. Many      facts known about the French army go to prove that these habits      have been contracted in Algeria, and have spread to a formidable      extent through whole regiments. The facts related by Ulrichs      about the French foreign legion, on the testimony of a credible      witness who had been a pathic in his regiment, deserve attention      (_Ara Spei_, p. 20; _Memnon_, p. 27). This man, who was a German,      told Ulrichs that the Spanish, French, and Italian soldiers were      the lovers, the Swiss and German their beloved (see also General      Brossier's Report, quoted by Burton, _Arabian Nights_, vol. x, p.      251). In Lucien Descaves's military novel, _Sous Offs_ (Paris,      Tresse et Stock, 1890), some details are given regarding      establishments for male prostitution. See pages 322, 412, and 417      for description of the drinking-shop called 'Aux Amis de      l'Armee,' where a few maids were kept for show, and also of its      frequenters, including, in particular, the Adjutant Laprevotte.      Ulrichs reports that in the Austrian army lectures on homosexual      vices are regularly given to cadets and conscripts (_Memnon_, p.      26). A soldier who had left the army told a friend of mine that      he and many of his comrades had taken to homosexual indulgences      when abroad on foreign service in a lonely station. He kept the      practice up in England 'because the women of his class were so      unattractive.' The captain of an English man-of-war said that he      was always glad to send his men on shore after a long cruise at      sea, never feeling sure how far they might not all go if left      without women for a certain space of time.\" I may add that A.      Hamon (_La France Sociale et Politique_, 1891, pp. 653-55; also      in his _Psychologie du Militaire Professional_, chapter x) gives      details as to the prevalence of homosexuality in the French army,      especially in Algeria; he regards it as extremely common,      although the majority are free. A fragment of a letter by General      Lamoriciere (speaking of Marshal Changarnier) is quoted: _En      Afrique nous en etions tous, mais lui en est reste ici_.    This primitive indifference is doubtless also a factor in the prevalence  of homosexuality among criminals, although, here, it must be remembered,  two other factors (congenital abnormality and the isolation of  imprisonment) have to be considered. In Russia, Tarnowsky observes that  all pederasts are agreed that the common people are tolerably indifferent  to their sexual advances, which they call \"gentlemen's games.\" A  correspondent remarks on \"the fact, patent to all observers, that simple  folk not infrequently display no greater disgust for the abnormalities of  sexual appetite than they do for its normal manifestations.\"[42] He knows  of many cases in which men of lower class were flattered and pleased by  the attentions of men of higher class, although not themselves inverted.  And from this point of view the following case, which he mentions, is very  instructive:--        A pervert whom I can trust told me that he had made advances to      upward of one hundred men in the course of the last fourteen      years, and that he had only once met with a refusal (in which      case the man later on offered himself spontaneously) and only      once with an attempt to extort money. Permanent relations of      friendship sprang up in most instances. He admitted that he      looked after these persons and helped them with his social      influence and a certain amount of pecuniary support--setting one      up in business, giving another something to marry on, and finding      places for others.    Among the peasantry in Switzerland, I am informed, homosexual  relationships are not uncommon before marriage, and such relationships are  lightly spoken of as \"Dummheiten\". No doubt, similar traits might be found  in the peasantry of other parts of Europe.    What may be regarded as true sexual inversion can be traced"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13612"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 3 (#6)"],[1,"der Medicin_, 1900, vol. cclxvii; also _Ausgewahlte      Werke_, vol. vii.)    It will be seen that the question of the nature of the sexual impulse has  been slowly transformed. It is no longer a question of the formation of  semen in the male, of the function of menstruation in the female. It has  become largely a question of physiological chemistry. The chief parts in  the drama of sex, alike on its psychic as on its physical sides, are thus  supposed to be played by two mysterious protagonists, the hormones, or  internal secretions, of the testes and of the ovary. Even the part played  by the brain is now often regarded as chemical, the brain being considered  to be a great chemical laboratory. There is a tendency, moreover, to  extend the sexual sphere so as to admit the influence of internal  secretions from other glands. The thymus, the adrenals, the thyroid, the  pituitary, even the kidneys: it is possible that internal secretions from  all these glands may combine to fill in the complete picture of sexuality  as we know it in men and women.[16] The subject is, however, so complex  and at present so little known that it would be hazardous, and for the  present purpose it is needless, to attempt to set forth any conclusions.    It is sufficiently clear that there is on the surface a striking analogy  between sexual desire and the impulse to evacuate an excretion, and that  this analogy is not only seen in the frog, but extends also to the highest  vertebrates. It is quite another matter, however, to assert that the  sexual impulse can be adequately defined as an impulse to evacuate. To  show fully the inadequate nature of this conception would require a  detailed consideration of the facts of sexual life. That is, however,  unnecessary. It is enough to point out certain considerations which alone  suffice to invalidate this view. In the first place, it must be remarked  that the trifling amount of fluid emitted in sexual intercourse is  altogether out of proportion to the emotions aroused by the act and to its  after-effect on the organism; the ancient dictum _omne animal post coitum  triste_ may not be exact, but it is certain that the effect of coitus on  the organism is far more profound than that produced by the far more  extensive evacuation of the bladder or bowels. Again, this definition  leaves unexplained all those elaborate preliminaries which, both in man  and the lower animals, precede the sexual act, preliminaries which in  civilized human beings sometimes themselves constitute a partial  satisfaction to the sexual impulse. It must also be observed that, unlike  the ordinary excretions, this discharge of the sexual glands is not  always, or in every person, necessary at all. Moreover, the theory of  evacuation at once becomes hopelessly inadequate when we apply it to  women; no one will venture to claim that an adequate psychological  explanation of the sexual impulse in a woman is to be found in the desire  to expel a little bland mucus from the minute glands of the genital tract.  We must undoubtedly reject this view of the sexual impulse. It has a  certain element of truth and it permits an instructive and helpful  analogy; but that is all. The sexual act presents many characters which  are absent in an ordinary act of evacuation, and, on the other hand, it  lacks the special characteristic of the evacuation proper, the  elimination of waste material; the seminal fluid is not a waste material,  and its retention is, to some extent perhaps, rather an advantage than a  disadvantage to the organism.    Eduard von Hartmann long since remarked that the satisfaction of what we  call the sexual instinct through an act carried out with a person of the  opposite sex is a very wonderful phenomenon. It cannot be said, however,  that the conception of the sexual act as a simple process of evacuation  does anything to explain the wonder. We are, at most, in the same position  as regards the stilling of normal sexual desire as we should be as regards  the emptying of the bladder, supposing it were very difficult for either  sex to effect this satisfactorily without the aid of a portion of the body  of a person of the other sex acting as a catheter. In such a case our  thoughts and ideals would center around persons of opposite sex, and we  should court their attention and help precisely as we do now in the case  of our sexual needs. Some such relationship does actually exist in the  case of the suckling mother and her infant. The mother is indebted to the  child for the pleasurable relief of her distended breasts; and, while in  civilization more subtle pleasures and intelligent reflection render this  massive physical satisfaction comparatively unessential to the act of  suckling, in more primitive conditions and among animals the need of this  pleasurable physical satisfaction is a real bond between the mother and  her offspring. The analogy is indeed very close: the erectile nipple  corresponds to the erectile penis, the eager watery mouth of the infant to  the moist and throbbing vagina, the vitally albuminous milk to the vitally  albuminous semen.[17] The complete mutual satisfaction, physical and  psychic, of mother and child, in the transfer from one to the other of a  precious organized fluid, is the one true physiological analogy to the  relationship of a man and a woman at the climax of the sexual act. Even  this close analogy, however, fails to cover all the facts of the sexual  life.    A very different view is presented to us in the definition of the sexual  instinct as a reproductive impulse, a desire for offspring. Hegar,  Eulenburg, Naecke, and Loewenfeld have accepted this as, at all events, a  partial definition.[18] No one, indeed, would argue that it is a complete  definition, although a few writers appear to have asserted that it is so  sometimes as regards the sexual impulse in women. There is, however,  considerable mental confusion in the attempt to set up such a definition.  If we define an instinct as an action adapted to an end which is not  present to consciousness, then it is quite true that the sexual instinct  is an instinct of reproduction. But we do not adequately define the sexual  instinct by merely stating its ultimate object. We might as well say that  the impulse by which young animals seize food is \"an instinct of  nutrition.\" The object of reproduction certainly constitutes no part of  the sexual impulse whatever in any animal apart from man, and it reveals a  lack of the most elementary sense of biological continuity to assert that  in man so fundamental and involuntary a process can suddenly be  revolutionized. That the sexual impulse is very often associated with a  strong desire for offspring there can be no doubt, and in women the  longing for a child--that is to say, the longing to fulfill those  functions for which their bodies are constituted--may become so urgent and  imperative that we may regard it as scarcely less imperative than the  sexual impulse. But it is not the sexual impulse, though intimately  associated with it, and though it explains it. A reproductive instinct  might be found in parthenogenetic animals, but would be meaningless,  because useless, in organisms propagating by sexual union. A woman may not  want a lover, but may yet want a child. This merely means that her  maternal instincts have been aroused, while her sexual instincts are still  latent. A desire for reproduction, as soon as that desire becomes  instinctive, necessarily takes on the form of the sexual impulse, for  there is no other instinctive mechanism by which it can possibly express  itself. A \"reproductive instinct,\" apart from the sexual instinct and  apart from the maternal instinct, cannot be admitted; it would be an  absurdity. Even in women in whom the maternal instincts are strong, it may  generally be observed that, although before a woman is in love, and also  during the later stages of her love, the conscious desire for a child may  be strong, during the time when sexual passion is at its highest the  thought of offspring, under normally happy conditions, tends to recede  into the background. Reproduction is the natural end and object of the  sexual instinct, but the statement that it is part of the contents of the  sexual impulse, or can in any way be used to define that impulse, must be  dismissed as altogether inacceptable. Indeed, although the term  \"reproductive instinct\" is frequently used, it is seldom used in a sense  that we need take seriously; it is vaguely employed as a euphemism by  those who wish to veil the facts of the sexual life; it is more precisely  employed mainly by those who are unconsciously dominated by a  superstitious repugnance to sex.    I now turn to a very much more serious and elaborate attempt to define the  constitution of the sexual impulse, that of Moll. He finds that it is made  up of two separate components, each of which may be looked upon as an  uncontrollable impulse.[19] One of these is that by which the tension of  the sexual organs is spasmodically relieved; this he calls the _impulse of  detumescence_,[20] and he regards it as primary, resembling the impulse to  empty a full bladder. The other impulse is the \"instinct to approach,  touch, and kiss another person, usually of the opposite sex\"; this he  terms the _impulse of contrectation_, and he includes under this head not  only the tendency to general physical contact, but also the psychic  inclination to become generally interested in a person of the opposite  sex. Each of these primary impulses Moll regards as forming a constituent  of the sexual instinct in both men and women. It seems to me undoubtedly  true that these two impulses do correspond to the essential phenomena. The  awkward and unsatisfactory part of Moll's analysis is the relation of the  one to the other. It is true that he traces both impulses back to the  sexual glands, that of"]]]
