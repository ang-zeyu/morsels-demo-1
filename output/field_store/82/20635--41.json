Torres was second in command to Pedro Fernandez de Quiros; when he sailed  with three vessels, from the port of Callao in Peru, in the year 1605.  One of the purposes of their expedition was to search for the TIERRA  AUSTRAL; a continent which was supposed to occupy a considerable portion  of that part of the southern hemisphere lying westward of America.    After the discovery of several islands, Quiros came to a land which he  named AUSTRALIA DEL ESPIRITU SANTO, supposing it to be a part of the  great Southern Continent; but this, on his separation from the admiral,  Torres found could be no other than an island; and then continued his  course westward, in prosecution of the research.    About the month of August 1606, and in latitude 111/2 deg. south, he fell in  with a coast, which he calls \"the beginning of New Guinea;\" and which  appears to have been the south-eastern part of the land, afterwards named  Louisiade, by Mons. DE BOUGAINVILLE, and now known to be a chain of  islands. Unable to pass to windward of this land, Torres bore away along  its south side; and gives, himself, the following account of his  subsequent proceedings.    \"We went along 300 leagues of coast, as I have mentioned, and diminished  the latitude 21/2 deg., which brought us into 9 deg.. From hence we fell in with a  bank of from 3 to 9 fathoms, which extends along the coast above 180  leagues. We went over it along the coast to 71/2 S. latitude, and the end  of it is in 5 deg.. We could not go further on for the many shoals and great  currents, so we were obliged to sail S. W. in that depth to 11 deg.. S.  latitude. There is all over it an archipelago of islands without number,  by which we passed, and at the end of the 11th degree, the bank became  shoaler. Here were very large islands, and there appeared more to the  southward: they were inhabited by black people, very corpulent, and  naked: their arms were lances, arrows, and clubs of stone ill fashioned.  We could not get any of their arms. We caught in all this land 20 persons  of different nations, that with them we might be able to give a better  account to Your Majesty. They give much notice of other people, although  as yet they do not make themselves well understood.    \"We were upon this bank two months, at the end of which time we found  ourselves in 25 fathoms, and in 5 deg. S. latitude, and 10 leagues from the  coast. And having gone 480 leagues, here the coast goes to the N. E. I  did not reach it, for the bank became very shallow. So we stood to the  north.\" *    [* See the letter of Torres, dated Manila, July 12, 1607, in Vol. II.  Appendix, No I. to Burney's \"_History of Discoveries in the South Sea_;\"  from which interesting work this sketch of Torres' voyage is extracted.]    It cannot be doubted, that the \"very large islands\" seen by Torres, at  the 11th degree of south latitude, were the hills of Cape York; or that  his _two months_ of intricate navigation were employed in passing the  strait which divides Terra Australis and New Guinea. But the account of  this and other discoveries, which Torres himself addressed to the King of  Spain, was so kept from the world, that the existence of such a strait  was generally unknown, until 1770; when it was again discovered and  passed by our great circumnavigator Captain Cook.    Torres, it should appear, took the precaution to lodge a copy of his  letter in the archives of Manila; for, after that city was taken by the  British forces, in 1762, Mr. Dalrymple found out, and drew from oblivion,  this interesting document of early discovery; and, as a tribute due to  the enterprising Spanish navigator, he named the passage TORRES' STRAIT;  and the appellation now generally prevails.    ZEACHEN. 1618.    ZEACHEN is said to have discovered the land of Arnhem and the northern  Van Diemen's Land, in 1618; and he is supposed, from the first name, to  have been a native of Arnhem, in Holland; and that the second was given  in honour of the governor-general of the Indies.* But there are two  important objections to the truth of this vague account: first, no  mention is made of Zeachen in the recital of discoveries which preface  the instructions to Tasman; nor is there any, of the North Coast having  been visited by the Dutch, in that year: secondly, it appears from  _Valentyn's_ lives of the governors of Batavia, that Van Diemen was not  governor-general until January 1, 1636.    [* _Hist. des Navigations aux Terres Aust._ Tome 1. p. 432.]    CARSTENS. 1623.    The second expedition, mentioned in the Dutch recital, for the discovery  of the Great South Land, \"was undertaken in a yacht, in the year 1617,  with little success;\" and the journals and remarks were not to be found.  In January 1623, the yachts _Pera_ and _Arnhem_, under the command of JAN  CARSTENS, were despatched from _Amboina_, by order of His Excellency Jan  Pieterz Coen. Carstens, with eight of the Arnhem's crew, was  treacherously murdered by the natives of New Guinea; but the vessels  prosecuted the voyage, and _discovered_ \"the great islands ARNHEM and the  SPULT.\" * They were then \"untimely separated,\" and the Arnhem returned to  Amboina. The Pera persisted; and \"sailed along the south coast of New  Guinea, to a flat cove, situate in 10 deg. south latitude; and ran along the  West Coast of this land to Cape Keer-Weer; from thence discovered the  coast further southward, as far as 17 deg., to STATEN RIVER. From this place,  what more of the land could be discerned, seemed to stretch _westward_:\"  the Pera then returned to Amboina. \"In this discovery were found, every  where, shallow water and barren coasts; islands altogether thinly peopled  by divers cruel, poor, and brutal nations; and of very little use to the  (Dutch East-India) Company.\"    [* In the old charts, a river Spult is marked, in the western part of  Arnhem's Land; and it seems probable, that the land in its vicinity is  here meant by THE SPULT.]    POOL. PIETERSEN. 1636.    GERRIT TOMAZ POOL was sent, in April 1636, from _Banda_, with the yachts  _Klyn Amsterdam_ and _Wezel_, upon the same expedition as Carstens; and,  at the same place, on the coast of New Guinea, he met with the same fate.  Nevertheless \"the voyage was assiduously continued under the charge of  the supra-cargo Pieterz Pietersen; and the islands _Key_ and _Arouw_  visited. By reason of very strong eastwardly winds, they could not reach  the west coast of New Guinea (Carpentaria); but shaping their course very  near south, discovered the coast of Arnhem, or Van Diemen's Land, in 11 deg.  south latitude; and sailed along the shore for 120 miles (30 mijlen),  without seeing any people, _but many signs of smoke_.\"    TASMAN. 1644.    This is all that appears to have been known of the North Coast, when ABEL  JANSZ TASMAN sailed upon his second voyage, in 1644; for the instructions  to him say, that after quitting \"Point Ture, or False Cape, situate in 8 deg.  on the south coast of New Guinea, you are to continue eastward, along the  coast, to 9 deg. south latitude; crossing prudently the _Cove_ at that place.  Looking about the _high islands_ or _Speult's River_, with the yachts,  for a harbour; despatching the tender _De Braak_, for two or three days  into the Cove, in order to discover whether, within the GREAT INLET,  there be not to be found an entrance into the South Sea.* From this place  you are to coast along the west coast of New Guinea. (Carpentaria,) to  the furthest discoveries in 17 deg. south latitude; following the coast  further, as it may run, west or southward.\"    [* The Great Inlet or Cove, where the passage was to be sought, is the  north-west part of Torres' Strait. It is evident, that a suspicion was  entertained, in 1644, of such a strait; but that the Dutch were ignorant  of its having been passed. The \"high islands\" are those which lie in  latitude 10 deg., on the west side of the strait. Speult's River appears to  be the opening betwixt the Prince of Wales' Islands and Cape York;  through which captain Cook afterwards passed, and named it Endeavour's  Strait. This _Speult's River_ cannot, I conceive, be the same with what  was before mentioned under the name of THE SPULT.]    \"But it is to be feared you will meet, in these parts, with the  south-east trade winds; from which it will be difficult to keep the coast  on board, if stretching to the south-east; but, notwithstanding this,  endeavour by all means to proceed; that we may be sure whether this land  is divided from the _Great Known_ SOUTH CONTINENT, or not.\"    The Dutch had, by this time, acquired some knowledge of a part of the  south coast of Terra Australis; of the west coast; and of a part of the  north-west; and these are the lands meant by \"the Great Known South  Continent.\" Arnhem's, and the northern Van Diemen's Lands, on the North  Coast, are not included in the expression; for Tasman was directed \"from  _De Witt's Land_ (on the North-west Coast,) to run across, very near  eastward, to complete the discovery of _Arnhem's_ and _Van Diemen's  Lands_; and to ascertain perfectly, whether these lands are not _one and  the same island_.\"    It is a great obstacle to tracing correctly the progress of early  discovery in Terra Australis, that no account of this voyage of Tasman  has ever been published; nor is any such known to exist. But it seems to  have been the general opinion, that he sailed round the _Gulph of  Carpentaria_; and then westward, along _Arnhem's_ and the northern _Van  Diemen's Lands_; and the form of these coasts in Thevenot's chart of  1663, and in those of most succeeding geographers, even up to the end of  the eighteenth century, is supposed to have resulted from this voyage.  The opinion is strengthened by finding the names of Tasman, and of the  governor-general and two of the council, who signed his instructions,  applied to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12956"],[0,"A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume 1 (#6)"],[1," countries.  My own view with regard to the net value of Indian philosophical  development will be expressed in the concluding chapter of the second  volume of the present work.    10          CHAPTER II      THE VEDAS, BRAHMANAS AND THEIR PHILOSOPHY    The Vedas and their antiquity.    The sacred books of India, the Vedas, are generally believed to be the  earliest literary record of the Indo-European race. It is indeed  difficult to say when the earliest portions of these compositions came  into existence. Many shrewd guesses have been offered, but none of them  can be proved to be incontestably true. Max Mueller supposed the date to  be 1200 B.C., Haug 2400 B.C. and Bal Ga@ngadhar Tilak 4000 B.C. The  ancient Hindus seldom kept any historical record of their literary,  religious or political achievements. The Vedas were handed down from  mouth to mouth from a period of unknown antiquity; and the Hindus  generally believed that they were never composed by men. It was  therefore generally supposed that either they were taught by God to the  sages, or that they were of themselves revealed to the sages who were the  \"seers\" (_mantradra@s@ta_) of the hymns. Thus we find that when some  time had elapsed after the composition of the Vedas, people had come to  look upon them not only as very old, but so old that they had,  theoretically at least, no beginning in time, though they were believed  to have been revealed at some unknown remote period at the beginning of  each creation.      The place of the Vedas in the Hindu mind.    When the Vedas were composed, there was probably no system of writing  prevalent in India. But such was the scrupulous zeal of the Brahmins,  who got the whole Vedic literature by heart by hearing it from their  preceptors, that it has been transmitted most faithfully to us through  the course of the last 3000 years or more with little or no interpolations  at all. The religious history of India had suffered considerable changes  in the latter periods, since the time of the Vedic civilization, but such  was the reverence paid to the Vedas that they had ever remained as  the highest religious authority for all sections of the Hindus at  all times. Even at this day all the obligatory duties of the Hindus  at birth, marriage, death, etc., are performed according to the old    11    Vedic ritual. The prayers that a Brahmin now says three times a day  are the same selections of Vedic verses as were used as prayer verses  two or three thousand years ago. A little insight into the life of an  ordinary Hindu of the present day will show that the system of  image-worship is one that has been grafted upon his life, the regular  obligatory duties of which are ordered according to the old Vedic rites.  Thus an orthodox Brahmin can dispense with image-worship if he likes,  but not so with his daily Vedic prayers or other obligatory ceremonies.  Even at this day there are persons who bestow immense sums of money  for the performance and teaching of Vedic sacrifices and rituals.  Most of the Sanskrit literatures that flourished after the Vedas  base upon them their own validity, and appeal to them as authority.  Systems of Hindu philosophy not only own their allegiance to the Vedas,  but the adherents of each one of them would often quarrel with others  and maintain its superiority by trying to prove that it and it alone  was the faithful follower of the Vedas and represented correctly their  views. The laws which regulate the social, legal, domestic and religious  customs and rites of the Hindus even to the present day are said to be  but mere systematized memories of old Vedic teachings, and are held to  be obligatory on their authority. Even under British administration, in  the inheritance of property, adoption, and in such other legal  transactions, Hindu Law is followed, and this claims to draw its authority  from the Vedas. To enter into details is unnecessary. But suffice it to  say that the Vedas, far from being regarded as a dead literature of the  past, are still looked upon as the origin and source of almost all  literatures except purely secular poetry and drama. Thus in short we may  say that in spite of the many changes that time has wrought, the orthodox  Hindu life may still be regarded in the main as an adumbration of the  Vedic life, which had never ceased to shed its light all through the past.      Classification of the Vedic literature.    A beginner who is introduced for the first time to the study  of later Sanskrit literature is likely to appear somewhat confused  when he meets with authoritative texts of diverse purport and  subjects having the same generic name \"Veda\" or \"S'ruti\" (from  _s'ru_ to hear); for Veda in its wider sense is not the name of any    12    particular book, but of the literature of a particular epoch extending  over a long period, say two thousand years or so. As this literature  represents the total achievements of the Indian people in different  directions for such a long period, it must of necessity be of a  diversified character. If we roughly classify this huge literature from  the points of view of age, language, and subject matter, we can point out  four different types, namely the Sa@mhita or collection of verses (_sam_  together, _hita_ put), Brahma@nas, Ara@nyakas (\"forest treatises\")  and the Upani@sads. All these literatures, both prose and verse,  were looked upon as so holy that in early times it was thought  almost a sacrilege to write them; they were therefore learnt by  heart by the Brahmins from the mouth of their preceptors and  were hence called _s'ruti_ (literally anything heard)[Footnote ref 1].      The Sa@mhitas.    There are four collections or Sa@mhitas, namely @Rg-Veda, Sama-Veda,  Yajur-Veda and Atharva-Veda. Of these the @Rg-Veda is probably the  earliest. The Sama-Veda has practically no independent value, for  it consists of stanzas taken (excepting only 75) entirely from the  @Rg-Veda, which were meant to be sung to certain fixed melodies, and  may thus be called the book of chants. The Yajur-Veda however contains  in addition to the verses taken from the @Rg-Veda many original prose  formulas. The arrangement of the verses of the Sama-Veda is solely with  reference to their place and use in the Soma sacrifice; the contents  of the Yajur-Veda are arranged in the order in which the verses were  actually employed in the various religious sacrifices. It is therefore  called the Veda of Yajus--sacrificial prayers. These may be contrasted  with the arrangement in the @Rg-Veda in this, that there the verses are  generally arranged in accordance with the gods who are adored in them.  Thus, for example, first we get all the poems addressed to Agni or the  Fire-god, then all those to the god Indra and so on. The fourth  collection, the Atharva-Veda, probably attained its present form  considerably later than the @Rg-Veda. In spirit, however, as Professor  Macdonell says, \"It is not only entirely different from the _Rigveda_  but represents a much more primitive stage of thought. While the  _Rigveda_ deals almost exclusively with the higher gods as conceived by a    _____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: Pa@nini, III. iii. 94.]    13    comparatively advanced and refined sacerdotal class, the _Atharva-Veda_  is, in the main a book of spells and incantations appealing to the demon  world, and teems with notions about witchcraft current among the lower  grades of the population, and derived from an immemorial antiquity. These  two, thus complementary to each other in contents are obviously the most  important of the four Vedas [Footnote ref 1].\"      The Brahma@nas. [Footnote ref 2]    After the Sa@mhitas there grew up the theological treatises called the  Brahma@nas, which were of a distinctly different literary type. They  are written in prose, and explain the sacred significance of the  different rituals to those who are not already familiar with them.  \"They reflect,\" says Professor Macdonell, \"the spirit of an age in  which all intellectual activity is concentrated on the sacrifice,  describing its ceremonies, discussing its value, speculating on its  origin and significance.\" These works are full of dogmatic assertions,  fanciful symbolism and speculations of an unbounded imagination in the  field of sacrificial details. The sacrificial ceremonials were probably  never so elaborate at the time when the early hymns were composed.  But when the collections of hymns were being handed down from generation  to generation the ceremonials became more and more complicated. Thus  there came about the necessity of the distribution of the different  sacrificial functions among several distinct classes of priests. We may  assume that this was a period when the caste system was becoming  established, and when the only thing which could engage wise and religious  minds was sacrifice and its elaborate rituals. Free speculative thinking  was thus subordinated to the service of the sacrifice, and the result  was the production of the most fanciful sacramental and symbolic    ____________________________________________________________________    [Footnote 1: A.A. Macdonell's _History of Sanskrit Literature_, p. 31.]    [Footnote 2: Weber (_Hist. Ind. Lit_., p. 11, note) says that the word  Brahma@na signifies \"that which relates to prayer _brahman_.\" Max Muller  (_S.B.E._, I.p. lxvi) says that Brahma@na meant \"originally the sayings  of Brahmans, whether in the general sense of priests, or in the more  special sense of Brahman-priests.\" Eggeling (S.B.E. XII. Introd. p. xxii)  says that the Brhama@nas were so called \"probably either because  they were intended for the instruction and guidance of priests (brahman)  generally; or because they were, for the most part, the authoritative  utterances of such as were thoroughly versed in Vedic and sacrificial  lore and competent to act as Brahmans or"]]]
