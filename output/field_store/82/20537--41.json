The character of the Chinese novels is the same with that of the better  parts of _Don Quixote, Gil Blas, Tom Jones_, and _Cecilia_. Their  authors address themselves to the reason rather than the imagination of  their readers. The other Asiatic nations, led away by a passion for the  marvellous, have often disfigured the most respectable traditions, and  converted history itself into romance. The Chinese, on the other hand,  may be said to have given their romances the truth of history.--_N.

This they evince by _self-immolation_, after  the manner of eastern wives. Among the few poisonous plants of Canada,  is a shrub, which yields a wholesome fruit, but contains in its roots a  deadly juice, which the widow, who wishes not to survive her husband,  drinks. An eye-witness describes its effects; the woman having resolved  to die, chanted her death song and funeral service; she then drank off  the poisonous juice, was seized with shivering and convulsions, and  expired in a few minutes on the body of her husband.             *       *       *       *       *    SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.           *       *       *       *       *      TWENTY-EIGHT AND TWENTY-NINE.        \"Rien n'est change, mes amis!\"[2]          CHARLES DIX.         [2] I have taken these words for my motto, because they _enable_ me     to tell a story. When the present King of France received his first     address on the return from the emigration, his answer was, \"Rien     n'est change, mes amis; il n'y a qu'un Francais de plus.\" When the     Giraffe arrived in the Jardin des Plantes, the Parisians had a     caricature, in which the ass, and the hog, and the monkey were     presenting an address to the stranger, while the elephant and the     lion stalked angrily away. Of course, the portraits were     recognisable--and the animal was responding graciously, \"Rien n'est     change, mes amis: il n'y a qu'un bete de plus!\"        I heard a sick man's dying sigh,      And an infant's idle laughter;    The old Year went with mourning by,      The new came dancing after;    Let Sorrow shed her lonely tear,      Let Revelry hold her ladle;    Bring boughs of cypress for the biel.      Fling roses on the cradle;    Mates to wait on the funeral state!      Pages to pour the wine!    And a requiem for Twenty-eight,--      And a health to Twenty-nine.      Alas! for human happiness,      Alas! for human sorrow;    Our Yesterday is nothingness,      What else will be our Morrow?    Still Beauty must be stealing hearts,      And Knavery stealing purses;    Still Cooks must live by making tarts,      And Wits by making verses;    While Sages prate and Courts debate,      The same Stars set and shine;    And the World, as it roll'd through Twenty-eight,      Must roll through Twenty-nine.      Some King will come, in Heaven's good time,      To the tomb his Father came to;    Some Thief will wade through blood and crime      To a crown he has no claim to;    Some Suffering Land will rend in twain      The manacles that bound her,    And gather the links of the broken chain      To fasten them proudly round her;    The grand and great will love, and hate,      And combat, and combine;    And much where we were in Twenty-eight,      We shall be in Twenty-nine.      O'Connell will toil to raise the Rent,      And Kenyon to sink the Nation;    And Sheil will abuse the Parliament,      And Peel the Association;    And the thought of bayonets and swords      Will make ex-Chancellors merry--    And jokes will be cut in the House of Lords,      And throats in the County Kerry;    And writers of weight will speculate      On the Cabinet's design--    And just what it did in Twenty-eight,      It will do in Twenty-nine.      Mathews will be extremely gay,      And Hook extremely dirty;    And brick and mortar still will say      \"Try Warren, No. 30;\"    And \"General Sauce\" will have its puff,      And so will General Jackson--    And peasants will drink up heavy stuff,      Which they pay a heavy tax on;    And long and late, at many a fete,      Gooseberry champagne will shine--    And as old as it was in Twenty-eight,      It will be in Twenty-nine.      And the Goddess of Love will keep her smiles;      And the God of Cups his orgies;    And there'll be riots in St. Giles,      And weddings in St. George's;    And Mendicants will sup like Kings,      And Lords will swear like Lacqueys--    And black eyes oft will lead to rings,      And rings will lead to black eyes;    And pretty Kate will scold her mate.      In a dialect all divine--    Alas! they married in Twenty-eight,--      They will part in Twenty-nine!      John Thomas Mugg, on a lonely hill,      Will do a deed of mystery--    The Morning Chronicle will fill      Five columns with the history;    The Jury will be all surprise,      The Prisoner quite collected--    And Justice Park will wipe his eyes,      And be very much affected;    And folks will relate poor Corder's fate,      As they hurry home to dine,    Comparing the hangings of Twenty-eight      With the hangings of Twenty-nine.      A Curate will go from the house of prayer      To wrong his worthy neighbour,    By dint of quoting the texts of Blair,      And singing the songs of Weber;    Sir Harry will leave the Craven hounds,      To trace the guilty parties--    And ask of the Court five thousand pounds,      To prove how rack'd his heart is:    An Advocate will execrate      The spoiler of Hymen's shrine--    And the speech that did for Twenty-eight      Will do for Twenty-nine.      My Uncle will swathe his gouty limbs,      And tell of his oils and blubbers;    My Aunt, Miss Dobbs, will play longer hymns,      And rather longer rubbers;    My Cousin in Parliament will prove      How utterly ruin'd trade is--    My Brother at Eton will fall in love      With half a hundred ladies;    My Patron will sate his pride from plate.      And his thirst from Bordeaux vine--    His nose was red in Twenty-eight,--      'Twill be redder in Twenty-nine!      And oh! I shall find, how, day by day.      All thoughts and things look older--    How the laugh of Pleasure grows less gay,      And the heart of Friendship colder;    But still I shall be what I have been,      Sworn foe to Lady Reason,    And seldom troubled with the spleen,      And fond of talking treason;    I shall buckle my skait, and leap my gate,      And throw, and write, my line--    And the woman I worshipped in Twenty-eight,      I shall worship in Twenty-nine!    _New Monthly Magazine._             *       *       *       *       *    MORAL EFFECT OF ROME UPON THE TRAVELLER.      Those only who have lived in Rome can duly estimate the potent and  lasting impression produced upon the mind of a thinking man, by a  residence in this capital of the ancient world. The daily contemplation  of so many classical and noble objects elevates and purifies the soul,  and has a powerful tendency to allay the inconsiderate fervours and  impetuosities of youth, to mature, and consolidate the character. I am  already so altered, and, I have the vanity to think, so improved a man  since my arrival here, that there are times when I almost doubt my own  identity, and imagine that, by some preternatural agency, I have been  born over again, and have had new blood and new vitality infused into my  frame.    The gratifications of a residence in Rome are inexhaustible. At every  turn I discover some new evidence of the power and magnificence of her  ancient inhabitants, and vivid sensations of delight and awe rapidly  succeed each other. This venerable metropolis is the tomb and monument,  not of princes, but of nations; it illustrates the progressive stages of  human society, and all other cities appear modern and unfinished in  comparison.    Exploring this forenoon the vicinity of Monte Palatino, I discovered in  an obscure corner, near the temple of Romulus, the time-hallowed spring  of Juturna, rising with crystal clearness near the Cloaca maxima, into  which it flows unvalued and forgotten. I refreshed myself in the mid-day  heat by drinking its pure lymph from the hollow of my hand, and gazed  with long and insatiable delight upon the memorable fountain. This  sacred spot is surrounded and obscured by contiguous buildings, and the  walls are luxuriantly fringed and mantled with mosses, lichens, and  broad leaved ivy. The proud aqueducts of the expanding city diminish the  value and importance of this spring, but it was unquestionably the  ruling motive which determined Romulus, or possibly an earlier colony of  Greeks, to take root here, as within the wide compass of the Roman walls  there is no other source of pure water.--_Blackwood's Magazine._             *       *       *       *       *    SONG, BY T. CAMPBELL        When Love came first to Earth, the SPRING      Spread rose-buds to receive him.    And back he vow'd his flight he'd wing      To Heaven, if she should leave him.      But SPRING departing, saw his faith      Pledg'd to the next new comer--    He revell'd in the warmer breath      And richer bowers of SUMMER.      Then sportive AUTUMN claim'd by rights      An Archer for her lover,    And even in WINTER'S dark, cold nights      A charm he could discover.      Her routs and balls, and fireside joy,      For this time were his reasons--    In short, Young Love's a gallant boy,      That likes all times and seasons.    _New Monthly Magazine._             *       *       *       *       *    SCHOOL AND COLLEGE.

Under the terms of the Constitution itself the  people of the United States, having some universal common interest  affected by law or by the want of law, are invited to come to this  body and try here their question of right, or at all events through  the agency of Congress to submit that proposition to the people at  large in order that in the general national forum it may receive  discussion, and by the action of three-fourths of the States, if  favorable, their idea may be incorporated in the fundamental law.    I will not detain the Senate further in the discussion of this  subject.    It should be borne in mind that the proposition is to submit to men  the question whether woman shall vote. The jury will certainly not be  prejudiced in her favor as against the public good. There can be no  danger of a verdict in her favor contrary to the evidence in the case.    We ask only for her an opportunity to bring her suit in the great  court for the amendment of fundamental law. It is impossible for any  right mind to escape the impression of solemn responsibility which  attaches to our decision. Ridicule and wit of whatever quality are  here as much out of place as in the debates upon the Declaration of  Independence. We are affirming or denying the right of petition which  by all law belongs as much to women as to men. Millions of women and  thousands of men in our own country demand that she at least have the  opportunity to be heard. Hear, even if you strike.    The lamented Anthony, so long the object of reverence, affection, and  pride in this body, among the last acts of his public life, in  signing the favorable report of this resolution, made the following  declaration:        The Constitution is wisely conservative in the provision of its      own amendment. It is eminently proper that whenever a large      number of the people have indicated a desire for an amendment the      judgment of the amending power should be consulted. In view of the      extensive agitation of the question of woman suffrage, and the      numerous and respectable petitions that have been presented      to Congress in its support, I unite with the committee in      recommending that the proposed amendment be submitted to the      States.        H.B. ANTHONY.    Profoundly convinced of the justice of woman's demand for the  suffrage, and that the proper method of securing the right is by an  amendment of the national Constitution, I urge the adoption of the  joint resolution upon the still broader ground so clearly and calmly  stated by the great Senator whose words I have just read. I appeal to  you, Senators, to grant this petition of woman that she may be heard  for her claim of right. How could you reject that petition, even were  there but one faint voice beseeching your ear? How can you deny the  demand of millions who believe in suffrage for women, and who can not  be forever silenced, for they give voice to the innate cry of the  human heart that justice be done not alone to man, but to that half of  this nation which now is free only by the grace of the other, and that  by our action to-day we indorse, if we do not initiate, a movement  which, in the development of our race, shall guarantee liberty to all  without distinction of sex, even as our glorious Constitution already  grants the suffrage to every citizen without distinction of color or  race.           *       *       *       *       *    Further consideration of the resolution postponed until January 25,  1887, when it was resumed, as follows:      _Tuesday, January 25, 1887._    WOMAN SUFFRAGE.    Mr. BLAIR. I now move that the Senate proceed to consider the joint  resolution (S.R. 5) proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the  United States extending the right of suffrage to women.    The motion was agreed to; and the Senate, as in Committee of the  Whole, proceeded to consider the joint resolution.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution will be read.    The Chief Clerk read the joint resolution, as follows:        _Resolved (two-thirds of each House concurring therein)_, That the      following article be proposed to the Legislatures of the several      States as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States:      which, when ratified by three-fourths of the said Legislatures,      shall be valid as part of said Constitution, namely:        ARTICLE--.        Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote      shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any      State on account of sex.        Sec. 2. The Congress shall have power, by appropriate legislation,      to enforce the provisions of this article.    Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the joint resolution introduced by my  friend, the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. BLAIR], proposing an  amendment to the Constitution of the United States, conferring the  right to vote upon the women of the United States, is one of paramount  importance, as it involves great questions far reaching in their  tendency, which seriously affect the very pillars of our social  fabric, which involve the peace and harmony of society, the unity of  the family, and much of the future success of our Government. The  question should therefore he met fairly and discussed with firmness,  but with moderation and forbearance.    No one contributes anything valuable to the debate by the use of harsh  terms, or by impugning motives, or by disparaging the arguments of the  opposition. Where the prosperity of the race and the peace of society  are involved, we should, on both sides, meet fairly the arguments of  our respective opponents.    This question has been discussed a great deal outside of Congress,  sometimes in bad temper and sometimes illogically and unprofitably,  but the advocates of the proposed amendment and the opponents of it  have each put forth, probably in their strongest form, the reasons and  arguments which are considered by each as conclusive in favor of the  cause they advocate. I do not expect to contribute much that is new  on a subject that has been so often and so ably discussed; but what I  have to say will be in the main a reproduction in substance of what  I and others have already said on the subject, and which I think  important enough to be placed upon the record in the argument of the  case.    In connection with my friend, the honorable Senator from Missouri [Mr.  COCKRELL], I have in a report set forth substantially the reasons  and arguments which to my mind establish the fact that the proposed  legislation would be injudicious and unwise, and I shall not hesitate  to reiterate here such portions of what was then said as seem to me to  be important.    I believe that the Creator intended that the sphere of the males and  females of our race should be different, and that their duties and  obligations, while they differ materially, are equally important and  equally honorable, and that each sex is equally well qualified by  natural endowments for the discharge of the important duties which  pertain to each, and that each sex is equally competent to discharge  those duties.    We find an abundance of evidence, both in the works of nature and in  the Divine revelation, to establish the fact that the family properly  regulated is the foundation and pillar of society, and is the most  important of any other human institution.    In the Divine economy it is provided that the man shall be the head  of the family, and shall take upon himself the solemn obligation of  providing for and protecting the family.    Man, by reason of his physical strength, and his other endowments and  faculties, is qualified for the discharge of those duties that  require strength and ability to combat with the sterner realities and  difficulties of life. The different classes of outdoor labor which  require physical strength and endurance are by nature assigned to man,  the head of the family, as part of his task. He discharges such labors  as require greater physical endurance and strength than the female sex  are usually found to possess.    It is not only his duty to provide for and protect the family, but  as a member of the community it is also his duty to discharge the  laborious and responsible obligations which the family owe to the  State, and which obligations must be discharged by the head of the  family, until the male members of the family have grown up to manhood  and are able to aid in the discharge of those obligations, when it  becomes their duty each in his turn to take charge of and rear a  family, for which he is responsible.    Among other duties which the head of the family owes to the State, is  military duty in time of war, which he, when able-bodied, is able to  discharge, and which the female members of the family are unable to  discharge.    He is also under obligation to discharge jury duty, and by himself  or his representatives to perform his part of the labor necessary to  construct and keep in order roads, bridges, streets, and all grades  of public highways. And in this progressive age upon the male sex is  devolved the duty of constructing and operating our railroads, and  the engines and other rolling-stock with which they are operated; of  building, equipping, and launching, shipping and other water craft of  every character necessary for the transportation of passengers and  freight upon our rivers, our lakes, and upon the high seas.    The labor in our fields, sowing, cultivating, and reaping crops must  be discharged mainly by the male sex, as the female sex, for want of  physical strength, are generally unable to discharge these duties.  As it is the duty of the male sex to perform the obligations to the  State, to society, and to the family, already mentioned, with numerous  others that might be enumerated, it is also their duty to aid in  the government of the State, which is simply a great"]]]
