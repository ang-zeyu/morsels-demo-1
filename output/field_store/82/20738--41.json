It would be out of place in this introduction to dwell in detail  upon the brief and insincere defence of the Empire by Saadat  'Ali, in attempting to save whom the Khan Dauran lost his life,  while the Nizam attempted vain negotiations. The Persians, as is  well-known, advanced on Dehli, massacred some 100,000 of the  inhabitants, held the survivors to ransom, and ultimately retired  to their own country, with plunder that has been estimated at  eighty millions sterling, and included the famous Peacock Throne.    The Nizam was undoubtedly the gainer by these tragic events. In  addition to being Viceroy of the Deccan, he found himself  all-powerful at Dehli, for Saadat 'Ali had died soon after the  Khan Dauran. Death continuing to favour him, his only remaining  rival, the Mahratta Peshwa, Baji Rao, passed away in 1740, on the  eve of a projected invasion of Hindustan. In 1745 the Province of  Rohelkhand became independent, as did the Eastern Subahs of  Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. Leaving his son to represent him at  Dehli, the Nizam settled at Haidarabad as an independent ruler,  although he still professed subordination to the Empire, of which  he called himself Vakil-i-Mutlak, or Regent.    Shortly after, a fresh invader from the north appeared in the  person of Ahmad Khan Abdali, leader of the Daurani Afghans, who  had obtained possession of the frontier provinces during the  confusion in Persian politics that succeeded the assassination of  Nadir. But a new generation of Moghul nobles was now rising,  whose valour formed a short bright Indian summer in the fall of  the Empire; and the invasion was rolled back by the spirit and  intelligence of the heir apparent, the Vazir's son Mir Mannu, his  brother-in-law Ghazi-ud-din, and the nephew of the deceased  Governor of Audh, Abul-Mansur Khan, better known to Europeans by  his title Safdar Jang. The decisive action was fought near  Sirhind, and began on the 3rd March, 1748. This is memorable as  the last occasion on which Afghans were ever repulsed by people  of India until the latter came to have European leaders. The  death of the Vazir took place eight days later. This Vazir  (Kamr-ul-din Khan), who had long been the head of the Turkish  party in the State, was the nominal leader of the expedition, in  conjunction with the heir-apparent, though the chief glory was  acquired by his gallant son Mannu, or Moin-ul-din. The Vazir did  not live to share the triumph of his son, who defeated the enemy,  and forced him to retire. The Vazir Kamr-ul-din died on the 11th,  just before the retreat of the Afghans. A round shot killed him  as he was praying in his tent; and the news of the death of this  old and constant servant, who had been Mohammad's personal friend  through all the pleasures and cares of his momentous reign,  proved too much for the Emperor's exhausted constitution. He was  seized by a strong convulsion as he sate administering justice in  his despoiled palace at Dehli, and expired almost immediately,  about the 16th of April, A.D. 1748.        CHAPTER IV.    A.D. 1748-54.        Ahmad Shah  The Rohillas  Ghazi-ud-din the younger   Perplexities of the Emperor  Alamgir II. placed on the throne.    SELDOM has a reign begun under fairer auspices than did that of  Ahmad Shah. The Emperor was in the flower of his age; his  immediate associates were men distinguished for their courage and  skill; the Nizam was a bar to the Mahrattas in the Deccan, and  the tide of northern invasion had ebbed out of sight.    There is, however, a fatal element of uncertainty in all systems  of government which depend for their success merely upon personal  qualities. The first sign of this precarious tenure of greatness  was afforded by the death of the aged Nizam Chin Kulich, Viceroy  of the Deccan, which took place immediately after that of the  late Emperor.    The eldest son of the old Nizam contended with the nephew of the  deceased Saadat  whose name was Mansur, but who is better known  by his title of Safdar Jang  for the Premiership, or office of  Vazir, and his next brother Nasir Jang held the Lieutenancy of  the Deccan. The command in Rajputan, just then much disturbed,  devolved at first on a Persian nobleman who had been his Bakhshi,  or Paymaster of the Forces, and also Amir-ul-Umra, or Premier  Peer. His disaster and disgrace were not far off, as will be seen  presently. The office of Plenipotentiary was for the time in  abeyance. The Vazirship, which had been held by the deceased  Kamr-ul-din was about the same time conferred upon Safdar Jang,  who also succeeded his uncle as Viceroy or Nawab of Audh. Hence  the title, afterwards so famous, of Nawab-Vazir.    Having made these dispositions, the Emperor followed the  hereditary bent of his natural disposition, and left the  provinces to fare as best they might, while he enjoyed the  pleasures to which his opportunities invited him. The business of  state fell very much into the hands of a eunuch named Jawid Khan,  who had long been the favourite of the Emperor's mother, a Hindu  danseuse named Udham Bai, who is known in history as the Kudsiya  Begam. The remains of her villa are to be seen in a garden still  bearing her name, on the Jamna side a little beyond the Kashmir  Gate of New Dehli. For a time these two had all at their command;  and the lady at least appears to have made a beneficent use of  her term of prosperity. Meanwhile, the two great dependencies of  the Empire, Rohilkand and the Panjab, become the theatre of  bloody contests.    The Rohillas routed the Imperial army commanded by the Vazir in  person, and though Safdar Jung wiped off this stain, it was only  by undergoing the still deeper disgrace of encouraging the Hindu  powers to prey upon the growing weakness of the Empire.    Aided by the Mahrattas under Holkar and by the Jats under Suraj  Mal, the Vazir defeated the Rohillas at the fords of the Ganges;  and pushed them up into the malarious country at the foot of the  Kumaon mountains, where famine and fever would soon have  completed their subjugation, but for the sudden reappearance in  the north-west of their Afghan kindred under Ahmad Khan the  Abdali.    The Mahrattas were allowed to indemnify themselves for these  services by seizing on part of the Rohilla country, and drawing  chauth from the rest; consideration of which they promised their  assistance to cope with the invading Afghans; but on arriving at  Dehli they learned that the Emperor, in the Vazir's absence, had  surrendered to Ahmad the provinces of Lahor and Multan, and thus  terminated the war.    An expedition was about this time sent to Ajmir, under the  command of Saadat Khan, the Amir-ul-Umra, the noble of the Shiah  or \"Iranian\" party already mentioned as commanding in Rajputan,  and who was also the Imperialist Viceroy of Agra. He wasted his  time and strength, however, in an attack upon the Jats, through  whose country the way went. When at last he neared Ajmir he  allowed himself to be entangled in the local intrigues which it  was the object of his expedition to suppress. He returned after  about fifteen months of fruitless campaigning, and was dismissed  from his office by the all-powerful Jawid, Ghazi-ud-din succeeded  as Amir-ul- Umra.    Almost every section of the History of Ahmad Shah abstracted by  Professor Dowson (VIII.) ends with some sinister allusion to this  favourite eunuch and his influence. The Emperor had nothing to  say as to what went on, as his mother and Jawid were the real  rulers. The Emperor considered it to be most suitable to him to  spend his time in pleasure; and he made his Zanana extend a mile.  For weeks he would remain without seeing the face of a male  creature. There was probably no sincere friend to raise a  warning; and the doom deepened and the hand wrote upon the wall  unheeded. The country was overrun with wickedness and wasted with  misery. The disgrace of the unsuccessful Saadat returning from  Ajmir, was enhanced by his vainly attempting to strike a blow at  the Empress and her favourite. They called in the Turkish element  against him, and contrived to alienate his countryman, Safdar  Jang, who departed towards his Viceroyship of Audh; leaving the  wretched remains of an Empire to ferment and crumble in its own  way.    The cabinet of the Empress was now, in regard to Ghazi-ud-din and  the Mahrattas, in the position of a necromancer who has to  furnish his familiars with employment on pain of their destroying  him. But an escape seemed to be afforded them by the projects of  Ghazi-ud-din, who agreed to draw off the dangerous auxiliaries to  aid him in wresting the Lieutenancy of the Deccan from his third  brother Salabat Jang who had possessed himself of the  administration on the death of Nasir Jang, the second son and  first successor of Chin Kulich, the old Nizam. He was to be  represented at Dehli by a nephew.    Gladly did the Persian party behold their rival thus depart;  little dreaming of the dangerous abilities of the boy he had left  behind. This youth, best known by the family affix of  Ghazi-ud-din (2nd), but whose name was Shahabuddin, and who is  known in native histories by his official title of Aamad-ul-Mulk,  was son of Firoz Jang, the old Nizam's fourth son. He at once  assumed the head of the army, and may be properly described,  henceforth, as \"Captain-General.\" He was but sixteen when the  news of his uncle's sudden death at Aurangabad was brought to  Dehli. Safdar Jang, returning from Lucknow, removed the Emperor's  chief favourite, Jawid, by assassination (28th August, 1752) and  doubtless thought himself at length"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14721"],[0,"Speeches & Letters of Abraham Lincoln, 1832-1865 (#6)"],[1,"I could in honour do (which, by  the way, had brought me round into the last fall), I concluded I might  as well bring it to a consummation without further delay, and so I  mustered my resolution and made the proposal to her direct; but,  shocking to relate, she answered, No. At first I supposed she did it  through an affectation of modesty, which I thought but ill became her  under the peculiar circumstances of the case, but on my renewal of the  charge I found she repelled it with greater firmness than before. I  tried it again and again, but with the same success, or rather with the  same want of success.    I finally was forced to give it up, at which I very unexpectedly found  myself mortified almost beyond endurance. I was mortified, it seemed to  me, in a hundred different ways. My vanity was deeply wounded by the  reflection that I had so long been too stupid to discover her  intentions, and at the same time never doubting that I understood them  perfectly; and also that she, whom I had taught myself to believe nobody  else would have, had actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness.  And, to cap the whole, I then for the first time began to suspect that I  was really a little in love with her. But let it all go! I'll try and  outlive it. Others have been made fools of by the girls, but this can  never in truth be said of me. I most emphatically, in this instance,  made a fool of myself. I have now come to the conclusion never again to  think of marrying, and for this reason--I can never be satisfied with  any one who would be blockhead enough to have me.    When you receive this, write me a long yarn about something to amuse me.  Give my respects to Mr. Browning.          _From a Debate between Lincoln, E.D. Baker, and others against Douglas,  Lamborn, and others. Springfield. December 1839_           *       *       *       *       *      ... Mr. Lamborn insists that the difference between the Van Buren party  and the Whigs is, that although the former sometimes err in practice,  they are always correct in principle, whereas the latter are wrong in  principle; and the better to impress this proposition, he uses a  figurative expression in these words: \"The Democrats are vulnerable in  the heel, but they are sound in the heart and in the head.\" The first  branch of the figure--that is, that the Democrats are vulnerable in the  heel--I admit is not merely figuratively but literally true. Who that  looks but for a moment at their Swartwouts, their Prices, their  Harringtons, and their hundreds of others, scampering away with the  public money to Texas, to Europe, and to every spot of the earth where a  villain may hope to find refuge from justice, can at all doubt that they  are most distressingly affected in their heels with a species of running  fever? It seems that this malady of their heels operates on the  sound-headed and honest-hearted creatures very much like the cork leg in  the song did on its owner, which, when he had once got started on it,  the more he tried to stop it, the more it would run away. At the hazard  of wearing this point threadbare, I will relate an anecdote which seems  to be too strikingly in point to be omitted. A witty Irish soldier who  was always boasting of his bravery when no danger was near, but who  invariably retreated without orders at the first charge of the  engagement, being asked by his captain why he did so, replied, \"Captain,  I have as brave a heart as Julius Caesar ever had; but somehow or other,  whenever danger approaches, my cowardly legs will run away with it.\" So  it is with Mr. Lamborn's party. They take the public money into their  hands for the most laudable purpose that wise heads and honest hearts  can dictate, but before they can possibly get it out again, their  rascally vulnerable heels will run away with them....          _Letter to W.G. Anderson. Lawrenceville, Illinois. October 31, 1840_      Dear Sir, Your note of yesterday is received. In the difficulty between  us of which you speak, you say you think I was the aggressor. I do not  think I was. You say my \"words imported insult.\" I meant them as a fair  set-off to your own statements, and not otherwise; and in that light  alone I now wish you to understand them. You ask for my present  \"feelings on the subject.\" I entertain no unkind feelings to you, and  none of any sort upon the subject, except a sincere regret that I  permitted myself to get into such an altercation.          _Extract from a Letter to John T. Stuart. Springfield Illinois. January  23, 1841_      For not giving you a general summary of news, you must pardon me; it is  not in my power to do so. I am now the most miserable man living. If  what I feel were equally distributed to the whole human family, there  would not be one cheerful face on earth. Whether I shall ever be better,  I cannot tell; I awfully forebode I shall not. To remain as I am is  impossible; I must die or be better, it appears to me. The matter you  speak of on my account you may attend to as you say, unless you shall  hear of my condition forbidding it. I say this because I fear I shall be  unable to attend to any business here, and a change of scene might help  me. If I could be myself, I would rather remain at home with Judge  Logan. I can write no more.          _From an Address before the Washingtonian Temperance Society.  Springfield, Illinois. February 22, 1842_      Although the temperance cause has been in progress for nearly twenty  years, it is apparent to all that it is just now being crowned with a  degree of success hitherto unparalleled.    The list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of fifties, of  hundreds, and of thousands. The cause itself seems suddenly transformed  from a cold abstract theory to a living, breathing, active and powerful  chieftain, going forth conquering and to conquer. The citadels of his  great adversary are daily being stormed and dismantled; his temples and  his altars, where the rites of his idolatrous worship have long been  performed, and where human sacrifices have long been wont to be made,  are daily desecrated and deserted. The trump of the conqueror's fame is  sounding from hill to hill, from sea to sea, and from land to land, and  calling millions to his standard at a blast.           *       *       *       *       *    \"But,\" say some, \"we are no drunkards, and we shall not acknowledge  ourselves such by joining a reform drunkard's society, whatever our  influence might be.\" Surely no Christian will adhere to this objection.    If they believe, as they profess, that Omnipotence condescended to take  on himself the form of sinful man, and, as such, to die an ignominious  death for their sakes, surely they will not refuse submission to the  infinitely lesser condescension for the temporal and perhaps eternal  salvation of a large, erring, and unfortunate class of their  fellow-creatures; nor is the condescension very great. In my judgment,  such of us as have never fallen victims have been spared more from the  absence of appetite, than from any mental or moral superiority over  those who have. Indeed I believe, if we take habitual drunkards as a  class, their heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison  with those of any other class. There seems ever to have been a proneness  in the brilliant and warm-blooded to fall into this vice. The demon of  intemperance ever seems to have delighted in sucking the blood of genius  and generosity. What one of us but can call to mind some relative more  promising in youth than all his fellows, who has fallen a sacrifice to  his rapacity? He ever seems to have gone forth like the Egyptian angel  of death, commissioned to slay, if not the first, the fairest born of  every family. Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career? In that  arrest all can give aid that will; and who shall be excused that can and  will not? Far around as human breath has ever blown, he keeps our  fathers, our brothers, our sons, and our friends prostrate in the chains  of moral death....    When the conduct of men is designed to be influenced, persuasion, kind,  unassuming persuasion, should ever be adopted. It is an old and a true  maxim \"that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.\"  So with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him  that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches  his heart, which, say what you will, is the great high-road to his  reason, and which, when once gained, you will find but little trouble in  convincing his judgment of the justice of your cause, if indeed that  cause really be a just one. On the contrary, assume to dictate to his  judgment, or to command his action, or to mark him as one to be shunned  and despised, and he will retreat within himself, close all the avenues  to his head and his heart; and though your cause be naked truth itself,  transformed to the heaviest lance, harder than steel, and sharper than  steel can be made, and though you throw it with more than herculean  force and precision, you shall be no more able to pierce him than to  penetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw. Such is man,  and so must he be understood by those who would lead him, even to his  own best interests....    Another error, as it seems to me, into which the old reformers fell, was  the position that all habitual drunkards were utterly incorrigible, and  therefore must be turned adrift and damned without remedy in order that  the grace of temperance might abound, to the temperate then, and to all  mankind some hundreds of years thereafter. There is in this something so  repugnant to humanity, so uncharitable, so cold-blooded and feelingless,  that it never did, nor never can enlist the enthusiasm of a popular  cause. We could not love the man who taught it--we could not hear him  with patience. The heart could not throw open its portals to it, the"]]]
