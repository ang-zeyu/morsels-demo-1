Wagon loads of them are poured into market, where  they sell from fifty to twenty-five and even twelve cents per dozen; and  pigeons become the order of the day at dinner, breakfast and supper,  until the very name becomes sickening.\"    [Footnote A: To-day, we think that the fowlers of the roccolos of  northern Italy are very cruel in their methods of catching song-birds  wholesale for the market (chapter xi); but our own countrymen of  Wilson's day were just as cruel in the method described above.]             *        *        *        *        *    The range of the passenger pigeon covered nearly the whole United  States from the Atlantic coast westward to the Rocky Mountains. A few  bold pigeons crossed the Rocky Mountains into Oregon, northern  California and Washington, but only as \"stragglers,\" few and far  between. The wide range of this bird was worthy of a species that  existed in millions, and it was persecuted literally all along the line.  The greatest slaughter was in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In 1848  Massachusetts gravely passed a law protecting the _netters_ of wild  pigeons from foreign interference! There was a fine of $10 for damaging  nets, or frightening pigeons away from them. This was on the theory that  the pigeons were so abundant they could not by any possibility ever  become scarce, and that pigeon-slaughter was a legitimate industry.    In 1867, the State of New York found that the wild pigeon needed  protection, and enacted a law to that effect. The year 1868 was the last  year in which great numbers of passenger pigeons nested in that State.  Eaton, in \"The Birds of New York,\" said that \"millions of birds occupied  the timber along Bell's Run, near Ceres, Alleghany County, on the  Pennsylvania line.\"    In 1870, Massachusetts gave pigeons protection except during an \"open  season,\" and in 1878 Pennsylvania elected to protect pigeons on their  nesting grounds.    The passenger pigeon millions were destroyed so quickly, and so  thoroughly _en masse_, that the American people utterly failed to  comprehend it, and for thirty years obstinately refused to believe that  the species had been suddenly wiped off the map of North America. There  was years of talk about the great flocks having \"taken refuge in South  America,\" or in Mexico, and being still in existence. There were  surmises about their having all \"gone out to sea,\" and perished on the  briny deep.    A thousand times, at least, wild pigeons have been \"reported\" as having  been \"seen.\" These rumors have covered nearly every northern state, the  whole of the southwest, and California. For years and years we have been  patiently writing letters to explain over and over that the band-tailed  pigeon of the Pacific coast, and the red-billed pigeon of Arizona and  the southwest are neither of them the passenger pigeon, and never can  be.    There was a long period wherein we believed many of the pigeon reports  that came from the states where the birds once were most numerous; but  that period has absolutely passed. During the past five years large cash  rewards, aggregating about $5000, have been offered for the discovery  of one nesting pair of genuine passenger pigeons. Many persons have  claimed this reward (of Professor C.F. Hodge, of Clark University,  Worcester, Mass.), and many claims have been investigated. The results  have disclosed many _mourning doves_, but not one pigeon. Now we  understand that the quest is closed, and hope has been abandoned.    The passenger pigeon is a dead species. The last wild specimen (so we  believe) that ever will reach the hands of man, was taken near Detroit,  Michigan, on Sept. 14, 1908, and mounted by C. Campion. That is the one  definite, positive record of the past ten years.    The fate of this species should be a lasting lesson to the world at  large. Any wild bird or mammal species can be exterminated by commercial  interests in twenty years time, or less.    THE ESKIMO CURLEW,_--Numenius borealis_, (Forst.). This valuable game  bird once ranged all along the Atlantic coast of North America, and  wherever found it was prized for the table. It preferred the fields and  meadows to the shore lines, and was the companion of the plovers of the  uplands, especially the golden plover. \"About 1872,\" says Mr. Forbush,  \"there was a great flight of these birds on Cape Cod and Nantucket. They  were everywhere; and enormous numbers were killed. They could be bought  of boys at six cents apiece. Two men killed $300 worth of these birds at  that time.\"    Apparently, that was the beginning of the end of the \"dough bird,\" which  was another name for this curlew. In 1908 Mr. G.H. Mackay stated that  this bird and the golden plover had decreased 90 per cent in fifty  years, and in the last ten years of that period 90 per cent of the  remainder had gone. \"Now (1908),\" says Mr. Forbush, \"ornithologists  believe that the Eskimo curlew is practically extinct, as only a few  specimens have been recorded since the beginning of the twentieth  century.\" The very last record is of two specimens collected at Waco,  York County, Nebraska, in March, 1911, and recorded by Mr. August Eiche.  Of course, it is possible that other individuals may still survive; but  so far as our knowledge extends, the species is absolutely dead.           *        *        *        *        *    In the West Indies and the Guadeloupe Islands, five species of macaws  and parrakeets have passed out without any serious note of their  disappearance on the part of the people of the United States. It is at  least time to write brief obituary notices of them.    We are indebted to the Hon. Walter Rothschild, of Tring, England, for  essential facts regarding these species as set forth in his sumptuous  work \"Extinct Birds\".    THE CUBAN TRICOLORED MACAW,--_Ara tricolor_, (Gm.). In 1875, when the  author visited Cuba and the Isle of Pines, he was informed by Professor  Poey that he was \"about ten years too late\" to find this fine species  alive. It was exterminated for food purposes, about 1864, and only four  specimens are known to be in existence.

GUADELOUPE MACAW,--_Ara guadeloupensis_, (Clark).--All that is known of  the life history of this large bird is that once it inhabited the  Guadeloupe Islands. The date and history of its disappearance are both  unknown, and there is not one specimen of it in existence.    YELLOW-WINGED GREEN PARROT,--_Amazona olivacea_, (Gm.).--Of the history  of this Guadeloupe species, also, nothing is known, and there appear to  be no specimens of it in existence.    PURPLE GUADELOUPE PARRAKEET,--_Anodorhynchus purpurescens_,  (Rothschild).--This is another dead species, that once lived in the  Guadeloupe Islands, and passed away silently and unnoticed at the time,  leaving no records of its existence, and no specimens.    THE CAROLINA PARRAKEET,--_Conuropsis carolinensis_, (Linn.), brings us  down to the present moment. To this charming little green-and-yellow  bird, we are in the very act of bidding everlasting farewell. Ten  specimens remain alive in captivity, six of which are in the Cincinnati  Zoological Garden, three are in the Washington Zoological Park and one  is in the New York Zoological Park.    Regarding wild specimens, it is possible that some yet remain, in some  obscure and _neglected_ corner of Florida; but it is extremely doubtful  whether the world ever will find any of them alive. Mrs. Minnie Moore  Willson, of Kissimee, Fla. reports the species as totally extinct in  Florida. Unless we would strain at a gnat, we may just as well enter  this species in the dead class; for there is no reason to hope that any  more wild specimens ever will be found.    The former range of this species embraced the whole southeastern and  central United States. From the Gulf it extended to Albany, N.Y.,  northern Ohio and Indiana, northern Iowa, Nebraska, central Colorado and  eastern Texas, from which it will be seen that once it was widely  distributed. It was shot because it was destructive to fruit and for its  plumage, and many were trapped alive, to be kept in captivity. I know  that one colony, near the mouth of the Sebastian River, east coast of  Florida, was exterminated in 1898 by a local hunter, and I regret to say  that it was done in the hope of selling the living birds to a New York  bird-dealer. By holding bags over the holes in which the birds were  nesting, the entire colony, of about 16 birds, was caught.    Everywhere else than in Florida, the Carolina parrakeet has long been  extinct. In 1904 a flock of 13 birds was seen near Lake Okechobee; but  in Florida many calamities can overtake a flock of birds in eight years.  The birds in captivity are not breeding, and so far as perpetuation by  them is concerned, they are only one remove from mounted museum  specimens. This parrakeet is the only member of its order that ranged  into the United States during our own times, and with its disappearance  the Order Psittaciformes totally disappears from our country.           *        *        *        *        *    CHAPTER III    THE NEXT CANDIDATES FOR OBLIVION      In the world of human beings, murder is the most serious of all crimes.
