History will never forget that great man, who aspired to all kinds  of glory, and would have been, if he had wished, as great a cook as  he was a statesman--I mean the Prince de Talleyrand, who rekindled the  sacred flame in France. The first clouds of smoke, which announced the  resurrection of the science of cookery in the capital, appeared from  the kitchen of an ancient bishop.    A revolution like the French, which presented to their eyes such  terrible spectacles, must have left some traces in their physical or  intellectual constitution. At the end of this bloody drama, the mind,  bewildered by the late dreadful scenes, was unable to feel those sweet  and peaceable emotions, in which it had formerly delighted; as the  palate, having long been at rest, and now become blunted, must require  high-seasoned dishes, to excite an appetite. The reign of the Directory,  therefore is that of Romances a la Radcliffe, as well as of Sauces a la  Provencale. Fortunately, the eighth of Brumaire pulled down the five  Directors, together with their saucepans.    Under the Consulship, and during the empire, the art of cooking, thanks  to the labours of Beauvilliers, Balaine, and other artists, made new and  remarkable improvements. Among the promoters of the gastric science, the  name of a simple amateur makes a distinguished figure--it is Grisnod  de la Reyniere, whose almanac the late Duke of York called the most  delightful book that ever issued from the press. We may affirm, that the  _Almanach des Gourmands_ made a complete revolution in the language and  usages of the country.    We are yet too near the restoration to determine the degree of influence  it had on cookery in France. The restoration has introduced into  monarchy the representative forms friendly to epicurism, and in this  respect it is a true blessing--a new era opened _to those_ who are  hungry.    M. Jarrin's fourth edition contains upwards of 500 receipts in Italian  confectionery, with plates of improvements, &c. like a cyclopaedian  treatise on mechanics; and when our readers know there are \"seven  essential degrees of boiling sugar,\" they will pardon the details of the  business of this volume. The \"degrees\" are--1. _Le lisse_, or thread,  large or small; 2. _Le perle_, or pearl, _le soufflet_, or blow; 4. _La  plume_, the feather; 5. _Le boulet_, the ball, large or small; 6. _Le  casse_, the crack; and, 7. the _caramel_. So complete is M. Jarrin's  system of confectionery, that he is \"independent of every other artist;\"  for he even explains engraving on steel and on wood. What a host of  disappointments this must prevent!    If we look further into, or \"drink deep\" of the art of confectionery,  we shall find it to be a perfect Microcosm--a little creation; for our  artist talks familiarly of \"producing picturesque scenery, with trees,  lakes, rocks, &c.; gum paste, and modelling flowers, animals, figures,  &c.\" with astonishing mimic strife. We must abridge one of these  receipts for a \"_Rock Piece Montee_ in a lake.\"    \"Roll out confectionery paste, the size of the dish intended to receive  it; put into a mould representing your _pond_ a lining of almond paste,  coloured pale pink, and place in the centre a sort of pedestal of almond  paste, supported by lumps of the same paste baked; when dry put it into  the stove. Prepare _syrup_ to fill the hollow of the _lake_, to  represent the _water_; having previously modelled in gum paste little  _swans_, place them in various parts of the _syrup_; put it into the  stove for three hours, then make a small hole through the paste, under  your _lake_, to drain off the syrup; a crust will remain with the  _swans_ fixed in it, representing the _water_. Next build the _rock_ on  the pedestal with rock sugar, biscuits, and other appropriate articles  in sugar, fixed to one another, supported by the confectionery paste you  have put in the middle, the whole being cemented together with caramel,  and ornamented. The moulding and heads should then be pushed in almond  paste, coloured red; the _cascades_ and other ornaments must be _spun in  sugar_.\"    These are, indeed, romantic secrets. Spinning nets and cages with sugar  is another fine display of confectionery skill--we say nothing of the  nets and cages which our fair friends are sometimes spinning--for the  sugar compared with their bonds--are weak as the cords of the  Philistines.           *       *       *       *       *          THE NATURALIST.           *       *       *       *       *      ROOKS.      We glean the following interesting facts from the _Essex Herald_, as  they merit the record of a _Naturalist_.    \"The voracious habits of the rook, and the vast increase of these birds  of late years in certain parts of Essex, has been productive of great  mischief, especially in the vicinity of Writtle and of Waltham. Since  February last, notwithstanding a vigilant watch, the rooks have stolen  sets of potatoes from a considerable breadth of ground at Widford Hall.  On the same farm, during the sowing of a field of 16 acres with peas,  the number of rooks seen at one time on its surface has been estimated  at 1,000, which is accounted for by there being a preserve near, which,  at a moderate computation, contains 1,000 nests. But the damage done by  rooks at Navestock and Kelvedon Hatch, and their vicinities, within a  small circle, has been estimated at L2,000. annually. Many farmers pay  from 8_s_. to 10_s_. per week, to preserve their seed and plants by  watching; but notwithstanding such precautions, acre after acre of  beans, when in leaf and clear from the soil, have been pulled up, and  the crop lost. The late hurricane proved some interruption to their  breeding; and particularly at the estate of Lord Waldegrave, at  Navestock, where the young ones were thrown from their nests, and were  found under trees in myriads; the very nests blown down, it is said,  would have furnished the poor with fuel for a short period.\"    The writer attributes this alarming increase of rooks to \"a desire on  the part of gentlemen to cause them to be preserved with the same  watchfulness they do their game.\" The most effectual means of deterring  the rook from their depredations, is, he says, \"to obtain several of  these birds at a period of the year when they can be more easily taken;  then cut them open, and preserve them by salt. In the spring, during the  seed time, these rooks are to be fastened down to the ground with their  wings spread, and their mouths extended by a pebble, as if in great  torture. This plan has been found so effectual, that even in the  vicinity of large preserves, the fields where the dead birds have been  so placed, have not been visited by a single rook.\"    The scarcity of the rook in France, and the antipathy which the French  have to that bird is thus accounted for:--    \"The fact has been often related by a very respectable Catholic Priest,  who resided many years at Chipping-hill, in Witham, that such was the  arbitrary conduct of the owners of abbeys and monasteries in France, in  preserving and cultivating the rook and the pigeon, that they increased  to such numbers as to become so great a pest, as to destroy the seed  when sown, and the young plants as soon as they appeared above the  ground; insomuch, that the farmer, despairing of a reward for his  labour, besides the loss of his seed, the fields were left barren, and  the supply of bread corn was, in consequence, insufficient to meet the  necessities of so rapidly increasing a people. The father of the  gentleman to whom we have alluded, was, for this offence, one of the  first victims to his imprudence. The revolutionary mob proceeded to his  residence, from whence they took him, and hung his body upon a gibbet;  they next proceeded to destroy the rooks and pigeons which he had  cultivated in great numbers, and strived to preserve with the same  tenacity as others do in this country. We are told by the son of this  martyr to his own folly, that the mob continued to shoot the birds  amidst the loudest acclamations, and that they exulted in the idea that  in each victim they witnessed the fall of an aristocrat.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE BANANA TREE.      The amount and rapidity of produce of this plant probably exceed that of  any other in the known world. In eight or nine months after the sucker  has been planted, clusters of fruit are formed; and in about two months  more they may be gathered. The stem is then cut down, and a fresh plant,  about two-thirds of the height of the parent stem, succeeds, and bears  fruit in about three months more. The only care necessary is to dig once  or twice a year round the roots. According to our author, on 1,076  square feet, from 30 to 40 banana trees may be planted in Mexico, which  will yield in the space of the year 4,414 lbs. avoirdupois of fruit;  while the same space would yield only 33 lbs. avoirdupois of wheat, and  99 of potatoes. The immediate effect of this facility of supplying the  wants of nature is, that the man who can, by labouring two days in the  week, maintain himself and family, will devote the remaining five to  idleness or dissipation. The same regions that produce the banana, also  yield the two species of manioc, the bitter and the sweet: both of which  appear to have been cultivated before the conquest.--_Foreign Quarterly  Review._           *       *       *       *       *      INDIAN CORN.      The most valuable article in South American agriculture, is  unquestionably the maize, or Indian corn, which is cultivated with  nearly uniform success in every part of the republic. It appears to  be a true American grain, notwithstanding many crude conjectures to  the contrary. Sometimes it has been known to yield, in hot and humid  regions, 800 fold; fertile lands return from 300 to 400; and a return of  130 to 150 fold is considered bad--the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1149"],[0,"From London to Land's End (#6)"],[1," of summer.    The city is placed upon the confluence of two large rivers, the Avon and  the Willy, neither of them considerable rivers, but very large when  joined together, and yet larger when they receive a third river (viz.,  the Naddir), which joins them near Clarendon Park, about three miles  below the city; then, with a deep channel and a current less rapid, they  run down to Christchurch, which is their port.  And where they empty  themselves into the sea, from that town upwards towards Salisbury they  are made navigable to within two miles, and might be so quite into the  city, were it not for the strength of the stream.    As the city of Winchester is a city without trade--that is to say,  without any particular manufactures--so this city of Salisbury and all  the county of Wilts, of which it is the capital, are full of a great  variety of manufactures, and those some of the most considerable in  England--namely, the clothing trade and the trade of flannels, druggets,  and several other sorts of manufactures, of which in their order.    The city of Salisbury has two remarkable manufactures carried on in it,  and which employ the poor of great part of the country round--namely,  fine flannels, and long-cloths for the Turkey trade, called Salisbury  whites.  The people of Salisbury are gay and rich, and have a flourishing  trade; and there is a great deal of good manners and good company among  them--I mean, among the citizens, besides what is found among the  gentlemen; for there are many good families in Salisbury besides the  citizens.    This society has a great addition from the Close--that is to say, the  circle of ground walled in adjacent to the cathedral; in which the  families of the prebendaries and commons, and others of the clergy  belonging to the cathedral, have their houses, as is usual in all cities,  where there are cathedral churches.  These are so considerable here, and  the place so large, that it is (as it is called in general) like another  city.    The cathedral is famous for the height of its spire, which is without  exception the highest and the handsomest in England, being from the  ground 410 feet, and yet the walls so exceeding thin that at the upper  part of the spire, upon a view made by the late Sir Christopher Wren, the  wall was found to be less than five inches thick; upon which a  consultation was had whether the spire, or at least the upper part of it,  should be taken down, it being supposed to have received some damage by  the great storm in the year 1703; but it was resolved in the negative,  and Sir Christopher ordered it to be so strengthened with bands of iron  plates as has effectually secured it; and I have heard some of the best  architects say it is stronger now than when it was first built.    They tell us here long stories of the great art used in laying the first  foundation of this church, the ground being marshy and wet, occasioned by  the channels of the rivers; that it was laid upon piles, according to  some, and upon woolpacks, according to others.  But this is not supposed  by those who know that the whole country is one rock of chalk, even from  the tops of the highest hills to the bottom of the deepest rivers.    They tell us this church was forty years a-building, and cost an immense  sum of money; but it must be acknowledged that the inside of the work is  not answerable in the decoration of things to the workmanship without.  The painting in the choir is mean, and more like the ordinary method of  common drawing-room or tavern painting than that of a church; the carving  is good, but very little of it; and it is rather a fine church than  finely set off.    The ordinary boast of this building (that there were as many gates as  months, as many windows as days, as many marble pillars as hours in the  year) is now no recommendation at all.  However, the mention of it must  be preserved:--       \"As many days as in one year there be,     So many windows in one church we see;     As many marble pillars there appear     As there are hours throughout the fleeting year;     As many gates as moons one year do view:     Strange tale to tell, yet not more strange than true.\"    There are, however, some very fine monuments in this church; particularly  one belonging to the noble family of Seymours, since Dukes of Somerset  (and ancestors of the present flourishing family), which on a most  melancholy occasion has been now lately opened again to receive the body  of the late Duchess of Somerset, the happy consort for almost forty years  of his Grace the present Duke, and only daughter and heiress of the  ancient and noble family of Percy, Earls of Northumberland, whose great  estate she brought into the family of Somerset, who now enjoy it.    With her was buried at the same time her Grace's daughter the Marchioness  of Caermarthen (being married to the Marquis of Caermarthen, son and heir-  apparent to the Lord of Leeds), who died for grief at the loss of the  duchess her mother, and was buried with her; also her second son, the  Duke Percy Somerset, who died a few months before, and had been buried in  the Abbey church of Westminster, but was ordered to be removed and laid  here with the ancestors of his house.  And I hear his Grace designs to  have a yet more magnificent monument erected in this cathedral for them,  just by the other which is there already.    How the Dukes of Somerset came to quit this church for their  burying-place, and be laid in Westminster Abbey, that I know not; but it  is certain that the present Duke has chosen to have his family laid here  with their ancestors, and to that end has caused the corpse of his son,  the Lord Percy, as above, and one of his daughters, who had been buried  in the Abbey, to be removed and brought down to this vault, which lies in  that they call the Virgin Mary's Chapel, behind the altar.  There is, as  above, a noble monument for a late Duke and Duchess of Somerset in the  place already, with their portraits at full-length, their heads lying  upon cushions, the whole perfectly well wrought in fine polished Italian  marble, and their sons kneeling by them.  Those I suppose to be the  father of the great Duke of Somerset, uncle to King Edward IV.; but after  this the family lay in Westminster Abbey, where there is also a fine  monument for that very duke who was beheaded by Edward VI., and who was  the great patron of the Reformation.    Among other monuments of noble men in this cathedral they show you one  that is very extraordinary, and to which there hangs a tale.  There was  in the reign of Philip and Mary a very unhappy murder committed by the  then Lord Sturton, or Stourton, a family since extinct, but well known  till within a few years in that country.    This Lord Stourton being guilty of the said murder, which also was  aggravated with very bad circumstances, could not obtain the usual grace  of the Crown (viz., to be beheaded), but Queen Mary positively ordered  that, like a common malefactor, he should die at the gallows.  After he  was hanged, his friends desiring to have him buried at Salisbury, the  bishop would not consent that he should be buried in the cathedral  unless, as a farther mark of infamy, his friends would submit to this  condition--viz., that the silken halter in which he was hanged should be  hanged up over his grave in the church as a monument of his crime; which  was accordingly done, and there it is to be seen to this day.    The putting this halter up here was not so wonderful to me as it was that  the posterity of that lord, who remained in good rank some time after,  should never prevail to have that mark of infamy taken off from the  memory of their ancestor.    There are several other monuments in this cathedral, as particularly of  two noblemen of ancient families in Scotland--one of the name of Hay, and  one of the name of Gordon; but they give us nothing of their history, so  that we must be content to say there they lie, and that is all.    The cloister, and the chapter-house adjoining to the church, are the  finest here of any I have seen in England; the latter is octagon, or  eight-square, and is 150 feet in its circumference; the roof bearing all  upon one small marble pillar in the centre, which you may shake with your  hand; and it is hardly to be imagined it can be any great support to the  roof, which makes it the more curious (it is not indeed to be matched, I  believe, in Europe).    From hence directing my course to the seaside in pursuit of my first  design--viz., of viewing the whole coast of England--I left the great  road and went down the east side of the river towards New Forest and  Lymington; and here I saw the ancient house and seat of Clarendon, the  mansion of the ancient family of Hide, ancestors of the great Earl of  Clarendon, and from whence his lordship was honoured with that title, or  the house erected into an honour in favour of his family.    But this being a large county, and full of memorable branches of  antiquity and modern curiosity, I cannot quit my observations so soon.  But being happily fixed, by the favour of a particular friend, at so  beautiful a spot of ground as this of Clarendon Park, I made several  little excursions from hence to view the northern parts of this county--a  county so fruitful of wonders that, though I do not make antiquity my  chief search, yet I must not pass it over entirely, where so much of it,  and so well worth observation, is to be found, which would look as if I  either understood not the value of the study, or expected my readers  should be satisfied with a total omission of it.    I have mentioned that this county is generally a vast continued body of  high chalky hills, whose tops spread themselves into fruitful and  pleasant downs and plains, upon which great flocks of sheep are fed, &c.  But the reader is desired to observe these hills and plains are most  beautifully intersected"]]]
