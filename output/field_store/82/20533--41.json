What it was is, according to  our authorities, very difficult for the Western mind to conceive. But  its practical effect was, that on the death of the imperfect man,  another finite existence of some sort necessarily took his place. But  this new finite existence was not the former man. It is only on the  death of him who has attained Nirvana that Karma ceases to act, and no  new finite existence takes his place.]    [Footnote 9: See Prof. W. Max Muller, on \"Egypt,\" in the _Encyc.  Biblica._]    [Footnote 10: \"Capability of walking home without help,\" is the limit  quaintly fixed by the poet. To our modern feeling it seems rather wide.  Yet, practically, it is the limit professedly observed by our publicans  in serving their customers.]    [Footnote 11: Karsten, _Xenophanis Reliquiae_, p. 68 (Amsterdam, 1830).  Both the paraphrase and occasional translations which I give are of  course free; but I think the spirit and meaning are preserved.]          CHAPTER II      POST-CHRISTIAN PANTHEISM.    In speaking of Neo-Platonism I incidentally mentioned its apparent  subjection to \"extraneous influences,\" These, of course, included the  rising power of Christianity and its Jewish traditions.    [Sidenote: The Hebrew Tradition.]    Even before the advent of the new revelation, the Jewish settlements  existing in all great cities of the Graeco-Roman world excited interest  at any rate among sentimentalists touched by the fascination at that  time beginning to be exerted by oriental religions. And this influence  of Jewish traditions was much facilitated by the existence of a Greek  translation of the Hebrew scriptures.    [Sidenote: Its Influence on Greek Philosophy.]    [Sidenote: To Inspire Devotion, Not Solve Problems.]    Now, what the Hebrew tradition did for Greek philosophy was, of course,  not to favour its Pantheistic trend, where that existed, but much more  to convert such semi-Pantheism from a mere intellectual speculation to  contemplative devotion. For Hebraism itself had become almost as  intensely monotheistic as the later Islam. And, though monotheism may be  a stage in the progress of religion from Animism to Pantheism, it may,  also, by the peculiar intensity of the personal devotion it sometimes  inspires, cause the very idea of any farther expansion of faith to be  counted a sin.    [Sidenote: Philo, the Jew of Alexandria.]    Perhaps the influence of Hebraism on Hellenism may be illustrated by the  Alexandrian Philo's pathetic endeavour not only to trace the wisdom of  the Greeks to Moses, but to show that this derived lore is much mightier  for good when re-invested with the spiritual power and ardent devotion  of the Jewish faith.    \"If any one will speak plainly,\" he writes,[12] \"he might say that the  intelligible world is nothing other than the word (se. [Greek: logos],  reason) of the world-making God. For neither is the intelligible city  anything other than the thought [Greek: logismos] of the architect  already intending to build the city. This is the teaching of Moses, not  mine. At any rate in what follows, when he records the origin of man, he  declares outright that man was made in the image of God. But if a part  (of creation) reflects the type, so also must the entire manifestation,  this intelligible ordered world, which is a reproduction of the divine  image on a larger scale than that of man.\"[13]    [Sidenote: Motives Underlying his Distortion of Hebraism.]    [Sidenote: Not Pantheistic.]    How Philo managed to extort this out of the Pentateuch is a question of  interest, but one on which I cannot delay. Suffice it, that while he  thus showed his reverence for the traditions of his race, his whole aim  is to fire philosophy with religious devotion. But he was not, in any  strict sense of the word, a Pantheist, though he regarded the Logos as  an emanation from the Eternal, and the kosmos, the ordered world, as in  some way emanating from the Logos. Perhaps, indeed, if we could exclude  from emanation the idea of time, as Christians are supposed to do when  they speak of the \"eternal generation\" of the Divine Son or the  \"procession\" of the Holy Ghost, we might regard Philo, with the  succeeding Neo-Platonists and some of the Gnostics, as approximately  Pantheistic. But his vagueness and uncertainty about matter forbid such  a conclusion. For whether he regarded matter as eternally existing apart  from the divine substance, or whether he looked upon it as the opposite  of Being, as a sort of positive nothing, in either case, it cannot be  said that for him the whole Universe was God, and nothing but God.    [Sidenote: Neo-Platonism.]    [Sidenote: Resultant of Contact between East and West.]    If I have given more space to the great Alexandrian Jew than my narrow  limits ought to afford, it is because I think I may thus avoid the  necessity of saying much about the philosophic schemes of the  Neo-Platonists, the phantasies of the Gnostics, or the occasionally  daring speculations of the Christian Fathers. For whether the works of  Philo were much studied by the Greeks or not, they certainly described  the spiritual resultant--so to speak--emerging from the mutual impact of  Western and Oriental, especially Jewish, ideas. Which resultant was \"in  the air\" from the first century of the Christian age; and the later  epistles ascribed to St. Paul, as well as the Fourth Gospel, show clear  traces of it.[14]    [Sidenote: Its Religious Inspiration.]    [Sidenote: Suggestive of Pantheism, but not such in Spinoza's Sense.]    But the inspiration of the time-spirit was not confined to the Christian  Church. For the city of Alexandria, where that spirit seems to have been  peculiarly potent as shown in the transfigured Judaism of Philo, was the  birthplace of the Neo-Platonic school already mentioned above. And among  its greatest members, such as Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus, the religious  influence of the East was distinctly apparent. True, they followed  Socrates and Plato in reverence for knowledge as the unfailing begetter  of virtue. But their speculations about the divine Being were touched by  Oriental emotion. And we may with some confidence believe that their  development of the Platonic Trinity owed a good deal to the rapid spread  of Christianity. Thus the sentiment, the fervour, the yearning for  \"salvation,\" the worship and devotion taught by the best of the  Neo-Platonists were not so much, from Athens as from Sinai and Galilee.  Yet, though there were in their world-conception many anticipations of  the gospel of the \"God-intoxicated man,\" whom the counsels of the  Eternal reserved for the fulness of times, it would scarcely be accurate  to describe the system of any of them as strictly Pantheistic. For they  were always troubled about \"matter\" as an anomalous thing in a divine  universe, and in treating of it they hesitated between the notion of an  eternal nuisance which the Demiurgus, or acting God, could only modify,  not destroy, and, on the other hand, a strained theory of an evil  nothing, which is yet something. Again, so far from realising Spinoza's  faith in God as so literally All in All that there is nothing else but  He, they would not tolerate the contact of the Infinite with the finite,  of God with the world. Consistently with such prepossessions, they held  obstinately to the notion of some beginning, and therefore some ending  of the ordered world. And this beginning was effected by emanations such  as the Logos, or, as others had it, the world-soul and other divine  energies, between the Eternal and creation; a phantasy which, however  poetically wrought out, is not really consistent with Pantheism.    [Sidenote: The Gnostics.]    Such ideas of a hierarchy of subordinate emanations to fill the supposed  abyss between the Infinite and the Finite were eagerly adopted and  developed by the pseudo-philosophers called Gnostics, on both sides of  the boundary between the Church and the World. Suffice it that, like  most, though by no means all of their predecessors, they regarded the  world of earth, sun, planet, stars, and animated nature with man at its  head, as the whole Universe; and, assuming that it must have had a  beginning, they vexed their souls with futile attempts to frame some  gradual transition from the uncreated to the created, from the eternal  to the mortal. The grotesque chimaeras engendered thus are remembered  now only as illustrations of the facile transition from the sublime to  the ridiculous and from philosophy to folly.    [Sidenote: The Church Fathers.]    [Sidenote: Augustine.]    The orthodox Christian fathers were not less conscious than the  Neo-Platonists or Gnostics of the perennial problem of the Many and the  One. But they were restrained, perhaps, by the \"faith that comes of  self-control,\" perhaps by mere common sense, from indulging in attempts  to connect the Infinite with the Finite by \"vain genealogies.\" Indeed,  for the most part they confessed that whatever light the Gospel might  shed on moral issues, it left untouched the ultimate question of the  relation of the Infinite to the Finite. And the only aspect of their  most venturesome speculations which I need recall is their insistence,  even when apparently verging toward Pantheism, on a transcendent as well  as an immanent God, that is on a Creator existing, so to speak, outside  the Universe and apart from it as well as permeating every part. Thus,  for example, Augustine would seem to deny to the world any separate  creature existence when he says, that but for the divinity everywhere in  it, creation would cease to be. But in his insistence on the creation of  the world from nothing, he directly contradicts Pantheism, because he  must necessarily be taken to mean that there is now something other than  God.

Head went downstairs into the garden and began to sink into the ground.    \"Head, come up,\" said his mother, \"and let us eat.\"    \"Sink! sink! sink!\" cried Head.    \"Head, come up and let us eat!\" repeated his mother.    \"Sink! sink! sink!\" was Head's answer, and he continued to sink  until he could no longer be seen. His mother tried in vain to take  him out. After a while a tree sprang up just where Head had sunk,  and in a short time it bore large, round fruit, almost as large as  a child's head. This is the origin of the orange-tree.      CHAPTER 7    Juan Pusong.    The Visayans tell many stories which have as their hero Juan Pusong,  or Tricky John. As the name implies, he is represented as being  deceitful and dishonest, sometimes very cunning, and, in some of the  stories told of him, endowed with miraculous power. The stories are  very simple and of not very great excellence. The few which follow  will serve as samples of the narratives told of this popular hero.        I. Juan Pusong was a lazy boy. Neither punishment nor the offer of  a reward could induce him to go to school, but in school-time he was  always to be found on the plaza, playing with the other boys.    His mother, however, believed him to be in school, and each day  prepared some dainty for him to eat upon his return home. Juan was  not satisfied with deceiving his mother in this way, but used to play  tricks on her.    \"Mother,\" he said, one day, \"I have already learned to be a seer  and to discover what is hidden. This afternoon when I come home from  school I will foretell what you have prepared for me.\"    \"Will you?\" said his mother joyfully, for she believed all he said,  \"I will try to prepare something new and you will not be able to  guess it.\"    \"I shall, mother, I shall, let it be whatever it may,\" answered  Juan. When it was time to go to school, Juan pretended to set out,  but instead he climbed a tree which stood near the kitchen, and hiding  himself among the leaves, watched through the window all that his  mother did.    His mother baked a bibingca, or cake made of rice and sweet potato,  and hid it in a jar. \"I will bet anything,\" she said, \"that my son will  not guess what it is.\" Juan laughed at his mother's self-conceit. When  it was time for school to close he got down, and with a book in his  hand, as though he had really come from school, appeared before his  mother and said: \"Mother, I know what you are keeping for me.\"    \"What is it?\" asked his mother.    \"The prophecy that I have just learned at school says that there is  a bibingca hidden in the olla.\" The mother became motionless with  surprise. \"Is it possible?\" she asked herself, \"my son is indeed a  seer. I am going to spread it abroad. My son is a seer.\"    The news was spread far and wide and many people came to make trial  of Pusong's powers. In these he was always successful, thanks to his  ability to cheat.        II. One day a ship was anchored in the harbor. She had come from a  distant island. Her captain had heard of Pusong's power and wished  to try him. The trial consisted in foretelling how many seeds the  oranges with which his vessel was loaded contained. He promised to  give Juan a great quantity of money if he could do this.    Pusong asked for a day's time. That night he swam out to the vessel,  and, hidden in the water under the ship's stern, listened to the  conversation of the crew. Luckily they were talking about this very  matter of the oranges, and one of them inquired of the captain what  kind of oranges he had.    \"My friend,\" said the captain, \"these oranges are different from any  in this country, for each contains but one seed.\"    Pusong had learned all that he needed to know, so he swam back to the  shore, and the next morning announced that he was ready for the trial.    Many people had assembled to hear the great seer. Pusong continued to  read in his book, as though it was the source of his information. The  hour agreed upon struck, and the captain of the vessel handed an  orange to Juan and said: \"Mr. Pusong, you may tell us how many seeds  this orange contains.\"    Pusong took the orange and smelled it. Then he opened his book and  after a while said: \"This orange you have presented me with contains  but one seed.\"    The orange was cut and but the one seed found in it, so Pusong was  paid the money. Of course he obtained a great reputation throughout  the country, and became very rich.        III. Juan Pusong's father drove his cows out one day to pasture. Juan  slipped secretly from the house, and going to the pasture, took the  cows into the forest and tied them there. When his father was going  for the cows he met Juan and asked: \"Where did you come from?\" The  boy replied: \"I have just come from school. What are you looking for?\"    \"I am looking for our cows,\" said his father.    \"Why did n't you tell me that before,\" asked Juan. \"Wait a minute,\"  and he took his little book from his pocket and, looking into it, said:  \"Our cows are in such a place in the forest, tied together. Go and get  them.\" So his father went to the place where Juan said the cows were  and found them. Afterwards it was discovered that Juan could not read  even his own name, so his father beat him for the trick he had played.        IV. Pusong and Tabloc-laui. Pusong had transgressed the law, and was  for this reason put into a cage to be in a short time submerged with  it into the sea.    Tabloc-laui, a friend of Pusong's, passed by and saw him in the  cage. \"What are you there for?\" Tabloc-laui asked.    \"Oh!\" answered Pusong, \"I am a prisoner here, as you see, because the  chief wants me to marry his daughter and I don't want to do it. I am  to stay here until I consent.\"    \"What a fool you are!\" said Tabloc-laui. \"The chief's daughter is  pretty, and I am surprised that you are not willing to marry her.\"    \"Hear me, Tabloc-laui!\" said the prisoner. \"If you want to marry  the chief's daughter, let me out and get in here in my place; for  tomorrow they will come and ask you if you will consent. Then you  will be married at once.\"    \"I am willing!\" exclaimed Tabloc-laui. \"Get out and I will take  your place!\"    Next morning the chief ordered his soldiers to take the cage with  the prisoner to the sea and submerge it in the water.    Tabloc-laui, on seeing the soldiers coming toward him, thought they  would make inquiries of him as Pusong had said.    \"I am ready now,\" he said, \"I am ready to be the princess's husband.\"    \"Is this crazy fellow raving?\" asked the soldiers. \"We are ordered  to take you and submerge you in the sea.\"    \"But,\" objected Tabloc-laui, \"I am ready now to marry the chief's  daughter.\"    He was carried to the sea and plunged into the water, in spite of  his crying, \"I am not Pusong! I am Tabloc-laui!\"    The next week the chief was in his boat, going from one fish-trap to  another, to inspect them. Pusong swam out to the boat.    The chief, on seeing him, wondered, for he believed that Pusong was  dead. \"How is this?\" he asked. \"Did you not drown last week?\"    \"By no means. I sank to the bottom, but I found that there was no water  there. There is another world where the dead live again. I saw your  father and he charged me to bid you go to him, and afterwards you will  be able to come back here, if you wish to do so.\" \"Is that really true,  Pusong?\" asked the chief. \"Yes, it is really true,\" was the reply.    \"Well, I will go there. I will have a cage made and go through the  way you did.\"    So the next morning the chief was submerged in the water, with the hope  of coming back. When a considerable time had elapsed without seeing  his return, his servants searched for Pusong, in order to punish him,  but he had escaped to the mountains.        V. The Enchanted Prince. There was once a king who had three young  and beautiful daughters named Isabel, Catalina, and Maria.    In the capital city of the kingdom lived a young man known by the  name of Juan Pusong. He had as friends an ape, named Amo-Mongo, and  a wildcat, whose name was Singalong. The three friends were passing  one day in front of the palace, and, seeing the three young ladies,  were greatly charmed by their beauty.    Pusong, who posed as a young aristocrat of considerable learning,  determined to go before the king and declare his love for the Princess  Isabel. The king received him favorably, and offered him a seat;  but Juan refused to sit down until he should know the result of  his request.    The king was astonished at his manner, and asked him what he  wanted. Juan replied that he had presumptuously allowed himself to be  charmed by the beauty of the Princess Isabel, and humbly requested the  king's consent to their marriage. The king had the princess summoned  before him, and in the presence of Pusong asked her if she would accept  this man as her husband. She dutifully expressed her willingness to do  whatever her father wished, so the king granted the request of Pusong,  who was immediately married to Isabel.    When Amo-Mongo saw how successful Pusong had been, he presented himself  before the king, as his friend had done, and requested the hand of the  Princess Catalina. The king, somewhat unwillingly, gave his consent,  and these two were also married.    When Singalong saw to what high positions his friends had attained,  he became desirous of like fortune, so he went to the king and obtained  his consent to his marriage with the Princess Maria.    All three of the king's sons-in-law lived with their wives at the  palace, at the king's expense. The latter seeing that his daughters'  husbands were lazy fellows, determined to make them useful, so he sent  Pusong and Amo-Mongo out to take charge of his estates in the country,  while to Singalong he gave the oversight of the servants who worked  in the kitchen of the palace.    Pusong and Amo-Mongo went out to the hacienda with the intention  of doing"]]]
