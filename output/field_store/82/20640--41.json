Great preparation is made in  Valhalla for his reception, and the poet ends by congratulating Hakon  (who, though a Christian, having been educated in England, had not  interfered with the heathen altars and sacrifices) on the toleration  which has secured him such a welcome. A still earlier poet, Hornklofi,  writing during the reign of Harald Fairhair (who died in 933), alludes  to the slain as the property of \"the one-eyed husband of Frigg.\"    Several Skalds mention legends of Thor: his fishing for the World-Snake  is told by Bragi (who from his place in genealogies must have written  before 900), and by Ulf Uggason and Eystein Valdason, both in the  second half of the tenth century; and Thjodulf and Eilif (the former  about 960, the latter a little later) tell tales of his fights with  the giants. Turning to the other Gods, Egil Skallagrimsson (about 970)  names Frey and Njoerd as the givers of wealth; Bragi tells the story  of Gefion's dragging the island of Zealand out of Lake Wener into  the sea; and Ulf Uggason speaks of Heimdal's wrestling with Loki.    The legend of Idunn is told by Thjodulf much as Snorri tells it:  Odin, Hoeni and Loki, while on a journey, kill and roast an ox. The  giant Thiazi swoops down in eagle's shape and demands a share; Loki  strikes the eagle, who flies off with him, releasing him only on  condition that he will betray to the giants Idunn, \"the care-healing  maid who understands the renewal of youth.\" He does so, and the Gods,  who grow old and withered for want of her apples, force him to go  and bring her back to Asgard.    The poet of _Eiriksmal_, quoted above, alludes to the Baldr myth:  Bragi, hearing the approach of Eirik and his host, asks \"What is  that thundering and tramping, as if Baldr were coming back to Odin's  hall?\" The funeral pyre of Baldr is described by Ulf Uggason: he is  burnt on his ship, which is launched by a giantess, in the presence  of Frey, Heimdal, Odin and the Valkyries.    Though heathen writers outside of Scandinavia are lacking, references  to Germanic heathendom fortunately survive in several Continental  Christian historians of earlier date than any of our Scandinavian  sources. The evidence of these, though scanty, is corroborative,  and the allusions are in striking agreement with the Edda stories in  tone and character.    Odin (Wodanus) is always identified by these writers with the  Roman Mercurius (whom Tacitus named as the chief German God). This  identification occurs in the eighth-century Paulus Diaconus, and in  Jonas of Bobbio (first half of the seventh century), and probably rests  on Odin's character as a wandering God (Mercury being diaktoros), his  disguises, and his patronage of poetry and eloquence (as Mercury is  logios). Odin is not himself in general the conductor of dead souls  (psychopompos), like the Roman God, his attendant Valkyries performing  the office for him. The equation is only comprehensible on the  presumption of the independence of Germanic mythology, and cannot be  explained by transmission. For if Odin were in any degree an imitation  of the Roman deity, other notable attributes of the latter would have  been assigned to him: whereas in the Edda the thieving God (kleptis)  is not Odin but Loki, and the founder of civilisation is Heimdal.    The legend of the origin of the Lombards given by Paulus Diaconus  illustrates the relations of Odin and Frigg. The Vandals asked Wodan  (Odin) to grant them victory over the Vinili; the latter made a similar  prayer to Frea (Frigg), the wife of Wodan. She advised them to make  their wives tie their hair round their faces like beards, and go with  them to meet Wodan in the morning. They did so, and Wodan exclaimed,  \"Who are these _Long-beards_?\" Then Frea said that having given the  Vinili a name, he must give them the victory (as Helgi in the Edda  claims a gift from Svava when she names him). As in _Grimnismal_,  Odin and Frigg are represented as supporting rival claims, and Frigg  gains the day for her favourites by superior cunning. This legend  also shows Odin as the giver of victory.    Few heathen legends are told however by these early Christian writers,  and the Gods are seldom called by their German names. An exception is  the Frisian Fosite mentioned by Alcuin (who died 804) and by later  writers; he is to be identified with the Norse Forseti, the son of  (probably at first an epithet of) Baldr, but no legend of him is  told. It is disappointing that these writers should have said so  little of any God except the chief one. A very characteristic touch  survives in Gregory of Tours (died 594), when the Frank Chlodvig tells  his Christian wife that the Christian God \"cannot be proved to be  of the race of the Gods,\" an idea entirely in keeping with the Eddic  hierarchy. Before leaving the Continental historians, reference may be  made to the abundant evidence of Germanic tree-worship to be gathered  from them. The holy oak mentioned by Wilibald (before 786), the sacred  pear-tree of Constantius (473), with numerous others, supply parallels  to the World-Ash which is so important a feature of Norse mythology.    A study of this subject would be incomplete without some reference to  the mythology of Saxo Grammaticus. His testimony on the old religion  is unwilling, and his effort to discredit it very evident. The  bitterness of his attack on Frigg especially suggests that she  was, among the Northmen, a formidable rival to the Virgin. When he  repeats a legend of the Gods, he transforms them into mortal heroes,  and when, as often happens, he refers to them accidentally as Gods,  he invariably hastens to protest that he does so only because it had  been the custom. He describes Thor and Odin as men versed in sorcery  who claimed the rank of Gods; and in another passage he speaks of  the latter as a king who had his seat at Upsala, and who was falsely  credited with divinity throughout Europe. His description of Odin  agrees with that in the Edda: an old man of great stature and mighty  in battle, one-eyed, wearing a great cloak, and constantly wandering  about in disguise. The story which Saxo tells of his driving into  battle with Harald War-tooth, disguised as the latter's charioteer  Brun, and turning the fight against him by revealing to his enemy Ring  the order of battle which he had invented for Harald's advantage, is  in thorough agreement with the traditional character of the God who  betrayed Sigmund the Volsung and Helgi Hundingsbane. Saxo's version  of the Baldr story has been mentioned already. Baldr's transformation  into a hero (who could only be slain by a sword in the keeping of  a wood-satyr) is almost complete. But Odin and Thor and all the  Gods fight for him against his rival Hother, \"so that it might be  called a battle of Gods against men\"; and Nanna's excuse to Baldr  that \"a God could not wed with a mortal,\" preserves a trace of his  origin. The chained Loki appears in Saxo as Utgarda-Loki, lying bound  in a cavern of snakes, and worshipped as a God by the Danish king  Gorm Haraldsson. Dr. Eydberg sees the Freyja myth in Saxo's story of  Syritha, who was carried away by the giants and delivered by her lover  Othar (the Od of the Edda): an example, like _Svipdag and Menglad_,  of the complete transformation of a divine into an heroic myth. In  almost all cases Saxo vulgarises the stories in the telling, a common  result when a mythical tale is retold by a Christian writer, though  it is still more conspicuous in his versions of the heroic legends.            Appendix      _Thrymskvida_.    1. Then Wing-Thor was angry when he awoke, and missed his hammer. He  shook his beard, he tossed his hair, the son of Earth groped about  for it.    2. And first of all he spoke these words: \"Hear now, Loki, what I  tell thee, a thing that no one in earth or heaven above has heard:  the Asa has been robbed of his hammer!\"    3. They went to the dwelling of fair Freyja, and these words he  spoke first of all: \"Wilt thou lend me, Freyja, thy feather dress,  to see if I can find my hammer?\"    4. _Freyja_. \"I would give it thee, though it were of gold; I would  grant it, though it were of silver.\"    5. Then Loki flew, the feather-coat rustled, until he came out of  Asgard and into Joetunheim.    6. Thrym, lord of the Giants, sat on a howe; he twisted golden bands  for his greyhounds and trimmed his horses' manes.    7. _Thrym_. \"How is it with the Aesir? How is it with the Elves? Why  art thou come alone into Joetunheim?\"    _Loki_. \"It is ill with the Aesir, it is ill with the Elves; hast  thou hidden the Thunderer's hammer?\"    8. _Thrym_. \"I have hidden the Thunderer's hammer eight miles below the  earth. No man shall bring it back, unless he bring me Freyja to wife.\"    9. Then Loki flew, the feather-coat rustled, until he came out of  Joetunheim and into Asgard. Thor met him in the middle of the court,  and these words he spoke first:    10. \"Hast thou news in proportion to thy toil? Tell me from on high  thy distant tidings, for a sitting man often breaks down in his story,  and he who lies down falls into falsehood.\"    11. _Loki_. \"I bring news for my toil: Thrym, lord of the Giants,  has thy hammer; no man shall bring it back, unless he take him Freyja  as a bride.\"    12. They went to see fair Freyja, spoke to her first of all these  words: \"Bind on the bridal veil, Freyja, we two must drive to  Joetunheim.\"    13. Angry then was Freyja; she panted, so that all the hall of the  Aesir trembled, and the great Brising necklace fell: \"Eager indeed  for marriage wouldst thou think me, if I should drive with thee  to Joetunheim.\"    14. Then all the Aesir went into council, and all the Asynjor to  consultation, and the mighty Gods discussed how they should"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13008"],[0,"The Edda, Volume 2 (#6)"],[1,": thou didst  choose us for our strength and size but asked not our race. Bold  were Hrungni and his father, and mightier Thiazi; Idi and Orni were  our ancestors, from them are we daughters of the mountain-giants  sprung.... We maids wrought mighty deeds, we moved the mountains  from their places, we rolled rocks over the court of the giants,  so that the earth shook.... Now we are come to the king's house,  meeting no mercy and held in bondage, mud beneath our feet and cold  over our heads, we grind the Peace-maker. It is dreary at Frodi's.\"    As they sang of their wrongs by night, their mood changed, and instead  of grinding peace and wealth, they ground war, fire and sword:    \"Waken, Frodi! waken, Frodi! if thou wilt hear our songs.... I see  fire burn at the east of the citadel, the voice of war awakes, the  signal is given. A host will come hither in speed, and burn the hall  over the king.\"    So the bondmaids ground on in giant-wrath, while the sea-king Mysing  sailed nearer with his host, until the quern-stones split; and then  the daughters of the mountain-giants spoke once more: \"We have ground  to our pleasure, Frodi; we maids have stood long at the mill.\"    A Norseman was rarely content to allow a fortunate ending to any  hero, and a continuation of the story therefore makes the mill bring  disaster on Mysing also. After slaying Frodi and burning his hall,  he took the stones and the bondmaids on board his ship, and bade them  grind salt. They ground till the weight sank the ship to the bottom  of the sea, where the mill is grinding still. This is not in the song,  though it has lived longer popularly than the earlier part. Dr. Rydberg  identities Frodi with Frey, the God of fertility.    _The Everlasting Battle_.--No Eddic poem survives on the battle of the  Hjathnings, the story of which is told in prose by Snorri. It must,  however, be an ancient legend; and the hero Hedin belongs to one of  the old Germanic heroic races, for the minstrel Deor is a dependent of  the Heodenings in the Old English poem to which reference will be made  later. The legend is that Hild, daughter of Hoegni, was carried away by  Hedin the Hjathning, Hjarrandi's son. Hoegni pursued, and overtook them  near the Orkneys. Then Hild went to her father and offered atonement  from Hedin, but said also that he was quite ready to fight, and Hoegni  need expect no mercy. Hoegni answered shortly, and Hild returning told  Hedin that her father would accept no atonement but bade him prepare  to fight. Both kings landed on an island, followed by their men. Hedin  called to Hoegni and offered atonement and much gold, but Hoegni said it  was too late, his sword was already drawn. They fought till evening,  and then returned to their ships; but Hild went on shore and woke up  all the slain by sorcery, so that the battle began again next day  just as before. Every day they fight, and every night the dead are  recalled to life, and so it will go on till Ragnaroek.    In the German poem, _Gudrun_, the Continental version of this legend  occurs in the story of the second Hilde. She is carried away by the  minstrel Horant (who thus plays a more active part than the Norse  Hjarrandi), as envoy from King Hettel, Hedin's German counterpart. Her  father Hagen pursues, and after a battle with Hettel agrees to a  reconciliation. The story is duplicated in the abduction of Hilde's  daughter Gudrun, and the battle on the Wuelpensand.    Another reference may probably be supplied by the much debated lines  14-16 from the Anglo-Saxon _Deor_, of which the most satisfactory  translation seems to be: \"Many of us have heard of the harm of Hild;  the Jute's loves were unbounded, so that the care of love took  from him sleep altogether.\" Saxo, it is true, makes Hild's father  a Jute, instead of her lover, and Snorri apparently agrees with him  in making Hedin Norwegian; but in the _Gudrun_ Hettel is Frisian or  Jutish. The Anglo-Saxon _Widsith_ mentions in one line Hagena, king of  the Holmrygas (a Norwegian province), and Heoden, king of the Glommas  (not identified), who may be the Hoegni and Hedin of this tale.    The Anglo-Saxon and German agree on another point where both differ  from the Norse. The Anglo-Saxon poem _Deor_ is supposed to be spoken  by a _scop_ or court poet who has been ousted from the favour of  his lord, a Heodening, by Heorrenda, another singer: \"Once I was the  Heodenings' scop, dear to my lord: Deor was my name. Many a year I had  a good service and a gracious lord, until the song-skilled Hoerrenda  received the rights which the protector of men once granted me.\" Like  Heorrenda, Horant in the _Gudrun_ is a singer in the service of the  Heathnings. The Norse version keeps the name, and its connection with  the Heathnings, but gives Hjarrandi, as the hero's father, no active  part to play. In both points, arguing from the probable Frisian origin  of the story, the Anglo-Saxon and German are more likely to have the  correct form.    The legend is, like those of Walter and Hildigund, Helgi and Sigrun,  founded on the primary instincts of love and war. In the Norse  story of the Heathnings, however, the former element is almost  eliminated. It is from no love to Hedin that Hild accompanies him,  though Saxo would have it so. Nothing is clearer than that strife is  her only object. It is her mediation which brings about the battle,  when apparently both heroes would be quite willing to make peace; and  her arts which cause the daily renewal of fighting. This island battle  among dead and living is peculiar to the Norse version, and coloured  by, if not originating in, the Valhalla idea: Hoegni and Hedin and  their men are the Einherjar who fight every day and rest and feast  at night, Hild is a war-goddess. The conception of her character,  contrasting with the gentler part played by the Continental German  heroines (who are rather the causes than the inciters of strife),  can be paralleled from many of the sagas proper.    Hoegni's sword Dainsleif, forged by the dwarfs, as were all magic  weapons, is like the sword of Angantyr, in that it claims a victim  whenever it is drawn from the sheath: an idea which may easily have  arisen from the prowess of any famous swordsman.    _The Sword of Angantyr_.--Like the two last legends, Angantyr's  story is not represented in the Elder Edda; it is not even told by  Snorri. Yet poems belonging to the cycle survive (preserved by good  fortune in the late mythical _Hervarar Saga_)  which among the heroic  poems rank next in artistic beauty to the Helgi Lays. Since the story  possesses besides a striking originality, and is connected with the  name of a Pan-Germanic hero, the Ongendtheow of Old English poetry,  I cannot follow the example of most editors and omit it from the  heroic poems.    Like the Volsung legend it is the story of a curse; and there is a  general similarity of outline, with the exception that the hero is in  this case a woman. The curse-laden treasure is here the sword Tyrfing,  which Svafrlami got by force from the dwarfs. They laid a curse on it:  that it should bring death to its bearer, no wound it made should be  healed, and it should claim a victim whenever it was unsheathed. In  the saga, the story is spread over several generations: partly, no  doubt, in order to include varying versions; partly also in imitation  of the true Icelandic family saga. The chief actors in the legend,  beside the sword, are Angantyr and his daughter Hervoer.    The earlier history of Tyrfing is told in the saga. Svafrlami is  killed, with the magic weapon itself, by the viking Arngrim, who thus  gains possession of it; when he is slain in his turn, it descends to  Angantyr, the eldest of his twelve berserk sons. For a while no one  can withstand them, but the doom overtakes them at last in the battle  of Samsey against the Swedes Arrow-Odd and Hjalmar. In berserk-rage,  the twelve brothers attack the Swedish ships, and slay every man  except the two leaders who have landed on the island. The battle  over, the berserks go ashore, and there when their fury is past, they  are attacked by the two Swedish champions. Odd fights eleven of the  brothers, but Hjalmar has the harder task in meeting Angantyr and his  sword. All the twelve sons of Arngrim fall, and Hjalmar is mortally  wounded by Tyrfing. The survivor buries his twelve foemen where they  fell, and takes his comrade's body back to Sweden. The first poem  gives the challenge of the Swedish champions, and Hjalmar's dying song.    Hervoer, the daughter of Angantyr, is in some respects a female  counterpart of Sigurd. Like him, she is born after her father's death,  and brought up in obscurity. When she learns her father's name, she  goes forth without delay to claim her inheritance from the dead, even  with the curse that goes with it. Here the second poem begins. On  reaching the island where her father fell, she asks a shepherd to  guide her to the graves of Arngrim's sons:    \"I will ask no hospitality, for I know not the islanders; tell me  quickly, where are the graves called Hjoervard's howes?\"    He is unwilling: \"The man is foolish who comes here alone in the dark  shade of night: fire is flickering, howes are opening, field and fen  are aflame,\" and flees into the woods, but Hervoer is dauntless and  goes on alone. She reaches the howes, and calls on the sons of Arngrim:    \"Awake, Angantyr! Hervoer calls thee, only daughter to thee and  Tofa. Give me from the howe the keen sword which the dwarfs forged  for Svafrlami, Hervard, Hjoervard, Hrani, Angantyr! I call you all  from below the tree-roots, with helm and corselet, with sharp sword,  shield and harness, and reddened spear.\"    Angantyr denies that the sword is in his howe: \"Neither father, son,  nor other kinsmen buried me; my slayers had Tyrfing;\" but Hervoer does  not believe him. \"Tell me but truth.... Thou art slow to give thine  only child her heritage.\" He tries to "]]]
