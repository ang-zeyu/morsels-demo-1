They were  drowned. In rear of these, the open spaces of the forest showed the  leader as many formless figures of his grim command as at first; but not  nearly so many were in motion. He waved his cap for their encouragement  and smilingly pointed with his weapon in the direction of the guiding  light--a pillar of fire to this strange exodus.    Confident of the fidelity of his forces, he now entered the belt of  woods, passed through it easily in the red illumination, climbed a  fence, ran across a field, turning now and again to coquet with his  responsive shadow, and so approached the blazing ruin of a dwelling.  Desolation everywhere! In all the wide glare not a living thing was  visible. He cared nothing for that; the spectacle pleased, and he danced  with glee in imitation of the wavering flames. He ran about, collecting  fuel, but every object that he found was too heavy for him to cast in  from the distance to which the heat limited his approach. In despair he  flung in his sword--a surrender to the superior forces of nature. His  military career was at an end.    Shifting his position, his eyes fell upon some outbuildings which had an  oddly familiar appearance, as if he had dreamed of them. He stood  considering them with wonder, when suddenly the entire plantation, with  its inclosing forest, seemed to turn as if upon a pivot. His little  world swung half around; the points of the compass were reversed. He  recognized the blazing building as his own home!    For a moment he stood stupefied by the power of the revelation, then ran  with stumbling feet, making a half-circuit of the ruin. There,  conspicuous in the light of the conflagration, lay the dead body of a  woman--the white face turned upward, the hands thrown out and clutched  full of grass, the clothing deranged, the long dark hair in tangles and  full of clotted blood. The greater part of the forehead was torn away,  and from the jagged hole the brain protruded, overflowing the temple, a  frothy mass of gray, crowned with clusters of crimson bubbles--the work  of a shell.    The child moved his little hands, making wild, uncertain gestures. He  uttered a series of inarticulate and indescribable cries--something  between the chattering of an ape and the gobbling of a turkey--a  startling, soulless, unholy sound, the language of a devil. The child  was a deaf mute.    Then he stood motionless, with quivering lips, looking down upon the  wreck.          A SON OF THE GODS    A STUDY IN THE PRESENT TENSE    A breezy day and a sunny landscape. An open country to right and left  and forward; behind, a wood. In the edge of this wood, facing the open  but not venturing into it, long lines of troops, halted. The wood is  alive with them, and full of confused noises--the occasional rattle of  wheels as a battery of artillery goes into position to cover the  advance; the hum and murmur of the soldiers talking; a sound of  innumerable feet in the dry leaves that strew the interspaces among the  trees; hoarse commands of officers. Detached groups of horsemen are well  in front--not altogether exposed--many of them intently regarding the  crest of a hill a mile away in the direction of the interrupted advance.  For this powerful army, moving in battle order through a forest, has met  with a formidable obstacle--the open country. The crest of that gentle  hill a mile away has a sinister look; it says, Beware! Along it runs a  stone wall extending to left and right a great distance. Behind the wall  is a hedge; behind the hedge are seen the tops of trees in rather  straggling order. Among the trees--what? It is necessary to know.    Yesterday, and for many days and nights previously, we were fighting  somewhere; always there was cannonading, with occasional keen rattlings  of musketry, mingled with cheers, our own or the enemy's, we seldom  knew, attesting some temporary advantage. This morning at daybreak the  enemy was gone. We have moved forward across his earthworks, across  which we have so often vainly attempted to move before, through the  debris of his abandoned camps, among the graves of his fallen, into the  woods beyond.    How curiously we had regarded everything! how odd it all had seemed!  Nothing had appeared quite familiar; the most commonplace objects--an  old saddle, a splintered wheel, a forgotten canteen--everything had  related something of the mysterious personality of those strange men who  had been killing us. The soldier never becomes wholly familiar with the  conception of his foes as men like himself; he cannot divest himself of  the feeling that they are another order of beings, differently  conditioned, in an environment not altogether of the earth. The smallest  vestiges of them rivet his attention and engage his interest. He thinks  of them as inaccessible; and, catching an unexpected glimpse of them,  they appear farther away, and therefore larger, than they really are--  like objects in a fog. He is somewhat in awe of them.    From the edge of the wood leading up the acclivity are the tracks of  horses and wheels--the wheels of cannon. The yellow grass is beaten down  by the feet of infantry. Clearly they have passed this way in thousands;  they have not withdrawn by the country roads. This is significant--it is  the difference between retiring and retreating.    That group of horsemen is our commander, his staff and escort. He is  facing the distant crest, holding his field-glass against his eyes with  both hands, his elbows needlessly elevated. It is a fashion; it seems to  dignify the act; we are all addicted to it. Suddenly he lowers the glass  and says a few words to those about him. Two or three aides detach  themselves from the group and canter away into the woods, along the  lines in each direction. We did not hear his words, but we know them:  \"Tell General X. to send forward the skirmish line.\" Those of us who  have been out of place resume our positions; the men resting at ease  straighten themselves and the ranks are re-formed without a command.  Some of us staff officers dismount and look at our saddle girths; those  already on the ground remount.    Galloping rapidly along in the edge of the open ground comes a young  officer on a snow-white horse. His saddle blanket is scarlet. What a  fool! No one who has ever been in action but remembers how naturally  every rifle turns toward the man on a white horse; no one but has  observed how a bit of red enrages the bull of battle. That such colors  are fashionable in military life must be accepted as the most  astonishing of all the phenomena of human vanity. They would seem to  have been devised to increase the death-rate.    This young officer is in full uniform, as if on parade. He is all agleam  with bullion--a blue-and-gold edition of the Poetry of War. A wave of  derisive laughter runs abreast of him all along the line. But how  handsome he is!--with what careless grace he sits his horse!    He reins up within a respectful distance of the corps commander and  salutes. The old soldier nods familiarly; he evidently knows him. A  brief colloquy between them is going on; the young man seems to be  preferring some request which the elder one is indisposed to grant. Let  us ride a little nearer. Ah! too late--it is ended. The young officer  salutes again, wheels his horse, and rides straight toward the crest of  the hill!    A thin line of skirmishers, the men deployed at six paces or so apart,  now pushes from the wood into the open. The commander speaks to his  bugler, who claps his instrument to his lips. _Tra-la-la! Tra-la-la!_  The skirmishers halt in their tracks.    Meantime the young horseman has advanced a hundred yards. He is riding  at a walk, straight up the long slope, with never a turn of the head.  How glorious! Gods! what would we not give to be in his place--with his  soul! He does not draw his sabre; his right hand hangs easily at his  side. The breeze catches the plume in his hat and flutters it smartly.  The sunshine rests upon his shoulder-straps, lovingly, like a visible  benediction. Straight on he rides. Ten thousand pairs of eyes are fixed  upon him with an intensity that he can hardly fail to feel; ten thousand  hearts keep quick time to the inaudible hoof-beats of his snowy steed.  He is not alone--he draws all souls after him. But we remember that we  laughed! On and on, straight for the hedge-lined wall, he rides. Not a  look backward. O, if he would but turn--if he could but see the love,  the adoration, the atonement!    Not a word is spoken; the populous depths of the forest still murmur  with their unseen and unseeing swarm, but all along the fringe is  silence. The burly commander is an equestrian statue of himself. The  mounted staff officers, their field glasses up, are motionless all. The  line of battle in the edge of the wood stands at a new kind of  \"attention,\" each man in the attitude in which he was caught by the  consciousness of what is going on. All these hardened and impenitent  man-killers, to whom death in its awfulest forms is a fact familiar to  their every-day observation; who sleep on hills trembling with the  thunder of great guns, dine in the midst of streaming missiles, and play  at cards among the dead faces of their dearest friends--all are watching  with suspended breath and beating hearts the outcome of an act involving  the life of one man. Such is the magnetism of courage and devotion.    If now you should turn your head you would see a simultaneous movement  among the spectators--a start, as if they had received an electric  shock--and looking forward again to the now distant horseman you would  see that he has in that instant altered his direction and is riding at  an angle to his former course. The spectators suppose the sudden  deflection to be caused by a shot, perhaps a wound; but take this  field-glass and you will observe that he is riding toward a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13341"],[0,"Hymns and Spiritual Songs (#6)"],[1,"God  Wisdom and power belongs,  Immortal crowns of majesty,  And everlasting songs.      Hymn 1:52.  Baptism, Matt. 28. 19. Acts 2. 38.    1 'Twas the commission of our Lord,  \"Go, teach the nations, and baptize;\"  The nations have receiv'd the word  Since he ascended to the skies.    2 He sits upon th' eternal hills,  With grace and pardon in his hands,  And sends his covenant with the seals,  To bless the distant British lands.    3 \"Repent, and be baptiz'd, (he saith)  For the remission of your sins;\"  And thus our sense assists our faith,  And shews us what his gospel means.    4 Our souls he washes in his blood,  As water makes the body clean;  And the good Spirit from our God  Descends like purifying rain.    5 Thus we engage ourselves to thee,  And seal our covenant with the Lord:  O may the great eternal Three  In heaven our solemn vows record!      Hymn 1:53.  The Holy Scriptures, Heb. 1. 1 2. 2 Tim. 3. 15 16.  Psalm 147. 19 20.    1 God who in various methods told  His mind and will to saints of old,  Sent down his Son, with truth and grace,  To teach us in these latter days.    2 Our nation reads the written word,  That book of life, that sure record:  The bright inheritance of heaven  Is by the sweet conveyance given.    3 God's kindest thoughts are here express'd,  Able to make us wise and bless'd;  The doctrines are divinely true,  Fit for reproof, and comfort too.    4 Ye British isles, who read his love  In long epistles from above,  (He hath not sent his sacred word  To every land) Praise ye the Lord.      Hymn 1:54.  Electing grace; or, Saints beloved in Christ,  Eph. 1. 3 &c.    1 Jesus, we bless thy Father's Name;  Thy God and ours are both the same:  What heavenly blessings from his throne  Flow down to sinners thro' his Son!    2 \"Christ be my first elect,\" he said,  Then chose our souls in Christ our head,  Before he gave the mountains birth,  Or laid foundations for the earth.    3 Thus did eternal love begin  To raise us up from death and sin;  Our characters were then decreed,  \"Blameless in love, a holy seed.\"    4 Predestinated to be sons,  Born by degrees, but chose at once;  A new regenerated race  To praise the glory of his grace.    5 With Christ our Lord we share our part  In the affections of his heart,  Nor shall our souls be thence remov'd  Till he forgets his first belov'd.      Hymn 1:55.  Hesekiah's song; or, Sickness and recovery, Isa. 38.9 &c.    1 When we are rais'd from deep distress  Our God deserves a song;  We take the pattern of our praise  From Hezekiah's tongue.    2 The gates of the devouring grave  Are open'd wide in vain,  If he that holds the keys of death  Commands them fast again.    3 Pains of the flesh are wont t' abuse  Our minds with slavish fears,  \"Our days are past, and we shall lose  \"The remnant of our years.\"    4 We chatter with a swallow's voice,  Or like a dove we mourn,  With bitterness instead of joys,  Afflicted and forlorn.    5 Jehovah speaks the healing word,  And no disease withstands;  Fevers and plagues obey the Lord,  And fly at his commands.    6 If half the strings of life should break,  He can our frame restore;  He casts our sins behind his back,  And they are found no more.      Hymn 1:56.  The song of Moses and the Lamb; or, Babylon falling,  Rev. 15. 3. and chap. 16. 19. and 17. 6.    1 We sing the glories of thy love,  We sound thy dreadful Name;  The Christian church unites the songs  Of Moses and the Lamb.    2 Great God, how wondrous are thy works  Of vengeance and of grace!  Thou King of saints, Almighty Lord,  How just and true thy ways!    3 Who dares refuse to fear thy Name,  Or worship at thy throne?  Thy judgments speak thine holiness  Thro' all the nations known.    4 Great Babylon, that rules the earth,  Drunk with the martyrs' blood,  Her crimes shall speedily awake  The fury of our God.    5 The cup of wrath is ready mix'd,  And she must drink the dregs;  Strong is the Lord her sovereign Judge,  And shall fulfil the plagues.      Hymn 1:57.  Original sin; or, The first and second Adam,  Rom. 5. 12. Psalm 51. 5. Job 11. 4.    1 Backward with humble shame we look  On our original;  How is our nature dash'd and broke  In our first father's fall!    2 To all that's good averse and blind,  But prone to all that's ill  What dreadful darkness veils our mind!  How obstinate our will!    3 [Conceiv'd in sin (O wretched state!)  Before we draw our breath,  The first young pulse begins to beat  Iniquity and death.    4 How strong in our degenerate blood  The old corruption reigns,  And, mingling with the crooked flood,  Wanders thro' all our veins!]    5 Wild and unwholesome as the root  Will all the branches be;  How can we hope for living fruit  From such a deadly tree?    6 What mortal power from things unclean  Can pure productions bring?  Who can command a vital stream  From an infected spring?]    7 Yet, mighty God, thy wondrous love  Can make our nature clean,  While Christ and grace prevail above  The tempter, death, and sin.    8 The second Adam shall restore  The ruins of the first,  Hosanna to that sovereign power  That new creates our dust.      Hymn 1:58.  The devil vanquished; or, Michael's war with the  dragon, Rev. 12. 7.    1 Let mortal tongues attempt to sing  The wars of heaven, when Michael stood  Chief general of th' Eternal King,  And fought the battles of our God.    2 Against the dragon and his host  The armies of the Lord prevail:  In vain they rage, in vain they boast,  Their courage sinks, their weapons fail.    3 Down to the earth was Satan thrown,  Down to the earth his legions fell;  Then was the trump of triumph blown,  And shook the dreadful deeps of hell.    4 Now is the hour of darkness past,  Christ hath assum'd his reigning power;  Behold the great accuser cast  Down from the skies, to rise no more.    5 'Twas by thy blood immortal Lamb,  Thine armies trod the tempter down;  'Twas by thy word and powerful Name,  They gain'd the battle and renown.    6 Rejoice, ye heavens; let every star  Shine with new glories round the sky;  Saints, while ye sing the heavenly war,  Raise your Deliverer's name on high.

Babylon fallen, Rev. 18. 20 21.    1 In Gabriel's hand a mighty stone  Lies, a fair type of Babylon  ''Prophets, rejoice, and, all ye saints,  \"God shall avenge your long complaints.\"    2 He said, and dreadful as he stood,  He sunk the milstone in the flood:  \"Thus terribly shall Babel fall;  \"Thus, and no more be found at all.\"      Hymn 1:60.  The virgin Mary's song; or, The promised Messiah  born, Luke 1. 46 &c.    1 Our souls shall magnify the Lord,  In God the Saviour we rejoice;  While we repeat the Virgin's song,  May the same spirit tune our voice.    2 [The Highest saw her low estate,  And mighty things his hand hath done:  His overshadowing power and grace  Makes her the mother of his Son.    3 Let every nation call her bless'd,  And endless years prolong her fame;  But God alone must be ador'd;  Holy and reverend is his Name.]    4 To those that fear and trust the Lord  His mercy stands for ever sure:  From age to age his promise lives,  And the performance is secure.    5 He spake to Abr'am and his seed,  \"In thee shall all the earth be bless'd;\"  The memory of that ancient word  Lay long in his eternal breast.    6 But now no more shall Israel wait,  No more the Gentiles lie forlorn:  Lo the desire of nations comes,  Behold the promis'd seed is born.      Hymn 1:61.  Christ our high Priest and King, and Christ coming  to judgment, Rev. 1. 5 6 7.    1 Now to the Lord that makes us know  The wonders of his dying love,  Be humble honours paid below,  And strains of nobler praise above.    2 'Twas he that cleans'd our foulest sins,  And wash'd us in his richest blood;  'Tis he that makes us priests and kings,  And brings us rebels near to God.    3 To Jesus our atoning priest,  To Jesus our superior king,  Be everlasting power confess'd,  And every tongue his glory sing.    4 Behold, on flying clouds he comes,  And every eye shall see him move;  Tho' with our sins we pierc'd him once,  Then he displays his pardoning love.    5 The unbelieving world shall wail  While we rejoice to see the day:  Come, Lord; nor let thy promise fail,  Nor let thy chariots long delay.      Hymn 1:62.  Christ Jesus, the Lamb of God, worshipped by all  the creation, Rev. 5. 11 12 13.    1 Come let us join our cheerful songs  With angels round the throne;  Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,  But all their joys are one.    2 \"Worthy the Lamb that dy'd,\" they cry,  \"To be exalted thus:\"  \"Worthy the Lamb,\" our lips reply,  \"For he was slain for us.\"    3 Jesus is worthy to receive  Honour and power divine;  And blessings more than we can give,  Be, Lord, for ever thine.    4 Let all that dwell above the sky,  And air, and earth, and seas,  Conspire to lift thy glories high,  And speak thine endless praise.    5 The whole creation join in one  To bless the sacred Name  Of him that sits upon the throne,  And to adore the Lamb.      Hymn 1:63.  Christ's humiliation and exaltation, Rev. 5. 12.    1 What equal honours shall we bring  To thee, O Lord our God, the Lamb,  When all the notes that angels sing  Are far inferior to thy Name?    2 Worthy is he that once was slain,  The Prince of Peace that groan'd and dy'd,  Worthy to rise, and live, and reign  At his Almighty Father's side.    3 Power and dominion are his due,  Who stood condemn'd at Pilate's bar:  Wisdom belongs to Jesus too,  Tho' he was charg'd with madness here.    4 All riches are his native right,  Yet he sustain'd amazing loss:  To him ascribe eternal might,  Who left his weakness on the cross.    5 Honour immortal must be paid,  Instead of scandal and of scorn:  While glory shines around his head,  And a bright crown without a thorn.    6 Blessings for ever on the Lamb,  Who bore the curse for wretched men:  Let angels sound his sacred Name,  And every creature say, Amen.      Hymn 1:64.  Adoption, 1 John 3. 1 &c"]]]
