Other seeds are disseminated by animals; of  these some attach themselves to their hair or feathers by a gluten, as  misleto; others by hooks, as cleavers, burdock, hounds-tongue; and others  are swallowed whole for the sake of the fruit, and voided uninjured,  as the hawthorn, juniper, and some grasses. Other seeds again disperse  themselves by means of an elastic seed-vessel, as Oats, Geranium, and  Impatiens; and the seeds of aquatic plants, and of those which grow on  the banks of rivers, are carried many miles by the currents, into which  they fall.

As with sweet grace her snowy neck she bows,  240  A zone of diamonds trembles round her brows;          Bright shines the silver halo, as she turns;          And, as she steps, the living lustre burns.      [_Drosera_. l. 231. Sun-dew. Five males, five females. The leaves  of this marsh-plant are purple, and have a fringe very unlike other  vegetable productions. And, which is curious, at the point of every  thread of this erect fringe stands a pellucid drop of mucilage,  resembling a ducal coronet. This mucus is a secretion from certain  glands, and like the viscous material round the flower-stalks of Silene  (catchfly) prevents small insects from infesting the leaves. As the  ear-wax in animals seems to be in part designed to prevent fleas and  other insects from getting into their ears. See Silene. Mr. Wheatly, an  eminent surgeon in Cateaton-street, London, observed these leaves to bend  upwards, when an insect settled on them, like the leaves of the muscipula  veneris, and pointing all their globules of mucus to the centre, that  they compleatly intangled and destroyed it. M. Broussonet, in the Mem. de  l'Acad. des Sciences for the year 1784. p. 615. after hiving described  the motion of the Dionaea, adds, that a similar appearance has been  observed in the leaves of two species of Drosera.]              Fair LONICERA prints the dewy lawn,          And decks with brighter blush the vermil dawn;  245  Winds round the shadowy rocks, and pansied vales,          And scents with sweeter breath the summer-gales;      [_Lonicera_. l. 243. Caprifolium. Honeysuckle. Five males, one female.  Nature has in many flowers used a wonderful apparatus to guard the  nectary, or honey-gland, from insects. In the honey-suckle the petal  terminates in a long tube like a cornucopiae, or horn of plenty; and  the honey is produced at the bottom of it. In Aconitum, monkshood, the  nectaries stand upright like two horns covered with a hood, which abounds  with such acrid matter that no insects penetrate it. In Helleborus,  hellebore, the many nectaries are placed in a circle, like little  pitchers, and add much to the beauty of the flower. In the Columbine,  Aquilegia, the nectary is imagined to be like the neck and body of a  bird, and the two petals standing upon each side to represent wings;  whence its name of columbine, as if resembling a nest of young pigeons  fluttering whilst their parent feeds them. The importance of the nectary  in the economy of vegetation is explained at large in the notes on part  the first.    Many insects are provided with a long and pliant proboscis for the  purpose of acquiring this grateful food, as a variety of bees, moths, and  butterflies: but the Sphinx Convolvuli, or unicorn moth, is furnished  with the most remarkable proboscis in this climate. It carries it rolled  up in concentric circles under its chin, and occasionally extends it to  above three inches in length. This trunk consists of joints and muscles,  and seems to have more versatile movements than the trunk of the  elephant; and near its termination is split into two capillary tubes. The  excellence of this contrivance for robbing the flowers of their honey,  keeps this beautiful insect fat and bulky; though it flies only in the  evening, when the flowers have closed their petals, and are thence more  difficult of access; at the same time the brilliant colours of the moth  contribute to its safety, by making it mistaken by the late sleeping  birds for the flower it rests on.    Besides these there is a curious contrivance attending the Ophrys,  commonly called the Bee-orchis, and the Fly-orchis, with some kinds of  the Delphinium, called Bee-larkspurs, to preserve their honey; in these  the nectary and petals resemble in form and colour the insects, which  plunder them: and thus it may be supposed, they often escape these hourly  robbers, by having the appearance of being pre-occupied.

Four of these males stand above the other two; whence the name of  the class \"four powers.\" I have observed in several plants of this class,  that the two lower males arise, in a few-days after the opening of the  flower, to the same height as the other four, not being mature as soon  as the higher ones. See note on Gloriosa. All the plants of this class  possess similar virtues; they are termed acrid and anti corbutic in their  raw state, as mustard, watercress; when cultivated and boiled, they  become a mild wholesome food, as cabbage, turnep.

The Tillandsia, or  wild pine, grows on other trees, like the Misletoe, but takes little or  no nourishment from them, having large buckets in its leaves to collect  and retain the rain water. See note on Dypsacus. The mosses, which grow  on the bark of trees, take much nourishment from them; hence it is  observed that trees, which are annually cleared from moss by a brush,  grow nearly twice as fast. (Phil.

It grows at the bottom of the sea, and rising to the surface, when  in flower, covers many leagues; and is driven at length to the shore.

It seems necessary that the marriages of plants should be  celebrated in the open air, either because the powder of the anther, or  the mucilage on the stigma, or the  reservoir of honey might receive injury  from the water. Mr. Needham observed, that in the ripe dust of every  flower, examined by the microscope, some vesicles are perceived, from  which a fluid had escaped; and that those, which still retain it, explode  if they be wetted, like an eolopile suddenly exposed to a strong heat.

Put strings through the upper rim, fill the carrot cup with water, and  hang it up in a sunny window. Keep it constantly full of water. The  leaf-buds below will put forth, and grow into leafy shoots, which, turning  upwards, soon hide the vase in a green circle. This is because the dry,  starchy food stored in the carrot becomes soft and soluble, and the supply  of proper food and the warmth of the room make the leaf-buds able to grow.  It is also a pretty illustration of the way in which stems always grow  upward, even though there is enough light and air for them to grow  straight downwards. Why this is so, we do not know.      3. _Differences between the Stem and the Root.--_Ask the pupils to tell  what differences they have found.    _Stems_.                           _Roots_.    Ascend into the air.               Descend into the ground.  Grow by a succession of similar    Grow only from a point    parts, each part when young        just behind the tip.    elongating throughout.  Bear organs.                       Bear no organs.    There are certain exceptions to the statement that roots descend into the  ground; such as aerial roots and parasitic roots. The aerial roots of the  Ivy have been mentioned. Other examples of roots used for climbing are  the Trumpet Creeper _(Tecoma radicans)_, and the Poison Ivy _(Rhus  Toxicodendron)_. Parasitic roots take their food ready-made from the  plants into which they strike. The roots of air-plants, such as certain  orchids, draw their nourishment from the air.    The experiment of marking roots and stem has been already tried, but it  should be repeated. Repetition of experiments is always desirable, as it  fixes his conclusions in the pupil's mind. The stem grows by a succession  of similar parts, _phytomera_, each part, or _phyton_, consisting of node,  internode, and leaf. Thus it follows that stems must bear leaves. The  marked stems of seedlings show greater growth towards the top of the  growing phyton. It is only young stems that elongate throughout. The older  parts of a phyton grow little, and when the internode has attained a  certain length, variable for different stems and different conditions, it  does not elongate at all.    The root, on the contrary, grows only from a point just behind the tip.  The extreme tip consists of a sort of cap of hard tissue, called the  root-cap. Through a simple lens, or sometimes with the naked eye, it can  be distinguished in most of the roots of the seedlings, looking like a  transparent tip. \"The root, whatever its origin in any case may be, grows  in length only in one way; namely, at a point just behind its very  tip. This growing point is usually protected by a peculiar cap, which  insinuates its way through the crevices of the soil. If roots should grow  as stems escaping from the bud-state do,--that is, throughout their whole  length--they would speedily become distorted. But, since they grow at the  protected tips, they can make their way through the interstices of soil,  which from its compactness would otherwise forbid their progress.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Concerning a few Common Plants, p. 25.]    The third difference is that, while the stem bears leaves, and has buds  normally developed in their axils, roots bear no organs. The stem,  however, especially when wounded, may produce buds anywhere from the  surface of the bark, and these buds are called _adventitious_ buds. In the  same manner, roots occasionally produce buds, which grow up into leafy  shoots, as in the Apple and Poplar.[1]    [Footnote 1: See Gray's Structural Botany, p. 29.]    It should be made perfectly clear that the stem is the axis of the plant,  that is, it bears all the other organs. Roots grow from stems, not steins  from roots, except in certain cases, like that of the Poplar mentioned  above. This was seen in the study of the seedling. The embryo consisted of  stem and leaves, and the roots were produced from the stem as the seedling  grew.    For illustration of this point, the careful watching of the cuttings  placed in water will be very instructive. After a few days, small, hard  lumps begin to appear under the skin of the stem of the broken seedling  Bean. These gradually increase in size until, finally, they rupture the  skin and appear as rootlets. Roots are always thus formed under the outer  tissues of the stem from which they spring, or the root from which they  branch. In the Bean, the roots are in four long rows, quartering the stem.  This is because they are formed in front of the woody bundles of the stem,  which in the seedling Bean are four. In the Sunflower the roots divide the  circumference into six parts. In some of my cuttings of Beans, the stem  cracked in four long lines before the roots had really formed, showing the  parenchyma in small hillocks, so to speak. In these the gradual formation  of the root-cap could be watched throughout, with merely a small lens. I  do not know a better way to impress the nature of the root on the pupil's  mind. These forming roots might also be marked very early, and so be shown  to carry onward their root-cap on the growing-point.      4. _Root-hairs_. These are outgrowths of the epidermis, or skin of the  root, and increase its absorbing power. In most plants they cannot be seen  without the aid of a microscope. Indian Corn and Oats, however, show them  very beautifully, and the scholars have already noticed them in their  seedlings. They are best seen in the seedlings grown on damp sponge. In  those grown in sand, they become so firmly united to the particles of  soil, that they cannot be separated, without tearing the hairs away from  the plant. This will suggest the reason why plants suffer so much from  careless transplanting.    The root-hairs have the power of dissolving mineral matters in the soil  by the action of an acid which they give out. They then absorb these  solutions for the nourishment of the plant. The acid given out was first  thought to be carbonic acid, but now it is supposed by some experimenters  to be acetic acid, by others to vary according to the plant and the time.  The action can be shown by the following experiment, suggested by Sachs.    [Illustration: Fig. 12. I. Seedling of _Sinapis alba_ showing root-hairs.  II. Same, showing how fine particles of sand cling to the root-hairs.  (Sachs.)]    Cover a piece of polished marble with moist sawdust, and plant some seeds  upon it. When the seedlings are somewhat grown, remove the sawdust, and  the rootlets will be found to have left their autographs behind. Wherever  the roots, with their root-hairs have crept, they have eaten into the  marble and left it corroded. The marks will become more distinct if the  marble is rubbed with a little vermilion.    In order that the processes of solution and absorption may take place, it  is necessary that free oxygen should be present. All living things must  have oxygen to breathe, and this gas is as needful for the germination of  seeds, and the action of roots and leaves, as it is for our maintenance of  life. It is hurtful for plants to be kept with too much water about their  roots, because this keeps out the air. This is the reason why house-plants  are injured if they are kept too wet.    A secondary office of root-hairs is to aid the roots of seedlings to enter  the ground, as we have before noticed.    The root-hairs are found only on the young parts of roots. As a root grows  older the root-hairs die, and it becomes of no further use for absorption.  But it is needed now for another purpose, as the support of the growing  plant. In trees, the old roots grow from year to year like stems, and  become large and strong. The extent of the roots corresponds in a general  way to that of the branches, and, as the absorbing parts are the young  rootlets, the rain that drops from the leafy roof falls just where it is  needed by the delicate fibrils in the earth below.[1]    [Footnote 1: Reader in Botany. VI. The Relative Positions of Leaves and  Rootlets.]      5. _Comparison of a Carrot, an Onion, and a Potato_.--It is a good  exercise for a class to take a potato, an onion, and a carrot or radish to  compare, writing out the result of their observations.    The carrot is a fleshy root, as we have already seen. The onion consists  of the fleshy bases of last year's leaves, sheathed by the dried remains  of the leaves of former years, from which all nourishment has been drawn.  The parallel veining of the leaves is distinctly marked. The stem is a  plate at the base, to which these fleshy scales are attached. In the  centre, or in the axils of the scales, the newly-forming bulbs can be  seen, in onions that are sprouting. If possible, compare other bulbs, as  those of Tulip, Hyacinth, or Snowdrop, and the bulb of a Crocus, in which  the fleshy part consists of the thickened base of the stem, and the leaves  are merely dry scales. This is called a _corm_.    The potato is a thickened stem. It shows itself to be a stem, because it  bears organs. The leaves are reduced to little scales (eyelids), in the  axils of which come the buds (eyes). The following delightful experiment  has been recommended to me.    In a growing potato plant, direct upwards one of the low shoots and  surround it with a little cylinder of stiff carpet paper, stuffed with  sphagnum and loam. Cut away the other tuber-disposed shoots as they  appear. The enclosed shoot develops into a tuber which stands more or less  vertical, and the scales become pretty little leaves. Removing the paper,  the tuber and leaves become green, and the latter enlarge a little. A  better illustration of the way in which organs adapt themselves to their  conditions, and of the meaning of morphology, could hardly be found.    _Gray's First Lessons_.
