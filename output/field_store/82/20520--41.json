After King Arthur had so dubbed Sir Launcelot knight, it was time that  those two parties should part company--to wit, the party of the Lady of the  Lake and the party of King Arthur. But when they were about to leave one  another the Lady of the Lake took Sir Launcelot aside, and she spake to him  after this manner:    [Sidenote: The Lady of the Lake gives Sir Launcelot good advice]  \"Launcelot, forget not that you are a king's son, and that your lineage is  as noble as that of anyone upon earth--for so I have often told you  aforetime. Wherefore, see to it that your worthiness shall be as great as  your beauty, and that your courtesy and gentleness shall be as great as  your prowess. To-day you shall go unto Camelot with King Arthur to make  yourself known unto that famous Court of Chivalry. But do not tarry there,  but, ere the night cometh, depart and go forth into the world to prove your  knighthood as worthily as God shall give you grace to do. For I would not  have you declare yourself to the world until you have proved your  worthiness by your deeds. Wherefore, do not yourself proclaim your name,  but wait until the world proclaimeth it; for it is better for the world to  proclaim the worthiness of a man than that the man should proclaim his own  worthiness. So hold yourself ready to undertake any adventure whatsoever  that God sendeth to you to do, but never let any other man complete a task  unto which you yourself have set your hand.\" Then, after the Lady of the  Lake had so advised Sir Launcelot, she kissed him upon the face, and  therewith gave him a ring curiously wrought and set with a wonderful purple  stone, which ring had such power that it would dissolve every enchantment.  Then she said: \"Launcelot, wear this ring and never let it be from off your  finger.\" And Launcelot said: \"I will do so.\" So Sir Launcelot set the ring  upon his finger and it was so that it never left his finger whilst he drew  the breath of life.    Then King Arthur and Sir Ewain and Sir Ector de Maris and the young Sir  Launcelot laid their ways toward Camelot. And, as they journeyed so  together, Sir Ewain communicated privily to Sir Ector de Maris how that the  youth had a mark as of a golden star upon the skin of his shoulder, and  upon this news Sir Ector fell very silent. For Sir Ector knew that that  sign was upon his own brother's shoulder, and he did not know how it could  be upon the shoulder of any other man. Wherefore, he wist not what to think  that it should be upon the shoulder of this youth. But he said naught of  these thoughts to Sir Ewain, but held his peace.    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot cometh to Camelot] So they reached Camelot whilst  it was still quite early in the morning and all they who were there made  great joy at the coming of so wonderfully fair and noble a young knight as  Sir Launcelot appeared to be. Wherefore, there was great sound of rejoicing  at his coming.    Then, after a while, King Arthur said: \"Let us go and see if, haply, this  youth's name is marked upon any of the seats of the Round Table, for I  think it should be there.\" So all they of the court went to that pavilion  afore described, where the Round Table was established, and they looked;  and lo! upon the seat that King Pellinore had one time occupied was this  name:    THE KNIGHT OF THE LAKE    So the name stood at first, nor did it change until the name of Sir  Launcelot of the Lake became so famous in all the world. Then it became  changed to this:    SIR LAUNCELOT OF THE LAKE.           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: Sir Launcelot becometh knight of the Round Table] So Sir  Launcelot remained at Camelot for that entire day and was made acquainted  with a great many of the lords and ladies and knights and dames of King  Arthur's court. And all that while he was like one that walked in a dream,  for he had never before beheld anything of the world of mankind since he  had been carried away into the lake, wherefore he wist not very well  whether what he saw was real or whether he beheld it in a vision of  enchantment. For it was all very new and wonderful to him and he took great  delight in it because that he was a man and because this world was the  world of mankind. Wherefore, though that Castle of the Lake was so  beautiful, yet he felt his heart go forth to this other and less beautiful  land as it did not go forth to that, because he was human and this was  human.    Nevertheless, though that was so joyful a day for him, yet Sir Launcelot  did not forget what the Lady of the Lake had said concerning the time he  was to abide there! Wherefore, when it drew toward evening he besought  leave of King Arthur to depart from that place in search of adventures, and  King Arthur gave him leave to do as he desired.    So Sir Launcelot prepared to depart, and whilst he was in his chamber  making ready there came in unto him Sir Ector de Maris. And Sir Ector said  unto him: \"Sir, I prithee tell me--is it true that you bear upon your right  shoulder a mark like unto a golden star?\" And Sir Launcelot made reply:  \"Yea, that is true.\" Then Sir Ector said: \"I beseech you to tell me if your  name is Launcelot.\" And Sir Launcelot said: \"Yea, that is my name.\"    [Sidenote: Of the brotherhood of Sir Ector and Sir Launcelot] Upon this  Sir Ector broke out into great weeping and he catched Sir Launcelot in his  arms and he cried out: \"Launcelot, thou art mine own brother! For thy  father was my father, and my mother was thy mother! For we are both sons  unto King Ban of Benwick, and Queen Helen was our mother.\" Therewith he  kissed Sir Launcelot with great passion upon the face. And Sir Launcelot  upon his part kissed Sir Ector with a great passion of joy that he had  found a brother in this strange world into which he had so newly come. But  Sir Launcelot charged Sir Ector that he should say nothing of this to any  man; and Sir Ector pledged his knightly word to that effect. (Nor did he  ever tell anyone who Sir Launcelot was until Sir Launcelot had performed  such deeds that all the world spake his name.)    For when Sir Launcelot went out into the world in that wise he undertook  several very weighty achievements and brought them all to a successful  issue, so that his name very quickly became known in every court of  chivalry.    [Sidenote: Of sundry adventures of Sir Launcelot] First he removed an  enchantment that overhung a castle, hight Dolorous Gard; and he freed that  castle and liberated all the sad, sorry captives that lay therein. (And  this castle he held for his own and changed the name from Dolorous Gard to  Joyous Gard and the castle became very famous afterward as his best-loved  possession. For this was the first of all his possessions that he won by  the prowess of his arms and he loved it best of all and considered it  always his home.) After that Sir Launcelot, at the bidding of Queen  Guinevere, took the part of the Lady of Nohan against the King of  Northumberland, and he overcame the King of Northumberland and made him  subject unto King Arthur. Then he overcame Sir Gallehaut, King of the  Marches, and sent him captive to the court of King Arthur (and afterward  Sir Gallehaut and Sir Launcelot became great friends for aye). So in a  little while all the world spoke of Sir Launcelot, for it was said of him,  and truly, that he had never been overcome by any other knight, whether  upon horseback or upon foot, and that he always succeeded in every  adventure which he undertook, whether that adventure were great or whether  it were small. So it was as the Lady of the Lake desired it to be, for Sir  Launcelot's name became famous, not because he was his father's son, but  because of the deeds which he performed upon his own account.    So Sir Launcelot performed all these famous adventures, and after that he  returned again to the court of King Arthur crowned with the glory of his  successful knighthood, and there he was received with joy and acclaim and  was duly installed in that seat of the Round Table that was his. And in  that court he was held in the greatest honor and esteem of all the knights  who were there. For King Arthur spake many times concerning him to this  effect: that he knew not any honor or glory that could belong to a king  greater than having such a knight for to serve him as was Sir Launcelot of  the Lake. For a knight like Sir Launcelot came hardly ever into the world,  and when he did come his glory must needs illuminate with its effulgence  the entire reign of that king whose servant he was.    So it was that Sir Launcelot was greatly honored by everybody at the court  of King Arthur, and he thereafter abided at that court for the most part of  his life.           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: Of Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere] And now I must needs make  mention of that friendship that existed betwixt Sir Launcelot and Queen  Guinevere, for after he thus returned to the court of the king, they two  became such friends that no two people could be greater friends than they  were.    Now I am aware that there have been many scandalous things said concerning  that friendship, but I do not choose to believe any such evil sayings. For  there are always those who love to think and say evil things of others. Yet  though it is not to be denied that Sir Launcelot never had for his lady any  other dame than the Lady Guinevere, still no one hath ever said with truth  that she regarded Sir Launcelot otherwise than as her very dear friend. For  Sir Launcelot always avouched with his knightly word, unto the last day of  his life, that the Lady Guinevere was noble and worthy in all ways,  wherefore I choose to believe his knightly word and to hold that what he  said was true. For did not he become an hermit, and did not she become a  nun in their latter days, and were they not both broken of heart when King  Arthur"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10751"],[0,"Oregon, Washington and Alaska; Sights and Scenes for the Tourist (#6)"],[1,"mon--he talked with  tamanous. And always his question was, 'How may I put hiaqua in my  purse?' But never had Tamanous revealed to him the secret. There loomed  Tacoma, so white and glittering that it seemed to stare at him very  terribly and mockingly, and to know of his shameful avarice, and how it  led him to take from starving women their cherished lip and nose jewels  of hiaqua, and give them in return tough scraps of dried elk-meat and  salmon. His own peculiar tamanous was the elk. One day he was hunting  on the sides of Tacoma, and in that serene silence his tamanous began  to talk to his soul. 'Listen!' said tamanous--and then the great secret  of untold wealth was revealed to him. He went home and made his  preparations, told his old, ill-treated squaw he was going for a long  hunt, and started off at eventide. The next night he camped just below  the snows of Tacoma, but sunrise and he struck the summit together, for  there, tamanous had revealed to him, was hiaqua--hiaqua that should  make him the greatest and richest of his tribe. He looked down and saw  a hollow covered with snow, save at the centre, where a black lake lay  deep in a well of purple rock, and at one end of the lake were three  large stones or monuments. Down into the crater sprang the miser, and  the morning sunshine followed him. He found the first stone shaped like  a salmon head; the second like a kamas root, and the third, to his  great joy, was the carven image of an elk's head. This was his own  tamanous, and right joyous was he at the omen, so taking his elk-horn  pick he began to dig right sturdily at the foot of the monument. At the  sound of the very first blow he made, thirteen gigantic otters came out  of the black lake and, sitting in a circle, watched him. And at every  thirteenth blow they tapped the ground with their tails in concert The  miser heeded them not, but labored lustily for hours. At last,  overturning a thin scale of rock, he found a square cavity filled to  the brim with hiaqua.    \"He was a millionaire.    \"The otters retired to a respectful distance, recognizing him as a  favorite of Tamanous.    \"He reveled in the treasure, exulting. Deep as he could plunge his arm,  there was still more hiaqua below. It was strung upon elk sinews, fifty  shells on a string. But he saw the noon was passed, so he prepared to  depart. He loaded himself with countless strings of hiaqua, by fifties  and hundreds, so that he could scarcely stagger along. Not a string did  he hang on the tamanous of the elk, or the salmon, or the kamas--not  one--but turned eagerly toward his long descent. At once all the otters  plunged back into the lake and began to beat the waters with their tails;  a thick, black mist began to rise threateningly. Terrible are the storms  in the mountains--and Tamanous was in this one. Instantly the fierce  whirlwind overtook the miser. He was thrown down and flung over icy  banks, but he clung to his precious burden. Utter night was around him,  and in every crash and thunder of the gale was a growing undertone which  he well knew to be the voice of Tamanous. Floating upon this undertone  were sharper tamanous voices, shouting and screaming, always sneeringly,  'Ha, ha, hiaqua!--ha, ha, ha!' Whenever the miser attempted to continue  his descent the whirlwind caught him and tossed him hither and thither,  flinging him into a pinching crevice, burying him to the eyes in a snow  drift, throwing him on jagged boulders, or lacerating him on sharp lava  jaws. But he held fast to his hiaqua. The blackness grew ever deeper and  more crowded with perdition; the din more impish, demoniac, and devilish;  the laughter more appalling; and the miser more and more exhausted with  vain buffeting. He at last thought to propitiate exasperated Tamanous,  and threw away a string of hiaqua. But the storm was renewed blacker,  louder, crueler than before. String by string he parted with his  treasure, until at the last, sorely wounded, terrified, and weak, with a  despairing cry, he cast from him the last vestige of wealth, and sank  down insensible.    [Illustration: ROOSTER ROCK, COLUMBIA RIVER, ORE. On the Union Pacific  Ry.]    \"It seemed a long slumber to him, but at last he woke. He was upon the  very spot whence he started at morning. He felt hungry, and made a  hearty breakfast of the chestnut-like bulbs of the kamas root, and took  a smoke. Reflecting on the events of yesterday, he became aware of an  odd change in his condition. He was not bruised and wounded, as he  expected, but very stiff only, and his joints creaked like the creak of  a lazy paddle on the rim of a canoe. His hair was matted and reached a  yard down his back. 'Tamanous,' thought the old man. But chiefly he was  conscious of a mental change. He was calm and content. Hiaqua and  wealth seemed to have lost their charm for him. Tacoma, shining like  gold and silver and precious stones of gayest lustre, seemed a benign  comrade and friend. All the outer world was cheerful, and he thought  he had never wakened to a fresher morning. He rose and started on  his downward way, but the woods seemed strangely transformed since  yesterday; just before sunset he came to the prairie where his lodge  used to be; he saw an old squaw near the door crooning a song; she was  decked with many strings of hiaqua and costly beads. It was his wife;  and she told him he had been gone many, many years--she could not tell  how many; that she had remained faithful and constant to him, and  distracted her mind from the bitterness of sorrow by trading in kamas  and magic herbs, and had thus acquired a genteel competence. But little  cared the sage for such things; he, was rejoiced to be at home and at  peace, and near his own early gains of hiaqua and treasure buried in  a place of security. He imparted whatever he possessed--material  treasures or stores of wisdom and experience--freely to all the land.  Every dweller came to him for advice how to spear the salmon, chase the  elk, or propitiate Tamanous. He became the great medicine man of the  Siwashes and a benefactor to his tribe and race. Within a year after he  came down from his long nap on the side of Tacoma, a child, my father,  was born to him. The sage lived many years, revered and beloved, and on  his death-bed told this history to my father as a lesson and a warning.  My father dying, told it to me. But I, alas! have no son; I grow old,  and lest this wisdom perish from the earth, and Tamanous be again  obliged to interpose against avarice, I tell the tale to thee, O Boston  tyee. Mayst thou and thy nation not disdain this lesson of an earlier  age, but profit by it and be wise!\"    So far the Siwash recounted his legend without the palisades of Fort  Nisqually, and motioning, in expressive pantomime, at the close, that he  was dry with big talk and would gladly \"wet his whistle.\"    The town of Tacoma contains about 15,000 inhabitants, and is in a highly  prosperous condition. From here one may start on the grand Alaskan tour,  winding up through all the wonders of sound and strait, bay and ocean, to  the far North summerland--a trip of most entrancing interest. The return  from Tacoma to Portland may be made by either rail or boat.    So much has already been said in preceding pages about Puget Sound that  it would seem the subject might be somewhat overdone. But it still  remains to be said that justice can never be done to the scenic glories  of this beautiful inland sea. The views from different points, and from  almost every point on the Sound, are of sublime grandeur. On the east are  the Cascade Mountains, ranging from 5,000 to 14,444 feet in height, Mount  Rainier for Tacoma, (as it is also called) being of the latter altitude,  and only third in height of the mountains of the United States. On the  west are the Olympic Mountains, the highest peaks of which reach up to  8,000 feet. Both ranges, brilliantly snow-crowned, are within view at the  same time from various points, and the scenery in its entirety, with its  continual changefulness and features of sublimity, can not be excelled.  Strangers and travelers who have visited every part of the world never  leave the deck of the steamers while going through the waters of the  Sound country. In noting a single feature, Mount Rainier, Senator George  F. Edmunds wrote as follows: \"I have been through the Swiss mountains,  and am compelled to own that there is no comparison between the finest  effects exhibited there and what is seen in approaching this grand and  isolated mountain. I would be willing to go 500 miles again to see that  scene. The Continent is yet in ignorance of what will be one of the  grandest show places, as well as sanitariums. If Switzerland is rightly  called the play-ground of Europe, I am satisfied that around the base of  Mt. Rainier will become a prominent place of resort, not for America  only, but for the world besides, with thousands of sites for building  purposes that are nowhere excelled for the grandeur of the view that can  be obtained from them, with topographical features that would make the  most perfect system of drainage both possible and easy, and with a most  agreeable and health-giving climate.\"    A more enthusiastic writer says: \"Puget Sound scenery is the grandest  scenery in the world. One has here in combination the sublimity of  Switzerland, the picturesqueness of the Rhine, the rugged beauty of  Norway, the breezy variety of the Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence,  or the Hebrides of the North Sea, the soft, rich-toned skies of Italy,  the pastoral landscape of England, with velvet meadows and magnificent  groves, massed with floral bloom, and the blending tints and bold color  of the New England Indian summer. Features with which nothing within the  vision of another city can be placed in comparison are the Olympic range  of mountains in front of Seattle, and the sublime snow peaks of the  Rainier,"]]]
