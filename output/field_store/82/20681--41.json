So  the alderman said to himself:    \"'Twill be time to make up to them when the sun sets and the company  disperses then I will take my poor relations to my house, and none will  be the wiser.\"    Half the courses were lost on Gerard and Margaret. They were no great  eaters, and just now were feeding on sweet thoughts that have ever been  unfavourable to appetite. But there is a delicate kind of sensuality,  to whose influence these two were perhaps more sensitive than any other  pair in that assembly--the delights of colour, music, and perfume, all  of which blended so fascinatingly here.    Margaret leaned back and half closed her eyes, and murmured to Gerard:  \"What a lovely scene! the warm sun, the green shade, the rich dresses,  the bright music of the lutes and the cool music of the fountain, and  all faces so happy and gay! and then, it is to you we owe it.\"    Gerard was silent all but his eyes; observing which--    \"Now, speak not to me,\" said Margaret languidly; \"let me listen to the  fountain: what are you a competitor for?\"    He told her.    \"Very well! You will gain one prize, at least.\"    \"Which? which? have you seen any of my work?\"    \"I? no. But you will gain a prize.    \"I hope so; but what makes you think so?\"    \"Because you were so good to my father.\"    Gerard smiled at the feminine logic, and hung his head at the sweet  praise, and was silent.    \"Speak not,\" murmured Margaret. \"They say this is a world of sin and  misery. Can that be? What is your opinion?\"    \"No! that is all a silly old song,\" explained Gerard. \"'Tis a byword our  elders keep repeating, out of custom: it is not true.\"    \"How can you know? You are but a child,\" said Margaret, with pensive  dignity.    \"Why, only look round! And then thought I had lost you for ever; and you  are by my side; and now the minstrels are going to play again. Sin and  misery? Stuff and nonsense!\"    The lutes burst out. The courtyard rang again with their delicate  harmony.    \"What do you admire most of all these beautiful things, Gerard?\"    \"You know my name? How is that?\"    \"White magic. I am a--witch.\"    \"Angels are never witches. But I can't think how you--\"    \"Foolish boy! was it not cried at the gate loud enough to deave one?\"    \"So it was. Where is my head? What do I admire most? If you will sit a  little more that way, I'll tell you.\"    \"This way?\"    \"Yes; so that the light may fall on you. There! I see many fair things  here, fairer than I could have conceived; but the fairest of all, to  my eye, is your lovely hair in its silver frame, and the setting sun  kissing it. It minds me of what the Vulgate praises for beauty, 'an  apple of gold in a network of silver,' and oh, what a pity I did not  know you before I sent in my poor endeavours at illuminating! I could  illuminate so much better now. I could do everything better. There, now  the sun is full on it, it is like an aureole. So our Lady looked, and  none since her until to-day.\"    \"Oh, fie! it is wicked to talk so. Compare a poor, coarse-favoured girl  like me with the Queen of Heaven? Oh, Gerard! I thought you were a good  young man.\" And Margaret was shocked apparently.    Gerard tried to explain. \"I am no worse than the rest; but how can I  help having eyes, and a heart Margaret!\"    \"Gerard!\"    \"Be not angry now!\"    \"Now, is it likely?\"    \"I love you.\"    \"Oh, for shame! you must not say that to me,\" and Margaret coloured  furiously at this sudden assault.    \"I can't help it. I love you. I love you.\"    \"Hush, hush! for pity's sake! I must not listen to such words from a  stranger. I am ungrateful to call you a stranger. Oh! how one may be  mistaken! If I had known you were so bold--\" And Margaret's bosom began  to heave, and her cheeks were covered with blushes, and she looked  towards her sleeping father, very much like a timid thing that meditates  actual flight.    Then Gerard was frightened at the alarm he caused. \"Forgive me,\" said he  imploringly. \"How could any one help loving you?\"    \"Well, sir, I will try and forgive you--you are so good in other  respects; but then you must promise me never to say you--to say that  again.\"    \"Give me your hand then, or you don't forgive me.\"    She hesitated; but eventually put out her hand a very little way, very  slowly, and with seeming reluctance. He took it, and held it prisoner.  When she thought it had been there long enough, she tried gently to draw  it away. He held it tight: it submitted quite patiently to force.  What is the use resisting force. She turned her head away, and her long  eyelashes drooped sweetly. Gerard lost nothing by his promise. Words  were not needed here; and silence was more eloquent. Nature was in that  day what she is in ours; but manners were somewhat freer. Then as now,  virgins drew back alarmed at the first words of love; but of prudery  and artificial coquetry there was little, and the young soon read one  another's hearts. Everything was on Gerard's side, his good looks, her  belief in his goodness, her gratitude; and opportunity for at the Duke's  banquet this mellow summer eve, all things disposed the female nature  to tenderness: the avenues to the heart lay open; the senses were so  soothed and subdued with lovely colours, gentle sounds, and delicate  odours; the sun gently sinking, the warm air, the green canopy, the cool  music of the now violet fountain.    Gerard and Margaret sat hand in hand in silence; and Gerard's eyes  sought hers lovingly; and hers now and then turned on him timidly and  imploringly and presently two sweet unreasonable tears rolled down her  cheeks, and she smiled while they were drying: yet they did not take  long.    And the sun declined; and the air cooled; and the fountain plashed more  gently; and the pair throbbed in unison and silence, and this weary  world looked heaven to them.         Oh, the merry days, the merry days when we were young.       Oh, the merry days, the merry days when we were young.        CHAPTER III    A grave white-haired seneschal came to their table, and inquired  courteously whether Gerard Eliassoen was of their company. Upon Gerard's  answer, he said:    \"The Princess Marie would confer with you, young sir; I am to conduct  you to her presence.\"    Instantly all faces within hearing turned sharp round, and were bent  with curiosity and envy on the man that was to go to a princess.    Gerard rose to obey.    \"I wager we shall not see you again,\" said Margaret calmly, but  colouring a little.    \"That you will,\" was the reply: then he whispered in her ear: \"This is  my good princess; but you are my queen.\" He added aloud: \"Wait for me, I  pray you, I will presently return.\"    \"Ay, ay!\" said Peter, awaking and speaking at one and the same moment.    Gerard gone, the pair whose dress was so homely, yet they were with the  man whom the Princess sent for, became \"the cynosure of neighbouring  eyes;\" observing which, William Johnson came forward, acted surprise,  and claimed his relations.    \"And to think that there was I at your backs, and you saw me not\"    \"Nay, cousin Johnson, I saw you long syne,\" said Margaret coldly.    \"You saw me, and spoke not to me?\"    \"Cousin, it was for you to welcome us to Rotterdam, as it is for us  to welcome you at Sevenbergen. Your servant denied us a seat in your  house.\"    \"The idiot!\"    \"And I had a mind to see whether it was 'like maid like master:' for  there is sooth in bywords.\"    William Johnson blushed purple. He saw Margaret was keen, and suspected  him. He did the wisest thing under the circumstances, trusted to deeds  not words. He insisted on their coming home with him at once, and he  would show them whether they were welcome to Rotterdam or not.    \"Who doubts it, cousin? Who doubts it?\" said the scholar.    Margaret thanked him graciously, but demurred to go just now: said  she wanted to hear the minstrels again. In about a quarter of an hour  Johnson renewed his proposal, and bade her observe that many of the  guests had left. Then her real reason came out.    \"It were ill manners to our friend; and he will lose us. He knows not  where we lodge in Rotterdam, and the city is large, and we have parted  company once already.\"    \"Oh!\" said Johnson, \"we will provide for that. My young man, ahem!  I mean my secretary, shall sit here and wait, and bring him on to my  house: he shall lodge with me and with no other.\"    \"Cousin, we shall be too burdensome.\"    \"Nay, nay; you shall see whether you are welcome or not, you and your  friends, and your friends' friends, if need be; and I shall hear what  the Princess would with him.\"    Margaret felt a thrill of joy that Gerard should be lodged under the  same roof with her; then she had a slight misgiving.    \"But if your young man should be thoughtless, and go play, and Gerard  miss him?\"    \"He go play? He leave that spot where I put him, and bid him stay? Ho!  stand forth, Hans Cloterman.\"    A figure clad in black serge and dark violet hose arose, and took two  steps and stood before them without moving a muscle: a solemn, precise  young man, the very statue of gravity and starched propriety. At his  aspect Margaret, being very happy, could hardly keep her countenance.  But she whispered Johnson, \"I would put my hand in the fire for him. We  are at your command, cousin, as soon as you have given him his orders.\"    Hans was then instructed to sit at the table and wait for Gerard, and  conduct him to Ooster-Waagen Straet. He replied, not in words, but  by calmly taking the seat indicated, and Margaret, Peter, and William  Johnson went away together.    \"And, indeed, it is time you were abed, father, after all your travel,\"  said Margaret. This had been in her mind all along.    Hans Cloterman sat waiting for Gerard, solemn and businesslike. The  minutes flew by, but excited no impatience in that perfect young man.  Johnson did him no more than justice when he laughed to scorn"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13665"],[0,"War in the Garden of Eden (#6)"],[1,"an hour's  sleep. The greater part of the year in Mesopotamia the regulation army  dress consisted of a tunic and \"shorts.\" These are long trousers cut off  just above the knee, and the wearer may either use wrap puttees, or  leather leggings, or golf stockings. They are a great help in the heat,  as may easily be understood, and they allow, of course, much freer knee  action, particularly when your clothes are wet. The reverse side of the  medal reads that when you try to sleep without a blanket on a cold night,  you find that your knees are uncomfortably exposed. Still we were, most of  us, so drunk with sleep that it would have taken more than that to keep us  awake. At three we resumed our march, and attacked just at dawn. The enemy  had abandoned the first-line positions, and we met with but little  resistance in the second. Our cavalry, which was concentrated at several  points in nullahs (dry river-beds), suffered at the hands of the hostile  aircraft. The Turk had evidently determined to fall back to Tekrit without  putting up a serious defense. They certainly could have given us a much  worse time than they did, for they had dug in well and scientifically.  Among the prisoners we took there were some that proved to be very worth  while. These Turkish officers were, as a whole a good lot--well dressed  and well educated. Many spoke French. There is an excellent gunnery school  at Constantinople, and one of the officers we captured had been a senior  instructor there for many years. We had with us among our intelligence  officers a Captain Bettelheim, born in Constantinople of Belgian  parentage. He had served with the Turks against the Italians and with the  British against the Boers. This gunnery officer turned out to be an old  comrade of his in the Italian War. Many of the officers we got knew him,  for he had been chief of police in Constantinople. Apparently none of them  bore him the slightest ill-will when they found him serving against them.    Among the supplies we captured at Daur were a lot of our own rifles and  ammunition that the Arabs had stolen and sold to the Turks. It was  impossible to entirely stop this, guard our dumps as best we could. On  dark nights they would creep right into camp, and it was never safe to  have the hospital barges tie up to the banks for the night on their way  down the river. On many occasions the Arabs crawled aboard and finished  off the wounded. There was only one thing to be said for the Arab, and  that was that he played no favorite, but attacked, as a rule, whichever  side came handier. We were told, and I believe it to be true, that during  the fighting at Sunnaiyat the Turks sent over to know if we would agree  to a three days' truce, during which time we should join forces against  the Arabs, who were watching on the flank to pick off stragglers or ration  convoys.    That night we bivouacked at Daur, and were unmolested except for the enemy  aircraft that came over and \"laid eggs.\" Next morning we advanced on  Tekrit. Our orders were to make a feint, and if we found that the Turk  meant to stay and fight it out seriously, we were to fall back. Some  gazelles got into the no man's land between us and the Turk, and in the  midst of the firing ran gracefully up the line, stopping every now and  then to stare about in amazement. Later on in the Argonne forest in France  we had the same thing happen with some wild boars. The enemy seemed in no  way inclined to evacuate Tekrit, so in accordance with instructions we  returned to our previous night's encampment at Daur. On the way back we  passed an old \"arabana,\" a Turkish coupe, standing abandoned in the  desert, with a couple of dead horses by it. It may have been used by some  Turkish general in the retreat of two days before. It was the sort of  coupe one associates entirely with well-kept parks and crowded city  streets, and the incongruity of its lonely isolation amid the sand-dunes  caused an amused ripple of comment.    Our instructions were to march back to Samarra early next morning, but  shortly before midnight orders came through from General Maude for us to  advance again upon Tekrit and take it. Next day we halted and took stock  in view of the new orders. The cavalry again suffered at the hands of the  Turkish aircraft. I went to corps headquarters in the afternoon, and a  crowd of \"red tabs,\" as the staff-officers were called, were seated around  a little table having the inevitable tea. A number of the generals had  come in to discuss the plan of attack for the following day. Suddenly a  Turk aeroplane made its appearance, flying quite low, and dropping bombs  at regular intervals. It dropped two, and then a third on a little hill in  a straight line from the staff conclave. It looked as if the next would be  a direct hit, and the staff did the only wise thing, and took cover as  flat on the ground as nature would allow; but the Hun's spacing was bad,  and the next bomb fell some little way beyond. I remember our glee at  what we regarded as a capital joke on the staff. The line-officer's humor  becomes a trifle robust where the \"gilded staff\" is concerned,  notwithstanding the fact that most staff-officers have seen active and  distinguished service in the line.    Our anti-aircraft guns--\"Archies\" we called them--were mounted on trucks,  and on account of their weight had some difficulty getting up. I shall not  soon forget our delight when they lumbered into view, for although I never  happened personally to see an aeroplane brought down by an \"Archie,\" there  was no doubt about it but that they did not bomb us with the same  equanimity when our anti-aircrafts were at hand.    [Illustration: Captured Turkish camel corps]    That night we marched out on Tekrit, and as dawn was breaking were ready  to attack. As the mist cleared, an alarming but ludicrous sight met our  eyes. On the extreme right some caterpillar tractors hauling our \"heavies\"  were advancing straight on Tekrit, as if they had taken themselves for  tanks. They were not long in discovering their mistake, and amid a mixed  salvo they clumsily turned and made off at their best pace, which was not  more than three miles an hour. Luckily, they soon got under some  excellent defilade, but not until they had suffered heavily.    Our artillery did some good work, but while we were waiting to attack we  suffered rather heavily. We had to advance over a wide stretch of open  country to reach the Turkish first lines. By nightfall the second line of  trenches was practically all in our hands. Meanwhile the cavalry had  circled way around the flank up-stream of Tekrit to cut the enemy off if  he attempted to retreat. The town is on the right bank of the Tigris, and  we had a small force that had come up from Samarra on the left bank, for  we had no means of ferrying troops across. Our casualties during the day  had amounted to about two thousand. The Seaforths had suffered heavily,  but no more so than some of the native regiments. In Mesopotamia there  were many changes in the standing of the Indian battalions. The  Maharattas, for instance, had never previously been regarded as anything  at all unusual, but they have now a very distinguished record to take  pride in. The general feeling was that the Gurkhas did not quite live up  to their reputation. But the Indian troops as a whole did so exceedingly  well that there is little purpose in making comparisons amongst them. At  this time, so I was informed, the Expeditionary Force, counting all  branches, totalled about a million, and a very large percentage of this  came from India. We drew our supplies from India and Australia, and it is  interesting to note that we preferred the Australian canned beef and  mutton (bully beef and bully mutton, as it was called) to the American.    At dusk the fighting died down, and we were told to hold on and go over at  daybreak. As I was making my way back to headquarters a general pounced  upon me and told me to get quickly into a car and go as rapidly as  possible to Daur to bring up a motor ration-convoy with fodder for the  cavalry horses and food for the riders. A Ford car happened to pass by,  and he stopped it and shoved me in, with some last hurried injunction. It  was quite fifteen miles back, and the country was so cut up by nullahs or  ravines that in most places it was inadvisable to leave the road, which  was, of course, jammed with a double stream of transport of every  description. When we were three or four miles from Daur a tire blew out.  The driver had used his last spare, so there was nothing to do but keep  going on the rim. The car was of the delivery-wagon type--\"pill-boxes\"  were what they were known as--and while we were stopped taking stock I  happened to catch sight of a good-sized bedding-roll behind. \"Some one's  out of luck,\" said I to the driver; \"whose roll is it?\" \"The corps  commander's, sir,\" was his reply. After exhausting my limited vocabulary,  I realized that it was far too late to stop another motor and send this  one back, so I just kept going. Across the bed of one more ravine, the  sand up to the hubs, and we were in the Daur camp. I managed to rank some  one out of a spare tire and started back again. My driver proved unable to  drive at night, at all events at a pace that would put us anywhere before  dawn, so I was forced to take the wheel. By the time I had the convoy  properly located I was rather despondent of the corps commander's temper,  even should I eventually reach him that night, which seemed a remote  chance, for the best any one could do was give me the rough location on a  map. Still, taking my luminous compass, I set out to steer a cross-country  course. I ran into five or six small groups of ambulances filled with  wounded, trying to find their way to Daur, and completely lost. Most had  given up--some were unknowingly headed back for Tekrit. I could do no more  than give them the"]]]
