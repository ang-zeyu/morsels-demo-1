It was impossible to endure the repeated infliction, and Larry rushed  down the stairs in an agony of fright and amazement. \"May be,\" thought  he, \"it might be my own eyes that wasn't quite steady--or the flame of  the candle. But no--he winked at me as plain as ever I winked at Judy  Donaghue of a May morning. What he manes by it I can't say--but there's  no use of thinking about it--no, nor of talking neither, for who' d  believe me if I tould them of it?\"    The next evening Sir Theodore died, as has been mentioned; and in due  time thereafter was buried according to the custom of the family, by  torch-light, in the churchyard of Inistubber. All was fitly performed;  and although Dickenson had no design upon the jovial knight--and if he  had not, there was nobody within fifteen miles that could be suspected  of such an outrage,--yet Larry Sweeney was determined to make good his  promise of watching his master. \"I'd think little of telling a lie to him,  by the way of no harm when he was alive,\" said he, wiping his eyes, as  soon as the last of the train had departed, leaving him with a single  companion in the lonely cemetery; \"but now that he's dead--God rest his  soul!--I'd scorn it. So Jack Kinaley, as behoves my first cousin's son,  stay you with me here this blessed night, for betune (between) you and I,  it an't lucky to stay by one's self in this ruinated old rookery, where  ghosts, God help us, is as thick as bottles in Sir Theodore's cellar!\"  \"Never you mind that, Larry,\" said Kinaley, a discharged soldier, who had  been through all the campaigns of the Peninsula; \"never mind, I say, such  botherations. Han't I lain in bivouack on the field at Salamanca, and  Tallawara, and the Pyrumnees, and many another place beside, where there  was dead corpses lying about in piles, and there was no more ghosts than  kneebuckles in a ridgemint of Highlanders. Here, let me prime them pieces,  and hand us over the bottle; we'll stay snug under this east window, for  the wind's coming down the hill, and I defy\"--\"None of that bould talk,  Jack,\" said his cousin; \"as for what ye saw in foreign parts, of dead men  killed afighting, sure that's nothing to the dead--God rest 'em!--that's  here. There you see, they had company one with the other, and being  killed fresh-like that morning, had no heart to stir; but here, faith!  'tis a horse of another colour.\" \"May be it is,\" said Jack, \"but the  night's coming on; so I'll turn in. Wake me if you sees any thing; and  after I've got my two hours' rest, I'll relieve you.\"    With these words the soldier turned on his side, under shelter of a grave,  and as his libations had been rather copious during the day, it was not  long before he gave audible testimony that the dread of supernatural  visitants had had no effect in disturbing the even current of his fancy.  Although Larry had not opposed the proposition of his kinsman, yet he  felt by no means at ease. He put in practice all the usually recommended  nostrums for keeping away unpleasant thoughts:--all would not do. \"If it  was a common, dacent, quite (quiet,) well-behaved churchyard a'self,\"  thought Larry, half-aloud--\"but when 'tis a place like this forsaken ould  berrin'-ground, which is noted for villiany\"--\"For what, Larry?\" said a  gentleman, stepping out of a niche which contained the only statue time  had spared. It was the figure of Saint Colman, to whom the church was  dedicated. Larry had been looking at the figure, as it shone forth in  ebon and ivory in the light and shadow of the now high-careering moon,  \"For what, Larry,\" said the gentleman,--\"for what do you say the  churchyard is noted?\" \"For nothing at all, plase your honour,\" replied  Larry, \"except the height of gentility.\" The stranger was about four feet  high, dressed in what might be called flowing garments,--if, in spite of  their form, their rigidity did not deprive them of all claim to such an  appellation. He wore an antique mitre upon his head; his hands were  folded upon his breast; and over his right shoulder rested a pastoral  crook. There was a solemn expression in his countenance, and his eye  might truly be called stony. His beard could not be well said to wave  upon his bosom; but it lay upon it in ample profusion, stiffer than that  of a Jew on a frosty morning after mist. In short, as Larry soon  discovered to his horror, on looking up at the niche, it was no other  than Saint Colman himself, who had stept forth, indignant (in all  probability) at the stigma cast by the watcher of the dead on the  churchyard of which his Saintship was patron. He smiled with a grisly  solemnity--just such a smile as you might imagine would play round the  lips of a milestone (if it had any,) at the recantation so quickly  volunteered by Larry. \"Well,\" said he, \"Lawrence Sweeney\"--\"How well the  old rogue,\" thought Larry, \"knows my name!\" \"Since you profess yourself  such an admirer of the merits of the churchyard of Inistubber, get up and  follow me, till I show you the civilities of the place--for I am master  here, and must do the honours.\" \"Willingly would I go with your worship,\"  replied our friend; \"but you see here I am engaged to Sir Theodore, who,  though a good master, was a mighty passionate man when every thing was  not done as he ordered it; and I am feared to stir.\" \"Sir Theodore,\" said  the Saint, \"will not blame you for following me. I assure you he will  not.\" \"But then,\" said Larry--\"Follow me!\" cried the Saint, in a hollow  voice, and casting upon him his stony eye, drew poor Larry after him, as  the bridal guest was drawn by the lapidary glance of the Ancient Mariner;  or, as Larry himself afterwards expressed it, \"as a jaw tooth is wrinched  out of an ould woman with a pair of pinchers.\" The Saint strode before  him in silence, not in the least incommoded by the stones and rubbish,  which at every step sadly contributed to the discomfiture of Larry's  shins, who followed his marble conductor into a low vault, situated at  the west end of the church. The path lay through coffins piled up on each  side of the way in various degrees of decomposition; and, excepting that  the solid footsteps of the saintly guide, as they smote heavily on the  floor of stone, broke the deadly silence, all was still. Stumbling and  staggering along, directed only by the casual glimpses of light afforded  by the moon, where it broke through the dilapidated roof of the vault,  and served to discover only sights of woe, Larry followed. He soon felt  that he was descending, and could not help wondering at the length of the  journey. He began to entertain the most unpleasant suspicions as to the  character of his conductor;--but what could he do? Flight was out of the  question, and to think of resistance was absurd. \"Needs must, they say,\"  thought he to himself, \"when the devil drives. I see it's much the same  when a saint, leads.\"    At last the dolorous march had an end; and not a little to Larry's  amazement, he found that his guide had brought him to the gate of a lofty  hall, before which a silver lamp, filled with naphtha, \"yielded light as  from a sky.\"--From within loud sounds of merriment were ringing; and it  was evident, from the jocular harmony and the tinkling of glasses, that  some subterraneous catch-club were not idly employed over the bottle.  \"Who's there?\" said a porter, roughly responding to the knock of Saint  Colman. \"Be so good,\" said the Saint, mildly, \"my very good fellow, as to  open the door without further questions, or I'll break your head. I'm  bringing a gentleman here on a visit, whose business is pressing.\" \"May  be so,\" thought Larry, \"but what that business may be, is more than I can  tell.\" The porter sulkily complied with the order, after having  apparently communicated the intelligence that a stranger was at hand; for  a deep silence immediately followed the tipsy clamour; and Larry,  sticking close to his guide, whom he now looked upon almost as a friend,  when compared with these underground revellers to whom he was about to  be introduced, followed him through a spacious vestibule, which gradually  sloped into a low-arched room, where the company was assembled. And a  strange-looking company it was. Seated round a long table were  three-and-twenty grave and venerable personages, bearded, mitred, stoled,  and croziered,--all living statues of stone, like the Saint who had  walked out of his niche. On the drapery before them were figured the  images of the sun, moon, and stars--the inexplicable bear--the mystic  temple, built by the hand of Hiram--and other symbols, of which the  uninitiated knew nothing. The square, the line, the trowel, were not  wanting, and the hammer was lying in front of the chair. Labour, however,  was over, and the time for refreshment having arrived, each of the stony  brotherhood had a flagon before him; and when we mention that the Saints  were Irish, and that St. Patrick in person was in the chair, it is not to  be wondered at that the mitres, in some instances, hung rather loosely on  the side of the heads of some of the canonized compotators. Among the  company were found St. Senanus of Limerick, St. Declan of Ardmore, St.  Canice of Kilkenny, St. Finbar of Cork, St. Michan of Dublin, St. Brandon  of Kerry, St. Fachnan of Ross, and others of that holy brotherhood; a  vacant place, which completed the four-and-twentieth, was left for St.  Colman, who, as every body knows, is of Cloyne; and he, having taken his  seat, addressed the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11406"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 12, No. 340, (#6)"],[1,"me?\" His tears,  and wild agonies, prevented him proceeding; and my eyes could not remain  dry, when seeing such genuine grief, such real suffering.    But the cause of his being separated from his South-Sea home, and his  beloved Berea and her babes, remains to be told. It appears, that about  three years before the period I met him, a Russian ship, sent on a  voyage of discoveries, touched at the island where Laonce had become  naturalized. The captain was received with royal hospitality by the  king; and the _Prince Laonce_ became the glad interpreter between the  Europeans and his august father-in-law--for the captain spoke French.  And, besides procuring the crew all they wanted for common comforts, the  young chief loaded the commander and his officers with useful presents.  One night it blew a violent gale, and the Russian captain, deeming it  impossible to keep his anchorage in a bay so full of unseen dangers,  made signals to the land, in hopes of exciting some native, experienced  in the navigation, to come off, and direct him how to steer. Every  moment increased his jeopardy; the storm augmented; and, at each growing  blast, he expected to be torn from his cables, and dashed to atoms  against the rocks. No one moved from the shore. Again the signals were  repeated: Laonce had risen from his bed on hearing the first. Who was  there amongst all in that island, excepting his British comrade, who  would have known how to move _a ship_ through those boiling waves? The  light canoe, and a vessel of heavy burthen, were different objects! His  comrade was then watching by the side of an almost dying wife, who had  just made him the father of his first-born son. Could Laonce summon him  from that spot of his heart's tenderest duties, to attend to the roaring  guns of distress from a stranger vessel? Impossible! He rose, and looked  out on the night. He listened to the second signal, he wrung his hands,  and, sighing, was returning to his couch again. His wife had then risen  also. She clasped her arms round him, and a big tear stood in both her  eyes, \"You tell me,\" said she, \"that your people do not make those  thunders to heaven, and to earth, till they are drowning. You know you  can save them all. Go, Lao,\"--and she smiled; \"go; and the foreign  chief, after you have saved him, will give you something for me--either  a looking-glass, or a silk handkerchief. Go, Lao.\"    He wound his arms round the gentle pleader; and, almost ashamed that the  father and the husband in his heart, should make him calculate between  his own life and that of the gallant crew, he told her, that the tempest  raged too tremendously for him to dare stemming it. But she laughingly  repulsed his caresses, accusing his fondness for her as the inducement  of his assumed apprehensions; and being too long accustomed to the  rashness of her own people, in braving every weather, to believe any  plea of positive danger, she still persisted; saying she must have a  silk handkerchief that night from yon ship, or she should think he loved  his sound sleep better than he did his fond Berea.    The enthusiastic love which still warmed the faithful husband's breast,  and a third signal of distress from the struggling vessel, mastered his  better judgment, and, seizing his canoe, he dashed into the foaming  waves and boldly stemmed their fury to the object of his mission. The  overjoyed crew, as they heard his voice hailing them through the storm,  cast out a rope, by which they hoisted him into their cracking ship. The  most rapturous acknowledgments from the captain, greeted him as soon as  he jumped on the deck; and the eager seamen called him their deliverer.  He was happy! he said, he was happy in the achievement of what he had  done; he had obeyed the wish of his beloved Berea, and he had survived  the lashing surge. He was happy, in the confidence that he should rescue  the gallant vessel he came to take under his control. But that hour of  happiness was his last. He took the helm in his hands; he gave the  requisite directions to the seamen, for the management of the ship; and  he soon steered her out of the dangers of the bay, till she rode in  safety on the main ocean. He then asked for a boat to carry him on  shore, for his canoe had been crushed by an accident. But the wind still  blowing hurricanes, they would not venture the loss of one of their  boats: and during the hot contentions between him, and the ungrateful  chief of the vessel he had preserved, they were driven out far to sea;  whence his swimming arm, had he plunged into the boisterous deep, could  have been of no use to him. Indignation, despair, overwhelmed him. None  appeared to understand the nature of his feelings; all pretending to  wonder that a European born, should not be grateful to any occasion that  would carry him away from a savage country like that. In vain Laonce  remonstrated; in vain he talked of his wife and children; the captain  and his sailors laughed, promised him better of both sorts among his  kindred whites; and when he cursed their hardened hearts and cruel  treachery, they laughed again, and left him to his misery. At last, when  the protracted hurricane subsided, and the vessel's log-book proved that  she had been driven several degrees leeward of the Society Isles,  abandoned to a sullen despair, he ceased to accuse or to reproach; he  ceased even to speak on any subject, but cast himself into his lonely  berth during the day, that he might not be irritated to continued  unavailing madness, by the sight of the ingrates who had betrayed him.  To his straining eyes, nothing but the silvery line of the starlit sea  was on that distant horizon; but his heart's vision pierced farther,  and he beheld the sleepers in that home;--no, not the sleepers! His  disconsolate, his despairing wife, tearing her bright locks, and beating  the tender bosom he must no longer clasp to his own. His children--\"Oh!  my babes!\" cried he, and the cry of a father's heart for once pierced  the obdurate bosom of the captain, who, in that moment, had happened  to come upon the deck to examine the night. To ease his Otaheitan  benefactor, he declared he had thus carried him off, to share in the  honour of his expected discoveries. The unhappy chief, in then answering  him, begged, that if he had, indeed, any spark of honesty towards him,  he would prove it, by obeying his wish in one thing at least; and that  was, to set him on shore on the first European settlement they should  fall in with. \"Do this,\" said he, \"and I may yet believe you have  honour. For honour is a man's own act; a discovery is fortune's; and for  its advantages, did I stay, I should not have to thank you. But I want  none such. Set me on shore, and there I will follow my own destiny.\"    To this poor request, the iron-souled commander of the vessel, at last  consented; and in the course of some weeks after, Laonce was landed on  the coast of Kamschatka. His secret intent was to lie in wait for the  possibility of some ship touching at the port where he was set ashore,  that might be bound to the track of his beloved islands; but not  uttering a word of this, to the reprobate wretch who had torn him  thence, he simply bade him \"farewell! and to use his next pilot better;\"  so saying, they parted for ever. But weeks and months passed away, and  no vessel bound for the South Seas, showed itself in that distant  latitude; and its gloomy fogs, and chilling atmosphere, its pale sky,  where the sun never shone for more than three or four hours in the day,  seemed to wither up his life with his waning hopes! In no way did it  resemble the land he had left; the warm, and the genial heavens of the  home he was yet bent to find again;--and he left Kamschatka for some  more propitious port; but, like _Sinbad the Sailor_, he wandered in  vain. A cruel spell seemed set on him, or on the spirit of adventure;  for in no place could he hear of a vessel going the way of his prayers.  At last he arrived, by a most tedious and circuitous journey at Moscow,  with a design to lay his case before the young and ardent Alexander, the  then Emperor of Russia; with the hope that his benevolence, and a sense  of what he had done for the vessel which had betrayed him, would incline  his majesty to make some effort to return him to his island, and his  family.    That this hope was not vain, the character of the good Alexander, since  proved by a life of undeviating promptness to all acts of humanity, may  be a sufficient voucher. But whether the homeward-bound chief, found, on  his setting his foot again upon the ground whence he had been so cruelly  rifled; and whence, indeed, the innocent confidence, the playful  bravery of his fond wife, had urged him; whether he found his  cherishly-remembered home, yet standing as he left it; and her, still  the tender and the true to his never-wandered heart; and whether his  children sprang to his knee, to share the parental caress; and the  people around, raised the _haloo_ of joy to the returned _son of their  king!_--whether these fondly-expected greetings hailed his arrival,  cannot be absolutely told; for the vessel that took him out, was to make  the circuit of the globe, ere it returned; hence, from that, and other  circumstances, the facts have never reached the narrator of this little  history, of what was really the meeting between Laonce and his Berea; of  the young chief, and the natives he had devotedly served! But can the  faithful hearts of wedded love, doubt the one; or manly attachment  suspect the other? For the honour of human nature, we will believe that  all was right; and, in the faith of a humble Christian, we will believe,  that \"he who shewed mercy, found mercy!\"; That he is now restored to his  island-home, and to his happy, grateful family!           *       *       *       *       *    Among the _poetical_ contributions are The Angels' Call, and Woman and"]]]
