Beside her sat, or rather lounged, another dame of quality, bearing the  stamp of her class and caste as obviously, yet less deeply marked, than  her companion. More feminine in her air, more foreign in her dress and  entire bearing, her faultless form, and almost faultless face, had all the  advantages of the new democratic toilet of Paris, (adopted by its court,  when more important innovations were still fatally resisted;) and she  appeared in the Phoenix Park, dressed much in the same costume as Marie  Antoinette and her female favourites are described to have worn in the  gardens of Trianon, or in the bowers of St. Cloud,--to the horror of all  old _dames d'atours_, and all the partisans of the ancient regime of  whalebone and buckram! The chemise of transparent muslin, or _robe a la  Poliynae_, _chapeau de paille a la bergere_, tied down with a lilac  ribbon, with        \"Scarf loosely flowing, hair as free,\"      gave an air of sylph-like simplicity to one, whose features, though  beautiful, were marked by an expression foreign to simplicity, evincing  that taste, not sentiment, presided over her toilet, and that, \"_chez  elle, un beau desordre fut l'effet de l'art_.\"    This triumphal car was followed, or surrounded, by a host of beaux; some  in military uniform, and with true English faces and figures; but the  greater number in the civil, though uncivilized, dress of the day, and  with forms and physiognomies as Irish as ever were exhibited in Pale or  Palatine, to the dread of English settlers and Scotch undertakers.  Ponderous powdered clubs, hanging from heads of dishevelled hair--shoulders  raised or stuffed to an Atlas height and breadth--the stoop of paviers,  and the lounge of chairmen--broad beavers, tight buckskins, the striped  vest of a groom, and the loose coat of a coachman, gave something ruffianly  to the air of even the finest figures, which assorted but too well with the  daring, dashing manner, that just then had succeeded, among a _particular  set_, to the courtly polish for which the travelled nobility of Ireland  were once so distinguished. Such, in exterior, were many of the members of  the famous _Cherokee Club_, and such the future legislators of that great  national indignity, which had procured them a contemptible pre-eminence in  the black book of public opinion, by the style and title of the \"_Union  Lords_.\" As they now crowded round the cynosures of the day, there was  something too ardent and unrestrained in their homage, something too  emphatic in their expressions and gestures, for true breeding; while in  their handsome, but \"light, revelling, and protesting faces,\" traces of  the night's orgies were still visible, which gave their fine features a  licentious cast, and deprived their open and very manly countenances of  every mark of intellectual expression.--_Lady Morgan's \"O'Briens and  O'Flahertys.\"_           *       *       *       *       *      THE WEE MAN.        It was a merry company.      And they were just afloat,    When lo! a man of dwarfish span      Came up and hail'd the boat.      \"Good morrow to ye, gentle folks,      And will you let me in?    A slender space will serve my case,      For I am small and thin.\"      They saw he was a dwarfish man,      And very small and thin;    Not seven such would matter much,      And so they took him in.      They laugh'd to see his little hat,      With such a narrow brim;    They laugh'd to note his dapper coat,      With skirts so scant and trim.      But barely had they gone a mile,      When, gravely, one and all,    At once began to think the man      Was not so very small.      His coat had got a broader skirt,      His hat a broader brim,    His leg grew stout, and soon plump'd out      A very proper limb.      Still on they went, and as they went      More rough the billows grew,--    And rose and fell, a greater swell,      And he was swelling too!      And lo! where room had been for seven,      For six there scarce was space!    For five!--for four!--for three!--not more      Than two could find a place!      There was not even room for one!      They crowded by degrees--    Ay, closer yet, till elbows met,      And knees were jogging knees.      \"Good sir, you must not sit a-stern.      The wave will else come in!\"    Without a word he gravely stirr'd,      Another seat to win.      \"Good sir, the boat has lost her trim,      You must not sit a-lee!\"    With smiling face and courteous grace      The middle seat took he.      But still by constant quiet growth,      His back became so wide.    Each neighbour wight, to left and right,      Was thrust against the side.      Lord! how they chided with themselves,      That they had let him in;    To see him grow so monstrous now,      That came so small and thin.      On every brow a dew-drop stood,      They grew so scared and hot,--    \"I' the name of all that's great and tall,      Who are ye, sir, and what?\"      Loud laugh'd the Gogmagog, a laugh      As loud as giant's roar--    \"When first I came, my proper name      Was _Little_--now I'm _Moore_!\"    _Hood's Whims and Oddities Second series._           *       *       *       *       *          Manners & Customs of all Nations.           *       *       *       *       *    No. XV.      LIVING AT CALAIS.      Calais may, for various reasons, be looked upon as one of the dearest towns  in France. An excellent suite of furnished apartments may be had in one of  the most respectable _private_ houses in Calais, consisting of a  sitting-room, three bedrooms, and a kitchen, for twenty shillings a week,  and smaller ones in proportion, down to five shillings a week for a  bachelor's apartment. This, however, does not include _attendance_ of any  kind; and, with few exceptions, the apartments can only be taken by the  month. The price of meat is fixed by a _tarif_, at a maximum of sixpence  per pound for the very best. It varies, therefore, between that price and  fourpence; and this pound contains something more than ours. Poultry is  still cheaper, in proportion, or rather in fact. My dinner to-day consists,  in part, of an excellent fowl, which cost _8d._ and a pair of delicate  ducks, which cost _1s. 6d._ The price of bread is also fixed by law, and  amounts to about two-thirds of the _present_ price of ours in London.  Butter and eggs are excellent, and always fresh: the first costs from _9d._  to _10d._ the pound of 18 ounces; and the latter _10d._ the quarter of a  hundred. Vegetables and fruit, which are all of the finest quality, and  fresh from the gardens of the adjacent villages, are as follow:--asparagus,  at the rate of _8d._ or _9d._ the hundred, peas (the picked young ones,)  _3d._ per quart; new potatoes (better than any we can get in England,  except what they call the _framed_ ones,) three pounds far a penny;  cherries and currants (picked for the table,) _2d._ per pound; strawberries  (the high flavoured wood-strawberry, which is so fine with sugar and  cream,) _4d._ for a full quart, the stocks being picked off. (This latter  is a delicacy that can scarcely be procured in England for any price.) The  above may serve as an indication of all the rest, as all are in proportion.  The finest pure milk is _2d._ per quart; good black or green teas, _4s.  6d._ per pound; and the finest green gunpowder tea, _7s._; coffee, from  _1s. 3d._ to _2s._; good brandy, _1s. 3d._ per quart, and the very best,  _2s._ (I do not mean the very finest old Cogniac, which costs _3s. 6d._)  Wine is dearer in Calais than, perhaps, in any other town in France, that  could be named; but still you may have an excellent table wine for _1s._  per quart bottle; and they make a very palatable and wholesome beer, for  _1-1/2d._ and _2-1/2d._ per bottle--the latter of which has all the good  qualities of our porter, and none of its bad. Fish is not plentiful at  Calais, except the skate, which you may have for almost nothing, as indeed  you may at many of our own sea-port towns. But you may always have good  sized turbot (enough for six persons for _3s._ and a cod weighing from  twelve to fifteen pounds,) for half that sum. As to the wages of female  servants, they can scarcely be considered as much cheaper, nominally, than  they are with us. But then the habits of the servants, and the cost of what  they eat, make their _keep_ and wages together amount to not more than half  what they do with us.    It only remains to tell you of what is _dearer_ here than it is in England,  I have tried all I can to find out items belonging to this latter head, and  have succeeded in _two_ alone--namely, sugar and fuel. You cannot have  brown sugar under _8d._ and indifferent loaf sugar costs _1s. 3d._ And as  to firing, it is dearer, _nominally_ alone, and in point of fact, does not  cost, to a well regulated family, near so much, in the course of the year,  as coals do in our houses.--_Monthly Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *      ROMAN FUNERALS.      The ceremonial of the funeral of a cardinal is considered as one of the  most imposing at Rome, which is a city of ceremonies, and yielding only  in magnificence to the obsequies of royal personages. The burial of the  Mezzo-ceto classes is conducted rather differently. The body is exposed  much in the same manner, at home; but the convoi, or passage from the  habitation to the sepulchre, is generally considered as an occasion which  calls for the utmost display. Torches, priests, psalmody, are sought for  with a spirit of rivalry which easily explains the sumptuary laws of the  Florentine and Roman statute-books, and which, unnoticed but not  extinguished in the present age, in a poorer must have been highly  offensive to the frugality and jealousies of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11408"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Each work is beautifully and classically  bound; and to each Mr. Roscoe has prefixed, in his own fair hand  writing, a short account of the particular manuscript, with the  bibliographical learning appertaining to it.--_Library of Useful  Knowledge_.           *       *       *       *       *      PHRENOLOGY.      Mr. Crook, of the Phrenological Society, has just published a  \"Compendium of Phrenology,\" which cannot fail to be acceptable to the  ingenious inquirers after that very ingenious science. It is a lucid  little arrangement of principles, and will materially assist them; but,  for our part, we confess we would sooner take the public opinion of the  contents of our cranium than that of a whole society of phrenologists;  and if our head be as full as our sheet, we shall be content. But,  joking apart, the little synopsis before us cannot be too highly  recommended; and by way of hint to some friends who send us witty  articles for \"the Gatherer,\" we take the following:--    \"Wit. _Primitive Power._ Perception of the disjunction or incongruity of  ideas; the analytical faculty. _Uses_: Separation of compound or general  ideas into those that are elementary or more simple; knowledge of  characteristic differences and discrepance. _Abuses_: A disposition to  jest or ridicule; irony, sarcasm, and satire, without respect to truth,  or the circumstances of person, place, or time. _Organ_, on the other  side of Causality.    \"It is not the definition of Wit, but the function of a particular  portion of the brain at which I aim. Dr. Spurzheim, in some of his  works, calls the faculty connected with this organ, 'the feeling of the  ludicrous;' in his later ones, 'Gayness,' and 'Mirthfulness.' But each  of these is properly an effect, not a primitive power. The ludicrous  owes its origin to the contrariety between the parts or means, as  perceived by this faculty, and the general whole, or purpose, perceived  by Comparison, or the necessary connexion perceived by Causality; and  Gaiety, Mirth, and Laughter, arise from the mutual influence and  reaction of the feelings. Some kinds of contrariety or incongruity  excite one class of feelings, other kinds altogether different feelings;  and consequently, according to the faculty or combination of faculties  affected, the kinds of mirth and laughter are varied from the Sardonic  grin of Destructiveness to the lover's smile. This view of the origin of  laughter enables us to give a satisfactory answer to the hitherto  perplexing question, 'Why is man the only laughing animal?'\"           *       *       *       *       *      EPIGRAM    _From the Greek Anthology, (Author unknown.)_    BY THE REV. W. SHEPHERD.        If at the bottom of the cask,    Be left of wine a little flask,    It soon grows acid:--so when man,    Living through Life's most lengthened span.    His joys all drain'd or turn'd to tears,    Sinks to the lees of fourscore years,    And sees approach Death's darksome hour--    No wonder if he's somewhat sour!                    _The Winter's Wreath_.           *       *       *       *       *      PORTRAIT PAINTING.      The good portrait painter always flatters; for it is his business, not,  indeed, to alter and amend features, complexion, or mien, but to select  and fix (which it demands genius and sense to do) the best appearance  which these ever do wear. Happy the creature of sense and passion who  has always with him that self which he could take pleasure in  contemplating! Happy--to pass graver considerations--the fair one whose  countenance continues as youthful as her attire! When Queen Elizabeth's  wrinkles waxed deep and many, it is reported that an unfortunate master  of the mint incurred disgrace by a too faithful shilling; the die was  broken, and only one mutilated impression is now in existence. Her maids  of honour took the hint, and were thenceforth careful that no fragment  of looking-glass should remain in any room of the palace. In fact, the  lion-hearted lady had not heart to look herself in the face for the last  twenty years of her life; but we nowhere learn that she quarrelled with  Holbein's portraitures of her youth, or those of her stately prime of  viraginity by De Heere and Zucchero.    He who has \"neither done things worthy to be written, nor written things  worthy to be read,\" takes the trouble of transmitting his portrait to  posterity to very little purpose. If the picture be a bad one, it will  soon find its way to the garret; if good, as a work of art, it will  perpetuate the fame, probably the name, indeed, of the artist alone.  These are the _obscurorum virorum imagines_ which, as Walpole said, \"are  christened commonly in galleries, like children at the Foundling  Hospital, _by chance_\"--Q. Rev.           *       *       *       *       *      LOSING A SHOE AND A DINNER.      As Ozias Linley, Sheridan's brother-in-law, was one morning setting out  on horseback for his curacy, a few miles from Norwich, his horse threw  off one of his shoes. A lady, who observed the accident, thought it  might impede Mr. Linley's journey, and seeing that he himself was  unconscious of it, politely reminded him that one of his horse's shoes  had just come off. \"Thank you, madam,\" replied Linley; \"will you then  have the goodness to put it on for me?\"    Linley one day received a card to dine with the late archbishop of  Canterbury, who was then bishop of Norwich. Careless into what hole or  corner he threw his invitations, he soon lost sight of the card, and  forgot it altogether. A year revolved, when, on wiping the dust from  some papers he had stuck on the glass over the chimney, the bishop's  invitation for a certain day in the month (he did not think of the year  one instant,) stared him full in the face, and taking it for granted  that it was a recent one, he dressed himself on the appointed day, and  proceeded to the palace. But his diocesan was not in London, a  circumstance of which, though a matter of some notoriety to the clergy  of the diocese, he was quite unconscious; and he returned dinnerless  home.           *       *       *       *       *      SENTIMENT AND APPETITE.      We remember an amiable enthusiast, a worshiper of nature after the  manner of Rousseau, who, being melted into feelings of universal  philanthropy by the softness and serenity of a spring morning, resolved,  that for that day, at least, no injured animal should pollute his board;  and having recorded his vow, walked six miles to gain a hamlet, famous  for fish dinners, where, without an idea of breaking his sentimental  engagement, he regaled himself on a small matter of crimped cod and  oyster sauce--Q.

BY W. ROSCOE, ESQ.        Say, what impels me, pure and spotless flower,      To view thee with a secret sympathy?      --Is there some living spirit shrined in thee?    That, as thou bloom'st within my humble bower,    Endows thee with some strange, mysterious      power,      Waking high thoughts?--As there perchance        might be      Some angel-form of truth and purity,    Whose hallowed presence shared my lonely hour?      --Yes, lovely flower, 'tis not thy virgin glow,      Thy petals whiter than descending snow,    Nor all the charms thy velvet folds display;      'Tis the soft image of some beaming mind,      By grace adorn'd, by elegance refin'd,    That o'er my heart thus holds its silent sway.                             _The Winter's Wreath._           *       *       *       *       *      PIGS.      One day when Giotto, the painter, was taking his Sunday walk, in his  best attire, with a party of friends, at Florence, and was in the midst  of a long story, some pigs passed suddenly by, and one of them, running  between the painter's legs, threw him down. When he got on his legs  again, instead of swearing a terrible oath at the pig on the Lord's day,  as a graver man might have done, he observed, laughing, \"People say  these beasts are stupid, but they seem to me to have some sense of  justice, for I have earned several thousands of crowns with their  bristles, but I never gave one of them even a ladleful of soup in my  life.\"--_Lanzi._           *       *       *       *       *      TURKISH FIREMEN.

Cruelty to animals is a subject which has deservedly attracted  parliamentary investigation.

Who that has witnessed the  barbarous and unmanly sports of the cock-pit and the stake--the  fiendlike ingenuity displayed by the lord of the creation in teaching  his dependents to torture, mangle, and destroy each other for his own  amusement--the cruelties of the greedy and savage task-master towards  the dumb labourer whose strength has decayed in his service--or the  sufferings of the helpless brute that drags with pain and difficulty its  maimed carcass to Smithfield--what reasonable being that has witnessed  all or any of this, will venture to affirm that interference is  officious and uncalled for?
