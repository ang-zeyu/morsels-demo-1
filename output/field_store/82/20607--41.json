[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12422"],[0,"Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation: 1838-1839 (#6)"],[1,"with babies in their arms, the care of the  infants being taken from the mothers (who are driven a-field as soon as  they recover from child labour), and devolved upon these poor little  nurses, as they are called, whose business it is to watch the infant, and  carry it to its mother whenever it may require nourishment. To these  hardly human little beings, I addressed my remonstrances about the filth,  cold, and unnecessary wretchedness of their room, bidding the elder boys  and girls kindle up the fire, sweep the floor, and expel the poultry. For  a long time my very words seemed unintelligible to them, till when I began  to sweep and make up the fire, &c., they first fell to laughing, and then  imitating me. The encrustations of dirt on their hands, feet, and faces,  were my next object of attack, and the stupid negro practice (by the bye,  but a short time since nearly universal in enlightened Europe), of keeping  the babies with their feet bare, and their heads, already well capped by  nature with their woolly hair, wrapped in half-a-dozen hot filthy  coverings. Thus I travelled down the 'street,' in every dwelling  endeavouring to awaken a new perception, that of cleanliness, sighing, as  I went, over the futility of my own exertions, for how can slaves be  improved? Nathless, thought I, let what can be done; for it may be, that,  the two being incompatible, improvement may yet expel slavery--and so it  might, and surely would, if, instead of beginning at the end, I could but  begin at the beginning of my task. If the mind and soul were awakened,  instead of mere physical good attempted, the physical good would result,  and the great curse vanish away; but my hands are tied fast, and this  corner of the work is all that I may do. Yet it cannot be but, from my  words and actions, some revelations should reach these poor people; and  going in and out amongst them perpetually, I shall teach, and they learn  involuntarily a thousand things of deepest import. They must learn, and  who can tell the fruit of that knowledge alone, that there are beings in  the world, even with skins of a different colour from their own, who have  sympathy for their misfortunes, love for their virtues, and respect for  their common nature--but oh! my heart is full almost to bursting, as I  walk among these most poor creatures.    The infirmary is a large two-story building, terminating the broad  orange-planted space between the two rows of houses which form the first  settlement; it is built of white washed wood, and contains four  large-sized rooms. But how shall I describe to you the spectacle which was  presented to me, on my entering the first of these? But half the  casements, of which there were six, were glazed, and these were obscured  with dirt, almost as much as the other windowless ones were darkened by  the dingy shutters, which the shivering inmates had fastened to, in order  to protect themselves from the cold. In the enormous chimney glimmered the  powerless embers of a few sticks of wood, round which, however, as many of  the sick women as could approach, were cowering; some on wooden settles,  most of them on the ground, excluding those who were too ill to rise; and  these last poor wretches lay prostrate on the floor, without bed,  mattress, or pillow, buried in tattered and filthy blankets, which,  huddled round them as they lay strewed about, left hardly space to move  upon the floor. And here, in their hour of sickness and suffering, lay  those whose health and strength are spent in unrequited labour for  us--those who, perhaps even yesterday, were being urged onto their unpaid  task--those whose husbands, fathers, brothers and sons, were even at that  hour sweating over the earth, whose produce was to buy for us all the  luxuries which health can revel in, all the comforts which can alleviate  sickness. I stood in the midst of them, perfectly unable to speak, the  tears pouring from my eyes at this sad spectacle of their misery, myself  and my emotion alike strange and incomprehensible to them. Here lay women  expecting every hour the terrors and agonies of child-birth, others who  had just brought their doomed offspring into the world, others who were  groaning over the anguish and bitter disappointment of miscarriages--here  lay some burning with fever, others chilled with cold and aching with  rheumatism, upon the hard cold ground, the draughts and dampness of the  atmosphere increasing their sufferings, and dirt, noise, and stench, and  every aggravation of which sickness is capable, combined in their  condition--here they lay like brute beasts, absorbed in physical  suffering; unvisited by any of those Divine influences which may ennoble  the dispensations of pain and illness, forsaken, as it seemed to me, of  all good; and yet, O God, Thou surely hadst not forsaken them! Now, pray  take notice, that this is the hospital of an estate, where the owners are  supposed to be humane, the overseer efficient and kind, and the negroes,  remarkably well cared for and comfortable. As soon as I recovered from my  dismay, I addressed old Rose, the midwife, who had charge of this room,  bidding her open the shutters of such windows as were glazed, and let in  the light. I next proceeded to make up the fire, but upon my lifting a log  for that purpose, there was one universal outcry of horror, and old Rose,  attempting to snatch it from me, exclaimed, 'Let alone, missis--let  be--what for you lift wood--you have nigger enough, missis, to do it!' I  hereupon had to explain to them my view of the purposes for which hands  and arms were appended to our bodies, and forthwith began making Rose tidy  up the miserable apartment, removing all the filth and rubbish from the  floor that could be removed, folding up in piles the blankets of the  patients who were not using them, and placing, in rather more sheltered  and comfortable positions, those who were unable to rise. It was all that  I could do, and having enforced upon them all my earnest desire that they  should keep their room swept, and as tidy as possible, I passed on to the  other room on the ground floor, and to the two above, one of which is  appropriated to the use of the men who are ill. They were all in the same  deplorable condition, the upper rooms being rather the more miserable,  inasmuch as none of the windows were glazed at all, and they had,  therefore, only the alternative of utter darkness, or killing draughts of  air, from the unsheltered casements. In all, filth, disorder and misery  abounded; the floor was the only bed, and scanty begrimed rags of blankets  the only covering. I left this refuge for Mr. ----'s sick dependants, with  my clothes covered with dust, and full of vermin, and with a heart heavy  enough, as you will well believe. My morning's work had fatigued me not a  little, and I was glad to return to the house, where I gave vent to my  indignation and regret at the scene I had just witnessed, to Mr. ---- and  his overseer, who, here, is a member of our family. The latter told me  that the condition of the hospital had appeared to him, from his first  entering upon his situation (only within the last year), to require a  reform, and that he had proposed it to the former manager, Mr. K----, and  Mr. ----'s brother, who is part proprietor of the estate, but receiving no  encouragement from them, had supposed that it was a matter of indifference  to the owners, and had left it in the condition in which he had found it,  in which condition it has been for the last nineteen years and upwards.    This new overseer of ours has lived fourteen years with an old Scotch  gentleman, who owns an estate adjoining Mr. ----'s, on the island of St.  Simons, upon which estate, from everything I can gather, and from what I  know of the proprietor's character, the slaves are probably treated with  as much humanity as is consistent with slavery at all, and where the  management and comfort of the hospital, in particular, had been most  carefully and judiciously attended to. With regard to the indifference of  our former manager upon the subject of the accommodation for the sick, he  was an excellent overseer, _videlicet_, the estate returned a full income  under his management, and such men have nothing to do with sick  slaves--they are tools, to be mended only if they can be made available  again,--if not, to be flung by as useless, without further expense of  money, time, or trouble.    I am learning to row here, for, circumscribed as my walks necessarily are,  impossible as it is to resort to my favourite exercise on horseback upon  these narrow dykes, I must do something to prevent my blood from  stagnating; and this broad brimming river, and the beautiful light canoes  which lie moored, at the steps, are very inviting persuaders to this  species of exercise. My first attempt was confined to pulling an oar  across the stream, for which I rejoiced in sundry aches and pains  altogether novel, letting alone a delightful row of blisters on each of my  hands.    I forgot to tell you that in the hospital were several sick babies, whose  mothers were permitted to suspend their field labour, in order to nurse  them. Upon addressing some remonstrances to one of these, who, besides  having a sick child, was ill herself, about the horribly dirty condition  of her baby, she assured me that it was impossible for them to keep their  children clean, that they went out to work at daybreak, and did not get  their tasks done till evening, and that then they were too tired and worn  out to do anything but throw themselves down and sleep. This statement of  hers I mentioned on my return from the hospital, and the overseer  appeared extremely annoyed by it, and assured me repeatedly that it was  not true.    In the evening Mr. ----, who had been over to Darien, mentioned that one  of the storekeepers there had told him that, in the course of a few years,  he had paid"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12423"],[0,"A Short History of the United States for School Use (#6)"],[1,"none became so famous as those who met at Elder Brewster's house  at Scrooby. King James decided to make all Puritans conform to the State  Church or to hunt them out of the land. The Scrooby people soon felt the  weight of persecution. After suffering great hardships and cruel  treatment they fled away to Holland. But there they found it very  difficult to make a living. They suffered so terribly that many of their  English friends preferred to go to prison in England rather than lead  such a life of slavery in Holland. So the Pilgrims determined to found a  colony in America. They reasoned that they could not be worse off in  America, because that would be impossible. At all events, their children  would not grow up as Dutchmen, but would still be Englishmen. They had  entire religious freedom in Holland; but they thought they would have  the same in America.

The Pilgrims held their  services in the building on the left, now used as a cow-house.]    [Sidenote: The voyage of the _Mayflower_, 1620.]    [Sidenote: The _Mayflower_ at Cape Cod.]    44. The Voyage across the Atlantic.--Brewster's old friend, Sir  Edwin Sandys, was now at the head of the Virginia Company. He easily  procured land for the Pilgrims in northern Virginia, near the Dutch  settlements (p. 41). Some London merchants lent them money. But they  lent it on such harsh conditions that the Pilgrims' early life in  America was nearly as hard as their life had been in Holland. They had a  dreadful voyage across the Atlantic in the _Mayflower_. At one time it  seemed as if the ship would surely go down. But the Pilgrims helped the  sailors to place a heavy piece of wood under one of the deck beams and  saved the vessel from going to pieces. On November 19, 1620, they  sighted land off the coast of Cape Cod. They tried to sail around the  cape to the southward, but storms drove them back, and they anchored in  Provincetown harbor.    [Sidenote: The Pilgrims Compact, 1620.]    45. The Mayflower Compact, 1620.--All the passengers on the  _Mayflower_ were not Pilgrims. Some of them were servants sent out by  the London merchants to work for them. These men said that as they were  outside of Virginia, the leaders of the expedition would have no power  over them as soon as they got on land. This was true enough, so the  Pilgrims drew up and signed a compact which obliged the signers to obey  whatever was decided to be for the public good. It gave the chosen  leaders power to make the unruly obey their commands.

The First Winter at Plymouth.--For nearly a month the Pilgrims  explored the shores of Cape Cod Bay. Finally, on December 21, 1620, a  boat party landed on the mainland inside of Plymouth harbor. They  decided to found their colony on the shore at that place. About a week  later the _Mayflower_ anchored in Plymouth harbor. For months the  Pilgrims lived on the ship while working parties built the necessary  huts on shore. It was in the midst of a cold New England winter. The  work was hard and food and clothing were not well suited to the worker's  needs. Before the _Mayflower_ sailed away in the spring one-half of the  little band was dead.    [Sidenote: The Pilgrims and the Indians. _Explorers_, 333-337.]    [Sidenote: Success of the colony.]    [Sidenote: New Plymouth colony.]    47. New Plymouth Colony.--Of all the Indians who once had lived  near Plymouth only one remained. His name was Squanto. He came to the  Pilgrims in the spring. He taught them to grow corn and to dig clams,  and thus saved them from starvation. The Pilgrims cared for him most  kindly as long as he lived. Another and more important Indian also came  to Plymouth. He was Massasoit, chief of the strongest Indian tribe near  Plymouth. With him the Pilgrims made a treaty which both parties obeyed  for more than fifty years. Before long the Pilgrims' life became  somewhat easier. They worked hard to raise food for themselves, they  fished off the coasts, and bought furs from the Indians. In these ways  they got together enough money to pay back the London merchants. Many of  their friends joined them. Other towns were settled near by, and  Plymouth became the capital of the colony of New Plymouth. But the  colony was never very prosperous, and in the end was added to  Massachusetts.

The Founding of Massachusetts, 1629-30.--Unlike the poor and  humble Pilgrims were the founders of Massachusetts. They were men of  wealth and social position, as for instance, John Winthrop and Sir  Richard Saltonstall. They left comfortable homes in England to found a  Puritan state in America. They got a great tract of land extending from  the Merrimac to the Charles, and westward across the continent. Hundreds  of colonists came over in the years 1629-30. They settled Boston, Salem,  and neighboring towns. In the next ten years thousands more joined them.  From the beginning Massachusetts was strong and prosperous. Among so  many people there were some who did not get on happily with the rulers  of the colony.    [Sidenote: Roger Williams expelled from Massachusetts. _Higginson_,  68-70.]    [Sidenote: He founds Providence, 1636. _Source-book_, 52-54.]    49. Roger Williams and Religious Liberty.--Among the newcomers was  Roger Williams, a Puritan minister. He disagreed with the Massachusetts  leaders on several points. For instance, he thought that the  Massachusetts people had no right to their lands, and he insisted that  the rulers had no power in religious matters--as enforcing the laws as  to Sunday. He insisted on these points so strongly that the  Massachusetts government expelled him from the colony. In the spring of  1636; with four companions he founded the town of Providence. There he  decided that every one should be free to worship God as he or she  saw fit.    [Sidenote: Mrs. Hutchinson and her friends.]    [Sidenote: They settle Rhode Island, 1637.]    50. The Rhode Island Towns.--Soon another band of exiles came from  Massachusetts. These were Mrs. Hutchinson and her followers. Mrs.  Hutchinson was a brilliant Puritan woman who had come to Boston from  England to enjoy the ministry of John Cotton, one of the Boston  ministers. She soon began to find fault with the other ministers of the  colony. Naturally, they did not like this. Their friends were more  numerous than were Mrs. Hutchinson's friends, and the latter had to  leave Massachusetts. They settled on the island of Rhode Island (1637).    [Sidenote: The Connecticut colonists.]    [Sidenote: Founding of Connecticut, 1635-36. _Higginson_, 71-72.]    51. The Connecticut Colony.--Besides those Puritans whom the  Massachusetts people drove from their colony there were other settlers  who left Massachusetts of their own free will. Among these were the  founders of Connecticut. The Massachusetts people would gladly have had  them remain, but they were discontented and insisted on going away. They  settled the towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Weathersfield, on the  Connecticut River. At about the same time John Winthrop, Jr., led a  colony to Saybrook, at the mouth of the Connecticut. Up to this time  the Dutch had seemed to have the best chance to settle the Connecticut  Valley. But the control of that region was now definitely in the hands  of the English.    [Sidenote: Destruction of the Pequods, 1637.]    52. The Pequod War, 1637.--The Pequod Indians were not so ready as  the Dutch to admit that resistance was hopeless. They attacked  Wethersfield. They killed several colonists, and carried others away  into captivity. Captain John Mason of Connecticut and Captain John  Underhill of Massachusetts went against them with about one hundred men.  They surprised the Indians in their fort. They set fire to the fort, and  shot down the Indians as they strove to escape from their burning  wigwams. In a short time the Pequod tribe was destroyed.    [Illustration: JOHN WINTHROP, JR.]    [Sidenote: The Connecticut Orders of 1638-39.]    53. The First American Constitution, 1638-39.--The Connecticut  colonists had leisure now to settle the form of their government.  Massachusetts had such a liberal charter that nothing more seemed to be  necessary in that colony. The Mayflower Compact did well enough for the  Pilgrims. The Connecticut people had no charter, and they wanted  something more definite than a vague compact. So in the winter of  1638-39 they met at Hartford and set down on paper a complete set of  rules for their guidance. This was the first time in the history of the  English race that any people had tried to do this. The Connecticut  constitution of 1638-39 is therefore looked upon as \"the first truly  political written constitution in history.\" The government thus  established was very much the same as that of Massachusetts with the  exception that in Connecticut there was no religious condition for the  right to vote as there was in Massachusetts.    [Sidenote: The New Haven settlers.]    [Sidenote: New Haven founded, 1638. _Higginson_, 72-73.]    54. New Haven, 1638.--The settlers of New Haven went even farther  than the Massachusetts rulers and held that the State should really be a  part of the Church. Massachusetts was not entirely to their tastes.  They passed only one winter there and then moved away and settled New  Haven. But this colony was not well situated for commerce, and was too  near the Dutch settlements (p. 41). It was never as prosperous as  Connecticut and was finally joined to that colony.
