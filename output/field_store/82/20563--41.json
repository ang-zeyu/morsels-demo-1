In 1884 a Chicago belt company obtained a patent on another style of  link belt. In this belt all the little holes in the links were lined  with metal, similar to the holes in laced shoes. This produced an effect  similar to that produced by Hall's patent. The metal lining of the holes  cut the bolts into pieces by friction and thus ruined the belt.  Therefore this patent proved a failure also.    After all these failures it fell to our lot to improve these belts so  that they may now be worked successfully on our American fast running  machinery. During the past two years we have made and sold over five  hundred leather link belts, which are all in actual use and doing  excellent service, as is proved by many testimonials which we have  received.    Our success with these belts has been so surprising that we think we  have found, at last, the long looked for \"missing link,\" not in  \"Darwinism,\" however, but in the belting line. We prophesy a great  future for these belts in this country.    How have we attained such success? First: We found that Roullier made a  mistake in using leather offal, as, in the links of an _iron chain_, if  one link is weak or defective, the whole chain is worthless, so in link  belts, if one or two links are weak or made of poor material, the whole  belt is affected by them. It is therefore of vital importance that only  the best and most solid leather be used in making the links; second, the  leather must be made very pliable, but at the same time its toughness  and tenacity must not be injured, or it will stretch and break.    [Illustration: FIG 1.]    These things are of great importance, and are the principal reasons for  the failures of all former efforts. The leather which Roullier used was  stiff, hard, and husky. He believed that the harder the link the greater  its tensile strength, but upon actual test this was found to be a fatal  error.    Our leather links are saturated with a mixture of tallow, neatsfoot oil,  etc. This makes them very pliable and increases their toughness, so that  they will stand a strain three times as great as a piece of hard rolled  sole leather.    In manufacturing this belt, the joining together is important. The links  must be accurately assorted as to thickness, and the outer links  countersunk, to admit the bolt. Then the most valuable improvement of  all is our \"American joint\" (see Fig. 1).    By close inspection you will observe that it is absolutely necessary to  use half length bolts for the width of wide leather link belts.    Examine Figs. 2 and 3. In the latter you will notice one length of bolt  placed on a round faced pulley. That belt must either bend or break, and  in any case it will not give satisfaction; but, on the other hand,  examine Fig. 2; here two half length bolts are used, and ingeniously  joined in the center. It gives just pliability enough to lay the belt  flat upon the pulley. We experimented for some time before perfecting  this important improvement.    We also took out four patents for different methods of joining, but  abandoned them all and adopted the \"American joint\" system (Fig. 1) as  the most efficient, simple, and reliable. It gives the belt an unbroken  flat surface and is far superior to anything so far introduced for that  purpose.    We have not stopped at _flat_ link belting, but have turned our  attention to manufacturing round solid leather link belting, and believe  that we have almost attained perfection in that line. As the  illustrations clearly show, there is quite a demand for inch and upward  solid round belting, and the difficulty always has been to join such a  belt together. All steel hooks, etc., do not seem to satisfy. This, our  new invention, is so simple that it hardly needs explanation. A belt of  this kind can be taken apart in a short time, and shortened or  lengthened at pleasure.    Now, Mr. President and gentlemen, I shall be glad to answer any  questions in reference to these link belts, or give any further  explanation you may desire.    Question.--Can these link belts be used on dynamos for electric lights?    Answer.--Yes. In England they are used almost exclusively on dynamos.  However, they run only 700 revolutions per minute there, whereas our  slowest dynamo runs 1,100.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    Quest.--Would you advise link belts for high rate of speed?    Ans.--No; they give better results on slow running machinery.    Quest.--Have these belts any special advantage over flat leather  belting?    Ans.--Yes, decidedly. When belts are run half crossed, or what is termed  quarter turn, it is very hard to make flat belts lie perfectly even on  the pulleys. These link belts, however, cover the entire face of the  pulley (see illustration), and therefore are superior for that purpose.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]    Quest.--Why do they give better results when run slow?    Ans.--Partly because of their great weight over ordinary belting, also  their grip power is stronger when run slow. No belt is superior to them  for slow, hard working machinery.    Quest.--Are they more expensive than ordinary flat belting?    Ans.--Not when compared to the work they can accomplish.    [Illustration]    Quest.--Can they be run in wet places, such as mines, etc.?    Ans.--Yes; by waterproofing the leather, no cement being used as in flat  belts. The links can be made positively waterproof. We have furnished  paper mills, tanneries and bleacheries, and other exposed places with  waterproof link belts, and all have been entirely satisfactory so far.    Quest.--Can they be run on ordinary flat pulleys?    Ans.--Yes; our \"American joint\" link belt can be run on any straight or  rounded pulley, whether made of iron, paper, or wood, and being all  endless they run much smoother than other belting.    [Illustration: ENGLISH HINGE JOINT:]    Quest.--How are they made endless?    Ans.--By a very simple process (see illustration), and takes almost less  time than lacing a flat belt. All that is necessary is to take both ends  and interlock the links, then pass the bolt through and rivet it, and  when you wish to shorten the belt proceed likewise: File off the end of  the bolt and take out, or add rows of links at pleasure and rejoin it  again.    [Illustration: Fig. 4 is a complete round link belt.]    Quest.--What is the relative strength of a link belt compared to flat  belting?    Ans.--Nothing definite has yet been ascertained. We are preparing a  table showing results, and so far we can report that they can stand  about twice the strain of double flat belts. A four inch link belt one  inch thick is able to do the work of an eight inch flat double belt.    [Illustration: Fig. 5 is a side view.]    Quest.--Explain the advantage of your American joint over the English  hinge.    Ans.--The American joint gives a perfect unbroken surface of entire  width of belt, whereas the English hinge joint makes two half widths,  and whenever a sudden change of power occurs and the belt runs half way  off the pulley, it will catch at the edge and tear everything to pieces.    [Illustration: Fig. 6 is an end view.]    Quest.--Have you a table or schedule of their weight per square foot?    Ans.--Yes. The following is as near as we can estimate the weight of  leather link belting per square foot:       1  inch thick, about 5  lb. per sq. ft.    7/8   \"    \"      \"   41/2  \"   \"  \"    3/4   \"    \"      \"   4   \"   \"  \"    5/8   \"    \"      \"   31/2  \"   \"  \"    Upon motion a vote of thanks was passed, and the paper read ordered to  be printed.

[Footnote: Abstract of a paper read before the Franklin Institute,  April, 1887.--_J.F.I._]    By A.E. OUTERBRIDGE, JR.      The art of making charcoal--if, indeed, so crude a process is worthy of  being dignified by the name of an art--dates back to a remote antiquity,  and has been practiced with but little change for hundreds of years. It  is true that some improvements have been recently made, but these relate  to the recovery of certain volatile by-products which were formerly  lost.    Every one is familiar with the appearance and characteristics of  ordinary charcoal, yet I hope to show you this evening that we still  have something new to learn about its qualities and the unexpected  practical uses to which it may be applied.    We commonly regard charcoal as a brittle, readily combustible substance,  but we have before us specimens in which these qualities are  conspicuously absent. Here is a piece of carbonized cotton sheeting,  which may be rolled or folded over without breaking, and, as you see,  when placed in the flame of a Bunsen burner, the fibers may be heated  white hot in the air, and when removed from the flame, the material  shows no tendency to consume. Here, again, we have a piece of very fine  lace, which has been similarly carbonized, and displays the same  qualities of ductility and incombustibility.    These carbonized fabrics may be subjected to much more severe tests with  impunity; and when I tell you that they have been exposed to a bath of  molten iron without injury, you will readily admit that they possess  some qualities not ordinarily associated with charcoal. When removed  from the mould in which they were placed after the iron casting had  cooled, not a single fiber was consumed, but _upon the face of the  casting there was found a sharp and accurate reproduction of the design,  thus forming a die_. This die may be used for a variety of purposes,  such as embossing leather, stamping paper, sheet metal, etc., or for  producing ornamental surfaces upon such castings.    Some of the carbonized fabrics displayed upon the table are almost as  delicate as cobwebs, and one would naturally suppose that when a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1152"],[0,"The Story of the Volsungs (Volsunga Saga); with Excerpts from the Poetic Edda (#6)"],[1,"at Hlymdale, of Gudrun's dream, the magic potion of Grimhild,  the wedding of Sigurd consequent on that potion; of the wooing of  Brynhild for Gunnar, her marriage to him, of the quarrel of the Queens,  the brooding grief and wrath of Brynhild, and the interview of Sigurd  with her--of all this, the most dramatic and best-considered parts of  the tale, there is now no more left that retains its metrical form than  the few snatches preserved by the Sagaman, though many of the incidents  are alluded to in other poems.    Chap. xxx. is met by the poem called the \"Short Lay of Sigurd\",  which, fragmentary apparently at the beginning, gives us something of  Brynhild's awakening wrath and jealousy, the slaying of Sigurd, and the  death of Brynhild herself; this poem we have translated entire.    The Fragments of the \"Lay of Brynhild\" are what is left of a poem partly  covering the same ground as this last, but giving a different account  of Sigurd's slaying; it is very incomplete, though the Sagaman has drawn  some incidents from it; the reader will find it translated in our second  part.    But before the death of the heroine we have inserted entire into the  text as chap. xxxi. the \"First Lay of Gudrun\", the most lyrical, the  most complete, and the most beautiful of all the Eddaic poems; a  poem that any age or language might count among its most precious  possessions.    From this point to the end of the Saga it keeps closely to the Songs of  Edda; in chap. xxxii. the Sagaman has rendered into prose the \"Ancient  Lay of Gudrun\", except for the beginning, which gives again another  account of the death of Sigurd: this lay also we have translated.    The grand poem, called the \"Hell-ride of Brynhild\", is not represented  directly by anything in the prose except that the Sagaman has supplied  from it a link or two wanting in the \"Lay of Sigrdrifa\"; it will be  found translated in our second part.    The betrayal and slaughter of the Giukings or Niblungs, and the fearful  end of Atli and his sons, and court, are recounted in two lays, called  the \"Lays of Atli\"; the longest of these, the \"Greenland Lay of Atli\",  is followed closely by the Sagaman; the Shorter one we have translated.    The end of Gudrun, of her daughter by Sigurd and of her sons by her last  husband Jonakr, treated of in the last four chapters of the Saga, are  very grandly and poetically given in the songs called the \"Whetting of  Gudrun\", and the \"Lay of Hamdir\", which are also among our translations.    These are all the songs of the Edda which the Sagaman has dealt with;  but one other, the \"Lament of Oddrun\", we have translated on account of  its intrinsic merit.    As to the literary quality of this work we in say much, but we think we  may well trust the reader of poetic insight to break through whatever  entanglement of strange manners or unused element may at first trouble  him, and to meet the nature and beauty with which it is filled: we  cannot doubt that such a reader will be intensely touched by finding,  amidst all its wildness and remoteness, such a startling realism,  such subtilty, such close sympathy with all the passions that may move  himself to-day.    In conclusion, we must again say how strange it seems to us, that this  Volsung Tale, which is in fact an unversified poem, should never before  been translated into English. For this is the Great Story of the  North, which should be to all our race what the Tale of Troy was to the  Greeks--to all our race first, and afterwards, when the change of the  world has made our race nothing more than a name of what has been--a  story too--then should it be to those that come after us no less than  the Tale of Troy has been to us.    WILLIAM MORRIS and EIRIKR MAGNUSSON.        ENDNOTES:    (1)  Chapter viii.--DBK.          THE STORY OF THE VOLSUNGS AND NIBLUNGS.        CHAPTER I. Of Sigi, the Son of Odin.    Here begins the tale, and tells of a man who was named Sigi, and called  of men the son of Odin; another man withal is told of in the tale, hight  Skadi, a great man and mighty of his hands; yet was Sigi the mightier  and the higher of kin, according to the speech of men of that time.  Now Skadi had a thrall with whom the story must deal somewhat, Bredi by  name, who was called after that work which he had to do; in prowess and  might of hand he was equal to men who were held more worthy, yea, and  better than some thereof.    Now it is to be told that, on a time, Sigi fared to the hunting of the  deer, and the thrall with him; and they hunted deer day-long till the  evening; and when they gathered together their prey in the evening, lo,  greater and more by far was that which Bredi had slain than Sigi's prey;  and this thing he much misliked, and he said that great wonder it was  that a very thrall should out-do him in the hunting of deer: so he  fell on him and slew him, and buried the body of him thereafter in a  snow-drift.    Then he went home at evening tide and says that Bredi had ridden away  from him into the wild-wood. \"Soon was he out of my sight,\" he says,  \"and naught more I wot of him.\"    Skadi misdoubted the tale of Sigi, and deemed that this was a guile of  his, and that he would have slain Bredi. So he sent men to seek for him,  and to such an end came their seeking, that they found him in a certain  snow-drift; then said Skadi, that men should call that snow-drift  Bredi's Drift from henceforth; and thereafter have folk followed, so  that in such wise they call every drift that is right great.    Thus it is well seen that Sigi has slain the thrall and murdered him; so  he is given forth to be a wolf in holy places, (1) and may no more abide  in the land with his father; therewith Odin bare him fellowship from the  land, so long a way, that right long it was, and made no stay till he  brought him to certain war-ships. So Sigi falls to lying out a-warring  with the strength that his father gave him or ever they parted; and  happy was he in his warring, and ever prevailed, till he brought  it about that he won by his wars land and lordship at the last; and  thereupon he took to him a noble wife, and became a great and mighty  king, and ruled over the land of the Huns, and was the greatest of  warriors. He had a son by his wife, who was called Refir, who grew up in  his father's house, and soon became great of growth, and shapely.        ENDNOTES:    (1)  \"Wolf in holy places,\" a man put out of the pale of society         for crimes, an outlaw.        CHAPTER II. Of the Birth of Volsung, the Son of Rerir, who was the Son  of Sigi.    Now Sigi grew old, and had many to envy him, so that at last those  turned against him whom he trusted most; yea, even the brothers of his  wife; for these fell on him at his unwariest, when there were few  with him to withstand them, and brought so many against him, that they  prevailed against him, and there fell Sigi and all his folk with him.  But Rerir, his son, was not in this trouble, and he brought together so  mighty a strength of his friends and the great men of the land, that  he got to himself both the lands and kingdom of Sigi his father; and so  now, when he deems that the feet under him stand firm in his rule, then  he calls to mind that which he had against his mother's brothers, who  had slain his father. So the king gathers together a mighty army, and  therewith falls on his kinsmen, deeming that if he made their kinship  of small account, yet none the less they had first wrought evil against  him. So he wrought his will herein, in that he departed not from strife  before he had slain all his father's banesmen, though dreadful the deed  seemed in every wise. So now he gets land, lordship, and fee, and is  become a mightier man than his father before him.    Much wealth won in war gat Rerir to himself, and wedded a wife withal,  such as he deemed meet for him, and long they lived together, but had  no child to take the heritage after them; and ill-content they both were  with that, and prayed the Gods with heart and soul that they might get  them a child. And so it is said that Odin hears their prayer, and Freyia  no less hearkens wherewith they prayed unto her: so she, never lacking  for all good counsel, calls to her her casket-bearing may, (1) the  daughter of Hrimnir the giant, and sets an apple in her hand, and bids  her bring it to the king. She took the apple, and did on her the gear of  a crow, and went flying till she came whereas the king sat on a mound,  and there she let the apple fall into the lap of the king; but he took  the apple, and deemed he knew whereto it would avail; so he goes home  from the mound to his own folk, and came to the queen, and some deal of  that apple she ate.    So, as the tale tells, the queen soon knew that she big with child, but  a long time wore or ever she might give birth to the child: so it befell  that the king must needs go to the wars, after the custom of kings, that  he may keep his own land in peace: and in this journey it came to pass  that Rerir fell sick and got his death, being minded to go home to Odin,  a thing much desired of many folk in those days.    Now no otherwise it goes with the queen's sickness than heretofore, nor  may she be the lighter of her child, and six winters wore away with the  sickness still heavy on her; so that at the last she feels that she may  not live long; wherefore now she bade cut the child from out of her; and  it was done even as she bade; a man-child was it, and great of growth  from his birth, as might well be; and they say that the youngling kissed  his mother or ever she died; but to him is a name given, and he is  called Volsung; and he was king over Hunland in the room of his father.  From his early years he was big and strong, and full of daring in all  manly deeds and trials, and he became the greatest of warriors, and of  good hap in all the battles of his warfaring.    Now when he was fully come to man's estate, Hrimnir "]]]
