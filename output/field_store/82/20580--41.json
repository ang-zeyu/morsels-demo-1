The  first shepherds observed that the stars moved in a regular course, and  made use of them to guide their journeys across the plains of the  desert. Such was the origin of the mathematical and physical sciences.  Once convinced that it could combat nature by the means which she  herself afforded, genius reposed no more, it watched her without  relaxation, it made incessantly new conquests over her, all of them  distinguished by some improvement in the situation of our race. From  that time a succession of conducting minds, faithful depositories of  the attainments already made, constantly occupied in connecting them,  in vivifying them by means of each other, have conducted us, in less  than forty ages, from the first essays of rude observers to the  profound calculations of Newton and La Place, to the learned  classifications of Linnaeus and Jussieu. This precious inheritance,  perpetually increasing, brought from Chaldea into Egypt, from Egypt  into Greece, concealed during ages of disaster and of darkness  recovered in more fortunate times, unequally spread among the nations  of Europe, has everywhere been followed by wealth and power; the  nations which have reaped it are become the mistresses of the world;  such as have neglected it, are fallen into weakness and obscurity.    _Curtis's Lectures on the Ear._           *       *       *       *       *      THE CAUSES OF DISEASE.      Daily observation demonstrates that the human structure, even in its  most perfect formation is liable to lesions of organization and  derangment of function, producing that state of the system in which  its usual actions or perceptions are either interrupted or attended  with pain--this state is called disease. Every animal carries within  itself the germ of its own destruction, or, in other words, it is  formed for a limited existence. Many diseases, therefore arise  spontaneously, or without any assignable external cause; but many more  are produced by causes, over which we have some control, and perhaps  the chief source of the physical ills to which we are liable, is the  deviation we make from the simplicity of nature. The injurious  influence that domestication has upon the health of the lower animals  is very strikingly apparent; and in proportion as their subjugation is  more complete, and their manner of life differs more widely from that  which is natural to them, so are their diseases more numerous and  severe. The diseases of our more valuable domestic animals are  sufficiently numerous and important to employ a particular class of  men; and the horse alone has professional assistance appropriated to  him. Men of education and talent have devoted themselves to the  investigation of the diseases of this noble and useful creature. The  poor little canary birds confined in their prisons, are very liable to  disease, more especially inflammation of the bowels, asthma, epilepsy,  and soreness of the bill. No animal deviates so far from the  simplicity of nature in its habits, as man; none is placed under the  influence of so many circumstances, calculated to act unfavourably  upon the frame. His morbid affections are hence abundant and  diversified, as may be seen by referring to the different nosological  arrangements; these long catalogues of diseases affording strong  evidence that man has not carefully followed that way of life which  has been marked out for him by nature. The crowded state of the  inhabitants of large cities; the injurious effects of an atmosphere  loaded with impurities; sedentary occupations; various unwholesome  avocations; intemperance in food; stimulating drinks; high-seasoned  and indigestible viands (and these taken hastily in the short  intervals allowed by the hurry and turmoil of business); the constant  inordinate activity of the great central circulation, kept up by the  double impulse of luxurious habits and high mental exertions; the  violent passions by which we are agitated and enervated; the various  disappointments and vexations to which all are liable, reacting upon  and disturbing the whole frame; the delicacy and sensibility to  external influences, caused by heated rooms, too warm clothing, and  other indulgencies; are all contrary to the voice of nature, and they  produce those morbid conditions of the system which a more simple and  uniform mode of living would prevent. Our associates of the animal  kingdom do not escape the influence of such causes: the mountain  shepherd and his dog are equally hardy, and form an instructive  contrast between a delicate lady and her lap-dog; the extreme point of  degeneracy and imbecility of which each race is susceptible. In the  early ages of society man enjoyed long life, his manner of living was  simple, his food, habitation, and pursuits, were all calculated to  fortify the body, and no anxious cares disturbed his mind.    _Curtis's Essay on the Deaf and Dumb._           *       *       *       *       *      REFORM OF CRIMINAL LAW.      How noble and pure was the ambition of Sir Samuel Romilly we may learn  from the following beautiful passages, where he has explained the  motives by which he was actuated in his proposed reforms of the  criminal law. \"It was not,\" said he, \"from light motives---it was from  no fanciful notions of benevolence, that I have ventured to suggest  any alteration in the criminal law of England. It has originated in  many years' reflection, and in the long-established belief that a  mitigation of the severe penalties of our law will be one of the most  effectual modes to preserve and advance the humanity and justice for  which this country is so eminently distinguished. Since the last  session of parliament, I have repeatedly reconsidered the subject: I  am more and more firmly convinced of the strength of the foundation  upon which I stand; and even if I had doubted my own conclusions, I  cannot forget the ability with which I was supported within these  walls; nor can be insensible to the humane and enlightened philosophy  by which, in contemplative life, this advancement of kindness has been  recommended. I cannot, therefore, hastily abandon a duty which, from  my success in life, I owe to my profession--which, as a member of this  house, I owe to you and to my country--and which, as a man blessed  with more than common prosperity, I owe to the misguided and  unfortunate.\"    _Roscoe's Lives of Eminent Lawyers._           *       *       *       *       *      AN UPRIGHT JUDGE.      The character of Sir Matthew Hale as a judge was splendidly  pre-eminent. His learning was profound; his patience unconquerable;  his integrity stainless. In the words of one who wrote with no  friendly feeling towards him, \"his voice was oracular, and his person  little less than adored.\" The temper of mind with which he entered  upon the duties of the bench is best exemplified in the following  resolutions, which appear to be composed on his being raised to the  dignity of chief baron at the restoration.    \"Things necessary to be continually had in remembrance:--    \"1. That in the administration of justice I am intrusted for God, the  king, and country; and therefore,    \"2. That it be done--1. uprightly; 2. deliberately; 3. resolutely.    \"3. That I rest not upon my own understanding or strength, but implore  and rest upon the direction and strength of God.    \"4. That in the exertion of justice I carefully lay aside my own  passions, and not give way to them, however provoked.    \"5. That I be wholly intent upon the business I am about, remitting  all other cares and thoughts as unseasonable and interruptions.    \"6. That I suffer not myself to be pre-possessed with any judgment at  all, till the whole business and both parties be heard.    \"7. That I never engage myself in the beginning of any cause, but  reserve myself unprejudiced till the whole be heard.    \"8. That in business capital, though my nature prompt me to pity, yet  to consider there is a pity also due to the country.    \"9. That I be not too rigid in matters purely conscientious, where all  the harm is diversity of judgment.    \"10. That I be not biassed with compassion to the poor, or favour to  the rich, in point of justice.    \"11. That popular or court applause or distaste have no influence in  anything I do, in point of distribution of justice.    \"12. Not to be solicitous what men will say or think, so long as I  keep myself exactly according to the rule of justice.    \"13. If in criminals it be a measuring cast, to incline to mercy and  acquittal.    \"14. In criminals that consist merely in words, where no more harm  ensues, moderation is no injustice.    \"15. In criminals of blood, if the fact be evident, severity is  justice.    \"16. To abhor all private solicitations, of what kind soever, and by  whomsoever, in matters depending.    \"17. To charge my servants--1. Not to interpose in any matter  whatsoever; 2. Not to take more than their known fees; 3. Not to give  any undue precedence to causes; 4. Not to recommend counsel.    \"18. To be short and sparing at meals, that I may be the fitter for  business.\"    Under the influence of resolutions like these, the conduct of Hale on  the bench appears to have been almost irreproachable.    _Ibidem._           *       *       *       *       *        THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.           *       *       *       *       *      DRYBURGH ABBEY.        'Twas morn--but not the ray which falls the summer boughs among,    When beauty walks in gladness forth, with all her light and song;    'Twas morn--but mist and cloud hung deep upon the lonely vale,    And shadows, like the wings of death, were out upon the gale.      For He whose spirit woke the dust of nations into life--    That o'er the waste and barren earth spread flowers and fruitage rife--    Whose genius, like the sun, illumed the mighty realms of mind--    Had fled for ever from the fame, love, friendship of mankind!      To wear a wreath"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11870"],[0,"The Country of the Blind, and Other Stories (#6)"],[1," its head streaked with blood,  still clutching and fumbling with the chain, and writhing in agony--a  cindery animal, an inhuman, monstrous creature that began a sobbing,  intermittent shriek.    Abruptly at the sight the ironmaster's anger passed. A deadly sickness  came upon him. The heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting up to his  nostrils. His sanity returned to him.    \"God have mercy upon me!\" he cried. \"O God! what have I done?\"    He knew the thing below him, save that it still moved and felt, was  already a dead man--that the blood of the poor wretch must be boiling in  his veins. An intense realisation of that agony came to his mind, and  overcame every other feeling. For a moment he stood irresolute, and then,  turning to the truck, he hastily tilted its contents upon the struggling  thing that had once been a man. The mass fell with a thud, and went  radiating over the cone. With the thud the shriek ended, and a boiling  confusion of smoke, dust, and flame came rushing up towards him. As it  passed, he saw the cone clear again.    Then he staggered back, and stood trembling, clinging to the rail with  both hands. His lips moved, but no words came to them.    Down below was the sound of voices and running steps. The clangour of  rolling in the shed ceased abruptly.            III.      THE STOLEN BACILLUS.      \"This again,\" said the Bacteriologist, slipping a glass slide under the  microscope, \"is well,--a preparation of the Bacillus of cholera--the  cholera germ.\"    The pale-faced man peered down the microscope. He was evidently not  accustomed to that kind of thing, and held a limp white hand over his  disengaged eye. \"I see very little,\" he said.    \"Touch this screw,\" said the Bacteriologist; \"perhaps the microscope is  out of focus for you. Eyes vary so much. Just the fraction of a turn this  way or that.\"    \"Ah! now I see,\" said the visitor. \"Not so very much to see after all.  Little streaks and shreds of pink. And yet those little particles, those  mere atomies, might multiply and devastate a city! Wonderful!\"    He stood up, and releasing the glass slip from the microscope, held it in  his hand towards the window. \"Scarcely visible,\" he said, scrutinising the  preparation. He hesitated. \"Are these--alive? Are they dangerous now?\"    \"Those have been stained and killed,\" said the Bacteriologist. \"I wish,  for my own part, we could kill and stain every one of them in the  universe.\"    \"I suppose,\" the pale man said, with a slight smile, 'that you scarcely  care to have such things about you in the living--in the active state?\"    \"On the contrary, we are obliged to,\" said the Bacteriologist.  \"Here, for instance--\" He walked across the room and took up one of  several sealed tubes. \"Here is the living thing. This is a cultivation of  the actual living disease bacteria.\" He hesitated. \"Bottled cholera, so to  speak.\"    A slight gleam of satisfaction appeared momentarily in the face of the  pale man. \"It's a deadly thing to have in your possession,\" he said,  devouring the little tube with his eyes. The Bacteriologist watched the  morbid pleasure in his visitor's expression. This man, who had visited him  that afternoon with a note of introduction from an old friend, interested  him from the very contrast of their dispositions. The lank black hair and  deep grey eyes, the haggard expression and nervous manner, the fitful yet  keen interest of his visitor were a novel change from the phlegmatic  deliberations of the ordinary scientific worker with whom the  Bacteriologist chiefly associated. It was perhaps natural, with a hearer  evidently so impressionable to the lethal nature of; his topic, to take  the most effective aspect of the matter.    He held the tube in his hand thoughtfully. \"Yes, here is the pestilence  imprisoned. Only break such a little tube as this into a supply of  drinking-water, say to these minute particles of life that one must needs  stain and examine with the highest powers of the microscope even to see,  and that one can neither smell nor taste--say to them, 'Go forth, increase  and multiply, and replenish the cisterns,' and death--mysterious,  untraceable death, death swift and terrible, death full of pain and  indignity--would be released upon this city, and go hither and thither  seeking his victims. Here he would take the husband from the wife, here  the child from its mother, here the statesman from his duty, and here the  toiler from his trouble. He would follow the water-mains, creeping along  streets, picking out and punishing a house here and a house there where  they did not boil their drinking-water, creeping into the wells of the  mineral water makers, getting washed into salad, and lying dormant in  ices. He would wait ready to be drunk in the horse-troughs, and by unwary  children in the public fountains. He would soak into the soil, to reappear  in springs and wells at a thousand unexpected places. Once start him at  the water supply, and before we could ring him in, and catch him again,  he would have decimated the metropolis.\"    He stopped abruptly. He had been told rhetoric was his weakness.    \"But he is quite safe here, you know--quite safe.\"    The pale-faced man nodded. His eyes shone. He cleared his throat. \"These  Anarchist--rascals,\" said he, \"are fools, blind fools--to use bombs when  this kind of thing is attainable. I think----\"    A gentle rap, a mere light touch of the finger-nails, was heard at the  door. The Bacteriologist opened if. \"Just a minute, dear,\" whispered his  wife.    When he re-entered the laboratory his visitor was looking at his watch. \"I  had no idea I had wasted an hour of your time,\" he said. \"Twelve minutes  to four. I ought to have left here by half-past three. But your things  were really too interesting. No, positively I cannot stop a moment longer.  I have an engagement at four.\"    He passed out of the room reiterating his thanks, and the Bacteriologist  accompanied him to the door, and then returned thoughtfully along the  passage to his laboratory. He was musing on the ethnology of his visitor.  Certainly the man was not a Teutonic type nor a common Latin one. \"A  morbid product, anyhow, I am afraid,\" said the Bacteriologist to himself.  \"How he gloated over those cultivations of disease germs!\" A disturbing  thought struck him. He turned to the bench by the vapour bath, and then  very quickly to his writing-table. Then he felt hastily in his pockets and  then rushed to the door. \"I may have put it down on the hall table,\" he  said.    \"Minnie!\" he shouted hoarsely in the hall.    \"Yes, dear,\" came a remote voice.    \"Had I anything in my hand when I spoke to you, dear, just now?\"    Pause.    \"Nothing, dear, because I remember----\"    \"Blue ruin!\" cried the Bacteriologist, and incontinently ran to the front  door and down the steps of his house to the street.    Minnie, hearing the door slam violently, ran in alarm to the window. Down  the street a slender man was getting into a cab. The Bacteriologist,  hatless, and in his carpet slippers, was running and gesticulating wildly  towards this group. One slipper came off, but he did not wait for it. \"He  has gone _mad_!\" said Minnie; \"it's that horrid science of his\"; and,  opening the window, would have called after him. The slender man, suddenly  glancing round, seemed struck with the same idea of mental disorder. He  pointed hastily to the Bacteriologist, said something to the cabman, the  apron of the cab slammed, the whip swished, the horse's feet clattered,  and in a moment cab and Bacteriologist hotly in pursuit, had receded up  the vista of the roadway and disappeared round the corner.    Minnie remained straining out of the window for a minute. Then she drew  her head back into the room again. She was dumbfounded. \"Of course he is  eccentric,\" she meditated. \"But running about London--in the height of the  season, too--in his socks!\" A happy thought struck her. She hastily put  her bonnet on, seized his shoes, went into the hall, took down his hat and  light overcoat from the pegs, emerged upon the doorstep, and hailed a cab  that opportunely crawled by. \"Drive me up the road and round Havelock  Crescent, and see if we can find a gentleman running about in a velveteen  coat and no hat.\"    \"Velveteen coat, ma'am, and no 'at. Very good, ma'am.\" And the cabman  whipped up at once in the most matter-of-fact way, as if he drove to this  address every day in his life.    Some few minutes later the little group of cabmen and loafers that  collects round the cabman's shelter at Haverstock Hill were startled by  the passing of a cab with a ginger-coloured screw of a horse, driven  furiously.    They were silent as it went by, and then as it receded--\"That's 'Arry  'Icks. Wot's _he_ got?\" said the stout gentleman known as Old  Tootles.    \"He's a-using his whip, he is, _to_ rights,\" said the ostler boy.    \"Hullo!\" said poor old Tommy Byles; \"here's another bloomin' loonatic.  Blowed if there ain't.\"    \"It's old George,\" said Old Tootles, \"and he's drivin' a loonatic,  _as_ you say. Ain't he a-clawin' out of the keb? Wonder if he's after  'Arry 'Icks?\"    The group round the cabman's shelter became animated. Chorus: \"Go it,  George!\" \"It's a race.\" \"You'll ketch 'em!\" \"Whip up!\"    \"She's a goer, she is!\" said the ostler boy.    \"Strike me giddy!\" cried Old Tootles. \"Here! _I'm_ a-goin' to begin  in a minute. Here's another comin'. If all the cabs in Hampstead ain't  gone mad this morning!\"    \"It's a fieldmale this time,\" said the ostler boy.    \"She's a-followin' _him_,\" said Old Tootles. \"Usually the other way  about.\"    \"What's she got in her 'and?\"    \"Looks like a 'igh 'at.\"    \"What a bloomin' lark it is! Three to one on old George,\" said the ostler  boy. \"Nexst!\"    Minnie went by in a perfect roar of applause. She did not like it, but she  felt that she was doing her duty, and whirled on down Haverstock Hill and  Camden Town High Street with "]]]
