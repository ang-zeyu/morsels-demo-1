The ghosts are afraid of swords in Homer, yet Sibylla tells  Aeneas in Virgil, that the then habit of spirits was beyond the force of  weapons. The spirits put off their malice with their bodies; and Caesar  and Pompey accord in Latin hell; yet Ajax in Homer, endures not a  conference with Ulysses.    In Painting alone we have a rich harvest. Burgoyne in his travels,  notices a painting in Spain, where Abraham is preparing to shoot Isaac  _with a pistol!_    There is a painting at Windsor, of Antonio Verrio, in which, he has  introduced himself, Sir Godfrey Kneller, and Bap. May, surveyor of the  works, in long periwigs, as spectators of Christ healing the sick.    In the Luxembourg is a picture of Reubens, in which are the queen-mother  in council, with two cardinals, and _Mercury!_    There may be, also, a sort of anachronism of the limbs, as in the case of  the painter of Toledo, who painted the story of the three wise men of the  east coming to worship, and bringing their presents to our Lord, upon his  birth, at Bethlehem, whence he presents them as three Arabian, or Indian  kings; two of them are white, and one of them black; but, unhappily, when  he drew the latter part of them kneeling, which, to be sure, was done  after their faces, their legs being necessarily a little intermixed, he  made three black feet for the negro king, and but three white feet for  the two white kings; and yet never discovered the mistake till the piece  was presented to the king, and hung up in the great church.    There was, also, in the Houghton Hall collection, Velvet Brughel's  Adoration of the Magi, in which were a multitude of figures, all finished  with the greatest Dutch exactness; in fact, the ideas are rather a little  too Dutch, for the Ethiopian king is dressed in a surplice, with boots  and spurs, and brings, for a present, a gold model of a modern ship.    The monks of a certain monastery at Messina, exhibited, with great  triumph, a letter written by the Virgin Mary with her own hand. Unluckily  for them, this was not, as it easily might have been, written on the  ancient papyrus, but on paper made of rags. On some occasion, a visiter,  to whom this was shown, observed, with affected solemnity, that the  letter involved also a miracle, for the paper on which it was written was  not in existence till several hundred years after the mother of our Lord  had ascended into heaven.    In the church of St. Zacharia, at Venice, is the picture of a Virgin and  Child, whom an angel is entertaining with an air upon the violin. Jean  Belin was the artist, in 1500. So, also, in the college library of  Aberdeen, to a very neat Dutch missal, are appended elegant paintings on  the margin, of the angels appearing to the shepherds, with one of the men  playing on the bagpipes.    There is a picture in a church at Bruges that puts not only all  chronology, but all else, out of countenance. It is the marriage of Jesus  Christ with Saint Catherine of Sienna. But who marries them? St. Dominic,  the patron of the church. Who joins their hands? Why, the Virgin Mary.  And to crown the anachronism, King David plays the harp at the wedding!    Albert Durer represented an angel in a flounced petticoat, driving Adam  and Eve from Paradise.    Lewis Cigoli painted a picture of the Circumcision of the Holy Child,  Jesus, and drew the high priest, Simeon, with spectacles on his nose;  upon a supposition, probably, that, in respect of his great age, that aid  would be necessary. Spectacles, however, were not known for fourteen  centuries afterwards.    In a picture painted by F. Chello della Puera, the Virgin Mary is placed  on a velvet sofa, playing with a cat and a paroquet, and about to help  herself to coffee from an engraved coffee-pot.    In another, painted by Peter of Cortona, representing the reconciliation  of Jacob and Laban, (now in the French Museum), the painter has  represented a steeple or belfry rising over the trees. A belfry in the  mountains of Mesopotamia, in the time of Jacob!    N. Poussin's celebrated picture, at the same place, of Rebecca at the  Well, has the whole back-ground decorated with Grecian architecture.    Paul Veronese placed Benedictine fathers and _Swiss soldiers_ among his  paintings from the Old Testament.    A painter, intending to describe the miracle of the fishes listening to  the preaching of St. Anthony of Padua, painted the lobsters, who were  stretching out of the water, _red!_ probably having never seen them in  their natural state. Being asked how he could justify this anachronism,  he extricated himself by observing, that the whole affair was a miracle,  and that thus the miracle was made still greater.    In the Notices des MSS. du Roi VI. 120, in the illuminations of a  manuscript Bible at Paris, under the Psalms, are two persons playing at  cards; and under Job and the Prophets are coats of arms and a windmill.    Poussin, in his picture of the Deluge has painted boats, not then  invented. St. Jerome, in another place, with a clock by his side; a thing  unknown in that saint's days.--_Nous revenons._           *       *       *       *       *          THE TOPOGRAPHER           *       *       *       *       *    VIRGINIA WATER,    (_The favourite Retreat of his Majesty_.)      Virginia Water was planted, and the lake executed, under the direction of  Paul Sandby, at a time when this part of Windsor Forest was the favourite  residence of Duke William of Cumberland. The artificial water is the  largest in the kingdom, with the single exception of Blenheim; the  cascade is, perhaps, the most striking imitation we have of the great  works of nature; and the grounds are arranged in the grandest style of  landscape-gardening. The neighbouring scenery is bold and rugged, being  the commencement of Bagshot Heath; and the variety of surface agreeably  relieves the eye, after the monotony of the first twenty miles from town,  which fatigues the traveller either upon the Bath or Western roads. At  the time when the public were allowed to visit Virginia Water, the best  point of entrance was at the gate at Bishopsgate; near which very pretty  village, or rather green, the Royal Lodge is at present situated. Shelley,  who had a true eye for the picturesque, resided for some time at this  place; and it would have been difficult for a poet to have found, in any  of the highly cultivated counties of England, a spot so full of the most  exquisite variety of hill and dale, of wood and water,--so fitted to call  forth and cherish the feelings upon which poetry must depend for its  peculiar nurture.    Bishopsgate is situated about a mile to the right of the western road  from London, after you ascend the hill beyond Egham. To the left, St.  Anne's Hill, the favoured residence of Charles Fox, is a charming object;  and upon the ridge which the traveller ascends, is the spot which has  given a name to Denham's celebrated poem. \"Cooper's Hill\" is not shut out  from the contemplative searchers after the beauties of nature; and,  however the prospect here may be exceeded by scenes of wider extent, or  more striking grandeur, certainly the _locale_ of the earliest, and  perhaps the best, descriptive poem of our language, is calculated to  produce the warmest feelings of admiration, both for its actual beauty  and its unrivalled associations. From an elevation of several hundred  feet, you look down upon a narrow fertile valley, through which the  Thames winds with surpassing loveliness. Who does not recollect the  charming lines with which Denham describes the \"silver river:\"--      \"Oh! could I flow thee, and make thy stream    My great example, as it is my theme;    Though deep, yet clear; though gentle, yet not dull;    Strong without rage; without o'erflowing full.\"      Immediately at your feet is the plain of Runnemede, where the great  battle between John and the Barons was fought; and in the centre of the  river is the little fishing island, where Magna Charta was signed. At the  extremity of the valley is Windsor Castle, rising up in all the pomp of  its massive towers. We recollect the scene as Windsor _was_. Whatever Mr.  Wyattville may have done for its internal improvement, and for its  adaptation to the purposes of a modern residence without sacrificing all  its character of antiquity, we fear that he has destroyed its picturesque  effect in the distant landscape. Its old characteristic feature was that  of a series of turrets rising above the general elevation. By raising the  intermediate roofs, without giving a proportionate height to the towers,  the whole line has become square and unbroken. This was, perhaps, an  unavoidable fault; but it is a fault.    From Cooper's Hill, the entrance to Virginia Water is a walk of a quarter  of an hour. We were accustomed to wander down a long and close plantation  of pines, where the rabbit ran across with scarcely a fear of man. A more  wild and open country succeeded; and we then followed the path, through  many a \"bosky bourn,\" till we arrived at a rustic bridge, which crossed  the lake at a narrow neck, where the little stream was gradually lost  amongst the underwood. A scene of almost unrivalled beauty here burst  upon the view. For nearly a mile, a verdant walk led along, amidst the  choicest evergreens, by the side of a magnificent breadth of water. The  opposite shore was rich with the heather-bloom; and plantations of the  most graceful trees--the larch, the ash, and the weeping birch (\"the lady  of the woods\"), broke the line of the wide lake, and carried the  imagination on, in the belief that some mighty river lay beyond that  screening wood. The cascade was at length reached. Cascades are much upon  the same plan, whether natural or artificial; the scale alone makes the  difference. This cascade is sufficiently large not to look like a  plaything; and if it were met with in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11282"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Under colour of the last graine, oates, it being the latest harvest,  they doe (without mercy in hotte bloud) steale, robbe orchards, gardens,  hop-yards, and crab trees; so what with leazing and stealing, they doe  poorly maintaine themselves November, December, and almost all January,  with some healpes from the neighbourhood.    The last three moneths, February, March, and Aprill, little labour serves  their turne, they hope by the heat of the sunne, (seasoning themselves,  like snakes, under headges,) to recover the month of May with much  poverty, long fasting, and little praying; and so make an end of their  yeares travel in the Easter holy days.           *       *       *       *       *      BEGGARS.      In the earlier periods of their history, both in England and Scotland,  beggars were generally of such a description as to entitle them to the  epithet of _sturdy_; accordingly they appear to have been regarded often  as impostors and always as nuisances and pests. \"Sornares,\" so violently  denounced in those acts, were what are here called \"masterful beggars,\"  who, when they could not obtain what they asked for by fair means, seldom  hesitated to take it by violence. The term is said to be Gaelic, and to  import a soldier. The life of such a beggar is well described in the  \"Belman of London,\" printed in 1608--\"The life of a beggar is the life of  a souldier. He suffers hunger and cold in winter, and heate and thirste  in summer; he goes lowsie, he goes lame; he is not regarded; he is not  rewarded; here only shines his glorie. The whole kingdome is but his walk;  a whole cittie is but his parish. In every man's kitchen is his meate  dressed; in every man's sellar lyes his beere; and the best men's purses  keepe a penny for him to spend.\"           *       *       *       *       *      CURIOUS MANORIAL CUSTOM.      At King's Hill, about half a mile north-east of Rocford Church, Essex, is  held what is called the _Lawless Court_, a whimsical custom, the origin  of which is not known. On the Wednesday morning next after Michaelmas day,  the tenants are bound to attend upon the first cock-crowing, and to kneel  and do their homage, without any kind of light, but such as heaven will  afford. The steward of the court calls all such as are bound to appear,  with as low a voice as possible, giving no notice when he goes to execute  his office; however, he that does not give an answer is deeply amerced.  They are all to whisper to each other, nor have they any pen and ink, but  supply that deficiency with a coal; and he that owes suit and service,  and appears not, forfeits to the lord of the manor double his rent every  hour he is absent.    A tenant, some years ago, forfeited his land for non attendance, but was  restored to it, the lord taking only a fine.

Dogs, when they are sure of having their own way, have sometimes ways as  odd as those of the unfurred, unfeathered animals, who walk on two legs,  and talk, and are called rational. My beautiful, white greyhound,  Mayflower, for instance, is as whimsical as the finest lady in the land.  Amongst her other fancies, she has taken a violent affection for a most  hideous stray dog, who made his appearance here about six months ago,  and contrived to pick up a living in the village, one can hardly tell  how. Now appealing to the charity of old Rachael Strong, the  laundress--a dog-lover by profession; now winning a meal from the  light-footed and open-hearted lasses at the Rose; now standing on his  hind-legs to extort, by sheer beggary, a scanty morsel from some pair of  \"drowthy cronies,\" or solitary drover, discussing his dinner or supper  on the alehouse-bench; now catching a mouthful, flung to him in pure  contempt by some scornful gentleman of the shoulder-knot, mounted on his  throne, the coach-box, whose notice he had attracted by dint of  ugliness; now sharing the commons of Master Keep the shoemaker's pigs;  now succeeding to the reversion of the well-gnawed bone of Master Brow  the shopkeeper's fierce house-dog; now filching the skim-milk of Dame  Wheeler's cat:--spit at by the cat; worried by the mastiff; chased by  the pigs; screamed at by the dame; stormed at by the shoemaker; flogged  by the shopkeeper; teased by all the children, and scouted by all the  animals of the parish;--but yet living through his griefs, and bearing  them patiently, \"for sufferance is the badge of all his tribe;\"--and  even seeming to find, in an occasional full meal, or a gleam of  sunshine, or a whisp of dry straw, on which to repose his sorry carcass,  some comfort in his disconsolate condition.    In this plight was he found by May, the most high-blooded and  aristocratic of greyhounds; and from this plight did May rescue him;--  invited him into her territory, the stable; resisted all attempts to  turn him out; reinstated him there, in spite of maid, and boy, and  mistress, and master; wore out every body's opposition, by the activity  of her protection, and the pertinacity of her self-will; made him sharer  of her bed and her mess; and, finally, established him as one of the  family as firmly as herself.    Dash--for he has even won himself a name amongst us, before he was  anonymous--Dash is a sort of a kind of a spaniel; at least there is in  his mongrel composition some sign of that beautiful race. Besides his  ugliness, which is of the worst sort--that is to say, the shabbiest--he  has a limp on one leg that gives a peculiarly one-sided awkwardness to  his gait; but, independently of his great merit in being May's pet, he  has other merits which serve to account for that phenomenon--being,  beyond all comparison the most faithful, attached, and affectionate  animal that I have ever known; and that is saying much. He seems to think  it necessary to atone for his ugliness by extra good conduct, and does so  dance on his lame leg, and so wag his scrubby tail, that it does any one,  who has a taste for happiness, good to look at him--so that he may now be  said to stand on his own footing. We are all rather ashamed of him when  strangers come in the way, and think it necessary to explain that he is  May's pet; but amongst ourselves, and those who are used to his  appearance, he has reached the point of favouritism in his own person. I  have, in common with wiser women, the feminine weakness of loving  whatever loves me--and, therefore, like Dash. His master has found out  that Dash is a capital finder, and, in spite of his lameness, will hunt a  field, or beat a cover with any spaniel in England--and, therefore, _he_  likes Dash. The boy has fought a battle, in defence of his beauty, with  another boy, bigger than himself, and beat his opponent most handsomely--  and, therefore, _he_ likes Dash; and the maids like him, or pretend to  like him, because we do--as is the fashion of that pliant and imitative  class. And now Dash and May follow us every where, and are going with us  now to the Shaw, or rather to the cottage by the Shaw, to bespeak milk  and butter of our little dairy-woman, Hannah Bint--a housewifely  occupation, to which we owe some of our pleasantest rambles--_Miss  Mitford_.--_Month.

When we were last, my gentle Maid,      In love's embraces twining,    'Twas Night, who saw, and then betray'd!      \"Who saw?\" Yon Moon was shining.    A gossip Star shot down, and he    First told our secret to the Sea.      The Sea, who never secret kept,      The peevish, blustering railer!

The Sailor whisper'd it to his fair,    And she--she told it every where!    _New Monthly Magazine_.           *       *       *       *       *          NOTES OF A READER.           *       *       *       *       *    EELS.      The problem of the generation of eels is one of the most abstruse and  curious in natural history; but we have been much pleased, and not a  little enlightened, by some observations on the subject in Sir Humphrey  Davy's delightful little volume, _Salmonia_, of which the following is  the substance:--    Although the generation of eels occupied the attention of Aristotle, and  has been taken up by the most distinguished naturalists since his time,  it is still unsolved. Lacepede, the French naturalist, asserts, in the  most unqualified way, that they are _viviparous_; but we do not remember  any facts brought forward on the subject. Sir Humphrey then goes on to  say--This is certain, that there are two migrations of eels--one up and  one down rivers, one _from_ and the other _to_ the sea; the first in  spring and summer, the second in autumn or early winter. The first of  very small eels, which are sometimes not more than two or two and a half  inches long; the second of large eels, which sometimes are three or four  feet long, and which weigh from 10 to 15, or even 20 lbs. There is great  reason to believe that all eels found in fresh water are the results of  the first migration; they appear in millions in April and May, and  sometimes continue to rise as late even as July and the beginning of  August. I remember this was the case in Ireland in 1823. It had been a  cold, backward summer; and when I was at Ballyshannon, about the end of  July, the mouth of the river, which had been in flood all this month,  under the fall, was blackened by millions of little eels, about as long  as the finger, which were constantly urging their way up the moist rocks  by the side of the fall. Thousands died, but their bodies remaining moist,  served as the ladder for others to make their way; and I saw some  ascending even perpendicular"]]]
