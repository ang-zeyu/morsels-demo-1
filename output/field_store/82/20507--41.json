Yet such were the boons granted to Abraham, as the reward of faith and  obedience to the One true God,--the vital principle without which  religion dies into superstition, with which his descendants were  inspired not only to nationality and civil coherence, but to the highest  and noblest teachings the world has received from any people, and by  which his name is forever linked with the spiritual progress and  happiness of mankind.          JOSEPH.      ISRAEL IN EGYPT.      No one in his senses would dream of adding anything to the story of  Joseph, as narrated in Genesis, whether it came from the pen of Moses or  from some subsequent writer. It is a masterpiece of historical  composition, unequalled in any literature sacred or profane, in ancient  or modern times, for its simplicity, its pathos, its dramatic power, and  its sustained interest. Nor shall I attempt to paraphrase or re-tell it,  save by way of annotation and illustration of subjects connected with  it, having reference to the subsequent development of the Jewish nation  and character.    Joseph, the great-grandson of Abraham, was born at Haran in Mesopotamia,  probably during the XVIII. Century B.C., when his father Jacob was in  the service of Laban the Syrian. There was nothing remarkable in his  career until he was sold as a slave by his unnatural and jealous  brothers. He was the favorite son of the patriarch Jacob, by his  beloved Rachel, being the youngest, except Benjamin, of a large family  of twelve sons,--a beautiful and promising youth, with qualities which  peculiarly called out the paternal affections. In the inordinate love  and partiality of Jacob for this youth he gave to him, by way of  distinction, a decorated tunic, such as was worn only by the sons of  princes. The half-brothers of Joseph were filled with envy in view of  this unwise step on the part of their common father,--a proceeding  difficult to be reconciled with his politic and crafty nature; and their  envy ripened into hostility when Joseph, with the frankness of youth,  narrated his dreams, which signified his future pre-eminence and the  humiliation of his brothers. Nor were his dreams altogether pleasing to  his father, who rebuked him with this indignant outburst of feeling:  \"Shall I and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee on  the earth?\" But while the father pondered, the brothers were consumed  with hatred, for envy is one of the most powerful passions that move the  human soul, and is malignant in its developments. Strange to say, it is  most common in large families and among those who pass for friends. We  do not envy prosperous enemies with the virulence we feel for prosperous  relatives, who theoretically are our equals. Nor does envy cease until  inequality has become so great as to make rivalry preposterous: a  subject does not envy his king, or his generally acknowledged superior.  Envy may even give place to respect and deference when the object of it  has achieved fame and conceded power. Relatives who begin with jealousy  sometimes end as worshippers, but not until extraordinary merit, vast  wealth, or overtopping influence are universally conceded. Conceive of  Napoleon's brothers envying the great Emperor, or Webster's the great  statesman, or Grant's the great general, although the passion may have  lurked in the bosoms of political rivals and military chieftains.    But one thing certainly extinguishes envy; and that is death. Hence the  envy of Joseph's brothers, after they had sold him to a caravan of  Ishmaelite merchants, was succeeded by remorse and shame. Their  murmurings passed into lies. They could not tell their broken-hearted  father of their crime; they never told him. Jacob was led to suppose  that his favorite son was devoured by wild beasts; they added deceit and  cowardice to a depraved heartlessness, and nearly brought down the gray  hairs of their father to the grave. No subsequent humiliation or  punishment could be too severe for such wickedness. Although they were  destined to become the heads of powerful tribes, even of the chosen  people of God, these men have incurred the condemnation of all ages. But  Judah and Reuben do not come in for unlimited censure, since these sons  of Leah sought to save their brother from a violent death; and  subsequently in Egypt Judah looms up as a magnanimous character, whom we  admire almost as much as we do Joseph himself. What can be more eloquent  than his defence of Benjamin, and his appeal to what seemed to him to be  an Egyptian potentate!    The sale of Joseph as a slave is one of the most signal instances of the  providence of God working by natural laws recorded in all history,--more  marked even than the elevation of Esther and Mordecai. In it we see  permission of evil and its counteraction,--its conversion into good;  victory over evil, over conspiracy, treachery, and murderous intent. And  so marked is this lesson of a superintending Providence over all human  action, that a wise and good man can see wars and revolutions and  revolting crimes with almost philosophical complacency, knowing that out  of destruction proceeds creation; that the wrath of man is always  overruled; that the love of God is the brightest and clearest and most  consoling thing in the universe. We cannot interpret history without the  recognition of this fundamental truth. We cannot be unmoved amid the  prevalence of evil without this feeling, that God is more powerful than  all the combined forces of his enemies both on earth and in hell; and  that no matter what the evil is, it will surely be made to praise Him  who sitteth in the heavens. This is a sublime revelation of the  omnipotence and benevolence of a personal God, of his constant oversight  of the world which he has made.    The protection and elevation of Joseph, seemingly a natural event in  view of his genius and character, is in some respects a type of that  great sacrifice by which a sinful world has been redeemed. Little did  the Jews suspect when they crucified Jesus that he would arise from his  tomb and overturn the idolatries of nations, and found a religion which  should go on from conquering to conquer. Little did the gifted Burke see  in the atrocities of the French Revolution the overturning of a system  of injustices which for centuries had cried to Heaven for vengeance.  Still less did the proud and conservative citizens of New England  recognize in the cruelties of Southern slaveholders a crime which would  provoke one of the bloodiest wars of modern times, and lead to the  constitutional and political equality of the whites and blacks. Evil  appeared to triumph, but ended in the humiliation of millions and the  enfranchisement of humanity, when the cause of the right seemed utterly  hopeless. So let every one write upon all walls and houses and chambers,  upon his conscience and his intellect, \"The Lord God Omnipotent  reigneth, and will bring good out of the severest tribulation!\" And this  great truth applies not to nations alone, but to the humblest  individual, as he bows down in grief or wrath or penitence to  unlooked-for chastisement,--like Job upon his heap of ashes, or the  broken-hearted mother when afflicted with disease or poverty, or the  misconduct or death of children. There is no wisdom, no sound  philosophy, no religion, and no happiness until this truth is recognized  in all the changes and relations of life.    The history of Joseph in Egypt in all his varied fortunes is, as I have  said, a most memorable illustration of this cardinal and fundamental  truth. A favorite of fortune, he is sold as a slave for less than twenty  dollars of our money, and is brought to a foreign country,--a land  oppressed by kings and priests, yet in which is a high civilization, in  spite of social and political degradation. He is resold to a high  official of the Egyptian court, probably on account of his beauty and  intelligence. He rises in the service of this official,--captain of the  royal guard, or, as the critics tell us, superintendent of the police  and prisons,--for he has extraordinary abilities and great integrity,  character as well as natural genius, until he is unjustly accused of a  meditated crime by a wicked woman. It is evident that Potiphar, his  master, only half believes in Joseph's guilt, in spite of the  protestations of his artful and profligate wife, since instead of  summarily executing him, as Ahasuerus did Haman, he simply sends him to  a mild and temporary imprisonment in the prison adjacent to his palace.  Here Joseph wins the favor of his jailers and of his brother prisoners,  as Paul did nearly two thousand years later, and shows remarkable gifts,  even to the interpretation of dreams,--a wonderful faculty to  superstitious people like the Egyptians, and in which he exceeds even  their magicians and priests. The fame of his rare gifts, the most prized  in Egypt, reaches at last the ears of Pharaoh, who is troubled by a  singular dream which no one of his learned men can interpret. The Hebrew  slave interprets it, and is magnificently rewarded, becoming the prime  minister of an absolute monarch. The King gives him his signet ring,  emblem of power, and a collar or chain of gold, the emblem of the  highest rank; clothes him in a vestment of fine linen, makes him ride in  his second chariot, and appoints him"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10479"],[0,"Our Churches and Chapels: Their Parsons, Priests, & Congregations (#6)"],[1,"have an idea that they are going to get to heaven in  a plain way, and if they succeed, all the better--we were going to  say that they would be so much the more into pocket by it. Freedom  of thought, sincerity of heart, and going as straight to the point  as possible, is what they aim at. There are many seats in Cannon-  street Chapel, and, as it is said that hardly any of them are to  let, the reverend gentleman who makes a stipulated descent upon the  pew rents ought to be happy. It is but seldom the pews are well  filled:  they are not even crammed on collection Sundays; but they  are paid for, and if a congenial wrinkle does not lurk in that fact-  -for the minister--he will find neither the balm of Gilead nor a  doctor anywhere. The clerical notion is, that pew rents, as well as  texts; must be stuck to; and if those who pay and listen quietly  acquiesce, then it becomes a simple question of \"so mote it be\" for  outsiders.    The congregation at Cannon-street Chapel is made up of tolerably  respectable materials. It is no common Dissenting rendezvous for  ill-clad screamers and roaring enthusiasts. Neither fanatics nor  ejaculators find an abiding place in it. Not many poor people join  the charmed circle. A middle-class, shopkeeping halo largely  environs the assemblage. There is a good deal of pride, vanity,  scent, and silk-rustling astir in it every Sunday, just as there is  in every sacred throng; and the oriental, theory of caste is not  altogether ignored. The ordinary elements of every Christian  congregation are necessarily visible here--backsliders and newly-  caught communicants; ancient women duly converted and moderately  fond of tea, snuff, and charity; people who cough continually, and  will do so in their graves if not closely watched; parties, with the  Fates against them, who fly off periodically into fainting fits;  contented individuals, whose gastric juice flows evenly, who can  sleep through the most impassioned sermon with the utmost serenity;  weather-beaten orthodox souls who have been recipients of ever so  much daily grace for half a life time, and fancy they are  particularly near paradise; lofty and isolated beings who have a  fixed notion that they are quite as respectable if not as pious as  other people; easy-going well-dressed creatures \"whose life glides  away in a mild and amiable conflict between the claims of piety and  good breeding.\"    But the bulk are of a substantial, medium-going description--  practical, sharp, respectable, and naturally inclined towards a  free, well got up, reasonable theology. There is nothing inflamed in  them--nothing indicative of either a very thick or very thin skin.  Any of them will lend you a hymn book, and whilst none of them may  be inclined to pay your regular pew rent, the bulk will have no  objection to find you an occasional seat, and take care of you if  there would be any swooning in your programme. Clear-headed and full  of business, they believe with Binney in making the best of both  worlds. They will never give up this for the next, nor the next for  this. Into their curriculum there enters, as the American preacher  hath it, a sensible regard for piety and pickles, flour and  affection, the means of grace and good profits, crackers and faith,  sincerity and onions, benevolence, cheese, integrity, potatoes, and  wisdom--all remarkably good in their way, and calculated, when well  shaken up and applied, to Christianise anybody. The genteel portion  of the congregation principally locate themselves in the side seats  running from one end of the chapel to the other; the every day  mortals find a resting place in the centre and the galleries; the  poorer portion are pushed frontwards below, where they have an  excellent opportunity of inspecting the pulpit, of singing like  nightingales, of listening to every articulation of the preacher,  and of falling into a state of coma if they are that way disposed.    The music at this place of worship has been considerably improved  during recent times; but it is nothing very amazing yet. There is a  curtain amount of cadence, along with a fair share of power, in the  orchestral outbursts; the pieces the choir have off go well; those  they are new at rather hang fire; but we shall not parry with either  the conductor or the members on this point. They all manifest a  fairly-defined devotional feeling in their melody; turn their visual  faculties in harmony with the words:  expand and contract their  pulmonary processes with precision and if they mean what they sing,  they deserve better salaries than they usually get. They are aided  by an organ which is played well, and, we hope, paid for.    The minister of Cannon-street chapel is the Rev. H. J. Martyn, who  has had a good stay with \"the brethren,\" considering that their  fighting weight is pretty heavy, and that some of them were made to  \"have their way.\" Frequently Independents are in hot water  concerning their pastors. In Preston they are very exemplary in this  respect. The Grimshaw street folk have had a storm in a tea pot with  one of their ministers; so have the Lancaster-road Christians; and  so have the Cannon-street believers; and the beauty of it is, they  generally win. Born to have their own way in sacred matters, they  can turn off a parson, if they can't defeat him in argument. And  that is a great thing. They hold the purse strings; and no parson  can live unless he has a \"call\" to some other \"vineyard,\" if they  are closed against him. On the whole, the present minister of  Cannon-street Chapel has got on pretty evenly with his flock. He has  had odd skirmishes in his spiritual fold; and will have if he stays  in it for ever; but the sheep have a very fair respect for the  shepherd, and can \"paint the lily\" gracefully. A while since they  gave him leave of absence--paying his salary, of course, whilst  away--and on his return some of them got up a tea party on his  behalf and made him a presentation. There might be party spirit or  there might be absolute generosity in such a move; but the parson  was no loser--he enjoyed the out, and accepted with Christian  fortitude the gift. The Rev. H. J. Martyn is a small gentleman--  considerably below the average of parsons in physical proportion;  but he consoles himself with the thought that he is all right in  quality, if not in quantity. Diminutive men have generally very fair  notions of themselves; small men as a rule are smarter than those of  the bulky and adipose school; and, harmonising with this regulation,  Mr. Martyn is both sharp and kindly disposed towards himself. He is  not of opinion, like one of his predecessors, that he assisted at  the creation of the world, and that the endurance of Christianity  depends upon his clerical pivot; but he believes that he has a  \"mission,\" and that on the whole he is quite as good as the majority  of Congregational divines. There is nothing pretentious in his  appearance; nothing ecclesiastical in his general framework; and in  the street he looks almost as much like anybody else as like a  parson. The education of Mr. Martyn is equal to that of the average  of Dissenting ministers, and better than that of several. He is,  however, more of a reader than a thinker, and more of a speaker than  either. On the platform he can make as big a stir as men twice his  size. His delivery is moderately even; his words clear; and he can  throw a good dash of imagination into his language. In the pulpit,  to the foot of which place he is led every Sunday, by certain sacred  diaconal lamas, who previously \"rub him down\" and saddle him for  action, in a contiguous apartment--in the pulpit, we say, he  operates in a superior style, and he looks better there--more like a  parson--than anywhere else. He is here above the ordinary level of  his hearers; if it were not for the galleries, minute as may be his  physiology, he would be the loftiest being present; and if he wishes  to \"keep up appearances,\" we would advise him to remain in the  pulpit and have his meals there. Casting joking overboard--out of  the pulpit if you like--it may be said that Mr. Martyn as a preacher  has many fair qualities. It is true he has defects; but who has  not?--unless it be a deacon;--still there is something in his style  which indicates earnestness, something in his language,  demonstrative of culture and eloquence. His main pulpit fault is  that he \"goes off\" too soon and too frequently. In the course of a  sermon he will give you three or four perorations, and sometimes  wind up without treating you to one. There is nothing very  metaphysical in his subjects; sometimes he wanders slightly into  space; occasionally he exhausts himself in fighting out the  mysteries of faith, and grace, and justification; but in the  ordinary run of his talk you can get good pictures of practical  matters. He is a lover of nature, is fond of talking about the  sublime and the beautiful, conjointly with other things freely named  in Burke's essay, can pile up the agony with a good deal of ability,  and split the ears of the groundlings as the occasion requires. He  can get into a white heat quickly, or blow his solemn anger  gradually--wind it up by degrees, and make it burst at a given point  of feeling. He is a better declaimer than reasoner--has a stronger  flow of imagination than logic. There is nothing bitter or mocking  in his tone. He seldom flings the shafts of ridicule or irony. He  constructs calmly, and then sends up the rocket:  he draws you  slowly to a certain point, and then tells you to look out for \"it's  coming.\" His apparatus is well fixed; he can give you any kind of  dissolving view. His ecstacies are rapid and, therefore, soon over.  The level places in his sermons are rather heavy, and, at times,  uninteresting. It is only when the thermometer is rising that you  enjoy him, and only when he reaches the climax and explodes, that  you fall"]]]
