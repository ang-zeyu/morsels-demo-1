The lifting had strained her, and there were  patches of hide worn off her the size of breakfast-plates, sore and most  harrowing to look upon.    It takes great suffering to wring a moan from the patience of a cow. I  turned my head away, and with the impatience and one-sided reasoning  common to fifteen, asked God what He meant by this. It is well enough to  heap suffering on human beings, seeing it is supposed to be merely a  probation for a better world, but animals--poor, innocent animals--why  are they tortured so?    \"Come now, we'll lift her once more,\" said my father. At it we went  again; it is surprising what weight there is in the poorest cow. With  great struggling we got her to her feet once more, and were careful this  time to hold her till she got steady on her legs. Father and mother at  the tail and Blackshaw and I at the horns, we marched her home and gave  her a bran mash. Then we turned to our work in the house while the men  sat and smoked and spat on the veranda, discussing the drought for an  hour, at the end of which time they went to help someone else with their  stock. I made up the fire and we continued our ironing, which had been  interrupted some hours before. It was hot unpleasant work on such a day.  We were forced to keep the doors and windows closed on account of the  wind and dust. We were hot and tired, and our feet ached so that we  could scarcely stand on them.    Weariness! Weariness!    Summer is fiendish and life is a curse, I said in my heart.    Day after day the drought continued. Now and again there would be a few  days of the raging wind before mentioned, which carried the dry grass  off the paddocks and piled it against the fences, darkened the air with  dust, and seemed to promise rain, but ever it dispersed whence it came,  taking with it the few clouds it had gathered up; and for weeks and  weeks at a stretch, from horizon to horizon, was never a speck to mar  the cruel dazzling brilliance of the metal sky.    Weariness! Weariness!    I said the one thing many times but, ah, it was a weary thing which took  much repetition that familiarity might wear away a little of its  bitterness!          CHAPTER SIX    Revolt      In spite of our pottering and lifting, with the exception of five, all  our cows eventually died; and even these and a couple of horses had as  much as they could do to live on the whole of the thousand acres which,  without reserve, were at their disposal. They had hardly any grass--it  was merely the warmth and water which kept them alive. Needless to say,  we were on our beam-ends financially. However, with a little help from  more fortunate relatives, and with the money obtained from the sale of  the cowhides and mother's poultry, we managed to pay the interest on the  money borrowed from the bishop, and keep bread in our mouths.    Unfortunately for us, at this time the bishop's agent proved a scoundrel  and absconded. My father held receipts to show that to this agent he had  regularly paid the interest of the money borrowed; but through some  finicking point of law, because we had not money to contend with him,  his lordship the bishop now refused to acknowledge his agent and  one-time pillar of the cathedral, and, having law on his side, served a  writ on us. In the face of our misfortunes this was too much: we begged  for time, which plea he answered by putting in the bailiff and selling  everything we possessed. Our five cows, two horses, our milk separator,  plough, cart, dray, buggy, even our cooking utensils, books, pictures,  furniture, father's watch--our very beds, pillows, and blankets. Not a  thing besides what we stood up in was left us, and this was money for  the payment of which my father held receipts.    But for the generosity of our relatives we would have been in a pretty  plight. They sent us sufficient means to buy in everything, and our  neighbours came to our rescue with enthusiasm and warm-hearted genuine  sympathy. The bailiff--a gentleman to the core--seeing how matters  stood, helped us to the utmost of his power.    Our goods were disposed of on the premises, and the neighbours arranged  a mock sale, at which the bailiff winked. Our friends had sent the  money, and the neighbours did the bidding--none bidding against each  other--and thus our belongings went for a mere trifle. Every cloud has  its silver lining, and the black cloud of poverty has a very bright  silver lining.    In poverty you can get at the real heart of people as you can never do  if rich. People are your friends from pure friendship and love, not from  sponging self-interestedness. It is worth being poor once or twice in a  lifetime just to experience the blessing and heartrestfulness of a  little genuine reality in the way of love and friendship. Not that it is  impossible for opulence to have genuine friends, but rich people, I  fear, must ever have at their heart cankering suspicion to hint that the  friendship and love lavished upon them is merely self-interestedness and  sham, the implements of trade used by the fawning toadies who swarm  around wealth.    In conjunction with the bishop's name, the approaching sale of our goods  had been duly advertised in the local papers, and my father received  several letters of sympathy from the clergy deploring the conduct of the  bishop. These letters were from men unknown to father, who were unaware  that Richard Melvyn was being sold off for a debt already paid.    By the generosity of relatives and the goodness of neighbours as kind as  ever breathed, our furniture was our own again, but what were we to do  for a living? Our crops were withering in the fields for want of rain,  and we had but five cows--not an over-bright outlook. As I was getting  to bed one night my mother came into my room and said seriously,  \"Sybylla, I want to have a talk with you.\"    \"Talk away,\" I responded rather sullenly, for I expected a long  sing-song about my good-for-nothingness in general--a subject of which I  was heartily tired.    \"Sybylla, I've been studying the matter over a lot lately. It's no use,  we cannot afford to keep you at home. You'll have to get something to  do.\"    I made no reply, and my mother continued, \"I am afraid we will have to  break up the home altogether. It's no use; your father has no idea of  making a living. I regret the day I ever saw him. Since he has taken to  drink he has no more idea of how to make a living than a cat. I will  have to give the little ones to some of the relatives; the bigger ones  will have to go out to service, and so will your father and I. That's  all I can see ahead of us. Poor little Gertie is too young to go out in  the world (she was not twelve months younger than I); she must go to  your grandmother, I think.\"    I still made no reply, so my mother inquired, \"Well, Sybylla, what do  you think of the matter?\"    \"Do you think it absolutely necessary to break up the home?\" I said.    \"Well, you suggest something better if you are so clever,\" said mother,  crossly. \"That is always the way; if I suggest a thing it is immediately  put down, yet there is never any one to think of things but me. What  would you do? I suppose you think you could make a living on the place  for us yourself.\"    \"Why can't we live at home? Blackshaw and Jansen have no bigger places  than we, and families just as large, and yet they make a living. It  would be terrible for the little ones to grow up separated; they would  be no more to each other than strangers.\"    \"Yes; it is all very well for you to talk like that, but how is your  father to start again with only five cows in the world? It's no use, you  never talk sense. You'll find my way is always the best in the end.\"    \"Would it not be easier,\" I replied, \"for our relations to each give a  little towards setting us up again, than to be burdened with the whole  responsibility of rearing a child? I'm sure they'd much prefer it.\"    \"Yes, perhaps it would be better, but I think _you_ will have to get  your own living. What would they say about having to support such a big  girl as you are?\"    \"I will go and earn my own living, and when you get me weeded out of the  family you will have a perfect paradise. Having no evil to copy, the  children will grow up saints,\" I said bitterly.    \"Now, Sybylla, it is foolish to talk like that, for you know that you  take no interest in your work. If you'd turn to and help me rear poultry  and make dresses--and why don't you take to cooking?\"    \"Take to cooking!\" I retorted with scorn. \"The fire that a fellow has to  endure on that old oven would kill a horse, and the grit and dirt of  clearing it up grinds on my very nerves. Besides, if I ever do want to  do any extra fancy cooking, we either can't afford the butter or the  currants, or else the eggs are too scarce! Cook, be grannied!\"    \"Sybylla! Sybylla, you are getting very vulgar!\"    \"Yes, I once was foolish enough to try and be polite, but I've given it  up. My style of talk is quite good enough for my company. What on earth  does it matter whether I'm vulgar or not. I can feed calves and milk and  grind out my days here just as well vulgar as unvulgar,\" I answered  savagely.    \"There, you see you are always discontented about your home. It's no  use; the only thing is for you to earn your own living.\"    \"I will earn my own living.\"    \"What will you do? Will you be examined for a pupil-teacher? That is a  very nice occupation for girls.\"    \"What chance would I have in a competitive exam. against Goulburn girls?  They all have good teachers and give up their time to study. I only have  old Harris, and he is the most idiotic old animal alive; besides, I  loathe the very thought of teaching. I'd as soon go on the wallaby.\"    \"You are not old enough to be a general servant or a cook; you have not  experience enough to be a housemaid; you don't take to sewing, and there  is no chance of being accepted as a hospital"]]]
