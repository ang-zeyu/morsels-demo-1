BY ROBERT SOUTHEY.        Divided far by death were they, whose names,    In honour here united, as in birth,    This monumental verse records. They drew    In Dorset's healthy vales their natal breath,    And from these shores beheld the ocean first,    Whereon, in early youth, with one accord    They chose their way of fortune; to that course    By Hood and Bridport's bright example drawn,    Their kinsmen, children of this place, and sons    Of one, who in his faithful ministry    Inculcated, within these hallowed walls,    The truths, in mercy to mankind revealed.    Worthy were these three brethren each to add    New honours to the already honour'd name;    But Arthur, in the morning of his day,    Perished amid the Caribbean sea,    When the Pomona, by a hurricane    Whirl'd, riven and overwhelmed, with all her crew    Into the deep went down. A longer date    To Alexander was assign'd, for hope    For fair ambition, and for fond regret,    Alas, how short! for duty, for desert,    Sufficing; and, while Time preserves the roll    Of Britain's naval feats, for good report.    A boy, with Cook he rounded the great globe;    A youth, in many a celebrated fight    With Rodney had his part; and having reach'd    Life's middle stage, engaging ship to ship,    When the French Hercules, a gallant foe,    Struck to the British Mars his three-striped flag,    He fell, in the moment of his victory.    Here his remains in sure and certain hope    Are laid, until the hour when earth and sea    Shall render up their dead. One brother yet    Survived, with Keppel and with Rodney train'd    In battles, with the Lord of Nile approved,    Ere in command he worthily upheld    Old England's high prerogative. In the east,    The west, the Baltic, and the midland seas,    Yea, wheresoever hostile fleets have plough'd    The ensanguined deep, his thunders have been heard,    His flag in brave defiance hath been seen,    And bravest enemies at Sir Samuel's name    Felt fatal presage in their inmost heart,    Of unavertable defeat foredoom'd.    Thus in the path of glory he rode on,    Victorious alway, adding praise to praise;    Till full of honours, not of years, beneath    The venom of the infected clime he sunk,    On Coromandel's coast, completing there    His service, only when his life was spent.      To the three brethren, Alexander's son    (Sole scion he in whom their line survived,)    With English feeling, and the deeper sense    Of filial duty, consecrates this tomb.           *       *       *       *       *      LOVE.    A BALLAD, BY THE ETTRICK SHEPHERD.        O, Love's a bitter thing to bide,      The lad that drees it's to be pitied;    It blinds to a' the warld beside,      And makes a body dilde and ditied;    It lies sae sair at my breast bane,      My heart is melting saft an' safter;    To dee outright I wad be fain,      Wer't no for fear what may be after.      I dinna ken what course to steer,      I'm sae to dool an' daftness driven,    For are so lovely, sweet, and dear,      Sure never breath'd the breeze o' heaven;    O there's a soul beams in her ee,      Ae blink o't maks are's spirit gladder,    And ay the mair she geeks at me,      It pits me aye in love the madder.      Love winna heal, it winna thole,      You canna shun't even when you fear it;    An' O, this sickness o' the soul,      'Tis past the power of man to bear it!    And yet to mak o' her a wife,      I couldna square it wi' my duty,    I'd like to see her a' her life      Remain a virgin in her beauty;      As pure as bonny as she's now,      The walks of human life adorning;    As blithe as bird upon the bough,      As sweet as breeze of summer morning.    Love paints the earth, it paints the sky,      An' tints each lovely hue of Nature,    And makes to the enchanted eye      An angel of a mortal creature.    _Blackwood's Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *          Spirit of Discovery.           *       *       *       *       *    _Regent's Park_.    It is much to be regretted that those who first designed the plantations  of the Regent's Park seem to have had little or no taste for, or  knowledge of, hardy trees and shrubs; otherwise, this park might have  been the first arboretum in the world. Instead of the (about) 50 sorts  of trees and shrubs which it now exhibits, there might have been all the  3,000 sorts, now so admirably displaying their buds and leaves, and some  of them their flowers, in the arboretum of Messrs. Loddiges at Hackney.  A walk round that arboretum, at this season, is one of the greatest  treats which a botanist can enjoy, and a drive round the Regent's Park  might have been just as interesting. It is not yet too late to supply  this defect, and the expense to government would be a mere bagatelle.  The Zoological Society in the mean time, might receive contributions  of herbaceous plants, and be at the expense of planting and naming  them.--_London's Mag_.      _Zoological Society_.    A catalogue of the members has been published, which includes 1,291  names, besides corresponding members. The museum in Bruton Street has  received, and is daily receiving, valuable additions, as is the garden  in the Regent's Park. The extent of this garden has been, in consequence  of the various donations and purchases, considerably increased, and  several neat and appropriate structures are now erecting for the abode  of different specimens. It is a gratifying circumstance that these  specimens are, for the most part, clearly and distinctly named, with  the native country of the animal added. We could wish to see a greater  variety of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants introduced, and equally  clear names and geographical indications placed at them also. Why  should it not, as far as practicable, be a botanic garden as well  as a zoological garden?--_Ibid_.      _Galvanism_.    Mr. Becquerel has discovered that the temperature of a conducting wire  communicating with the two poles of a pile, increases from each of its  extremities, and constantly reaches its maximum in the middle of the  wire.--_Brewster's Journal._      _Alloyed Iron Plate_.    A manufacture of prepared iron has been practised, and the substance  produced used to a considerable degree in Paris. This has been to  prepare iron in large plates, and other forms, so that it will not rust.  This has been effected by coating it with an alloy of tin and much lead,  so as to form an imitation of tin plate. Trials have been made, and  proved favourable; it resists the action of certain fluids that would  rapidly corrode iron alone; it can be prepared of any size, and at a  low price. Its use in the manufacture of sugarpans and boilers, in the  construction of roofs and gutters, is expected to be very considerable.  --_Bull. d'Encouragement._      _Saline Lake of Loonar in Berar._    This curious lake is contained in a sort of cauldron of rocks amidst  a pleasing landscape, and is of course the object of superstition.

Mr. Alexander, who describes  it, found by a rough analysis that 100 parts contain      Muriate of Soda      20 parts,    Muriate of Lime      10 parts,    Muriate of Magnesia   6 parts,      The principal purpose to which the sediment of the water is applied is  cleansing the shawls of Cachmere.

He had  preached in Florence eight years earlier, but on that occasion he  passed unnoticed through the crowd. Now he took the whole city by  storm. Obeying the magic of his eloquence and the magnetism of his  personality, her citizens accepted this Dominican friar as their  political leader and moral reformer, when events brought about the  expulsion of the Medici in 1494. Michelangelo was one of his constant  listeners at S. Marco and in the Duomo. He witnessed those stormy  scenes of religious revival and passionate fanaticism which  contemporaries have impressively described. The shorthand-writer to  whom we owe the text of Savonarola's sermons at times breaks off with  words like these: \"Here I was so overcome with weeping that I could  not go on.\" Pico della Mirandola tells that the mere sound of the  monk's voice, startling the stillness of the Duomo, thronged through  all its space with people, was like a clap of doom; a cold shiver ran  through the marrow of his bones the hairs of his head stood on end  while he listened. Another witness reports: \"Those sermons caused such  terror, alarm, sobbing, and tears, that every one passed through the  streets without speaking, more dead than alive.\"    One of the earliest extant letters of Michelangelo, written from Rome  in 1497 to his brother Buonarroto, reveals a vivid interest in  Savonarola. He relates the evil rumours spread about the city  regarding his heretical opinions, and alludes to the hostility of Fra  Mariano da Genezzano; adding this ironical sentence: \"Therefore he  ought by all means to come and prophesy a little in Rome, when  afterwards he will be canonised; and so let all his party be of good  cheer.\" In later years, it is said that the great sculptor read and  meditated Savonarola's writings together with the Bible. The  apocalyptic thunderings and voices of the Sistine Chapel owe much of  their soul-thrilling impressiveness to those studies. Michelet says,  not without justice, that the spirit of Savonarola lives again in the  frescoes of that vault.    On the 8th of April 1492, Michelangelo lost his friend and patron.  Lorenzo died in his villa at Careggi, aged little more than forty-four  years. Guicciardini implies that his health and strength had been  prematurely broken by sensual indulgences. About the circumstances of  his last hours there are some doubts and difficulties; but it seems  clear that he expired as a Christian, after a final interview with  Savonarola. His death cast a gloom over Italy. Princes and people were  growing uneasy with the presentiment of impending disaster; and now  the only man who by his diplomatical sagacity could maintain the  balance of power had been taken from them. To his friends and  dependants in Florence the loss appeared irreparable. Poliziano poured  forth his sorrow in a Latin threnody of touching and simple beauty.  Two years later both he and Pico della Mirandola followed their master  to the grave. Marsilio Ficino passed away in 1499; and a friend of his  asserted that the sage's ghost appeared to him. The atmosphere was  full of rumours, portents, strange premonitions of revolution and  doom. The true golden age of the Italian Renaissance may almost be  said to have ended with Lorenzo de' Medici's life.        CHAPTER II      I    After the death of Lorenzo de' Medici, Michelangelo returned to his  father's home, and began to work upon a statue of Hercules, which is  now lost. It used to stand in the Strozzi Palace until the siege of  Florence in 1530, when Giovanni Battista della Palla bought it from  the steward of Filippo Strozzi, and sent it into France as a present  to the king.    The Magnificent left seven children by his wife Clarice, of the  princely Roman house of the Orsini. The eldest, Piero, was married to  Alfonsina, of the same illustrious family. Giovanni, the second, had  already received a cardinal's hat from his kinsman, Innocent VIII.  Guiliano, the third, was destined to play a considerable part in  Florentine history under the title of Duke of Nemours. One daughter  was married to a Salviati, another to a Ridolfi, a third to the Pope's  son, Franceschetto Cybo. The fourth, Luisa, had been betrothed to her  distant cousin, Giovanni de' Medici; but the match was broken off, and  she remained unmarried.    Piero now occupied that position of eminence and semi-despotic  authority in Florence which his father and grandfather had held; but  he was made of different stuff, both mentally and physically. The  Orsini blood, which he inherited from his mother, mixed but ill in his  veins with that of Florentine citizens and bankers. Following the  proud and insolent traditions of his maternal ancestors, he began to  discard the mask of civil urbanity with which Cosimo and Lorenzo had  concealed their despotism. He treated the republic as though it were  his own property, and prepared for the coming disasters of his race by  the overbearing arrogance of his behaviour. Physically, he was  powerful, tall, and active; fond of field-sports, and one of the best  pallone-players of his time in Italy. Though he had been a pupil of  Poliziano, he displayed but little of his father's interest in  learning, art, and literature. Chance brought Michelangelo into  personal relations with this man. On the 20th of January 1494 there  was a heavy fall of snow in Florence, and Piero sent for the young  sculptor to model a colossal snow-man in the courtyard of his palace.  Critics have treated this as an insult to the great artist, and a sign  of Piero's want of taste; but nothing was more natural than that a  previous inmate of the Medicean household should use his talents for  the recreation of the family who lived there. Piero upon this occasion  begged Michelangelo to return and occupy the room he used to call his  own during Lorenzo's lifetime. \"And so,\" writes Condivi, \"he remained  for some months with the Medici, and was treated by Piero with great  kindness; for the latter used to extol two men of his household as  persons of rare ability, the one being Michelangelo, the other a  Spanish groom, who, in addition to his personal beauty, which was  something wonderful, had so good a wind and such agility that when  Piero was galloping on horseback he could not outstrip him by a  hand's-breadth.\"        II    At this period of his life Michelangelo devoted himself to anatomy. He  had a friend, the Prior of S. Spirito, for whom he carved a wooden  crucifix of nearly life-size. This liberal-minded churchman put a room  at his disposal, and allowed him to dissect dead bodies. Condivi tells  us that the practice of anatomy was a passion with his master. \"His  prolonged habits of dissection injured his stomach to such an extent  that he lost the power of eating or drinking to any profit. It is  true, however, that he became so learned in this branch of knowledge  that he has often entertained the idea of composing a work for  sculptors and painters, which should treat exhaustively of all the  movements of the human body, the external aspect of the limbs, the  bones, and so forth, adding an ingenious discourse upon the truths  discovered by him through the investigations of many years. He would  have done this if he had not mistrusted his own power of treating such  a subject with the dignity and style of a practised rhetorician. I  know well that when he reads Albert Duerer's book, it seems to him of  no great value; his own conception being so far fuller and more  useful. Truth to tell, Duerer only treats of the measurements and  varied aspects of the human form, making his figures straight as  stakes; and, what is more important, he says nothing about the  attitudes and gestures of the body. Inasmuch as Michelangelo is now  advanced in years, and does not count on bringing his ideas to light  through composition, he has disclosed to me his theories in their  minutest details. He also began to discourse upon the same topic with  Messer Realdo Colombo, an anatomist and surgeon of the highest  eminence. For the furtherance of such studies this good friend of ours  sent him the corpse of a Moor, a young man of incomparable beauty, and  admirably adapted for our purpose. It was placed at S. Agata, where I  dwelt and still dwell, as being a quarter removed from public  observation.    \"On this corpse Michelangelo demonstrated to me many rare and abstruse  things, which perhaps have never yet been fully understood, and all of  which I noted down, hoping one day, by the help of some learned man,  to give them to the public. Of Michelangelo's studies in anatomy we  have one grim but interesting record in a pen-drawing by his hand at  Oxford. A corpse is stretched upon a plank and trestles. Two men are  bending over it with knives in their hands; and, for light to guide  them in their labours, a candle is stuck into the belly of the  subject.\"    As it is not my intention to write the political history of  Michelangelo's period, I need not digress here upon the invasion of  Italy by Charles VIII., which caused the expulsion of the Medici from  Florence, and the establishment of a liberal government under the  leadership of Savonarola. Michelangelo appears to have anticipated the  catastrophe which was about to overwhelm his patron. He was by nature  timid, suspicious, and apt to foresee disaster. Possibly he may have  judged that the haughty citizens of Florence would not long put up  with Piero's aristocratical insolence. But Condivi tells a story on  the subject which is too curious to be omitted, and which he probably  set down from Michelangelo's own lips. \"In the palace of Piero a man  called Cardiere was a frequent inmate. The Magnificent took much  pleasure in his society, because he improvised verses to the guitar  with marvellous dexterity, and the Medici also practised this art; so  that nearly every evening after supper there was music.
