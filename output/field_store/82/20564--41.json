Even the camera  purchased for the Staff Photographer was a  top-of-the-line German Leica, complete with an array of  lenses and filters, worth a lakh of rupees of 1978.  Krishna Kurwar managed the plant, under the  GM-cum-Publisher, Madkaikar. The result was a  refreshing, never-before-seen product on the landscape  of Goa's print media.    To match, a high-profile editorial team was put  together under the stewardship of Konkani-speaking M.G. Bailur   and his Associate, Tulu-speaking Y.M. Hegde, both  originally from South Canara. The backbone of the  newspages, the News Editor, was P.R. Menon, the old and  revered FPJ warhorse. The complement of three Chief  Subs and about a dozen Subs was picked from various  national dailies -- Goa could come up with only two  pairs of hands on the news desk. Being unfamiliar with  local affairs, this cast added onus on Kaka Singbal and  me to mark the priority of our dispatches in the  initial days!    The news-gathering team headed by Kaka (assisted by  Dharmanand Kamat in Panjim and Karamchand Furtado on  the TP link) was, of course, entirely home-bred. I  rushed college-mate Leslie St. Anne thro' a crash  course in typing to join me in Margao. In South Goa, we  had Radharao Gracias and Joey Rodrigues (both law  students then), Felicio Esteves (who went on to become  a Ministerial P.A. and co-author of the infamous Marks Scandal   subsequently scooped by me for the FPJ), John Carlos Aguiar   in Ponda, Vallabh Dessai in Quepem, Minguel Mascarenhas   in Sanguem, Kelly Furtado in Vasco, and half a dozen stringers   across South Goa. Manikrao (brother of the  award-winning ToI photographer, Prabhakar M. Shirodkar)  was our lensman, assisted by Lloyd Coutinho in Margao  and Lui Godinho in Vasco, excellent photographers all,  who provided the memorable photo inputs that shot the WCT   to instant fame.    WCT hit the newsstands in early-July 1978. We raced. In Margao,  I concentrated on at least one off-beat,  human-interest, interview-based or photo-story per day,  carried usually boxed or in anchor position. Aware of  our printing process strengths, I never lost an  opportunity to get Manik shoot a good pic, including  one that had to be clicked from a bubbling canoe in  choppy waters off a rocky beach in Betul, South Goa.  [This one was of a rotting human male corpse --  sprawling, shocking and white on the dark rocks - which  the cops had neglected to recover despite the local  Sarpanch's days-long complaints. P.R. Menon splashed  the pic in the lead-story position. I had to take  Papa's reprimand the following morning -- it seems the  Lt. Governor was taken so aback picking the morning's  WCT that his P.A. personally called Papa to complain  about bad taste. But I still considered the  two-and-half Rupees paid to the canoe man for the ride  a fine expense!]    Consciously, though, we shunned sensationalizing and Kaka   firmly shot the idea of carrying the day's matka  figures. We refrained from gimmicks like carrying dummy  advertisements, especially in the Classified columns,  barometer to a newspaper's popularity.    Instead, we went for innovative editorial content.  [Including, at my instance, a SundayMag column on  Sleight of Hand by the Salcete magician, Marco. When  Marco didn't show up for a couple of weeks, leading to  howls from eager readers of his column, Y.M. Hegde was  so furious that I had to fill in with a piece on how  Marco had performed the Vanishing Trick and restore  YM's trademark smile!]    To further notch up circulation, I almost coerced Madkaikar   into breaking the back of monopoly newspaper  distributors in South Goa -- by selling retail bundles  to any willing vendor on an initial sell-or-return basis.    Results were evident. By month 6, we sold around 4,500  copies in and around Margao alone, compared to less  than half that number by NT. Circulation problems,  however, persisted in North Goa, including delayed  deliveries to news stalls in the northern talukas. But  then, we had just two vehicles to cover the entire  territory. (\"Penny wise, Pound foolish,\" P.R. Menon  forever rued, he never carried much of an impression  about the managerial abilities of Goan mineowners --  all his life, after all, Menon had worked in a  establishment owned by the Karnanis, Marwaris to the  core!) Even then, overall, WCT's print order would be  just about 2,000 copies short of the NT. And at the  rate we were going, the gap would fast be closed and surpassed?    My heroes, of course, were Shivram Borkar and Babal Borkar,  ace drivers who by day ferried the shift editorial  staff to and from quarters in Margao to office in Davorlim  . By night, the duo snoozed whatever time available, on  heaps of 'raddi' in the press. And zipped their way  with newspaper bundles to either end of Goa before the  crack of dawn -- in terribly overloaded, ramshackle,  dieselized Ambassador cars that should have been a  delight to Mario Miranda and Alexyz (we used a  syndicated pocket cartoon, incidentally, since Mario  was with the ToI group in Mumbai and Alexyz hadn't yet  surfaced as a cartoonist.) Babal and Shivram, true  heroes who virtually were at call, round the clock,  round the year. [They of course made out-of-pocket  money, ferrying passengers on the return. When this  reached Papa's ears, he tailed one of the drivers one  fine morning. When the unsuspecting fellow stopped to  take in passengers, Papa is reported to have pulled  alongside and advised the driver, \"Bhara, bhara, taxi  ti!\" The man was often magnanimous. The driver did not  lose his job.]    By the first year of publication, despite impressive  circulation figures, there were no signs of advertising  revenue picking up to reach the financial break-even  point. To the sheer dismay of our well-knit editorial  team, there were also no signs of implementation of the  pan-Konkan Plan. The management, instead, began  fighting shy to inject fresh investment in the  enterprise. Corners started getting cut. Virgin plates  came to used only for jacket pages, inside pages were  processed on recycled plates. Papa's dream began to  show signs of fatigue?    By the third month into the second year of publication,  amid this uncertain scenario, arrived Nicholas  (\"Nicky\") Rebello, a lino-typesetter and leader of the  NT worker's union. I will not hedge a bet if Nicky was  'inspired' by his employers, but having been in touch  with him much after his retirement from NT at his home  in Betim, I can vouchsafe Nicky didn't travel to Davorlim   by any 'political' inspiration. My best guess is that  some restive workers of the WCT press, aware of wages  being paid at NT, must have approached and invited  Nicky to Davorlim. The workers of WCT press got  unionized and Nicky soon served a Charter of Demands.  The management stood its ground, often unreasonably in  the opinion of the editorial team - which of course had  no locus standi in the imbroglio. As the strike showed  signs of protraction, P.R. Menon, known for leftist  leanings from his fiery days at the FPJ, tried to  intervene with the management. To no avail.    (P.R. Menon was forever of the conviction that  managerial skills of Goan mine-owners were limited to  blasting, transportation and shipping -- and after the  importer's cheque arrived, to distributing the proceeds  to those who had blasted, transported and shipped. And,  of course, to profits!) Papa, strangely, sometimes used  queer management methods. There was this Chief  Accountant, hired for the PTI group, on a then princely  salary of Rs.4,000 a month. To get a feedback on the  Chief Accountant, Papa assigned a peon drawing no more  than Rs.250 a month. After office hours, the peon would  report to Papa on the activities of the C.A. from  which, inferences on the Chief Accountant were drawn!    But a man of immense experience and intuition he was.  From the streets of native Assolna in Salcete, where as  a child he hawked textiles, a wooden yard measure slung  across his shoulder and a coolie with a headload of  wares in tow, Papa must have surely post-graduated from  the University of Experience. On occasions when I was  seated in his chamber, his P.A., Sambari would buzz to  announce a visitor. In a flash Papa knew why the man  had come, what he would say, and had the replies even  before the visitor entered! I personally saw flaming  creditors leave his chamber smiling, even though not a  paisa had yielded! He had that rare ability to disarm  even the most irate visitor. But when it came to the  WCT strike, I have always held the belief that a man of  such calibre who could have easily placated the  agitated workers and even broken their Union, was  somehow carried away with the opinion of one trusted  man, who was obviously misleading him -- and since I've  named names, I will exclude Madkaikar and Kurwar.]    With no end to the strike in sight, Bailur, Hegde, Kaka  and me next met and virtually pleaded with Papa to  concede some sops to the striking workmen and get the  publication going. I think the establishment (may not  have been Papa) thereafter regarded as being pro-Union!    The editorial team, bulk of which was from outstation,  met frequently during those bekaar days and finally,  the painful decision emerged that we tell the  management to either settle the dispute with the Union  or we quit en masse. The management was unmoved. We  quit, but Papa's dispenser of bad advice insisted on  serving 'dismissal' letters!    And thus a lofty dream to publish from Goa, the land of  Banna Halli, an English daily serving the entire of  Lord Parashuram's Konkan on the West Coast of India,  went phut. A modern press and process, an excellent  editorial team -- path-breaking infrastructure in Goa's  history of newspaper production -- lay in waste.    The venerable Bailur returned to retirement, as did  P.R. Menon. Y.M.

Yet, to speak sooth, I think to rival thee.      Now look, this road holds holiday to-day:      For banded brethren solemnise a feast      To richly-dight Demeter, thanking her      For her good gifts: since with no grudging hand      Hath the boon goddess filled the wheaten floors.      So come: the way, the day, is thine as mine:      Try we our woodcraft--each may learn from each.      I am, as thou, a clarion-voice of song;      All hail me chief of minstrels. But I am not,      Heaven knows, o'ercredulous: no, I scarce can yet      (I think) outvie Philetas, nor the bard      Of Samos, champion of Sicilian song.      They are as cicadas challenged by a frog.\"          I spake to gain mine ends; and laughing light      He said: \"Accept this club, as thou'rt indeed      A born truth-teller, shaped by heaven's own hand!      I hate your builders who would rear a house      High as Oromedon's mountain-pinnacle:      I hate your song-birds too, whose cuckoo-cry      Struggles (in vain) to match the Chian bard.      But come, we'll sing forthwith, Simichidas,      Our woodland music: and for my part I--      List, comrade, if you like the simple air      I forged among the uplands yesterday.        [_Sings_] Safe be my true-love convoyed o'er the main      To Mitylene--though the southern blast      Chase the lithe waves, while westward slant the Kids,      Or low above the verge Orion stand--      If from Love's furnace she will rescue me,      For Lycidas is parched with hot desire.      Let halcyons lay the sea-waves and the winds,      Northwind and Westwind, that in shores far-off      Flutters the seaweed--halcyons, of all birds      Whose prey is on the waters, held most dear      By the green Nereids: yea let all things smile      On her to Mitylene voyaging,      And in fair harbour may she ride at last.      I on that day, a chaplet woven of dill      Or rose or simple violet on my brow,      Will draw the wine of Pteleas from the cask      Stretched by the ingle. They shall roast me beans,      And elbow-deep in thyme and asphodel      And quaintly-curling parsley shall be piled      My bed of rushes, where in royal ease      I sit and, thinking of my darling, drain      With stedfast lip the liquor to the dregs.      I'll have a pair of pipers, shepherds both,      This from Acharnae, from Lycope that;      And Tityrus shall be near me and shall sing      How the swain Daphnis loved the stranger-maid;      And how he ranged the fells, and how the oaks      (Such oaks as Himera's banks are green withal)      Sang dirges o'er him waning fast away      Like snow on Athos, or on Haemus high,      Or Rhodope, or utmost Caucasus.      And he shall sing me how the big chest held      (All through the maniac malice of his lord)      A living goatherd: how the round-faced bees,      Lured from their meadow by the cedar-smell,      Fed him with daintiest flowers, because the Muse      Had made his throat a well-spring of sweet song.      Happy Cometas, this sweet lot was thine!      Thee the chest prisoned, for thee the honey-bees      Toiled, as thou slavedst out the mellowing year:      And oh hadst thou been numbered with the quick      In my day! I had led thy pretty goats      About the hill-side, listening to thy voice:      While thou hadst lain thee down 'neath oak or pine,      Divine Cometas, warbling pleasantly.\"          He spake and paused; and thereupon spake I.      \"I too, friend Lycid, as I ranged the fells,      Have learned much lore and pleasant from the Nymphs,      Whose fame mayhap hath reached the throne of Zeus.      But this wherewith I'll grace thee ranks the first:      Thou listen, since the Muses like thee well.        [_Sings_] On me the young Loves sneezed: for hapless I      Am fain of Myrto as the goats of Spring.      But my best friend Aratus inly pines      For one who loves him not. Aristis saw--      (A wondrous seer is he, whose lute and lay      Shrined Apollo's self would scarce disdain)--      How love had scorched Aratus to the bone.      O Pan, who hauntest Homole's fair champaign,      Bring the soft charmer, whosoe'er it be,      Unbid to his sweet arms--so, gracious Pan,      May ne'er thy ribs and shoulderblades be lashed      With squills by young Arcadians, whensoe'er      They are scant of supper! But should this my prayer      Mislike thee, then on nettles mayest thou sleep,      Dinted and sore all over from their claws!      Then mayest thou lodge amid Edonian hills      By Hebrus, in midwinter; there subsist,      The Bear thy neighbour: and, in summer, range      With the far AEthiops 'neath the Blemmyan rocks      Where Nile is no more seen! But O ye Loves,      Whose cheeks are like pink apples, quit your homes      By Hyetis, or Byblis' pleasant rill,      Or fair Dione's rocky pedestal,      And strike that fair one with your arrows, strike      The ill-starred damsel who disdains my friend.      And lo, what is she but an o'er-ripe pear?      The girls all cry 'Her bloom is on the wane.'      We'll watch, Aratus, at that porch no more,      Nor waste shoe-leather: let the morning cock      Crow to wake others up to numb despair!      Let Molon, and none else, that ordeal brave:      While we make ease our study, and secure      Some witch, to charm all evil from our door.\"          I ceased. He smiling sweetly as before,      Gave me the staff, 'the Muses' parting gift,'      And leftward sloped toward Pyxa. We the while,      Bent us to Phrasydeme's, Eucritus and I,      And baby-faced Amyntas: there we lay      Half-buried in a couch of fragrant reed      And fresh-cut vineleaves, who so glad as we?      A wealth of elm and poplar shook o'erhead;      Hard by, a sacred spring flowed gurgling on      From the Nymphs' grot, and in the sombre boughs      The sweet cicada chirped laboriously.      Hid in the thick thorn-bushes far away      The treefrog's note was heard; the crested lark      Sang with the goldfinch; turtles made their moan,      And o'er the fountain hung the gilded bee.      All of rich summer smacked, of autumn all:      Pears at our feet, and apples at our side      Rolled in luxuriance; branches on the ground      Sprawled, overweighed with damsons; while we brushed      From the cask's head the crust of four long years.      Say, ye who dwell upon Parnassian peaks,      Nymphs of Castalia, did old Chiron e'er      Set before Heracles a cup so brave      In Pholus' cavern--did as nectarous draughts      Cause that Anapian shepherd, in whose hand      Rocks were as pebbles, Polypheme the strong,      Featly to foot it o'er the cottage lawns:--      As, ladies, ye bid flow that day for us      All by Demeter's shrine at harvest-home?      Beside whose cornstacks may I oft again      Plant my broad fan: while she stands by and smiles,      Poppies and cornsheaves on each laden arm.          IDYLL VIII.      The Triumph of Daphnis.    _DAPHNIS. MENALCAS. A GOATHERD_.        Daphnis, the gentle herdsman, met once, as legend tells,      Menalcas making with his flock the circle of the fells.      Both chins were gilt with coming beards: both lads could sing and play:      Menalcas glanced at Daphnis, and thus was heard to say:--      \"Art thou for singing, Daphnis, lord of the lowing kine?      I say my songs are better, by what thou wilt, than thine.\"      Then in his turn spake Daphnis, and thus he made reply:      \"O shepherd of the fleecy flock, thou pipest clear and high;      But come what will, Menalcas, thou ne'er wilt sing as I.\"        MENALCAS.      This art thou fain to ascertain, and risk a bet with me?        DAPHNIS.      This I full fain would ascertain, and risk a bet with thee.        MENALCAS.      But what, for champions such as we, would, seem a fitting prize?        DAPHNIS.      I stake a calf: stake thou a lamb, its mother's self in size.        MENALCAS.      A lamb I'll venture never: for aye at close of day      Father and mother count the flock, and passing strict are they.        DAPHNIS.      Then what shall be the victor's fee? What wager wilt thou lay?        MENALCAS.      A pipe discoursing through nine mouths I made, full fair to view;      The wax is white thereon, the line of this and that edge true.      I'll risk it: risk my father's own is more than I dare do.        DAPHNIS.      A pipe discoursing through nine mouths, and fair, hath Daphnis too:      The wax is white thereon, the line of this and that edge true.      But yesterday I made it: this finger feels the pain      Still, where indeed the rifted reed hath cut it clean in twain.      But who shall be our umpire? who listen to our strain?        MENALCAS.      Suppose we hail yon goatherd; him at whose horned herd now      The dog is barking--yonder dog with white upon his brow.          Then out they called: the goatherd marked them, and up came he;      Then out they sang; the goatherd their umpire fain would be.      To shrill Menalcas' lot it fell to start the woodland lay:      Then Daphnis took it up. And thus Menalcas led the way.        MENALCAS.      \"Rivers and vales, a glorious birth! Oh if Menalcas e'er        Piped aught of pleasant music in your ears:      Then pasture, nothing loth, his lambs; and let young Daphnis fare        No worse, should he stray hither with his steers.\"        DAPHNIS.      \"Pastures and rills, a bounteous race! If Daphnis sang you e'er        Such songs as ne'er from nightingale have flowed;      Then to his herd your fatness lend; and let Menalcas share        Like boon, should e'er he wend along this road.\"        MENALCAS.      \"'Tis spring, 'tis greenness everywhere; with milk the udders teem,        And all things that are young have life anew,      Where my sweet maiden wanders: but parched and withered seem,        When she departeth, lawn and shepherd too.\"        DAPHNIS.      \"Fat "]]]
