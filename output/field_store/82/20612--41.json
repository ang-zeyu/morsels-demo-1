During her visits to Dieppe, the Duchess had acquired a  proficiency in swimming, and it has since frequently saved her in the  hour of need. Overpowered by fatigue and hunger, and chilled by the cold  of her dripping garments, this courageous woman felt that her physical  powers were no longer capable of obeying her wishes, and that further  exertion was impossible. Seeing a house at a distance, she declared her  intention of throwing herself on the generosity of its owner, when her  guide warned her of the danger of such a proceeding, as the owner of the  house was a Liberal, and violently opposed to her party. All his  representations were made in vain. She boldly entered the house, and,  addressing the master of it, exclaimed--\"You see before you the unhappy  mother of your king; proscribed and pursued, half dead with fatigue,  cold, wet, and hungry, you will not refuse her a morsel of your bread, a  corner at your fire, and a bed to rest her weary limbs on.\" The master  of the house threw himself at her feet, and, with tears streaming from  his eyes, declared that his house, and all that was his, were at her  service; and for some days, while the pursuit after her was the hottest,  she remained unsuspected in this asylum, the politics of the master  placing him out of suspicion; and when she left it, she was followed by  the tears and prayers of the whole of the family and their dependents.    This heroic woman, nurtured in courts, and accustomed to all the luxury  that such an exalted station as hers can give, has thought herself  fortunate, during many a night of the last year, when she could have the  shelter of the poorest hovel, with some brown bread and milk for food,  and has partaken, at the same humble board, the frugal repast of the  peasants who sheltered her. Her general attire has been the most common  dress, of a materiel called buse, made of worsted, and worn by the  poorest of the peasantry. A mantle of the same coarse stuff, with a  hood, completed her costume.    When one of the friends, who had seen her the pride and ornament of the  gilded saloons in the Tuileries, expressed his grief at the dreadful  hardships to which she was exposed, she pointed to a furze bush on the  heath where they were conversing, and said--\"I shall sleep on that spot  to-night; and many nights I have had no better shelter than were  afforded by a few wild shrubs or trees, and I never slept better at  Rosny. If my mantle was long enough to allow of its covering my feet  when I slept, I should have nothing to complain of, but then it might  impede my flight, so I must be content.\"           *       *       *       *       *          THE NATURALIST.           *       *       *       *       *      DEPTH OF THE SEA.      As to the bottom of the basin of the sea, it seems to have inequalities  similar to those which the surface of continents exhibits; if it were  dried up, it would present mountains, valleys, and plains. It is  inhabited almost throughout its whole extent by an immense quantity of  testaceous animals, or covered with sand and gravel. It was thus that  Donati found the bottom of the Adriatic sea; the bed of testaceous  animals there, according to him, is several hundred feet in thickness.  The celebrated diver Pescecola, whom the emperor Frederick II. employed  to descend the strait of Messina, saw there with horror, enormous polypi  attached to the rocks, the arms of which, being several yards long, were  more than sufficient to strangle a man. In a great many places, the  madrepores form a kind of petrified forest fixed at the bottom of the  sea, and frequently, too, this bottom plainly presents different layers  of rock and earth.    The granite rises up in sharp-pointed masses. Near Marseilles, marble is  dug up from a submarine quarry. There are also bituminous springs, and  even springs of fresh water, that spout up from the depths of the ocean;  and in the Gulf of Spezia, a great spout or fountain of fresh water is  seen to rise like a liquid hill. Similar springs furnish the inhabitants  of the town of Aradus with their ordinary beverage.    On the southern coast of Cuba, to the southwest of the port of Batabano,  in the bay of Xagua, at two or three miles from the land, springs of  fresh water gush up with such force in the midst of the salt, that small  boats cannot approach them with safety; the deeper you draw the water,  the fresher you find it. It has been observed, that in the neighbourhood  of steep coasts, the bottom of the sea also sinks down suddenly to a  considerable depth; whilst near a low coast, and one of gentle  declivity, it is only gradually that the sea deepens. There are some  places in the sea where no bottom has yet been found. But we must not  conclude that the sea is really bottomless; an idea, which, if not  absurd, is, at least, by no means conformable to the analogies of  natural science. The mountains of continents seem to correspond with  what are called the abysses of the sea; but now, the highest mountains  do not rise to 20,000 feet. It is true that they have wasted down and  lessened by the action of the elements; it may, therefore, be reasonably  concluded, that the sea is not beyond 30,000 feet in depth; but it is  impossible to find the bottom even at one-third of this depth, with our  little instruments. The greatest depth that has been tried to be  measured, is that found in the northern ocean by Lord Mulgrave; he  heaved a very heavy sounding lead, and gave out with it cable rope to  the length of 4,680 feet, without finding bottom.--_Blake's  Encyclopedia_.           *       *       *       *       *          NOTES OF A READER.           *       *       *       *       *      CHARACTER OF CROMWELL.    (_From the Buccaneer.--By Mrs. S.C. Hall_.)      There are two things that to a marvellous degree bring people under  subjection--moral and corporeal fear. The most dissolute are held in  restraint by the influence of moral worth, and there are few who would  engage in a quarrel if they were certain that defeat or death would be  the consequence. Cromwell obtained, and we may add, maintained his  ascendancy over the people of England, by his earnest and continually  directed efforts towards these two important ends. His court was a  rare example of irreproachable conduct, from which all debauchery  and immorality were banished; while such was his deep and intimate  though mysterious acquaintance with every occurrence throughout the  commonwealth, its subjects had the certainty of knowing that, sooner or  later, whatever crimes they committed would of a surety reach the ear  of the protector. His natural abilities must always have been of the  highest order, though in the early part of his career he discovered  none of those extraordinary talents that afterwards gained him so  much applause, and worked so upon the affections of the hearers  and standers-by. His mind may be compared to one of those valuable  manuscripts that had long been rolled up and kept hidden from vulgar  eyes, but which exhibits some new proof of wisdom at each unfolding. It  has been well said by a philosopher, whose equal the world has not known  since his day, \"that a place sheweth the man.\" Of a certainty Cromwell  had no sooner possessed the opportunity so to do, than he showed to the  whole world that he was destined to govern. \"Some men achieve greatness,  some men are born to greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon  them.\" With Cromwell greatness was achieved. He was the architect of  his own fortunes, owing little to what is called \"chance,\" less to  patronage, and still less to crime, if we except the one sad blot upon  the page of his own history, as connected with that of his country.  There appears in his character but a small portion of that which is  evil, blended with much that is undoubtedly good. Although his public  speeches were, for the most part, ambiguous--leaving others to pick out  his meaning--or more frequently still, having no meaning to pick out,  being words, words, words--strung of mouldy sentences, scriptural  phrases, foolish exclamations, and such-like: yet when necessary, he  showed that he could sufficiently command his style, delivering himself  with so much energy, pith, propriety, and strength of expression, that  it was commonly said of him under such circumstances, \"every word he  spoke was a thing.\" But the strongest indication of his vast abilities  was, the extraordinary tact with which he entered into, dissected, and  scrutinized the nature of human kind. No man ever dived into the manners  and minds of those around him with greater penetration, or more rapidly  discovered their natural talents and tempers. If he chanced to hear  of a person fit for his purpose, whether as a minister, a soldier, an  artisan, a preacher, or a spy, no matter how previously obscure, he sent  for him forthwith, and employed him in the way in which he could be made  most useful, and answer best the purpose of his employer. Upon this most  admirable system (a system in which, unhappily, he has had but few  imitators among modern statesmen,) depended in a great degree his  success. His devotion has been sneered at; but it has never been proved  to have been insincere. With how much more show of justice may we  consider it to have been founded upon a solid and upright basis, when we  recollect that his whole outward deportment spoke its truth! Those who  decry him as a fanatic, ought to bethink themselves that religion was  the chivalry of the age in which he lived. Had Cromwell been born a few  centuries earlier, he would have headed the crusades, with as much  bravery, and far better results than our noble-hearted, but wrong-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12545"],[0,"Traditions of the Tinguian: a Study in Philippine Folk-Lore (#6)"],[1,"many ceremonies it is necessary  to construct a small raft called _tal-talababong,_ or _talabong_,  to place offerings in it, and set it adrift on the stream, in order  that any spirits who have been prevented from attending the ceremony  may still secure their share. [59]    The festivals, the dances, the observances of the proprieties required  by good breeding or custom of to-day, follow closely those given in  the tales. The greatest divergence is in the offering of betel-nuts  and the telling of names, which occupies such an important place in  the narratives. The use of betel-nut for chewing is less common among  the Tinguian people than with most other Philippine tribes, a fact  which may be accounted for by their constant use of tobacco. However,  betel-nuts still occupy a most important place in the various  ceremonies, and many offerings intended for the spirits must be  accompanied with the prepared nut. In nearly every instance when  invitations were sent out, for a ceremony, the people of the tales  intrusted an oiled betel-nut covered with gold with this duty. This  has its counterpart to-day in the small gifts of gold which are  often carried to some friend, in another town, whose presence is  particularly desired. It seems not improbable that the golden colored  husks of the ripe betel-nuts may have suggested the substitution.    Magic was practiced extensively in \"the first time,\" but it is by  no means unknown to the people of the present day. They cannot now  bring a dead person to life, or create human beings out of bits of  betel-nut; but they can and do cause sickness and death to their foes  by performing certain rites or directing actions against garments or  other objects recently in their possession. Even the name of an enemy  can be applied to an animal or inanimate object and action against  it be transferred to the owner.    Like the Tinguian, the people of Kadalayapan and Kaodanan are warned  or encouraged by omens received through the medium of birds, thunder,  lightning, or the condition of the gall and liver of a slaughtered pig;  [60] and like them they suffer for failure to heed these warnings,  or for the infraction of a taboo.    The myths of the first division make it plain that, to the people of  those times, the sun, moon, and stars were animate--either spirits or  human beings. In some cases a similar conception was held for thunder  and lightning, while in others they appear as animals. It will appear  that such ideas are not foreign to the second division of the tales,  which represent present day beliefs. Thus, in the mountain village  of Baay the sky is considered as a male spirit--the husband of the  earth, and father of sun and moon. Again, in Lagangilang and Abang,  the thunderbolt is identified as Kadaklan--the most powerful of all  spirits--who \"often eats the ground and releases his wife Agemem.\"    This brings us to a most interesting question, namely: Are the chief  actors in our tales to be considered as celestial beings and spirits,  or as human heroes? We have already made note of the fact that in the  first tale Aponitolau is identified with Ini-init whom, we are told,  was \"the sun,\" \"the man who makes the sun,\" \"a round stone which  rolls.\" In this tale he marries Aponibolinayen, a maiden whose name  may possibly be construed to mean \"the woman in the moon.\" [61]  However, we find Aponitolau abandoning his place in the sky and  going to reside in Kadalayapan. This tale comes from the town of  Langangilang where, as we have already seen, the celestial beings  are regarded as spirits. Tale fifteen, coming from the same town,  shows us this same Aponitolau going up to the sky, where he marries  the spirit Kabkabaga-an, but as before he returns to his home below. A  further indication of his celestial character is perhaps afforded us  in tale fourteen, which was recorded in Patok, a valley town in which  the sun, moon, and stars are now regarded as \"lights\" belonging to  the spirit Kadaklan. Here we find that Aponitolau marries the star  maid Gaygayoma, who is the daughter of the big star Bagbagak, and  Sinag--the moon. In this same tale Aponibolinayen appears as the  first wife of Aponitolau, and it is clear that in the mind of the  story teller she is not identified with Sinag. Aponitolau appears in  the other tales without any hint of celestial qualities. Aside from  her name and the fact that she is once pictured as visiting the sky,  there is nothing to indicate that his wife Aponibolinayen is to be  considered as the moon. A careful study of the other characters who  reside in Kadalayapan and Kaodanan fails to yield any evidence that  they are considered as celestial beings.    During the _Sayang_ ceremony held in San Juan, a certain man and  woman, who are then called Iwaginan and Gimbagon [62], represent the  good spirits and are defended by the people when evil spirits try to  dispossess them of their property. This is the only instance I have  observed in which the names of any of these characters of the tales  appear in the ceremonies, while a list of more than one hundred and  fifty spirits known to the Tinguian fails to reveal more.    While in the practice of magic, and in their communication with nature,  celestial bodies, and spirits, these \"people of the first times\"  far excelled the present Tinguian, they had a material culture and  ceremonial life much like that still found in Abra.    It seems then that these people, about whom the stories cluster, are  not to be identified as celestial beings or spirits [63]. They appear  rather as generalized heroes whose life and deeds represent that of  an earlier period, magnified and extolled by succeeding generations.      Ritualistic and Explanatory Myths    The second division of the tales now assumes a position of importance  to us, for in it we find present day ideas and beliefs of the people  strongly brought out, and are thus in a position to contrast them  with the tenets of the people in \"the first times\".    The influence of custom is exceedingly strong among the Tinguian of  to-day. The fact that the ancestors did so and so is sufficient  justification for performing any act for which they have no  definite explanation. Nowhere is this influence greater than in the  ceremonies. These, which accompany all the important happenings in  their daily life, are conducted by mediums who are fitted for office  by long training, and each one of whom is a check on the others if  they wilfully or through carelessness deviate from the old forms. The  ritual of these ceremonies is very complex and the reason for doing  many acts now seems to be entirely lost, yet the one explanation  _\"kadauyan\"_--custom--is sufficient to satisfy any Tinguian. Other  acts, as well as the possession of certain things, are explained  by myths, such as we are considering. It seems certain that we are  here dealing not with present day beliefs alone, but with at least  relatively old customs and tales, which while enabling us to understand  present day conceptions also give us a glimpse into the past.    The myths 32-40, which are known to the people as _diams_, are now  inseparable parts of the various ceremonies. Thus, when a pig is to be  offered in the _Sayang_ ceremony, the medium sits down beside it and  strokes it with oiled fingers while she \"talks to the spirits\". The  translation of her \"talk\" shows that this is in no sense a prayer  but is rather an account of how the greatest of the spirits taught  the Tinguian people to perform this ceremony correctly. Likewise,  when she offers food in the _Dawak_ [64] ceremony, she relates how  the spirit Kaboniyan taught the Tinguian to do this in the same  manner that he performs it. In the _Pala-an [65] diam_ she relates,  in story form, the cause of the sickness, but in this case ends with  a direct invocation to the spirits in Dadaya to \"make them well again  if you please\". The balance of the _diams_, 35-40, are in story form,  and seem intended more as an explanation to the people as to the causes  of their troubles than to be directed toward the spirits. However, the  medium seldom has an audience, and rarely ever a single listener, as  she recites the _diams_ she has learned verbatim from her instructors  when preparing for the duties of her office.    Myths 41-54 are of quite a different type. They are generally told  by the mediums or wise old people, during the ceremonies, but always  to a crowd of eager listeners. They are not learned word for word,  as are the _diams_, but their content is constant and they are  thoroughly believed.    That they exert a great influence on the beliefs and conduct of  both old and young is undoubted. The evil which befalls a person who  molests the guardian stones is thus made known even to the children who  generally keep at a distance from the grove in which they stand. Again,  these tales give sharp warning as to what befalls a person who even  ignorantly breaks the taboos following a death; but at the same time  advance means of thwarting the wrath of the enraged or evil spirits.    Myths 55 to 62 at first glance to not appear to be explanatory  at all, but seem rather to be a series of stories dealing with the  relations between certain persons and the natural spirits or those of  the dead. However, it is the intent and use rather than the form of  these stories which has caused them to be included in this division,  for they give the people authority for certain beliefs and conceptions  which they hold. Tale 56 gives us a glimpse of the prevalent idea  of the abode of the dead, where the spirits lead much the same sort  of life as they did while alive, but we secure quite a different  picture of this realm from the Baluga [66] tale, in which the home  of the deceased is said to be in the ground while the \"life\" of the  dead woman is kept in a bamboo cup. This last account was heard in  Manabo, a town near to the"]]]
