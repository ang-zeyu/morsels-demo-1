A hash may be  made of any kind of meat that has been cooked, but it is not so good,  and it is necessary to have a gravy prepared and seasoned, and keep the  hash over the fire only a few minutes to make it hot.           *       *       *       *       *    BEEF STEAK PIE.    Cut nice steaks, and stew them till half done, put a puff paste in the  dish, lay in the steaks with a few slices of boiled ham, season the  gravy very high, pour it in the dish, put on a lid of paste and bake it.           *       *       *       *       *    BEEF A-LA-DAUBE.    Get a round of beef, lard it well, and put it in a Dutch oven; cut the  meat from a shin of beef, or any coarse piece in thin slices, put round  the sides and over the top some slices of bacon, salt, pepper, onion,  thyme, parsley, cellery tops, or seed pounded, and some carrots cut  small, strew the pieces of beef over, cover it with water, let it stew  very gently till perfectly done, take out the round, strain the gravy,  let it stand to be cold, take off the grease carefully, beat the whites  of four eggs, mix a little water with them, put them to the gravy, let  it boil till it looks clear, strain it, and when cold, put it over the  beef.           *       *       *       *       *      VEAL.      DIRECTIONS FOR THE PIECES IN THE DIFFERENT QUARTERS OF VEAL.    A loin of veal must always be roasted: the fillet or leg may be dressed  in various ways, the knuckle or knee is proper for soup or for boiling;  these are the pieces that compose the hind quarter. In the fore quarter,  the breast and rack admit variety in cooking; the shoulder and neck are  only fit for soup.           *       *       *       *       *    VEAL CUTLETS FROM THE FILLET OR LEG.    Cut off the flank and take the bone out, then take slices the size of  the fillet and half an inch thick, beat two yelks of eggs light, and  have some grated bread mixed with pepper, salt, pounded nutmeg and  chopped parsley; beat the slices a little, lay them on a board and wash  the upper side with the egg, cover it thick with the bread crumbs, press  them on with a knife, and let them stand to dry a little, that they may  not fall off in frying, then turn them gently, put egg and crumbs on in  the same manner, put them into a pan of boiling lard, and fry them a  light brown; have some good gravy ready, season it with a tea-spoonful  of curry powder, a large one of wine, and one of lemon pickle, thicken  with butter and brown flour, drain every drop of lard from the cutlets,  lay them in the gravy, and stew them fifteen or twenty minutes, serve  them up garnished with lemon cut in thin slices.           *       *       *       *       *    VEAL CHOPS.    Take the best end of a rack of veal, cut it in chops, with one bone in  each, leave the small end of the bone bare two inches, beat them flat,  and prepare them with eggs and crumbs, as the cutlets, butter some  half-sheets of white paper, wrap one round each chop, skewer it well,  leaving the bare bone out, broil them till done, and take care the paper  does not burn; have nice white sauce in a boat.           *       *       *       *       *    VEAL CUTLETS.    Cut them from the fillet, put them in a stew pan with a piece of nice  pork, a clove of garlic, a bundle of thyme and parsley, pepper and salt,  cover them with water and let them stew ten or fifteen minutes, lay them  on a dish, and when cold cover them well with the crumb of stale bread  finely grated, mixed with the leaves of parsley chopped very small, some  pepper, salt and grated nutmeg; press these on the veal with a knife,  and when a little dried, turn it and do the same to the other side; put  a good quantity of lard in a pan, when it boils lay the cutlets in  carefully that the crumbs may not fall; fry them a little brown, lay  them on a strainer to drain off the grease, do the same with the crumbs  that have fallen in the pan: while this is doing, simmer the water they  were boiled in to half a pint, strain it and thicken with four ounces of  butter and a little browned flour; add a gill of wine and one of  mushroom catsup, put in the cutlets and crumbs, and stew till tender;  add forcemeat balls.           *       *       *       *       *    KNUCKLE OF VEAL.    Boil a half pint of pearl barley in salt and water till quite tender,  drain the water from it and stir in a piece of butter, put it in a deep  dish; have the knuckle nicely boiled in milk and water, and lay it on  the barley, pour some parsley and butter over it.           *       *       *       *       *    BAKED FILLET OF VEAL.    Take the bone out of the fillet, wrap the flap around and sew it, make a  forcemeat of bread crumbs, the fat of bacon, a little onion chopped,  parsley, pepper, salt, and a nutmeg pounded, wet it with the yelks of  eggs, fill the place from which the bone was taken, make holes around it  with a knife and fill them also, and lard the top; put it in a Dutch  oven with a pint of water, bake it sufficiently, thicken the gravy with  butter and brown flour, add a gill of wine and one of mushroom catsup,  and serve it garnished with forcemeat balls fried.           *       *       *       *       *    SCOTCH COLLOPS OF VEAL.    They may be made of the nice part of the rack, or cut from the fillet,  rub a little salt and pepper on them, and fry them a light brown; have a  rich gravy seasoned with wine, and any kind of catsup you choose, with a  few cloves of garlic, and some pounded mace, thicken it, put the collops  in and stew them a short time, take them out, strain the gravy over, and  garnish with bunches of parsley fried crisp, and thin slices of middling  of bacon, curled around a skewer and boiled.           *       *       *       *       *    VEAL OLIVES.    Take the bone out of the fillet and cut thin slices the size of the leg,  beat them flat, rub them with the yelk of an egg beaten, lay on each  piece a thin slice of boiled ham, sprinkle salt, pepper, grated nutmeg,  chopped parsley, and bread crumbs over all, roll them up tight, and  secure them with skewers, rub them with egg and roll them in bread  crumbs, lay them on a tin dripping pan, and set them in an oven; when  brown on one side, turn them, and when sufficiently done, lay them in a  rich highly seasoned gravy made of proper thickness, stew them till  tender, garnish with forcemeat balls and green pickles sliced.           *       *       *       *       *    RAGOUT OF A BREAST OF VEAL.    Separate the joints of the brisket, and saw off the sharp ends of the  ribs, trim it neatly, and half roast it; put it in a stew pan with a  quart of good gravy seasoned with wine, walnut and mushroom catsup, a  tea-spoonful of curry powder, and a few cloves of garlic; stew it till  tender, thicken the gravy, and garnish with sweatbreads nicely broiled.           *       *       *       *       *    FRICANDO OF VEAL.    Cut slices from the fillet an inch thick and six inches long, lard them  with slips of lean middling of bacon, bake them a light brown, stew them  in well seasoned gravy, made as thick as rich cream, serve them up hot,  and lay round the dish sorrel stewed with butter, pepper and salt, till  quite dry.           *       *       *       *       *     TO MAKE A PIE OF SWEETBREADS AND OYSTERS.    Boil the sweetbreads tender, stew the oysters, season them with pepper  and salt, and thicken with cream, butter, the yelks of eggs and flour,  put a puff paste at the bottom and around the sides of a deep dish, take  the oysters up with an egg spoon, lay them in the bottom, and cover them  with the sweetbreads, fill the dish with gravy, put a paste on the top,  and bake it. This is the most delicate pie that can be made. The  sweetbread of veal is the most delicious part, and may be broiled,  fried, or dressed in any way, and is always good.           *       *       *       *       *    MOCK TURTLE OF CALF'S HEAD.    Have the head nicely cleaned, divide the chop from the skull, take out  the brains and tongue, and boil the other parts till tender, take them  out of the water and put into it a knuckle of veal or four pounds of  lean beef, three onions chopped, thyme, parsley, a tea-spoonful of  pounded cloves, the same of mace, salt, and cayenne pepper to your  taste--boil these things together till reduced to a pint, strain it, and  add two gills of red wine, one of mushroom and one of walnut catsup,  thicken it with butter and brown flour; the head must be cut in small  pieces and stewed a few minutes in the gravy; put a paste round the edge  of a deep dish, three folds, one on the other, but none on the bottom;  pour in the meat and gravy, and bake it till the paste is done; pick all  strings from the brains, pound them, and add grated bread, pepper and  salt, make them in little cakes with the yelk of an egg, fry them a nice  brown, boil six egg's hard, leave one whole and divide the others  exactly in two, have some bits of paste nicely baked; when the head is  taken from the oven, lay the whole egg in the middle, and dispose the  others, with the brain cakes and bits of paste tastily around it. If it  be wanted as soup, do not reduce the gravy so much, and after stewing  the head, serve it in a tureen with the brain cakes and forcemeat balls  fried, in place of the eggs and paste. The tongue should be salted and  put in brine; they are very delicate, and four of them boiled and  pealed, and served with four small chickens boiled, make a handsome  dish, either cold or hot, with parsley and butter poured over them.           *       *       *       *       *    TO GRILL A CALF'S HEAD.    Clean and divide it as for the turtle, take out the brains and tongue,  boil it tender, take the eyes out whole, and cut the flesh from the  skull in small pieces; take some of the water it was boiled in for  gravy, put to it salt, cayenne pepper, a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12539"],[0,"Observations Upon the Windward Coast of Africa (#6)"],[1,"from the officers of the garrison, and also  to several of the native inhabitants, among whom were Peppin, Martin, St.  John, and others; the latter, I am sorry to say, was in a bad state of  health; I am much indebted to him for his judicious remarks, and very  intelligent observations. This native received his education in France, and  has acquired a very superior intelligence relative to the present condition  of his country.    Accompanied by Mr. Hamilton, my hospitable and friendly host, and several  of the officers of the Lark, I embarked on board the Eugenie, on the 31st  of May, and arrived in Porto Praya Bay on the 3d of June.    The town of Porto Praya is situated upon a plain, forming a height from the  sea, level with the fort, and is a most wretched place, with a very weak  and vulnerable fortification. In the roads there is good anchorage for  shipping, opposite to Quail island, and for smaller vessels nearer the  shore. It has a governmenthouse, a catholic chapel, a market place, and  jail, built with stone; and is now the residence of the government of the  island of St. Jago, subject to the crown of Portugul. Formerly the  governor's place of abode was at the town of St. Jago, upon the opposite  side of the island: his title is that of governor-general of the islands,  comprehending Mayo, Fogo, &c.    Mayo is remarkable for its salt, which is cast on shore by the rollers or  heavy seas, which at certain periods prevail, and run uncommonly high. The  heat of the sun operating upon the saline particles, produces the salt,  which the inhabitants collect in heaps for sale. We anchored at Mayo for  some hours, and a number of vessels were lying in the roads, chiefly  Americans, taking in this article; it is a very rocky and dangerous  anchorage; we, however, found the traders were willing to undergo the  risque, from the cheapness of the commodity they were in quest of.    It is a most sorry place, with scarce a vestige of vegetation upon its  surface, and its inhabitants apparently live in the greatest misery. They  are governed by a black man, subject to the administration of St. Jago.    The military force of St. Jago is by no means either formidable in numbers  or discipline, and exhibits a most complete picture of despicable  wretchedness.    A black officer, of the name of Vincent, conducted as to the governor, who  received us with politeness, and gave us an invitation to dinner. The town  and garrison were quite in a state of activity and bustle; an officer of  high rank and long residence among them had just paid the debt of nature,  and his body was laid in state in the chapel, in all his paraphernalia. The  greater part of the monks from the monastery of St. Jago were assembled  upon the occasion, to sing requiems for his soul; and the scene was truly  solemn and impressive. We met these ministers of religion at dinner, but  how changed   from that gravity of demeanor which distinguished them in  their acts of external worship. The governor's excellent Madeira was taken  in the most genuine spirit of devotion, accompanied by fervent exclamations  upon its excellent qualities. Upon perceiving this holy fervency in the  pious fraternity, we plied them closely, and frequently joined them in  flowing bumpers, until their ardour began to sink into brutal stupidity,  and the morning's hymns were changed into revelry and bacchanalian roar.        [Illustration: POGO, bearing N. by W. distance about 4 leagues from B  Published Aug 1 1807 by G & W Nicol]          [Illustration: 3 ISLAND of ST. IAGO, distance 6 Miles. 4. PAPS of CAPE  VERDE, bearing at C, _N.N.E._ and at D, _S.E._ by _S._ distance 3 leagues.  Published Aug 1 1807 by G & W Nicol]        This, however, was rather a tax upon the governor's hospitality, as it  deprived him of his _Ciesta_, a common practice with him, almost  immediately after the cloth is withdrawn. When we came ashore the next  morning, we were highly entertained with the anecdotes related to us of the  pranks performed during the night by the convivial priests, many of whom  were unable to fulfil the duties of the altar at the usual hour of prayer.    The natives of St. Jago, with those of the neighbouring islands, are mostly  black, or of a mixed colour, very encroaching in their manners, and much  addicted to knavery. The island is extremely rocky and uneven, but the  vallies are fertile. The inhabitants raise cotton, and they have several  sugar works; the quantity they raise of both, does not, however, much  exceed their own consumption, but there is no doubt that it might be  considerably augmented by industry, even for exportation; but the natives  are indolent, and extremely listless in their habits. The only inducement  in touching at this island is, to procure water and provisions: the former  is good, and the latter consists in hogs, turkeys, ducks, poultry, &c. but  frequently, after they have been visited by a fleet, a great scarcity  prevails.    The commodities the natives require as payment may be purchased at Rag  Fair, being extremely partial to cast off wearing apparel of every  description.    The men are extremely slovenly in their dress; but the women are rather  more correct and uniform, those of the better condition being habited in  muslin, and their hair ornamented, and neatly plaited.    They manufacture a narrow cloth of silk and cotton, which is in high  estimation among them, and its exportation is prohibited, except to  Portugal. Considerable ingenuity is displayed in this manufacture, which is  performed in a loom, differing very little from that used by the ruder  inhabitants of the coast of Africa, and similar to the garter loom in  England. They have horses and mules well adapted to their roads and rugged  paths, which they ride most furiously, particularly the military, who  advance at full speed to a stone wall, or the side of a house, merely to  shew their dexterity in halting.    After being detained here for several days in taking in stock and  provisions, we again weighed with the Crescent brig, and a sloop from  Gambia, bound to London, under our convoy, and after a tedious and very  anxious passage, arrived at Portsmouth on the 4th of August. We were  detained under quarantine until the return of post from London, and  proceeded on shore the following day. There is something in _natale solum_  which charms the soul after a period of absence, and operates so  powerfully, as to fill it with indescribable sensations and delight. Every  object and scene appeals so forcibly to the senses, enraptures the eye, and  so sweetly attunes the mind, as to place this feeling among even the  extacies of our nature, and; the most refined we are capable of enjoying.    It is this love of his country which stimulates man to the noblest deeds;  and, leaving all other considerations, only obedient to its call, separates  him from his most tender connections, and makes him risque his life in its  defence.      \"Where'er we roam, whatever realms to see,  Our hearts untravell'd fondly turn to thee;  Still to our country turn, with ceaseless pain,  And drag, at each remove, a lengthening chain.\"                                          GOLDSMITH.          CHAPTER IV.          _The Author proceeds to London.--Re-embarks for Africa.--Arrives at  Madeira.--Observations on that Island.--Prosecution of the Voyage, and  Arrival in the Sierra Leone River, &c._      Our happy arrival was celebrated at the Crown inn, where Captain Webb and  his first Lieutenant (Younger) joined us; we dined together, and separated  with mutual kind wishes. The next morning Mr. Burrowes and myself proceeded  to London, and were once more rapidly conducted into its busy scene.    Without even time to greet my friends, I again left town for Portsmouth, to  commit myself to the watery element, and revisit the shores. I had so  recently left; and on the 22d of September sailed, in the ship Andersons,  from St. Helen's, under convoy of the Arab post sloop of war, commanded by  Keith Maxwell, Esq. and the Favorite sloop of war, by John Davie, Esq.    We anchored in Funchal Roads, island of Madeira, on Saturday the lath of  October, without experiencing any remarkable event.    When approaching the island of Madeira, it exhibits to the eye a strikingly  beautiful and picturesque view. The uneven surface of the hills, covered  with plantations of vines, and various kinds of herbage, with the exception  of partial spots burnt up by the heat of the sun in the dry season,  displays a singular perspective, which, with the beautiful appearance of  the interspersed villas, churches, and monasteries, form an arrangement  both exquisite and delightful.    After being visited by the boat of health, our party proceeded on shore in  the evening; and upon being made known to the house of Messrs. Murdoch,  Masterton, and Co. were politely invited to breakfast the ensuing morning.    At our appearance, in conformity with our appointment, we were introduced  into the breakfast parlour by Mr. Wardrope, one of the acting partners, to  his lady and sister, who received us with engaging civilities and  attention.    After our friendly meal, we perambulated the town of Funchal, and attended  chapel, which so far from being a house of devotion, presented to our  contemplation a rendezvous for intrigue and the retirement of a  conversazione.    Funchiale or Funchal, takes its derivation from Funcho, signifying in the  Portuguese language, Fennel; it is situated at the bottom of a bay, and may  be considered disproportionate to the island, in extent and appearance, as  it is ill built, and the streets remarkably narrow and ill paved. The  churches are decorated with ornaments, and pictures of images and saints,  most wretchedly executed: I understand, however, that a much better taste  is displayed in the convents, more especially that of the Franciscans, in  which is a small chapel, exhibiting"]]]
