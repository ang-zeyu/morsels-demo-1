In its place the images of  the day filed past him like the dance of figures on a motion picture  screen, and always, like the repeated entrance of the hero, the other  images grew small and dim. He saw again the burly stranger wading  through the crowd in the arena, shaking off the packed mob as the prow  of a stately ship shakes off the water, to either side.    At length he started out of bed and glanced through the window. The  moving shadow still swept across the lighted shades of his father's  room; so he donned bathrobe and slippers and went down the long hall. At  the door he did not stop to knock, for he was too deeply concerned by  this time to pay any heed to convention. He grasped the knob and threw  the door wide open. What happened then was so sudden that he could not  be sure afterward what he had seen. He was certain that the door opened  on a lighted room, yet before he could step in the lights were snapped  out.    He was staring into a deep void of night; and a silence came about him  like a whisper. Out of that silence he thought after a second that he  caught the sound of a hurried breathing, louder and louder, as though  someone were creeping upon him. He glanced over his shoulder in a slight  panic, but down the grey hall on either side there was nothing to be  seen. Once more he looked back into the solemn room, opened his lips to  speak, changed his mind, and closed the door again.    Yet when he looked down again from his own room the lights shone once  more on the shades of his father's windows. Past them brushed the shadow  of the pacing man, up and down, up and down. He turned his eyes away to  the jagged tops of the young trees, to the glimpses of dark fields  beyond them, and inhaled the scent of the wet, green things. It seemed  to Anthony as if it all were hostile--as though the whole outdoors were  besieging this house.    He caught the sway of the pacing figure whose shadow moved in regular  rhythm across the yellow shades. It entered his mind, clung there, and  finally he began to pace in the same cadence, up and down the room. With  every step he felt that he was entering deeper into the danger which  threatened John Woodbury. What danger? For answer to himself he stepped  to the windows and pulled down the shades. At least he could be alone.          CHAPTER VI      JOHN BARD    There is no cleanser of the mind like a morning bath. The same cold,  whipping spray which calls up the pink blood, glowing through the marble  of the skin, drives the ache of sleep from the brain, and washes away at  once all the recorded thoughts of yesterday. So in place of a crowded  slate of wonders and doubts, Anthony bore down to the breakfast table a  willingness to take what the morning might bring and forget the night  before.    John Woodbury was already there, helping himself from the covered  dishes, for the meal was served in the English style. There was the  usual \"Good-morning, sir,\" \"Good-morning, Anthony,\" and then they took  their places at the table. A cautious survey of the craglike face of his  father showed no traces of a sleepless night; but then, what could a  single night of unrest mean to that body of iron?    He ventured, remembering the implied command to remain within the house  until further orders: \"You asked me to speak to you, sir, before I left  the house. I'd rather like to take a ride this morning.\"    And the imperturbable voice replied: \"You've worn your horses out  lately. Better give them a day of rest.\"    That was all, but it brought back to Anthony the thought of the shadow  which had swept ceaselessly across the yellow shades of his father's  room; and he settled down to a day of reading. The misty rain of the  night before had cleared the sky of its vapours, so he chose a nook in  the library where the bright spring sun shone full and the open fire  supplied the warmth. At lunch his father did not appear, and Peters  announced that the master was busy in his room with papers. The  afternoon repeated the morning, but with less unrest on the part of  Anthony. He was busy with _L'Assommoir_, and lost himself in the story  of downfall, surrounding himself with each unbeautiful detail.    Lunch was repeated at dinner, for still John Woodbury seemed to be \"busy  with papers in his room.\" A fear came to Anthony that he was to be  dodged indefinitely in this manner, deceived like a child, and kept in  the house until the silent drama was played out. But when he sat in the  library that evening his father came in and quietly drew up a chair by  the fire. The stage was ideally set for a confidence, but none was  forthcoming. The fire shook long, sleepy shadows through the room, the  glow of the two floor-lamps picked out two circles of light, and still  the elder man sat over his paper and would not speak.    _L'Assommoir_ ended, and to rid himself of the grey tragedy, Anthony  looked up and through the windows toward the bright night which lay over  the gardens and terraces outside, for a full moon silvered all with a  flood of light. It was a waiting time, and into it the old-fashioned  Dutch clock in the corner sent its voice with a monotonous, softly  clanging toll of seconds, until Anthony forgot the moonlight over the  outside terraces to watch the gradual sway of the pendulum. A minute,  spent in this manner, was equal to an hour of ordinary time. Fascinated  by the sway of the pendulum he became conscious of the passage of  existence like a river broad and wide and shining which flowed on into  an eternity of chance and left him stationary on the banks.    The voice which sounded at length was as dim and visionary as a part of  his waking dream. It was like one of those imagined calls from the  world of action to him who stood there, watching reality run past and  never stirring himself to take advantage of the thousand opportunities  for action. He would have discarded it for a part of his dream, had not  he seen John Woodbury raise his head sharply, heard the paper fall with  a dry crackling to the floor, and watched the square jaw of his father  jut out in that familiar way which meant danger.    Once more, and this time it was unmistakably clear: \"John Bard,--John  Bard, come out to me!\"    The big, grey man rose with widely staring eyes as if the name belonged  to him, and strode with a thumping step into the secret room. Hardly had  the clang of the closing door died out when he reappeared, fumbling at  his throat. Straight to Anthony he came and extended a key from which  dangled a piece of thin silver chain. It was the key to the secret room.    He took it in both hands, like a young knight receiving the pommel of  his sword from him who has just given the accolade, and stared down at  it until the creaking of the opened French windows startled him to his  feet.    \"Wait!\" he called, \"I will go also!\"    The big man at the open window turned.    \"You will sit where you are now,\" said his harsh voice, \"but if I don't  return you have the key to the room.\"    His burly shoulders disappeared down the steps toward the garden, and  Anthony slipped back into his chair; yet for the first time in his life  he was dreaming of disobeying the command of John Woodbury.  Woodbury--yet the big man had risen automatically in answer to the name  of Bard. John Bard! It struck on his consciousness like two hammer blows  wrecking some fragile fabric; it jarred home like the timed blow of a  pugilist. Woodbury? There might be a thousand men capable of that name,  but there could only be one John Bard, and that was he who had  disappeared down the steps leading to the garden. Anthony swerved in his  chair and fastened his eyes on the Dutch clock. He gave himself five  minutes before he should move.    The watched pot will never boil, and the minute hand of the big clock  dragged forward with deadly pauses from one black mark to the next.  Whispers rose in the room. Something fluttered the fallen newspaper as  if a ghost-hand grasped it but had not the strength to raise; and the  window rattled, with a sharp gust of wind. The last minute Anthony spent  at the open French window with a backward eye on the clock; then he  raced down the steps as though in his turn he answered a call out of the  night.    The placid coolness of the open and the touch of moist, fresh air  against his forehead mocked him as he reached the garden, and there were  reassuring whispers from the trees he passed; yet he went on with a  long, easy stride like a runner starting a distance race. First he  skirted the row of poplars on the drive; then doubled back across the  meadow to his right and ran in a sharp-angling course across an orchard  of apple trees. Diverging from this direction, he circled at a quicker  pace toward the rear of the grounds and coursed like a wild deer over a  stretch of terraced lawns. On one of these low crests he stopped short  under the black shadow of an elm.    In the smooth-shaven centre of the hollow before him, the same ground  over which he had run and played a thousand times in his childhood, he  saw two tall men standing back to back, like fighters come to a last  stand and facing a crowd of foes. They separated at once, striding out  with a measured step, and it was not until they moved that he caught the  glint of metal at the side of one of them and knew that one was the man  who had answered to the name of John Bard and the other was the grey  man who had spoken to him at the Garden the night before. He knew it not  so much by the testimony of his eyes at that dim distance as by a queer,  inner feeling that this must be so. There was also a sense of  familiarity about the whole thing, as if he were looking on something  which he had seen rehearsed a thousand times.

This particular charge was a tough, hard climb, over  sharp, rising ground, which, were a man in perfect physical strength  he would climb slowly. Part of the charge was made over soft,  plowed ground, a part through a lot of prickly pineapple plants and  barbed-wire entanglements. It was slow, hard work, under a blazing  July sun and a perfect hail-storm of bullets, which, thanks to the  poor marksmanship of the Spaniards, \"went high.\"    It has been generally admitted, by all fair-minded writers, that the  colored soldiers saved the day both at El Caney and San Juan Hill.    Notwithstanding their heroic services, they were still to be  subjected, in many cases, to more hardships than their white brother  in arms. When the flag of truce was, in the afternoon of July 3d,  seen, each man breathed a sigh of relief, for the strain had been  very great upon us. During the next eleven days men worked like ants,  digging trenches, for they had learned a lesson of fighting in the  open field. The work went on night and day. The 25th Infantry worked  harder than any other regiment, for as soon as they would finish a  trench they were ordered to move; in this manner they were kept moving  and digging new trenches for eleven days. The trenches left were each  time occupied by a white regiment.    On July 14th it was decided to make a demonstration in front of  Santiago, to draw the fire of the enemy and locate his position. Two  companies of colored soldiers (25th Infantry) were selected for this  purpose, actually deployed as skirmishers and started in advance.  General Shafter, watching the movement from a distant hill, saw that  such a movement meant to sacrifice those men, without any or much  good resulting, therefore had them recalled. Had the movement been  completed it is probable that not a man would have escaped death or  serious wounds. When the news came that General Toral had decided to  surrender, the 25th Infantry was a thousand yards or more nearer the  city of Santiago than any regiment in the army, having entrenched  themselves along the railroad leading into the city.    The following enlisted men of the 25th Infantry were commissioned  for their bravery at El Caney: First Sergeant Andrew J. Smith, First  Sergeant Macon Russell, First Sergeant Wyatt Huffman and Sergeant  Wm. McBryar. Many more were recommended, but failed to receive  commissions. It is a strange incident that all the above-named men  are native North Carolinians, but First Sergeant Huffman, who is from  Tennessee.    The Negro played a most important part in the Spanish-American war. He  was the first to move from the west; first at Camp Thomas Chickamauga  Park, Ga.; first in the jungle of Cuba; among the first killed in  battle; first in the block-house at El Caney, and nearest to the enemy  when he surrendered.

They Comprise Several of the Crack Regiments in Our Army-The Indians  Stand in Abject Terror of them-Their Awful Yells Won a Battle with the  Redskins.    \"It is not necessary to revert to the Civil war to prove that American  Negroes are faithful, devoted wearers of uniforms,\" says a Washington  man, who has seen service in both the army and the navy. \"There are at  the present time four regiments of Negro soldiers in the regular army  of the United States-two outfits of cavalry and two of infantry. All  four of these regiments have been under fire in important Indian  campaigns, and there is yet to be recorded a single instance of a man  in any of the four layouts showing the white feather, and the two  cavalry regiments of Negroes have, on several occasions, found  themselves in very serious situations. While the fact is well known  out on the frontier, I don't remember ever having seen it mentioned  back here that an American Indian has a deadly fear of an American  Negro. The most utterly reckless, dare-devil savage of the copper hue  stands literally in awe of a Negro, and the blacker the Negro the more  the Indian quails. I can't understand why this should be, for the  Indians decline to give their reasons for fearing the black men,  but the fact remains that even a very bad Indian will give the  mildest-mannered Negro imaginable all the room he wants, and to spare,  as any old regular army soldier who has frontiered will tell you.  The Indians, I fancy, attribute uncanny and eerie qualities to the  blacks.\"    \"The cavalry troop to which I belonged soldiered alongside a couple of  troops of the 9th Cavalry, a black regiment, up in the Sioux country  eight or nine years ago. We were performing chain guard, hemming-in  duty, and it was our chief business to prevent the savages from  straying from the reservation. We weren't under instructions to riddle  them if they attempted to pass our guard posts, but were authorized to  tickle them up to any reasonable extent, short of maiming them, with  our bayonets, if any of them attempted to bluff past us. Well, the men  of my troop had all colors of trouble while on guard in holding the  savages in. The Ogalallas would hardly pay any attention to the white  sentries of the chain guard, and when they wanted to pass beyond the  guard limits they would invariably pick out a spot for passage that  was patrolled by a white 'post-humper.' But the guards of the two  black troops didn't have a single run-in with the savages. The Indians  made it a point to remain strictly away from the Negro soldiers' guard  posts. Moreover, the black soldiers got ten times as much obedience  from the Indians loafing around the tepees and wickleups as did we of  the white outfit. The Indians would fairly jump to obey the uniformed  Negroes. I remember seeing a black sergeant make a minor chief go  down to a creek to get a pail of water--an unheard of thing, for the  chiefs, and even the ordinary bucks among the Sioux, always make their  squaws perform this sort of work. This chief was sunning himself,  reclining, beside his tepee, when his squaw started with the bucket  for the creek some distance away. The Negro sergeant saw the move. He  walked up to the lazy, grunting savage.\"    \"'Look a-yeah, yo' spraddle-nosed, yalluh voodoo nigguh,' said the  black sergeant--he was as black as a stovepipe--to the blinking chief,  'jes' shake yo' no-count bones an' tote dat wattuh yo'se'f. Yo' ain'  no bettuh to pack wattuh dan Ah am, yo' heah me.'\"    \"The heap-much Indian chief didn't understand a word of what the Negro  sergeant said to him, but he understands pantomime all right, and when  the black man in uniform grabbed the pail out of the squaw's hand and  thrust it into the dirty paw of the chief the chief went after that  bucket of water, and he went a-loping, too.\"    [Illustration.]    \"The Sioux will hand down to their children's children the story of  a charge that a couple of Negro cavalry troops made during the Pine  Ridge troubles. It was of the height of the fracas, and the bad  Indians were regularly lined up for battle. Those two black troops  were ordered to make the initial swoop upon them. You know the noise  one black man can make when he gets right down to the business of  yelling. Well, these two troops of blacks started their terrific whoop  in unison when they were a mile away from the waiting Sioux, and they  got warmed up and in better practice with every jump their horses  made. I give you my solemn word that in the ears of us of the white  outfit, stationed three miles away, the yelps those two Negro troops  of cavalry gave sounded like the carnival whooping of ten thousand  devils. The Sioux weren't scared a little bit by the approaching  clouds of alkali dust, but, all the same, when the two black troops  were more than a quarter of a mile away the Indians broke and ran as  if the old boy himself were after them, and it was then an easy matter  to round them up and disarm them. The chiefs afterward confessed that  they were scared out by the awful howling of the black soldiers.\"    \"Ever since the war the United States navy has had a fair  representation of Negro bluejackets, and they make first-class naval  tars. There is not a ship in the navy to-day that hasn't from six to  a dozen, anyhow, of Negroes on its muster rolls. The Negro sailors'  names very rarely get enrolled on the bad conduct lists. They are  obedient, sober men and good seamen. There are many petty officers  among them.\"--_The Planet._      THE CHARGE OF THE \"NIGGER NINTH\" ON SAN JUAN HILL.    BY GEORGE E. POWELL      Hark!
