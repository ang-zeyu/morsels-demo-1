They wished  to insist that no one should become a Christian unless he became a Jew at  the same time. If they had succeeded in this, they would have effectually  kept the Gospel of Christ from becoming a catholic religion. But the  Apostle Paul was raised up for the emergency, and he prevented this  suicidal course. Consequently Christianity passed at once into Europe, and  became the religion of Greeks and Romans as well as Jews. Paul struck off  from it its Jewish shell, told them that as Christians they had nothing to  do with the Jewish law, or with Jewish Passovers, Sabbaths, or ceremonies.  As Christians they were only to know Christ, and they were not to know  him according to the flesh, that is, not as a Jew. So Christianity became  at once a catholic religion, consisting in the diffusion of great truths  and a divine life. It overflowed the nationalities of Greece and Rome, of  North Africa, of Persia and Western Asia, at the very beginning. It  conquered the Gothic and German conquerors of the Roman Empire. Under  Arian missionaries, it converted Goths, Vandals, Lombards. Under Nestorian  missionaries, it penetrated as far east as China, and made converts there.  In like manner the Gospel spread over the whole of North Africa, whence it  was afterwards expelled by the power of Islam. It has shown itself,  therefore, capable of adapting itself to every variety of the human race.        Sec. 7. Comparative Theology will probably show that the Ethnic Religions are  one-sided, each containing a Truth of its own, but being defective,  wanting some corresponding Truth. Christianity, or the Catholic Religion,  is complete on every Side.      Brahmanism, for example, is complete on the side of spirit, defective on  the side of matter; full as regards the infinite, empty of the finite;  recognizing eternity but not time, God but not nature. It is a vast system  of spiritual pantheism, in which there is no reality but God, all else  being Maya, or illusion. The Hindoo mind is singularly pious, but also  singularly immoral. It has no history, for history belongs to time. No one  knows when its sacred books were written, when its civilization began,  what caused its progress, what its decline. Gentle, devout, abstract, it  is capable at once of the loftiest thoughts and the basest actions. It  combines the most ascetic self-denials and abstraction from life with the  most voluptuous self-indulgence. The key to the whole system of Hindoo  thought and life is in this original tendency to see God, not man;  eternity, not time; the infinite, not the finite.    Buddhism, which was a revolt from Brahmanism, has exactly the opposite  truths and the opposite defects. Where Brahmanism is strong, it is weak;  where Brahmanism is weak, it is strong. It recognizes man, not God; the  soul, not the all; the finite, not the infinite; morality, not piety. Its  only God, Buddha, is a man who has passed on through innumerable  transmigrations, till, by means of exemplary virtues, he has reached the  lordship of the universe. Its heaven, Nirvana, is indeed the world of  infinite bliss; but, incapable of cognizing the infinite, it calls it  nothing. Heaven, being the inconceivable infinite, is equivalent to pure  negation. Nature, to the Buddhist, instead of being the delusive shadow of  God, as the Brahman views it, is envisaged as a nexus of laws, which  reward and punish impartially both obedience and disobedience.    The system of Confucius has many merits, especially in its influence on  society. The most conservative of all systems, and also the most prosaic,  its essential virtue is reverence for all that is. It is not perplexed by  any fear or hope of change; the thing which has been is that which shall  be; and the very idea of progress is eliminated from the thought of China.  Safety, repose, peace, these are its blessings. Probably merely physical  comfort, earthly _bien-etre_, was never carried further than in the  Celestial Empire. That virtue so much exploded in Western civilization, of  respect for parents, remains in full force in China. The emperor is  honored as the father of his people; ancestors are worshipped in every  family; and the best reward offered for a good action is a patent of  nobility, which does not reach forward to one's children, but backward to  one's parents. This is the bright side of Chinese life; the dark side is  the fearful ennui, the moral death, which falls on a people among whom  there are no such things as hope, expectation, or the sense of progress.  Hence the habit of suicide among this people, indicating their small hold  on life. In every Chinese drama there are two or three suicides. A soldier  will commit suicide rather than go into battle. If you displease a  Chinaman, he will resent the offence by killing himself on your doorstep,  hoping thus to give you some inconvenience. Such are the merits and such  the defects of the system of Confucius.    The doctrine of Zoroaster and of the Zend Avesta is far nobler. Its  central thought is that each man is a soldier, bound to battle for good  against evil. The world, at the present time, is the scene of a great  warfare between the hosts of light and those of darkness. Every man who  thinks purely, speaks purely, and acts purely is a servant of Ormazd, the  king of light, and thereby helps on his cause. The result of this doctrine  was that wonderful Persian empire, which astonished the world for  centuries by its brilliant successes; and the virtue and intelligence of  the Parsees of the present time, the only representatives in the world of  that venerable religion. The one thing lacking to the system is unity. It  lives in perpetual conflict. Its virtues are all the virtues of a soldier.  Its defects and merits are, both, the polar opposites of those of China.  If the everlasting peace of China tends to moral stagnation and death, the  perpetual struggle and conflict of Persia tends to exhaustion. The Persian  empire rushed through a short career of flame to its tomb; the Chinese  empire vegetates, unchanged, through a myriad of years.           *       *       *       *       *    If Brahmanism and Buddhism occupy the opposite poles of the same axis of  thought,--if the system of Confucius stands opposed, on another axis, to  that of Zoroaster,--we find a third development of like polar antagonisms  in the systems of ancient Egypt and Greece. Egypt stands for Nature;  Greece for Man. Inscrutable as is the mystery of that Sphinx of the Nile,  the old religion of Egypt, we can yet trace some phases of its secret. Its  reverence for organization appears in the practice of embalming. The  bodies of men and of animals seemed to it to be divine. Even vegetable  organization had something sacred in it: \"O holy nation,\" said the Roman  satirist, \"whose gods grow in gardens!\" That plastic force of nature which  appears in organic life and growth made up, in various forms, as we shall  see in the proper place, the Egyptian Pantheon. The life-force of nature  became divided into the three groups of gods, the highest of which  represented its largest generalizations. Kneph, Neith, Sevech, Pascht, are  symbols, according to Lepsius, of the World-Spirit, the World-Matter,  Space and Time. Each circle of the gods shows us some working of the  mysterious powers of nature, and of its occult laws. But when we come to  Greece, these personified laws turn into men. Everything in the Greek  Pantheon is human. All human tendencies appear transfigured into glowing  forms of light on Mount Olympus. The gods of Egypt are powers and laws;  those of Greece are persons.    The opposite tendencies of these antagonist forms of piety appear in the  development of Egyptian and Hellenic life. The gods of Egypt were  mysteries too far removed from the popular apprehension to be objects of  worship; and so religion in Egypt became priestcraft. In Greece, on the  other hand, the gods were too familiar, too near to the people, to be  worshipped with any real reverence. Partaking in all human faults and  vices, it must sooner or later come to pass that familiarity would breed  contempt. And as the religion of Egypt perished from being kept away from  the people, as an esoteric system in the hands of priests, that of Greece,  in which there was no priesthood as an order, came to an end because the  gods ceased to be objects of respect at all.           *       *       *       *       *    We see, from these examples, how each of the great ethnic religions tends  to a disproportionate and excessive, because one-sided, statement of some  divine truth or law. The question then emerges at this point: \"Is  Christianity also one-sided, or does it contain in itself _all_ these  truths?\" Is it _teres atque rotundus_, so as to be able to meet every  natural religion with a kindred truth, and thus to supply the defects of  each from its own fulness? If it can be shown to possess this amplitude,  it at once is placed by itself in an order of its own. It is not to be  classified with the other religions, since it does not share their one  family fault. In every other instance we can touch with our finger the  weak place, the empty side. Is there any such weak side in Christianity?  It is the office of Comparative Theology to answer.    The positive side of Brahmanism we saw to be its sense of spiritual  realities. That is also fully present in Christianity. Not merely does  this appear in such New Testament texts as these: \"God is spirit,\" \"The  letter killeth, the spirit giveth life\": not only does the New Testament  just graze and escape Pantheism in such passages as \"From whom, and  through whom, and to whom are all things,\" \"Who is above all, and through  all, and in us all,\" \"In him we live and move and have our being,\" but the  whole history of Christianity is the record of a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1468"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 1 (#6)"],[1,"place far more glorious than if  she had, as at one time seemed not improbable, acquired by the sword  an ascendancy similar to that which formerly belonged to the Roman  republic.    Cooped up once more within the limits of the island, the warlike people  employed in civil strife those arms which had been the terror of Europe.  The means of profuse expenditure had long been drawn by the English  barons from the oppressed provinces of France. That source of supply  was gone: but the ostentatious and luxurious habits which prosperity had  engendered still remained; and the great lords, unable to gratify their  tastes by plundering the French, were eager to plunder each other.  The realm to which they were now confined would not, in the phrase of  Comines, the most judicious observer of that time, suffice for them all.  Two aristocratical factions, headed by two branches of the royal family,  engaged in a long and fierce struggle for supremacy. As the animosity  of those factions did not really arise from the dispute about the  succession it lasted long after all ground of dispute about the  succession was removed. The party of the Red Rose survived the last  prince who claimed the crown in right of Henry the Fourth. The party  of the White Rose survived the marriage of Richmond and Elizabeth.  Left without chiefs who had any decent show of right, the adherents of  Lancaster rallied round a line of bastards, and the adherents of York  set up a succession of impostors. When, at length, many aspiring nobles  had perished on the field of battle or by the hands of the executioner,  when many illustrious houses had disappeared forever from history, when  those great families which remained had been exhausted and sobered by  calamities, it was universally acknowledged that the claims of all the  contending Plantagenets were united in the house of Tudor.    Meanwhile a change was proceeding infinitely more momentous than the  acquisition or loss of any province, than the rise or fall of  any dynasty. Slavery and the evils by which slavery is everywhere  accompanied were fast disappearing.    It is remarkable that the two greatest and most salutary social  revolutions which have taken place in England, that revolution which, in  the thirteenth century, put an end to the tyranny of nation over nation,  and that revolution which, a few generations later, put an end to the  property of man in man, were silently and imperceptibly effected. They  struck contemporary observers with no surprise, and have received from  historians a very scanty measure of attention. They were brought about  neither by legislative regulations nor by physical force. Moral causes  noiselessly effaced first the distinction between Norman and Saxon, and  then the distinction between master and slave. None can venture to fix  the precise moment at which either distinction ceased. Some faint traces  of the old Norman feeling might perhaps have been found late in the  fourteenth century. Some faint traces of the institution of villenage  were detected by the curious so late as the days of the Stuarts; nor has  that institution ever, to this hour, been abolished by statute.    It would be most unjust not to acknowledge that the chief agent in  these two great deliverances was religion; and it may perhaps be doubted  whether a purer religion might not have been found a less efficient  agent. The benevolent spirit of the Christian morality is undoubtedly  adverse to distinctions of caste. But to the Church of Rome such  distinctions are peculiarly odious; for they are incompatible with other  distinctions which are essential to her system. She ascribes to every  priest a mysterious dignity which entitles him to the reverence of every  layman; and she does not consider any man as disqualified, by reason  of his nation or of his family, for the priesthood. Her doctrines  respecting the sacerdotal character, however erroneous they may be, have  repeatedly mitigated some of the worst evils which can afflict society.  That superstition cannot be regarded as unmixedly noxious which, in  regions cursed by the tyranny of race over race, creates an aristocracy  altogether independent of race, inverts the relation between the  oppressor and the oppressed, and compels the hereditary master to kneel  before the spiritual tribunal of the hereditary bondman. To this day,  in some countries where negro slavery exists, Popery appears in  advantageous contrast to other forms of Christianity. It is notorious  that the antipathy between the European and African races is by no  means so strong at Rio Janerio as at Washington. In our own country this  peculiarity of the Roman Catholic system produced, during the middle  ages, many salutary effects. It is true that, shortly after the battle  of Hastings, Saxon prelates and abbots were violently deposed, and that  ecclesiastical adventurers from the Continent were intruded by hundreds  into lucrative benefices. Yet even then pious divines of Norman blood  raised their voices against such a violation of the constitution of the  Church, refused to accept mitres from the hands of William, and charged  him, on the peril of his soul, not to forget that the vanquished  islanders were his fellow Christians. The first protector whom the  English found among the dominant caste was Archbishop Anselm. At a  time when the English name was a reproach, and when all the civil and  military dignities of the kingdom were supposed to belong exclusively  to the countrymen of the Conqueror, the despised race learned, with  transports of delight, that one of themselves, Nicholas Breakspear,  had been elevated to the papal throne, and had held out his foot to be  kissed by ambassadors sprung from the noblest houses of Normandy. It was  a national as well as a religious feeling that drew great multitudes to  the shrine of Becket, whom they regarded as the enemy of their enemies.  Whether he was a Norman or a Saxon may be doubted: but there is no doubt  that he perished by Norman hands, and that the Saxons cherished his  memory with peculiar tenderness and veneration, and, in their popular  poetry, represented him as one of their own race. A successor of Becket  was foremost among the refractory magnates who obtained that charter  which secured the privileges both of the Norman barons and of the Saxon  yeomanry. How great a part the Roman Catholic ecclesiastics subsequently  had in the abolition of villenage we learn from the unexceptionable  testimony of Sir Thomas Smith, one of the ablest Protestant counsellors  of Elizabeth. When the dying slaveholder asked for the last sacraments,  his spiritual attendants regularly adjured him, as he loved his soul,  to emancipate his brethren for whom Christ had died. So successfully had  the Church used her formidable machinery that, before the Reformation  came, she had enfranchised almost all the bondmen in the kingdom  except her own, who, to do her justice, seem to have been very tenderly  treated.    There can be no doubt that, when these two great revolutions had been  effected, our forefathers were by far the best governed people in  Europe. During three hundred years the social system had been in a  constant course of improvement. Under the first Plantagenets there had  been barons able to bid defiance to the sovereign, and peasants degraded  to the level of the swine and oxen which they tended. The exorbitant  power of the baron had been gradually reduced. The condition of the  peasant had been gradually elevated. Between the aristocracy and  the working people had sprung up a middle class, agricultural and  commercial. There was still, it may be, more inequality than is  favourable to the happiness and virtue of our species: but no man was  altogether above the restraints of law; and no man was altogether below  its protection.    That the political institutions of England were, at this early period,  regarded by the English with pride and affection, and by the most  enlightened men of neighbouring nations with admiration and envy,  is proved by the clearest evidence. But touching the nature of these  institutions there has been much dishonest and acrimonious controversy.    The historical literature of England has indeed suffered grievously from  a circumstance which has not a little contributed to her prosperity. The  change, great as it is, which her polity has undergone during the  last six centuries, has been the effect of gradual development, not of  demolition and reconstruction. The present constitution of our country  is, to the constitution under which she flourished five hundred years  ago, what the tree is to the sapling, what the man is to the boy. The  alteration has been great. Yet there never was a moment at which the  chief part of what existed was not old. A polity thus formed must abound  in anomalies. But for the evils arising from mere anomalies we have  ample compensation. Other societies possess written constitutions  more symmetrical. But no other society has yet succeeded in uniting  revolution with prescription, progress with stability, the energy of  youth with the majesty of immemorial antiquity.    This great blessing, however, has its drawbacks: and one of those  drawbacks is that every source of information as to our early history  has been poisoned by party spirit. As there is no country where  statesmen have been so much under the influence of the past, so there is  no country where historians have been so much under the influence of  the present. Between these two things, indeed, there is a natural  connection. Where history is regarded merely as a picture of life and  manners, or as a collection of experiments from which general maxims  of civil wisdom may be drawn, a writer lies under no very pressing  temptation to misrepresent transactions of ancient date. But where  history is regarded as a repository of titledeeds, on which the rights  of governments and"]]]
