Of the friend by whom the facts were attested I can only say,  that if I found myself at liberty to name him, the rank which he holds  in his profession, as well as his attainments in science and philosophy,  form an undisputed claim to the most implicit credit.    It was the fortune of this gentleman to be called in to attend the  illness of a person now long deceased, who in his lifetime stood, as I  understand, high in a particular department of the law, which often  placed the property of others at his discretion and control, and whose  conduct, therefore, being open to public observation, he had for many  years borne the character of a man of unusual steadiness, good sense,  and integrity. He was, at the time of my friend's visits, confined  principally to his sick-room, sometimes to bed, yet occasionally  attending to business, and exerting his mind, apparently with all its  usual strength and energy, to the conduct of important affairs intrusted  to him; nor did there, to a superficial observer, appear anything in his  conduct, while so engaged, that could argue vacillation of intellect, or  depression of mind. His outward symptoms of malady argued no acute or  alarming disease. But slowness of pulse, absence of appetite, difficulty  of digestion, and constant depression of spirits, seemed to draw their  origin from some hidden cause, which the patient was determined to  conceal. The deep gloom of the unfortunate gentleman--the embarrassment,  which he could not conceal from his friendly physician--the briefness  and obvious constraint with which he answered the interrogations of his  medical adviser, induced my friend to take other methods for prosecuting  his inquiries. He applied to the sufferer's family, to learn, if  possible, the source of that secret grief which was gnawing the heart  and sucking the life-blood of his unfortunate patient. The persons  applied to, after conversing together previously, denied all knowledge  of any cause for the burden which obviously affected their relative. So  far as they knew--and they thought they could hardly be deceived--his  worldly affairs were prosperous; no family loss had occurred which could  be followed with such persevering distress; no entanglements of  affection could be supposed to apply to his age, and no sensation of  severe remorse could be consistent with his character. The medical  gentleman had finally recourse to serious argument with the invalid  himself, and urged to him the folly of devoting himself to a lingering  and melancholy death, rather than tell the subject of affliction which  was thus wasting him. He specially pressed upon him the injury which he  was doing to his own character, by suffering it to be inferred that the  secret cause of his dejection and its consequences was something too  scandalous or flagitious to be made known, bequeathing in this manner to  his family a suspected and dishonoured name, and leaving a memory with  which might be associated the idea of guilt, which the criminal had died  without confessing. The patient, more moved by this species of appeal  than by any which had yet been urged, expressed his desire to speak out  frankly to Dr.----. Every one else was removed, and the door of the  sick-room made secure, when he began his confession in the following  manner:--    \"You cannot, my dear friend, be more conscious than I, that I am in the  course of dying under the oppression of the fatal disease which consumes  my vital powers; but neither can you understand the nature of my  complaint, and manner in which it acts upon me, nor, if you did, I fear,  could your zeal and skill avail to rid me of it.\"--\"It is possible,\"  said the physician, \"that my skill may not equal my wish of serving you;  yet medical science has many resources, of which those unacquainted with  its powers never can form an estimate. But until you plainly tell me  your symptoms of complaint, it is impossible for either of us to say  what may or may not be in my power, or within that of medicine.\"--\"I may  answer you,\" replied the patient, \"that my case is not a singular one,  since we read of it in the famous novel of Le Sage. You remember,  doubtless, the disease of which the Duke d'Olivarez is there stated to  have died?\"--\"Of the idea,\" answered the medical gentleman, \"that he was  haunted by an apparition, to the actual existence of which he gave no  credit, but died, nevertheless, because he was overcome and heart-broken  by its imaginary presence.\"--\"I, my dearest doctor,\" said the sick man,  \"am in that very case; and so painful and abhorrent is the presence of  the persecuting vision, that my reason is totally inadequate to combat  the effects of my morbid imagination, and I am sensible I am dying, a  wasted victim to an imaginary disease.\" The medical gentleman listened  with anxiety to his patient's statement, and for the present judiciously  avoiding any contradiction of the sick man's preconceived fancy,  contented himself with more minute inquiry into the nature of the  apparition with which he conceived himself haunted, and into the history  of the mode by which so singular a disease had made itself master of his  imagination, secured, as it seemed, by strong powers of the  understanding, against an attack so irregular. The sick person replied  by stating that its advances were gradual, and at first not of a  terrible or even disagreeable character. To illustrate this, he gave the  following account of the progress of his disease:--    \"My visions,\" he said, \"commenced two or three years since, when I found  myself from time to time embarrassed by the presence of a large cat,  which came and disappeared I could not exactly tell how, till the truth  was finally forced upon me, and I was compelled to regard it as no  domestic household cat, but as a bubble of the elements, which had no  existence save in my deranged visual organs or depraved imagination.  Still I had not that positive objection to the animal entertained by a  late gallant Highland chieftain, who has been seen to change to all the  colours of his own plaid if a cat by accident happened to be in the room  with him, even though he did not see it. On the contrary, I am rather a  friend to cats, and endured with so much equanimity the presence of my  imaginary attendant, that it had become almost indifferent to me; when,  within the course of a few months, it gave place to, or was succeeded  by, a spectre of a more important sort, or which at least had a more  imposing appearance. This was no other than the apparition of a  gentleman-usher, dressed as if to wait upon a Lord Lieutenant of  Ireland, a Lord High Commissioner of the Kirk, or any other who bears on  his brow the rank and stamp of delegated sovereignty.    \"This personage, arrayed in a court dress, with bag and sword, tamboured  waistcoat, and chapeau-bras, glided beside me like the ghost of Beau  Nash; and, whether in my own house or in another, ascended the stairs  before me, as if to announce me in the drawing-room, and at sometimes  appeared to mingle with the company, though it was sufficiently evident  that they were not aware of his presence, and that I alone was sensible  of the visionary honours which this imaginary being seemed desirous to  render me. This freak of the fancy did not produce much impression on  me, though it led me to entertain doubts on the nature of my disorder  and alarm for the effect it might produce on my intellects. But that  modification of my disease also had its appointed duration. After a few  months the phantom of the gentleman-usher was seen no more, but was  succeeded by one horrible to the sight and distressing to the  imagination, being no other than the image of death itself--the  apparition of a _skeleton_. Alone or in company,\" said the unfortunate  invalid, \"the presence of this last phantom never quits me. I in vain  tell myself a hundred times over that it is no reality, but merely an  image summoned up by the morbid acuteness of my own excited imagination  and deranged organs of sight. But what avail such reflections, while the  emblem at once and presage of mortality is before my eyes, and while I  feel myself, though in fancy only, the companion of a phantom  representing a ghastly inhabitant of the grave, even while I yet breathe  on the earth? Science, philosophy, even religion, has no cure for such a  disorder; and I feel too surely that I shall die the victim to so  melancholy a disease, although I have no belief whatever in the reality  of the phantom which it places before me.\"    The physician was distressed to perceive, from these details, how  strongly this visionary apparition was fixed in the imagination of his  patient. He ingeniously urged the sick man, who was then in bed, with  questions concerning the circumstances of the phantom's appearance,  trusting he might lead him, as a sensible man, into such contradictions  and inconsistencies as might bring his common-sense, which seemed to be  unimpaired, so strongly into the field as might combat successfully the  fantastic disorder which produced such fatal effects. \"This skeleton,  then,\" said the doctor, \"seems to you to be always present to your  eyes?\" \"It is my fate, unhappily,\" answered the invalid, \"always to see  it.\" \"Then I understand,\" continued the physician, \"it is now present to  your imagination?\" \"To my imagination it certainly is so,\" replied the  sick man. \"And in what part of the chamber do you now conceive the  apparition to appear?\" the physician inquired. \"Immediately at the foot  of my bed. When the curtains are left a little open,\" answered the  invalid, \"the skeleton, to my thinking, is placed between them, and  fills the vacant space.\" \"You say you are sensible of the delusion,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14466"],[0,"South African Memories (#6)"],[1,"most kindly in the absence of her husband, who was in the  Transvaal, superintending the departure of the remaining prisoners. Here  we seemed to have left warlike conditions behind us, for the town was  agog with the excitement of a cricket-match, between Lord Hawke's eleven  and a Natal fifteen. On the cricket-field we met again two of our  _Tantallon Castle_ fellow-passengers, Mr. Guest and Mr. H. Milner, who  had come down from Johannesburg with the cricketers. We were interested  to compare notes and to hear Mr. Milner's adventures, which really made  us smile, though they could hardly have been a laughing matter to him at  the time. He told us that, after twice visiting Captain C. Coventry, who  was wounded in the Raid, at the Krugersdorp Hospital without  molestation, on the third occasion, when returning by train to  Johannesburg, he was roughly pulled out of his carriage at ten o'clock  at night, and told that, since he had no passport, he was to be  arrested on the charge of being a spy. In vain did he tell them that  only at the last station his passport had been demanded in such  peremptory terms that he had been forced to give it up. They either  would not or could not understand him. In consequence the poor man  tasted the delights of a Boer gaol for a whole night, and, worst  indignity of all, had for companions two criminals and a crowd of dirty  Kaffirs. The following morning, he said, his best friend would not have  known him, so swollen and distorted was his face from the visitations of  the inseparable little companions of the Kaffir native. He was liberated  on bail next day, and finally set free, with a scanty apology of  mistaken identity. At any other time such an insult to an Englishman  would have made some stir; as it was, everyone was so harassed that he  was hardly pitied.    The Governor returned two days before our departure, and we had a gay  time, between entertainments for the cricketers and festivities given by  the 7th Hussars. Feeling in Durban, with regard to the Raiders, was then  running high, and for hours did a vast crowd wait at the station merely  in order to give the troopers of the Chartered Forces some hearty  cheers, albeit they passed at midnight in special trains without  stopping. Very loyal, too, were these colonists, and no German would  have had a pleasant time of it there just then, with the Kaiser's famous  telegram to Kruger fresh in everyone's memory.    From Pietermaritzburg to Johannesburg the railway journey was a very  interesting one. North of Newcastle we saw a station bearing the name of  Ingogo; later on the train wound round the base of Majuba Hill, and when  that was felt behind it plunged into a long rocky tunnel which pierces  the grassy slope on which the tragedy of Laing's Nek was enacted--all  names, alas! too well known in the annals of our disasters. After  leaving the Majuba district, we came to the Transvaal frontier, where we  had been told we might meet with scanty courtesy. However, we had no  disagreeable experiences, and then the train emerged on the endless  rolling green plains which extend right up to and beyond the mining  district of the Rand.    Now and then one perceived a trek waggon and oxen with a Boer and his  family, either preceded or followed by a herd of cattle, winding their  slow way along the dusty red track they call road. At the stations  wild-looking Kaffir women, half naked and anything but attractive in  appearance, came and stared at the train and its passengers. It is in  this desolate country that Johannesburg, the Golden City, sprang up, as  it were, like a fungus, almost in a night. Nine years previously the  Rand--since the theatre of so much excitement and disappointment--the  source of a great part of the wealth of London at the present day, was  as innocent of buildings and as peaceful in appearance as those lonely  plains over which we had travelled. As we approached Johannesburg,  little white landmarks like milestones made their appearance, and these,  we were told, were new claims pegged out. The thought suggested itself  that this part of South Africa is in some respects a wicked country,  with, it would almost seem, a blight resting on it: sickness, to both  man and beast, is always stalking round; drought is a constant scourge  to agriculture; the locust plagues ruin those crops and fruit that  hailstones and scarcity of water have spared; and all the while men vie  with and tread upon one another in their rush and eagerness after the  gold which the land keeps hidden. Small wonder this district has proved  such a whirlpool of evil influences, where everyone is always striving  for himself, and where disillusions and bitter experiences have caused  each man to distrust his neighbour.

CHAPTER IV         JOHANNESBURG AND PRETORIA IN 1896         \"Little white mice of chance,       Coats of wool and corduroy pants,       Gold and wine, women and sin,       I'll give to you, if you let me in       To the glittering house of chance.\"               _American Dice Incantation_.      At Johannesburg we were the guests of Mr. Abe Bailey at Clewer Lodge.  Our host, however, was unfortunately absent, \"detained\" in the precincts  of the gaol at Pretoria, although allowed out on bail. In the same house  he had entertained in 1891 my brother Randolph[9] and his friend Captain  G. Williams, Royal Horse Guards, on their way to Mashonaland. One of my  first visitors was another fellow-traveller of theirs, Mr. H.C. Perkins,  the celebrated American mining expert. This gentleman was a great friend  of Randolph's, and he spoke most touchingly of his great attachment to  the latter, and of his grief at his death. For five years Mr. and Mrs.  Perkins had lived in Johannesburg, where they both enjoyed universal  respect, and their approaching departure, to settle once more in  America, was deplored by all. Considered to be the highest mining expert  of the day, Mr. Perkins had seen the rise of the Rand since its infancy,  and he had been shrewd enough to keep out of the late agitation and its  disturbances. Under his guidance we saw the sights of the towns: the  far-famed Rand Club; the Market Square, crammed, almost for the first  time since the so-called \"revolution,\" with trek-waggons and their Boer  drivers; the much-talked-of \"Gold-fields\" offices, barred and  barricaded, which had been the headquarters of the Reform Committee; the  Standard Bank, where the smuggled arms had been kept; and finally the  Exchange and the street enclosed by iron chains, where the stock markets  were principally carried on. We were also shown the interior of the  Stock Exchange itself, though we were warned that it was scarcely worth  a visit at that time of depression. We heard the \"call of the shares,\"  which operation only took twenty minutes, against nearly two hours  during the time of the recent boom. Instead of the listless,  bored-looking individuals below us, who only assumed a little excitement  when the revolving, clock-like machine denoted any popular share, we  were told that a few months ago every available space had been crowded  by excited buyers and sellers--some without hats, others in their  shirt-sleeves, almost knocking one another over in their desire to do  business. Those must indeed have been palmy days, when the money so  lightly made was correspondingly lightly spent; when champagne replaced  the usual whisky-split at the Rand Club, and on all sides was to be  heard the old and well-known formula, \"Here's luck,\" as the successful  speculator toasted an old friend or a newcomer.    However, to return to Johannesburg as we found it, after the 1895 boom.  Even then it seemed to me that for the first time in South Africa I saw  life. Cape Town, with its pathetic dullness and palpable efforts to keep  up a show of business; Kimberley, with its deadly respectability--both  paled in interest beside their younger sister, so light-hearted,  reckless, and enterprising. Before long, in spite of gloomy reflections  on the evils of gold-seeking, I fell under the fascination of what was  then a wonderful town, especially wonderful from its youth. The  ever-moving crowds which thronged the streets, every man of which  appeared to be full of important business and in a desperate hurry,  reminded one of the City in London. Smart carriages with well-dressed  ladies drove rapidly past, the shops were cunningly arranged with  tempting wares, and all this bustle and traffic was restored in little  over a week. A fortnight previously a revolution was impending and a  siege was looming ahead. Business had been at a complete standstill,  the shops and houses barred and barricaded, and many of the inhabitants  were taking a hurried departure; while bitterness, discord, and racial  feeling were rampant. Now, after a few days, that cosmopolitan and  rapidly changing population appeared to have buried their differences,  and the uninitiated would never have guessed the town had passed, and  was, indeed, still passing, through troublous times. Mr. Perkins,  however, was pessimistic, and told us appearances were misleading. He  rightly foresaw many lean years for those interested in the immediate  future of the Rand, though even he, perhaps, hardly realized how lean  those would become. Since those days much water has flown under the  bridge, and the trade of the town, not to speak of the mining industry,  has gone from bad to worse. Recently Federation, the dream of many a  statesman connected with South Africa, has opened a new vista of  political peace and prosperity to its chastened citizens. Many of these,  in affluent circumstances in 1896, have since gone under"]]]
