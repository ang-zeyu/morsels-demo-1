[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11716"],[0,"The Balkans: A History of Bulgaria—Serbia—Greece—Rumania—Turkey (#6)"],[1,"_caesar_ was a title often accorded by Byzantium to relatives of  the emperor or to distinguished men of Greek or other nationality, and  though it was originally the equivalent of the highest title, it had long  since ceased to be so: the emperor's designations were _basileus_ and  _autocrat[=o]r_). From this time there were two Bulgarias--eastern and  western. The eastern half was now little more than a Byzantine province,  and the western became the centre of national life and the focus of  national aspirations.    Another factor which militated against the internal progress of Bulgaria  was the spread of the Bogomil heresy in the tenth century. This remarkable  doctrine, founded on the dualism of the Paulicians, who had become an  important political force in the eastern empire, was preached in the  Balkan peninsula by one Jeremiah Bogomil, for the rest a man of uncertain  identity, who made Philippopolis the centre of his activity. Its principal  features were of a negative character, and consequently it was very  difficult successfully to apply force against them. The Bogomils  recognized the authority neither of Church nor of State; the validity  neither of oaths nor of human laws. They refused to pay taxes, to fight,  or to obey; they sanctioned theft, but looked upon any kind of punishment  as unjustifiable; they discountenanced marriage and were strict  vegetarians. Naturally a heresy so alarming in its individualism shook to  its foundations the not very firmly established Bulgarian society.  Nevertheless it spread with rapidity in spite of all persecutions, and its  popularity amongst the Bulgarians, and indeed amongst all the Slavs of the  peninsula, is without doubt partly explained by political reasons. The  hierarchy of the Greek Church, which supported the ruling classes of the  country and lent them authority at the same time that it increased its  own, was antipathetic to the Slavs, and the Bogomil heresy drew much  strength from its nationalistic colouring and from the appeal which it  made to the character of the Balkan Slavs, who have always been intolerant  of government by the Church. But neither the civil nor the ecclesiastical  authorities were able to cope with the problem; indeed they were apt to  minimize its importance, and the heresy was never eradicated till the  arrival on the scene of Islam, which proved as attractive to the  schismatics as the well-regulated Orthodox Church had been the reverse.    The third quarter of the tenth century witnessed a great recrudescence of  the power of Constantinople under the Emperor Nikiphoros Phokas, who  wrested Cyprus and Crete from the Arabs and inaugurated an era of  prosperity for the eastern empire, giving it a new lease of vigorous and  combative life. Wishing to reassert the Greek supremacy in the Balkan  peninsula his first act was to refuse any further payment of tribute to  the Bulgarians as from 966; his next was to initiate a campaign against  them, but in order to make his own success in this enterprise less costly  and more assured he secured the co-operation of the Russians under  Svyatoslav, Prince of Kiev; this potentate's mother Olga had visited  Constantinople in 957 and been baptized (though her son and the bulk of  the population were still ardent heathens), and commercial intercourse  between Russia and Constantinople by means of the Dnieper and the Black  Sea was at that time lively. Svyatoslav did not want pressing, and  arriving with an army of 10,000 men in boats, overcame northern Bulgaria  in a few days (967); they were helped by Shishman and the western Bulgars,  who did not mind at what price Peter and the eastern Bulgars were crushed.  Svyatoslav was recalled to Russia in 968 to defend his home from attacks  by the Tartar Pechenegs, but that done, he made up his mind to return to  Bulgaria, lured by its riches and by the hope of the eventual possession  of Constantinople.    The Emperor Nikiphoros was by now aware of the danger he had imprudently  conjured up, and made a futile alliance with eastern Bulgaria; but in  January 969 Peter of Bulgaria died, and in December of the same year  Nikiphoros was murdered by the ambitious Armenian John Tzimisces,[1] who  thereupon became emperor. Svyatoslav, seeing the field clear of his  enemies, returned in 970, and in March of that year sacked and occupied  Philippopolis. The Emperor John Tzimisces, who was even abler both as  general and as diplomat than his predecessor, quietly pushed forward his  warlike preparations, and did not meet the Russians till the autumn, when  he completely defeated them at Arcadiopolis (the modern Lule-Burgas). The  Russians retired north of the Balkan range, but the Greeks followed them.  John Tzimisces besieged them in the capital Preslav, which he stormed,  massacring many of the garrison, in April 972. Svyatoslav and his  remaining troops escaped to Silistria (the Durostorum of Trajan) on the  Danube, where again, however, they were besieged and defeated by the  indefatigable emperor. At last peace was made in July 972, the Russians  being allowed to go free on condition of the complete evacuation of  Bulgaria and a gift of corn; the adventurous Svyatoslav lost his life at  the hands of the Pechenegs while making his way back to Kiev. The triumph  of the Greeks was complete, and it can be imagined that there was not much  left of the earthenware Bulgaria after the violent collision of these two  mighty iron vessels on the top of it. Eastern Bulgaria (i.e. Moesia and  Thrace) ceased to exist, becoming a purely Greek province; John Tzimisces  made his triumphal entry into Constantinople, followed by the two sons of  Peter of Bulgaria on foot; the elder was deprived of his regal attributes  and created _magistros_, the younger was made a eunuch.    [Footnote 1: John the Little.]        7    _The Rise and Fall of 'Western Bulgaria' and the Greek Supremacy_,  963-1186      Meanwhile western Bulgaria had not been touched, and it was thither that  the Bulgarian patriarch Damian removed from Silistria after the victory of  the Greeks, settling first in Sofia and then in Okhrida in Macedonia,  where the apostate Shishman had eventually made his capital. Western  Bulgaria included Macedonia and parts of Thessaly, Albania, southern and  eastern Serbia, and the westernmost parts of modern Bulgaria. It was from  this district that numerous anti-Hellenic revolts were directed after the  death of the Emperor John Tzimisces in 976. These culminated during the  reign of Samuel (977-1014), one of the sons of Shishman. He was as capable  and energetic, as unscrupulous and inhuman, as the situation he was called  upon to fill demanded. He began by assassinating all his relations and  nobles who resented his desire to re-establish the absolute monarchy, was  recognized as _tsar_ by the Holy See of Rome in 981, and then began to  fight the Greeks, the only possible occupation for any self-respecting  Bulgarian ruler. The emperor at that time was Basil II (976-1025), who was  brave and patriotic but young and inexperienced. In his early campaigns  Samuel carried all before him; he reconquered northern Bulgaria in 985,  Thessaly in 986, and defeated Basil II near Sofia the same year. Later he  conquered Albania and the southern parts of Serbia and what is now  Montenegro and Hercegovina. In 996 he threatened Salonika, but first of  all embarked on an expedition against the Peloponnese; here he was  followed by the Greek general, who managed to surprise and completely  overwhelm him, he and his son barely escaping with their lives.    From that year (996) his fortune changed; the Greeks reoccupied northern  Bulgaria, in 999, and also recovered Thessaly and parts of Macedonia. The  Bulgars were subjected to almost annual attacks on the part of Basil II;  the country was ruined and could not long hold out. The final disaster  occurred in 1014, when Basil II utterly defeated his inveterate foe in a  pass near Seres in Macedonia. Samuel escaped to Prilip, but when he beheld  the return of 15,000 of his troops who had been captured and blinded by  the Greeks he died of syncope. Basil II, known as Bulgaroctonus, or  Bulgar-killer, went from victory to victory, and finally occupied the  Bulgarian capital of Okhrida in 1016. Western Bulgaria came to an end, as  had eastern Bulgaria in 972, the remaining members of the royal family  followed the emperor to the Bosphorus to enjoy comfortable captivity, and  the triumph of Constantinople was complete.    From 1018 to 1186 Bulgaria had no existence as an independent state; Basil  II, although cruel, was far from tyrannical in his general treatment of  the Bulgars, and treated the conquered territory more as a protectorate  than as a possession. But after his death Greek rule became much more  oppressive. The Bulgarian patriarchate (since 972 established at Okhrida)  was reduced to an archbishopric, and in 1025 the see was given to a Greek,  who lost no time in eliminating the Bulgarian element from positions of  importance throughout his diocese. Many of the nobles were transplanted to  Constantinople, where their opposition was numbed by the bestowal of  honours. During the eleventh century the peninsula was invaded frequently  by the Tartar Pechenegs and Kumans, whose aid was invoked both by Greeks  and Bulgars; the result of these incursions was not always favourable to  those who had promoted them; the barbarians invariably stayed longer and  did more damage than had been bargained for, and usually left some of  their number behind as unwelcome settlers.    In this way the ethnological map of the Balkan peninsula became ever more  variegated. To the Tartar settlers were added colonies of Armenians and  Vlakhs by various emperors. The last touch was given by the arrival of the  Normans in 1081 and the passage of the crusaders in 1096. The wholesale  depredations of the latter naturally made the inhabitants of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11718"],[0,"The Camp Fire Girls at School; Or, The Wohelo Weavers (#6)"],[1,"my  college fund and the extra rent would soon pay it back.\" Migwan's eyes  were shining with ambition.    Mrs. Gardiner shook her head wearily. \"We never could do it,\" she  answered. \"Something would surely happen to upset our plans.\"    But Migwan was not to be waved aside. She had seen a vision of increased  income and meant to make it come true. She argued the merits of her idea  until Mrs. Gardiner was too tired of the subject to argue back, and  agreed that if Miss Kent approved the step she would give her consent.  Nyoda was therefore called into consultation. She looked at the house  and saw no reason why the improvements could not be made to advantage.  The house was in a good neighborhood, and furnished rooms were always in  demand. She advised the step and gave Mrs. Gardiner the names of several  contractors whom she knew to be reliable. Mrs. Gardiner was a little  breathless at the speed with which things were moving, but there was no  stopping Migwan once she was started. A contractor was engaged and work  begun on the house one week from the day Migwan had thought of the plan.    Meanwhile financial matters at home were in bad shape, and Mrs. Gardiner  willingly gave over the distribution of the family budget to Migwan. She  herself was utterly unable to cope with the problem. And Migwan  surprised even herself by the efficient way in which she managed things.  By planning menus with the greatest care and omitting meat from the bill  of fare to a great extent she made it possible to live on their slender  income until the rent would begin to come in again.      \"Whatever have you done with yourself?\" asked Gladys at the weekly  meeting of the Camp Fire. \"Of late you rush home from school as if you  were pursued.\" Migwan only laughed and said she had had uncommonly hard  problems to solve these last few weeks. The other girls of course did  not know the exact state of the Gardiner finances, and never dreamed  that Migwan was having a struggle even to stay in high school. She was  such a fine, aristocratic-looking girl, and was so sparkling and witty  all the time that it was hard to connect her with poverty and worry.    \"Let's all go to the matinee next Saturday afternoon,\" suggested Gladys.  \"The 'Blue Bird' is going to be played.\" The girls agreed eagerly and  asked Gladys to get seats for them, all but Migwan, who said nothing.    \"Don't you want to go, Migwan?\" they asked.    \"Not this time,\" Migwan answered in a casual tone. \"There is something  else I have to do Saturday afternoon.\" The girls accepted this  explanation readily. It never occurred to them that Migwan could not  afford to go.    \"What is this mysterious something you are always doing?\" asked Gladys  teasingly. \"Girls, I believe Migwan is writing a book. She has retired  from polite society altogether.\" Migwan smiled blandly at her, but made  no answer.    At home that night, however, she felt very low-spirited indeed. She was  only human, after all, and wanted dreadfully to go to the matinee with  the girls. Gladys would take them all to Schiller's afterward for a  parfait and bring them home in style in her machine. It did not seem  fair that she should be cut off from every pleasure that involved the  spending of a little money. This was her last year in high school, the  year which should be the happiest, but she must resolutely turn her face  away from all those little festivities that add such touches of color to  the memory fabric of school days. She knew that at the merest hint of  her circumstances to Gladys or Nyoda they would have gladly paid her way  everywhere the group went, but Migwan's pride forbade this. If she could  not afford to go to places she would stay at home and nobody would be  any the wiser. Nevertheless, a few tears would come at the thought of  the good time she was missing, and she had no heart to work on her  story.    \"Cry-baby!\" she said to herself fiercely, winking the tears back.  \"Crying because you can't do as you would like all the time! You're lots  better off than poor Hinpoha this very minute, even if she is rich. You  ought to be ashamed of yourself!\" The thought of Hinpoha, who would  likewise miss the jolly party, comforted her somewhat, and she dried her  tears and fell to writing with a will.    Now Nyoda, although she did not know just how hard pressed the Gardiners  were at that time, rather surmised something of the kind, and wondered,  after she left the girls, if that were not the reason for Migwan's not  planning to go to the matinee. She remembered Migwan's saying some time  before that she wanted very much to see \"The Bluebird\" when it came. She  knew it would never do to offer to pay Migwan's way; Migwan was too  proud for that. She lay awake a long time over it and finally formulated  a plan. The next morning when Migwan came to school she saw a  conspicuous notice on the Bulletin Board:    LOST: Handbag containing book of lecture notes and ticket for Saturday  afternoon's performance of \"The Bluebird.\" Finder may keep theater  ticket if he or she will return notebook to Miss Moore, Room 10.    Migwan read the notice and passed on, as did the other pupils. That  morning in English class Nyoda sent Migwan to an unused lecture room to  get an English book she had left there. When Migwan opened the door she  stumbled over something on the floor. It was a lady's handbag. She  opened it and found Miss Moore's notebook and the theater ticket inside.  Miss Moore was overjoyed at the return of the notebook and insisted on  her keeping the ticket, which Migwan at first declined to accept. \"My  dear child,\" said Miss Moore, \"if you knew what trouble I had collecting  those notes you would think, too, that it was worth the price of a  theater ticket to get them back!\" And when Migwan's back was turned she  winked solemnly at Nyoda. By a curious coincidence that seat was  directly behind those occupied by the other Winnebagos!          CHAPTER IV.      ANOTHER KITCHEN.    The night of the last Camp Fire Meeting Gladys and Nyoda might have been  seen in close consultation. \"The first pleasant Saturday,\" said Nyoda.    \"Remember, it's my treat,\" said Gladys.    The first week in November was as balmy as May, with every promise of  fine weather on Saturday. Accordingly, Nyoda gathered all the Winnebagos  around her desk on Thursday and made an announcement. Sahwah forgot that  she was in a class room and started to raise a joyful whoop, but Nyoda  stifled it in time by putting her hand over her mouth. \"I can't help  it!\" cried Sahwah; \"we're going on a trip up the river! I'm going to  paddle the _Keewaydin_ once more!\"    The plan suggested by Gladys and just announced by Nyoda was this: The  following Saturday they would charter a launch big enough to hold them  all, and follow the course of the Cuyahoga River upstream to the dam at  the falls, where they would land and cook their dinner over an open  fire. They would tow the _Keewaydin_, Sahwah's birchbark canoe, behind  the launch, and some time during the day would manage to let every one  go for a paddle. The Winnebagos thrilled with pleasurable anticipation,  all but Hinpoha, who crept sadly away, for she could not bear to hear  about the fun that was being planned when she could not have a part in  it.    One desire of her heart was being fulfilled, and she was getting thin.  What a whole summer of rigid dieting had not been able to accomplish was  brought to pass by a few weeks of mental suffering, and her clothes were  beginning to hang on her. Her appetite began to fail her, and her aunt,  noticing this, bought her a big bottle of tonic, which, taken before  meals, killed any small desire for food she may have had. Then Aunt  Phoebe decided that the two-mile walk to school was too much for her,  and had her taken and called for in the machine, much to Hinpoha's  disgust, for that walk was her chief joy these days. After a week of the  tonic her soul rebelled against the nauseous dose, and when the first  bottle was empty and Aunt Phoebe sent her to get it refilled, she  \"refilled\" it herself with a mixture of licorice candy and water, which  produced a black syrup similar in appearance to the original medicine,  but minus the bad taste and the stigma of \"patent medicine,\" a thing  which the Winnebagos had promised their Guardian they would not take. As  this was deceiving her aunt she felt obliged to put a blot on her head  'scutcheon, in the form of a black record, but she was so inwardly  amused at it that her appetite improved of its own accord, and Aunt  Phoebe remarked in a gratified way that she had never known the equal of  Mullin's Modifier as a tonic.    Migwan finished her story, copied it carefully on foolscap and sent it  away to a magazine, confident that in a very short time she would behold  it in print, and the payment she would receive for it would keep her in  spending money throughout the school year. So with a light and merry  heart she set out for Gladys's house on Saturday morning, where the  girls were all to meet for the outing. It was one of those dream-like  days in late autumn, when the earth, still decked in her brilliant  garments, seems to lie spellbound in the sunshine, as if there were no  such thing as the coming of winter.    The girls, clad in blue skirts and white middies and heavy sweaters,  were whirled down to the dock in the Evans's automobile, with the  _Keewaydin_ tied upright at the back. The launch was waiting for them,  at one of the big boat docks, sandwiched in between two immense lake  steamers. Nothing could have been a greater contrast to their trip up  the Shadow River the summer before than this excursion. On that other  trip they had been the only living beings on the horizon, and nature was  supreme everywhere, but here they were fairly engulfed by the works of  man. The tiny craft nosed her way among giant steamers, six-hundred-foot  freighters, coal barges, lighters,"]]]
