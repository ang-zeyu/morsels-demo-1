And, moreover, whilst all these wasps  and hornets arrange their cells horizontally, the bee arranges its  comb vertically.    I think it needless to enter into very minute descriptions of the  honeycomb, as all my readers are doubtless perfectly familiar with  its appearance. Each cell, like that made by the wasp, is hexagonal,  and the cells are put together in a manner which secures the greatest  strength for the least possible material. Kirby and Spence state that  \"Maraldi found that the great angles were generally 10 degrees 28  minutes, and the smaller ones 70 degrees 32 minutes: and M Koenig, an  eminent mathematician, calculated that they ought to be 109 degrees  26 minutes, and 70 degrees 34 minutes, to obtain the greatest strength  with any given amount of material.\" Lord Brougham states that he has  discovered that the bee is right and the mathematician was wrong, and  that other mathematicians with whom he has communicated agree with  him, and have detected the source of the error.--_Instinct and  Reason._           *       *       *       *       *    DISASTERS of life, like convulsions of the earth, lay bare the primary  strata of human nature: they expose to us elements we might forget,  or suppose to be transmuted by the alchemy of civilization. In this  respect they are, like those geological expositions, useful lessons  and mementoes to the lawmaker.           *       *       *       *       *    ORIENTAL CARAVANS.    The hadj, or pilgrim-caravan, pursues its route principally by night,  and by torchlight. Moving about four o'clock in the afternoon, it  travels without stopping till an hour or two after the sun is above  the horizon. The extent and luxury of those pilgrimages, in ancient  times especially, almost exceed belief. Haroun, of _Arabian Nights'_  celebrity, performed the pilgrimage no less than nine times, and with  a grandeur becoming the commander of the faithful. The caravan of the  mother of the last of the Abassides numbered one hundred and twenty  thousand camels. Nine hundred camels were employed merely in bearing  the wardrobe of one of the caliphs, and others carried snow with them  to cool their sherbet. Nor was Bagdad alone celebrated for such pomp  and luxury in fulfilling the directions of the Koran. The Sultan of  Egypt, on one occasion, was accompanied by five hundred camels, whose  luscious burdens consisted of sweetmeats and confectionery only; while  two hundred and eighty were entirely laden with pomegranates and other  fruits. The itinerant larder of this potentate contained one thousand  geese and three thousand fowls. Even so late as sixty years since, the  pilgrim-caravan from Cairo was six hours in passing one who saw the  procession.    The departure of such an array, with its thousands of camels  glittering in every variety of trappings, some with two brass  field-pieces each,--others with bells and streamers,--others, again,  with kettle-drummers,--others, covered with purple velvet, with  men walking by their sides playing on flutes and flageolets,--some  glittering with neck ornaments and silver-studded bridles, variegated  with colored beads, and with nodding plumes of ostrich feathers on  their foreheads--to say nothing of the noble, gigantic, sacred camel,  decked with cloth of gold and silk, his bridle studded with jewels and  gold, led by two sheiks in green, with the ark or chapel containing  the Koran written in letters of gold,--forms a dazzling contrast  to the spectacle it not unfrequently presents before its mission is  fulfilled. Numbers of these gaily caparisoned creatures drop and die  miserably, and when the pilgrimage leaves Mecca the air is too often  tainted with the effluvia reeking from the bodies of the camels that  have sunk under the exhausting fatigue of the march. After he had  passed the Akaba, near the head of the Red Sea, the whitened bones  of the dead camels were the land-marks which guided the pilgrim  through the sand-wastes, as he was led on by the alternate hope  and disappointment of the mirage, or \"serab,\" as the Arabs term it.  Burckhardt describes this phenomenon as seen by him when they were  surrounded during a whole day's march by phantom lakes. The color was  of the purest assure,--so clear, that the shadows of the mountains  which bordered the horizon were reflected with extreme precision; and  the delusion of its being a sheet of water was thus rendered perfect.  He had often seen the mirage in Syria and Egypt: there he always found  it of a whitish color, like morning mist, seldom lying steadily on the  plain, almost continually vibrating; but in the case above described  the appearance was very different, and bore the most complete  resemblance to water. This exact similitude the traveler attributes to  the great dryness of the air and earth in the desert where he beheld  it. There, too the appearance of water approached much nearer than in  Syria and Egypt, being often not more than two hundred paces from the  beholders, whereas he had never seen it before at a distance of less  than half-a-mile.--_Fraser, June._           *       *       *       *       *    Letter from the Duke Of Wellington.--A short time since, (says  the _Court Journal_,) the rector of a parish in one of the midland  counties, having obtained subscriptions toward the restoration of his  church, still found himself unable to meet all the claims which the  outlay had occasioned. To supply the deficiency, he wrote to many  persons of wealth and eminence, politely soliciting their aid. The  following is a copy of the reply which he received to the application  made to his Grace:    \"F.M. the Duke of Wellington presents his compliments to Mr. ----. As  Mr. ---- feels that his letter needs apology, the Duke will say no  more on that subject; but he must add, that as there is not a church,  chapel, glebe-house, school, or even a pagoda, built from the north to  the south pole or within the utmost limits of the earth, to which he  (the Duke of Wellington) is not called upon to contribute, the Duke  is surprised that Mr. ----, having already raised L7,500 toward the  restoration of his church, should make application to the Duke, who  has nothing to say either to ---- or to ----shire.\"    Immediately upon the receipt of this, the reverend gentleman was  offered five guineas for the autograph, which he readily accepted,  entering the amount in his subscription-list as the Duke of  Wellington's contribution to the fund.           *       *       *       *       *    RECENT DEATHS.    Mr. Richard J. Wyatt, an eminent English sculptor, died at Rome on  the 29th of May, after a few days' illness, and was buried in the  Protestant burial-ground. The hearse was followed by the British  Consul, the American Charge d'Affairs, and about fifty friends and  artists of all nations. Mr. Wyatt went to Rome in 1822, and worked for  Mr. Gibson. After a few years he commenced his career, in which he has  been so successful. It is said that he has executed commissions to the  extent of L20,000 sterling. He was in the fifty-seventh year of his  age.           *       *       *       *       *    FROM FRASER'S MAGAZINE.    THE DOM OF DANTZIC.    FOUNDED ON FACT.      CHAPTER I.    \"Dumiger, my own Dumiger, you desired me not to disturb you this  night: but you surely cannot know how late it is. I am lonely and  weary, and could not resist coming to you; there is a long line of  pale light behind the Artimshof, it must be the day breaking; yes,  there, the old worn-out clock is striking five, and you are worn out,  Dumiger, so leave your work to sleep;\" and the young girl blushed  deeply as she spoke.    The light in the apartment had burnt out unperceived by Dumiger;  but although pale and thin was the streak of morning's dawn, it was  sufficient to show that in that room was standing a form, beautiful  from its fullness and ripeness. She who addressed the man who was  sitting at the table was a bride but nine days since, and absorbing  indeed must have been the pursuit which kept him from her side. She  had thrown a shawl loosely over her shoulders, which fell in many  folds down to her bare feet; her hair, of that singular thickness  which all nations admire, but which the Germans alone as a nation  possess, was coiled around her small and classic head; there was  on her cheek that soft bloom which is called into existence by  love alone, and which makes the pulses of youth beat quickly as it  gazes. Nothing was wanting to complete her excellence--neither that  refinement which poets love to dwell on sometimes to the prejudice  of other qualities, nor that perfection of feature, the admiration  of which is the first characteristic of early passion; and yet,  notwithstanding, when she placed her hand upon her husband's shoulder  the touch did not arouse him from his reverie. His forehead was  pressed by both his hands as if to restrain the pulsations of the  temples; implements of all description lay around him; small wheels,  and springs of different constructions, segments of circles, and  various sections bore evidence to the deep nature of his studies, and  to the exertion which merited repose. The girl sighed as she looked  at the surrounding chaos; she took one hand gently and unresistingly  on his part from his face, and pressed it to her own. While she  gazed fondly upon the pale; wan countenance which it had concealed,  it seemed, alas! to dawn slowly upon her that this confused heap  of material was but an indication of ideas equally disturbed, and  energies as broken. To whom had she wedded herself? To a man whose  whole soul was absorbed in one idea, and that an idea which evidently  separated him from her, which created a gulf between them, that not  fame, nor power, nor boundless wealth, could ever fill up, for that  gulf is fathomless--the gulf of ambition, for which ambition barters,  as in this instance, its enjoyment--manhood too often its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1298"],[0,"The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains (#6)"],[1,", and the idea of them, smote my American heart,  and I have never forgotten it, nor ever shall, as long as I live. In  their flesh our natural passions ran tumultuous; but often in their  spirit sat hidden a true nobility, and often beneath its unexpected  shining their figures took on heroic stature.    The dealer had styled the Virginian \"a black-headed guy.\" This did well  enough as an unflattered portrait. Judge Henry's trustworthy man, with  whom I was to drive two hundred and sixty-three miles, certainly had a  very black head of hair. It was the first thing to notice now, if one  glanced generally at the table where he sat at cards. But the eye came  back to him--drawn by that inexpressible something which had led the  dealer to speak so much at length about him.    Still, \"black-headed guy\" justly fits him and his next performance. He  had made his plan for this like a true and (I must say) inspired devil.  And now the highly appreciative town of Medicine Bow was to be treated  to a manifestation of genius.    He sat playing his stud-poker. After a decent period of losing and  winning, which gave Trampas all proper time for a change of luck and  a repairing of his fortunes, he looked at Steve and said amiably: \"How  does bed strike you?\"    I was beside their table, learning gradually that stud-poker has in  it more of what I will call red pepper than has our Eastern game. The  Virginian followed his own question: \"Bed strikes me,\" he stated.    Steve feigned indifference. He was far more deeply absorbed in his bet  and the American drummer than he was in this game; but he chose to take  out a fat, florid gold watch, consult it elaborately, and remark, \"It's  only eleven.\"    \"Yu' forget I'm from the country,\" said the black-headed guy. \"The  chickens have been roostin' a right smart while.\"    His sunny Southern accent was again strong. In that brief passage with  Trampas it had been almost wholly absent. But different moods of the  spirit bring different qualities of utterance--where a man comes by  these naturally. The Virginian cashed in his checks.    \"Awhile ago,\" said Steve, \"you had won three months' salary.\"    \"I'm still twenty dollars to the good,\" said the Virginian. \"That's  better than breaking a laig.\"    Again, in some voiceless, masonic way, most people in that saloon had  become aware that something was in process of happening. Several left  their games and came to the front by the bar.    \"If he ain't in bed yet--\" mused the Virginian.    \"I'll find out,\" said I. And I hurried across to the dim sleeping room,  happy to have a part in this.    They were all in bed; and in some beds two were sleeping. How they could  do it--but in those days I was fastidious. The American had come in  recently and was still awake.    \"Thought you were to sleep at the store?\" said he.    So then I invented a little lie, and explained that I was in search of  the Virginian.    \"Better search the dives,\" said he. \"These cow-boys don't get to town  often.\"    At this point I stumbled sharply over something.    \"It's my box of Consumption Killer,\" explained the drummer; \"Well, I  hope that man will stay out all night.\"    \"Bed narrow?\" I inquired.    \"For two it is. And the pillows are mean. Takes both before you feel  anything's under your head.\"    He yawned, and I wished him pleasant dreams.    At my news the Virginian left the bar at once; and crossed to the  sleeping room. Steve and I followed softly, and behind us several  more strung out in an expectant line. \"What is this going to be?\" they  inquired curiously of each other. And upon learning the great novelty  of the event, they clustered with silence intense outside the door where  the Virginian had gone in.    We heard the voice of the drummer, cautioning his bed-fellow. \"Don't  trip over the Killer,\" he was saying. \"The Prince of Wales barked his  shin just now.\" It seemed my English clothes had earned me this title.    The boots of the Virginian were next heard to drop.    \"Can yu' make out what he's at?\" whispered Steve.    He was plainly undressing. The rip of swift unbuttoning told us that the  black-headed guy must now be removing his overalls.    \"Why, thank yu', no,\" he was replying to a question of the drummer.  \"Outside or in's all one to me.\"    \"Then, if you'd just as soon take the wall--\"    \"Why, cert'nly.\" There was a sound of bedclothes, and creaking.  \"This hyeh pillo' needs a Southern climate,\" was the Virginian's next  observation.    Many listeners had now gathered at the door. The dealer and the player  were both here. The storekeeper was present, and I recognized the agent  of the Union Pacific Railroad among the crowd. We made a large company,  and I felt that trembling sensation which is common when the cap of a  camera is about to be removed upon a group.    \"I should think,\" said the drummer's voice, \"that you'd feel your knife  and gun clean through that pillow.\"    \"I do,\" responded the Virginian.    \"I should think you'd put them on a chair and be comfortable.\"    \"I'd be uncomfortable, then.\"    \"Used to the feel of them, I suppose?\"    \"That's it. Used to the feel of them. I would miss them, and that would  make me wakeful.\"    \"Well, good night.\"    \"Good night. If I get to talkin' and tossin', or what not, you'll  understand you're to--\"    \"Yes, I'll wake you.\"    \"No, don't yu', for God's sake!\"    \"Not?\"    \"Don't yu' touch me.\"    \"What'll I do?\"    \"Roll away quick to your side. It don't last but a minute.\" The  Virginian spoke with a reassuring drawl.    Upon this there fell a brief silence, and I heard the drummer clear his  throat once or twice.    \"It's merely the nightmare, I suppose?\" he said after a throat clearing.    \"Lord, yes. That's all. And don't happen twice a year. Was you thinkin'  it was fits?\"    \"Oh, no! I just wanted to know. I've been told before that it was not  safe for a person to be waked suddenly that way out of a nightmare.\"    \"Yes, I have heard that too. But it never harms me any. I didn't want  you to run risks.\"    \"Me?\"    \"Oh, it'll be all right now that yu' know how it is.\" The Virginian's  drawl was full of assurance.    There was a second pause, after which the drummer said:--    \"Tell me again how it is.\"    The Virginian answered very drowsily: \"Oh, just don't let your arm or  your laig touch me if I go to jumpin' around. I'm dreamin' of Indians  when I do that. And if anything touches me then, I'm liable to grab my  knife right in my sleep.\"    \"Oh, I understand,\" said the drummer, clearing his throat. \"Yes.\"    Steve was whispering delighted oaths to himself, and in his joy applying  to the Virginian one unprintable name after another.    We listened again, but now no further words came. Listening very hard,  I could half make out the progress of a heavy breathing, and a restless  turning I could clearly detect. This was the wretched drummer. He was  waiting. But he did not wait long. Again there was a light creak, and  after it a light step. He was not even going to put his boots on in  the fatal neighborhood of the dreamer. By a happy thought Medicine Bow  formed into two lines, making an avenue from the door. And then the  commercial traveller forgot his Consumption Killer. He fell heavily over  it.    Immediately from the bed the Virginian gave forth a dreadful howl.    And then everything happened at once; and how shall mere words narrate  it? The door burst open, and out flew the commercial traveller in his  stockings. One hand held a lump of coat and trousers with suspenders  dangling, his boots were clutched in the other. The sight of us stopped  his flight short. He gazed, the boots fell from his hand; and at his  profane explosion, Medicine Bow set up a united, unearthly noise and  began to play Virginia reel with him. The other occupants of the beds  had already sprung out of them, clothed chiefly with their pistols, and  ready for war. \"What is it?\" they demanded. \"What is it?\"    \"Why, I reckon it's drinks on Steve,\" said the Virginian from his bed.  And he gave the first broad grin that I had seen from him.    \"I'll set 'em up all night!\" Steve shouted, as the reel went on  regardless. The drummer was bawling to be allowed to put at least his  boots on. \"This way, Pard,\" was the answer; and another man whirled him  round. \"This way, Beau!\" they called to him; \"This way, Budd!\" and  he was passed like a shuttle-cock down the line. Suddenly the leaders  bounded into the sleeping-room. \"Feed the machine!\" they said. \"Feed  her!\" And seizing the German drummer who sold jewellery, they flung him  into the trough of the reel. I saw him go bouncing like an ear of corn  to be shelled, and the dance ingulfed him. I saw a Jew sent rattling  after him; and next they threw in the railroad employee, and the other  Jew; and while I stood mesmerized, my own feet left the earth. I shot  from the room and sped like a bobbing cork into this mill race, whirling  my turn in the wake of the others amid cries of, \"Here comes the Prince  of Wales!\" There was soon not much English left about my raiment.    They were now shouting for music. Medicine Bow swept in like a cloud of  dust to where a fiddler sat playing in a hall; and gathering up fiddler  and dancers, swept out again, a larger Medicine Bow, growing all  the while. Steve offered us the freedom of the house, everywhere. He  implored us to call for whatever pleased us, and as many times as we  should please. He ordered the town to be searched for more citizens to  come and help him pay his bet. But changing his mind, kegs and bottles  were now carried along with us. We had found three fiddlers, and these  played busily for us; and thus we set out to visit all cabins and houses  where people might still by some miracle be asleep. The first man put  out his head to decline. But such a possibility had been foreseen by  the proprietor of the store. This seemingly respectable man now came  dragging some sort of apparatus"]]]
