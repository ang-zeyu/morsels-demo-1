Red Pete snorted and started to  shy, for he recognized the clumsy, bouncing weight which had insulted  his back not long before; but this quiet voiced master reassured him,  and he came to a halt.    \"That red devil has cost me a hundred bones and all the skin on my  knees,\" groaned Morgan, \"and I can hardly walk. Damn his eyes. But  say, Dan\"--and his eyes glowed with an admiration which made him  momentarily forget his pains--\"that was some circus stunt you done  down the road there--that changin' of saddles on the run, I never seen  the equal of it!\"    \"If you got hurt in the fall,\" said Dan quietly, overlooking the  latter part of the speech, \"why don't you climb onto Satan. He'll take  you back.\"    Morgan laughed.    \"Say, kid, I'd take a chance with Satan, but there ain't any hospital  for fools handy.\"    \"Go ahead. He won't stir a foot. Steady, Satan!\"    \"All right,\" said Morgan, \"every step is sure like pullin' teeth!\"    He ventured closer to the black stallion, but was stopped short. Black  Bart was suddenly changed to a green-eyed devil, his hair bristling  around his shoulders, his teeth bared, and a snarl that came from the  heart of a killer. Satan also greeted his proposed rider with ears  laid flat back on his neck and a quivering anger.    \"If I'm goin' to ride Satan,\" declared Morgan, \"I got to shoot the dog  first and then blindfold the hoss.\"    \"No you don't,\" said Dan. \"No one else has ever had a seat on Satan,  but I got an idea he'll make an exception for a sort of temporary  cripple. Steady, boy. Here you, Bart, come over here an' keep your  face shut!\"    The dog, after a glance at his master, moved reluctantly away, keeping  his eyes upon Morgan. Satan backed away with a snort. He stopped at  the command of Dan, but when Morgan laid a hand on the bridle and  spoke to him he trembled with fear and anger. The saloon-keeper turned  away.    \"Thankin' you jest the same, Dan,\" he said, \"I think I c'n walk back.  I'd as soon ride a tame tornado as that hoss.\"    He limped on down the road with Dan riding beside him. Black Bart  slunk at his heels, sniffing.    \"Dan, I'm goin' to ask you a favour--an' a big one; will you do it for  me?\"    \"Sure,\" said Whistling Dan. \"Anything I can.\"    \"There's a skunk down there with a bad eye an' a gun that jumps out  of its leather like it had a mind of its own. He picked me for fifty  bucks by nailing a dollar I tossed up at twenty yards. Then he gets a  hundred because I couldn't ride this hoss of his. Which he's made a  plumb fool of me, Dan. Now I was tellin' him about you--maybe I was  sort of exaggeratin'--an' I said you could have your back turned when  the coins was tossed an' then pick off four dollars before they hit  the ground. I made it a bit high, Dan?\"    His eyes were wistful.    \"Nick four round boys before they hit the dust?\" said Dan. \"Maybe I  could, I don't know. I can't try it, anyway, Morgan, because I told  Dad Cumberland I'd never pull a gun while there was a crowd aroun'.\"    Morgan sighed; he hesitated, and then: \"But you promised you'd do me a  favour, Dan?\"    The rider started.    \"I forgot about that--I didn't think----\"    \"It's only to do a shootin' trick,\" said Morgan eagerly. \"It ain't  pullin' a gun on any one. Why, lad, if you'll tell me you got a ghost  of a chance, I'll bet every cent in my cash drawer on you agin that  skunk! You've give me your word, Dan.\"    Whistling Dan shrugged his shoulders.    \"I've given you my word,\" he said, \"an' I'll do it. But I guess Dad  Cumberland'll be mighty sore on me.\"    A laugh rose from the crowd at Morgan's place, which they were nearing  rapidly. It was like a mocking comment on Dan's speech. As they came  closer they could see money changing hands in all directions.    \"What'd you do to my hoss?\" asked Jim Silent, walking out to meet  them.    \"He hypnotized him,\" said Hal Purvis, and his lips twisted over yellow  teeth into a grin of satisfaction.    \"Git out of the saddle damn quick,\" growled Silent. \"It ain't nacheral  he'd let you ride him like he was a plough-hoss. An' if you've tried  any fancy stunts, I'll----\"    \"Take it easy,\" said Purvis as Dan slipped from the saddle without  showing the slightest anger. \"Take it easy. You're a bum loser. When  I seen the black settle down to his work,\" he explained to Dan with  another grin, \"I knowed he'd nail him in the end an' I staked twenty  on you agin my friend here! That was sure a slick change of hosses you  made.\"    There were other losers. Money chinked on all sides to an  accompaniment of laughter and curses. Jim Silent was examining the  roan with a scowl, while Bill Kilduff and Hal Purvis approached Satan  to look over his points. Purvis reached out towards the bridle when a  murderous snarl at his feet made him jump back with a shout. He stood  with his gun poised, facing Black Bart.    \"Who's got any money to bet this damn wolf lives more'n five seconds?\"  he said savagely.    \"I have,\" said Dan.    \"Who in hell are you? What d'you mean by trailing this man-killer  around?\"    He turned to Dan with his gun still poised.    \"Bart ain't a killer,\" said Dan, and the gentleness of his voice was  oil on troubled waters, \"but he gets peeved when a stranger comes nigh  to the hoss.\"    \"All right this time,\" said Purvis, slowly restoring his gun to its  holster, \"but if this wolf of yours looks cross-eyed at me agin he'll  hit the long trail that ain't got any end, savvy?\"    \"Sure,\" said Dan, and his soft brown eyes smiled placatingly.    Purvis kept his right hand close to the butt of his gun and his eyes  glinted as if he expected an answer somewhat stronger than words.  At this mild acquiesence he turned away, sneering. Silent, having  discovered that he could find no fault with Dan's treatment of his  horse, now approached with an ominously thin-lipped smile. Lee Haines  read his face and came to his side with a whisper: \"Better cut out the  rough stuff, Jim. This chap hasn't hurt anything but your cash, and  he's already taken water from Purvis. I guess there's no call for you  to make any play.\"    \"Shut your face, Haines,\" responded Silent, in the same tone. \"He's  made a fool of me by showin' up my hoss, an' by God I'm goin' to give  him a man-handlin' he'll never forgit.\"    He whirled on Morgan.    \"How about it, bar-keep, is this the dead shot you was spillin' so  many words about?\"    Dan, as if he could not understand the broad insult, merely smiled at  him with marvellous good nature.    \"Keep away from him, stranger,\" warned Morgan. \"Jest because he rode  your hoss you ain't got a cause to hunt trouble with him. He's been  taught not to fight.\"    Silent, still looking Dan over with insolent eyes, replied: \"He sure  sticks to his daddy's lessons. Nice an' quiet an' house broke, ain't  he? In my part of the country they dress this kind of a man in gal's  clothes so's nobody'll ever get sore at him an' spoil his pretty face.  Better go home to your ma. This ain't any place for you. They's men  aroun' here.\"    There was another one of those grimly expectant hushes and then a  general guffaw; Dan showed no inclination to take offence. He merely  stared at brawny Jim Silent with a sort of childlike wonder.    \"All right,\" he said meekly, \"if I ain't wanted around here I figger  there ain't any cause why I should stay. You don't figger to be peeved  at me, do you?\"    The laughter changed to a veritable yell of delight. Even Silent  smiled with careless contempt.    \"No, kid,\" he answered, \"if I was peeved at you, you'd learn it  without askin' questions.\"    He turned slowly away.    \"Maybe I got jaundice, boys,\" he said to the crowd, \"but it seems to  me I see something kind of yellow around here!\"    The delightful subtlety of this remark roused another side-shaking  burst of merriment. Dan shook his head as if the mystery were beyond  his comprehension, and looked to Morgan for an explanation. The  saloon-keeper approached him, struggling with a grin.    \"It's all right, Dan,\" he said. \"Don't let 'em rile you.\"    \"You ain't got any cause to fear that,\" said Silent, \"because it can't  be done.\"          CHAPTER V      FOUR IN THE AIR    Dan looked from Morgan to Silent and back again for understanding.  He felt that something was wrong, but what it was he had not the  slightest idea. For many years old Joe Cumberland had patiently taught  him that the last offence against God and man was to fight. The old  cattleman had instilled in him the belief that if he did not cross the  path of another, no one would cross his way. The code was perfect  and satisfying. He would let the world alone and the world would not  trouble him. The placid current of his life had never come to \"white  waters\" of wrath.    Wherefore he gazed bewildered about him. They were laughing--they were  laughing unpleasantly at him as he had seen men laugh at a fiery young  colt which struggled against the rope. It was very strange. They could  not mean harm. Therefore he smiled back at them rather uncertainly.  Morgan slapped at his shoulder by way of good-fellowship and to  hearten him, but Dan slipped away under the extended hand with a  motion as subtle and swift as the twist of a snake when it flees for  its hole. He had a deep aversion for contact with another man's body.  He hated it as the wild horse hates the shadow of the flying rope.    \"Steady up, pal,\" said Morgan, \"the lads mean no harm. That tall man  is considerable riled; which he'll now bet his sombrero agin you when  it comes to shootin'.\"    He turned back to Silent.    \"Look here, partner,\" he said, \"this is the man I said could nail the  four dollars before they hit the dust. I figger you don't think how it  can be done, eh?\"    \"Him?\" said Silent in deep disgust. \"Send him back to his ma before  somebody musses him all up! Why, he don't even pack a gun!\"    Morgan waited a long moment so that the little silence would make his  next speech"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10890"],[0,"Dio's Rome, Volume 5 (#6)"],[1,"sacrifices, banquets, and exhibitions of insolence in all  of their sacred places, but chiefly in the grove of Andate,--that being  the name of their personification of Victory, to whom they paid the most  excessive reverence.    [Sidenote:--8--] It happened that Paulinus had already brought Mona to  terms; hence on learning of the disaster in Britain he at once set sail  thither from Mona. He was unwilling to risk a conflict with the barbarians  immediately, for he feared their numbers and their frenzy; therefore he  was for postponing the battle to a more convenient season. But as he grew  short of food and the barbarians did not desist from pressing him hard, he  was compelled, though contrary to his plan, to enter into an engagement  with them. Buduica herself, heading an army of about twenty-three myriads  of men, rode on a chariot and assigned the rest to their several stations.  Now Paulinus could not extend his phalanx the width of her whole line,  for, even if the men had been drawn up only one deep, they would not have  stretched far enough, so inferior were they in numbers: nor did he dare to  join battle with one compact force, for fear he should be surrounded and  cut down. Accordingly, he separated his army into three divisions in order  to fight at several points at once, and he made each of the divisions so  strong that it could not easily be broken through. While ordering and  arranging his men he likewise exhorted them, saying:    [Sidenote:--9--] \"Up, fellow-soldiers! Up, men of Rome! Show these pests  how much even in misfortune we surpass them. It is a shame for you now to  lose ingloriously what but a short while ago you gained by your valor.  Often have we ourselves and also our fathers with far fewer numbers than  we have at the present conquered far more numerous antagonists. Fear not  the host of them or their rebellion: their boldness rests on nothing  better than headlong rashness unaided by arms and exercise. Fear not  because they have set on fire a few cities: they took these not by force  nor after a battle, but one was betrayed and the other abandoned. Do you  now exact from them the proper penalty for these deeds, that so they may  learn by actual experience what they undertook when they wronged such men  as us.\"    [Sidenote:--10--] After speaking these words to some he came to a second  group and said: \"Now is the occasion, now, fellow-soldiers, for zeal, for  daring. If to-day you prove yourselves brave men, you will recover what  has slipped from your grasp. If you overcome this enemy, no one else will  any longer withstand us. By one such battle you will both make sure of  your present possessions and subdue whatever is left. All soldiers  stationed anywhere else will emulate you and foes will be terror-stricken.  Therefore, since it is in your own hands either to rule fearlessly all  mankind, both the nations that your fathers left under your control and  those which you yourselves have gained in addition, or else to be bereft  of them utterly, choose rather to be free, to rule, to live in wealth, to  enjoy prosperity, than through indolence to suffer the reverse of these  conditions.\"    [Sidenote:--11--] After making an address of this sort to the group in  question, he came up to the third division and said also to them: \"You  have heard what sort of acts these wretches have committed against us, nay  more, you have even seen some of them. Therefore choose either yourselves  to suffer the same treatment as previous victims and furthermore to be  driven entirely out of Britain, or else through victory to avenge those  that perished and also to give to the rest of mankind an example of mild  clemency toward the obedient, of necessary severity toward the rebellious.  I entertain the highest hopes of victory for our side, counting on the  following factors: first, the assistance of the gods; they usually  cooperate with the party that has been wronged: second, our inherited  bravery; we are Romans and have shown ourselves superior to all mankind in  various instances of valor: next, our experience; we have defeated and  subdued these very men that are now arrayed against us: last, our good  name; it is not worthy opponents but our slaves with whom we are coming in  conflict, persons who enjoyed freedom and self-government only so far as  we allowed it. Yet even should the outcome prove contrary to our  hope,--and I will not shrink from mentioning even this contingency,--it is  better for us to fall fighting bravely than to be captured and impaled, to  see our own entrails cut out, to be spitted on red hot skewers, to perish  dissolved in boiling water, when we have fallen into the power of  creatures that are very beasts, savage, lawless, godless. Let us therefore  either beat them or die on the spot. Britain shall be a noble memorial to  us, even though all subsequent Romans should be driven from it; for in any  case our bodies shall forever possess the land.\"    [Sidenote:--12--] At the conclusion of exhortations of this sort and  others like them he raised the signal for battle. Thereupon they  approached each other, the barbarians making a great outcry intermingled  with menacing incantations, but the Romans silently and in order until  they came within a javelin's throw of the enemy. Then, while the foe were  advancing against them at a walk, the Romans started at a given word and  charged them at full speed, and when the clash came easily broke through  the opposing ranks; but, as they were surrounded by the great numbers,  they had to be fighting everywhere at once. Their struggle took many  forms. In the first place, light-armed troops might be in conflict with  light-armed, heavy-armed be arrayed against heavy-armed, cavalry join  issue with cavalry; and against the chariots of the barbarians the Roman  archers would be contending. Again, the barbarians would assail the Romans  with a rush of their chariots, knocking them helter-skelter, but, since  they fought without breastplates, would be themselves repulsed by the  arrows. Horseman would upset foot-soldier, and foot-soldier strike down  horseman; some, forming in close order, would go to meet the chariots, and  others would be scattered by them; some would come to close quarters with  the archers and rout them, whereas others were content to dodge their  shafts at a distance: and all these things went on not at one spot, but in  the three divisions at once. They contended for a long time, both parties  being animated by the same zeal and daring. Finally, though late in the  day, the Romans prevailed, having slain numbers in the battle, beside the  wagons, or in the wood: they also captured many alive. Still, not a few  made their escape and went on to prepare to fight a second time.  Meanwhile, however, Buduica fell sick and died. The Britons mourned her  deeply and gave her a costly burial; but, as they themselves were this  time really defeated, they scattered to their homes.--So far the history  of affairs in Britain.    [Sidenote: A.D. 62 (a.u. 815)] [Sidenote:--13--] In Rome Nero had before  this sent away Octavia Augusta, on account of his concubine Sabina, and  subsequently he put her to death. This he did in spite of the opposition  of Burrus, who tried to prevent his sending her away, and once said to  him: \"Well, then, give her back her dowry\" (by which he meant the  sovereignty). Indeed, Burrus used such unmitigated frankness that on one  occasion, when he was asked by the emperor a second time for an opinion on  matters regarding which he had already made clear his attitude, he  answered bluntly: \"When I have once had my say about anything, don't ask  me again.\" So Nero disposed of him by poison. He also appointed to command  the Pretorians a certain Ofonius Tigillinus, who outstripped all his  contemporaries in licentiousness and bloodiness. [It was he who won Nero  away from them and made light of his colleague Rufus.] [Footnote:  _Foenius Rufus._] To him the famous sentence of Pythias is said to have  been directed. She had proved the only exception when all the other  attendants of Octavia had joined Sabina in attacking their mistress,  despising the one because she was in misfortune and toadying to the other  because her influence was strong. Pythias alone had refused though cruelly  tortured to utter lies against Octavia, and finally, as Tigillinus  continued to urge her, she spat in his face, saying:      \"My mistress's privy parts are cleaner, Tigillinus, than your mouth.\"    [Sidenote:--14--] The troubles of his relatives Nero turned into laughter  and jest. For instance, after killing Plautus [Footnote: _Rubellirs  Plautus_.] he took a look at his head when it was brought to him and  remarked: \"I didn't know he had such a big nose,\" as much as to say that  he would have spared him, had he been aware of this fact beforehand. And  though he spent practically his whole existence in tavern life, he forbade  others to sell in taverns anything boiled save vegetables and pea-soup. He  put Pallas out of the way because the latter had accumulated great wealth  that could be counted by the ten thousand myriads. Likewise he was very  liable to peevishness that showed in his behavior, and at such times he  would not speak a word to his servants or freedmen but write on tablets  whatever he wanted as well as any orders that he had to give them.    [Sidenote: A.D. 63 (a.u. 816)] [Sidenote:--15--] Indeed, when many of  those who had gathered at Antium perished, Nero made that, too, an  occasion for a festival.    A certain Thrasea gave his opinion to the effect that for a senator the  extreme penalty should be exile.    [Sidenote: A.D. 64 (a.u. 817)] To such lengths did  Nero's self-indulgence go that he actually drove chariots in public.  Again, one time after the slaughter of beasts he straightway brought water  into the theatre by means of pipes and produced a sea-fight: then he let  the water"]]]
