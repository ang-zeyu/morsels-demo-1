He plunges into a panegyric on the Corsican  patriots, when he is arrested by the thought that many censure them  for rebelling at all. \"The divine laws forbid revolt. But what have  divine laws to do with a purely human affair? Just think of the  absurdity--divine laws universally forbidding the casting off of a  usurping yoke! ... As for human laws, there cannot be any after the  prince violates them.\" He then postulates two origins for government  as alone possible. Either the people has established laws and  submitted itself to the prince, or the prince has established laws. In  the first case, the prince is engaged by the very nature of his office  to execute the covenants. In the second case, the laws tend, or do not  tend, to the welfare of the people, which is the aim of all  government: if they do not, the contract with the prince dissolves of  itself, for the people then enters again into its primitive state.  Having thus proved the sovereignty of the people, Buonaparte uses his  doctrine to justify Corsican revolt against France, and thus concludes  his curious medley: \"The Corsicans, following all the laws of justice,  have been able to shake off the yoke of the Genoese, and may do the  same with that of the French. Amen.\"    Five days later he again gives the reins to his melancholy. \"Always  alone, though in the midst of men,\" he faces the thought of suicide.  With an innate power of summarizing and balancing thoughts and  sensations, he draws up arguments for and against this act. He is in  the dawn of his days and in four months' time he will see \"la patrie,\"  which he has not seen since childhood. What joy! And yet--how men have  fallen away from nature: how cringing are his compatriots to their  conquerors: they are no longer the enemies of tyrants, of luxury, of  vile courtiers: the French have corrupted their morals, and when \"la  patrie\" no longer survives, a good patriot ought to die. Life among  the French is odious: their modes of life differ from his as much as  the light of the moon differs from that of the sun.--A strange  effusion this for a youth of seventeen living amidst the full glories  of the spring in Dauphine. It was only a few weeks before the ripening  of cherries. Did that cherry-idyll with Mdlle. de Colombier lure him  back to life? Or did the hope of striking a blow for Corsica stay his  suicidal hand? Probably the latter; for we find him shortly afterwards  tilting against a Protestant minister of Geneva who had ventured to  criticise one of the dogmas of Rousseau's evangel.    The Genevan philosopher had asserted that Christianity, by enthroning  in the hearts of Christians the idea of a Kingdom not of this world,  broke the unity of civil society, because it detached the hearts of  its converts from the State, as from all earthly things. To this the  Genevan minister had successfully replied by quoting Christian  teachings on the subject at issue. But Buonaparte fiercely accuses  the pastor of neither having understood, nor even read, \"Le Contrat  Social\": he hurls at his opponent texts of Scripture which enjoin  obedience to the laws: he accuses Christianity of rendering men slaves  to an anti-social tyranny, because its priests set up an authority in  opposition to civil laws; and as for Protestantism, it propagated  discords between its followers, and thereby violated civic unity.  Christianity, he argues, is a foe to civil government, for it aims at  making men happy in this life by inspiring them with hope of a future  life; while the aim of civil government is \"to lend assistance to the  feeble against the strong, and by this means to allow everyone to  enjoy a sweet tranquillity, the road of happiness.\" He therefore  concludes that Christianity and civil government are diametrically  opposed.    In this tirade we see the youth's spirit of revolt flinging him not  only against French law, but against the religion which sanctions it.  He sees none of the beauty of the Gospels which Rousseau had  admitted. His views are more rigid than those of his teacher.  Scarcely can he conceive of two influences, the spiritual and the  governmental, working on parallel lines, on different parts of man's  nature. His conception of human society is that of an indivisible,  indistinguishable whole, wherein materialism, tinged now and again by  religious sentiment and personal honour, is the sole noteworthy  influence. He finds no worth in a religion which seeks to work from  within to without, which aims at transforming character, and thus  transforming the world. In its headlong quest of tangible results his  eager spirit scorns so tardy a method: he will \"compel men to be  happy,\" and for this result there is but one practicable means, the  Social Contract, the State. Everything which mars the unity of the  Social Contract shall be shattered, so that the State may have a clear  field for the exercise of its beneficent despotism. Such is  Buonaparte's political and religious creed at the age of seventeen,  and such it remained (with many reservations suggested by maturer  thought and self-interest) to the end of his days. It reappears in his  policy anent the Concordat of 1802, by which religion was reduced to  the level of handmaid to the State, as also in his frequent assertions  that he would never have quite the same power as the Czar and the  Sultan, because he had not undivided sway over the consciences of his  people.[10] In this boyish essay we may perhaps discern the  fundamental reason of his later failures. He never completely  understood religion, or the enthusiasm which it can evoke; neither did  he ever fully realize the complexity of human nature, the  many-sidedness of social life, and the limitations that beset the  action even of the most intelligent law-maker.[11]    His reading of Rousseau having equipped him for the study of human  society and government, he now, during his first sojourn at Auxonne  (June, 1788--September, 1789), proceeds to ransack the records of the  ancient and modern world. Despite ill-health, family troubles, and the  outbreak of the French Revolution, he grapples with this portentous  task. The history, geography, religion, and social customs of the  ancient Persians, Scythians, Thracians, Athenians, Spartans,  Egyptians, and Carthaginians--all furnished materials for his  encyclopaedic note-books. Nothing came amiss to his summarizing genius.  Here it was that he gained that knowledge of the past which was to  astonish his contemporaries. Side by side with suggestions on  regimental discipline and improvements in artillery, we find notes on  the opening episodes of Plato's \"Republic,\" and a systematic summary  of English history from the earliest times down to the Revolution of  1688. This last event inspired him with special interest, because the  Whigs and their philosophic champion, Locke, maintained that James II.  had violated the original contract between prince and people.  Everywhere in his notes Napoleon emphasizes the incidents which led to  conflicts between dynasties or between rival principles. In fact,  through all these voracious studies there appear signs of his  determination to write a history of Corsica; and, while inspiriting  his kinsmen by recalling the glorious past, he sought to weaken the  French monarchy by inditing a \"Dissertation sur l'Autorite Royale.\"  His first sketch of this work runs as follows:         \"23 October, 1788. Auxonne.         \"This work will begin with general ideas as to the origin and the       enhanced prestige of the name of king. Military rule is favourable       to it: this work will afterwards enter into the details of the       usurped authority enjoyed by the Kings of the twelve Kingdoms of       Europe.         \"There are very few Kings who have not deserved dethronement[12].\"    This curt pronouncement is all that remains of the projected work. It  sufficiently indicates, however, the aim of Napoleon's studies. One  and all they were designed to equip him for the great task of  re-awakening the spirit of the Corsicans and of sapping the base of  the French monarchy.    But these reams of manuscript notes and crude literary efforts have an  even wider source of interest. They show how narrow was his outlook on  life. It all turned on the regeneration of Corsica by methods which he  himself prescribed. We are therefore able to understand why, when his  own methods of salvation for Corsica were rejected, he tore himself  away and threw his undivided energies into the Revolution.    Yet the records of his early life show that in his character there was  a strain of true sentiment and affection. In him Nature carved out a  character of rock-like firmness, but she adorned it with flowers of  human sympathy and tendrils of family love. At his first parting from  his brother Joseph at Autun, when the elder brother was weeping  passionately, the little Napoleon dropped a tear: but that, said the  tutor, meant as much as the flood of tears from Joseph. Love of his  relatives was a potent factor of his policy in later life; and slander  has never been able wholly to blacken the character of a man who loved  and honoured his mother, who asserted that her advice had often been  of the highest service to him, and that her justice and firmness of  spirit marked her out as a natural ruler of men. But when these  admissions are freely granted, it still remains true that his  character was naturally hard; that his sense of personal superiority  made him, even as a child, exacting and domineering; and the sequel  was to show that even the strongest passion of his youth, his  determination to free Corsica from France, could be abjured if  occasion demanded, all the force of his nature being thenceforth  concentrated on vaster adventures.           *      *      *      *      *          CHAPTER "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14314"],[0,"Etiquette (#6)"],[1,"in her city, and leave the letter with your card at  her door. Usually you do not ask to see her; but if it is between four and  six o'clock it is quite correct to do so if you choose. Presenting  yourself with a letter is always a little awkward. Most people prefer to  leave their cards without asking to be received.    If your letter is to a man, you mail it to his house, unless the letter is  a business one. In the latter case you go to his office, and send in your  card and the letter. Meanwhile you wait in the reception room until he has  read the letter and sends for you to come into his private office.    If you are a woman, you mail your letter of social introduction and do  nothing further until you receive an acknowledgment. If the recipient of  your letter leaves her card on you, you in return leave yours on her. But  the obligation of a written introduction is such that only illness can  excuse her not asking you to her house--either formally or informally.    When a man receives a letter introducing another man, he calls the person  introduced on the telephone and asks how he may be of service to him. If  he does not invite the newcomer to his house, he may put him up at his  club, or have him take luncheon or dinner at a restaurant, as the  circumstances seem to warrant.          CHAPTER III    GREETINGS      =WHAT TO SAY WHEN INTRODUCED=    As explained in the foregoing chapter, the correct formal greeting is:  \"How do you do?\" If Mrs. Younger is presented to Mrs. Worldly, Mrs.  Worldly says \"How do you do?\" If the Ambassador of France is presented to  her, she says \"How do you do?\" Mrs. Younger and the Ambassador likewise  say \"How do you do?\" or merely bow.    There are a few expressions possible under other circumstances and upon  other occasions. If you have, through friends in common, long heard of a  certain lady, or gentleman, and you know that she, or he, also has heard  much of you, you may say when you are introduced to her: \"I am very glad  to meet you,\" or \"I am delighted to meet you at last!\" Do not use the  expression \"pleased to meet you\" then or on any occasion. And you must not  say you are delighted unless you have reason to be sure that she also is  delighted to meet you.    To one who has volunteered to help you in charitable work for instance,  you would say: \"It is very good of you to help us,\" or, \"to join us.\"    In business a gentleman says: \"Very glad to meet you,\" or \"Delighted to  meet you.\" Or, if in his own office: \"Very glad to see you!\"      =INFORMAL GREETINGS=    Informal greetings are almost as limited as formal, but not quite; for  besides saying \"How do you do?\" you can say \"Good morning\" and on  occasions \"How are you?\" or \"Good evening.\"    On very informal occasions, it is the present fashion to greet an intimate  friend with \"Hello!\" This seemingly vulgar salutation is made acceptable  by the tone in which it is said. To shout \"Hul_low_!\" is vulgar, but  \"Hello, Mary\" or \"How 'do John,\" each spoken in an ordinary tone of voice,  sound much the same. But remember that the \"Hello\" is spoken, not called  out, and never used except between intimate friends who call each other by  the first name.    There are only two forms of farewell: \"Good-by\" and \"Good night.\" Never  say \"Au revoir\" unless you have been talking French, or are speaking to a  French person. Never interlard your conversation with foreign words or  phrases when you can possibly translate them into English; and the  occasions when our mother tongue will not serve are extremely rare.    Very often in place of the over-worn \"How do you do,\" perhaps more often  than not, people skip the words of actual greeting and plunge instead into  conversation: \"Why, Mary! When did you get back?\" or \"What is the news  with you?\" or \"What have you been doing lately?\" The weather, too, fills  in with equal faithfulness. \"Isn't it a heavenly day!\" or \"Horrid weather,  isn't it?\" It would seem that the variability of the weather was purposely  devised to furnish mankind with unfailing material for conversation.    In bidding good-by to a new acquaintance with whom you have been talking,  you shake hands and say, \"Good-by. I am very glad to have met you.\" To one  who has been especially interesting, or who is somewhat of a personage you  say: \"It has been a great pleasure to meet you.\" The other answers: \"Thank  you.\"      =IN CHURCH=    People do not greet each other in church, except at a wedding. At weddings  people do speak to friends sitting near them, but in a low tone of voice.  It would be shocking to enter a church and hear a babel of voices!    Ordinarily in church if a friend happens to catch your eye, you smile, but  never actually bow. If you go to a church not your own and a stranger  offers you a seat in her pew, you should, on leaving, turn to her and  say: \"Thank you.\" But you do not greet anyone until you are out on the  church steps, when you naturally speak to your friends. \"Hello\" should not  be said on this occasion because it is too \"familiar\" for the solemnity of  church surroundings.      =SHAKING HANDS=    Gentlemen always shake hands when they are introduced to each other.  Ladies rarely do so with gentlemen who are introduced to them; but they  usually shake hands with other ladies, if they are standing near together.  All people who know each other, unless merely passing by, shake hands when  they meet.    A gentleman on the street never shakes hands with a lady without first  removing his right glove. But at the opera, or at a ball, or if he is  usher at a wedding, he keeps his glove on.      =PERSONALITY OF A HANDSHAKE=    A handshake often creates a feeling of liking or of irritation between two  strangers. Who does not dislike a \"boneless\" hand extended as though it  were a spray of sea-weed, or a miniature boiled pudding? It is equally  annoying to have one's hand clutched aloft in grotesque affectation and  shaken violently sideways, as though it were being used to clean a spot  out of the atmosphere. What woman does not wince at the viselike grasp  that cuts her rings into her flesh and temporarily paralyzes every finger?    The proper handshake is made briefly; but there should be a feeling of  strength and warmth in the clasp, and, as in bowing, one should at the  same time look into the countenance of the person whose hand one takes. In  giving her hand to a foreigner, a married woman always relaxes her arm and  fingers, as it is customary for him to lift her hand to his lips. But by a  relaxed hand is not meant a wet rag; a hand should have life even though  it be passive. A woman should always allow a man who is only an  acquaintance to shake her hand; she should never shake his. To a very old  friend she gives a much firmer clasp, but he shakes her hand more than she  shakes his. Younger women usually shake the hand of the older; or they  both merely clasp hands, give them a dropping movement rather than a  shake, and let go.      =POLITE GREETINGS FROM YOUNGER TO OLDER=    It is the height of rudeness for young people not to go and shake hands  with an older lady of their acquaintance when they meet her away from  home, if she is a hostess to whose house they have often gone. It is not  at all necessary for either young women or young men to linger and enter  into a conversation, unless the older lady detains them, which she should  not do beyond the briefest minute.    Older ladies who are always dragging young men up to unprepossessing  partners, are studiously avoided and with reason; but otherwise it is  inexcusable for any youth to fail in this small exaction of polite  behavior. If a young man is talking with some one when an older lady  enters the room, he bows formally from where he is, as it would be rude to  leave a young girl standing alone while he went up to speak to Mrs.  Worldly or Mrs. Toplofty. But a young girl passing near an older lady can  easily stop for a moment, say \"How do you do, Mrs. Jones!\" and pass on.    People do not cross a room to speak to any one unless--to show politeness  to an acquaintance who is a stranger there; to speak to an intimate  friend; or to talk to some one about something in particular.          CHAPTER IV    SALUTATIONS OF COURTESY      =WHEN A GENTLEMAN TAKES OFF HIS HAT=    A gentleman takes off his hat and holds it in his hand when a lady enters  the elevator in which he is a passenger, but he puts it on again in the  corridor. A public corridor is like the street, but an elevator is  suggestive of a room, and a gentleman does not keep his hat on in the  presence of ladies in a house.    This is the rule in elevators in hotels, clubs and apartments. In office  buildings and stores the elevator is considered as public a place as the  corridor. What is more, the elevators in such business structures are  usually so crowded that the only room for a man's hat is on his head. But  even under these conditions a gentleman can reveal his innate respect for  women by not permitting himself to be crowded too near to them.    When a gentleman stops to speak to a lady of his acquaintance in the  street, he takes his hat off with his left hand, leaving his right free to  shake hands, or he takes it off with his right and transfers it to his  left. If he has a stick, he puts his stick in his left hand, takes off his  hat with his right, transfers his hat also to his left hand, and gives her  his right. If they walk ahead together, he at once puts his hat on; but  while he is standing in the street talking to her, he should remain  hatless. There is no rudeness greater than for him to stand talking to a  lady with his hat on, and a cigar or cigarette in his mouth.    A gentleman always rises when a lady comes into a room. In public places  men do not jump up for every strange woman who happens to approach. But if  any woman addresses a remark to him, a gentleman at once rises to his  feet as he answers her.
