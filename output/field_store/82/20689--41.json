Nevertheless, what is now  found of them still excites astonishment, and inspires a sentiment of  religious admiration for a civilization that could create monuments so  stupendous; impress on them a character of so much grandeur; and give  them a solidity which has prereserved the most important parts until  our days, through twenty-two centuries, and all the revolutions  by which Persia has been devastated. The pillars are covered with  European names deeply cut in the stone. English are far the most  numerous. Very few, however, are of celebrated travelers. We observed,  with satisfaction, those of Sir John Malcolm and Mr. Morier, both of  whom have so successfully treated Persian subjects.\"           *       *       *       *       *    EMILE GIRARDIN states in his journal that he paid for the eleven  volumes of Chateaubriand's Posthumous Memoirs as they appeared,  piecemeal, in his _feuilleton_, the sum of ninety-seven thousand  one hundred and eight francs. They occupied a hundred and ninety-two  _feuilletons_, and cost him thus more than a franc a line. Alfred de  Broglie has made these memoirs the test of a paper entitled \"Memoirs  de Chateaubriand, a Moral and Political Study,\" in the _Revue des Deux  Mondes_. It is a severe analysis of the book and the man. He concludes  that Chateaubriand was one of the most vainglorious, selfish and  malignant of his tribe. He, indeed, betrayed himself broadly, but  surviving writers, who knew intimately his private life--such as St.  Beuve--have disclosed more of his habitual libertinism. The Radical  journals, and some of the Legitimists, turn to account the portraits  left in these memoirs of Louis Philippe, Thiers, Guizot, and other  statesmen of the Orleans monarchy. They are effusions of personal and  political spite. Chateaubriand hated the whole Orleans dynasty, and  has not spared the elder Bourbons.           *       *       *       *       *    GUIZOT has been for thirty years in political life, many of them  a minister, and was long at the head of the government of Louis  Philippe, but is now a poor man. Recently, on the marriage of his  two daughters with two brothers De Witt, the descendants of the great  Hollander, he was unable to give them a cent in the way of marriage  portions. This fact proves the personal integrity of the man more  than a score of arguments. Not only has the native honesty of his  character forbidden him to take advantage of his eminent position  to gain a fortune, but the indomitable pride which is his leading  characteristic, has never stooped to the attractions of public plunder  or the fruits of official speculation. Guizot is not up to the times,  and hence his downfall, but future historians will do justice alike to  his great talents and the uprightness of his intentions.           *       *       *       *       *    One of the best works yet produced on the History of Art, is by  Schnaase, of Duesseldorf. The first three volumes have been published  and translated into French and English, and have met with great  success in both those languages. The fourth volume is just announced  in Germany. Artists and other competent persons at Duesseldorf who  have seen the proof-sheets, speak in the highest terms not only of its  historical merits, but of the excellence of its criticisms.           *       *       *       *       *    The fifth volume of the _History of Spain_, by Rousseau St. Hilaire,  includes the period from 1336 to 1649. The professor has been employed  ten years on his enterprise; he is lauded by all the critics for his  research, method, and style. We have recently spoken of this work at  some length in _The International_. The PARIS ACADEMY OF INSCRIPTIONS  and Belles Lettres is constantly sending forth the most valuable  contributions; to the history of the middle ages especially. It is  now completing the publication of the sixth volume of the Charters,  Diplomas, and other documents relating to French History. This volume,  which was prepared by M. Pardessus, includes the period from the  beginning of 1220 to the end of 1270, and comprehends the reign of St.  Louis. The seventh volume, coming down some fifty years later, is also  nearly ready for the printer. Its editor is M. Laboulaye. The first  volume of the Oriental Historians of the Crusaders, translated into  French, is now going through the press, and the second is in course  of preparation. The greater part of the first volume of the Greek  Historians of the same chivalrous wars is also printed, and the work  is going rapidly forward. The Academy is also preparing a collection  of Occidental History on the same subject. When these three  collections are published, all the documents of any value relating  to the Crusades will be easily accessible, whether for the use of the  historian or the romancer. The Academy is also now engaged in getting  out the twenty-first volume of the History of the Gauls and of France,  and the nineteenth of the Literary History of France, which brings the  annals of French letters down to the thirteenth century. It is also  publishing the sixteenth volume of its own memoirs, which contains the  history of the Academy for the last four years, and the work of Freret  on Geography, besides several other works of less interest. From  all this some idea may be formed of the labors and usefulness of the  institution.           *       *       *       *       *    M. LEVERRIER, the astronomer, has published a long and able argument  in support of the free and universal use of the electric telegraph.  He has supplied a most instructive and interesting exposition of the  employment and utility of the invention, in all the countries in which  it has been established. The American and the several European tariffs  of charge are appended. He explains the different systems, scientific  and practical, in detail, and gives the process and proceeds. He  observes that the practicability of laying the wires _under_ ground  along all the great roads of France, which will protect them from  accidents and mischief, will yield immense advantage to the Government  and to individuals. He appears to prefer Bain's Telegraph, for  communication, to any other, and minutely traces and develops its  mechanism. A bill before the French chambers, which he advocates,  opens to the public the use of the telegraph, but with various  restrictions calculated to prevent _revolutionary_ or seditious  abuses; to prevent illicit speculations in the public funds, and  other bad purposes to which a free conveyance might be applied. The  director of the telegraph is to be empowered to refuse to transmit  what he shall deem repugnant to public order and good morals, and the  government to suspend at will all private correspondence, on one or  many lines.           *       *       *       *       *    THE WORKS OF REV. LEONARD WOODS, D.D., lately Professor of Theology in  the Congregational Seminary of Andover, are in course of publication,  and the third and fourth volumes have just appeared, completing the  theological lectures of the venerable Professor, making in all one  hundred and twenty-eight. In these, the student is furnished with  a complete body of divinity as generally received by the orthodox  denominations in New England, and has presented in a clear, condensed  manner, the matured results of a long life of thought and study  devoted to these subjects.    The fourth volume is occupied with theological letters. The first  121 pages contain those to Unitarians; next follows the Reply to  Dr. Ware's Letters to Unitarians and Calvinists, and Remarks on Dr.  Ware's Answer, a series remarkable for courtesy and kindness toward  opponents, and clearness and faithfulness in the expression of what  was regarded as truth. Following these, are eight letters to Dr.  Taylor of New Haven; An Examination of the Doctrine of Perfection,  as held by Mr. Mahan and others, and a letter to Mr. Mahan; A  Dissertation on Miracles, and the Course of Theological Study as  pursued at the Seminary at Andover. One more volume will complete the  works of this long active and eminent divine.           *       *       *       *       *    THE REV. ORVILLE DEWEY, D.D., we learn from the correspondence of the  _Christian Inquirer_, is living upon the farm where he was born, in  Sheffield, Massachusetts, having, in the successive improvements of  many years, converted the original house into an irregular but most  comfortable and pleasant dwelling. The view from the back piazza is  as fine as can be commanded anywhere in Berkshire, and should the  shifting channel of the Housatonic only be accommodating enough to  wind a little nearer the house, or even suffer some not impossible  stoppage which would convert the marshy meadow in front into a lake,  nothing can be conceived of which could then improve the situation. In  this lovely retirement, Dr. Dewey endeavors to unite labor and study;  working with his own hands, with hoe and rake, in a way to surprise  those who only know how he can handle a pen. He is preparing, in a  leisurely way, for a course of Lectures for the Lowell Institute, upon  a theme admirably suited to his previous studies, and in which it is  evident his whole mind and heart are bound up. We are glad to know  that it is not until winter after next that this work must be taken  from the anvil.           *       *       *       *       *    DR. HOOKER, we learn, has again proceeded to a new and unexplored  region in India, in the prosecution of his important botanical labors.  THE AUTHOR OF THE AMBER WITCH, the Pomeranian pastor, Meinhold,  has been condemned to three months' imprisonment, and a fine of one  hundred thalers, besides costs, for slander against another clergyman  named Stosch, in a communication published in the _New Prussian"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13797"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science - Volume 1, No. (#6)"],[1,"by themselves. These  tribes have profited greatly by the French conquest; it is estimated  that of the eighty millions of francs which the army in Algeria costs  yearly, from twenty to twenty-five millions remain in the hands of the  Arabs. The Arab sells his corn, dates, horses, sheep, the baskets he  weaves, &c., to the European population, but never buys anything from  them in turn, except it be arms and powder. The rest of his money he  carries home and buries where no one knows but himself, so that, if  he dies suddenly, it is lost. Only the chiefs of the tribe know how to  extort anything of these hidden sums. According to the most moderate  estimates the tribes must have from two to three hundred millions  of French money. The gains which the chiefs draw from this wealth is  considerable; some of them have from a hundred to a hundred and fifty  thousand francs income. They are beginning to build large houses,  and cultivate gardens around them, a disposition which the government  favors, because it is easier to keep tribes in order that are  settled and have dwellings to lose which they cannot take with them.  The publication of the tribute in the _Mobacher_, is, under these  circumstances, of great value for the Arabs, because it enables them,  as it were, to supervise their chiefs, and to refuse to pay exorbitant  taxes laid under pretense of a high tribute. This has increased the  respect generally felt for the paper, though it has not rendered it  more a favorite with the chiefs. The power of these leaders is very  great in the various tribes, having been in most cases hereditary, at  least since the tenth century, and although not always inherited in  direct line, the tribes have never suffered it to pass into the hands  of new families. Hitherto nothing has diminished it; the war rather  gave it new strength, and it is only by means of the chiefs that the  French can keep Algiers quiet. It would be a remarkable fact if the  dissolving power of publicity through the press should be manifested  here as elsewhere, and begin the overthrow of the long standing  influence exercised by the great Arabian families.           *       *       *       *       *    MRS. M. ST. LEON LOUD, of Philadelphia, has in the press of Ticknor,  Reed & Fields, of Boston, a collection of her poems, entitled,  \"Wayside Flowers.\" Mrs. Loud is a writer of much grace and elegance,  and occasionally of a rich and delicate fancy. The late Mr. Poe was  accustomed to praise her works very highly, and was to have edited  this edition of them.           *       *       *       *       *    THE LITERATURE OF SOCIALISM occupies the press in France. The subject  is warmly debated, _pro_ and _con_. In a pamphlet called _Despotisme  ou Socialisme_, M. Pompery rapidly sketches the alternative which, he  says, lies open to those who rise against despotism. There are but two  religious doctrines according to him: the one absolutist, represented  by De Maistre, and the Catholic school, which is, logically enough,  desirous of reestablishing the Inquisition; the other professed by all  the illustrious teachers of mankind, by Pythagoras, Jesus, Socrates,  Pascal, &c., which, believing in the goodness of the Creator and the  perfectibility of man, endeavors to found upon earth the reign of  justice, fraternity, and equality. A more important work on Socialism  is that of Dr. Guepin, of Nantes, _Philosophie du Socialisme_; and M.  Lecouturier announces a _Science du Socialisme_.           *       *       *       *       *    MR. G.P.R. JAMES has taken a cottage at Jamaica, Long Island, and  is domiciliated as an American--we hope for a long time. He has made  troops of friends since his arrival here, and is likely to be as  popular in society as he has long been in literature. We are sure  we communicate a very pleasing fact when we state that it is his  intention to give in two or three of our principal cities, during the  autumn and fall, a series of lectures--probably upon the chivalric  ages, with which no one is more profoundly familiar, and of which  no one can discourse more wisely or agreeably. His abilities, his  reputation, and the almost universal acquaintance with his works,  insure for him the largest success. We are indebted to no other living  author for so much enjoyment, and by his proposed lectures he will not  only add to our obligations, but furnish an opportunity to repair  in some degree the wrong he has suffered from the imperfection and  injustice of our copyright system.           *       *       *       *       *    \"THE LIFE, CHARACTER, AND GENIUS OF EBENEZER ELLIOTT,\" is a volume  by January Searle, author of _Leaves from Sherwood Forest_, &c., who  knew the corn-law rhymer well, and has been enabled to give very  characteristic sketches, original descriptions, correspondence, &c.  There are in it many judiciously selected specimens of Elliott's  poems, prose productions, and lectures. Mr. Searle observes of him,  that \"he was cradled into poetry by human wrong and misery; and was  emphatically the bard of poverty--singing of the poor man's loves and  sorrows, and denouncing his oppressors.\" Again: \"He has one central  idea--terrible and awful in its aspect, although beautiful and  beneficent in spirit--before which he tries all causes, and men, and  things. It is the Eternal Idea of Right; his synonyme of God. And this  idea is perpetually present in his mind, pervades all his thoughts,  will not be shuffled nor cheated, but demands a full satisfaction from  all violators of it.\"           *       *       *       *       *    THE LATE MRS. OSGOOD was in a very remarkable degree respected and  beloved by those who were admitted to her acquaintance. Without envy  or jealousy, or any of the immoralities of the intellect which most  commonly beset writers of her sex, she occasioned no enmities and was  a party to none, but was regarded, especially by the literary women  of this country, with a feeling of tenderness and devotion probably  unparalleled in the annals of literature or of society. Immediately  after her death, therefore, a desire was manifested to illustrate  the common regard for her by some suitable testimonial, and upon  consultation, it was decided to publish a splendid souvenir, to  consist of the gratuitous contributions of her friends, and with the  profits accruing from its sale to erect a monument to her memory in  the cemetery of Mount Auburn. This gift book, edited by Mrs. Osgood's  most intimate friend, Mary E. Hewitt, will be published by Mr. Putnam,  on the first of October, under the title of _The Cairn_, and it will  contain original articles by George Aubrey, Lord Bishop of Jamaica:  the Right Rev. George W. Doane, the Right Rev. Alonzo Potter, the  Hon. R.H. Walworth, the Hon. J. Leander Starr, the Rev. C.S. Henry,  D.D., G.P.R. James, Esq., N.P. Willis, Esq., W. Gilmore Simms, Esq.,  Bayard Taylor, Esq., J.H. Boker, Esq., Alfred B. Street, Esq., R.  H. Stoddard, Esq., Miss Fredrika Bremer, Mrs. Sigourney, Mrs. Oakes  Smith, Mrs. Embury, Mrs. Lewis, Mrs. Neal, Mrs. Willard, Mrs. Whitman,  Miss Lynch, Miss Hunter, Miss Cheesebro', and indeed nearly all the  writers of her sex who have attained any eminence in our literary  world. The volume will be illustrated with nine engravings on steel,  by Cheney and other eminent artists.           *       *       *       *       *    THE REV. WALTER COLTON has just published through A.S. Barnes & Co.  \"Three Years in California,\" a journal of experiences and observations  in the gold region, from the period when it first attracted the  attention of the Atlantic cities. Mr. Colton was some time alcade  of Monterey, and he had in every way abundant opportunity to acquire  whatever facts are deserving of preservation in history. His \"Ship  and Shore,\" \"Constantinople and Athens,\" \"Deck and Port,\" and other  works, have illustrated his genial temper, shrewdness, and skill in  description and character writing; and this book will increase his  reputation for these qualities. It contains portraits of Capt. Sutter,  Col. Fremont, Mr. Gwin, Mr. Wright, Mr. Larkin, and Mr. Snyder, a map  of the valley of the Sacramento, and several other engravings, very  spirited in design and execution.           *       *       *       *       *    MR. GEORGE STEPHENS, author of the \"_Manuscripts of Erdely_,\" has  been struck by ill health and reduced to poverty, and an amateur play  has been prepared for his benefit at the Soho Theater. He wrote \"The  Vampire,\" \"Montezuma,\" and \"Martinuzzi.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Gallery of Illustrious Americans, conducted by Mr. Lester,  continues with every number to increase in interest. The work is  designed to embrace folio portraits, engraved by Davignon, from  daguerreotypes by Brady, of twenty-four of the most eminent American  citizens who have lived since the time of Washington. The portraits  thus far have been admirable for truthfulness and artistic effect. It  may be said that the _only_ published pictures we have, deserving to  be called portraits, of the historian Prescott, or Mr. Calhoun, or  Colonel Fremont, are in this Gallery. The great artist, naturalist,  and man of letters, Audubon, is reflected here as he appears at the  close of the battle, receiving the reverence of nations and ages.  In the biographical department Mr. Lester has evinced very eminent  abilities for this kind of writing. He seizes the prominent events  of history and the strong points of character, and presents them  with such force and fullness, and happy combination, as to make the  letter-press as interesting and valuable as the engraved portion  of the work. We are pleased to learn that the Gallery is remarkably  successful. No publication of equal splendor and expensiveness has  ever before been so well received in this country. The cost of it  is but one dollar per number, or twenty dollars for the series "]]]
