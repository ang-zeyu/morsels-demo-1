You also, O my reader, give not yourself up to curiosity. Consider of  how many it is the bane. Would you to gratify this tear away the  mystery from the Milkmen's Hall and wrong the Ancient Company of  Milkmen? Would they if all the world knew it and it became a common  thing to tell that tale any more that they have told for the last four  hundred years? Rather a silence would settle upon their hall and a  universal regret for the ancient tale and the ancient winter evenings.  And though curiosity were a proper consideration yet even then this is  not the proper place nor this the proper occasion for the Tale. For  the proper place is only the Milkmen's Hall and the proper occasion  only when logs burn well and when wine has been deeply drunken, then  when the candles were burning well in long rows down to the dimness,  down to the darkness and mystery that lie at the end of the hall, then  were you one of the Company, and were I one of the five, would I rise  from my seat by the fireside and tell you with all the embellishments  that it has gleaned from the ages that story that is the heirloom of  the milkmen. And the long candles would burn lower and lower and  gutter and gutter away till they liquefied in their sockets, and  draughts would blow from the shadowy end of the hall stronger and  stronger till the shadows came after them, and still I would hold you  with that treasured story, not by any wit of mine but all for the sake  of its glamour and the times out of which it came; one by one the  candles would flare and die and, when all were gone, by the light of  ominous sparks when each milkman's face looks fearful to his fellow,  you would know, as now you cannot, why the milkman shudders when he  perceives the dawn.            The Bad Old Woman in Black    The bad old woman in black ran down the street of the ox-butchers.    Windows at once were opened high up in those crazy gables; heads were  thrust out: it was she. Then there arose the counsel of anxious  voices, calling sideways from window to window or across to opposite  houses. Why was she there with her sequins and bugles and old black  gown? Why had she left her dreaded house? On what fell errand she  hasted?    They watched her lean, lithe figure, and the wind in that old black  dress, and soon she was gone from the cobbled street and under the  town's high gateway. She turned at once to her right and was hid from  the view of the houses. Then they all ran down to their doors, and  small groups formed on the pavement; there they took counsel together,  the eldest speaking first. Of what they had seen they said nothing,  for there was no doubt it was she; it was of the future they spoke,  and the future only.    In what notorious thing would her errand end? What gains had tempted  her out from her fearful home? What brilliant but sinful scheme had  her genius planned? Above all, what future evil did this portend? Thus  at first it was only questions. And then the old grey-beards spoke,  each one to a little group; they had seen her out before, had known  her when she was younger, and had noted the evil things that had  followed her goings: the small groups listened well to their low and  earnest voices. No one asked questions now or guessed at her infamous  errand, but listened only to the wise old men who knew the things that  had been, and who told the younger men of the dooms that had come  before.    Nobody knew how many times she had left her dreaded house; but the  oldest recounted all the times that they knew, and the way she had  gone each time, and the doom that had followed her going; and two  could remember the earthquake that there was in the street of the  shearers.    So were there many tales of the times that were, told on the pavement  near the old green doors by the edge of the cobbled street, and the  experience that the aged men had bought with their white hairs might  be had cheap by the young. But from all their experience only this was  clear, that never twice in their lives had she done the same infamous  thing, and that the same calamity twice had never followed her goings.  Therefore it seemed that means were doubtful and few for finding out  what thing was about to befall; and an ominous feeling of gloom came  down on the street of the ox-butchers. And in the gloom grew fears of  the very worst. This comfort they only had when they put their fear  into words--that the doom that followed her goings had never yet been  anticipated. One feared that with magic she meant to move the moon;  and he would have dammed the high tide on the neighbouring coast,  knowing that as the moon attracted the sea the sea must attract the  moon, and hoping by his device to humble her spells. Another would  have fetched iron bars and clamped them across the street, remembering  the earthquake there was in the street of the shearers. Another would  have honoured his household gods, the little cat-faced idols seated  above his hearth, gods to whom magic was no unusual thing, and, having  paid their fees and honoured them well, would have put the whole case  before them. His scheme found favour with many, and yet at last was  rejected, for others ran indoors and brought out their gods, too, to  be honoured, till there was a herd of gods all seated there on the  pavement; yet would they have honoured them and put their case before  them but that a fat man ran up last of all, carefully holding under a  reverent arm his own two hound-faced gods, though he knew well--as,  indeed, all men must--that they were notoriously at war with the  little cat-faced idols. And although the animosities natural to faith  had all been lulled by the crisis, yet a look of anger had come into  the cat-like faces that no one dared disregard, and all perceived that  if they stayed a moment longer there would be flaming around them the  jealousy of the gods; so each man hastily took his idols home, leaving  the fat man insisting that his hound-faced gods should be honoured.    Then there were schemes again and voices raised in debate, and many  new dangers feared and new plans made.    But in the end they made no defence against danger, for they knew not  what it would be, but wrote upon parchment as a warning, and in order  that all might know: \"_The bad old woman in black ran down the street  of the ox-butchers._\"            The Bird of the Difficult Eye    Observant men and women that know their Bond Street well will  appreciate my astonishment when in a jewellers' shop I perceived that  nobody was furtively watching me. Not only this but when I even picked  up a little carved crystal to examine it no shop-assistants crowded  round me. I walked the whole length of the shop, still no one politely  followed.    Seeing from this that some extraordinary revolution had occurred in  the jewelry business I went with my curiosity well aroused to a queer  old person half demon and half man who has an idol-shop in a byway of  the City and who keeps me informed of affairs at the Edge of the  World. And briefly over a pinch of heather incense that he takes by  way of snuff he gave me this tremendous information: that Mr. Neepy  Thang the son of Thangobrind had returned from the Edge of the World  and was even now in London.    The information may not appear tremendous to those unacquainted with  the source of jewelry; but when I say that the only thief employed by  any West-end jeweller since famous Thangobrind's distressing doom is  this same Neepy Thang, and that for lightness of fingers and swiftness  of stockinged foot they have none better in Paris, it will be  understood why the Bond Street jewellers no longer cared what became  of their old stock.    There were big diamonds in London that summer and a few considerable  sapphires. In certain astounding kingdoms behind the East strange  sovereigns missed from their turbans the heirlooms of ancient wars,  and here and there the keepers of crown jewels who had not heard the  stockinged feet of Thang, were questioned and died slowly.    And the jewellers gave a little dinner to Thang at the Hotel Great  Magnificent; the windows had not been opened for five years and there  was wine at a guinea a bottle that you could not tell from champagne  and cigars at half a crown with a Havana label. Altogether it was a  splendid evening for Thang.    But I have to tell of a far sadder thing than a dinner at a hotel. The  public require jewelry and jewelry must be obtained. I have to tell of  Neepy Thang's last journey.    That year the fashion was emeralds. A man named Green had recently  crossed the Channel on a bicycle and the jewellers said that a green  stone would be particularly appropriate to commemorate the event and  recommended emeralds.    Now a certain money-lender of Cheapside who had just been made a peer  had divided his gains into three equal parts; one for the purchase of  the peerage, country house and park, and the twenty thousand pheasants  that are absolutely essential, and one for the upkeep of the position,  while the third he banked abroad, partly to cheat the native  tax-gatherer and partly because it seemed to him that the days of the  Peerage were few and that he might at any moment be called upon to  start afresh elsewhere. In the upkeep of the position he included  jewelry for his wife and so it came about that Lord Castlenorman  placed an order with two well-known Bond-street jewellers named  Messrs. Grosvenor and Campbell to the extent of L100,000 for a few  reliable emeralds.    But the emeralds in stock were mostly small and shop-soiled and Neepy  Thang had to set out at once before he had had as much as a week in  London. I will briefly sketch his project."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13831"],[0,"Evolution Of The Japanese, Social And Psychic (#6)"],[1,"man is his personality. The goal of that evolution  is developed personality. Personality is thus at once the cause and  the end of social progress. The conditions which affect or determine  progress are those which affect or determine personality.    The biological evolution of man from the animal has been, it is true,  frankly assumed in this work. No attempt is made to justify this  assumption. Let not the reader infer, however, that the writer  similarly assumes the adequacy of the so-called naturalistic or  evolutionary origin of ethics, of religion, or even of social  progress. It may be doubted whether Darwin, Wallace, Le Conte, or any  exponent of biological evolution has yet given a complete statement of  the factors of the physiological evolution of man. It is certain,  however, that ethical, religious, and social writers who have striven  to account for the higher evolution of man, by appealing to factors  exclusively parallel to those which have produced the physiological  evolution of man, have conspicuously failed. However much we may find  to praise in the social interpretations of such eminent writers as  Comte, Spencer, Ward, Fiske, Giddings, Kidd, Southerland, or even  Drummond, there still remains the necessity of a fuller consideration  of the moral and religious evolution of man. The higher evolution of  man cannot be adequately expressed or even understood in any terms  lower than those of personality.          EVOLUTION OF THE JAPANESE    I    PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS      Said a well educated and widely read Englishman to the writer while in  Oxford, \"Can you explain to me how it is that the Japanese have  succeeded in jumping out of their skins?\" And an equally thoughtful  American, speaking about the recent strides in civilization made by  Japan, urged that this progress could not be real and genuine. \"How  can such a mushroom-growth, necessarily without deep roots in the  past, be real and strong and permanent? How can it escape being  chiefly superficial?\" These two men are typical of much of the thought  of the West in regard to Japan.    Seldom, perhaps never, has the civilized world so suddenly and  completely reversed an estimate of a nation as it has that with  reference to Japan. Before the recent war, to the majority even of  fairly educated men, Japan was little more than a name for a few small  islands somewhere near China, whose people were peculiar and  interesting. To-day there is probably not a man, or woman, or child  attending school in any part of the civilized world, who does not know  the main facts about the recent war: how the small country and the men  of small stature, sarcastically described by their foes as \"Wojen,\"  pygmy, attacked the army and navy of a country ten times their size.    Such a universal change of opinion regarding a nation, especially  regarding one so remote from the centers of Western civilization as  Japan, could not have taken place in any previous generation. The  telegraph, the daily paper, the intelligent reporters and writers of  books and magazine articles, the rapid steam travel and the many  travelers--all these have made possible this sudden acquisition of  knowledge and startling reversal of opinion.    There is reason, however, to think that much misapprehension and real  ignorance still exists about Japan and her leap into power and  world-wide prestige. Many seem to think that Japan has entered on her  new career through the abandonment of her old civilization and the  adoption of one from the West--that the victories on sea and land, in  Korea, at Port Arthur, and a Wei-hai-wei, and more recently at  Tientsin and Pekin, were solely due to her Westernized navy and army.  Such persons freely admit that this process of Westernization had been  going on for many years more rapidly than the world at large knew, and  that consequently the reputation of Japan before the war was not such  as corresponded with her actual attainments. But they assume that  there was nothing of importance in the old civilization; that it was  little superior to organized barbarism.    These people conceive of the change which has taken place in Japan  during the past thirty years as a revolution, not as an evolution; as  an abandonment of the old, and an adoption of the new, civilization.  They conceive the old tree of civilization to have been cut down and  cast into the fire, and a new tree to have been imported from the West  and planted in Japanese soil. New Japan is, from this view-point, the  new tree.    Not many months ago I heard of a wealthy family in Kyoto which did not  take kindly to the so-called improvements imported from abroad, and  which consequently persisted in using the instruments of the older  civilization. Even such a convenience as the kerosene lamp, now  universally adopted throughout the land of the Rising Sun, this family  refused to admit into its home, preferring the old-style andon with  its vegetable oil, dim light, and flickering flame. Recently, however,  an electric-light company was organized in that city, and this  brilliant illuminant was introduced not only into the streets and  stores, but into many private houses. Shortly after its introduction,  the family was converted to the superiority of the new method of  illumination, and passed at one leap from the old-style lantern to the  latest product of the nineteenth century. This incident is considered  typical of the transformations characteristic of modern Japan. It is  supposed that New Japan is in no proper sense the legitimate product  through evolution of Old Japan.    In important ways, therefore, Japan seems to be contradicting our  theories of national growth. We have thought that no \"heathen\" nation  could possibly gain, much less wield, unaided by Westerners, the  forces of civilized Christendom. We have likewise held that national  growth is a slow process, a gradual evolution, extending over scores  and centuries of years. In both respects our theories seem to be at  fault. This \"little nation of little people,\" which we have been so  ready to condemn as \"heathen\" and \"uncivilized,\" and thus to despise,  or to ignore, has in a single generation leaped into the forefront of  the world's attention.    Are our theories wrong? Is Japan an exception? Are our facts correct?  We instinctively feel that something is at fault. We are not satisfied  with the usual explanation of the recent history of Japan. We are  perhaps ready to concede that \"the rejection of the old and the  adoption of Western civilization\" is the best statement whereby to  account for the new power of Japan and her new position among the  nations, but when we stop to think, we ask whether we have thus  explained that for which we are seeking an explanation? Do not the  questions still remain--Why did the Japanese so suddenly abandon  Oriental for Occidental civilization? And what mental and other traits  enabled a people who, according to the supposition, were far from  civilized, so suddenly to grasp and wield a civilization quite alien  in character and superior to their own; a civilization ripened after  millenniums of development of the Aryan race? And how far, as a matter  of fact, has this assimilation gone? Not until these questions are  really answered has the explanation been found, So that, after all,  the prime cause which we must seek is not to be found in the external  environment, but rather in the internal endowment.    An effort to understand the ancient history of Japan encounters the  same problem as that raised by her modern history. What mental  characteristics led the Japanese a thousand years ago so to absorb the  Chinese civilization, philosophy, and language that their own suffered  a permanent arrest? What religious traits led them so to take on a  religion from China and India that their own native religion never  passed beyond the most primitive development, either in doctrine, in  ethics, in ritual, or in organization? On the other hand, what mental  characteristics enabled them to preserve their national independence  and so to modify everything brought from abroad, from the words of the  new language to the philosophy of the new religions, that Japanese  civilization, language, and religion are markedly distinct from the  Chinese? Why is it that, though the Japanese so fell under the bondage  of the Chinese language as permanently to enslave and dwarf their own  beautiful tongue, expressing the dominant thought of every sentence  with characters (ideographs) borrowed from China, yet at the same time  so transformed what they borrowed that no Chinaman can read and  understand a Japanese book or newspaper?    The same questions recur at this new period of Japan's national life.  Why has she so easily turned from the customs of centuries? What are  the mental traits that have made her respond so differently from her  neighbor to the environment of the nineteenth-century civilization of  the West Why is it that Japan has sent thousands of her students to  these Western lands to see and study and bring back all that is good  in them, while China has remained in stolid self-satisfaction, seeing  nothing good in the West and its ways? To affirm that the difference  is due to the environment alone is impossible, for the environment  seems to be essentially the same. This difference of attitude and  action must be traced, it would seem, to differences of mental and  temperamental characteristics. Those who seek to understand the  secret of Japan's newly won power and reputation by looking simply at  her newly acquired forms of government, her reconstructed national  social structure, her recently constructed roads and railroads,  telegraphs, representative government, etc., and especially at her  army and navy organized on European models and armed with European  weapons, are not unlike those who would discover the secret of human  life by the study of anatomy.
