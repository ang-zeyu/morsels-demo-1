Whenever  you see a man, who is successful in society, try to discover what makes  him pleasing, and, if possible, adopt his system. You should learn to  fence. For languages, at present, French will be sufficient. You speak it  fairly: try to speak it elegantly. Read French authors. Read  Rouchefoucault. The French writers are the finest in the world, for they  clear our heads of ridiculous ideas. Study precision.    Do not talk too much at present, do not _try_ to talk. But whenever you  speak, speak with self-possession. Speak in a subdued tone, and always  look at the person whom you are addressing. Before one can engage in  general conversation with any effect, there is a certain acquaintance with  trifling, but amusing subjects, which must be first attained. You will  soon pick up sufficient by listening and observing. Never argue. In  society, nothing must be discussed: give only results. If any person  differ with you--bow and turn the conversation. In society, never  think--always be on the watch, or you will miss many opportunities, and  say many disagreeable things.    Talk to women, talk to women as much as you can. This is the best school.  This is the way to gain fluency--because you need not care what you say,  and had better not be sensible. They too will rally you on many points,  and, as they are women, you will not be offended. Nothing is of so much  importance, and of so much use, to a young man entering life, as to be  well criticised by women. It is impossible to get rid of those thousand  bad habits, which we pick up in boyhood, without this supervision.  Unfortunately, you have no sisters. But never be offended if a woman rally  you. Encourage her. Otherwise, you will never be free from your  awkwardness, or any little oddities, and certainly never learn to dress.    You ride pretty well, but you had better go through the manege. Every  gentleman should be a perfect cavalier.    As you are to be at home for so short a time, and for other reasons, I  think it better that you should not have a tutor in the house. Parcel out  your morning, then, for your separate masters. Rise early and regularly,  and read for three hours. Read the Memoirs of the Cardinal de Retz--the  Life of Richelieu--everything about Napoleon,--read works of that kind.  Read no history: nothing but biography, for that is life without theory.  Then fence. Talk an hour with your French master, but do not throw the  burden of the conversation upon him. Give him an account of something.  Describe to him the events of yesterday, or give him a detailed account of  the constitution. You will have then sufficiently rested yourself for your  dancing. And after that ride and amuse yourself as much as you can.  Amusement to an observing mind is study.    I pursued the system which my father had pointed out, with exactness, and  soon with pleasure. I sacredly observed my hours of reading, and devoted  myself to the study of the lives of what my father considered really great  men--that is to say, men of great energies, and violent volition, who look  upon their fellow creatures as mere tools, with which they can build up a  pedestal for their solitary statue, and who sacrifice every feeling which  should sway humanity, and every high work which genius should really  achieve, to the short-sighted gratification of an irrational and  outrageous selfism. As for my manners, I flattered myself that they  advanced in measure with my mind, although I already emulated Napoleon. I  soon overcame the fear which attended my first experiments in society, and  by scrupulously observing the paternal maxims, I soon became very  self-satisfied. I listened to men with a delightful mixture of defference  and self-confidence: were they old, and did I differ with them, I  contented myself by positively stating my opinion in a most subdued voice,  and then either turning the subject, or turning upon my heel. But as for  women, it is astonishing how well I got on. The nervous rapidity of my  first rattle soon subsided into a continuous flow of easy nonsense.  Impertinent and flippant, I was universally hailed an original and a wit.  But the most remarkable incident was, that the baroness and myself became  the greatest friends. I was her constant attendant, and rehearsed to her  flattered ear all my evening performance. She was the person with whom I  practised, and as she had a taste in dress, I encouraged her opinions.  Unconscious that she was at once my lay figure and my mirror, she loaded  me with presents, and announced to all her coterie, that I was the most  delightful young man of her acquaintance.    From all this it may easily be suspected, that at the age of fifteen I had  unexpectedly become one of the most affected, conceited, and intolerable  atoms that ever peopled the sunbeam of society.           *       *       *       *       *      [This gem is from a volume of Songs and other small Poems, by Barry  Cornwall.

Let us glide adown thy stream    Gently,--as we sometimes glide      Through a quiet dream!    Humble voyagers are We,    Husband, wife, and children three--    (One is lost,--an angel, fled    To the azure overhead!)      Touch us gently, Time!      We've not proud nor soaring wings:    _Our_ ambition, _our_ content      Lies in simple things.    Humble voyagers are We,    O'er Life's dim unsounded sea,    Seeking only some calm clime:--    Touch us _gently_, gentle Time!           *       *       *       *       *      THE SPIRIT OF SONG-WRITING.    Song-writing is the most difficult species of poetry; failure is not to be  recovered--one slip ruins the whole attempt. A good song is a little piece  of perfection, and perfection does not grow in every field. There must be  felicity of idea, lightness of tone, exquisiteness or extreme naturalness  and propriety of expression; and this within the compass of a few verses.  And this is not all; the writer must betray a sustained tone of enthusiasm:  the song should have neither beginning nor end,--it must seem a snatch  from out of a continuous strain of melody--something that swells upon the  ear, as if the previous parts had been unheard, and which dies away as if  the air had carried its notes afar, and the sounds were wafted along to  other lands. Men of genius are now and then born song-writers; such were  Horace and Burns, such is Beranger. England has not had hers yet, and  perhaps never may have. Englishmen are not nationally calculated to make  song-writers; but individual genius makes light of running counter to a  whole nation of habits, and there is no saying that we may not have our  true lyricist yet. Song-writing is most likely to spring up among people  greatly susceptible of the charms of music, and inventive of airs which,  by some peculiar charm they possess, spread over all the country, sink  deep in the memory, and come spontaneously on the thoughts in moments of  sadness or joy, and, in short, become what are called national. National  songs go with national airs, and spring up with circumstances. The English  have few native airs, and as few native songs of any excellence. When an  Englishman is in love, does he sing? In camp, what wretched braying goes  by that name! at table, what have we of the generous, jovial sort?  Generally speaking, our table songs--always excepting our glees--are  pieces of bald sentiment, when they are English; but more generally, they  are borrowed from the Scotch, the Irish, and other national song-writers.  Gaiety, and that gaiety showing itself musically, is not _English_: when  we are poetically given, it is in the sad piping strain of the forlorn,  deserted, or hopeless lover. Gaiety is not English: we can be sentimental,  tender, witty, pretty, pompous, and glorious in our songs; but we ever  want the essential quality of gaiety--gaiety of heart--the dancing life of  the spirit, that makes the voice hum, the fingers crack merrily, and the  feet fidget restlessly on the ground.--_Spectator Newspaper_.           *       *       *       *       *      LORD BYRON'S EARLY POEMS.

Adieu, my youthful friends or foes,    Partners of former bliss or woes;      No more through Ida's path we stray;    Soon must I share the gloomy cell,    Whose ever-slumbering inmates dwell      Unconscious of the day.      Adieu, ye hoary Regal Fanes,      Ye spires of Granta's vale,    Where learning robed in sable reigns,      And melancholy pale.    Ye comrades of the jovial hour,    Ye tenants of the classic bower,      On Cama's verdant margin placed,    Adieu! while memory still is mine,    For offerings on oblivion's shrine,      These scenes must be effaced.      Adieu, ye mountains of the clime,      Where grew my youthful years;    Where Loch na Garr in snows sublime      His giant summit rears.    Why did my childhood wander forth    From you, ye regions of the North,      With sons of pride to roam?    Why did I quit my Highland cave,    Marr's dusky heath, and Dee's clear wave,      To seek a Sotheron home?      Hall of my sires! a long farewell;      Yet why to thee adieu?

The citizens are amusing themselves in the  meantime.\"    \"And you--do you really think that anything could be done with these  bourgeois?\"    \"Yes, they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one  body.\"    \"How miserable not to be free!\"    \"Don't be downcast. Since Mazarin has sent for you, it is because he  wants you. I congratulate you! Many a long year has passed since any one  has wanted to employ me; so you see in what a situation I am.\"    \"Make your complaints known; that's my advice.\"    \"Listen, Rochefort; let us make a compact. We are friends, are we not?\"    \"Egad! I bear the traces of our friendship--three slits or slashes from  your sword.\"    \"Well, if you should be restored to favor, don't forget me.\"    \"On the honor of a Rochefort; but you must do the like for me.\"    \"There's my hand,--I promise.\"    \"Therefore, whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my  behalf----\"    \"I shall say it, and you?\"    \"I shall do the same.\"    \"Apropos, are we to speak of your friends also, Athos, Porthos, and  Aramis? or have you forgotten them?\"    \"Almost.\"    \"What has become of them?\"    \"I don't know; we separated, as you know. They are alive, that's all  that I can say about them; from time to time I hear of them indirectly,  but in what part of the world they are, devil take me if I know, No, on  my honor, I have not a friend in the world but you, Rochefort.\"    \"And the illustrious--what's the name of the lad whom I made a sergeant  in Piedmont's regiment?\"    \"Planchet!\"    \"The illustrious Planchet. What has become of him?\"    \"I shouldn't wonder if he were at the head of the mob at this very  moment. He married a woman who keeps a confectioner's shop in the Rue  des Lombards, for he's a lad who was always fond of sweetmeats; he's now  a citizen of Paris. You'll see that that queer fellow will be a sheriff  before I shall be a captain.\"    \"Come, dear D'Artagnan, look up a little! Courage! It is when one is  lowest on the wheel of fortune that the merry-go-round wheels and  rewards us. This evening your destiny begins to change.\"    \"Amen!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan, stopping the carriage.    \"What are you doing?\" asked Rochefort.    \"We are almost there and I want no one to see me getting out of your  carriage; we are supposed not to know each other.\"    \"You are right. Adieu.\"    \"Au revoir. Remember your promise.\"    In five minutes the party entered the courtyard and D'Artagnan led the  prisoner up the great staircase and across the corridor and  ante-chamber.    As they stopped at the door of the cardinal's study, D'Artagnan was  about to be announced when Rochefort slapped him on his shoulder.    \"D'Artagnan, let me confess to you what I've been thinking about during  the whole of my drive, as I looked out upon the parties of citizens who  perpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with  fiery eyes.\"    \"Speak out,\" answered D'Artagnan.    \"I had only to cry out 'Help!' for you and for your companions to be cut  to pieces, and then I should have been free.\"    \"Why didn't you do it?\" asked the lieutenant.    \"Come, come!\" cried Rochefort. \"Did we not swear friendship? Ah! had any  one but you been there, I don't say----\"    D'Artagnan bowed. \"Is it possible that Rochefort has become a better man  than I am?\" he said to himself. And he caused himself to be announced to  the minister.    \"Let M. de Rochefort enter,\" said Mazarin, eagerly, on hearing their  names pronounced; \"and beg M. d'Artagnan to wait; I shall have further  need of him.\"    These words gave great joy to D'Artagnan. As he had said, it had been a  long time since any one had needed him; and that demand for his services  on the part of Mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign.    Rochefort, rendered suspicious and cautious by these words, entered the  apartment, where he found Mazarin sitting at the table, dressed in his  ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the Church, his costume  being similar to that of the abbes in that day, excepting that his scarf  and stockings were violet.    As the door was closed Rochefort cast a glance toward Mazarin, which was  answered by one, equally furtive, from the minister.    There was little change in the cardinal; still dressed with sedulous  care, his hair well arranged and curled, his person perfumed, he looked,  owing to his extreme taste in dress, only half his age. But Rochefort,  who had passed five years in prison, had become old in the lapse of a  few years; the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct  Cardinal Richelieu were now white; the deep bronze of his complexion had  been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility. As he gazed  at him Mazarin shook his head slightly, as much as to say, \"This is a  man who does not appear to me fit for much.\"    After a pause, which appeared an age to Rochefort, Mazarin took from a  bundle of papers a letter, and showing it to the count, he said:    \"I find here a letter in which you sue for liberty, Monsieur de  Rochefort. You are in prison, then?\"    Rochefort trembled in every limb at this question. \"But I thought,\" he  said, \"that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any  one----\"    \"I? Oh no! There is a congestion of prisoners in the Bastile, who were  cooped up in the time of Monsieur de Richelieu; I don't even know their  names.\"    \"Yes, but in regard to myself, my lord, it cannot be so, for I was  removed from the Chatelet to the Bastile owing to an order from your  eminence.\"    \"You think you were.\"    \"I am certain of it.\"    \"Ah, stay! I fancy I remember it. Did you not once refuse to undertake a  journey to Brussels for the queen?\"    \"Ah! ah!\" exclaimed Rochefort. \"There is the true reason! Idiot that I  am, though I have been trying to find it out for five years, I never  found it out.\"    \"But I do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment. I merely ask  you, did you not refuse to go to Brussels for the queen, whilst you had  consented to go there to do some service for the late cardinal?\"    \"That is the very reason I refused to go back to Brussels. I was there  at a fearful moment. I was sent there to intercept a correspondence  between Chalais and the archduke, and even then, when I was discovered I  was nearly torn to pieces. How could I, then, return to Brussels? I  should injure the queen instead of serving her.\"    \"Well, since the best motives are liable to misconstruction, the queen  saw in your refusal nothing but a refusal--a distinct refusal she had  also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal;  yes, her majesty the queen----\"    Rochefort smiled contemptuously.    \"Since I was a faithful servant, my lord, to Cardinal Richelieu during  his life, it stands to reason that now, after his death, I should serve  you well, in defiance of the whole world.\"    \"With regard to myself, Monsieur de Rochefort,\" replied Mazarin, \"I am  not, like Monsieur de Richelieu, all-powerful. I am but a minister, who  wants no servants, being myself nothing but a servant of the queen's.  Now, the queen is of a sensitive nature. Hearing of your refusal to obey  her she looked upon it as a declaration of war, and as she considers you  a man of superior talent, and consequently dangerous, she desired me to  make sure of you; that is the reason of your being shut up in the  Bastile. But your release can be managed. You are one of those men who  can comprehend certain matters and having understood them, can act with  energy----\"    \"Such was Cardinal Richelieu's opinion, my lord.\"    \"The cardinal,\" interrupted Mazarin, \"was a great politician and therein  shone his vast superiority over me. I am a straightforward, simple man;  that's my great disadvantage. I am of a frankness of character quite  French.\"    Rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile.    \"Now to the point. I want friends; I want faithful servants. When I say  I want, I mean the queen wants them. I do nothing without her  commands--pray understand that; not like Monsieur de Richelieu, who went  on just as he pleased. So I shall never be a great man, as he was, but  to compensate for that, I shall be a good man, Monsieur de Rochefort,  and I hope to prove it to you.\"    Rochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice, in which sounded  sometimes a sort of gentle lisp, like the hissing of young vipers.    \"I am disposed to believe your eminence,\" he replied; \"though I have had  but little evidence of that good-nature of which your eminence speaks.  Do not forget that I have been five years in the Bastile and that no  medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison.\"    \"Ah, Monsieur de Rochefort! have I not told you already that I had  nothing to do with that? The queen--cannot you make allowances for the  pettishness of a queen and a princess? But that has passed away as  suddenly as it came, and is forgotten.\"    \"I can easily suppose, sir, that her majesty has forgotten it amid the  fetes and the courtiers of the Palais Royal, but I who have passed those  years in the Bastile----\"    \"Ah! mon Dieu! my dear Monsieur de Rochefort! do you absolutely think  that the Palais Royal is the abode of gayety? No. We have had great  annoyances there. As for me, I play my game squarely, fairly, and above  board, as I always do. Let us come to some conclusion. Are you one of  us, Monsieur de Rochefort?\"    \"I am very desirous of being so, my lord, but I am totally in the dark  about everything. In the Bastile one talks politics only with soldiers  and jailers, and you have not an"]]]
