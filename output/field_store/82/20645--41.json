Were we wholly united, you would feel this sorrow as  little as I should. My journey was terrible. I did not arrive here till  four o'clock yesterday morning, as no horses were to be had. The drivers  chose another route; but what a dreadful one it was! At the last stage I  was warned not to travel through the night, and to beware of a certain  wood, but this only incited me to go forward, and I was wrong. The carriage  broke down, owing to the execrable roads, mere deep rough country lanes,  and had it not been for the postilions I must have been left by the  wayside. Esterhazy, travelling the usual road, had the same fate with eight  horses, whereas I had only four. Still I felt a certain degree of pleasure,  which I invariably do when I have happily surmounted any difficulty. But I  must now pass from the outer to the inner man. We shall, I trust, soon meet  again; to-day I cannot impart to you all the reflections I have made,  during the last few days, on my life; were our hearts closely united  forever, none of these would occur to me. My heart is overflowing with all  I have to say to you. Ah! there are moments when I find that speech is  actually nothing. Take courage! Continue to be ever my true and only love,  my all! as I am yours. The gods must ordain what is further to be and shall  be!    Your faithful    LUDWIG.    Monday Evening, July 6.    You grieve! dearest of all beings! I have just heard that the letters must  be sent off very early. Mondays and Thursdays are the only days when the  post goes to K. from here. You grieve! Ah! where I am, there you are ever  with me; how earnestly shall I strive to pass my life with you, and what a  life will it be!!! Whereas now!! without you!! and persecuted by the  kindness of others, which I neither deserve nor try to deserve! The  servility of man towards his fellow-man pains me, and when I regard myself  as a component part of the universe, what am I, what is he who is called  the greatest?--and yet herein are displayed the godlike feelings of  humanity!--I weep in thinking that you will receive no intelligence from me  till probably Saturday. However dearly you may love me, I love you more  fondly still. Never conceal your feelings from me. Good-night! As a patient  at these baths, I must now go to rest [a few words are here effaced by  Beethoven himself]. Oh, heavens! so near, and yet so far! Is not our love a  truly celestial mansion, but firm as the vault of heaven itself?    July 7.    GOOD-MORNING!    Even before I rise, my thoughts throng to you, my immortal  beloved!--sometimes full of joy, and yet again sad, waiting to see whether  Fate will hear us. I must live either wholly with you, or not at all.  Indeed I have resolved to wander far from you [see No. 13] till the moment  arrives when I can fly into your arms, and feel that they are my home, and  send forth my soul in unison with yours into the realm of spirits. Alas! it  must be so! You will take courage, for you know my fidelity. Never can  another possess my heart--never, never! Oh, heavens! Why must I fly from  her I so fondly love? and yet my existence in W. was as miserable as here.  Your love made me the most happy and yet the most unhappy of men. At my  age, life requires a uniform equality; can this be found in our mutual  relations? My angel! I have this moment heard that the post goes every day,  so I must conclude, that you may get this letter the sooner. Be calm! for  we can only attain our object of living together by the calm contemplation  of our existence. Continue to love me. Yesterday, to-day, what longings for  you, what tears for you! for you! for you! my life! my all! Farewell! Oh!  love me forever, and never doubt the faithful heart of your lover, L.    Ever thine.  Ever mine.  Ever each other's.    [Footnote 1: These letters to his \"immortal beloved,\" to whom the C sharp  minor Sonata is dedicated, appear here for the first time in their  integrity, in accordance with the originals written in pencil on fine  notepaper, and given in Schindler's _Beethoven's Nachlass_. There has been  much discussion about the date. It is certified, in the first place, in the  church register which Alex. Thayer saw in Vienna, that Giulietta was  married to Count Gallenberg in 1801; and in the next place, the 6th of July  falls on a Monday in 1800. The other reasons which induce me decidedly to  fix this latter year as the date of the letter, I mean to give at full  length in the second volume of _Beethoven's Biography_. I may also state  that Beethoven was at baths in Hungary at that time. Whether the K---- in  the second letter means Komorn, I cannot tell.]      16.    TO MATTHISSON.    Vienna, August 4, 1800.    MOST ESTEEMED FRIEND,--    You will receive with this one of my compositions published some years  since, and yet, to my shame, you probably have never heard of it. I cannot  attempt to excuse myself, or to explain why I dedicated a work to you which  came direct from my heart, but never acquainted you with its existence,  unless indeed in this way, that at first I did not know where you lived,  and partly also from diffidence, which led me to think I might have been  premature in dedicating a work to you before ascertaining that you approved  of it. Indeed, even now I send you \"Adelaide\" with a feeling of timidity.  You know yourself what changes the lapse of some years brings forth in an  artist who continues to make progress; the greater the advances we make in  art, the less are we satisfied with our works of an earlier date. My most  ardent wish will be fulfilled if you are not dissatisfied with the manner  in which I have set your heavenly \"Adelaide\" to music, and are incited by  it soon to compose a similar poem; and if you do not consider my request  too indiscreet, I would ask you to send it to me forthwith, that I may  exert all my energies to approach your lovely poetry in merit. Pray regard  the dedication as a token of the pleasure which your \"Adelaide\" conferred  on me, as well as of the appreciation and intense delight your poetry  always has inspired, and _always will inspire in me_.    When playing \"Adelaide,\" sometimes recall    Your sincere admirer,    BEETHOVEN.      17.    TO FRAU FRANK,--VIENNA    October, 1800.    DEAR LADY,--    At the second announcement of our concert, you must remind your husband  that the public should be made acquainted with the names of those whose  talents are to contribute to this concert. Such is the custom here; and  indeed, were it not so, what is there to attract a larger audience? which  is after all our chief object. Punto [the celebrated horn-player, for whom  Beethoven wrote Sonata 17] is not a little indignant about the omission,  and I must say he has reason to be so; but even before seeing him it was my  intention to have reminded you of this, for I can only explain the mistake  by great haste or great forgetfulness. Be so good, then, dear lady, as to  attend to my hint; otherwise you will certainly expose yourself to _many  annoyances_. Being at last convinced in my own mind, and by others, that I  shall not be quite superfluous in this concert, I know that not only I, but  also Punto, Simoni [a tenorist], and Galvani will demand that the public  should be apprised of our zeal for this charitable object; otherwise we  must all conclude that we are not wanted.    Yours,    BEETHOVEN.      18.    TO HERR VON WEGELER.    Vienna, Nov. 16, 1800.    MY DEAR WEGELER,--    I thank you for this fresh proof of your interest in me, especially as I so  little deserve it. You wish to know how I am, and what remedies I use.  Unwilling as I always feel to discuss this subject, still I feel less  reluctant to do so with you than with any other person. For some months  past Vering has ordered me to apply blisters on both arms, of a particular  kind of bark, with which you are probably acquainted,--a disagreeable  remedy, independent of the pain, as it deprives me of the free use of my  arms for a couple of days at a time, till the blisters have drawn  sufficiently. The ringing and buzzing in my ears have certainly rather  decreased, particularly in the left ear, in which the malady first  commenced, but my hearing is not at all improved; in fact I fear that it is  become rather worse. My health is better, and after using the tepid baths  for a time, I feel pretty well for eight or ten days. I seldom take tonics,  but I have begun applications of herbs, according to your advice. Vering  will not hear of plunge baths, but I am much dissatisfied with him; he is  neither so attentive nor so indulgent as he ought to be to such a malady;  if I did not go to him, which is no easy matter, I should never see him at  all. What is your opinion of Schmidt [an army surgeon]? I am unwilling to  make any change, but it seems to me that Vering is too much of a  practitioner to acquire new ideas by reading. On this point Schmidt appears  to be a very different man, and would probably be less negligent with  regard to my case. I hear wonders of galvanism; what do you say to it? A  physician told me that he knew a deaf and dumb child whose hearing was  restored by it (in Berlin), and likewise a man who had been deaf for seven  years, and recovered his hearing. I am told that your friend Schmidt is at  this moment making experiments on the subject.    I am now leading a somewhat more agreeable life, as of late I have been  associating more with other people. You could scarcely believe what a sad  and dreary life mine has been for the last two years; my defective hearing  everywhere pursuing me like a spectre, making me fly from every one, and  appear a misanthrope; and yet no one is in reality less so! This change has  been wrought by a lovely fascinating girl [undoubtedly Giulietta], who  loves me "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13097"],[0,"Lives of the Most Remarkable Criminals Who have been Condemned and Executed for (#6)"],[1,"cellar was missing on a sudden, and on Mrs.  Griffin's first speaking of it they began to look for it. But it not  being found, Mrs. Griffin went into the room where the maid was, and  using some very harsh expression, taxed her with having seen it, or laid  it out of the way. Instead of excusing herself modestly, the maid flew  out also into ill language at her mistress, and in the midst of the  fray, the knife with which she had been cutting lying unluckily by her,  she snatched it up, and stuck it into the maid's bosom; her stays  happening to be unluckily open, it entered so deep as to give her a  mortal wound.    After she had struck her Mrs. Griffin went upstairs, not imagining that  she had killed her, but the alarm was soon raised on her falling down,  and Mrs. Griffin was carried before a magistrate, and committed to  Newgate. When she was first confined, she seemed hopeful of getting off  at her trial, yet though she did not make any confession, she was very  sorrowful and concerned. As her trial drew nearer, her apprehensions  grew stronger, till notwithstanding all she could urge in her defence,  the jury found her guilty, and sentence was pronounced as the Law  directs.    Hitherto she had hopes of life, and though she did not totally  relinquish them even upon her conviction, yet she prepared with all due  care for her departure. She sent for the minister of her own parish, who  attended her with great charity, and she seemed exceedingly penitent  and heartily sorry for her crime, praying with great favour and emotion.    And as the struggling of an afflicted heart seeks every means to vent  its sorrow, in order to gain ease, or at least an alleviation of pain,  so this unhappy woman, to soothe the gloomy sorrows that oppressed her,  used to sit down on the dirty floor, saying it was fit she should humble  herself in dust and ashes, and professing that if she had an hundred  hearts she would freely yield them all to bleed, so they might blot out  the stain of her offence. By such expression did she testify those  inward sufferings which far exceed the punishment human laws inflict,  even on the greatest crimes.    When the death warrant came down and she utterly despaired of life, her  sorrow and contrition became greater than before, and here the use and  comfort of religion manifestly appeared; for had not her faith in Christ  moderated her afflictions, perhaps grief might have forestalled the  executioner, but she still comforted herself with thinking on a future  state, and what in so short an interval she must do to deserve an happy  immortality.    The time of her death drawing very near, she desired a last interview  with her husband and daughter, which was accompanied with so much  tenderness that nobody could have beheld it without the greatest  emotion. She exhorted her husband with great earnestness to the practice  of a regular and Christian life, begged him to take due care of his  temporal concerns, and not omit anything necessary in the education of  the unhappy child she left behind her. When he had promised a due regard  should be had to all her requests she seemed more composed and better  satisfied than she had been. Continuing her discourse, she reminded him  of what occurred to her with regard to his affairs, adding that it was  the last advice she should give, and begging therefore it might be  remembered. She finished what she had to say with the most fervent  prayers and wishes for his prosperity.    Turning next to her daughter, and pouring over her a flood of tears, _My  dearest child_, she said, _let the afflictions of thy mother be a  warning and an example unto thee; and since I am denied life to educate  and bring thee up, let this dreadful monument of my death suffice to  warn you against yielding in any degree to your passion, or suffering a  vehemence of temper to transport you so far even as indecent words,  which bring on a custom of flying out in a rage on trivial occasions,  till they fatally terminate in such acts of wrath and cruelty as that  for which I die. Let your heart, then, be set to obey your Maker and  yield a ready submission to all His laws. Learn that Charity, Love and  Meekness which our blessed religion teaches, and let your mother's  unhappy death excite you to a sober and godly life. The hopes of thus  are all I have to comfort me in this miserable state, this deplorable  condition to which my own rash folly has reduced me._    The sorrow expressed both by her husband and by her child was very great  and lively and scarce inferior to her own, but the ministers who  attended her fearing their lamentations might make too strong an  impression on her spirits, they took their last farewell, leaving her to  take care of her more important concern, the eternal welfare of her  soul.    Some malicious people (as is too often the custom) spread stories of  this unfortunate woman, as if she had been privy to the murder of one  Mr. Hanson, who was killed in the Farthing-Pie House fields[3]; and  attended this with so many odd circumstances and particulars, which  tales of this kind acquire by often being repeated, that the then  Ordinary of Newgate thought it became him to mention it to the prisoner.  Mrs. Griffin appeared to be much affected at her character being thus  stained by the fictions of idle suspicions of silly mischievous persons.  She declared her innocence in the most solemn manner, averred she had  never lived near the place, nor had heard so much as the common reports  as to that gentleman's death.    Yet, as if folks were desirous to heap sorrow on sorrow, and to embitter  even the heavy sentence on this poor woman, they now gave out a new  fable to calumniate her in respect to her chastity, averring on report  of which the first author is never to be found, that she had lived with  Mr. Griffin in a criminal intimacy before their marriage. The Ordinary  also (though with great reluctance) told her this story. The unhappy  woman answered it was false, and confirmed what she said by undeniable  evidence, adding she freely forgave the forgers of so base an  insinuation.    When the fatal day came on which she was to die, Mrs. Griffin  endeavoured, as far as she was able, to compose herself easily to submit  to what was not now to be avoided. She had all along manifested a true  sense of religion, knowing that nothing could support her under the  calamities she went through but the hopes of earthly sufferings atoning  for her faults, and becoming thereby a means of eternal salvation. Yet  though these thoughts reconciled this ignominious death to her reason,  her apprehensions were, notwithstanding, strong and terrible when it  came so near.    At the place of execution she was in terrible agonies, conjuring the  minister who attended her and the Ordinary of Newgate, to tell her  whither there was any hopes of her salvation, which she repeated with  great earnestness, and seeming to part with them reluctantly. The  Ordinary entreated her to submit cheerfully to this, her last stage of  sorrow, and in certain assurance of meeting again (if it so pleased God)  in a better slate.    The following paper having been left in the hands of a friend, and being  designed for the people, I thought proper to publish it.        I declare, then, with respect to the deed for which I die, that I      did it without any malice or anger aforethought, for the unlucky      instrument of my passion lying at hand, when first words arose on      the loss of the key, I snatched it up suddenly, and executed that      rash act which hath brought her and me to death, without thinking.        I trust, however, that my most sincere and hearty repentance of this      bloody act of cruelty, the sufferings which I have endured since,      the ignominious death I am now to die, and above all the merits of      my Saviour, who shed His blood for me on the Cross, will atone for      this my deep and heavy offence, and procure for me eternal rest.        But as I am sensible that there is no just hope of forgiveness from      the Almighty without a perfect forgiveness of those who have any way      injured us, so I do freely and from the bottom of my soul, forgive      all who have ever done me any wrong, and particularly those who,      since my sorrowful imprisonment, have cruelly aspersed me, earnestly      entreating all who in my life-time I may have offended, that they      would also in pity to my deplorable state, remit those offences to      me with a like freedom.        And now as the Law hath adjudged, and I freely offer my body to      suffer for what I have committed, I hope nobody will be so unjust      and so uncharitable as to reflect on those I leave behind me on my      account, and for this, I most humbly make my last dying request, as      also that ye would pray for my departed soul.    She died with all exterior marks of true penitence, being about forty  years of age, the 29th of January, 1719-20.
