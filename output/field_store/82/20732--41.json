Translated Into English in the Original Metres (#6)"],[1,"and a lumber-garret,  Or, at the best, a Punch-and-Judy play,  With maxims most pragmatical and hitting,  As in the mouths of puppets are befitting!      WAGNER    But then, the world--the human heart and brain!  Of these one covets some slight apprehension.      FAUST    Yes, of the kind which men attain!  Who dares the child's true name in public mention?  The few, who thereof something really learned,  Unwisely frank, with hearts that spurned concealing,  And to the mob laid bare each thought and feeling,  Have evermore been crucified and burned.  I pray you, Friend, 'tis now the dead of night;  Our converse here must be suspended.      WAGNER    I would have shared your watches with delight,  That so our learned talk might be extended.  To-morrow, though, I'll ask, in Easter leisure,  This and the other question, at your pleasure.  Most zealously I seek for erudition:  Much do I know--but to know all is my ambition.                                                [_Exit_.      FAUST (_solus_)    That brain, alone, not loses hope, whose choice is  To stick in shallow trash forevermore,--  Which digs with eager hand for buried ore,  And, when it finds an angle-worm, rejoices!    Dare such a human voice disturb the flow,  Around me here, of spirit-presence fullest?  And yet, this once my thanks I owe  To thee, of all earth's sons the poorest, dullest!  For thou hast torn me from that desperate state  Which threatened soon to overwhelm my senses:  The apparition was so giant-great,  It dwarfed and withered all my soul's pretences!    I, image of the Godhead, who began--  Deeming Eternal Truth secure in nearness--  Ye choirs, have ye begun the sweet, consoling chant,  Which, through the night of Death, the angels ministrant  Sang, God's new Covenant repeating?      CHORUS OF WOMEN              With spices and precious            Balm, we arrayed him;            Faithful and gracious,            We tenderly laid him:            Linen to bind him            Cleanlily wound we:            Ah! when we would find him,            Christ no more found we!      CHORUS OF ANGELS              Christ is ascended!            Bliss hath invested him,--            Woes that molested him,            Trials that tested him,            Gloriously ended!      FAUST    Why, here in dust, entice me with your spell,  Ye gentle, powerful sounds of Heaven?  Peal rather there, where tender natures dwell.  Your messages I hear, but faith has not been given;  The dearest child of Faith is Miracle.  I venture not to soar to yonder regions  Whence the glad tidings hither float;  And yet, from childhood up familiar with the note,  To Life it now renews the old allegiance.  Once Heavenly Love sent down a burning kiss  Upon my brow, in Sabbath silence holy;  And, filled with mystic presage, chimed the church-bell slowly,  And prayer dissolved me in a fervent bliss.  A sweet, uncomprehended yearning  Drove forth my feet through woods and meadows free,  And while a thousand tears were burning,  I felt a world arise for me.  These chants, to youth and all its sports appealing,  Proclaimed the Spring's rejoicing holiday;  And Memory holds me now, with childish feeling,  Back from the last, the solemn way.  Sound on, ye hymns of Heaven, so sweet and mild!  My tears gush forth: the Earth takes back her child!      CHORUS OF DISCIPLES            Has He, victoriously,          Burst from the vaulted          Grave, and all-gloriously          Now sits exalted?          Is He, in glow of birth,          Rapture creative near?          Ah! to the woe of earth          Still are we native here.          We, his aspiring          Followers, Him we miss;          Weeping, desiring,          Master, Thy bliss!    CHORUS OF ANGELS            Christ is arisen,          Out of Corruption's womb:          Burst ye the prison,          Break from your gloom!          Praising and pleading him,          Lovingly needing him,          Brotherly feeding him,          Preaching and speeding him,          Blessing, succeeding Him,          Thus is the Master near,--          Thus is He here!  [Illustration]          II    BEFORE THE CITY-GATE    (_Pedestrians of all kinds come forth_.)      SEVERAL APPRENTICES    Why do you go that way?      OTHERS    We're for the Hunters' lodge, to-day.      THE FIRST    We'll saunter to the Mill, in yonder hollow.      AN APPRENTICE    Go to the River Tavern, I should say.      SECOND APPRENTICE    But then, it's not a pleasant way.      THE OTHERS    And what will _you_?    A THIRD                As goes the crowd, I follow.      A FOURTH    Come up to Burgdorf? There you'll find good cheer,  The finest lasses and the best of beer,  And jolly rows and squabbles, trust me!      A FIFTH    You swaggering fellow, is your hide  A third time itching to be tried?  I won't go there, your jolly rows disgust me!      SERVANT-GIRL    No,--no! I'll turn and go to town again.      ANOTHER    We'll surely find him by those poplars yonder.      THE FIRST    That's no great luck for me, 'tis plain.  You'll have him, when and where you wander:  His partner in the dance you'll be,--  But what is all your fun to me?      THE OTHER    He's surely not alone to-day:  He'll be with Curly-head, I heard him say.      A STUDENT    Deuce! how they step, the buxom wenches!  Come, Brother! we must see them to the benches.  A strong, old beer, a pipe that stings and bites,  A girl in Sunday clothes,--these three are my delights.      CITIZEN'S DAUGHTER    Just see those handsome fellows, there!  It's really shameful, I declare;--  To follow servant-girls, when they  Might have the most genteel society to-day!      SECOND STUDENT (_to the First_)    Not quite so fast! Two others come behind,--  Those, dressed so prettily and neatly.  My neighbor's one of them, I find,  A girl that takes my heart, completely.  They go their way with looks demure,  But they'll accept us, after all, I'm sure.      THE FIRST    No, Brother! not for me their formal ways.  Quick! lest our game escape us in the press:  The hand that wields the broom on Saturdays  Will best, on Sundays, fondle and caress.      CITIZEN    He suits me not at all, our new-made Burgomaster!  Since he's installed, his arrogance grows faster.  How has he helped the town, I say?  Things worsen,--what improvement names he?  Obedience, more than ever, claims he,  And more than ever we must pay!      BEGGAR (_sings_)      Good gentlemen and lovely ladies,    So red of cheek and fine of dress,    Behold, how needful here your aid is,    And see and lighten my distress!    Let me not vainly sing my ditty;    He's only glad who gives away:    A holiday, that shows your pity,    Shall be for me a harvest-day!      ANOTHER CITIZEN    On Sundays, holidays, there's naught I take delight in,  Like gossiping of war, and war's array,  When down in Turkey, far away,  The foreign people are a-fighting.  One at the window sits, with glass and friends,  And sees all sorts of ships go down the river gliding:  And blesses then, as home he wends  At night, our times of peace abiding.      THIRD CITIZEN    Yes, Neighbor! that's my notion, too:  Why, let them break their heads, let loose their passions,  And mix things madly through and through,  So, here, we keep our good old fashions!      OLD WOMAN (_to the Citizen's Daughter_)    Dear me, how fine! So handsome, and so young!  Who wouldn't lose his heart, that met you?  Don't be so proud! I'll hold my tongue,  And what you'd like I'll undertake to get you.      CITIZEN'S DAUGHTER    Come, Agatha! I shun the witch's sight  Before folks, lest there be misgiving:  'Tis true, she showed me, on Saint Andrew's Night,  My future sweetheart, just as he were living.      THE OTHER    She showed me mine, in crystal clear,  With several wild young blades, a soldier-lover:  I seek him everywhere, I pry and peer,  And yet, somehow, his face I can't discover.    SOLDIERS            Castles, with lofty          Ramparts and towers,          Maidens disdainful          In Beauty's array,          Both shall be ours!          Bold is the venture,          Splendid the pay!          Lads, let the trumpets          For us be suing,--          Calling to pleasure,          Calling to ruin.          Stormy our life is;          Such is its boon!          Maidens and castles          Capitulate soon.          Bold is the venture,          Splendid the pay!          And the soldiers go marching,          Marching away!      FAUST AND WAGNER      FAUST    Released from ice are brook and river  By the quickening glance of the gracious Spring;  The colors of hope to the valley cling,  And weak old Winter himself must shiver,  Withdrawn to the mountains, a crownless king:  Whence, ever retreating, he sends again  Impotent showers of sleet that darkle  In belts across the green o' the plain.  But the sun will permit no white to sparkle;  Everywhere form in development moveth;  He will brighten the world with the tints he loveth,  And, lacking blossoms, blue, yellow, and red,  He takes these gaudy people instead.  Turn thee about, and from this height  Back on the town direct thy sight.  Out of the hollow, gloomy gate,  The motley throngs come forth elate:  Each will the joy of the sunshine hoard,  To honor the Day of the Risen Lord!  They feel, themselves, their resurrection:  From the low, dark rooms, scarce habitable;  From the bonds of Work, from Trade's restriction;  From the pressing weight of roof and gable;  From the narrow, crushing streets and alleys;  From the churches' solemn and reverend night,  All come forth to the cheerful light.  How lively, see! the multitude sallies,  Scattering through gardens and fields remote,  While over the river, that broadly dallies,  Dances so many a festive boat;  And overladen, nigh to sinking,  The last full wherry takes the stream.  Yonder afar, from the hill-paths blinking,  Their clothes are colors that softly gleam.

More than once she had been known  to have a tea party, made up of these despised ones, in her own room.  And Emily had been played with, and Emily's own tea service used--the  one with cups which held quite a lot of much-sweetened weak tea and had  blue flowers on them.  No one had seen such a very real doll's tea set  before.  From that afternoon Sara was regarded as a goddess and a queen  by the entire alphabet class.    Lottie Legh worshipped her to such an extent that if Sara had not been  a motherly person, she would have found her tiresome.  Lottie had been  sent to school by a rather flighty young papa who could not imagine  what else to do with her.  Her young mother had died, and as the child  had been treated like a favorite doll or a very spoiled pet monkey or  lap dog ever since the first hour of her life, she was a very appalling  little creature.  When she wanted anything or did not want anything she  wept and howled; and, as she always wanted the things she could not  have, and did not want the things that were best for her, her shrill  little voice was usually to be heard uplifted in wails in one part of  the house or another.    Her strongest weapon was that in some mysterious way she had found out  that a very small girl who had lost her mother was a person who ought  to be pitied and made much of.  She had probably heard some grown-up  people talking her over in the early days, after her mother's death. So  it became her habit to make great use of this knowledge.    The first time Sara took her in charge was one morning when, on passing  a sitting room, she heard both Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia trying to  suppress the angry wails of some child who, evidently, refused to be  silenced.  She refused so strenuously indeed that Miss Minchin was  obliged to almost shout--in a stately and severe manner--to make  herself heard.    \"What IS she crying for?\" she almost yelled.    \"Oh--oh--oh!\"  Sara heard; \"I haven't got any mam--ma-a!\"    \"Oh, Lottie!\" screamed Miss Amelia.  \"Do stop, darling!  Don't cry!  Please don't!\"    \"Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!\"  Lottie howled tempestuously.  \"Haven't--got--any--mam--ma-a!\"    \"She ought to be whipped,\" Miss Minchin proclaimed.  \"You SHALL be  whipped, you naughty child!\"    Lottie wailed more loudly than ever.  Miss Amelia began to cry.  Miss  Minchin's voice rose until it almost thundered, then suddenly she  sprang up from her chair in impotent indignation and flounced out of  the room, leaving Miss Amelia to arrange the matter.    Sara had paused in the hall, wondering if she ought to go into the  room, because she had recently begun a friendly acquaintance with  Lottie and might be able to quiet her.  When Miss Minchin came out and  saw her, she looked rather annoyed.  She realized that her voice, as  heard from inside the room, could not have sounded either dignified or  amiable.    \"Oh, Sara!\" she exclaimed, endeavoring to produce a suitable smile.    \"I stopped,\" explained Sara, \"because I knew it was Lottie--and I  thought, perhaps--just perhaps, I could make her be quiet. May I try,  Miss Minchin?\"    \"If you can, you are a clever child,\" answered Miss Minchin, drawing in  her mouth sharply.  Then, seeing that Sara looked slightly chilled by  her asperity, she changed her manner. \"But you are clever in  everything,\" she said in her approving way. \"I dare say you can manage  her.  Go in.\"  And she left her.    When Sara entered the room, Lottie was lying upon the floor, screaming  and kicking her small fat legs violently, and Miss Amelia was bending  over her in consternation and despair, looking quite red and damp with  heat.  Lottie had always found, when in her own nursery at home, that  kicking and screaming would always be quieted by any means she insisted  on.  Poor plump Miss Amelia was trying first one method, and then  another.    \"Poor darling,\" she said one moment, \"I know you haven't any mamma,  poor--\" Then in quite another tone, \"If you don't stop, Lottie, I will  shake you.  Poor little angel!  There--!  You wicked, bad, detestable  child, I will smack you!  I will!\"    Sara went to them quietly.  She did not know at all what she was going  to do, but she had a vague inward conviction that it would be better  not to say such different kinds of things quite so helplessly and  excitedly.    \"Miss Amelia,\" she said in a low voice, \"Miss Minchin says I may try to  make her stop--may I?\"    Miss Amelia turned and looked at her hopelessly.  \"Oh, DO you think you  can?\" she gasped.    \"I don't know whether I CAN\", answered Sara, still in her half-whisper;  \"but I will try.\"    Miss Amelia stumbled up from her knees with a heavy sigh, and Lottie's  fat little legs kicked as hard as ever.    \"If you will steal out of the room,\" said Sara, \"I will stay with her.\"    \"Oh, Sara!\" almost whimpered Miss Amelia.  \"We never had such a  dreadful child before.  I don't believe we can keep her.\"    But she crept out of the room, and was very much relieved to find an  excuse for doing it.    Sara stood by the howling furious child for a few moments, and looked  down at her without saying anything.  Then she sat down flat on the  floor beside her and waited.  Except for Lottie's angry screams, the  room was quite quiet.  This was a new state of affairs for little Miss  Legh, who was accustomed, when she screamed, to hear other people  protest and implore and command and coax by turns. To lie and kick and  shriek, and find the only person near you not seeming to mind in the  least, attracted her attention. She opened her tight-shut streaming  eyes to see who this person was. And it was only another little girl.  But it was the one who owned Emily and all the nice things.  And she  was looking at her steadily and as if she was merely thinking.  Having  paused for a few seconds to find this out, Lottie thought she must  begin again, but the quiet of the room and of Sara's odd, interested  face made her first howl rather half-hearted.    \"I--haven't--any--ma--ma--ma-a!\" she announced; but her voice was not  so strong.    Sara looked at her still more steadily, but with a sort of  understanding in her eyes.    \"Neither have I,\" she said.    This was so unexpected that it was astounding.  Lottie actually dropped  her legs, gave a wriggle, and lay and stared.  A new idea will stop a  crying child when nothing else will.  Also it was true that while  Lottie disliked Miss Minchin, who was cross, and Miss Amelia, who was  foolishly indulgent, she rather liked Sara, little as she knew her.  She did not want to give up her grievance, but her thoughts were  distracted from it, so she wriggled again, and, after a sulky sob,  said, \"Where is she?\"    Sara paused a moment.  Because she had been told that her mamma was in  heaven, she had thought a great deal about the matter, and her thoughts  had not been quite like those of other people.    \"She went to heaven,\" she said.  \"But I am sure she comes out sometimes  to see me--though I don't see her.  So does yours.  Perhaps they can  both see us now.  Perhaps they are both in this room.\"    Lottie sat bolt upright, and looked about her.  She was a pretty,  little, curly-headed creature, and her round eyes were like wet  forget-me-nots. If her mamma had seen her during the last half-hour,  she might not have thought her the kind of child who ought to be  related to an angel.    Sara went on talking.  Perhaps some people might think that what she  said was rather like a fairy story, but it was all so real to her own  imagination that Lottie began to listen in spite of herself. She had  been told that her mamma had wings and a crown, and she had been shown  pictures of ladies in beautiful white nightgowns, who were said to be  angels.  But Sara seemed to be telling a real story about a lovely  country where real people were.    \"There are fields and fields of flowers,\" she said, forgetting herself,  as usual, when she began, and talking rather as if she were in a dream,  \"fields and fields of lilies--and when the soft wind blows over them it  wafts the scent of them into the air--and everybody always breathes it,  because the soft wind is always blowing.  And little children run about  in the lily fields and gather armfuls of them, and laugh and make  little wreaths.  And the streets are shining. And people are never  tired, however far they walk.  They can float anywhere they like.  And  there are walls made of pearl and gold all round the city, but they are  low enough for the people to go and lean on them, and look down onto  the earth and smile, and send beautiful messages.\"    Whatsoever story she had begun to tell, Lottie would, no doubt, have  stopped crying, and been fascinated into listening; but there was no  denying that this story was prettier than most others. She dragged  herself close to Sara, and drank in every word until the end came--far  too soon.  When it did come, she was so sorry that she put up her lip  ominously.    \"I want to go there,\" she cried.  \"I--haven't any mamma in this school.\"    Sara saw the danger signal, and came out of her dream.  She took hold  of the chubby hand and pulled her close to her side with a coaxing  little laugh.    \"I will be your mamma,\" she said.  \"We will play that you are my little  girl.  And Emily shall be your sister.\"    Lottie's dimples all began to show themselves.    \"Shall she?\" she said.    \"Yes,\" answered Sara, jumping to her feet.  \"Let us go and tell her.  And then I will wash your face and brush your hair.\"    To which Lottie agreed quite cheerfully, and trotted out of the room  and upstairs with her, without seeming even to remember that the whole  of the last hour's tragedy had been caused by the fact that she had  refused to be washed and brushed for lunch and Miss Minchin had been  called in to use her majestic authority.    And from that time Sara was an"]]]
