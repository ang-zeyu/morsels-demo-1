The earthenware vessels used in this period are in many cases already  very near to porcelain: there was a pottery of a brilliant white,  lacking only the glaze which would have made it into porcelain. Patterns  were stamped on the surface, often resembling the patterns on bronze  articles. This ware was used only for formal, ceremonial purposes. For  daily use there was also a perfectly simple grey pottery.    Silk was already in use at this time. The invention of sericulture must  therefore have dated from very ancient times in China. It undoubtedly  originated in the south of China, and at first not only the threads  spun by the silkworm but those made by other caterpillars were also  used. The remains of silk fabrics that have been found show already an  advanced weaving technique. In addition to silk, various plant fibres,  such as hemp, were in use. Woollen fabrics do not seem to have been yet  used.    The Shang were agriculturists, but their implements were still rather  primitive. There was no real plough yet; hoes and hoe-like implements  were used, and the grain, mainly different kinds of millet and some  wheat, was harvested with sickles. The materials, from which these  implements were made, were mainly wood and stone; bronze was still too  expensive to be utilized by the ordinary farmer. As a great number of  vessels for wine in many different forms have been excavated, we can  assume that wine, made from special kinds of millet, was a popular  drink.    The Shang state had its centre in northern Honan, north of the Yellow  river. At various times, different towns were made into the capital  city; Yin-ch'ue, their last capital and the only one which has been  excavated, was their sixth capital. We do not know why the capitals were  removed to new locations; it is possible that floods were one of the  main reasons. The area under more or less organized Shang control  comprised towards the end of the dynasty the present provinces of Honan,  western Shantung, southern Hopei, central and south Shansi, east Shensi,  parts of Kiangsu and Anhui. We can only roughly estimate the size of the  population of the Shang state. Late texts say that at the time of the  annihilation of the dynasty, some 3.1 million free men and 1.1 million  serfs were captured by the conquerors; this would indicate a population  of at least some 4-5 millions. This seems a possible number, if we  consider that an inscription of the tenth century B.C. which reports  about an ordinary war against a small and unimportant western neighbour,  speaks of 13,081 free men and 4,812 serfs taken as prisoners.    Inscriptions mention many neighbours of the Shang with whom they were in  more or less continuous state of war. Many of these neighbours can now  be identified. We know that Shansi at that time was inhabited by Ch'iang  tribes, belonging to the Tibetan culture, as well as by Ti tribes,  belonging to the northern culture, and by Hsien-yuen and other tribes,  belonging to the north-western culture; the centre of the Ch'iang tribes  was more in the south-west of Shansi and in Shensi. Some of these tribes  definitely once formed a part of the earlier Hsia state. The  identification of the eastern neighbours of the Shang presents more  difficulties. We might regard them as representatives of the Tai and Yao  cultures.    2 _Writing and Religion_    Not only the material but also the intellectual level attained in the  Shang period was very high. We meet for the first time with  writing--much later than in the Middle East and in India. Chinese  scholars have succeeded in deciphering some of the documents discovered,  so that we are able to learn a great deal from them. The writing is a  rudimentary form of the present-day Chinese script, and like it a  pictorial writing, but also makes use, as today, of many phonetic signs.  There were, however, a good many characters that no longer exist, and  many now used are absent. There were already more than 3,000 characters  in use of which some 1,000 can now be read. (Today newspapers use some  3,000 characters; scholars have command of up to 8,000; the whole of  Chinese literature, ancient and modern, comprises some 50,000  characters.) With these 3,000 characters the Chinese of the Shang period  were able to express themselves well.    The still existing fragments of writing of this period are found almost  exclusively on tortoiseshells or on other bony surfaces, and they  represent oracles. As early as in the Lung-shan culture there was  divination by means of \"oracle bones\", at first without written  characters. In the earliest period any bones of animals (especially  shoulder-bones) were used; later only tortoiseshell. For the purpose of  the oracle a depression was burnt in the shell so that cracks were  formed on the other side, and the future was foretold from their  direction. Subsequently particular questions were scratched on the  shells, and the answers to them; these are the documents that have come  down to us. In Anyang tens of thousands of these oracle bones with  inscriptions have been found. The custom of asking the oracle and of  writing the answers on the bones spread over the borders of the Shang  state and continued in some areas after the end of the dynasty.    The bronze vessels of later times often bear long inscriptions, but  those of the Shang period have only very brief texts. On the other hand,  they are ornamented with pictures, as yet largely unintelligible, of  countless deities, especially in the shape of animals or birds--pictures  that demand interpretation. The principal form on these bronzes is that  of the so-called T'ao-t'ieh, a hybrid with the head of a water-buffalo  and tiger's teeth.    The Shang period had a religion with many nature deities, especially  deities of fertility. There was no systematized pantheon, different  deities being revered in each locality, often under the most varied  names. These various deities were, however, similar in character, and  later it occurred often that many of them were combined by the priests  into a single god. The composite deities thus formed were officially  worshipped. Their primeval forms lived on, however, especially in the  villages, many centuries longer than the Shang dynasty. The sacrifices  associated with them became popular festivals, and so these gods or  their successors were saved from oblivion; some of them have lived on in  popular religion to the present day. The supreme god of the official  worship was called Shang Ti; he was a god of vegetation who guided all  growth and birth and was later conceived as a forefather of the races of  mankind. The earth was represented as a mother goddess, who bore the  plants and animals procreated by Shang Ti. In some parts of the Shang  realm the two were conceived as a married couple who later were parted  by one of their children. The husband went to heaven, and the rain is  the male seed that creates life on earth. In other regions it was  supposed that in the beginning of the world there was a world-egg, out  of which a primeval god came, whose body was represented by the earth:  his hair formed the plants, and his limbs the mountains and valleys.  Every considerable mountain was also itself a god and, similarly, the  river god, the thunder god, cloud, lightning, and wind gods, and many  others were worshipped.    In order to promote the fertility of the earth, it was believed that  sacrifices must be offered to the gods. Consequently, in the Shang realm  and the regions surrounding it there were many sorts of human  sacrifices; often the victims were prisoners of war. One gains the  impression that many wars were conducted not as wars of conquest but  only for the purpose of capturing prisoners, although the area under  Shang control gradually increased towards the west and the south-east, a  fact demonstrating the interest in conquest. In some regions men lurked  in the spring for people from other villages; they slew them, sacrificed  them to the earth, and distributed portions of the flesh of the  sacrifice to the various owners of fields, who buried them. At a later  time all human sacrifices were prohibited, but we have reports down to  the eleventh century A.D., and even later, that such sacrifices were  offered secretly in certain regions of central China. In other regions a  great boat festival was held in the spring, to which many crews came  crowded in long narrow boats. At least one of the boats had to capsize;  the people who were thus drowned were a sacrifice to the deities of  fertility. This festival has maintained its fundamental character to  this day, in spite of various changes. The same is true of other  festivals, customs, and conceptions, vestiges of which are contained at  least in folklore.    In addition to the nature deities which were implored to give fertility,  to send rain, or to prevent floods and storms, the Shang also  worshipped deceased rulers and even dead ministers as a kind of  intermediaries between man and the highest deity, Shang Ti. This  practice may be regarded as the forerunner of \"ancestral worship\" which  became so typical of later China.      3 _Transition to feudalism_    At the head of the Shang state was a king, posthumously called a \"Ti\",  the same word as in the name of the supreme god. We have found on bones  the names of all the rulers of this dynasty and even some of their  pre-dynastic ancestors. These names can be brought into agreement with  lists of rulers found in the ancient Chinese literature. The ruler seems  to have been a high priest, too; and around him were many other priests.  We know some of them now so well from the inscriptions that their  biographies could be written. The king seems to have had some kind of  bureaucracy. There were \"ch'en\", officials who served the ruler  personally, as well as scribes and military officials.

The tea-tree loves to grow in valleys, at the foot of mountains, and  upon the banks of rivers, where it enjoys a southern exposure to the  sun, though it endures considerable variations of heat and cold, as it  flourishes in the northern clime of Peking, as well as about Canton;  and it is observed that the degree of cold at Peking is as severe in  winter as in some parts of Europe. However, the best tea grows in a  mild, temperate climate, the country about Nanking producing better  tea than either Peking or Canton, betwixt which places it is situated.  The root resembles that of the peach-tree; the leaves are green,  longish at the point, and narrow, an inch and half long, and jagged  all round. The flower is much like that of the wild rose, but smaller.  The fruit is of different forms, sometimes round, sometimes long,  sometimes triangular, and of the ordinary size of a bean, containing  two or three seeds, of a mouse colour, including each a kernel. These  are the seeds by which the plant is propagated, a number, from six to  twelve, or fifteen, being promiscuously put into one hole, four or  five inches deep, at certain distances from each other. The seeds  vegetate without any other care, though the more industrious annually  remove the weeds and manure the land. The leaves which succeed are not  fit to be plucked before the third year's growth, at which period they  are plentiful, and in their prime. In about seven years the shrub  rises to a man's height, and as it then bears few leaves, and grows  slowly, it is cut down to the stem, which occasions an exuberance of  fresh shoots and leaves the succeeding summer. In Japan, the tea-tree  is cultivated round the borders of the fields, without regard to soil,  but as the Chinese export great quantities of tea, they plant whole  fields with it. The tea-trees that yield often the finest leaves, grow  on the steep declivities of hills, where it is dangerous and in some  cases impracticable to collect them. The Chinese are said to vanquish  this difficulty by a singular contrivance. The large monkeys which  inhabit these cliffs are irritated, and in revenge they break off the  branches and throw them down, so that the leaves are thus obtained.  The leaves should be dried as soon as possible after they are  gathered. The Chinese are always taking tea, especially at meals; it  is the chief treat with which they regale their friends, but they use  it without the addition of sugar and milk. Tea was first introduced  into Europe by the Dutch East India Company very early in the  seventeenth century, and a great quantity of it was brought over  from Holland by Lord Arlington and Lord Ossory about the year 1666,  at which time it sold for 60s. per pound. Tea exhilarates without  intoxication, and its enlivening qualities are equally felt by the  sedentary student and the active labourer. Dr. Johnson dearly loved  tea, and drank great quantities of this elegant and popular beverage,  and so does P.T.W.             *       *       *       *       *      PORSON.    The late professor having once exasperated a disputant by the dryness  of his sarcasm, the petulant opponent thus addressed him:--\"Mr.  Porson, I beg leave to tell you, sir, that my opinion of you is  perfectly contemptible.\" Person replied, \"I never knew an opinion of  yours, sir, which was not contemptible.\"           *       *       *       *       *      THE DRAMA AND ITS PROFESSORS.    (_For the Mirror_.)      It is remarkable with what difference actors were treated among the  ancients. At Athens, they were held in such esteem, as to be sometimes  appointed to discharge embassies and other negotiations; whereas, at  Rome, if a citizen became an actor, he thereby forfeited his freedom.  Among the moderns, actors are best treated in England; the French having  much the same opinion of them that the Romans had; for though an actor  of talent, in Paris, is more regarded than here, he nevertheless is  deeply degraded. He may die amid applauses on the stage, but at his  natural death, he must pass to his grave, without a prayer or _de  profundis_, unless a minister of religion receives his last sigh.    Cromwell and his Puritans had a holy horror of actors. They pronounced  them Sons of Belial! and professors of abomination. During the whole  reign of the Republican Parliament, and Protectorate, the theatres of  that day were closed, or, if opened by stealth, were subject to the  visits of the emissaries of \"Praise God Barebones,\" \"Fight the Good  Fight,\" and their crew. The actors were driven off the stage by  soldiers, and the cant word of that period is still recorded, \"Enter  red coat, exit hat and cloak.\" William Prynne was celebrated for his  writings against the immorality of the stage, and the furious invectives  of Jeremy Collier, are still extant; his pen was roused by Dryden's  _Spanish Friar_, and Congreve's witty, but licentious comedies. Collier  inveighed without mercy, but he certainly did much to reform the stage.  Our Evangelicals and Methodists denounce the histrionic art to this day,  with more than the zeal of the Church of Rome. But a follower of Wesley  or Whitfield would not enter the den of abomination. Here, however, we  take care all our comedies shall be purified, and our tragedies free,  even from an oath; both are subject to the censor's unsparing pen, and  must be subsequently licensed by the Lord Chamberlain.    The actors in England, have, it is true, only become respectable  within the last half century, and though they are termed his majesty's  servants, yet an _unrepealed_ statute denounces them as vagabonds.  As a body, numerous in itself, they are as free from crime as any other  associated body or profession of men, and yet do they \"his majesty's  servants\" continue to lay under the stigma which the above unrepealed  act fixes upon them. This is perfectly anomalous, and it was spiritedly  denounced by Sir Walter Scott, when on a recent and interesting occasion  he nobly and manfully declared \"Its professors had been stigmatized; and  laws had been passed against them less dishonourable to them than to the  statesman by whom they were proposed, and to the legislators by whom  they were passed.\" To repeal, therefore, an act nugatory in itself,  would not add to the reputation of the profession, nor give a license to  further abuse; but it would be an act of justice, and remove a prejudice  unjustly attached to the professors of a difficult art.    The critical pen of Mrs. Inchbald justly remarks, \"To the honour of  a profession long held in contempt by the wise--and still contemned  by the weak--Shakspeare, the pride of Britain, was a player.\" To the  illustrious bard, the modern drama is indebted for its excellence. His  writings will remain for ever the grandest monument of a genius which  opened to him the whole heart of man, all the mines of fancy, all the  stores of nature, and gave him power beyond all other writers, to move,  astonish, and delight mankind. In the drama, the most interesting  emotions are excited; the dangerous passions of hate, envy, avarice, and  pride, with all their innumerable train of attendant vices, are detected  and exposed. Love, friendship, gratitude, and all those active and  generous virtues which warm the heart and exalt the mind, are held up  as objects of emulation. And what can be a more effectual method of  softening the ferocity, and improving the minds of the inconsiderate?  The heart is melted by the scene, and ready to receive an  impression--either to warn the innocent, or to appal the guilty; and  numbers of those who have neither abilities nor time for deriving  advantage from reading, are powerfully impressed through the medium  of the eyes and ears, with those important truths which while they  illuminate the understanding, correct the heart. The moral laws of the  drama are said to have an effect next after those conveyed from the  pulpit, or promulgated in courts of justice. Mr. Burke, indeed, has gone  so far as to observe that \"the theatre is a better school of moral  sentiment than churches.\" The drama, therefore, has a right to find a  place; and to its professors are we indebted for what may justly be  considered one of the highest of all intellectual gratifications.

How many a mortal bears a heavy chain,    Of bitter sorrow, 'neath thy iron reign,    And many a one, whose harder fate has given,    Some early woes, by thee to madness driven,    Sees the sad vision of some bygone day,    And thinks on what he hath seen with dismay:    So some lone murderer, wanders o'er the world    By thy dread arm to desperation hurl'd;    In vain he prays, or bends the lowly knee,    With fiendlike power, thou dragg'st him back with thee,    Point'st to some scene of early guilt and woe,    Opening the source from whence his sorrows flow.    As round the bark which feels the tempest's shock,    The lightning plays, and shows the fatal rock,    So memory brings our sorrows all to light    With vivid truth presents them to the sight;    Pursues the wretch who else some joy might find,    To fix her seat of empire in his mind.    As desert lakes in sad illusion fly,    Before the weary traveller's cheated eye    So memory shows, those hopes we still would cherish.    Pleased but to fade, allured us but to perish.
