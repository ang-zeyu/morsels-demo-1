And then the bray of brazen horns                                         5  Arose above their clanking march,  As the long waving column filed  Into the odorous purple dusk.    O lover, in this radiant world  Whence is the race of mortal men,                                        10  So frail, so mighty, and so fond,  That fleets into the vast unknown?          LXX      My lover smiled, \"O friend, ask not  The journey's end, nor whence we are.  That whistling boy who minds his goats  So idly in the grey ravine,    \"The brown-backed rower drenched with spray,                              5  The lemon-seller in the street,  And the young girl who keeps her first  Wild love-tryst at the rising moon,--    \"Lo, these are wiser than the wise.  And not for all our questioning                                          10  Shall we discover more than joy,  Nor find a better thing than love!    \"Let pass the banners and the spears,  The hate, the battle, and the greed;  For greater than all gifts is peace,                                     15  And strength is in the tranquil mind.\"          LXXI      Ye who have the stable world  In the keeping of your hands.  Flocks and men, the lasting hills,  And the ever-wheeling stars;    Ye who freight with wondrous things                                       5  The wide-wandering heart of man  And the galleon of the moon,  On those silent seas of foam;    Oh, if ever ye shall grant  Time and place and room enough                                           10  To this fond and fragile heart  Stifled with the throb of love,    On that day one grave-eyed Fate,  Pausing in her toil, shall say,  \"Lo, one mortal has achieved                                             15  Immortality of love!\"          LXXII      I heard the gods reply:  \"Trust not the future with its perilous chance;  The fortunate hour is on the dial now.    \"To-day be wise and great,  And put off hesitation and go forth                                       5  With cheerful courage for the diurnal need.    \"Stout be the heart, nor slow  The foot to follow the impetuous will,  Nor the hand slack upon the loom of deeds.    \"Then may the Fates look up                                              10  And smile a little in their tolerant way,  Being full of infinite regard for men.\"          LXXIII      The sun on the tide, the peach on the bough,  The blue smoke over the hill,  And the shadows trailing the valley-side,  Make up the autumn day.    Ah, no, not half! Thou art not here                                       5  Under the bronze beech-leaves,  And thy lover's soul like a lonely child  Roams through an empty room.          LXXIV      If death be good,  Why do the gods not die?  If life be ill,  Why do the gods still live?    If love be naught,                                                        5  Why do the gods still love?  If love be all,  What should men do but love?          LXXV      Tell me what this life means,  O my prince and lover,  With the autumn sunlight  On thy bronze-gold head?    With thy clear voice sounding                                             5  Through the silver twilight,--  What is the lost secret  Of the tacit earth?          LXXVI      Ye have heard how Marsyas,  In the folly of his pride,  Boasted of a matchless skill,--  When the great god's back was turned;    How his fond imagining                                                    5  Fell to ashes cold and grey,  When the flawless player came  In serenity and light.    So it was with those I loved  In the years ere I loved thee.                                           10  Many a saying sounds like truth,  Until Truth itself is heard.    Many a beauty only lives  Until Beauty passes by,  And the mortal is forgot                                                 15  In the shadow of the god.          LXXVII      Hour by hour I sit,  Watching the silent door.  Shadows go by on the wall,  And steps in the street.    Expectation and doubt                                                     5  Flutter my timorous heart.  So many hurrying home--  And thou still away.          LXXVIII      Once in the shining street,  In the heart of a seaboard town,  As I waited, behold, there came  The woman I loved.    As when, in the early spring,                                             5  A daffodil blooms in the grass,  Golden and gracious and glad,  The solitude smiled.          LXXIX      How strange is love, O my lover!  With what enchantment and power  Does it not come upon mortals,  Learned or heedless!    How far away and unreal,                                                  5  Faint as blue isles in a sunset  Haze-golden, all else of life seems,  Since I have known thee!          LXXX      How to say I love you:  What, if I but live it,  Were the use in that, love?    Small, indeed.    Only, every moment                                                        5  Of this waking lifetime  Let me be your lover    And your friend!    Ah, but then, as sure as  Blossom breaks from bud-sheath,                                          10  When along the hillside    Spring returns,    Golden speech should flower  From the soul so cherished,  And the mouth your kisses                                                15    Filled with fire.          LXXXI      Hark, love, to the tambourines  Of the minstrels in the street,  And one voice that throbs and soars  Clear above the clashing time!    Some Egyptian royal love-lilt,                                            5  Some Sidonian refrain,  Vows of Paphos or of Tyre,  Mount against the silver sun.    Pleading, piercing, yet serene,  Vagrant in a foreign town,                                               10  From what passion was it born,  In what lost land over sea?          LXXXII      Over the roofs the honey-coloured moon,  With purple shadows on the silver grass,    And the warm south-wind on the curving sea,  While we two, lovers past all turmoil now,    Watch from the window the white sails come in,                            5  Bearing what unknown ventures safe to port!    So falls the hour of twilight and of love  With wizardry to loose the hearts of men,    And there is nothing more in this great world  Than thou and I, and the blue dome of dusk.                              10          LXXXIII      In the quiet garden world,  Gold sunlight and shadow leaves  Flicker on the wall.    And the wind, a moment since,  With rose-petals strewed the path                                         5  And the open door.    Now the moon-white butterflies  Float across the liquid air,  Glad as in a dream;    And, across thy lover's heart,                                           10  Visions of one scarlet mouth  With its maddening smile.          LXXXIV      Soft was the wind in the beech-trees;  Low was the surf on the shore;  In the blue dusk one planet  Like a great sea-pharos shone.    But nothing to me were the sea-sounds,                                    5  The wind and the yellow star,  When over my breast the banner  Of your golden hair was spread.          LXXXV      Have you heard the news of Sappho's garden,  And the Golden Rose of Mitylene,  Which the bending brown-armed rowers lately  Brought from over sea, from lonely Pontus?    In a meadow by the river Halys,                                           5  Where some wood-god hath the world in keeping,  On a burning summer noon they found her,  Lovely as a Dryad, and more tender.    Her these eyes have seen, and not another  Shall behold, till time takes all things goodly,                         10  So surpassing fair and fond and wondrous,--  Such a slave as, worth a great king's ransom,    No man yet of all the sons of mortals  But would lose his soul for and regret not;  So hath Beauty compassed all her children                                15  With the cords of longing and desire.    Only Hermes, master of word music,  Ever yet in glory of gold language  Could ensphere the magical remembrance  Of her melting, half sad, wayward beauty,                                20    Or devise the silver phrase to frame her,  The inevitable name to call her,  Half a sigh and half a kiss when whispered,  Like pure air that feeds a forge's hunger.    Not a painter in the Isles of Hellas                                     25  Could portray her, mix the golden tawny  With bright stain of poppies, or ensanguine  Like the life her darling mouth's vermilion,    So that, in the ages long hereafter,  When we shall be dust of perished summers,                               30  Any man could say who found that likeness,  Smiling gently on it, \"This was Gorgo!\"          LXXXVI      Love is so strong a thing,  The very gods must yield,  When it is welded fast  With the unflinching truth.    Love is so frail a thing,                                                 5  A word, a look, will kill.  Oh lovers, have a care  How ye do deal with love.          LXXXVII      Hadst thou, with all thy loveliness, been true,  Had I, with all my tenderness, been strong,  We had not made this ruin out of life,  This desolation in a world of joy,    My poor Gorgo.                                                          5    Yet even the high gods at times do err;  Be therefore thou not overcome with woe,  But dedicate anew to greater love  An equal heart, and be thy radiant self    Once more, Gorgo.                                                      10          LXXXVIII      As, on a morn, a traveller might emerge  From the deep green seclusion of the hills,  By a cool road through forest and through fern,  Little frequented, winding, followed long  With joyous expectation and day-dreams,                                   5  And on a sudden, turning a great rock  Covered with frondage, dark with dripping water,  Behold the seaboard full of surf and sound,  With all the space and glory of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1239"],[0,"The Spirit of the Border: A Romance of the Early Settlers in the Ohio Valley (#6)"],[1,"rafts, yet Nell had seen him  smiling at her many times during the journey, and he had found time  before the early start to arrange for her a comfortable seat. There  was now a solicitude in the frontiersman's voice that touched her.    \"I am famished,\" she replied, with her bright smile. \"I am afraid I  could eat a whole deer.\"    They all climbed the sandy slope, and found themselves on the summit  of an oval island, with a pretty glade in the middle surrounded by  birches. Bill, the second raftsman, a stolid, silent man, at once  swung his axe upon a log of driftwood. Mr. Wells and Jim walked to  and fro under the birches, and Kate and Nell sat on the grass  watching with great interest the old helmsman as he came up from the  river, his brown hands and face shining from the scrubbing he had  given them. Soon he had a fire cheerfully blazing, and after laying  out the few utensils, he addressed himself to Joe:    \"I'll tell ye right here, lad, good venison kin be spoiled by bad  cuttin' and cookin'. You're slicin' it too thick. See--thar! Now  salt good, an' keep outen the flame; on the red coals is best.\"    With a sharpened stick Jeff held the thin slices over the fire for a  few moments. Then he laid them aside on some clean white-oak chips  Bill's axe had provided. The simple meal of meat, bread, and  afterward a drink of the cold spring water, was keenly relished by  the hungry voyagers. When it had been eaten, Jeff threw a log on the  fire and remarked:    \"Seein' as how we won't be in redskin territory fer awhile yit, we  kin hev a fire. I'll allow ye'll all be chilly and damp from  river-mist afore long, so toast yerselves good.\"    \"How far have we come to-day?\" inquired Mr. Wells, his mind always  intent on reaching the scene of his cherished undertaking.    \"'Bout thirty-odd mile, I reckon. Not much on a trip, thet's sartin,  but we'll pick up termorrer. We've some quicker water, an' the rafts  hev to go separate.\"    \"How quiet!\" exclaimed Kate, suddenly breaking the silence that  followed the frontiersman's answer.    \"Beautiful!\" impetuously said Nell, looking up at Joe. A quick flash  from his gray eyes answered her; he did not speak; indeed he had  said little to her since the start, but his glance showed her how  glad he was that she felt the sweetness and content of this wild  land.    \"I was never in a wilderness before,\" broke in the earnest voice of  the young minister. \"I feel an almost overpowering sense of  loneliness. I want to get near to you all; I feel lost. Yet it is  grand, sublime!\"    \"Here is the promised land--the fruitful life--Nature as it was  created by God,\" replied the old minister, impressively.    \"Tell us a story,\" said Nell to the old frontiersman, as he once  more joined the circle round the fire.    \"So, little 'un, ye want a story?\" queried Jeff, taking up a live  coal and placing it in the bowl of his pipe. He took off his  coon-skin cap and carefully laid it aside. His weather-beaten face  beamed in answer to the girl's request. He drew a long and audible  pull at his black pipe, and send forth slowly a cloud of white  smoke. Deliberately poking the fire with a stick, as if stirring  into life dead embers of the past, he sucked again at his pipe, and  emitted a great puff of smoke that completely enveloped the grizzled  head. From out that white cloud came his drawling voice.    \"Ye've seen thet big curly birch over thar--thet 'un as bends kind  of sorrowful like. Wal, it used to stand straight an' proud. I've  knowed thet tree all the years I've navigated this river, an' it  seems natural like to me thet it now droops dyin', fer it shades the  grave of as young, an' sweet, an' purty a lass as yerself, Miss  Nell. Rivermen called this island George's Island, 'cause Washington  onct camped here; but of late years the name's got changed, an' the  men say suthin' like this: 'We'll try an' make Milly's birch afore  sundown,' jest as Bill and me hev done to-day. Some years agone I  was comin' up from Fort Henry, an' had on board my slow old scow a  lass named Milly--we never learned her other name. She come to me at  the fort, an' tells as how her folks hed been killed by Injuns, an'  she wanted to git back to Pitt to meet her sweetheart. I was ag'in  her comin' all along, an' fust off I said 'No.' But when I seen  tears in her blue eyes, an' she puts her little hand on mine, I jest  wilted, an' says to Jim Blair, 'She goes.' Wal, jest as might hev  been expected--an' fact is I looked fer it--we wus tackled by  redskins. Somehow, Jim Girty got wind of us hevin' a lass aboard,  an' he ketched up with us jest below here. It's a bad place, called  Shawnee Rock, an' I'll show it to ye termorrer. The renegade, with  his red devils, attacked us thar, an' we had a time gittin' away.  Milly wus shot. She lived fer awhile, a couple of days, an' all the  time wus so patient, an' sweet, an' brave with thet renegade's  bullet in her--fer he shot her when he seen he couldn't capture  her--thet thar wusn't a blame man of us who wouldn't hev died to  grant her prayer, which wus that she could live to onct more see her  lover.\"    There was a long silence, during which the old frontiersman sat  gazing into the fire with sad eyes.    \"We couldn't do nuthin', an' we buried her thar under thet birch,  where she smiled her last sad, sweet smile, an' died. Ever since  then the river has been eatn' away at this island. It's only half as  big as it wus onct, an' another flood will take away this sand-bar,  these few birches--an' Milly's grave.\"    The old frontiersman's story affected all his listeners. The elder  minister bowed his head and prayed that no such fate might overtake  his nieces. The young minister looked again, as he had many times  that day, at Nell's winsome face. The girls cast grave glances at  the drooping birch, and their bright tears glistened in the  fire-glow. Once more Joe's eyes glinted with that steely flash, and  as he gazed out over the wide, darkening expanse of water his face  grew cold and rigid.    \"I'll allow I might hev told a more cheerful story, an' I'll do so  next time; but I wanted ye all, particular the lasses, to know  somethin' of the kind of country ye're goin' into. The frontier  needs women; but jist yit it deals hard with them. An' Jim Girty,  with more of his kind, ain't dead yit.\"    \"Why don't some one kill him?\" was Joe's sharp question.    \"Easier said than done, lad. Jim Girty is a white traitor, but he's  a cunnin' an' fierce redskin in his ways an' life. He knows the  woods as a crow does, an' keeps outer sight 'cept when he's least  expected. Then ag'in, he's got Simon Girty, his brother, an' almost  the whole redskin tribe behind him. Injuns stick close to a white  man that has turned ag'inst his own people, an' Jim Girty hain't  ever been ketched. Howsumever, I heard last trip thet he'd been  tryin' some of his tricks round Fort Henry, an' thet Wetzel is on  his trail. Wal, if it's so thet Lew Wetzel is arter him, I wouldn't  give a pinch o' powder fer the white-redskin's chances of a long  life.\"    No one spoke, and Jeff, after knocking the ashes from his pipe, went  down to the raft, returning shortly afterward with his blanket. This  he laid down and rolled himself in it. Presently from under his  coon-skin cap came the words:    \"Wal, I've turned in, an' I advise ye all to do the same.\"    All save Joe and Nell acted on Jeff's suggestion. For a long time  the young couple sat close together on the bank, gazing at the  moonlight on the river.    The night was perfect. A cool wind fanned the dying embers of the  fire and softly stirred the leaves. Earlier in the evening a single  frog had voiced his protest against the loneliness; but now his  dismal croak was no longer heard. A snipe, belated in his feeding,  ran along the sandy shore uttering his tweet-tweet, and his little  cry, breaking in so softly on the silence, seemed only to make more  deeply felt the great vast stillness of the night.    Joe's arm was around Nell. She had demurred at first, but he gave no  heed to her slight resistance, and finally her head rested against  his shoulder. There was no need of words.    Joe had a pleasurable sense of her nearness, and there was a delight  in the fragrance of her hair as it waved against his cheek; but just  then love was not uppermost in his mind. All day he had been silent  under the force of an emotion which he could not analyze. Some  power, some feeling in which the thought of Nell had no share, was  drawing him with irresistible strength. Nell had just begun to  surrender to him in the sweetness of her passion; and yet even with  that knowledge knocking reproachfully at his heart, he could not  help being absorbed in the shimmering water, in the dark reflection  of the trees, the gloom and shadow of the forest.    Presently he felt her form relax in his arms; then her soft regular  breathing told him she had fallen asleep and he laughed low to  himself. How she would pout on the morrow when he teased her about  it! Then, realizing that she was tired with her long day's journey,  he reproached himself for keeping her from the needed rest, and  instantly decided to carry her to the raft. Yet such was the novelty  of the situation that he yielded to its charm, and did not go at  once. The moonlight found bright threads in her wavy hair; it shone  caressingly on her quiet face, and tried to steal under the downcast  lashes.    Joe made a movement to rise with her, when she muttered indistinctly  as if speaking to some one. He remembered then she had once told him  that she talked in her sleep, and how greatly it annoyed her. He  might hear something more with which to tease her; so he listened.    \"Yes--uncle--I will go--Kate, we must--go. . .\"    Another interval of silence, then more murmurings. He distinguished  his own name, and presently she called clearly, as if answering some  inward questioner.    \"I--lov"]]]
