Ferragus, who had slain Argalia, came up raging with jealousy, and a  combat ensued which awoke the sleeper. Terrified at what she beheld, she  rushed to her palfrey; and while the fighters were occupied with one  another, fled away through the forest.    Fast fled the beauty in the direction taken by Rinaldo; nor did she  cease travelling, by one conveyance or another, till she reached her own  country, whither she had sent Malagigi. Him she freed from his prison,  on condition that he would employ his art for the purpose of bringing  Rinaldo to a palace of hers, which she possessed in an island; and  accordingly Rinaldo was inveigled by a spirit into an enchanted barque,  which he found on a sea-shore, and which conveyed him, without any  visible pilot, into Joyous Palace (for so the island was called).    The whole island was a garden, fifteen miles in extent. It was full of  trees and lawns; and on the western side, close to the sea, was the  palace, built of a marble so clear and polished, that it reflected the  landscape round about. Rinaldo, not knowing what to think of his strange  conveyance, lost no time in leaping to shore; upon which a lady made her  appearance, who invited him within. The house was a most beautiful house,  full of rooms adorned with azure and gold, and with noble paintings;  and within as well as without it were the loveliest flowers, the purest  fountains, and a fragrance fit to turn sorrow to joy. The lady led the  knight into an apartment painted with stories, and opening to the garden  through pillars of crystal with golden capitals. Here he found a bevy of  ladies, three of whom were singing in concert, while another played on  some foreign instrument of exquisite accord, and the rest were dancing  round about them. When the ladies beheld him coming, they turned the  dance into a circuit round about himself; and then one of them, in the  sweetest manner, said, \"Sir knight, the tables are set, and the hour  for the banquet is come:\" and with these words they all drew him, still  dancing, across the lawn in front of the apartment, to a table that was  spread with cloth of gold and fine linen, under a bower of damask roses,  by the side of a fountain.[9]    Four ladies were already seated there, who rose and placed Rinaldo  at their head, in a chair set with pearls. And truly indeed was he  astonished. A repast ensued, consisting of viands the most delicate, and  wines as fragrant as they were fine, drunk out of jewelled cups; and  when it drew towards its conclusion, harps and lutes were heard in the  distance, and one of the ladies said in the knight's ear, \"This house,  and all that you see in it, are yours. For you alone was it built, and  the builder is a queen; and happy indeed must you think yourself, for  she loves you, and she is the greatest beauty in the world. Her name is  Angelica.\"    The moment Rinaldo heard the name he so detested, disgust and  wretchedness fell upon his heart, notwithstanding the joys around him. He  started up with a changed countenance, and, in spite of all that the lady  could say, broke off across the garden, and never ceased hastening till  he reached the place where he landed. He would have thrown himself into  the sea, rather than stay any longer in that island; but the enchanted  barque was still on the shore. He sprang into it, and attempted instantly  to push off, for he still saw nobody in it but himself; but the barque  for a while resisted his efforts; till, on his feeling a wish to drown  himself, or to do any thing rather than return to that detested house, it  suddenly loosed itself from its moorings, and dashed away with him over  the sea, as if in a fury.    All night did the pilotless barque dash on, till it reached, in the  morning, a distant shore covered with a gloomy forest. Here Rinaldo,  surrounded by enchantments of a very different sort from those which he  had lately resisted, was entrapped into a pit. The pit belonged to a  castle which was hung with human heads, and painted red with blood; and  as the Paladin was calling upon God to help him, a hideous white-headed  old woman, of a spiteful countenance, made her appearance on the edge of  the pit, and told him that he must fight with a monster born of Death and  Desire.    \"Be it so,\" said the Paladin. \"Let me but remain armed as I am, and I  fear nothing.\" For Rinaldo had with him his renowned sword Fusberta.[10]    The old woman laughed in derision. Rinaldo remained in the den all night,  and next day was taken to a place where a portcullis was lifted up, and  the monster rushed forth. He was a mixture of hog and serpent, larger  than an ox, and not to be looked at without horror. He had eyes like a  traitor, the hands of a man, but clawed, a beard dabbled with blood, a  skin of coarse variegated colours, too hard to be cut through, and two  horns on his temples, which he could turn on all sides of him at his  pleasure, and which were so sharp that they cut like a sword.    Rising on his hind-legs, and opening a mouth six palms in width, this  horrible beast fell heavily on Rinaldo, who was nevertheless quick enough  to give it a blow on the snout which increased its fury. Returning the  knight a tremendous cuff, it seized his coat of mail between breast and  shoulder, and tore away a great strip of it down to the girdle,  leaving the skin bare. Every successive rent and blow was of the like  irresistible violence; and though the Paladin himself never fought with  more force and fury, he lost blood every instant. The monster at length  tearing his sword out of his hand, the Paladin surely began to think that  his last hour was arrived.    Looking about to see what might possibly help him, he observed overhead  a beam sticking out of a wall at the height of some ten feet. He took a  leap more than human; and reaching the beam with his hand, succeeded in  flinging himself up across it. Here he sat for hours, the furious brute  continually trying to reach him. Night-time then came on with a clear  starry sky and moonlight, and the Paladin could discern no way of  escaping, when he heard a sound of something, he knew not what, coming  through the air like a bird. Suddenly a female figure stood on the end of  the beam, holding something in her hand towards him, and speaking in a  loving voice.    It was Angelica, come with means for destroying the monster, and carrying  the knight away.    But the moment Rinaldo saw her, desperate as seemed to be his condition,  he renounced all offers of her assistance; and at length became so  exasperated with her good offices, especially when she opened her arms  and offered to bear him away in them, that he threatened to cast himself  down to the monster if she did not go away.[11]    Angelica, saying that she would lose her life rather than displease him,  descended from the beam; and having given the monster a cake of wax which  fastened up his teeth, and then caught and fixed him in a set of nooses  she had brought for that purpose, took her miserable departure. Rinaldo  upon this got down from the beam himself; and having succeeded, though  with the greatest difficulty, in beating and squeezing the life out of  the monster, dealt such havoc among the people of the castle who  assailed him, that the horrible old woman, whose crimes had made her the  creature's housekeeper, and led her to take delight in its cruelty, threw  herself headlong from a tower. The Paladin then took his way forth,  turning his back on the castle and the sea-shore.    Angelica returned to the capital of her father's dominion, Albracca; and  the pertinacity of others in seeking her love being as great as that of  hers for Rinaldo, she found King Galafron, in a short time, besieged  there for her sake, by the fierce Agrican, king of Tartary.    In a short time a jealous feud sprang up between the loving friends  Rinaldo and Orlando; and Angelica, torn with conflicting emotions, from  her dread on her father's account as well as her own, and her aversion  to every knight but her detester, was at one time compelled to apply to  Orlando for assistance, and at another, being afraid that he would have  the better of Rinaldo in combat, to send him away on a perilous adventure  elsewhere, with a promise of accepting his love should he succeed.[12]  Orlando went, but not before he had slain Agrican and delivered Albracca.  Circumstances, however, again took him with her to a distance, as the  reader will see, ere he could bring her to perform her promise; and the  Paladins in general having again been scattered abroad, it happened that  Rinaldo a second time found himself in the forest of Arden; and here,  without expecting it, he became an altered man; for he now tasted a very  different stream from that which had given him his hate for Angelica;  namely, the one which had made her fall in love with himself. He was led  to do this by a very extraordinary adventure.    In the thick of the forest he had come upon a mead full of flowers, in  which there was a naked youth, singing in the midst of three damsels, who  were naked also, and who were dancing round about him. They had bunches  of flowers in their hands, and garlands on their heads; and as they  were thus delighting themselves, with faces full of love and joy, they  suddenly changed countenance on seeing Rinaldo. \"Behold,\" cried they, \"the  traitor! Behold him, villain that he is, and the scorner of all delights!  He has fallen into the net at last.\" With these words they fell upon him  with the flowers like so many furies; and tender as such scourges might  be thought, every blow which the roses and violets gave him, every fresh  stroke of the lilies and the hyacinths, smote him to the very heart, and  filled his veins with fire. The flowers in the bands of the nymphs  being exhausted, the youth gave him a blow on the helmet with a tall  garden-lily, which felled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10657"],[0,"\"De Bello Gallico\" and Other Commentaries (#6)"],[1,"territories, and arranges that they should give hostages to each  other--the Sequani not to obstruct the Helvetii in their march--the  Helvetii, to pass without mischief and outrage.    X.--It-is again told Caesar that the Helvetii intend to march through  the country of the Sequani and the Aedui into the territories of the  Santones, which are not far distant from those boundaries of the  Tolosates, which [viz. Tolosa, Toulouse] is a state in the Province. If  this took place, he saw that it would be attended with great danger to  the Province to have warlike men, enemies of the Roman people, bordering  upon an open and very fertile tract of country. For these reasons he  appointed Titus Labienus, his lieutenant, to the command of the  fortification which he had made. He himself proceeds to Italy by forced  marches, and there levies two legions, and leads out from winter-quarters  three which were wintering around Aquileia, and with these five  legions marches rapidly by the nearest route across the Alps into  Further Gaul. Here the Centrones and the Graioceli and the Caturiges,  having taken possession of the higher parts, attempt to obstruct the  army in their march. After having routed these in several battles, he  arrives in the territories of the Vocontii in the Further Province on  the seventh day from Ocelum, which is the most remote town of the Hither  Province; thence he leads his army into the country of the Allobroges,  and from the Allobroges to the Segusiani. These people are the first  beyond the Province on the opposite side of the Rhone.    XI.--The Helvetii had by this time led their forces over through the  narrow defile and the territories of the Sequani, and had arrived at the  territories of the Aedui, and were ravaging their lands. The Aedui, as  they could not defend themselves and their possessions against them,  send ambassadors to Caesar to ask assistance, [pleading] that they had  at all times so well deserved of the Roman people, that their fields  ought not to have been laid waste--their children carried off into  slavery--their towns stormed, almost within sight of our army. At the  same time the Ambarri, the friends and kinsmen of the Aedui, apprise  Caesar that it was not easy for them, now that their fields had been  devastated, to ward off the violence of the enemy from their towns: the  Allobroges likewise, who had villages and possessions on the other side  of the Rhone, betake themselves in flight to Caesar and assure him that  they had nothing remaining, except the soil of their land. Caesar,  induced by these circumstances, decides that he ought not to wait until  the Helvetii, after destroying all the property of his allies, should  arrive among the Santones.    XII.--There is a river [called] the Saone, which flows through the  territories of the Aedui and Sequani into the Rhone with such incredible  slowness, that it cannot be determined by the eye in which direction it  flows. This the Helvetii were crossing by rafts and boats joined  together. When Caesar was informed by spies that the Helvetii had  already conveyed three parts of their forces across that river, but that  the fourth part was left behind on this side of the Saone, he set out  from the camp with three legions during the third watch, and came up  with that division which had not yet crossed the river. Attacking them,  encumbered with baggage, and not expecting him, he cut to pieces a great  part of them; the rest betook themselves to flight, and concealed  themselves in the nearest woods. That canton [which was cut down] was  called the Tigurine; for the whole Helvetian state is divided into four  cantons. This single canton having left their country, within the  recollection of our fathers, had slain Lucius Cassius the consul, and  had made his army pass under the yoke [B.C. 107]. Thus, whether by  chance, or by the design of the immortal gods, that part of the  Helvetian state which had brought a signal calamity upon the Roman  people was the first to pay the penalty. In this Caesar avenged not only  the public, but also his own personal wrongs, because the Tigurini had  slain Lucius Piso the lieutenant [of Cassius], the grandfather of Lucius  Calpurnius Piso, his [Caesar's] father-in-law, in the same battle as  Cassius himself.    XIII.--This battle ended, that he might be able to come up with the  remaining forces of the Helvetii, he procures a bridge to be made across  the Saone, and thus leads his army over. The Helvetii, confused by his  sudden arrival, when they found that he had effected in one day what  they themselves had with the utmost difficulty accomplished in twenty,  namely, the crossing of the river, send ambassadors to him; at the head  of which embassy was Divico, who had been commander of the Helvetii in  the war against Cassius. He thus treats with Caesar:--that, \"if the  Roman people would make peace with the Helvetii they would go to that  part and there remain, where Caesar might appoint and desire them to be;  but if he should persist in persecuting them with war, that he ought to  remember both the ancient disgrace of the Roman people and the  characteristic valour of the Helvetii. As to his having attacked one  canton by surprise, [at a time] when those who had crossed the river  could not bring assistance to their friends, that he ought not on that  account to ascribe very much to his own valour, or despise them; that  they had so learned from their sires and ancestors, as to rely more on  valour than on artifice or stratagem. Wherefore let him not bring it to  pass that the place, where they were standing, should acquire a name,  from the disaster of the Roman people and the destruction of their army  or transmit the remembrance [of such an event to posterity].\"    XIV.--To these words Caesar thus replied:--that \"on that very account he  felt less hesitation, because he kept in remembrance those circumstances  which the Helvetian ambassadors had mentioned, and that he felt the more  indignant at them, in proportion as they had happened undeservedly to  the Roman people: for if they had been conscious of having done any  wrong it would not have been difficult to be on their guard, but for  that very reason had they been deceived, because neither were they aware  that any offence had been given by them, on account of which they should  be afraid, nor did they think that they ought to be afraid without  cause. But even if he were willing to forget their former outrage, could  he also lay aside the remembrance of the late wrongs, in that they had  against his will attempted a route through the Province by force, in  that they had molested the Aedui, the Ambarri, and the Allobroges? That  as to their so insolently boasting of their victory, and as to their  being astonished that they had so long committed their outrages with  impunity, [both these things] tended to the same point; for the immortal  gods are wont to allow those persons whom they wish to punish for their  guilt sometimes a greater prosperity and longer impunity, in order that  they may suffer the more severely from a reverse of circumstances.  Although these things are so, yet, if hostages were to be given him by  them in order that he may be assured they will do what they promise, and  provided they will give satisfaction to the Aedui for the outrages which  they had committed against them and their allies, and likewise to the  Allobroges, he [Caesar] will make peace with them.\" Divico replied, that  \"the Helvetii had been so trained by their ancestors that they were  accustomed to receive, not to give, hostages; of that fact the Roman  people were witness.\" Having given this reply, he withdrew.    XV.--On the following day they move their camp from that place; Caesar  does the same, and sends forward all his cavalry, to the number of four  thousand (which he had drawn together from all parts of the Province and  from the Aedui and their allies), to observe towards what parts the  enemy are directing their march. These, having too eagerly pursued the  enemy's rear, come to a battle with the cavalry of the Helvetii in a  disadvantageous place, and a few of our men fall. The Helvetii, elated  with this battle because they had with five hundred horse repulsed so  large a body of horse, began to face us more boldly, sometimes too from  their rear to provoke our men by an attack. Caesar [however] restrained  his men from battle, deeming it sufficient for the present to prevent  the enemy from rapine, forage, and depredation. They marched for about  fifteen days in such a manner that there was not more than five or six  miles between the enemy's rear and our van.    XVI.--Meanwhile, Caesar kept daily importuning the Aedui for the corn  which they had promised in the name of their state; for, in consequence  of the coldness (Gaul being, as before said, situated towards the  north), not only was the corn in the fields not ripe, but there was not  in store a sufficiently large quantity even of fodder: besides he was  unable to use the corn which he had conveyed in ships up the river  Saone, because the Helvetii, from whom he was unwilling to retire, had  diverted their march from the Saone. The Aedui kept deferring from day  to day, and saying that it was being \"collected--brought in--on the  road.\" When he saw that he was put off too long, and that the day was  close at hand on which he ought to serve out the corn to his soldiers,--  having called together their chiefs, of whom he had a great number in  his camp, among them Divitiacus, and Liscus who was invested with the  chief magistracy (whom the Aedui style the Vergobretus, and who is  elected annually, and has power of life and death over his countrymen),  he severely reprimands them, because he is not assisted by them on so  urgent an occasion, when the enemy were so close at hand, and when  [corn] could neither be bought nor taken from the fields, particularly  "]]]
