[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13347"],[0,"Wildflowers of the Farm (#6)"],[1,"ued_)      There are many other grasses in the field; some of them are useful,  while others the farmer would call weeds. We must now look at other  flowers, and, as the grass is so tall, it will be better to choose tall  flowers which can easily be seen. We soon spy a Thistle among the grass  near the gate.    There are several kinds of Thistle in England--the Milk Thistle, the  Nodding Thistle, and some others. This is the common Field Thistle. It  is far too common to please Mr. Hammond or any other careful farmer. It  is true that it is only an annual; but, like the Dandelion, it has a  pappus attached to its seed. However hard Mr. Hammond tries to get rid  of thistles from his fields, fresh seeds are constantly blown into them  from thistles on the road-side banks, or in the fields of farmers not so  careful as himself. It is very disheartening to a good farmer to have  careless neighbours. When Mr. Hammond hears that a new tenant is coming  to a neighbouring farm, he always hopes that he will be a \"clean\"  farmer--that he will try to keep his fields free from weeds.    The stiff stem of the Thistle is often three or four feet tall, and  divides into smaller branches which bear a flower at the end. These  flowers are a little like those of the Red Clover; each blossom has many  small upright florets, purplish-red in colour. The leaves are not very  tempting to touch, but they are very interesting. They are divided into  several lobes or divisions, and each lobe ends in a sharp point. They  have no leaf stem to connect them with the stalk of the plant. What is  curious about them is that they do not grow from a small point on the  stalk. They are \"decurrent,\" or running along the stalk; a broad strip  at the base of each leaf is attached to the stalk.    Docks too are far too numerous among the grass. They are very  troublesome weeds; they are perennials, and they also scatter a great  deal of seed. They have large clusters of small flowers without any true  petals. The leaves are very large and pointed, growing on long leaf  stems. The stems of the Dock are tough, and they blunt the mowers'  scythes and the knives of the mowing-machine.    Some people have a good word even for the Dock. They say that a Dock  leaf wrapped round the part stung by a nettle will lessen the pain;  others advise us to rub the part with Dock _seed._ I do not think myself  that either remedy has much effect; but the leaves of the Sorrel, which  is a relative of the Dock, _will_ lessen the pain of nettle stings. Mrs.  Hammond always uses Dock leaves to wrap round the pats of butter which  she sends to market.    Above us, in the hedge, are two of the sweetest flowers of the farm. The  pink Dog Rose is one. The petals of each blossom are five in  number--what a number of five-petalled flowers we have seen! The leaves  have five, or sometimes seven, serrated leaflets, one of which is always  at the end of the leaf stem. These leaflets are not always perfectly  straight; sometimes the pointed end turns a good deal to one side.    Of course we want to gather some of the flowers--who does not want to  gather Roses? We want some fully opened blossoms and many of the dainty  buds. But the straggling stems of the Rose soon teach us the truth of  the proverb: \"No Rose without a Thorn.\" The stems are thickly covered  with thorns; these are not only sharp, but hooked as well, and we do not  get our bunch of roses without a scratch or two.    The other beauty of the hedge is the Honey-suckle--a lovely flower which  may also be a dangerous weed. The tight grasp of its strong twining stem  will soon seriously injure any young tree to which it clings. Here it is  doing little harm, and we need only think of the clusters of fragrant  flowers. Each cluster grows at the end of a stalk. Some are pale pink,  others golden yellow, while some are almost white. After the blossom  comes the bright red berry which contains the seed. The leaves grow in  pairs. Those low down on the stem have leaf stalks, but the upper ones  are sessile on the stem.    Taking care not to trample the grass, we have strolled down the  hedge-side till we have reached the other end of the field, where there  is a ditch. At once there is a fragrant scent in the air--a scent like  that of almonds. It is the Meadow Sweet which grows on the banks of  streams or damp ditches.    [Illustration: MEADOW SWEET.]    It is a beautiful plant, as well as a fragrant one. At the top of the  tall stems are large clusters of small five-petalled flowers,  creamy-white. The stem itself is handsome; it is often three or four  feet high, smooth, stout, and of a reddish colour. The large leaves grow  alternately on the stem; they are made up of several pairs of leaflets  with a single leaflet at the end. The upper surface of the leaves is  dark green, but the under side is generally covered with a soft white  down.    The scent of Meadow Sweet is very pleasant in the field to-day, but I  think we should find it rather too strong if we took a bunch into the  house. Yet Queen Elizabeth is said to have loved Meadow Sweet strewn on  the floors of her apartments.          CHAPTER IX    IN THE CORN-FIELD      One morning early in July, while we are having breakfast at Willow Farm,  we ask Mr. Hammond if he thinks we shall find any flowers in his  wheat-field. The farmer laughs and says he hopes we shall not, but he is  very much afraid that we shall. As we are here on purpose to look for  flowers we are glad to find them anywhere. Mr. Hammond thinks more about  his crops than about flowers, and does not care to see a single blossom  in his corn, however pretty it may be.    We are soon at the field, and there is no mistake about the flowers  being there too. Close to the gate, where the wheat is not quite so  thick as elsewhere, there is a splendid patch of scarlet poppies. This  is perhaps the very brightest wild flower that we have.    Some plants, as we have seen, are annuals, others are perennials. An  annual only lives for one year. The plant springs up from the seed,  grows through the summer, and in the autumn or the winter dies. A  perennial lives for many years. The flowers fade and fall as those of  annuals do; even the leaves and stems may droop and die. The roots and  lower part of the stem do not die; they live in the ground through the  winter, and in the following year fresh stems appear. The White Clover  which we found in Ashmead is a perennial, the Crimson Clover is an  annual.    If you sowed a patch of your garden with Poppy seed you would have the  flowers growing there year after year. You might therefore say, \"Surely  the Poppy is a perennial. I only sowed the seed one year, yet the  poppies appear again and again.\" That is because the plants sowed their  own seed. The flowers faded; then the seed-cases shed their seed upon  the ground. Next spring the seeds produced fresh plants. Most annual  wild flowers sow their own seed in this way, but we must not mistake  them for perennials because year after year they grow in the same place.    In your patch of garden you can easily prevent the poppies from growing  more than one year if you wish to do so. All that is necessary is to  pick off every flower before it fades. Then no seed will fall and you  will be rid of the poppies.    Mr. Hammond might do the same, you think, if he wishes to rid his field  of poppies. But you see there are many poppies growing among the wheat  all through the field. To get at each plant and cut off all the flowers  would trample down the wheat and do more harm than good. All that the  farmer can do is to have as many weeds as possible hoed up while the  wheat is young and short. Even then many more come up later in the  spring.    The seeds of the Poppy have no pappus like those of the Thistle and some  other plants; they are not blown far away by the wind, but fall close to  the plant. There are, however, an immense number of very tiny seeds in  each seed-case, as we see by opening the round cup-like case on a stem  from which the flower has fallen. This great number of seeds adds to the  difficulty of getting rid of poppies.    We, I am afraid, are hardly sorry that the poppies are among the corn  to-day. The glorious scarlet blossoms give a rich fiery tint to the  whole field.    On a Poppy plant close to the gate there are several blossoms. Some  of them are fully open, some of them are still only buds. You see a  difference between the open flowers and the buds at once. The open  flowers stand upright on the stalk; the buds hang down.    Here is a bud just opening. The green case, called the calyx, which  contains the scarlet petals, is already partly open; it is splitting in  half, and the flower will soon be out. Then the calyx will fall off.    Here is a blossom from which the calyx has just dropped. The four large  scarlet petals, two of which are slightly larger than the other two,  have lain inside all crumpled up--not neatly folded as is the case with  most flowers. Yet in a very short time after the calyx has dropped off,  the sap will flow into the petals and will smooth them out. They will be  as glossy, smooth, and shining as the other blossoms fully open on the  plant.    The brilliant Poppy is more beautiful than useful--to the farmer and the  bees at any rate. Most flowers contain nectar, but the Poppy has none at  all. If the bees come to it, it is for the dusty yellow pollen to make  into wax.    The seed pods of some flowers open when ripe, and the seeds fall out.  In others the pod or case does not open but rots away. The Poppy has a  different way of scattering its seed. There is a ring of tiny holes in  the seed case, and through these holes the seed is shaken out. The  leaves are long, but vary a good deal in size and shape. The stems are  covered with stiff and bristly hairs.          CHAPTER X    IN THE CORN-FIELD (_continued_)      Besides the poppies there is Charlock in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13376"],[0,"Our Legal Heritage, King AEthelbert, 596 to King George III, 1775 (#6)"],[1,"a pig and pork was the primary meat. There were  also sheep, goats, cows, deer, hare, and fowl. Fowl was obtained  by fowlers who trapped them. The inland waters yielded eels,  salmon, and trout. In the fall, meat was salted to preserve it for  winter meals. There were orchards growing figs, nuts, grapes,  almonds, pears, and apples. Also produced were beans, lentils,  onions, eggs, cheese, and butter. Pepper and cinnamon were  imported.    Fishing from the sea yielded herrings, sturgeon, porpoise,  oysters, crabs, and other fish. Sometimes a whale was driven into  an inlet by a group of boats. Whale skins were used to make ropes.    The roads were not much more than trails. They were often so  narrow that two pack horses could hardly pass each other. The pack  horses each carried two bales or two baskets slung over their  backs, which balanced each other. The soft soil was compacted into  a deep ditch which rains, floods, and tides, if near the sea, soon  turned into a river. Traveling a far distance was unsafe as there  were robbers on the roads. Traveling strangers were distrusted. It  was usual to wash one's feet in a hot tub after traveling and to  dry them with a rough wool cloth.    There were superstitions about the content of dreams, the events  of the moon, and the flights and voices of birds were often seen  as signs or omens of future events. Herbal mixtures were drunk for  sickness and maladies. From the witch hazel plant was made a mild  alcoholic astringent, which was probably used to clean cuts and  sooth abrasions.    In the peaceful latter part of the 600s, Theodore, who had been a  monk in Rome, was appointed archbishop and visited all the island  speaking about the right rule of life and ordaining bishops to  oversee the priests. Each kingdom was split up into dioceses each  with one bishop. Thereafter, bishops were selected by the king and  his witan, usually after consulting the clergy and even the people  of the diocese. The bishops came to be the most permanent element  of society. They had their sees in villages or rural monasteries.  The bishops came to have the same wergeld as an eorldorman:  1200s., which was the price of about 500 oxen. A priest had the  wergeld as a landholding farmer [thegn], or 300s. The bishops  spoke Latin, but the priests of the local parishes spoke English.  Theodore was the first archbishop whom all the English church  obeyed. He taught sacred and secular literature, the books of holy  writ, ecclesiastical poetry, astronomy, arithmetic, and sacred  music. Theodore discouraged slavery by denying Christian burial to  the kidnapper and forbidding the sale of children over the age of  seven. A slave became entitled to two loaves a day and to his  holydays. A slave was allowed to buy his or his children's  freedom. In 673, Theodore started annual national ecclesiastical  assemblies, for instance for the witnessing of important actions.  The bishops, some abbots, the king, and the eorldormen were  usually present. From them the people learned the benefit of  common national action. There were two archbishops: one of  Canterbury in the south and one of York in the north. They  governed the bishops and could meet with them to issue canons that  would be equally valid all over the land. A bishop's house  contained some clerks, priests, monks, and nun and was a retreat  for the weary missionary and a school for the young. The bishop  had a deacon who acted as a secretary and companion in travel, and  sometimes as an interpreter. Ink was made from the outer husks of  walnuts steeped in vinegar.    The learned ecclesiastical life flourished in monastic  communities, in which both monks and nuns lived. Hilda, a noble's  daughter, became the first nun in Northumbria and abbess of one of  its monasteries. There she taught justice, piety, chastity, peace,  and charity. Several monks taught there later became bishops.  Kings and princes often asked her advice. Many abbesses came to  run monastic communities; they were from royal families. Women,  especially from royal families, fled to monasteries to obtain  shelter from unwanted marriage or to avoid their husbands. Kings  and eorldormen retired to them.    Danish Vikings made several invasions in the 800s for which a  danegeld tax on land was assessed on everyone every ten to twenty  years. The amount was determined by the witan and was typically  2s. per hide of land. (A hide was probably the amount of land  which could support a family or household for a year or as much  land as could be tilled annually by a single plough.) It was stored  in a strong box under the King's bed. King Alfred the Great, who  had lived for awhile in Rome, unified the country to defeat the  invaders. He established fortifications called \"burhs\", usually on  hill tops or other strategic locations on the borders to control  the main road and river routes into his realm. The burhs were  seminal towns. They were typically walled enclosures with towers  and an outer ditch and mound, instead of the hedge or fence  enclosure of a tun. Inside were several wooden thatched huts and a  couple of churches, which were lit by earthen oil lamps. The  populace met at burhgemotes. The land area protected by each burh  became known as a \"shire\", which means a share of a larger whole.  The shire or local landowners were responsible for repairing the  burh fortifications. There were about thirty shires.    Alfred gathered together fighting men who were at his disposal,  which included eorldormen with their hearthbands (retinues of men  each of whom had chosen to swear to fight to the death for their  eorldorman, and some of whom were of high rank), the King's  thegns, shire thegns (local landholding farmers, who were required  to bring fighting equipment such as swords, helmets, chain mail,  and horses), and ordinary freemen, i.e. ceorls (who carried food,  dug fortifications, and sometimes fought). Since the King was  compelled to call out the whole population to arms, the  distinction between the king's thegns from other landholders  disappeared. Some great lords organized men under them, whom they  provisioned. These vassals took a personal oath to their lord \"on  condition that he keep me as I am willing to deserve, and fulfill  all that was agreed on when I became his man, and chose his will  as mine.\" Alfred had a small navy of longships with 60 oars to  fight the Viking longships.    Alfred divided his army into two parts so that one half of the men  were fighting while the other half was at home sowing and  harvesting for those fighting. Thus, any small-scale independent  farming was supplanted by the open-field system, cultivation of  common land, more large private estates headed by a lord, and a  more stratified society in which the king and important families  more powerful and the peasants more curtailed. The witan became  mere witnesses. Many free coerls of the older days became bonded.  The village community tended to become a large private estate  headed by a lord. But the lord does not have the power to encroach  upon the rights of common that exist within the community.    In 886, a treaty between Alfred and the Vikings divided the  country along the war front and made the wergeld of every free  farmer, whether English or Viking, 200s. Men of higher rank were  given a wergeld of 4 1/2 marks of pure gold. A mark was probably a  Viking denomination and a mark of gold was equal to nine marks of  silver in later times and probably in this time. The word \"earl\"  replaced the word \"eorldormen\" and the word \"thegn\" replaced the  word \"aetheling\" after the Danish settlement. The ironed pleats of  Viking clothing indicated a high status of the wearer. The Vikings  brought combs and the practice of regular hair-combing to England.    King Alfred gave land with jurisdictional powers within its  boundaries such as the following: \"This is the bequest which King  Alfred make unequivocally to Shaftesbury, to the praise of God and  St. Mary and all the saints of God, for the benefit of my soul,  namely a hundred hides as they stand with their produce and their  men, and my daughter AEthelgifu to the convent along with the  inheritance, since she took the veil on account of bad health; and  the jurisdiction to the convent, which I myself possessed, namely  obstruction and attacks on a man's house and breach of protection.  And the estates which I have granted to the foundation are 40  hides at Donhead and Compton, 20 hides at Handley and Gussage 10  hides at Tarrant, 15 hides at Iwerve and 15 hides at Fontmell.    The witnesses of this are Edward my son and Archbishop AEthelred  and Bishop Ealhferth and Bishop AEthelhead and Earl Wulfhere and  Earl Eadwulf and Earl Cuthred and Abbot Tunberht and Milred my  thegn and AEthelwulf and Osric and Brihtulf and Cyma. If anyone  alters this, he shall have the curse of God and St. Mary and all  the saints of God forever to all eternity. Amen.\"    Sons usually succeeded their fathers on the same land as shown by  this lifetime lease: \"Bishop Denewulf and the community at  Winchester lease to Alfred for his lifetime 40 hides of land at  Alresford, in accordance with the lease which Bishop Tunbriht had  granted to his parents and which had run out, on condition that he  renders every year at the autumnal equinox three pounds as rent,  and church dues, and the work connected with church dues; and when  the need arises, his men shall be ready both for harvesting and  hunting; and after his death the property shall pass undisputed to  St. Peter's.    These are the signatures of the councilors and of the members of  the community who gave their consent, namely ...\"    Alfred invented a graduated candle with spaces indicating one hour  of burning, which could be used as a clock. He used a ventilated  cow's horn to put around the top of the candle to prevent its  blowing out, and then devised a wooden lantern with a horn window."]]]
