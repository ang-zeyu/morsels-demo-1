But with respect to the man who is an alien enemy from what he does  under a local or temporary allegiance to a power at war with us--when  the allegiance ends, the character of alien enemy ceases to exist.[59]    Of course all persons owing a natural allegiance to the enemy are our  enemies; but on the same broad principles of natural justice that  impress a temporary character upon our friends and fellow countrymen,  under special circumstances individuals from amongst our natural  enemies become our friends and fellow subjects.           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: Prisoners of War.]    The first among these are Prisoners of War.    A Prisoner of War is _not_ adhering to the King's enemies, for he is  here under the protection from the King. If he conspires against the  King's life it is high treason; if he is killed (malice aforethought),  it is murder. He is not, therefore, in a state of actual hostility. At  one time it was ruled, that a prisoner of war could not contract; but  that case was thought hard. Officers on their parole must subsist like  other men of their own rank; but if they could not contract they must  starve; for they could gain no credit if deprived of the power of  sueing for their own debts. A prisoner in confinement is protected as  to his person, and if on parole he has protection in his credit  also.[60]    He is allowed to support himself, and add to his personal comfort, by  applying himself in his trade or business, and may maintain an action  on his contract for his wages; nor can he be compelled, when sueing  for money necessary for his support, to give security for costs like  any other foreigner temporarily resident in this country.[61]           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: Married Foreigners.]    A wife generally follows the country and allegiance of her husband;  but where she is in this country of necessity, or is here owing  allegiance by her birth, and her husband is an alien enemy and under  an absolute disability to come and live here, the law steps in to her  aid, and gives her the privileges of an unmarried woman, so that she  may sue and be sued, and make contracts for and against herself, for  her maintenance. \"Her case,\" says Chief Justice Holt, \"does not differ  from that of those ladies who were allowed to sue and be sued upon the  adjuration or banishments of their lords, as if they had been  sole.\"[62]    Foreign ladies, who have married Englishmen, are, by their marriage,  naturalized, and have all the rights, privileges, and duties, of  natural-born subjects, and cease to be enemies.[63]           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: Enemies by Hostility.]    A hostile character may be acquired by alien friends, by acts of  actual hostility, and by alien friends and our fellow-subjects also,  by what are termed personal and commercial domicile. Of course a  British subject in actual hostility to his native country is more than  enemy, he is a traitor, and has no belligerent rights; but an alien  friend, that is a neutral engaging in war against this country, under  the commission of a foreign prince, and in the ranks of a hostile  army, or on board a legally commissioned enemy's vessel, is an enemy,  and has all the rights of a prisoner of war, if taken.           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: Mariners.]    A Mariner, by a general rule, takes the character of the country in  whose service he is employed, and even fugitive visits to the place of  his birth will not entitle him to retain the benefit of a neutral  character, in opposition to a regular course of employment in the  enemy's country and trade; nor does the fact of his wife and family  residing in his own country enable him to retain his native  character.[64]           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: Domicile, Test of Nationality.]    With the exception of these special cases, in a state of war, Domicile  is the Test of Nationality. According to Grotius,         \"By the Law of Nations all the subjects of the offending       state, who are such from a _permanent_ cause, whether       natives _or emigrants from another country_, are liable to       reprisals; but not so those who are only travelling or       sojourning for a little.\"    And he even holds that the right of killing and doing bodily harm to  enemies extends \"not only to those who bear arms, or are subjects of  the author of the war, but to _all_ those who are found in the enemy's  territory;\" meaning all those found domiciled or adhering to the  enemy.    If, then, a native of England resides in a belligerent country, his  property is liable to capture as enemy's property; and if he resides  in a neutral country, he enjoys all the privileges, and is subject to  all the inconveniences of the neutral trade.[65]    He takes all the advantages and disadvantages of the country of his  adoption; with the limitation, that he must do nothing inconsistent  with his native allegiance;[66] as, for example, if he emigrate to a  neutral country _during the time of war_, he will not be permitted to  acquire the character of a neutral merchant, and trade with the enemy  in that character, it being his duty to injure the enemy to the full  extent of his power.[67]           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: Test of Domicile.]    In determining the important question of Domicile, the _animus  manendi_, or disposition to remain or settle in the land of the  domicile, is the question to be determined.    If a man goes into a foreign country upon a visit, to travel for  health, to settle a particular business, or for similar purposes, the  residence naturally attendant on these circumstances is not generally  regarded as a permanent residence.    But though a special purpose, such as the above, does not fix a  domicile, yet these circumstances are not to be taken without respect  to the _time_ they _may probably_ or _actually do_ occupy. A general  residence may grow upon a special purpose. It is difficult to fix the  amount of time necessary to create a domicile, and it probably must be  determined from each particular case. Thus, if a man remained in a  hostile state after the outbreak, employed on some great work, which  would occupy him many years, or beyond the probable termination of the  war, or were unable to leave that particular climate on account of  health, or were under any disability to return to his native country,  the amount of time he had resided there would become an element of the  question; against such a residence, the plea of an original special  purpose, could not be averred; but it must be inferred, in such a  case, that other purposes forced themselves upon him, mixed themselves  with his original design, and impressed upon him the character of the  country where he resided.    But, as an exception, a residence involuntary or constrained, however  long, does not change the original character of the party, and give  him a new and hostile one.    Domicile is fixed by a disclosed intention of permanent residence; if  the emigrant employs his person, his life, his industry, for the  benefit of the state under whose protection he lives; and if, war  breaking out, he continues to reside there, pays his proportion of  taxes, imposts, and revenues, equally with the natural-born subjects,  no doubt he may be said to be domiciled in that country.    When these circumstances are ascertained, time ceases to be an element  in the question, and the _animus manendi_, once ascertained, the  recency of the establishment, though it may have been for a day only,  is immaterial.    The intention is the real subject of enquiry; and the residence, once  the domicile, is not changed by periodical absence, or even by  occasional visits to the native country, if the intention of foreign  domicile remains.    The native character, however, easily reverts; more so in the case of  a native subject, than of one who is originally of another country.  The moment an emigrant turns his back on his adopted country, with the  intention of returning to (not simply visiting) his native country, he  is in the act of resuming his original character, and must be again  considered as a citizen of his native land;[68] even if he is forcibly  detained in the country he is parting from, as was the case with  British subjects on the breaking out of the War of 1804.[69]    But it is advisable for persons so situated, on their intended  removal, to make application to Government for a special pass, rather  than to trust valuable property to the effect of a mere intention to  remove, dubious as that intention may frequently appear, under the  circumstances that prevent that act from being carried into execution.    But, as we have before observed, general principles on this subject  are scarcely sufficient; the right of domicile must depend on each  individual case. If no express declaration has been made, and the  secret intention has yet to be discovered, it can be evidenced by the  acts of the party. In the first instance, these acts are removal to a  foreign country, settlement there, and engagement in the trade of the  country: and if a state of war brings his national character into  question, it lies on him to explain the circumstances of his  residence.           *       *       *       *       *    [Sidenote: Domicile in Eastern Countries.]    A singular exception exists in reference to the rule of domicile. In  the Western parts of Europe, alien merchants mix in the society of the  natives; but in the East, from almost the oldest times, an immixable  character has been kept up; foreigners"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13882"],[0,"John Thorndyke's Cases (#6)"],[1,"be lured on to the yacht for a few minutes, and when I would  have gone ashore, I found that the shore ropes had been cast off, and  that the vessel was already moving out of the harbour. At first I was  furious, but the three scoundrels were so jovial and good-natured, and  so delighted with the joke of taking me for a sail against my will, that  I presently cooled down, and having changed into a pair of rubber-soled  shoes (so that I should not make dents in the smooth deck with my  hobnails), bore a hand at sailing the yacht, and spent quite a pleasant  day.    \"From that time I found myself gradually drifting back into a state of  intimacy with these agreeable scoundrels, and daily becoming more and  more afraid of them. In a moment of imbecility I mentioned what I had  seen from the shop-window at Eastwich, and, though they passed the  matter off with a joke, I could see that they were mightily disturbed by  it. Their efforts to induce me to join them were redoubled, and Hearn  took to calling almost daily at my house--usually with documents and  signatures which he tried to persuade me to copy.    \"A few evenings ago he made a new and startling proposition. We were  walking in my garden, and he had been urging me once more to rejoin the  gang--unsuccessfully, I need not say. Presently he sat down on a seat  against a yew-hedge at the bottom of the garden, and, after an interval  of silence, said suddenly:    \"'Then you absolutely refuse to go in with us?'    \"'Of course I do,' I replied. 'Why should I mix myself up with a gang of  crooks when I have ample means and a decent position?'    \"'Of course,' he agreed, 'you'd be a fool if you did. But, you see, you  know all about this Eastwich job, to say nothing of our other little  exploits, and you gave us away once before. Consequently, you can take  it from me that, now Jezzard has run you to earth, he won't leave you in  peace until you have given us some kind of a hold on you. You know too  much, you see, and as long as you have a clean sheet you are a standing  menace to us. That is the position. You know it, and Jezzard knows it,  and he is a desperate man, and as cunning as the devil.'    \"'I know that,' I said gloomily.    \"'Very well,' continued Hearn. 'Now I'm going to make you an offer.  Promise me a small annuity--you can easily afford it--or pay me a  substantial sum down, and I will set you free for ever from Jezzard and  the others.'    \"'How will you do that?' I asked.    \"'Very simply,' he replied. 'I am sick of them all, and sick of this  risky, uncertain mode of life. Now I am ready to clean off my own slate  and set you free at the same time; but I must have some means of  livelihood in view.'    \"'You mean that you will turn King's evidence?' I asked.    \"'Yes, if you will pay me a couple of hundred a year, or, say, two  thousand down on the conviction of the gang.'    \"I was so taken aback that for some time I made no reply, and as I sat  considering this amazing proposition, the silence was suddenly broken  by a suppressed sneeze from the other side of the hedge.    \"Hearn and I started to our feet. Immediately hurried footsteps were  heard in the lane outside the hedge. We raced up the garden to the gate  and out through a side alley, but when we reached the lane there was not  a soul in sight. We made a brief and fruitless search in the immediate  neighbourhood, and then turned back to the house. Hearn was deathly pale  and very agitated, and I must confess that I was a good deal upset by  the incident.    \"'This is devilish awkward,' said Hearn.    \"'It is rather,' I admitted; 'but I expect it was only some inquisitive  yokel.'    \"'I don't feel so sure of that,' said he. 'At any rate, we were stark  lunatics to sit up against a hedge to talk secrets.'    \"He paced the garden with me for some time in gloomy silence, and  presently, after a brief request that I would think over his proposal,  took himself off.    \"I did not see him again until I met him last night on the yacht.  Pitford called on me in the morning, and invited me to come and dine  with them. I at first declined, for my housekeeper was going to spend  the evening with her sister at Eastwich, and stay there for the night,  and I did not much like leaving the house empty. However, I agreed  eventually, stipulating that I should be allowed to come home early, and  I accordingly went. Hearn and Pitford were waiting in the boat by the  steps--for the yacht had been moved out to a buoy--and we went on board  and spent a very pleasant and lively evening. Pitford put me ashore at  ten o'clock, and I walked straight home, and went to bed. Hearn would  have come with me, but the others insisted on his remaining, saying  that they had some matters of business to discuss.\"    \"Which way did you walk home?\" asked Thorndyke.    \"I came through the town, and along the main road.\"    \"And that is all you know about this affair?\"    \"Absolutely all,\" replied Draper. \"I have now admitted you to secrets of  my past life that I had hoped never to have to reveal to any human  creature, and I still have some faint hope that it may not be necessary  for you to divulge what I have told you.\"    \"Your secrets shall not be revealed unless it is absolutely  indispensable that they should be,\" said Thorndyke; \"but you are placing  your life in my hands, and you must leave me perfectly free to act as I  think best.\"    With this he gathered his notes together, and we took our departure.    \"A very singular history, this, Jervis,\" he said, when, having wished  the sergeant \"Good-night,\" we stepped out on to the dark road. \"What do  you think of it?\"    \"I hardly know what to think,\" I answered, \"but, on the whole, it seems  rather against Draper than otherwise. He admits that he is an old  criminal, and it appears that he was being persecuted and blackmailed by  the man Hearn. It is true that he represents Jezzard as being the  leading spirit and prime mover in the persecution, but we have only his  word for that. Hearn was in lodgings near him, and was undoubtedly  taking the most active part in the business, and it is quite possible,  and indeed probable, that Hearn was the actual _deus ex machina_.\"    Thorndyke nodded. \"Yes,\" he said, \"that is certainly the line the  prosecution will take if we allow the story to become known. Ha! what  is this? We are going to have some rain.\"    \"Yes, and wind too. We are in for an autumn gale, I think.\"    \"And that,\" said Thorndyke, \"may turn out to be an important factor in  our case.\"    \"How can the weather affect your case?\" I asked in some surprise. But,  as the rain suddenly descended in a pelting shower, my companion broke  into a run, leaving my question unanswered.    On the following morning, which was fair and sunny after the stormy  night, Dr. Burrows called for my friend. He was on his way to the  extemporized mortuary to make the _post-mortem_ examination of the  murdered man's body. Thorndyke, having notified the coroner that he was  watching the case on behalf of the accused, had been authorized to be  present at the autopsy; but the authorization did not include me, and,  as Dr. Burrows did not issue any invitation, I was not able to be  present. I met them, however, as they were returning, and it seemed to  me that Dr. Burrows appeared a little huffy.    \"Your friend,\" said he, in a rather injured tone, \"is really the most  outrageous stickler for forms and ceremonies that I have ever met.\"    Thorndyke looked at him with an amused twinkle, and chuckled  indulgently.    \"Here was a body,\" Dr. Burrows continued irritably, \"found under  circumstances clearly indicative of murder, and bearing a knife-wound  that nearly divided the arch of the aorta; in spite of which, I assure  you that Dr. Thorndyke insisted on weighing the body, and examining  every organ--lungs, liver, stomach, and brain--yes, actually the  brain!--as if there had been no clue whatever to the cause of death.  And then, as a climax, he insisted on sending the contents of the  stomach in a jar, sealed with our respective seals, in charge of a  special messenger, to Professor Copland, for analysis and report. I  thought he was going to demand an examination for the tubercle bacillus,  but he didn't; which,\" concluded Dr. Burrows, suddenly becoming sourly  facetious, \"was an oversight, for, after all, the fellow may have died  of consumption.\"    Thorndyke chuckled again, and I murmured that the precautions appeared  to have been somewhat excessive.    \"Not at all,\" was the smiling response. \"You are losing sight of our  function. We are the expert and impartial umpires, and it is our  business to ascertain, with scientific accuracy, the cause of death. The  _prima facie_ appearances in this case suggest that the deceased was  murdered by Draper, and that is the hypothesis advanced. But that is no  concern of ours. It is not our function to confirm an hypothesis  suggested by outside circumstances, but rather, on the contrary, to make  certain that no other explanation is possible. And that is my invariable  practice. No matter how glaringly obvious the appearances may be, I  refuse to take anything for granted.\"    Dr. Burrows received this statement with a grunt of dissent, but the  arrival of his dogcart put a stop to further discussion.    Thorndyke was not subpoenaed for the inquest. Dr. Burrows and the  sergeant having been present immediately after the finding of the body,  his evidence was not considered necessary, and, moreover, he was known  to be watching the case in the interests of the accused. Like myself,  therefore, he was present as a spectator, but as a highly interested  one, for he took very complete shorthand notes of the whole of the  evidence and the coroner's comments.    I shall not describe the proceedings in detail. The jury, having been  taken to view the body, trooped into the room on tiptoe, looking pale  and awe-stricken, and took their"]]]
