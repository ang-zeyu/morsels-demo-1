It had also, near the tail, two articulations with something  like a toe and joint on each, such as I had not observed before in any  other kind of snake. A smaller one of the same kind attacked one of the  party, and also a native, but the former shook it from his clothes, it  then fixed its teeth in the skin of the native who detached it with  difficulty; but as no blood came from the bite he seemed to care little  about it. The native name of this place was Cuenbla.    VIEW FROM MARGA.    March 23.    I set off, accompanied by my black guide mounted, for the top of Marga,  and we reached it this time by a route in which the native displayed the  usual skill of his race. Certainly I never ascended a hill of more  perplexing features, all these heights being also of extremely difficult  access, very steep and extending in the direction of 10 and 12 degrees  East of North. They consist of the sharp edges of inclined strata of hard  purple-coloured clay-slate. I was however rewarded for the fatigues this  hill had cost me, on two different days, not with a fine view, for the  summit was too woody for that, but with a sight of some important points  determined during my late journey; and others which I had then observed  only from the Canobolas but which I was now enabled to fix by angles  observed from this station. The most important point visible besides the  Canobolas was Mount Lachlan, by means of which I determined the true  situation of Marga and the neighbouring hill Nangar; which is rather  higher but more wooded, and 2 1/2 miles distant towards the south-east.  These two form the summits of an isolated mountain mass on the left bank  of Byrne's creek, the top of Marga being about 1000 feet above our camp  on its banks. I drew outlines (according to my usual custom) of all the  hills on the horizon before us, and took angles on them with the  theodolite. Descending by a shorter route I reached the camp in time to  protract my angles, whereby I ascertained to my great satisfaction that  both Marga and Nangar had been truly fixed from the Canobolas, as well as  other points observed in my former journey, the accuracy of which, by a  good angle with Mount Lachlan, I was thus enabled to prove without going  out of my way, besides establishing there a good base for extending the  survey southward.    March 24.    Our guide was now joined by some older natives, and one of them had been  examining the country ahead, being anxious about the safe passage of our  carts. His reconnaissance had not been made in vain, for he led us to an  easy, open pass through a range of which we had heard much from stockmen  as likely to trouble us because, as they said, its rocky extremities  overhung the creek. We crossed it with ease however, guided by the  native. It consisted of granite and evidently belonged geologically to  the ridge traversed by us on the second day after leaving Buree during  our last journey. On the range, green pine trees (callitris) and a  luxuriant crop of grass covering the adjacent country, multitudes of fat  cattle were to be seen on all sides. I had heard that, after crossing the  burnt up surface of the colony, I should see green pastures here, beyond  its limits.    CROSS BYRNE'S CREEK.    We crossed Byrne's creek, near a cattle station called Lagoura, and after  keeping its banks for four miles further (having for that distance  granitic hills on our right) we finally quitted it, and passed over a  grassy plain of the same kind of soil and character as those extensive  level tracts seen during our last journey but having, what seemed  singular to our unaccustomed sight, a coating of green herbage upon it.    NEW PLANTS.    In our progress I found no fewer than three new species of the pretty  genus Trichinium;* a small species of Sida before undiscovered, with  minute yellow flowers,** and also a fine-looking acacia with falcate  leaves, singularly white or rather silvery, and with drooping graceful  branches.***    (*Footnote.    1.

REACH THE LACHLAN.    Travelling four miles more across level forest land, we reached the banks  of the Lachlan at Waagan,* a cattle station a mile and a half below the  junction of Byrne's creek of Oxley, which we had just traced in its  course from Buree.    (*Footnote. Waagan means a crow in the native language.)    FIND ITS CHANNEL DRY.    I beheld in the Lachlan all the features of the Darling, but on a  somewhat smaller scale. The same sort of large gumtrees, similar steep,  soft, muddy banks; and, even in this place, a margin with an outer bank.  But its waters were gone, except in a few small ponds in the very deepest  parts of its bed. Such was now the state of that river down which my  predecessor's boats had floated. I had during the last winter drawn my  whaleboats 1600 miles overland without finding a river where I could use  them; whereas Mr. Oxley had twice retired by nearly the same routes, and  in the same season of the year, from supposed inland seas!

Following the direction of the general course of the Lachlan as laid down  by Mr. Oxley we crossed a fine tract of open forest land, and at the  distance of five miles arrived at a dry reach. Soon after we passed  Billabugan, a cattle station on the river where the dry branch joined it;  and at three miles further we traversed the southern skirts of a plain,  and finally made a bend of the Lachlan on which we encamped in latitude  33 degrees 24 minutes 28 seconds South. In the course of this day's  journey we discovered a bush resembling the European dwarf elder but with  yellow flowers, and fruit with scarcely any pulp.*    (*Footnote. This proves to be a new genus of Caprifoliaceae, paragraph  mark Sambuceae. Tripetelus australasicus, Lindley manuscripts (tripetelos  having 3 leaves; the calyx has 3 sepals, the corolla 3 petals, the  stamens are 3, and the carpels are also 3). Calyx superus tridentatus.

March 26.    This day at five miles further we ascended some undulating ground on  which the acacias of the interior grew. We found the same ridged and wavy  surface with the Acacia pendula and the pigeons which usually abound  about such parts of the country. Here we found also a singular species of  Jasmine, forming an upright bush not unlike a Vitex, with short axillary  panicles of white flowers. It proved to be J. lineare, R. Br. We soon  after came upon the borders of the great plain of Gullerong, which  extends about eight miles from east to west, and three northward from a  branch of the river, then quite dry. These I believe were the  Solway-flats of Mr. Oxley. We turned from them late in the afternoon, at  the suggestion of a native wearing a brass-plate like a bottle label, and  on which was engraven Billy Hawthorne. We succeeded in reaching a bend of  the river containing water only after travelling 18 1/4 miles; and in  latitude 33 degrees 23 minutes 21 seconds South."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13053"],[0,"International Weekly Miscellany of Literature, Art, and Science — Volume 1, No. (#6)"],[1,"hope that the Emperor of Japan will become  converted to Christianity.           *       *       *       *       *    MEETINGS have been held at the house of Mr. Justice Coleridge, in  London, at which a committee has been formed, with the Bishop of  London at its head, to initiate a subscription to do honor to the  memory of the poet Wordsworth, by placing a whole length effigy of  him in Westminster Abbey, and, if the funds suffice, by erecting a  monument to his memory near Grassmere.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. E.G.

Through the ornamented grounds of a handsome country residence, at  a little distance from a large town in Ireland, a man of about fifty  years of age was walking with a bent head, and the impress of sorrow  on his face.    \"Och, yer honor, give me one sixpence, or one penny, for God's sake,\"  cried a voice from the other side of a fancy paling which separated  the grounds in that quarter from a thoroughfare. \"For heaven's sake,  Mr. Lawson, help me as ye helped me before. I know you've the heart  and the hand to do it.\"    The person addressed as Mr. Lawson looked up and saw a woman whom he  knew to be in most destitute circumstances, burdened with a large and  sickly family, whom she had struggled to support until her own health  was ruined.    \"I have no money--not one farthing,\" answered John Lawson.    \"No money!\" reiterated the woman, in surprise: \"isn't it all yours,  then?--isn't this garden yours, and that house, and all the grand  things that are in it yours?--ay, and grand things they are--them  pictures, and them bright shinin' things in that drawing-room of  yours; and sure you deserve them well, and may God preserve them long  to you, for riches hasn't hardened your heart, though there's many a  one, and heaven knows the gold turns their feelin's to iron.\"    \"It all belongs to my son, Henry Lawson, and Mrs. Lawson, and their  children--it is all theirs,\" he sighed heavily, and deep emotion was  visible in every lineament of his thin and wrinkled face.    The poor woman raised her blood-shot eyes to his face, as if she  was puzzled by his words. She saw that he was suffering, and with  intuitive delicacy she desisted from pressing her wants, though her  need was great.    \"Well, well, yer honor, many's the good penny ye have given me and the  childer, and maybe the next time I see you you'll have more change.\"    She was turning sadly away, when John Lawson requested her to remain,  and he made inquiries into the state of her family; the report  he heard seemed to touch him even to the forgetfulness of his own  sorrows; he bade her stop for a few moments and he would give her some  relief.    He walked rapidly toward the house and proceeded to the drawing-room.  It was a large and airy apartment, and furnished with evident  profusion; the sunlight of the bright summer-day, admitted partially  through the amply-draperied windows, lit up a variety of sparkling  gilding in picture-frames, and vases, and mirrors, and cornices; but  John Lawson looked round on the gay scene with a kind of shudder; he  had neither gold, silver, nor even copper in his pocket, or in his  possession.    He advanced to a lady who reclined on a rose-colored sofa, with a  fashionable novel in her hand, and after some slight hesitation he  addressed her, and stating the name and wants of the poor woman who  had begged for aid, he requested some money.    As he said the words \"some money,\" his lips quivered, and a tremor  ran through his whole frame, for his thoughts were vividly picturing  a recently departed period, when he was under no necessity of asking  money from any individual.    \"Bless me, my dear Mr. Lawson!\" cried the lady, starting up from her  recumbent position, \"did I not give you a whole handful of shillings  only the day before yesterday; and if you wasted it all on poor  people since, what am I to do? Why, indeed, we contribute so much to  charitable subscriptions, both Mr. Lawson and I, you might be content  to give a little less to common beggars.\"    Mrs. Lawson spoke with a smile on her lips, and with a soft caressing  voice, but a hard and selfish nature shone palpably from her blue  eyes. She was a young woman, and had the repute of beauty, which  a clear pink-and-white complexion, and tolerable features, with  luxuriant light hair, generally gains from a portion of the world. She  was dressed for the reception of morning visitors whom she expected,  and she was enveloped in expensive satin and blond, and jewelry in  large proportions.    John Lawson seemed to feel every word she had uttered in the depths  of his soul, but he made a strong effort to restrain the passion which  was rising to his lips.    \"Augusta, my daughter, you are the wife of my only and most beloved  child--I wish to love you--I wish to live in peace with you, and  all--give me some money to relieve the wants of the unfortunate woman  to whom I have promised relief, and who is waiting without. I ask not  for myself, but for the poor and suffering--give me a trifle of money,  I say.\"    \"Indeed, Mr. Lawson, a bank would not support your demands for the  poor people; that woman for whom you are begging has been relieved  twenty times by us. I have no money just now.\"    She threw herself back on the sofa, and resumed her novel; but anger,  darting from her eyes, contrasted with the trained smile which still  remained on her lips.    A dark shade of passion and scorn came over John Lawson's face, but  he strove to suppress it, and his voice was calm when he spoke.    \"Some time before my son married you, I gave up all my business to  him--I came to live here amongst trees and flowers--I gave up all  the lucrative business I had carried on to my son, partly because my  health was failing, and I longed to live with nature, away from the  scenes of traffic; but more especially because I loved my son with  no common love, and I trusted to him as to a second self. I was not  disappointed--we had one purse and one heart before he married you;  he never questioned me concerning what I spent in charity--he never  asked to limit in any way my expenditure--he loved you, and I made  no conditions concerning what amount of income I was to receive, but  still I left him in entire possession of my business when he married  you. I trusted to your fair, young face, that you would not controvert  my wishes--that you would join me in my schemes of charity.\"    \"And have I not?\" interrupted Mrs. Lawson, in a sharp voice, though  the habitual smile still graced her lips; \"do I not subscribe to, I  don't know how many, charitable institutions? Charity, indeed--there's  enough spent in charity by myself and my husband. But I wish to stop  extravagance--it is only extravagance to spend so much on charity as  you would do if you could; therefore, you shall not have any money  just now.\"    Mrs. Lawson was one of those women who can cheerfully expend a most  lavish sum on a ball, a dress, or any other method by which rank and  luxury dissipate their abundance, but who are very economical, and  talk much of extravagance when money is demanded for purposes not  connected with display or style.    \"Augusta Lawson, listen to me\"--his voice quivering with passion--\"my  own wants are very few; in food, in clothes, in all points my  expenditure is trifling. I am not extravagant in my demands for the  poor, either. All I have expended in charity during the few years  since you came here, is but an insignificant amount as contrasted with  the income which I freely gave up to my son and you; therefore, some  money for the poor woman who is waiting, I shall now have; give me  some shillings, for God's sake, and let me go.\" He advanced closer to  her, and held out his hand.    \"Nonsense!\" cried Mrs. Lawson; \"I am mistress, here--I am determined  to stop"]]]
