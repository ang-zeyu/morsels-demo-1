If the Lord lets me  come up with that devil, I aim to deal out a case uh justice on my own  hook; I was in a right proper humor for doing him like he done the  other fellow, and not ask no questions. Looked to me like he had it  coming, all right.    \"I'd just stuck my toe in the stirrup, when down comes the fog like a  wet blanket on everything. I couldn't see twenty feet--\" Andy stopped  and reached for a burning twig to relight his cigarette. The Happy  Family was breathing hard with the spell of the story.    \"Did yuh git him?\" Happy Jack asked hoarsely. Andy took a long puff at  his cigarette. \"Well, I--Holy smoke! what's the matter with _you_,  Blink?\" For Blink was leaning forward, half crouched, like a cat about  to pounce, and was glaring fixedly at Andy with lips drawn back in a  snarl. The Happy Family looked, then stared.    Blink relaxed, shrugged his shoulders and grinned unmirthfully. He got  up, pulled up his chaps with the peculiar, hitching gesture which  comes with long practice and grows to be second nature, and stared  back defiantly at the wondering faces lighted by the dancing flames.  He turned his back coolly upon them and walked away to where his horse  stood, took up the reins and stuck his toe in the stirrup, went up and  landed in the saddle ready for anything. Then he wheeled the big  sorrel so that he faced those at the camp-fire.    \"A man's a damned fool, Andy Green, to see more than is meant for him  to see. He's plumb crazy to go round blatting all he knows. You won't  tell that tale again, _mi amigo!_\"    There was the pop of a pistol, a puff of blue against the gray, and  then the fog reached out and gathered Blink and the sorrel to itself.  Only the clatter of galloping hoofs came to them from behind the damp  curtain. Andy Green was lying on his back in the grass, his cigarette  smoking dully in his fingers, a fast widening red streak trailing down  from his temple.    The Happy Family rose like a covey of frightened chickens before the  echoes were done playing with the gun-bark. On the heels of Blink's  shot came the crack of Happy Jack's \"howitzer\" as he fired blindly  toward the hoof-beats. There was more shooting while they scurried to  where their horses, snorting excitement, danced uneasily at the edge  of the bushes. Only one man spoke, and that was Pink, who stopped just  as he was about to swing into the saddle.    \"Damme for leaving my gun in camp! I'll stay with Andy. Go on--and if  yuh don't get him, I'll--\" he turned back, cursing hysterically, and  knelt beside the long figure in the grass. There was a tumult of sound  as the three raced off in pursuit, so close that the flight of the  fugitive was still distinct in the fog.    While they raced they cursed the fog that shielded from their  vengeance their quarry, and made such riding as theirs a blind gamble  with the chances all in favor of broken bones; their only comfort the  knowledge that Blink could see no better than could they. They did not  talk, just at first. They did not even wonder if Andy was dead. Every  nerve, every muscle and every thought was concentrated upon the  pursuit of Blink. It was the instant rising to meet an occasion  undreamed of in advance, to do the only thing possible without loss of  a second in parley. Truly, it were ill for Blink to fall into the  hands of those three in that mood.    They rode with quirt and spur, guided only by the muffled  _pluckety-pluck, pluckety-pluck_ of Blink's horse fleeing always just  before. Whenever the hoof-beats seemed a bit closer, Happy Jack would  lift his long-barreled .45 and send a shot at random toward the sound.  Or Weary or Slim would take a chance with their shorter guns. But  never once did they pull rein for steep or gulley, and never once did  the hoof-beats fail to come back to them from out the fog.    The chase had led afar and the pace was telling on their mounts, which  breathed asthmatically. Slim, best he could do, was falling behind.  Weary's horse stumbled and went to his knees, so that Happy Jack  forged ahead just when the wind, puffing up from the open, blew aside  the gray fog-wall. It was not a minute, nor half that; but it was long  enough for Happy Jack to see, clear and close, Blink pausing  irresolutely upon the edge of a deep, brush-filled gulley. Happy Jack  gave a hoarse croak of triumph and fired, just as the fog-curtain  swayed back maddeningly. Happy Jack nearly wept with pure rage. Weary  and Slim came up, and together they galloped to the place, riding by  instinct of direction, for there was no longer any sound to guide.    Ten minutes they spent searching the gulley's edge. Then they saw  dimly, twenty feet below, a huddled object half-hidden in the brush.  They climbed down none too warily, though they knew well what might be  lying, venomous as a coiled rattler, in wait for them below. Slipping  and sliding in the fog-dampened grass, they reached the spot, to find  the big sorrel crumpled there, dead. They searched anxiously and  futilely for more, but Blink was not there, nor was there anything to  show that he had ever been there. Then not fear, perhaps, but caution,  came to Happy Jack.    \"Aw, say! he's got away on us--the skunk! He's down there in the  brush, somewheres, waiting for somebody to go in and drag him out by  the ear. I betche he's laying low, right now, waiting for a chance to  pot-shot us. We better git back out uh this.\" He edged away, his eyes  on the thicket just below. To ride in there was impossible, even to  the Happy Family in whole or in part. To go in afoot was not at all to  the liking of Happy Jack.    Slim gave a comprehensive, round-eyed stare at the unpromising  surroundings, and followed Happy Jack. \"By golly, that's right. Yuh  don't git me into no hole like that,\" he assented.    Weary, foolhardy to the last, stayed longest; but even Weary could not  but admit that the case was hopeless. The brush was thick and filled  the gully, probably from end to end. Riding through it was impossible,  and hunting it through on foot would be nothing but suicide, with a  man like Blink hidden away in its depths. They climbed back to the  rim, remounted and rode, as straight as might be, for the camp-fire  and what lay beside, with Pink on guard.    It was near noon when, through the lightening fog, they reached the  place and discovered that Andy, though unconscious, was not dead. They  found, upon examination of his hurt, that the bullet had ploughed  along the side of his head above his ear; but just how serious it  might be they did not know. Pink, having a fresh horse and aching for  action, mounted and rode in much haste to camp, that the bed-wagon  might be brought out to take Andy in to the ranch and the  ministrations of the Little Doctor. Also, he must notify the crew and  get them out searching for Blink.    All that night and the next day the cowboys rode, and the next. They  raked the foothills, gulley by gulley, their purpose grim. It would  probably be a case of shoot-on-sight with them, and nothing saved  Blink save the all-important fact that never once did any man of the  Flying U gain sight of him. He had vanished completely after that  fleeting glimpse Happy Jack had gained, and in the end the Flying U  was compelled to own defeat.    Upon one point they congratulated themselves: Andy, bandaged as he  was, had escaped with a furrow ploughed through the scalp, though it  was not the fault of Blink that he was alive and able to discuss the  affair with the others--more exactly, to answer the questions they  fired at him.    \"Didn't you recognize him as being the murderer?\" Weary asked him  curiously.    Andy moved uneasily on his bed. \"No, I didn't. By gracious, you must  think I'm a plumb fool!\"    \"Well, yuh sure hit the mark, whether yuh meant to or not,\" Pink  asserted. \"He was the jasper, all right. Look how he was glaring at  yuh while you were telling about it. _He_ knew he was the party, and  having a guilty conscience, he naturally supposed yuh recognized him  from the start.\"    \"Well, I didn't,\" snapped Andy ungraciously, and they put it down to  the peevishness of invalidism and overlooked the tone.    \"Chip has given his description in to the sheriff,\" soothed Weary,  \"and if he gets off he's sure a good one. And I heard that the sheriff  wired down to the San Simon country and told 'em their man was up  here. Mama! What bad breaks a man will make when he's on the dodge! If  Blink had kept his face closed and acted normal, nobody would have got  next. Andy didn't know he was the fellow that done it. But it sure was  queer, the way the play come up. Wasn't it, Andy?\"    Andy merely grunted. He did not like to dwell upon the subject, and he  showed it plainly.    \"By golly! he must sure have had it in for that fellow,\" mused Slim  ponderously, \"to kill him the way Andy says he did. By golly, yuh  can't wonder his eyes stuck out when he heard Andy telling us all  about it!\"    \"I betche he lays for Andy yet, and gits him,\" predicted Happy Jack  felicitously. \"He won't rest whilst an eye-witness is running around  loose. I betche he's cached in the hills right now, watching his  chance.\"    \"Oh, go to hell, the whole lot of yuh!\" flared Andy, rising to an  elbow. \"What the dickens are yuh roosting around here for? Why don't  yuh go on out to camp where yuh belong? You're a nice bunch to set  around comforting the sick! _Vamos_, darn yuh!\"    Whereupon they took the hint and departed, assuring Andy, by way of  farewell, that he was an unappreciative cuss and didn't deserve any  sympathy or sick-calls. They also condoled openly with Pink because he  had been detailed as nurse, and advised him to sit right down on Andy  if he got too sassy and haughty over being shot up by a real outlaw.

Regarding the Midrash in its purely literary aspects, we find its style  to be far more lucid than that of the Talmud, though portions of the  Halachic Midrash are identical in character with the Talmud. The Midrash  has many passages in which the simple graces of form match the beauty of  idea. But for the most part the style is simple and prosaic, rather than  ornate or poetical. It produces its effects by the most straightforward  means, and strikes a modern reader as lacking distinction in form. The  dead level of commonplace expression is, however, brightened by  brilliant passages of frequent occurrence. Prayers, proverbs, parables,  and fables, dot the pages of Talmud and Midrash alike. The ancient  _proverbs_ of the Jews were more than mere chips from the block of  experience. They were poems, by reason of their use of metaphor,  alliteration, assonance, and imagination. The Rabbinical proverbs show  all these poetical qualities.         He who steals from a thief smells of theft.--Charity is the       salt of Wealth.--Silence is a fence about Wisdom.--Many old       camels carry the skins of their young.--Two dry sticks and one       green burn together.--If the priest steals the god, on what       can one take an oath?--All the dyers cannot bleach a raven's       wing.--Into a well from which you have drunk, cast no       stone.--Alas for the bread which the baker calls bad.--Slander       is a Snake that stings in Syria, and slays in Rome.--The Dove       escaped from the Eagle and found a Serpent in her nest.--Tell       no secrets, for the Wall has ears.    These, like many more of the Rabbinical proverbs, are essentially  poetical. Some, indeed, are either expanded metaphors or metaphors  touched by genius into poetry. The alliterative proverbs and maxims of  the Talmud and Midrash are less easily illustrated. Sometimes they  enshrine a pun or a conceit, or depend for their aptness upon an  assonance. In some of the Talmudic proverbs there is a spice of  cynicism. But most of them show a genial attitude towards life.    The poetical proverb easily passes into the parable. Loved in Bible  times, the parable became in after centuries the most popular form of  didactic poetry among the Jews. The Bible has its parables, but the  Midrash overflows with them. They are occasionally re-workings of older  thoughts, but mostly they are original creations, invented for a special  purpose, stories devised to drive home a moral, allegories administering  in pleasant wrappings unpalatable satires or admonitions. In all ages  up to the present, Jewish moralists have relied on the parable as their  most effective instrument. The poetry of the Jewish parables is  characteristic also of the parables imitated from the Jewish, but the  latter have a distinguishing feature peculiar to them. This is their  humor, the witty or humorous parable being exclusively Jewish. The  parable is less spontaneous than the proverb. It is a product of moral  poetry rather than of folk wisdom. Yet the parable was so like the  proverb that the moral of a parable often became a new proverb. The  diction of the parable is naturally more ornate. By the beauty of its  expression, its frequent application of rural incidents to the life  familiar in the cities, the rhythm and flow of its periods, its fertile  imagination, the parable should certainly be placed high in the world's  poetry. But it was poetry with a _tendency_, the _mashal_, or  proverb-parable, being what the Rabbis themselves termed it, \"the clear  small light by which lost jewels can be found.\"    The following is a parable of Hillel, which is here cited more to  mention that noble, gentle Sage than as a specimen of this class of  literature. Hillel belongs to a period earlier than that dealt with in  this book, but his loving and pure spirit breathes through the pages of  the Talmud and Midrash:        Hillel, the gentle, the beloved sage,      Expounded day by day the sacred page      To his disciples in the house of learning;      And day by day, when home at eve returning,      They lingered, clustering round him, loth to part      From him whose gentle rule won every heart.      But evermore, when they were wont to plead      For longer converse, forth he went with speed,      Saying each day: \"I go--the hour is late--      To tend the guest who doth my coming wait,\"      Until at last they said: \"The Rabbi jests,      When telling us thus daily of his guests      That wait for him.\" The Rabbi paused awhile,      And then made answer: \"Think you I beguile      You with an idle tale? Not so, forsooth!      I have a guest whom I must tend in truth.      Is not the soul of man indeed a guest,      Who in this body deigns a while to rest,      And dwells with me all peacefully to-day:      To-morrow--may it not have fled away?\"    Space must be found for one other parable, taken (like many other  poetical quotations in this volume) from Mrs. Lucas' translations:        Simeon ben Migdal, at the close of day,      Upon the shores of ocean chanced to stray,      And there a man of form and mien uncouth,      Dwarfed and misshapen, met he on the way.        \"Hail, Rabbi,\" spoke the stranger passing by,      But Simeon thus, discourteous, made reply:      \"Say, are there in thy city many more,      Like unto thee, an insult to the eye?\"        \"Nay, that I cannot tell,\" the wand'rer said,      \"But if thou wouldst ply the scorner's trade,      Go first and ask the Master Potter why      He has a vessel so misshapen made?\"        Then (so the legend tells) the Rabbi knew      That he had sinned, and prone himself he threw      Before the other's feet, and prayed of him      Pardon for the words that now his soul did rue.        But still the other answered as before:      \"Go, in the Potter's ear thy plaint outpour,      For what am I! His hand has fashioned me,      And I in humble faith that hand adore.\"        Brethren, do we not often too forget      Whose hand it is that many a time has set      A radiant soul in an unlovely form,      A fair white bird caged in a mouldering net?        Nay more, do not life's times and chances, sent      By the great Artificer with intent      That they should prove a blessing, oft appear      To us a burden that we sore lament?        Ah! soul, poor soul of man! what heavenly fire      Would thrill thy depths and love of God inspire,      Could'st thou but see the Master hand revealed,      Majestic move \"earth's scheme of things entire.\"        It cannot be! Unseen he guideth us,      But yet our feeble hands, the luminous      Pure lamp of faith can light to glorify      The narrow path that he has traced for us.    Finally, there are the _Beast Fables_ of the Talmud and the Midrash.  Most of these were borrowed directly or indirectly from India. We are  told in the Talmud that Rabbi Meir knew three hundred Fox Fables, and  that with his death (about 290 C.E.) \"fabulists ceased to be,\" Very few  of Meir's fables are extant, so that it is impossible to gather whether  or not they were original. There are only thirty fables in the Talmud  and the Midrash, and of these several cannot be parallelled in other  literatures. Some of the Talmudic fables are found also in the  classical and the earliest Indian collections; some in the later  collections; some in the classics, but not in the Indian lists; some in  India, but not in the Latin and Greek authors. Among the latter is the  well-known fable of the _Fox and the Fishes_, used so dramatically by  Rabbi Akiba. The original Talmudic fables are, according to Mr. J.  Jacobs, the following: _Chaff, Straw, and Wheat_, who dispute for which  of them the seed has been sown: the winnowing fan soon decides; _The  Caged Bird_, who is envied by his free fellow; _The Wolf and the two  Hounds_, who have quarrelled; the wolf seizes one, the other goes to his  rival's aid, fearing the same fate himself on the morrow, unless he  helps the other dog to-day; _The Wolf at the Well_, the mouth of the  well is covered with a net: \"If I go down into the well,\" says the wolf,  \"I shall be caught. If I do not descend, I shall die of thirst\"; _The  Cock and the Bat_, who sit together waiting for the sunrise: \"I wait  for the dawn,\" said the cock, \"for the light is my signal; but as for  thee--the light is thy ruin\"; and, finally, what Mr. Jacobs calls the  grim beast-tale of the _Fox as Singer_, in which the beasts--invited by  the lion to a feast, and covered by him with the skins of wild  beasts--are led by the fox in a chorus: \"What has happened to those  above us, will happen to him above,\" implying that their host, too, will  come to a violent death. In the context the fable is applied to Haman,  whose fate, it is augured, will resemble that of the two officers whose  guilt Mordecai detected.    Such fables are used in the Talmud to point religious or even political  morals, very much as the parables were. The fable, however, took a lower  flight than the parable, and its moral was based on expediency, rather  than on the highest ethical ideals. The importance of the Talmudic  fables is historical more than literary or religious. Hebrew fables  supply one of the links connecting the popular literature of the East  with that of the West. But they hardly belong in the true sense to  Jewish literature. Parables, on the other hand, were an essential and  characteristic branch of that literature.      BIBLIOGRAPHY    MIDRASH.
