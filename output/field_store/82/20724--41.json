The rusted  and battered stern of a wrecked steamer stuck up at an acute angle from  the surges. Shortly after we picked up the shores of Arabia.    Note the advantages of a half ignorance. From early childhood we had  thought of Arabia as the \"burning desert\"--flat, of course--and of the  Red Sea as bordered by \"shifting sands\" alone. If we had known the  truth--if we had not been half ignorant--we would have missed the  profound surprise of discovering that in reality the Red Sea is bordered  by high and rugged mountains, leaving just space enough between  themselves and the shore for a sloping plain on which our glasses could  make out occasional palms. Perhaps the \"shifting sands of the burning  desert\" lie somewhere beyond; but somebody might have mentioned these  great mountains! After examining them attentively we had to confess that  if this sort of thing continued farther north the children of Israel  must have had a very hard time of it. Mocha shone white, glittering, and  low, with the red and white spire of a mosque rising brilliantly above  it.          VI.    ADEN.      It was cooler; and for a change we had turned into our bunks, when B.  pounded on our stateroom door.    \"In the name of the Eternal East,\" said he, \"come on deck!\"    We slipped on kimonos, and joined the row of scantily draped and  interested figures along the rail.    The ship lay quite still on a perfect sea of moonlight, bordered by a  low flat distant shore on one side, and nearer mountains on the other. A  strong flare, centred from two ship reflectors overside, made a focus of  illumination that subdued, but could not quench, the soft moonlight with  which all outside was silvered. A dozen boats, striving against a  current or clinging as best they could to the ship's side, glided into  the light and became real and solid; or dropped back into the ghostly  white unsubstantiality of the moon. They were long, narrow boats, with  small flush decks fore and aft. We looked down on them from almost  directly above, so that we saw the thwarts and the ribs and the things  they contained.    Astern in each stood men, bending gracefully against the thrust of long  sweeps. About their waists were squares of cloth, wrapped twice and  tucked in. Otherwise they were naked, and the long smooth muscles of  their slender bodies rippled under the skin. The latter was of a  beautiful fine texture, and chocolate brown. These men had keen,  intelligent, clear-cut faces, of the Greek order, as though the statues  of a garden had been stained brown and had come to life. They leaned on  their sweeps, thrusting slowly but strongly against the little wind and  current that would drift them back.    In the body of the boats crouched, sat, or lay a picturesque mob. Some  pulled spasmodically on the very long limber oars; others squatted doing  nothing; some, huddled shapelessly underneath white cloths that  completely covered them, slept soundly in the bottom. We took these for  merchandise until one of them suddenly threw aside his covering and sat  up. Others, again, poised in proud and graceful attitudes on the  extreme prows of their bobbing craft. Especially decorative were two,  clad only in immense white turbans and white cloths about the waist. An  old Arab with a white beard stood midships in one boat, quite  motionless, except for the slight swaying necessary to preserve his  equilibrium, his voluminous white draperies fluttering in the wind, his  dark face just distinguishable under his burnouse. Most of the men were  Somalis, however. Their keen small faces, slender but graceful necks,  slim, well-formed torsos bending to every movement of the boat, and the  white or gaudy draped nether garments were as decorative as the figures  on an Egyptian tomb. One or two of the more barbaric had made neat  headdresses of white clay plastered in the form of a skull-cap.    After an interval a small and fussy tugboat steamed around our stern and  drew alongside the gangway. Three passengers disembarked from her and  made their way aboard. The main deck of the craft under an awning was  heavily encumbered with trunks, tin boxes, hand baggage, tin bath-tubs,  gun cases, and all sorts of impedimenta. The tugboat moored itself to us  fore and aft, and proceeded to think about discharging. Perhaps twenty  men in accurate replica of those in the small boats had charge of the  job. They had their own methods. After a long interval devoted strictly  to nothing, some unfathomable impulse would incite one or two or three  of the natives to tackle a trunk. At it they tugged and heaved and  pushed in the manner of ants making off with a particularly large fly or  other treasure trove, tossing it up the steep gangway to the level of  our decks. The trunks once safely bestowed, all interest, all industry,  died. We thought that finished it, and wondered why the tug did not pull  out of the way. But always, after an interval, another bright idea would  strike another native or natives. He--or they--would disappear beneath  the canvas awning over the tug's deck, to emerge shortly, carrying  almost anything, from a parasol to a heavy chest.    On close inspection they proved to be a very small people. The  impression of graceful height had come from the slenderness and justness  of their proportions, the smallness of their bones, and the upright  grace of their carriage. After standing alongside one, we acquired a  fine respect for their ability to handle those trunks at all.    Moored to the other side of the ship we found two huge lighters, from  which bales of goods were being hoisted aboard. Two camels and a dozen  diminutive mules stood in the waist of one of these craft. The camels  were as sniffy and supercilious and scornful as camels always are; and  everybody promptly hated them with the hatred of the abysmally inferior  spirit for something that scorns it, as is the usual attitude of the  human mind towards camels. We waited for upwards of an hour, in the hope  of seeing those camels hoisted aboard; but in vain. While we were so  waiting one of the deck passengers below us, a Somali in white clothes  and a gorgeous cerise turban, decided to turn in. He spread a square of  thin matting atop one of the hatches, and began to unwind yards and  yards of the fine silk turban. He came to the end of it--whisk! he sank  to the deck; the turban, spread open by the resistance of the air,  fluttered down to cover him from head to foot. Apparently he fell asleep  at once, for he did not again move nor alter his position. He, as well  as an astonishingly large proportion of the other Somalis and  Abyssinians we saw, carried a queer, well-defined, triangular wound in  his head. It had long since healed, was an inch or so across, and looked  as though a piece of the skull had been removed. If a conscientious  enemy had leisure and an icepick he would do just about that sort of a  job. How its recipient had escaped instant death is a mystery.    At length, about three o'clock, despairing of the camels, we turned in.    After three hours' sleep we were again on deck. Aden by daylight seemed  to be several sections of a town tucked into pockets in bold, raw, lava  mountains that came down fairly to the water's edge. Between these  pockets ran a narrow shore road; and along the road paced haughty camels  hitched to diminutive carts. On contracted round bluffs towards the sea  were various low bungalow buildings which, we were informed, comprised  the military and civil officers' quarters. The real Aden has been built  inland a short distance at the bottom of a cup in the mountains.  Elaborate stone reservoirs have been constructed to catch rain water, as  there is no other natural water supply whatever. The only difficulty is  that it practically never rains; so the reservoirs stand empty, the  water is distilled from the sea, and the haughty camels and the little  carts do the distributing.    The lava mountains occupy one side of the spacious bay or gulf. The  foot of the bay and the other side are flat, with one or two very  distant white villages, and many heaps of glittering salt as big as  houses.    We waited patiently at the rail for an hour more to see the camels slung  aboard by the crane. It was worth the wait. They lost their impassive  and immemorial dignity completely, sprawling, groaning, positively  shrieking in dismay. When the solid deck rose to them, and the sling had  been loosened, however, they regained their poise instantaneously. Their  noses went up in the air, and they looked about them with a challenging,  unsmiling superiority, as though to dare any one of us to laugh. Their  native attendants immediately squatted down in front of them, and began  to feed them with convenient lengths of what looked like our common  marsh cat-tails. The camels did not even then manifest the slightest  interest in the proceedings. Indeed, they would not condescend to reach  out three inches for the most luscious tit-bit held that far from their  aristocratic noses. The attendants had actually to thrust the fodder  between their jaws. I am glad to say they condescended to chew.          VII.    THE INDIAN OCEAN.      Leaving Aden, and rounding the great promontory of Cape Guardafui, we  turned south along the coast of Africa. Off the cape were strange, oily  cross rips and currents on the surface of the sea; the flying-fish rose  in flocks before our bows; high mountains of peaks and flat table tops  thrust their summits into clouds; and along the coast the breakers  spouted like whales. For the first time, too, we began to experience  what our preconceptions had imagined as tropical heat. Heretofore we had  been hot enough, in all conscience, but the air had felt as though  wafted from an opened furnace door--dry and scorching. Now, although the  temperature was lower,[2] the humidity was greater.

Ta-ra-la!  Tweedle-dee went the fiddle!    \"And don't be so familiar there!  How many a one, with speeches fair,  His trusting maid will diddle!\"  But still he flattered her aside--  And from the linden sounded wide:  Huzza! huzza!  Huzza! huzza! ha! ha! ha!  And tweedle-dee the fiddle.    _Old Peasant._ Sir Doctor, this is kind of you,  That with us here you deign to talk,  And through the crowd of folk to-day  A man so highly larned, walk.  So take the fairest pitcher here,  Which we with freshest drink have filled,  I pledge it to you, praying aloud  That, while your thirst thereby is stilled,  So many days as the drops it contains  May fill out the life that to you remains.    _Faust._ I take the quickening draught and call  For heaven's best blessing on one and all.                [_The people form a circle round him._]    _Old Peasant._ Your presence with us, this glad day,  We take it very kind, indeed!  In truth we've found you long ere this  In evil days a friend in need!  Full many a one stands living here,  Whom, at death's door already laid,  Your father snatched from fever's rage,  When, by his skill, the plague he stayed.  You, a young man, we daily saw  Go with him to the pest-house then,  And many a corpse was carried forth,  But you came out alive again.  With a charmed life you passed before us,  Helped by the Helper watching o'er us.    _All._ The well-tried man, and may he live,  Long years a helping hand to give!    _Faust._ Bow down to Him on high who sends  His heavenly help and helping friends!                                  [_He goes on with_ WAGNER.]    _Wagner._ What feelings, O great man, thy heart must swell  Thus to receive a people's veneration!  O worthy all congratulation,  Whose gifts to such advantage tell.  The father to his son shows thee with exultation,  All run and crowd and ask, the circle closer draws,  The fiddle stops, the dancers pause,  Thou goest--the lines fall back for thee.  They fling their gay-decked caps on high;  A little more and they would bow the knee  As if the blessed Host came by.    _Faust._ A few steps further on, until we reach that stone;  There will we rest us from our wandering.  How oft in prayer and penance there alone,  Fasting, I sate, on holy mysteries pondering.  There, rich in hope, in faith still firm,  I've wept, sighed, wrung my hands and striven  This plague's removal to extort (poor worm!)  From the almighty Lord of Heaven.  The crowd's applause has now a scornful tone;  O couldst thou hear my conscience tell its story,  How little either sire or son  Has done to merit such a glory!  My father was a worthy man, confused  And darkened with his narrow lucubrations,  Who with a whimsical, though well-meant patience,  On Nature's holy circles mused.  Shut up in his black laboratory,  Experimenting without end,  'Midst his adepts, till he grew hoary,  He sought the opposing powers to blend.  Thus, a red lion,[11] a bold suitor, married  The silver lily, in the lukewarm bath,  And, from one bride-bed to another harried,  The two were seen to fly before the flaming wrath.  If then, with colors gay and splendid,  The glass the youthful queen revealed,  Here was the physic, death the patients' sufferings ended,  And no one asked, who then was healed?  Thus, with electuaries so satanic,  Worse than the plague with all its panic,  We rioted through hill and vale;  Myself, with my own hands, the drug to thousands giving,  They passed away, and I am living  To hear men's thanks the murderers hail!    _Wagner._ Forbear! far other name that service merits!  Can a brave man do more or less  Than with nice conscientiousness  To exercise the calling he inherits?  If thou, as youth, thy father honorest,  To learn from him thou wilt desire;  If thou, as man, men with new light hast blest,  Then may thy son to loftier heights aspire.    _Faust._ O blest! who hopes to find repose,  Up from this mighty sea of error diving!  Man cannot use what he already knows,  To use the unknown ever striving.  But let not such dark thoughts a shadow throw  O'er the bright joy this hour inspires!  See how the setting sun, with ruddy glow,  The green-embosomed hamlet fires!  He sinks and fades, the day is lived and gone,  He hastens forth new scenes of life to waken.  O for a wing to lift and bear me on,  And on, to where his last rays beckon!  Then should I see the world's calm breast  In everlasting sunset glowing,  The summits all on fire, each valley steeped in rest,  The silver brook to golden rivers flowing.  No savage mountain climbing to the skies  Should stay the godlike course with wild abysses;  And now the sea, with sheltering, warm recesses  Spreads out before the astonished eyes.  At last it seems as if the God were sinking;  But a new impulse fires the mind,  Onward I speed, his endless glory drinking,  The day before me and the night behind,  The heavens above my head and under me the ocean.  A lovely dream,--meanwhile he's gone from sight.  Ah! sure, no earthly wing, in swiftest flight,  May with the spirit's wings hold equal motion.  Yet has each soul an inborn feeling  Impelling it to mount and soar away,  When, lost in heaven's blue depths, the lark is pealing  High overhead her airy lay;  When o'er the mountain pine's black shadow,  With outspread wing the eagle sweeps,  And, steering on o'er lake and meadow,  The crane his homeward journey keeps.    _Wagner._ I've had myself full many a wayward hour,  But never yet felt such a passion's power.  One soon grows tired of field and wood and brook,  I envy not the fowl of heaven his pinions.  Far nobler joy to soar through thought's dominions  From page to page, from book to book!  Ah! winter nights, so dear to mind and soul!  Warm, blissful life through all the limbs is thrilling,  And when thy hands unfold a genuine ancient scroll,  It seems as if all heaven the room were filling.    _Faust_. One passion only has thy heart possessed;  The other, friend, O, learn it never!  Two souls, alas! are lodged in my wild breast,  Which evermore opposing ways endeavor,  The one lives only on the joys of time,  Still to the world with clamp-like organs clinging;  The other leaves this earthly dust and slime,  To fields of sainted sires up-springing.  O, are there spirits in the air,  That empire hold 'twixt earth's and heaven's dominions,  Down from your realm of golden haze repair,  Waft me to new, rich life, upon your rosy pinions!  Ay! were a magic mantle only mine,  To soar o'er earth's wide wildernesses,  I would not sell it for the costliest dresses,  Not for a royal robe the gift resign.    _Wagner_. O, call them not, the well known powers of air,  That swarm through all the middle kingdom, weaving  Their fairy webs, with many a fatal snare  The feeble race of men deceiving.  First, the sharp spirit-tooth, from out the North,  And arrowy tongues and fangs come thickly flying;  Then from the East they greedily dart forth,  Sucking thy lungs, thy life-juice drying;  If from the South they come with fever thirst,  Upon thy head noon's fiery splendors heaping;  The Westwind brings a swarm, refreshing first,  Then all thy world with thee in stupor steeping.  They listen gladly, aye on mischief bent,  Gladly draw near, each weak point to espy,  They make believe that they from heaven are sent,  Whispering like angels, while they lie.  But let us go! The earth looks gray, my friend,  The air grows cool, the mists ascend!  At night we learn our homes to prize.--  Why dost thou stop and stare with all thy eyes?  What can so chain thy sight there, in the gloaming?    _Faust_. Seest thou that black dog through stalks and stubble roaming?    _Wagner_. I saw him some time since, he seemed not strange to me.    _Faust_. Look sharply! What dost take the beast to be?    _Wagner_. For some poor poodle who has lost his master,  And, dog-like, scents him o'er the ground.    _Faust_. Markst thou how, ever nearer, ever faster,  Towards us his spiral track wheels round and round?  And if my senses suffer no confusion,  Behind him trails a fiery glare.    _Wagner_. 'Tis probably an optical illusion;  I still see only a black poodle there.    _Faust_. He seems to me as he were tracing slyly  His magic rings our feet at last to snare.    _Wagner_. To me he seems to dart around our steps so shyly,  As if he said: is one of them my master there?    _Faust_. The circle narrows, he is near!    _Wagner_. Thou seest! a dog we have, no spectre, here!  He growls and stops, crawls on his belly, too,  And wags his tail,--as all dogs do.    _Faust_. Come here, sir! come, our comrade be!    _Wagner_. He has a poodle's drollery.  Stand still, and he, too, waits to see;  Speak to him, and he jumps on thee;  Lose something, drop thy cane or sling it  Into the stream, he'll run and bring it.    _Faust_. I think you're right; I trace no spirit here,  'Tis all the fruit of training, that is clear.    _Wagner_. A well-trained dog is a great treasure,  Wise men in such will oft take pleasure.  And he deserves your favor and a collar,  He, of the students the accomplished scholar.              [_They go in through the town gate._]                STUDY-CHAMBER.          _Enter_ FAUST _with the_ POODLE.      I leave behind me field and meadow  Veiled in the dusk of holy night,  Whose ominous and awful shadow  Awakes the better soul to light.  To sleep are lulled the wild desires,  The hand of passion lies at rest;  The love of man the bosom fires,  The love of God stirs up the breast.    Be quiet, poodle! what worrisome fiend hath possest thee,  Nosing and snuffling so round the door?  Go behind the stove there and rest thee,  There's my best pillow--what wouldst thou more?  As, out on the mountain-paths, frisking and leaping,  Thou, to amuse us, hast done thy best,  So now in return lie still in my keeping,  A quiet, contented, and welcome guest.    When, in our"]]]
