And then that glorious  assurance, 'We _know_ that all things work together for good to them that  love God.' Oh, Ned, our one great need is more and stronger faith!\"    \"Yes, the faith which worketh by love! Let me read you that eighth chapter  of Romans. I do not know what could be more comforting,\" he said, taking a  small Testament from his pocket.    \"Thank you,\" she said when he had finished. \"Ah, what could be sweeter  than those concluding verses! 'For I am persuaded that neither death, nor  life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor  things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be  able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our  Lord!'\"    \"Elsie, I think if our mother had never done anything else for her  children,\" remarked Edward earnestly, \"they would owe her an eternal debt  of gratitude for storing their minds as she has with the very words of  inspiration.\"    \"Yes, 'the entrance of Thy words giveth light, it giveth understanding to  the simple.' 'The law of Thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of  gold and silver.'\"    Ben came to the door. \"Dey says dey's goin' to fotch up de anchor and  start de wessel, Marse Ed'ard. Don't you and Miss Elsie want for to see  it?\"    \"Yes, sister, do you not wish to see the last you may, for the present, of  your dear native land?\" queried Edward in a lively tone. \"'Twill take but  a moment to don hat and shawl, and I shall be proud to give you the  support of my arm.\"    \"Yes, I do,\" she said, rising with alacrity and hastily making the needful  preparations.    Ben preceded them to the deck and found comfortable seats for them in the  front rank of those who were there on the same errand.    Elsie's tears began to fall as she saw the shore receding.    \"Oh,\" she murmured very low and sadly, leaning on her brother's shoulder  and clinging more closely to him, \"shall we ever return? ever see again  the dear land of our birth and all our loved ones left behind?\"    \"There is every reason to hope so, dear sister,\" he whispered in return.  \"A voyage to Europe is not the great and perilous undertaking it used to  be; and we are under the same protecting care here as on land. 'And the  Lord, he it is that doth go before thee, he will be with thee, he will  not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.'\"    She looked her thanks. \"'Fear not;' sweet command! I must, I will obey it.  Oh, how true it is that in keeping His commands there is great reward! I  am fully convinced that in the perfect keeping of them all perfect  happiness would be found.\"    A gentleman standing near turned suddenly round. The tones of Elsie's  voice had reached him, though very few of the words.    \"Ah, I thought I could not be mistaken in that voice,\" he said  delightedly, and offering his hand in cordial greeting. \"How are you, Miss  Elsie? and you, Ned? Really you are the last people I expected to meet  here, though the very ones I should prefer above all others as _compagnons  de voyage_.\"    It was Philip Ross, Jr.    Neither of those addressed had ever enjoyed his society, and they were too  sincere and true to reciprocate his expressions of gratification at the  unexpected meeting. They accepted his offered hand, made kind inquiries in  regard to his health and that of the other members of the family, and  asked if any of them were on board.    \"No,\" he said, \"it's merely a business trip that I take quite frequently.  But ma and the girls are in Paris now, went last June and expect to stay  for another six months or longer. You two aren't here alone, eh?\"    \"Yes,\" Edward said.    \"You don't say so!\" cried Philip, elevating his eyebrows. \"Who'd ever have  believed your careful mother--not to speak of your grandfather--would ever  trust you so far from home by yourselves!\"    \"Mr. Ross,\" Edward said, reddening, \"I shall reach my majority a few  months hence, and have been considered worthy of trust by both mother and  grandpa, for years past.\"    \"Mamma did not show the slightest hesitation in committing me to his  care,\" added Elsie in her sweet, gentle tones.    \"Glad to hear it! didn't mean any insinuation that I didn't consider you  worthy of all trust, Ned; only that Mrs. Travilla and the old governor  have always been so awfully strict and particular.\"    Elsie, to whom the slang term was new, looked at the speaker with a  slightly puzzled expression; but Edward, who fully understood it, drew  himself up with offended dignity.    \"Permit me to remark, Mr. Ross, that so disrespectful an allusion to my  honored grandfather can never be other than extremely offensive to me, and  to all his children and grandchildren.\"    \"Beg your pardon, Nod, and yours, Miss Elsie\" (he would have liked to  drop the Miss, but something in her manner prevented him), \"I call my own  father the governor--behind his back you know--and meant no offence in  applying the term to Mr. Dinsmore.\"    His apology was accepted, and the talk turned upon the various objects of  interest within sight as they passed through the harbor.    When there was little more to see but sky and water, Elsie retired to her  state-room, where she stayed until evening. Then Edward came for her, and  they passed an hour very enjoyably in promenading the deck or sitting side  by side, looking out upon the moonlit waters.    \"I wish we hadn't happened upon Phil Ross,\" Edward remarked in an  undertone far from hilarious. \"I fear he will, according to custom, make  himself very disagreeable to you.\"    \"I have been thinking it over, Ned,\" she answered, \"and have come to the  conclusion that the better plan will be for you to take the first  favorable opportunity to tell him of my engagement and what is the object  of our journey.\"    \"I presume such a course will be likely to save you a good deal of  annoyance,\" Edward said; \"and as we are old acquaintances, and he  evidently full of a curiosity that will assuredly lead to his asking some  questions, I think it will be no difficult matter to give him the  information without seeming to thrust it upon him.\"    At that moment Philip came up and joined them, helping himself to a seat  on Elsie's other side. He seemed to be, as of old, on the best of terms  with himself and very graciously disposed toward Elsie.    He, too, had been thinking of the, to him, fortunate chance (Elsie would  have called it providence) which had thrown them together where for some  days they were likely to see much of each other. He had heard a report of  her engagement, but refused to credit it. \"She had always been fond of him  and it wasn't likely she would throw herself away on somebody else.\" And  now he had come to the decision to offer her his hand, heart, and fortune  without delay. He was rich enough, and why should he keep her in suspense  any longer?    He indulged in a few trivial commonplaces, then invited her to take a turn  with him on the deck.    But she declined with thanks, \"he must excuse her for she was greatly  fatigued and must retire at once.\" And with a kindly \"Good-night,\" she  withdrew to her state-room, Edward again giving her the support of his  arm.    Philip was literally struck dumb with surprise, and did not recover his  speech until she was gone.    Edward returned presently, and as he resumed his seat by Philip's side the  latter asked, \"Is your sister out of health, Ned?\"    \"No; but we are just off a long and fatiguing journey; she was not at her  best state either when we left home, because of care and nursing of the  sick children. And in addition to all that she is enduring much grief and  anxiety.\"    \"May I ask on what account?\"    \"Yes; I have no objection to telling you the whole story, considering what  old acquaintances we are, and the life-long friendship of our mothers.  Lester Leland, Elsie's betrothed, is lying very ill in Rome, and we are  making all haste to join him there.\"    \"Her betrothed!\" cried Philip, starting to his feet, \"her betrothed did  you say? why--why, I've always expected to marry her myself; thought it  was an understood thing in both families, and----\"    \"I am sure I do not know upon what grounds you entertained such an idea,\"  returned Edward in a tone of mingled indignation and disgust.    \"Grounds, man! I'm sure it would seem the most natural thing in the  world--each the eldest child of intimate and dear friends--and I have  never made any secret of my preference for her----\"    \"Which amounts to nothing unless it had been reciprocated.\"    \"Reciprocated! I've always thought it was, and delayed speaking out  plainly only because I considered myself safe in waiting to grow a little  richer.\"    \"In which you were egregiously mistaken. Now let me assure you once for  all, that Elsie never has and never will care for any man in that way but  Lester Leland.\"    At that Philip turned and walked rapidly away. \"I'd rather have lost all  I'm worth!\" he muttered to himself. \"Yes; every cent of it. But as to her  never caring for anybody else if that fellow was out o' the way, I don't  believe it. And he may die; may be dead now. Well, if he is I'll keep a  sharp look-out that nobody else gets ahead of me.\"    His self-love and self-conceit had received a pretty deep wound, his eyes  were opened to the fact that Elsie avoided being alone with him, never  appearing on deck without her brother, and he did not trouble her much  during the remainder of the voyage, did not make his intended offer.          CHAPTER V.                                       \"I feel      Of this dull sickness at my heart afraid      And in my eyes the death sparks flash and fade      And something seems to steal      Over my bosom like a frozen hand.\"                              --_Willis_.   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14893"],[0,"Prince Jan, St. Bernard (#6)"],[1,"was watching them very anxiously.    \"Do you think my father can stand the trip?\" she asked.    \"It would be less dangerous than losing time for Dr. Corey to come to  California after he reaches New York,\" both doctors declared.    Jan saw that Elizabeth's eyes were full of tears and he slipped softly  to her and pushed his nose into her hand. She glanced down and tried to  smile at him, but her lips trembled and she hurried to her room. Mrs.  Pixley followed her, and when Jan found them, Elizabeth was crying in  her mother's arms, while Mrs. Pixley, whose own face was wet with tears,  tried to comfort her. After awhile they began talking in low tones, and  Jan edged between their closely-drawn chairs, wishing very hard that he  could understand what it all meant. He would have been as much worried  as they were, had he known that Mr. Pixley's life could only be saved by  the famous surgeon from England, and that even if the operation were  successful it would mean that Elizabeth and her parents would have to be  away from home many months. But Jan was only a dog, so their words meant  nothing to him.    After that hour everything was in confusion. Servants hurried about,  trunks were dragged into Elizabeth's room, and clothes were carried from  closets and packed into the empty trunks. Every once in a while Jan  would look down into a trunk, then watch Elizabeth with his puzzled  eyes.    She saw his worried look and paused in her packing to pet him, then  suddenly she turned to her mother and said, \"Oh, mother! What about  Jan?\"    \"It will be impossible to take him with us, for we will have to stay in  a hotel, and that would be hard on Jan, and an additional care for us,  dear. Then, we may have to go to London as soon as your father is able  to travel after the operation. Dr. Corey could not stay in New York so  long.\"    \"I suppose the servants will be kind to Jan,\" went on Jan's mistress,  \"but I would feel better if old John and Mary were still here. They  loved Jan and he loved them.\"    \"These new servants seem to be all right,\" replied Mrs. Pixley. \"They  know how fond we are of Jan, and I will ask them to be kind to him.\"    \"He's such a dear old fellow, and never makes any trouble, and I don't  believe any one could help loving him!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, catching  the dog's long, silky ears and pulling them gently while his eyes,  shining with devotion, looked into her own.    Before noon the next day the trunks had been strapped and taken away.  Then Jan saw Mr. Pixley lifted into the automobile where Mrs. Pixley was  arranging pillows. Elizabeth came slowly down the steps of the porch  with Jan at her side. Then she stooped and took his head between her  hands and gazed intently at him.    \"Good-bye, Jan! I'll come back again!\"    That was what she always said when she was going away for a short time;  so Jan wagged his tail and touched her pink cheek with the tip of his  tongue. He watched the automobile turn among the orange trees that  bordered the winding driveway and waited for a last glimpse of it  through the trees. He knew that Elizabeth would turn and call to him  when she reached that point.    His ears cocked up and his eyes were bright as the machine came into  sight. Then he saw his dear mistress look back at him, her hand waved  and her voice called, \"Good-bye, Prince Jan! Be a good dog!\"    \"Woof! Woof!\" he answered, as he always answered her \"good-bye\" call.  Then the automobile vanished among the trees.    It was summer time and the middle of the day was very warm, so Jan  decided he would take a swim in the ocean. It was great sport battling  the huge waves while white sea-gulls darted screaming over his head,  fearing he would steal the fish they hoped to catch and eat. Cooled by  the water, he returned to the front porch and stretched out where he  could see the road, for he always ran and welcomed his folks when they  came home from their drives. He was very happy and comfortable until the  new housekeeper came out with a broom.    \"Get off, you dirty beast!\" she cried, shaking the broom over his head.  \"This porch was washed to-day.\"    Jan jumped up in surprise. No one had ever spoken to him that way. The  old housekeeper, who had gone away, had been his friend. Whenever the  family was absent at night Jan had kept her company in her room, and she  always had cookies there for him. John, her husband, had been the old  stableman.    The broom waved nearer. He looked into the woman's angry face, then  walked down the front steps.    \"I'll go to the stable till Elizabeth comes home,\" he thought as he went  toward the back of the house.    But, John, the stableman, who had cared for the handsome horses of the  Pixleys until automobiles filled the carriage house, had gone away to  another place where people still used horses. John had been Jan's loyal  friend. The new man, William Leavitt, had not made friends with Jan, but  there were many nice dark places, out of William's sight, where Jan  often took a nap during the heat of the day, and William never knew it.    Jan was making for a favorite spot under the old family carriage, when  William saw him.    \"Get out!\" he shouted furiously.    The dog stopped. William came closer and lifting his hand, threw a  monkey-wrench at Jan. It missed him, and the dog hurried away to the  garden, where many trees made dense shadows. There was a spot under a  low-hanging pepper tree where Jan dug into the cool, moist earth until  he had made a nice, big hole. Then he lay down and uttered a sigh of  content. His eyes closed and soon he was sound asleep.    A vicious kick wakened him, and he leaped to his feet to see the  gardener standing over him swearing. Jan ran away, but stood a short  distance off, watching the man fill up the hole under the tree. As the  man finished the work, he saw the dog and hurled a stone which struck  above Jan's eye, making a jagged cut that started to bleed.    Half-mad with pain, Jan ran until he found a place in the orange grove,  far back from the house, and trembling, he huddled down. His heart  thumped and again he suffered from the fear of things he did not  understand just as he had felt when his mother howled on the day he had  been led from the Hospice.    \"If only Elizabeth will come back soon,\" he thought, \"everything will  be right again, and the servants won't be cross to me any more.\"    The excitement of abuse for the first time in his life and the pain from  the wounded eye, which was swollen shut, made him feverish, but he kept  hidden all day, suffering from thirst rather than risk further  ill-treatment, and all the time he was listening for the sound of wheels  and the voice of Elizabeth calling him.    The sun went down, but the family had not come home. Then it grew very  quiet and dark, and Jan crawled to the back of the house for food and  water, which were always put there at sunset for him. He crept like a  thief, ready to rush back to the orange grove if he heard a step  approaching.    Both pans were in the accustomed place, but he found them empty. His  tongue was so dry and hot that he licked each pan in turn. Then he went  around to the front of the house and put his nose to a water faucet,  licking it for a drop of moisture. The pipe was dry. Jan looked out at  the ocean, over which the moon shone silvery bright, the water sparkled,  but he knew he could not drink salt water, and even to look at it now  made him more thirsty. At last, unable to resist any longer, he went to  the beach and lapped the stinging water that burnt his throat. Then he  plunged into the surf and swam out a short distance. But the waves  washed over his head and the salt in the wound made him cry with pain,  until he reached the shore and dashed back to the orange grove, where he  lay moaning pitifully.    His thirst grew worse. Jan rose to his feet, hoping the stable door  might be open, as sometimes he had seen it on warm nights, and there was  a water trough that always had water in it, for Elizabeth still rode  horseback, though the family used the automobiles. The door was closed,  so he went back to his hiding-place.    In the morning, almost crazed by thirst, Jan again sought the stable.  Drawing near, he heard water running, and, thinking of nothing else, he  rushed to the trough where cool, sparkling water flowed from the faucet.  William was there, too, but the dog rose on his hind legs and thrust his  dry tongue into the water, lapping it in big gulps.    \"Get out of that!\" he heard William order.    Jan kept on drinking greedily. Then he felt a sharp slash from a  carriage whip. He did not lift his head. Nothing could drive him from  the water. The whip struck hard and fast across his back, each cut  making him shrink, but he kept on drinking until his terrible thirst had  been quenched. Then he dropped his paws from the edge of the trough to  the floor and turned his great head, one eye closed, the other bloodshot  and glaring hate and defiance, while his teeth gleamed and an ugly snarl  rumbled in his throat.    A young fellow who was a stranger to Jan came from the back of the  building. The dog looked at him, then at William, ready to fight them  both. As Jan started toward them, William moved back. Jan growled.    \"Do you think he's gone mad, Shorty?\" asked William uneasily.    Jan did not know what the words meant, but he saw that the man was  afraid of him for some reason. He gave a fierce snarl and faced them.    \"Wouldn't drink water if he was mad,\" replied Shorty. \"Why didn't you  let him alone, anyhow? He wasn't bothering you till you hit him.\"    \"I hate dogs, and you know it,\" retorted William angrily. \"It made me  sick to see the Pixleys such fools over this one. We all had to stand  around and wait on that dog as if he was the King of England. I guess he  finds out the difference now that the family has gone.\"    Shorty moved slowly toward Jan, holding out a hand and saying,"]]]
