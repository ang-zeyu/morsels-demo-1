At the same time, my dear madam, and quite apart from your  condition--which is wonderful to me after what you've been through--at  the same time, and even with your fortitude, I think it would be  advisable to--to wait a little while.\"    The doctor raised his eyes, and all at once Rachel heard.  Overheard--outside--in the world--there was the brutal hooting of a  thoughtless mob.    \"So that is for me!\"    Rachel set her teeth.    \"On the contrary,\" said the kindly doctor, \"it may be for the witnesses;  but crowds are fickle things; and I should strongly urge you not to  court a demonstration of one sort or the other. You are best where you  are for the time being, or at all events somewhere within the precincts.  And meanwhile your solicitor is waiting to add his congratulations to  mine.\"    \"Is he, indeed!\" cried Rachel, in a voice as hard as her eye.    \"Why, to be sure,\" rejoined the other, taken somewhat aback. \"There  must be many matters for discussion between you, and he at least seems  very anxious to discuss them. In fact, I may say that he is only  awaiting my permission for an immediate interview.\"    \"Then let him await mine!\" exclaimed Rachel, in a vindictive voice for  which she was apologizing in the next breath. \"I owe you much,\" she  added, \"if only for your kindness and sympathy during these few minutes.  But to him I owe nothing that I cannot pay in cash. He tried to keep me  from telling my own story in the box--they all did--but he was the worst  of all. So I certainly do not owe him my life. He came to me and he said  what he liked; he may have forgotten what he said, but I never shall.\"    \"He would be the first to admit his error now.\"    \"Perhaps; but he believed me guilty to the very end; and I utterly  refuse to see him to-night.\"    \"Then I shall tell him so.\"    And the good doctor disappeared for the nonce, but was back in a couple  of minutes, full of the lawyer's expostulations. What did Mrs. Minchin  intend to do? Where did she propose to go? There were a hundred matters  for explanation and arrangement. Her solicitor said she had no friends,  and seemed himself most anxious to act in that capacity. Rachel's lips  curled at the thought.    \"At least,\" said she, \"I have the friends who guaranteed his bill, if  that has anything to say to his anxiety! But what I mean to do and where  I may go, are entirely my own affair. And as for the hundred matters he  mentions, he might have spoken of them during the week. Perhaps he  thought it would be waste of breath, but I should have appreciated the  risk.\"    So her solicitor was beaten off, with all the spirit which was one of  Rachel's qualities, but also with the rashness which was that quality's  defect. The man was indeed no ornament to his profession, but a  police-court practitioner of the pushing order, who had secured the case  for notoriety and nothing else. Rachel's soul sickened when she thought  of her interviews, and especially her most recent interviews, with one  whom she had never seen before her trouble, and whom she devoutly hoped  never to see again. She did not perceive that the time had come when the  lawyer might have been really useful to her. Yet his messages left her  more alive to the difficulties that lay before her as a free woman, and  to the immediate necessity of acting for herself once more.    After all there had been a silver lining to the cloud under which she  had lain so long. Others had acted for her. It had been a rest. But,  conscious of her innocence, and serene in that consciousness, she had  prepared herself rather for another life than for a new lease of this  one; and, while seeking to steel her soul to the awful sequel of a  conviction, in the other direction she had seldom looked beyond the  consummate incident of an acquittal. Life seems a royal road when it is  death that stares one in the face; but already Rachel saw the hills and  the pitfalls; for indeed they began under her nose.    She had no plans, nor a single soul to help her to make any. In all the  world she had no real friend. And yet, with the very independence to  which this isolation was largely due, she must pick and choose, and  reject, in the hour when any friend would have been better than none!    In the first ten minutes of the new life which Rachel Minchin began with  her acquittal, she had refused to see her own solicitor, and an unknown  gentleman whose card was brought to her by the Chief Warder himself.  With the card was a message which might have inspired confidence, and  the same might be said of the address. But it was enough for Rachel that  she knew no one of the name. The Chief Warder, one of the kindliest  mortals, displayed no little irritation under her repeated refusals; but  it was the agent, and not the principal, who was so importunate; and the  message was not repeated once the former could be induced to bear Mrs.  Minchin's answer. The Chief Warder did indeed return, but it was not to  make any further reference to the mysterious Mr. Steel who had craved an  interview with Mrs. Minchin. And now the good fellow was all smiles.    \"Feeling more yourself?\" said he; and, when Rachel said she was, he  asked her to listen now; and there was nothing to listen to. \"The  coast's as clear as the Criminal Court,\" explained this pleasant  official. \"A closed cab did it, with an officer on the box; and I'll  call you another as soon as you like.\"    Rachel rose at once.    \"It was kind of you to let me stay so long,\" she said. \"But I don't  think I will take a cab, thank you, if there's an underground station  within reach, and you will kindly tell me the way.\"    \"There's Blackfriars Bridge within five minutes. But you will have more  than you can carry--\"    \"I have nothing worth taking away with me,\" said Rachel, \"except the  things I stand up in; but you may give what I leave to any poor woman  who cares to have them. And I hope you will accept this trifle for  yourself, with my deep gratitude for all your kindness.\"    Indeed, the man had been kind, and his kindness would have continued to  the last had the trial ended differently. Nevertheless, Rachel's trifle  was a piece of gold, and one of her last. Nor was this pure generosity.  There was an untold joy in being able to give again. It was the first  real taste of freedom; and in another minute Rachel was free.    Oh, but what a miracle to hear her feet on the now deserted pavement, to  see her breath in the raw November night, and the lights of Ludgate Hill  beyond! Rachel raised her veil to see them better. Who would look for  her afoot so near the scene of her late ordeal? And what did it matter  who saw her and who knew her now? She was innocent; she could look the  whole world in the face once more. Oh, to rub shoulders with the world  again!    A cab came tinkling up behind her, and Rachel half thought of hailing  it, and driving through the lighted town after all; but the hansom was  occupied, and the impulse passed. She put down her veil and turned into  the stream without catching a suspicious eye. Why should they suspect  her? And again, what did it matter if they did?    \"Trial an' verdic'! Trial an' verdic'! Acquittal o' Mrs. Minchin! Trial  an' verdic'!\"    Everybody was buying the damp, pink sheets. Rachel actually bought one  herself; and overheard the opinion of the man in the street without a  pang. So she might think herself lucky! But she did, she did; in the  reaction that had come upon her with the first mouthful of raw air, in  the intoxication of treading the outer world again, she thought herself  the luckiest woman in London, and revelled rather than otherwise in the  very considerations which had appalled her in the precincts of the  court. How good, after all, to be independent as well as free! How great  to drift with the tide of innocent women and law-abiding men, once more  one of themselves, and not even a magnet for morbid curiosity! That  would come soon enough; the present was all the more to be enjoyed; and  even the vagueness of the immediate future, even the lack of definite  plans, had a glamor of their own in eyes that were yet to have their  fill of street lamps and shop windows and omnibuses and hansom cabs.    The policeman under the bridge was a joy in himself; he refreshed  Rachel's memory as to the way, without giving her an unnecessary look;  and he called her \"madam\" into the bargain! After all, it was not every  policeman who had been on duty at the Old Bailey, nor one in many  thousands of the population who had gained admission to the court.    Yet if Rachel had relieved the tedium of her trial by using her eyes a  little more; if, for example, she had condescended to look twice at the  handful of mere spectators beyond the reporters on her right, she could  scarcely have failed to recognize the good-looking, elderly man who was  at her heels when she took her ticket at Blackfriars Bridge. His white  hair was covered by his hat, but the face itself was not one to be  forgotten, with its fresh color, its small, grim mouth, and the deep-set  glitter beneath the bushy eyebrows. Rachel, however, neither recognized  nor looked again.    In a few minutes she had a better chance, when, having entered an empty  compartment in the first class, she was joined by this gentleman as the  train began to move.    Rachel hid herself behind the newspaper which she had bought, not that  she had looked twice at her companion, but because at such close  quarters, and in the comparatively fierce light of the first-class  compartment, she was terribly afraid that he might look once too often  at her. But this fear passed from her in the matchless fascination of  reading and re-reading five words in the stop-press column:--\"MINCHIN  CASE--Verdict,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12595"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 10, No. 272, (#6)"],[1,". The Spanish  bull-fight is too serious an affair for a buffoon: it is a tragedy,  and not a farce.    From these few points of comparison, it is evident that the Spanish  exhibition is a much more splendid and interesting spectacle than that  of Portugal, and that there is nearly as much difference as between a  field of battle and the sham fight of a review. Probably the Portuguese  sport has danger enough to excite common interest, and more than enough  to be a popular diversion. The place where these entertainments are  given at Lisbon, is a large octagon amphitheatre called the _Saletre_,  near the public walk behind the Rocio. It has what is called a pit, into  which the bull sometimes, but rarely, jumps, and on one side two tier of  boxes, and is capable of containing about 4,000 or 5,000 spectators. The  amusements are always exhibited on Sundays, and are generally attended  with great crowds. On Sunday last every part of the amphitheatre was  full, and the people betrayed such extravagant marks of pleasure as  I could not have expected, from their usual sedate and dull habits.           *       *       *       *       *          THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF _NEW WORKS_.           *       *       *       *       *      A TUCUMANESE SCHOOLMASTER.    The following day, July the 5th, we pursued our journey, intending to  breakfast at a village very pleasantly situated, called Vinara, six  leagues from the river of Santiago, and remarkable for the appearance  of industry which it presented. No one here seemed to live in idleness;  the women, even while gazing at our carriage, were spinning away at  the same time. I observed too, that here the cochineal plant spread  a broader leaf, and flourished with greater luxuriance in the gardens  and hedge-rows of the cottages around, than at any place I had before  visited. \"Industry is the first step to improvement, and education  follows hard upon it,\" thought I, as on foot, attracted by a busy hum  of voices, we made our way through an intervening copse towards the  spot whence it seemed to come. A fig-tree, the superincumbent branches  of which shaded a wide circuit of ground, arrested our progress; and  looking through an opening among the large green leaves, we espied  the village pedagogue, elevated on his authoritative seat, which was  attached to the trunk of the tree. He was reading a lecture on the heads  of his scholars--a phrenological dissertation, if one might judge from  its effects, with a wand long enough to bump the _caput_ of the  most remote offender. I began to think myself in some European district,  certainly not from the late samples I had seen of the country, in the  heart of the Columbian continent. There, however, I was in reality, and  in the fine province of Tucuman, with nearly half the globe's surface  between Europe and myself. The picture was a very striking one occurring  with these reflections. The beautiful vegetable-roofed school-room,  too, struck my fancy. What a delightful natural study!--the cool broad  leaves overarching it, and heightening the interest of the scene. The  striplings were seated, without regular order, on the grass, under a  rotunda of this magnificent foliage. Some were cross-legged, bawling Ba,  Be, Bi; others, with their knees for a table, seemed engraving rather  than writing, upon a wooden tablet, the size of a common slate. One or  two, who appeared to be more advanced in their studies, were furnished  with a copy-book, an expensive article in that place. Some were busy at  arithmetic, while, every moment, whack went the rod upon the crown of  the idler or yawner.    To us the sight was curious; we had seen none lately but what were the  reverse of carefully educated beings. But we had little time to think,  for a laugh burst forth at their perceiving us, which naturally  attracted the notice of the pedagogue, who took up his crutch to go and  examine the cause, for he was a cripple. We immediately came forward to  the only opening among the rich verdure, and meeting him, announced  ourselves as the intruders. He was as much surprised as his pupils had  been. His magisterial brow, for he was alcade as well as schoolmaster,  relaxed into a civil smile. He invited us to walk in, and we accepted  his invitation, and entertained ourselves with examining the progress  made by his boys in their studies, and in replies to his numerous  questions put respecting the battle of Ayacucho, the death of Olaneta,  and the termination of the war in Peru. He asked if it was true, that  the English were coming to settle in the country, with many similar  questions. In answer to our inquiries about himself, he said he was born  on the spot, lame as he was, and had never quitted it; he had given his  mind to study, but his profession was (as it is everywhere else) \"muy  pobre;\" that the price of a school education there, was from two to four  rials a month, according to what the pupil was taught. Just at that  moment a boy came up with a pen to be mended. To my surprise, he drew  from his old pair of Spanish blues (open at the knees, with a silver  buckle appended), what we denominate a Flemish or gardener's knife,  and proceeded, with the help of a pair of cracked spectacles, to nib  the pen.    \"What,\" said I, \"Viejo (old boy), have you no better instrument than  that to work with?\"    \"Nada mas Senor, yo soy muy pobre Senor.\" (Nothing more, sir, I am very  poor.)    \"Well,\" I replied, \"I think I can help you to something better than  that for the convenience of your calling,\" and I gave him an old  four-bladed English knife, which I happened to have in my pocket at  the time. On looking at it, he exclaimed in astonishment, \"Que quatro  cuchillos en uno!\" (what, four blades in one knife!) Ha had never beheld  such a machine in his life. I told him it was of English manufacture.  \"Caramba!\" he replied, \"los Ingleses son hombres muy habiles;\" (the  English are very clever.) I told him it was at his service. \"Por nada,\"  (for nothing) I answered. He immediately crossed himself, exclaiming  \"Gracias a Dios,\" (thank God). He could not have shown more satisfaction  had it been a ton of gold or a lottery-ticket of twenty thousand  sterling. His urchins crowded around him to see his treasure, and to get  a holiday from him on the strength of his satisfaction, which we made  him half promise, and left him.--_Andrews' Journal from Buenos Ayres_.           *       *       *       *       *      WARMING AND VENTILATING HOUSES.    Excellent fuel is so cheap in Britain, owing to the profusion with which  beds of rich coal are scattered among the mineral treasures of this  favoured portion of the earth, that a careless expenditure has arisen;  which, however, instead of securing the comfort and health that might be  expected, has led to plans of warming that often prove destructive to  both. In cold countries, where fuel is more scarce, as in the north of  continental Europe, and where, to retain and preserve the heat once  obtained, the inhabitants use thick walls, double windows, close  joinings, and close stoves or fire-places, which have no communication  with the apartments, but draw their supply of air from without, that  the temperate air of the room may not be wasted,--these means, when  sufficient ventilation is added, prove very favourable to health,  by giving a uniform and temperate warmth, instead of extremes and  fluctuations. But in England, the apartments, with their open chimnies,  may be compared to great aerial funnels, constantly pouring out their  warm air through a large opening, and constantly requiring to be  replenished; and where, from the irregularity of the supply or of the  discharge, the temperature is constantly fluctuating.    By the close stove and apartment fuel is saved to a great extent--they  also produce a uniformity of temperature; first, as regards the  different parts of the room, so that the occupiers may sit anywhere; and  secondly, as regards the different times of the day; for the stove once  heated in the morning, often suffices to maintain a steady warmth until  night; the heat can be carried to any required degree, and ventilation  is easily effected as desired. * * *    Consumption is the disease which carries off a fifth or more of the  persons born in Britain, owing in part, no doubt, to the changeableness  of the climate, but much more to the faulty modes of warming and  ventilating the houses. To judge of the influence of temperature in  producing this disease, we may consider--that miners who live under  ground, and are always, therefore, in the same temperature, are  strangers to it; while their brothers and relations, exposed to the  vicissitudes of the weather above, fall victims--that butchers and  others who live almost constantly in the open air, and are hardened by  the exposure, enjoy nearly equal immunity--that consumption is hardly  known in Russia, where close stoves and houses preserve a uniform  temperature--and that in all countries and situations, whether tropical,  temperate, or polar, the frequency of the disease bears relation to  the frequency of change. We may here remark, also, that it is not  consumption alone which springs from changes of temperature, but a great  proportion of acute diseases, and particularly of our common winter  diseases. In how many cases has the invalid to remark, that if he had  not taken cold in such a place, or on such an occasion, he might yet  have been well. * * *    The following considerations present themselves in this place.--Small  rooms in winter are more dangerous to health than large ones, because  the cold air, entering towards the fire by the doors or windows, reaches  persons before it can be tempered by mixing with the warmer air of the  room--Stoves in halls and staircases are useful, because they warm the  air before it enters the rooms; and they prevent the hurtful chills  often felt on passing through a"]]]
