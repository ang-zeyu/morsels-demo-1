'I am my husband's,' she said, 'and that is my honor; for--        'Beautiful the Koil[10] seemeth for the sweetness of his song,      Beautiful the world esteemeth pious souls for patience strong;      Homely features lack not favor when true wisdom they reveal,      And a wife is fair and honored while her heart is firm and leal.'    What the lord of my life enjoins, that I do.'    'Is such my answer?' asked the attendant.    'It is,' said Lavanyavati.    Upon the messenger reporting her reply to the Prince, he was in despair.    'The God of the five shafts has hit me,' he exclaimed, 'and only her  presence will cure my wound.'    'We must make her husband bring her, then,' said the messenger.    'That can never be,' replied the Prince.    'It can,' replied the messenger--        'Fraud may achieve what force would never try:--      The Jackal killed the Elephant thereby.'    'How was that?' asked the Prince. The Slave related:--      THE STORY OF THE OLD JACKAL AND THE ELEPHANT    \"In the forest of Brahma[11] lived an Elephant, whose name was  'White-front.' The Jackals knew him, and said among themselves, 'If this  great brute would but die, there would be four months' food for us, and  plenty, out of his carcase.' With that an old Jackal stood up, and  pledged himself to compass the death of the Elephant by his own wit.  Accordingly, he sought for 'White-front,' and, going up to him, he made  the reverential prostration of the eight members, gravely saluting him.    'Divine creature,' said he, 'vouchsafe me the regard of one look.'    'Who art thou?' grunted the Elephant,'and whence comest thou?'    'I am only a Jackal,' said the other; 'but the beasts of the forest are  convinced that it is not expedient to live without a king, and they have  met in full council, and despatched me to acquaint your Royal Highness  that on you, endowed with so many lordly qualities, their choice has  fallen for a sovereign over the forest here; for--        'Who is just, and strong, and wise?      Who is true to social ties?      He is formed for Emperies.    Let your Majesty, therefore, repair thither at once, that the moment of  fortunate conjunction may not escape us.' So saying he led the way,  followed at a great pace by White-front, who was eager to commence his  reign.    \"Presently the Jackal brought him upon a deep slough, into which he  plunged heavily before he could stop himself.    'Good master Jackal,' cried the Elephant,'what's to do now? I am up to  my belly in this quagmire.'    'Perhaps your Majesty,' said the Jackal, with an impudent laugh, 'will  condescend to take hold of the tip of my brush with your trunk, and so  get out.'    'Then White-front, the Elephant, knew that he had been deceived; and  thus he sank in the slime, and was devoured by the Jackals. Hence,'  continued the attendant, 'is why I suggested stratagem to your  Highness,'    Shortly afterwards, by the Slave's advice, the Prince sent for the  merchant's son (whose name was Charudatta), and appointed him to be near  his person; and one day, with the same design, when he was just come  from the bath, and had on his jewels, he summoned Charudatta, and said--    \"I have a vow to keep to Gauri--bring hither to me every evening for a  month some lady of good family, that I may do honor to her, according to  my vow; and begin to-day.\"    Charudatta in due course brought a lady of quality, and, having  introduced her, retired to watch the interview. The Prince, without even  approaching his fair visitor, made her the most respectful obeisances,  and dismissed her with gifts of ornaments, sandal-wood, and perfumes,  under the protection of a guard. This made Charudatta confident, and  longing to get some of these princely presents he brought his own wife  next evening. When the Prince recognized the charming Lavanyavati--the  joy of his soul--he sprang to meet her, and kissed and caressed her  without the least restraint. At sight of this the miserable Charudatta  stood transfixed with despair--the very picture of wretchedness'----    'And you too, Slow-toes--but where is he gone?' abruptly asked King  Golden-skin.    Now Slow-toes had not chosen to wait the end of the story, but was gone  before, and Golden-skin and the others followed him up in some anxiety.  The Tortoise had been painfully travelling along, until a hunter, who  was beating the wood for game, had overtaken him. The fellow, who was  very hungry, picked him up, fastened him on his bow-stick, and set off  for home; while the Deer, the Crow, and the Mouse, who had witnessed  the capture, followed them in terrible concern. 'Alas!' cried the  Mouse-king, 'he is gone!--and such a friend!        'Friend! gracious word!--the heart to tell is ill able      Whence came to men this jewel of a syllable.'    'Let us,' continued he to his companions, 'let us make one attempt, at  least, to rescue Slow-toes before the hunter is out of the wood!'    'Only tell us how to do it,' replied they.    'Do thus,' said Golden-skin: 'let Dapple-back hasten on to the water,  and lie down there and make himself appear dead; and do you, Light o'  Leap, hover over him and peck about his body. The hunter is sure to put  the Tortoise down to get the venison, and I will gnaw his bonds.'    'The Deer and the Crow started at once; and the hunter, who was sitting  down to rest under a tree and drinking water, soon caught sight of the  Deer, apparently dead. Drawing his wood-knife, and putting the Tortoise  down by the water, he hastened to secure the Deer, and Golden-skin, in  the meantime, gnawed asunder the string that held Slow-toes, who  instantly dropped into the pool. The Deer, of course, when the hunter  got near, sprang up and made off, and when he returned to the tree the  Tortoise was gone also. \"I deserve this,\" thought he--        'Whoso for greater quits his gain,      Shall have his labor for his pain;      The things unwon unwon remain,      And what was won is lost again.'    And so lamenting, he went to his village. Slow-toes and his friends,  quit of all fears, repaired together to their new habitations, and there  lived happily.    Then spake the King Sudarsana's sons, \"We have heard every word, and are  delighted; it fell out just as we wished.\"    \"I rejoice thereat, my Princes,\" said Vishnu-Sarman; \"may it also fall  out according to this my wish--        \"Lakshmi give you friends like these!      Lakshmi keep your lands in ease!      Set, your sovereign thrones beside,      Policy, a winsome bride!

THE PARTING OF FRIENDS    Then spake the Royal Princes to Vishnu-Sarman,    \"Reverend Sir! we have listened to the 'Winning of Friends,' we would  now hear how friends are parted.\"    \"Attend, then,\" replied the Sage, \"to 'the Parting of Friends,' the  first couplet of which runs in this wise--        'The Jackal set--of knavish cunning full--      At loggerheads the Lion and the Bull.'    \"How was that?\" asked the sons of the Rajah.    Vishnu-Sarman proceeded to relate:--      THE STORY OF THE LION, THE JACKALS, AND THE BULL    \"In the Deccan there is a city called Golden-town, and a wealthy  merchant lived there named Well-to-do. He had abundant means, but as  many of his relations were even yet richer, his mind was bent: upon  outdoing them by gaining more. Enough is never what we have--        'Looking down on lives below them, men of little store are great;      Looking up to higher fortunes, hard to each man seems his fate.'    And is not wealth won by courage and enterprise?--        'As a bride, unwisely wedded, shuns the cold caress of eld,      So, from coward souls and slothful, Lakshmi's favors turn repelled.'        'Ease, ill-health, home-keeping, sleeping, woman-service, and content--      In the path that leads to greatness these be six obstructions sent.'    And wealth that increases not, diminishes--a little gain is so far  good--        'Seeing how the soorma wasteth, seeing how the ant-hill grows,      Little adding unto little--live, give, learn, as life-time goes.'        'Drops of water falling, falling, falling, brim the chatty o'er;      Wisdom comes in little lessons--little gains make largest store.'    Moved by these reflections Well-to-do loaded a cart with wares of all  kinds, yoked two bulls to it, named Lusty-life and Roarer, and started  for Kashmir to trade. He had not gone far upon his journey when in  passing through a great forest called Bramble-wood, Lusty-life slipped  down and broke his foreleg. At sight of this disaster Well-to-do fell  a-thinking, and repeated--        'Men their cunning schemes may spin--      God knows who shall lose or win.'

Your sympathy  does me good. It is impossible for me to go to London at present, being  involved here in various ways; but God will, I trust, aid me, and enable me  to visit London next winter, when I shall bring the new symphonies with me.    I every day expect the text for a new _oratorio_, which I am to write for  our Musical Society here, and no doubt it will be of use to us in London  also. Do what you can on my behalf, for I greatly need it. I should have  been glad to receive any commission from the Philharmonic, but Neate's  report of the all but failure of the three overtures vexed me much. Each in  its own style not only pleased here, but those in E flat major and C major  made a profound impression, so that the fate of those works at the  Philharmonic is quite incomprehensible to me.    You have no doubt received the arrangement of the Quintet [Op. 104, see No.  238] and the Sonata [Op. 106]. See that both, especially the Quintet, be  engraved without loss of time. There is no such hurry about the Sonata,  though I should like it to appear within two or three months. Never having  received the previous letter to which you allude, I had no scruple in  disposing of both works here; but for Germany only. It will be at any rate  three months before the Sonata appears here, but you must make haste with  the Quintet. As soon as you forward me a check for the money, I will send  an authority to the publisher, securing him the exclusive right to these  works for England, Scotland, Ireland, France, &c., &c.    You shall receive by the next post the _Tempi_ of the Sonata marked in  accordance with Maelzel's metronome. Prince Paul Esterhazy's courier, De  Smidt, took the Quintet and the Sonata with him. You shall also have my  portrait by the next opportunity, as I understand that you really wish for  it.    Farewell! Continue your regard for me,    Your friend,    BEETHOVEN.    All sorts of pretty compliments to your pretty wife!!! From me!!!!      261.    TO RIES.    Vienna, April 16, 1819.    DEAR RIES,--    Here are the _Tempi_ of the Sonata.    1st Allegro, Allegro (alone), erase the _assai_. Maelzel's metronome  [half-note] = 138.    2d movement, Scherzoso. Maelzel's metronome [half-note] = 80.    3d movement, Maelzel's metronome [eighth-note] = 92.    Observe that a previous bar is to be inserted here, namely:--    [Music: New bar. Piano Staves (treble & bass), D major, 6/8 time.]    4th movement, Introduzione--largo. Maelzel's metronome [sixteenth-note] =  76.    5th and last movement, 3/4 time. Maelzel's metronome [half-note] = 144.    [Music: Treble clef, B-flat major.]    Pray forgive the confused way in which this is written. It would not  surprise you if you knew my situation; you would rather marvel that I  accomplish so much in spite of it. The Quintet can no longer be delayed,  and must shortly appear; but not the Sonata, until I get an answer from you  and the check, which I long to see. The name of the courier is De Smidt, by  whom you will receive both the Quintet and Sonata. I beg you will give me  an immediate answer. I will write more fully next time.    In haste, your    BEETHOVEN.      262.    TO RIES.    April 19, 1819.    MY DEAR FRIEND,--    I ask your forgiveness a thousand times for the trouble I cause you. I  cannot understand how it is that there are so many mistakes in the copying  of the Sonata. This incorrectness no doubt proceeds from my no longer being  able to keep a copyist of my own; circumstances have brought this about.  May God send me more prosperity, till ---- is in a better position! This  will not be for a whole year to come. It is really dreadful the turn  affairs have taken, and the reduction of my salary, while no man can tell  what the issue is to be till the aforesaid year has elapsed.    If the Sonata be not suitable for London, I could send another, or you  might omit the _Largo_, and begin at once with the _Fugue_ in the last  movement, or the first movement, _Adagio_, and the third the _Scherzo_, the  _Largo_, and the _Allegro risoluto_. I leave it to you to settle as you  think best. This Sonata was written at a time of great pressure. It is hard  to write for the sake of daily bread; and yet I have actually come to this!    We can correspond again about my visit to London. To be rescued from this  wretched and miserable condition is my only hope of deliverance, for as it  is I can neither enjoy health, nor accomplish what I could do under more  favorable auspices.      263.    TO THE PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY IN LAIBACH.[1]    Vienna, May 4, 1819.    I fully appreciate the high compliment paid to me by the respected members  of the Philharmonic Society, in acknowledgment of my poor musical deserts,  by electing me honorary member of their Society, and sending me the diploma  through Herr von Tuscher; and as a proof of my sense of this honor, I  intend in due course to forward to the Society an unpublished work of  mine.[2] Moreover, at any time when I can be of use to the Society, I shall  be prepared to forward their wishes.    I remain,  the humble servant and honorary member  of the Philharmonic Society,    LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: In Dr. Fr. Keesbacher's pamphlet, \"_The Philharmonic Society  in Laibach, from 1702 to 1862_,\" he says:--\"The Philharmonic Society,  always anxious to add to its lustre by attracting honorary members,  resolved to appoint the great master of harmony as one of these. This idea  had previously occurred to them in 1808. At that time they asked Dr. Anton  Schmidt whether he thought that the election of Beethoven, and also  Hummel's son, would contribute to the advancement of the Society. On that  occasion the Society appear to have had recourse to Haydn for the  composition of a Canon; whether they applied to him for a new one or an  already existing one is not known. Schmidt replied, 'I, for my part, with  such an object in view, would prefer giving my vote for the latter,  (Hummel's son, who is second Kapellmeister, Haydn being the first, to the  reigning Prince Niklas Esterhazy.) _Beethoven is as full of caprice as he  is devoid of complaisance._ I have not seen Father Haydn for a long time,  his residence being so distant. He is now in failing health and scarcely  ever writes; I will, however, shortly call on him and make the attempt to  get a Canon from him.' This discouraging picture of Beethoven, who had  indeed too often a repulsive manner, might well deprive the Society of all  courage to think any more of him as one of their honorary members. On the  15th of March, 1819, however, the Society prepared the diploma for  Beethoven, the usually stereotyped form being exceptionally varied in his  honor, and running thus:--'The Philharmonic Society here, whose aim it is  to promote refinement of feeling and cultivation of taste in the science of  music, and who strive by their incessant efforts to impart to the Society  both inwardly and outwardly, by the judicious selection of new members,  greater value, solidity, and distinction, are universally animated with the  desire to see their list adorned by the name of Beethoven. The organ of  this society, the undersigned directors, fulfil the general wish in thus  performing _their most agreeable duty_, and giving you, sir, the strongest  proof of their profound admiration, by appointing you one of their honorary  members.--Laibach, March 15, 1819.'\" A fac-simile of Beethoven's  handwriting is hung up in a frame under glass in the hall of the Society  and affixed to Dr. Keesbacher's pamphlet.]    [Footnote 2: We are told, \"One work alone of Beethoven's in the collection  of the Society bears visible marks of coming from his own hand, and that is  the _Pastoral Symphony_.\" The above-mentioned copy is a MS. score (though  not in his writing); on the cover is written by himself in red pencil, now  almost illegible, \"Sinfonie Pastorale;\" and underneath are inscribed the  following words in ink by another hand: \"Beethoven's writing in red  pencil.\" This score contains various corrections in pencil. Two of these  appear to be by Beethoven, but unluckily the pencil marks are so much  effaced that it is difficult to decide as to the writing. In the scene \"By  the Rivulet,\" where the 12/8 time begins (in B flat major), these words are  written, \"Violoncelli tutti con Basso.\" The B especially recalls his mode  of writing. Moreover the _tempo_ at the beginning of \"The Shepherd's Song,\"  (in F, 6/8 time,) _allegretto_, is qualified by the same hand in pencil  thus, _Quasi allegro_. No direct proof exists of this being sent by him.]      264.    TO F. RIES,--LONDON.    Vienna, May 25, 1819.    ... I was at the time burdened with cares beyond all I had ever in my life  known,[1] caused solely by my too lavish benefits to others. Do compose  industriously! My dear pupil the Archduke Rudolph and I frequently play  your works, and he says that my quondam pupil does honor to his master. Now  farewell! as I hear that your wife is so handsome, I venture to embrace her  in imagination only, though I hope to have that pleasure in person next  winter.    Do not forget the Quintet, and the Sonata, and the money, I mean the  _Honoraire, avec ou sans honneur_. I hope soon to hear good news from you,  not in _allegro_ time, but _veloce prestissimo_.    This letter will be given to you by an intelligent Englishman; they are  generally very able fellows, with whom I should like to pass some time in  their own country.    _Prestissimo--Responsio  De suo amico e Maestro,_    BEETHOVEN.    [Footnote 1: In Schindler's _Beethoven's Nachlass_ there is a large  calendar of the years 1819 used by Beethoven, in which he has marked,  \"Arrived at Moedling May 12!!!--_miser sum pauper_.\" Carl too was again ill  at that time. Beethoven took him to Bloechlinger's Institution, June 22.]      265.    TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.    1819.    I learned with deep sorrow of your being again"]]]
