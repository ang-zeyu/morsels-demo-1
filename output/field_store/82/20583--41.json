If  he is not having to hold a milk pail or a calf, he says, he is doing a  household chore or even keeping watch for them while they neglect their  work and gossip. The cowgirls listen in astonishment and go away.    Another day Krishna is playing in a courtyard and takes it into his head  to eat some dirt. Yasoda is told of it and in a fit of anger runs towards  him with a stick. 'Why are you eating mud?' she cries. 'What mud?' says  Krishna. 'The mud one of your friends has just told me you have eaten. If  you haven't eaten it, open your mouth.' Krishna opens it and looking  inside, Yasoda sees the three worlds. In a moment of perception, she  realizes that Krishna is God. 'What am I doing in looking upon the Lord of  the three worlds as my son?' she cries. Then the vision fades and she  picks up Krishna and kisses him.    Another day, Yasoda asks the married cowgirls to assist her in churning  milk. They clean the house, set up a large vessel, prepare the churning  staff and string, and start to churn. Krishna is awakened by the noise and  finding no one about comes crying to Yasoda. 'I am hungry, mother,' he  says. 'Why have you not given me anything to eat?' And in a fit of  petulance he starts to throw the butter about and kick over the pitchers.  Yasoda tells him not to be so naughty, sits him on her lap and gives him  some milk. While she is doing this, a cowgirl tells her that the milk has  boiled over and Yasoda jumps up leaving Krishna alone. While she is away  he breaks the pots, scatters the curds, makes a mess of all the rooms and,  taking a pot full of butter, runs away with it into the fields. There he  seats himself on an upturned mortar, assembles the other boys and vastly  pleased with himself, laughingly shares the butter out. When Yasoda  returns and sees the mess, she seizes a stick and goes to look for  Krishna. She cannot find it in her heart, however, to be angry for long  and when Krishna says, 'Mother, let me go. I did not do it,' she laughs  and throws the stick away. Then pretending to be still very angry, she  takes him home and ties him to a mortar. A little later a great crash is  heard. Two huge trees have fallen and when the cowherds hurry to the spot,  they find that Krishna has dragged the mortar between the trunks, pulled  them down and is quietly sitting between them.[17] Two youths--by name Nala  and Kuvara--have been imprisoned in the trees and Krishna's action has  released them. When she sees that Krishna is safe, Yasoda unties him from  the mortar and hugs him to her.    This incident of the trees now forces Nanda to make a decision. The  various happenings have been profoundly unnerving and he feels that it is  no longer safe to stay in Gokula. He decides therefore to move a day's  march farther on, to cross the river and settle in the forests of  Brindaban. The cowherds accordingly load up their possessions on carts and  the move ensues.[18]    The story now enters its second phase. Krishna is no longer a mischievous  baby, indulging in tantrums yet wringing the heart with his childish  antics. He is now five years old and of an age to make himself useful. He  asks to be allowed to graze the calves. At first Yasoda is unwilling. 'We  have got so many servants,' she says. 'It is their job to take the calves  out. Why go yourself? You are the protection of my eye-lids and dearer to  me than my eyes.' Krishna, however, insists and in the end she entrusts  him and Balarama to the other young cowherds, telling them on no account  to leave them alone in the forest, but to bring them safely home. Her  words are, in fact, only too necessary, for Kansa, the tyrant king, is  still in quest of the child who is to kill him. His demon minions are  still on the alert, attacking any likely boy, and as Krishna plays with  the cowherds and tends the calves, he suffers a further series of attacks.    A cow demon, Vatsasura, tries to mingle with the herd. The calves sense  its presence and as it sidles up, Krishna seizes it by the hind leg,  whirls it round his head and dashes it to death. A crane demon, Bakasura,  then approaches. The cowherds recognize it, but while they are wondering  how to escape, the crane opens its beak and engulfs Krishna. Krishna,  however, becomes so hot that the crane cannot retain him. It lets him go.  Krishna then tears its beak in two, rounds up the calves and taking the  cowherd boys with him, returns home.    Another day Krishna is out in the forest with the cowherds and the calves,  when a snake demon, Ugrasura, sucks them into its mouth. Krishna expands  his body to such an extent that the snake bursts. The calves and cowherd  children come tumbling out and all praise Krishna for saving them. On the  way back, Krishna suggests that they should have a picnic and choosing a  great _kadam_ tree, they sweep the place clean, set out their food and  proceed to enjoy it. As they eat, the gods look down, noting how handsome  the young Krishna has grown. Among the gods is Brahma, who decides to  tease Krishna by hiding the calves while the cowherd children are  eating.[19] He takes them to a cave and when Krishna goes in search of  them, hides the cowherd children as well. Krishna, however, is not to be  deterred. Creating duplicates of every calf and boy he brings them home.  No one detects that anything is wrong and for a year they live as if  nothing has happened. Brahma has meanwhile sunk himself in meditation, but  suddenly recalls his prank and hurries out to set matters right. He is  astonished to find the original calves and children still sleeping in the  cave, while their counterparts roam the forest. He humbly worships  Krishna, restores the original calves and children and returns to his  abode. When the cowherd children awake, Krishna shows them the calves. No  one realizes what has happened. The picnic continues and laughing and  playing they go home.    We now enter the third phase of Krishna's childhood. He is eight years old  and is therefore competent to graze not merely the calves but the cows as  well.[20] Nanda accordingly performs the necessary ritual and Krishna goes  with the cowherds to the forest.    An idyllic phase in Krishna's life now starts. 'At this time Krishna and  Balarama, accompanied by the cow-boys, traversed the forests, that echoed  with the hum of bees and the peacock's cry. Sometimes they sang in chorus  or danced together; sometimes they sought shelter from the cold beneath  the trees; sometimes they decorated themselves with flowery garlands,  sometimes with peacocks' feathers; sometimes they stained themselves of  various hues with the minerals of the mountain; sometimes weary they  reposed on beds of leaves, and sometimes imitated in mirth the muttering  of the thundercloud; sometimes they excited their juvenile associates to  sing, and sometimes they mimicked the cry of the peacock with their pipes.  In this manner participating in various feelings and emotions, and  affectionately attached to each other, they wandered, sporting and happy,  through the wood. At eveningtide came Krishna and Balarama, like to  cowboys, along with the cows and the cowherds. At eveningtide the two  immortals, having come to the cow-pens, joined heartily in whatever sports  amused the sons of the herdsmen.'[21]    One day as they are grazing the cows, they play a game. Krishna divides  the cows and cowherds into two sides and collecting flowers and fruits  pretends that they are weapons. They then stage a mock battle, pelting  each other with the fruits. A little later Balarama takes them to a grove  of palm trees. The ass demon, Dhenuka, guards it. Balarama, however,  seizes it by its hind legs, twists it round and hurls it into a high tree.  From the tree the demon falls down dead. When Dhenuka's companion asses  hasten to the spot, Krishna kills them also. The cowherds then pick the  coconuts to their hearts' content, fill a quantity of baskets and having  grazed the cows, go strolling home.    The next morning Krishna rises early, calls the cowherds and takes the  cows to the forest. As they are grazing them by the Jumna, they reach a  dangerous whirlpool. In this whirlpool lives the giant snake, Kaliya,  whose poison has befouled the water, curdling it into a great froth. The  cowherds and the cattle drink some of it, are taken ill, but revive at  Krishna's glance. They then play ball. A solitary _kadam_ tree is on the  bank. Krishna climbs it and a cowherd throws the ball up to him. The ball  goes into the water and Krishna, thinking this the moment for quelling the  great snake, plunges in after it. Kaliya detects that an intruder has  entered the pool, begins to spout poison and fire and encircles Krishna in  its coils. In their alarm the cowherds send word to Nanda and along with  Yasoda, Rohini and the other cowgirls, he hastens to the scene. Krishna  can no longer be seen and in her agitation Yasoda is about to throw  herself in. Krishna, however, is merely playing with the snake. In a  moment he expands his body, jumps from the coils and begins to dance on  the snake's heads. 'Having the weight of three worlds,' the _Purana_ says,  'Krishna was very heavy.' The snake fails to sustain this dancing burden,  its heads droop and blood flows from its tongues. It is about to die when  the snake-queens bow at Krishna's feet and implore his mercy. Krishna  relents, spares the snake's life but banishes it to a distant island.[22]  He then leaves the river, but the exhaustion of the cowherds and cowgirls  is so great that they decide to stay in the forest for the night and  return to Brindaban next morning. Their trials, however, are far from  over. At midnight there is a heavy storm and a huge conflagration. Scarlet  flames leap up, dense smoke engulfs the forest and many cattle are burnt  alive.

Everybody had forgotten about it for over Seven  Hundred Years until Sister and I hired a Man to find it. Sister is now  Lady Frost-Simpson and lives on the Other Side.

I have  seen the Prince.\"    [Illustration: ANCESTOR]    \"Then you are an Englishman?\" queried the Traveler who had Bet that way.    \"It is not admitted in London,\" was the sorrowful Reply. \"Sometimes if  Frost-Simpson has to come Home for Money while I am visiting Sister, he  puts me up at the Clubs and all the Chaps seem to think I am an  American. I try to be exactly like them, but I fail. They say I have an  Accent, although I have been working all my Life to overcome it. I have  not used the word 'Guess' for many Years.\"    \"Yours is a Sad Case,\" remarked the Second Traveler. \"Why do you ever  come back?\"    \"To collect my Income,\" was the Reply. \"Isn't it a Bore? Rents and all  that sort of Rot, you know.\"    \"But you have not settled the Bet,\" said one of the Persistent  Travelers. \"Are you a Yankee?\"    \"I have never Admitted it, and I cannot do so now,\" said the  Brother-in-Law of Lord Frost-Simpson. \"At the same time, it is on Record  that I was born at Pontiac, Michigan. Of course, you know What I am  Striving to be. But there must be a Handicap somewhere. During the Two  Hundred Years in which my Ancestors temporarily resided in the States,  they must have absorbed some of the Characteristics of this Uncouth and  Vulgar People, and as a Result the Sins of the Father are visited upon  the Child even to the third and fourth Generations, and I cannot hold a  Monocle in my Eye to save my Life. I live Abroad, and strive to Forget,  and work hard to be just like the other Fellows, but I do not seem to  Arrive. Even in this Beastly Country, where the Imitation Article  usually passes current as the Real Thing, there seems to be some Doubt  as to my Case, seeing that you two Persons have made this Bet.  Concerning the Bet, I fear that I am unable to Decide it.

MORAL: _Be Something_.          _THE_ FABLE _OF THE_ ADULT GIRL WHO GOT BUSY BEFORE THEY COULD RING  _THE_ BELL _ON_ HER      Once upon a Time there was a Lovely and Deserving Girl named Clara, who  was getting so near Thirty that she didn't want to Talk about it.  Everybody had a Good Word for her. She traveled with the Thoroughbreds,  and was always Among Those Present; so it was hard to understand why she  hadn't Married. Other Girls not as Good-Looking or Accomplished had been  grabbed off while they were Buds. Already some of them were beginning to  act as Chaperons for Clara. They were keeping Tab on Clara's Age, too,  and began to think that she would land on the Bargain Counter, and have  to be satisfied with a Widower who wore a Toupee and dyed his Eyebrows.    Clara was somewhat of a Mind-Reader. She knew that the Friends of her  Youth were predicting a Hard Finish for her, so she decided to Fool  them. And she knew that it Behooved her to Catch On before the Children  started in to call her Auntie.    Now it is not to be inferred that Clara was what the Underwriters call a  Bad Risk. She never had been a Drug on the Market. When she went to a  Hop she did not have to wait for Ladies' Choice in order to swing into  the Mazy. In fact, she had been Engaged now and then, just for Practice,  and she had received Offers from some of the holdover Bachelors who went  around Proposing from Force of Habit. But Clara was not out for any man  who had been Turned Down elsewhere. She wanted the Right Kind, and she  was going to do the Picking herself.    Having made an Inventory of the Possibilities, she selected the  Treasurer of the Shoe Factory, and decided that she could Love him  without Straining herself. He was about her age, and was almost as  good-looking as a Gibson Man, and had A1 Prospects. It would be no Easy  Job to Land him, however, because the Competition was very keen and he  was Wary, trying to be a Kind Friend to every Girl he knew, but playing  no Favorites. He kept the Parents guessing. He had been Exposed to  Matrimony so often without being Taken Down, that he was generally  regarded as an Immune.    Clara got Busy with herself and hatched a Scheme. When all the Smart Set  got ready to pike away for the Heated Term, Clara surprised her Friends  by guessing that she would remain at Home. It was a Nervy Thing to do,  because all the Social Head-Liners who could command the Price were  supposed to flit off to a Summer Hotel, and loiter on the Pine Veranda  and try to think they were Recuperating.    Clara told her Mother to go, as usual, but she would stay at Home and be  a Companion to poor lonesome Papa. So all the Women went away to the  Resorts with their Cameras and Talcum Powder and Witch Hazel, and Clara  was left alone in Town with the Men.    [Illustration: CLARA]    It is a Traditional Fact that there is no Social Life in Town during the  Dog Days. But there is nothing to prevent a Bright Girl from Starting  Something. That is what Clara did.    She stocked up the Refrigerator, and hung a Hammock on the Lawn with a  few Easy Chairs around it. The Young Men marooned in Town heard of the  Good Thing, and no one had to tear their Garments to induce them to  come. They arrived at the rate of from Seven to Twelve a Night, and  dipped into Papa's Cigars and the Liquid Nourishment, regardless.  Although Clara had remained in town to act as Companion to Papa, it was  noticed that when she had all the Company in the Evening, Papa either  had been Chloroformed and put to Bed or else he had his Orders to stay  Under Cover.    Clara did not send for the Treasurer of the Shoe Factory. She knew  better than to go out after her Prey. She allowed him to find his Way to  the House with the others. When he came, she did not chide him for  failing to make his Party Call; neither did she rush toward him with a  Low Cry of Joy, thereby tipping her Hand. She knew that the Treasurer of  the Shoe Factory was Next to all these Boarding School Tactics, and  could not be Handled by the Methods that go with the College Students.  Clara had enjoyed about ten years' Experience in handling the Creatures,  and she had learned to Labor and to Wait. She simply led him into the  Circle and took his Order, and allowed him to sit there in the Gloaming  and observe how Popular she was. All the men were Scrapping to see who  would be Next to sit in the Hammock with her. It looked for a while as  if Clara would have to give out Checks, the same as in a Barber Shop.  Late that night when the Men walked homeward together, they remarked  that Clara was a Miserable Hostess, they didn't think.    Next Evening the Treasurer of the Shoe Factory was back on the Lawn. So  were all the Others. They said there was no beating a Place where you  could play Shirt-Waist Man under the Trees, and have a Fairy Queen in  White come and push Cold Drinks at you and not have to sign any Ticket.  They composed flattering Songs about Clara, and every time she moved  there was a Man right there with a Sofa Cushion to help her to be  Comfortable.    [Illustration: HIGH-SCHOOL CADET]    In the mean time, the Other Girls out at the Summer Resorts were doing  the best they could with these High School Cadets, wearing Tidies around  their Hats, who would rather go out in a Cat-Boat and get their arms  tanned than remain on Shore and win the Honest Love of an American Girl,  with a String to it.    Clara's work about this time was ever so Glossy. She began by asking the  Treasurer of the Shoe Factory to come with her to the Refrigerator to  get out some more Imported Ginger Ale. All the men Volunteered to help,  and two or three wanted to Tag along, but Clara drove them back.    They were gone a Long Time, because the Treasurer had to draw all the  Corks, and they Fussed around together in the Pantry fixing up a Lunch  for the Boys. Clara told him how Strong and Handy he was, until he felt  an increase in his Chest Measurement.    On successive evenings she had the Treasurer supervise all the  Arrangements. The Hired Girl had every Evening off, because it was so  much more Jolly to go out and run the place yourself. In less than a  Week the Treasurer was giving Orders around the House. She would get him  back to the Kitchen and tie an Apron around him and ask what she should  do next. She made him out to be the Only One who could be Trusted. The  others were Company, but he was like one of the Family. And although he  was being Worked like Creamery Butter, he never Suspected.    Her Game was to Domesticate him in Advance, and let him have a Foretaste  of what it is to be Boss of your own House, except as to the Bills. The  Pantry was full of Home Delicacies such as he couldn't get at the Hotel,  and the Service was the best ever. Clara was right at his Elbow with a  Willing Smile.    It didn't take him long to realize that he was missing a lot by  remaining Single. He wondered why he had been so slow in getting on to  Clara's Good Points. Also he wondered if it was any Open-and-Shut  Certainty when a dozen other Men, some of them Younger and more Gallus,  were after her in Full Cry.    Clara had him Pulled In, Strung and Hung over the side of the Boat.    Of course if all the other Girls had been in Town, they would have  Tumbled long before it ran into a Certainty, and probably they would  have formed a V and rushed in to break up the Play. But the other Girls  were Far Away with the Old Men and the Seminary Striplings. Clara had an  Open Field, with no need "]]]
