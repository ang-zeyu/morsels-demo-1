[_With astonishment_.]    How now! swift as is our pursuit, I scarce can see him.    CHARIOTEER.    Sire, the ground here is full of hollows; I have therefore drawn  in the reins and checked the speed of the chariot. Hence the deer  has somewhat gained upon us. Now that we are passing over level  ground, we shall have no difficulty in overtaking him.    KING.    Loosen the reins, then.    CHARIOTEER.    The King is obeyed.                                [_Drives the chariot at full speed_.]    Great Prince, see I see!      Responsive to the slackened rein, the steeds,    Chafing with eager rivalry, career    With emulative fleetness o'er the plain;    Their necks outstretched, their waving plumes, that late    Fluttered above their brows, are motionless[10];    Their sprightly ears, but now erect, bent low;    Themselves unsullied by the circling dust,    That vainly follows on their rapid course.    KING.                                                [_Joyously_.    In good sooth, the horses seem as if they would outstrip the  steeds of Indra and the Sun[11].      That which but now showed to my view minute    Quickly assumes dimension; that which seemed    A moment since disjoined in diverse parts,    Looks suddenly like one compacted whole;    That which is really crooked in its shape    In the far distance left, grows regular;    Wondrous the chariot's speed, that in a breath,    Makes the near distant and the distant near.    Now, Charioteer, see me kill the deer.                                                        [_Takes aim_.    A VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.    Hold, O King! this deer belongs to our hermitage.  Kill it not! kill it not!    CHARIOTEER.                             [_Listening and looking_.    Great King, some hermits have stationed themselves so as to  screen the antelope at the very moment of its coming within range  of your arrow.    KING.                                                 [_Hastily_.    Then stop the horses.    CHARIOTEER.    I obey.                                                [_Stops the chariot_.    _Enter a_ HERMIT, _and two others with him_.]    HERMIT.                                      [_Raising his hand_.    This deer, O King, belongs to our hermitage. Kill  it not! kill it not!      Now heaven forbid this barbed shaft descend    Upon the fragile body of a fawn,    Like fire upon a heap of tender flowers!    Can thy steel bolts no meeter quarry find    Than the warm life-blood of a harmless deer?    Restore, great Prince, thy weapon to its quiver.    More it becomes thy arms to shield the weak,    Than to bring anguish on the innocent.    KING.    'Tis done.                                 [_Replaces the arrow in its quiver_.    HERMIT.    Worthy is this action of a Prince, the light of Puru's race[12].      Well does this act befit a Prince like thee,    Right worthy is it of thine ancestry.    Thy guerdon be a son of peerless worth,    Whose wide dominion shall embrace the earth.    BOTH THE OTHER HERMITS.                   [_Raising their hands_.    May heaven indeed grant thee a son, a sovereign of the earth from  sea to sea!    KING.                                                           [_Bowing_.    I accept with gratitude a Brahman's benediction.    HERMIT.    We came hither, mighty Prince, to collect sacrificial wood. Here  on the banks of the Malini you may perceive the hermitage of the  great sage Kanwa[13]. If other duties require not your presence,  deign to enter and accept our hospitality.      When you behold our penitential rites    Performed without impediment by saints    Rich only in devotion, then with pride    Will you reflect:--Such are the holy men    Who call me Guardian; such the men for whom    To wield the bow I bare my nervous arm,    Scarred by the motion of the glancing string.    KING.    Is the Chief of your Society now at home?    HERMIT.    No; he has gone to Soma-tirtha[14] to propitiate Destiny, which  threatens his daughter [S']akoontala with some calamity; but he has  commissioned her in his absence to entertain all guests with  hospitality.    KING.    Good! I will pay her a visit. She will make me acquainted with  the mighty sage's acts of penance and devotion.    HERMIT.    And we will depart on our errand.                                         [_Exit with his companions_.    KING.    Charioteer, urge on the horses. We will at least purify our souls  by a sight of this hallowed retreat.    CHARIOTEER.    Your Majesty is obeyed.                           [_Drives the chariot with great velocity_.    KING.                                   [_Looking all about him_.    Charioteer, even without being told, I should have known that  these were the precincts of a grove consecrated to penitential  rites.    CHARIOTEER.    How so?    KING.    Do not you observe?      Beneath the trees, whose hollow trunks afford    Secure retreat to many a nestling brood    Of parrots, scattered grains of rice lie strewn.    Lo! here and there are seen the polished slabs    That serve to bruise the fruit of Ingudi[15].    The gentle roe-deer, taught to trust in man,    Unstartled hear our voices. On the paths    Appear the traces of bark-woven vests[16]    Borne dripping from the limpid fount of waters.    And mark!      Laved are the roots of trees by deep canals [17],    Whose glassy waters tremble in the breeze;    The sprouting verdure of the leaves is dimmed    By dusky wreaths of upward curling smoke    From burnt oblations; and on new-mown lawns    Around our car graze leisurely the fawns.    CHARIOTEER.    I observe it all.    KING.                              [_Advancing a little further_.    The inhabitants of this sacred retreat must not be disturbed.  Stay the chariot, that I may alight.    CHARIOTEER.    The reins are held in. Your Majesty may descend.    KING.                                               [_Alighting_.    Charioteer, groves devoted to penance must be entered in humble  attire. Take these ornaments.                    [_Delivers his ornaments and bow to CHARIOTEER_.]    Charioteer, see that the horses are watered, and attend to them  until I return from visiting the inhabitants of the hermitage.    CHARIOTEER.    I Will.                                                             [_Exit_.    KING.                               [_Walking and looking about_.    Here is the entrance to the hermitage. I will now go in.    [_Entering and feeling a throbbing sensation in his arm_.      Serenest peace is in this calm retreat,    By passion's breath unruffled; what portends    My throbbing arm[18]? Why should it whisper here    Of happy love? Yet everywhere around us    Stand the closed portals of events unknown.    A VOICE BEHIND THE SCENES.    This way, my dear companions; this way.    KING.                                               [_Listening_.    Hark! I hear voices to the right of yonder grove  of trees. I will walk in that direction.                                      [_Walking and looking about_.]    Ah! here are the maidens of the hermitage coming this way to  water the shrubs, carrying water-pots proportioned to their  strength.                                                  [_Gazing at them_.]    How graceful they look!      In palaces such charms are rarely ours;    The woodland plants outshine the garden flowers.    I will conceal myself in this shade and watch them.                                            [_Stands gazing at them_.    _Enter [S']AKOONTALA, with her two female companions, employed in  the manner described_.    [S']AKOONTALA    This way, my dear companions; this way.    ANASUYA.    Dear [S']akoontala, one would think that father Kanwa had more  affection for the shrubs of the hermitage even than for you,  seeing he assigns to you, who are yourself as delicate as the  fresh-blown jasmine, the task of filling with water the trenches  which encircle their roots.    [S']AKOONTALA.    Dear Anasuya, although I am charged by my good father with this  duty, yet I cannot regard it as a task. I really feel a sisterly  love for these plants.                                    [_Continues watering the shrubs_.    KING.    Can this be the daughter of Kanwa? The saintly man, though  descended from the great Kasyapa, must be very deficient in  judgment to habituate such a maiden to the life of a recluse.      The sage who would this form of artless grace    Inure to penance, thoughtlessly attempts    To cleave in twain the hard acacia's stem[19]    With the soft edge of a blue lotus-leaf.    Well! concealed behind this tree, I will watch her without  raising her suspicions.                                                 [_Conceals himself_.      [S']AKOONTALA.    Good Anasuya, Priyamvada has drawn this bark-dress too tightly  about my chest. I pray thee, loosen it a little.    ANASUYA.    I will.                                            [_Loosens it_.    PRIYAMVADA.                                           [_Smiling_.    Why do you lay the blame on me? Blame rather your own blooming  youthfulness which imparts fulness to your bosom.    KING.    A most just observation!      This youthful form, whose bosom's swelling charms    By the bark's knotted tissue are concealed,    Like some fair bud close folded in its sheath,    Gives not to view the blooming of its beauty.    But what am I saying? In real truth this bark-dress,  though ill-suited to her figure, sets it off like an ornament.      The lotus[20] with the [S']aivala[21] entwined    Is not a whit less brilliant; dusky spots   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12187"],[0,"The Mystery of 31 New Inn (#6)"],[1,"ity. But I had better give you an account of the affair in a  complete narrative, as I know that you like to have your data in a  regular and consecutive order.\"    Thereupon I proceeded to relate the history of my visit to the  mysterious Mr. Graves, not omitting any single circumstance or detail  that I could recollect.    Thorndyke listened from the very beginning of my story with the closest  attention. His face was the most impassive that I have ever seen;  ordinarily as inscrutable as a bronze mask; but to me, who knew him  intimately, there was a certain something--a change of colour, perhaps,  or an additional sparkle of the eye--that told me when his curious  passion for investigation was fully aroused. And now, as I told him of  that weird journey and the strange, secret house to which it had brought  me, I could see that it offered a problem after his very heart. During  the whole of my narration he sat as motionless as a statue, evidently  committing the whole story to memory, detail by detail; and even when I  had finished he remained for an appreciable time without moving or  speaking.    At length he looked up at me. \"This is a very extraordinary affair,  Jervis,\" he said.    \"Very,\" I agreed; \"and the question that is agitating me is, what is to  be done?\"    \"Yes,\" he said, meditatively, \"that is the question; and an uncommonly  difficult question it is. It really involves the settlement of the  antecedent question: What is it that is happening at that house?\"    \"What do you think is happening at that house?\" I asked.    \"We must go slow, Jervis,\" he replied. \"We must carefully separate the  legal tissues from the medical, and avoid confusing what we know with  what we suspect. Now, with reference to the medical aspects of the case.  The first question that confronts us is that of sleeping sickness, or  negro-lethargy as it is sometimes called; and here we are in a  difficulty. We have not enough knowledge. Neither of us, I take it, has  ever seen a case, and the extant descriptions are inadequate. From what  I know of the disease, its symptoms agree with those in your case in  respect of the alleged moroseness and in the gradually increasing  periods of lethargy alternating with periods of apparent recovery. On  the other hand, the disease is said to be confined to negroes; but that  probably means only that negroes alone have hitherto been exposed to the  conditions that produce it. A more important fact is that, as far as I  know, extreme contraction of the pupils is not a symptom of sleeping  sickness. To sum up, the probabilities are against sleeping sickness,  but with our insufficient knowledge, we cannot definitely exclude it.\"    \"You think that it may really be sleeping sickness?\"    \"No; personally I do not entertain that theory for a moment. But I am  considering the evidence apart from our opinions on the subject. We have  to accept it as a conceivable hypothesis that it may be sleeping  sickness because we cannot positively prove that it is not. That is all.  But when we come to the hypothesis of morphine poisoning, the case is  different. The symptoms agree with those of morphine poisoning in every  respect. There is no exception or disagreement whatever. The common  sense of the matter is therefore that we adopt morphine poisoning as our  working diagnosis; which is what you seem to have done.\"    \"Yes. For purposes of treatment.\"    \"Exactly. For medical purposes you adopted the more probable view and  dismissed the less probable. That was the reasonable thing to do. But  for legal purposes you must entertain both possibilities; for the  hypothesis of poisoning involves serious legal issues, whereas the  hypothesis of disease involves no legal issues at all.\"    \"That doesn't sound very helpful,\" I remarked.    \"It indicates the necessity for caution,\" he retorted.    \"Yes, I see that. But what is your own opinion of the case?\"    \"Well,\" he said, \"let us consider the facts in order. Here is a man who,  we assume, is under the influence of a poisonous dose of morphine. The  question is, did he take that dose himself or was it administered to him  by some other person? If he took it himself, with what object did he  take it? The history that was given to you seems completely to exclude  the idea of suicide. But the patient's condition seems equally to  exclude the idea of morphinomania. Your opium-eater does not reduce  himself to a state of coma. He usually keeps well within the limits of  the tolerance that has been established. The conclusion that emerges is,  I think, that the drug was administered by some other person; and the  most likely person seems to be Mr. Weiss.\"    \"Isn't morphine a very unusual poison?\"    \"Very; and most inconvenient except in a single, fatal dose, by reason  of the rapidity with which tolerance of the drug is established. But we  must not forget that slow morphine poisoning might be eminently  suitable in certain cases. The manner in which it enfeebles the will,  confuses the judgment and debilitates the body might make it very useful  to a poisoner whose aim was to get some instrument or document executed,  such as a will, deed or assignment. And death could be produced  afterwards by other means. You see the important bearing of this?\"    \"You mean in respect of a death certificate?\"    \"Yes. Suppose Mr. Weiss to have given a large dose of morphine. He then  sends for you and throws out a suggestion of sleeping sickness. If you  accept the suggestion he is pretty safe. He can repeat the process until  he kills his victim and then get a certificate from you which will cover  the murder. It was quite an ingenious scheme--which, by the way, is  characteristic of intricate crimes; your subtle criminal often plans his  crime like a genius, but he generally executes it like a fool--as this  man seems to have done, if we are not doing him an injustice.\"    \"How has he acted like a fool?\"    \"In several respects. In the first place, he should have chosen his  doctor. A good, brisk, confident man who 'knows his own mind' is the  sort of person who would have suited him; a man who would have jumped at  a diagnosis and stuck to it; or else an ignorant weakling of alcoholic  tendencies. It was shockingly bad luck to run against a cautious  scientific practitioner like my learned friend. Then, of course, all  this secrecy was sheer tomfoolery, exactly calculated to put a careful  man on his guard; as it has actually done. If Mr. Weiss is really a  criminal, he has mismanaged his affairs badly.\"    \"And you apparently think that he is a criminal?\"    \"I suspect him deeply. But I should like to ask you one or two questions  about him. You say he spoke with a German accent. What command of  English had he? Was his vocabulary good? Did he use any German idioms?\"    \"No. I should say that his English was perfect, and I noticed that his  phrases were quite well chosen even for an Englishman.\"    \"Did he seem to you 'made up' in any way; disguised, I mean?\"    \"I couldn't say. The light was so very feeble.\"    \"You couldn't see the colour of his eyes, for instance?\"    \"No. I think they were grey, but I couldn't be sure.\"    \"And as to the coachman. He wore a wig, you said. Could you see the  colour of his eyes? Or any peculiarity by which you could recognize  him?\"    \"He had a malformed thumb-nail on his right hand. That is all I can say  about him.\"    \"He didn't strike you as resembling Weiss in any way; in voice or  features?\"    \"Not at all; and he spoke, as I told you, with a distinct Scotch  accent.\"    \"The reason I ask is that if Weiss is attempting to poison this man, the  coachman is almost certain to be a confederate and might be a relative.  You had better examine him closely if you get another chance.\"    \"I will. And that brings me back to the question, What am I to do? Ought  I to report the case to the police?\"    \"I am inclined to think not. You have hardly enough facts. Of course, if  Mr. Weiss has administered poison 'unlawfully and maliciously' he has  committed a felony, and is liable under the Consolidation Acts of 1861  to ten years' penal servitude. But I do not see how you could swear an  information. You don't know that he administered the poison--if poison  has really been administered--and you cannot give any reliable name or  any address whatever. Then there is the question of sleeping sickness.  You reject it for medical purposes, but you could not swear, in a court  of law, that this is not a case of sleeping sickness.\"    \"No,\" I admitted, \"I could not.\"    \"Then I think the police would decline to move in the matter, and you  might find that you had raised a scandal in Dr. Stillbury's practice to  no purpose.\"    \"So you think I had better do nothing in the matter?\"    \"For the present. It is, of course, a medical man's duty to assist  justice in any way that is possible. But a doctor is not a detective; he  should not go out of his way to assume police functions. He should keep  his eyes and ears open, and, though, in general, he should keep his own  counsel, it is his duty to note very carefully anything that seems to  him likely to bear on any important legal issues. It is not his  business officiously to initiate criminal inquiries, but it is  emphatically his business to be ready, if called upon, to assist justice  with information that his special knowledge and opportunities have  rendered accessible to him. You see the bearing of this?\"    \"You mean that I should note down what I have seen and heard and say  nothing about it until I am asked.\"    \"Yes; if nothing further happens. But if you should be sent for again, I  think it is your duty to make further observations with a view, if  necessary, to informing the police. It may be, for instance, of vital  importance to identify the house, and it is your duty to secure the  means of doing so.\"    \"But, my dear Thorndyke,\" I expostulated, \"I have told you how I was"]]]
