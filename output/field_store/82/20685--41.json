Coasting craft would be  built and fitted out, also at the mouth of the Columbia, to trade, at  favorable seasons, all along the northwest coast, and return, with the  proceeds of their voyages, to this place of deposit. Thus all the Indian  trade, both of the interior and the coast, would converge to this point,  and thence derive its sustenance.    A ship was to be sent annually from New York to this main establishment  with reinforcements and supplies, and with merchandise suited to the  trade. It would take on board the furs collected during the preceding  year, carry them to Canton, invest the proceeds in the rich merchandise  of China, and return thus freighted to New York. As, in extending the  American trade along the coast to the northward, it might be brought  into the vicinity of the Russian Fur Company, and produce a hostile  rivalry, it was part of the plan of Mr. Astor to conciliate the  good-will of that company by the most amicable and beneficial  arrangements. The Russian establishment was chiefly dependent for its  supplies upon transient trading vessels from the United States. These  vessels, however, were often of more harm than advantage. Being owned  by private adventurers, or casual voyagers, who cared only for present  profit, and had no interest in the permanent prosperity of the trade,  they were reckless in their dealings with the natives, and made no  scruple of supplying them with fire-arms. In this way several fierce  tribes in the vicinity of the Russian posts, or within the range of  their trading excursions, were furnished with deadly means of warfare,  and rendered troublesome and dangerous neighbors.    The Russian government had made representations to that of the United  States of these malpractices on the part of its citizens, and urged to  have this traffic in arms prohibited; but, as it did not infringe  any municipal law, our government could not interfere. Yet, still it  regarded, with solicitude, a traffic which, if persisted in, might give  offence to Russia, at that time almost the only friendly power to us. In  this dilemma the government had applied to Mr. Astor, as one conversant  in this branch of trade, for information that might point out a way  to remedy the evil. This circumstance had suggested to him the idea of  supplying the Russian establishment regularly by means of the annual  ship that should visit the settlement at the mouth of the Columbia (or  Oregon); by this means the casual trading vessels would be excluded  from those parts of the coast where their malpractices were so injurious  to the Russians.    Such is a brief outline of the enterprise projected by Mr. Astor, but  which continually expanded in his mind. Indeed it is due to him to say  that he was not actuated by mere motives of individual profit. He was  already wealthy beyond the ordinary desires of man, but he now aspired  to that honorable fame which is awarded to men of similar scope of mind,  who by their great commercial enterprises have enriched nations, peopled  wildernesses, and extended the bounds of empire. He considered his  projected establishment at the mouth of the Columbia as the emporium  to an immense commerce; as a colony that would form the germ of a wide  civilization; that would, in fact, carry the American population across  the Rocky Mountains and spread it along the shores of the Pacific, as  it already animated the shores of the Atlantic. As Mr. Astor, by the  magnitude of his commercial and financial relations, and the vigor  and scope of his self-taught mind, had elevated himself into the  consideration of government and the communion and correspondence with  leading statesmen, he, at an early period, communicated his schemes  to President Jefferson, soliciting the countenance of government. How  highly they were esteemed by that eminent man, we may judge by the  following passage, written by him some time afterwards.    \"I remember well having invited your proposition on this subject,*** and  encouraged it with the assurance of every facility and protection which  the government could properly afford. I considered, as a great public  acquisition, the commencement of a settlement on that point of the  western coast of America, and looked forward with gratification to the  time when its descendants should have spread themselves through the  whole length of that coast, covering it with free and independent  Americans, unconnected with us but by the ties of blood and interest,  and enjoying like us the rights of self-government.\"    The cabinet joined with Mr. Jefferson in warm approbation of the plan,  and held out assurance of every protection that could, consistently with  general policy, be afforded. Mr. Astor now prepared to carry his scheme  into prompt execution. He had some competition, however, to apprehend  and guard against. The Northwest Company, acting feebly and partially  upon the suggestions of its former agent, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had  pushed one or two advanced trading posts across the Rocky Mountains,  into a tract of country visited by that enterprising traveller, and  since named New Caledonia. This tract lay about two degrees north of the  Columbia, and intervened between the territories of the United States  and those of Russia. Its length was about five hundred and fifty miles,  and its breadth, from the mountains to the Pacific, from three hundred  to three hundred and fifty geographic miles.    Should the Northwest Company persist in extending their trade in that  quarter, their competition might be of serious detriment to the plans  of Mr. Astor. It is true they would contend with him to a vast  disadvantage, from the checks and restrictions to which they were  subjected. They were straitened on one side by the rivalry of the  Hudson's Bay Company; then they had no good post on the Pacific where  they could receive supplies by sea for their establishments beyond the  mountains; nor, if they had one, could they ship their furs thence to  China, that great mart for peltries; the Chinese trade being comprised  in the monopoly of the East India Company. Their posts beyond the  mountains had to be supplied in yearly expeditions, like caravans,  from Montreal, and the furs conveyed back in the same way, by long,  precarious, and expensive routes, across the continent. Mr. Astor, on  the contrary, would be able to supply his proposed establishment at  the mouth of the Columbia by sea, and to ship the furs collected there  directly to China, so as to undersell the Northwest Company in the great  Chinese market.    Still, the competition of two rival companies west of the Rocky  Mountains could not but prove detrimental to both, and fraught with  those evils, both to the trade and to the Indians, that had attended  similar rivalries in the Canadas. To prevent any contest of the kind,  therefore, he made known his plan to the agents of the Northwest  Company, and proposed to interest them, to the extent of one third, in  the trade thus to be opened. Some correspondence and negotiation ensued.  The company were aware of the advantages which would be possessed by  Mr. Astor should he be able to carry his scheme into effect; but they  anticipated a monopoly of the trade beyond the mountains by their  establishments in New Caledonia, and were loth to share it with an  individual who had already proved a formidable competitor in the  Atlantic trade. They hoped, too, by a timely move, to secure the mouth  of the Columbia before Mr. Astor would be able to put his plans into  operation; and, that key to the internal trade once in their possession,  the whole country would be at their command. After some negotiation and  delay, therefore, they declined the proposition that had been made to  them, but subsequently despatched a party for the mouth of the Columbia,  to establish a post there before any expedition sent out by Mr. Astor  might arrive.    In the meantime Mr. Astor, finding his overtures rejected, proceeded  fearlessly to execute his enterprise in face of the whole power of the  Northwest Company. His main establishment once planted at the mouth of  the Columbia, he looked with confidence to ultimate success. Being able  to reinforce and supply it amply by sea, he would push his interior  posts in every direction up the rivers and along the coast; supplying  the natives at a lower rate, and thus gradually obliging the Northwest  Company to give up the competition, relinquish New Caledonia, and retire  to the other side of the mountains. He would then have possession of  the trade, not merely of the Columbia and its tributaries, but of the  regions farther north, quite to the Russian possessions. Such was a part  of his brilliant and comprehensive plan.    He now proceeded, with all diligence, to procure proper agents and  coadjutors, habituated to the Indian trade and to the life of the  wilderness. Among the clerks of the Northwest Company were several of  great capacity and experience, who had served out their probationary  terms, but who, either through lack of interest and influence, or a  want of vacancies, had not been promoted. They were consequently much  dissatisfied, and ready for any employment in which their talents and  acquirements might be turned to better account.    Mr. Astor made his overtures to several of these persons, and three  of them entered into his views. One of these, Mr. Alexander M'Kay, had  accompanied Sir Alexander Mackenzie in both of his expeditions to the  northwest coast of America in 1789 and 1793. The other two were Duncan  M'Dougal and Donald M'Kenzie. To these were subsequently added Mr.  Wilson Price Hunt, of New Jersey. As this gentleman was a native born  citizen of the United States, a person of great probity and worth, he  was selected by Mr. Astor to be his chief agent, and to represent him in  the contemplated establishment.

She must look for her happiness to HOME. We would have  young women ponder over this, and watch carefully, ere the veil is  lifted, and the hard cruel eye of public criticism fixed upon them.  No profession is pastime; still less so now than ever, when so many  people are \"clever\", though so few are great. We would pray those  especially who direct their thoughts to literature, to think of what  they have to say, and why they wish to say it; and above all, to weigh  what they may expect from a capricious public, against the blessed  shelter and pure harmonies of private life.    But we have had some--and still have some--\"celebrated\" women, of whom  we have said \"we may be justly proud\". We have done pilgrimage to the  shrine of Lady Rachel Russell, who was so thoroughly \"domestic\", that  the Corinthian beauty of her character would never have been matter  of history, but for the wickedness of a bad king. We have recorded  the hours spent with Hannah More; the happy days passed with, and the  years invigorated by, the advice and influence of Maria Edgworth. We  might recall the stern and faithful puritanism of Maria Jane Jewsbury,  and the Old World devotion of the true and high-souled daughter of  Israel--Grace Aguilar. The mellow tones of Felicia Hemans' poetry  lingers still among all who appreciate the holy sympathies of religion  and virtue. We could dwell long and profitably on the enduring  patience and lifelong labor of Barbara Hofland, and steep a diamond in  tears to record the memories of L.E.L. We could,--alas! alas! barely  five and twenty years' acquaintance with literature and its ornaments,  and the brilliant catalogue is but a _Memento Mori_. Perhaps of all  this list, Maria Edgworth's life was the happiest: simply because she  was the most retired, the least exposed to the gaze and observation of  the world, the most occupied by loving duties toward the most united  circle of old and young we ever saw assembled in one happy home.    The very young have never, perhaps, read one of the tales of a lady  whose reputation as a novelist was in its zenith when Walter Scott  published his first novel. We desire to place a chaplet upon the grave  of a woman once \"celebrated\" all over the known world, yet who drew  all her happiness from the lovingness of home and friends, while her  life was as pure as her renown was extensive.    In our own childhood romance-reading was prohibited, but earnest  entreaty procured an exception in favor of the \"Scottish Chiefs\". It  was the bright summer, and we read it by moonlight, only disturbed  by the murmur of the distant ocean. We read it, crouched in the deep  recess of the nursery-window; we read it until moonlight and morning  met, and the breakfast-bell ringing out into the soft air from the  old gable, found us at the end of the fourth volume. Dear old times!  when it would have been deemed little less than sacrilege to crush a  respectable romance into a shilling volume, and our mammas considered  _only_ a five-volume story curtailed of its just proportions.    Sir William Wallace has never lost his heroic ascendancy over us,  and we have steadily resisted every temptation to open the \"popular  edition\" of the long-loved romance, lest what people will call \"the  improved state of the human mind\", might displace the sweet memory of  the mingled admiration and indignation that chased each other, while  we read and wept, without ever questioning the truth of the absorbing  narrative.    Yet the \"Scottish Chiefs\" scarcely achieved the popularity of  \"Thaddeus of Warsaw\"--the first romance originated by the active  brain and singularly constructive power of Jane Porter--produced at an  almost girlish age.    The hero of \"Thaddeus of Warsaw\" was really Kosciuszko, the beloved  pupil of George Washington, the grandest and purest patriot the modern  world has known. The enthusiastic girl was moved to its composition by  the stirring times in which she lived, and a personal observation  of and acquaintance with some of those brave men whose struggles for  liberty only ceased with their exile or their existence.    Miss Porter placed her standard of excellence on high ground, and--all  gentle-spirited as was her nature--it was firm and unflinching toward  what she believed the right and true. We must not therefore judge  her by the depressed state of \"feeling\" in these times, when its  demonstration is looked upon as artificial or affected. Toward the  termination of the last, and the commencement of the present century,  the world was roused into an interest and enthusiasm, which now we  can scarcely appreciate or account for; the sympathies of England were  awakened by the terrible revolutions of France and the desolation of  Poland; as a principle, we hated Napoleon, though he had neither act  nor part in the doings of the democrats; and the sea-songs of Dibdin,  which our youth _now_ would call uncouth and ungraceful rhymes, were  key-notes to public feeling; the English of that time were thoroughly  \"awake\"--the British Lion had not slumbered through a thirty years'  peace. We were a nation of soldiers, and sailors, and patriots;  not of mingled cotton-spinners, and railway speculators, and angry  protectionists. We do not say which state of things is best or worst,  we desire merely to account for what may be called the taste for  _heroic_ literature at that time, and the taste for--we really hardly  know what to call it--literature of the present, made up, as it  too generally is, of shreds and patches--bits of gold and bits of  tinsel--things written in a hurry, to be read in a hurry, and never  thought of afterward--suggestive rather than reflective, at the best:  and we must plead guilty to a too great proneness to underrate what  our fathers probably overrated.    At all events we must bear in mind, while reading or thinking over  Miss Porter's novels, that in her day, even the exaggeration  of enthusiasm was considered good tone and good taste. How this  enthusiasm was _fostered_, not subdued, can be gathered by the  author's ingenious preface to the, we believe, tenth edition of  \"Thaddeus of Warsaw.\"    [Illustration]    This story brought her abundant honors, and rendered her society,  as well as the society of her sister and brother, sought for by all  who aimed at a reputation for taste and talent. Mrs. Porter, on her  husband's death, (he was the younger son of a well-connected Irish  family, born in Ireland, in or near Coleraine, we believe, and a major  in the Enniskillen Dragoons,) sought a residence for her family in  Edinburgh, where education and good society are attainable to persons  of moderate fortunes, if they are \"well-born;\" but the extraordinary  artistic skill of her son Robert required a wider field, and she  brought her children to London sooner than she had intended, that his  promising talents might be cultivated. We believe the greater part  of \"Thaddeus of Warsaw\" was written in London, either in St. Martin's  Lane, Newport Street, or Gerard Street, Soho, (for in these three  streets the family lived after their arrival in the metropolis);  though, as soon as Robert Ker Porter's abilities floated him on the  stream, his mother and sisters retired, in the brightness of their  fame and beauty, to the village of Thames Ditton, a residence they  loved to speak of as their \"home.\" The actual labor of \"Thaddeus\"--her  first novel--must have been considerable: for testimony was frequently  borne to the fidelity of its localities, and Poles refused to believe  the author had not visited Poland; indeed, she had a happy power in  describing localities. It was on the publication of Miss Porter's two  first works in the German language that their author was honored by  being made a Lady of the Chapter of St. Joachim, and received the  gold cross of the order from Wurtemberg; but \"The Scottish Chiefs\" was  never so popular on the Continent as \"Thaddeus of Warsaw\", although  Napoleon honored it with an interdict, to prevent its circulation in  France. If Jane Porter owed her Polish inspirations so peculiarly  to the tone of the times in which she lived, she traces back, in  her introduction to the latest edition of \"The Scottish Chiefs.\" her  enthusiasm in the cause of Sir William Wallace to the influence an  old \"Scotch wife's\" tales and ballads produced upon her mind while in  early childhood. She wandered amid what she describes as \"beautiful  green banks,\" which rose in natural terraces behind her mothers house,  and where a cow and a few sheep occasionally fed. This house stood  alone, at the head of a little square, near the high school; the  distinguished Lord Elchies formerly lived in the house, which was very  ancient, and from those green banks it commanded a fine view of the  Firth of Forth. While gathering \"_gowans_\" or other wild-flowers for  her infant sister, (whom she loved more dearly than her life, during  the years they lived in most tender and affectionate companionship),  she frequently encountered this aged woman, with her knitting in her  hand; and she would speak to the eager and intelligent child of the  blessed quiet of the land, where the cattle were browsing without fear  of an enemy; and then she would talk of the awful times of the brave  Sir William Wallace, when he fought for Scotland, \"against a cruel  tyrant; like unto them whom Abraham overcame when he recovered Lot,  with all his herds and flocks, from the proud foray of the robber  kings of the South,\" who, she never failed to add, \"were all rightly  punished for oppressing the stranger in a foreign land! for the Lord  careth for the stranger.\" Miss Porter says that this woman never  omitted mingling pious allusions with her narrative. \"Yet she was a "]]]
