But a sounder and   wiser school of geologists now reigns; the father of whom, in England   at least, is the venerable Sir Charles Lyell.  He was almost the   first of Englishmen who taught us to see--what common sense tells us-  -that the laws which we see at work around us now have been most   probably at work since the creation of the world; and that whatever   changes may seem to have taken place in past ages, and in ancient   rocks, should be explained, if possible, by the changes which are   taking place now in the most recent deposits--in the soil of the   field.    And in the last forty years--since that great and sound idea has   become rooted in the minds of students, and especially of English   students, geology has thriven and developed, perhaps more than any   other science; and has led men on to discoveries far more really   astonishing and awful than all fancied convulsions and cataclysms.    I have planned this series of papers, therefore, on Sir Charles   Lyell's method.  I have begun by trying to teach a little about the   part of the earth's crust which lies nearest us, which we see most   often; namely, the soil; intending, if my readers do me the honour to   read the papers which follow, to lead them downward, as it were, into   the earth; deeper and deeper in each paper, to rocks and minerals   which are probably less known to them than the soil in the fields.    Thus you will find I shall lead you, or try to lead you on,   throughout the series, from the known to the unknown, and show you   how to explain the latter by the former.  Sir Charles Lyell has, I   see, in the new edition of his \"Student's Elements of Geology,\" begun   his book with the uppermost, that is, newest, strata, or layers; and   has gone regularly downwards in the course of the book to the lowest   or earliest strata; and I shall follow his plan.    I must ask you meanwhile to remember one law or rule, which seems to   me founded on common sense; namely, that the uppermost strata are   really almost always the newest; that when two or more layers,   whether of rock or earth--or indeed two stones in the street, or two   sheets on a bed, or two books on a table--any two or more lifeless   things, in fact, lie one on the other, then the lower one was most   probably put there first, and the upper one laid down on the lower.    Does that seem to you a truism?  Do I seem almost impertinent in   asking you to remember it?  So much the better.  I shall be saved   unnecessary trouble hereafter.    But some one may say, and will have a right to say, \"Stop--the lower   thing may have been thrust under the upper one.\"  Quite true:  and   therefore I said only that the lower one was most probably put there   first.  And I said \"most probably,\" because it is most probable that   in nature we should find things done by the method which costs least   force, just as you do them.  I will warrant that when you want to   hide a thing, you lay something down on it ten times for once that   you thrust it under something else.  You may say, \"What?  When I want   to hide a paper, say, under the sofa-cover, do I not thrust it   under?\"    No, you lift up the cover, and slip the paper in, and let the cover   fall on it again.  And so, even in that case, the paper has got into   its place first.    Now why is this?  Simply because in laying one thing on another you   only move weight.  In thrusting one thing under another, you have not   only to move weight, but to overcome friction.  That is why you do   it, though you are hardly aware of it:  simply because so you employ   less force, and take less trouble.    And so do clays and sands and stones.  They are laid down on each   other, and not thrust under each other, because thus less force is   expended in getting them into place.    There are exceptions.  There are cases in which nature does try to   thrust one rock under another.  But to do that she requires a force   so enormous, compared with what is employed in laying one rock on   another, that (so to speak) she continually fails; and instead of   producing a volcanic eruption, produces only an earthquake.  Of that   I may speak hereafter, and may tell you, in good time, how to   distinguish rocks which have been thrust in from beneath, from rocks   which have been laid down from above, as every rock between London   and Birmingham or Exeter has been laid down.  That I only assert now.    But I do not wish you to take it on trust from me.  I wish to prove   it to you as I go on, or to do what is far better for you:  to put   you in the way of proving it for yourself, by using your common   sense.    At the risk of seeming prolix, I must say a few more words on this   matter.  I have special reasons for it.  Until I can get you to \"let   your thoughts play freely\" round this question of the superposition   of soils and rocks, there will be no use in my going on with these   papers.    Suppose then (to argue from the known to the unknown) that you were   watching men cleaning out a pond.  Atop, perhaps, they would come to   a layer of soft mud, and under that to a layer of sand.  Would not   common sense tell you that the sand was there first, and that the   water had laid down the mud on the top of it?  Then, perhaps, they   might come to a layer of dead leaves.  Would not common sense tell   you that the leaves were there before the sand above them?  Then,   perhaps, to a layer of mud again.  Would not common sense tell you   that the mud was there before the leaves?  And so on down to the   bottom of the pond, where, lastly, I think common sense would tell   you that the bottom of the pond was there already, before all the   layers which were laid down on it.  Is not that simple common sense?    Then apply that reasoning to the soils and rocks in any spot on   earth.  If you made a deep boring, and found, as you would in many   parts of this kingdom, that the boring, after passing through the   soil of the field, entered clays or loose sands, you would say the   clays were there before the soil.  If it then went down into   sandstone, you would say--would you not?--that sandstone must have   been here before the clay; and however thick--even thousands of feet-  -it might be, that would make no difference to your judgment.  If   next the boring came into quite different rocks; into a different   sort of sandstone and shales, and among them beds of coal, would you   not say--These coal-beds must have been here before the sandstones?    And if you found in those coal-beds dead leaves and stems of plants,   would you not say--Those plants must have been laid down here before   the layers above them, just as the dead leaves in the pond were?    If you then came to a layer of limestone, would you not say the same?    And if you found that limestone full of shells and corals, dead, but   many of them quite perfect, some of the corals plainly in the very   place in which they grew, would you not say--These creatures must   have lived down here before the coal was laid on top of them?  And   if, lastly, below the limestone you came to a bottom rock quite   different again, would you not say--The bottom rock must have been   here before the rocks on the top of it?    And if that bottom rock rose up a few miles off, two thousand feet,   or any other height, into hills, what would you say then?  Would you   say:  \"Oh, but the rock is not bottom rock; is not under the   limestone here, but higher than it.  So perhaps in this part it has   made a shift, and the highlands are younger than the lowlands; for   see, they rise so much higher?\"  Would not that be as wise as to say   that the bottom of the pond was not there before the pond mud,   because the banks round the pond rose higher than the mud?    Now for the soil of the field.    If we can understand a little about it, what it is made of, and how   it got there, we shall perhaps be on the right road toward   understanding what all England--and, indeed, the crust of this whole   planet--is made of; and how its rocks and soils got there.    But we shall best understand how the soil in the field was made, by   reasoning, as I have said, from the known to the unknown.  What do I   mean?  This:  On the uplands are fields in which the soil is already   made.  You do not know how?  Then look for a field in which the soil   is still being made.  There are plenty in every lowland.  Learn how   it is being made there; apply the knowledge which you learn from them   to the upland fields which are already made.    If there is, as there usually is, a river-meadow, or still better, an   aestuary, near your town, you have every advantage for seeing soil   made.  Thousands of square feet of fresh-made soil spread between   your town and the sea; thousands more are in process of being made.    You will see now why I have begun with the soil in the field; because   it is the uppermost, and therefore latest, of all the layers; and   also for this reason, that, if Sir Charles Lyell's theory be true--as   it is--then the soils and rocks below the soil of the field may have   been made in the very same way in which the soil of the field is   made.  If so, it is well worth our while to examine it.    You all know from whence the soil comes which has filled up, in the   course of ages, the great aestuaries below London, Stirling, Chester,   or Cambridge.    It is river mud and sand.  The river, helped by tributary brooks   right and left, has brought down from the inland that enormous mass.    You know that.  You know that every flood and freshet brings a fresh   load, either of fine mud or of fine sand, or possibly some of it   peaty matter out of distant hills.  Here is one indisputable fact   from which to start.  Let us look for another.    How does the mud get into the river?

You ain't likely to miss strikin' his place  sometime or other. He's got a regular town, I might say. Shore there's  some gamblin' an' gun-fightin' goin' on at Bland's camp all the time.  Bland has killed some twenty men, an' thet's not countin' greasers.\"    Here Stevens took another drink and then rested for a while.    \"You ain't likely to get on with Bland,\" he resumed, presently. \"You're  too strappin' big an' good-lookin' to please the chief. Fer he's got  women in his camp. Then he'd be jealous of your possibilities with a  gun. Shore I reckon he'd be careful, though. Bland's no fool, an' he  loves his hide. I reckon any of the other gangs would be better fer you  when you ain't goin' it alone.\"    Apparently that exhausted the fund of information and advice Stevens had  been eager to impart. He lapsed into silence and lay with closed eyes.  Meanwhile the sun rose warm; the breeze waved the mesquites; the birds  came down to splash in the shallow stream; Duane dozed in a comfortable  seat. By and by something roused him. Stevens was once more talking, but  with a changed tone.    \"Feller's name--was Brown,\" he rambled. \"We fell out--over a hoss I  stole from him--in Huntsville. He stole it fuss. Brown's one of them  sneaks--afraid of the open--he steals an' pretends to be honest. Say,  Buck, mebbe you'll meet Brown some day--You an' me are pards now.\"    \"I'll remember, if I ever meet him,\" said Duane.    That seemed to satisfy the outlaw. Presently he tried to lift his  head, but had not the strength. A strange shade was creeping across the  bronzed rough face.    \"My feet are pretty heavy. Shore you got my boots off?\"    Duane held them up, but was not certain that Stevens could see them.  The outlaw closed his eyes again and muttered incoherently. Then he fell  asleep. Duane believed that sleep was final. The day passed, with Duane  watching and waiting. Toward sundown Stevens awoke, and his eyes seemed  clearer. Duane went to get some fresh water, thinking his comrade would  surely want some. When he returned Stevens made no sign that he wanted  anything. There was something bright about him, and suddenly Duane  realized what it meant.    \"Pard, you--stuck--to me!\" the outlaw whispered.    Duane caught a hint of gladness in the voice; he traced a faint surprise  in the haggard face. Stevens seemed like a little child.    To Duane the moment was sad, elemental, big, with a burden of mystery he  could not understand.    Duane buried him in a shallow arroyo and heaped up a pile of stones  to mark the grave. That done, he saddled his comrade's horse, hung the  weapons over the pommel; and, mounting his own steed, he rode down the  trail in the gathering twilight.        CHAPTER IV    Two days later, about the middle of the forenoon, Duane dragged the  two horses up the last ascent of an exceedingly rough trail and found  himself on top of the Rim Rock, with a beautiful green valley at his  feet, the yellow, sluggish Rio Grande shining in the sun, and the great,  wild, mountainous barren of Mexico stretching to the south.    Duane had not fallen in with any travelers. He had taken the  likeliest-looking trail he had come across. Where it had led him he had  not the slightest idea, except that here was the river, and probably the  inclosed valley was the retreat of some famous outlaw.    No wonder outlaws were safe in that wild refuge! Duane had spent the  last two days climbing the roughest and most difficult trail he had ever  seen. From the looks of the descent he imagined the worst part of his  travel was yet to come. Not improbably it was two thousand feet down to  the river. The wedge-shaped valley, green with alfalfa and cottonwood,  and nestling down amid the bare walls of yellow rock, was a delight and  a relief to his tired eyes. Eager to get down to a level and to find a  place to rest, Duane began the descent.    The trail proved to be the kind that could not be descended slowly. He  kept dodging rocks which his horses loosed behind him. And in a short  time he reached the valley, entering at the apex of the wedge. A stream  of clear water tumbled out of the rocks here, and most of it ran into  irrigation-ditches. His horses drank thirstily. And he drank with that  fullness and gratefulness common to the desert traveler finding sweet  water. Then he mounted and rode down the valley wondering what would be  his reception.    The valley was much larger than it had appeared from the high elevation.  Well watered, green with grass and tree, and farmed evidently by good  hands, it gave Duane a considerable surprise. Horses and cattle were  everywhere. Every clump of cottonwoods surrounded a small adobe house.  Duane saw Mexicans working in the fields and horsemen going to and  fro. Presently he passed a house bigger than the others with a porch  attached. A woman, young and pretty he thought, watched him from a door.  No one else appeared to notice him.    Presently the trail widened into a road, and that into a kind of square  lined by a number of adobe and log buildings of rudest structure.  Within sight were horses, dogs, a couple of steers, Mexican women with  children, and white men, all of whom appeared to be doing nothing. His  advent created no interest until he rode up to the white men, who were  lolling in the shade of a house. This place evidently was a store and  saloon, and from the inside came a lazy hum of voices.    As Duane reined to a halt one of the loungers in the shade rose with a  loud exclamation:    \"Bust me if thet ain't Luke's hoss!\"    The others accorded their interest, if not assent, by rising to advance  toward Duane.    \"How about it, Euchre? Ain't thet Luke's bay?\" queried the first man.    \"Plain as your nose,\" replied the fellow called Euchre.    \"There ain't no doubt about thet, then,\" laughed another, \"fer Bosomer's  nose is shore plain on the landscape.\"    These men lined up before Duane, and as he coolly regarded them he  thought they could have been recognized anywhere as desperadoes. The  man called Bosomer, who had stepped forward, had a forbidding face which  showed yellow eyes, an enormous nose, and a skin the color of dust, with  a thatch of sandy hair.    \"Stranger, who are you an' where in the hell did you git thet bay hoss?\"  he demanded. His yellow eyes took in Stevens's horse, then the weapons  hung on the saddle, and finally turned their glinting, hard light upward  to Duane.    Duane did not like the tone in which he had been addressed, and he  remained silent. At least half his mind seemed busy with curious  interest in regard to something that leaped inside him and made his  breast feel tight. He recognized it as that strange emotion which had  shot through him often of late, and which had decided him to go out to  the meeting with Bain. Only now it was different, more powerful.    \"Stranger, who are you?\" asked another man, somewhat more civilly.    \"My name's Duane,\" replied Duane, curtly.    \"An' how'd you come by the hoss?\"    Duane answered briefly, and his words were followed by a short silence,  during which the men looked at him. Bosomer began to twist the ends of  his beard.    \"Reckon he's dead, all right, or nobody'd hev his hoss an' guns,\"  presently said Euchre.    \"Mister Duane,\" began Bosomer, in low, stinging tones, \"I happen to be  Luke Stevens's side-pardner.\"    Duane looked him over, from dusty, worn-out boots to his slouchy  sombrero. That look seemed to inflame Bosomer.    \"An' I want the hoss an' them guns,\" he shouted.    \"You or anybody else can have them, for all I care. I just fetched them  in. But the pack is mine,\" replied Duane. \"And say, I befriended your  pard. If you can't use a civil tongue you'd better cinch it.\"    \"Civil? Haw, haw!\" rejoined the outlaw. \"I don't know you. How do we  know you didn't plug Stevens, an' stole his hoss, an' jest happened to  stumble down here?\"    \"You'll have to take my word, that's all,\" replied Duane, sharply.    \"I ain't takin' your word! Savvy thet? An' I was Luke's pard!\"    With that Bosomer wheeled and, pushing his companions aside, he stamped  into the saloon, where his voice broke out in a roar.    Duane dismounted and threw his bridle.    \"Stranger, Bosomer is shore hot-headed,\" said the man Euchre. He did not  appear unfriendly, nor were the others hostile.    At this juncture several more outlaws crowded out of the door, and  the one in the lead was a tall man of stalwart physique. His manner  proclaimed him a leader. He had a long face, a flaming red beard, and  clear, cold blue eyes that fixed in close scrutiny upon Duane. He was  not a Texan; in truth, Duane did not recognize one of these outlaws as  native to his state.    \"I'm Bland,\" said the tall man, authoritatively. \"Who're you and what're  you doing here?\"    Duane looked at Bland as he had at the others. This outlaw chief  appeared to be reasonable, if he was not courteous. Duane told his story  again, this time a little more in detail.    \"I believe you,\" replied Bland, at once. \"Think I know when a fellow is  lying.\"    \"I reckon you're on the right trail,\" put in Euchre. \"Thet about Luke  wantin' his boots took off--thet satisfies me. Luke hed a mortal dread  of dyin' with his boots on.\"    At this sally the chief and his men laughed.    \"You said Duane--Buck Duane?\" queried Bland. \"Are you a son of that  Duane who was a gunfighter some years back?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Duane.    \"Never met him, and glad I didn't,\" said Bland, with a grim humor. \"So  you got in trouble and had to go on the dodge? What kind of trouble?\"    \"Had a fight.\"    \"Fight? Do you mean gun-play?\" questioned Bland. He seemed eager,  curious, speculative.    \"Yes. It ended in gun-play, I'm sorry to say,\" answered Duane.    \"Guess I needn't ask the son of Duane if he killed his man,\" went on  Bland, ironically. \"Well, I'm sorry you bucked against trouble in my  camp. But as it is, I guess you'd be wise to make"]]]
