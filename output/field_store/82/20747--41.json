But now what Law is left to these two poor stupid laborers whereby one  shall yield to the other any of the treasure for which they have each  paid the whole price in surrendering Freia? They look by mere habit  to the god to judge for them; but he, with his heart stirring towards  higher forces than himself, turns with disgust from these lower forces.  They settle it as two wolves might; and Fafnir batters his brother dead  with his staff. It is a horrible thing to see and hear, to anyone who  knows how much blood has been shed in the world in just that way by its  brutalized toilers, honest fellows enough until their betters betrayed  them. Fafnir goes off with his booty. It is quite useless to him. He has  neither the cunning nor the ambition to establish the Plutonic empire  with it. Merely to prevent others from getting it is the only purpose it  brings him. He piles it in a cave; transforms himself into a dragon by  the helmet; and devotes his life to guarding it, as much a slave to it  as a jailor is to his prisoner. He had much better have thrown it all  back into the Rhine and transformed himself into the shortest-lived  animal that enjoys at least a brief run in the sunshine. His case,  however, is far too common to be surprising. The world is overstocked  with persons who sacrifice all their affections, and madly trample and  batter down their fellows to obtain riches of which, when they get them,  they are unable to make the smallest use, and to which they become the  most miserable slaves.    The gods soon forget Fafnir in their rejoicing over Freia. Donner,  the Thunder god, springs to a rocky summit and calls the clouds as a  shepherd calls his flocks. They come at his summons; and he and the  castle are hidden by their black legions. Froh, the Rainbow god, hastens  to his side. At the stroke of Donner's hammer the black murk is riven in  all directions by darting ribbons of lightning; and as the air clears,  the castle is seen in its fullest splendor, accessible now by the  rainbow bridge which Froh has cast across the ravine. In the glory  of this moment Wotan has a great thought. With all his aspirations  to establish a reign of noble thought, of righteousness, order, and  justice, he has found that day that there is no race yet in the world  that quite spontaneously, naturally, and unconsciously realizes his  ideal. He himself has found how far short Godhead falls of the thing  it conceives. He, the greatest of gods, has been unable to control his  fate: he has been forced against his will to choose between evils, to  make disgraceful bargains, to break them still more disgracefully, and  even then to see the price of his disgrace slip through his fingers.  His consort has cost him half his vision; his castle has cost him his  affections; and the attempt to retain both has cost him his honor. On  every side he is shackled and bound, dependent on the laws of Fricka and  on the lies of Loki, forced to traffic with dwarfs for handicraft and  with giants for strength, and to pay them both in false coin. After all,  a god is a pitiful thing. But the fertility of the First Mother is not  yet exhausted. The life that came from her has ever climbed up to a  higher and higher organization. From toad and serpent to dwarf, from  bear and elephant to giant, from dwarf and giant to a god with thoughts,  with comprehension of the world, with ideals. Why should it stop there?  Why should it not rise from the god to the Hero? to the creature in whom  the god's unavailing thought shall have become effective will and life,  who shall make his way straight to truth and reality over the laws of  Fricka and the lies of Loki with a strength that overcomes giants and a  cunning that outwits dwarfs? Yes: Erda, the First Mother, must travail  again, and breed him a race of heroes to deliver the world and himself  from his limited powers and disgraceful bargains. This is the vision  that flashes on him as he turns to the rainbow bridge and calls his wife  to come and dwell with him in Valhalla, the home of the gods.    They are all overcome with Valhalla's glory except Loki. He is behind  the scenes of this joint reign of the Divine and the Legal. He despises  these gods with their ideals and their golden apples. \"I am ashamed,\" he  says, \"to have dealings with these futile creatures.\" And so he follows  them to the rainbow bridge. But as they set foot on it, from the river  below rises the wailing of the Rhine maidens for their lost gold. \"You  down there in the water,\" cries Loki with brutal irony: \"you used to  bask in the glitter of your gold: henceforth you shall bask in the  splendor of the gods.\" And they reply that the truth is in the depths  and the darkness, and that what blazes on high there is falsehood. And  with that the gods pass into their glorious stronghold.          WAGNER AS REVOLUTIONIST    Before leaving this explanation of The Rhine Gold, I must have a word or  two about it with the reader. It is the least popular of the sections of  The Ring. The reason is that its dramatic moments lie quite outside  the consciousness of people whose joys and sorrows are all domestic  and personal, and whose religions and political ideas are purely  conventional and superstitious. To them it is a struggle between half a  dozen fairytale personages for a ring, involving hours of scolding and  cheating, and one long scene in a dark gruesome mine, with gloomy, ugly  music, and not a glimpse of a handsome young man or pretty woman. Only  those of wider consciousness can follow it breathlessly, seeing in it  the whole tragedy of human history and the whole horror of the dilemmas  from which the world is shrinking today. At Bayreuth I have seen a party  of English tourists, after enduring agonies of boredom from Alberic,  rise in the middle of the third scene, and almost force their way out  of the dark theatre into the sunlit pine-wood without. And I have  seen people who were deeply affected by the scene driven almost beside  themselves by this disturbance. But it was a very natural thing for the  unfortunate tourists to do, since in this Rhine Gold prologue there is  no interval between the acts for escape. Roughly speaking, people who  have no general ideas, no touch of the concern of the philosopher and  statesman for the race, cannot enjoy The Rhine Gold as a drama. They may  find compensations in some exceedingly pretty music, at times even grand  and glorious, which will enable them to escape occasionally from the  struggle between Alberic and Wotan; but if their capacity for music  should be as limited as their comprehension of the world, they had  better stay away.    And now, attentive Reader, we have reached the point at which some  foolish person is sure to interrupt us by declaring that The Rhine Gold  is what they call \"a work of art\" pure and simple, and that Wagner never  dreamt of shareholders, tall hats, whitelead factories, and industrial  and political questions looked at from the socialistic and humanitarian  points of view. We need not discuss these impertinences: it is easier  to silence them with the facts of Wagner's life. In 1843 he obtained  the position of conductor of the Opera at Dresden at a salary of L225 a  year, with a pension. This was a first-rate permanent appointment in the  service of the Saxon State, carrying an assured professional  position and livelihood with it In 1848, the year of revolutions,  the discontented middle class, unable to rouse the Church-and-State  governments of the day from their bondage to custom, caste, and law by  appeals to morality or constitutional agitation for Liberal reforms,  made common cause with the starving wage-working class, and resorted to  armed rebellion, which reached Dresden in 1849. Had Wagner been the mere  musical epicure and political mugwump that the term \"artist\" seems to  suggest to so many critics and amateurs--that is, a creature in their  own lazy likeness--he need have taken no more part in the political  struggles of his day than Bishop took in the English Reform agitation of  1832, or Sterndale Bennett in the Chartist or Free Trade movements. What  he did do was first to make a desperate appeal to the King to cast off  his bonds and answer the need of the time by taking true Kingship on  himself and leading his people to the redress of their intolerable  wrongs (fancy the poor monarch's feelings!), and then, when the crash  came, to take his side with the right and the poor against the rich and  the wrong. When the insurrection was defeated, three leaders of it were  especially marked down for vengeance: August Roeckel, an old friend  of Wagner's to whom he wrote a well-known series of letters; Michael  Bakoonin, afterwards a famous apostle of revolutionary Anarchism; and  Wagner himself. Wagner escaped to Switzerland: Roeckel and Bakoonin  suffered long terms of imprisonment. Wagner was of course utterly  ruined, pecuniarily and socially (to his own intense relief and  satisfaction); and his exile lasted twelve years. His first idea was  to get his Tannhauser produced in Paris. With the notion of explaining  himself to the Parisians he wrote a pamphlet entitled Art and  Revolution, a glance through which will show how thoroughly the  socialistic side of the revolution had his sympathy, and how completely  he had got free from the influence of the established Churches of his  day. For three years he kept pouring forth pamphlets--some of them  elaborate treatises in size and intellectual rank, but still essentially  the pamphlets and manifestoes of a born agitator--on social evolution,  religion, life, art and the influence of riches. In 1853 the poem of The  Ring was privately printed; and in 1854, five years after the Dresden  insurrection, The Rhine Gold score was completed to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14874"],[0,"Elsie's Womanhood (#6)"],[1,"each other pretty much as  they always have,\" said Arthur to himself, taking a cigar from his pocket  and lighting it with a match. \"I wonder now what's the attraction to her  for an old codger like that,\" he added watching the smoke as it curled  lazily up from the end of his Havana.    There was indeed nothing sentimental in the conduct of Mr. Travilla or  Elsie: deep, true, heartfelt happiness there was on both sides, but calm  and quiet, indulging in little demonstration, except when they were quite  alone with each other. There was no secret made of the engagement, and it  was soon known to all their friends and acquaintance. Mr. Travilla had  always been in the habit of visiting the Oaks daily, and finding himself  very much at home there; and he continued to come and go as formerly, all  welcoming him with great cordiality, making him, if possible, more one of  themselves than ever, while there was little change in Elsie's manner,  except that all her late reserve had fled, and given place to the old ease  and freedom, the sweet, affectionate confidences of earlier days.    Mr. Dinsmore's determination to delay the marriage for a year was  decidedly a keen disappointment to the middle-aged lover, who had already  endured so long and patient a waiting for his prize; yet so thankful and  joyous was he that he had at last won her for his own, that, finding  remonstrance and entreaties alike unavailing, he presently accepted the  conditions with a very good grace, comforting himself with the certainty  of the permanence of her love. Elsie had no coquettish arts, was  simple-hearted, straightforward, and true, as in her childhood, and their  confidence in each other was unbounded.          CHAPTER FIFTH.               \"Joy never feasts so high      As when the first course is of misery.\"                                --SUCKLING.      Adelaide's marriage was fixed for Christmas eve, and Mr. Dinsmore and  Elsie decided to take their trip to Louisiana at once, that they might be  able to return in season for the wedding, at which Elsie was to be first  bridesmaid.    It was Elsie herself who broke the news of her intended journey to her  faithful old nurse, explaining why she felt it her duty to go, and kindly  leaving to Chloe's own decision whether she would accompany her or not.    The dusky face grew very sad for a moment, tears springing to the dark  eyes; but the voice was almost cheerful as she answered, \"Yes, you's  right, honey darlin' you's all right to go and see 'bout dem poor souls  and let 'em see dere beau'ful young missus; and your ole mammy 'll go  'long too, for she neber could stay and let her chile run all dem risks on  de boats an' cars an' she no dar to take care ob her.\"    \"That's right, my own dear old mammy. I shall be glad to have you along,  and hope you will find it pleasanter than you expect; but we must trust  the Lord to take care of us all; for He only can prevent the accidents you  fear.\"    \"Yes, yes, honey, dat's de truff; an' we'll trust Him an' not be 'fraid,  'cause don't He say, 'Not a hair ob your head shall perish.'\"    \"'What time I am afraid I will trust in Thee,'\" murmured Elsie, softly.  \"Ah, the joy, the peace, of knowing that His presence and His love will  ever go with us everywhere; and that He has all power in heaven and in  earth.\"    A week later, Mr. Dinsmore was showing his daughter the beauties of New  Orleans, where they had arrived without accident or loss. They remained in  the city long enough to attend thoroughly to the business which had called  them there, and to see everything worth looking at.    Elsie's plantation was in the Teche country, the very loveliest part of  grand old Louisiana. In order that suitable preparations might be made for  their reception, word had been sent that they might be expected on a  certain day.    \"We have allowed more time than necessary for this place,\" said Mr.  Dinsmore to his daughter one evening on returning to their hotel, after  seeing the last of the lions of the Crescent City; \"we have two days to  spare; what shall be done in them?\"    \"Let us go on to Viamede at once then, papa,\" replied Elsie, promptly. \"I  have been regretting that we sent notice of our coming. I doubt if it  would not have been wiser to take them by surprise.\"    \"There would not be the same preparations for your comfort,\" replied her  father, taking a seat by her on the sofa, for they were in their own  private parlor; \"you may find unaired bed-linen and an empty larder,  which, beside inconveniencing yourself, would sorely mortify and trouble  Aunt Phillis and her right-hand woman, Sarah, the cook.\"    \"I should be sorry you should have an inhospitable reception, papa, but  fires are soon kindled and linen aired, and is not the pantry kept  supplied with canned and preserved fruits? and are there not fresh fruits,  vegetables, chickens, and eggs at hand for immediate use?\"    \"Yes, certainly; and we are not likely to suffer. We Will, then, leave  here to-morrow, if you wish, taking the steamer for Berwick Bay. But why  prefer to come upon them unexpectedly?\"    Elsie smiled, and blushed slightly. \"You know I never have any  concealments from you, papa, and I will be frank about this,\" she said. \"I  don't think I apt to be suspicious, and yet the thought has come to me  several times within the last few days, that the overseer has had every  opportunity to abuse my poor people if he happens to be of a cruel  disposition. And if he is ill-treating them I should like to catch him at  it,\" she added, her eyes kindling, and the color deepening on her cheek.    \"And what would you do in that case?\" her lather asked, with a slight  smile, drawing her close to him and touching his lips to the blooming  cheek.    \"Dismiss him, I suppose, papa; I don't know what else I could do to punish  him or prevent further cruelties. I should not like to shoot him down,\"  she added, laughingly; \"and I doubt if I should have strength to flog  him.\"    \"Doubt?\" laughed her father, \"certainly you could not, single-handed;  unless his politeness should lead him to refrain from any effort to defend  himself; and I, it would seem, am not expected to have anything to do with  the matter.\"    A deeper blush than before now suffused Elsie's fair cheek. \"Forgive me,  dear papa,\" she said, laying her head on his shoulder, and fondly stroking  his face with her pretty white hand. \"Please consider yourself master  there as truly as at the Oaks, and as you have been for years; and  understand that your daughter means to take no important step without your  entire approval.\"    \"No, I do not go there as master, but as your guest,\" he answered, half  playfully, half tenderly.    \"My guest? That seems pleasant indeed, papa; and yet I want you to be  master too. But you will at least advise me?\"    \"To the best of my ability, my little girl.\"    \"Thank you, my dear kind father. I have another reason for wishing to  start to-morrow. I'm growing anxious and impatient to see my birthplace  again: and,\" she added low and tenderly, \"mamma's grave.\"    \"Yes, we will visit it together for the first time; though I have stood  there alone again and again, and her baby daughter used to be taken there  frequently to scatter flowers over it and play beside it. Do you remember  that?\"    \"Yes, sir, as an almost forgotten dream, as I do the house and grounds and  some of the old servants who petted and humored me.\"    While father and daughter conversed thus together in the parlor, a dusky  figure sat at a window in the adjoining bedroom, gazing out upon the  moonlighted streets and watching the passers-by. But her thoughts, too,  were straying to Viamede; fast-coming memories of earlier days, some all  bright and joyous, others filled with the gloom and thick darkness of a  terrible anguish, made her by turns long for and dread the arrival at her  journey's end.    A light touch on her shoulder, and she turned to find her young mistress  at her side.    \"My poor old mammy, I bring you news you will be sorry to hear,\" said  Elsie, seating herself upon the ample lap, and laying her arm across the  broad shoulders.    \"What dat, honey?\"    \"We start to-morrow for Viamede; papa has sent John to engage our passage  on the steamer.\"    \"Dat all, darlin'?\" queried Chloe, with a sigh of relief, \"if we's got to  go, might's well go quick an' hab it ober.\"    \"Well, I'm glad you take so sensible a view of it,\" remarked Elsie,  relieved in her turn; \"and I hope you will find much less pain and more  pleasure than you expect in going back to the old home.\"    The next morning, as Mr. Dinsmore and his daughter sat upon the deck of  the steamer, enjoying the sunlight, the breeze, and the dancing of the  water, having cleared their port and gotten fairly out into the gulf, a  startling incident occurred.    Chloe stood at a respectful distance, leaning over the side of the vessel,  watching the play of the wheel and the rainbow in the spray that fell in  showers at its every revolution. An old negro busied about the deck; drew  near and addressed her:    \"Well, auntie, you watchin' dat ole wheel dar? Fust time you trable on dis  boat, eh?\"    Chloe started at the sound of the voice, turned suddenly round and faced  the speaker, her features working with emotion: one moment of earnest  scrutiny on the part of both, and with a wild cry, \"Aunt Chloe! my ole  woman,\" \"Uncle Joe! it can't be you,\" they rushed into each other's arms,  and hung about each other's neck, weeping and sobbing like two children.    \"Papa! what is it?\" exclaimed Elsie, greatly surprised at the little  scene.    \"Her husband, no doubt: he's too old to be a son.\"    \"Oh, how glad, how glad I am!\" and Elsie started to her feet, her eyes  full of tears, and her sweet face sparkling all over with sympathetic joy.  \"Papa, I shall buy him! they must never be parted again till death comes  between.\"    A little crowd had already"]]]
