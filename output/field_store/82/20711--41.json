The  multiplication of these rays on the retina produces a picture of  whatever is before the eye, such as can be seen on the ground glass at  the back of a photographer's camera, or on the table of a camera  obscura, both of which instruments are constructed roughly on the same  principle as the human eye.    These rays of light when reflected from an object, and again when  passing through the atmosphere, undergo certain modifications. Should  the object be a red one, the yellow, green, and blue rays, all, in fact,  except the red rays, are absorbed by the object, while the red is  allowed to escape. These red rays striking the retina produce certain  effects which convey to our consciousness the sensation of red, and we  say \"That is a red object.\" But there may be particles of moisture or  dust in the air that will modify the red rays so that by the time they  reach the eye they may be somewhat different. This modification is  naturally most effective when a large amount of atmosphere has to be  passed through, and in things very distant the colour of the natural  object is often entirely lost, to be replaced by atmospheric colours, as  we see in distant mountains when the air is not perfectly clear. But we  must not stray into the fascinating province of colour.    What chiefly concerns us here is the fact that the pictures on our  retinas are flat, of two dimensions, the same as the canvas on which we  paint. If you examine these visual pictures without any prejudice, as  one may with a camera obscura, you will see that they are composed of  masses of colour in infinite variety and complexity, of different shapes  and gradations, and with many varieties of edges; giving to the eye the  illusion of nature with actual depths and distances, although one knows  all the time that it is a flat table on which one is looking.    Seeing then that our eyes have only flat pictures containing  two-dimension information about the objective world, from whence is  this knowledge of distance and the solidity of things? How do we _see_  the third dimension, the depth and thickness, by means of flat pictures  of two dimensions?    The power to judge distance is due principally to our possessing two  eyes situated in slightly different positions, from which we get two  views of objects, and also to the power possessed by the eyes of  focussing at different distances, others being out of focus for the time  being. In a picture the eyes can only focus at one distance (the  distance the eye is from the plane of the picture when you are looking  at it), and this is one of the chief causes of the perennial difficulty  in painting backgrounds. In nature they are out of focus when one is  looking at an object, but in a painting the background is necessarily on  the same focal plane as the object. Numerous are the devices resorted to  by painters to overcome this difficulty, but they do not concern us  here.    The fact that we have two flat pictures on our two retinas to help us,  and that we can focus at different planes, would not suffice to account  for our knowledge of the solidity and shape of the objective world, were  these senses not associated with another sense all important in ideas of  form, #the sense of touch#.    This sense is very highly developed in us, and the earlier period of our  existence is largely given over to feeling for the objective world  outside ourselves. Who has not watched the little baby hands feeling for  everything within reach, and without its reach, for the matter of that;  for the infant has no knowledge yet of what is and what is not within  its reach. Who has not offered some bright object to a young child and  watched its clumsy attempts to feel for it, almost as clumsy at first as  if it were blind, as it has not yet learned to focus distances. And when  he has at last got hold of it, how eagerly he feels it all over, looking  intently at it all the time; thus learning early to associate the \"feel  of an object\" with its appearance. In this way by degrees he acquires  those ideas of roughness and smoothness, hardness and softness,  solidity, &c., which later on he will be able to distinguish by vision  alone, and without touching the object.    Our survival depends so much on this sense of touch, that it is of the  first importance to us. We must know whether the ground is hard enough  for us to walk on, or whether there is a hole in front of us; and masses  of colour rays striking the retina, which is what vision amounts to,  will not of themselves tell us. But associated with the knowledge  accumulated in our early years, by connecting touch with sight, we do  know when certain combinations of colour rays strike the eye that there  is a road for us to walk on, and that when certain other combinations  occur there is a hole in front of us, or the edge of a precipice.    And likewise with hardness and softness, the child who strikes his head  against the bed-post is forcibly reminded by nature that such things are  to be avoided, and feeling that it is hard and that hardness has a  certain look, it avoids that kind of thing in the future. And when it  strikes its head against the pillow, it learns the nature of softness,  and associating this sensation with the appearance of the pillow, knows  in future that when softness is observed it need not be avoided as  hardness must be.    Sight is therefore not a matter of the eye alone. A whole train of  associations connected with the objective world is set going in the mind  when rays of light strike the retina refracted from objects. And these  associations vary enormously in quantity and value with different  individuals; but the one we are here chiefly concerned with is this  universal one of touch. Everybody \"sees\" the shape of an object, and  \"sees\" whether it \"looks\" hard or soft, &c. Sees, in other words, the  \"feel\" of it.    If you are asked to think of an object, say a cone, it will not, I  think, be the visual aspect that will occur to most people. They will  think of a circular base from which a continuous side slopes up to a  point situated above its centre, as one would feel it. The fact that in  almost every visual aspect the base line is that of an ellipse, not a  circle, comes as a surprise to people unaccustomed to drawing.    But above these cruder instances, what a wealth of associations crowd in  upon the mind, when a sight that moves one is observed. Put two men  before a scene, one an ordinary person and the other a great poet, and  ask them to describe what they see. Assuming them both to be possessed  of a reasonable power honestly to express themselves, what a difference  would there be in the value of their descriptions. Or take two painters  both equally gifted in the power of expressing their visual perceptions,  and put them before the scene to paint it. And assuming one to be a  commonplace man and the other a great artist, what a difference will  there be in their work. The commonplace painter will paint a commonplace  picture, while the form and colour will be the means of stirring deep  associations and feelings in the mind of the other, and will move him  to paint the scene so that the same splendour of associations may be  conveyed to the beholder.    [Illustration: Plate VII.    STUDY FOR THE FIGURE OF APOLLO IN THE PICTURE \"APOLLO AND DAPHNE\"    In natural red chalk rubbed with finger; the high lights are picked out  with rubber.]    But to return to our infant mind. While the development of the  perception of things has been going on, the purely visual side of the  question, the observation of the picture on the retina for what it is as  form and colour, has been neglected--neglected to such an extent that  when the child comes to attempt drawing, #sight is not the sense he  consults#. The mental idea of the objective world that has grown up in  his mind is now associated more directly with touch than with sight,  with the felt shape rather than the visual appearance. So that if he is  asked to draw a head, he thinks of it first as an object having a  continuous boundary in space. This his mind instinctively conceives as a  line. Then, hair he expresses by a row of little lines coming out from  the boundary, all round the top. He thinks of eyes as two points or  circles, or as points in circles, and the nose either as a triangle or  an L-shaped line. If you feel the nose you will see the reason of this.  Down the front you have the L line, and if you feel round it you will  find the two sides meeting at the top and a base joining them,  suggesting the triangle. The mouth similarly is an opening with a row of  teeth, which are generally shown although so seldom seen, but always  apparent if the mouth is felt (see diagram A). This is, I think, a fair  type of the first drawing the ordinary child makes--and judging by some  ancient scribbling of the same order I remember noticing scratched on a  wall at Pompeii, and by savage drawing generally, it appears to be a  fairly universal type. It is a very remarkable thing which, as far as I  know, has not yet been pointed out, that in these first attempts at  drawing the vision should not be consulted. A blind man would not draw  differently, could he but see to draw. Were vision the first sense  consulted, and were the simplest visual appearance sought after, one  might expect something like diagram B, the shadows under eyes, nose,  mouth, and chin, with the darker mass of the hair being the simplest  thing the visual appearance can be reduced to. But despite this being  quite as easy to do, it does not appeal to the ordinary child as the  other type does, because it does not satisfy the sense of touch that  forms so large a part of the idea of an object in the mind. All  architectural elevations and geometrical projections generally appeal to  this mental idea of form.

Just below, in silver letters on a red cardboard ground, were the  words, \"Be not afraid, it is I.\"    \"It's ever such a fine face,\" said Alice faintly.    The pale-blue bow on the top of Mrs. Stubbs's fair frizzy hair quivered.  She arched her plump neck. What a neck she had! It was bright pink where  it began and then it changed to warm apricot, and that faded to the  colour of a brown egg and then to a deep creamy.    \"All the same, my dear,\" she said surprisingly, \"freedom's best!\" Her  soft, fat chuckle sounded like a purr. \"Freedom's best,\" said Mrs.  Stubbs again.    Freedom! Alice gave a loud, silly little titter. She felt awkward. Her  mind flew back to her own kitching. Ever so queer! She wanted to be back  in it again.      Chapter 1.IX.    A strange company assembled in the Burnells' washhouse after tea. Round  the table there sat a bull, a rooster, a donkey that kept forgetting it  was a donkey, a sheep and a bee. The washhouse was the perfect place for  such a meeting because they could make as much noise as they liked, and  nobody ever interrupted. It was a small tin shed standing apart from the  bungalow. Against the wall there was a deep trough and in the corner a  copper with a basket of clothes-pegs on top of it. The little window,  spun over with cobwebs, had a piece of candle and a mouse-trap on the  dusty sill. There were clotheslines criss-crossed overhead and, hanging  from a peg on the wall, a very big, a huge, rusty horseshoe. The table  was in the middle with a form at either side.    \"You can't be a bee, Kezia. A bee's not an animal. It's a ninseck.\"    \"Oh, but I do want to be a bee frightfully,\" wailed Kezia... A tiny bee,  all yellow-furry, with striped legs. She drew her legs up under her and  leaned over the table. She felt she was a bee.    \"A ninseck must be an animal,\" she said stoutly. \"It makes a noise. It's  not like a fish.\"    \"I'm a bull, I'm a bull!\" cried Pip. And he gave such a tremendous  bellow--how did he make that noise?--that Lottie looked quite alarmed.    \"I'll be a sheep,\" said little Rags. \"A whole lot of sheep went past  this morning.\"    \"How do you know?\"    \"Dad heard them. Baa!\" He sounded like the little lamb that trots behind  and seems to wait to be carried.    \"Cock-a-doodle-do!\" shrilled Isabel. With her red cheeks and bright eyes  she looked like a rooster.    \"What'll I be?\" Lottie asked everybody, and she sat there smiling,  waiting for them to decide for her. It had to be an easy one.    \"Be a donkey, Lottie.\" It was Kezia's suggestion. \"Hee-haw! You can't  forget that.\"    \"Hee-haw!\" said Lottie solemnly. \"When do I have to say it?\"    \"I'll explain, I'll explain,\" said the bull. It was he who had the  cards. He waved them round his head. \"All be quiet! All listen!\" And he  waited for them. \"Look here, Lottie.\" He turned up a card. \"It's got two  spots on it--see? Now, if you put that card in the middle and somebody  else has one with two spots as well, you say 'Hee-haw,' and the card's  yours.\"    \"Mine?\" Lottie was round-eyed. \"To keep?\"    \"No, silly. Just for the game, see? Just while we're playing.\" The bull  was very cross with her.    \"Oh, Lottie, you are a little silly,\" said the proud rooster.    Lottie looked at both of them. Then she hung her head; her lip quivered.  \"I don't want to play,\" she whispered. The others glanced at one another  like conspirators. All of them knew what that meant. She would go away  and be discovered somewhere standing with her pinny thrown over her  head, in a corner, or against a wall, or even behind a chair.    \"Yes, you do, Lottie. It's quite easy,\" said Kezia.    And Isabel, repentant, said exactly like a grown-up, \"Watch me, Lottie,  and you'll soon learn.\"    \"Cheer up, Lot,\" said Pip. \"There, I know what I'll do. I'll give you  the first one. It's mine, really, but I'll give it to you. Here you  are.\" And he slammed the card down in front of Lottie.    Lottie revived at that. But now she was in another difficulty. \"I  haven't got a hanky,\" she said; \"I want one badly, too.\"    \"Here, Lottie, you can use mine.\" Rags dipped into his sailor blouse and  brought up a very wet-looking one, knotted together. \"Be very careful,\"  he warned her. \"Only use that corner. Don't undo it. I've got a little  starfish inside I'm going to try and tame.\"    \"Oh, come on, you girls,\" said the bull. \"And mind--you're not to look  at your cards. You've got to keep your hands under the table till I say  'Go.'\"    Smack went the cards round the table. They tried with all their might to  see, but Pip was too quick for them. It was very exciting, sitting there  in the washhouse; it was all they could do not to burst into a little  chorus of animals before Pip had finished dealing.    \"Now, Lottie, you begin.\"    Timidly Lottie stretched out a hand, took the top card off her pack, had  a good look at it--it was plain she was counting the spots--and put it  down.    \"No, Lottie, you can't do that. You mustn't look first. You must turn it  the other way over.\"    \"But then everybody will see it the same time as me,\" said Lottie.    The game proceeded. Mooe-ooo-er! The bull was terrible. He charged over  the table and seemed to eat the cards up.    Bss-ss! said the bee.    Cock-a-doodle-do! Isabel stood up in her excitement and moved her elbows  like wings.    Baa! Little Rags put down the King of Diamonds and Lottie put down the  one they called the King of Spain. She had hardly any cards left.    \"Why don't you call out, Lottie?\"    \"I've forgotten what I am,\" said the donkey woefully.    \"Well, change! Be a dog instead! Bow-wow!\"    \"Oh yes. That's much easier.\" Lottie smiled again. But when she and  Kezia both had a one Kezia waited on purpose. The others made signs to  Lottie and pointed. Lottie turned very red; she looked bewildered, and  at last she said, \"Hee-haw! Ke-zia.\"    \"Ss! Wait a minute!\" They were in the very thick of it when the bull  stopped them, holding up his hand. \"What's that? What's that noise?\"    \"What noise? What do you mean?\" asked the rooster.    \"Ss! Shut up! Listen!\" They were mouse-still. \"I thought I heard a--a  sort of knocking,\" said the bull.    \"What was it like?\" asked the sheep faintly.    No answer.    The bee gave a shudder. \"Whatever did we shut the door for?\" she said  softly. Oh, why, why had they shut the door?    While they were playing, the day had faded; the gorgeous sunset had  blazed and died. And now the quick dark came racing over the sea, over  the sand-hills, up the paddock. You were frightened to look in the  corners of the washhouse, and yet you had to look with all your might.  And somewhere, far away, grandma was lighting a lamp. The blinds  were being pulled down; the kitchen fire leapt in the tins on the  mantelpiece.    \"It would be awful now,\" said the bull, \"if a spider was to fall from  the ceiling on to the table, wouldn't it?\"    \"Spiders don't fall from ceilings.\"    \"Yes, they do. Our Min told us she'd seen a spider as big as a saucer,  with long hairs on it like a gooseberry.\"    Quickly all the little heads were jerked up; all the little bodies drew  together, pressed together.    \"Why doesn't somebody come and call us?\" cried the rooster.    Oh, those grown-ups, laughing and snug, sitting in the lamp-light,  drinking out of cups! They'd forgotten about them. No, not really  forgotten. That was what their smile meant. They had decided to leave  them there all by themselves.    Suddenly Lottie gave such a piercing scream that all of them jumped off  the forms, all of them screamed too. \"A face--a face looking!\" shrieked  Lottie.    It was true, it was real. Pressed against the window was a pale face,  black eyes, a black beard.    \"Grandma! Mother! Somebody!\"    But they had not got to the door, tumbling over one another, before it  opened for Uncle Jonathan. He had come to take the little boys home.      Chapter 1.X.    He had meant to be there before, but in the front garden he had come  upon Linda walking up and down the grass, stopping to pick off a dead  pink or give a top-heavy carnation something to lean against, or to take  a deep breath of something, and then walking on again, with her little  air of remoteness. Over her white frock she wore a yellow, pink-fringed  shawl from the Chinaman's shop.    \"Hallo, Jonathan!\" called Linda. And Jonathan whipped off his shabby  panama, pressed it against his breast, dropped on one knee, and kissed  Linda's hand.    \"Greeting, my Fair One! Greeting, my Celestial Peach Blossom!\" boomed  the bass voice gently. \"Where are the other noble dames?\"    \"Beryl's out playing bridge and mother's giving the boy his bath... Have  you come to borrow something?\"    The Trouts were for ever running out of things and sending across to the  Burnells' at the last moment.    But Jonathan only answered, \"A little love, a little kindness;\" and he  walked by his sister-in-law's side.    Linda dropped into Beryl's hammock under the manuka-tree, and Jonathan  stretched himself on the grass beside her, pulled a long stalk and began  chewing it. They knew each other well. The voices of children cried from  the other gardens. A fisherman's light cart shook along the sandy road,  and from far away they heard a dog barking; it was muffled as though the  dog had its head in a sack. If you listened you could just hear the soft  swish of the sea at full tide sweeping the pebbles. The sun was sinking.    \"And so you go back to the office on Monday, do you, Jonathan?\" asked  Linda.    \"On Monday the cage door opens and clangs to upon the victim for another  eleven months and a week,\" answered Jonathan.    Linda swung a little. \"It must be awful,\" she said slowly.    \"Would ye have me laugh, my fair sister? Would ye have me weep?\"    Linda was so accustomed to Jonathan's way of talking that she paid no  attention to it.    \"I suppose,\" she said vaguely, \"one gets used to it. One"]]]
