Taking two white sheepskins from the heap  of sacks in the corner, the old man doubled them up, and lifting the  boy's head gently from the slate on which it rested, placed the skins  beneath it.    \"Poor lambie, poor lambie!\" he said, tenderly patting the great rough  bear-like head; \"tired is he!\"    He threw an overcoat across the boy's feet, and lifted the saucepan from  the fire. There was no place where the old man could comfortably lie  down himself, so he resumed his seat. Opening a much-worn Bible, he  began to read, and as he read pleasant thoughts and visions thronged on  him.    \"I was a stranger, and ye took me in,\" he read.    He turned again to the bed where the sleeper lay.    \"I was a stranger.\"    Very tenderly the old man looked at him. He saw not the bloated body  nor the evil face of the man; but, as it were, under deep disguise and  fleshly concealment, the form that long years of dreaming had made very  real to him. \"Jesus, lover, and is it given to us, weak and sinful,  frail and erring, to serve Thee, to take Thee in!\" he said softly, as he  rose from his seat. Full of joy, he began to pace the little room. Now  and again as he walked he sang the lines of a German hymn, or muttered  broken words of prayer. The little room was full of light. It appeared  to the German that Christ was very near him, and that at almost any  moment the thin mist of earthly darkness that clouded his human eyes  might be withdrawn, and that made manifest of which the friends at  Emmaus, beholding it, said, \"It is the Lord!\"    Again, and yet again, through the long hours of that night, as the  old man walked he looked up to the roof of his little room, with its  blackened rafters, and yet saw them not. His rough bearded face was  illuminated with a radiant gladness; and the night was not shorter to  the dreaming sleepers than to him whose waking dreams brought heaven  near.    So quickly the night fled, that he looked up with surprise when at four  o'clock the first grey streaks of summer dawn showed themselves through  the little window. Then the old man turned to rake together the few  coals that lay under the ashes, and his son, turning on the sheepskins,  muttered sleepily to know if it were time to rise.    \"Lie still, lie still! I would only make a fire,\" said the old man.    \"Have you been up all night?\" asked the boy.    \"Yes; but it has been short, very short. Sleep again, my chicken; it is  yet early.\"    And he went out to fetch more fuel.          Chapter 1.IV. Blessed is He That Believeth.    Bonaparte Blenkins sat on the side of the bed. He had wonderfully  revived since the day before, held his head high, talked in a full  sonorous voice, and ate greedily of all the viands offered him. At his  side was a basin of soup, from which he took a deep draught now and  again as he watched the fingers of the German, who sat on the mud floor  mending the bottom of a chair.    Presently he looked out, where, in the afternoon sunshine, a few  half-grown ostriches might be seen wandering listlessly about, and then  he looked in again at the little whitewashed room, and at Lyndall, who  sat in the doorway looking at a book. Then he raised his chin and tried  to adjust an imaginary shirt-collar. Finding none, he smoothed the  little grey fringe at the back of his head, and began:    \"You are a student of history, I perceive, my friend, from the study  of these volumes that lie scattered about this apartment; this fact has  been made evident to me.\"    \"Well--a little--perhaps--it may be,\" said the German meekly.    \"Being a student of history then,\" said Bonaparte, raising himself  loftily, \"you will doubtless have heard of my great, of my celebrated  kinsman, Napoleon Bonaparte?\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said the German, looking up.    \"I, sir,\" said Bonaparte, \"was born at this hour, on an April afternoon,  three-and-fifty years ago. The nurse, sir--she was the same who attended  when the Duke of Sutherland was born--brought me to my mother. 'There is  only one name for this child,' she said: 'he has the nose of his great  kinsman;' and so Bonaparte Blenkins became my name--Bonaparte Blenkins.  Yes, sir,\" said Bonaparte, \"there is a stream on my maternal side that  connects me with a stream on his maternal side.\"    The German made a sound of astonishment.    \"The connection,\" said Bonaparte, \"is one which could not be easily  comprehended by one unaccustomed to the study of aristocratic pedigrees;  but the connection is close.\"    \"Is it possible!\" said the German, pausing in his work with much  interest and astonishment. \"Napoleon an Irishman!\"    \"Yes,\" said Bonaparte, \"on the mother's side, and that is how we are  related. There wasn't a man to beat him,\" said Bonaparte, stretching  himself--\"not a man except the Duke of Wellington. And it's a strange  coincidence,\" added Bonaparte, bending forward, \"but he was a connection  of mine. His nephew, the Duke of Wellington's nephew, married a cousin  of mine. She was a woman! See her at one of the court balls--amber  satin--daisies in her hair. Worth going a hundred miles to look at her!  Often seen her there myself, sir!\"    The German moved the leather thongs in and out, and thought of the  strange vicissitudes of human life, which might bring the kinsman of  dukes and emperors to his humble room.    Bonaparte appeared lost among old memories.    \"Ah, that Duke of Wellington's nephew!\" he broke forth suddenly; \"many's  the joke I've had with him. Often came to visit me at Bonaparte Hall.  Grand place I had then--park, conservatory, servants. He had only one  fault, that Duke of Wellington's nephew,\" said Bonaparte, observing that  the German was deeply interested in every word, \"He was a coward--what  you might call a coward. You've never been in Russia, I suppose?\" said  Bonaparte, fixing his crosswise looking eyes on the German's face.    \"No, no,\" said the old man humbly. \"France, England, Germany, a little  in this country; it is all I have travelled.\"    \"I, my friend,\" said Bonaparte, \"I have been in every country in the  world, and speak every civilised language, excepting only Dutch and  German. I wrote a book of my travels--noteworthy incidents. Publisher  got it--cheated me out of it. Great rascals those publishers! Upon  one occasion the Duke of Wellington's nephew and I were travelling  in Russia. All of a sudden one of the horses dropped down dead as  a doornail. There we were--cold night--snow four feet thick--great  forest--one horse not being able to move the sledge--night coming  on--wolves.    \"'Spree!' says the Duke of Wellington's nephew.    \"'Spree, do you call it? says I. 'Look out.'    \"There, sticking out under a bush, was nothing less than the nose of a  bear. The Duke of Wellington's nephew was up a tree like a shot; I stood  quietly on the ground, as cool as I am at this moment, loaded my gun,  and climbed up the tree. There was only one bough.    \"'Bon,' said the Duke of Wellington's nephew, 'you'd better sit in  front.'    \"'All right,' said I; 'but keep your gun ready. There are more coming.'  He'd got his face buried in my back.    \"'How many are there?' said he.    \"'Four,' said I.    \"'How many are there now?' said he.    \"'Eight,' said I.    \"'How many are there now?' said he.    \"'Ten,' said I.    \"'Ten! ten!' said he; and down goes his gun.    \"'Wallie,' I said, 'what have you done? We're dead men now.'    \"'Bon, my old fellow,' said he, 'I couldn't help it; my hands trembled  so!'    \"'Wall,' I said, turning round and seizing his hand, 'Wallie, my dear  lad, good-bye. I'm not afraid to die. My legs are long--they hang  down--the first bear that comes and I don't hit him, off goes my foot.  When he takes it I shall give you my gun and go. You may yet be saved;  but tell, oh, tell Mary Ann that I thought of her, that I prayed for  her.'    \"'Good-bye, old fellow,' said he.    \"'God bless you,' said I.    \"By this time the bears were sitting in a circle all around the tree.  Yes,\" said Bonaparte impressively, fixing his eyes on the German, \"a  regular, exact, circle. The marks of their tails were left in the snow,  and I measured it afterward; a drawing-master couldn't have done it  better. It was that saved me. If they'd rushed on me at once, poor old  Bon would never have been here to tell this story. But they came on,  sir, systematically, one by one. All the rest sat on their tails and  waited. The first fellow came up, and I shot him; the second fellow--I  shot him; the third--I shot him. At last the tenth came; he was the  biggest of all--the leader, you may say.    \"'Wall,' I said, 'give me your hand. My fingers are stiff with the cold;  there is only one bullet left. I shall miss him. While he is eating me  you get down and take your gun; and live, dear friend, live to remember  the man who gave his life for you!' By that time the bear was at me. I  felt his paw on my trousers.    \"'Oh, Bonnie! Bonnie!' said the Duke of Wellington's nephew. But I just  took my gun and put the muzzle to the bear's ear--over he fell--dead!\"    Bonaparte Blenkins waited to observe what effect his story had made.  Then he took out a dirty white handkerchief and stroked his forehead,  and more especially his eyes.    \"It always affects me to relate that adventure,\" he remarked, returning  the handkerchief to his pocket. \"Ingratitude--base, vile ingratitude--is  recalled by it! That man, that man, who but for me would have perished  in the pathless wilds of Russia, that man in the hour of my adversity  forsook me.\" The German looked up. \"Yes,\" said Bonaparte, \"I had money,  I had lands; I said to my wife: 'There is Africa, a struggling country;  they want capital; they want men of talent; they want men of ability to  open up that land. Let us go.'    \"I bought eight thousand pounds' worth of machinery--winnowing, plowing,  reaping machines; I loaded a ship with them.

Tuesday you were impatient that you had  not received a reply. Wednesday you were almost in tears, though, had  you only stopped to think you would have known that it takes two days  for a letter to get to your grandmother, she lives so far away. Thursday  the answer came. \"I am eager for vacation time to come so that you, my  dear grandchild, may be here with me.\"    I have here an unusual book. It is a book of letters. All the letters  were written by a big man, a father, to little children, his children.  The man who wrote them was Theodore Roosevelt. What fortunate children  were his! Not many fathers take time to write to their children as did  our great president. Oh, for more fathers like Roosevelt! Oh, for  appreciative children, who will not only gladly receive, but cheerfully  write, letters of love!    MEMORY VERSE, _I John_ 2: 12        \"I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from      the beginning. I write unto you, little children, because ye have      known the Father.\"    MEMORY HYMN [544]        _\"I love to tell the story.\"_          A UNIQUE PSALM      I want to tell you about a unique Psalm. Which Psalm is it? It is the  119th.    The 119th Psalm is unique because of its length. It is the longest of  the Psalms. It has one hundred and seventy-six verses.    It is unique because of its arrangement. It is divided into twenty-two  equal parts. Each part contains eight verses.    Again, the 119th Psalm is an acrostic, or an alphabetical Psalm. It is  built around the Hebrew alphabet. Each of the twenty-two portions begins  with one of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.    The Psalm is unique because of its content. It is given over entirely to  a consideration of the law and commandments of God. Indeed, if you will  read the Psalm, you will find that every verse says something about the  precepts, or the statutes, or the commandments, or the word of God.    The 119th Psalm contains some of the verses with which we are most  familiar. \"Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking  heed thereto according to thy word.\" \"Open thou mine eyes, that I may  behold wondrous things out of thy law.\" \"Thy word is a lamp unto my  feet, and a light unto my path.\"    The Psalm reaches its highest point, and finds its fullest expression in  the 94th verse, three words, \"I am thine.\"    Young people, I want you to read this 119th Psalm, and when you come to  the 94th verse I want you to stop and say over very earnestly, very  prayerfully, \"I am thine.\" And may you be His for all time is my prayer.    MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 119: 94    \"I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.\"    MEMORY HYMN [342]        _\"Lord, I am thine, entirely thine.\"_          THE FATHER'S CARE      I have here a nut. It is a pecan. It grows in our southern states. It is  a well formed nut with a hard shell. This nut I have is cracked. I open  it and I notice just inside a thin, brown coating that covers the meat.  I touch this coating to my lips. It is bitter and causes me to pucker my  lips. This is the Creator's blessed provision for the protection of the  nut in its growing stage. The bitter coating keeps insects and pests  away.    On my way to church this morning I looked up and saw a long piece of  yarn flying across the street at a rapid rate. I wondered what could  cause that. Then at the front end of the yarn I saw a bird. The bird  flew to the gable of a big house. There, in a protected corner, she was  making her nest. The yarn was to be woven into her new spring house. So  God gives instinct to birds and all his creatures as a mark of his  loving care.    The most delicate, sensitive portion of your body is the eye. When I  consider how tender and open to harm the eye is I wonder that so many  of us go through life with our eyes unhurt. But God has provided a  sleepless protection for our eyes. There is a guard, always on duty.  Whenever danger comes near, that guard, our eyelid, closes and  effectively wards off impending trouble.    We started with the lowest form of life, an inanimate nut. Now we come  to the highest, the soul of man. For in each one of you there is  something eternal, something akin to God himself. The name we give that  eternal spirit is the soul. For the protection of our soul God gives us  faith, a sense of right and wrong, conscience, the still small voice. He  surrounds us with Christian homes, the Church, helpful fellowship, the  means of grace. All these things are a protection for the soul.    MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew_ 6: 28, 29    \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither  do they spin; and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory  was not arrayed like one of these.\"    MEMORY HYMN [517]        _\"While thee I seek, protecting power.\"_          YOKES      A Yoke is a help, not a hindrance. Our first thought is that a yoke is  burdensome. A little study reveals to us the great usefulness of the  yoke.    Have you ever seen a yoke of oxen? What heavy, slow-moving creatures  they are! But they are pullers of heavy loads. These loads could not be  drawn by them were they not yoked together.    Now there are different kinds of yokes, that is, there are many ways of  rendering easier the carrying of heavy loads. For example, there is the  Oriental way. First, there is the manner in which one man will carry a  heavy load. He takes a pole, on each end of the pole hangs a rope. Then  he divides his load, fastening half of his load to either rope. He gets  beneath the pole, which is shaped to fit his shoulder, lifts, and off he  trots as easily and jauntily as can be. Sometimes the load is too heavy  for one man. He then summons a companion. They get a longer, heavier  pole, with a much stouter rope. This time they do not divide the load,  rather they keep it together. They fasten the rope securely about it,  and then tie it about the pole. The men stoop, one at each end of the  heavy pole. They stand up straight, the load is lifted from the ground,  only a few inches perhaps, but enough to clear the ground, then, singing  and laughing, keeping perfect time each with the other, they swing down  the street. It is incredible the heavy loads they carry. I could not  believe my eyes when I looked upon some of them.    Jesus perfectly understood the helpfulness and value of the yoke. He  made it most beautiful in that he told his followers that he would help  them, that he would carry his part of the burden, that he would share  with them the other side of the yoke.    MEMORY VERSE, _Matthew_ 11: 29-30        \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly      in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is      easy and my burden is light.\"    MEMORY HYMN [449]        _\"My times are in thy hand.\"_          GOOD ADVICE      Most of us, men and women as well as girls and boys, do not take kindly  to advice. We very much prefer that people keep their advice to  themselves. There are times, however, when we are compelled to listen to  advice, because of the source. Here is a bit of advice that commands our  attention. It is from the great English novelist, Charles Dickens.    Charles Dickens' youngest boy, Edward, left home when he was sixteen  years of age and went to Australia. His father wrote him a parting  letter, which is worth while for all boys, whether or no they leave  home. In that letter the great Dickens said,    \"I put a New Testament among your books for the very same reasons and  with the very same hopes that made me write an easy account of it for  you when you were a little child. Because it is the best book that ever  was or ever will be in the world. And because it teaches you the best  lessons by which any human creature who tries to be truthful and  faithful to duty can possibly be guided. As your brothers have gone  away, one by one, I have written to each such words as I am now writing  to you and have entreated them all to guide themselves by this book,  putting aside the interpretations and inventions of men. Never abandon  the wholesome practice of saying your own private prayers, night and  morning. I have never abandoned it myself, and I know the comfort of  it.\"    Now that we are done reading this letter it does not sound like advice  at all, does it. It is all so wholesome and sturdy that we feel like  speaking right out loud, \"Thank you, Mr. Dickens, thank you very much.\"    MEMORY VERSE, _Psalm_ 119: 9        \"Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his ways? By taking heed      thereto according to thy word.\"    MEMORY HYMN [205]        _\"Lamp of our feet.\"_          IF I WERE A BOY AGAIN      Chicago University, one of the great schools of America and the world,  received its impetus from the tireless energy and brilliant leadership  of its great President, Dr. Harper. After his death there was found  among his papers a memorandum which read as follows:    \"If I were a boy again I would strive to find out from goods books how  good men lived.    \"If I were a boy again I would study the Bible even more than I did. I  would make it a mental companion. The Bible is a necessity for every  boy.    \"If I were a boy again I would more and more cultivate the company of  those older whose graces of person and mind would help me on in my good  work. I would always seek good company.    \"If I were a boy again I would study the life and character of our  Saviour, persistently, that I might become more and more like unto him.\"    Now President Harper was a great, wise and good man. If he felt that he  would do certain things were he a boy again, surely the rest of us  could improve upon our boyhood years had we the chance.    If I were a boy again I would be more attentive to Church and Sunday  School and the things that were taught me there. If I were a boy again I  would get my day school lessons with greater care. "]]]
