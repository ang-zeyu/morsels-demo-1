Here was a chance to get even with Peter for  watching him change his suit. \"If you'll turn your back to me and look  straight down the Crooked Little Path for five minutes, I'll disappear,\"  said he. \"More than that, I give you my word of honor that I will not hop  three feet from where I am sitting.\"    \"All right,\" replied Peter promptly, turning his back to Old Mr. Toad.  \"I'll look down the Crooked Little Path for five minutes and promise not to  peek.\"    So Peter sat and gazed straight down the Crooked Little Path. It was a  great temptation to roll his eyes back and peep behind him, but he had  given his word that he wouldn't, and he didn't. When he thought the five  minutes were up, he turned around. Old Mr. Toad was nowhere to be seen.  Peter looked hastily this way and that way, but there was not a sign of Old  Mr. Toad. He had disappeared as completely as if he never had been there.          XV      OLD MR. TOAD GIVES PETER A SCARE      If you play pranks on other folks      You may be sure that they    Will take the first chance that they get      A joke on you to play.    Old Mr. Toad was getting even with Peter for laughing at him. While Peter's  back had been turned, Old Mr. Toad had disappeared.    It was too much for Peter. Look as he would, he couldn't see so much as a  chip under which Old Mr. Toad might have hidden, excepting the old board,  and Old Mr. Toad had given his word of honor that he wouldn't hide under  that. Nevertheless, Peter hopped over to it and turned it over again,  because he couldn't think of any other place to look. Of course, Old Mr.  Toad wasn't there. Of course not. He had given his word that he wouldn't  hide there, and he always lives up to his word. Peter should have known  better than to have looked there.    Old Mr. Toad had also said that he would not go three feet from the spot  where he was sitting at the time, so Peter should have known better than to  have raced up the Crooked Little Path as he did. But if Old Mr. Toad had  nothing to hide under, of course he must have hopped away, reasoned Peter.  He couldn't hop far in five minutes, that was sure, and so Peter ran this  way and that way a great deal farther than it would have been possible for  Old Mr. Toad to have gone. But it was a wholly useless search, and  presently Peter returned and sat down on the very spot where he had last  seen Old Mr. Toad. Peter never had felt more foolish in all his life. He  began to think that Old Mr. Toad must be bewitched and had some strange  power of making himself invisible.    For a long time Peter sat perfectly still, trying to puzzle out how Old Mr.  Toad had disappeared, but the more he puzzled over it, the more impossible  it seemed. And yet Old Mr. Toad had disappeared. Suddenly Peter gave a  frightened scream and jumped higher than he ever had jumped before in all  his life. A voice, the voice of Old Mr. Toad himself, had said, \"Well, now  are you satisfied?\" _And that voice had come from right under Peter!_ Do  you wonder that he was frightened? When he turned to look, there sat Old  Mr. Toad right where he himself had been sitting a moment before. Peter  rubbed his eyes and stared very foolishly.    \"Wh-wh-where did you come from?\" he stammered at last.    Old Mr. Toad grinned. \"I'll show you,\" said he. And right while Peter was  looking at him, he began to sink down into the ground until only the top of  his head could be seen. Then that disappeared. Old Mr. Toad had gone down,  and the sand had fallen right back over him. Peter just had to rub his eyes  again. He had to! Then, to make sure, he began to dig away the sand where  Old Mr. Toad had been sitting. In a minute he felt Old Mr. Toad, who at  once came out again.    Old Mr. Toad's beautiful eyes twinkled more than ever. \"I guess we are even  now, Peter,\" said he.    Peter nodded. \"More than that, Mr. Toad. I think you have a little the best  of it,\" he replied. \"Now won't you tell me how you did it?\"    Old Mr. Toad held up one of his stout hind feet, and on it was a kind of  spur. \"There's another just like that on the other foot,\" said he, \"and I  use them to dig with. You go into a hole headfirst, but I go in the other  way. I make my hole in soft earth and back into it at the same time, this  way.\" He began to work his stout hind feet, and as he kicked the earth out,  he backed in at the same time. When he was deep enough, the earth just fell  back over him, for you see it was very loose and not packed down at all.  When he once more reappeared, Peter thanked him. Then he asked one more  question.    \"Is that the way you go into winter quarters?\"    Old Mr. Toad nodded. \"And it's the way I escape from my enemies.\"          XVI      JIMMY SKUNK IS SURPRISED    Jimmy Skunk ambled along the Crooked Little Path down the hill. He didn't  hurry because Jimmy doesn't believe in hurrying. The only time he ever  hurries is when he sees a fat beetle trying to get out of sight. Then Jimmy  _does_ hurry. But just now he didn't see any fat beetles, although he was  looking for them. So he just ambled along as if he had all the time in the  world, as indeed he had. He was feeling very good-natured, was Jimmy Skunk.  And why shouldn't he? There was everything to make him feel good-natured.  Summer had arrived to stay. On every side he heard glad voices. Bumble the  Bee was humming a song. Best of all, Jimmy had found three beetles that  very morning, and he knew that there were more if he could find them. So  why shouldn't he feel good?    Jimmy had laughed at Peter Rabbit for being so anxious for Summer to  arrive, but he was just as glad as Peter that she had come, although he  wouldn't have said so for the world. His sharp little eyes twinkled as he  ambled along, and there wasn't much that they missed. As he walked he  talked, quite to himself of course, because there was nobody near to hear,  and this is what he was saying:      \"Beetle, beetle, smooth and smug,    You are nothing but a bug.    Bugs were made for Skunks to eat,    So come out from your retreat.    \"Hello! There's a nice big piece of bark over there that looks as if it  ought to have a dozen fat beetles under it. It's great fun to pull over  pieces of bark and see fat beetles run all ways at once. I'll just have to  see what is under that piece.\"    Jimmy tiptoed softly over to the big piece of bark, and then as he made  ready to turn it over, he began again that foolish little verse.      \"Beetle, beetle, smooth and smug,    You are nothing but a bug.\"    As he said the last word, he suddenly pulled the piece of bark over.    \"Who's a bug?\" asked a funny voice, and it sounded rather cross. Jimmy  Skunk nearly tumbled over backward in surprise, and for a minute he  couldn't find his tongue. There, instead of the fat beetles he had been so  sure of, sat Old Mr. Toad, and he didn't look at all pleased.    \"Who's a bug?\" he repeated.    Instead of answering, Jimmy Skunk began to laugh. \"Who's a bug?\" demanded  Old Mr. Toad, more crossly than before.    \"There isn't any bug, Mr. Toad, and I beg your pardon,\" replied Jimmy,  remembering his politeness. \"I just thought there was. You see, I didn't  know you were under that piece of bark. I hope you will excuse me, Mr.  Toad. Have you seen any fat beetles this morning?\"    \"No,\" said Old Mr. Toad grumpily, and yawned and rubbed his eyes.    \"Why,\" exclaimed Jimmy Skunk, \"I believe you have just waked up!\"    \"What if I have?\" demanded Old Mr. Toad.    \"Oh, nothing, nothing at all, Mr. Toad,\" replied Jimmy Skunk, \"only you are  the second one I've met this morning who had just waked up.\"    \"Who was the other?\" asked Old Mr. Toad.    \"Mr. Blacksnake,\" replied Jimmy. \"He inquired for you.\"    Old Mr. Toad turned quite pale. \"I--I think I'll be moving along,\" said he.          XVII      OLD MR. TOAD'S MISTAKE    If is a very little word to look at, but the biggest word you have ever  seen doesn't begin to have so much meaning as little \"if.\" _If_ Jimmy Skunk  hadn't ambled down the Crooked Little Path just when he did; _if_ he hadn't  been looking for fat beetles; _if_ he hadn't seen that big piece of bark at  one side and decided to pull it over; _if_ it hadn't been for all these  \"ifs,\" why Old Mr. Toad wouldn't have made the mistake he did, and you  wouldn't have had this story. But Jimmy Skunk _did_ amble down the Crooked  Little Path, he _did_ look for beetles, and he _did_ pull over that big  piece of bark. And when he had pulled it over, he found Old Mr. Toad there.    Old Mr. Toad had crept under that piece of bark because he wanted to take a  nap. But when Jimmy Skunk told him that he had seen Mr. Blacksnake that  very morning, and that Mr. Blacksnake had asked after Old Mr. Toad, the  very last bit of sleepiness left Old Mr. Toad. Yes, Sir, he was wide awake  right away. You see, he knew right away why Mr. Blacksnake had asked after  him. He knew that Mr. Blacksnake has a fondness for Toads. He turned quite  pale when he heard that Mr. Blacksnake had asked after him, and right then  he made his mistake. He was in such a hurry to get away from that  neighborhood that he forgot to ask Jimmy Skunk just where he had seen Mr.  Blacksnake. He hardly waited long enough to say good-b"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12648"],[0,"The Beautiful Necessity (#6)"],[1,"is this distinction clearly  and consistently maintained, and of these Tours forms perhaps the most  remarkable example, for in its flamboyant facade, over and above the  difference in actual breadth and apparent sturdiness of the two towers  (the south being the more slender and delicate), there is a clearly  marked distinction in the character of the ornamentation, that of the  north tower being more salient, angular, radial--more masculine in  point of fact (Illustration 17). In Notre Dame, the cathedral of  Paris, as in the cathedral of Tours, the north tower is perceptibly  broader than the south. The only other important difference appears to  be in the angular label-mould above the north entrance: whatever may  have been its original function or significance, it serves to define  the tower sexually, so to speak, as effectively as does the beard on  a man's face. In Amiens the north tower is taller than the south, and  more massive in its upper stages. The only traceable indication of  sex in the ornamentation occurs in the spandrels at the sides of the  entrance arches: those of the north tower containing single circles,  and those of the south tower containing two in one. This difference,  small as it may seem, is significant, for in Europe during the Middle  Ages, just as anciently in Egypt and again in Greece--in fact wherever  and whenever the Secret Doctrine was known--sex was attributed to  numbers, odd numbers being conceived of as masculine, and even, as  feminine. Two, the first feminine number, thus became a symbol of  femininity, accepted as such so universally at the time the cathedrals  were built, that two strokes of a bell announced the death of a woman,  three, the death of a man.    [Illustration 15: FRIEZE OF THE FARNESE PALACE; ROMAN CONSOLE. VATICAN  MUSEUM; FRIEZE IN THE EMPIRE STYLE BY PERCIER AND FONTAINE.  FRIEZE FROM THE TEMPLE OF VESTA AT TIVOLI. (ROMAN); ROMAN DORIC  FRIEZE--VIGNOLE]    [Illustration 16]    [Illustration 17]    The vital, organic quality so conspicuous in the best Gothic  architecture has been attributed to the fact that necessity determined  its characteristic forms. Professor Goodyear has demonstrated that  it may be due also in part to certain subtle vertical leans and  horizontal bends; and to nicely calculated variations from strict  uniformity, which find their analogue in nature, where structure is  seldom rigidly geometrical. The author hazards the theory that still  another reason why a Gothic cathedral seems so living a thing is  because it abounds in contrasts between what, for lack of more  descriptive adjectives, he is forced to call masculine and feminine  forms.    [Illustration 18]    [Illustration 19]    Ruskin says, in _Stones of Venice_, \"All good Gothic is nothing more  than the development, in various ways, and on every conceivable scale,  of the group formed by the pointed arch for the bearing line below,  and the gable for the protecting line above, and from the huge, gray,  shaly slope of the cathedral roof, with its elastic pointed vaults  beneath, to the crown-like points that enrich the smallest niche of  its doorway, one law and one expression will be found in all. The  modes of support and of decoration are infinitely various, but the  real character of the building, in all good Gothic, depends on the  single lines of the gable over the pointed arch endlessly rearranged  and repeated.\" These two, an angular and a curved form, like the  everywhere recurring column and lintel of classic architecture,  are but presentments of Yo and In (Illustration 18). Every Gothic  traceried window, with straight and vertical mullions in the  rectangle, losing themselves in the intricate foliations of the arch,  celebrates the marriage of this ever diverse pair. The circle and the  triangle are the In and Yo of Gothic tracery, its Eve and Adam, as  it were, for from their union springs that progeny of trefoil,  quatrefoil, cinquefoil, of shapes flowing like water, and shapes  darting like flame, which makes such visible music to the entranced  ear.    [Illustration 20: SAN GIMIGNANO S. JACOPO.]    By seeking to discover In and Yo in their myriad manifestations, by  learning to discriminate between them, and by attempting to express  their characteristic qualities in new forms of beauty--from  the disposition of a facade to the shaping of a moulding--the  architectural designer will charge his work with that esoteric  significance, that excess of beauty, by which architecture rises  to the dignity of a \"fine\" art (Illustrations 19, 20). In so doing,  however, he should never forget, and the layman also should ever  remember, that the supreme architectural excellence is fitness,  appropriateness, the perfect adaptation of means to ends, and the  adequate expression of both means and ends. These two aims, the one  abstract and universal, the other concrete and individual, can always  be combined, just as in every human countenance are combined a type,  which is universal, and a character, which is individual.          III    CHANGELESS CHANGE    TRINITY, CONSONANCE, DIVERSITY IN MONOTONY, BALANCE, RHYTHMIC CHANGE,  RADIATION      The preceding essay was devoted for the most part to that \"inevitable  duality\" which finds concrete expression in countless pairs of  opposites, such as day and night, fire and water, man and woman;  in the art of music by two chords, one of suspense and the other of  fulfilment; in speech by vowel and consonant sounds, epitomized in _a_  and in _m_; in painting by warm colors and cold, epitomized in red  and blue; in architecture by the vertical column and the horizontal  lintel, by void and solid--and so on.      TRINITY    This concept should now be modified by another, namely, that in every  duality a third is latent; that two implies three, for each sex so  to speak is in process of becoming the other, and this alternation  engenders and is accomplished by means of a third term or neuter,  which is like neither of the original two but partakes of the nature  of them both, just as a child may resemble both its parents. Twilight  comes between day and night; earth is the child of fire and water;  in music, besides the chord of longing and striving, and the chord of  rest and satisfaction (the dominant seventh and the tonic), there is  a third or resolving chord in which the two are reconciled. In the  sacred syllable Om (_Aum_), which epitomizes all speech, the _u_ sound  effects a transition between the _a_ sound and the _m_; among the  so-called primary colors yellow comes between red and blue; and in  architecture the arch, which is both weight and support, which is  neither vertical nor horizontal, may be considered the neuter of the  group of which the column and the lintel are respectively masculine  and feminine. \"These are the three,\" says Mr. Louis Sullivan, \"the  only three letters from which has been expanded the architectural art,  as a great and superb language wherewith man has expressed, through  the generations, the changing drift of his thoughts.\"    [Illustration 21: THE LAW OF TRINITY. A ROMAN IONIC ARCADE, BY  VIGNOLE.--THE COLUMN, THE ENTABLATURE, AND THE ARCH CORRESPOND TO LINES  VERTICAL, HORIZONTAL AND CURVED.]    It would be supererogatory to dwell at any length on this \"trinity  of manifestation\" as the concrete expression of that unmanifest and  mystical trinity, that _three-in-one_ which under various names occurs  in every world-religion, where, defying definition, it was wont  to find expression symbolically in some combination of vertical,  horizontal and curved lines. The anstated cross of the Egyptians  is such a symbol, the Buddhist wheel, and the fylfot or swastika  inscribed within a circle, also those numerous Christian symbols  combining the circle and the cross. Such ideographs have spelled  profound meaning to the thinkers of past ages. We of to-day are not  given to discovering anything wonderful in three strokes of a pen,  but every artist in the weaving of his pattern must needs employ these  mystic symbols in one form or another, and if he employs them with  a full sense of their hidden meaning his work will be apt to gain  in originality and beauty--for originality is a new and personal  perception of beauty, and beauty is the name we give to truth we  cannot understand.    In architecture, this trinity of vertical, horizontal and curved  lines finds admirable illustration in the application of columns and  entablature to an arch and impost construction, so common in Roman and  Renaissance work. This is a redundancy, and finds no justification in  reason, because the weight is sustained by the arch, and the \"order\"  is an appendage merely; yet the combination, illogical as it is,  satisfies the sense of beauty because the arch effects a transition  between the columns and the entablature, and completes the trinity  of vertical, horizontal and curved lines (Illustration 21). In the  entrances to many of the Gothic cathedrals and churches the same  elements are better because more logically disposed. Here the  horizontal lintel and its vertical supports are not decorative merely,  but really perform their proper functions, while the arch, too, has  a raison d'etre in that it serves to relieve the lintel of the  superincumbent weight of masonry. The same arrangement sometimes  occurs in classic architecture also, as when an opening spanned by a  single arch is subdivided by means of an order (Illustration 22).    Three is pre-eminently the number of architecture, because it is the  number of space, which for us is three-dimensional, and of all the  arts architecture is most concerned with the expression of spatial  relations. The division of a composition into three related parts is  so universal that it would seem to be the result of an instinctive  action of the human mind. The twin pylons of an Egyptian temple with  its entrance between, for a third division, has its"]]]
