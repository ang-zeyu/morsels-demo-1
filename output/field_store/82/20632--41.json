In this predicament  my tailor's memorandum was any thing but satisfactory. I wrote  accordingly to entreat his forbearance for six months longer, and,  as I received no reply, concluded that all was satisfactorily  arranged. Unluckily, however, as I was strolling, about a month  afterwards, along the Strand, I chanced to stumble up against him.  The shock seemed equally unexpected on both sides; but my tailor (as  being a dun) was the first to recover self-possession; and, with a  long preliminary hem!--a mute, but expressive compound of  remonstrance, apology, and resolution--opened his fire as follows:--    \"I believe, sir, your name is D----?\"    \"I believe it is, sir.\"    \"Well, then, Mr. D----, touching that little account between us, I  have to request, sir, that--\"    \"Very good; nothing can be more reasonable; wait the appointed time,  and you shall have all.\"    This answer served, in some degree, to appease him; no, not exactly  to appease him, because that would imply previous excitement, and he  was invariably imperturbable in manner; it satisfied him, however,  for the present, and he forthwith walked away, casting on me that  equivocal sort of look with which Ajax turned from Ulysses, or Dido  from AEneas, in the Shades.    A lapse of a few weeks ensued, during which I heard nothing further  from my persecutor; when, one dark November evening--one of those  peculiarly English evenings, full of fog and gloom, when the  half-frozen sleet, joined in its descent by gutters from the  house-tops, comes driving full in your face, blinding you to all  external objects--on one of these blessed evenings, on my road to  Camden Town, I chanced to miss my way, and was compelled,  notwithstanding a certain shyness towards strangers, to ask my  direction of the first respectable person I should meet. Many passed  me by, but none sufficiently prepossessing; when, on turning down  some nameless street that leads to Tottenham Court-road, I chanced  to come behind a staid-looking gentleman, accoutred in a dark brown  coat, with an umbrella--the cotton of which had shrunk half-way up  the whalebone--held obliquely over his head. Hastily stepping up to  him, \"Pray, sir,\" said I, \"could you be kind enough to direct me to  ---- place, Camden Town?\"    The unknown, thus addressed, made the slightest possible inclination  towards me; and then, in an under tone, \"I believe, sir, your name  is D----?\"    I paused; a vague sort of recollection came over me. Could it  be?--no, surely not! And yet the voice--the manner--the--the--    My suspicions were soon converted into certainty, when the stranger,  with his own peculiar expression, quietly broke forth a second time  with, \"Touching that little account--\"    This was enough; it was more than enough--it was vexatiously  superfluous. To be dunned for a debt, at the very time when the  nerves could best dispense with the application; to be recalled back  to the vulgarities of existence, at that precise moment when the  imagination was most abstracted from all commercial common-places;  to be stopped by a tailor, (and such a tailor!) when the mind was  dreaming of a mistress--the bare idea was intolerable! So I thought;  and, without further explanation, hurried precipitately from the  spot, nor ever once paused till far removed from the husky tones of  that sepulchral voice which had once before so highly excited my  annoyance.    [The narrater then visits one of Mr. Champagne Wright's masquerades,  where he falls in love with a _fresco_ nun. He receives a  billet.]      I stood like one bewildered; but, soon recovering my self-possession,  moved direct towards the chandelier, with a view to peruse an  epistle expressive of woman's fondest love. As with glistening  eyes I proceeded to tear open the billet, a flood of transporting  thoughts swept over me. I fancied that I was on the eve of  acquaintance with ----; but, judge my astonishment, when, instead  of the expected document, the key to such transporting bliss, I  read, engraved in large German text, on a dirty square card,  embossed at the edge with flowers, the revolting, business-like  address of        Mr. Thomas M----e,         Tailor,    116, High Holborn.      It so happened that, the next day, I dined with C----. Of course the  masquerade, and with that the tailor, were the first topics of  conversation between us. Both allowed that the circumstances  respecting his late appearance were uncommon; but there, with my  friend, the matter ended: with me it was a more enduring subject for  reflection; and, after a night kept up till a late hour over a bowl  of C----'s most faultless punch, I set out, moody and apprehensive,  to my humble abode. By this time it was past three o'clock; the  streets were nearly all deserted.--While thoughtfully plodding  onwards, a sudden noise from the Holborn end of Drury-lane took my  attention; it evidently proceeded from a row--a systematic,  scientific row; and, indeed, as I drew near the scene of action, I  could distinctly hear the watchman's oaths blending in deep chorus  with the treble of some dozen or two valorous exquisites.    I felt certain rising abstract ideas of pugnacity, and conceived  myself bound to indulge them on the first head and shoulders I  should meet. This spirit brought me at once into the thick of the  fight, and, before I was well aware of my proximity, I found myself  fast anchored alongside a veteran watchman, with a pigtail and half  a nose. The conflict now commenced in good earnest; there were few  or no attempts at favouritism; the blows of one friend told equally  well on the scull of another; watchman assaulted watchman with a  zeal respectable for its sincerity; and, indeed, had these last been  any thing more than a bundle of old coats and oaths, they would most  undoubtedly have drubbed each other into a better world. After a  lively and well-sustained affair of about twenty minutes, a squadron  of auxiliary watchmen arrived, and, with some difficulty, deposited  us all safely in the watch-house. And here the very first person  that met my gaze--seated, with due regard to dignity, in an  arm-chair, a pair of spectacles on his nose, a glass of  brandy-and-water by his side, and a newspaper, redolent of cheese,  before him--was the constable of the night--the nun of the  masquerade--the Mysterious Tailor of High Holborn! The wretch's eyes  gleamed with a savage but subdued joy at the recognition; a low,  chuckling laugh escaped him; while his dull countenance, made doubly  revolting by the dim light of the watch-house, fell, fixed and  scowling, upon me, as he pointed towards the spot where I  stood.--\"Dobson,\" he exclaimed; and, at the word, forth stepped the  owner of this melodious appellative, with \"this here man.\"--Luckily,  before he could finish his charge, a five-shilling-piece, which I  thrust into his unsuspecting palm, created a diversion among the  watchmen in my behalf; under favour of which, while my arch enemy  was adjusting his books, I contrived to escape from his detested  presence.    It happened that about a month subsequent to this last rencontre,  circumstances led me to Bologne, whither I arrived, late in the  evening, by the steamboat. On being directed to the best English  hotel in that truly social Anglo-Gallic little town, I chanced to  find in the coffee-room an old crony, whom I had known years since  at Cambridge, and who had just arrived from Switzerland, on a  speculation connected with some vineyards.    I had a thousand questions to ask my friend, a thousand memories to  disinter from their graves in my heart, past follies to re-enact,  past scenes to re-people. We began with our school-days, pursued the  subject to Cambridge, carried it back again to Reading, and thence  traced it through all its windings, now in sunshine, now in gloom,  till the canvass of our recollection was fairly filled with  portraits. In this way, time, unperceived, slipped on; noon deepened  into evening, evening blackened into midnight, yet nothing but our  wine was exhausted.    At last, after a long evening spent in the freest and most social  converse, my friend quitted the coffee-room, while I--imitating, as  I went, the circumlocutory windings of the Meander--proceeded to my  allotted chamber. Unfortunately, on reaching the head of the first  staircase, where two opposite doors presented themselves, I opened  (as a matter of course) the wrong one, which led me into a spacious  apartment, in which were placed two fat, full-grown beds. My lantern  happening to go out at the moment, I was compelled to forego  all further scrutiny, so without more ado, flung off my clothes,  and dived, at one dexterous plunge, right into the centre  of the nearest vacant bed. In an instant I was fast asleep;  my imagination, oppressed with the day's events, had become  fairly exhausted, and I now lay chained down in that heavy,  dreamless sleep, which none but fatigued travellers can appreciate.  Towards daybreak, I was roused by a peculiar long-drawn snore,  proceeding from the next bed. The music, though deep, was gusty,  vulgar, and ludicrous, like a west wind whistling through a  wash-house. I should know it among a thousand snores. At first I  took no notice of this diversified sternutation, but as it deepened  every moment in energy, terminating in something like a groan, I was  compelled to pay it the homage of my admiration and astonishment.  This attention, however, soon flagged; in a few minutes I was a  second time asleep, nor did I again awake till the morning was far  advanced. At this eventful juncture, while casting my eyes round the  room with all the voluptuous indolence of a jaded traveller, they  suddenly chanced to fall on a gaunt, spectral figure, undressed,  unwashed, unshaved, decked out in a red worsted night-cap, its left  cheek"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12888"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 05 (#6)"],[1,"for communication is unquestionably that in which man feels  that he is originally passive, namely, his observations and emotions.  He is here impelled by the eager wish to know whether the power which  has produced them in him be not something foreign and unworthy. Hence  we see man employed, from his very childhood, in communicating those  observations and emotions; the conceptions of his understanding,  concerning whose origin there can be no doubt, he allows to rest in  his own mind, and still more easily he determines to refrain from  the expression of his judgments; but whatever acts upon his senses,  whatever awakens his feelings, of that he desires to obtain witnesses,  with regard to that he longs for those who will sympathize with him.  How should he keep to himself those very operations of the world upon  his soul which are the most universal and comprehensive, which appear  to him as of the most stupendous and resistless magnitude? How should  he be willing to lock up within his own bosom those very emotions  which impel him with the greatest power beyond himself, and in the  indulgence of which he becomes conscious that he can never understand  his own nature from himself alone? It will rather be his first  endeavor, whenever a religious view gains clearness in his eye, or a  pious feeling penetrates his soul, to direct the attention of others  to the same object, and, as far as possible, to communicate to their  hearts the elevated impulses of his own.    If, then, the religious man is urged by his nature to speak, it is the  same nature which secures to him the certainty of hearers. There is no  element of his being with which, at the same time, there is implanted  in man such a lively feeling of his total inability to exhaust it by  himself alone, as with that of religion. A sense of religion has no  sooner dawned upon him, than he feels the infinity of its nature and  the limitation of his own; he is conscious of embracing but a small  portion of it; and that which he cannot immediately reach he wishes  to perceive, as far as he can, from the representations of others who  have experienced it themselves, and to enjoy it with them. Hence,  he is anxious to observe every manifestation of it; and, seeking  to supply his own deficiencies, he watches for every tone which  he recognizes as proceeding from it. In this manner, mutual  communications are instituted; in this manner, every one feels equally  the need both of speaking and hearing.    But the imparting of religion is not to be sought in books, like  that of intellectual conceptions and scientific knowledge. The pure  impression of the original product is too far destroyed in this  medium, which, in the same way that dark-colored objects absorb the  greatest proportion of the rays of light, swallows up everything  belonging to the pious emotions of the heart, which cannot be embraced  in the insufficient symbols from which it is intended again to  proceed. Nay, in the written communications of religious feeling,  everything needs a double and triple representation; for that which  originally represented, must be represented in its turn; and yet  the effect on the whole man, in its complete unity, can only be  imperfectly set forth by continued and varied reflections. It is only  when religion is driven out from the society of the living, that it  must conceal its manifold life under the dead letter.    Neither can this intercourse of heart with heart, on the deepest  feelings of humanity, be carried on in common conversation. Many  persons, who are filled with zeal for the interests of religion, have  brought it as a reproach against the manners of our age that,  while all other important subjects are so freely discussed in the  intercourse of society, so little should be said concerning God  and divine things. I would defend ourselves against this charge  by maintaining that this circumstance, at least, does not indicate  contempt or indifference toward religion, but a happy and very correct  instinct. In the presence of joy and merriment, where earnestness  itself must yield to raillery and wit, there can be no place for  that which should be always surrounded with holy veneration and awe.  Religious views, pious emotions, and serious considerations with  regard to them--these we cannot throw out to one another in such small  crumbs as the topics of a light conversation; and when the discourse  turns upon sacred subjects, it would rather be a crime than a virtue  to have an answer ready for every question, and a rejoinder for every  remark. Hence, the religious sentiment retires from such circles  as are too wide for it, to the more confidential intercourse of  friendship, and to the mutual communications of love, where the eye  and the countenance are more expressive than words, and where even a  holy silence is understood. But it is impossible for divine things  to be treated in the usual manner of society, where the conversation  consists in striking flashes of thought, gaily and rapidly alternating  with one another; a more elevated style is demanded for the  communication of religion, and a different kind of society, which is  devoted to this purpose, must hence be formed. It is becoming, indeed,  to apply the whole richness and magnificence of human discourse to the  loftiest subject which language can reach--not as if there were any  adornment, with which religion could not dispense, but because it  would show a frivolous and unholy disposition in its heralds if they  did not bring together the most copious resources within their power  and consecrate them all to religion, so that they might thus perhaps  exhibit it in its appropriate greatness and dignity. Hence it is  impossible, without the aid of poetry, to give utterance to the  religious sentiment in any other than an oratorical manner, with all  the skill and energy of language, and freely using, in addition,  the service of all the arts which can contribute to flowing and  impassioned discourse. He, therefore, whose heart is overflowing with  religion, can open his mouth only before an auditory, where that which  is presented, with such a wealth of preparation, can produce the most  extended and manifold effects.    Would that I could present before you an image of the rich and  luxurious life in this city of God, when its inhabitants come together  each in the fulness of his own inspiration, which is ready to stream  forth without constraint, but, at the same time, each is filled with a  holy desire to receive and to appropriate to himself everything which  others wish to bring before him. If one comes forward before the rest,  it is not because he is entitled to this distinction, in virtue of an  office or of a previous agreement, nor because pride and conceitedness  have given him presumption; it is rather a free impulse of the spirit,  a sense of the most heartfelt unity of each with all, a consciousness  of entire equality, a mutual renunciation of all First and Last, of  all the arrangements of earthly order. He comes forward in order to  communicate to others, as an object of sympathizing contemplation, the  deepest feelings of his soul while under the influence of God; to lead  them to the domain of religion in which he breathes his native air;  and to infect them with the contagion of his own holy emotions. He  speaks forth the Divine which stirs his bosom, and in holy silence the  assembly follows the inspiration of his words. Whether he unveils a  secret mystery, or with prophetic confidence connects the future with  the present; whether he strengthens old impressions by new examples,  or is led by the lofty visions of his burning imagination into other  regions of the world and into another order of things, the practised  sense of his audience everywhere accompanies his own; and when he  returns into himself from his wanderings through the kingdom of  God, his own heart and that of each of his hearers are the common  dwelling-place of the same emotion.    If, now, the agreement of his sentiments with that which they feel be  announced to him, whether loudly or low, then are holy mysteries--not  merely significant emblems, but, justly regarded, natural indications  of a peculiar consciousness and peculiar feelings--invented and  celebrated, a higher choir, as it were, which in its own lofty  language answers to the appealing voice. But not only, so to speak;  for as such a discourse is music without tune or measure, so there  is also a music among the Holy, which may be called discourse without  words, the most distinct and expressive utterance of the inward man.  The Muse of Harmony, whose intimate relation with religion, although  it has been for a long time spoken of and described, is yet recognized  only by few, has always presented upon her altars the most perfect  and magnificent productions of her selectest scholars in honor of  religion. It is in sacred hymns and choirs, with which the words  of the poet are connected only by slight and airy bands, that those  feelings are breathed forth which precise language is unable to  contain; and thus the tones of thought and emotion alternate with each  other in mutual support, until all is satisfied and filled with the  Holy and the Infinite. Of this character is the influence of religious  men upon one another; such is their natural and eternal union. Do  not take it ill of them that this heavenly bond--the most consummate  product of the social nature of man, but to which it does not  attain until it becomes conscious of its own high and peculiar  significance--that this should be deemed of more value in their sight  than the political union which you esteem so far above everything  else, but which will nowhere ripen to manly beauty, and which,  compared with the former, appears far more constrained than free, far  more transitory than eternal.    But where now, in the description which I have given of"]]]
