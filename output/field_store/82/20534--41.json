[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11029"],[0,"American Hero-Myths: A Study in the Native Religions of the Western Continent (#6)"],[1,"   Let us see whether some of those unconscious tricks of speech to which I  referred in the introductory chapter have not disfigured a true nature  myth. Perhaps those common processes of language, personification and  otosis, duly taken into account, will enable us to restore this narrative  to its original sense.    In the Algonkin tongue the word for Giant Rabbit is _Missabos_, compounded  from _mitchi_ or _missi_, great, large, and _wabos_, a rabbit. But there  is a whole class of related words, referring to widely different  perceptions, which sound very much like _wabos_. They are from a general  root _wab_, which goes to form such words of related signification as  _wabi_, he sees, _waban_, the east, the Orient, _wabish_, white, _bidaban_  (_bid-waban_), the dawn, _waban_, daylight, _wasseia_, the light, and many  others. Here is where we are to look for the real meaning of the name  _Missabos_. It originally meant the Great Light, the Mighty Seer, the  Orient, the Dawn--which you please, as all distinctly refer to the one  original idea, the Bringer of Light and Sight, of knowledge and life. In  time this meaning became obscured, and the idea of the rabbit, whose name  was drawn probably from the same root, as in the northern winters its fur  becomes white, was substituted, and so the myth of light degenerated into  an animal fable.    I believe that a similar analysis will explain the part which the muskrat  plays in the story. She it is who brings up the speck of mud from the  bottom of the primal ocean, and from this speck the world is formed by him  whom we now see was the Lord of the Light and the Day, and subsequently  she becomes the mother of his sons. The word for muskrat in Algonkin is  _wajashk_, the first letter of which often suffers elision, as in _nin  nod-ajashkwe_, I hunt muskrats. But this is almost the word for mud, wet  earth, soil, _ajishki_. There is no reasonable doubt but that here again  otosis and personification came in and gave the form and name of an animal  to the original simple statement.    That statement was that from wet mud dried by the sunlight, the solid  earth was formed; and again, that this damp soil was warmed and fertilized  by the sunlight, so that from it sprang organic life, even man himself,  who in so many mythologies is \"the earth born,\" _homo ab humo, homo  chamaigenes_.[1]    [Footnote 1: Mr. J. Hammond Trumbull has pointed out that in Algonkin the  words for father, _osh_, mother, _okas_, and earth, _ohke_ (Narraganset  dialect), can all be derived, according to the regular rules of Algonkin  grammar, from the same verbal root, signifying \"to come out of, or from.\"  (Note to Roger Williams' _Key into the Language of America_, p. 56). Thus  the earth was, in their language, the parent of the race, and what more  natural than that it should become so in the myth also?]    This, then, is the interpretation I have to offer of the cosmogonical myth  of the Algonkins. Does some one object that it is too refined for those  rude savages, or that it smacks too much of reminiscences of old-world  teachings? My answer is that neither the early travelers who wrote it  down, nor probably the natives who told them, understood its meaning, and  that not until it is here approached by modern methods of analysis, has it  ever been explained. Therefore it is impossible to assign to it other than  an indigenous and spontaneous origin in some remote period of Algonkin  tribal history.    After the darkness of the night, man first learns his whereabouts by the  light kindling in the Orient; wandering, as did the primitive man, through  pathless forests, without a guide, the East became to him the first and  most important of the fixed points in space; by it were located the West,  the North, the South; from it spread the welcome dawn; in it was born the  glorious sun; it was full of promise and of instruction; hence it became  to him the home of the gods of life and light and wisdom.    As the four cardinal points are determined by fixed physical relations,  common to man everywhere, and are closely associated with his daily  motions and well being, they became prominent figures in almost all early  myths, and were personified as divinities. The winds were classified as  coming from them, and in many tongues the names of the cardinal points are  the same as those of the winds that blow from them. The East, however,  has, in regard to the others, a pre-eminence, for it is not merely the  home of the east wind, but of the light and the dawn as well. Hence it  attained a marked preponderance in the myths; it was either the greatest,  wisest and oldest of the four brothers, who, by personification,  represented the cardinal points and the four winds, or else the Light-God  was separated from the quadruplet and appears as a fifth personage  governing the other four, and being, in fact, the supreme ruler of both  the spiritual and human worlds.    Such was the mental processes which took place in the Algonkin mind, and  gave rise to two cycles of myths, the one representing Wabun or Michabo as  one of four brothers, whose names are those of the cardinal points, the  second placing him above them all.    The four brothers are prominent characters in Algonkin legend, and we  shall find that they recur with extraordinary frequency in the mythology  of all American nations. Indeed, I could easily point them out also in the  early religious conceptions of Egypt and India, Greece and China, and many  other old-world lands, but I leave these comparisons to those who wish to  treat of the principles of general mythology.    According to the most generally received legend these four brothers were  quadruplets--born at one birth--and their mother died in bringing them  into life. Their names are given differently by the various tribes, but  are usually identical with the four points of the compass, or something  relating to them. Wabun the East, Kabun the West, Kabibonokka the North,  and Shawano the South, are, in the ordinary language of the interpreters,  the names applied to them. Wabun was the chief and leader, and assigned to  his brothers their various duties, especially to blow the winds.    These were the primitive and chief divinities of the Algonkin race in all  parts of the territory they inhabited. When, as early as 1610, Captain  Argoll visited the tribes who then possessed the banks of the river  Potomac, and inquired concerning their religion, they replied, \"We have  five gods in all; our chief god often appears to us in the form of a  mighty great hare; the other four have no visible shape, but are indeed  the four winds, which keep the four corners of the earth.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: William Strachey, _Historie of Travaile into Virginia_, p.  98.]    Here we see that Wabun, the East, was distinguished from Michabo  (_missi-wabun_), and by a natural and transparent process, the eastern  light being separated from the eastern wind, the original number four was  increased to five. Precisely the same differentiation occurred, as I shall  show, in Mexico, in the case of Quetzalcoatl, as shown in his _Yoel_, or  Wheel of the Winds, which was his sacred pentagram.    Or I will further illustrate this development by a myth of the Huarochiri  Indians, of the coast of Peru. They related that in the beginning of  things there were five eggs on the mountain Condorcoto. In due course of  time these eggs opened and from them came forth five falcons, who were  none other than the Creator of all things, Pariacaca, and his brothers,  the four winds. By their magic power they transformed themselves into men  and went about the world performing miracles, and in time became the gods  of that people.[1]    [Footnote 1: Doctor Francisco de Avila, _Narrative of the Errors and False  Gods of the Indians of Huarochiri_ (1608). This interesting document has  been partly translated by Mr. C.B. Markham, and published in one of the  volumes of the Hackluyt Society's series.]    These striking similarities show with what singular uniformity the  religious sense developes itself in localities the furthest asunder.    Returning to Michabo, the duplicate nature thus assigned him as the  Light-God, and also the God of the Winds and the storms and rains they  bring, led to the production of two cycles of myths which present him in  these two different aspects. In the one he is, as the god of light, the  power that conquers the darkness, who brings warmth and sunlight to the  earth and knowledge to men. He was the patron of hunters, as these require  the light to guide them on their way, and must always direct their course  by the cardinal points.    The morning star, which at certain seasons heralds the dawn, was sacred to  him, and its name in Ojibway is _Wabanang_, from _Waban_, the east. The  rays of light are his servants and messengers. Seated at the extreme east,  \"at the place where the earth is cut off,\" watching in his medicine lodge,  or passing his time fishing in the endless ocean which on every side  surrounds the land, Michabo sends forth these messengers, who, in the  myth, are called _Gijigouai_, which means \"those who make the day,\" and  they light the world. He is never identified with the sun, nor was he  supposed to dwell in it, but he is distinctly the impersonation of  light.[1]    [Footnote 1: See H.R. Schoolcraft, _Indian Tribes_, Vol. v, pp. 418, 419.  _Relations des Jesuites_, 1634, p. 14, 1637, p. 46.]    In one form of the myth he is the grandson of the Moon, his father is the  West Wind, and his mother, a maiden who has been fecundated miraculously  by the passing breeze, dies at the moment of giving him birth. But he did  not need the fostering care of a parent, for he was born mighty of limb  and with all knowledge that it is possible to attain.[1] Immediately he  attacked his father, and a long and desperate struggle took place. \"It  began on the mountains.

I remained in Rio Janeiro above two months, exclusive of the time  devoted to my different excursions into the interior of the country;  it is very far from my intention, however, to tire the reader with a  regular catalogue of every trifling and ordinary occurrence.  I  shall content myself with describing the most striking features in  the town, and likewise in the manners and customs of the  inhabitants, according to the opportunities I possessed during my  stay to form an opinion of them.  I shall then give an account of my  various excursions in an Appendix, and afterwards resume the thread  of my journal.    It was on the morning of the 17th of September that, after the lapse  of nearly two months and a half, I first set foot upon dry land.  The captain himself accompanied the passengers on shore, after  having earnestly advised each one separately to be sure and smuggle  nothing, more especially sealed letters.  \"In no part of the world,\"  he assured us, \"were the Custom-house officers so strict, and the  penalties so heavy.\"    On coming in sight of the guard ship, we began to feel quite  frightened from this description, and made up our minds that we  should be examined from top to toe.  The captain begged permission  to accompany us on shore; this was immediately granted, and the  whole ceremony was completed.  During the entire period that we  lived on board the ship, and were continually going and coming to  and from the town, we never were subjected to any search; it was  only when we took chests and boxes with us that we were obliged to  proceed to the Custom-house, where all effects are strictly  examined, and a heavy duty levied upon merchandise, books, etc.,  etc.    We landed at the Praya dos Mineiros, a disgusting and dirty sort of  square, inhabited by a few dozen blacks, equally disgusting and  dirty, who were squatted on the ground, and praising at the top of  their voices the fruits and sweetmeats which they were offering for  sale.  Thence we proceeded directly into the principal street (Rua  Direita), whose only beauty consists in its breadth.  It contains  several public buildings, such as the Post-office, the Custom-house,  the Exchange, the Guard-house, etc.; all of which, however, are so  insignificant in appearance, that any one would pass them by  unnoticed, if there were not always a number of people loitering  before them.    At the end of this street stands the Imperial Palace, a commonplace,  large building, exactly resembling a private house, without the  least pretensions to taste or architectural beauty.  The square  before it (Largo do Paco), whose only ornament, a plain fountain, is  extremely dirty, and serves at night as a sleeping place for a  number of poor free negroes, who, on getting up in the morning,  perform the various duties of their toilet in public with the most  supreme indifference.  A part of the square is walled off and  employed as a market for fish, fruit, vegetables, and poultry.    Of the remaining streets the Rua Misericorda and the Rua Ouvidor are  the most interesting.  The latter contains the finest and largest  shops; but we must not expect the magnificent establishments we  behold in the cities of Europe--in fact, we meet with little that is  beautiful or costly.  The flower-shops were the only objects of  particular attraction for me.  In these shops are exposed for sale  the most lovely artificial flowers, made of birds' feathers, fishes'  scales, and beetles' wings.    Of the squares, the finest is the Largo do Rocio; the largest, the  Largo St. Anna.  In the first, which is always kept tolerably clean,  stand the Opera-house, the Government-house, the Police-office, etc.  This, too, is the starting-place for most of the omnibuses, which  traverse the town in all directions.    The last-named square is the dirtiest in the whole town.  On  crossing it for the first time, I perceived lying about me half  putrid cats and dogs--and even a mule in the same state.  The only  ornament of this square is a fountain, and I almost think I should  prefer it if the fountain were, in this case, taken away; for, as  soft water is not very abundant in Rio Janeiro, the washerwoman's  noble art pitches its tent wherever it finds any, and most willingly  of all when, at the same time, it meets with a good drying ground.  The consequence is, that in the Largo St. Anna there is always such  an amount of washing and drying, of squalling and screaming, that  you are glad to get away as quickly as possible.    There is nothing remarkable in the appearance of the churches,  either inside or out.  The Church and Cloister of St. Bento and the  Church of St. Candelaria are the most deceptive; from a distance  they have a very imposing look.    The houses are built in the European fashion, but are small and  insignificant; most of them have only a ground-floor or single  story,--two stories are rarely met with.  Neither are there any  terraces and verandahs adorned with elegant trellis-work and  flowers, as there are in other warm countries.  Ugly little  balconies hang from the walls, while clumsy wooden shutters close up  the windows, and prevent the smallest sunbeam from penetrating into  the rooms, where everything is enveloped in almost perfect darkness.  This, however, is a matter of the greatest indifference to the  Brazilian ladies, who certainly never over-fatigue themselves with  reading or working.    The town offers, therefore, very little in the way of squares,  streets, and buildings, which, for a stranger, can prove in the  least attractive; while the people that he meets are truly shocking--  nearly all being negroes and negresses, with flat, ugly noses,  thick lips, and short woolly hair.  They are, too, generally half  naked, with only a few miserable rags on their backs, or else they  are thrust into the worn-out European-cut clothes of their masters.  To every four or five blacks may be reckoned a mulatto, and it is  only here and there that a white man is to be seen.    This horrible picture is rendered still more revolting by the  frequent bodily infirmities which everywhere meet the eye:  among  these elephantiasis, causing horrible club-feet, is especially  conspicuous; there is, too, no scarcity of persons afflicted with  blindness and other ills.  Even the cats and dogs, that run about  the gutters in great numbers, partake of the universal ugliness:  most of them are covered with the mange, or are full of wounds and  sores.  I should like to be endowed with the magic power of  transporting hither every traveller who starts back with affright  from the lanes of Constantinople, and asserts that the sight of the  interior of this city destroys the effect produced by it when viewed  at a distance.    It is true that the interior of Constantinople is exceedingly dirty,  and that the number of small houses, the narrow streets, the  unevenness of the pavement, the filthy dogs, etc., do not strike the  beholder as excessively picturesque; but then he soon comes upon  some magnificent edifice of the time of the Moors or Romans, some  wondrous mosque or majestic palace, and can continue his walk  through endless cemeteries and forests of dreamy cypresses.  He  steps aside before a pasha or priest of high rank, who rides by on  his noble steed, surrounded by a brilliant retinue; he encounters  Turks in splendid costumes, and Turkish women with eyes that flash  through their veils like fire; he beholds Persians with their high  caps, Arabs with their nobly-formed features, dervises in fools'-  caps and plaited petticoats like women, and, now and then, some  carriage, beautifully painted and gilt, drawn by superbly  caparisoned oxen.  All these different objects fully make up for  whatever amount of dirtiness may occasionally be met with.  In Rio  Janeiro, however, there is nothing that can in any way amuse, or  atone for the horrible and disgusting sights which everywhere meet  the eye.    It was not until I had been here several weeks that I became  somewhat accustomed to the appearance of the negroes and mulattoes.  I then discovered many very pretty figures among the young  negresses, and handsome, expressive countenances among the somewhat  dark-complexioned Brazilian and Portuguese women; the men seem, as  regards beauty, to be less favoured.    The bustle in the streets is far less than what I had been led to  expect from the many descriptions I had heard, and is certainly not  to be compared to that at Naples or Messina.  The greatest amount of  noise is made by those negroes who carry burdens, and especially by  such as convey the sacks full of coffee on board the different  vessels; they strike up a monotonous sort of song, to the tune of  which they keep step, but which sounds very disagreeable.  It  possesses, however, one advantage; it warns the foot passenger, and  affords him time to get out of the way.    In the Brazils, every kind of dirty or hard work, whether in doors  or out, is performed by the blacks, who here, in fact, replace the  lower classes.  Many, however, learn trades, and frequently are to  be compared to the most skilful Europeans.  I have seen blacks in  the most elegant workshops, making wearing apparel, shoes, tapestry,  gold or silver articles, and met many a nattily dressed negro maiden  working at the finest ladies' dresses, or the most delicate  embroidery.  I often thought I must be dreaming when I beheld these  poor creatures, whom I had pictured to myself as roaming free  through their native forests, exercising such occupations in shops  and rooms!  Yet they do not appear to feel it as much as might be  supposed--they were always merry, and joking over their work.    Among the so-called educated class of the place, there are many who,  in spite of all the proofs of mechanical skill, as well as general  intelligence which the blacks often display, "]]]
