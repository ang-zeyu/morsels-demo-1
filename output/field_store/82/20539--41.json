The poetry of the mood,  like that of a Moerike, remained for a long time almost unknown on  account of its strictly intimate character. In the success of Ernst  von Wildenbruch we see provisionally the last victory of this sort of  literature--which directly proclaims what is worth striving for--at  least in its loftier form. For the contemporary novel constantly takes  for its subject the emancipation of woman, or the fight for culture,  the protection of the Ostmark, or the fight against alcohol.    On the other hand the Romantic school has also broadened the realm of  poetic material in a very important manner, by adding to it the  provinces of the phantastic, the visionary, the fairy-like, and by  giving to the symbolical an undreamed-of expansion.    On the whole, modern German literature has probably a richer field  from which to choose her material than any other literature can boast  of. In fact it is perhaps too variegated, and thus, because of the  richness and originality of its subject matter, allows too much  latitude to genius. One field only in poetry, considered from the  viewpoint of real art, is almost uncultivated. All the efforts and all  the attempts on the part of both Catholics and Protestants have not  succeeded in producing religious poems of any degree of importance  since Annette von Droste-Huelshoff ceased to sing; whereas, on the  other hand, poetry that is hostile to the church has brought to  maturity some great productions, not only in Anzengruber or Karl  Schoenherr, in Friedrich Theodor Vischer, in Storm, and Keller, but,  above all, in Nietzsche. A turn in the tide that seems just now to be  taking place is exemplified in the important epic poems of Enrica von  Handel-Mazzetti.    Finally, as the last and, in a certain sense, the strongest, pillar of  permanency we will name the public. It is just as much a product as a  contributing factor of literature; in both respects, however,  preeminently important as a conservative force. The predominant and  enduring tendencies, forms, and subjects are naturally chiefly  conducive to the formation of a circle of \"fixed subscribers\" among  the crowd of possible patrons. These subscribers, on their part, of  course insist upon the preservation of those tendencies, forms, and  subjects by which they are attracted. In the same way that, in  general, a large \"reading world,\" or a regular public for a theatre,  or a solid community of devotees for each of the different species of  song (as for example, the religious song, the folk-song, the student's  song) is organized, so do important personalities call into being a  special following of admirers, such as the partisans of Hebbel, the  Wagnerians, and the adherents of Stefan George. But these narrow  circles are often much more intolerant of every effort on the part of  the master to depart from the program he has sworn to, than are  outsiders. The history of the German public, unlike that of the  English or French, is less a church-history than a sect-history.  Schiller alone succeeded in becoming the national poet of his  people--and he had his merits as well as his weaknesses to thank for  it. Lessing is the one who comes next to him, whereas Goethe really  reached the masses in only a few of his compositions. On the other  hand, he made a stronger impression upon, and gave more happiness to,  the intellectual classes than any of our poets since Klopstock. After  him, only poets of a decidedly esoteric character, such as Stefan  George or Friedrich Nietzsche, have had such a profound effect or one  so capable of stirring the remoter depths of the soul. Even with Jean  Paul the impression produced was more superficial. Latterly, however,  periodicals, lecture-courses and clubs have replaced the  \"_caucus_\"--which was formerly held by the most influential readers  and hearers of the literary fraternities. This change has gone so far  that the intimacy of the relations between a poet and his admirers,  which was still possible in the early days of Hauptmann, Hofmannsthal,  George, and Dehmel, now actually exists only for those poets who have  not attained any special renown, such as Alfred Mombert, or, perhaps,  we might also include Spitteler. An amalgamation of the different  groups, which in Germany are wont to prove their love for their patron  by combatting his supposed or real opponents rather than by actively  fostering his artistic tendencies, might have produced a strong and  effective reading public. But sooner can a stenographer of the Stolze  school agree with one of the Gabelsberger system than can a votary of  Dehmel dare to recognize the greatness in George, an admirer of  Schnitzler see the importance of Herbert Eulenberg, or a friend of  Gustav Frenssen acknowledge the power of Ricarda Huch. Our public, by  its separatist taste and the unduly emphasized obstinacy of its  antipathies, will continue for a long time still to hinder that unity,  which, rising above even a just recognition of differences, is the  only element which makes a great literature possible. Of course the  critics are to be reckoned among the public, whether we consider  criticism by professional reviewers or the more discriminating  criticism of theatre directors, composers, etc.    In all the foregoing discussion of the prevailingly conservative  forces in the development of literature we have seen that none of  these forces has a completely restraining effect. Language always  undergoes a certain change, even in the most benumbed periods, since  it is obliged to suit itself to the new demands of trade, of society,  even of literature itself. We also saw that form and material were not  an inert mass, but were in continual, though often slow, movement.  Finally, though the public itself always demands essentially the same  thing, it has, nevertheless, new variations which are forced upon it  by its avidity for new subjects; it also demands, when it has enjoyed  a higher artistic education (as in the days of the Classical and  Romantic writers), perfection of technique and increase in  specifically artistic values. Between the abiding and the progressive,  between the conservative and revolutionary tendencies, _the typical  development of the individual himself_ takes its place as a natural  intermediary factor. No literary \"generation\" is composed of men  actually of the same age. Beside the quite young who are merely  panting to express themselves, stand the mature who exercise an  esthetic discernment, even as regards their own peculiar experience;  finally, there are also the older men who have already said their say.  In the same way every public is made up of people of all ages. These  make different demands of their poets; youth wishes to conquer,  manhood to fortify, old age merely not to lose. It is self-evident  that points of conformity are to be found between the most widely  differing fields: as, for example, conservative tendencies are present  in the camp of the destroyers, revolutionary tendencies in that of the  conservatives. In other words, in every community of men, no matter of  what description, who are united by any kind of higher interest, new  ideals grow up out of this very community of interest. Men who happen  to be thrown together mutually cause one another's demands to  increase; those who work in common try to outdo one another. Out of  their midst personalities arise, who, brought up with the loftiest  ideals, or often spurred on by the supineness of the public, with  passionate earnestness make what merely filled up the leisure hours of  others the sole purpose of their lives. Thus, in Germany above all,  the new ideal has been born again and again, constituting the  strongest motive power which exists, besides the personality of  genius itself.    Of the greatest importance, to begin with, is the _ideal of a national  literature itself_. Gottsched was the first in Germany, if not to  apprehend it, at least to ponder it and to advocate it with persistent  zeal. The literature of antiquity and the literature of France offered  types of fixed national units. The affinity between the two as  national units had been pointed out in France and England by means of  the celebrated \"Combat of the ancients and moderns,\" which also first  gave living writers sufficient courage to think of comparing modern  art with ancient.    Gottsched presented a program which he systematically strove to carry  out, and in which one of the most important places is given to the  building up of an artistic theatre, after the model of the great  civilized nations. He surely had as much right to show some  intolerance toward the harlequin and the popular stage as Lessing (who  supplanted him while continuing his work) had to indulge in a like  prejudice against the classical theatre of the French. Lessing,  however, as we have already seen, goes at the same time more deeply  into the matter by proposing not only a systematic but also an organic  construction of the separate _genres_, and Herder took the last step  when he demanded an autochthonous growth--that is to say, a  development of art out of the inner necessity of personalities on the  one hand, and of nationalities on the other. To be sure, the great  poets who now appeared were not included in the program, and Gottsched  did not appreciate Haller, nor did Lessing form a correct estimate of  Goethe, or Herder of Schiller. There is, however, a mysterious  connection between the aspirations of the nation and the appearance  of genius.    Klopstock probably felt most directly what was wanting in the  literature of his people, as he was also the most burning patriot of  all our classical writers; and at the same time, as is proved by the  _Republic of Letters_, his strange treatise on the art of poetry, he  was the one among them who bore the most resemblance to the literary  pedant of the old days.

I am sure that you will help  us if you can, and that you can help us if you will, with your clear  head and your admirable frankness. If you will leave us your card, Dr.  Jervis and I will keep you informed of our prospects and ask for your  assistance whenever we need it.\"    After our fair visitor had departed, Thorndyke stood for a minute or  more gazing dreamily into the fire. Then, with a quick glance at his  watch, he resumed his hat and, catching up the microscope, handed the  camera case to me and made for the door.  \"How the time goes!\" he  exclaimed, as we descended the stairs; \"but it hasn't been wasted,  Jervis, hey?\"    \"No, I suppose not,\" I answered tentatively.    \"You suppose not!\" he replied. \"Why here is as pretty a little problem  as you could desire--what would be called in the jargon of the novels, a  psychological problem--and it is your business to work it out, too.\"    \"You mean as to Miss Gibson's relations with these two young men?\"    Thorndyke nodded.    \"Is it any concern of ours?\" I asked.    \"Certainly it is,\" he replied. \"Everything is a concern of ours at this  preliminary stage. We are groping about for a clue and must let nothing  pass unscrutinised.\"    \"Well, then, to begin with, she is not wildly infatuated with Walter  Hornby, I should say.\"    \"No,\" agreed Thorndyke, laughing softly; \"we may take it that the canny  Walter has not inspired a grand passion.\"    \"Then,\" I resumed, \"if I were a suitor for Miss Gibson's hand, I think I  would sooner stand in Reuben's shoes than in Walter's.\"    \"There again I am with you,\" said Thorndyke. \"Go on.\"    \"Well,\" I continued, \"our fair visitor conveyed to me the impression  that her evident admiration of Reuben's character was tempered by  something that she had heard from a third party. That expression of  hers, 'speaking from my own observation,' seemed to imply that her  observations of him were not in entire agreement with somebody else's.\"    \"Good man!\" exclaimed Thorndyke, slapping me on the back, to the  undissembled surprise of a policeman whom we were passing; \"that is what  I had hoped for in you--the capacity to perceive the essential  underneath the obvious. Yes; somebody has been saying something about  our client, and the thing that we have to find out is, what is it that  has been said and who has been saying it. We shall have to make a  pretext for another interview with Miss Gibson.\"    \"By the way, why didn't you ask her what she meant?\" I asked foolishly.    Thorndyke grinned in my face. \"Why didn't you?\" he retorted.    \"No,\" I rejoined, \"I suppose it is not politic to appear too discerning.  Let me carry the microscope for a time; it is making your arm ache, I  see.\"    \"Thanks,\" said he, handing the case to me and rubbing his fingers; \"it  is rather ponderous.\"    \"I can't make out what you want with this great instrument,\" I said. \"A  common pocket lens would do all that you require. Besides, a six-inch  objective will not magnify more than two or three diameters.\"    \"Two, with the draw-tube closed,\" replied Thorndyke, \"and the low-power  eye-piece brings it up to four. Polton made them both for me for  examining cheques, bank-notes and other large objects. But you will  understand when you see me use the instrument, and remember, you are to  make no comments.\"    We had by this time arrived at the entrance to Scotland Yard, and were  passing up the narrow thoroughfare, when we encountered a uniformed  official who halted and saluted my colleague.    \"Ah, I thought we should see you here before long, doctor,\" said he  genially. \"I heard this morning that you have this thumb-print case in  hand.\"    \"Yes,\" replied Thorndyke; \"I am going to see what can be done for the  defence.\"    \"Well,\" said the officer as he ushered us into the building, \"you've  given us a good many surprises, but you'll give us a bigger one if you  can make anything of this. It's a foregone conclusion, I should say.\"    \"My dear fellow,\" said Thorndyke, \"there is no such thing. You mean that  there is a _prima facie_ case against the accused.\"    \"Put it that way if you like,\" replied the officer, with a sly smile,  \"but I think you will find this about the hardest nut you ever tried  your teeth on--and they're pretty strong teeth too, I'll say that. You  had better come into Mr. Singleton's office,\" and he conducted us along  a corridor and into a large, barely-furnished room, where we found a  sedate-looking gentleman seated at a large writing table.    \"How-d'ye-do, doctor?\" said the latter, rising and holding out his hand.  \"I can guess what you've come for. Want to see that thumb-print, eh?\"    \"Quite right,\" answered Thorndyke, and then, having introduced me, he  continued: \"We were partners in the last game, but we are on opposite  sides of the board this time.\"    \"Yes,\" agreed Mr. Singleton; \"and we are going to give you check-mate.\"    He unlocked a drawer and drew forth a small portfolio, from which he  extracted a piece of paper which he laid on the table. It appeared to be  a sheet torn from a perforated memorandum block, and bore the pencilled  inscription: \"Handed in by Reuben at 7.3 p.m., 9.3.01. J. H.\" At one end  was a dark, glossy blood-stain, made by the falling of a good-sized  drop, and this was smeared slightly, apparently by a finger or thumb  having been pressed on it. Near to it were two or three smaller smears  and a remarkably distinct and clean print of a thumb.    Thorndyke gazed intently at the paper for a minute or two, scrutinising  the thumb-print and the smears in turn, but making no remark, while Mr.  Singleton watched his impassive face with expectant curiosity.    \"Not much difficulty in identifying that mark,\" the official at length  observed.    \"No,\" agreed Thorndyke; \"it is an excellent impression and a very  distinctive pattern, even without the scar.\"    \"Yes,\" rejoined Mr. Singleton; \"the scar makes it absolutely conclusive.  You have a print with you, I suppose?\"    \"Yes,\" replied Thorndyke, and he drew from a wide flap-pocket the  enlarged photograph, at the sight of which Mr. Singleton's face  broadened into a smile.    \"You don't want to put on spectacles to look at that,\" he remarked; \"not  that you gain anything by so much enlargement; three diameters is ample  for studying the ridge-patterns. I see you have divided it up into  numbered squares--not a bad plan; but ours--or rather Galton's, for we  borrowed the method from him--is better for this purpose.\"    He drew from the portfolio a half-plate photograph of the thumb-print  which appeared magnified to about four inches in length. The print was  marked by a number of figures written minutely with a fine-pointed pen,  each figure being placed on an \"island,\" a loop, a bifurcation or some  other striking and characteristic portion of the ridge-pattern.    \"This system of marking with reference numbers,\" said Mr. Singleton, \"is  better than your method of squares, because the numbers are only placed  at points which are important for comparison, whereas your squares or  the intersections of the lines fall arbitrarily on important or  unimportant points according to chance. Besides, we can't let you mark  our original, you know, though, of course, we can give you a photograph,  which will do as well.\"    \"I was going to ask you to let me take a photograph presently,\" said  Thorndyke.    \"Certainly,\" replied Mr. Singleton, \"if you would rather have one of  your own taking. I know you don't care to take anything on trust. And  now I must get on with my work, if you will excuse me. Inspector Johnson  will give you any assistance you may require.\"    \"And see that I don't pocket the original,\" added Thorndyke, with a  smile at the inspector who had shown us in.    \"Oh, I'll see to that,\" said the latter, grinning; and, as Mr. Singleton  returned to his table, Thorndyke unlocked the microscope case and drew  forth the instrument.    \"What, are you going to put it under the microscope?\" exclaimed Mr.  Singleton, looking round with a broad smile.    \"Must do something for my fee, you know,\" replied Thorndyke, as he set  up the microscope and screwed on two extra objectives to the triple  nose-piece.  \"You observe that there is no deception,\" he added to the  inspector, as he took the paper from Mr. Singleton's table and placed it  between two slips of glass.    \"I'm watching you, sir,\" replied the officer, with a chuckle; and he did  watch, with close attention and great interest, while Thorndyke laid the  glass slips on the microscope stage and proceeded to focus.    I also watched, and was a good deal exercised in my mind by my  colleague's proceedings. After a preliminary glance with the six-inch  glass, he swung round the nose-piece to the half-inch objective and  slipped in a more powerful eye-piece, and with this power he examined  the blood-stains carefully, and then moved the thumb-print into the  field of vision. After looking at this for some time with deep  attention, he drew from the case a tiny spirit lamp which was evidently  filled with an alcoholic solution of some sodium salt, for when he lit  it I recognised the characteristic yellow sodium flame. Then he replaced  one of the objectives by a spectroscopic attachment, and having placed  the little lamp close to the microscope mirror, adjusted the  spectroscope. Evidently my friend was fixing the position of the \"D\"  line (or sodium line) in the spectrum.    Having completed the adjustments, he now examined afresh the  blood-smears and the thumb-print, both by transmitted and reflected  light, and I observed him hurriedly draw one or two diagrams in his  notebook. Then he replaced the spectroscope and lamp in the case and  brought forth the micrometer--a slip of rather thin glass about three  inches by one and a half--which he laid over the thumb-print in the  place of the upper plate of glass.
