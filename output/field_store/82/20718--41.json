I'll  go a little way with you just to get you started right.\"    \"Thank you,\" replied Grandfather Frog. \"Let's start right away.\"          XIII    DANNY MEADOW MOUSE FEELS RESPONSIBLE      Responsible is a great big word. But it is just as big in its meaning as  it is in its looks, and that is the way words should be, I think, don't  you? Anyway, re-spon-sible is the way Danny Meadow Mouse felt when he  found Grandfather Frog out on the Green Meadows so far from the Smiling  Pool and so stubborn that he would keep on to see the Great World  instead of going back to his big green lily-pad in the Smiling Pool,  where he could take care of himself. You remember Peter Rabbit felt  re-spon-sible when he brought little Miss Fuzzy tail down from the Old  Pasture to the dear Old Briar-patch. He felt that it was his business  to see to it that no harm came to her, and that is just the way Danny  Meadow Mouse felt about Grandfather Frog.    You see, Danny knew that if Grandfather Frog was going to jump like that  every time he was frightened, he wouldn't get very far in the Great  World. It might be the right thing to do in the Smiling Pool, where the  friendly water would hide him from his enemies, but it was just the  wrong thing to do on the Green Meadows or in the Green Forest. Danny had  learned, when a very tiny fellow, that there the only safe thing to do  when danger was near was to sit perfectly still and hardly breathe.    Now Danny Meadow Mouse is fond of Grandfather Frog, and he couldn't bear  to think that something dreadful might happen to him. So when he found  that he couldn't get Grandfather Frog to go back to the Smiling Pool, he  made up his mind that he just _had_ to go along with Grandfather Frog to  try to keep him out of danger. Yes, Sir, he just _had_ to do it. He felt  re-spon-sible for Grandfather Frog's safety. So here they were, Danny  Meadow Mouse running ahead, anxious and worried and watching sharply for  signs of danger, and Grandfather Frog puffing along behind, bound to see  the Great World which his cousin, old Mr. Toad, said was a better place  to live in than the Smiling Pool.    Now Danny has a great many private little paths under the grass all over  the Green Meadows, and along these he can scamper ever so fast without  once showing himself to those who may be looking for him. Of course he  started to take Grandfather Frog along one of these little paths. But  Grandfather Frog doesn't walk or run; he jumps. There wasn't room in  Danny's little paths for jumping, as they soon found out. Grandfather  Frog simply couldn't follow Danny along those little paths. Danny sat  down to think, and puckered his brows anxiously. He was more worried  than ever. It was very clear that Grandfather Frog would have to travel  out in the open, where there was room for him to jump, and where also he  would be right out in plain sight of all who happened along. Once more  Danny urged him to go back to the Smiling Pool, but he might just as  well have talked to a stick or a stone. Grandfather Frog had started out  to see the Great World, and he was going to see it.    Danny sighed. \"If you will, you will, I suppose,\" said he, \"and I guess  the only place you can travel in any comfort is the Lone Little Path.  It is dangerous, very dangerous, but I guess you will have to do it.\"    \"Chugarum!\" replied Grandfather Frog, \"I'm not afraid. You show me the  Lone Little Path and then go about your business, Danny Meadow Mouse.\"    So Danny led the way to the Lone Little Path, and Grandfather Frog  sighed with relief, for here he could jump without getting all tangled  up in long grass and without hurting his tender feet on sharp stubble  where the grass had been cut. But Danny felt more worried than ever. He  wouldn't leave Grandfather Frog because, you know, he felt re-spon-sible  for him, and at the same time he was terribly afraid, for he felt sure  that some of their enemies would see them. He wanted to go back, but he  kept right on, and that shows just what a brave little fellow Danny  Meadow Mouse was.          XIV    GRANDFATHER FROG HAS A STRANGE RIDE      A thousand things may happen to,      Ten thousand things befall,    The traveler who careless is,      Or thinks he knows it all.      Grandfather Frog, jumping along behind Danny Meadow Mouse up the Lone  Little Path, was beginning to think that Danny was the most timid and  easiest frightened of all the little meadow people of his acquaintance.  Danny kept as much under the grass that overhung the Lone Little Path as  he could. When there were perfectly bare places, Danny looked this way  and looked that way anxiously and then scampered across as fast as he  could make his little legs go. When he was safely across, he would wait  for Grandfather Frog. If a shadow passed over the grass, Danny would  duck under the nearest leaf and hold his breath.    \"Foolish!\" muttered Grandfather Frog. \"Foolish, foolish to be so afraid!  Now, I'm not afraid until I see something to be afraid of. Time enough  then. What's the good of looking for trouble all the time? Now, here I  am out in the Great World, and I'm not afraid. And here's Danny Meadow  Mouse, who has lived here all his life, acting as if he expected  something dreadful to happen any minute. Pooh! How very, very foolish!\"    Now Grandfather Frog is old and in the Smiling Pool he is accounted  very, very wise. But the wisest sometimes become foolish when they think  that they know all there is to know. It was so with Grandfather Frog.  It was he who was foolish and not Danny Meadow Mouse. You see Danny knew  all the dangers on the Green Meadows, and how many sharp eyes were all  the time watching for him. He had long ago learned that the only way to  feel safe was to feel afraid. You see, then he was watching for danger  every minute, and so he wasn't likely to be surprised by his hungry  enemies.    So while Grandfather Frog was looking down on Danny for being so timid,  Danny was really doing the wisest thing. More than that, he was really  very, very brave. He was showing Grandfather Frog the way up the Lone  Little Path to see the Great World, when he himself would never, never  have thought of traveling anywhere but along his own secret little  paths, just because Grandfather Frog couldn't jump anywhere excepting  where the way was fairly clear, as in the Lone Little Path, and Danny  was afraid that unless Grandfather Frog had some one with him to watch  out for him, he would surely come to a sad end.    The farther they went with nothing happening, the more foolish Danny's  timid way of running and hiding seemed to Grandfather Frog, and he was  just about to tell Danny just what he thought, when Danny dived into the  long grass and warned Grandfather Frog to do the same. But Grandfather  Frog didn't.    \"Chugarum!\" said he, \"I don't see anything to be afraid of, and I'm not  going to hide until I do.\"    So he sat still right where he was, in the middle of the Lone Little  Path, looking this way and that way, and seeing nothing to be afraid of.  And just then around a turn in the Lone Little Path came--who do you  think? Why Farmer Brown's boy! He saw Grandfather Frog and with a whoop  of joy he sprang for him. Grandfather Frog gave a frightened croak and  jumped, but he was too late. Before he could jump again Farmer Brown's  boy had him by his long hind-legs.    \"Ha, ha!\" shouted Farmer Brown's boy, \"I believe this is the very old  chap I have tried so often to catch in the Smiling Pool. These legs of  yours will be mighty fine eating, Mr. Frog. They will, indeed.\"    With that he tied Grandfather Frog's legs together and went on his way  across the Green Meadows with poor old Grandfather Frog dangling from  the end of a string. It was a strange ride and a most uncomfortable one,  and with all his might Grandfather Frog wished he had never thought of  going out into the Great World.          XV    GRANDFATHER FROG GIVES UP HOPE      With his legs tied together, hanging head down from the end of a string,  Grandfather Frog was being carried he knew not where by Farmer Brown's  boy. It was dreadful. Half-way across the Green Meadows the Merry Little  Breezes of Old Mother West Wind came dancing along. At first they didn't  see Grandfather Frog, but presently one of them, rushing up to tease  Farmer Brown's boy by blowing off his hat, caught sight of Grandfather  Frog.    Now the Merry Little Breezes are great friends of Grandfather Frog.  Many, many times they have blown foolish green flies over to him as he  sat on his big green lily-pad, and they are very fond of him. So when  this one caught sight of him in such a dreadful position, he forgot all  about teasing Farmer Brown's boy. He raced away to tell the other Merry  Little Breezes. For a minute they were perfectly still. They forgot all  about being merry.    \"It's awful, just perfectly awful!\" cried one.    \"We must do something to help Grandfather Frog!\" cried another.    \"Of course we must,\" said a third.    \"But what can we do?\" asked a fourth.    Nobody replied. They just thought and thought and thought. Finally the  first one spoke. \"We might try to comfort him a little,\" said he.    \"Of course we will do that!\" they shouted all together.    \"And if we throw dust in the face of Farmer Brown's boy and steal his  hat, perhaps he will put Grandfather Frog down,\" continued the Merry  Little Breeze.    \"The very thing!\" the others cried, dancing about with excitement.    \"Then we can rush about and tell all Grandfather Frog's friends what has  happened to him and where he is. Perhaps some of them can help us,\" the  Little"]]]
