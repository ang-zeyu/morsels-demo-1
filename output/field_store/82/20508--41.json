By the former the citizen could contract a valid marriage  and acquire the rights resulting from it, particularly the paternal  power; by the latter he could acquire and dispose of property.  Citizenship was acquired by birth and by manumission; it was lost when a  Roman became a prisoner of war, or had been exiled for crime, or became  a citizen of another State. An unsullied reputation was required by law  for a citizen to exercise his rights to their full extent.    The Roman jurists acknowledged all persons originally free by natural  law; and while they recognized slavery, they ascribed the power of  masters entirely to the law and custom of nations. Persons taken in war  were considered at the absolute control of their captors, and were  therefore, _de facto_, slaves; the children of a female slave followed  the condition of their mother, and belonged to her master. But masters  could manumit their slaves, who thus became Roman citizens with some  restrictions. After the emancipation of a slave, he was bound to render  certain services to his former master as patron, and if the freedman  died intestate his property reverted to his patron.    Marriage was contracted by the simple consent of the parties, though in  early times equality of condition was required. The _lex Canuleia_,  A.U.C. 309, authorized connubium between patricians and plebeians, and  the _lex Julia_, A.U.C. 757, allowed it between freedmen and freeborn.  By the _conventio in manum_, a wife passed out of her family into that  of her husband, who acquired all her property; without it, the woman  remained in the power of her father, and retained the free disposition  of her property. Polygamy was not permitted; and relationship within  certain degrees rendered the parties incapable of contracting marriage.  (These rules as to forbidden degrees have been substantially adopted in  England.) Celibacy was discouraged. Concubinage was allowed, if a man  had not a wife, and provided the concubine was not the wife of another  man; this heathenish custom was abrogated by Justinian. The wife was  entitled to protection and support from her husband, and she retained  her property independent of him. On her marriage the father gave his  daughter a dowry in proportion to his means, the management of which,  with its usufruct during marriage, belonged to the husband; but he could  not alienate real estate without the wife's consent, and on the  dissolution of marriage the _dos_ reverted to the wife. Divorce existed  in all ages at Rome, and was very common at the beginning of the empire;  to check its prevalence, laws were passed inflicting severe penalties on  those whose bad conduct led to it. Every man, whether married or not,  could adopt children under certain restrictions, and they passed  entirely under paternal power. But the marriage relation among the  Romans did not accord after all with those principles of justice which  we see in other parts of their legislative code. The Roman husband, like  the father, was a tyrant. The facility of divorce destroyed mutual  confidence, and inflamed every trifling dispute; for a word or a  message or a letter or the mandate of a freedman was quite sufficient to  secure a separation. It was not until Christianity became the religion  of the empire that divorce could not be easily effected without a just  cause. This facility of divorce was a great stigma on the Roman laws,  and the degradation of woman was the principal consequence. But woman  never was honored in any Pagan land, although her condition at Rome was  better than it was at Athens. She always was regarded as a possession  rather than as a person; her virtue was mistrusted, and her aspirations  were scorned; she was hampered and guarded more like a slave than the  equal companion of man. But the progress of legislation, as a whole, was  in her favor, and she continued to gain new privileges until the fall of  the empire. The Roman Catholic Church regards marriage as one of the  sacraments, and through all the Middle Ages and down to our own day the  great authority of the Church has been one of the strongest supports of  that institution, as necessary to Christianity as to civilization. We  Americans have improved on the morality of Jesus, of the early and later  Church, and of the great nations of modern Europe; and in many of our  States persons are allowed to slip out of the marriage tie about as  easily as they get into it.    Nothing is more remarkable in the Roman laws than the extent of  paternal power. It was unjust, and bears the image of a barbarous age.  Moreover, it seems to have been coeval with the foundation of the city.  A father could chastise his children by stripes, by imprisonment, by  exile, by sending them to the country with chains on their feet. He was  even armed with the power of life and death. \"Neither age nor rank,\"  says Gibbon, \"nor the consular office, could exempt the most illustrious  citizen from the bonds of filial subjection. Without fear, though not  without danger of abuse, the Roman legislators had reposed unbounded  confidence in the sentiments of paternal love, and the oppression was  tempered by the assurance that each generation must succeed in its turn  to the awful dignity of parent and master.\" By an express law of the  Twelve Tables a father could sell his children as slaves. But the abuse  of paternal power was checked in the republic by the censors, and  afterward by emperors. Alexander Severus limited the right of the father  to simple correction, and Constantine declared the father who should  kill his son to be guilty of murder. The rigor of parents in reference  to the disposition of the property of children was also gradually  relaxed. Under Augustus, the son could keep absolute possession of what  he had acquired in war; under Constantine, he could retain any property  acquired in the civil service, and all property inherited from the  mother could also be retained. In later times, a father could not give  his son or daughter to another by adoption without their consent. Thus  this _patria potestas_ was gradually relaxed as civilization advanced,  though it remained a peculiarity of Roman law to the latest times, and  was severer than is ever seen in the modern world. Fathers were bound to  maintain their children when they had no separate means to supply their  wants, and children were also bound to maintain their parents if in  want. These reciprocal duties, creditable to the Roman lawgivers, are  recognized in the French Code, but not in the English, which also  recognizes the right of a father to bequeath his whole estate to  strangers,--a thing which Roman fathers had not power to do. The age  when children attained majority among the Romans was twenty-five years.  Women were condemned to the perpetual tutelage of parents, husbands, or  guardians, as it was supposed they never could attain to the age of  reason and experience. The relation of guardian and ward was strictly  observed by the Romans. They made a distinction between the right to  govern a person and the right to manage his estate, although the tutor  or guardian could do both. If the pupil was an infant, the tutor could  act without the intervention of the pupil; if the pupil was above seven  years of age, he was considered to have an imperfect will. The youth  ceased to be a pupil, if a boy, at fourteen; if a girl, at twelve. The  tutor managed the estate of the pupil, but was liable for loss  occasioned by bad management. He could sell movable property when  expedient, but not real estate, without judicial authority. The tutor  named by the father was preferred to all others.    The Institutes of Justinian pass from persons to things, or the law  relating to real rights; in other words, that which pertains to  property. Some things common to all, like air, light, the ocean, and  things sacred, like temples and churches, are not classed as property.    Two things were required for the transfer of property, for it is the  essence of property that the owner of a thing should have the right to  transfer it,--first, the consent of the owner to transfer the thing upon  some just ground; and secondly, the actual delivery of the thing to the  person who is to acquire it. Movables were presumed to be the property  of the possessors, until positive evidence was produced to the contrary.  A prescriptive title to movables was acquired by possession for one  year, and to immovables by possession for two years. Undisturbed  possession for thirty years constituted in general a valid title.    When a Roman died, his heirs succeeded to all his property by hereditary  right. If he left no will, his estate devolved upon his relatives in a  certain order prescribed by law. The power of making a testament only  belonged to citizens above puberty. Children under the paternal power  could not make a will. Males above fourteen and females above twelve,  when not under power, could make wills without the authority of their  guardian; but pupils, lunatics, prisoners of war, criminals, and various  other persons were incapable of making a testament. The testator could  divide his property among his heirs in such proportions as he saw fit;  but if there was no distribution, all the heirs participated equally. A  man could disinherit either of his children by declaring his intentions  in his will, but only for grave reasons,--such as grievously injuring  his person or character or feelings, or attempting his life. No will was  effectual unless one or more persons were appointed heirs to represent  the deceased. Wills were required to be signed by the testator, or some  person for him, in the presence of seven witnesses who were Roman  citizens.

[ADMETUS _goes into the house_]    CHORUS.  Oh, a House that loves the stranger,    And a House for ever free!  And Apollo, the Song-changer,    Was a herdsman in thy fee;      Yea, a-piping he was found,      Where the upward valleys wound,  To the kine from out the manger    And the sheep from off the lea,      And love was upon Othrys at the sound.    And from deep glens unbeholden    Of the forest to his song  There came lynxes streaky-golden,    There came lions in a throng,      Tawny-coated, ruddy-eyed,      To that piper in his pride;  And shy fawns he would embolden,    Dappled dancers, out along      The shadow by the pine-tree's side.    And those magic pipes a-blowing    Have fulfilled thee in thy reign  By thy Lake with honey flowing,    By thy sheepfolds and thy grain;      Where the Sun turns his steeds      To the twilight, all the meads  Of Molossus know thy sowing    And thy ploughs upon the plain.      Yea, and eastward thou art free      To the portals of the sea,  And Pelion, the unharboured, is but minister to thee.      He hath opened wide his dwelling      To the stranger, though his ruth    For the dead was fresh and welling,      For the loved one of his youth.        'Tis the brave heart's cry:        \"I will fail not, though I die!\"    Doth it win, with no man's telling,      Some high vision of the truth?        We may marvel. Yet I trust,        When man seeketh to be just  And to pity them that wander, God will raise him from the dust.    [_As the song ceases the doors are thrown open and_ ADMETUS _comes  before them: a great funeral procession is seen moving out._]    ADMETUS.  Most gentle citizens, our dead is here  Made ready; and these youths to bear the bier  Uplifted to the grave-mound and the urn.  Now, seeing she goes forth never to return,  Bid her your last farewell, as mourners may.    [_The procession moves forward, past him_.]    LEADER.  Nay, lord; thy father, walking old and grey;  And followers bearing burial gifts and brave  Gauds, which men call the comfort of the grave.    _Enter_ PHERES _with followers bearing robes and gifts_.    PHERES.  I come in sorrow for thy sorrow, son.  A faithful wife indeed thou hast lost, and one  Who ruled her heart. But, howso hard they be,  We needs must bear these griefs.--Some gifts for thee  Are here.... Yes; take them. Let them go beneath  The sod. We both must honour her in death,  Seeing she hath died, my son, that thou mayst live  Nor I be childless. Aye, she would not give  My soul to a sad old age, mourning for thee.  Methinks she hath made all women's life to be  A nobler thing, by one great woman's deed.    Thou saviour of my son, thou staff in need  To our wrecked age, farewell! May some good life  Be thine still in the grave.--Oh, 'tis a wife  Like this man needs; else let him stay unwed!    [_The old man has not noticed_ ADMETUS'S _gathering  indignation_.]    ADMETUS.  I called not thee to burial of my dead,  Nor count thy presence here a welcome thing.  My wife shall wear no robe that thou canst bring,  Nor needs thy help in aught. There was a day  We craved thy love, when I was on my way  Deathward--thy love, which bade thee stand aside  And watch, grey-bearded, while a young man died!  And now wilt mourn for her? Thy fatherhood!  Thou wast no true begetter of my blood,  Nor she my mother who dares call me child.  Oh, she was barren ever; she beguiled  Thy folly with some bastard of a thrall.  Here is thy proof! This hour hath shown me all  Thou art; and now I am no more thy son.    'Fore God, among all cowards can scarce be one  Like thee. So grey, so near the boundary  Of mortal life, thou wouldst not, durst not, die  To save thy son! Thou hast suffered her to do  Thine office, her, no kin to me nor you,  Yet more than kin! Henceforth she hath all the part  Of mother, yea, and father in my heart.    And what a glory had been thine that day,  Dying to save thy son--when, either way,  Thy time must needs be brief. Thy life has had  Abundance of the things that make men glad;  A crown that came to thee in youth; a son  To do thee worship and maintain thy throne--  Not like a childless king, whose folk and lands  Lie helpless, to be torn by strangers' hands.    Wilt say I failed in duty to thine age;  For that thou hast let me die? Not so; most sage,  Most pious I was, to mother and to thee;  And thus ye have paid me! Well, I counsel ye.  Lose no more time. Get quick another son  To foster thy last years, to lay thee on  Thy bier, when dead, and wrap thee in thy pall.  _I_ will not bury thee. I am, for all  The care thou hast shown me, dead. If I have found  Another, true to save me at the bound  Of life and death, that other's child am I,  That other's fostering friend, until I die.    How falsely do these old men pray for death,  Cursing their weight of years, their weary breath!  When Death comes close, there is not one that dares  To die; age is forgot and all its cares.    LEADER.  Oh, peace! Enough of sorrow in our path  Is strewn. Thou son, stir not thy father's wrath.    PHERES.  My son, whom seekest thou ... some Lydian thrall,  Or Phrygian, bought with cash?... to affright withal  By cursing? I am a Thessalian, free,  My father a born chief of Thessaly;  And thou most insolent. Yet think not so  To fling thy loud lewd words at me and go.    I got thee to succeed me in my hall,  I have fed thee, clad thee. But I have no call  To die for thee. Not in our family,  Not in all Greece, doth law bid fathers die  To save their sons. Thy road of life is thine  None other's, to rejoice at or repine.  All that was owed to thee by us is paid.  My throne is thine. My broad lands shall be made  Thine, as I had them from my father.... Say,  How have I wronged thee? What have I kept away?  \"Not died for thee?\"... I ask not thee to die.    Thou lovest this light: shall I not love it, I?...  'Tis age on age there, in the dark; and here  My sunlit time is short, but dear; but dear.    Thou hast fought hard enough. Thou drawest breath  Even now, long past thy portioned hour of death,  By murdering her ... and blamest my faint heart,  Coward, who hast let a woman play thy part  And die to save her pretty soldier! Aye,  A good plan, surely! Thou needst never die;  Thou canst find alway somewhere some fond wife  To die for thee. But, prithee, make not strife  With other friends, who will not save thee so.  Be silent, loving thine own life, and know  All men love theirs!... Taunt others, and thou too  Shalt hear much that is bitter, and is true.    LEADER.  Too much of wrath before, too much hath run  After. Old man, cease to revile thy son.    ADMETUS.  Speak on. I have spoken.... If my truth of tongue  Gives pain to thee, why didst thou do me wrong?    PHERES.  Wrong? To have died for thee were far more wrong.    ADMETUS.  How can an old life weigh against a young?    PHERES.  Man hath but one, not two lives, to his use.    ADMETUS.  Oh, live on; live, and grow more old than Zeus!    PHERES.  Because none wrongs thee, thou must curse thy sire?    ADMETUS.  I blest him. Is not life his one desire?    PHERES.  This dead, methinks, is lying in _thy_ place.    ADMETUS.  A proof, old traitor, of thy cowardliness!    PHERES.  Died she through me?... That thou wilt hardly say.    ADMETUS (_almost breaking down_).  O God!  Mayst thou but feel the need of me some day!    PHERES.  Go forward; woo more wives that more may die.    ADMETUS.  As thou wouldst not! Thine is the infamy.    PHERES.  This light of heaven is sweet, and sweet again.    ADMETUS.  Thy heart is foul. A thing unmeet for men.    PHERES.  Thou laugh'st not yet across the old man's tomb.    ADMETUS.  Dishonoured thou shalt die when death shall come.    PHERES.  Once dead, I shall not care what tales are told.    ADMETUS.  Great Gods, so lost to honour and so old!    PHERES.  She was not lost to honour: she was blind.    ADMETUS.  Go! Leave me with my dead.... Out from my mind!    PHERES.  I go. Bury the woman thou hast slain....  Her kinsmen yet may come to thee with plain  Question. Acastus hath small place in good  Men, if he care not for his sister's blood.    [PHERES _goes off, with his Attendants_. ADMETUS _calls after him  as he goes._]    ADMETUS.  Begone, begone, thou and thy bitter mate!  Be old and childless--ye have earned your fate--  While your son lives! For never shall ye be  From henceforth under the same roof with me....  Must I send heralds and a trumpet's call  To abjure thy blood? Fear not, I will send them all....    [PHERES _is now out of sight;_ ADMETUS _drops his defiance and  seems like a broken man._]    But we--our sorrow is upon us; come  With me, and let us bear her to the tomb.    CHORUS.          Ah me!  Farewell, unfalteringly brave!    Farewell, thou generous heart and true!    May Pluto give thee welcome due,  And Hermes love thee in the grave.  Whate'er of blessed life there be    For high souls to the darkness flown,    Be thine for ever, and a throne  Beside the crowned Persephone.    [_The funeral procession has formed and moves slowly out, followed  by_ ADMETUS _and the_ CHORUS. _The stage is left empty, till a  side door of the Castle opens and there comes out a_ SERVANT, _angry  and almost in tears._]    SERVANT.  Full many a stranger and from many a land  Hath lodged in this old castle, and my hand  Served them; but never has there passed this way  A scurvier ruffian than our guest to-day.  He saw my master's grief, but all the more  In he must come, and shoulders through the door.  And after, think you he would mannerly  Take what was set before him? No, not he!  If, on this day of trouble, we left out  Some small thing, he must have it with a shout.  Up, in both hands, our vat of ivy-wood  He raised, and drank the dark grape's burning blood,  Strong and untempered, till the fire was red  Within him; then put myrtle round his head  And roared some noisy song.
