(6)     (5) Cf. \"Anab.\" IV. viii. 28; and so the Georgians to this day      (Chardin ap. Courier, op. cit. p. 70, n. 1).     (6) Lit. \"as are those of the Hellenes.\"    Nor must we omit another topic: how the rider is to accommodate himself  to these several movements. (7) Thus, when the horse breaks off into a  gallop, the rider ought to bend forward, since the horse will be less  likely to slip from under; and so to pitch his rider off. So again in  pulling him up short (8) the rider should lean back; and thus escape a  shock. In leaping a ditch or tearing up a steep incline, it is no bad  plan to let go the reins and take hold of the mane, so that the animal  may not feel the burthen of the bit in addition to that of the ground.  In going down a steep incline the rider must throw himself right back  and hold in the horse with the bit, to prevent himself being hurled  headforemost down the slope himself if not his horse.     (7) Or, \"to each set of occurrences.\"     (8) Al. \"when the horse is being brought to a poise\" (Morgan); and see      Hermann ap. Schneid., {analambanein} = retinere equum, anhalten,      pariren. i.e. \"rein in\" of the \"Parade.\"    It is a correct principle to vary these exercises, which should be gone  through sometimes in one place and sometimes in another, and should  sometimes be shorter and sometimes longer in duration. The horse will  take much more kindly to them if you do not confine him to one place and  one routine.    Since it is a matter of prime necessity that the rider should keep his  seat, while galloping full speed on every sort of ground, and at the  same time be able to use his weapons with effect on horseback, nothing  could be better, where the country suits and there are wild animals,  than to practise horsemanship in combination with the chase. But when  these resources fail, a good exercise may be supplied in the combined  efforts of two horsemen. (9) One of them will play the part of fugitive,  retreating helter-skelter over every sort of ground, with lance reversed  and plying the butt end. The other pursues, with buttons on his javelins  and his lance similarly handled. (10) Whenever he comes within javelin  range he lets fly at the retreating foeman with his blunted missiles; or  whenever within spear thrust he deals the overtaken combatant a blow.  In coming to close quarters, it is a good plan first to drag the foeman  towards oneself, and then on a sudden to thrust him off; that is a  device to bring him to the ground. (11) The correct plan for the man so  dragged is to press his horse forward: by which action the man who is  being dragged is more likely to unhorse his assailant than to be brought  to the ground himself.     (9) {ippota}. A poetic word; \"cavaliers.\"     (10) Or, \"manipulated.\"     (11) Or, \"that may be spoken off as the 'purl trick'\"; \"it will      unhorse him if anything.\"    If it ever happens that you have an enemy's camp in front, and cavalry  skirmishing is the order of the day (at one time charging the enemy  right up to the hostile battle-line, and again beating a retreat),  under these circumstances it is well to bear in mind that so long as the  skirmisher is close to his own party, (12) valour and discretion alike  dictate to wheel and charge in the vanguard might and main; but when he  finds himself in close proximity to the foe, he must keep his horse well  in hand. This, in all probability, will enable him to do the greatest  mischief to the enemy, and to receive least damage at his hands.     (12) See \"Hipparch,\" viii. 23.    The gods have bestowed on man, indeed, the gift of teaching man his duty  by means of speech and reasoning, but the horse, it is obvious, is not  open to instruction by speech and reasoning. If you would have a horse  learn to perform his duty, your best plan will be, whenever he does  as you wish, to show him some kindness in return, and when he is  disobedient to chastise him. This principle, though capable of being  stated in a few words, is one which holds good throughout the whole of  horsemanship. As, for instance, a horse will more readily take the bit,  if each time he accepts it some good befalls him; or, again, he will  leap ditches and spring up embankments and perform all the other feats  incumbent on him, if he be led to associate obedience to the word of  command with relaxation. (13)     (13) Lit. \"if every time he performs the word of command he is led to      expect some relaxation.\"        IX    The topics hitherto considered have been: firstly, how to reduce the  chance of being cheated in the purchase of a colt or full-grown horse;  secondly, how to escape as much as possible the risk of injuring your  purchase by mishandling; and lastly, how to succeed in turning out a  horse possessed of all the qualities demanded by the cavalry soldier for  the purposes of war.    The time has come perhaps to add a few suggestions, in case the rider  should be called upon to deal with an animal either unduly spirited or  again unduly sluggish in disposition. The first point to recognise is,  that temper of spirit in a horse takes the place of passion or anger in  a man; and just as you may best escape exciting a man's ill-temper by  avoiding harshness of speech and act, so you will best avoid enraging a  spirited horse by not annoying him. Thus, from the first instant, in the  act of mounting him, you should take pains to minimise the annoyance;  and once on his back you should sit quiet for longer than the ordinary  time, and so urge him forward by the gentlest signs possible; next,  beginning at the slowest pace, gradually work him into a quicker  step, but so gradually that he will find himself at full speed without  noticing it. (1) Any sudden signal will bewilder a spirited horse, just  as a man is bewildered by any sudden sight or sound or other experience.  (I say one should be aware that any unexpected shock will produce  disturbance in a horse.) (2)     (1) Or, \"so that the horse may insensibly fall into a gallop.\"     (2) L. Dindorf and others bracket, as spurious.    So if you wish to pull up a spirited horse when breaking off into a  quicker pace than requisite, you must not suddenly wrench him, but  quietly and gently bring the bit to bear upon him, coaxing him rather  than compelling him to calm down. It is the long steady course rather  than the frequent turn which tends to calm a horse. (3) A quiet pace  sustained for a long time has a caressing, (4) soothing effect, the  reverse of exciting. If any one proposes by a series of fast and  oft-repeated gallops to produce a sense of weariness in the horse, and  so to tame him, his expectation will not be justified by the result; for  under such circumstances a spirited horse will do his best to carry the  day by main force, (5) and with a show of temper, like a passionate man,  may contrive to bring on himself and his rider irreparable mischief.     (3) Or, \"long stretches rather than a succession of turns and counter      turns,\" {apostrophai}.     (4) Reading {katapsosi} with L. Dind.     (5) {agein bia}, vi agere, vi uti, Sturz; al. \"go his own gait by      sheer force.\"    A spirited horse should be kept in check, so that he does not dash off  at full speed; and on the same principle, you should absolutely abstain  from setting him to race against another; as a general rule, your  fiery-spirited horse is only too fond of contention. (6)     (6) Reading {skhedon gar kai phil oi thum}, or if {... oi thil kai      th.} transl. \"the more eager and ambitious a horse is, the more      mettlesome he will tend to become.\"    Smooth bits are better and more serviceable than rough; if a rough bit  be inserted at all, it must be made to resemble a smooth one as much as  possible by lightness of hand.    It is a good thing also for the rider to accustom himself to keep a  quiet seat, especially when mounted on a spirited horse; and also to  touch him as little as possible with anything except that part of the  body necessary to secure a firm seat.    Again, it should be known that the conventional \"chirrup\" (7) to quiet  and \"cluck\" to rouse a horse are a sort of precept of the training  school; and supposing any one from the beginning chose to associate soft  soothing actions with the \"cluck\" sound, and harsh rousing actions  with the \"chirrup,\" the horse could be taught to rouse himself at the  \"chirrup\" and to calm himself at the \"cluck\" sound. On this principle,  at the sound of the trumpet or the shout of battle the rider should  avoid coming up to his charger in a state of excitement, or, indeed,  bringing any disturbing influence to bear on the animal. As far  as possible, at such a crisis he should halt and rest him; and, if  circumstances permit, give him his morning or his evening meal. But the  best advice of all is not to get an over-spirited horse for the purposes  of war.     (7) Al. \"whistling,\" and see Berenger, ii. 68. {poppusmos}, a sound      from the lips; {klogmos}, from the cheek.    As to the sluggish type of animal, I need only suggest to do everything  the opposite to what we advise as appropriate in dealing with an animal  of high spirit.        X    But possibly you are not content with a horse serviceable for war. You  want to find in him a showy, attractive animal, with a certain grandeur  of bearing. If so, you must abstain from pulling at his mouth with the  bit, or applying the spur and whip--methods commonly adopted by people  with a view to a fine effect, though, as a matter of fact, they thereby  achieve the very opposite of what they are aiming at. That is to say,  by dragging the mouth up they render the horse blind instead of alive  to what is in front of him;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11772"],[0,"Narrative of a Voyage to Senegal in 1816 (#6)"],[1,"it was given up, because the means employed were  insufficient. More care should have been used, and all the difficulties  would have been conquered; only half measures were adopted, and in all the  manoeuvres great want of decision prevailed.[B2]    If the frigate had been lightened as soon as we struck, perhaps she might  have been saved.[18] The weather, however, as we have already said, was  almost always unfavourable, and often hindered the operations.    Some persons expected to see the frigate got afloat the next day, and their  joy shewed that they were fully persuaded of it: there were indeed some  probabilities, but they were very slight; for the vessel had been merely  got out of its bed. We had hardly succeeded in changing its place to a  distance of about two hundred metres, when the sea began to ebb: the  frigate rested on the sand, which obliged us to suspend for ever our last  operations. If it had been possible to hold her this night to two or three  cables more in the open sea, still lightening her, perhaps, we repeat it,  she might have been placed out of danger.    At night the sky became cloudy, the winds came from the sea, and blew  violently. The sea ran high, and the frigate began to heel with more and  more violence, every moment we expected to see her bulge; consternation  again spread, and we soon felt the cruel certainty that she was  irrecoverably lost.[B3] She bulged in the middle of the night, the keel  broke in two, the helm was unship'd, and held to the stern only by the  chains, which caused it to do dreadful damage; it produced the effect of a  strong horizontal ram, which violently impelled by the waves, continually  struck the poop of the ship; the whole back part of the captain's cabin was  beat in, the water entered in an alarming manner. About eleven o'clock  there was a kind of mutiny, which was afterwards checked by the presence of  the governor and the officers; it was excited by some soldiers, who  persuaded their comrades that it was intended to abandon them on board the  frigate, while the crew escaped in the boats; these alarms were excited by  the imprudence of a young man; some soldiers had already taken their arms,  and had ranged themselves on the deck, all the avenues to which they  occupied.    The raft, impelled by the strength of the current and of the sea, broke the  cable which fastened it to the frigate and began to drive; those who beheld  this accident announced it by their cries, and a boat was immediately sent  after it, which brought it back. This was a distressing night for us all;  agitated by the idea that our frigate was totally lost, and alarmed by the  violent shocks which it received from the waves, we were unable to take a  moment's repose.    At day-break, on the 5th, there were two metres seventy centimetres water  in the hold, and the pumps could no longer work with effect: it was decided  we ought to quit the vessel as soon as possible. The frigate, it was said,  threatened to upset; a childish fear, doubtless; but, what particularly  made it absolutely necessary to abandon her, was, that the water had  already penetrated between decks. A quantity of biscuit was hastily taken  from the store-room; wine and fresh water were also got out; these  provisions were intended to be placed in the boats and on the raft. To  preserve the biscuit from the salt water it was put into strong iron hooped  barrels, which were perfectly fit for the purpose. We are ignorant why  these provisions, so carefully prepared were not embarked either on the  raft or in the boats; the precipitation with which we embarked was the  cause of this negligence, so that some boats did not save above twenty-four  pounds of biscuit, a small cask of water and very little wine: the rest was  abandoned on the deck of the frigate or thrown into the sea during the  tumult of the evacuation. The raft alone had a pretty large quantity of  wine, but not a single barrel of biscuit, and if any was put upon it, it  was thrown off by the soldiers when they placed themselves upon it. To  avoid confusion, there was made, the day before, a list of the persons who  were to embark, assigning to every one the post he was to occupy; but no  attention was paid to this wise arrangement; every one took the means which  he thought the most favorable to reach the shore; those who executed the  orders which they had received to place themselves on the raft, had  certainly reason to repent it. Mr. Savigny was unfortunately of this  number; he might have stopped on board a boat, but an invincible attachment  to his duty made him forget the danger of the part which was allotted him.    At length, the moment when we were to abandon the frigate arrived. First,  the soldiers were embarked, who were almost all placed upon the raft: they  wanted to take their muskets and some cartridges: this was formally  opposed.[19] They left them on the deck, and preserved only their sabres:  some few, however, saved their carbines, and, almost all the officers,  their fowling pieces and pistols. In all, we were about one hundred and  forty-seven or one hundred and fifty; such is pretty nearly the account of  the persons who embarked on this fatal machine, one hundred and twenty  soldiers, including the officers of the army, twenty-nine men, sailors and  passengers, and one woman. The barge, commanded by a lieutenant, on board  of which were the governor and his family, took in thirty-five persons in  all: this large fourteen-oared vessel, could certainly have carried a  larger number: besides the people, there were three trunks; another  fourteen-oared boat took in forty-two persons; the captain's barge took  twenty-eight; the long boat, though in a very bad condition, destitute of  oars, took in, however, eighty-eight; an eight-oared boat which was to be  left at Senegal, for the service of the port, took twenty-five sailors; the  smallest of the boats had fifteen persons on board; among whom were the  interesting family of Mr. Picard, of whom we have spoken above: it was  composed of three young ladies, his wife, and four young children. All  these numbers added together, form a total of three hundred and  ninety-seven persons;[20] there were on board the frigate, near four  hundred sailors and soldiers: thus it appears that several poor wretches  were abandoned; when the Medusa was again found, fifty-two days after, it  was ascertained that the number of those, who had been abandoned, was  seventeen; which proves to us, that there were more than one hundred and  forty seven of us on the raft, and that it is more correct to fix the  number of the men at a hundred and fifty. It is said, that when the last  boat, which was the long boat, left the frigate, several men refused to  embark in her; the others were too much intoxicated to think of their  safety. A man of the name of Dales, one of the seventeen who remained on  board the frigate, deposed in the council, that fourteen men had left the  long boat, because they did not think it capable of carrying so many, and  that he, with two others hid themselves, that they might not be compelled  to go on board. We are ignorant of the depositions of his two companions.    What a sight was it to behold a multitude of wretches, who all wanted to  escape death, and all sought to save themselves, either in the boats or  upon the rafts! The frigate's ladder was insufficient for so many: some  threw themselves from the vessels, trusting to the end of a rope, which was  scarcely able to bear a man's weight; some fell into the sea, and were  recovered; what is surprising is, that amidst all this confusion, there was  not a single serious accident.    Though in so terrible a situation, on our fatal raft, we cast our eyes upon  the frigate, and deeply regretted this fine vessel, which, a few days  before, seemed to command the waves, which it cut through with astonishing  rapidity. The masts, which had supported immense sails, no longer existed,  the barricade was entirely destroyed: the vessel itself was cast on the  larboard quarter.    All the boats, after they had sheered off, proceeded in different manners,  as we shall afterwards relate; but the men on board, when they reached the  shore, had to contend with a thousand causes of destruction. We will first  exactly relate all the operations that were executed till the moment when  the raft was abandoned.    About seven o'clock, the signal for departure was given; four of the boats  stood out to sea, the raft was still along side of the frigate, where it  was moored: the captain's barge was under the bowsprit and the barge near  our machine, on which it had just embarked some men. At length we were  ordered to depart; but whether from a presentiment of what was to happen to  us, or whether Mr. Correard entertained just fears, which the event proved  to be but too well founded, he would not depart, till he had convinced  himself that our raft was provided with all the necessary instruments and  charts, to navigate with some degree of safety in case bad weather should  oblige the boats to separate from us. As it was impossible to move upon the  raft, because we were so crowded together he thought it the easiest to call  to Mr. ---- who immediately answered to his call. Coming to the larboard,  he asked what we wanted?  The following questions were then put to him:  \"Are we in a condition to depart?  Have we instruments and charts?\" Yes,  yes, replied he, \"I have provided you with every thing that can be  necessary for you.\" He was then asked, what naval officer was to come and  command us? he answered: \"It is I; in a moment I shall be with you.\" After  saying this he disappeared, and went on board one of the boats.    How is it possible that a French sea officer should be guilty of such bad  faith to his unhappy countrymen, who placed all their confidence in him?    At last, the barge came to the head of the frigate, and the "]]]
