This elation made  him reckless as he went about, probing the experiences of each  victim.    \"Great stuff!\" \"Great stuff!\" he kept exclaiming. \"Won't this open up  some eyes in Chicago, eh!\"    He couldn't believe that the Providence which had led him to this  Bonanza would now deny him the opportunity of getting out some  of this wealth.    In the midst of these activities he was haled before the tribunal. He  returned, the spring out of his step and his zest for stories quite  gone. Javert had successively branded him an \"Idiot\" a \"Liar\" and  a \"Spy.\"    The information that several of the inmates had been imprisoned  for a month or more spurred my drooping spirits and put me into  action. I uncovered a pile of the office writing-paper and, with the  aid of the Belgian who could speak English, I set to work preparing  a letter to Ambassador Whitlock. Whether Javert was apprised of  the doings of his charges or not I do not know, but in the midst of  my writing he glided into the room, and, pouncing upon my  manuscript, gathered it to himself, saying, \"I'll take these.\" My  Belgian friend protested that a superior officer had given me  permission to do this. Javert handed back the paper, smiled, and  disappeared. Knowing that every word would be closely scrutinized  at the Staff Office, and that the least hint of anything derogatory to  the German authorities would keep the letter in the building, I couched  it in as pointed and telling terms as possible, having in mind the  eyes of the Germans, quite as much as the Ambassador.      Brand Whitlock,  United States Ambassador,  Brussels.    DEAR SIR:    As a native American citizen, born in Ohio, and now imprisoned by  the German authorities, I claim your intervention in my behalf. I am  thirty years of age, resident of East Boston, Massachusetts, for six  years. I am a graduate of Marietta College, Hartford Seminary, and  studied in Cambridge University in England, and Marburg  University in Germany.    Saturday Mr. Van Hee, the American consul at Ghent, brought me  here by automobile with Mr. Fletcher. Obliged to take back in his  car three ladies for whom he obtained permission from the  German Government, I was necessarily left behind; Mr. Van Hee  promising to return for me when diplomatic business brought him  to Brussels in a few days. Meantime I took a room at the Hotel  Metropole. From it I was taken by the German authorities this  morning. I do not know exactly what the charge against me is. I am  accused of offering money for information relative to the  movement of the German troops. I think that the man who worked  up the case against me is a Dutchman with whom I spoke upon a  car. He volunteered the information that he had been everywhere  by automobile; and I asked him if he was the one who carried  passengers out of Brussels by way of Liege and Aix-la-Chapelle.  Won't you look into my case at once? Mr. Fletcher, who called on  you Saturday, lent me some fifty dollars, so I am all right that way;  but this is not a comfortable situation to be in, though the officers  are very decent. If you want proof of my identity, you can  communicate with the following people in America; they are my  personal friends, and will confirm my absence from home on an  extended vacation.    His Excellency Governor Walsh, of the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts; Dr. Charles Fleischer, Chief Rabbi in the  Rabbinate of New England.    (If there was any Jewish blood on the German Staff I was going to  try to get the benefit of it.)    The Honorable George W. Coleman, of the Ford Hall Convocation  Meetings and President of the Pilgrim Amalgamated Associated  Advertising Clubs of America.    (Coleman being a cross between a Baptist deacon and an  anarchist, I knew that he would not object to this bit of sabotage.)    The Right Honorable William W. Mills, Esquire, President of the  First National Bank of Marietta, Ohio, Treasurer of the University of  Marietta, and Member of the National Council of Congregational  Churches of America, etc., etc.    If you will cablegram any of these, you will get an immediate reply.  While I have no money for this now, I feel certain Mr. Fletcher, who  is associated with Mr. Lane, of the United States Cabinet, will back  you up, and there will be unlimited funds in America.    Sincerely yours, ALBERT R. WILLIAMS.      My attention has been called to the omission of the Angel Gabriel,  Mary Pickford and Ty Cobb from the list of my intimate friends in  the above document. That was not meant as a slight--purely an  oversight. At any rate, I felt that the long list of men whose names  were written here would make the right response to any cablegram.  To atone for dragging them into the affray I call attention to the highly  deferential and decorative manner in which I referred to them.  Be it remembered that this document was prepared quite as  much for German eyes as for the Ambassador's, and nothing  gives a man standing and respect in the Teutonic mind as much  as a name fearfully and wonderfully adorned. I resolved that my  importance was not to suffer from lack of glory in my friends.  I bestowed more honorary degrees on them than the average  small college does in ten commencements. So lavish was I that  my friends hardly recognize their own titular selves. An officer  designated the guard who would deliver the letter. I gave it to  him along with a franc, which he protestingly accepted. He reported  that it was delivered to Javert. That was the last I ever heard from  that message. I imagine that it was by no means the last that the  German authorities heard from it, for when I related the story to  the Ambassador some time later I saw a characteristic Brand  Whitlock letter a-brewing. My message to Vice-Consul Naesmith  and to the Hotel Metropole shared a like fate--they were undelivered.    I simply offer the facts as they are. It may be that the courtesies of  polite intercourse are not easy to observe in war. Certainly they  were not obtrusive in Belgium. In extenuation it may be said that  the Brussels postmen had struck about this time; but, on the other  hand, through the forbidden shutters I saw fully fifty German Boy  Scouts marshaled in the courtyard below.    I had noticed them before as messengers going down the most  unguarded by-ways of the slums, quite as if they were agents of a  welcomed instead of hated army. They rode along serenely as if  totally unconscious of the shining targets that they made. I felt  certain that no American gang would let slip this opportunity for the  heaving of a brick. Were Brussels boys made of flabbier stuff? Not  if Belgian sons were of the same stripe as Belgian fathers. The fact  then that none of these German Scouts were massacred, as was  to be expected by all the rules of the game, showed how the threat  of reprisals operated to curb the strongest natural impulses of the  spirit. I presumed that one of these Scouts was speeding  posthaste to the Ambassador with my note, but he never did.    I am not berating the Germans. They were running their own war  according to their own code. In this code reporters, onlookers, and  uplifters of any brand were anathema.    We had no rights. Our only right was to the convictions within our  minds, provided we kept them there. I believe that were it not for  the surmises of the English lieutenant who took them to the  Ambassador I would be in prison yet. On second thought, I  wouldn't, either. I couldn't have endured the strain much longer. If I  had been caged in there a few hours more than I was, in my  nervous tension I probably would have vented my sense of  outraged justice by assaulting one of the officers myself. I wouldn't  have had a long time then to speculate upon the immortality of the  soul. I would have possessed first-hand information. One can  understand why, for their own protection, the Germans imposed  their iron laws upon the Belgians with their terrible penalties. What  is hard to understand is the long-suffering patience and self-  restraint of the Belgians. Occasionally some high-spirited or high-  strung fellow was no longer able to keep the lid on the volcano of  hatred and rage seething within him. This blowup brought down,  not only upon his own head, but upon the whole community, the  most hideous reprisals.    By the time my writing was completed the men were pretty well  settled down for the night. On the outside the roaring of the  Austrian guns, which for days had been bombarding their way into  Antwerp, now became less constant; less and less frequently the  hoarse commands of the officers, mingled with the rumbling of the  automobiles, came up from the courtyard below. At midnight the  only sounds were the groans and moans of the twisting sleepers  and the measured tread of the sentry as he paced up and down  the hall, his silhouette darkening at regular intervals the glass door  at the end of our little room.    I was placed in a. sort of adjoining closet with six others. A motley  mixture indeed; a Russian, an American, four Belgians, and a  German--all prisoners awaiting our sentences. As a last move, the  German soldier guards sandwiched themselves into the open  spaces on the floor, their long bayonets glistening in the electric  light that blazed down upon us. The peasants had characteristically  closed the windows to keep out the baneful night air. In the main  room a drop-light with shade flung its radiance on a table and lit up  the anxious faces of the few men gathered round it. It showed one  poor fellow bolt upright, unspeaking, unmoving, his fixed white  eyeballs staring into space, as though he would go stark mad.

He lived in \"the castle  at Walworth.\" Wemmick at \"the castle\" and Wemmick in business are two  \"different beings.\"      Wemmick's house was a little wooden cottage,    in the midst of plots of garden, and the top of    it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted    with guns.... It was the smallest of houses,    with queer Gothic windows (by far the greater    part of them sham), and a Gothic door, almost    too small to get in at.... On Sundays he ran    up a real flag.... The bridge was a plank, and    it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two    deep....

A'GIB (_King_), \"The Third Calender\" (_Arabian Nights'  Entertainments_). He was wrecked on the loadstone mountain, which  drew all the nails and iron bolts from his ship; but he overthrew  the bronze statue on the mountain-top, which was the cause of the  mischief. Agib visited the ten young men, each of whom had lost  the right eye, and was carried by a roc to the palace of the forty  princesses, with whom he tarried a year. The princesses were then  obliged to leave for forty days, but entrusted him with the keys of  the palace, with free permission to enter every room but one. On the  fortieth day curiosity induced him to open this room, where he saw a  horse, which he mounted, and was carried through the air to Bag dad.  The horse then deposited him, and knocked out his right eye with a  whisk of its tail, as it had done the ten \"young men\" above referred  to.

Agnes is a very pure, self-sacrificing girl, accomplished, yet  domestic.--C. Dickens, _David Copperfield_ (1849).    AGNES, in Moliere's _L'Ecole des Femmes_, the girl on whom Arnolphe  tries his pet experiment of education, so as to turn out for himself  a \"model wife.\" She is brought up in a country convent, where she  is kept in entire ignorance of the difference of sex, conventional  proprieties, the difference between the love of men and women, and  that of girls for girls, the mysteries of marriage, and so on. When  grown to womanhood she quits the convent, and standing one evening on  a balcony a young man passes and takes off his hat to her, she returns  the salute; he bows a second and third time, she does the same; he  passes and repasses several times, bowing each time, and she does as  she has been taught to do by acknowledging the salute. Of course,  the young man (_Horace_) becomes her lover, whom she marries, and M.  Arnolphe loses his \"model wife.\" (See PINCH-WIFE.)    _Elle fait l'Agnes._ She pretends to be wholly unsophisticated and  verdantly ingenuous.--_French Proverb_ (from the \"Agnes\" of Moliere,  _L'Ecole des Femmes_, 1662).    _Agnes_ (_Black_), the countess of March, noted for her defence of  Dunbar against the English.    _Black Agnes_, the palfry of Mary queen of Scots, the gift of her  brother Moray, and so called from the noted countess of March, who was  countess of Moray (Murray) in her own right.    _Agnes_ (_St._), a young virgin of Palermo, who at the age of thirteen  was martyred at Rome during the Diocletian persecution of A.D. 304.

St. Agnes, having escaped from the prison  at Rome, took shipping and landed at St. Piran Arwothall.

The scene of the story is laid in Sorrento, Italy.    AGRAMAN'TE (4 _syl_.) or AG'RAMANT, king of the Moors, in _Orlando  Innamorato_, by Bojardo, and _Orlando Furioso_, by Ariosto.    AGRAWAIN (_Sir_) or SIR AGRAVAIN, surnamed \"The Desirous,\" and also  \"The Haughty.\" He was son of Lot (king of Orkney) and Margawse  half-sister of king Arthur. His brothers were sir Gaw'ain, sir  Ga'heris, and sir Gareth. Mordred was his half-brother, being the son  of king Arthur and Margawse. Sir Agravain and sir Mordred hated sir  Launcelot, and told the king he was too familiar with the queen; so  they asked the king to spend the day in hunting, and kept watch. The  queen sent for sir Launcelot to her private chamber, and sir Agravain,  sir Mordred, and twelve others assailed the door, but sir Launcelot  slew them all except sir Mordred, who escaped.--Sir T. Malory,  _History of Prince Arthur_, iii. 142-145 (1470).    AGRICA'NE (4 _syl._), king of Tartary, in the _Orlando Innamorato_, of  Bojardo.

AGRICOLA FUSILIER, a pompous old creole, a conserver of family  traditions, and patriot who figures in George W. Cable's  _Grandissimes_ (1880).      He seemed to fancy himself haranguing a    crowd; made another struggle for intelligence,    tried once, twice to speak, and the third time    succeeded: \"Louis--_Louisian--a--for--ever!_\"    and lay still. They put those two words on his    tomb.    AG'RIOS, Lumpishness personified; a \"sullen swain, all mirth that in  himself and others hated; dull, dead, and leaden.\" Described in canto  viii. of _The Purple Island_, by Phineas Fletcher (1635).

AGUE-CHEEK _(Sir Andrew_), a silly old fop with \"3000 ducats a year,\"  very fond of the table, but with a shrewd understanding that \"beef had  done harm to his wit.\" Sir Andrew thinks himself \"old in nothing but  in understanding,\" and boasts that he can cut a caper, dance the  coranto, walk a jig, and take delight in masques, like a young  man.--Shakespeare, _Twelfth Night_ (1614).    Woodward (1737-1777) always sustained \"sir Andrew Ague-cheek\" with  infinite drollery, assisted by that expression of \"rueful dismay,\"  which gave so peculiar a zest to his _Marplot_.--Boaden, _Life of  Siddons_ Charles Lamb says that \"Jem White saw James Dodd one evening  in _Ague-cheek_, and recognizing him next day in Fleet Street, took  off his hat, and saluted him with 'Save you, sir Andrew!' Dodd simply  waved his hand and exclaimed, 'Away, fool!'\"    A'HABACK AND DES'RA, two enchanters, who aided Ahu'bal in his  rebellion against his brother Misnar, sultan of Delhi. Ahu'bal had a  magnificent tent built, and Horam the vizier had one built for the  sultan still more magnificent. When the rebels made their attack, the  sultan and the best of the troops were drawn off, and the sultan's  tent was taken. The enchanters, delighted with their prize, slept  therein, but at night the vizier led the sultan to a cave, and asked  him to cut a rope. Next morning he heard that a huge stone had fallen  on the enchanters and crushed them to a mummy. In fact, this stone  formed the head of the bed, where it was suspended by the rope which  the sultan had severed in the night.--James Ridley, _Tales of the  Genii_ (\"The Enchanters' Tale,\" vi.).
