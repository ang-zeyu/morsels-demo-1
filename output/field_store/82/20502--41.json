The army operating against Suez numbered about one hundred and fifty  thousand men. Of these about twenty thousand were Anatolian  Turks--trained soldiers, splendid fighting material, as was shown by  their resistance at the Dardanelles. The rest were Palestinian Arabs,  and very inferior troops they were. The Arab as a soldier is at once  stupid and cunning: fierce when victory is on his side, but unreliable  when things go against him. In command of the expedition was the famous  Djemal Pasha, a Young Turk general of tremendous energy, but possessing  small ability to see beyond details to the big, broad concepts of  strategy. Although a great friend of Enver Pasha, he looked with  disfavor on the German officers and, in particular, on Bach Pasha, the  German Governor of Jerusalem, with whom he had serious disagreements.  This dislike of the Germans was reflected among the lesser Turkish  officers. Many of these, after long years of service, found themselves  subordinated to young foreigners, who, in addition to arbitrary  promotion, received much higher salaries than the Turks. What is more,  they were paid in clinking gold, whereas the Turks, when paid at all,  got paper currency.    Beersheba, a prosperous town of the ancient province of Idumea, was the  southern base of operations for the advance on Suez. Some of our  villagers had been sent to this district, and, in searching for them, I  had the opportunity of seeing at least the taking-off place of the  expedition. Beyond this point no Jew or Christian was allowed to pass,  with the exception of the physicians, all of whom were non-Mohammedans  who had been forced into the army.    Beersheba was swarming with troops. They filled the town and overflowed  on to the sands outside, where a great tent-city grew up. And everywhere  that the Turkish soldiers went, disorganization and inefficiency  followed them. From all over the country the finest camels had been  \"requisitioned\" and sent down to Beersheba until, at the time I was  there, thousands and thousands of them were collected in the  neighborhood. Through the laziness and stupidity of the Turkish  commissariat officers, which no amount of German efficiency could  counteract, no adequate provision was made for feeding them, and  incredible numbers succumbed to starvation and neglect. Their great  carcasses dotted the sand in all directions; it was only the wonderful  antiseptic power of the Eastern sun that held pestilence in check.    The soldiers themselves suffered much hardship. The crowding in the  tents was unspeakable; the water-supply was almost as inadequate as the  medical service, which consisted chiefly of volunteer Red Crescent  societies--among them a unit of twenty German nurses sent by the  American College at Beirut. Medical supplies, such as they were, had  been taken from the different mission hospitals and pharmacies of  Palestine--these \"requisitions\" being made by officers who knew nothing  of medical requirements and simply scooped together everything in sight.  As a result, one of the army physicians told me that in Beersheba he had  opened some medical chests consigned to him and found, to his horror,  that they were full of microscopes and gynecological instruments--for  the care of wounded soldiers in the desert!    Visits of British aeroplanes to Beersheba were common occurrences. Long  before the machine itself could be seen, its whanging, resonant hum  would come floating out of the blazing sky, seemingly from everywhere at  once. Soldiers rushed from their tents, squinting up into the heavens  until the speck was discovered, swimming slowly through the air; then  followed wholesale firing at an impossible range until the officers  forbade it. True to the policy of avoiding all unnecessary harm to the  natives, these British aviators never dropped bombs on the town,  but--what was more dangerous from the Turkish point of view--they would  unload packages of pamphlets, printed in Arabic, informing the natives  that they were being deceived; that the Allies were their only true  friends; that the Germans were merely making use of them to further  their own schemes, etc. These cleverly worded little tracts came  showering down out of the sky, and at first they were eagerly picked up.  The Turkish commanders, however, soon announced that any one found  carrying them would pay the death penalty. After that, when the little  bundles dropped near them, the natives would, run as if from high  explosive bombs.    All things considered, it is wonderful that the Turkish demonstration  against the Canal came as near to fulfillment as it did. Twenty thousand  soldiers actually crossed the desert in six days on scant rations, and  with them they took two big guns, which they dragged by hand when the  mules dropped from thirst and exhaustion. They also carried pontoons to  be used in crossing the Canal. Guns and pontoons are now at rest in the  Museum at Cairo.    Just what took place in the attack is known to very few. The English  have not seen fit to make public the details, and there was little to be  got from the demoralized soldiers who returned to Beersheba. Piece by  piece, however, I gathered that the attacking party had come up to the  Canal at dawn. Finding everything quiet, they set about getting across,  and had even launched a pontoon, when the British, who were lying in  wait, opened a terrific fire from the farther bank, backed by armored  locomotives and aeroplanes. \"It was as if the gates of Jehannum were  opened and its fires turned loose upon us,\" one soldier told me.    The Turks succeeded in getting their guns into action for a very short  while. One of the men-of-war in the Canal was hit; several houses in  Ismailia suffered damage; but the invaders were soon driven away in  confusion, leaving perhaps two thousand prisoners in the hands of the  English. If the latter had chosen to do so, they could have annihilated  the Turkish forces then and there. The ticklish state of mind of the  Mohammedan population in Egypt, however, has led them to adopt a policy  of leniency and of keeping to the defensive, which subsequent  developments have more than justified. It is characteristic of England's  faculty for holding her colonies that batteries manned by Egyptians did  the finest work in defense of the Canal.    The reaction in Palestine after the defeat at Suez was tremendous. Just  before the attack, Djemal Pasha had sent out a telegram announcing the  overwhelming defeat of the British vanguard, which had caused wild  enthusiasm. Another later telegram proclaimed that the Canal had been  reached, British men-of-war sunk, the Englishmen routed--with a loss to  the Turks of five men and two camels, \"which were afterwards recovered.\"  \"But,\" added the telegram, \"a terrible sand-storm having arisen, the  glorious army takes it as the wish of Allah not to continue the attack,  and has therefore withdrawn in triumph.\"    These reports hoodwinked the ignorant natives for a little while, but  when the stream of haggard soldiers, wounded and exhausted, began  pouring back from the south, they guessed what had happened, and a  fierce revulsion against the Germano-Turkish regime set in. A few weeks  before the advance on Suez, I was in Jaffa, where the enthusiasm and  excitement had been at fever-pitch. Parades and celebrations of all  kinds in anticipation of the triumphal march into Egypt were taking  place, and one day a camel, a dog, and a bull, decorated respectively  with the flags of Russia, France, and England, were driven through the  streets. The poor animals were horribly maltreated by the natives, who  rained blows and flung filth upon them by way of giving concrete  expression to their contempt for the Allies. Mr. Glazebrook, the  American Consul at Jerusalem, happened to be with me in Jaffa that day;  and never shall I forget the expression of pain and disgust on his face  as he watched this melancholy little procession of scapegoats hurrying  along the street.    Now, however, all was changed. The Arabs, who take defeat badly, turned  against the authorities who had got them into such trouble. Rumors  circulated that Djemal Pasha had been bought by the English and that the  defeat at Suez had been planned by him, and persons keeping an ear close  to the ground began to hear mutterings of a general massacre of Germans.  In fact, things came within an ace of a bloody outbreak. I knew some  Germans in Jaffa and Haifa who firmly believed that it was all over with  them. In the defeated army itself the Turkish officers gave vent to  their hatred of the Germans. Three German officers were shot by their  Turkish comrades during the retreat, and a fourth committed suicide.  However, Djemal Pasha succeeded in keeping order by means of stern  repressive methods and by the fear roused by his large body-guard of  faithful Anatolians.    [ILLUSTRATION: RAILROAD STATION SCENE BETWEEN HAIFA AND DAMASCUS/CAMELS  BRINGING IN NEWLY CUT TREES, DAMASCUS]    We felt sure that the Turkish defeat would put a damper on the arrogance  of the soldiery. But even the Mohammedan population were hoping that the  Allies would push their victory and land troops in Syria and Palestine;  for though they hated the infidel, they loved the Turk not at all, and  the country was exhausted and the blockade of the Mediterranean by the  Allies prevented the import and export of articles. The oranges were  rotting on the trees because the annual Liverpool market was closed to  Palestine, and other crops were in similar case. The country was short,  too, of petroleum, sugar, rice, and other supplies, and even of matches.  We had to go back to old customs and use flint and steel for fire, and  we seldom used our lamps.

'He can't use his hands much more  than you can--take your time, Joe--try to remember something I told you,  for God's sake!'    When two men fight who don't know how to use their hands, they stand a  show of knocking each other about a lot. I got some awful thumps,  but mostly on the body. Jimmy Nowlett began to get excited and jump  round--he was an excitable little fellow.    'Fight! you----!' he yelled. 'Why don't you fight? That ain't fightin'.  Fight, and don't try to murder each other. Use your crimson hands or, by  God, I'll chip you! Fight, or I'll blanky well bullock-whip the pair of  you;' then his language got awful. They said we went like windmills, and  that nearly every one of the blows we made was enough to kill a bullock  if it had got home. Jimmy stopped us once, but they held him back.    Presently I went down pretty flat, but the blow was well up on the head  and didn't matter much--I had a good thick skull. And I had one good eye  yet.    'For God's sake, hit him!' whispered Jack--he was trembling like a leaf.  'Don't mind what I told you. I wish I was fighting him myself! Get a  blow home, for God's sake! Make a good show this round and I'll stop the  fight.'    That showed how little even Jack, my old mate, understood me.    I had the Bushman up in me now, and wasn't going to be beaten while  I could think. I was wonderfully cool, and learning to fight. There's  nothing like a fight to teach a man. I was thinking fast, and learning  more in three seconds than Jack's sparring could have taught me in three  weeks. People think that blows hurt in a fight, but they don't--not  till afterwards. I fancy that a fighting man, if he isn't altogether an  animal, suffers more mentally than he does physically.    While I was getting my wind I could hear through the moonlight and still  air the sound of Mary's voice singing up at the house. I thought hard  into the future, even as I fought. The fight only seemed something that  was passing.    I was on my feet again and at it, and presently I lunged out and felt  such a jar in my arm that I thought it was telescoped. I thought I'd put  out my wrist and elbow. And Romany was lying on the broad of his back.    I heard Jack draw three breaths of relief in one. He said nothing as  he straightened me up, but I could feel his heart beating. He said  afterwards that he didn't speak because he thought a word might spoil  it.    I went down again, but Jack told me afterwards that he FELT I was all  right when he lifted me.    Then Romany went down, then we fell together, and the chaps separated  us. I got another knock-down blow in, and was beginning to enjoy the  novelty of it, when Romany staggered and limped.    'I've done,' he said. 'I've twisted my ankle.' He'd caught his heel  against a tuft of grass.    'Shake hands,' yelled Jimmy Nowlett.    I stepped forward, but Romany took his coat and limped to his horse.    'If yer don't shake hands with Wilson, I'll lamb yer!' howled Jimmy; but  Jack told him to let the man alone, and Romany got on his horse somehow  and rode off.    I saw Jim Bullock stoop and pick up something from the grass, and heard  him swear in surprise. There was some whispering, and presently Jim  said--    'If I thought that, I'd kill him.'    'What is it?' asked Jack.    Jim held up a butcher's knife. It was common for a man to carry a  butcher's knife in a sheath fastened to his belt.    'Why did you let your man fight with a butcher's knife in his belt?'  asked Jimmy Nowlett.    But the knife could easily have fallen out when Romany fell, and we  decided it that way.    'Any way,' said Jimmy Nowlett, 'if he'd stuck Joe in hot blood before us  all it wouldn't be so bad as if he sneaked up and stuck him in the back  in the dark. But you'd best keep an eye over yer shoulder for a year or  two, Joe. That chap's got Eye-talian blood in him somewhere. And now the  best thing you chaps can do is to keep your mouth shut and keep all this  dark from the gals.'    Jack hurried me on ahead. He seemed to act queer, and when I glanced  at him I could have sworn that there was water in his eyes. I said that  Jack had no sentiment except for himself, but I forgot, and I'm sorry I  said it.    'What's up, Jack?' I asked.    'Nothing,' said Jack.    'What's up, you old fool?' I said.    'Nothing,' said Jack, 'except that I'm damned proud of you, Joe, you  old ass!' and he put his arm round my shoulders and gave me a shake.  'I didn't know it was in you, Joe--I wouldn't have said it before,  or listened to any other man say it, but I didn't think you had the  pluck--God's truth, I didn't. Come along and get your face fixed up.'    We got into my room quietly, and Jack got a dish of water, and told one  of the chaps to sneak a piece of fresh beef from somewhere.    Jack was as proud as a dog with a tin tail as he fussed round me.  He fixed up my face in the best style he knew, and he knew a good  many--he'd been mended himself so often.    While he was at work we heard a sudden hush and a scraping of feet  amongst the chaps that Jack had kicked out of the room, and a girl's  voice whispered, 'Is he hurt? Tell me. I want to know,--I might be able  to help.'    It made my heart jump, I can tell you. Jack went out at once, and there  was some whispering. When he came back he seemed wild.    'What is it, Jack?' I asked.    'Oh, nothing,' he said, 'only that damned slut of a half-caste cook  overheard some of those blanky fools arguing as to how Romany's knife  got out of the sheath, and she's put a nice yarn round amongst the  girls. There's a regular bobbery, but it's all right now. Jimmy  Nowlett's telling 'em lies at a great rate.'    Presently there was another hush outside, and a saucer with vinegar and  brown paper was handed in.    One of the chaps brought some beer and whisky from the pub, and we had  a quiet little time in my room. Jack wanted to stay all night, but I  reminded him that his little wife was waiting for him in Solong, so he  said he'd be round early in the morning, and went home.    I felt the reaction pretty bad. I didn't feel proud of the affair at  all. I thought it was a low, brutal business all round. Romany was a  quiet chap after all, and the chaps had no right to chyack him. Perhaps  he'd had a hard life, and carried a big swag of trouble that we didn't  know anything about. He seemed a lonely man. I'd gone through enough  myself to teach me not to judge men. I made up my mind to tell him how I  felt about the matter next time we met. Perhaps I made my usual mistake  of bothering about 'feelings' in another party that hadn't any feelings  at all--perhaps I didn't; but it's generally best to chance it on the  kind side in a case like this. Altogether I felt as if I'd made another  fool of myself and been a weak coward. I drank the rest of the beer and  went to sleep.    About daylight I woke and heard Jack's horse on the gravel. He came  round the back of the buggy-shed and up to my door, and then, suddenly,  a girl screamed out. I pulled on my trousers and 'lastic-side boots and  hurried out. It was Mary herself, dressed, and sitting on an old stone  step at the back of the kitchen with her face in her hands, and Jack was  off his horse and stooping by her side with his hand on her shoulder.  She kept saying, 'I thought you were----! I thought you were----!' I  didn't catch the name. An old single-barrel, muzzle-loader shot-gun was  lying in the grass at her feet. It was the gun they used to keep loaded  and hanging in straps in a room of the kitchen ready for a shot at a  cunning old hawk that they called ''Tarnal Death', and that used to be  always after the chickens.    When Mary lifted her face it was as white as note-paper, and her eyes  seemed to grow wilder when she caught sight of me.    'Oh, you did frighten me, Mr Barnes,' she gasped. Then she gave a little  ghost of a laugh and stood up, and some colour came back.    'Oh, I'm a little fool!' she said quickly. 'I thought I heard old  'Tarnal Death at the chickens, and I thought it would be a great thing  if I got the gun and brought him down; so I got up and dressed quietly  so as not to wake Sarah. And then you came round the corner and  frightened me. I don't know what you must think of me, Mr Barnes.'    'Never mind,' said Jack. 'You go and have a sleep, or you won't be  able to dance to-night. Never mind the gun--I'll put that away.' And he  steered her round to the door of her room off the brick verandah where  she slept with one of the other girls.    'Well, that's a rum start!' I said.    'Yes, it is,' said Jack; 'it's very funny. Well, how's your face this  morning, Joe?'    He seemed a lot more serious than usual.    We were hard at work all the morning cleaning out the big wool-shed and  getting it ready for the dance, hanging hoops for the candles, making  seats, &c. I kept out of sight of the girls as much as I could. One side  of my face was a sight and the other wasn't too classical. I felt as if  I had been stung by a swarm of bees.    'You're a fresh, sweet-scented beauty now, and no mistake, Joe,' said  Jimmy Nowlett--he was going to play the accordion that night. 'You ought  to fetch the girls now, Joe. But never mind, your face'll go down  in about three weeks. My lower jaw is crooked yet; but that fight  straightened my nose, that had been knocked crooked when I was a boy--so  I didn't lose much beauty by it.'    When we'd done in the shed, Jack took me aside and said--    'Look here, Joe! if you won't come to the dance to-night--and I can't  say you'd ornament it--I tell you what you'll do. You get little Mary  away on the quiet and take her out for a stroll--and act like a man. The  job's finished now, and you won't get another chance like this.'    'But how am I to get her out?' I said.    'Never you mind. You be mooching round down by the big peppermint-tree  near the river-gate, say about half-past ten.'    'What "]]]
