However, Herbert, who had gone forward  a little more to the left, soon came upon rocks covered with sea-weed,  which, some hours later, would be hidden by the high tide. On these  rocks, in the midst of slippery wrack, abounded bivalve shell-fish, not  to be despised by starving people. Herbert called Pencroft, who ran up  hastily.    \"Here are mussels!\" cried the sailor; \"these will do instead of eggs!\"    \"They are not mussels,\" replied Herbert, who was attentively examining  the molluscs attached to the rocks; \"they are lithodomes.\"    \"Are they good to eat?\" asked Pencroft.    \"Perfectly so.\"    \"Then let us eat some lithodomes.\"    The sailor could rely upon Herbert; the young boy was well up in natural  history, and always had had quite a passion for the science. His father  had encouraged him in it, by letting him attend the lectures of the best  professors in Boston, who were very fond of the intelligent, industrious  lad. And his turn for natural history was, more than once in the course  of time, of great use, and he was not mistaken in this instance. These  lithodomes were oblong shells, suspended in clusters and adhering  very tightly to the rocks. They belong to that species of molluscous  perforators which excavate holes in the hardest stone; their shell is  rounded at both ends, a feature which is not remarked in the common  mussel.    Pencroft and Herbert made a good meal of the lithodomes, which were  then half opened to the sun. They ate them as oysters, and as they had  a strong peppery taste, they were palatable without condiments of any  sort.    Their hunger was thus appeased for the time, but not their thirst, which  increased after eating these naturally-spiced molluscs. They had then to  find fresh water, and it was not likely that it would be wanting in such  a capriciously uneven region. Pencroft and Herbert, after having taken  the precaution of collecting an ample supply of lithodomes, with which  they filled their pockets and handkerchiefs, regained the foot of the  cliff.    Two hundred paces farther they arrived at the cutting, through which, as  Pencroft had guessed, ran a stream of water, whether fresh or not was to  be ascertained. At this place the wall appeared to have been separated  by some violent subterranean force. At its base was hollowed out a  little creek, the farthest part of which formed a tolerably sharp angle.  The watercourse at that part measured one hundred feet in breadth, and  its two banks on each side were scarcely twenty feet high. The river  became strong almost directly between the two walls of granite, which  began to sink above the mouth; it then suddenly turned and disappeared  beneath a wood of stunted trees half a mile off.    \"Here is the water, and yonder is the wood we require!\" said Pencroft.  \"Well, Herbert, now we only want the house.\"    The water of the river was limpid. The sailor ascertained that at this  time--that is to say, at low tide, when the rising floods did not reach  it--it was sweet. This important point established, Herbert looked for  some cavity which would serve them as a retreat, but in vain; everywhere  the wall appeared smooth, plain, and perpendicular.    However, at the mouth of the watercourse and above the reach of the high  tide, the convulsions of nature had formed, not a grotto, but a pile  of enormous rocks, such as are often met with in granite countries and  which bear the name of \"Chimneys.\"    Pencroft and Herbert penetrated quite far in among the rocks, by sandy  passages in which light was not wanting, for it entered through the  openings which were left between the blocks, of which some were only  sustained by a miracle of equilibrium; but with the light came also  air--a regular corridor-gale--and with the wind the sharp cold from the  exterior. However, the sailor thought that by stopping-up some of  the openings with a mixture of stones and sand, the Chimneys could be  rendered habitable. Their geometrical plan represented the typographical  sign \"&,\" which signifies \"et cetera\" abridged, but by isolating the  upper mouth of the sign, through which the south and west winds blew so  strongly, they could succeed in making the lower part of use.    \"Here's our work,\" said Pencroft, \"and if we ever see Captain Harding  again, he will know how to make something of this labyrinth.\"    \"We shall see him again, Pencroft,\" cried Herbert, \"and when he returns  he must find a tolerable dwelling here. It will be so, if we can make a  fireplace in the left passage and keep an opening for the smoke.\"    \"So we can, my boy,\" replied the sailor, \"and these Chimneys will serve  our turn. Let us set to work, but first come and get a store of fuel. I  think some branches will be very useful in stopping up these openings,  through which the wind shrieks like so many fiends.\"    Herbert and Pencroft left the Chimneys, and, turning the angle, they  began to climb the left bank of the river. The current here was quite  rapid, and drifted down some dead wood. The rising tide--and it could  already be perceived--must drive it back with force to a considerable  distance. The sailor then thought that they could utilize this ebb and  flow for the transport of heavy objects.    After having walked for a quarter of an hour, the sailor and the boy  arrived at the angle which the river made in turning towards the left.  From this point its course was pursued through a forest of magnificent  trees. These trees still retained their verdure, notwithstanding the  advanced season, for they belonged to the family of \"coniferae,\" which  is spread over all the regions of the globe, from northern climates to  the tropics. The young naturalist recognized especially the \"deedara,\"  which are very numerous in the Himalayan zone, and which spread around  them a most agreeable odor. Between these beautiful trees sprang up  clusters of firs, whose opaque open parasol boughs spread wide around.  Among the long grass, Pencroft felt that his feet were crushing dry  branches which crackled like fireworks.    \"Well, my boy,\" said he to Herbert, \"if I don't know the name of these  trees, at any rate I reckon that we may call them 'burning wood,' and  just now that's the chief thing we want.\"    \"Let us get a supply,\" replied Herbert, who immediately set to work.    The collection was easily made. It was not even necessary to lop the  trees, for enormous quantities of dead wood were lying at their feet;  but if fuel was not wanting, the means of transporting it was not yet  found. The wood, being very dry, would burn rapidly; it was therefore  necessary to carry to the Chimneys a considerable quantity, and the  loads of two men would not be sufficient. Herbert remarked this.    \"Well, my boy,\" replied the sailor, \"there must be some way of carrying  this wood; there is always a way of doing everything. If we had a cart  or a boat, it would be easy enough.\"    \"But we have the river,\" said Herbert.    \"Right,\" replied Pencroft; \"the river will be to us like a road which  carries of itself, and rafts have not been invented for nothing.\"    \"Only,\" observed Herbert, \"at this moment our road is going the wrong  way, for the tide is rising!\"    \"We shall be all right if we wait till it ebbs,\" replied the sailor,  \"and then we will trust it to carry our fuel to the Chimneys. Let us get  the raft ready.\"    The sailor, followed by Herbert, directed his steps towards the river.  They both carried, each in proportion to his strength, a load of wood  bound in fagots. They found on the bank also a great quantity of dead  branches in the midst of grass, among which the foot of man had probably  never before trod. Pencroft began directly to make his raft. In a kind  of little bay, created by a point of the shore which broke the current,  the sailor and the lad placed some good-sized pieces of wood, which  they had fastened together with dry creepers. A raft was thus formed, on  which they stacked all they had collected, sufficient, indeed, to have  loaded at least twenty men. In an hour the work was finished, and the  raft moored to the bank, awaited the turning of the tide.    There were still several hours to be occupied, and with one consent  Pencroft and Herbert resolved to gain the upper plateau, so as to have a  more extended view of the surrounding country.    Exactly two hundred feet behind the angle formed by the river, the wall,  terminated by a fall of rocks, died away in a gentle slope to the edge  of the forest. It was a natural staircase. Herbert and the sailor began  their ascent; thanks to the vigor of their muscles they reached the  summit in a few minutes; and proceeded to the point above the mouth of  the river.    On attaining it, their first look was cast upon the ocean which not long  before they had traversed in such a terrible condition. They observed,  with emotion, all that part to the north of the coast on which the  catastrophe had taken place. It was there that Cyrus Harding had  disappeared. They looked to see if some portion of their balloon, to  which a man might possibly cling, yet existed. Nothing! The sea was but  one vast watery desert. As to the coast, it was solitary also. Neither  the reporter nor Neb could be anywhere seen. But it was possible that at  this time they were both too far away to be perceived.    \"Something tells me,\" cried Herbert, \"that a man as energetic as Captain  Harding would not let himself be drowned like other people. He must have  reached some point of the shore; don't you think so, Pencroft?\"    The sailor shook his head sadly. He little expected ever to see Cyrus  Harding again; but wishing to leave some hope to Herbert: \"Doubtless,  doubtless,\" said he; \"our engineer is a man who would get out of a  scrape to which any one else would yield.\"    In the meantime he examined the coast with great attention. Stretched  out below them was the sandy shore, bounded on the right"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12680"],[0,"Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People (#6)"],[1,"distinguished from other women by the flaccidity of their bodices; some  wear small woollen caps and sabots. When Esther read in her school-books  that the note of the Dutch character was cleanliness, she wondered. She  looked in vain for the scrupulously scoured floors and the shining caps  and faces. Only in the matter of tobacco-smoke did the Dutch people she  knew live up to the geographical \"Readers.\"    German Jews gravitate to Polish and Russian; and French Jews mostly stay  in France. _Ici on ne parle pas Francais_, is the only lingual certainty  in the London Ghetto, which is a cosmopolitan quarter.    \"I always said no girl of mine should marry a Dutchman.\" Mr. Belcovitch  spoke as if at the close of a long career devoted to avoiding Dutch  alliances, forgetting that not even one of his daughters was yet secure.    \"Nor any girl of mine,\" said Mrs. Belcovitch, as if starting a separate  proposition. \"I would not trust a Dutchman with my medicine-bottle, much  less with my Alte or my Becky. Dutchmen were not behind the door when  the Almighty gave out noses, and their deceitfulness is in proportion to  their noses.\"    The company murmured assent, and one gentleman, with a rather large  organ, concealed it in a red cotton handkerchief, trumpeting uneasily.    \"The Holy One, blessed be He, has given them larger noses than us,\" said  the _Maggid_, \"because they have to talk through them so much.\"    A guffaw greeted this sally. The _Maggid's_ wit was relished even when  not coming from the pulpit. To the outsider this disparagement of the  Dutch nose might have seemed a case of pot calling kettle black. The  _Maggid_ poured himself out a glass of rum, under cover of the laughter,  and murmuring \"Life to you.\" in Hebrew, gulped it down, and added, \"They  oughtn't to call it the Dutch tongue, but the Dutch nose.\"    \"Yes, I always wonder how they can understand one another,\" said Mrs.  Belcovitch, \"with their _chatuchayacatigewesepoopa_.\" She laughed  heartily over her onomatopoetic addition to the Yiddish vocabulary,  screwing up her nose to give it due effect. She was a small  sickly-looking woman, with black eyes, and shrivelled skin, and the wig  without which no virtuous wife is complete. For a married woman must  sacrifice her tresses on the altar of home, lest she snare other men  with such sensuous baits. As a rule, she enters into the spirit of the  self-denying ordinance so enthusiastically as to become hideous hastily  in every other respect. It is forgotten that a husband is also a man.  Mrs. Belcovitch's head was not completely shaven and shorn, for a lower  stratum of an unmatched shade of brown peeped out in front of the  _shaitel_, not even coinciding as to the route of the central parting.    Meantime Pesach Weingott and Alte (Fanny) Belcovitch held each other's  hand, guiltily conscious of Batavian corpuscles in the young man's  blood. Pesach had a Dutch uncle, but as he had never talked like him  Alte alone knew. Alte wasn't her real name, by the way, and Alte was the  last person in the world to know what it was. She was the Belcovitches'  first successful child; the others all died before she was born. Driven  frantic by a fate crueller than barrenness, the Belcovitches consulted  an old Polish Rabbi, who told them they displayed too much fond  solicitude for their children, provoking Heaven thereby; in future, they  were to let no one but themselves know their next child's name, and  never to whisper it till the child was safely married. In such wise,  Heaven would not be incessantly reminded of the existence of their dear  one, and would not go out of its way to castigate them. The ruse  succeeded, and Alte was anxiously waiting to change both her names under  the _Chuppah_, and to gratify her life-long curiosity on the subject.  Meantime, her mother had been calling her \"Alte,\" or \"old 'un,\" which  sounded endearing to the child, but grated on the woman arriving ever  nearer to the years of discretion. Occasionally, Mrs. Belcovitch  succumbed to the prevailing tendency, and called her \"Fanny,\" just as  she sometimes thought of herself as Mrs. Belcovitch, though her name  was Kosminski. When Alte first went to school in London, the Head  Mistress said, \"What's your name?\" The little \"old 'un\" had not  sufficient English to understand the question, but she remembered that  the Head Mistress had made the same sounds to the preceding applicant,  and, where some little girls would have put their pinafores to their  eyes and cried, Fanny showed herself full of resource. As the last  little girl, though patently awe-struck, had come off with flying  colors, merely by whimpering \"Fanny Belcovitch,\" Alte imitated these  sounds as well as she was able.    \"Fanny Belcovitch, did you say?\" said the Head Mistress, pausing with  arrested pen.    Alte nodded her flaxen poll vigorously.    \"Fanny Belcovitch,\" she repeated, getting the syllables better on a  second hearing.    The Head Mistress turned to an assistant.    \"Isn't it astonishing how names repeat themselves? Two girls, one after  the other, both with exactly the same name.\"    They were used to coincidences in the school, where, by reason of the  tribal relationship of the pupils, there was a great run on some  half-a-dozen names. Mr. Kosminski took several years to understand that  Alte had disowned him. When it dawned upon him he was not angry, and  acquiesced in his fate. It was the only domestic detail in which he had  allowed himself to be led by his children. Like his wife, Chayah, he was  gradually persuaded into the belief that he was a born Belcovitch, or at  least that Belcovitch was Kosminski translated into English.    Blissfully unconscious of the Dutch taint in Pesach Weingott, Bear  Belcovitch bustled about in reckless hospitality. He felt that  engagements were not every-day events, and that even if his whole  half-sovereign's worth of festive provision was swallowed up, he would  not mind much. He wore a high hat, a well-preserved black coat, with a  cutaway waistcoat, showing a quantity of glazed shirtfront and a massive  watch chain. They were his Sabbath clothes, and, like the Sabbath they  honored, were of immemorial antiquity. The shirt served him for seven  Sabbaths, or a week of Sabbaths, being carefully folded after each. His  boots had the Sabbath polish. The hat was the one he bought when he  first set up as a _Baal Habaas_ or respectable pillar of the synagogue;  for even in the smallest _Chevra_ the high hat comes next in sanctity to  the Scroll of the Law, and he who does not wear it may never hope to  attain to congregational dignities. The gloss on that hat was wonderful,  considering it had been out unprotected in all winds and weathers. Not  that Mr. Belcovitch did not possess an umbrella. He had two,--one of  fine new silk, the other a medley of broken ribs and cotton rags. Becky  had given him the first to prevent the family disgrace of the spectacle  of his promenades with the second. But he would not carry the new one on  week-days because it was too good. And on Sabbaths it is a sin to carry  any umbrella. So Becky's self-sacrifice was vain, and her umbrella stood  in the corner, a standing gratification to the proud possessor.  Kosminski had had a hard fight for his substance, and was not given to  waste. He was a tall, harsh-looking man of fifty, with grizzled hair, to  whom life meant work, and work meant money, and money meant savings. In  Parliamentary Blue-Books, English newspapers, and the Berner Street  Socialistic Club, he was called a \"sweater,\" and the comic papers  pictured him with a protuberant paunch and a greasy smile, but he had  not the remotest idea that he was other than a God-fearing, industrious,  and even philanthropic citizen. The measure that had been dealt to him  he did but deal to others. He saw no reason why immigrant paupers should  not live on a crown a week while he taught them how to handle a  press-iron or work a sewing machine. They were much better off than in  Poland. He would have been glad of such an income himself in those  terrible first days of English life when he saw his wife and his two  babes starving before his eyes, and was only precluded from investing a  casual twopence in poison by ignorance of the English name for anything  deadly. And what did he live on now? The fowl, the pint of haricot  beans, and the haddocks which Chayah purchased for the Sabbath  overlapped into the middle of next week, a quarter of a pound of coffee  lasted the whole week, the grounds being decocted till every grain of  virtue was extracted. Black bread and potatoes and pickled herrings  made up the bulk of the every-day diet No, no one could accuse Bear  Belcovitch of fattening on the entrails of his employees. The furniture  was of the simplest and shabbiest,--no aesthetic instinct urged the  Kosminskis to overpass the bare necessities of existence, except in  dress. The only concessions to art were a crudely-colored _Mizrach_ on  the east wall, to indicate the direction towards which the Jew should  pray, and the mantelpiece mirror which was bordered with yellow  scalloped paper (to save the gilt) and ornamented at each corner with  paper roses that bloomed afresh every Passover. And yet Bear Belcovitch  had lived in much better style in Poland, possessing a brass wash-hand  basin, a copper saucepan, silver spoons, a silver consecration beaker,  and a cupboard with glass doors, and he frequently adverted to their  fond memories. But he brought nothing away except his bedding, and that  was pawned in Germany on the route. When he arrived in London he had  with him three groschen and a family.    \"What do you think, Pesach,\" said Becky, as soon as she could get at her  prospective brother-in-law through the barriers of congratulatory  countrymen. \"The stuff that came through there\"--she pointed to the  discolored fragment of ceiling--\"was soup.
