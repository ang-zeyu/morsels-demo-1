[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14417"],[0,"The Agamemnon of Aeschylus (#6)"],[1,"burning;    Till, behold, the ancient City  Of King Priam turned, and turning  Took a new song for her learning,    A song changed and full of pity,    With the cry of a lost nation;      And she changed the bridegroom's name:    Called him Paris Ghastly-wed;    For her sons were with the dead,    And her life one lamentation,      'Mid blood and burning flame.    (_Like a lion's whelp reared as a pet and turning afterwards to a great  beast of prey,_)      Lo, once there was a herdsman reared      In his own house, so stories tell,    A lion's whelp, a milk-fed thing    And soft in life's first opening    Among the sucklings of the herd;      The happy children loved him well,    And old men smiled, and oft, they say,    In men's arms, like a babe, he lay,  Bright-eyed, and toward the hand that teased him    Eagerly fawning for food or play.      Then on a day outflashed the sudden      Rage of the lion brood of yore;    He paid his debt to them that fed    With wrack of herds and carnage red,    Yea, wrought him a great feast unbidden,      Till all the house-ways ran with gore;    A sight the thralls fled weeping from,      A great red slayer, beard a-foam,  High-priest of some blood-cursed altar    God had uplifted against that home.    (_So was it with Helen in Troy._)      And how shall I call the thing that came      At the first hour to Ilion city?    Call it a dream of peace untold,    A secret joy in a mist of gold,    A woman's eye that was soft, like flame,      A flower which ate a man's heart with pity.    But she swerved aside and wrought to her kiss a bitter ending,  And a wrath was on her harbouring, a wrath upon her friending,  When to Priam and his sons she fled quickly o'er the deep,  With the god to whom she sinned for her watcher on the wind,  A death-bride, whom brides long shall weep.    (_Men say that Good Fortune wakes the envy of God; not so; Good Fortune  may be innocent, and then there is no vengeance_.)      A grey word liveth, from the morn      Of old time among mortals spoken,    That man's Wealth waxen full shall fall    Not childless, but get sons withal;    And ever of great bliss is born       A tear unstanched and a heart broken.    But I hold my thought alone and by others unbeguiled;  'Tis the deed that is unholy shall have issue, child on child,  Sin on sin, like his begetters; and they shall be as they were.    But the man who walketh straight, and the house thereof, tho' Fate    Exalt him, the children shall be fair.    _(It is Sin, it is Pride and Ruthlessness, that beget children  like themselves till Justice is fulfilled upon them.)_    But Old Sin loves, when comes the hour again,     To bring forth New,  Which laugheth lusty amid the tears of men;  Yea, and Unruth, his comrade, wherewith none  May plead nor strive, which dareth on and on,    Knowing not fear nor any holy thing;  Two fires of darkness in a house, born true,    Like to their ancient spring.    But Justice shineth in a house low-wrought    With smoke-stained wall,  And honoureth him who filleth his own lot;  But the unclean hand upon the golden stair  With eyes averse she flieth, seeking where    Things innocent are; and, recking not the power  Of wealth by man misgloried, guideth all    To her own destined hour.      [_Here amid a great procession enter_ AGAMEMNON _on a Chariot. Behind  him on another Chariot is_ CASSANDRA. _The_ CHORUS _approach and make  obeisance. Some of_ AGAMEMNON'S _men have on their shields a White Horse,  some a Lion. Their arms are rich and partly barbaric_.    LEADER.    All hail, O King! Hail, Atreus' Son!  Sacker of Cities! Ilion's bane!  With what high word shall I greet thee again,  How give thee worship, and neither outrun  The point of pleasure, nor stint too soon?  For many will cling. To fair seeming  The faster because they have sinned erewhile;  And a man may sigh with never a sting  Of grief in his heart, and a man may smile  With eyes unlit and a lip that strains.  But the wise Shepherd knoweth his sheep,     And his eyes pierce deep  The faith like water that fawns and feigns.    But I hide nothing, O King. That day  When in quest of Helen our battle array  Hurled forth, thy name upon my heart's scroll  Was deep in letters of discord writ;     And the ship of thy soul,  Ill-helmed and blindly steered was it,  Pursuing ever, through men that die,  One wild heart that was fain to fly.     But on this new day,  From the deep of my thought and in love, I say    \"Sweet is a grief well ended;\"  And in time's flow Thou wilt learn and know     The true from the false,  Of them that were left to guard the walls    Of thine empty Hall unfriended.      [_During the above_ CLYTEMNESTRA _has appeared on the Palace steps, with  a train of Attendants, to receive her Husband_.    AGAMEMNON.    To Argos and the gods of Argolis  All hail, who share with me the glory of this  Home-coming and the vengeance I did wreak  On Priam's City! Yea, though none should speak,  The great gods heard our cause, and in one mood  Uprising, in the urn of bitter blood,  That men should shriek and die and towers should burn,  Cast their great vote; while over Mercy's urn  Hope waved her empty hands and nothing fell.     Even now in smoke that City tells her tale;  The wrack-wind liveth, and where Ilion died  The reek of the old fatness of her pride  From hot and writhing ashes rolls afar.     For which let thanks, wide as our glories are,  Be uplifted; seeing the Beast of Argos hath  Round Ilion's towers piled high his fence of wrath  And, for one woman ravished, wrecked by force  A City. Lo, the leap of the wild Horse  in darkness when the Pleiades were dead;  A mailed multitude, a Lion unfed,  Which leapt the tower and lapt the blood of Kings!      Lo, to the Gods I make these thanksgivings.  But for thy words: I marked them, and I mind  Their meaning, and my voice shall be behind  Thine. For not many men, the proverb saith,  Can love a friend whom fortune prospereth  Unenvying; and about the envious brain  Cold poison clings, and doubles all the pain  Life brings him. His own woundings he must nurse,  And feels another's gladness like a curse.      Well can I speak. I know the mirrored glass  Called friendship, and the shadow shapes that pass  And feign them a King's friends. I have known but one--  Odysseus, him we trapped against his own  Will!--who once harnessed bore his yoke right well ...  Be he alive or dead of whom I tell  The tale. And for the rest, touching our state  And gods, we will assemble in debate  A concourse of all Argos, taking sure  Counsel, that what is well now may endure  Well, and if aught needs healing medicine, still  By cutting and by fire, with all good will,  I will essay to avert the after-wrack  Such sickness breeds.                          Aye, Heaven hath led me back;  And on this hearth where still my fire doth burn  I will go pay to heaven my due return,  Which guides me here, which saved me far away.    O Victory, now mine own, be mine alway!      [CLYTEMNESTRA, _at the head of her retinue, steps forward. She controls  her suspense with difficulty but gradually gains courage as she proceeds._    CLYTEMNESTRA.    Ye Elders, Council of the Argive name  Here present, I will no more hold it shame  To lay my passion bare before men's eyes.  There comes a time to a woman when fear dies  For ever. None hath taught me. None could tell,  Save me, the weight of years intolerable  I lived while this man lay at Ilion.  That any woman thus should sit alone  In a half-empty house, with no man near,  Makes her half-blind with dread! And in her ear  Alway some voice of wrath; now messengers  Of evil; now not so; then others worse,  Crying calamity against mine and me.    Oh, had he half the wounds that variously  Came rumoured home, his flesh must be a net,  All holes from heel to crown! And if he met  As many deaths as I met tales thereon,  Is he some monstrous thing, some Geryon  Three-souled, that will not die, till o'er his head,  Three robes of earth be piled, to hold him dead?    Aye, many a time my heart broke, and the noose  Of death had got me; but they cut me loose.  It was those voices alway in mine ear.      For that, too, young Orestes is not here  Beside me, as were meet, seeing he above  All else doth hold the surety of our love;  Let not thy heart be troubled. It fell thus:  Our loving spear-friend took him, Strophius  The Phocian, who forewarned me of annoy  Two-fronted, thine own peril under Troy,  And ours here, if the rebel multitude  Should cast the Council down. It is men's mood  Alway, to spurn the fallen. So spake he,  And sure no guile was in him.                                  But for me,  The old stormy rivers of my grief are dead  Now at the spring; not one tear left unshed.  Mine eyes are sick with vigil, endlessly  Weeping the beacon-piles that watched for thee  For ever answerless. And did I dream,  A gnat's thin whirr would start me, like a scream  Of battle, and show me thee by terrors swept,  Crowding, too many for the time I slept.      From all which stress delivered and free-souled,  I greet my lord: O watchdog of the fold,  O forestay sure that fails not in the squall,  O strong-based pillar of a towering hall;  O single son to a father age-ridden;  O land unhoped for seen by shipwrecked men;  Sunshine more beautiful when storms are fled;  Spring of quick water in a desert dead ....  How sweet to be set free from any chain!    These be my words to greet him home again.  No god shall grudge them. Surely I and thou  Have suffered in time past enough! And now  Dismount, O head with love and glory crowned,  From this high car; yet plant not on bare ground  Thy foot, great King, the foot that trampled Troy.    Ho, bondmaids, up! Forget not your employ,  A floor of crimson broideries to spread  For the King's path. Let all the ground be red  Where those feet pass; and Justice, dark of yore,  Home light him to the hearth he looks"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14419"],[0,"Grammatical Sketch of the Heve Language (#6)"],[1,"tenemos lástima á nuestros      enemigos.
