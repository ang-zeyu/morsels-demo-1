And as it was afterwards understood, that it was not usual at  this place to return an equal number of guns upon those occasions (a  circumstance always insisted on by his Majesty's ships when they salute),  all  unpleasant discussion of this point was thereby avoided.    Early in the morning the officer was dispatched on shore by Captain  Phillip to learn at what time he might pay his respects to the governor.  The hour of noon was appointed for that ceremony; and accordingly at that  time Captain Phillip, accompanied by the civil, military, and naval  officers under his orders, waited on his excellency the Marquis De  Branceforte, and were received by him with the utmost politeness.    The same reasons which induced Captain Phillip to acquiesce in omitting  to salute on his arrival at this port, operated against his taking public  notice of his Majesty's birthday, which he would otherwise have made a  point of celebrating with every mark of respect.    In the afternoon of this day the marquis sent an officer on board the  _Sirius_, politely offering Captain Phillip whatever assistance he might  stand in need of, and that was in his power to furnish. In the forenoon  of Wednesday the 6th, he came in person on board, attended by several of  his officers, to return Captain Phillip's visit; and afterwards  entertained him, the lieutenant-governor, and other officers of the  settlement, navy, and marines, to the number of ten, at dinner.    The next being the day of Corpus Christi, a day of great religious  observance and ceremony in Roman Catholic countries, no boats were sent  from the transports to the shore. The business of watering, getting off  wine, etc. was suspended by Captain Phillip's directions until the  morrow, to prevent the least interruption being given by any of the  people under his command to the ceremonies and processions which were to  take place. Those officers, whose curiosity led them to observe the  religious proceedings of the day, very prudently attended uncovered, and  knelt, wherever kneeling was required, in the streets, and in their  churches; for, when it was considered that the same great Creator of the  universe was worshipped alike by Protestant and Catholic, what difficulty  could the mind have in divesting their pageant of its tinsel, its  trappings, and its censers, and joining with sincerity in offering the  purest incense, that of a grateful heart?    The Marquis De Branceforte, whom we found in the government of the Canary  Isles, was, we were informed, a major-general in the Spanish service, and  having been three years in the government, only waited, it was said, for  his promotion to the rank of lieutenant-general to return to Spain. The  salary annexed to this government, as we understood, was not quite equal  to fifteen hundred pounds a year. His Excellency's house was situated at  the upper end of the High Street, or Square, as it was called, and was by  no means the best in the town. Mr. Carter (the treasurer) and some  private merchants appearing to reside in larger and much better  habitations. The houses in most of the streets were built with  quadrangles, a gallery running round the interior sides of the first  floor, on which indeed the families chiefly resided, appropriating the  ground floor to offices for domestic purposes. The dwelling-rooms were  not ceiled, but were open to the roof of the building, which rarely  exceeded two stories in height. The upper part of the windows was glazed  with very bad glass; the lower part consisted of close lattice-work,  through the small apertures of which, as we traversed the streets, we had  now and then opportunities of noticing the features of the women, whom  the custom of the country had confined within doors to the lattice, and  in the street to the _roba zilia_, or veil. There were but few objects in  the town sufficiently striking to draw the attention of a stranger.    The landing-place was commodious, being formed by a stone pier, alongside  of which two boats at a time might lie with great ease and take in their  fresh water. It appeared by an inscription in Spanish, that the pier,  having fallen nearly into a state of entire ruin, was indebted for its  present convenience to the liberality of the governor assisted indeed by  some merchants, who superintended and contributed largely to its repair,  which was completed in the year 1786.    At the lower end of the High Street was observed a light and  well-finished monument of white marble, commemorating the marvellous  appearance of the image or bust of Our Lady at Candelaria, to the  Guanches, the aborigines of the country, who were thereby converted to  Christianity 104 years before the preaching of the gospel. The four sides  of the monument bore long inscriptions to this effect, and further  intimated, that it was erected, as an act of piety and cordial devotion,  at the expense of Don Bartholomi di Montagnes, perpetual captain of the  Royal Marine Castle at Candelaria.    In the centre of this street were a stone basin and fountain, from which  the inhabitants were supplied with a stream of very good water, conveyed  from the neighbouring hills by wooden troughs supported on slight posts,  and reaching quite to the town. At the head of the street, near the  government-house, stood a large stone cross, and at a small distance the  church of St Francis, annexed to which was a monastery of Franciscans.  The name of Santa Cruz, the Holy Cross, seemed not inapplicable to this  town, for one or more crucifixes of wood or stone were to be found in  most of the streets, and in others the form of the Cross was painted upon  the walls of the houses. Over the entrances of some houses we observed,  inclosed in small glass-cases, the images and pictures of favourite  saints, with lamps before them, which were lighted in the evenings and on  certain public occasions.    There were not any fortifications upon the commanding ground above the  town; but at each end of the bay stood a fort, between which were erected  three or four circular redoubts, connected with each other by a low  parapet wall, wearing the appearance of a line of communication between  the forts; but very few cannon were to be seen in the works.    On the skirts of the town to the southward we visited a workhouse, which  had been originally designed for the reception of the mendicants with  which the town had been very much infested. About forty families had  subscribed a certain sum to erect this building, and to furnish in a  manner every way convenient and consistent with such a design. But we  were informed that the governor had filled it with the daughters of the  labouring poor, who were here instructed in weaving and spinning, and  were brought up in industry and cleanliness, remaining in the house until  of a marriageable age, when a portion equal to ten pounds sterling was  given with each on the day of her nuptials. This and the other expenses  of the house were furnished by a fund produced from the labour of the  young people, who appeared all in the same dress, plain indeed, but  cleanly and neat.    We heard with surprise, and not without regret, that this institution was  likely to fall to the ground whenever the governor's departure should  take place, the subscribers being dissatisfied with the plan that was  then pursued, alleging that their money had been given to get rid of  their beggars, whose numbers were not diminished; and that the children  were only taught what they could learn from their mothers at home. To us  however, judging without prejudice or partiality, the design of the  institution appeared to have been more effectually answered by striking  at the root of beggary, than if the charity had been merely confined to  objects who would have been found daily to multiply, from the comfortable  provision held out to them by that charity.    A whole-length picture of the governor was hung up in the working-rooms  of the house. He was represented, agreeably to the end that was at first  proposed by the institution, conducting a miserable object to the gate of  the workhouse; a front view of which was also given.    These islands, known to the Romans by the appellation of the Fortunate  Islands, appeared even at this day to deserve that epithet; for the  inhabitants were so fortunate, and the soil so happy, that no venomous  creature had been found to live there; several toads, adders, and other  poisonous reptiles, which had been brought thither for proof, having died  almost immediately after their arrival. The air of this place is very  salubrious; an instance of which was remarked in a gentleman who was said  to be 113 years of age, and who had been happy enough to preserve his  faculties through such a series of time, nearly entire, his memory alone  appearing to be impaired. He came from Waterford in Ireland, and had been  vice-consul at this port ever since the year 1709.    We were informed that a slight shock of an earthquake had been felt here  in the month of February preceding, but was unattended with any eruption  from the Peak, which had not alarmed the island since the year 1703, when  it destroyed the port of Guarrachica.    When the weather was very hot at Santa Cruz, the better sort of the  inhabitants chose cooler residences higher up in the mountains, and these  they could establish in whatever degree of temperature they chose; for in  proportion as they ascended the air became cooler, the famous Peak being  (though a volcano) clad in perpetual snow at its summit. We understood  that the rain fell very heavy at certain seasons; and, on the sides of  the hills which surrounded the town, ridges or low walls of stone were  constructed at short"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12573"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 08 (#6)"],[1,"fterward, lived to grow up. He turned out to be a  handsome lad, though he had a strange, dark color in his face; he was  now traveling abroad as a journeyman mason. For from the time of Brosi,  and especially since that worthy man's son, Severin, had worked his way  up to such high honor with the mallet, many of the young men in the  village had chosen to follow the mason's calling. The children used to  talk of Severin as if he were a prince in a fairy tale. And so Black  Marianne's only child had, in spite of her remonstrances, become a  mason, and was now wandering around the country. And she, who all her  life long had never left the village, nor had ever desired to leave it,  often declared that she seemed to herself like a hen that had hatched a  duck's egg; but she was almost always clucking to herself about it.    One would hardly believe it, but Black Marianne was one of the most  cheerful persons in the village; she was never seen to be sorrowful, for  she did not like to have people pity her; and that is why they did not  take to her. In the winter she was the most industrious spinner in the  village, and in the summer, the busiest at gathering wood, a large part  of which she was able to sell; and \"my John\"--for that was her surviving  child's name--\"my John\" was always the subject of her conversation. She  said that she had taken little Amrei to live with her, not from a desire  to be kind, but in order that she might have some living being about  her. She liked to appear rough before people, and thus enjoyed, all the  more, the proud consciousness of independence.    The exact opposite to her was Crappy Zachy, with whom Damie had found  shelter. This worthy represented himself to people as a kind-hearted  fellow who would give away anything he had; but as a matter of fact he  bullied and ill-used his entire household, and especially Damie, for  whose keep he received but a small sum of money. His real name was  Zechariah, and he got his nickname from his once having brought home to  his wife a couple of finely trussed pigeons to roast, but they were in  fact a pair of plucked ravens, which in that part of the country are  called \"crappies.\" Crappy Zachy, who had a wooden leg, spent most of his  time knitting woolen stockings and jackets; and with his knitting he  used to sit about in the village wherever there was any opportunity to  gossip. This gossiping, in the course of which he heard all sorts of  news, was a source of some very profitable side-business for him. He was  what they called the \"marriage-maker\" of the region; for in those parts,  where there are large, separate estates, marriages are generally managed  through agents, who find out accurately the relative circumstances of  the prospective couples, and arrange everything beforehand. When a  marriage of this kind had been brought about, Crappy Zachy used to play  the fiddle at the wedding, for he had quite a reputation in the region  as a fiddler; moreover, when his hands were tired from fiddling, he  could play the clarionet and the horn. In fact, he was an undoubted  genius.    Damie's whining and sensitive nature was very disgusting to Crappy  Zachy, and he tried to cure him of it by giving him plenty to cry about  and teasing him whenever he could.    Thus the two little stems which had sprouted in the same garden were  transplanted into different soils. The position and the nature of the  ground, and the qualities that were inherent in each stem, made them  grow up very differently.          CHAPTER IV    \"OPEN, DOOR\"      All Souls' Day came. It was dull and foggy, and the children stood among  a crowd of people assembled in the churchyard. Crappy Zachy had led  Damie there by the hand, but Amrei had come alone, without Black  Marianne; many were angry at the hard-hearted woman, while a few hit a  part of the truth when they said that Marianne did not like to visit  graves, because she did not know where her husband's grave was. Amrei  was quiet and did not shed a tear, while Damie wept bitterly at the  pitying remarks of the bystanders, more especially because Crappy Zachy  had given him several sly pinches and pokes. For a time Amrei, in a  dreamy, forgetful way, stood gazing at the lights on the heads of the  graves, watching the flame consume the wax and the wick grow blacker,  and blacker, until at last the light was quite burnt out.    In the crowd a man, wearing handsome, town-made clothes and with a  ribbon in his button-hole, was moving about here and there. It was the  High Commissioner of Public Works, Severin, who, on a trip of  inspection, had come to visit the graves of his parents, Brosi and Moni.  His brothers and sisters and other relatives were constantly crowding  around him with a kind of deferential respect; in fact, the usual  reverence of the occasion was almost entirely diverted, nearly all the  attention being fixed upon this stranger. Amrei also looked at him, and  asked Crappy Zachy:    \"Is that a bridegroom?\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because he has a ribbon in his button-hole.\"    Instead of answering her, the first thing that Crappy Zachy did was to  go up to a group of people and tell them what a stupid speech the child  had made; and from among the graves there arose a loud laugh over her  foolishness. Only Farmer Rodel's wife said: \"I don't see anything  foolish in that. Although it is a mark of honor that Severin has, it is  after all a strange thing for him to go about in the churchyard with  such a decoration on--in the place where we see what we are all coming  to, whether in our lifetime we have worn clothes of silk or of homespun.  It annoyed me to see him wear it in the church--a thing of that kind  ought to be taken off when one goes to church, and more especially in  the churchyard!\"    The rumor of little Amrei's question must have penetrated to Severin  himself, for he was seen to button his overcoat hastily, and as he did  so he nodded at the child. Now he was heard to ask who she was, and as  soon as he found out, he came hurrying across to the children beside the  fresh graves, and said to Amrei:    \"Come here, my child. Open your hand. Here is a ducat for you--buy what  you want with it.\"    The child stared at him and did not answer. But scarcely had Severin  turned his back when she called out to him, half-aloud:    \"I won't take any presents!\"--and she flung the ducat after him.    Several people who had seen this came up to Amrei and scolded her; and  just as they were about to illuse her, she was again saved from their  rough hands by Farmer Rodel's wife, who once before had protected her  with words. But even she requested Amrei to go after Severin and at  least thank him. But Amrei made no answer whatsoever; she remained  obstinate, so that her protectress also left her. Only with considerable  difficulty was the ducat found again, and a member of the Village  Council, who was present, took charge of it in order to deliver it over  to the child's guardian.    This incident gave Amrei a strange reputation in the village. People  said she had lived only a few days with Black Marianne, and yet had  already acquired that woman's manners. It was declared to be an unheard  of thing that a child so sunk in poverty could be so proud, and she was  scolded up hill and down dale for this pride, so that she became  thoroughly aware of it, and in her young, childish heart there arose an  attitude of defiance, a resolve to evince it all the more. Black  Marianne, moreover, did her part to strengthen this state of mind, for  she said: \"Nothing more lucky can happen to a poor person than to be  considered proud, for by that means he or she is saved from being  trampled upon by everybody, and from being expected to offer thanks for  such usage afterward.\"    In the winter Amrei was at Crappy Zachy's much of the time, for she was  very fond of hearing him play the violin; yes, and Crappy Zachy on one  occasion bestowed such high praise upon her as to say: \"You are not  stupid;\" for Amrei, after listening to his playing for a long time, had  remarked: \"It's wonderful how a fiddle can hold its breath so long; I  can't do that.\" And, on quiet winter nights at home, when Marianne told  sparkling and horrifying goblin-stories, Amrei, when they were finished,  would draw a deep breath and say: \"Oh, Marianne, I must take breath  now--I was obliged to hold my breath all the time you were speaking.\"    No one paid much attention to Amrei, and the child could dream away just  as she had a mind to. Only the schoolmaster said once at a meeting of  the Village Council, that he had never seen such a child--she was at  once defiant and yielding, dreamy and alert. In truth, with all her  childish self-forgetfulness, there was already developing in little  Amrei a sense of responsibility, an attitude of self-defense in  opposition to the world, its kindness and its malice. Damie, on the  other hand, came crying and complaining to his sister upon every  trifling occasion. He was, furthermore, always pitying himself, and when  he was tumbled over by his playmates in their wrestling matches, he  always whined: \"Yes, because I am an orphan they beat me! Oh, if my  father and mother knew of it!\"--and then he cried twice as much over the  injustice of it. Damie let everybody give him things to eat, and thus  became greedy, while Amrei was satisfied with a little, and thus  acquired habits of moderation. Even the roughest boys were afraid of  Amrei, although nobody knew how she had proved her strength, while Damie  would run away from quite little boys. In school Damie was always up to  mischief; he shuffled his feet and turned down the leaves of the books  with his fingers as he read. Amrei, on the other hand, was always bright  and attentive, though she often wept in the school, not for the  punishment she herself received, but because Damie was so often  punished.    Amrei could please Damie best by telling him the"]]]
