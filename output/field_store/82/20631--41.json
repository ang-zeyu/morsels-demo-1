Isn't that great?\"    \"I'm sorry to shatter your air castle,\" said Tom; \"but for the life of  me I can't see how it will work. Of course, in theory, if you could  revolve a big-bladed propeller in very dense, or in liquid, air, there  would be more resistance than in the rarefied atmosphere of the upper  regions. And, if this could be done, I grant you that you could use  slower motors and smaller propeller blades--more like those of a motor  boat. But how are you going to get the condensed air?\"    \"Make it!\" said Mr. Damon promptly. \"Air pumps are cheap. Just carry  one or two on board the aeroplane, and condense the air as you go  along. That's a small detail that can easily be worked out. I leave  that to you.\"    \"I'd rather you wouldn't,\" said Tom. \"That's the whole  difficulty--compressing your air. Wait! I'll explain it to you.\"    Then the young inventor went into details. He told of the ponderous  machinery needed to condense air to a form approximating water, and  spoke of the terrible pressure exerted by the liquid atmosphere.    \"Anything that you would gain by having a slow-speed motor and smaller  propeller blades, would be lost by the ponderous air-condensing  machinery you would need,\" Tom told Mr. Damon.  \"Besides, if you could  surround your propellers with a strata of condensed air, it would  create such terrible cold as to freeze the propeller blades and make  them as brittle as glass.    \"Why, I have taken a heavy piece of metal, dipped it into liquid air,  and I could shatter the steel with a hammer as easily as a sheet of  ice. The cold of liquid air is beyond belief.    \"Attempts have been made to make motors run with liquid air, but they  have not succeeded. To condense air and to carry it about so that  propellers might revolve in it, would be out of the question.\"    \"You think so, Tom?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"I'm sure of it!\"    \"Oh, dear! That's too bad. Bless my overshoes, but I thought I had a  new idea. Well, you ought to know. So Damon's Whizzer goes on the scrap  heap before ever it's built. Well, we'll say no more about it. You  ought to know best, Tom. I wasn't thinking of it so much for myself as  for you. I thought you'd like some new idea to work on.\"    \"Much obliged, Mr. Damon, but I have a new idea,\" said Tom.    \"You have? What is it? Tell me--that is, if it isn't a secret,\" went on  the eccentric man, as much delighted over Tom's new plan as he had been  over his own Whizzer, doomed to failure so soon.    \"It isn't a secret from you,\" said Tom. \"I got the idea while I was  riding with Mary. I wanted to talk to her--to tell her not to jump out  when we had a little accident--but I had trouble making myself  understood because of the noise of the motor.\"    \"They do make a great racket,\" conceded Mr. Damon. \"But I don't suppose  anything can be done about it.\"    \"I don't see why there can't!\" exclaimed Tom. \"And that's my new  idea--to make a silent aircraft motor--perhaps silent propeller blades,  though it's the motor that makes the most noise. And that's what I'm  going to do--invent a silent aeroplane. Not because I want so much to  talk when I take passengers up in the air, but I believe such a motor  would be valuable, especially for scouting planes in war work. To go  over the enemy's lines and not be heard would be valuable many times.    \"And that's what I'm going to do--work on a silent motor for Uncle Sam.  I've got the germ of an idea and now--\"    \"Excuse me,\" said a voice behind Mr. Damon and Tom, and, turning, the  young inventor beheld the form of Mr. Peton Gale, president of the  Universal Flying Machine Company.          CHAPTER VI    MAKING PLANS      Tom Swift had drawn pencil and paper from his pocket, and, as he and  Mr. Damon were sitting on the steps of one of the shops, the young  inventor was about to demonstrate by a drawing part of his new project,  when the interruption came in the shape of one of the men who had, an  hour before, made a business offer to Tom.    \"Excuse me,\" went on Mr. Peton Gale, \"but Mr. Ware and I got to talking  it over on our way to the station--the matter of having you in our  company, Mr. Swift--and we concluded that it was worth twenty-five  thousand dollars a year for us to have you. So I came back--\"    \"It isn't of the slightest use, Mr. Gale, I assure you,\" said Tom, a  bit heatedly, for he did not like the persistency of this man, nor did  he like his coming on the factory grounds unannounced and in this  secret manner. \"I told you I could not accept your offer. It is not  altogether a matter of money. My word was final.\"    \"Oh very well, if you put it that way,\" said Mr. Gale stiffly, \"of  course there is nothing more to say. But I thought perhaps you did not  consider we had offered you enough and--\"    \"Your offer is fair enough from a financial standpoint,\" said Tom; \"but  I simply cannot accept it. I have other plans.  Jackson!\" he called to  one of his mechanics who was passing, \"kindly see Mr. Gale to the gate,  and then let me know how it was any one came in here without a permit.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said the mechanic, as he stood significantly waiting.    \"There was no one at the gate when I came in,\" said Mr. Gale, and his  manner was antagonizing. \"I wanted to speak to you--to ask you to  reconsider your offer--so I came back.\"    \"It is against the rules to admit strangers to the shop grounds,\" said  Tom. \"Good-day!\"    The president of the Universal Flying Machine Company did not respond,  but there was a look on his face as he turned away that, had Tom seen  it, might have caused him some uneasiness. But he did not see. Instead,  he resumed his talk with Mr. Damon.    \"Tom, your idea is most interesting,\" declared the eccentric man. \"I  hope you will be able to work it out!\"    \"I'm going to try,\" said the young inventor. \"I hope that man--Mr.  Gale--didn't hear anything of what I was saying. He sneaked up on us  before I was aware any one was near but ourselves.\"    \"I don't imagine he heard very much, Tom,\" said Mr. Damon. \"He may have  heard you mention a silent motor--\"    \"That's just what I wish he hadn't heard,\" broke in Tom.  \"That's the  germ of the idea, and once it becomes known that I am working on that--  Well, there's no use crying over spilled milk,\" and he smiled at the  homely proverb. \"I'll have to work in secret, once I've started.\"    \"Do you think the government would use it, Tom?\" asked his friend.    \"I should think it would be glad to. Consider what a wonderful part  airships are playing in the present war. It really is a struggle to see  which will be the master of the sky--the Allies or the Germans--and, up  to recently, the Huns had the advantage.  Then the Allies, recognizing  how vital it was, began to forge ahead, and now Uncle Sam with his  troops under General Pershing is leading everything, or will lead  shortly. We have been a bit slow with our aircraft production, but now  we are booming along.  Uncle Sam will soon have the mastery of the sky.\"    \"I hope so,\" sighed Mr. Damon. \"We must beat the Germans!\"    Briefly, Tom spoke of what Pershing's men were doing with their  aeroplanes in France, and mention was made of what the French and  British had done prior to the entrance of the United States into the  World War.    \"While we were yet neutral, Americans had made gallant names for  themselves flying for France, and with my silent motor they ought to do  better,\" declared Tom.    \"Is silence its chief recommendation?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"Yes,\" replied Tom. \"Or rather, it will be when I have it perfected.  Aeroplane motors now are about as compact and speedy as they can be  made. It is only the terrific noise that is a handicap. It is a  handicap to the pilots and observers in the craft, as they cannot  communicate except through a special speaking tube, and this is not  always satisfactory or sure. Then, too, the noise of an airship  proclaims its approach to the enemy, sometimes long before it can be  seen.    \"With a silent motor all this would be done away with. With my new  craft, in case I can perfect it, the enemy's lines can be approached as  silently as the Indians used to approach the log cabins of the white  settlers. That will be its great advantage--not that conversation can  be more easily carried on, for that is, after all, an unimportant  detail. But to approach the enemy's lines in the silence of the night  would be a distinct gain.\"    \"I believe it would, Tom!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"And I should think,  too, that Uncle Sam would be glad to get such a motor,\" he added.    \"Well, he'll have one to take if he wants it, if I can make my plans a  success,\" declared Tom. \"That is, unless those other fellows get ahead  of me.\"    \"What other fellows?\" asked Mr. Damon.    \"Gale, Ware and their crowd,\" was the answer. \"I fancy they are  provoked because I wouldn't agree to work for them, and now, that Gale  overheard--as he must have--what I propose working on, they may try  that game themselves.\"    \"You mean try to turn out a silent motor?\"    \"Yes. It would be a big feather in their cap for their company, so far,  hasn't been very successful on government orders. That's why they came  to me, I guess.\"    \"I shouldn't be surprised, Tom,\" conceded Mr. Damon. \"Since the  government accepted your giant cannon and your great searchlight, you  have come into greater prominence than ever before. And those two  things are a wonderful success.\"    \"Yes,\" admitted Tom, modestly enough, \"the big electric light seems to  have been of some benefit on the European battle front, and though they  haven't been able to make and transport as many of my giant cannons as  I'd like to see over there, it is progressing, I understand.\"    And this is true.

Most of  the nautical technicalities would strike a seaman of the present day as  being quite modern. The sixteenth-century skipper would be readily  understood by a twentieth-century helmsman in the case of such orders as  these: _Keep full and by! Luff! Con her! Steady! Keep close!_ Our modern  sailor in the navy, however, would be hopelessly lost in trying to  follow directions like the following: _Make ready your cannons, middle  culverins, bastard culverins, falcons, sakers, slings, headsticks,  murderers, passevolants, bazzils, dogges, crook arquebusses, calivers,  and hail shot!_    Another look at life afloat in the sixteenth century brings us once more  into touch with America; for the old sea-dog DIRECTIONS FOR THE TAKYNG  OF A PRIZE were admirably summed up in _The Seaman's Grammar_, which was  compiled by 'Captaine John Smith, sometime Governour of Virginia and  Admiral of New England'--'Pocahontas Smith,' in fact.

He furls and slings his main-yard. In goes his sprit-sail.

CHAPTER IV    ELIZABETHAN ENGLAND      Elizabethan England is the motherland, the true historic home, of all  the different peoples who speak the sea-borne English tongue. In the  reign of Elizabeth there was only one English-speaking nation. This  nation consisted of a bare five million people, fewer than there are  to-day in London or New York. But hardly had the Great Queen died before  Englishmen began that colonizing movement which has carried their  language the whole world round and established their civilization in  every quarter of the globe. Within three centuries after Elizabeth's day  the use of English as a native speech had grown quite thirtyfold. Within  the same three centuries the number of those living under laws and  institutions derived from England had grown a hundredfold.    The England of Elizabeth was an England of great deeds, but of greater  dreams. Elizabethan literature, take it for all in all, has never been  surpassed; myriad-minded Shakespeare remains unequalled still.  Elizabethan England was indeed 'a nest of singing birds.' Prose was  often far too pedestrian for the exultant life of such a mighty  generation. As new worlds came into their expectant ken, the glowing  Elizabethans wished to fly there on the soaring wings of verse. To them  the tide of fortune was no ordinary stream but the 'white-maned, proud,  neck-arching tide' that bore adventurers to sea 'with pomp of waters  unwithstood.'    The goodly heritage that England gave her offspring overseas included  Shakespeare and the English Bible. The Authorized Version entered into  the very substance of early American life. There was a marked difference  between Episcopalian Virginia and Puritan New England. But both took  their stand on this version of the English Bible, in which the springs  of Holy Writ rejoiced to run through channels of Elizabethan prose. It  is true that Elizabeth slept with her fathers before this book of books  was printed, and that the first of the Stuarts reigned in her stead.  Nevertheless the Authorized Version is pure Elizabethan. All its  translators were Elizabethans, as their dedication to King James, still  printed with every copy, gratefully acknowledges in its reference to  'the setting of that bright Occidental Star, Queen Elizabeth of most  happy memory.'    These words of the reverend scholars contain no empty compliment.  Elizabeth was a great sovereign and in some essential particulars, a  very great national leader. This daughter of Henry VIII and his second  wife, Anne Boleyn the debonair, was born a heretic in 1533. Her father  was then defying both Spain and the Pope. Within three years after her  birth her mother was beheaded; and by Act of Parliament Elizabeth  herself was declared illegitimate. She was fourteen when her father  died, leaving the kingdom to his three children in succession, Elizabeth  being the third. Then followed the Protestant reign of the boy-king  Edward VI, during which Elizabeth enjoyed security; then the Catholic  reign of her Spanish half-sister, 'Bloody Mary,' during which her life  hung by the merest thread.    At first, however, Mary concealed her hostility to Elizabeth because she  thought the two daughters of Henry VIII ought to appear together in her  triumphal entry into London. From one point of view--and a feminine one  at that--this was a fatal mistake on Mary's part: for never did  Elizabeth show to more advantage. She was just under twenty, while Mary  was nearly twice her age. Mary had, indeed, provided herself with one  good foil in the person of Anne of Cleves, the 'Flemish mare' whose flat  coarse face and lumbering body had disgusted King Henry thirteen years  before, when Cromwell had foisted her upon him as his fourth wife. But  with poor, fat, straw-colored Anne on one side, and black-and-sallow,  foreign-looking, man-voiced Mary on the other, the thoroughly English  Princess Elizabeth took London by storm on the spot. Tall and majestic,  she was a magnificent example of the finest Anglo-Norman type. Always  'the glass of fashion' and then the very 'mould of form' her splendid  figure looked equally well on horseback or on foot. A little full in the  eye, and with a slightly aquiline nose, she appeared, as she really was,  keenly observant and commanding. Though these two features just  prevented her from being a beauty, the bright blue eyes and the finely  chiselled nose were themselves quite beautiful enough. Nor was she less  taking to the ear than to the eye; for, in marked contrast to gruff  foreign Mary and wheezy foreign Anne, she had a rich, clear, though  rather too loud, English voice. When the Court reined up and dismounted,  Elizabeth became even more the centre of"]]]
