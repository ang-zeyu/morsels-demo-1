It lasted about six months, from the first  accusations in March until the last executions in September.... It was  an epidemic of mad superstitious fear, bitterly to be regretted, and a  stain upon the high civilization of the Bay Colony.\" (_Historic Towns of  New England, Salem_, p. 148, LATIMER.)    What was done at Salem, when the tempest of unreason broke loose? Who  were the chief actors in it? This was done. From the first accusation in  March, 1692, to the last execution in September, 1692, nineteen persons  were hanged and one man was pressed to death[D] (_no witch was ever  burned in New England_), hundreds of innocent men and women were  imprisoned, or fled into exile or hiding places, their homes were broken  up, their estates were ruined, and their families and friends were left  in sorrow, anxiety, and desolation; and all this terrorism was wrought  at the instance of the chief men in the communities, the magistrates,  and the ministers.    [Footnote D: Fifty-five persons suffered torture, and twenty were  executed before the delusion ended. _Ency. Americana_ (Vol. 16,  \"Witchcraft\").]    Upham in his _Salem Witchcraft_ (Vol. II. pp. 249-250) thus pictures  the situation.    \"The prisons in Salem, Ipswich, Boston, and Cambridge, were crowded. All  the securities of society were dissolved. Every man's life was at the  mercy of every man. Fear sat on every countenance, terror and distress  were in all hearts, silence pervaded the streets; all who could, quit  the country; business was at a stand; a conviction sunk into the minds  of men, that a dark and infernal confederacy had got foot-hold in the  land, threatening to overthrow and extirpate religion and morality, and  establish the kingdom of the Prince of darkness in a country which had  been dedicated, by the prayers and tears and sufferings of its pious  fathers, to the Church of Christ and the service and worship of the true  God. The feeling, dismal and horrible indeed, became general, that the  providence of God was removed from them; that Satan was let loose, and  he and his confederates had free and unrestrained power to go to and  fro, torturing and destroying whomever he willed.\"    The trials were held by a Special Court, consisting of William  Stoughton, Peter Sergeant, Nath. Saltonstall, Wait Winthrop, Bartho'  Gedney, John Richards, Saml. Sewall, John Hathorne, Tho. Newton, and  Jonathan Corwin,--not one of them a lawyer.    Whatever his associates may have thought of their ways of doing God's  service, after the tragedy was over, Sewall, one of the most zealous of  the justices, made a public confession of his errors before the  congregation of the Old South Church, January 14, 1697. Were the  agonizing groans of poor old Giles Corey, pressed to death under planks  weighted with stones, or the prayers of the saintly Burroughs ringing in  his ears?    \"The conduct of Judge Sewall claims our particular admiration. He  observed annually in private a day of humiliation and prayer, during the  remainder of his life, to keep fresh in his mind a sense of repentance  and sorrow for the part he bore in the trials. On the day of the general  fast, he arose in the place where he was accustomed to worship, the old  South, in Boston, and in the presence of the great assembly, handed up  to the pulpit a written confession, acknowledging the error into which  he had been led, praying for the forgiveness of God and his people, and  concluding with a request, to all the congregation to unite with him in  devout supplication, that it might not bring down the displeasure of the  Most High upon his country, his family, or himself. He remained standing  during the public reading of the paper. This was an act of true  manliness and dignity of soul.\" (_Upham's Salem Witchcraft_, Vol. II, p.  441).    Grim, stern, narrow as he was, this man in his self-judgment commands  the respect of all true men.    The ministers stood with the magistrates in their delusion and  intemperate zeal. Two hundred and sixteen years after the last witch was  hung in Massachusetts a clearer light falls on one of the striking  personalities of the time--Cotton Mather--who to a recent date has been  credited with the chief responsibility for the Salem prosecutions.    Did he deserve it?    Robert Calef, in his _More Wonders of the Invisible World_, Bancroft in  his _History of the United States_, and Charles W. Upham in his _Salem  Witchcraft_, are the chief writers who have placed Mather in the  foreground of those dreadful scenes, as the leading minister of the  time, an active personal participant in the trials and executions, and a  zealot in the maintenance of the ministerial dignity and domination.    On the other hand, the learned scholar, the late William Frederick  Poole, first in the _North American Review_, in 1869, and again in his  paper _Witchcraft in Boston_, in 1882, in the _Memorial History of  Boston_, calls Calef an immature youth, and says that his obvious  intent, and that of the several unknown contributors who aided him, was  to malign the Boston ministers and to make a sensation.    And the late John Fiske, in his _New France and New England_ (p. 155),  holds that:    \"Mather's rules (of evidence) would not have allowed a verdict of guilty  simply upon the drivelling testimony of the afflicted persons, and if  this wholesome caution had been observed, not a witch would ever have  been hung in Salem.\"    What were those rules of evidence and of procedure attributed to Mather?  Through the Special Court appointed to hold the witch trials, and early  in its sittings, the opinions of twelve ministers of Boston and vicinity  were asked as to witchcraft. Cotton Mather wrote and his associates  signed an answer June 15, 1692, entitled, _The Return of Several  Ministers Consulted by his Excellency and the Honorable Council upon the  Present Witchcrafts in Salem Village_. This was the opinion of the  ministers, and it is most important to note what is said in it of  spectral evidence,[E] as it was upon such evidence that many convictions  were had:    \"1. The afflicted state of our poor neighbors that are now suffering by  molestations from the Invisible World we apprehend so deplorable, that  we think their condition calls for the utmost help of all persons in  their several capacities.    \"2. We cannot but with all thankfulness acknowledge the success which  the merciful God has given unto the sedulous and assiduous endeavors of  our honorable rulers to detect the abominable witchcrafts which have  been committed in the country; humbly praying that the discovery of  these mysterious and mischievous wickednesses may be perfected.    \"3. We judge that, in the prosecution of these and all such witchcrafts  there is need of a very critical and exquisite caution, lest by too much  credulity for things received only upon the devil's authority, there be  a door opened for a long train of miserable consequences, and Satan get  an advantage over us; for we should not be ignorant of his devices.    \"4. As in complaints upon witchcraft there may be matters of inquiry  which do not amount unto matters of presumption, and there may be  matters of presumption which yet may not be matters of conviction, so it  is necessary that all proceedings thereabout be managed with an  exceeding tenderness toward those that may be complained of, especially  if they have been persons formerly of an unblemished reputation.    \"5. When the first inquiry is made into the circumstances of such as  may lie under the just suspicion of witchcrafts, we could wish that  there may be admitted as little as possible of such noise, company and  openness as may too hastily expose them that are examined, and that  there may be nothing used as a test for the trial of the suspected, the  lawfulness whereof may be doubted by the people of God, but that the  directions given by such judicious writers as Perkins and Barnard may be  observed.    \"6. Presumptions whereupon persons may be committed, and much more,  convictions whereupon persons may be condemned as guilty of witchcrafts,  ought certainly to be more considerable than barely the accused persons  being represented by a spectre unto the afflicted, inasmuch as it is an  undoubted and notorious thing that a demon may by God's permission  appear even to ill purposes, in the shape of an innocent, yea, and a  virtuous man. Nor can we esteem alterations made in the sufferers, by a  look or touch of the accused, to be an infallible evidence of guilt, but  frequently liable to be abused by the devil's legerdemains.    \"7. We know not whether some remarkable affronts given the devils, by  our disbelieving these testimonies whose whole force and strength is  from them alone, may not put a period unto the progress of the dreadful  calamity begun upon us, in the accusation of so many persons whereof  some, we hope, are yet clear from the great transgression laid to their  charge.    \"8. Nevertheless, we cannot but humbly recommend unto the government,  the speedy and vigorous prosecutions of such as have rendered themselves  obnoxious, according to the directions given in the laws of God and the  wholesome statutes of the English nation for the detection of  witchcrafts.\"    [Footnote E: An illustration: The child Ann Putnam, in her testimony  against the Rev. Mr. Burroughs, said that one evening the apparition of  a minister came to her and asked her to write her name in the devil's  book. Then came the forms of two women in winding sheets, and looked  angrily upon the minister and scolded him until he was fain to vanish  away. Then the women told Ann that they were the ghosts of Mr.  Burroughs' first and second wives whom he had murdered.]    Did Longfellow, after a critical study of the original evidence and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12293"],[0,"Old Cookery Books and Ancient Cuisine (#6)"],[1,"table, and sprinkled with cummin, the body was roasted,  glazed with raw egg-yolk, and after being left to cool, was sewn back  again into the skin and so brought to table as the last course. In  1466, at the enthronement of Archbishop Nevile, no fewer than 104  peacocks were dressed.    The most extraordinary display of fish at table on a single occasion  took place at the enthronement feast of Archbishop Warham in 1504; it  occurred on a fast day; and consequently no meat, poultry or game was  included in the _menu_, but ample compensation was found in the lavish  assortment of confectionery, spices, beer and wine. Of wine of various  vintages there were upwards of 12 pipes, and of ale and beer, thirty  tuns, including four of London and six of Kentish ale.    The narratives which have descended to us of the prodigious banquets  given on special occasions by our early kings, prelates and nobles,  are apt to inspire the general reader with an admiration of the  splendid hospitality of bygone times. But, as I have already  suggested, these festivities were occasional and at long intervals,  and during the intervening space the great ones and the small ones of  mediaeval and early England did not indulge in this riotous sort of  living, but \"kept secret house,\" as it was called, both after their  own fashion. The extremes of prodigality and squalor were more  strongly marked among the poorer classes while this country was in  a semi-barbarous condition, and even the aristocracy by no means  maintained the same domestic state throughout the year as their modern  representatives. There are not those ostentatious displays of wealth  and generosity, which used to signalise certain political events, such  as the coronation of a monarch or the enthronement of a primate; the  mode of living has grown more uniform and consistent, since between  the vilain and his lord has interposed himself the middle-class  Englishman, with a hand held out to either.    A few may not spend so much, but as a people we spend more on our  table. A good dinner to a shepherd or a porter was formerly more than  a nine days' wonder; it was like a beacon seen through a mist. But now  he is better fed, clothed and housed than the bold baron, whose serf  he would have been in the good old days; and the bold baron, on his  part, no longer keeps secret house unless he chooses, and observes, if  a more monotonous, a more secure and comfortable tenor of life.  This change is of course due to a cause which lies very near the  surface--to the gradual effacement of the deeply-cut separating lines  between the orders of society, and the stealthy uprise of the class,  which is fast gathering all power into its own hands.          COOKERY BOOKS    PART 1.      The first attempt to illustrate this branch of the art must have been  made by Alexander Neckam in the twelfth century; at least I am not  aware of any older treatise in which the furniture and apparatus of a  kitchen are set forth.    But it is needless to say that Neckam merely dealt with a theme, which  had been familiar many centuries before his time, and compiled  his treatise, \"De Utensilibus,\" as Bishop Alfric had his earlier  \"Colloquy,\" with an educational, not a culinary, object, and with a  view to facilitate the knowledge of Latin among his scholars. It is  rather interesting to know that he was a native of St. Albans, where  he was born in 1157. He died in 1217, so that the composition of this  work of his (one of many) may be referred to the close of the twelfth  century. Its value is, in a certain sense, impaired by the almost  complete absence of English terms; Latin and (so called) Norman-French  being the languages almost exclusively employed in it. But we have  good reason indeed to be grateful for such a legacy in any shape, and  when we consider the tendency of ways of life to pass unchanged from  one generation to another, and when we think how many archaic and  (to our apprehension) almost barbarous fashions and forms in domestic  management lingered within living recollection, it will not be  hazarding much after all to presume that the particulars so casually  supplied to us by Neckam have an application alike before and after.    A student should also bear in mind that, from the strong Anglo-Gallic  complexion of our society and manners in early days, the accounts  collected by Lacroix are largely applicable to this country, and the  same facilities for administering to the comfort and luxuries of the  table, which he furnishes as illustrative of the gradual outgrowth  from the wood fire and the pot-au-feu among his own countrymen,  or certain classes of them, may be received as something like  counterparts of what we possessed in England at or about the same  period. We keep the phrase _pot luck_; but, for most of those who use  it, it has parted with all its meaning. This said production of  Neckam of St. Albans purports to be a guide to young housekeepers.  It instructs them what they will require, if they desire to see their  establishment well-ordered; but we soon perceive that the author has  in view the arrangements indispensable for a family of high rank and  pretensions; and it may be once for all observed that this kind of  literature seldom proves of much service to us in an investigation  of the state of the poor, until we come to the fifteenth or even  sixteenth century, when the artists of Germany and the Low Countries  began to delineate those scenes in industrial and servile life, which  time and change have rendered so valuable.    Where their superiors in rank regarded them as little more than  mechanical instruments for carrying on the business of life, the poor  have left behind them few records of their mode of sustenance and of  the food which enabled them to follow their daily toil. The anecdotes,  whatever they may be worth, of Alfred and the burnt cakes, and of Tom  Thumb's mamma and her Christmas pudding, made in a bowl, of which the  principal material was pork, stand almost alone; for we get, wherever  we look, nothing but descriptions by learned and educated men of their  equals or betters, how they fed and what they ate--their houses, their  furniture, their weapons, and their dress. Even in the passage of  the old fabliau of the \"King and the Hermit\" the latter, instead of  admitting us to a cottage interior, has a servant to wait on him,  brings out a tablecloth, lights two candles, and lays before his  disguised guest venison and wine. In most of our own romances, and  in the epics of antiquity, we have to be satisfied with vague and  splendid generalisations. We do not learn much of the dishes which  were on the tables, how they were cooked, and how [Greek: oi polloi]  cooked theirs.    The _Liber_, or rather _Codex, Princeps_ in the very long and  extensive catalogue of works on English Cookery, is a vellum roll  called the Form of Cury, and is supposed to have been written about  the beginning of the fifteenth century by the master-cook of Richard  II who reigned from 1377 to 1399, and spent the public money in eating  and drinking, instead of wasting it, as his grandfather had done, in  foreign wars. This singular relic was once in the Harleian collection,  but did not pass with the rest of the MSS. to the British Museum;  it is now however, Additional MS. 5016, having been presented to the  Library by Mr. Gustavus Brander. It was edited by Dr. Pegge in 1780,  and included by Warner in his \"Antiquitates Culinariae,\" 1791. The  Roll comprises 196 receipts, and commences with a sort of preamble  and a Table of Contents. In the former it is worth noting that the  enterprise was undertaken \"by the assent and avisement of masters of  physic and of philosophy, that dwelled in his (Richard II.'s) court,\"  which illustrates the ancient alliance between medicine and cookery,  which has not till lately been dissolved. The directions were to  enable a man \"to make common pottages and common meats for the  household, as they should be made, craftily and wholesomely;\" so that  this body of cookery was not prepared exclusively for the use of the  royal kitchen, but for those who had not the taste or wish for what  are termed, in contra-distinction, in the next sentence, \"curious  pottages, and meats, and subtleties.\" It is to be conjectured that  copies of such a MS. were multiplied, and from time to time reproduced  with suitable changes; but with the exception of two different, though  nearly coeval, collections, embracing 31 and 162 receipts or nyms, and  also successively printed by Pegge and Warner, there is no apparent  trace of any systematic compilation of this nature at so remote a  date.    The \"Form of Cury\" was in the 28 Eliz., in the possession of the  Stafford family, and was in that year presented to the Queen by  Edward, Lord Stafford, as is to be gathered from a Latin memorandum  at the end, in his lordship's hand, preserved by Pegge and Warner in  their editions. The fellowship between the arts of healing and cooking  is brought to our recollection by a leonine verse at the end of one of  the shorter separate collections above described:--      \"Explicit de Coquina    Quae est optima Medicina.\"    The \"Form of Cury\" will amply remunerate a study. It presents the  earliest mention, so far as I can discern, of olive oil, cloves, mace,  and gourds. In the receipts for making Aigredouce and Bardolf, sugar,  that indispensable feature in the _cuisine_, makes its appearance; but  it does so, I should add, in such a way as to lead to the belief  that the use of sugar was at this time becoming more general. The  difficulty, at first, seems to have been in refining it. We encounter  here, too, onions under the name borrowed from the French instead of  the Anglo-Saxon form \"ynne leac\"; and the prescriptions for making  messes of almonds, pork, peas, and beans are numerous. There is  \"Saracen sauce,\" moreover, possibly as old as the"]]]
