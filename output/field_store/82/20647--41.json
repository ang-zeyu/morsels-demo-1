THE COURSE OF THE NIGER.      The discovery of the termination of the course of the Niger, will be of  the greatest importance to geography, to our political power, and to  civilization.    With regard to geography, perhaps the contradiction which was afforded  by the various sources whence we derived our knowledge of the character  of the interior of Africa, and of the course of, next to the Nile, the  most renowned, and, as was considered from the same accounts, the  greatest river of that country, have in late times given unlimited zest  in the pursuit of further information, and has not in the least  detracted from the pleasure with which we find that we are indebted to  our countrymen for the solution of this all-absorbing problem. It  appears, that among the ancients many facts connected with the geography  of the interior of Africa were well known, which have still been an  object of discussion among the moderns; and of these, we may enumerate  the occurrence of a large lake or marsh (for it is either, at different  seasons of the year), whose real existence, beyond the speculations of  geographers, was very unsatisfactorily established, until the journey of  Denham and Clapperton; and the fact of the occurrence of a great river  in the west, emptying itself into the ocean, though many were of opinion  that it lost itself in an inland marsh, or in the desert, while others  supported the opinion of its identity with the Nile of the Egyptians.  The researches of Ptolemy and the Arabian geographers on the Nile of the  Negroes, and in later times the travels of Leo Africanus, who was a Moor  of Grenada, demonstrated the absurdity of this opinion; and how  extraordinary that, in the boasted perfection of human intellect, it  should have been broached several centuries afterwards, and that the  barometric levellings of Bruce should have been necessary to enforce  conviction! It is not at all improbable that Hanno, the Carthaginian, as  advanced by Macqueen, reached the Bight of Benin, or of Biafra; and  certainly the geographical information obtained on these countries by  Herodotus and Edrisi was more accurate than the speculations of many  modern geographers. Observation had demonstrated to the moderns that no  large river emptied itself into the ocean on the north-west coast,  though it required a more accurate acquaintance with the Senegal and the  Gambia before it was fully ascertained that they were not the outlets of  this great stream. The progress of navigation along the south-eastern  shores of Africa also showed that no large river emptied itself into the  sea along that coast; while the settlements of the Portuguese on the  coast to the south of Cape Lopez, led them, at an early period, to adopt  the opinion afterwards supported by Mungo Park and Mr. Barrow, that one  or more of the rivers in their vicinity were the outlets of the great  river of the interior of Africa. Two celebrated geographers, D'Anville  and Major Rennell, however, espoused the theory of the waters emptying  themselves into the Wangara, or great marsh; which argument underwent  various modifications in the hands of different geographers; and though  the probability of its emptying itself into the Gulf of Guinea had been  pointed out on the continent, and vigorously supported in this country,  an expedition was fitted out to explore the Congo or Zaire, which,  though unfortunate to the individuals concerned, was yet satisfactory in  a geographical point of view, and demonstrated that the rivers south of  Cape Lopez were not the outlets of the waters of the Niger, and gave  origin to a speculation which partook of all the characters of a romance  of the desert, beneath the sands of which its author buried the gigantic  stream, loaded with the waters of the Wangara or Lake Tchad, to make it  flow into the Mediterranean at the Syrtis of the ancients.    In the history of geography there are no examples of greater  perseverance and courageous determination than in the efforts made to  triumph over the difficulties presented in the solution of this  important question. Since 1815, there has scarcely a year passed in  which a new attempt has not been made; and of these, if we recede a  little farther back, twenty-five were made by our countrymen, fourteen  by Frenchmen, two by Americans, and one by a German; of which but a  small number, since the days of Houghton, have not fallen victims to  their heroic devotion.    Mungo Park first observed the direction of the stream which had become  as much an object of discussion as its termination; and, strange to say,  after the present discovery, it will, in some parts of its course, still  remain so. The unfortunate traveller just alluded to, previous to his  descent of the river, obtained some information from Moors and from  negroes, on its course by Timbuctoo. The Jinnie of Park is synonymous  with Jenne, Gine, Dhjenne, of other writers, as Jenne has again been  confounded with Kano or Kanno. It may be a figurative term--for the  Jinnie of Park was on an island, as was the Jenne of the Moorish  reports, while the Jenne of some travellers is at a short distance from  the river. This cannot be the case with regard to Timbuctoo, which is  visited by caravans twice a year from Morocco; nor is the name met with  any where, except the two first syllables in the town of Timbo, which  cannot be mistaken for Timbuctoo.    Major Laing had discovered the source of the Niger to be in the  mountains of Loma, in 9 deg. 15 min. west latitude, and had ascertained  its course for a short distance from its source. We were also aware of  the existence of one or two streams joining the great river, or  branching from it near Timbuctoo. De Lisle had marked a river Gambarra,  on his maps drawn up for Louis XV., and not without good authority. This  is the river coming from Houssa; and the Joliba of modern travellers is  a river, we could prove, from the concurring testimony of a variety of  sources, coming from the north-west, and joining its waters with, that  is to say flowing into the Niger, in the immediate neighbourhood of  Timbuctoo; still at that point the Kowarra, or Quorra of the Moors, or  Quolla of the Negroes, who always change the _r_ for _l_ a name which,  according to Laing, it has at its sources--according to Clapperton, it  preserves beyond Timbuctoo, and is probably still the name of the same  stream at its embouchure in the Bight of Biafra. The Quarrama is another  tributary stream which passes by Saccatoo, and falls into the Quorra  above Youri, and above the point where Mungo Park was wrecked; and the  line of country between this river and the Shashum, comprising the hills  of Doochee, of Naroo, and of Dull, is the line of water-shed to the  rivers joining the Quorra on the one hand, and those emptying themselves  into the Wangara on the other. The course given by Sultan Bello, and the  information obtained by Major Denham, both pointed out a river coursing  to the east, which is probably the branch followed by the Landers: for  its termination in Lake Tchad had not even the air of probability;  though it is not, on the other-hand, at all improbable that other  branches empty themselves into the Bight of Benin, by the rivers  Formosa or Volta, according to information given to Captain Clapperton  and Major Laing.    We had intended to embody some remarks upon the pretended journey of  Caillie; but we find we have already occupied too much space in details  necessary to make the geographical nature of the question well  understood; and we shall content ourselves with remarking, that the  discovery of the termination of the Quorra, or Niger, tends to throw a  degree of improbability upon the narrative of that individual, which it  will require much ingenuity to explain away. It is certain that the  latitude given to Timbuctoo by the editor of those travels, and upon  which sufficient ridicule has already been thrown in the Edinburgh  Geographical Journal, may be considered as an error entirely of the  editor's, who, by taking it upon himself, will relieve the burden of the  mistake from the traveller, and thus lighten the weighty doubts which  might in consequence bear upon the remainder of the details; for the  situation of that city, as given by Jomard, is quite inconsistent with  the situation it must be in, from the ascertained source, direction, and  termination of the river. There can be no doubt but that a portion of  the labours presented to the public as the travels of Caillie are  founded upon valid documents, wherever obtained, and probably most of  the errors are those of the editor. But though authorities can be found  in support of the division of the Quorra into two branches; one of  which, the Joliba, flows to the north-west, and the other in an almost  opposite direction,--fact which has no analogy in geography, and, what  is better, no existence in nature; yet no authority can be found for  placing Timbuctoo on a river flowing north from the Niger.    The details which will be given to us by the results of this successful  expedition will, then, not only be of assistance in allying the existing  condition of things with the knowledge of the ancients, but it will  enable us to reduce to a few facts the many contradictory statements  which have originated in the variety of the sources of information, and  the individual and national rivalry which the interest of the question  gave birth to among the geographers of the present day. It will also be  of importance, as it was connected with a great question, as to the  possibility of a large river traversing an extensive continent, or  losing itself in a marsh or lake, or being buried in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13117"],[0,"The Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds, Volume 1 (#6)"],[1,"tall trees.\"    Dr. Jerdon says:--\"It builds in Cashmere in old ruined palaces, holes  in rocks, beneath roofs of houses, and also in tall trees, laying four  to six eggs, pale bluish green, clotted and spotted with brownish  black.\"    Mr. Brookes writes:--\"The Jackdaw breeds in Cashmere in all suitable  places: holes in old Chinar (Plane) trees, and in house-walls, under  the eaves of houses, &c. I did not note the materials of the nests,  but these will be the same as in England.\"    The eggs of this species are typically rather elongated ovals,  somewhat compressed towards one end. The shell is fine, but has only a  faint gloss. The ground-colour is a pale greenish white, but in some  eggs there is very little green, while in a very few the ground is  quite a bright green. The markings, sometimes very fine and close,  sometimes rather bold and thinly set, consist of specks or spots of  deep blackish brown, olive-brown, and pale inky purple. In most eggs  all these colours are represented, but in some eggs the olive-, in  others the blackish-brown is almost entirely wanting. In some eggs  the markings are very dense towards the large end, in others they are  pretty uniformly distributed over the whole surface; in some they are  very minute and speckly, in others they average the tenth of an inch  in diameter.    The eggs that I possess vary from 1.34 to 1.52 in length, and from  0.93 to 1.02 in breadth; but the average of sixteen eggs was 1.4 by  0.98.      10. Pica rustica (Scop.). _The Magpie_.    Pica bactriana, _Bp., Hume, Rough Draft N. & E_, no. 668 bis.    The Magpie breeds, we know, in Afghanistan, and also throughout Ladak  from the Zojee-la Pass right up to the Pangong Lake, but it breeds so  early that one is never in time for the eggs. The passes are not open  until long after they are hatched.    Captain Hutton says this bird \"is found all the year round from  Quettah to Girishk, and is very common. They breed in March, and the  young are fledged by the end of April. The nest is like that of the  European bird, and all the manners of the Afghan Magpie are precisely  the same. They may be seen at all seasons.\"    From Afghanistan, Lieut. H.E. Barnes writes:--    \"The Magpie is not uncommon in the hills wherever there are trees, but  it seldom descends to the plains. They commence breeding in March, in  which month and April I have examined scores of nests, which in every  case were built in the 'Wun,' a species of _Pistacia_--the only tree  found hereabouts. A stout fork near the top is usually selected.    \"The nest is shallow and cup-shaped, with a superstructure of twigs,  forming a canopy over the egg-cavity. The eggs, generally five in  number, are of the usual corvine green, blotched, spotted, and  streaked, as a rule, most densely about the large end with umber  mingled with sepia-brown. The average of thirty eggs is 1.25 by .97.\"    Colonel Biddulph writes in 'The Ibis' that in Gilgit he took a nest  with five eggs, hard set, in a mulberry-tree at Nonval (5600 feet) on  the 9th May. Also another nest with three fresh eggs at Dayour(5200  feet) on the 25th May.    The eggs are typically rather elongated ovals, rather pointed towards  the small end, but shorter and broader varieties, and occasionally  ones with a pyriform tendency, occur. The ground is a greenish or  brownish white. In some eggs it has none, in others a slight gloss.  Everywhere the eggs are finely and streakly freckled with a brown that  varies from olive almost to sepia; about the large end the markings  are almost always most dense, forming there a more or less noticeable,  but quite irregular and undefined cap or zone. In one or two eggs dull  purplish-brown clouds or blotches underlie and intermingle with this  cap, and occasionally a small spot of this same tint may be noticed  elsewhere when the egg is closely examined.      12.

I have never myself found the nest of the Red-billed Blue Magpie;  although it does breed sparingly as far east as Simla and Kotegurh,  it is not till you cross the Jumna that it is abundant. East of the  Jumna, about Mussoorie, Teeree, Grurhwal, Kumaon, and in Nepal, it is  common.    From Mussoorie Captain Hutton tells us that \"this species occurs at  Mussoorie throughout the year. It breeds at an elevation of 5000 feet  in May and June, making a loose nest of twigs externally and lined  with roots. The nest is built on trees, sometimes high up, at others  about 8 or 10 feet from the ground. The eggs are from three to five,  of a dull greenish ash-grey, blotched and speckled with brown dashes  confluent at the larger end, the ends nearly equal in size. It is very  terrene in its habits, feeding almost entirely on the ground.\"    Colonel G.F.L. Marshall remarks:--    \"The Red-billed Blue Magpie is, as far as I know, an early breeder at  Naini Tal; common as the bird is I have only found one nest and that  on the 24th April; it was a shallow slenderly built structure of fine  roots, chiefly of maiden-hair fern, in a rough outer casing of twigs,  placed on a horizontal bough overhanging a nullah about fifteen feet  from the ground. The tree had moderately dense foliage, and was about  twenty-five feet high in a small clump on a hillside covered with low  scrub at 5000 feet elevation above the sea. Around the nest several  small boughs and twigs grew out, and being very slight in structure it  was not easy to see. The old bird sat very close. There were six eggs  in the nest about half-incubated: in two of them the markings were  densest at the small end. The egg-cavity was 6 inches in diameter by  about 11/4 deep. On the 5th June I saw old birds accompanied by young  ones able to fly, but without the long tails.\"    The eggs of this species much resemble those of the European Magpie,  but are considerably smaller. They are broad, rather perfect ovals,  somewhat elongated and pointed in many specimens. They exhibit but  little gloss. The ground-colour varies much, but in all the examples  that I possess, which I owe to Captain Hutton's kindness, it is either  of a yellowish-cream, pale _cafe au lait_ or buff colour, or pale dull  greenish. The ground is profusely blotched, spotted, and streaked (the  general character of the markings being striations parallel to the  major axis), with various shades of reddish and yellowish, brown and  pale inky purple. The markings vary much in intensity as well as in  frequency, some being so closely set as to hide the greater part of  the ground-colour; but in the majority of the eggs they are more or  less confluent at the large end, where they form a comparatively dark,  irregular blotchy zone.    The eggs vary from 1.25 to 1.4 in length, and from 0.89 to 0.96 in  breadth; but the average of 11 eggs is 1.33 by 0.93.    Major Bingham, referring to the Burmese Magpie, which has been  separated under by the name of _U. magnirostris_, says:--    \"This species I have only found common in the Thoungyeen Valley.  Elsewhere it seemed to me scarce. Below I give a note about its  breeding.    \"I have found three nests of this handsome Magpie--two on the bank  of the Meplay choung on the 14th April, 1879, and 5th March, 1880,  respectively, and one near Meeawuddy on the Thoungyeen river on the  19th March, 1880.    \"The first contained three, the second four, and the third two eggs.    \"These are all of the same type, dead white, with pale claret-coloured  clashes and spots rather washed-out looking, and lying chiefly at the  large end. One egg has the spots thicker at the small end. They are  moderately broad ovals, and vary from 1.19 to 1.35 in length, and from  0.93 to 1.08 in breadth.    \"The nests were all alike, thick solid structures of twigs and  branches, lined with finer twigs about 8 or 9 inches in diameter,  and placed invariably at the top of tall straight saplings of teak,  pynkado (_Xylia dolabriformis_), and other trees at a height of about  15 feet from the ground.\"    All the eggs of the Burmese bird that I have seen, nine taken by Major  Bingham, were of one and the same type. The eggs broad ovals, in most  cases pointed towards the small end. The shell fine, but as a rule  with scarcely any perceptible gloss. The ground-colour a delicate  creamy white. The markings moderate-sized blotches, spots, streaks,  and specks, as a rule comparatively dense about one, generally the  large, end, where only as a rule any at all considerable sized  blotches occur, elsewhere more or less sparsely set, and generally of  a speckly character. The markings are of two colours: brown, varying  in shade in different eggs, olive-yellowish, chocolate, and a grey,  equally varying in different eggs from pale purple to pale sepia. None  of my eggs of the Himalayan bird (I have unfortunately but few of  these) correspond at all closely with these.      13. Urocissa flavirostris (Bl.). _The Yellow-billed Blue Magpie_.    Urocissa flavirostris (_Bl.), Jerd. B. Ind._ ii, p. 310; _Hume, Rough  Draft N. & E._ no. 672.    The Yellow-billed Blue Magpie breeds throughout the lower ranges of  the Himalayas in well-wooded localities from Hazara to Bhootan, and  very likely further east still, from April to August, mostly however,  I think, laying in May. The nest, which is rather coarse and large,  made of sticks and lined with fine grass or grass-roots, is, so far  as my experience goes, commonly placed in a fork near the top of some  moderate-sized but densely foliaged tree.    I have never found a nest at a lower elevation than about 5000 feet;  as a rule they are a good deal higher up.    They lay from four to six eggs, but the usual number is five.    Colonel C.H.T. Marshall writes:--\"The Yellow-billed Blue Magpie breeds  commonly about Murree. I have never seen the bird below 6000 feet"]]]
