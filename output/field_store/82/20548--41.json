On these occasions his dress was  the most ludicrous imaginable, being compounded of remnants of pristine  finery, such as his wardrobe could afford, without attention to uniformity,  or consistency of colour. Above all, he possessed a pair of light pea-green  small clothes, on which he much prided himself, and I swore by old Trunnion  to be their murderer. His custom on the aforesaid visits was to dress  early, and then hastily to dismiss his lessons, and proceed immediately.    Having gained intelligence of an approaching field day, we prepared a  strong solution of gum, with which we varnished the bottom of a leather  chair upon which he sat in the school. The morning came, his green _media_  and white silk stockings were hailed with the most extravagant but secret  exultation. He seated himself, and let us run as we pleased through our  tasks, with an unusual portion of smiles and pleasantries, and then looking  at his watch, he attempted hastily to rise! in vain--there seemed an  indissoluble bond of union between him and the chair; the most grotesque  series of strugglings ensued, and by one desperate effort he was erect, a  thin coating of the black leather which he had torn off, firmly adhering to  his dress! Nothing abated my delight at my success, but the thought that my  magnus Apollo, Pickle, was not there to enjoy it; to see the poor Count  stand mute with a mixed passion of rage and distress for several seconds,  and then to witness his fruitless attempts to view the full extent of the  injury, which, notwithstanding the surprising flexibility of his vertebrae,  he was unable to compass. Tom Pipes I felt certain would have died on the  spot, he must have split.    _The Inspector_.           *       *       *       *       *      CONTRAST OF CLIMATE.      Suppose yourself to have spent the first half of a foggy, sleety, chill,  moist, melancholy, English winter at some miserable country village in  Kent. Suppose about the first of February, while the whole landscape around  is still floating in mud, buried in snow, or fast bound by frost, and the  atmosphere so thick with fog, that one can scarcely point at mid-day to the  spot where the sun stands in the heavens,--that your catarrh grows so  alarming, that in a fit of despondency you trundle yourself aboard a ship  in the Downs getting under way for a warmer climate. Suppose, that after a  smacking run of about eight days before a fresh gale, (during the whole of  which you are of course too sick and qualmy to leave your cot,) you awake  one morning, and find yourself snugly at anchor in the bay of Funchal; and  the romantic, sun-bright mountains of Madeira, gorgeously crested with a  mass of brilliant clouds, looking in at your cabin-window. It seems  downright enchantment! You leap up as if there was a new soul in your body.  You hurry ashore in the first boat. Your cough, lassitude, and qualmishness  have altogether left you. Your step is elastic, and your spirits as buoyant  as a lark in spring. You luxuriate amidst beautiful gardens glowing with  roses, jessamines, honey-suckles, and a thousand other odoriferous shrubs  and flowers in full bloom. You wander through a boundless maze of rising  vineries curling their budding tendrils around the trellis-work, and  terrace above terrace up the declivities of the mountains. You recline  among orange-groves bending under the load of ripe golden fruit; and as you  stretch yourself at ease by some clear, gurgling rill, in the midst of all  this loveliness, you ask yourself, is this a dream--or are these indeed the  gardens of the Hesperides? Reader, if you have the blue devils at  Christmas, you may realize all this, and reach Madeira, as I have done, in  eight days from the Downs.    _London Weekly Review._           *       *       *       *       *        THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF _NEW WORKS_.           *       *       *       *       *      ANECDOTES OF THE FACULTY.      _Quacks._      We are not without plenty of ignorant and impudent pretenders at the  present day; but the celebrated Mrs. Mapp, the bone-setter of Epsom,  surpasses them all. She was the daughter of a man named Wallis, a  bone-setter at Hindon, in Wiltshire, and sister to the celebrated \"Polly  Peachem,\" who married the Duke of Bolton. Upon some _family quarrel_,  Sally Wallis left her professional parent, and wandered up and down the  country in a miserable manner, calling herself \"Crazy Sally,\" and pursuing,  in her perambulations, a course that fairly justified the title. Arriving  at last at Epsom, she succeeded in humbugging the worthy bumpkins of that  place, so decidedly, that a subscription was set on foot to keep her among  them; but her fame extending to the metropolis, the dupes of London, a  numerous class then as well as now, thought it no trouble to go ten miles  to see the conjuror, till at length, she was pleased to bless the afflicted  of London with her presence, and once a week drove to the Grecian  Coffee-house, in a coach and six with out-riders! and all the appearance of  nobility. It was in one of these journeys, passing through Kent-street, in  the Borough, that being taken for a certain woman of quality from the  Electorate in Germany, a great mob followed, and bestowed on her many  bitter reproaches, till madame, perceiving some mistake, looked out of the  window, and accosted them in this gentle manner, \"D----n your bloods, don't  you know me? I am Mrs. Mapp, the _bone-setter!_\" Upon which, they instantly  changed their revilings into loud huzzas.    _Wadd's Mems., Maxims, and Memoirs._      _Dr. Radcliffe._      Among the many singularities related of Radcliffe, it has been noticed,  that when he was in a convivial party, he was unwilling to leave it, even  though sent for by persons of the highest distinction. Whilst he was thus  deeply engaged at a tavern, he was called on by a grenadier, who desired  his immediate attendance on his _colonel_; but no entreaties could prevail  on the disciple of Esculapius to postpone his sacrifice to Bacchus. \"Sir,\"  quoth the soldier, \"_my orders are to bring you._\" And being a very  powerful man, he took him up in his arms, and carried him off per force.  After traversing some dirty lanes, the doctor and his escort arrived at a  narrow alley--\"What the D----l is all this,\" said Radcliffe, \"your colonel  don't live here?\"--\"No,\" said his military friend,--\"no, my _colonel_ does  not live here--but my _comrade_ does, and he's worth _two_ of the  _colonel_,--so, by G----d, doctor, if you don't do your _best_ for _him_,  it will be the _worst_ for _you!_\"      _Duels._      Many medical duels have been prevented by the difficulty of arranging the  \"methodus pugnandi.\" In the instance of Dr. Brocklesby, the number of  paces could not be agreed upon; and in the affair between Akenside and  Ballow, one had determined never to fight in the morning, and the other  that he would never fight in the afternoon. John Wilkes, who did not stand  upon ceremony in these little affairs, when asked by Lord Talbot, \"How many  times they were to fire?\" replied, \"just as often as your Lordship pleases;  I have brought _a bag of bullets and a flask of gunpowder_.\"      _William Hunter._      Dr. William Hunter used to relate the following anecdote:--During the  American war, he was consulted by the daughter of a peer, who confessed  herself pregnant, and requested his assistance; he advised her to retire  for a time to the house of some confidential friend; she said that was  impossible, as her father would not suffer her to be absent from him a  single day. Some of the servants were, therefore, let into the secret, and  the doctor made his arrangement with the treasurer of the Foundling  Hospital for the reception of the child, for which he was to pay  190l.--The lady was desired to weigh well if she could bear pain without  alarming the family by her cries; she said \"Yes,\"--and she kept her word.  At the usual period she was delivered, not of one child only, but of twins.  The doctor, bearing the two children, was conducted by a French servant  through the kitchen, and left to ascend the area steps into the street.  Luckily the lady's maid recollected that the door of the area might perhaps  be locked; and she followed the doctor just in time to prevent his being  detained at the gate. He deposited the children at the Foundling Hospital,  and paid for each 100l. The father of the children was a colonel of the  army, who went with his regiment to America, and died there. The mother  afterwards married a person of her own rank.      _John Hunter._      Hunter was a philosopher in more senses than one; he had philosophy enough  to bear prosperity, as well as adversity, and with a rough exterior was a  very kind man. The poor could command his services more than the rich. He  would see an industrious tradesman before a duke, when his house was full  of grandees, \"you have no time to spare,\" he would say, \"you live by it;  most of these can wait, they have nothing to do when they go home.\" No man  cared less for the profits of the profession, or more for the honour of  it. He cared not for money himself, and wished the Doctor [his brother  William] to estimate it by the same scale, when he sent a poor man with  this laconic note:--        \"Dear Brother,--The bearer wants your advice. I do not know the      nature of the case. He has no money, and you have plenty, so you are      well met.\"        \"Yours, J. HUNTER.\"    He was applied to once to perform a serious operation on a tradesman's  wife; the fee agreed upon was twenty guineas. He heard no more of the case  for two months; at the end of which time he was called upon to perform it.  In the course of his attendance, he found out that the cause of the delay  had been the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11331"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

So strong was this ruling passion, that when the patriot army has been  closely pursued by the royalists, and pay has been issued to lighten the  military chest, the officers, upon halting, would spread their ponchos on  the ground, and play until it was time to resume the march; and this was  frequently done even on the eve of a battle. Soldiers on piquet often  gambled within sight of an enemy's advanced post.    _Memoirs of Gen. Miller._           *       *       *       *       *        THE NATURALIST.           *       *       *       *       *      VOLCANIC ISLAND OF ST. CHRISTOPHER.      This island is entirely composed of volcanic matter, in some places  alternating with submarine productions. The principal mountain is situated  at the western end of the island; it is an exhausted volcano, called in  books of navigation, charts, &c., Mount Misery. The summit of this mountain  is 3,711 feet above the sea; it appears to consist of large masses of  volcanic rocks, roasted stones, cinders, pumice, and iron-clay. The whole  extent of land, to the sea-shore on either side, may be considered as the  base of this mountain, as it rises with a pretty steep ascent towards it;  but from the part which is generally considered the foot of the mountain,  it takes a sudden rise of an average angle of about 50 degrees. To the  east, another chain of mountains runs, of a similar formation, though of  inferior height. On the summits of these there are no remains that indicate  their having ever possessed a crater: so that whether any of them have  originally been volcanoes, or whether they have been formed by an  accumulation of matter thrown out of Mount Misery, it is difficult to  decide. That the low lands have been thrown from the mouth of the volcano  is evident, from the regular strata of volcanic substances of which they  consist; these too are interspersed with masses of volcanic rock, and other  stones, some of the lesser ones entirely roasted through, and some of the  larger ones to certain depths from their surfaces. Masses, also, of  iron-clay, enclosing various pebbles, which have been burnt into a kind of  red brick, are abundantly found in many places. There is scarcely any thing  that can be called a path, or even a track, to the mouth of the crater of  Mount Misery; indeed, there are but few whose curiosity is sufficiently  strong to induce them to undertake this expedition. The common course for  those who do, is to take a negro man as a guide, with a cutlass, or large  knife, to clear away the underwood, and form a kind of path as he goes on.  The ascent is very irregular, in some places being gentle, in others almost  perpendicular; in which case the hands are obliged to assist the operations  of the feet. In wet weather, the ascent of this mountain is extremely  laborious, as a great part of it consists of clay, which then becomes so  slippery as to render the getting up almost impracticable. About half-way  up on the south side, and in a very pretty, romantic situation, there is a  natural spring of remarkably cool water. On the north side, at about the  same height, there is a waterfall, which, though small and insignificant in  itself, has a pleasing appearance, as it rushes over the rocks, and through  the trees and shrubs. This mountain is thickly clothed with wood, which in  many places not only excludes the rays of the sun, but produces a sombre,  gloomy appearance; this, with the occasional plaintive coo of the mountain  dove, (the only sound heard at this height,) creates in the mind sensations  of pleasing melancholy. In some parts an open space suddenly appears, from  whence the whole country below bursts unexpectedly upon the view, which  has, as may be supposed, an extremely fine effect. The thermometer, on the  top of the mountain when the writer visited it, stood at 65, being a  difference of 15 degrees from the low lands, where it stood at 80 degrees.  The descent into the crater on the north and east sides is perfectly  perpendicular; on the south and west sides, it slopes at an average angle  of not more than 18 or 20 degrees from the perpendicular; consequently,  persons descending are often obliged to let themselves down by clinging to  projecting corners of rocks, or the branches and roots of shrubs, which  grow all the way down; nor is this mode of travelling particularly safe,  for should any of these give way, the consequence would probably be highly  dangerous. The bottom of the crater, which, as nearly as could be  estimated, is about 2,500 feet below the summit of the mountain, and  contains about forty-five or fifty acres, may be said to be divided into  three parts: the lowest side (to the south) consists of a large pond or  lake, formed entirely by the rain-water collected from the sides of the  crater--accordingly its extent is greater or less, as the season is wet or  dry; the centre part is covered with small ferns, palms, and shrubs, and  some curious species of moss; the upper part, to the north, is that which  is called the Soufriere. The ground here consists of large beds of  pipe-clay, in some places perfectly white, in others of a bluish or black  colour, from the presence of iron pyrites. These are intermixed with masses  and irregular beds of gray cinders and score, pumice, various kinds of  lava, lithomarge, and fuller's earth. Amidst these beds of clay there are  several hot springs, small, but boiling with much violence, and emitting  large quantities of steam. A rumbling noise is heard under the whole of  this part of the crater. The hot springs are not stationary, but suddenly  disappear, and burst up in another place. The ground in many parts is too  hot to be walked upon: a great quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen gas is  likewise emitted, which is exceedingly disagreeable to the smell; and  occasionally such a volume of it arises, as is almost suffocating, and  resembles much the smell of rotten eggs. The watches of the writer and his  companion during his visit, and every article of gold or silver about their  persons, were in a few moments turned perfectly black, from the effect of  this gas.    _Brande's Journal._           *       *       *       *       *        MANNERS & CUSTOMS OF ALL NATIONS.           *       *       *       *       *      ROYAL LIFE IN PERSIA.      The religious duties of the king of Persia require him to rise early. As he  sleeps in the interior apartments, which no male is allowed to approach,  his attendants are either females or eunuchs. After he is dressed with  their aid, he sits for an hour or two in the hall of the haram, where his  levees are conducted with the same ceremony as in his outer apartments.  Female officers arrange the crowd of his wives and slaves with the  strictest attention to the order of precedency. After hearing the reports  of the persons intrusted with the internal government of the haram, and  consulting with his principal wives, who are generally seated, the monarch  leaves the interior apartments. The moment he comes out, he is met by  officers in waiting, and proceeds to one of his private halls, where he is  immediately joined by some of his principal favourites, and enters into  familiar conversation with them: all the young princes of the blood attend  this morning levee, to pay their respects. After this is over, he calls for  breakfast. The preparing his meals is superintended by the nauzir, or chief  steward of the household. The viands are put into dishes of fine china,  with silver covers, and placed in a close tray, which is locked and sealed  by the steward. This tray is covered with a rich shawl, and carried to the  king, when the steward breaks the seal, and places the dishes before him.  Some of the infant princes are generally present, and partake in this  repast. The chief physician is invariably in attendance at every meal. His  presence is deemed necessary, the courtiers say, that he may prescribe an  instant remedy, if any thing should disagree with the monarch; but this  precaution, no doubt, owes its origin to that suspicion which is  continually haunting the minds of such as exercise despotic power. When his  public duties are performed, he usually retires to the haram, where he  sometimes indulges in a short repose. Some time before sunset he always  makes his appearance in the outer apartments, and either again attends to  public business or takes a ride. His dinner is brought between eight and  nine, with the same precautions and ceremonies as at breakfast. He eats,  like his subjects, seated upon a carpet, and the dishes are placed on a  rich embroidered cloth, spread for the occasion. Some of the former kings  used to indulge openly in drinking wine; but none of the reigning family  have yet outraged the religious feelings of their subjects by so flagrant a  violation of the laws of Mahomed. Bowls filled with sherbet, made of every  species of fruit, furnish the beverage of the royal meals; and there are  few countries where more pains are bestowed to gratify the palate with the  most delicate viands. After dinner, the king retires to the interior  apartments, where it is said that he is often amused till a late hour by  the singers and dancers of his haram. It is impossible, however, to speak  of his occupations after he passes the threshold of his inner palace. He is  there surrounded by a scene calculated, beyond all others, to debase and  degrade the human character.    The harams are governed by the strictest discipline; and this must be  necessary to preserve the peace of a community, where the arrogance of  power, the pride of birth, the ties of kindred, the intrigues of art, and  the pretensions of beauty, are in constant collision. The usual routine of  the king's life is often interrupted by urgent public affairs, and  sometimes by amusement. The reigning family has hitherto disdained those  enervating and luxurious habits which led the last"]]]
