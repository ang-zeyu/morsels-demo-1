It is during the last three months that freedom, repose,      the cessation of the obligatory routine of employment become      necessary. This is the opinion of Pinard, the chief authority on      this matter. Many, however, fearing that economic and industrial      conditions render so long a period of rest too difficult of      practical attainment, are, with Clappier and G. Newman, content      to demand two months as a minimum; Salvat only asks for one      month's rest before confinement, the woman, whether married or      not, receiving a pecuniary indemnity during this period, with      medical care and drugs free. Ballantyne (_Manual of Antenatal      Pathology: The Foetus_, p. 475), as well as Niven, also asks only      for one month's compulsory rest during pregnancy, with indemnity.      Arthur Helme, however, taking a more comprehensive view of all      the factors involved, concludes in a valuable paper on \"The      Unborn Child: Its Care and Its Rights\" (_British Medical      Journal_, Aug. 24, 1907), \"The important thing would be to      prohibit pregnant women from going to work at all, and it is as      important from the standpoint of the child that this prohibition      should include the early as the late months of pregnancy.\"        In England little progress has yet been made as regards this      question of rest during pregnancy, even as regards the education      of public opinion. Sir William Sinclair, Professor of Obstetrics      at the Victoria University of Manchester, has published (1907) _A      Plea for Establishing Municipal Maternity Homes_. Ballantyne, a      great British authority on the embryology of the child, has      published a \"Plea for a Pre-Maternity Hospital\" (_British Medical      Journal_, April 6, 1901), has since given an important lecture on      the subject (_British Medical Journal_, Jan. 11, 1908), and has      further discussed the matter in his _Manual of Ante-Natal      Pathology: The Foetus_ (Ch. XXVII); he is, however, more      interested in the establishment of hospitals for the diseases of      pregnancy than in the wider and more fundamental question of rest      for all pregnant women. In England there are, indeed, a few      institutions which receive unmarried women, with a record of good      conduct, who are pregnant for the first time, for, as      Bouchacourt remarks, ancient British prejudices are opposed to      any mercy being shown to women who are recidivists in committing      the crime of conception.        At present, indeed, it is only in France that the urgent need of      rest during the latter months of pregnancy has been clearly      realized, and any serious and official attempts made to provide      for it. In an interesting Paris thesis (_De la Puericulture avant      le Naissance_, 1907) Clappier has brought together much      information bearing on the efforts now being made to deal      practically with this question. There are many _Asiles_ in Paris      for pregnant women. One of the best is the Asile Michelet,      founded in 1893 by the Assistance Publique de Paris. This is a      sanatorium for pregnant women who have reached a period of seven      and a half months. It is nominally restricted to the admission of      French women who have been domiciled for a year in Paris, but, in      practice, it appears that women from all parts of France are      received. They are employed in light and occasional work for the      institution, being paid for this work, and are also occupied in      making clothes for the expected baby. Married and unmarried women      are admitted alike, all women being equal from the point of view      of motherhood, and indeed the majority of the women who come to      the Asile Michelet are unmarried, some being girls who have even      trudged on foot from Brittany and other remote parts of France,      to seek concealment from their friends in the hospitable      seclusion of these refuges in the great city. It is not the least      advantage of these institutions that they shield unmarried      mothers and their offspring from the manifold evils to which they      are exposed, and thus tend to decrease crime and suffering. In      addition to the maternity refuges, there are institutions in      France for assisting with help and advice those pregnant women      who prefer to remain at home, but are thus enabled to avoid the      necessity for undue domestic labor.        There ought to be no manner of doubt that when, as is the case      to-day in our own and some other supposedly civilized countries,      motherhood outside marriage is accounted as almost a crime, there      is the very greatest need for adequate provision for unmarried      women who are about to become mothers, enabling them to receive      shelter and care in secrecy, and to preserve their self-respect      and social position. This is necessary not only in the interests      of humanity and public economy, but also, as is too often      forgotten, in the interests of morality, for it is certain that      by the neglect to furnish adequate provision of this nature women      are driven to infanticide and prostitution. In earlier, more      humane days, the general provision for the secret reception and      care of illegitimate infants was undoubtedly most beneficial. The      suppression of the mediaeval method, which in France took place      gradually between 1833 and 1862, led to a great increase in      infanticide and abortion, and was a direct encouragement to crime      and immorality. In 1887 the Conseil General of the Seine sought      to replace the prevailing neglect of this matter by the adoption      of more enlightened ideas and founded a _bureau secret      d'admission_ for pregnant women. Since then both the abandonment      of infants and infanticide have greatly diminished, though they      are increasing in those parts of France which possess no      facilities of this kind. It is widely held that the State should      unify the arrangements for assuring secret maternity, and should,      in its own interests, undertake the expense. In 1904 French law      ensured the protection of unmarried mothers by guaranteeing their      secret, but it failed to organize the general establishment of      secret maternities, and has left to doctors the pioneering part      in this great and humane public work (A. Maillard-Brune,      _Refuges, Maternites, Bureaux d'Admission Secrets, comme Moyens      Preservatives des Infanticide_, These de Paris, 1908). It is not      among the least benefits of the falling birth rate that it has      helped to stimulate this beneficent movement.    The development of an industrial system which subordinates the human body  and the human soul to the thirst for gold, has, for a time, dismissed from  social consideration the interests of the race and even of the individual,  but it must be remembered that this has not been always and everywhere so.  Although in some parts of the world the women of savage peoples work up to  the time of confinement, it must be remarked that the conditions of work  in savage life do not resemble the strenuous and continuous labor of  modern factories. In many parts of the world, however, women are not  allowed to work hard during pregnancy and every consideration is shown to  them. This is so, for instance, among the Pueblo Indians, and among the  Indians of Mexico. Similar care is taken in the Carolines and the Gilbert  Islands and in many other regions all over the world. In some places,  women are secluded during pregnancy, and in others are compelled to  observe many more or less excellent rules. It is true that the assigned  cause for these rules is frequently the fear of evil spirits, but they  nevertheless often preserve a hygienic value. In many parts of the world  the discovery of pregnancy is the sign for a festival of more or less  ritual character, and much good advice is given to the expectant mother.  The modern Musselmans are careful to guard the health of their women when  pregnant, and so are the Chinese.[6] Even in Europe, in the thirteenth  century, as Clappier notes, industrial corporations sometimes had regard  to this matter, and would not allow women to work during pregnancy. In  Iceland, where much of the primitive life of Scandinavian Europe is still  preserved, great precautions are taken with pregnant women. They must lead  a quiet life, avoid tight garments, be moderate in eating and drinking,  take no alcohol, be safeguarded from all shocks, while their husbands and  all others who surround them must treat them with consideration, save them  from worry and always bear with them patiently.[7]    It is necessary to emphasize this point because we have to realize that  the modern movement for surrounding the pregnant woman with tenderness and  care, so far from being the mere outcome of civilized softness and  degeneracy, is, in all probability, the return on a higher plane to the  sane practice of those races which laid the foundations of human  greatness.    While rest is the cardinal virtue imposed on a woman during the later  months of pregnancy, there are other points in her regimen that are far  from unimportant in their bearing on the fate of the child. One of these  is the question of the mother's use of alcohol. Undoubtedly alcohol has  been a cause of much fanaticism. But the declamatory extravagance of  anti-alcoholists must not blind"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13618"],[0,"The Cathedral Church of Peterborough (#6)"],[1,"that it really does, just as if it was intended  for that purpose only, restore its proper dignity to the central arch of  the facade.\" It was most likely built as a matter of structural  necessity, to secure the stability of the front. From a settlement of  the foundations, or from a failure of the two central piers, or from the  great weight of masonry above, for there are no western buttresses, the  whole must have been in danger of falling. Mr Paley points out that the  \"construction of this elegant little edifice is extremely scientific,  especially in the manner in which the thrust is distributed through the  medium of the side turrets so as to fall upon the buttresses in front.  These turrets being erected against one side of the triangular columns,  on the right and the left hand, support them in two directions at once,  viz., from collapsing towards each other, and from falling forward. The  latter pressure is thrown wholly upon the buttresses in front, which  project seven feet beyond the base of the great pillars.\" The room above  is called by Browne Willis the Consistory Court. It is now used for the  Minster Library.    [Illustration: Map, 1610.]    The alterations and additions during the Perpendicular period can be  detected at a glance. All the Norman windows which had remained  unaltered were now filled with tracery, not of particularly good design;  the great west window and the others in the west wall were similarly  treated; the conical tops to the transeptal corner turrets were altered  into battlements; the screens in the transepts were made, and, probably,  the groined wooden ceiling in the choir. The most important addition was  the New Building at the east end of the choir. This is often erroneously  called the Lady Chapel; but when this edifice was erected the Lady  Chapel to the east of the north transept, and for more than 150 years  afterwards, was still standing. The new building was begun by Abbot  Ashton (1438-1471), and finished by Abbot Kirton (1496-1528). The rebus  of each of these abbots can be seen in its decorations: an ash growing  out of a tun or barrel, and a church or kirk with a tun.    [Illustration: The West Front in the Seventeenth Century.]    In 1540 the reign of the abbots came to an end, and in 1541 the church  became a cathedral. For a hundred years the church itself, as well as  all the buildings attached to it, appear to have remained in their full  glory. There is no reason to discredit the account given of the  preservation of this church, when so many others were dismantled or sold  at the suppression of the monasteries. It was suggested to King Henry  VIII, after the interment here of Queen Katharine of Aragon, that it  would become his greatness to erect a suitable monument of her in the  place where she was buried; and in reply the King said he would leave  her one of the goodliest monuments in Christendom, meaning that he would  spare the church for her sake. We conclude, however, from what we know  of the state of the fabric in the reign of Charles I, that although no  buildings may have been demolished, yet the church itself was falling  into disrepair. No doubt the diminished resources of the establishment,  as well as the numerous demands upon the stipends (never large) of the  members of the chapter, most of whom had duties and claims elsewhere  besides having families to support, materially reduced the amount that  could be annually devoted to the sustentation of the fabric. In the time  of the civil war much wanton destruction took place. Nearly everything  in the nature of ornamentation or embellishment was destroyed. A full  account of the mischief wrought has been preserved. Without particularly  naming such things as books, documents, vestments, and the movable  ornaments, we find the damage done to the fabric itself was terrible  indeed. The organs, \"of which there were two pair,\" were broken down.  All the stalls of the choir, the altar rails, and the great brass  chandelier, were knocked to pieces. The altar of course did not escape.  Of the reredos, or altar-piece, and its destruction, Patrick writes as  follows: \"Now behind the Communion Table, there stood a curious piece of  stone-work, admired much by strangers and travellers; a stately skreen  it was, well wrought, painted and gilt, which rose up as high almost as  the roof of the church in a row of three lofty spires, with other lesser  spires, growing out of each of them, as it is represented in the annexed  draught.[15] This had now no Imagery-work upon it, or anything else that  might justly give offence, and yet because it bore the name of the High  Altar, was pulled all down with ropes, lay'd low and level with the  ground.\" All the tombs were mutilated or hacked down. The hearse over  the tomb of Queen Katherine was demolished, as well as the arms and  escutcheons which still remained above the spot where Mary Queen of  Scots had been buried. All the other chief monuments were defaced in  like manner. One in particular is worth mentioning. It was a monument in  the new building erected to himself by Sir Humfrey Orme in his lifetime.  Two words on the inscription, \"Altar\" and \"Sacrifice,\" are said to have  excited the fury of the rabble, and it was broken down with axes,  pole-axes, and hammers. So this good old knight \"outlived his own  monument, and lived to see himself carried in effigie on a Souldiers  back, to the publick market-place, there to be sported withall, a Crew  of Souldiers going before in procession, some with surplices, some with  organ pipes, to make up the solemnity.\" This monument, as it was left  after this profanity, is still to be seen exactly as it remained when  the soldiers had done their work. The brasses in the floor, the bells in  the steeple, were regarded as lawful plunder. The same would not be said  of the stained glass, of which there was a great quantity. This was  especially the case with the windows in the cloisters, which were \"most  famed of all, for their great art and pleasing variety.\" All the glass  was broken to pieces. Much that escaped the violence of these  irresponsible zealots fell before the more regular proceedings of  commissioners. By their orders many of the buildings belonging to the  cathedral were pulled down and the materials sold. This was the case  with the cloisters, the chapter-house, the Bishop's hall and chapel. The  merchant that bought the lead from the palace roofs did not make a very  prosperous bargain, for he lost it all (as Dean Patrick says, within his  own knowledge) and the ship which carried it, on the voyage to Holland.    [Illustration: Iron Railings, 1721.]    For some time nothing was done to repair the damage. At length the Chief  Justice of the Common Pleas, Oliver St. John, obtained a grant of the  ruined Minster, which he gave to the town for use as a parish church,  their own parish church having also gone to decay. This gentleman was  doubly allied to the Cromwell family, his first wife being  great-grand-daughter of Sir Henry Cromwell, of Hinchinbrooke, and his  second wife daughter of Henry Cromwell, of Upwood. He had been sent upon  a distasteful embassy to Holland, where he experienced many indignities;  and on his return, according to Mark Noble,[16] \"he protested, that all  the favour which he received in reward for this embassy, was, that he  obtained the cathedral of Peterborough, which was propounded to be sold  and demolished, to be granted to the citizens of that place.\" The  interest that he took in Peterborough arose from the fact that he  resided at Longthorpe Hall, about two miles off.    The burden of restoring the church to a decent condition being too great  for the inhabitants, they agreed to pull down the Lady Chapel, and sell  the materials. This was done, except that some portion of the woodwork  was utilised in repairs. The painted boards from the roof were made into  backs for the seats in the choir. An engraving of the choir as it  appeared in the eighteenth century shews these boards. They are mostly  adorned with the letter M surmounted by a crown, and the three lions of  England, in alternate lozenges. Until the Restoration the church was  served by a school-master of the Charterhouse, Samuel Wilson, appointed  by the London Committee. When the cathedral body was restored, further  repairs were gradually effected, and when Dean Patrick wrote, he says  that the church was \"recovering her ancient beauty and lustre again.\"    But the same causes which operated to prevent very much being done for  years after the dissolution of monasteries, the absence of any special  fabric fund, and the inadequacy of the revenues, again produced the same  results. Browne Willis published his survey of this cathedral in 1742.  He says that considering the pillaging of the church by King Henry  VIII., and the subsequent despoiling by King Edward VI., and Queen  Elizabeth, \"we may less wonder that so large a fabrick has not had more  care taken of it as it ought; for I cannot but say, that it is ill kept  in repair, and lies very slovenly in the inside, and several of the  windows are stopped up with bricks, and the glazing in others sadly  broken; and the boards in the roof of the middle Isle or Nave, which  with the Cross Isle is not archt with stone (but wainscotted with  painted boards, as at S. Albans) are several of them damaged and broken,  as is also the pavement; insomuch that scarce any cathedral in England  is more neglected.\" He proceeds to say that the Dean and Chapter had  recently set apart L700 for repairs, and intended to apply more money to  the same purpose when certain leases were expired.    While Willis was collecting information for his book, Francis Lockier  was Dean. In his time new seats were erected in the choir which were  \"very plain and tasteless.\" They remained until 1827. A new organ was  also obtained. L1500 was spent on these alterations.    The"]]]
