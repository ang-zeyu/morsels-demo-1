And yet these slack  times are just those in which there is the greatest danger of a girl  indulging in daydreams, and when her thoughts need to be more than  usually under control. These times may be utilised for lighter  subjects and for such manual work as does not need great physical  exertion. It is not a good time for exercises, for games, for dancing,  and for gardening, nor are they the days on which mathematics should  be pressed, but they are days in which much supervision is needed, and  when time should not be permitted to hang heavily on hand.    Just as there are days in which consideration should be shown, so too  there are longer periods of time in which it is unwise for a girl to  be pressed to prepare for or to undergo a strenuous examination. The  brain of the girl appears to be as good as that of the boy, while her  application, industry, and emulation are far in advance of his, but  she has these physiological peculiarities, and if they are disregarded  there will not only be an occasional disastrous failure in bodily or  mental health, but girls as a class will fail to do the best work of  which they are capable, and will fail to reap the fullest advantage  from an education which is costly in money, time, and strength. It  follows that the curriculum for girls presents greater difficulties  than the curriculum for boys, and that those ladies who are  responsible for the organisation of a school for girls need to be  women of great resource, great patience, and endowed with much  sympathetic insight. The adolescent girl will generally do little to  help her teachers in this matter. She is incapable of recognising her  own limitations, she is full of emulation, and is desirous of  attaining and keeping a good position not only in her school but also  in the University or in any other public body for whose examination  she may present herself. The young girl most emphatically needs to be  saved from herself, and she has to learn the lessons of obedience and  of cheerful acquiescence in restrictions that certainly appear to her  simply vexatious.    One of the difficulties in private schools arises from the necessity  of providing occupation for every hour of the waking day, while  avoiding the danger of overwork with its accompanying exhaustion. In  the solution of this problem such subjects as gymnastics, games,  dancing, needlework, cooking, and domestic economy will come in as a  welcome relief from the more directly intellectual studies, and  equally as a relief to the conscientious but hard-pressed woman who is  trying to save her pupils from the evils of unoccupied time on the one  hand and undue mental pressure on the other.    Boys, and to a less extent girls, attending elementary schools who  leave at fourteen are not likely to suffer in the same way or from the  same causes. One of the difficulties in their case is that they leave  school just when work is becoming interesting and before habits of  study have been formed, indeed before the subjects taught have been  thoroughly assimilated, and that therefore in the course of a few  years little may be left of their painfully acquired and too scanty  knowledge. Free education has been given to the children of the poor  for nearly fifty years, and yet the mothers who were schoolgirls in  the seventies and eighties appear to have saved but little from the  wreck of their knowledge except the power to sign their names and to  read in an imperfect and blundering manner.    Here, too, there are many problems to be solved, one among them being  the great necessity of endeavouring to correlate the lessons given in  school to the work that the individual will have to perform in after  life. It would appear as if the girls of the elementary schools, in  addition to reading, writing, and simple arithmetic, sufficient to  enable them to write letters, to read books, and to keep simple  household accounts, ought to be taught the rudiments of cookery, the  cutting out and making of garments, and the best methods of cleansing  as applied to houses, household utensils and clothing. In addition,  and as serious subjects, not merely as a recreation, they should be  taught gymnastics, part singing and mother-craft. No doubt in  individual schools much of this modification of the curriculum has  been accomplished, but more remains to be done before we can be  satisfied that we have done the best in our power to fit the children  of the country for their life's work.    Another of the great problems connected with the children in  elementary schools, a problem which, indeed, arises out of their  leaving at fourteen, is that of the Continuation School or Evening  School, and the system which is known as \"half-timing.\" It is well  known that although young people from fourteen to sixteen years of age  are well able to profit by continued instruction, they are, with very  few exceptions, not at all well adapted for commencing their life's  work as industrials. The general incoherency and restlessness peculiar  to that age frequently lead to a change of employment every few  months, while their general irresponsibility and want of self-control  lead to frequent disputes with foremen and other officials in  factories and shops, in consequence of which the unfortunate child is  constantly out of work. In proportion to the joy and pride caused by  the realised capacity to earn money and by the sense of independence  that employment brings, is the unhappiness, and in many cases the  misery, due to unemployment, and to repeated failures to obtain and to  keep an independent position. The boy or girl out of work has an  uneasy feeling that he or she has not earned the just and expected  share towards household expenses. The feeling of dependence and  well-nigh of disgrace causes a rapid deterioration in health and  spirits, and it is only too likely that in many instances where  unemployment is continuous or frequently repeated, the unemployed  will quickly become the unemployable.    So far as the young people themselves are concerned, it would be  nearly always an unmixed benefit that they should pass at fourteen  into a Technical School or Continuation School, as the case may be.  Among the great difficulties to the solution of this problem is the  fact that in many working-class households the few weekly shillings  brought into the family store by the elder children are of very real  importance, and although the raising of the age of possible employment  and independence would enable the next generation to work better and  to earn higher and more continuous wages, it is difficult for the  parents to acquiesce in the present deprivation involved, even though  it represents so much clear gain in the not distant future.    At the present time there are Evening Schools, but this system does  not work well. All busy people are well aware that after a hard day's  work neither brain nor body is in the best possible condition for two  or three hours of serious mental effort. The child who has spent the  day in factory or shop has really pretty nearly used up all his or her  available mental energy, and after the evening meal is naturally  heavy, stupid, irritable, and altogether in a bad condition for  further effort. The evenings ought to be reserved for recreation, for  the gymnasium, the singing class, the swimming bath, and even for the  concert and the theatre.    The system of \"half-timing\" during ordinary school life does not work  well, and it would be a great pity should a similar system be  introduced in the hope of furthering the education of boys and girls  who are just entering industrial life. There is reason to hope that a  great improvement in education will be secured by Mr. Hayes Fisher's  bill.    Another subject to which the attention of patriots and philanthropists  ought to be turned is the sort of employment open to children at  school-leaving age. The greatest care should be taken to diminish the  number of those who endeavour to achieve quasi-independence in those  occupations which are well known as \"blind alleys.\" In England it is  rare that girls should seek these employments, but in Scotland there  is far too large a number of girl messengers. In this particular, the  case of the girl is superior to that of the boy. The \"tweeny\" develops  into housemaid or cook; the young girls employed in superior shops to  wait on the elder shopwomen hope to develop into their successors, and  the girls who nurse babies on the doorsteps are, after all, acquiring  knowledge and dexterity that may fit them for domestic service or for  the management of their own families a few years later.    The girls of the richer classes have not the same difficulties as  their poorer sisters. They generally remain at school until a much  later age, and subsequently have the joy and stimulus of college life,  of foreign travel, of social engagements, or of philanthropic  enterprise. Still, a residue remains even of girls of this class whose  own inclinations, or whose family circumstances, lead to an aimless,  purposeless existence, productive of much injury to both body and  mind, and only too likely to end in hopeless ennui and nervous  troubles. It should be thoroughly understood by parents and guardians  that no matter what the girl's circumstances may be, she ought always  to have an abundance of employment. The ideas of obligation and of  duty should not be discarded when school and college life cease. The  well-to-do girl should be encouraged to take up some definite  employment which would fill her life and provide her with interests  and duties. Any other arrangement tends to make the time between  leaving school or college and a possible marriage not only a wasted  time but also a seed-time during which a crop is sown of bad habits,  laziness of body, and slackness of mind, that subsequently bear bitter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1377"],[0,"The Talisman (#6)"],[1," by a carpet of  velvet verdure.    In this delightful spot the two warriors halted, and each, after his own  fashion, proceeded to relieve his horse from saddle, bit, and rein,  and permitted the animals to drink at the basin, ere they refreshed  themselves from the fountain head, which arose under the vault. They  then suffered the steeds to go loose, confident that their interest, as  well as their domesticated habits, would prevent their straying from the  pure water and fresh grass.    Christian and Saracen next sat down together on the turf, and produced  each the small allowance of store which they carried for their own  refreshment. Yet, ere they severally proceeded to their scanty meal,  they eyed each other with that curiosity which the close and doubtful  conflict in which they had been so lately engaged was calculated to  inspire. Each was desirous to measure the strength, and form some  estimate of the character, of an adversary so formidable; and each was  compelled to acknowledge that, had he fallen in the conflict, it had  been by a noble hand.    The champions formed a striking contrast to each other in person and  features, and might have formed no inaccurate representatives of their  different nations. The Frank seemed a powerful man, built after the  ancient Gothic cast of form, with light brown hair, which, on the  removal of his helmet, was seen to curl thick and profusely over his  head. His features had acquired, from the hot climate, a hue much darker  than those parts of his neck which were less frequently exposed to view,  or than was warranted by his full and well-opened blue eye, the colour  of his hair, and of the moustaches which thickly shaded his upper  lip, while his chin was carefully divested of beard, after the Norman  fashion. His nose was Grecian and well formed; his mouth rather large  in proportion, but filled with well-set, strong, and beautifully white  teeth; his head small, and set upon the neck with much grace. His age  could not exceed thirty, but if the effects of toil and climate were  allowed for, might be three or four years under that period. His form  was tall, powerful, and athletic, like that of a man whose strength  might, in later life, become unwieldy, but which was hitherto united  with lightness and activity. His hands, when he withdrew the mailed  gloves, were long, fair, and well-proportioned; the wrist-bones  peculiarly large and strong; and the arms remarkably well-shaped and  brawny. A military hardihood and careless frankness of expression  characterized his language and his motions; and his voice had the tone  of one more accustomed to command than to obey, and who was in the habit  of expressing his sentiments aloud and boldly, whenever he was called  upon to announce them.    The Saracen Emir formed a marked and striking contrast with the Western  Crusader. His stature was indeed above the middle size, but he was at  least three inches shorter than the European, whose size approached the  gigantic. His slender limbs and long, spare hands and arms, though well  proportioned to his person, and suited to the style of his countenance,  did not at first aspect promise the display of vigour and elasticity  which the Emir had lately exhibited. But on looking more closely, his  limbs, where exposed to view, seemed divested of all that was fleshy or  cumbersome; so that nothing being left but bone, brawn, and sinew, it  was a frame fitted for exertion and fatigue, far beyond that of a bulky  champion, whose strength and size are counterbalanced by weight, and  who is exhausted by his own exertions. The countenance of the Saracen  naturally bore a general national resemblance to the Eastern tribe from  whom he descended, and was as unlike as possible to the exaggerated  terms in which the minstrels of the day were wont to represent the  infidel champions, and the fabulous description which a sister art still  presents as the Saracen's Head upon signposts. His features were small,  well-formed, and delicate, though deeply embrowned by the Eastern sun,  and terminated by a flowing and curled black beard, which seemed trimmed  with peculiar care. The nose was straight and regular, the eyes keen,  deep-set, black, and glowing, and his teeth equalled in beauty the ivory  of his deserts. The person and proportions of the Saracen, in short,  stretched on the turf near to his powerful antagonist, might have been  compared to his sheeny and crescent-formed sabre, with its narrow and  light but bright and keen Damascus blade, contrasted with the long and  ponderous Gothic war-sword which was flung unbuckled on the same sod.  The Emir was in the very flower of his age, and might perhaps have been  termed eminently beautiful, but for the narrowness of his forehead and  something of too much thinness and sharpness of feature, or at least  what might have seemed such in a European estimate of beauty.    The manners of the Eastern warrior were grave, graceful, and decorous;  indicating, however, in some particulars, the habitual restraint which  men of warm and choleric tempers often set as a guard upon their native  impetuosity of disposition, and at the same time a sense of his own  dignity, which seemed to impose a certain formality of behaviour in him  who entertained it.    This haughty feeling of superiority was perhaps equally entertained by  his new European acquaintance, but the effect was different; and the  same feeling, which dictated to the Christian knight a bold, blunt, and  somewhat careless bearing, as one too conscious of his own importance  to be anxious about the opinions of others, appeared to prescribe to the  Saracen a style of courtesy more studiously and formally observant of  ceremony. Both were courteous; but the courtesy of the Christian seemed  to flow rather from a good humoured sense of what was due to others;  that of the Moslem, from a high feeling of what was to be expected from  himself.    The provision which each had made for his refreshment was simple, but  the meal of the Saracen was abstemious. A handful of dates and a morsel  of coarse barley-bread sufficed to relieve the hunger of the latter,  whose education had habituated them to the fare of the desert, although,  since their Syrian conquests, the Arabian simplicity of life frequently  gave place to the most unbounded profusion of luxury. A few draughts  from the lovely fountain by which they reposed completed his meal. That  of the Christian, though coarse, was more genial. Dried hog's flesh, the  abomination of the Moslemah, was the chief part of his repast; and his  drink, derived from a leathern bottle, contained something better than  pure element. He fed with more display of appetite, and drank with more  appearance of satisfaction, than the Saracen judged it becoming to show  in the performance of a mere bodily function; and, doubtless, the secret  contempt which each entertained for the other, as the follower of a  false religion, was considerably increased by the marked difference of  their diet and manners. But each had found the weight of his opponent's  arm, and the mutual respect which the bold struggle had created was  sufficient to subdue other and inferior considerations. Yet the Saracen  could not help remarking the circumstances which displeased him in the  Christian's conduct and manners; and, after he had witnessed for some  time in silence the keen appetite which protracted the knight's banquet  long after his own was concluded, he thus addressed him:--    \"Valiant Nazarene, is it fitting that one who can fight like a man  should feed like a dog or a wolf? Even a misbelieving Jew would shudder  at the food which you seem to eat with as much relish as if it were  fruit from the trees of Paradise.\"    \"Valiant Saracen,\" answered the Christian, looking up with some surprise  at the accusation thus unexpectedly brought, \"know thou that I exercise  my Christian freedom in using that which is forbidden to the Jews,  being, as they esteem themselves, under the bondage of the old law of  Moses. We, Saracen, be it known to thee, have a better warrant for  what we do--Ave Maria!--be we thankful.\" And, as if in defiance of  his companion's scruples, he concluded a short Latin grace with a long  draught from the leathern bottle.    \"That, too, you call a part of your liberty,\" said the Saracen; \"and  as you feed like the brutes, so you degrade yourself to the bestial  condition by drinking a poisonous liquor which even they refuse!\"    \"Know, foolish Saracen,\" replied the Christian, without hesitation,  \"that thou blasphemest the gifts of God, even with the blasphemy of thy  father Ishmael. The juice of the grape is given to him that will use it  wisely, as that which cheers the heart of man after toil, refreshes him  in sickness, and comforts him in sorrow. He who so enjoyeth it may thank  God for his winecup as for his daily bread; and he who abuseth the gift  of Heaven is not a greater fool in his intoxication than thou in thine  abstinence.\"    The keen eye of the Saracen kindled at this sarcasm, and his hand sought  the hilt of his poniard. It was but a momentary thought, however, and  died away in the recollection of the powerful champion with whom he  had to deal, and the desperate grapple, the impression of which still  throbbed in his limbs and veins; and he contented himself with pursuing  the contest in colloquy, as more convenient for the time.    \"Thy words\" he said, \"O Nazarene, might create anger, did not thy  ignorance raise compassion. Seest thou not, O thou more blind than any  who asks alms at the door of the Mosque, that the liberty thou dost  boast of is restrained even in that which is dearest to man's happiness  and to his household; and that thy law, if thou dost practise it, binds  thee in marriage to one single mate, be she sick or healthy, be she  fruitful or barren, bring she comfort and joy, or clamour and strife,  to thy table and to "]]]
