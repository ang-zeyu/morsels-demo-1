For children, it should be allowed to cool a little.    A stocking bound on warm from the foot, at night, is good for the sore  throat.    An ointment made from the common ground-worms, which boys dig to bait  fishes, rubbed on with the hand, is said to be excellent, when the  sinews are drawn up by any disease or accident.    A gentleman in Missouri advertises that he had an inveterate cancer  upon his nose cured by a strong potash made of the lye of the ashes of  red oak bark, boiled down to the consistence of molasses. The cancer  was covered with this, and, about an hour after, covered with a  plaster of tar. This must be removed in a few days, and, if any  protuberances remain in the wound, apply more potash to them, and the  plaster again, until they entirely disappear: after which heal the  wound with any common soothing salve. I never knew this to be tried.    If a wound bleeds very fast, and there is no physician at hand, cover  it with the scrapings of sole-leather, scraped like coarse lint. This  stops blood very soon. Always have vinegar, camphor, hartshorn, or  something of that kind, in readiness, as the sudden stoppage of blood  almost always makes a person faint.    Balm-of-Gilead buds bottled up in N.E. rum, make the best cure in the  world for fresh cuts and wounds. Every family should have a bottle of  it. The buds should be gathered in a peculiar state; just when they  are well swelled, ready to burst into leaves, and well covered with  gum. They last but two or three days in this state.    Plantain and house-leek, boiled in cream, and strained before it is  put away to cool, makes a very cooling, soothing ointment. Plantain  leaves laid upon a wound are cooling and healing.    Half a spoonful of _citric acid_, (which may always be bought of the  apothecaries,) stirred in half a tumbler of water, is excellent for  the head-ache.    People in general think they must go abroad for vapor-baths; but a  very simple one can be made at home. Place _strong_ sticks across  a tub of water, at the boiling point, and sit upon them, entirely  enveloped in a blanket, feet and all. The steam from the water will  be a vapor-bath. Some people put herbs into the water. Steam-baths are  excellent for severe colds, and for some disorders in the bowels. They  should not be taken without the advice of an experienced nurse, or  physician. Great care should be taken not to renew the cold after; it  would be doubly dangerous.    Boiled potatoes are said to cleanse the hands as well as common soap;  they prevent _chops_ in the winter season, and keep the skin soft and  healthy.    Water-gruel, with three or four onions simmered in it, prepared with  a lump of butter, pepper, and salt, eaten just before one goes to  bed, is said to be a cure for a hoarse cold. A syrup made of  horseradish-root and sugar is excellent for a cold.    Very strong salt and water, when frequently applied, has been known to  cure wens.    The following poultice for the throat distemper, has been much  approved in England:--The pulp of a roasted apple, mixed with an ounce  of tobacco, the whole wet with spirits of wine, or any other high  spirits, spread on a linen rag, and bound upon the throat at any  period of the disorder.    Nothing is so good to take down swellings, as a soft poultice of  stewed white beans, put on in a thin muslin bag, and renewed every  hour or two.    The thin white skin, which comes from suet, is excellent to bind upon  the feet for chilblains. Rubbing with Castile soap, and afterwards  with honey, is likewise highly recommended. But, to cure the  chilblains effectually, they must be attended to often, and for a long  time.    Always apply diluted laudanum to fresh wounds.    A poultice of elder-blow tea and biscuit is good as a preventive to  mortification. The approach of mortification is generally shown by  the formation of blisters filled with _blood_; water blisters are not  alarming.    Burnt alum held in the mouth is good for the canker.    The common dark-blue violet makes a slimy tea, which is excellent for  the canker. Leaves and blossoms are both good. Those who have families  should take some pains to dry these flowers.    When people have a sore mouth, from taking calomel, or any other  cause, tea made of low-blackberry leaves is extremely beneficial.    Tea made of slippery elm is good for the piles, and for humors in the  blood; to be drank plentifully. Winter evergreen[4] is considered good  for all humors, particularly scrofula. Some call it rheumatism-weed;  because a tea made from it is supposed to check that painful disorder.    [Footnote 4: This plant resembles the poisonous kill-lamb, both in the  shape and the glossiness of the leaves: great care should be used to  distinguish them.]    An ointment of lard, sulphur, and cream-of-tartar, simmered together,  is good for the piles.    Elixir proprietatis is a useful family medicine for all cases when the  digestive powers are out of order. One ounce of saffron, one ounce of  myrrh, and one ounce of aloes. Pulverize them; let the myrrh steep  in half a pint of brandy, or N.E. rum, for four days; then add the  saffron and aloes; let it stand in the sunshine, or in some warm  place, for a fortnight; taking care to shake it well twice a day. At  the end of the fortnight, fill up the bottle (a common sized one) with  brandy, or N.E. rum, and let it stand a month. It costs six times as  much to buy it in small quantities, as it does to make it.    The constant use of malt beer, or malt in any way, is said to be a  preservative against fevers.    Black cherry-tree bark, barberry bark, mustard-seed, petty  morrel-root, and horseradish, well steeped in cider, are excellent for  the jaundice.    Cotton wool and oil are the best things for a burn. When children are  burned, it is difficult to make them endure the application of cotton  wool. I have known the inflammation of a very bad burn extracted in  one night, by the constant application of brandy, vinegar, and water,  mixed together. This feels cool and pleasant, and a few drops of  paregoric will soon put the little sufferer to sleep. The bathing  should be continued till the pain is gone.    A few drops of the oil of Cajput on cotton wool is said to be a great  relief to the tooth-ache. It occasions a smart pain for a few seconds,  when laid upon the defective tooth. Any apothecary will furnish it  ready dropped on cotton wool, for a few cents.    A poultice made of ginger or of common chickweed, that grows about  one's door in the country, has given great relief to the tooth-ache,  when applied frequently to the cheek.    A spoonful of ashes stirred in cider is good to prevent sickness  at the stomach. Physicians frequently order it in cases of  cholera-morbus.    When a blister occasioned by a burn breaks, it is said to be a good  plan to put wheat flour upon the naked flesh.    The buds of the elder bush, gathered in early spring, and simmered  with new butter, or sweet lard, make a very healing and cooling  ointment.    Night sweats have been cured, when more powerful remedies had failed,  by fasting morning and night, and drinking cold sage tea constantly  and freely.    Lard, melted and cooled five or six times in succession, by being  poured each time into a fresh pail-full of water, then simmered with  sliced onions, and cooled, is said, by old nurses, to make a salve,  which is almost infallible in curing inflammations produced by taking  cold in wounds.    Vinegar curds, made by pouring vinegar into warm milk, put on warm,  and changed pretty frequently, are likewise excellent to subdue  inflammation.    Chalk wet with hartshorn is a remedy for the sting of bees; so is  likewise table-salt kept moist with water.    Boil castor-oil with an equal quantity of milk, sweeten it with a  little sugar, stir it well, and, when cold, give it to children for  drink. They will never suspect it is medicine; and will even love the  taste of it.    As molasses is often given to children as a gentle physic, it will be  useful to know that West India molasses is a gentle cathartic, while  sugar-baker's molasses is slightly astringent.    If a fellon or run-round appears to be coming on the finger, you can  do nothing better than to soak the finger thoroughly in hot lye. It  will be painful, but it will cure a disorder much more painful.    Whiskey, which has had Spanish-flies in soak, is said to be good for  ring-worms; but I never knew an instance of its being tried. Unless  too strong, or used in great quantities, it cannot, at least, do  any harm. Washing the hands frequently in warm vinegar, is good for  ring-worms.    When the toe nails have a tendency to turn in, so as to be painful,  the nail should always be kept scraped _very thin_, and as near the  flesh as possible. As soon as the corner of the nail can be raised up  out of the flesh, it should be kept from again entering, by putting a  tuft of fine lint under it.    As this book may fall into the hands of those who cannot speedily  obtain a physician, it is worth while to mention what is best to be  done for the bite of a rattlesnake:--Cut the flesh out, around the  bite, _instantly_; that the poison may not have time to circulate  in the blood. If caustic is at hand, put it upon the raw flesh; if  not, the next best thing is to fill the wound with salt--renewing it  occasionally. Take a dose of sweet oil and spirits of turpentine,  to defend the stomach. If the whole limb swell, bathe it in salt and  vinegar freely. It is well to physic the system thoroughly, before  returning to usual diet.      GRUEL.    Gruel is very easily made. Have a pint of water boiling in a skillet;  stir up three or four large spoonfuls of nicely sifted oat-meal, rye,  or Indian, in cold water. Pour it into the skillet while the water  boils. Let it boil eight or ten minutes.

He lay for hours  with the sun beating on his face to correct his colour to standard,  and the only semblance of personal vanity that he ever had was  pleasure in hearing disparaging remarks about the darkness of his  complexion. He tried to do everything as an Indian would do it,  striking Indian poses, walking carefully with his toes turned in,  breaking off twigs to mark a place, guessing at the time by the sun,  and grunting \"Ugh\" or \"Wagh\" when anything surprised him. Disparaging  remarks about White-men, delivered in supposed Indian dialect, were  an important part of his pastime. \"Ugh, White-men heap no good\" and  \"Wagh, paleface--pale fool in woods,\" were among his favourites.    He was much influenced by phrases that caught his ear. \"The brown  sinewy arm of the Indian,\" was one of them. It discovered to him that  his own arms were white as milk. There was, however, a simple remedy.  He rolled up his sleeves to the shoulder and exposed them to the full  glare of the sun. Then later, under the spell of the familiar phrase,  \"The warrior was naked to the waist,\" he went a step further--he  determined to be brown to the waist--so discarded his shirt during the  whole of one holiday. He always went to extremes. He remembered now  that certain Indians put their young warriors through an initiation  called the Sun-dance, so he danced naked round the fire in the blazing  sun and sat around naked all one day.    He noticed a general warmness before evening, but it was at night that  he really felt the punishment of his indiscretion. He was in a burning  heat. He scarcely slept all night. Next day he was worse, and his arm  and shoulder were blistered. He bore it bravely, fearing only that the  Home Government might find it out, in which case he would have fared  worse. He had read that the Indians grease the skin for sunburn, so he  went to the bathroom and there used goose grease for lack of Buffalo  fat. This did give some relief, and in a few days he was better and  had the satisfaction of peeling the dead skin from his shoulders and  arms.    Yan made a number of vessels out of Birch bark, stitching the edges  with root fibers, filling the bottom with a round wooden disc, and  cementing the joints with pine gum so that they would hold water.    In the distant river he caught some Catfish and brought them  home--that, is, to his shanty. There he made a fire and broiled  them--very badly--but he ate them as a great delicacy. The sharp bone  in each of their side fins he saved, bored a hole through its thick  end, smoothed it, and so had needles to stitch his Birch bark. He kept  them in a bark box with some lumps of resin, along with some bark  fiber, an Indian flint arrow-head given him by a schoolmate, and  the claws of a large Owl, found in the garbage heap back of the  taxidermist's shop.    One day on the ash heap in their own yard in town he saw a new,  strange bird. He was always seeing new birds, but this was of unusual  interest. He drew its picture as it tamely fed near him. A dull, ashy  gray, with bronzy yellow spots on crown and rump, and white bars on  its wings. His \"Birds of Canada\" gave no light; he searched through  all the books he could find, but found no clew to its name. It was  years afterward before he learned that this was the young male Pine  Grosbeak.    Another day, under the bushes not far from his shanty, he found a  small Hawk lying dead. He clutched it as a wonderful prize, spent an  hour in looking at its toes, its beak, its wings, its every feather;  then he set to work to make a drawing of it. A very bad drawing it  proved, although it was the labour of days, and the bird was crawling  with maggots before he had finished. But every feather and every spot  was faithfully copied, was duly set down on paper. One of his  friends said it was a Chicken-hawk. That name stuck in Yan's memory.  Thenceforth the Chicken-hawk and its every marking were familiar to  him. Even in after years, when he had learned that this must have been  a young \"Sharp-shin,\" the name \"Chicken-hawk\" was always readier on  his lips.    But he met with another and a different Hawk soon afterward. This one  was alive and flitting about in the branches of a tree over his head.  It was very small--less than a foot in length. Its beak was very  short, its legs, wings and tail long; its head was bluish and its back  coppery red; on the tail was a broad, black crossbar. As the bird flew  about and balanced on the boughs, it pumped its tail. This told him  it was a Hawk, and the colours he remembered were those of the male  Sparrow-hawk, for here his bird book helped with its rude travesty of  \"Wilson's\" drawing of this bird. Yet two other birds he saw close at  hand and drew partly from memory. The drawings were like this, and  from the picture on a calendar he learned that one was a Rail; from  a drawing in the bird book that the other was a Bobolink. And these  names he never forgot. He had his doubts about the sketching at  first--it seemed an un-Indian thing to do, until he remembered that  the Indians painted pictures on their shields and on their teepees. It  was really the best of all ways for him to make reliable observation.    The bookseller of the town had some new books in his window about this  time. One, a marvellous work called \"Poisonous Plants,\" Yan was eager  to see. It was exposed in the window for a time. Two of the large  plates were visible from the street; one was Henbane, the other  Stramonium. Yan gazed at them as often as he could. In a week they  were gone; but the names and looks were forever engraved on his  memory. Had he made bold to go in and ask permission to see the work,  his memory would have seized most of it in an hour.          IX    Tracks      In the wet sand down by the edge of the brook he one day found some  curious markings--evidently tracks. Yan pored over them, then made a  life-size drawing of one. He shrewdly suspected it to be the track of  a Coon--nothing was too good or wild or rare for his valley. As soon  as he could, he showed the track to the stableman whose dog was said  to have killed a Coon once, and hence the man must be an authority on  the subject.    \"Is that a Coon track?\" asked Yan timidly.    \"How do I know?\" said the man roughly, and went on with his work. But  a stranger standing near, a curious person with shabby clothes, and  a new silk hat on the back of his head, said, \"Let me see it.\" Yan  showed it.    \"Is it natural size?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Yep, that's a Coon track, all right. You look at all the big trees  near about whar you saw that; then when you find one with a hole in  it, you look on the bark and you will find some Coon hars. Then you  will know you've got a Coon tree.\"    [Illustration: The Coon track]    Yan took the earliest chance. He sought and found a great Basswood  with some gray hairs caught in the bark. He took them home with him,  not sure what kind they were. He sought the stranger, but he was gone,  and no one knew him.    How to identify the hairs was a question; but he remembered a friend  who had a Coon-skin carriage robe. A few hairs of these were compared  with those from the tree and left no doubt that the climber was a  Coon. Thus Yan got the beginning of the idea that the very hairs of  each, as well as its tracks, are different. He learned, also, how wise  it is to draw everything that he wished to observe or describe. It  was accident, or instinct on his part, but he had fallen on a sound  principle; there is nothing like a sketch to collect and convey  accurate information of form--there is no better developer of true  observation.    One day he noticed a common plant like an umbrella. He dug it up by  the root, and at the lower end he found a long white bulb. He tasted  this. It was much like a cucumber. He looked up \"Gray's School  Botany,\" and in the index saw the name, Indian Cucumber. The  description seemed to tally, as far as he could follow its technical  terms, though like all such, without a drawing it was far from  satisfactory. So he added the Indian Cucumber to his woodlore.    On another occasion he chewed the leaves of a strange plant because he  had heard that that was the first test applied by the Indians. He soon  began to have awful pains in his stomach. He hurried home in agony.  His mother gave him mustard and water till he vomited, then she boxed  his ears. His father came in during the process and ably supplemented  the punishment. He was then and there ordered to abstain forever from  the woods. Of course, he did not. He merely became more cautious about  it all, and enjoyed his shanty with the added zest of secret sin.          X    Biddy's Contribution      An Irish-Canadian servant girl from Sanger now became a member of  their household. Her grandmother was an herb-doctor in great repute.  She had frequently been denounced as a witch, although in good  standing as a Catholic. This girl had picked up some herb-lore, and  one day when all the family were visiting the cemetery she darted into  various copses and produced plants which she named, together with the  complaint that her grandmother used them for.    \"Sassafras, that makes tea for skin disease; Ginseng, that's good to  sell; Bloodroot for the blood in springtime; Goldthread, that cures  sore mouths; Pipsissewa for chills and fever; White-man's Foot, that  springs up wherever a White-man treads; Indian cup, that grows where  an Indian dies; Dandelion roots for coffee; Catnip tea for a cold;  Lavender tea for drinking at meals; Injun Tobacco to mix with boughten  tobacco; Hemlock bark to dye pink; Goldthread to dye yellow, and  Butternut rinds for greenish.\"    All of these were passing trifles to the others, but to Yan they were  the very breath of life, and he treasured up all of these things  in his memory.
