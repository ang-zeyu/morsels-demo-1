GUTZLAFF, the famous missionary, is now in Germany, and he had  recently an interview with the Presidents of the Corporation of  Merchants of Stettin, to give them some information as to the sort of  goods best adapted for exportation to China. He held out very little  encouragement of a profitable trade with that country at present, as  he said he could not name a single article of German manufacture he  thought likely to secure any great demand. He commended the English  government for establishing a \"Chinese Exhibition,\" in order to  instruct the merchants of the real nature and quality of Chinese  productions. (He must have meant the exhibition of the late Mr. Dunn,  of Philadelphia, so long open in London, and erroneously supposed  that it was a government institution.) He also described the Chinese  language itself, on account of its extreme difficulty, as the chief  obstacle in the way of the civilization of the people. He did not  believe the most learned Chinese perfectly knew his alphabet, as  after twenty years' study he could not say he was master of it, a  fact highly discouraging to the German _savans_.           *       *       *       *       *    A new Historical Society was formed at Hartford, Conn., a few weeks  ago, under the title of the Historical Society of the Protestant  Episcopal Church of the United States.

WHITTIER.    With something of the grateful feeling which prompted the memorable  exclamation of Sancho Panza, \"Blessings on the man who first invented  sleep!\" we have laid down these pleasant volumes. Blessings on the man  who invented books of travel for the benefit of home idlers! the Marco  Polos, the Sir John Mandevilles, and the Ibn Batutas of old time, and  their modern disciples and imitators! Nothing in the shape of travel  and gossip, by the way, comes amiss to us, from Cook's voyages round  the earth to Count De Maistre's journey round his chamber. When the  cark and care of daily life and homely duties, and the weary routine  of sight and sound, oppress us, what a comfort and refreshing is it to  open the charmed pages of the traveler! Our narrow, monotonous horizon  breaks away all about us; five minutes suffice to take us quite out of  the commonplace and familiar regions of our experience: we are in the  Court of the Great Khan, we are pitching tents under the shadows of  the ruined temples of Tadmor, we are sitting on a fallen block of the  Pyramids, or a fragment of the broken nose of the Sphynx, dickering  with Arab Shieks, opposing Yankee shrewdness to Ishmaelitish greed  and cunning: we are shooting crocodiles on the white Nile, unearthing  the winged lions of Ezekiel's vision on the Tigris--watching the  night-dance of the Devil-worshipers on their mountains, negotiating  with the shrewd penny-turning patriarch of Armenia for a sample from  his holy-oil manufactory at Erivan, drinking coffee at Damascus, and  sherbet at Constantinople, lunching in the vale of Chaumorng, taking  part in a holy _fete_ at Rome, and a merry Christmas at Berlin. We  look into the happiness of traveling through the eyes of others, and,  for the miseries of it, we enjoy _them_ exceedingly. Very cool and  comfortable are we while reading the poor author's account of his  mishaps, hair-breadth escapes, hunger, cold, and nakedness. We take  a deal of satisfaction in his moscheto persecutions and night-long  battles with sanguinary fleas. The discomforts and grievances of his  palate under the ordeal of foreign cooking were a real relish for us.  On a hot morning in the tropics, we see him pulling on his stocking  with a scorpion in it, and dancing in involuntary joy under the  effects of the sting. Let him dance; it is all for our amusement. Let  him meet with what he will--robbers, cannibals, jungle-tigers, and  rattlesnakes, the more the better--since we know that he will get  off alive, and come to regard them so many god-sends in the way of  book-making.    The volumes now before us are not only seasonable as respects the  world-wide curiosity in regard to California--the new-risen empire on  the Pacific--abounding, as they do, in valuable facts and statistics,  but they have in a high degree that charm of personal adventure and  experience to which we have referred. Bayard Taylor is a born tourist.  He has eyes to see, skill to make the most of whatever opens before  him under the ever-shifting horizon of the traveler. He takes us along  with him, and lets us into the secret of his own hearty enjoyment.  Much of what he describes has already become familiar to us from the  notes of a thousand gold-seekers, who have sent home such records as  they could of their experiences in a strange land. Yet even the well  known particulars of the overland route across the Isthmus become  novel and full of interest in the narrative of our young tourist.  The tropical scenery by day and night on the river, the fandango at  Gorgona, and the ride to Panama through the dense dark forest, with  death, in the shape of a cholera-stricken emigrant, following at their  heels, are in the raciest spirit of story-telling. The steamer from  Panama touched at the ancient city of Acapulco, and took in a company  of gamblers, who immediately set up their business on deck. At San  Deigo, the first overland emigrants by the route of the Gila river,  who had reached that place a few days before, came on board,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12984"],[0,"Eugene Field, a Study in Heredity and Contradictions â€” Volume 1 (#6)"],[1," very embarrassing interview followed between Roswell and the family  of his recalcitrant bride. On entering the room he advanced to Mary,  and, extending his hand, \"asked her how she did.\" But she looked at her  mother and rejected his hand. A similar advance to Mrs. Susanna met  with a like rebuff. Being considerately left alone in the room with  Mary Almira by her mother and brother, who, with a sister, stood at the  door listening, Roswell had what he was not disposed to regard as a  private audience with his legal wife. In answer to his natural inquiry  as to what it all meant, Mary said that since she had come home and  thought it all over she found that she _did_ love Jeremiah; that  Jeremiah had been very kind to her, and she thought she ought to marry  Jeremiah.    Roswell inquired how she could do that, as she was already married.    \"Why,\" said the fickle Mary, \"you can give up the certificate; let it  all go and nobody will know anything about it.\" After some natural  remonstrances, Mary continued: \"Come, now, you've got the certificate  in your pocket, and you can give it up just as well as not and let me  marry Jeremiah,\" at the same time holding out her hand as if for the  document.    The startling effrontery of the proposal provoked Roswell, and he told  her that so far as a separation from himself was concerned she should  be gratified to her heart's content, and that while she remained as she  was he would not divulge the marriage, but he warned her that if she  should attempt marriage with another he would publish the marriage at  Putney in every parish church and newspaper in New England.    At this point the private interview was interrupted by the hasty  entrance of Mistress Susanna, who advanced in great agitation, as the  pleadings inform us, and said to Roswell:    \"Mister Field, why can't you give up that stiffiket\" (meaning, as he  supposed, certificate) \"and let things be as if they had never been?\"    Thereupon \"Mister Field\" proceeded to point out to the entire family of  Mary Almira, which had assembled from the doors and keyholes where they  had been eavesdropping, \"the wickedness and folly of Mistress Susanna's  request.\" One of Mary's brothers admitted that Roswell's refusal \"to  connive to the dishonor of his wife\" was correct and honorable, and  that he should not be asked to make any such arrangement.    Roswell was greatly shocked and disgusted at the appearance, language,  and manner of Mary Almira, and he was borne out in his impression of  her character by the admission of one brother that she was \"a giddy,  inconsistent, unprincipled girl,\" and by that of another that \"she was  a volatile coquette, who did not know her own mind from day to day.\"    Roswell remained in Windsor three days, but did not again see Mary  Almira; whereupon, feeling that nothing was to be gained by exposing  \"himself to renewed insults, he returned home for a few days.\"    It appears that all this time Jeremiah was lurking in the vicinity,  holding secret interviews with Mary and her family, and \"devising ways  and means\" for the bigamous marriage which, according to the belief of  Roswell, was performed between Jeremiah and Mary Almira somewhere in  New Hampshire between the 14th and 27th of November. Roswell M. Field  never recognized the legality of any such ceremony or that Mary and  Jeremiah had the lawful right to intermarry while the marriage at  Putney remained in full force and effect. He had reason to be thankful  for his escape from a union for life with a woman of such frivolous  nature and easy indifference to the most sacred obligations of human  and divine law. But he would not permit himself to become a silent  copartner in what, to his strict notion of the inviolability of the  marriage contract, was one of the most heinous crimes against society  and morals. He, therefore, took every means in his power to bring  obloquy and punishment upon the guilty parties. He instituted various  proceedings at law to test the validity of the marriage at Putney. He,  among other measures, filed a petition in the Probate Court to secure  an accounting from Mistress Susanna as guardian of the estate of his  wife Mary Almira. But Susanna avoided the issue by a technical plea.    He brought an action of ejectment in the name of himself and Mary  Almira to recover possession of a tenement in Windsor of which she was  the owner, and secured judgment without any defence being offered.    He secured the indictment of one of her brothers in the United States  District Court for having opened one of his letters to his wife.    He presented a statement of the facts of the abduction and bigamous  marriage of Mary Almira to the Grand Jury of Windsor County, and  procured an indictment against her two brothers and Mary Almira and  Jeremiah \"for conspiracy to carry her without the state of Vermont\" to  become the bigamous wife of Jeremiah.    He followed Jeremiah and Mary to Boston in July, 1833, and laid the  matter before the Grand Jury there, but before any action could be  taken Jeremiah and Mary Almira \"withdrew from the city of Boston, left  New England, took passage at the city of New York in an outward bound  vessel, and retired to the other side of the Atlantic.\"    Out of one of the actions instituted in the name of Roswell Field and  Mary Almira, his wife, grew a libel suit, brought by Mistress Susanna  against him, in which the special pleas drawn and filed by Roswell  Field were pronounced by Justice Story \"to be masterpieces of special  pleading.\" Through all these proceedings Mr. Field disclaimed all  intention or wish \"to visit legal pains and penalties\" upon his wife,  whom he regarded \"as the victim and scapegoat of a wicked conspiracy.\"    Finally, and after the birth of a child, Jeremiah and Mary Almira were  forced to bring a suit for the nullification of the Putney marriage.  Field met the complaint with a plea that set out all the facts. He  contended that, as the Putney marriage was between persons of legal  discretion and consent, there could be no condition that would render  it voidable at the election of either. Every law and precedent was in  favor of the inviolability of the Putney marriage, and yet so powerful  were the family influences and so distressing would have been the  results of a finding in his favor, that the lower court preferred to  disregard precedents and law rather than illegitimatize the innocent  children of Jeremiah and Mary. The same view was taken by the higher  court, which absolved Mary of \"being fully acquainted with the legal  consequences of a solemnization of marriage.\" The court itself was  forced to regard the ceremony as \"a promise or engagement to marry,\"  rather than a completed and sacred contract. The opinion as rendered is  one long apology for declaring the Putney marriage invalid, in order to  save Mary Almira from the crime of bigamy and her children from being  the offspring of an illicit union.    The conclusion of the opinion reflects the spirit in which it was  rendered. \"It may be proper to add,\" said the court, \"that we are not  disposed to animadvert on the conduct of the parties or of their  respective friends and connections, nor to pronounce any opinion  further than is required to show the grounds of our determination. The  immediate parties may find some excuse or palliation in the  thoughtlessness of youth, the strength of affection, the pangs of  disappointment and blighted hopes, in versatility of feeling to which  all are subject, and in constitutional temperament. The conduct of the  friends of either is not to be judged of nor censured in consequence of  the unfortunate results which have attended this truly unfortunate  case. In judging of the past transactions of others, which have  terminated either favorably or unfavorably, we are apt to say that a  different course was required and would have produced a different  effect. But who can say what would have been the inevitable  consequences of a different line of conduct by the friends of either  party? The infatuation and the determination of the parties to pursue  that course which was most agreeable to their own feelings and views,  placed their friends and acquaintances in a very unpleasant situation,  and it would be wrong for us now to say that they were not actuated by  good motives, and did not pursue that line of conduct which they  thought at the time duty dictated. We inquire not as to the conduct of  others, we censure them not, nor do we say anything as to the parties  before us, except what has been thought necessary in deciding the  case.\"    The decree of nullification was affirmed in July, 1839, and before the  close of the year Roswell M. Field had shaken the dust of Vermont from  his feet and taken up his residence in St. Louis. Thus Vermont lost the  most brilliant young advocate of his day, and Missouri gained the  lawyer who was to adorn its bar and institute the proceedings for the  manumission of Dred Scott, the slave, whose case defined the issues of  our Civil War.          CHAPTER III    THE DRED SCOTT CASE      Vermont's loss was Missouri's gain. The young lawyer, who had been  admitted to the bar of his native state at the age of eighteen, was  fully equipped to match his learning, wit, and persuasive manners  against such men as Benton, Gamble, and Bates, who were the leaders of  the Missouri bar when, in 1839, Roswell Field took up his residence in  St. Louis. Now it was that his familiarity and facility with French,  German, and Spanish stood him in good stead and, combined with his  solid legal attainments, speedily won for him the rank of the ablest  lawyer in his adopted state.    But Roswell Field brought from Vermont something more than an  exceptional legal equipment and the familiarity with the languages that  is necessary to a mastery of the intricate old Spanish and French  claims which were plastered over Missouri in those"]]]
