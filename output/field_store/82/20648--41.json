In the long wall from the door to the garden  gate is only one small high window. But time and nature have done much  to beautify the spot. In the cracks of the roof, thatched or tiled,  whichever it may be, many a vagrant seed has found lodgment. The weeds  have grown up in profusion to cover the bare little place with  leaf and flower. Indeed, there is here a genuine roof garden of the  prettiest sort, and it extends along the stone wall separating the  dooryard from the garden. Some one who has seen these vine-fringed  walls in Barbizon describes them as gay with \"purple orris, stonecrop,  and pellitory.\"    A young wife presides in the little cottage home and rules her side  of the dooryard with gentle sway. She has a curly-haired baby boy who  creeps after her as she goes about her work. His inquiring mind is at  this age investigating all the corners of the house, and before long  he will be the young master of the dooryard.    The housewife boasts a small brood of hens. Early in the morning the  voice of the chanticleer is heard greeting the dawn. Presently  he leads his family forth to begin their day's scratching in the  dooryard. Here and there they wander with contented clucks, as they  find now and then a worm or grub for a titbit. But it is only a poor  living which is to be earned by scratching. The thrifty housewife sees  to it that her brood are well fed. At regular times she comes out of  the house to feed them with grain, as she is doing now.    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co. John Andrew  & Son, Sc. THE WOMAN FEEDING HENS]    The baby hears the mother's voice saying, in what is the French  equivalent, \"Here chick-chick-chick,\" and creeps swiftly to the door.  He, too, tries to call \"chick-chick.\" He watches the odd creatures  eagerly as they gobble up the seed. They stand about in a circle,  heads all together in the centre, bobbing up and down as long as any  food remains. Chanticleer holds back with true gallantry, and with an  air of masculine superiority. The belated members of the brood come  running up as fast as they can. The apron holds a generous supply, so  that there is enough for all, but the housewife doles it out prudently  by the handful, that none may suffer through the greediness of the  others.    As we study the lines of the picture a little, they teach us some  important lessons in composition. We note first the series of  perpendicular lines at regular intervals across the width of the  picture. These counterbalance the effect of the long perspective which  is so skilfully indicated in the drawing of the house and the garden  walk. The perspective is secured chiefly by three converging lines,  the roof and ground lines of the house, and the line of the garden  walk. These lines if extended would meet at a single point.    Once more let us recall Ruskin's teaching in regard to enclosed  spaces.[1] The artist is unhappy if shut in by impenetrable barriers.  There must always be, he says, some way of escape, it matters not by  how narrow a path, so that the imagination may have its liberty.    This is the principle which our painter has applied in his picture.  He wisely gives us a glimpse of the sky above, and shows us the shady  vista of the garden walk leading to the great world beyond.    Our illustration is from a charcoal drawing, which, like the Knitting  Lesson, is matched by a corresponding painting.      [Footnote 1: In _Modern Painters_ in the chapter on \"Infinity.\"]          VII    THE ANGELUS      The early twilight of autumn has overtaken two peasants at the close  of a day's work in the field. They are gathering the potato harvest.  The dried plants are first pulled up, and the potatoes carefully dug  out of the holes. Then the vegetables are taken from the furrows by  the basketful, and poured into brown linen sacks to be carried home  on the wheelbarrow. One of these sacks is not yet quite full, and the  work has been prolonged after sunset.    The field is a long way from the village, but in the still air sounds  are carried far across the plain. Suddenly the bell of the village  church peals forth. The man stops digging and plunges his fork into  the earth, and the woman hastily rises from her stooping posture. The  Angelus bell is ringing, and it calls them to prayer.    Three times each day, at sunrise, midday, and sunset, this bell  reminds the world of the birth of Jesus Christ. The strokes are rung  in three groups, corresponding to the three parts of The Angelus,  which are recited in turn. The first word gives the bell its  name,--Angelus, the Latin for angel.      \"The angel of the Lord announced to Mary,    And she conceived of the Holy Spirit.      \"Behold the handmaid of the Lord,    Be it done unto me according to thy word.      \"And the word was made flesh    And dwelt among us.\"    Thus run the words of the translation in the three couplets into which  they are separated, and then this prayer is added: \"We beseech thee, O  Lord, pour forth thy grace into our hearts; that as we have known the  incarnation of thy Son Jesus Christ by the message of an angel, so  by his cross and passion we may be brought into the glory of his  resurrection, through the same Jesus Christ our Lord.\"    Besides this, after each couplet of the Angelus, is recited that  short hymn of praise, beginning with the words which the angel of the  annunciation addressed to Mary,[1] \"Ave Maria.\" This is why the hour  after sunset is so often called the hour of Ave Maria. The English  poet Byron has written of this solemn moment:--      \"Ave Maria! blessed be the hour!    The time, the clime, the spot, where I so oft    Have felt that moment in its fullest power    Sink o'er the earth so beautiful and soft,    While swung the deep bell in the distant tower,    Or the faint dying day-hymn stole aloft,    And not a breath crept through the rosy air,    And yet the forest leaves seemed stirred with prayer.\"    [Illustration: From a carbon print by Braun, Clement & Co. John Andrew  & Son, Sc. THE ANGELUS]    The atmosphere of prayer pervades the picture. The woman stands with  bowed head and hands clasped over her breast. Her whole body sways  slightly forward in the intensity of her devotion. Her husband has  bared his head and holds his hat before him. Though he may seem  somewhat awkward, he is not less sincerely reverent.    The sunset light shines on the woman's blue apron, gilds the potato  sacks in the wheelbarrow, and gleams along the furrows. Farther away,  the withered plants are heaped in rows of little piles. Beyond, the  level plain stretches to meet the glowing sky, and, outlined on the  horizon, is the spire of the church where the bells are ringing.    As the meaning of the picture grows upon us, we can almost hear the  ringing of the bells. Indeed, to those familiar with such scenes in  actual life, the impression is very vivid. The friend to whom Millet  first showed his painting immediately exclaimed, \"It is the Angelus.\"  \"Then you can hear the bells,\" said the artist, and was content.    The solemn influence of the picture is deepened by the effects of the  twilight on the plains. A wide outlook across a level country, like  a view of the sea, is always impressive, but it has peculiar power  in the vague light which follows the sunset. Many poetic natures have  felt this mystic spell of the gloaming as it descends upon the plain.  Robert Louis Stevenson was one of these, and upon visiting Barbizon he  described vividly his feelings at such an hour. We are told also  that Millet loved to walk abroad at nightfall and note the mysterious  effects of the twilight. \"It is astonishing,\" he once said to his  brother in such a walk, \"how grand everything on the plain appears,  towards the approach of night, especially when we see the figures  thrown out against the sky. Then they look like giants.\"    In nearly all of Millet's pictures people are busy doing something.  Either hands or feet, and sometimes both hands and feet, are in  motion. They are pictures of action. In the Angelus, however, people  are resting from labor; it is a picture of repose. The busy hands  cease their work a moment, and the spirit rises in prayer. We have  already seen, in other pictures, how labor may be lightened by love.  Here we see labor glorified by piety.    The painting of the Angelus has had a remarkable history. The patron  for whom it was first intended was disappointed with the picture when  finished, and Millet had no little difficulty in finding a purchaser.  In the course of time it became one of the most popular works of the  painter, and is probably better known in our country than any other of  his pictures. In 1889 it was bought by an American, and was carried  on an exhibition tour through most of the large cities of the  United States. Finally it returned to France, where it is now in the  collection of M. Chauchard.    The Angelus is one of the few of Millet's works which have changed  with time. The color has grown dark and the canvas has cracked  somewhat, owing to the use of bitumen in the painting.      [Footnote 1: \"Hail Mary\"; see St. Luke, chapter i., verse 28.]          VIII    FILLING THE WATER-BOTTLES      The artist Millet loved to draw as well as to paint. Black and white  pictures had their charm for him as truly as those in color. Indeed,  he once said that \"tone,\" which is the most important part of color,  can be perfectly expressed in black and white. It is therefore not  strange that he made many drawings. Some of these, like the Knitting  Lesson and the Woman Feeding Hens, were, as we have seen, studies for  paintings. The picture called Filling the Water-Bottles was, on the  other hand, a charcoal drawing, corresponding to no similar painting.  It is in itself a finished work of art.    It is a typical French river scene which we see here, and it gives  us an idea how large a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1312"],[0,"Selected Stories of Bret Harte (#6)"],[1,"\"Ash-heels,\" as the  Innocent persisted in denominating the \"swift-footed Achilles.\"    So with small food and much of Homer and the accordion, a week passed  over the heads of the outcasts. The sun again forsook them, and again  from leaden skies the snowflakes were sifted over the land. Day by day  closer around them drew the snowy circle, until at last they looked from  their prison over drifted walls of dazzling white that towered twenty  feet above their heads. It became more and more difficult to replenish  their fires, even from the fallen trees beside them, now half-hidden in  the drifts. And yet no one complained. The lovers turned from the dreary  prospect and looked into each other's eyes, and were happy. Mr. Oakhurst  settled himself coolly to the losing game before him. The Duchess,  more cheerful than she had been, assumed the care of Piney. Only Mother  Shipton--once the strongest of the party--seemed to sicken and fade. At  midnight on the tenth day she called Oakhurst to her side. \"I'm going,\"  she said, in a voice of querulous weakness, \"but don't say anything  about it. Don't waken the kids. Take the bundle from under my head and  open it.\" Mr. Oakhurst did so. It contained Mother Shipton's rations for  the last week, untouched. \"Give 'em to the child,\" she said, pointing to  the sleeping Piney. \"You've starved yourself,\" said the gambler. \"That's  what they call it,\" said the woman, querulously, as she lay down again  and, turning her face to the wall, passed quietly away.    The accordion and the bones were put aside that day, and Homer was  forgotten. When the body of Mother Shipton had been committed to the  snow, Mr. Oakhurst took the Innocent aside, and showed him a pair of  snowshoes, which he had fashioned from the old pack saddle. \"There's one  chance in a hundred to save her yet,\" he said, pointing to Piney; \"but  it's there,\" he added, pointing toward Poker Flat. \"If you can reach  there in two days she's safe.\" \"And you?\" asked Tom Simson. \"I'll stay  here,\" was the curt reply.    The lovers parted with a long embrace. \"You are not going, too?\" said  the Duchess as she saw Mr. Oakhurst apparently waiting to accompany him.  \"As far as the canyon,\" he replied. He turned suddenly, and kissed the  Duchess, leaving her pallid face aflame and her trembling limbs rigid  with amazement.    Night came, but not Mr. Oakhurst. It brought the storm again and the  whirling snow. Then the Duchess, feeding the fire, found that someone  had quietly piled beside the hut enough fuel to last a few days longer.  The tears rose to her eyes, but she hid them from Piney.    The women slept but little. In the morning, looking into each other's  faces, they read their fate. Neither spoke; but Piney, accepting the  position of the stronger, drew near and placed her arm around the  Duchess's waist. They kept this attitude for the rest of the day. That  night the storm reached its greatest fury, and, rending asunder the  protecting pines, invaded the very hut.    Toward morning they found themselves unable to feed the fire, which  gradually died away. As the embers slowly blackened, the Duchess crept  closer to Piney, and broke the silence of many hours: \"Piney, can you  pray?\" \"No, dear,\" said Piney, simply. The Duchess, without knowing  exactly why, felt relieved, and, putting her head upon Piney's shoulder,  spoke no more. And so reclining, the younger and purer pillowing the  head of her soiled sister upon her virgin breast, they fell asleep.    The wind lulled as if it feared to waken them. Feathery drifts of snow,  shaken from the long pine boughs, flew like white-winged birds, and  settled about them as they slept. The moon through the rifted clouds  looked down upon what had been the camp. But all human stain, all trace  of earthly travail, was hidden beneath the spotless mantle mercifully  flung from above.    They slept all that day and the next, nor did they waken when voices  and footsteps broke the silence of the camp. And when pitying fingers  brushed the snow from their wan faces, you could scarcely have told from  the equal peace that dwelt upon them which was she that had sinned. Even  the law of Poker Flat recognized this, and turned away, leaving them  still locked in each other's arms.    But at the head of the gulch, on one of the largest pine trees, they  found the deuce of clubs pinned to the bark with a bowie knife. It bore  the following, written in pencil, in a firm hand:                  BENEATH THIS TREE                 LIES THE BODY                       OF                 JOHN OAKHURST,           WHO STRUCK A STREAK OF BAD LUCK            ON THE 23D OF NOVEMBER, 1850,                      AND               HANDED IN HIS CHECKS            ON THE 7TH DECEMBER, 1850.    And pulseless and cold, with a Derringer by his side and a bullet in his  heart, though still calm as in life, beneath the snow lay he who was at  once the strongest and yet the weakest of the outcasts of Poker Flat.          MIGGLES      We were eight, including the driver. We had not spoken during the  passage of the last six miles, since the jolting of the heavy vehicle  over the roughening road had spoiled the Judge's last poetical  quotation. The tall man beside the Judge was asleep, his arm passed  through the swaying strap and his head resting upon it--altogether a  limp, helpless-looking object, as if he had hanged himself and been cut  down too late. The French lady on the back seat was asleep, too, yet in  a half-conscious propriety of attitude, shown even in the disposition  of the handkerchief which she held to her forehead and which partially  veiled her face. The lady from Virginia City, traveling with her  husband, had long since lost all individuality in a wild confusion of  ribbons, veils, furs, and shawls. There was no sound but the rattling  of wheels and the dash of rain upon the roof. Suddenly the stage stopped  and we became dimly aware of voices. The driver was evidently in the  midst of an exciting colloquy with someone in the road--a colloquy of  which such fragments as \"bridge gone,\" \"twenty feet of water,\" \"can't  pass,\" were occasionally distinguishable above the storm. Then came  a lull, and a mysterious voice from the road shouted the parting  adjuration:    \"Try Miggles's.\"    We caught a glimpse of our leaders as the vehicle slowly turned, of a  horseman vanishing through the rain, and we were evidently on our way to  Miggles's.    Who and where was Miggles? The Judge, our authority, did not remember  the name, and he knew the country thoroughly. The Washoe traveler  thought Miggles must keep a hotel. We only knew that we were stopped by  high water in front and rear, and that Miggles was our rock of refuge.  A ten minutes splashing through a tangled by-road, scarcely wide enough  for the stage, and we drew up before a barred and boarded gate in a  wide stone wall or fence about eight feet high. Evidently Miggles's, and  evidently Miggles did not keep a hotel.    The driver got down and tried the gate. It was securely locked. \"Miggles!  O Miggles!\"    No answer.    \"Migg-ells! You Miggles!\" continued the driver, with rising wrath.    \"Migglesy!\" joined the expressman, persuasively. \"O Miggy! Mig!\"    But no reply came from the apparently insensate Miggles. The Judge,  who had finally got the window down, put his head out and propounded  a series of questions, which if answered categorically would have  undoubtedly elucidated the whole mystery, but which the driver evaded by  replying that \"if we didn't want to sit in the coach all night, we had  better rise up and sing out for Miggles.\"    So we rose up and called on Miggles in chorus; then separately. And when  we had finished, a Hibernian fellow-passenger from the roof called for  \"Maygells!\" whereat we all laughed. While we were laughing, the driver  cried \"Shoo!\"    We listened. To our infinite amazement the chorus of \"Miggles\" was  repeated from the other side of the wall, even to the final and  supplemental \"Maygells.\"    \"Extraordinary echo,\" said the Judge.    \"Extraordinary damned skunk!\" roared the driver, contemptuously. \"Come  out of that, Miggles, and show yourself! Be a man, Miggles! Don't hide  in the dark; I wouldn't if I were you, Miggles,\" continued Yuba Bill,  now dancing about in an excess of fury.    \"Miggles!\" continued the voice. \"O Miggles!\"    \"My good man! Mr. Myghail!\" said the Judge, softening the asperities of  the name as much as possible. \"Consider the inhospitality of refusing  shelter from the inclemency of the weather to helpless females. Really,  my dear sir--\" But a succession of \"Miggles,\" ending in a burst of  laughter, drowned his voice.    Yuba Bill hesitated no longer. Taking a heavy stone from the road, he  battered down the gate, and with the expressman entered the enclosure.  We followed. Nobody was to be seen. In the gathering darkness all that  we could distinguish was that we were in a garden--from the rosebushes  that scattered over us a minute spray from their dripping leaves--and  before a long, rambling wooden building.    \"Do you know this Miggles?\" asked the Judge of Yuba Bill.    \"No, nor, don't want to,\" said Bill, shortly, who felt the Pioneer Stage  Company insulted in his person by the contumacious Miggles.    \"But, my dear sir,\" expostulated the Judge as he thought of the barred  gate.    \"Lookee here,\" said Yuba Bill, with fine irony, \"hadn't you better go  back and sit in the coach till yer introduced? I'm going in,\" and he  pushed open the door of the building.    A long room lighted only by the embers of a fire that was dying on the  large hearth at its farther extremity; the walls curiously papered, and  the flickering firelight bringing out its grotesque pattern; somebody  sitting in a large armchair by the fireplace. All this we saw as we  crowded together into the room, after the driver and expressman.    \"Hello, be you Miggles?\" said Yuba Bill to the solitary"]]]
