The cattle on ranches  which are nearer to the seaports, manufacturing centres, or railway  stations show distinct improvements. Greater care is bestowed upon them,  and the main consideration is never lost sight of--it is the ambition of  every estanciero to have his cattle graded up so that they are looked  upon as \"freezers,\" which means that they are good enough to be  purchased by one or other of the refrigerating companies, who take  nothing but the best.    In 1888 cattle running the northern camps (which then represented the  extreme outlying posts) were only valued at $6 per head.    In 1890 the value had risen to $10 per head.   \" 1900   \"        \"     \"      15     \"   \" 1908   \"        \"     \"      28     \"   \" 1910   \"        \"     \"      40     \"    The question of stock raising and the object to be obtained must rest  with the owners: they must decide whether the land is to be utilised for  fattening cattle or for breeding the high-class animals for which there  is an ever-ready market. To show the enormous value of animals and the  high standard to which agricultural lands can be brought, mention must  be made of two estancias near Buenos Aires, viz., those belonging to  Messrs. Cobo and Messrs. Bell, where splendid stock is always to be  found. To give some idea of the high price paid for first-class pedigree  animals, it may be mentioned that L3,800 was paid for a prize Durham  bull which was sold to Argentina!    At the cattle show at Buenos Aires held in July, 1910, Herefords for  killing realized from L850 to L1,000 per animal! These latter high  prices were, however, evidently paid by the agents of Cold Storage  Companies for advertising purposes. One representative explained that  the freezing Companies desired to encourage breeders, and that his  Company paid the high prices mentioned above so as to let the breeders  know that they would always be paid high prices for first-class cattle.    When we consider the really important position which Argentina takes as  a food producer, it appears incredible that the English nation (business  men and the general public alike) is so extremely ignorant, as a rule,  of prevailing conditions. I do not refer to those who have invested  their money in the many channels known to the River Plate circle. But  men holding high official positions speak of our commercial interests in  Argentina as \"something between a hundred and a hundred and fifty  millions,\" and then in a whispered side-speech indicate the dangers of  revolution.    Often it is suggested that the chances of death from small-pox, yellow  fever, and even from murder are a serious drawback to what might  otherwise be a country possible to live in. It makes one very indignant  to hear these statements from the lips of those who probably have never  left their own country. Let me assure you they may be swept aside, and  were it not for their frequent reiteration it would be unnecessary to  say that there is not one grain of truth in these suggestions as applied  to the state of things to-day.    Nearly one-fifth of the population of Argentina is centred in and around  Buenos Aires. It is a city of 1,200,000 inhabitants, many of whom are  millionaires; but at the same time there exists much poverty within its  precincts--poverty caused in no small degree by the viciousness of the  rich, but to a far greater extent by the rooted objection of certain  classes to go out to the camps where, during the harvest time at least,  wages are high and labour is anxiously awaited.    When we compare the health of this city of Buenos Aires with that of  other large cities, we can see what has been done in the way of  improvements in the last few years. A glance at the following tables  will give some idea of what has been accomplished. The natural increase  of the population of Buenos Aires between 1898 and 1907 was 19.1 per  1,000, and no other city equals this.    The increase in London          was  8.8 per  1,000.         \"        Berlin           \"   8.5      \"         \"        New York         \"   5.7      \"         \"        St. Petersburg   \"   4.6      \"      The birth-rate of Buenos Aires for 1908 was 34.3 per 1,000.        \"       \"   London           \"        25.7        \"       \"   Berlin           \"        23.3        \"       \"   New York         \"        28.5        \"       \"   St. Petersburg   \"        27.5    Both these tables are, however, probably affected by the great number of  immigrants finding their way to Argentina, many of whom remain in Buenos  Aires.    The health of the City may be well gauged by the death-rate for the year  1907.    Buenos Aires stands well with 15.2 per 1,000 inhabitants.  London has a death-rate of    15.1       \"       \"  Berlin       \"       \"        14.8       \"       \"  New York     \"       \"        18.6       \"       \"  St. Petersburg       \"        25.7       \"       \"    (Undoubtedly the high rate shown by the last-named city is greatly due  to the foul condition of the Neva.)      To appreciate thoroughly the position which Buenos Aires now holds, and  the strides which have been made in regard to the sanitation of the  City, we have but to look at the past. Between the years 1889 and 1898  the death-rate per thousand was as high as 22.9 per 1,000; from 1899 to  1908 it was only 16.6, and now the record stands at 15.2 per 1,000.    The authorities are justly proud of what has been done, and will not  diminish their efforts so long as there is work to do and problems to  solve.    I should like to state once more the fact that the United Kingdom  depends upon Argentina for nearly one-fourth of her food supply  purchased abroad. I want to impress upon your mind the seriousness of  the position, for this proportion of one-fourth will be largely  increased in the near future, for reasons already stated.    The question has often been asked, \"Is it safe to buy land in  Argentina?\" But the drift of this query too often is merely  self-interest; in other words, it really means \"Can I successfully  speculate in land?\" Clearly the matter is solely a personal one, no  other consideration is thought of, so one is tempted to give an evasive  answer. Should the questioner, however, be a young fellow, with God's  gift of health and plenty of truth and grit in him, who wants not only  to acquire the land, but to work it, then, indeed, there is but one  answer, and that is in the affirmative--let him go, and let him ever  remember that he is an Englishman and that England is judged by the  conduct of her sons: but do not let him make the great mistake a  newcomer so often falls into, which is, that because he is an Englishman  all other nationalities must be inferior, and that by some sort of  divine right he has been created lord of all. Let him realise that those  whom he meets in Argentina are as noble and pure as those he left at  home. Argentina offers to-day a splendid opening for the best of  England's sons, but she does not want the loafer nor the ne'er-do-well.  Can it be wondered at that England's prestige is seriously injured when  so many of the \"wasters,\" and worse, are sent from the country? It is  but natural that from these, who go to foreign countries, England is  judged. To my mind we should send abroad men who are bound to succeed,  men who never forget that from their behaviour the Mother Country will  be appraised. Argentina will embrace and reward them, but she will spurn  and despise the dissolute and drunken.    The advice I would give to all those thinking of trying Argentina as a  field for agricultural work is to remember that to be successful one  must begin at the bottom, the harder the school the better will be the  result: you cannot detect and correct the faults which militate against  success unless you have been through the mill. Not long ago I sent a boy  out to Argentina and painted the first two years of learning in the new  country in rather lurid colours. I explained and dwelt on the  hardships--indeed, I described it as \"a dog's life.\" Within a year, the  lad wrote home to his parents and mentioned all that I had told him, but  finished up by saying, \"There's plenty of 'life' about it, but not much  'dog.'\" The truth is that the boy had accepted things as they came along  and had adapted himself to his surroundings, and, I predict, he will  never regret having left his home, where opportunities were cramped by  small surroundings, for the wider field of Argentina.    A great many Englishmen resident in Argentina, whose sons are looking  forward to finding their life's work in that country, send their boys  home to England to be educated. Far be it from me to deprecate the  training acquired by English public school life, but it might well be  worth while to consider the other phase. The boy who has had his  schooling in Argentina and goes through his training and passes into one  of their Universities will have to his credit something which cannot be  bought by money or influence by boys straight out from home. He will  have been a fellow student, and worked shoulder to shoulder with men who  will in due time occupy positions of power and influence, and it is just  as well to weigh out these things before deciding where to educate your  boy. A boy born in Argentina, whatever the nationality of his parents  may be, is by Argentine law an Argentine subject, and should be brought  up to appreciate that he is liable to be called upon to go through a  military course: the Argentine boy, who has had just as gentle an  upbringing as the English boy, is compelled to serve his time in the  army if called "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14368"],[0,"Hebraic Literature; Translations from the Talmud, Midrashim and Kabbala (#6)"],[1,"the wise, and I have never found anything of more material benefit  than silence.\"    _Avoth_, chap. 1.    Rabbi Akiva said, \"Laughter and levity lead a man to lewdness; but  tradition is a fence to the law, tithes are a fence to riches, vows are  a fence to abstinence, while the fence of wisdom is silence.\"    Ibid., chap. 3.    When they opened his brain, they found in it a gnat as big as a swallow  and weighing two selas.    _Gittin_, fol. 56, col. 2.        The context of the above states a tradition current among the      Jews in reference to Titus, the destroyer of Jerusalem. It is      said that when, after taking the city, he had shamefully      violated and profaned the Temple, he took the sacred vessels of      the sanctuary, wrapped them in the veil of the holy place, and      sailed with them to Rome. At sea a storm arose and threatened to      sink the ship; upon which he was heard reflecting, \"It seems the      God of these Jews has no power anywhere but at sea. Pharaoh He      drowned, and Sisera He drowned, and now He is about to drown me      also. If He be mighty, let Him go ashore and contend with me      there.\" Then came a voice from heaven and said, \"O thou wicked      one, son of a wicked man and grandson of Esau the wicked, go      ashore. I have a creature--an insignificant one in my world--go      and fight with it.\"        This creature was a gnat, and is called insignificant because it      must receive and discharge what it eats by one aperture.      Immediately, therefore, he landed, when a gnat flew up his      nostrils and made its way to his brain, on which it fed for a      period of seven years. One day he happened to pass a      blacksmith's forge, when the noise of the hammer soothed the      gnawing at his brain. \"Aha\" said Titus, \"I have found a remedy      at last;\" and he ordered a blacksmith to hammer before him. To a      Gentile for this he (for a time) paid four zuzim a day, but to a      Jewish blacksmith he paid nothing, remarking to him, \"It is      payment enough to thee to see thy enemy suffering so painfully.\"      For thirty days he felt relieved, but after, no amount of      hammering in the least relieved him. As to what happened after      his death, we have this testimony from Rabbi Phineas, the son of      Aruba: \"I myself was among the Roman magnates when an inquest      was held upon the body of Titus, and on opening his brain they      found therein a gnat as big as a swallow, weighing two selas.\"      Others say it was as large as a pigeon a year old and weighed      two litras. Abaii says, \"We found its mouth was of copper and      its claws of iron.\" Titus gave instructions that after his death      his body should be burned, and the ashes thereof scattered over      the surface of the seven seas, that the God of the Jews might      not find him and bring him to judgment. (_Gittin_, fol. 56, col.      2.)    \"The man with two wives, one young and the other old.\" Rav Ami and Rav  Assi were in social converse with Rabbi Isaac Naphcha, when one of them  said to him, \"Tell us, sir, some pretty legend,\" and the other said,  \"Pray explain to us rather some nice point of law.\" When he began the  legend he displeased the one, and when he proceeded to explain a point  of law, he offended the other. Whereupon he took up this parable in  illustration of the plight in which their obstinacy placed him. \"I am  like the man with the two wives, the one young and the other old. The  young one plucked out all his gray hairs (that he might look young), and  the old wife pulled out all his black hairs (that he might look old);  and so between the one and the other he became bald. So is it with me  between you. However, I've something nice for both of you. It is written  (Exod. xxii. 6), 'If a fire break out and catch in thorns, so that the  stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field be consumed  therewith, he that kindled the fire shall surely make restoration.' The  Holy One--blessed be He!--hath said, 'I must both judge myself and take  upon myself to indemnify the evil of the conflagration I have caused,  for I have kindled a fire in Zion,' as it is written (Lament, iv. 11),  'He hath kindled a fire in Zion, and hath devoured the foundations  thereof.' I must therefore rebuild her with fire, as it is written  (Zech. ii. 5), 'I will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will  be the glory in the midst of her.'\"    _Bava Kama_, fol. 60, col. 2.    Rabbi Oshaia asked, \"What is this that is written, (Zech. xi. 7), 'I  took unto me two staves; the one I called Amiable and the other  Destroyer'?\" The staff called Amiable represents the disciples of the  wise in the land of Israel, who were friendly one toward another in  their debates about the law. The staff called Destroyer represents the  disciples of the wise of Babylon, who in the like debates were fierce  tempered and not friendly toward one another. What is the meaning of  Babel or Babylon? Rabbi Yochanan says it means \"confused in the Bible,  confused in the Mishna, and confused in the Talmud.\" \"He hath set me in  dark places, as they that be dead of old\" (Lam. iii. 6). Rabbi Jeremiah  said by this we are to understand the Babylonian Talmud.    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 24, col. 1.        The Rabbis say these three hate their fellows--dogs, cocks, and      conjurors; to which some add, among others, the disciples of the      wise of Babylon. (_P'sachim_, fol. 113, col. 2.)        On his return from Babylon to the land of Israel, Rabbi Zira      fasted a hundred fasts, during which he prayed that he might be      enabled to forget the Babylonian Talmud. (_Bava Metzia_, fol.      85, col. 1.)    Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Yonathan traveled one day together; they came  to two roads, one of which led by the door of a place devoted to the  worship of idols, and the other by a place of ill fame. Upon which one  said to the other, \"Let us go by the former, because our inclination to  the evil that waylays us there is already extinguished.\" \"Nay, rather,\"  said the other, \"let us go by the latter, and curb our desires; so shall  we receive a reward in recompense.\" In this resolution they went on, and  as they passed the place the women humbled themselves before them and  withdrew ashamed into their chambers. Then Yochanan asked the other,  \"How didst thou know that this would occur to us?\" He made answer, \"From  what is written (in Prov. ii. 2), 'Discretion (in the law) shall  preserve thee.'\"    _Avodah Zarah_, fol. 17, cols. 1, 2.    Given two dry firebrands and one piece of green wood, the dry will set  fire to the green.    _Sanhedrin_, fol 93, col. 1.    With two dogs they caught the lion.    Ibid., fol. 95, col. 1.        Both these proverbs express the same idea, that a minority, be      it ever so strong, must give way to a majority.    \"And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed together\"  (Numb. xxii. 7). Midian and Moab were never friendly toward each other;  they were like two dogs tending a flock, always at variance. When the  wolf came upon the one, however, the other thought, \"If I do not help my  neighbor to-day, the wolf may come upon myself to-morrow;\" therefore the  two dogs leagued together and, killed the wolf. Hence, says Rabbi Pappa,  the popular saying, \"The mouse and the cat are combined to make a feast  on the fat of the unfortunate.\"    Ibid., fol. 105, col. 1.    Rabbi Yochanan, in the name of Yossi, the son of Zimra, asks, \"What is  this that is written (Ps. cxx. 3), 'What shall be given unto thee, or  what shall be added unto thee, O thou false tongue'?\" The Holy  One--blessed be He!--said to the tongue, \"All the members of the body  are erect, thou only art recumbent; all other members are without, thou  art within, and not only so, for I have surrounded thee with two walls,  one of bone and the other of flesh. What shall be given to thee, or what  shall be added unto thee, O thou false tongue?\" Rabbi Yochanan, in the  name of Yossi, says, \"He who slanders is an atheist, for it is written  (Ps. xii. 4), 'Who have said, With our tongues will we prevail; Our lips  are with us; who is lord over us?'\"    _Erchin_, fol. 15, col. 2.        Here are a few sayings from the Talmud on the abuse of the      tongue.    He who slanders, he who receives slander, and he who bears false witness  against his neighbor, deserve to be cast to the dogs.    _Psachim_, fol. 118, col. 1.    All animals will one day remonstrate with the serpent and say, \"The lion  treads upon his prey and devours it, the wolf tears and eats it, but  thou, what profit hast thou in biting?\" The serpent will reply (Eccl.  viii. II), \"I am no worse than a slanderer.\"    _Taanith_, fol. 8, col. 1.    Adonijah was deprived of life for no other reason than that he was given  to quarreling. It is lawful to slander one so evil disposed as he was.    _Perek Hashalom._    God will say to the prince of hell, \"I from above and thou from below  shall judge and condemn the slanderer.\"    _Erchin_, fol. 15, col. 2.    The third tongue (i.e., slander) hurts three parties: the slanderer  himself, the receiver of slander, and the person slandered.    Ibid.    Four classes do not receive the presence of the Shechinah: scorners,  liars, flatterers, and slanderers.    _Sanhedrin_, fol. 103, col. 1.    Where are we told that when two sit together and study the law the  Shechinah is with them? In Mal. iii. 16, where it is written, \"They that  feared the Lord spake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened and  heard it.\"    _Berachoth_, fol. 6, col. 1.    Why did Elijah employ two invocations, saying twice over, \"Hear me! hear  me!\" (1 Kings xviii. 37.) Elijah first prayed before God, \"O Lord, King  of the universe, hear me!\" that He might send fire down from heaven and  consume all that was upon the altar; and again he prayed, \"Hear me!\"  that they might not imagine that the result was a matter of sorcery; for  it is said, \"Thou "]]]
