I have  thrown myself heart and soul into this question because British pledges  abstract justice, and religious sentiment coincide. I can conceive the  possibility of a blind and fanatical religious sentiment existing in  opposition to pure justice. I should then resist the former and fight  for the latter. Nor would I insist upon pledges given dishonestly to  support an unjust cause as has happened with England in the case of the  secret treaties. Resistance there becomes not only lawful but obligatory  on the part of a nation that prides itself on its righteousness.    It is unnecessary for me to examine the position imagined by the English  friend, viz., how India would have fared had she been an independent  power. It is unnecessary because Indian Mahomedans, and for that matter  India, are fighting for a cause that is admittedly just; a cause in aid  of which they are invoking the whole-hearted support of the British  people. I would however venture to suggest that this is a cause in which  mere sympathy will not suffice. It is a cause which demands support that  is strong enough to bring about substantial justice.      FURTHER QUESTIONS ANSWERED    I have been overwhelmed with public criticism and private advice and  even anonymous letters telling me exactly what I should do. Some are  impatient that I do not advise immediate and extensive non-co-operation;  others tell me what harm I am doing the country by throwing it knowingly  in a tempest of violence on either side. It is difficult for me to deal  with the whole of the criticism, but I would summarize some of the  objections and endeavour to answer them to the best of my ability. These  are in addition to those I have already answered:--    (1) Turkish claim is immoral or unjust and how can I, a lover of truth  and justice, support it? (2) Even if the claim be just in theory, the  Turk is hopelessly incapable, weak and cruel. He does not deserve any  assistance.    (3) Even if Turkey deserves all that is claimed for her, why should I  land India in an international struggle?    (4) It is no part of the Indian Mahomedans' business to meddle in this  affair. If they cherish any political ambition, they have tried, they  have failed and they should now sit still. If it is a religious matter  with them, it cannot appeal to the Hindu reason in the manner it is put  and in any case Hindus ought not to identify themselves with Mahomedans  in their religious quarrel with Christendom.    (5) In no case should I advocate non-co-operation which in its extreme  sense is nothing but a rebellion, no matter how peaceful it may be.    (6) Moreover, my experience of last year must show me that it is beyond  the capacity of any single human being to control the forces of violence  that are lying dormant in the land.    (7) Non-co-operation is futile because people will never respond in  right earnest, and reaction that might afterwards set in will be worse  than the state of hopefulness we are now in.    (8) Non-co-operation will bring about cessation of all other activities,  even working of the Reforms, thus set back the clock of progress. (9)  However pure my motives may be, those of the Mussalmans are obviously  revengeful.    I shall now answer the objections in the order in which they are  stated--    (1) In my opinion the Turkish claim is not only not immoral and unjust,  but it is highly equitable, if only because Turkey wants to retain what  is her own. And the Mahomedan manifesto has definitely declared that  whatever guarantees may be necessary to be taken for the protection of  non-Muslim and non-Turkish races, should be taken so as to give the  Christians theirs and the Arabs their self-government under the Turkish  suzerainty.    (2) I do not believe the Turk to be weak, incapable or cruel. He is  certainly disorganised and probably without good generalship. He has  been obliged to fight against heavy odds. The argument of weakness,  incapacity and cruelty one often hears quoted in connection with those  from whom power is sought to be taken away. About the alleged massacres  a proper commission has been asked for, but never granted. And in any  case security can be taken against oppression.    (3) I have already stated that if I were not interested in the Indian  Mahomedans, I would not interest myself in the welfare of the Turks any  more than I am in that of the Austrians or the Poles. But I am bound as  an Indian to share the sufferings and trial of fellow-Indians. If I deem  the Mahomedan to be my brother. It is my duty to help him in his hour  of peril to the best of my ability, if his cause commends itself to  me as just.    (4) The fourth refers to the extent Hindus should join hands with the  Mahomedans. It is therefore a matter of feeling and opinion. It is  expedient to suffer for my Mahomedan brother to the utmost in a just  cause and I should therefore travel with him along the whole road so  long as the means employed by him are as honourable as his end. I cannot  regulate the Mahomedan feeling. I must accept his statement that the  Khilafat is with him a religious question in the sense that it binds him  to reach the goal even at the cost of his own life.    (5) I do not consider non-co-operation to be a rebellion, because it is  free from violence. In a larger sense all opposition to a Government  measure is a rebellion. In that sense, rebellion in a just cause is a  duty, the extent of opposition being determined by the measure of the  injustice done and felt.    (6) My experience of last year shows me that in spite of aberrations in  some parts of India, the country was entirely under control that the  influence of Satyagraha was profoundly for its good and that where  violence did break out there were local causes that directly contributed  to it. At the same time I admit that even the violence that did take  place on the part of the people and the spirit of lawlessness that was  undoubtedly shown in some parts should have remained under check. I have  made ample acknowledgment of the miscalculation I then made. But all the  painful experience that I then gained did not any way shake my belief in  Satyagraha or in the possibility of that matchless force being utilised  in India. Ample provision is being made this time to avoid the mistakes  of the past. But I must refuse to be deterred from a clear course;  because it may be attended by violence totally unintended and in spite  of extraordinary efforts that are being made to prevent it. At the same  time I must make my position clear. Nothing can possibly prevent a  Satyagrahi from doing his duty because of the frown of the authorities.  I would risk, if necessary, a million lives so long as they are  voluntary sufferers and are innocent, spotless victims. It is the  mistakes of the people that matter in a Satyagraha campaign. Mistakes,  even insanity must be expected from the strong and the powerful, and the  moment of victory has come when there is no retort to the mad fury of  the powerful, but a voluntary, dignified and quiet submission but not  submission to the will of the authority that has put itself in the  wrong. The secret of success lies therefore in holding every English  life and the life of every officer serving the Government as sacred as  those of our own dear ones. All the wonderful experience I have gained  now during nearly 40 years of conscious existence, has convinced me that  there is no gift so precious as that of life. I make bold to say that  the moment the Englishmen feel that although they are in India in a  hopeless minority, their lives are protected against harm not because of  the matchless weapons of destruction which are at their disposal, but  because Indians refuse to take the lives even of those whom they may  consider to be utterly in the wrong that moment will see a  transformation in the English nature in its relation to India and that  moment will also be the moment when all the destructive cutlery that is  to be had in India will begin to rust. I know that this is a far-off  vision. That cannot matter to me. It is enough for me to see the light  and to act up to it, and it is more than enough when I gain companions  in the onward march. I have claimed in private conversations with  English friends that it is because of my incessant preaching of the  gospel of non-violence and my having successfully demonstrated its  practical utility that so far the forces of violence, which are  undoubtedly in existence in connection with the Khilafat movement, have  remained under complete control.    (7) From a religious standpoint the seventh objection is hardly worth  considering. If people do not respond to the movement of  non-co-operation, it would be a pity, but that can be no reason for a  reformer not to try. It would be to me a demonstration that the present  position of hopefulness is not dependent on any inward strength or  knowledge, but it is hope born of ignorance and superstition.    (8) If non-co-operation is taken up in earnest, it must bring about a  cessation of all other activities including the Reforms, but I decline  to draw therefore the corollary that it will set back the clock of  progress. On the contrary, I consider non-co-operation to be such a  powerful and pure instrument, that if it is enforced in an earnest  spirit, it will be like seeking first the Kingdom of God and everything  else following as a matter of course. People will have then realised  their true power. They would have learnt the value of discipline,  self-control, joint action, non-violence, organisation and everything  else that goes to make a nation great and good, and not merely great.    (9) I do not know that I have a right to arrogate greater purity for  myself than for our Mussalman brethren.

We heard her say feebly,  \"No! No!\"    With this the woman hid away her half-worn slipper, and led the child  out, stroking her black shorn head. Perhaps it occurred to her that  brute force is not the solution for such a problem. She did nothing to  Judewin nor to me. She only returned to us our unhappy comrade, and left  us alone in the room.    During the first two or three seasons misunderstandings as ridiculous as  this one of the snow episode frequently took place, bringing  unjustifiable frights and punishments into our little lives.    Within a year I was able to express myself somewhat in broken English.  As soon as I comprehended a part of what was said and done, a  mischievous spirit of revenge possessed me. One day I was called in from  my play for some misconduct. I had disregarded a rule which seemed to me  very needlessly binding. I was sent into the kitchen to mash the turnips  for dinner. It was noon, and steaming dishes were hastily carried into  the dining-room. I hated turnips, and their odor which came from the  brown jar was offensive to me. With fire in my heart, I took the wooden  tool that the paleface woman held out to me. I stood upon a step, and,  grasping the handle with both hands, I bent in hot rage over the  turnips. I worked my vengeance upon them. All were so busily occupied  that no one noticed me. I saw that the turnips were in a pulp, and that  further beating could not improve them; but the order was, \"Mash these  turnips,\" and mash them I would! I renewed my energy; and as I sent the  masher into the bottom of the jar, I felt a satisfying sensation that  the weight of my body had gone into it.    Just here a paleface woman came up to my table. As she looked into the  jar, she shoved my hands roughly aside. I stood fearless and angry. She  placed her red hands upon the rim of the jar. Then she gave one lift and  stride away from the table. But lo! the pulpy contents fell through the  crumbled bottom to the floor I She spared me no scolding phrases that I  had earned. I did not heed them. I felt triumphant in my revenge, though  deep within me I was a wee bit sorry to have broken the jar.    As I sat eating my dinner, and saw that no turnips were served, I  whooped in my heart for having once asserted the rebellion within me.          IV.    THE DEVIL.      Among the legends the old warriors used to tell me were many stories of  evil spirits. But I was taught to fear them no more than those who  stalked about in material guise. I never knew there was an insolent  chieftain among the bad spirits, who dared to array his forces against  the Great Spirit, until I heard this white man's legend from a paleface  woman.    Out of a large book she showed me a picture of the white man's devil. I  looked in horror upon the strong claws that grew out of his fur-covered  fingers. His feet were like his hands. Trailing at his heels was a scaly  tail tipped with a serpent's open jaws. His face was a patchwork: he had  bearded cheeks, like some I had seen palefaces wear; his nose was an  eagle's bill, and his sharp-pointed ears were pricked up like those of a  sly fox. Above them a pair of cow's horns curved upward. I trembled with  awe, and my heart throbbed in my throat, as I looked at the king of evil  spirits. Then I heard the paleface woman say that this terrible creature  roamed loose in the world, and that little girls who disobeyed school  regulations were to be tortured by him.    That night I dreamt about this evil divinity. Once again I seemed to be  in my mother's cottage. An Indian woman had come to visit my mother. On  opposite sides of the kitchen stove, which stood in the center of the  small house, my mother and her guest were seated in straight-backed  chairs. I played with a train of empty spools hitched together on a  string. It was night, and the wick burned feebly. Suddenly I heard some  one turn our door-knob from without.    My mother and the woman hushed their talk, and both looked toward the  door. It opened gradually. I waited behind the stove. The hinges  squeaked as the door was slowly, very slowly pushed inward.    Then in rushed the devil! He was tall! He looked exactly like the  picture I had seen of him in the white man's papers. He did not speak to  my mother, because he did not know the Indian language, but his  glittering yellow eyes were fastened upon me. He took long strides  around the stove, passing behind the woman's chair. I threw down my  spools, and ran to my mother. He did not fear her, but followed closely  after me. Then I ran round and round the stove, crying aloud for help.  But my mother and the woman seemed not to know my danger. They sat  still, looking quietly upon the devil's chase after me. At last I grew  dizzy. My head revolved as on a hidden pivot. My knees became numb, and  doubled under my weight like a pair of knife blades without a spring.  Beside my mother's chair I fell in a heap. Just as the devil stooped  over me with outstretched claws my mother awoke from her quiet  indifference, and lifted me on her lap. Whereupon the devil vanished,  and I was awake.    On the following morning I took my revenge upon the devil. Stealing into  the room where a wall of shelves was filled with books, I drew forth The  Stories of the Bible. With a broken slate pencil I carried in my apron  pocket, I began by scratching out his wicked eyes. A few moments later,  when I was ready to leave the room, there was a ragged hole in the page  where the picture of the devil had once been.          V.    IRON ROUTINE      A loud-clamoring bell awakened us at half-past six in the cold winter  mornings. From happy dreams of Western rolling lands and unlassoed  freedom we tumbled out upon chilly bare floors back again into a  paleface day. We had short time to jump into our shoes and clothes, and  wet our eyes with icy water, before a small hand bell was vigorously  rung for roll call.    There were too many drowsy children and too numerous orders for the day  to waste a moment in any apology to nature for giving her children such  a shock in the early morning. We rushed downstairs, bounding over two  high steps at a time, to land in the assembly room.    A paleface woman, with a yellow-covered roll book open on her arm and a  gnawed pencil in her hand, appeared at the door. Her small, tired face  was coldly lighted with a pair of large gray eyes.    She stood still in a halo of authority, while over the rim of her  spectacles her eyes pried nervously about the room. Having glanced at  her long list of names and called out the first one, she tossed up her  chin and peered through the crystals of her spectacles to make sure of  the answer \"Here.\"    Relentlessly her pencil black-marked our daily records if we were not  present to respond to our names, and no chum of ours had done it  successfully for us. No matter if a dull headache or the painful cough  of slow consumption had delayed the absentee, there was only time enough  to mark the tardiness. It was next to impossible to leave the iron  routine after the civilizing machine had once begun its day's buzzing;  and as it was inbred in me to suffer in silence rather than to appeal to  the ears of one whose open eyes could not see my pain, I have many times  trudged in the day's harness heavy-footed, like a dumb sick brute.    Once I lost a dear classmate. I remember well how she used to mope along  at my side, until one morning she could not raise her head from her  pillow. At her deathbed I stood weeping, as the paleface woman sat near  her moistening the dry lips. Among the folds of the bedclothes I saw  the open pages of the white man's Bible. The dying Indian girl talked  disconnectedly of Jesus the Christ and the paleface who was cooling her  swollen hands and feet.    I grew bitter, and censured the woman for cruel neglect of our physical  ills. I despised the pencils that moved automatically, and the one  teaspoon which dealt out, from a large bottle, healing to a row of  variously ailing Indian children. I blamed the hard-working,  well-meaning, ignorant woman who was inculcating in our hearts her  superstitious ideas. Though I was sullen in all my little troubles, as  soon as I felt better I was ready again to smile upon the cruel woman.  Within a week I was again actively testing the chains which tightly  bound my individuality like a mummy for burial.    The melancholy of those black days has left so long a shadow that it  darkens the path of years that have since gone by. These sad memories  rise above those of smoothly grinding school days. Perhaps my Indian  nature is the moaning wind which stirs them now for their present  record. But, however tempestuous this is within me, it comes out as the  low voice of a curiously colored seashell, which is only for those ears  that are bent with compassion to hear it.          VI.    FOUR STRANGE SUMMERS.      After my first three years of school, I roamed again in the Western  country through four strange summers.    During this time I seemed to hang in the heart of chaos, beyond the  touch or voice of human aid. My brother, being almost ten years my  senior, did not quite understand my feelings. My mother had never gone  inside of a schoolhouse, and so she was not capable of comforting her  daughter who could read and write. Even nature seemed to have no place  for me. I was neither a wee girl nor a tall one; neither a wild Indian  nor a tame one. This deplorable situation was the effect of my brief  course in the East, and the unsatisfactory \"teenth\" in a girl's years.    It was under these trying conditions that, one bright afternoon, as I  sat restless and unhappy in my mother's cabin, I caught the sound of the  spirited step of my brother's pony on the road which passed by our  dwelling. Soon I heard the wheels of a light buckboard, and Dawee's"]]]
