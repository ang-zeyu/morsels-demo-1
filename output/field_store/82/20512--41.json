Many, on the other  hand, prefer to remain in Cairo. The American charge d'affaires in  Egypt, M. Knabenschuh, is considering this question. He has visited the  camp several times, and has transmitted different propositions of the  English Government to the Sublime Porte. The first offer was to  repatriate the interned women and children by means of an American  vessel, which would land them at the port of Mersina in Asia Minor. The  second was to take them back to Turkey in an English hospital ship,  which should at the same time carry medical supplies, food and clothing  to the English prisoners in Asia Minor, and bring away about 25 English  ladies who had been made prisoners in Mesopotamia. Finally, the English  Government offered to repatriate the Turkish women without any  reciprocity conditions. Unhappily, up to now all these proposals have  borne no fruit. The English Government sincerely desires to be freed  from the maintenance and surveillance of these people, whom it took  under its care merely for reasons of humanity.      _Special Inquiry at the Citadel Camp._--During our visit to the Maadi  Camp, Dr. Suleiman Bey, head physician at Taif, a town of the Hedjaz,  told us that he had personally nothing to complain of in the camp  treatment, but that his wife and children, interned in the Cairo  Citadel, were suffering greatly from the conditions there. What he  especially criticised was the diet and the medical attendance. These  complaints, made in much detail, seemed to us to deserve a specific  inquiry, and we went again to the Citadel next day. We closely  cross-questioned Mme. S. and another of the ladies. Her replies,  collected and confronted with the official data, our personal  observations, and the testimony of the other interned, absolutely  convinced us that Dr. Suleiman's accusations had no real foundation.  Mme. S. assured us that meat was only provided three times weekly. We  have proof that meat is served six times each week, a quarter of an  English pound being supplied to each person. After telling us that the  cheese and olives were of the worst quality, she finished by owning that  she only found the cheese too salt and the olives monotonous. Mme. S.,  who purchased coffee, biscuits, fruit and bonbons at the canteen, would  not touch ordinary bread because it was not good enough for her. This  bread, which is provided by the best bakery in Cairo, is served fresh  twice a day to whoever desires it. Mme. S. has enough money to buy any  food that she wishes, either from the canteen or by ordering it in from  the town. Her companions, less rich and less dainty, find the food  provided by the camp kitchen both excellent and abundant.    As Dr. Suleiman Bey complained that his two sick children, interned at  the Citadel with their mother, received no medical care, they were  examined by Dr. Blanchod. The one suffered on its arrival in camp from  ophthalmia, now completely cured, no trace of photophobia remains, no  redness nor oedema; the other had its sub-maxillary glands enlarged;  these glands are now reduced and nothing to worry about.    These two children have received constant care from (Dr.) Captain  Scrimgeour, their names are repeatedly entered in the infirmary  register, and their mother herself expressed gratitude for the care  which had been lavished upon them.    Dr. Suleiman Bey's complaints upon this point therefore proved equally  inexact.          ~6. The Ras-el-Tin Camp.~    _(Visited January 5, 1917.)_      This camp of interned civilians is situated on a rising ground beside  the sea, 5 kilometres (3 miles) from Alexandria.    The camp contains 45 Ottoman civilians of military age, and 24 others;  the latter are all elderly men, or have been exempted from military  service owing to illness. There is one priest (imaum). We also found 400  Austro-Germans interned at Ras-el-Tin; many of them had been in Egypt  when war was declared and could not get home.    Though our mission was to visit the Turkish prisoners, we made a point  of concerning ourselves equally with the Austrians and Germans, and of  entering into conversation with them.    Several Ottoman prisoners in the camp were making the pilgrimage to  Mecca when they were captured by the Sherif's troops and passed over to  the English authorities, who interned them. The camp at Ras-el-Tin was  to be evacuated in a few days' time, and all the occupants were to be  transferred to Sidi Bishr Camp, now prepared to accommodate 5,000 men.  In this camp there will be a special section for civilians.    The commandant of Ras-el-Tin is Major F.G. Owens, who takes the greatest  interest in his prisoners. Every day he personally receives anyone who  has a wish or a complaint to bring forward.    The camp was visited in 1916 by the American Consul from Alexandria, and  also by the American charge d'affaires from Athens.      _Accommodation._--The civilians interned in the camp of Ras-el-Tin are  placed in tents. These circular tents, set up either on the sand or on a  cement base, each contain three men. Those of the Ottoman prisoners form  one sectional group of 24 tents. In the centre of each tent is a  wire-work cupboard to contain personal belongings. The space inside the  tent is ample for the three beds. Some prisoners are provided with  matting and small rugs.    In the stone buildings surrounding the court a certain number of rooms  are reserved which open upon a veranda. Each contains three beds. These  comfortably fitted-up chambers are assigned to elderly prisoners or to  those in weak health. The rest of the camp buildings are occupied by the  administrative quarters, the kitchens, refectories, canteens, etc. The  English guard is lodged under canvas in a special section. The camp is  lighted by electricity.      _Bedding._--The bedsteads are iron provided with a wire-spring  mattress, a squab of vegetable fibre and a sufficient number of  blankets. All the bedding is kept scrupulously clean.      _Food._--The commissariat is supplied by a private contractor. A  committee presided over by the camp commandant, and composed of  delegates from among the prisoners, arrange the menus for each week. The  kitchen is very clean, and the prisoners do not provide the personnel.    Here is the menu for Friday, January 5, 1917,  the day of our visit:    _Breakfast_: Porridge; milk; chocolate; butter; bread.    _Lunch_: Haricot soup; ragout of beef and potatoes.    _Dinner_: Rice soup; hashed meat (moussaka), with vegetables;    eggs; tea.    The prisoners' menu is extended on Thursdays and Sundays by an extra  dish and cake of some sort. We examined the day's provision in the  kitchen, and found it wholesome and appetising. When pork is included in  the menu, which happens rarely, this item is replaced, in the case of  the Turkish prisoners, by a dish of eggs and vegetables.    A second kitchen staff, installed in a separate room, prepares a special  menu which the prisoners can have by paying for it. The commandant  himself authorised the reservation of this kitchen to provide for such  prisoners as possess ample means.    Here is the extra menu for January 5, 1917:    _Lunch_: Italian dumplings; roast veal; salad and gherkins.    _Dinner_: Soup \"parmentier\"; fish croquettes; braised beef with cabbage.    The meals are served at:    Breakfast, half-past seven.    Lunch, one o'clock.    Dinner, half-past five.    Three canteens furnish all kinds of commodities to the prisoners--ham,  sausages, preserves, cakes, chocolate, fruits, wine, beer, etc. The  prices are exactly the same as in the English army canteens. A shop, run  by a Bulgarian merchant, is permitted for the sale of tobacco, cigars  and cigarettes. Besides this there is a Viennese who makes cigarettes in  the camp itself. On Christmas Day the commandant made a generous  distribution of cigarettes to all the interned men at his own expense.  They can also obtain at the bar tea, coffee and other drinks. In point  of fact, we made sure that the camp administration has organised the  commissariat in a manner that meets all needs.      _Clothing._--The men arrived in camp in their own clothes. When these  began to wear out the administration furnished a new outfit, which  consists of two flannel shirts, two knitted pairs of drawers, a vest and  trousers of blue cloth, an overcoat, a police hat or a fez for the  Turks, socks and slippers. The Mahometans receive Turkish slippers. All  prisoners have a red scarf and two handkerchiefs. A well-found shop  sells under-clothing at moderate prices, and articles of outfit, scent,  post-cards and watches.      _Hygiene._--Drinking water, abundant and wholesome, is brought from the  mains of the town of Alexandria. Besides the toilet lavatories, there  are 4 bathrooms supplied with hot water and cold douches always  available. The prisoners go in parties to bathe in the sea near the  camp, under guard of British soldiers.    The prisoners do their own washing, numerous wash-houses being provided  for the purpose.    The latrines are partly on the English and partly on the Turkish system,  1 to every 10 men, cleanly kept. They are disinfected daily. The floor  and the lower part of the chambers are treated with cresol; the upper  part is whitewashed. The sewers discharge into the sea. The sweepings  are burnt in a special stove.      _Medical Attention._--The sanitary condition of the camp is inspected at  regular intervals by the Colonel, medical director of Hospital No. 21,  Alexandria. Captain (Dr.) Dunne is resident in the camp; he pays a  medical visit each day at 9 o'clock. Eight to ten prisoners out of the  total in camp may present themselves for treatment, among them 1 or 2  Ottomans.    An interned Turkish civilian, Abrahim"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10598"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume I. (#6)"],[1,"was charged  with having children by a mistress he kept, he protected that in his  conscience he kept her in the notion of a wife: And such was his  cowardice, that he chose rather to confess adultery than own marriage,  a crime at that time more subjected to punishment than the other.

He was an author of some eminence and merit, tho' there are few things  preserved concerning him, and he has been neglected by almost all the  biographers of the poets. That excellent writer Mrs. Cooper seems to  have a pretty high opinion of his abilities; it is certain that he  very considerably refined the language, and his verses are much  smoother than those of Harding, who wrote but a few years before him.  He stiles himself Priest, and Chaplain in the College of St. Mary,  Otory, in the county of Devon, and afterwards Monk of Ely. His  principal work is a translation of a satirical piece, written  originally in high Dutch, and entitled the Ship of Fools: It exposes  the characters, vices, and follies of all degrees of men, and tho'  much inferior in its execution to the Canterbury Tales, has yet  considerable merit, especially when it is considered how barren and  unpolite the age was in which he flourished. In the prologue to this  he makes an apology for his youth, and it appears that the whole was  finished Anno Dom.-1508, which was about the close of the reign of  Henry VII. In elegancy of manners he has the advantage of all his  predecessors, as is particularly remarkable in his address to Sir  Giles Alington, his patron. The poet was now grown old, and the knight  desiring him to abridge and improve Gower's Confessio Amantis, he  declines it in the politest manner, on account of his age, profession,  and infirmities; 'but tho' love is an improper subject, 'says he, I  am still an admirer of the sex, and shall 'introduce to the honour of  your acquaintance, 'four of the finest ladies that nature ever framed,  'Prudence, Temperance, Justice, and Magnanimity;' the whole of the  address is exceeding courtly, and from this I shall quote a few lines,  which will both illustrate his politeness and versification      To you these accorde; these unto you are due,    Of you late proceeding as of their head fountayne;    Your life as example in writing I ensue,    For, more then my writing within it can contayne:    Your manners performeth and doth there attayne:    So touching these vertues, ye have in your living    More than this my meter conteyneth in writing.    My dities indited may counsell many one,    But not you, your maners surmounteth my    doctrine    Wherefore, I regard you, and your maners all    one,    After whose living my processes, I combine:    So other men instrusting, I must to you encline    Conforming my process, as much as I am able,    To your sad behaviour and maners commendable.    He was author of the following pieces.    Lives of several of the Saints.    Salust's History of the Jugurthiam war translatcd into English.    The Castle of Labour, translated from the French into English.    Bale gives this author but an indifferent character as to his morals;  he is said to have intrigued with women, notwithstanding his clerical  profession: It is certain he was a gay courtly man, and perhaps, tho'  he espoused the Church in his profession, he held their celebacy and  pretended chastity in contempt, and being a man of wit, indulged  himself in those pleasures, which seem to be hereditary to the poets.           *       *       *       *       *      Sir THOMAS MORE.    Tho' poetry is none of the excellencies in which this great man was  distinguished, yet as he wrote some verses with tolerable spirit, and  was in almost every other respect one of the foremost geniusses our  nation ever produced, I imagine a short account of his life here will  not be disagreable to the readers, especially as all Biographers of  the Poets before me have taken notice of him, and ranked him amongst  the number of Bards. Sir Thomas More was born in Milk-street, London,  A.D. 1480. He was son to Sir John More, Knight, and one of the  Justices of the King's-Bench, a man held in the highest esteem at  that time for his knowledge in the law and his integrity in the  administration of justice. It was objected by the enemies of Sir  Thomas, that his birth was obscure, and his family mean; but far  otherwise was the real case. Judge More bore arms from his birth,  having his coat of arms quartered, which proves his having come to his  inheritance by descent. His mother was likewise a woman of family, and  of an extraordinary virtue.    Doctor Clement relates from the authority of our author himself, a  vision which his mother had, the next night after her marriage. She  thought she saw in her sleep, as it were engraven in her wedding ring,  the number and countenances of all the children she was to have, of  whom the face of one was so dark and obscure, that she could not well  discern it, and indeed she afterwards suffered an untimely delivery of  one of them: the face of the other she beheld shining most gloriously,  by which the future fame of Sir Thomas was pre-signified. She also  bore two daughters. But tho' this story is told with warmth by his  great grandson, who writes his life, yet, as he was a Roman Catholic,  and and disposed to a superstitious belief in miracles and visions,  there is no great stress to be laid upon it. Lady More might perhaps  communicate this vision to her son, and he have embraced the belief  of it; but it seems to have too little authority, to deserve credit  from posterity.    Another miracle is related by Stapleton, which is said to have  happened in the infancy of More. His nurse one day crossing a river,  and her horse stepping into a deep place, exposed both her and the  child to great danger. She being more anxious for the safety of the  child than her own, threw him over a hedge into a field adjoining, and  escaping likewise from the imminent danger, when she came to take him  up, she found him quite unhurt and smiling sweetly upon her.    He was put to the free-school in London called St. Anthony's, under  the care of the famous Nicholas Holt, and when he had with great  rapidity acquired a knowledge of his grammar rules, he was placed by  his father's interest under the great Cardinal Merton, archbishop of  Canterbury, and Lord High Chancellor, whose gravity and learning,  generosity and tenderness, allured all men to love and honour him.  To him More dedicated his Utopia, which of all his works is  unexceptionably the most masterly and finished. The Cardinal finding  himself too much incumbered with business, and hurried with state  affairs to superintend his education, placed him in Canterbury  College in Oxford, whereby his assiduous application to books, his  extraordinary temperance and vivacity of wit, he acquired the first  character among the students, and then gave proofs of a genius that  would one day make a great blaze in the world. When he was but  eighteen years old such was the force of his understanding, he wrote  many epigrams which were highly esteemed by men of eminence, as  well abroad as at home. Beatus Rhenanus in his epistle to Bilibalus  Pitchemerus, passes great encomiums upon them, as also Leodgarius a  Quercu, public reader of humanity at Paris. One Brixius a German, who  envied the reputation of this young epigramatist, wrote a book against  these epigrams, under the title of Antimorus, which had no other  effect than drawing Erasmus into the field, who celebrated and  honoured More; whose high patronage was the greatest compliment the  most ambitious writer could expect, so that the friendship of Erasmus  was cheaply purchased by the malevolence of a thousand such critics as  Brixius. About the same time of life he translated for his exercise  one of Lucian's orations out of Greek into Latin, which he calls his  First Fruits of the Greek Tongue; and adds another oration of his own  to answer that of Lucian; for as he had defended him who had slain a  tyrant, he opposed against it another with such forcible arguments,  that it seems not to be inferior to Lucian's, either in invention or  eloquence: When he was about twenty years old, finding his appetites  and passions very predominant. He struggled with all the heroism of a  christian against their influence, and inflicted severe whippings and  austere mortifications upon himself every friday and on high fasting  days, left his sensuality would grow too insolent, and at last subdue  his reason. But notwithstanding all his efforts, finding his lusts  ready to endanger his soul, he wisely determined to marry, a remedy  much more natural than"]]]
