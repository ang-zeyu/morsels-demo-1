The majority of the German princes returned to Europe: and \"there  remained beneath the banner of Christ only a weak band of warriors  faithful to their vow, a boy-chief, and a bier.  When the crusaders of  the other nations, assembled before St. Jean d'Acre, saw the remnant of  that grand German army arrive, not a soul could restrain his tears.  Three thousand men, all but stark naked, and harassed to death, marched  sorrowfully along, with the dried bones of their emperor carried in a  coffin.  For, in the twelfth century, the art of embalming the dead was  unknown.  Barbarossa, before leaving Europe, had asked that, if he should  die in the crusade, he might be buried in the church of the Resurrection  at Jerusalem; but this wish could not be accomplished, as the Christians  did not recover the Holy City, and the mortal remains of the emperor were  carried, as some say, to Tyre, and, as others, to Antioch, Where his tomb  has not been discovered.\"  (_Histoire de la Lutte des Papes et des  Empereurs de la Maison de Souabe,_ by M. de Cherrier, Member of the  Institute, t. i., p. 222.)    Frederick Barbarossa was already dead in Asia Minor, and the German army  was already broken up, when, on the 24th of June, 1190, Philip Augustus  went and took the oriflamme at St. Denis, on his way to Vezelai, where he  had appointed to meet Richard, and whence the two kings, in fact, set  out, on the 4th of July, to embark with their troops, Philip at Genoa,  and Richard at Marseilles.  They had agreed to touch nowhere until they  reached Sicily, where Philip was the first to arrive, on the 16th of  September; and Richard was eight days later.  But, instead of simply  touching, they passed at Messina all the autumn of 1190, and all the  winter of 1190-91, no longer seeming to think of anything but quarrelling  and amusing themselves.  Nor were grounds for quarrel or opportunities  for amusements to seek.  Richard, in spite of his promise, was unwilling  to marry the Princess Alice, Philip's sister; and Philip, after lively  discussion, would not agree to give him back his word, save \"in  consideration of a sum of ten thousand silver marks, whereof he shall pay  us three thousand at the feast of All Saints, and year by year in  succession, at this same feast.\"  Some of their amusements were not more  refined than their family arrangements, and ruffianly contests and  violent enmities sprang up amidst the feasts and the games in which kings  and knights nearly every evening indulged in the plains round about  Messina.  One day there came amongst the crusaders thus assembled a  peasant driving an ass, laden with those long and strong reeds known by  the name of canes.  English and French, with Richard at their head,  bought them of him; and, mounting on horseback, ran tilt at one another,  armed with these reeds by way of lances.  Richard found himself opposite  to a French knight, named William des Barres, of whose strength and valor  he had already, not without displeasure, had experience in Normandy.  The  two champions met with so rude a shock that their reeds broke, and the  king's cloak was torn.  Richard, in pique, urged his horse violently  against the French knight, in order to make him lose his stirrups; but  William kept a firm seat, whilst the king fell under his horse, which  came down in his impetuosity.  Richard, more and more exasperated, had  another horse brought, and charged a second time, but with no more  success, the immovable knight.  One of Richard's favorites, the Earl of  Leicester, would have taken his place, and avenged his lord; but \"let be,  Robert,\" said the king: \"it is a matter between him and me;\" and he once  more attacked William des Barres, and once more to no purpose.  \"Fly from  my sight,\" cried he to the knight, \"and take care never to appear again;  for I will be ever a mortal foe to thee, to thee and thine.\"  William des  Barres, somewhat discomfited, went in search of the King of France, to  put himself under his protection.  Philip accordingly paid a visit to  Richard, who merely said, \"I'll not hear a word.\"  It needed nothing less  than the prayers of the bishops, and even, it is said, a threat of  excommunication, to induce Richard to grant William des Barres the king's  peace during the time of pilgrimage.    Such a comrade was assuredly very inconvenient, and might be under  difficult circumstances very dangerous.  Philip, without being  susceptible or quarrelsome, was naturally independent, and disposed to  act, on every occasion, according to his own ideas.  He resolved, not to  break with Richard, but to divide their commands, and separate their  fortunes.  On the approach of spring, 1191, he announced to him that the  time had arrived for continuing their pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and  that, as for himself, he was quite ready to set out.  \"I am not ready,\"  said Richard; \"and I cannot depart before the middle of August.\"  Philip,  after some discussion, set out alone, with his army, on the 30th of  March, and on the 14th of April arrived before St. Jean d'.Acre.  This  important place, of which Saladin had made himself master nearly four  years before, was being besieged by the last King of Jerusalem, Guy de  Lusignan, at the head of the Christians of Palestine, and by a multitude  of crusaders, Genoese, Danish, Flemish, and German, who had flocked  freely to the enterprise.  A strong and valiant Mussulman garrison was  defending St. Jean d'Acre.  Saladin manoeuvred incessantly for its  relief, and several battles had already been fought beneath the walls.  When the King of France arrived, he was received by the Christians  besieging,\" say the chronicles of St. Denis, \"with supreme joy, as if he  were an angel come down from heaven.\".  Philip set vigorously to work to  push on the siege; but at his departure he had promised Richard not to  deliver the grand assault until they had formed a junction before the  place with all their forces.  Richard, who had set out from Messina at  the beginning of May, though he had said that he would not be ready till  August, lingered again on the way to reduce the island of Cyprus, and to  celebrate there his marriage with Berengaria of Navarre, in lieu of Alice  of France.  At last he arrived, on the 7th of June, before St. Jean  d'Acre; and several assaults in succession were made on the place with  equal determination on the part of the besiegers and the besieged.  \"The  tumultuous waves of the Franks,\" says an Arab historian, \"rolled towards  the walls of the city with the rapidity of a torrent; and they climbed  the half-ruined battlements as wild goats climb precipitous rocks, whilst  the Saracens threw themselves upon the besiegers like stones unloosed  from the top of a mountain.\"  At length, on the 13th of July, 1191, in  spite of the energetic resistance offered by the garrison, which defended  itself \"as a lion defends his blood-stained den,\" St. Jean d'Acre  surrendered.  The terms of capitulation stated that two hundred thousand  pieces of gold should be paid to the chiefs of the Christian army; that  sixteen hundred prisoners and the wood of the true cross should be given  up to them; and that the garrison as well as all the people of the town  should remain in the conquerors' power, pending full execution of the  treaty.    Whilst the siege was still going on, the discord between the Kings of  France and England was increasing in animosity and venom.  The conquest  of Cyprus had become a new subject of dispute.  When the French were most  eager for the assault, King Richard remained in his tent; and so the  besieged had scarcely ever to repulse more than one or other of the kings  and armies at a time.  Saladin, it is said, showed Richard particular  attention, sending him grapes and pears from Damascus; and Philip  conceived some mistrust of these relations.  In camp the common talk,  combined with anxious curiosity, was, that Philip was jealous of  Richard's warlike popularity, and Richard was jealous of the power and  political weight of the King of France.    When St.  Jean d'Acre had been taken, the judicious Philip, in view of  what it had cost the Christians of East and West, in time and blood, to  recover this single town, considered that a fresh and complete conquest  of Palestine and Syria, which was absolutely necessary for a  re-establishment of the kingdom of Jerusalem, was impossible: he had  discharged what he owed to the crusade; and the course now permitted and  prescribed to him was to give his attention to France.  The news he  received from home was not encouraging; his son Louis, hardly four years  old, had been dangerously ill; and he himself fell ill, and remained some  days in bed, in the midst of the town he had just conquered.  His enemies  called his illness in question, for already there was a rumor abroad that  he had an idea of giving up the crusade, and returning to France; but the  details given by contemporary chroniclers about the effects of his  illness scarcely permit it to be regarded as a sham.  \"Violent sweats,\"  they say, \"committed such havoc with his bones and all his members, that  the nails fell from his fingers and the hair from his head, insomuch that  it was believed--and, indeed, the rumor is not yet dispelled--that he had  taken a deadly poison.\"  There was nothing strange in Philip's illness,  after all his fatigues, in such a country and such a season; Saladin,  too, was ill at the same time, and more than once unable to take part  with his troops in their engagements.  But, however that may be, a  contemporary English chronicler, Benedict, Abbot of Peterborough, relates  that, on the 22d of July, 1191, whilst King Richard was playing chess  with the Earl of Gloucester, the Bishop of Beauvais, the Duke of  Burgundy, and two knights of consideration, presented themselves before  him on behalf of the King of France.  \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11953"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 3 (#6)"],[1," said he, \"I should acknowledge myself guilty of  crimes from which I feel myself free.  Here, as elsewhere, I am at the  will of God; He gave me all I have, and He can take it away whensoever He  pleases.  I served King Charles of blessed memory, and also the king, his  son; and they recompensed me handsomely for my services.  I will abide  the judgment of the parliament of Paris touching what I have done  according to my king's commands as to the affairs of the realm.\"  He was  told that the people sent to look for him were hard by, and was asked,  \"Shall we open to them?\"  \"Why not?\" was his reply.  He himself went to  meet them, and received them with a courtesy which they returned.  He was  then removed to Paris, where he was shut up with his colleagues in the  Louvre.    Their trial before parliament was prosecuted eagerly, especially in the  case of the absent De Clisson, whom a royal decree banished from the  kingdom \"as a false and wicked traitor to the crown, and condemned him to  'pay a hundred thousand marks of silver, and to forfeit forever the  office of constable.'\"  It is impossible in the present day to estimate  how much legal justice there was in this decree; but, in any case, it was  certainly extreme severity to so noble and valiant a warrior who had done  so much for the safety and honor of France.  The Dukes of Burgundy and  Berry and many barons of the realm signed the decree; but the king's  brother, the Duke of Orleans, refused to have any part in it.  Against  the other councillors of the king the prosecution was continued, with  fits and starts of determination, but in general with slowness and  uncertainty.  Under the influence of the Dukes of Burgundy and Berry, the  parliament showed an inclination towards severity; but Bureau de la  Riviere had warm friends, and amongst others, the young and beautiful  Duchess of Berry, to whose marriage he had greatly contributed, and John  Juvenal des Ursins, provost of the tradesmen of Paris, one of the men  towards whom the king and the populace felt the highest esteem and  confidence.  The king, favorably inclined towards the accused by his own  bias and the influence of the Duke of Orleans, presented a demand to  parliament to have the papers of the procedure brought to him. Parliament  hesitated and postponed a reply; the procedure followed its course; and  at the end of some months further the king ordered it to be stopped, and  Sires de la Riviere and Neviant to be set at liberty and to have their  real property restored to them, at the same time that they lost their  personal property and were commanded to remain forever at fifteen  leagues' distance, at least, from the court.  This was moral equity, if  not legal justice.  The accused had been able and faithful servants of  their king and country.  Their imprisonment had lasted more than a year.  The Dukes of Burgundy and Berry remained in possession of power.    They exercised it for ten years, from 1392 to 1402, without any great  dispute between themselves--the Duke of Burgundy's influence being  predominant--or with the king, who, save certain lucid intervals, took  merely a nominal part in the government.  During this period no event of  importance disturbed France internally.  In 1393 the King of England,  Richard II., son of the Black Prince, sought in marriage the daughter of  Charles VI., Isabel of France, only eight years old.  In both courts and  in both countries there was a desire for peace.  An embassy came in state  to demand the hand of the princess.  The ambassadors were presented, and  the Earl of Northampton, marshal of England, putting one knee to the  ground before her, said, \"Madame, please God you shall be our sovereign  lady and Queen of England.\"  The young girl, well tutored, answered, \"If  it please God and my lord and father that I should be Queen of England, I  would be willingly, for I have certainly been told that I should then be  a great lady.\"  The contract was signed on the 9th of March, 1396, with a  promise that, when the princess had accomplished her twelfth year, she  should be free to assent to or refuse the union; and ten days after the  marriage, the king's uncles and the English ambassadors mutually signed a  truce, which promised--but quite in vain--to last for eight and twenty  years.    About the same time Sigismund, King of Hungary, threatened with an  invasion of his kingdom by the great Turkish Sultan Bajazet I., nicknamed  Lightning (El Derfr), because of his rapid conquests, invoked the aid of  the Christian kings of the West, and especially of the King of France.  Thereupon there was a fresh outbreak of those crusades so often renewed  since the end of the thirteenth century.  All the knighthood of France  arose for the defence of a Christian king.  John, Count of Nevers, eldest  son of the Duke of Burgundy, scarcely eighteen years of age, said to his  comrades, \"If it pleased my two lords, my lord the king and my lord and  father, I would willingly head this army and this venture, for I have a  desire to make myself known.\"  The Duke of Burgundy consented, and, in  person, conducted his son to St. Denis, but without intending to make him  a knight as yet.  \"He shall receive the accolade,\" said he, \"as a knight  of Jesus Christ, at the first battle against the infidels.\"  In April,  1396, an army of new crusaders left France and traversed Germany  uproariously, everywhere displaying its valiant ardor, presumptuous  recklessness, and chivalrous irregularity.  Some months elapsed without  any news; but, at the beginning of December, there were seen arriving in  France some poor creatures, half naked, dying of hunger, cold, and  weariness, and giving deplorable accounts of the destruction of the  French army.  The people would not believe them: \"They ought to be thrown  into the water,\" they said, \"these scoundrels who propagate such lies.\"  But, on the 23th of December, there arrived at Paris James de Helly, a  knight of Artois, who, booted and spurred, strode into the hostel of  St. Paul, threw himself on his knees before the king in the midst of the  princes, and reported that he had come straight from Turkey; that on the  28th of the preceding September the Christian army had been destroyed at  the battle of Nicopolis; that most of the lords had been either slain in  battle or afterwards massacred by the sultan's order; and that the Count  of Nevers had sent him to the king and to his father the duke, to get  negotiations entered into for his release.  There was no exaggeration  about the knight's story.  The battle had been terrible, the slaughter  awful.  For the latter, the French, who were for a moment victorious, had  set a cruel example with their prisoners; and Bajazet had surpassed them  in cool ferocity.  After the first explosion of the father's and the  people's grief, the ransom of the prisoners became the topic.  It was a  large sum, and rather difficult to raise; and, whilst it was being sought  for, James de Helly returned to report as much to Bajazet, and to place  himself once more in his power.  \"Thou art welcome,\" said the sultan;  \"thou hast loyally kept thy word; I give thee thy liberty; thou canst go  whither thou wiliest.\"    Terms of ransom were concluded; and the sum total was paid through the  hands of Bartholomew Pellegrini, a Genoese trader.  Before the Count of  Nevers and his comrades set out, Bajazet sent for them.  \"John,\" said he  to the count through an interpreter, \"I know that thou art a great lord  in thy country, and the son of a great lord.  Thou art young.  It may be  that thou art abashed and grieved at what hath befallen thee in thy first  essay of knighthood, and that, to retrieve thine honor, thou wilt collect  a powerful army against me.  I might, ere I release thee, bind thee by  oath not to take arms against me, neither thyself nor thy people.  But  no; I will not exact this oath either from them or from thee.  When thou  hast returned yonder, take up arms if it please thee, and come and attack  me.  Thou wilt find me ever ready to receive thee in the open field, thee  and thy men-at-arms.  And what I say to thee, I say for the sake of all  the Christians thou mayest purpose to bring.  I fear them not; I was born  to fight them, and to conquer the world.\"  Everywhere and at all times  human pride, with its blind arrogance, is the same.  Bajazet saw no  glimpse of that future when his empire would be decaying, and held  together only by the interested protection of Christian powers.  After  paying dearly for their errors and their disasters, Count John of Nevers  and his comrades in captivity re-entered France in February, 1398, and  their expedition to Hungary was but one of the last vain ventures of  chivalry in the great struggle that commenced in the seventh century  between Islamry and Christendom.    While this tragic incident was taking place in Eastern Europe, the court  of the mad king was falling a victim to rivalries, intrigues, and  scandals which, towards the close of this reign, were to be the curse and  the shame of France.  There had grown up between Queen Isabel of Bavaria  and Louis, Duke of Orleans, brother of the king, an intimacy which,  throughout the city and amongst all honorable people, shocked even the  least strait-laced.  It was undoubtedly through the queen's influence  that Charles VI., in 1402, suddenly decided upon putting into the hands  of the Duke of Orleans the entire government of the realm and the right  of representing him in everything during the attacks of his malady.  The  Duke of Burgundy wrote at once about it to the parliament of Paris,  saying, \"Take counsel and pains that the interests of the king and his  dominion be not governed as they now are, for, in good truth, it is a  pity and a grief to hear what is told me about it.\"  The accusation was  not grounded solely upon the personal ill-temper of the Duke of Burgundy.  His nephew, the"]]]
