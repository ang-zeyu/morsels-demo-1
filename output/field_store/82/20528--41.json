CELTIS.    CELTIS AUSTRALIS.--South Europe, 1796. This species is much like C.  occidentalis, with black edible fruit. It is not of so tall growth as  the American species.    C. OCCIDENTALIS.--Nettle tree. North America, 1656. In general  appearance this tree resembles the Elm, to which family it belongs. It  has reticulated, cordate-ovate, serrated leaves, with small greenish  flowers on slender stalks, and succeeded by blackish-purple fruit about  the size of a pea. A not very ornamental tree, at least so far as  flowers are concerned, but valuable for lawn planting. It varies very  much in the size and shape of the leaves.      CERCIS.    CERCIS CANADENSIS.--North America, 1730. This species resembles C.  Siliquastrum, but is of much smaller growth, and bears paler flowers;  while C. CHINENSIS, which is not hardy, has large, rosy-pink flowers.    C. SILIQUASTRUM.--Judas Tree. South Europe, 1596. A small-growing tree  of some 15 feet in height, and with usually a rather ungainly and  crooked mode of growth. It is, however, one of our choicest subjects  for ornamental planting, the handsome reniform leaves and rosy-purple  flowers produced along the branches and before the leaves appear  rendering it a great favourite with planters. There are three distinct  forms of this shrub--the first, C. Siliquastrum alba, having pure white  flowers; C. Siliquastrum carnea, with beautiful deep pink flowers; and  C. Siliquastrum variegata, with neatly variegated foliage, though  rather inconstant of character. Natives of South Europe, and amongst  the oldest trees of our gardens.    They all succeed best when planted in rather damp loam, and do not  object to partial shade, the common species growing well even beneath  the drip of large standard trees.      CHIMONANTHUS.    CHIMONANTHUS FRAGRANS.--Winter Flower. Japan, 1766. This Japanese shrub  is certainly one of the most remarkable that could be brought under  notice, the deliciously fragrant flowers being produced in abundance  during the winter months, and while the plant is yet leafless. Being of  slender growth, it is best suited for planting against a wall, the  protection thus afforded being just what is wanted for the perfect  development of the pretty flowers. C. fragrans grandiflora has larger  and less fragrant flowers than the species, and is more common in  cultivation.      CHIONANTHUS.    CHIONANTHUS RETUSA.--China, 1852. This is not a very hardy species,  and, being less ornamental than the American form, is not to be  recommended for general planting.    C. VIRGINICA.--Fringe Tree. North America, 1736. A very ornamental,  small-growing tree, with large deciduous leaves and pendent clusters of  pure white flowers with long fringe-like petals, and from which the  popular name has arisen. It is a charming tree, or rather shrub, in  this country, for one rarely sees it more than 10 feet high, and one  that, to do it justice, must have a cool and rather damp soil and a  somewhat shady situation.      CHOISYA.    CHOISYA TERNATA.--Mexican Orange Flower. Mexico, 1825. A beautiful and  distinct shrub that succeeds well in the south and west of England. The  evergreen leaves are always fresh and beautiful, and of a dark shining  green, while the sweetly-fragrant flowers are produced freely on the  apices of last year's wood. They have a singular resemblance to those  of the orange, and on the Continent are commonly grown as a substitute  for that popular flower. The plant succeeds well in any light, rich  soil, and soon grows into a goodly-sized shrub of 4 feet or 5 feet in  height. As a wall plant it succeeds well, but in warm, maritime  situations it may be planted as a standard without fear of harm.  Cuttings root freely if placed in slight heat.      CISTUS.    CISTUS CRISPUS.--Portugal, 1656. This is a distinct species, with  curled leaves, and large reddish-purple flowers. It is a valuable  ornamental shrub, but, like the others, suffers from the effects of  frost.    C. LADANIFERUS.--Gum Cistus. Spain, 1629. A pretty but rather tender  shrub, growing in favourable situations to about 4 feet in height. It  has lanceolate leaves that are glutinous above, and thickly covered  with a whitish tomentum on the under sides, and large and showy vhite  flowers with a conspicuous purple blotch at the base of each petal.  Unless in southern and western England, but particularly on the  sea-coast, this handsome Portuguese shrub is not to be depended on, in  so far as hardihood is concerned.    C. LAURIFOLIUS.--Laurel-leaved Cistus. Spain, 1731. This is the  hardiest species in cultivation, but, like the latter, is favourable to  the milder parts of these islands, and especially maritime districts.  Frequently it rises to 7 feet in height, and is then an object of great  beauty, the large yellowish-white flowers showing well above the deep  green Laurel-like leaves.    C. MONSPELIENSIS (South of Europe, 1656), and its variety C.  monspeliensis florentinus, the former with white, and the latter with  white and yellow flowers, are fairly hardy in the milder parts of  Britain, but cannot be recommended for general planting.    C. PURPUREUS.--Purple-flowered Cistas. In this species, which may rank  next to the latter in point of hardihood, the flowers are of a deep  reddish-purple, and with a darker blotch at the base of each petal.    C. SALVIFOLIUS is of loose and rather untidy growth, with rugose leaves  and white flowers. It is very variable in character, and the form  generally cultivated grows about 4 feet high, and has ovate-lanceolate,  almost glabrous leaves.    Other species that are occasionally to be found in collections are C.  creticus, with yellow and purple flowers; C. hirsutus, white with  yellow blotches at the base of the petals; and C. Clusii, with very  large pure-white flowers. All the species of Gum Cistus, or Rock Rose  as they are very appropriately named, will be found to succeed best  when planted in exalted positions, and among light, though rich, strong  soil. They are easy of propagation.      CITRUS.    CITRUS TRIFOLIATA.--Japan, 1869. This is a singular low-growing shrub,  with ternate leaves, spiny branches, and fragrant white flowers. It is  hardy in many English situations, but does not fruit freely, although  the orange-blossom-like flowers are produced very abundantly. A pretty  little glossy-leaved shrub that is well worthy of attention,  particularly where a cosy corner can be put aside for its cultivation.      CLADRASTIS.    CLADRASTIS AMURENSIS.--Amoor Yellow Wood. Amur, 1880. This is a shrub  that is sure to be extensively cultivated when better known, and more  readily procured. It has stood uninjured for several years in various  parts of England, so that its hardihood may be taken for granted. The  pretty olive-green of the bark, and the greyish-green of the leathery  leaves, render the shrub one of interest even in a flowerless state. In  July and August the dense spikes of white, or rather yellowish-white  flowers are produced freely, and that, too, even before the shrub has  attained to a height of 2 feet. It is well worthy of extended culture.    C. TINCTORIA (_syn C. lutea_ and _Virgilia lutea_).--Yellow Wood. North  America, 1812. This is a handsome deciduous tree that does well in many  parts of the country, and is valued for the rich profusion of white  flowers produced, and which are well set-off by the finely-cut pinnate  leaves. It is a valuable tree for park and lawn planting, requiring a  warm, dry soil, and sunny situation--conditions under which the wood  becomes well-ripened, and the flowers more freely produced.      CLEMATIS.    CLEMATIS ALPINA (_syn Atragene alpina, A. austriaca_ and _A.  siberica_).--Europe and North America. This is a climbing species with  bi-ternately divided leaves, and large flowers with four blue sepals  and ten to twelve small flattened organs, which are usually termed  petals.    C. CIRRHOSA.--Evergreen Virgin's Bower. Spain, 1596. An interesting,  early-flowering species. The flowers, which are greenish-white, are  produced in bunches and very effective. It is an evergreen species, of  comparative hardihood, and flowers well in sheltered situations.    C. FLAMMULA.--Virgin's Bower. France, 1596. This old and well-known  plant is quite hardy in this country. The leaves are pinnate, and the  flowers white and fragrant. C. Flammula rubro-marginata is a worthy and  beautiful-leaved variety.    C. FLORIDA.--Japan, 1776. This is a beautiful species, and an old  inhabitant of English gardens. Leaves composed of usually three  oval-shaped leaflets, and unusually bright of tint. The flowers are  very large, and pure white. It should be planted in a warm sheltered  corner against a wall.    C. GRAVEOLENS.--This is a dwarf shrub, with neatly tripinnate leaves,  and solitary, strongly-scented yellow flowers of medium size. A native  of Chinese Tartary, and quite hardy.    C. LANUGINOSA.--China, 1851. A handsome species, with large purple  leaves that are hairy on the under sides. Flowers pale blue or lilac,  very large, and composed of six or eight spreading sepals. C.  lanuginosa pallida has immense flowers, often fully half a foot in  diameter. Flowers in June.    C. MONTANA.--Nepaul, 1831. This is valuable on account of its flowering  in May. It is a free-growing species, with trifoliolate leaves on long  footstalks, and large white flowers. C. montana grandiflora is a  beautiful variety, having large white flowers so abundantly produced as  to hide the foliage. It is quite hardy and of rampant growth.    C. PATENS (_syns C. caerulea_ and _C. azurea grandiflora_).--Japan,  1836. This has large, pale-violet flowers, and is the parent of many  single and double flowered forms. The typical form is, however, very  deserving of cultivation, on account of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10885"],[0,"Stories from the Italian Poets: with Lives of the Writers, Volume 1 (#6)"],[1,"resume, by the monks) to their common friend, the Ghibelline  chieftain--a commission, which, knowing the prior's intimacy with that  personage, appears to have been the main object of his coming to the  place[17].    This letter has been adduced as an evidence of Dante's poem having  transpired during his lifetime: a thing which, in the teeth of  Boccaccio's statement to that effect, and indeed the poet's own  testimony[18], Foscolo holds to be so impossible, that he turns the  evidence against the letter. He thinks, that if such bitter invectives  had been circulated, a hundred daggers would have been sheathed in the  bosom of the exasperating poet[19]. But I cannot help being of opinion,  with some writer whom I am unable at present to call to mind (Schlegel,  I think), that the strong critical reaction of modern times in favour  of Dante's genius has tended to exaggerate the idea conceived of him in  relation to his own. That he was of importance, and bitterly hated in  his native city, was a distinction he shared with other partisans who  have obtained no celebrity, though his poetry, no doubt, must have  increased the bitterness; that his genius also became more and more felt  out of the city, by the few individuals capable of estimating a man of  letters in those semi-barbarous times, may be regarded as certain; but  that busy politicians in general, war-making statesmen, and princes  constantly occupied in fighting for their existence with one another,  were at all alive either to his merits or his invectives, or would have  regarded him as anything but a poor wandering scholar, solacing his  foolish interference in the politics of this world with the old clerical  threats against his enemies in another, will hardly, I think, be doubted  by any one who reflects on the difference between a fame accumulated by  ages, and the living poverty that is obliged to seek its bread. A writer  on a monkish subject may have acquired fame with monks, and even with  a few distinguished persons, and yet have been little known, and less  cared for, out of the pale of that very private literary public, which  was almost exclusively their own. When we read, now-a-days, of the great  poet's being so politely received by Can Grande, lord of Verona, and  sitting at his princely table, we are apt to fancy that nothing but  his great poetry procured him the reception, and that nobody present  competed with him in the eyes of his host. But, to say nothing of the  different kinds of retainers that could sit at a prince's table in those  days, Can, who was more ostentatious than delicate in his munificence,  kept a sort of caravansera for clever exiles, whom he distributed into  lodgings classified according to their pursuits;[20] and Dante only  shared his bounty with the rest, till the more delicate poet could no  longer endure either the buffoonery of his companions, or the amusement  derived from it by the master. On one occasion, his platter is slily  heaped with their bones, which provokes him to call them dogs, as having  none to shew for their own. Another time, Can Grande asks him how it is  that his companions give more pleasure at court than himself; to which  he answers, \"Because like loves like.\" He then leaves the court, and his  disgusted superiority is no doubt regarded as a pedantic assumption.    He stopped long nowhere, except with Guido Novello; and when that  prince, whose downfal was at hand, sent him on the journey above  mentioned to Venice, the senate (whom the poet had never offended) were  so little aware of his being of consequence, that they declined giving  him an audience. He went back, and broke his heart. Boccaccio says, that  he would get into such passions with the very boys and girls in the  street, who plagued him with party-words, as to throw stones at them--a  thing that would be incredible, if persons acquainted with his great but  ultra-sensitive nation did not know what Italians could do in all ages,  from Dante's own age down to the times of Alfieri and Foscolo. It  would be as difficult, from the evidence of his own works and of the  exasperation he created, to doubt the extremest reports of his irascible  temper, as it would be not to give implicit faith to his honesty. The  charge of peculation which his enemies brought against this great poet,  the world has universally scouted with an indignation that does it  honour. He himself seems never to have condescended to allude to it;  and a biographer would feel bound to copy his silence, had not the  accusation been so atrociously recorded. But, on the other hand, who  can believe that a man so capable of doing his fellow-citizens good and  honour, would have experienced such excessive enmity, had he not carried  to excess the provocations of his pride and scorn? His whole history  goes to prove it, not omitting the confession he makes of pride as his  chief sin, and the eulogies he bestows on the favourite vice of the  age--revenge. His Christianity (at least as shewn in his poem) was not  that of Christ, but of a furious polemic. His motives for changing his  party, though probably of a mixed nature, like those of most human  beings, may reasonably be supposed to have originated in something  better than interest or indignation. He had most likely not agreed  thoroughly with any party, and had become hopeless of seeing dispute  brought to an end, except by the representative of the Caesars. The  inconsistency of the personal characters of the popes with the sacred  claims of the chair of St. Peter, was also calculated greatly to disgust  him; but still his own infirmities of pride and vindictiveness  spoiled all; and when he loaded every body else with reproach for the  misfortunes of his country, he should have recollected that, had his own  faults been kept in subjection to his understanding, he might possibly  have been its saviour. Dante's modesty has been asserted on the ground  of his humbling himself to the fame of Virgil, and at the feet of  blessed spirits; but this kind of exalted humility does not repay a  man's fellow-citizens for lording it over them with scorn and derision.  We learn from Boccaccio, that when he was asked to go ambassador  from his party to the pope, he put to them the following useless and  mortifying queries--\"If I go, who is to stay?--and if I stay, who is to  go?\" [21] Neither did his pride make him tolerant of pride in others.  A neighbour applying for his intercession with a magistrate, who had  summoned him for some offence, Dante, who disliked the man for riding in  an overbearing manner along the streets (stretching out his legs as wide  as he could, and hindering people from going by), did intercede with the  magistrate, but it was in behalf of doubling the fine in consideration  of the horsemanship. The neighbour, who was a man of family, was so  exasperated, that Sacchetti the novelist says it was the principal cause  of Dante's expatriation. This will be considered the less improbable,  if, as some suppose, the delinquent obtained possession of his derider's  confiscated property; but, at all events, nothing is more likely to  have injured him. The bitterest animosities are generally of a personal  nature; and bitter indeed must have been those which condemned a man of  official dignity and of genius to such a penalty as the stake.[22]    That the Florentines of old, like other half-Christianised people, were  capable of any extremity against an opponent, burning included, was  proved by the fates of Savonarola and others; and that Dante himself  could admire the burners is evident from his eulogies and beatification  of such men as Folco and St. Dominic. The tragical as well as \"fantastic  tricks\" which      \"Man, proud man,    Drest in a little brief authority,\"    plays with his energy and bad passions under the guise of duty, is among  the most perplexing of those spectacles, which, according to a greater  understanding than Dante's, \"make the angels weep.\" (Dante, by the way,  has introduced in his heaven no such angels as those; though he has  plenty that scorn and denounce.) Lope de Vega, though a poet, was an  officer of the Inquisition, and joined the famous Armada that was coming  to thumb-screw and roast us into his views of Christian meekness.  Whether the author of the story of _Paulo and Francesca_ could have  carried the Dominican theories into practice, had he been the banisher  instead of the banished, is a point that may happily be doubted; but at  all events he revenged himself on his enemies after their own fashion;  for he answered their decree of the stake by putting them into hell.    Dante entitled the saddest poem in the world a Comedy, because it was  written in a middle style; though some, by a strange confusion of ideas,  think the reason must have been because it \"ended happily!\" that is,  because, beginning with hell (to some), it terminated with \"heaven\" (to  others). As well might they have said, that a morning's work in the  Inquisition ended happily, because, while people were being racked in  the dungeons, the officers were making merry in the drawing-room. For  the much-injured epithet of \"Divine,\" Dante's memory is not responsible.  He entitled his poem, arrogantly enough, yet still not with that impiety  of arrogance, \"The Comedy of Dante Alighieri, a Florentine by nation but  not by habits.\" The word \"divine\" was added by some transcriber; and it  heaped absurdity on absurdity, too much of it, alas! being literally  infernal tragedy. I am not speaking in mockery, any further than the  fact itself cannot help so speaking. I respect what is to be respected  in Dante; I admire in him what is admirable; would love (if his  infernalities would let me) what is loveable; but this must not hinder  one of the human race from protesting against what is erroneous in his  fame, when it jars against every best feeling, human and divine. Mr.  Cary thinks that Dante "]]]
