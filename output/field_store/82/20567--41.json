He believes he was 'converted on the spot in that prayer  meeting.'\"      LIFE BROUGHT BACK AGAIN IN THE MIDST OF DEATH.      The following instance, when _death itself was made to give back the  life it claimed_, is personally known to us to be true: A mother, in  this city, sent a request for prayer to the Fulton street  prayer-meeting, asking the Lord for the recovery of her daughter, who  was sinking rapidly, and who she felt was almost dying.    Her husband, an eminent physician, and others, also, the most skilled  physicians of the city, gave up the case as hopeless. The mother felt  that now none but God could or would help; that in the Fulton street  prayer-meeting were sympathizing friends, and to it sent her request.  She came to the meeting herself, to join in their prayers and testify  her faith. The moments of the meeting passed on. One request after  another was read, but hers was not touched. She was sadly disappointed.  Her child was so weak and almost dying, it could not live the day  through, perhaps. The time was within a few minutes, less than three, of  the close of the meeting. She, at last, with faltering steps and  palpitating heart, pressed her way to the desk and asked if her request  was there. Upon search, it was found that it had been overlooked. _Too  late_, said the leader, to _read it to-day_. See, the clock is at its  last moment; but it shall be read first thing at 12 o'clock, to-morrow,  and special prayer shall be offered immediately.    With what heavy heart the mother went away, back to the chamber of the  dying one, none can ever know. All night the waiting ones watched, with  their ceaseless attentions and silent prayers.    _A few minutes before_ 12 _o'clock the body sank, the eyes closed,  pallor came over the features, the spirit seemed gone_, and _all was  still; not a breath, not a motion--death had come_.    The mother had taken her watch, hung it on the pillow of the bed, and  with streaming eyes, yet ceaseless prayer, they watched the slow finger  move to 12 o'clock. At precisely twelve, all joined in prayer, lifting  their hearts to God. _At fifteen minutes past twelve, the daughter  opened her eyes_, saying, \"Mother, _I feel better_,\" then sank into  sleep, _breathing steadily_; after three hours awoke to consciousness  and sat up in bed, and before night was able to walk the floor of her  chamber. Prayer brought that life back, even when death had taken it.  _At the very moment when that precious prayer was offered in the  meeting, the Lord came and touched the dying one, and gave it new life._  The mother's faith and prayer was honored, and the Lord remembered his  promise, \"_If ye believe, ye shall see the glory of God.\"_ The same Lord  who raised Lazarus and bade him come forth, also came and bade this  precious life come back again to earth.      SAVED FROM THE HANDS OF A DESPERADO.      The following circumstance is communicated to us by a United States  Surgeon:    \"After the close of the Mexican war, and in the year 1849, a train was  sent out from San Antonio to establish military posts on the upper Rio  Grande, particularly at El Paso. I was surgeon of the quartermaster's  department, numbering about four hundred men. While the train was making  up, the cholera prevailed in camp, for about six weeks, at first with  terrible severity. On the 1st of June it had so far subsided that we  took up the line of march. After about four days out from San Antonio,  the health of the men became very good, and continued so through the  whole route, with the exception of occasional cases of prostration from  heat, and slight fevers, the Summer being unusually hot. One evening in  July, after coming into camp, I received a call to see a man who had  been taken sick on the march. I found him lying under his wagon. The  wagon was loaded with bacon, in bulk about two tons. The heat with the  pressure had caused it to drip freely. I asked him to come from under  the wagon, that I might examine his case and prescribe, for him. This he  refused to do; but demanded that I should crawl under the wagon to him,  which I, of course, would not consent to do. No persuasion could induce  him to change his position in the least. Becoming satisfied that he was  not much, if at all sick, I left him. His profanity, threats and  imprecations were fearful. Perhaps it would be well to give a short  sketch of his life for the three years previous, as I learned it from  men who knew him, and had been with him for considerable portion of that  period. He went to Mexico, at the beginning of the war, a soldier in the  regular army. When his term of service expired, he was discharged, and  sought employment in the quartermaster's department, as a teamster. He  had the reputation of being a thief, a robber and an assassin. In a few  months he was ignominiously discharged from the service, and, at the  close of the war, he came to Texas, and sought and obtained employment  as teamster in the train then organizing for El Paso. But, to return to  my narrative. On the morning after the occurrence at the wagon, a  teamster came to me and said, in a hasty and abrupt manner, 'Doctor, Mc  will kill you to-day or to-night. He is full of rage, and muttering  terrible threats. He was out very early this morning and emptied his  six-shooter, and came in and reloaded it and put it in first-rate  order.' I said, 'Mc, what's up now?' He replied, 'I will kill that  d----d old doctor to-day or to-night;' and he will do it. I have known  him make threats before, and have never known him fail to execute them.  But I must go; he must not know that I have seen you.' Knowing the man,  I realized the danger, and felt that I was powerless, either to resist  or avoid it. I retired within my tent and closed it up. I prostrated  myself before Him who is able to save. I prayed for deliverance from the  hands of the cruel and blood-thirsty man, and that I might not be left  in the power of him who was my enemy without cause. I submitted my cause  into the hands of Him who doeth all things well, and prayed for entire  submission to his will. My anxiety subsided; my fear was removed, and I  commenced the duties of the day with usual cheerfulness.    \"Soon after this, the camp broke and we were on the march. I fell back  with the officers of the rear guard, and the excitement of the morning  was soon forgotten. About 10 o'clock, a courier came back in haste, for  me to see a man who had been thrown from his mule and crushed under the  wheels of his wagon. He did not know who the man was--he was about half  or three-quarters of a mile ahead. The thought then occurred to me, I  shall probably have to pass Mc's team. I will ride square up with the  courier, and keep him between myself and the train. When we came to the  spot I inquired who the man was, for he was so mutilated I could not  recognize him. _It was Mc. God was there_. Awe and terror took hold upon  me. I was dumb with amazement.    \"Mc had dismounted and walked some fifty rods by the side of his team.  Attempting to remount, his mule whirled and pitched, and he was thrown  upon his back, and his team with fourteen others instantly stampeded.  Both the fore and hind wheels on the near side of his wagon, passed  directly over his face, and crushed every bone in his head. It was a  fearful sight; not a feature of the human face could be discerned.    \"The stampeded teams were flying wildly over the prairie, in spite of  every effort of the teamsters to control them.    \"I directed the head of the corpse to be inserted in some new, thick  sacks, in such a way as to prevent the oozing of blood, and that it be  wrapped in his blanket and taken to the next camp for burial. When the  stampeded teams came in, it was found that no other person was injured,  nor any damage done.    \"The philosopher may tell us of the reign of law; of the coincidence of  circumstances; of the action of natural causes; but, to the Christian,  the fact still remains--prayer was answered. God heareth his people when  they cry unto Him.\"      THE PRAYER OF A MISSIONARY IN MEXICO ANSWERED.--SAVED FROM BANDITTI.      \"In the Spring of 1872, I was, with my wife and child, in the city of  Cadereita, Mexico, where we had been laboring as missionaries, but felt  it was our duty to return to the States for a little season, and had  been asking God to open up the way for us. At length, about the middle  of March, the opportunity appeared to be given, the means being  provided; but the country was in a state of revolution (a no uncommon  thing there), and, consequently, there were no stages running out of the  country, so we had to take conveyance in Mexican carts. Therefore, we  engaged two men, with their carts; one in which we might ride and carry  a mattress, which should serve as a bed at night, and the other, to  carry the baggage and provisions for ourselves and the horses, as our  way was mostly through an uncultivated country.    \"We knew that General Cortinas, with his troops, was somewhere between  us and Texas, as the State we were in was one of those in rebellion. The  blood-thirsty character of General Cortinas is well known on the  frontier, there being no less than seventeen indictments against him for  murder in the State of Texas.

But the Kaiser does not regard the Czar as the captain of  Christianity. Far from it. What he supported in Stolypin was the necktie  and nothing but the necktie: the gallows and not the cross. The Russian  ruler did believe that the Orthodox Church was orthodox. The Austrian  Archduke did really desire to make the Catholic Church catholic. He did  really believe that he was being Pro-Catholic in being Pro-Austrian. But  the Kaiser cannot be Pro-Catholic, and therefore cannot have been really  Pro-Austrian, he was simply and solely Anti-Servian. Nay, even in the cruel  and sterile strength of Turkey, anyone with imagination can see something  of the tragedy and therefore of the tenderness of true belief. The worst  that can be said of the Moslems is, as the poet put it, they offered to  man the choice of the Koran or the sword. The best that can be said for  the German is that he does not care about the Koran, but is satisfied if  he can have the sword. And for me, I confess, even the sins of these three  other striving empires take on, in comparison, something that is sorrowful  and dignified: and I feel they do not deserve that this little Lutheran  lounger should patronise all that is evil in them, while ignoring all that  is good. He is not Catholic, he is not Orthodox, he is not Mahomedan. He  is merely an old gentleman who wishes to share the crime though he cannot  share the creed. He desires to be a persecutor by the pang without the  palm. So strongly do all the instincts of the Prussian drive against  liberty, that he would rather oppress other people's subjects than think  of anybody going without the benefits of oppression. He is a sort of  disinterested despot. He is as disinterested as the devil who is ready to  do anyone's dirty work.    This would seem obviously fantastic were it not supported by solid facts  which cannot be explained otherwise. Indeed it would be inconceivable  if we were thinking of a whole people, consisting of free and varied  individuals. But in Prussia the governing class is really a governing  class: and a very few people are needed to think along these lines to make  all the other people act along them. And the paradox of Prussia is this:  that while its princes and nobles have no other aim on this earth but to  destroy democracy wherever it shows itself, they have contrived to get  themselves trusted, not as wardens of the past but as forerunners of the  future. Even they cannot believe that their theory is popular, but they  do believe that it is progressive. Here again we find the spiritual chasm  between the two monarchies in question. The Russian institutions are, in  many cases, really left in the rear of the Russian people, and many of the  Russian people know it. But the Prussian institutions are supposed to be  in advance of the Prussian people, and most of the Prussian people believe  it. It is thus much easier for the war-lords to go everywhere and impose  a hopeless slavery upon everyone, for they have already imposed a sort of  hopeful slavery on their own simple race.    And when men shall speak to us of the hoary iniquities of Russia and of  how antiquated is the Russian system, we shall answer \"Yes; that is the  superiority of Russia.\" Their institutions are part of their history,  whether as relics or fossils. Their abuses have really been uses: that  is to say, they have been used up. If they have old engines of terror  or torment, they may fall to pieces from mere rust, like an old coat of  armour. But in the case of the Prussian tyranny, if it be tyranny at all,  it is the whole point of its claim that it is not antiquated, but just  going to begin, like the showman. Prussia has a whole thriving factory of  thumbscrews, a whole humming workshop of wheels and racks, of the newest  and neatest pattern, with which to win back Europe to the Reaction ...  _infandum renovare dolorem_ And if we wish to test the truth of this, it  can be done by the same method which showed us that Russia, if her race or  religion could sometimes make her an invader and an oppressor, could also  be made an emancipator and a knight errant. In the same way, if the Russian  institutions are old-fashioned, they honestly exhibit the good as well as  the bad that can be found in old-fashioned things.    In their police system they have an inequality which is against our ideas  of law. But in their commune system they have an equality that is older  than law itself. Even when they flogged each other like barbarians, they  called upon each other by their Christian names like children. At their  worst they retained all the best of a rude society. At their best, they  are simply good, like good children or good nuns. But in Prussia, all that  is best in the civilised machinery is put at the service of all that is  worst in the barbaric mind. Here again the Prussian has no accidental  merits, none of those lucky survivals, none of those late repentances,  which make the patchwork glory of Russia. Here all is sharpened to a point  and pointed to a purpose, and that purpose, if words and acts have any  meaning at all, is the destruction of liberty throughout the world.          IV    THE ESCAPE OF FOLLY      In considering the Prussian point of view, we have been considering what  seems to be mainly a mental limitation: a kind of knot in the brain.  Towards the problem of Slav population, of English colonisation, of French  armies and reinforcements, it shows the same strange philosophic sulks.  So far as I can follow it, it seems to amount to saying \"It is very wrong  that you should be superior to me, because I am superior to you.\" The  spokesmen of this system seem to have a curious capacity for concentrating  this entanglement or contradiction, sometimes into a single paragraph, or  even a single sentence. I have already referred to the German Emperor's  celebrated suggestion that in order to avert the peril of Hunnishness we  should all become Huns. A much stronger instance is his more recent order  to his troops touching the war in Northern France. As most people know,  his words ran \"It is my Royal and Imperial command that you concentrate  your energies, for the immediate present, upon one single purpose, and that  is that you address all your skill and all the valour of my soldiers to  exterminate first the treacherous English and to walk over General French's  contemptible little army.\" The rudeness of the remark an Englishman can  afford to pass over; what I am interested in is the mentality, the train  of thought that can manage to entangle itself even in so brief a space.  If French's little Army is contemptible, it would seem clear that all the  skill and valour of the German Army had better not be concentrated on it,  but on the larger and less contemptible allies. If all the skill and valour  of the German Army are concentrated on it, it is not being treated as  contemptible. But the Prussian rhetorician had two incompatible sentiments  in his mind; and he insisted on saying them both at once. He wanted to  think of an English Army as a small thing; but he also wanted to think of  an English defeat as a big thing. He wanted to exult, at the same moment,  in the utter weakness of the British in their attack; and the supreme  skill and valour of the Germans in repelling such an attack. Somehow  it must be made a common and obvious collapse for England; and yet a  daring and unexpected triumph for Germany. In trying to express these  contradictory conceptions simultaneously, he got rather mixed. Therefore  he bade Germania fill all her vales and mountains with the dying agonies of  this almost invisible earwig; and let the impure blood of this cockroach  redden the Rhine down to the sea.    But it would be unfair to base the criticism on the utterance of any  accidental and hereditary prince: and it is quite equally clear in the  case of the philosophers who have been held up to us, even in England, as  the very prophets of progress. And in nothing is it shown more sharply  than in the curious confused talk about Race and especially about the  Teutonic Race. Professor Harnack and similar people are reproaching us,  I understand, for having broken \"the bond of Teutonism\": a bond which the  Prussians have strictly observed both in breach and observance. We note  it in their open annexation of lands wholly inhabited by negroes, such as  Denmark. We note it equally in their instant and joyful recognition of  the flaxen hair and light blue eyes of the Turks. But it is still the  abstract principle of Professor Harnack which interests me most; and in  following it I have the same complexity of inquiry, but the same simplicity  of result. Comparing the Professor's concern about \"Teutonism\" with his  unconcern about Belgium, I can only reach the following result: \"A man  need not keep a promise he has made. But a man must keep a promise he has  not made.\" There certainly was a treaty binding Britain to Belgium; if  it was only a scrap of paper. If there was any treaty binding Britain to  Teutonism it is, to say the least of it, a lost scrap of paper; almost  what one would call a scrap of waste-paper. Here again the pedants under  consideration exhibit the illogical perversity that makes the brain reel.  There is obligation and there is no obligation: sometimes it appears that  Germany and England must keep faith with each other; sometimes that Germany  need not keep faith with anybody and anything; sometimes that we alone  among European peoples are almost entitled to be Germans; sometimes that  besides us, Russians and Frenchmen almost rise to a Germanic loveliness of  character. But through all there is, hazy but not hypocritical, this sense  of some common Teutonism.    Professor Haeckel, another of the witnesses"]]]
