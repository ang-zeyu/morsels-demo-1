The manufacture of charcoal in kilns was declared many years ago, after  a series of experiments made in poorly constructed furnaces, to be  unprofitable, and the subject is dismissed by most writers with the  remark, that in order to use the method economically the products of  distillation, both liquid and gaseous, must be collected. T. Egleston,  Ph.D., of the School of Mines, New York, has read a paper on the subject  before the American Institute of Mining Engineers, from which we extract  as follows: As there are many SILVER DISTRICTS IN THE WEST where coke  cannot be had at such a price as will allow of its being used, and where  the ores are of such a nature that wood cannot be used in a  reverberatory furnace, the most economical method of making charcoal is  an important question.    Kilns for the manufacture of charcoal are made of almost any shape and  size, determined in most cases by the fancy of the builder or by the  necessities of the shape of the ground selected. They do not differ from  each other in any principle of manufacture, nor does there seem to be  any appreciable difference in the quality of the fuel they produce, when  the process is conducted with equal care in the different varieties; but  there is a considerable difference in the yield and in the cost of the  process in favor of small over large kilns. The different varieties have  come into and gone out of use mainly on account of the cost of  construction and of repairs. The object of a kiln is to replace the  cover of a meiler by a permanent structure. Intermediate between the  meiler and the kiln is the Foucauld system, the object of which is to  replace the cover by a structure more or less permanent, which has all  the disadvantages of both systems, with no advantages peculiar to  itself.    The kilns which are used may be divided into the rectangular, the round,  and the conical, but the first two seem to be disappearing before the  last, which is as readily built and much more easily managed.      ALL VARIETIES OF KILNS    Are usually built of red brick, or, rarely, of brick and stone together.  Occasionally, refractory brick is used, but it is not necessary. The  foundations are usually made of stone. There are several precautions  necessary in constructing the walls. The brick should be sufficiently  hard to resist the fire, and should therefore be tested before using. It  is an unnecessary expense to use either second or third quality  fire-brick. As the pyroligneous acid which results from the distillation  of the wood attacks lime mortar, it is best to lay up the brick with  fire-clay mortar, to which a little salt has been added; sometimes loam  mixed with coal-tar, to which a little salt is also added, is used. As  the principal office of this mortar is to fill the joints, special care  must be taken in laying the bricks that every joint is broken, and  frequent headers put in to tie the bricks together. It is especially  necessary that all the joints should be carefully filled, as any small  open spaces would admit air, and would materially decrease the yield of  the kiln. The floor of the kiln was formerly made of two rows of brick  set edgewise and carefully laid, but latterly it is found to be best  made of clay. Any material, however, that will pack hard may be used. It  must be well beaten down with paving mauls. The center must be about six  inches higher than the sides, which are brought up to the bottom of the  lower vents. Most kilns are carefully pointed, and are then painted on  the outside with a wash of clay suspended in water, and covered with a  coating of coal-tar, which makes them waterproof, and does not require  to be renewed for several years.    [Illustration: RECTANGULAR KILNS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF CHARCOAL.]    The kilns were formerly roofed over with rough boards to protect the  masonry from the weather, but as no special advantage was found to  result from so doing, since of late years they have been made  water-proof, the practice has been discontinued.    The wood used is cut about one and a fifth meters long. The diameter is  not considered of much importance, except in so far as it is desirable  to have it as nearly uniform as possible. When most of the wood is  small, and only a small part of it is large, the large pieces are  usually split, to make it pack well. It has been found most satisfactory  to have three rows of vents around the kiln, which should be provided  with a cast-iron frame reaching to the inside of the furnace. The vents  near the ground are generally five inches high--the size of two  bricks--and four inches wide--the width of one--and the holes are closed  by inserting one or two bricks in them. They are usually the size of one  brick, and larger on the outside than on the inside. These holes are  usually from 0.45 m. to 0.60 m. apart vertically, and from 0.80 m. to  0.90 m. apart horizontally. The lower vents start on the second row of  the brickwork above the foundation, and are placed on the level with the  floor, so that the fire can draw to the bottom. There is sometimes an  additional opening near the top to allow of the rapid escape of the  smoke and gas at the time of firing, which is then closed, and kept  closed until the kiln is discharged. This applies mostly to the best  types of conical kilns. In the circular and conical ones the top  charging door is sometimes used for this purpose. Hard and soft woods  are burned indifferently in the kilns. Hard-wood coal weighs more than  soft, and the hard variety of charcoal is usually preferred for blast  furnaces, and for such purposes there is an advantage of fully 33-1/3  per cent. or even more in using hard woods. For the direct process in  the bloomaries, soft-wood charcoal is preferred. It is found that it is  not usually advantageous to build kilns of over 160 to 180 cubic meters  in capacity. Larger furnaces have been used, and give as good a yield,  but they are much more cumbersome to manage. The largest yield got from  kilns is from 50 to 60 bushels for hard wood to 50 for soft wood. The  average yield, however, is about 45 bushels. In meilers, two and a half  to three cords of wood are required for 100 bushels, or 30 to 40 bushels  to the cord. The kiln charcoal is very large, so that the loss in fine  coal is very much diminished. The pieces usually come out the whole  size, and sometimes the whole length of the wood.    The rectangular kilns were those which were formerly exclusively in use.  They are generally built to contain from 30 to 90 cords of wood. The  usual sizes are given in the table below:                                  1   2   3   4    Length                     50  40  40  48    Width                      12  15  14  17    Height                     12  15  18  18    Capacity, in cords         55  70  75  90    1 and 2. Used in New England. 3. Type of those used in Mexico. 4. Kiln  at Lauton, Mich.    The arch is usually an arc of a circle. A kiln of the size of No. 4, as  constructed at the Michigan Central Iron Works, with a good burn, will  yield 4,000 bushels of charcoal.    The vertical walls in the best constructions are 12 to 13 feet high, and  1-1/2 brick thick, containing from 20 to 52 bricks to the cubic foot of  wall. To insure sufficient strength to resist the expansion and  contraction due to the heating and cooling, they should be provided with  buttresses which are 1 brick thick and 2 wide, as at Wassaic, New York;  but many of them are built without them, as at Lauton, Michigan, as  shown in the engraving. In both cases they are supported with strong  braces, from 3 to 4 feet apart, made of round or hewn wood, or of cast  iron, which are buried in the ground below, and are tied above and below  with iron rods, as in the engraving, and the lower end passing beneath  the floor of the kiln. When made of wood they are usually 8 inches  square or round, or sometimes by 8 inches placed edgewise. They are  sometimes tied at the top with wooden braces of the same size, which are  securely fastened by iron rods running through the corners, as shown.  When a number of kilns are built together, as at the Michigan Central  Iron Works, at Lauton, Michigan, shown in the plan view, only the end  kilns are braced in this way. The intermediate ones are supported below  by wooden braces, securely fastened at the bottom. The roof is always  arched, is one brick, or eight inches, thick, and is laid in headers,  fourteen being used in each superficial foot. Many of the kilns have in  the center a round hole, from sixteen to eighteen inches in diameter,  which is closed by a cast iron plate. It requires from 35 M. to 40 M.  brick for a kiln of 45 cords, and 60 M. to 65 M. for one of 90 cords.           *       *       *       *       *    The belief that population in the West Indies is stationary is so far  from accurate that, as Sir Anthony Musgrave points out, it is increasing  more rapidly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11348"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 13, No. 368, May 2, (#6)"],[1,"the points, the highest seen and measured by  him, was about three thousand feet high, The average height is stated  to be from twelve hundred to fifteen hundred feet. The base is  granite; the sides, in many parts, naked; and the soil supports but  little vegetation, except the Stringy-bark and some hardy plants.    Captain Stirling observes, that coal was not found, because it was not  particularly sought for; but he is of opinion that the general  character of the country is such as to warrant the belief that it  might be found; \"for,\" he observes, \"all the concomitant strata or  members of the coal formation are exposed on different parts of the  surface, below which I had no opportunity to explore. Indeed, the  carboniferous order of locks is that which is most frequently  exhibited throughout this territory; and I have no doubt important  results would arise from a proper examination into its mineralogical  resources.\"    With reference to a supply of fresh water, so indispensably necessary  in every settled country, the researches made by Captain Stirling and  Mr. Fraser were attended with the most satisfactory results. The  former observes, that the clouds which are impelled against the  western side of the range of mountains are condensed into rain, the  water of which is conducted across the plain to the sea, in numerous  streams, but chiefly by three principal rivers, terminating in  estuaries, or salt-water lakes. These are--the Swan River, opposite  the Island Rottenest; the Riviere Vasse, and Port Leschenault, in  Geographer's Bay. \"We found,\" says Captain Stirling, \"a great number  of creeks, or rivulets, falling into Swan River, more particularly on  the eastern side; and I am inclined to think, that the country  generally is much divided by such water-courses. Its supply of fresh  water, from springs and lagoons, is abundant; for we found such  wherever we thought it necessary to ascertain their existence. At  Point Heathcote,\" he adds, \"we met with a remarkable instance; for  there the beach of a narrow rocky promontory is a bed of springs, and  by tracing the finger along any part within four inches of the edge of  the salt water, pure and fresh water instantly occupied the trace.\"    Mr. Fraser's testimony leaves no doubt of the abundance of fresh  water. \"I was astonished,\" he says, \"at the vivid green of the  Eucalyptus, and other trees and shrubs, so distinct from those of New  South Wales; but, on digging the soil to the depth of two feet, I  found the cause to arise apparently from the immense number of springs  with which this country abounds; for, at the depth above mentioned, I  found the soil quite moist, although evidently at the latter end of an  exceedingly dry season; and from the same cause must arise the great  luxuriance of the herbaceous plants on the banks, which exceeds any  thing I ever saw on the east coast. They consist principally of the  _senecia_ and the _sonchus_, which here attain the height of nine  feet.\"    He further observes, that numerous active springs issue from the rocks  of the limestone ridge, and particularly in Geographer's Bay, the  whole coast of which, he says, \"is a perfect source of active springs,  discharging themselves on the beach in rapid rills of considerable  extent, every six or seven yards.\"    Between the two heads which form the entrance into Swan River, there  is, unfortunately, a bar, made by the continuity of the limestone  ridge. Over this bar, the depth, at low water, is but six feet, and is  therefore practicable only for boats or rafts. About a mile inside the  heads, the water deepens; and then commences a succession of cliffs,  or natural wharfs, with four, five, and six fathoms at their bases.  The same depths are extended over a magnificent expanse of salt water,  to which Captain Stirling has given the name of \"Melville Water;\" and  which, in his opinion, wants only a good entrance to make it one of  the finest harbours in the world, being seven or eight miles in  length, by three or four in width, and having a depth of water from  four to seven fathoms. This narrow entrance of the river, he thinks,  might be made navigable by ships of burthen, without difficulty or  great expense.    When the town begins to rise, and substantial buildings are required,  the blocks of stone procured by quarrying this entrance will go far  towards paying the expense of excavation.    Into this expansive sheet of water fall two rivers; one from the  north-east, which is properly the Swan River; the other from the  south-east, called Canning's River. Captain Stirling examined them both:  the former to its source, the latter beyond the point where the water  ceased to be brackish. They are both sufficiently convenient for boat  navigation, even at the end of the dry season; and any obstruction might  easily be removed to make them more so, by which the productions of an  immense extent of country might be transported by water-carriage.    Mr. Fraser remarks that nothing of the mangrove appears along the banks  of the Swan River, the usual situation of this plant being here occupied  by the genus Metrosideros. The first plain, or flat, as it is called,  contiguous to the river, commencing at Point Fraser, is formed of a rich  soil, and appears, by a deposit of wreck, to be occasionally flooded to  a certain extent. Here are several extensive salt marshes, which Mr.  Fraser thinks are admirably adapted for the growth of cotton. The hills,  though scanty of soil, are covered with an immense variety of plants;  among others, a magnificent species of Angophera occupied the usual  place of the Eucalyptus, which, however, here as on the eastern side,  generally forms the principal feature in the botany of the country,  accompanied by Mimosa, Correa, Melaleuca, Casuarina, Banksia, and  Xanthorea. The brome, or kangaroo glass, was most abundant. On a more  elevated flat, a little further up the river, the botanist observes that  the \"magnificence of the Banksia and arborescent Zamia, which was here  seen thirty feet in height, added to the immense size of the Xanthorea  near this spot, impart to the forest a character truly tropical.\" He  says that about five miles to the eastward of the river, there is an  evident change in the character of the country: extensive plains of the  richest description, consisting of an alluvial deposit, equalling in  fertility those of the banks of the River Hawkesbury in New South Wales,  and covered with the most luxuriant brome grass. The Casuarina, so  common near the limestone ridge of the coast, here disappears, and is  succeeded by a pendulous species of Metrosideros, which continues to the  source of the river.    \"From this point,\" says Mr. Fraser, \"the country resembles, in every  essential character, that of the banks of those rivers which fall to  the westward of the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, varying  alternately on each bank from hilly promontories of the finest red  loam, and covered with stupendous Angopheras, to extensive flats of  the finest description, studded with magnificent blue and water gums,  and occasional stripes of Accacias and papilionaceous shrubs,  resembling the green wattle of New South Wales.\"    The higher the river is ascended, the more extended the flats become,  and the better is the quality of the soil. Here the country is said to  resemble in character that on the banks of the Macquarrie River, west  of Wellington valley; and though marks of occasional floods appeared  on the lower plains, the upper flats had evidently never been flooded.  The sides of the mountains were bare of underwood, and their summits  covered with large masses of iron stone, among which were growing  enormous trees of Angophera, and some straggling plants of Hakea. On a  careful examination of this part of the country bordering the two  rivers from the sea-coast to the mountains, Mr. Fraser says, \"In  giving my opinion of the land seen on the banks of the Swan River, I  hesitate not in pronouncing it superior to any I ever saw in New South  Wales, east of the Blue Mountains, not only in its local character,  but in the many existing advantages which it holds out to settlers.  These advantages I consider to be,    \"First, the evident superiority of the soil.    \"Secondly, the facility with which a settler can bring his farm into a  state of immediate culture, in consequence of the open state of the  country, which allows not a greater average than two trees to an acre.    \"Thirdly, the general abundance of springs, producing water of the  best quality, and the consequent permanent humidity of the soil; two  advantages not existing on the eastern coast. And,    \"Fourthly, the advantages of water carriage to his door, and the  non-existence of impediments to land carriage.\"        [2] Published by J.
