They were much reproached, it appears, for  the rough and violent methods employed to effect their pious  purposes, and although they treat the accusation as most unjust, some  of the proceedings, of which they boast with the greatest  satisfaction, tend not a little to countenance the charge. When, for  example, they could not persuade the people to renounce their  superstitions, they used a large staff, with which they threw down  their idols and beat them to pieces; they even stole secretly into  the temples, and set them on fire. A missionary at Maopongo, having  met one of the queens, and finding her mind inaccessible to all his  instructions, determined to use sharper remedies, and seizing a  whip, began to apply it lustily to her majesty's person: the effect  he describes as most auspicious; every successful blow opened her  eyes more and more to the truth, and she at last declared herself  wholly unable to resist such forcible arguments in favour of the  catholic doctrine. She, however, hastened to the king, with loud  complaints respecting this mode of mental illumination; and the  missionaries thenceforth lost all favour with that prince and the  ladies of his court, being allowed to remain solely in dread of the  Portuguese. In only one other instance were they allowed to employ  this mode of conversion. The smith, in consequence of the skill,  strange in the eyes of a rude people, with which he manufactured  various arms and implements, was supposed to possess a measure of  superhuman power, and he had thus been encouraged to advance  pretensions to the character of a divinity, which were very generally  admitted. The missionaries appealed to the king, respecting this  impious assumption, and that prince conceiving that it interfered  with the respect due to himself, agreed to deliver into their hands  the unfortunate smith, to be converted into a mortal in any manner  they might judge efficacious. After a short and unsuccessful  argument, they had recourse to the same potent instrument of  conversion, as they had applied to the back of the queen. The son of  Vulcan, deserted in this extremity by all his votaries, still made a  firm stand for his celestial dignity, till the blood began to stream  from his back and shoulders, when he finally yielded, and renounced  all pretensions to a divine origin.    A more intimate acquaintance discovered other irregularities amongst  the natives, against which a painful struggle was to be maintained.  According to the custom of the country, and it were well if the same  custom could be introduced into some particular parts of Europe, the  two parties, previously to marriage, lived together for some time, in  order to make a trial of each other's tempers and inclinations,  before entering into the final arrangement. To this system of  probation, the natives were most obstinately attached, and the  missionaries in vain denounced it, calling upon them at once either  to marry or to separate. The young ladies were always the most  anxious to have the full benefit of this experimental process; and  the mothers, on being referred to, refused to incur any  responsibility, and expose themselves to the reproaches of their  daughters, by urging them to an abridgment of the trial, of which  they might afterwards repent. The missionaries seem to have been most  diligent in the task, as they called it, of \"reducing strayed souls  to matrimony.\" Father Benedict succeeded with no fewer than six  hundred, but he found it such \"laborious work,\" that he fell sick and  died. Another subject of deep regret, respecting the many  superstitious practices still prevalent, even among those who  exhibited some sort of Christian profession, was, that sometimes the  children, brought for baptism, were bound with magic cords, to which  the mothers, as an additional security from evil, had fastened beads,  relics, and figures of the Agnus Dei. It was a compound of paganism  and Christianity, which the priests turned away from with disgust;  but still the mothers seemed more inclined to part with the beads,  relics, and figures of the Agnus Dei, than their magic cords. The  chiefs, in like manner, while they testified no repugnance to avail  themselves of the protection promised from the wearing of crucifixes  and images of the Virgin, were unprepared to part with the enchanted  rings and other pagan amulets with which they had been accustomed to  form a panoply round their persons. In case of dangerous illness,  sorcery had been always contemplated as the main or sole remedy, and  those who rejected its use were reproached, as rather allowing their  sick relations to die, than incur the expense of a conjuror. But the  most general and pernicious application of magic was made in judicial  proceedings: when  a  charge was advanced against any individual, no  one ever thought of inquiring into the facts, or of collecting  evidence--every case was decided by preternatural tests. The  magicians prepared a beverage, which produced on the guilty person,  according to the measure of his iniquity, spasm, fainting, or death,  but left the innocent quite free from harm. It seems a sound  conclusion of the missionaries, that the draught was modified  according to the good or ill will of the magicians, or the liberality  of the supposed culprit. The trial called Bolungo, was indeed  renounced by the king, but only to substitute another, in which the  accused was made to bend over a large basin of water, when, if he  fell in, it was concluded that he was guilty. At other times, a bar  of red hot iron was passed along the leg, or the arm was thrust into  scalding water, and if the natural effect followed, the person's head  was immediately struck off. Snail shells, applied to the temples, if  they stuck, inferred guilt. When a dispute arose between man and man,  the plan was, to place shells on the heads of both, and make them  stoop, when he, from off whose head the shell first dropped, had a  verdict found against him. While we wonder at the deplorable  ignorance on which these practices were founded, we must not forget  that \"the judgments of God,\" as they were termed, employed by our  ancestors, during the middle ages, were founded on the same  unenlightened views, and were in some cases absolutely identical.    Other powers, of still higher name, held sway over the deluded minds  of the people of Congo. Some ladies of rank went about beating a  drum, with dishevelled hair, and pretended to work magical cures.  There was also a race of mighty conjurors, called Scingilli, who had  the power of giving and withdrawing rain at pleasure; and they had a  king called Ganja Chitorne, or God of the earth, to whom its first  fruits were regularly offered. This person never died, but when tired  of his sway on earth, he nominated a successor, and killed himself;  a step, doubtless, prompted by the zeal of his followers, when they  saw any danger of his reputation for immortality being compromised.  This class argued strongly in favour of their vocation, as not only  useful, but absolutely essential, since without it the earth would be  deprived of those influences, by which alone it was enabled to  minister to the wants of man. The people accordingly viewed, with the  deepest alarm, any idea of giving offence to beings, whose wrath  might be displayed in devoting the land to utter sterility.    We cannot trace any record, stating the period or the manner in which  the Portuguese and their officious missionaries were expelled from  Congo; it is, however, supposed that they at length carried their  religious innovations to such a length, as to draw down upon them the  vengeance of the people, and that some bold and decisive steps were  taken to liberate the country from its usurpers. It is, however,  certain, that Capt. Tucky, in his late expedition, did not find a  single trace of either the Portuguese or their missionaries on the  banks of the Zaire.    The traveller has ever found much greater difficulty in making  discoveries in Mahometan than in Gentoo or Pagan countries, and from  this cause the great continent of Africa is much less known to  Europeans than it was in ancient times. Until the present age, and a  very recent part of it, our knowledge of that immense portion of the  globe extended but very little way from the coast, and its  enterprises have made great advances to a knowledge of that interior  before unexplored. The design of examining on land Africa, to find  out the manners, habits, and institutions of its men, the state of  the country, its commercial capabilities in themselves, and relative  to this country, formed the African Association. From the liberal  sentiments, knowledge, and comprehensive views of that society, were  the courage and enterprise of adventurers stimulated to particular  undertakings of discovery.        CHAPTER II.    We are now arrived at the period when England, aroused by the  commercial advantages, which Portugal was deriving from her African  possessions, determined, in defiance of the pope of Rome and \"the  Lords of Guinea,\" to participate in the treasures, and to form her  own settlements on the African coast, although it must be admitted,  that one of the motives by which the English merchants were actuated,  was not founded on humanity or patriotism. The glorious and splendid  results, which had arisen from the discovery of the East and West  Indies, caused the ocean to be generally viewed as the grand theatre  where wealth and glory were to be gained. The cultivation of the West  India Islands by the labour of Europeans, was found to be a task  almost impracticable, and the attention was thence"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12668"],[0,"An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales, Volume 2 (#6)"],[1,"excursion, had the mortification of  seeing a stack, containing about eight hundred bushels of wheat, burnt to  the ground. This happened at Toongabbie, near which place the country was  every where in flames, and where, unfortunately, much wheat belonging to  government was stacked. The fire broke out about eight o'clock in the  evening; the wind was high, the night extremely dark, and the flames had  mounted to the very tops of the lofty woods which surrounded a field  called the ninety acres, in which were several stacks of wheat. The  appearance was alarming, and the noise occasioned by the high wind, and  the crackling of the flames among the trees, contributed to render the  scene truly awful.    It became necessary to make every effort to save this field and its  contents. The gaol-gang, who worked in irons, were called out, and told,  that if the wheat was saved by their exertion, their chains should be  knocked off. By providing every man with a large bush, to beat off the  fire as it approached the grain over the stubble, keeping up this  attention during the night, and the wind becoming moderate towards  morning, the fire was fortunately kept off, and the promise to the  gaol-gang was not forfeited.*    [* In the month of December 1792, two days after the wheat  had been reaped and got off the ground at Toongabbie, the whole of the  stubble was burnt, the country being then, as at this time, every where  on fire. See Vol I. Ch. XIX, viz: 'At Parramatta and Toongabbie also the  heat was extreme; the country there too was every where in flames. Mr.  Arndell was a great sufferer by it. The fire had spread to his farm; but  by the efforts of his own people and the neighbouring settlers it was got  under, and its progress supposed to be effectually checked, when an  unlucky spark from a tree, which had been on fire to the topmost branch,  flying upon the thatch of the hut where his people lived, it blazed out;  the hut with all the out-buildings, and thirty bushels of wheat just got  into a stack, were in a few minutes destroyed. The erecting of the hut  and out-houses had cost L15 a short time before.']    Although at this season of the year there were days when, from the  extreme heat of the atmosphere, the leaves of many culinary plants  growing in the gardens have been reduced to a powder, yet there was some  ground for supposing that this accident did not arise from either the  heat of the weather, or the fire in the woods. The grain that was burnt  was the property of government, and the destruction of eight hundred  bushels of wheat made room for that quantity to be received into the  stores from the settlers who had wheat to sell to the commissary; there  were, moreover, at this time, some ill-designing people in the country,  who were known not to have much regard for the concerns of the public. An  enquiry was set on foot to discover, if possible, the perpetrators of  this mischief, but nothing could be made of it.    Several people who had been hired to saw timber on the public account  having been detected in giving a false statement, and receiving payment  for what they had not cut, were examined before two justices of the  peace; when, the fraud being proved, they were sentenced to make up the  deficiency, and to work for government, without being paid, for six  months. One, the man who measured the work, and who of course had a  confidence reposed in him, received the additional punishment of 200  lashes, which he amply merited.    Some representations having been made to the governor from the settlers  in different parts of the colony, purporting that the wages demanded by  the free labouring people, whom they had occasion to hire, was so  exorbitant as to run away with the greatest part of the profit of their  farms, it was recommended to them to appoint quarterly meetings among  themselves, to be held in each district, for the purpose of settling the  rate of wages to labourers in every different kind of work; that, to this  end, a written agreement should be entered into and subscribed by each  settler, a breach of which should be punished by a penalty, to be fixed  by the general opinion, and made recoverable in a court of civil  judicature. It was recommended to them to apply this forfeiture to the  common benefit; and they were to transmit to the head-quarters a copy of  their agreement with the rate of wages which they should from time to  time establish, for the governor's information; holding their first  meeting as early as possible.    It must appear from this, that every necessary and useful regulation was  suggested that could promote the convenience and advantage of these  people, who being in possession of land that yielded the most ample  returns, nothing but the greatest worthlessness on their part could have  prevented their getting forward, and becoming men of property. That too  many of them were of this description will appear evident, from its being  notorious that their crops were no sooner gathered, than they were  instantly disposed of for spirits, which they purchased at the rate of  three, nay, even four pounds per gallon, and of a spirit often lowered  one fourth or more of its strength with water. It was also equally  notorious, that some of them, when too idle and dissipated to hoe and  properly prepare their ground for seed, have carelessly thrown the grain  over the old stubble, and afterwards chipped it in, as they termed it,  going lightly over the ground with a hoe, and barely covering the seed.  Yet, with no greater assistance than this, the lands thus slovenly  prepared have been known to yield abundant crops.    On the 11th arrived the _Mercury_, an American brig, from Manilla,  bound to the NW coast of America. Being extremely weak and leaky, the  master put in here to refit, which he requested he might be allowed to  do. He brought no other news than the detention of several English ships  at Manilla, which seemed strongly to indicate the approach of hostilities  between the two nations, the effect, no doubt, of French fraternity with  the Spaniards.    The infant part of the settlement having at this period become very  numerous, with a view to save them, if possible, from that ruin in which  the infamous examples of their abandoned parents were but too likely to  plunge them, the clergyman, the Reverend Mr. Johnson, began to examine  them publicly every Sunday in their catechism, and other points of  religious duty, at the conclusion of the afternoon service. Some building  that might serve as a school whereto children at a certain age might be  removed from their parents, and receive education, was now become  absolutely necessary; but many other works equally necessary were still  in hand; and the labourers employed to erect them were comparatively so  inefficient, that it was impossible to think of any other work until they  were completed, though both the clergymen offered their services to  superintend the erection of a building for this purpose.    Such was the weakness of the public gangs, that it often became necessary  to require the assistance of the officers and other persons who were  allowed servants from government. In this way, by calling on each officer  and settler to send in a certain number of men for three days in the  week, the public roads between the different districts were put into good  order. This, besides very much facilitating the carriage of goods by  land, conduced very essentially to the detecting of thieves and vagrants,  who in general were found to be very quick in their motions.    Among other crimes which had been committed in this colony, that of  forgery was by no means neglected. To this, the currency of the  settlement, consisting almost entirely of paper, had opened a door. On  the 20th one man was found guilty of uttering a bill, knowing it to be  forged, and condemned to suffer death. The prisoner, whose name was  Lawrence Davoran, had been sent from Ireland, with other convicts from  that kingdom, where he had practised as an attorney, and had, it was  said (unfortunately for them, if true) respectable connections by  marriage. He was very far from being a good character. The governor,  however, after ordering the execution to take place on a certain day,  spared his life, on condition of his being transported to Norfolk Island  during the remainder of his wretched existence.    After celebrating the day on which her majesty's birth was observed with  every demonstration of attachment and respect in his power, the governor  set off on an excursion to Botany Bay, in order to explore George's river  as far up as was practicable, and to examine the soil upon its banks,  which he found to be of good quality, and considerable extent. This  river, which was observed to run in a westerly direction about  twenty-five miles up from Botany Bay, was, in many parts of its branches,  exceedingly picturesque; and navigable, for small craft, for at least  twenty miles up. Some of its creeks or branches reached within a small  distance of Prospect Hill. Between this river and Parramatta, the  governor, on his return, travelled through a thick bushy wood, covering  an excellent soil.    Erecting the granary, completing the wind-mill, and repairing the public  roads, formed the principal works in hand during this month, in which the  weather had been most uncomfortably hot, accompanied with some severe  thunder storms; in one of which both the flagstaff at the South Head, and  that at the entrance of the Cove, on Point Maskelyne, were shivered to  pieces by the lightning. The vast blazes of fire which were seen in every  direction, and which were freshened by every blast of wind, added much to  the suffocating heat that prevailed.
