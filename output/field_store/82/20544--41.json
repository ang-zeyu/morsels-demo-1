He was apparently a Bavarian farmer, somewhat advanced in  years, and wearing, in addition to his richly-substantial holiday  attire, a deep green shade over his eyes, which accounted for the  character of his thanksgivings to the miraculous image. \"I thank thee, O  most benign and saintly Maria!\" had been the tenour of his prayer, \"for  the scattered and glorious gifts of Heaven, which had become as vain  things to my soul, till thy grace renewed them in its knowledge. I thank  thee for the summer skies and the green pastures--for the footsteps  which no longer crave a helping hand--for the restored faces of my  beloved ones--and, above all, O holiest Virgin! I glorify thy name in  gratitude for the precious means by which the blessing of sight hath  been again vouchsafed me!\"    This last mode of expression excited my curiosity, and when the little  group of votaries had concluded their ceremonies, had affixed their  consecrated tapers at the shrine, and deposited their oblations with its  officiating priests, I followed their joyful footsteps out of the  chapel, and was again struck by the delicious transition from the heated  and incense-laden atmosphere of its interior, to the pure, balmy April  air without, gushing with the sweetness of the passing shower.    The ceremonies of the day were still far from their conclusion. The  historical painter of Altenoetting was in attendance in the arcade,  bearing the votive picture which was to perpetuate the latest miracle of  the Black Lady; and as far as I could observe or ascertain of the  sacerdotal hangman of the consecrated gallery, the oldest and most  weather-stained of the pictures was made to yield precedence to the new  comer. Having profited by a stranger's privilege, and the English garb,  which is held as sacred as a herald's tabard in many a foreign land, to  unite myself to the little group, and address some casual inquiries to  its frank and overjoyous members--old Philipp Stroer himself, the hero  of the day, deigned to take the picture from the hands of the sacristan,  and to ciceronize for my especial edification. I trust his restored  vision was not yet sufficiently acute to admit of his noting the smile  which, in spite of my better will, stole over my face, as I contemplated  the phenomenon of bad taste, and worse execution, which he thrust upon  my observation. It represented his worthy but very unpicturesque self in  the hands of an oculist, and the endurance of a cataract. The eyes of  his surrounding family were fixed with eager interest upon the event of  the operation. \"And what,\" said I, anxious to make some sympathy in this  domestic crisis--\"and what is the name of the surgeon whose efforts have  been blessed by the protection of the Black Lady?\"    \"The surgeon!\"    \"Yes; the oculist who is represented in the picture.\"    \"That, sir, is no oculist, no surgeon; it is my Karl, sir, my beloved  son!\" I shall never forget the voice, struggling with emotion, in which  the old man pronounced the words \"_mein sohn_!\"    The story of that son was one of deep, though humble interest. Trained  in the agricultural habits of his forefathers, and destined to succeed  to the laborious honours of the Stroerische farm, young Karl, to whom  his gray-haired father was an object of the fondest and most reverential  affection, beheld with horror the gradual advances of the disease which  was about to render the remaining years of life a burden to the  sightless man. With the fractiousness of advancing age and growing  infirmity, old Philipp obstinately refused to seek the assistance of any  learned leech of the country round. Brannau and Burchhausen boasted each  of a chirurgic wonder, but Stroer misdoubted or defied their skill. \"His  frail body,\" he said, \"was in the hands of a heavenly Providence, to  which, as might best beseem, he bequeathed its guidance.\" Meanwhile, the  perilous uncertainty of his footing, and the growing isolation of his  existence, became more and more perceptible, when one day, just as an  acknowledgement of \"total eclipse\" had fallen from his quivering lips,  the prop and stay of his household, his beloved son Karl was missing  from the farm! The first moment of uncertainty touching his destinies  was a trying one, but it was also brief. A few days brought a letter  from Munich, in which the absconded son implored his father's  forgiveness, forbearance, and patience, during some ensuing months.  Time, he wrote, might alone explain the motives of duty which had caused  his apparent error.    Patience is a difficult virtue to the sick and the unhappy. The blind  man, pining for his absent Karl, had need of all his trust in the  excellence of his favourite child: at times, misdoubtings naturally  arose; for the few months lengthened into seven, eight--eleven--a whole  year, and the wanderer came not again.    At length, one autumn evening, a general shriek from the little  household apprized Philipp Stroer of some unwonted occurrence, and  straightway a voice demanded his blessing, and warm tears were wept upon  his hand, and he knew that his son was at his feet! The story of Karl's  absence was briefly and feelingly explained. Moved by his father's  obstinate aversion to place himself in the hands of a strange  practitioner, he had resolved to qualify himself for so precious a  charge; and having interested an eminent surgeon of Munich by the detail  of his affecting anxieties sufficiently to insure his instructions in  the single branch of surgery requisite for his purpose, Karl had passed  his days in infirmaries and hospitals, denying himself the common  sustenance of nature, in order to maintain the respectability of garb  necessary for his admittance to the lectures of his scientific  preceptor. At length, his ardent endeavours were rewarded by a  certificate of expertness; and a patent of nobility would have afforded  him a far less gratifying excitement. Nor did Heaven withhold its  blessing from a cause thus hallowed by filial devotion; the operation,  which quickly followed his arrival at the farm, was attended with  perfect success. For some days, indeed, the old man still maintained his  resistance; but when he was assured that Karl had preceded his departure  for Munich by a pilgrimage to Altenoetting, and that the especial favour  of the Black Lady had sanctified his undertaking, he became more  passive--the result was a perfect restoration to sight.    \"And where,\" I exclaimed, \"is this excellent, this worthy Karl of yours  at present?\"    \"By your side,\" replied a chorus of voices; and following their  indication, I turned towards a young man of sturdy appearance, who  acknowledged my salute with prompt and open frankness. He wore the  common peasant costume of the country, and laughed away my honest  praises as a mere exaggeration. \"I had nothing to fear from my absence,\"  said he, looking towards a very beautiful girl who stood beside him,  \"for I was secure of the good faith of my Hannchen, and I knew that the  Black Lady would bless my enterprise!\"    I could not presume to despise this strange union of intelligence and  bigotry; nay, so intimately is the remembrance of the family of Stroer  connected in my mind with that of the miraculous idol, that I must  acknowledge some sort of lingering superstitious reverence towards the  shrine of the Black Virgin of Altenoetting.--_New Monthly Magazine._           *       *       *       *       *      THE RIVER.

The same man,  under the age of thirty-six, is at the head of dramatic, sinfonia, and  piano-forte music--is eminent in the church style--and equally at his  ease in every variety, from the concerto to the country dance or baby  song: he puts forth about 800 compositions, including masses, motetts,  operas, and fragments of various kinds; at the same time supporting  himself by teaching and giving public performances, at which he executes  concertos on the piano-forte, the violin, or the organ, or plays  _extempore_. But when we learn that the infant Mozart, at four years of  age, began to compose, and by an instinct perception of beauty to make  correct basses to melodies; and also that he became a great performer on  two instruments, without the usual labour of practice, we cease to be  surprised at the mechanical dexterity of his fingers in after-life, when  composition and other pursuits had engrossed the time usually employed  in preserving the power of execution.    The father of Mozart held the situation of Vice Kapell-meister and  violinist in the chapel of the archbishop of Salzburg.

Polly would take the  match, mute as wax, jump on the table, pick up the brightest thing he  could see, in a great hurry, leave the match behind, and scuttle away  round the room; but at first wouldn't give up the plunder to _me_. It was  enough. I also took the liberty, as you know, of a general look round, and  discovered that little collection of Brummagem rings and trinkets that you  have just seen--used in Polly's education, no doubt. When we sent Lloyd  away, it struck me that he might as well be usefully employed as not, so I  got him to fetch the police, deluding him a little, I fear, by talking  about the servants and a female searcher. There will be no trouble about  evidence; he'll confess. Of that I'm sure. I know the sort of man. But I  doubt if you'll get Mrs. Cazenove's brooch back. You see, he has been to  London to-day, and by this time the swag is probably broken up.\"    Sir James listened to Hewitt's explanation with many expressions of assent  and some of surprise. When it was over, he smoked a few whiffs and then  said: \"But Mrs. Armitage's brooch was pawned, and by a woman.\"    \"Exactly. I expect our friend Lloyd was rather disgusted at his small  luck--probably gave the brooch to some female connection in London, and  she realized on it. Such persons don't always trouble to give a correct  address.\"    The two smoked in silence for a few minutes, and then Hewitt continued: \"I  don't expect our friend has had an easy job altogether with that bird. His  successes at most have only been three, and I suspect he had many failures  and not a few anxious moments that we know nothing of. I should judge as  much merely from what the groom told me of frequently meeting Lloyd with  his parrot. But the plan was not a bad one--not at all. Even if the bird  had been caught in the act, it would only have been 'That mischievous  parrot!' you see. And his master would only have been looking for him.\"          II.      THE LOSS OF SAMMY CROCKETT.    It was, of course, always a part of Martin Hewitt's business to be  thoroughly at home among any and every class of people, and to be able to  interest himself intelligently, or to appear to do so, in their various  pursuits. In one of the most important cases ever placed in his hands he  could have gone but a short way toward success had he not displayed some  knowledge of the more sordid aspects of professional sport, and a great  interest in the undertakings of a certain dealer therein.    The great case itself had nothing to do with sport, and, indeed, from a  narrative point of view, was somewhat uninteresting, but the man who alone  held the one piece of information wanted was a keeper, backer, or \"gaffer\"  of professional pedestrians, and it was through the medium of his  pecuniary interest in such matters that Hewitt was enabled to strike a  bargain with him.    The man was a publican on the outskirts of Padfield, a northern town,  pretty famous for its sporting tastes, and to Padfield, therefore, Hewitt  betook himself, and, arrayed in a way to indicate some inclination of his  own toward sport, he began to frequent the bar of the Hare and Hounds.  Kentish, the landlord, was a stout, bull-necked man, of no great  communicativeness at first; but after a little acquaintance he opened out  wonderfully, became quite a jolly (and rather intelligent) companion, and  came out with innumerable anecdotes of his sporting adventures. He could  put a very decent dinner on the table, too, at the Hare and Hounds, and  Hewitt's frequent invitation to him to join therein and divide a bottle of  the best in the cellar soon put the two on the very best of terms. Good  terms with Mr. Kentish was Hewitt's great desire, for the information he  wanted was of a sort that could never be extracted by casual questioning,  but must be a matter of open communication by the publican, extracted in  what way it might be.    \"Look here,\" said Kentish one day, \"I'll put you on to a good thing, my  boy--a real good thing. Of course you know all about the Padfield 135  Yards Handicap being run off now?\"    \"Well, I haven't looked into it much,\" Hewitt replied. \"Ran the first  round of heats last Saturday and Monday, didn't they?\"    \"They did. Well\"--Kentish spoke in a stage whisper as he leaned over and  rapped the table--\"I've got the final winner in this house.\" He nodded his  head, took a puff at his cigar, and added, in his ordinary voice. \"Don't  say nothing.\"    \"No, of course not. Got something on, of course?\"    \"Rather! What do you think? Got any price I liked. Been saving him up for  this. Why, he's got twenty-one yards, and he can do even time all the way!  Fact! Why, he could win runnin' back'ards. He won his heat on Monday  like--like--like that!\" The gaffer snapped his fingers, in default of a  better illustration, and went on. \"He might ha' took it a little easier,  _I_ think; it's shortened his price, of course, him jumpin' in by two  yards. But you can get decent odds now, if you go about it right. You take  my tip--back him for his heat next Saturday, in the second round, and for  the final. You'll get a good price for the final, if you pop it down at  once. But don't go makin' a song of it, will you, now? I'm givin' you a  tip I wouldn't give anybody else.\"    \"Thanks, very much; it's awfully good of you. I'll do what you advise. But  isn't there a dark horse anywhere else?\"    \"Not dark to me, my boy, not dark to me. I know every man runnin' like a  book. Old Taylor--him over at the Cop--he's got a very good lad at  eighteen yards, a very good lad indeed; and he's a tryer this time, I  know. But, bless you, my lad could give him ten, instead o' taking three,  and beat him then! When I'm runnin' a real tryer, I'm generally runnin'  something very near a winner, you bet; and this time, mind _this_ time,  I'm runnin' the certainest winner I _ever_ run--and I don't often make a  mistake. You back him.\"    \"I shall, if you're as sure as that. But who is he?\"    \"Oh, Crockett's his name--Sammy Crockett. He's quite a new lad. I've got  young Steggles looking after him--sticks to him like wax. Takes his little  breathers in my bit o' ground at the back here. I've got a cinder-sprint  path there, over behind the trees. I don't let him out o' sight much, I  can tell you. He's a straight lad, and he knows it'll be worth his while  to stick to me; but there's some 'ud poison him, if they thought he'd  spoil their books.\"    Soon afterward the two strolled toward the taproom. \"I expect Sammy'll be  there,\" the landlord said, \"with Steggles. I don't hide him too  much--they'd think I'd got something extra on if I did.\"    In the tap-room sat a lean, wire-drawn-looking youth, with sloping  shoulders and a thin face, and by his side was a rather short, thick-set  man, who had an odd air, no matter what he did, of proprietorship and  surveillance of the lean youth. Several other men sat about, and there was  loud laughter, under which the lean youth looked sheepishly angry.    \"'Tarn't no good, Sammy, lad,\" some one was saying, \"you a-makin' after  Nancy Webb--she'll ha' nowt to do with 'ee.\"    \"Don' like 'em so thread-papery,\" added another. \"No, Sammy, you aren't  the lad for she. I see her----\"    \"What about Nancy Webb?\" asked Kentish, pushing open the door. \"Sammy's  all right, any way. You keep fit, my lad, an' go on improving, and some  day you'll have as good a house as me. Never mind the lasses. Had his  glass o' beer, has he?\" This to Raggy Steggles, who, answering in the  affirmative, viewed his charge as though he were a post, and the beer a  recent coat of paint.    \"Has two glasses of mild a day,\" the landlord said to Hewitt. \"Never puts  on flesh, so he can stand it. Come out now.\" He nodded to Steggles, who  rose and marched Sammy Crockett away for exercise.           *       *       *       *       *    On the following afternoon (it was Thursday), as Hewitt and Kentish  chatted in the landlord's own snuggery, Steggles burst into the room in a  great state of agitation and spluttered out: \"He--he's bolted; gone away!\"    \"What?\"    \"Sammy--gone! Hooked it! _I_ can't find him.\"    The landlord stared blankly at the trainer, who stood with a sweater  dangling from his hand and stared blankly back. \"What d'ye mean?\" Kentish  said, at last. \"Don't be a fool! He's in the place somewhere. Find him!\"    But this Steggles defied anybody to do. He had looked already. He had left  Crockett at the cinder-path behind the trees in his running-gear, with the  addition of the long overcoat and cap he used in going between the path  and the house to guard against chill. \"I was goin' to give him a bust or  two with the pistol,\" the trainer explained, \"but, when we got over  t'other side, 'Raggy,' ses he, 'it's blawin' a bit chilly. I think I'll  ha' a sweater. There's one on my box, ain't there?' So in I coomes for the  sweater, and it weren't on his box, and, when I found it and got back--he  weren't there. They'd seen nowt o' him in t' house, and he weren't  nowhere.\"    Hewitt and the landlord, now thoroughly startled, searched everywhere, but  to no purpose. \"What should he go off the place for?\" asked Kentish, in a  sweat of apprehension. \"'Tain't chilly a bit--it's warm. He didn't want no  sweater; never wore one before. It was a piece of kid to be able to clear  out. Nice thing, this is. I stand to win two years' takings over him.  Here--you'll have to find him.\"    \"Ah, but how?\" exclaimed the disconcerted trainer, dancing about  distractedly. \"I've got all I could scrape on him myself. Where can I  look?\"    Here was Hewitt's opportunity. He took Kentish aside and whispered. What  he said startled the landlord considerably. \"Yes, I'll tell you all about  that,\" he said, \"if that's all you want. It's no good or harm to me"]]]
