In  woods in which the fibre walls show all gradations of  thickness--in other words, where the transition from the  thin-walled cells of the early wood to the thick-walled cells of  the late wood is gradual--the two kinds of failure, namely,  buckling and bending, grade into each other. In woods with very  decided contrast between early and late wood the two forms are  usually distinct. Except in the case of complete failure the  cavity of the deformed cells remains open, and in hardwoods this  is true not only of the wood fibres but also of the tube-like  vessels. In many cases longitudinal splits occur which isolate  bundles of elements by greater or less intervals. The splitting  occurs by a tearing of the fibres or rays and not by the  separation of the rays from the adjacent elements.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Failures of short columns of green  spruce.]    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Failures of short columns of dry  chestnut.]    Moisture in wood decreases the stiffness of the fibre walls and  enlarges the region of failure. The curve which the fibre walls  make in the region of failure is more gradual and also more  irregular than in dry wood, and the fibres are more likely to be  separated.    In examining the lines of rupture in compression parallel to the  grain it appears that there does not exist any specific type,  that is, one that is characteristic of all woods. Test blocks  taken from different parts of the same log may show very decided  differences in the manner of failure, while blocks that are much  alike in the size, number, and distribution of the elements of  unequal resistance may behave very similarly. The direction of  rupture is, according to Jaccard, not influenced by the  distribution of the medullary rays.[7] These are curved with the  bundles of fibres to which they are attached. In any case the  failure starts at the weakest points and follows the lines of  least resistance. The plane of failure, as visible on radial  surfaces, is horizontal, and on the tangential surface it is  diagonal.    [Footnote 7: This does not correspond exactly with the  conclusions of A. Thil, who says (\"Constitution anatomique du  bois,\" pp. 140-141): \"The sides of the medullary rays sometimes  produce planes of least resistance varying in size with the  height of the rays. The medullary rays assume a direction more  or less parallel to the lumen of the cells on which they border;  the latter curve to the right or left to make room for the ray  and then close again beyond it. If the force acts parallel to  the axis of growth, the tracheids are more likely to be  displaced if the marginal cells of the medullary rays are  provided with weak walls that are readily compressed. This  explains why on the radial surface of the test blocks the plane  of rupture passes in a direction nearly following a medullary  ray, whereas on the tangential surface the direction of the  plane of rupture is oblique--but with an obliquity varying with  the species and determined by the pitch of the spirals along  which the medullary rays are distributed in the stem.\" See  Jaccard, _op. cit._, pp. 57 _et seq._]        SHEARING STRENGTH      Whenever forces act upon a body in such a way that one portion  tends to slide upon another adjacent to it the action is called  a ~shear~.[8] In wood this shearing action may be (1) ~along the  grain~, or (2) ~across the grain~. A tenon breaking out its  mortise is a familiar example of shear along the grain, while  the shoving off of the tenon itself would be shear across the  grain. The use of wood for pins or tree-nails involves  resistance to shear across the grain. Another common instance of  the latter is where the steel edge of the eye of an axe or  hammer tends to cut off the handle. In Fig. 10 the action of the  wooden strut tends to shear off along the grain the portion _AB_  of the wooden tie rod, and it is essential that the length of  this portion be great enough to guard against it. Fig. 11 shows  characteristic failures in shear along the grain.    [Footnote 8: Shear should not be confused with ordinary cutting  or incision.]    [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Example of shear along the grain.]    [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Failures of test specimens in shear  along the grain. In the block at the left the surface of failure  is radial; in the one at the right, tangential]    |---------------------------------------------|  |                  TABLE VII                  |  |---------------------------------------------|  | SHEARING STRENGTH ALONG THE GRAIN OF SMALL  |  | CLEAR PIECES OF 41 WOODS IN GREEN CONDITION |  |          (Forest Service Cir. 213)          |  |---------------------------------------------|  |                   |    When    |    When    |  |   COMMON NAME     | surface of | surface of |  |   OF SPECIES      | failure is | failure is |  |                   |   radial   | tangential |  |-------------------+------------+------------|  |                   |  Lbs. per  |  Lbs. per  |  |                   |  sq. inch  |  sq. inch  |  |                   |            |            |  |    Hardwoods      |            |            |  |                   |            |            |  | Ash, black        |      876   |      832   |  |   white           |    1,360   |    1,312   |  | Basswood          |      560   |      617   |  | Beech             |    1,154   |    1,375   |  | Birch, yellow     |    1,103   |    1,188   |  | Elm, slippery     |    1,197   |    1,174   |  |   white           |      778   |      872   |  | Hackberry         |    1,095   |    1,161   |  | Hickory,          |            |            |  |   big shellbark   |    1,134   |    1,191   |  |   bitternut       |    1,134   |    1,348   |  |   mockernut       |    1,251   |    1,313   |  |   nutmeg          |    1,010   |    1,053   |  |   pignut          |    1,334   |    1,457   |  |   shagbark        |    1,230   |    1,297   |  |   water           |    1,390   |    1,490   |  | Locust, honey     |    1,885   |    2,096   |  | Maple, red        |    1,130   |    1,330   |  |   sugar           |    1,193   |    1,455   |  | Oak, post         |    1,196   |    1,402   |  |   red             |    1,132   |    1,195   |  |   swamp white     |    1,198   |    1,394   |  |   white           |    1,096   |    1,292   |  |   yellow          |    1,162   |    1,196   |  | Sycamore          |      900   |    1,102   |  | Tupelo            |      978   |    1,084   |  |                   |            |            |  |    Conifers       |            |            |  |                   |            |            |  | Arborvitae         |      617   |      614   |  | Cedar, incense    |      613   |      662   |  | Cypress, bald     |      836   |      800   |  | Fir, alpine       |      573   |      654   |  |   amabilis        |      517   |      639   |  |   Douglas         |      853   |      858   |  |   white           |      742   |      723   |  | Hemlock           |      790   |      813   |  | Pine, lodgepole   |      672   |      747   |  |   longleaf        |    1,060   |      953   |  |   red             |      812   |      741   |  |   sugar           |      702   |      714   |  |   western yellow  |      686   |      706   |  |   white           |      649   |      639   |  | Spruce, Engelmann |      607   |      624   |  | Tamarack          |      883   |      843   |  |---------------------------------------------|    Both shearing stresses may act at the same time. Thus the weight  carried by a beam tends to shear it off at right angles to the  axis; this stress is equal to the resultant force acting  perpendicularly at any point, and in a beam uniformly loaded and  supported at either end is maximum at the points of support and  zero at the centre. In addition there is a shearing force  tending to move the fibres of the beam past each other in a  longitudinal direction. (See Fig. 12.) This longitudinal shear  is maximum at the neutral plane and decreases toward the upper  and lower surfaces.    [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Horizontal shear in a beam.]    Shearing across the grain is so closely related to compression  at right angles to the grain and to hardness that there is  little to be gained by making separate tests upon it. Knowledge  of shear parallel to the grain is important, since wood  frequently fails in that way. The value of shearing stress  parallel to the grain is found by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12327"],[0,"The Jewish Manual (#6)"],[1," increasing its firmness.    Fish for broiling should be rubbed over with vinegar, well dried in  a cloth and floured. The fire must be clear and free from smoke, the  gridiron made quite hot, and the bars buttered before the fish is put  on it. Fish to be fried should be rubbed in with salt, dried, rolled  in a cloth, and placed for a few minutes before the fire previous to  being put in the pan.           *       *       *       *       *    FISH FRIED IN OIL.    Soles, plaice, or salmon, are the best kinds of fish to dress in  this manner, although various other sorts are frequently used. When  prepared by salting or drying, as above directed, have a dish ready  with beaten eggs, turn the fish well over in them, and sprinkle it  freely with flour, so that the fish may be covered entirely with it,  then place it in a pan with a good quantity of the best frying oil at  boiling heat; fry the fish in it gently, till of a fine equal brown  colour, when done, it should be placed on a cloth before the fire  for the oil to drain off; great care should be observed that the oil  should have ceased to bubble when the fish is put in, otherwise it  will be greasy; the oil will serve for two or three times if strained  off and poured into a jar. Fish prepared in this way is usually served  cold.           *       *       *       *       *    FRIED SOLES IN THE ENGLISH WAY.    Prepare the soles as directed in the last receipt, brush them over  with egg, dredge them with stale bread crumbs, and fry in boiling  butter; this method is preferable when required to be served hot.           *       *       *       *       *    ESCOBECHE.    Take some cold fried fish, place it in a deep pan, then boil half a  pint of vinegar with two table spoonsful of water, and one of oil,  a little grated ginger, allspice, cayenne pepper, two bay leaves, a  little salt, and a table spoonful of lemon juice, with sliced onions;  when boiling, pour it over the fish, cover the pan, and let it stand  twenty-four hours before serving.           *       *       *       *       *    FISH STEWED WHITE.    Put an onion, finely chopped, into a stew-pan, with a little oil, till  the onion becomes brown, then add half a pint of water, and place  the fish in the stew-pan, seasoning with pepper, salt, mace, ground  allspice, nutmeg, and ginger; let it stew gently till the fish is  done, then prepare the beaten yolks of four eggs, with the juice of  two lemons, and a tea spoonful of flour, a table spoonful of cold  water, and a little saffron, mix well in a cup, and pour it into  the stew-pan, stirring it carefully one way until it thickens. Balls  should be thrown in about twenty minutes before serving; they are made  in the following way: take a little of the fish, the liver, and roe,  if there is any, beat it up finely with chopped parsley, and spread  warmed butter, crumbs of bread, and seasoning according to taste;  form this into a paste with eggs, and make it into balls of a moderate  size; this is a very nice dish when cold; garnish with sliced lemon  and parsley.           *       *       *       *       *    AN EXCELLENT RECEIPT FOR STEWED FISH IN THE DUTCH FASHION.    Take three or four parsley roots, cut them into pieces, slice several  onions and boil in a pint of water till tender, season with lemon  juice, vinegar, saffron, pepper, salt, and mace, then add the fish,  and let it stew till nearly finished, when remove it, and thicken the  gravy with a little flour and butter, and the yolk of one egg, then  return the fish to the stew-pan, with balls made as directed in the  preceding receipt, and boil up.           *       *       *       *       *    FISH STEWED BROWN.    Fry some fish of a light brown, either soles, slices of salmon,  halibut, or plaice, let an onion brown in a little oil, add to it a  cup of water, a little mushroom ketchup or powder, cayenne pepper,  salt, nutmeg, and lemon juice, put the fish into a stew-pan with the  above mixture, and simmer gently till done, then take out the fish and  thicken the gravy with a little browned flour, and stir in a glass of  port wine; a few truffles, or mushrooms, are an improvement.           *       *       *       *       *    WATER SOUCHY.    Take a portion of the fish intended to be dressed, and stew it down  with three pints of water, parsley roots, and chopped parsley, and  then pulp them through a sieve, then add the rest of the fish, with  pepper, salt, and seasoning; and serve in a deep dish.           *       *       *       *       *    A SUPERIOR RECEIPT FOR STEWED CARP.    Clean the fish thoroughly, put it into a saucepan, with a strong rich  gravy, season with onion, parsley roots, allspice, nutmegs, beaten  cloves, and ginger, let it stew very gently till nearly done, then  mix port wine and vinegar in equal quantities, coarse brown sugar and  lemon juice, a little flour, with some of the gravy from the saucepan,  mix well and pour over the fish, let it boil till the gravy thickens.  Pike is excellent stewed in this manner.           *       *       *       *       *    FILLETS OF FISH.    Fillets of salmon, soles, &c., fried of a delicate brown according to  the receipt already given, and served with a fine gravy is a very nice  dish.    If required to be very savory, make a fish force-meat, and lay it  thickly on the fish before frying; fillets dressed in this way are  usually arranged round the dish, and served with a sauce made of good  stock, thickened and seasoned with cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and  mushroom essence; piccalilli are sometimes added cut small.           *       *       *       *       *    BAKED HADDOCK.    Carefully clean a fresh haddock, and fill it with a fine forcemeat,  and sew it in securely; give the fish a dredging of flour, and pour on  warmed butter, sprinkle it with pepper and salt, and set it to bake  in a Dutch-oven before the fire, basting it, from time to time, with  butter warmed, and capers; it should be of a rich dark brown, and it  is as well to dredge two or three times with flour while at the fire,  the continual bastings will produce sufficient sauce to serve with it  without any other being added.    Mackarel and whiting prepared in this manner are excellent, the latter  should be covered with a layer of bread crumbs, and arranged in a  ring, and the forcemeat, instead of stuffing them, should be formed  into small balls, and served in the dish as a garnish.    The forcemeat must be made as for veal stuffing, with the addition of  a couple of minced anchovies, cayenne pepper, and butter instead of  suet.           *       *       *       *       *    A NICE WAY OF DRESSING RED HERRINGS.    Open them, cut off the tails and heads, soak them in hot water for an  hour, then wipe them dry; mix with warmed butter one beaten egg, pour  this over the herrings, sprinkle with bread crumbs, flour, and white  pepper, broil them and serve them very hot.           *       *       *       *       *    BAKED MACKAREL WITH VINEGAR.    Cut off the heads and tails, open and clean them, lay them in a  deep pan with a few bay leaves, whole pepper, half a tea-spoonful of  cloves, and a whole spoonful of allspice, pour over equal quantities  of vinegar and water, and bake for an hour and a half, in a gentle  oven; herrings and sprats are also dressed according to this receipt.           *       *       *       *       *    FISH SALAD.    Cut in small pieces any cold dressed fish, turbot or salmon are the  best suited; mix it with half a pint of small salad, and a lettuce  cut small, two onions boiled till tender and mild, and a few truffles  thinly sliced; pour over a fine salad mixture, and arrange it into a  shape, high in the centre, and garnish with hard eggs cut in slices;  a little cucumber mixed with the salad is an improvement. The mixture  may either be a common salad mixture, or made as follows: take the  yolks of three hard boiled eggs, with a spoonful of mustard, and a  little salt, mix these with a cup of cream, and four table-spoonsful  of vinegar, the different ingredients should be added carefully and  worked together smoothly, the whites of the eggs may be trimmed and  placed in small heaps round the dish as a garnish.           *       *       *       *       *    IMPANADA.    Cut in small pieces halibut, plaice, or soles, place them in a deep  dish in alternate layers, with slices of potatoes and dumplings made  of short-crust paste, sweetened with brown sugar, season well with  small pickles, peppers, gerkins, or West India pickles; throw over a  little water and butter warmed, and bake it thoroughly.           *       *       *       *       *    WHITE BAIT.    This is such a delicate fish that there are few cooks who attempt to  dress it without spoiling it; they should not be touched but thrown  from the dish into a cloth with a handful of flour; shake them  lightly, but enough to cover them well with the flour, then turn them  into a sieve expressly for bait to free them from too great a quantity  of the flour, then throw the fish into a pan with plenty of boiling  butter, they must remain but an instant, for they are considered  spoilt if they become the least brown; they should be placed lightly  on the dish piled up high in the centre, brown bread and butter is  always served with them; when devilled they are also excellent, and  are permitted to become brown; they are then sprinkled with cayenne  pepper, and a little salt, and served with lemon juice.    This receipt was given by a cook who dressed white bait to perfection.           *       *       *       *       *    A DUTCH FRICANDELLE.    Take two pounds of dressed fish, remove the skin and bones, cut in  small pieces with two or three anchovies, and season well, soak the  crumb of a French roll in milk, beat it up with the fish and three  eggs: butter a mould, sprinkle it with raspings, place in the fish  and bake it; when done, turn out and serve either dry or with "]]]
