It took coaxing and soothing to  restore their equanimity and then the breakfast proceeded, everybody  seeming to grow brighter and more good humored with the satisfying of the  appetite for food.    Vi was a merry little creature, a veritable bit of sunshine wherever she  went, and under the influence of her bright looks and ways, sweet rippling  laughter and amusing speeches, the whole party at length grew quite merry:  especially after Miss Fisk had announced that there were to be no lessons  that day but instead a picnic in the woods.          CHAPTER SIXTH.        \"By sports like these are all their cares beguil'd,       The sports of children satisfy the child.\"                                            --GOLDSMITH.        \"Good! good!\" cried the children. \"Oh, delightful! But where are we  going?\"    \"To the grove adjacent to the schoolhouse,\" replied the governess. \"We  could not find a lovelier spot, and its proximity to the mansion renders  it most eligible.\"    \"'Proximity, eligible, adjacent;' what do you mean by those words, Miss  Fisk?\" asked Gertrude, a little contemptuously.    \"I desire you to consult one of our standard lexicographers. You will then  be far more likely to retain the definitions in your memory,\" returned the  governess, ignoring the tone of her pupil.    Gertrude shrugged her shoulders, with impatience, muttering audibly, \"I  wish you'd talk like other people, and not like a dictionary.\"    \"You quarrel with my phraseology, because you do not understand it,\"  observed Miss Fisk, nonchalantly, \"which is very irrational, since were I  never to employ, in conversing with you, words beyond your comprehension,  you would lose the advantage of being induced to increase your stock of  information by a search for their meaning.\"    \"If that's what you do it for, you may as well give it up at once,\"  returned Gertrude, \"for I don't care enough about your meaning to take  half that trouble.\"    \"Miss Gertrude, permit me to remark that you are lacking in respect to  your instructress,\" returned Miss Fisk, reddening.    \"Do you mean that it is convenient, because of being so near this house,  Miss Fisk?\" asked Eddie respectfully.    \"Yes, convenient and safe; on which account both Mrs. Travilla and Mrs.  Ross stipulated that our picnic for to-day should be held there.\"    \"Well, let's go right away,\" said Gertrude, jumping up and pushing back  her chair.    \"Immediately, Miss Ross,\" corrected the governess. \"Right away is  exceedingly inelegant.\"    \"How tiresome!\" muttered Gertrude. Then aloud to Violet, as the governess  left the room, \"I say, Vi, does your mamma reprove you for saying right  away?\"    \"I don't remember that I ever said it. Mamma----\"    \"Said it?\" interrupted Gertrude, with a twinkle of fun in her eye, \"why  don't you say 'used the expression'? my dear,\" mimicking Miss Fisk's  tones, \"you should never condescend to make use of a sixpenny word, when a  fifty cent one would express your sentiments fully as correctly, or  perchance even more so.\"    Vi could not help joining in the laugh with which Gertrude concluded,  though feeling rather ashamed of herself, as she seemed to see the grave  look of disapproval mamma would have given her if present.    \"Oh, Gertrude,\" she said, \"we oughtn't to----\"    \"Yes, we ought,\" returned Gertrude, as they ran out of the room together;  \"mamma always laughs when I take off old finikin Fisk. She wouldn't have  me talk like her for the world. Would your mamma wish you to?\"    \"No, but she never says----\"    \"Right away? No, of course not; she says 'immediately' or 'at once' or  something that sounds nice. Well, so will I when I'm grown up.\"    Miss Fisk was on the porch taking an observation of the weather, the  children crowding about her, and clamoring to be allowed to set out  immediately for the grove. The day was fine, and there seemed every  indication that it would continue so.    \"Yes,\" said the governess, \"you may request your maids to see that you are  suitably arrayed for the occasion, and as promptly as possible, and we  will repair to the appointed place; taking our departure hence in  precisely thirty minutes.\"    The children were ready and impatiently waiting, when Miss Fisk came down  from her room, \"suitably arrayed for the occasion.\"    They set out at once, the whole party in high good humor, the boys  carrying their balls, marbles, and fishing rods, the girls their dolls and  a set of toy dishes, to play tea-party with. Miss Fisk had a bit of fancy  work and a book, and two servants brought up the rear with camp-chairs, an  afghan and rugs to make a couch for the little ones when they should grow  sleepy. Luncheon was in course of preparation by the cook, and was to be  sent by the time the young picnickers were likely to feel an appetite for  it.    The boys took the lead, bounding on some distance ahead, with Ranger in  their midst. They were in no mood just then for sitting still, so  depositing their fishing tackle in the schoolhouse, went roving about in  search of more active amusement than that of catching trout.    \"That'll be good fun when we want to sit down and rest,\" said Eddie.    \"Oh, I see a bird's nest, and I'm going to have it!\" exclaimed Archie,  beginning to climb a tree.    \"Oh don't,\" cried Harold, \"mamma says it's very cruel and wicked to rob  the poor little birds.\"    \"Pooh! you're a baby!\" answered Archie, half breathlessly, pulling himself  up higher and yet higher. \"There, I'll have it in a minute,\" reaching out  his hand to lay hold of the branch that held the nest.    Ranger was barking loudly at the foot of the tree, Harry and Eddie were  calling to Archie to \"Take care!\" and he hardly knew how it was himself,  but he missed the branch, lost his hold of the tree, and fell, lighting  upon Ranger's back.    The boy gave a scream, the dog a yelp, and the rest of the party came  running to ask what was the matter.    Archie picked himself up, looking quite crestfallen, and the fright of the  others was turned to laughter, as they discovered that he had received no  damage beyond a slight scratch on his hand and a rent in his jacket.    Miss Fisk, making him promise not to repeat the experiment, went back to  her seat under the trees and the book she had brought from the house for  her own enjoyment.    The morning passed without any further incident worth recording, the  children amusing themselves with various quiet plays, the girls keeping  house, each under her own particular tree, and exchanging visits; the boys  catching trout, which they sent to the house to be cooked for dinner. They  wanted to make a fire and cook them themselves, but Miss Fisk wisely  forbade it.    She would have had the meal served in the schoolhouse, but yielded to the  clamor for an out-door repast. Several desks were brought out into the  shade of the trees, a dainty table-cloth spread over them and the party  presently sat down to a delightful collation, to which they brought keen  appetites.    Ranger had disappeared. They missed him as they were leaving the table.    \"Where can he have gone?\" Harry was saying, when Vi cried out, \"Oh yonder  he is! and he has a dear little bird in his mouth! Oh you wicked, cruel  dog!\" And running to him she tried to take it from him.    Be dropped it and snapped at her, Eddie jerking her back just in time to  save her from his teeth, while Archie, who was very fond of Vi, struck the  dog a blow with a stick, crying furiously, \"You just do that again, sir,  and I'll kill you!\"    Ranger then flew at him, but the boy avoided the attack by jumping nimbly  behind a tree.    The other children were screaming with fright, and a catastrophe appeared  imminent, but one of the maids came running with some tempting morsels for  Ranger which appeased his wrath, and the danger was averted.    Ranger's attention being absorbed with the satisfying of his appetite, the  children now looked about for the bird. It was not quite dead, but soon  breathed its last in Vi's lap with her tears dropping fast upon it.    \"Oh don't, Vi!\" said Archie, \"I can't bear to see you feel so sorry. And  the bird isn't being hurt now, you know; 'twon't ever be hurt any more;  will it, Ed?\"    \"No,\" said Harry, \"we might as well let the dog have it.\"    \"No, no!\" said Eddie, \"it would just encourage him to catch another.\"    \"So it would,\" said Gertrude, \"let's make a grand funeral and bury it at  the foot of a tree. If we only knew now which one it used to live on.\"    The motion was about to be carried by acclamation, but Vi entered a  decided protest. \"No, no, I want to keep it.\"    \"But you can't, Vi,\" remonstrated Eddie, \"dead things have to be buried,  you know.\"    \"Not the skin and feathers, Eddie; they do stuff them sometimes and I'll  ask mamma to let me have this one done.\"    \"Oh what's the use?\" expostulated Gertrude; \"it's only a common robin.\"    \"But I love it; the poor dear little thing! and mamma will let me, I know  she will,\" returned Vi, wiping away her tears as though comforted by the  very thought.    The other children wandered off to their play leaving her sitting where  she was, on a fallen tree, fondling the bird; but Archie soon came back  and seated himself by her side.    \"Such a pity; isn't it?\" he said, \"I hate that Ranger, don't you, Vi?\"    \"No-o I hope not, Archie,\" she answered doubtfully: \"folks kill birds to  eat them and may be 'tain't any worse for dogs,\" she added, with a fresh  burst of tears. \"Poor little birdie; and may be there are some young ones  in the nest that have no mamma now to feed or care for them.\"   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14880"],[0,"McGuffey's Fourth Eclectic Reader (#6)"],[1," West, as he came from school, \"I can't help  thinking about that poor little girl I told you of the other day. She  looks so tired. I took off my hat and bowed to her to-day. I wish I could  do something for her,\"    5. \"Suppose you should carry her a handful of pretty flowers some time  when you go to school,\" said Mrs. West. \"I'll do that to-morrow morning,\"  said George, \"if I can find my way into that rickety old house.\"    6. The next morning, as Jennie sat leaning her head wearily against the  window, watching the raindrops chasing one another down the glass, she  spied George with a handful of beautiful flowers carefully picking his way  across the street. He stopped in front of her window, and, smiling very  pleasantly, said, \"How shall I find the way to your room?\"    7. Jennie pointed to an alley near by, where he turned in, and with some  difficulty found his way to the dingy staircase. Opening the door to  Jennie's gentle \"Come in,\" he said, \"I have brought you a handful of  flowers to look at this rainy day.\"    8. \"Are they for me?\" exclaimed Jennie, clapping her hands in delight.  \"How kind you are,\" she continued, as George laid them in her lap. \"I have  not had a flower since we live in the city.\"    9. \"Did you use to live in the country?\" asked George. \"Oh, yes,\" answered  Jennie, \"we used to live in a beautiful cottage, and there were trees and  flowers and green grass, and the air was so sweet.\"    10. \"Well, what made you move here?\" \"Oh,\" said Jennie, softly, \"papa  died, and mamma was sick so long that the money was all gone. Then mamma  had to sell the cottage, and she moved here to try to get work to do.\"    11. \"Do you have to sit here all day?\" asked George, glancing around the  bare room and out into the dismal street. \"Yes,\" said Jennie, \"because I  am lame; but I would not care for that, if I could only help mamma.\"    12. \"I declare, it's too had!\" said George, who dreaded nothing so much as  being obliged to stay in the house. \"Oh, no, it isn't,\" said Jennie,  pleasantly; \"mamma says maybe we should forget the Lord if we had  everything we wanted, and He never forgets us, you know.\"    13. \"Well, I must rush for school,\" said George, not knowing exactly what  to say next; and he was soon out of Jennie's sight, but had a happy little  corner in his heart, because he had tried to do a kind act. He did not  know how much good he had done in making a pleasant day out of a dreary  one for a little sick girl.    14. \"Mamma,\" said George, that evening, after he had told her what Jennie  said, \"papa must give them some money, so they can go back to their home.\"    15. \"No,\" said his mother; \"he can not do that, and they would not wish  him to do so; but perhaps he can help us contrive some way to assist them,  so that they can live more comfortably.\"    16. \"I am going to carry Jennie some of the grapes grandpa sent me,  to-morrow,\" said George, turning over the leaves of his geography. \"I will  put some of my pears into your basket, and go with you,\" said his mother;  \"but there is one thing we can always give, and sometimes it does more  good than nice things to eat, or even money.\"    17. \"What is that, mamma,--smiles?\" asked George, looking up. \"Yes,\"  answered his mother; \"and it is a good plan to throw in a kind word or two  with them when you can.\"      DEFINITIONS.-l. Dis'mal, gloomy, cheerless. Wish'ful-ly, with desire. 5.  Rick'et-y, imperfect, worn out. 7. Din'gy, dark. 11. Glan'cing, looking  about quickly. 13. Drear'y, comfortless, gloomy. 15. Con-trive', to plan.      EXERCISES.--What is the subject of this lesson? How did George West make  the day pleasant for Jennie? What did his mother suggest? What happened  next day? What did Jennie tell George about her life? Relate what happened  at George's home that evening. What does the lesson teach?        VII. LAZY NED. (38)    1. \"'T is royal fun,\" cried lazy Ned,     \"To coast, upon my fine, new sled,       And beat the other boys;     But then, I can not bear to climb     The tiresome hill, for every time       It more and more annoys.\"    2. So, while his schoolmates glided by,     And gladly tugged uphill, to try       Another merry race,     Too indolent to share their plays,     Ned was compelled to stand and gaze,       While shivering in his place.    3. Thus, he would never take the pains     To seek the prize that labor gains,       Until the time had passed;     For, all his life, he dreaded still     The silly bugbear of uphill,       And died a dunce at last.      DEFINITIONS.-l. Roy'al, excellent, noble. Coast, to slide. An--noys',  troubles. 2. In'do-lent, lazy. 3. Prize, a reward. Bug-bear, something  frightful. Dunce, a silly fellow.      EXERCISES.--What did Ned like? What did he not like?        VIII. THE MONKEY. (39)    1. The monkey is a very cunning little animal, and is found in many parts  of the world.    2. A lady once had a monkey, which had been brought to her as a present.  This monkey, like all others, was very fond of mischief and of doing  whatever he saw others do.    3. His mistress found him one day sitting on her toilet table, holding in  one hand a little china mug with water in it, and in the other her  toothbrush, with which he was cleaning his teeth, looking all the time in  the glass.    4. Her little daughter, Maria, had a large doll with a very handsome head  and face. She one day left this doll in the cradle, and went out of the  room. The monkey came in, took the doll in his arms, and jumping upon the  washstand, he began to wash its face.    5. He first rubbed it all over with soap. Then seizing the towel, he  dipped it in the wash bowl, and rubbed it so hard that the doll's face was  entirely spoiled, the paint being all washed off.    6. There have been many tales of monkeys who, armed with sticks, have  joined together and made war or resisted their enemies with great effect.  These are not true, as it is known that in their native state monkeys have  no idea of weapons.    7. The sticks and other missiles said to be thrown at travelers as they  pass under the branches of trees, are usually the dead branches, etc.,  accidentally broken off, as the monkeys, with the natural curiosity of  their tribe, pass along the tops of trees to watch the actions of the  people below.    8. They can, however, be taught to use a stick, and to use it well. Some  time ago, two Italians together owned an organ and a monkey, by means of  which they earned their living. During one of their exhibitions, a dog  flew at the little monkey, which made its owners very angry.    9. They and the owner of the dog quarreled about it, and at last it was  agreed that the dog and the monkey should fight it out; the monkey,  because he was smaller, was to be allowed a stick.    10. The monkey was taught what he was to do in the following manner: One  of the Italians crawled on his hands and knees, barking like a dog, while  the other got on his back, grasped his hair, and beat him about the head  with a stick.    11. The monkey looked on with great gravity, and, when the instruction was  over, received the stick with the air of a man who knew his work and meant  to do it.    12. Everything being settled the dog flew at the monkey with open month.  The monkey immediately leaped on his back, and, grasping the dog's ear,  beat away at his head with such good will that his adversary speedily gave  in. The monkey, however, was not content with a mere victory, but  continued pounding at the dog's head until he left him senseless on the  ground.      DEFINITIONS.--1. Cun'ning, sly. 3. Toi'let ta'ble, dressing table. 6.  Re-sist'ed, opposed. 7. Mis'siles, weapons thrown. 8. Ex-hi-bi'tions,  public shows. 11. Grav'i-ty, seriousness. In-struc'-tion, lesson, 12.  Sense'less, without apparent life.      EXERCISES.--What kind of an animal is a monkey? Where did the lady find  the monkey one day? What was he doing? What did he do with Maria's doll?  Do monkeys in their native state know how to use sticks as weapons? Can  they be taught to use them? Relate the story of the two Italians. What is  the meaning of \"etc.\" in the seventh paragraph?        IX. MEDDLESOME MATTY. (42)    1. Oh, how one ugly trick has spoiled       The sweetest and the best!     Matilda, though a pleasant child,       One grievous fault possessed,     Which, like a cloud before the skies,     Hid all her better qualities.    2. Sometimes, she'd lift the teapot lid       To peep at what was in it;     Or tilt, the kettle, if you did       But turn your back a minute.     In vain you told her not to touch,     Her trick of meddling grew so much.    3. Her grand mamma went out one day,       And, by mistake, she laid     Her spectacles and snuffbox gay,       Too near the little maid;     \"Ah! well,\" thought she, \"I'll try them on,     As soon as grand mamma is gone.\"    4. Forthwith, she placed upon her nose       The glasses large and wide;     And looking round, as I suppose,       The snuffbox, too, she spied.     \"Oh, what a pretty box is this!     I'll open it,\" said little miss.    5. \"I know that grandmamma would say,       'Don't meddle with it, dear;'     But then she's far enough away,       And no one else is near;     Beside, what can there be amiss     In opening such a box as this?\"    6. So, thumb and finger went to work       To move the stubborn lid;     And, presently, a mighty jerk       The mighty mischief did;     For all at once, ah! woeful case!     The snuff came puffing in her face.    7. Poor eyes, and nose, and mouth, and chin       A dismal sight presented;     And as the snuff got further in,       Sincerely she repented.     In vain she ran about for ease,     She could do nothing else but sneeze.    8. She dashed the spectacles away,       To wipe her tingling eyes;     And, as in twenty bits they lay,       Her grandmamma she spies.     \"Heyday! and what's the matter now?\"     Cried grandmamma, with angry brow.    9."]]]
