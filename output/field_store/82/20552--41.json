(3) WOOLLY LIP FERN. _Cheilanthes tomentosa_    Fronds eight to eighteen inches long, lanceolate-oblong, tripinnate. Pinnae  and pinnules ovate-oblong, densely woolly especially beneath, with slender,  whitish, obscurely jointed hairs. Of the ultimate segments the terminal  one is twice as long as the others. Pinnules distant, the reflexed, narrow  margin forming a continuous, membranous indusium. Stipe stout, dark brown,  densely woolly.    By donning its thick coat of wool this species is prepared to grow in  the most exposed situations of the arid southwest. It is said to be the  \"rarest, tallest and handsomest of the lip ferns.\"    Mountains of Virginia and Kentucky to Georgia, and west to Missouri, Texas  and Arizona.    (4) SLENDER LIP FERN    _Cheilanthes Feei, C. lanuginosa_    Stipes densely tufted, slender, at first hairy, dark brown, shining. Fronds  three to eight inches long, ovate-lanceolate, with thickish, distinctly  articulated hairs, twice or thrice pinnate. Pinnae ovate, the lowest  deltoid. Pinnules divided into minute, densely crowded segments, the  herbaceous margin recurved and forming an almost continuous indusium.    [Illustration: Slender Lip Fern]    The slender lip fern, known also as Fee's fern, is much the smallest of the  lip ferns, averaging, Clute tells us, \"but two inches high.\" This is only  one-third as tall as the woolly lip fern and need not be mistaken for it.  The fronds form tangled mats difficult to unravel. It grows on dry rocks  and cliffs--Illinois and Minnesota to British Columbia, and south to Texas,  New Mexico and Arizona.    [Illustration: Pinnae of Slender Lip Fern. _Cheilanthes Feei_ (From Waters's  \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt & Co.)]        5. CLOAK FERN. _Notholaena_    Small ferns with fruit-dots borne beneath the revolute margin of the  pinnules, at first roundish, but soon confluent into a narrow band without  indusium. Veins free. Fronds one to several times pinnate, the lower  surface hairy, or tomentose or powdery. Includes about forty species,  mostly American, but only one within our limits. (Greek name means  _spurious cloak_, alluding to the rudimentary or counterfeit indusium.)    (1) POWDERY CLOAK FERN. _Notholaena dealbata_    Fronds two to six inches long, triangular-ovate, acute, broadest at the  base, tripinnate. Stalks tufted, wiry, shining, dark brown. Upper surface  of the very small segments green, smooth, the lower densely coated with  a pure, white powder; hence, the specific name _dealbata_, which means  whitened. Sori brown at length; veins free.    There are several species of cloak ferns, but only one within our limits.  The dry, white powder which covers them doubtless is designed to protect  them from too rapid evaporation of moisture, as they all inhabit dry and  sunny places. This delicate rock-loving fern is found in the clefts of dry  limestone rocks in Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, and southwestward.        THE CHAIN FERNS. _Woodwardia_    Large and somewhat coarse ferns of swampy woods with pinnate or nearly  two-pinnate fronds, and oblong or linear fruit-dots, arranged in one or  more chain-like rows, parallel to and near the midribs. Indusium fixed by  its outer margin to a veinlet and opening on the inner side. In our  section there are two species. (Named for Thomas J. Woodward, an English  botanist.)    [Illustration: Powdery Cloak Fern. _Notholaena  dealbata_ (Kansas) (G.E. Davenport)]    [Illustration: The Common Chain Fern.  _Woodwardia virginica_]    (1) THE COMMON CHAIN FERN. _Woodwardia virginica_    Sterile and fertile fronds similar in outline, two to four feet high, once  pinnate, the pinnae deeply incised with oblong segments. Fruit-dots oblong  in chain-like rows along the midrib both of the pinnae and the lobes,  confluent when ripe. Veins forming narrow rows of net-like spaces (areoles)  beneath the fruit-dots, thence free to the margin. The spores ripen in  July.    The sterile fronds resemble those of the cinnamon fern, but the latter grow  in crowns, with a single frond in the center, while the fronds of the  chain fern rise singly from the creeping rootstock, which sends them up at  intervals all summer. The sori are borne on the backs of fertile fronds.  There are usually more sterile than fertile blades, especially in dense  shade. We have waded repeatedly through a miry swamp in Melrose, Mass.,  where the wild calla flourishes along with the blueberry and other swamp  bushes, and have found the chain fern in several shaded spots, but every  frond was sterile. It is said that when exposed to the sun it always faces  the south. Swamps, Maine to Florida, especially along the Atlantic Coast,  and often in company with the narrow-leaved species.    [Illustration: Net-Veined Chain Fern. _Woodwardia areolata_ (Stratford,  Conn.)]    (2) NET-VEINED CHAIN FERN    NARROW-LEAVED CHAIN FERN    _Woodwardia areolata. W. angustifolia_    Root stocks creeping and chaffy. Sterile and fertile fronds unlike; sterile  ones nine to twelve inches tall, deltoid-ovate. Broadest at the base, with  lanceolate, serrulate divisions united by a broad wing. Veins areolate;  fertile fronds taller, twelve to twenty inches high with narrowly linear  divisions, the areoles and fruit-dots in a single row each side of the  secondary midrib, the latter sunk in the tissues.    This species is less common than the Virginia fern, but they often grow  near each other. We have collected both in the Blue Hill reservation near  Boston, and both have been found in Hingham, Medford, and Reading, and  doubtless in other towns along the coast. Mrs. Parsons speaks of finding  them in the flat, sandy country near Buzzard's Bay. The net-veined species  has some resemblance to the sensitive fern, but in the latter the spore  cases are shut up in small pods formed by the contracting and rolling up of  the lobes, whereas the chain fern bears its sori on the under side of long,  narrow pinnae. Besides, the sterile fronds of the latter have serrulate  segments. As in the sensitive fern there are many curious gradations  between the fertile and sterile fronds, both in shape and fruitfulness.  Waters calls them the \"_obtusilobata_ form.\"    [Illustration: The Spleenworts 1. Narrow-leaved 2. Ebony 3. Rue 4. Scott's  5. Maidenhair 6. Green 7. Mountain]      THE SPLEENWORTS      A. THE ROCK SPLEENWORTS. _Asplenium_    Small, evergreen ferns. Fruit-dots oblong or linear, oblique, separate when  young. Indusium straight or rarely curved, fixed lengthwise on the upper  side of a fertile veinlet, opening toward the midrib. Veins free. Scales of  rhizome and stipes narrow, of firm texture and with thick-walled cells.    (1) PINNATIFID SPLEENWORT. _Asplenium pinnatifidum_    Fronds four to six inches long, lanceolate, pinnatifid or pinnate near the  base, tapering above into a slender prolongation. Lobes roundish-ovate, or  the lower pair acuminate. Fruit-dots irregular, numerous. Stipes tufted,  two to four inches long, brownish beneath, green above.    Although this fern, like all the small spleenworts, is heavily fruited,  it is extremely rare. It is found as far north as Sharon, Conn., thence  southward to Georgia, to Arkansas and Missouri. On cliffs and rocks.  Resembles the walking fern, and its tip sometimes takes root.    (2) SCOTT'S SPLEENWORT. _Asplenium ebenoides_    Fronds four to ten inches long, broadly lanceolate, pinnatifid or pinnate  below, tapering to a prolonged and slender apex. Divisions lanceolate from  a broad base. Fruit-dots straight or slightly curved. Stipe and rachis  brown.    [Illustration: Pinnatifid Spleenwort. _Asplenium pinnatifidum_ a, Small  Plants from Harper's Ferry; b, Sori on Young Fronds (From Waters's \"Ferns,\"  Henry Holt & Co.)]    [Illustration: Scott's Spleenwort. _Asplenium ebenoides_ a, from Virginia;  b, from Alabama; c, from Maryland (From Waters's \"Ferns,\" Henry Holt &  Co.)]    Resembles the last, and like that has been known to root at the tip. It is  a hybrid between the walking fern and the ebony spleenwort, as proved by  Miss Margaret Slosson, and may be looked for in the immediate vicinity of  its parents. It was discovered by R.R. Scott, in 1862, at Manayunk, Pa., a  suburb of Philadelphia, and described by him in the Gardener's Monthly of  September, 1865. Vermont to Alabama, Missouri, and southward. Rare, but  said to be plentiful in a deep ravine near Havana, Ala.    [Illustration: Green Spleenwort. _Asplenium viride_]    (3) GREEN SPLEENWORT. _Asplenium viride_    Fronds two to ten inches long, linear, pinnate, pale green. Pinnae  roundish-ovate, crenate, with indistinct and forking midveins. Stalks  tufted, short, brownish below, green above. Rachis green.    Discovered at Smuggler's Notch, Mt. Mansfield, Vt., by C.G. Pringle in  1876. Found sparingly at Willoughby Lake, high on the cliffs of Mt. Horr.  This rare and delicate little plant bears a rather close resemblance to the  maidenhair spleenwort, which, however, has dark stipes instead of green.    Northern New England, west and northwest on shaded limestone rocks.    [Illustration: Maidenhair Spleenwort. _Asplenium Trichomanes_]    (4) MAIDENHAIR SPLEENWORT. _Asplenium Trichomanes_    Stipes densely tufted, purple-brown, shining. Fronds three to eight inches  long, linear, dark green, rather rigid. Pinnae roundish-oblong or oval,  entire or finely crenate, attached at the base by a narrow point. Midveins  forking and evanescent.    Not very common, but distributed almost throughout North America. May be  looked for wherever there are ledges, as it does not require limestone.  July.

But Edward, for the first few days, gave him no rest. He  took him about everywhere, now on foot, now on horseback, making him  acquainted with the country and with the estate; and he embraced the  opportunity of imparting to him the wishes which he had been long  entertaining, of getting at some better acquaintance with it, and  learning to manage it more profitably.    \"The first thing we have to do,\" said the Captain, \"is to make a  magnetic survey of the property. That is a pleasant and easy matter; and  if it does not admit of entire exactness, it will be always useful, and  will do, at any rate, for an agreeable beginning. It can be made, too,  without any great staff of assistants, and one can be sure of getting it  completed. If by-and-by you come to require anything more exact, it will  be easy then to find some plan to have it made.\"    The Captain was exceedingly skilful at work of thus kind. He had brought  with him whatever instruments he required, and commenced immediately.  Edward provided him with a number of foresters and peasants, who, with  his instruction, were able to render him all necessary assistance. The  weather was favorable. The evenings and the early mornings were devoted  to the designing and drawing, and in a short time it was all filled in  and colored. Edward saw his possessions grow out like a new creation  upon the paper; and it seemed as if now for the first time he knew what  they were, as if they now first were properly his own.    Thus there came occasion to speak of the park, and of the ways of laying  it out; a far better disposition of things being made possible after a  survey of this kind, than could be arrived at by experimenting on  nature, on partial and accidental impressions.    \"We must make my wife understand this,\" said Edward.    \"We must do nothing of the kind,\" replied the Captain, who did not like  bringing his own notions in collision with those of others. He had  learnt by experience that the motives and purposes by which men are  influenced are far too various to be made to coalesce upon a single  point, even on the most solid representations. \"We must not do it,\" he  cried; \"she will be only confused. With her, as with all people who  employ themselves on such matters merely as amateurs, the important  thing is, rather that she shall do something, than that something shall  be done. Such persons feel their way with nature. They have fancies for  this plan or that; they do not venture on removing obstacles. They are  not bold enough to make a sacrifice. They do not know beforehand in what  their work is to result. They try an experiment--it succeeds--it fails;  they alter it; they alter, perhaps, what they ought to leave alone, and  leave what they ought to alter; and so, at last, there always remains  but a patchwork, which pleases and amuses, but never satisfies.\"    \"Acknowledge candidly,\" said Edward, \"that you do not like this new work  of hers.\"    \"The idea is excellent,\" he replied; \"if the execution were equal to it,  there would be no fault to find. But she has tormented herself to find  her way up that rock; and she now torments every one, if you must have  it, that she takes up after her. You cannot walk together, you cannot  walk behind one another, with any freedom. Every moment your step is  interrupted one way or another. There is no end to the mistakes which  she has made.\"    \"Would it have been easy to have done it otherwise?\" asked Edward.    \"Perfectly,\" replied the Captain. \"She had only to break away a corner  of the rock, which is now but an unsightly object, made up as it is of  little pieces, and she would at once have a sweep for her walk and stone  in abundance for the rough masonry work, to widen it in the bad places,  and make it smooth. But this I tell you in strictest confidence. Her it  would only confuse and annoy. What is done must remain as it is. If any  more money and labor is to be spent there, there is abundance to do  above the summer-house on the hill, which we can settle our own way.\"    If the two friends found in their occupation abundance of present  employment, there was no lack either of entertaining reminiscences of  early times, in which Charlotte took her part as well. They determined,  moreover, that as soon as their immediate labors were finished, they  would go to work upon the journal, and in this way, too, reproduce the  past.    For the rest, when Edward and Charlotte were alone, there were fewer  matters of private interest between them than formerly. This was  especially the case since the fault-finding about the grounds, which  Edward thought so just, and which he felt to the quick. He held his  tongue about what the Captain had said for a long time; but at last,  when he saw his wife again preparing to go to work above the  summer-house, with her paths and steps, he could not contain himself any  longer, but, after a few circumlocutions, came out with his new views.    Charlotte was thoroughly disturbed. She was sensible enough to perceive  at once that they were right, but there was the difficulty with what was  already done--and what was made was made. She had liked it; even what  was wrong had become dear to her in its details. She fought against her  convictions; she defended her little creations; she railed at men who  were forever going to the broad and the great. They could not let a  pastime, they could not let an amusement alone, she said, but they must  go and make a work out of it, never thinking of the expense which their  larger plans involved. She was provoked, annoyed, and angry. Her old  plans she could not give up, the new she would not quite throw from her;  but, divided as she was, for the present she put a stop to the work, and  gave herself time to think the thing over, and let it ripen by itself.    At the same time that she lost this source of active amusement, the  others were more and more together over their own business. They took  to occupying themselves, moreover, with the flower-garden and the  hot-houses; and as they filled up the intervals with the ordinary  gentlemen's amusements, hunting, riding, buying, selling, breaking  horses, and such matters, she was every day left more and more to  herself. She devoted herself more assiduously than ever to her  correspondence on account of the Captain; and yet she had many lonely  hours; so that the information which she now received from the school  became of more agreeable interest.    To a long-drawn letter of the superior of the establishment, filled with  the usual expressions of delight at her daughter's progress, a brief  postscript was attached, with a second from the hand of a gentleman in  employment there as an Assistant, both of which we here communicate.    POSTSCRIPT OF THE SUPERIOR    \"Of Ottilie, I can only repeat to your ladyship what I have already  stated in my former letters. I do not know how to find fault with her,  yet I cannot say that I am satisfied. She is always unassuming, always  ready to oblige others; but it is not pleasing to see her so timid, so  almost servile.    \"Your ladyship lately sent her some money, with several little matters  for her wardrobe. The money she has never touched, the dresses lie  unworn in their place. She keeps her things very nice and very clean;  but this is all she seems to care about. Again, I cannot praise her  excessive abstemiousness in eating and drinking. There is no  extravagance at our table, but there is nothing that I like better than  to see the children eat enough of good, wholesome food. What is  carefully provided and set before them ought to be taken; and to this I  never can succeed in bringing Ottilie. She is always making herself some  occupation or other, always finding something which she must do,  something which the servants have neglected, to escape the second course  or the dessert; and now it has to be considered (which I cannot help  connecting with all this) that she frequently suffers, I have lately  learnt, from pain in the left side of her head. It is only at times, but  it is distressing, and may be of importance. So much upon this otherwise  sweet and lovely girl.\"    SECOND POSTSCRIPT, BY THE ASSISTANT    \"Our excellent superior commonly permits me to read the letters in which  she communicates her observations upon her pupils to their parents and  friends. Such of them as are addressed to your ladyship I ever read with  twofold attention and pleasure. We have to congratulate you upon a  daughter who unites in herself every brilliant quality with which people  distinguish themselves in the world; and I at least think you no less  fortunate in having had bestowed upon you, in your step-daughter, a  child who has been born for the good and happiness of others, and  assuredly also for her own. Ottilie is almost our only pupil about whom  there is a difference of opinion between myself and our reverend  superior. I do not complain of the very natural desire in that good lady  to see outward and definite fruits arising from her labors. But there  are also fruits which are not outward, which are of the true germinal  sort, and which develop themselves sooner or later in a beautiful life.  And this I am certain is the case with your protegee. So long as she has  been under my care, I have watched her moving with an even step, slowly,  steadily forward--never back. As with a child it is necessary to begin  everything at the beginning, so it is with her. She can comprehend  nothing which does not follow from what precedes it; let a thing be as  simple and easy as possible, she can make nothing of it if it is not in  a recognizable connection; but find the intermediate links, and make  them clear to her, and then nothing is too difficult for her.
