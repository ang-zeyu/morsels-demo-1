Christianity again condemned marriage, though it eventually agreed to  a compromise sanctifying this tie; Islam, on the contrary, found in  the Qoran the text \"Ye that are unmarried shall marry\" (24, 32). In  the face of so clear a statement, the condemnation of marriage, which  in any case was contrary to the whole spirit of the Qoran, could not  be maintained. Thus the Muhammedan tradition contains numerous sayings  in support of marriage. \"A childless house contains no blessing\": \"the  breath of a son is as the breath of Paradise\"; \"when a man looks upon  his wife (in love) and she upon him, God looks down in mercy upon them  both.\" \"Two prayers of a married man are more precious in the sight of  God than seventy of a bachelor.\" With many similar variations upon the  theme, Muhammed is said to have urged marriage upon his followers. On  the other hand an almost equally numerous body of warnings against  marriage exists, also issued by Muhammed. I know no instance of direct  prohibition, but serious admonitions are found which usually take the  form of denunciation of the female sex and were early interpreted as  warnings by tradition. \"Fear the world and women\": \"thy worst enemies  are the wife at thy side and thy concubine\": \"the least in Paradise  are the women\": \"women are the faggots of hell\"; \"pious women are rare  as ravens with white or red legs and white beaks\"; \"but for women men  might enter Paradise.\" Here we come upon a strain of thought  especially Christian. Muhammed regarded the satisfaction of the sexual  instincts as natural and right and made no attempt to put restraint  upon it: Christian asceticism regarded this impulse as the greatest  danger which could threaten the spiritual life of its adherents, and  the sentences above quoted may be regarded as the expression of this  view. Naturally the social position of the woman suffered in  consequence and is so much worse in the traditional Muhammedanism as  compared with the Qoran that the change can only be ascribed to the  influence of the civilisation which the Muhammedans encountered. The  idea of woman as a creature of no account is certainly rooted in the  ancient East, but it reached Islam in Christian dress and with the  authority of Christian hostility to marriage.    With this hostility to marriage are probably connected the regulations  concerning the covering of the body: in the ancient church only the  face, the hands and the feet were to be exposed to view, the object  being to prevent the suggestion of sinful thoughts: it is also likely  that objections to the ancient habit of leaving the body uncovered  found expression in this ordinance. Similar objections may be found in  Muhammedan tradition; we may regard these as further developments of  commands given in the Qoran, but it is also likely that Muhammed's  apocryphal statements upon the point were dictated by Christian  religious theory. They often appear in connection with warnings  against frequenting the public baths, which fact is strong evidence of  their Christian origin. \"A bad house is the bath: much turmoil is  therein and men show their nakedness.\" \"Fear that house that is called  the bathhouse and if any enter therein, let him veil himself.\" \"He who  believes in God and the last Judgment, let him enter the bath only in  bathing dress.\" \"Nakedness is forbidden to us.\" There is a story of  the prophet, to the effect that he was at work unclothed when a voice  from heaven ordered him to cover his nakedness!           *       *       *       *       *    We thus see, that an astonishing similarity is apparent in the  treatment even of questions where divergency is fundamental.  Divergency, it is true, existed, but pales before the general affinity  of the two theories of life. Our judgment upon Christian medievalism  in this respect can be applied directly and literally to  Muhammedanism. Either religion regards man as no more than a sojourner  in this world. It is not worth while to arrange for a permanent  habitation, and luxurious living is but pride. Hence the simplicity of  private dwellings in mediaeval times both in the East and West.  Architectural expense is confined to churches and mosques, which were  intended for the service of God. These Christian ideas are reflected  in the inexhaustible storehouse of Muhammedan theory, the great  collections of tradition, as follows. \"The worst use which a believer  can make of his money is to build.\" \"Every building, except a mosque,  will stand to the discredit of its architect on the day of  resurrection.\" These polemics which Islam inherited from Christianity  are directed not only against building in general, but also against  the erection and decoration of lofty edifices: \"Should a man build a  house nine ells high, a voice will call to him from heaven, Whither  wilt thou rise, most profane of the profane?\" \"No prophet enters a  house adorned with fair decoration.\" With these prohibitions should be  connected the somewhat unintelligible fact that the most pious Caliphs  sat upon thrones (_mimbar_, \"president's chair\") of clay. The simplest  and most transitory material thus serves to form the symbol of  temporal power. A house is adorned not by outward show, but by the  fact that prayer is offered and the Qoran recited within its walls.  These theories were out of harmony with the worldly tendencies of the  conquerors, who built themselves castles, such as Qusair Amra: they  belong to the spirit of Christianity rather than to Islam.    Upon similar principles we may explain the demand for the utmost  simplicity and reserve in regard to the other enjoyments of life. To  eat whenever one may wish is excess and two meals a day are more than  enough. The portion set apart for one may also suffice for two. Ideas  of this kind are of constant recurrence in the Muhammedan traditions:  indispensable needs alone are to be satisfied, as indeed Thomas  Aquinas teaches. Similar observations apply to dress: \"he who walks in  costly garments to be seen of men is not seen of the Lord.\" Gold and  silver ornaments, and garments of purple and silk are forbidden by  both religions. Princes live as simply as beggars and possess only one  garment, so that they are unable to appear in public when it is being  washed: they live upon a handful of dates and are careful to save  paper and artificial light. Such incidents are common in the oldest  records of the first Caliphs. These princes did not, of course, live  in such beggary, and the fact is correspondingly important that after  the lapse of one or two generations the Muhammedan historians should  describe their heroes as possessing only the typical garment of the  Christian saint. This one fact speaks volumes.    Every action was performed in God or with reference to God--an  oft-repeated idea in either religion. There is a continual hatred of  the world and a continual fear that it may imperil a man's soul. Hence  the sense of vast responsibility felt by the officials, a sense which  finds expression even in the ordinary official correspondence of the  authorities which papyri have preserved for us. The phraseology is  often stereotyped, but as such, expresses a special theory of life.  This responsibility is represented as weighing with especial severity  upon a pious Caliph. Upon election to the throne he accepts office  with great reluctance protesting his unworthiness with tears. The West  can relate similar stories of Gregory the Great and of Justinian.    Exhortations are frequent ever to remember the fact of death and to  repent and bewail past sins. When a mention of the last Judgment  occurs in the reading of passages from the Bible or Qoran, the  auditors burst into tears. Upon one occasion a man was praying upon  the roof of his house and wept so bitterly over his sins, that the  tears ran down the waterspout and flooded the rooms below. This  hyperbolical statement in a typical life of a saint shows the high  value attributed to tears in the East. It is, however, equally a  Christian characteristic. The gracious gift of tears was regarded by  mediaeval Christianity as the sign of a deeply religious nature.  Gregory VII is said to have wept daily at the sacrifice of the Mass  and similar accounts are given to the credit of other famous  Christians.    While a man should weep for his own sins, he is not to bewail any  misfortune or misery which may befall him. In the latter case it is  his duty to collect his strength, to resign himself and to praise God  even amid his sufferings. Should he lose a dear relative by death, he  is not to break out with cries and lamentations like the heathen.  Lamentation for the dead is most strictly forbidden in Islam. \"We are  God's people and to God we return\" says the pious Muslim on receiving  the unexpected news of a death. Resignation and patience in these  matters is certainly made the subject of eloquent exhortation in the  Qoran, but the special developments of tradition betray Christian  influence.    Generally speaking, the whole ethical system of the two religions is  based upon the contrast between God and the world, though Muhammedan  philosophy will recognize no principle beside that of God. As a  typical example we may take a sentence from the Spanish bishop Isidor  who died in 636: \"Good are the intentions directed towards God and bad  are those directed to earthly gain or transitory fame.\" Any Muhammedan  theologian would have subscribed to this statement. On the one hand  stress is laid upon motive as giving its value to action. The first  sentence in the most famous collection of traditions runs, \"Deeds  shall be judged by their intentions.\" On the other hand is the  contrast between God and the world, or as Islam puts it, between the  present and the future life.

The numerous ramifications  of these branches anastomose both anteriorly and posteriorly with their  corresponding branches of the artery of the opposite side. This circle  closely embraces the os coronae. Among the larger branches given off from  its anterior portion are two descending, one on each side of the extensor  pedis, to assist in the formation of the _Circumflex Artery of the Coronary  Cushion_. The formation of this last-named artery is completed posteriorly  by the before-mentioned branch from the artery of the plantar cushion.    THE PREPLANTAR (UNGUAL[A]) ARTERY.--This, the smaller of the two terminal  branches of the digital, is situated inside the basilar process of the os  pedis. It turns round this to gain the fissure between the basilar and  retrossal processes, and becomes lodged in the preplantar fissure. Here  it terminates in several divisions which bury themselves in the os pedis.  Before leaving the inner aspect of the pedal wing it supplies a deep branch  to the heel and the villous tissue. Gaining the outer aspect of the  wing, it distributes a further backward branch, which passes behind the  circumflex artery of the pedal bone, and, during its passage in the  preplantar fissure, gives off ascending and descending branches, which  ramify in the laminal tissue.    THE PLANTAR (UNGUAL[A]) ARTERY.--This, the larger of the two terminals  of the digital, may be looked upon as a continuation of the main vessel.  Running along the plantar groove, it gains the plantar foramen. Here it  enters the interior of the bone (the semilunar sinus) and anastomoses with  the corresponding artery of the opposite side. The circle of vessels so  formed is called the _Plantar Arch_ or the _Semilunar Anastomosis_.    [Footnote A: The epithet 'ungual' is added by Chauveau to distinguish  these arteries from the properly so-called plantar arteries--the terminal  divisions of the posterior tibial artery.]    From the semilunar anastomosis radiate two main groups of arterial  branches, an ascending group and a descending one. The _ascending_ branches  penetrate the substance of the os pedis, and emerge by the numerous  foraminae on its laminal surface. The _descending_ branches, larger in size,  also penetrate the substance of the pedal bone, and emerge in turn from  the foraminae cribbling its outer surface--in this case the set of larger  foraminae opening on its inferior edge. Having gained exit from the bone,  their frequent anastomosis, right and left, with their fellows forms a  large vessel following the contour of the inferior edge of the os pedis.  This constitutes the _Circumflex Artery of the Toe_.      E. THE VEINS.    These commence at the foot with a series of plexuses, which may be  described as forming (1) AN INTERNAL OR INTRA-OSSEOUS VENOUS SYSTEM, and  (2) AN EXTERNAL OR EXTRA-OSSEOUS VENOUS SYSTEM.    1. THE INTRA-OSSEOUS VENOUS SYSTEM.--This is a venous system within the  structure of, and occupying the semilunar sinus of the os pedis. It follows  in every respect the arrangement of the arteries as before described in the  same region. Efferent vessels emerge from the plantar foraminae, follow the  plantar fissures, and ascend within the basilar processes of the os pedis.  Here they lie under shelter of the lateral cartilages, and assist in the  formation of the deep layer of the coronary plexus of the extra-osseous  system.    2. THE EXTRA-OSSEOUS VENOUS SYSTEM.--This may be regarded as a close-meshed  network enveloping the whole of the foot. Although a continuous system, it  is best described by recognising in it three distinct parts:      _(a) The Solar Plexus_.    _(b) The Podophyllous Plexus_.    _(c) The Coronary Plexus_.    _(a) The Solar Plexus_.--The veins of this plexus discharge themselves in  two directions: (1) _By a central canal_ or canals running along the bottom  of the lateral lacunae of the plantar cushion to gain the deep layer of the  coronary plexus. (2) _By the Circumflex or Peripheral Vein of the Toe_, a  canal formed by ramifications from the solar and the podophyllous plexuses,  and following the direction of the artery of the same name. The circumflex  vein terminates by forwarding branches to concur in the formation of the  superficial coronary plexus.    _(b) The Podophyllous or Laminal Plexus_.--The podophyllous veins  anastomose below with the circumflex vein of the solar plexus, and above  with the veins of the coronary plexus.    _(c) The Coronary Plexus_.--This proceeds from the podophyllous, the  intra-osseous, and the solar networks, and consists of a _central_ and _two  lateral parts_.    The _central_ portion lies between the lateral cartilages and immediately  under the coronary cushion. The _lateral portions_ are ramifications on  both surfaces of the lateral cartilages. The ramifications on the lateral  cartilages may be again distinguished as _superficial_ and _deep_. The  superficial layer is distributed over the external face of the cartilage,  forming thereon a dense network, and finally converges towards the superior  limit of the plexus to form ten or twelve principal branches, which again  unite to form two large vessels. These vessels, by their final fusion at  the lower end of the first phalanx, constitute the digital vein. The deep  layer is formed, as before described, by ascending branches from the  posterior parts of the podophyllous and solar plexuses, and by branches  from the intra-osseous system of the pedal bone. The veins of this deep  layer finally drain into the two vessels proceeding from the superficial  layer, which go to the formation of the digital vein.    THE DIGITAL VEINS--These arise from the network formed on the surfaces of  the lateral cartilages, and ascend in front of the digital arteries to  unite above the fetlock, where they form an arch between the deep flexor  and the suspensory ligament. From this arch (named the _Sesamoidean)_  proceed the Metacarpal Veins.    THE METACARPAL VEINS.--Three in number, they are distinguished as an  _Internal_ and an _External Metacarpal_, and a _Deep_ or _Interosseous  Metacarpal_. As we shall be concerned with these in the higher operation of  neurectomy, we may give them brief mention.    THE INTERNAL METACARPAL VEIN, the largest of the three, has relations  with the internal metacarpal artery and the internal plantar nerve. These  relations were shortly discussed under the section devoted to the arteries,  to which the reader may refer.    THE EXTERNAL METACARPAL VEIN.--This ascends on the external side of the  flexor tendons in company with the external plantar nerve.    _The Interosseous Vein_.--This is an irregular vessel running up between  the suspensory ligament and the posterior face of the large metacarpal  bone.      F. THE NERVES.    THE PLANTAR NERVES.--These are two in number, and are distinguished as  Internal and External.    THE INTERNAL PLANTAR NERVE lies behind and in close contact with the great  metacarpal artery during that vessel's course down the region of the  cannon. A point of interest is that it gives off at about the middle of  the cannon a branch which bends obliquely downwards and behind the flexor  tendons to join its fellow of the opposite side--namely, the external  plantar. This it joins an inch or more above the bottom of the splint bone.  Measured in a straight line, this is about 2-1/2 inches below its point  of origin. Near the fetlock, at the level of the sesamoids, the internal  plantar nerve ends in several digital branches.    THE EXTERNAL PLANTAR NERVE.--This holds a position to the outside of the  metacarpal region, analogous to that of the internal plantar nerve on  the inside of the limb, running down on the external edge of the flexor  tendons. Unlike the internal nerve, it is accompanied by a single vessel  only, the external metacarpal vein, behind which it lies. At the level of  the sesamoid bones it divides, as does the _internal_ nerve, into three  main branches--the digital nerves.    [Illustration: FIG. 15.--THE VEINS AND NERVES OF THE FOOT. 1, The digital  vein; 2, its main tributaries, draining the podophyllous plexus, and  concurring to form the digital; 3. the digital artery (the main trunk only  of this is shown, in order to show its relationship with the vein and  nerve); 4, the plantar nerve, with its three branches--(_a_) the anterior  digital, (_b_) the middle digital, (_c_) the posterior digital; 5, the  podophyllous plexus; 6, superficial portion of the coronary plexus; 7, the  peripheral or circumflex vein of the toe.]    THE DIGITAL NERVES.--These are distinguished as Anterior, Middle, and  Posterior.    _The Anterior Branch_ descends in front of the vein, distributing cutaneous  branches to the front of the digit, and terminating in the coronary  cushion.    _The Middle Branch_ descends between the artery and the vein, and freely  anastomoses with the two other branches. It terminates in the coronary  cushion and the sensitive laminae.    _The Posterior Branch_.--This is the largest of the three, and may be  regarded as the direct continuation of the plantar. At the fetlock it is  placed immediately above the digital artery, but afterwards takes up a  position directly behind that vessel. Together with the digital artery it  descends to near the basilar process of the os pedis. Here it passes with  the plantar artery into the interior of the os pedis, and continues its  main branch, with the preplantar artery, in the fissure of the same name,  to finally furnish supply to the os pedis and the sensitive laminae. It is  this nerve which is divided in the low operation of neurectomy.    Beyond the fact of this branch descending, in the region of the pastern, 1  inch behind the digital "]]]
