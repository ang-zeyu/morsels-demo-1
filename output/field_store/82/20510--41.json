Mr. Knopf left  me at about 9.30, for he knows I go very early to bed, and I took my new  stock upstairs with me, and locked it up in the safe. I certainly heard  nothing of the noise in the mews last night. I sleep on the second  floor, in the front of the house, and this is the first I have heard of  poor Mr. Knopf's loss--'    \"At this point of his narrative Mr. Shipman very suddenly paused, and  his face became very pale. With a hasty word of excuse he  unceremoniously left the room, and the detective heard him running  quickly upstairs.    \"Less than two minutes later Mr. Shipman returned. There was no need for  him to speak; both the detective and the inspector guessed the truth in  a moment by the look upon his face.    \"'The diamonds!' he gasped. 'I have been robbed.'\"          CHAPTER V    A NIGHT'S ADVENTURE      \"Now I must tell you,\" continued the man in the corner, \"that after I  had read the account of the double robbery, which appeared in the early  afternoon papers, I set to work and had a good think--yes!\" he added  with a smile, noting Polly's look at the bit of string, on which he was  still at work, \"yes! aided by this small adjunct to continued thought--I  made notes as to how I should proceed to discover the clever thief, who  had carried off a small fortune in a single night. Of course, my methods  are not those of a London detective; he has his own way of going to  work. The one who was conducting this case questioned the unfortunate  jeweller very closely about his servants and his household generally.    \"'I have three servants,' explained Mr. Shipman, two of whom have been  with me for many years; one, the housemaid, is a fairly new comer--she  has been here about six months. She came recommended by a friend, and  bore an excellent character. She and the parlourmaid room together. The  cook, who knew me when I was a schoolboy, sleeps alone; all three  servants sleep on the floor above. I locked the jewels up in the safe  which stands in the dressing-room. My keys and watch I placed, as usual,  beside my bed. As a rule, I am a fairly light sleeper.    \"'I cannot understand how it could have happened--but--you had better  come up and have a look at the safe. The key must have been abstracted  from my bedside, the safe opened, and the keys replaced--all while I was  fast asleep. Though I had no occasion to look into the safe until just  now, I should have discovered my loss before going to business, for I  intended to take the diamonds away with me--'    \"The detective and the inspector went up to have a look at the safe. The  lock had in no way been tampered with--it had been opened with its own  key. The detective spoke of chloroform, but Mr. Shipman declared that  when he woke in the morning at about half-past seven there was no smell  of chloroform in the room. However, the proceedings of the daring thief  certainly pointed to the use of an anaesthetic. An examination of the  premises brought to light the fact that the burglar had, as in Mr.  Knopf's house, used the glass-panelled door from the garden as a means  of entrance, but in this instance he had carefully cut out the pane of  glass with a diamond, slipped the bolts, turned the key, and walked in.    \"'Which among your servants knew that you had the diamonds in your house  last night, Mr. Shipman?' asked the detective.    \"'Not one, I should say,' replied the jeweller, 'though, perhaps, the  parlourmaid, whilst waiting at table, may have heard me and Mr. Knopf  discussing our bargain.'    \"'Would you object to my searching all your servants' boxes?'    \"'Certainly not. They would not object, either, I am sure. They are  perfectly honest.'    \"The searching of servants' belongings is invariably a useless  proceeding,\" added the man in the corner, with a shrug of the shoulders.  \"No one, not even a latter-day domestic, would be fool enough to keep  stolen property in the house. However, the usual farce was gone through,  with more or less protest on the part of Mr. Shipman's servants, and  with the usual result.    \"The jeweller could give no further information; the detective and  inspector, to do them justice, did their work of investigation minutely  and, what is more, intelligently. It seemed evident, from their  deductions, that the burglar had commenced proceedings on No. 26,  Phillimore Terrace, and had then gone on, probably climbing over the  garden walls between the houses to No. 22, where he was almost caught in  the act by Robertson. The facts were simple enough, but the mystery  remained as to the individual who had managed to glean the information  of the presence of the diamonds in both the houses, and the means which  he had adopted to get that information. It was obvious that the thief or  thieves knew more about Mr. Knopf's affairs than Mr. Shipman's, since  they had known how to use Mr. Emile Knopf's name in order to get his  brother out of the way.    \"It was now nearly ten o'clock, and the detectives, having taken leave  of Mr. Shipman, went back to No. 22, in order to ascertain whether Mr.  Knopf had come back; the door was opened by the old charwoman, who said  that her master had returned, and was having some breakfast in the  dining-room.    \"Mr. Ferdinand Knopf was a middle-aged man, with sallow complexion,  black hair and beard, of obviously Hebrew extraction. He spoke with a  marked foreign accent, but very courteously, to the two officials, who,  he begged, would excuse him if he went on with his breakfast.    \"'I was fully prepared to hear the bad news,' he explained, 'which my  man Robertson told me when I arrived. The letter I got last night was a  bogus one; there is no such person as J. Collins, M.D. My brother had  never felt better in his life. You will, I am sure, very soon trace the  cunning writer of that epistle--ah! but I was in a rage, I can tell  you, when I got to the Metropole at Brighton, and found that Emile, my  brother, had never heard of any Doctor Collins.    \"'The last train to town had gone, although I raced back to the station  as hard as I could. Poor old Robertson, he has a terrible cold. Ah yes!  my loss! it is for me a very serious one; if I had not made that lucky  bargain with Mr. Shipman last night I should, perhaps, at this moment be  a ruined man.    \"'The stones I had yesterday were, firstly, some magnificent Brazilians;  these I sold to Mr. Shipman mostly. Then I had some very good Cape  diamonds--all gone; and some quite special Parisians, of wonderful work  and finish, entrusted to me for sale by a great French house. I tell  you, sir, my loss will be nearly L10,000 altogether. I sell on  commission, and, of course, have to make good the loss.'    \"He was evidently trying to bear up manfully, and as a business man  should, under his sad fate. He refused in any way to attach the  slightest blame to his old and faithful servant Robertson, who had  caught, perhaps, his death of cold in his zeal for his absent master. As  for any hint of suspicion falling even remotely upon the man, the very  idea appeared to Mr. Knopf absolutely preposterous.    \"With regard to the old charwoman, Mr. Knopf certainly knew nothing  about her, beyond the fact that she had been recommended to him by one  of the tradespeople in the neighbourhood, and seemed perfectly honest,  respectable, and sober.    \"About the tramp Mr. Knopf knew still less, nor could he imagine how he,  or in fact anybody else, could possibly know that he happened to have  diamonds in his house that night.    \"This certainly seemed the great hitch in the case.    \"Mr. Ferdinand Knopf, at the instance of the police, later on went to  the station and had a look at the suspected tramp. He declared that he  had never set eyes on him before.    \"Mr. Shipman, on his way home from business in the afternoon, had done  likewise, and made a similar statement.    \"Brought before the magistrate, the tramp gave but a poor account of  himself. He gave a name and address, which latter, of course, proved to  be false. After that he absolutely refused to speak. He seemed not to  care whether he was kept in custody or not. Very soon even the police  realized that, for the present, at any rate, nothing could be got out of  the suspected tramp.    \"Mr. Francis Howard, the detective, who had charge of the case, though  he would not admit it even to himself, was at his wits' ends. You must  remember that the burglary, through its very simplicity, was an  exceedingly mysterious affair. The constable, D 21, who had stood in  Adam and Eve Mews, presumably while Mr. Knopf's house was being robbed,  had seen no one turn out from the _cul-de-sac_ into the main passage of  the mews.    \"The stables, which immediately faced the back entrance of the  Phillimore Terrace houses, were all private ones belonging to residents  in the neighbourhood. The coachmen, their families, and all the grooms  who slept in the stablings were rigidly watched and questioned. One and  all had seen nothing, heard nothing, until Robertson's shrieks had  roused them from their sleep.    \"As for the letter from Brighton, it was absolutely commonplace, and  written upon note-paper which the detective, with Machiavellian cunning,  traced to a stationer's shop in West Street. But the trade at that  particular shop was a very brisk one; scores of people had bought  note-paper there, similar to that on which the supposed doctor had  written his tricky letter. The handwriting was cramped, perhaps a  disguised one; in any case, except under very exceptional circumstances,  it could afford no clue to the identity of the thief. Needless to say,  the tramp, when told to write his name, wrote a totally different and  absolutely uneducated hand.    \"Matters stood, however, in the same persistently mysterious state when  a small discovery was made, which suggested to Mr. Francis Howard an  idea, which, if properly carried out, would, he hoped,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10574"],[0,"The History of England, Volume I (#6)"],[1," Roman tribunes, had  already attacked with success several settlements of their insulting  conquerors.  Suetonius hastened to the protection of London, which was  already a flourishing Roman colony; but he found, on his arrival, that  it would be requisite for the general safety to abandon that place to  the merciless fury of the enemy.  London was reduced to ashes; such of  the inhabitants as remained in it were cruelly massacred; the Romans  and all strangers, to the number of 70,000, were every where put to  the sword without distinction; and the Britons, by rendering the war  thus bloody, seemed determined to cut off all hopes of peace or com-  position with the enemy.  But this cruelty was revenged by Suetonius  in a great and decisive battle, where 80,000 of the Britons are said  to have .perished; and Boadicea herself; rather than fall into the  hands of the enraged victor, put an end to her own life by poison [m].  Nero soon after recalled Suetonius from a government, where, by  suffering and inflicting so many severities, he was judged improper  for composing the angry and alarmed minds of the inhabitants.  After  some interval, Cerealis received the command from Vespasian, and by  his bravery propagated the terror of the Roman arms.  Julius Frontinus  succeeded Cerealis both in authority and in reputation: but the  general who finally established the dominion of the Romans in this  island was Julius Agricola, who governed it in the reigns of  Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, and distinguished himself in that  scene of action.  [FN [m] Tacit. Ann. lib. 14]    This great commander formed a regular plan for subduing Britain, and  rendering the acquisition useful to the conquerors.  He carried his  victorious arms northwards, defeated the Britons in every encounter,  pierced into the inaccessible forests and mountains of Caledonia,  reduced every state to subjection in the southern part of the island,  and chased before him all the men of fiercer and more intractable  spirits, who deemed war and death itself less intolerable than  servitude under the victors.  He even defeated them in a decisive  action, which they fought under Galgacus, their leader; and having  fixed a chain of garrisons between the firths of Clyde and Forth, he  thereby cut off the ruder and more barren parts of the island, and  secured the Roman province from the incursions of the barbarous  inhabitants [n].  [FN [n] Tacit Agr.]    During these military enterprises, he neglected not the arts of peace.  He introduced laws and civility among the Britons, taught them to  desire and raise all the conveniences of life, reconciled them to the  Roman language and manners, instructed them in letters and science,  and employed every expedient to render those chains which he had  forged both easy and agreeable to them [o].  The inhabitants, having  experienced how unequal their own force was to resist that of the  Romans, acquiesced in the dominion of their masters, and were  gradually incorporated as a part of that mighty empire.  [FN [o] Ibid.]    This was the last durable conquest made by the Romans; and Britain,  once subdued, gave no farther inquietude to the victor.  Caledonia  alone, defended by its barren mountains, and by the contempt which the  Romans entertained for it, sometimes infested the more cultivated  parts of the island by the incursions of its inhabitants.  The better  to secure the frontiers of the empire, Adrian, who visited this  island, built a rampart between the river Tyne and the firth of  Solway: Lollius Urbicus, under Antoninus Pius, erected one in the  place where Agricola had formerly established his garrisons: Severus,  who made an expedition into Britain, and carried his arms to the more  northern extremity of it, added new fortifications to the walls of  Adrian; and, during the reigns of all the Roman emperors, such a  profound tranquillity prevailed in Britain, that little mention is  made of the affairs of that island by any historian.  The only  incidents which occur are some seditions or rebellions of the Roman  legions quartered there, and some usurpations of the Imperial dignity  by the Roman governors.  The natives, disarmed, dispirited, and  submissive, had lost all desire, and even idea of their former liberty  and independence.    But the period was now come when that enormous fabric of the Roman  empire, which had diffused slavery and oppression, together with peace  and civility, over so considerable a part of the globe, was  approaching towards it final dissolution.  Italy and the centre of the  empire, removed, during so many ages, from all concern in the wars,  had entirely lost the military spirit, and were peopled by an  enervated race, equally disposed to submit to a foreign yoke, or to  the tyranny of their own rulers.  The emperors found themselves  obliged to recruit their legions from the frontier provinces, where  the genius of war, though languishing, was not totally extinct; and  these mercenary forces, careless of laws, and civil institutions,  established a military government, no less dangerous to the sovereign  than to the people.  The further progress of the same disorders  introduced the bordering barbarians into the service of the Romans;  and those fierce nations, having now added discipline to their native  bravery, could no longer be restrained by the impotent policy of the  emperors, who were accustomed to employ one in the destruction of the  others.  Sensible of their own force, and allured by the prospect of  so rich a prize, the northern barbarians, in the reign of Arcadius and  Honorius, assailed at once all the frontiers of the Roman empire; and  having first satiated their avidity by plunder, began to think of  fixing a settlement in the wasted provinces.  The more distant  barbarians, who occupied the deserted habitations of the former,  advanced in their acquisitions, and pressed with their incumbent  weight the Roman state, already unequal to the load which it  sustained.  Instead of arming the people in their own defence, the  emperors recalled all the distant legions, in whom alone they could  repose confidence; and collected the whole military force for the  defence of the capital and centre of the empire.  The necessity of  self-preservation had superseded the ambition of power; and the  ancient point of honour never to contract the limits of the empire  could no longer be attended to in this desperate extremity.    Britain by its situation was removed from the fury of these barbarous  incursions; and being also a remote province, not much valued by the  Romans, the legions which defended it were carried over to the  protection of Italy and Gaul.  But that province, though secured by  the sea against the inroads of the greater tribes of barbarians, found  enemies on its frontiers, who took advantage of its present  defenceless situation.  The Picts and Scots, who dwelt in the northern  parts, beyond the wall of Antoninus, made incursions upon their  peaceable and effeminate neighbours; and besides the temporary  depredations which they committed, these combined nations threatened  the whole province with subjection, or what the inhabitants more  dreaded, with plunder and devastation.  The Picts seem to have been a  tribe of the native British race, who, having been chased into the  northern parts by the conquest of Agricola, had there intermingled  with the ancient inhabitants: the Scots were derived from the same  Celtic origin, had first been established in Ireland, had migrated to  the north-west coasts of this island, and had long been accustomed, as  well from their old as their new seats, to infest the Roman province  by piracy and rapine [p].  These tribes, finding their more opulent  neighbours exposed to invasion, soon broke over the Roman wall, no  longer defended by the Roman arms; and, though a contemptible enemy in  themselves, met with no resistance from the unwarlike inhabitants.  The Britons, accustomed to have recourse to the emperors for defence  as well as government, made supplications to Rome; and one legion was  sent over for their protection.  This force was an overmatch for the  barbarians, repelled their invasion, routed them in every engagement,  and having chased them into their ancient limits, returned in triumph  to the defence of the southern provinces of the empire [q].  Their  retreat brought on a new invasion of the enemy.  The Britons made  again an application to Rome, and again obtained the assistance of a  legion, which proved effectual for their relief: but the Romans,  reduced to extremities at home, and fatigued with those distant  expeditions, informed the Britons that they must no longer look to  them for succour, exhorted them to arm in their own defence, and urged  that, as they were now their own masters, it became them to protect by  their valour that independence which their ancient lords had conferred  upon them [r].  That they might leave the island with the better  grace, the Romans assisted them in erecting anew the wall of Severus,  which was built entirely of stone, and which the Britons had not at  that time artificers skilful enough to repair [s].  And having done  this last good office to the inhabitants, they bid a final adieu to  Britain, about the year 448; after being masters of the more  considerable part of it during the course of near four centuries.
