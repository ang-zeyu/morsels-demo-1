[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13402"],[0,"The Hindu-Yogi Science of Breath (#6)"],[1,"reathing, the Yogis know it to be but a part  of a system which they have used for centuries and which they know as  \"The Complete Breath.\" It must be admitted, however, that one must be  acquainted with the principles of Low Breathing before he can grasp  the idea of Complete Breathing.    Let us again consider the diaphragm. What is it? We have seen that it  is the great partition muscle, which separates the chest and its  contents from the abdomen and its contents. When at rest it presents a  concave surface to the abdomen. That is, the diaphragm as viewed from  the abdomen would seem like the sky as viewed from the earth--the  interior of an arched surface. Consequently the side of the diaphragm  toward the chest organs is like a protruding rounded surface--like a  hill. When the diaphragm is brought into use the hill formation is  lowered and the diaphragm presses upon the abdominal organs and forces  out the abdomen.    In Low Breathing, the lungs are given freer play than in the methods  already mentioned, and consequently more air is inhaled. This fact has  led the majority of Western writers to speak and write of Low  Breathing (which they call Abdominal Breathing) as the highest and  best method known to science. But the Oriental Yogi has long known of  a better method, and some few Western writers have also recognized  this fact. The trouble with all methods of breathing, other than \"Yogi  Complete Breathing\" is that in none of these methods do the lungs  become filled with air--at the best only a portion of the lung space  is filled, even in Low Breathing. High Breathing fills only the upper  portion of the lungs. Mid Breathing fills only the middle and a  portion of the upper parts. Low Breathing fills only the lower and  middle parts. It is evident that any method that fills the entire lung  space must be far preferable to those filling only certain parts Any  method which will fill the entire lung space must be the greatest  value to Man in the way of allowing him to absorb the greatest  quantity of oxygen and to store away the greatest amount of prana. The  Complete Breath is known to the Yogis to be the best method of  respiration known to science.      THE YOGI COMPLETE BREATH.    Yogi Complete Breathing includes all the good points of High  Breathing, Mid Breathing and Low Breathing, with the objectionable  features of each eliminated. It brings into play the entire  respiratory apparatus, every part of the lungs, every air-cell, every  respiratory muscle. The entire respiratory organism responds to this  method of breathing, and the maximum amount of benefit is derived from  the minimum expenditure of energy. The chest cavity is increased to  its normal limits in all directions and every part of the machinery  performs its natural work and functions.    One of the most important features of this method of breathing is the  fact that the respiratory muscles are fully called into play, whereas  in the other forms of breathing only a portion of these muscles are so  used. In Complete Breathing, among other muscles, those controlling  the ribs are actively used, which increases the space in which the  lungs may expand, and also gives the proper support to the organs when  needed, Nature availing herself of the perfection of the principle of  leverage in this process. Certain muscles hold the lower ribs firmly  in position, while other muscles bend them outward.    Then again, in this method, the diaphragm is under perfect control and  is able to perform its functions properly, and in such manner as to  yield the maximum degree of service.    In the rib-action, above alluded to, the lower ribs are controlled by  the diaphragm which draws them slightly downward, while other muscles  hold them in place and the intercostal muscles force them outward,  which combined action increases the mid-chest cavity to its maximum.  In addition to this muscular action, the upper ribs are also lifted  and forced outward by the intercostal muscles, which increases the  capacity of the upper chest to its fullest extent.    If you have studied the special features of the four given methods of  breathing, you will at once see that the Complete Breath comprises all  the advantageous features of the three other methods, plus the  reciprocal advantages accruing from the combined action of the  high-chest, mid-chest, and diaphragmatic regions, and the normal  rhythm thus obtained.    In our next chapter, we will take up the Complete Breath in practice,  and will give full directions for the acquirement of this superior  method of breathing, with exercises, etc.          CHAPTER VIII.      HOW TO ACQUIRE THE YOGI COMPLETE BREATH.    The Yogi Complete Breath is the fundamental breath of the entire Yogi  Science of Breath, and the student must fully acquaint himself with  it, and master it perfectly before he can hope to obtain results from  the other forms of breath-mentioned and given in this book. He should  not be content with half-learning it, but should go to work in earnest  until it becomes his natural method of breathing. This will require  work, time and patience, but without these things nothing is ever  accomplished. There is no royal road to the Science of Breath, and the  student must be prepared to practice and study in earnest if he expect  to receive results. The results obtained by a complete mastery of the  Science of Breath are great, and no one who has attained them would  willingly go back to the old methods, and he will tell his friends  that he considers himself amply repaid for all his work. We say these  things now, that you may fully understand the necessity and importance  of mastering this fundamental method of Yogi Breathing, instead of  passing it by and trying some of the attractive looking variations  given later on in this book. Again, we say to you: Start right, and  right results will follow; but neglect your foundations and your  entire building will topple over sooner or later.    Perhaps the better way to teach you how to develop the Yogi Complete  Breath, would be to give you simple directions regarding the breath  itself, and then follow up the same with general remarks concerning  it, and then later on giving exercises for developing the chest,  muscles and lungs which have been allowed to remain in an undeveloped  condition by imperfect methods of breathing. Right here we wish to say  that this Complete Breath is not a forced or abnormal thing, but on  the contrary is a going back to first principles--a return to Nature.  The healthy adult savage and the healthy infant of civilization both  breathe in this manner, but civilized man has adopted unnatural  methods of living, clothing, etc., and has lost his birthright. And we  wish to remind the reader that the Complete Breath does not  necessarily call for the complete filling of the lungs at every  inhalation. One may inhale the average amount of air, using the  Complete Breathing Method and distributing the air inhaled, be the  quantity large or small, to all parts of the lungs. But one should  inhale a series of full Complete Breaths several times a day, whenever  opportunity offers, in order to keep the system in good order and  condition.    The following simple exercise will give you a clear idea of what the  Complete Breath is:         (1) Stand or sit erect. Breathing through the nostrils,       inhale steadily, first filling the lower part of the lungs,       which is accomplished by bringing into play the diaphragm,       which descending exerts a gentle pressure on the abdominal       organs, pushing forward the front walls of the abdomen. Then       fill the middle part of the lungs, pushing out the lower       ribs, breast-bone and chest. Then fill the higher portion of       the lungs, protruding the upper chest, thus lifting the       chest, including the upper six or seven pairs of ribs. In       the final movement, the lower part of the abdomen will be       slightly drawn in, which movement gives the lungs a support       and also helps to fill the highest part of the lungs.         At first reading it may appear that this breath consists of       three distinct movements. This, however, is not the correct       idea. The inhalation is continuous, the entire chest cavity       from the lowered diaphragm to the highest point of the chest       in the region of the collar-bone, being expanded with a       uniform movement. Avoid a jerky series of inhalations, and       strive to attain a steady continuous action. Practice will       soon overcome the tendency to divide the inhalation into       three movements, and will result in a uniform continuous       breath. You will be able to complete the inhalation in a       couple of seconds after a little practice.         (2) Retain the breath a few seconds.         (3) Exhale quite slowly, holding the chest in a firm       position, and having the abdomen in a little and lifting it       upward slowly as the air leaves the lungs. When the air is       entirely exhaled, relax the chest and abdomen. A little       practice will render this part of the exercise easy, and the       movement once acquired will be afterwards performed almost       automatically.    It will be seen that by this method of breathing all parts of the  respiratory apparatus is brought into action, and all parts of the  lungs, including the most remote air cells, are exercised. The chest  cavity is expanded in all directions. You will also notice that the  Complete Breath is really a combination of Low, Mid and High Breaths,  succeeding each other rapidly in the order given, in such a manner as  to form one uniform, continuous, complete breath.    You will find it quite a help to you if you will practice this breath  before a large mirror, placing the hands lightly over the abdomen so  that you may feel the movements. At the end of the inhalation, it is  well to occasionally slightly elevate the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13407"],[0,"A Series of Lessons in Gnani Yoga: The Yoga of Wisdom (#6)"],[1,"ess, or electrical discharges. They may  also be \"killed\" and future growth prevented in this manner. Surely  this looks like \"Life,\" does it not?    To realize the importance of this idea of life among the crystals, we  must remember that our hardest rocks and metals are composed of  crystals, and that the dirt and earth upon which we grow and live are  but crumbled rock and miniature crystals. Therefore the very dust under  our feet is alive. _There is nothing dead._ There is no transformation  of \"dead matter\" into live plant matter, and then into live animal  matter. The chemicals are alive, and from chemical to man's body there  is but a continuous change of shape and form of living matter. Any  man's body, decomposing, is again resolved into chemicals, and the  chain begins over again. Merely changes in living forms--that's all, so  far as the bodies are concerned.    Nature furnishes us with many examples of this presence of life in the  inorganic world. We have but to look around to see the truth of the  statement that All is Alive. There is that which is known as the  \"fatigue of elasticity\" in metals. Razors get tired, and require a  rest. Tuning forks lose their powers of vibration, to a degree, and  have to be given a vacation. 'Machinery in mills and manufactories  needs an occasional day off. Metals are subject to disease and  infection, and have been poisoned and restored by antidotes. Window  glass, especially stained glass, is subject to a disease spreading from  pane to pane.    Men accustomed to handling and using tools and machinery naturally drop  into the habit of speaking of these things as if they were alive. They  seem to recognize the presence of \"feeling\" in tools or machine, and to  perceive in each a sort of \"character\" or personality, which must be  respected, humored, or coaxed in order to get the best results.    Perhaps the most valuable testimony along these lines, and which goes  very far toward proving the centuries-old theories of the Yogis  regarding Omnipresent Life, comes from Prof. J. Chunder Bose, of the  Calcutta University, a Hindu educated in the English Universities,  under the best teachers, and who is now a leading scientific authority  in the western world, tie has given to the world some very valuable  scientific information along these lines in his book entitled  \"_Response in the Living and Non-living_,\" which has caused the widest  comment and created the greatest interest among the highest scientific  authorities. His experiments along the lines of the gathering of  evidence of life in the inorganic forms have revolutionized the  theories of modern science, and have done much to further the idea that  life is present everywhere, and that there is no such thing as dead  matter.    He bases his work upon the theory that the best and only true test for  the presence of life in matter is the response of matter to external  stimulus. Proceeding from this fundamental theory he has proven by  in-numerable experiments that so-called inorganic matter, minerals,  metals, etc., give a response to such stimulus, which response is  similar, if not identical, to the response of the matter composing the  bodies of plants, animals, men.    He devised delicate apparatus for the measurement of the response to  the outside stimulus, the degree, and other evidence being recorded in  traces on a revolving cylinder. The tracings or curves obtained from  tin and other metals, when compared with those obtained from living  muscle, were found to be identical. He used a galvanometer, a very  delicate and accurate scientific instrument, in his experiments. This  instrument is so finely adjusted that the faintest current will cause a  deflection of the registering needle, which is delicately swung on a  tiny pivot. If the galvanometer be attached to a human nerve, and the  end of the nerve be irritated, the needle will register.    Prof. Bose found that when he attached the galvanometer to bars of  various metals they gave a similar response when struck or twisted. The  greater the irritation applied to the metal, the greater the response  registered by the instrument. The analogy between the response of the  metal and that of the living muscle was startling. For instance, just  as in the case of the living animal muscle or nerve matter, the  response becomes fatigued, so in the case of the metal the curve  registered by the needle became fainter and still fainter, as the bar  became more and more fatigued by the continued irritation. And again,  just after such fatigue the muscle would become rested, and would again  respond actively, so would the metal when given a chance to recuperate.    Tetanus due to shocks constantly repeated, was caused and recovered.  Metals recorded evidences of fatigue. Drugs caused identical effects on  metals and animals--some exciting; some depressing; some killing. Some  poisonous chemicals killed pieces of metal, rendering them immobile and  therefore incapable of registering records on the apparatus. In some  cases antidotes were promptly administered, and saved the life of the  metal.    Prof. Bose also conducted experiments on plants in the same way. Pieces  of vegetable matter were found to be capable of stimulation, fatigue,  excitement, depression, poison. Mrs. Annie Besant, who witnessed some  of these experiments in Calcutta, has written as follows regarding the  experiments on plant life: \"There is something rather pathetic in  seeing the way in which the tiny spot of light which records the pulses  in the plant, travels in ever weaker and weaker curves, when the plant  is under the influence of poison, then falls into a final despairing  straight line, and--stops. One feels as though a murder has been  committed--as indeed it has.\"    In one of Prof. Bose's public experiments he clearly demonstrated that  a bar of iron was fully as sensitive as the human body, and that it  could be irritated and stimulated in the same way, and finally could be  poisoned and killed. \"Among such phenomena,\" he asks, \"how can we draw  the line of demarkation, and say, 'Here the physical ends, and there  the physiological begins'? No such barrier exists.\" According to his  theory, which agrees with the oldest occult theories, by the way, life  is present in every object and form of Nature, and all forms respond to  external stimulus, which response is a proof of the presence of life in  the form.    Prof. Bose's great book is full of the most startling results of  experiments. He proves that the metals manifest something like sleep;  can be killed; exhibit torpor and sluggishness; get tired or lazy; wake  up; can be roused into activity; may be stimulated, strengthened,  weakened; suffer from extreme cold and heat; may be drugged or  intoxicated, the different metals manifesting a different response to  certain drugs, just as different men and animals manifest a varying  degree of similar resistance. The response of a piece of steel  subjected to the influence of a chemical poison shows a gradual  fluttering and weakening until it finally dies away, just as animal  matter does when similarly poisoned. When revived in time by an  antidote, the recovery was similarly gradual in both metal and muscle.  A remarkable fact is noted by the scientist when he tells us that the  very poisons that kill the metals are themselves alive and may be  killed, drugged, stimulated, etc., showing the same response as in the  case of the metals, proving the existence in them of the same life that  is in the metals and animal matter that they influence.    Of course when these metals are \"killed\" there is merely a killing of  the metal as metal--the atoms and principles of which the metal is  composed remaining fully alive and active, just as is the case with the  atom of the human body after the soul passes out--the body is as much  alive after death as during the life of the person, the activity of the  parts being along the lines of dissolution instead of construction in  that case.    We hear much of the claims of scientists who announce that they are on  the eve of \"_creating_ life\" from non-living matter. This is all  nonsense--life can come only from life. Life from non-life is an  absurdity. And all Life comes from the One Life underlying All. But it  is true that Science has done, is doing, and will do, something very  much like \"creating life,\" but of course this is merely changing the  form of Life into other forms--the lesser form into the higher--just as  one produces a plant from a seed, or a fruit from a plant. The Life is  always there, and responds to the proper stimulus and conditions.    A number of scientists are working on the problem of generating living  forms from inorganic matter. The old idea of \"spontaneous generation,\"  for many years relegated to the scrap-pile of Science, is again coming  to the front. Although the theory of Evolution compels its adherents to  accept the idea that at one time in the past living forms sprung from  the non-living (so-called), yet it has been generally believed that the  conditions which brought about this stage of evolution has forever  passed. But the indications now all point to the other view that this  stage of evolution is, and always has been, in operation, and that new  forms of life are constantly evolving from the inorganic forms.  \"Creation,\" so-called (although the word is an absurdity from the Yogi  point of view), is constantly being performed.    Dr. Charlton Bastian, of London, Eng., has long been a prominent  advocate of this theory of continuous spontaneous generation. Laughed  down and considered defeated by the leading scientific minds of a  generation ago, he still pluckily kept at work, and his recent books  were like bombshells in the orthodox scientific camp. He has taken more  than five thousand photo-micrographs, all showing most startling facts  in connection with the origin of living forms from"]]]
