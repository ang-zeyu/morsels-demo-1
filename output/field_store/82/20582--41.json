Halted at the upper boundary of the forest region, to refresh our  mules, and exchange our light clothing for garments of a warmer  texture, as the wind now blew cool and somewhat chilly; for the  temperature of this spot was about 50 deg., while that of Catania, which  we had only left a few hours ago, was about 84 deg. Fahr.    The road, on leaving our resting-place, became tedious and cheerless;  hardly any vegetation was discoverable, and still wilder regions  appeared above us. The path now lay over masses of rough lava; so much  so, that at times it became necessary to dismount and actually drag  our jaded animals over the rugged precipices which obstructed our  progress: the intricacy of the path required us to follow one another  very closely, that we might not lose the track, which became so  tortuous in its course, as would puzzle any one but a muleteer  accustomed to the road to find the clue of this volcanic labyrinth in  the darkness of night.    After much anxious travelling over wastes of cinders and black sand,  we seemed to be approaching near the wished-for summit; when, about  two o'clock, A.M., the moon, now shorn of her beams, queen like, arose  behind the bifurcated summit of Etna; her cheering light was very  grateful to us in this wild spot. The awful cone of the mountain  pillowed against the heavens, and emitting clouds of silvery white  smoke from its burning crater, had a grand effect at this solemn hour  of the night.    At three o'clock, arrived at the Casa Inglese, a rude hut built by the  English troops when stationed in Sicily, during the late war. Here it  became again necessary to halt a little to put on some extra clothing.  As soon as this was accomplished, the signal for the ascent was made  by the guides giving each person of the party a long staff, to assist  him in clambering the steeps, as the mules could not proceed any  further, owing to the nature and fatigue of the ascent. The first  portion of the road lay over large broken masses of lava, most  wearisome to scramble over. On approaching nearer the apex, the path  was over cinders, fine black sand, and scoria. In wading through this  compound the ascent became so difficult and fatiguing, that we were  all under the necessity of reposing every twenty or thirty yards,  tormented by the sulphureous vapour, which rendered respiration  painful, and was even less supportable than the abruptness of the  mountain path!    At length, after somewhat more than an hour's walk, the most harassing  that can be imagined, we arrived at the top just as the day began to  dawn. To paint the feelings at this dizzy height, requires the pen of  poetic inspiration; or to describe the scene presented to mortal  gaze, when thus looking down with fearful eye on the almost boundless  prospect beneath! The blue expanded ocean, fields, woods, cities,  rivers, mountains, and all the wonted charms of the terrestrial world,  had a magic effect, when viewed by the help of the nascent light;  while hard by yawned that dreadful crater of centuries untold,  evolving thick sulphureous clouds of white smoke, which rolling down  the mountain's side in terrific grandeur, at length formed one vast  column for many miles in extent across the sky. Anon the mountain  growled awfully in its inmost recesses, and the earth was slightly  convulsed! We now attempted to descend a short distance within  the crater; the guides, timid of its horrors, did not relish the  undertaking, but were induced at length, and conducted the party  behind some heaps of lava, from whence was a grand view of this  awful cavern. The noise within the gulf resembled loud continuous  thunderings, and after each successive explosion, there issued columns  of white, and sometimes of black smoke.    The crater presents the appearance of an inverted cone, the interior  part of which is covered with crystallizations of salts and sulphur,  of various brilliant hues--red appeared to predominate, or rather  a deep orange colour. Writers vary much in their accounts as to  the circumference of the crater. Captain Smyth, R.N., who had an  opportunity to ascertain it correctly, describes it as an oval,  stretching from E. and by N. to W., and by S. with a conjugate  diameter of four hundred and ninety-three yards; the transverse he  was prevented from ascertaining by a dense cloud that arose before his  operations were completed. It was soon requisite for us to retire from  this spot, as the smoke began to increase, and our guides said that  some adventurous travellers had lost their lives by approaching too  near, and were either blown into the abyss below by the violence  of the wind, which is generally very strong at this elevation, or  suffocated by a sudden burst of the sulphureous vapour.    The Regione Deserta, or desolate region of Etna, first attracts the  eye, marked in winter by a circle of ice and snow, but now (July)  by cinders and black sand. In the midst the great crater rears its  burning head, and the regions of intense heat and extreme cold shake  hands together. The eye soon becomes satiated with its wildness, and  turns with delight on the Sylvana region, which, with its magnificent  zone of forest trees, embraces the mountain completely round: in many  parts of this delightful tract are seen hills, now covered with  the most luxuriant vegetation, that have been formed by different  eruptions of Etna. This girdle is succeeded by another still richer,  called the Regione Culta, abundant in every fruit or grain that man  can desire: the small rivers Semetus and Alcantara intersect these  fertile fields; beyond this the whole of Sicily, with its cities,  towns, and villages, its corn-fields and vineyards in almost endless  perspective, charm and delight the senses.    The summit of the mountain is composed of scoria, and crystallizations  of sulphur, with here and there heaps of lava; wherever a stick is  thrust in, the opening immediately emits a volume of white smoke,  and if the hand be applied to the aperture, it is soon withdrawn on  account of the great heat. The mean temperature of the summit, during  the months of July and August, is 37 deg. Fahr. After having remained  about an hour, descended to the Casa Inglese. After an hour's repose,  proceeded downwards, visited the Philosopher's Tower, as it is called,  which tradition says was constructed by Empedocles while he was  studying the various phenomena of Etna.    About a mile or two from this spot, there is a grand view of the  Val di Bove. The foreground consists of lava, forming the face of an  enormous precipice, at the bottom of which is seen a lovely valley,  gradually sloping down towards the coast, embracing the three several  regions of the mountain, to which the purple wave of the Mediterranean  forms a noble boundary: nothing can be more varied, rich, and  beautiful than this scene, as it comprises every object necessary to  form a perfect landscape.    It was interesting to notice the gradual increase of vegetation during  the descent. The Senecio Christhenifolius grows at the elevation of  8,830 feet, the Juniperus Communis commences at 6,800. Then follow the  Pinus Sylv., Betula Alba, Quercus Robur, and the Fagus Sylvaticus. The  olive is seen at the altitude of 3,000 feet, and the vines flourish as  high as 5,000 feet.--_United Service Journal._        [In a clever paper on the geographical position and history of      Active Volcanoes, contributed by W.M. Higgins, Esq. F.G.S. and      J.W. Draper, Esq. to the _Magazine of Natural History_, is the      following outline of Etna.]    Etna is entirely composed of volcanic rocks, and rises in imposing  grandeur to the height of 10,000 ft. above the level of the sea. It is  about 180 miles in circumferences, and is surrounded on every hand  by apparently small volcanic cones, though of no inconsiderable size,  which tend in a great degree to increase the apparent dimensions of  the central mountain. Some of these cones are covered with vegetation,  but others are arid and bare. From this variety in the progress of  vegetation, some persons have endeavoured to calculate the relative  ages of the cones; but these opinions are exceedingly vague, as it  requires a longer period to form a soil on some lavas than on  others. The earliest historical notice we have of this mountain is by  Thucydides, who states that there were three eruptions previous to the  Peloponnesian war (431 B.C.), to one of which Pindar alludes in his  first Pythian Ode. In the year 396 B.C. the volcano was again active;  and according to Diodorus Siculus, the Carthaginian army was stopped  in its march against Syracuse by the flowing lava. But let it suffice  to say, that ten eruptions previous to, and forty-eight subsequent to,  the Christian era, have been recorded; some when the mountain was  in the phase of moderate activity, and others when in the phase of  prolonged intermittence.           *       *       *       *       *      THE SECRET LOVER.

And the king then took Vidura on his lap and smelt his  head, and said, 'Forgive me, O sinless one, the words in which thou wert  addressed by me!' And Vidura said, 'O king, I have forgiven thee. Thou  art my superior, worthy of the highest reverence! Here am I, having come  back, eagerly wishing to behold thee! All virtuous men, O tiger among  men, are (instinctively) partial towards those that are distressed!  This, O king, is scarcely the result of deliberation! (My partiality to  the Pandavas proceedeth from this cause)! O Bharata, thy sons are as  dear to me as the sons of Pandu, but as the latter are now in distress,  my heart yearneth after them!'\"    Vaisampayana continued, \"And addressing each other thus in apologetic  speeches, the two illustrious brothers, Vidura and Dhritarashtra, felt  themselves greatly happy!\"      SECTION VII    Vaisampayana said, \"Hearing that Vidura had returned, and that the king  had consoled him, the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra began to burn in  grief. His understanding clouded by ignorance, he summoned the son of  Suvala, and Karna and Dussasana, and addressed them saying, 'The learned  Vidura, the minister of the wise Dhritarashtra, hath returned! The  friend of the sons of Pandu, he is ever engaged in doing what is  beneficial to them. So long as this Vidura doth not succeed in inducing  the king to bring them back, do ye all think of what may benefit me! If  ever I behold the sons of Pritha return to the city, I shall again be  emaciated by renouncing food and drink, even though there be no obstacle  in my path! And I shall either take poison or hang myself, either enter  the pyre or kill myself with my own weapons. But I shall never be able  to behold the sons of Pandu in prosperity!'    \"Sakuni said, 'O king, O lord of the earth, what folly hath taken  possession of thee! The Pandavas have gone to the forest, having given a  particular pledge, so that what thou apprehendest can never take place!  O bull of the Bharata race, the Pandavas ever abide by the truth. They  will never, therefore, accept the words of thy father! If however,  accepting the commands of the king, they come back to the capital,  violating their vow, even this would be our conduct, viz., assuming, an  aspect of neutrality, and in apparent obedience to the will of the  monarch, we will closely watch the Pandavas, keeping our counsels!'    \"Dussasana said, 'O uncle of great intelligence, it is even as thou  sayest! The words of wisdom thou utterest always recommend themselves to  me!' Karna said, 'O Duryodhana, all of us seek to accomplish thy will  and, O king, I see that unanimity at present prevaileth among us! The  sons of Pandu, with passions under complete control, will never return  without passing away the promised period. If, however, they do return  from failing sense, do thou defeat them again at dice.'\"    Vaisampayana said, \"Thus addressed by Karna, king Duryodhana with  cheerless heart, averted his face from his counsellors. Marking all  this, Karna expanding his beautiful eyes, and vehemently gesticulating  in anger, haughtily addressed Duryodhana and Dussasana and Suvala's son  saying, 'Ye princes, know ye my opinion! We are all servants of the king  (Duryodhana) waiting upon him with joined palms! We should, therefore,  do what is agreeable to him! But we are not always able to seek his  welfare with promptness and activity (owing to our dependence on  Dhritarashtra)! But let us now, encased in mail and armed with our  weapons, mount our cars and go in a body to slay the Pandavas now living  in the forest! After the Pandavas have been quieted and after they have  gone on the unknown journey, both ourselves and the sons of  Dhritarashtra will find peace! As long as they are in distress, as long  as they are in sorrow, as long as they are destitute of help, so long  are we a match for them! This is my mind!'    \"Hearing those words of the charioteer's son, they repeatedly applauded  him, and at last exclaimed, 'Very well!' And saying this each of them  mounted his car, and sanguine of success, they rushed in a body to slay  the sons of Pandu. And knowing by his spiritual vision that they had  gone out, the master Krishna-Dwaipayana of pure soul came upon them, and  commanded them to desist. And sending them away, the holy one,  worshipped by all the worlds, quickly appeared before the king whose  intelligence served the purposes of eye-sight, and who was then seated  (at his ease). And the holy one addressed the monarch thus.\"      SECTION VIII    \"Vyasa said, 'O wise Dhritarashtra, hear what I say! I will tell thee  that which is for the great good of all the Kauravas! O thou of mighty  arms, it hath not pleased me that the Pandavas have gone to the forest  dishonestly defeated (at dice) by Duryodhana and others! O Bharata, on  the expiration of the thirteenth year, recollecting all their woes, they  may shower death-dealing weapons, even like virulent poison, upon the  Kauravas! Why doth thy sinful son of wicked heart, ever inflamed with  ire, seek to slay the sons of Pandu for the sake of their kingdom? Let  the fool be restrained; let thy son remain quiet! In attempting to slay  the Pandavas in exile, he will only lose his own life. Thou art as  honest as the wise Vidura, or Bhishma, or ourselves, or Kripa, or Drona.  O thou of great wisdom, dissension with one's own kin are forbidden,  sinful and reprehensible! Therefore, O king, it behoveth thee to desist  from such acts! And, O Bharata, Duryodhana looketh with such jealousy  towards the Pandavas that great harm would be the consequence, if thou  didst not interfere. Or let this wicked son of thine, O monarch, alone  and unaccompanied, himself go to the forest and live with the sons of  Pandu. For then, if the Pandavas, from association, feel an attachment  for Duryodhana, then, O king of men, good fortune may be thine. (This,  however, may not be)! For it hath been heard that one's congenital  nature leaveth him not till death. But what do Bhishma and Drona and  Vidura think? What also dost thou think? That which is beneficial should  be done while there is time, else thy purposes will be unrealised.'\"      SECTION IX    \"Dhritarashtra said, 'O holy one, I did not like this business of  gambling, but, O Muni, I think, I was made to consent to it drawn by  fate! Neither Bhishma, nor Drona, nor Vidura, nor Gandhari liked this  game at dice. No doubt, it was begot of folly. And, O thou who  delightest in the observance of vows, O illustrious one, knowing  everything yet influenced by paternal affection, I am unable to cast off  my senseless son, Duryodhana!'    \"Vyasa said, 'O king, O son of Vichitravirya, what thou sayest is true!  We know it well that a son is the best of all things and that there is  nothing that is so good as a son. Instructed by the tears of Suravi,  Indra came to know that the son surpasseth in worth other valuable  possessions. O monarch, I will, in this connection, relate to thee that  excellent and best of stories, the conversation between Indra and  Suravi. In days of yore, Suravi, the mother of cows was once weeping in  the celestial regions. O child, Indra took compassion upon her, and  asked her, saying, \"O auspicious one! why dost thou weep? Is everything  well with the celestials? Hath any misfortune, ever so little, befallen  the world of men or serpents?\" Suravi replied, \"No evil hath befallen  thee that I perceive. But I am aggrieved on account of my son, and it is  therefore, O Kausika, that I weep! See, O chief of the celestials,  yonder cruel husbandman is belabouring my weak son with the wooden  stick, and oppressing him with the (weight of the) plough, in  consequence of which my child agitated with agony is falling upon the  ground and is at the point of death. At sight of this, O lord of the  celestials, I am filled with compassion, and my mind is agitated! The  one that is the stronger of the pair is bearing his burthen of greater  weight (with ease), but, O Vasava, the other is lean, and weak and is a  mass of veins and arteries! He beareth his burthen with difficulty! And  it is for him that I grieve. See, O Vasava, sore inflicted with the  whip, and harassed exceedingly, he is unable to bear his burthen. And it  is for him that, moved by grief, I weep in heaviness of heart and these  tears of compassion trickle down my eyes!\"    \"'Sakra said, \"O fair one, when thousands of thy son are (daily)  oppressed, why dost thou grieve for one under infliction?\" Suravi  replied. \"Although I have a thousand offspring, yet my affections flow  equally towards all! But, O Sakra, I feel greater compassion for one  that is weak and innocent!\"    \"Vyasa continued, 'Then Indra having heard these words of Suravi, was  much surprised, and O thou of the Kuru race, he became convinced that a  son is dearer than one's life! And the illustrious chastiser of Paka  thereupon suddenly poured there a thick shower and caused obstruction to  the husbandman's work. And as Suravi said, thy affections, O king,  equally flow towards all thy sons. Let them be greater towards those  that are weak! And as my son Pandu is to me, so art thou, O son, and so  also Vidura of profound wisdom! It is out of affection that I tell you  all this! O Bharata, thou art possessed of a hundred and one sons, but  Pandu hath only five. And they are in a bad plight and passing _their_  days in sorrow. _How may they save their lives, how may they thrive_  such thoughts regarding the distressed sons of Pritha continually  agitate my soul! O king of the earth, if thou desirest all the Kauravas  to live, let thy son Duryodhana make peace with the Pandavas!'\"      SECTION X    \"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Muni of profound wisdom, it is even as thou  sayest!
