It was just like a hawk and a pigeon.\"    As he spoke, Sir Nathaniel turned and looked at Mr. Salton--a keen look  which implied a full understanding.    \"Tell us all about it, Adam.  There are still a few minutes before  dinner, and we shall all have better appetites when we have come to some  conclusion on this matter.\"    \"There is nothing to tell, sir; that is the worst of it.  I am bound to  say that there was not a word said that a human being could object to.  He  was very civil, and all that was proper--just what a landlord might be to  a tenant's daughter . . . Yet--yet--well, I don't know how it was, but it  made my blood boil.\"    \"How did the hawk and the pigeon come in?\"  Sir Nathaniel's voice was  soft and soothing, nothing of contradiction or overdone curiosity in it--a  tone eminently suited to win confidence.    \"I can hardly explain.  I can only say that he looked like a hawk and she  like a dove--and, now that I think of it, that is what they each did look  like; and do look like in their normal condition.\"    \"That is so!\" came the soft voice of Sir Nathaniel.    Adam went on:    \"Perhaps that early Roman look of his set me off.  But I wanted to  protect her; she seemed in danger.\"    \"She seems in danger, in a way, from all you young men.  I couldn't help  noticing the way that even you looked--as if you wished to absorb her!\"    \"I hope both you young men will keep your heads cool,\" put in Mr. Salton.  \"You know, Adam, it won't do to have any quarrel between you, especially  so soon after his home-coming and your arrival here.  We must think of  the feelings and happiness of our neighbours; mustn't we?\"    \"I hope so, sir.  I assure you that, whatever may happen, or even  threaten, I shall obey your wishes in this as in all things.\"    \"Hush!\" whispered Sir Nathaniel, who heard the servants in the passage  bringing dinner.    After dinner, over the walnuts and the wine, Sir Nathaniel returned to  the subject of the local legends.    \"It will perhaps be a less dangerous topic for us to discuss than more  recent ones.\"    \"All right, sir,\" said Adam heartily.  \"I think you may depend on me now  with regard to any topic.  I can even discuss Mr. Caswall.  Indeed, I may  meet him to-morrow.  He is going, as I said, to call at Mercy Farm at  three o'clock--but I have an appointment at two.\"    \"I notice,\" said Mr. Salton, \"that you do not lose any time.\"    The two old men once more looked at each other steadily.  Then, lest the  mood of his listener should change with delay, Sir Nathaniel began at  once:    \"I don't propose to tell you all the legends of Mercia, or even to make a  selection of them.  It will be better, I think, for our purpose if we  consider a few facts--recorded or unrecorded--about this neighbourhood.  I  think we might begin with Diana's Grove.  It has roots in the different  epochs of our history, and each has its special crop of legend.  The  Druid and the Roman are too far off for matters of detail; but it seems  to me the Saxon and the Angles are near enough to yield material for  legendary lore.  We find that this particular place had another name  besides Diana's Grove.  This was manifestly of Roman origin, or of  Grecian accepted as Roman.  The other is more pregnant of adventure and  romance than the Roman name.  In Mercian tongue it was 'The Lair of the  White Worm.'  This needs a word of explanation at the beginning.    \"In the dawn of the language, the word 'worm' had a somewhat different  meaning from that in use to-day.  It was an adaptation of the Anglo-Saxon  'wyrm,' meaning a dragon or snake; or from the Gothic 'waurms,' a  serpent; or the Icelandic 'ormur,' or the German 'wurm.'  We gather that  it conveyed originally an idea of size and power, not as now in the  diminutive of both these meanings.  Here legendary history helps us.  We  have the well-known legend of the 'Worm Well' of Lambton Castle, and that  of the 'Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh' near Bamborough.  In both these  legends the 'worm' was a monster of vast size and power--a veritable  dragon or serpent, such as legend attributes to vast fens or quags where  there was illimitable room for expansion.  A glance at a geological map  will show that whatever truth there may have been of the actuality of  such monsters in the early geologic periods, at least there was plenty of  possibility.  In England there were originally vast plains where the  plentiful supply of water could gather.  The streams were deep and slow,  and there were holes of abysmal depth, where any kind and size of  antediluvian monster could find a habitat.  In places, which now we can  see from our windows, were mud-holes a hundred or more feet deep.  Who  can tell us when the age of the monsters which flourished in slime came  to an end?  There must have been places and conditions which made for  greater longevity, greater size, greater strength than was usual.  Such  over-lappings may have come down even to our earlier centuries.  Nay, are  there not now creatures of a vastness of bulk regarded by the generality  of men as impossible?  Even in our own day there are seen the traces of  animals, if not the animals themselves, of stupendous size--veritable  survivals from earlier ages, preserved by some special qualities in their  habitats.  I remember meeting a distinguished man in India, who had the  reputation of being a great shikaree, who told me that the greatest  temptation he had ever had in his life was to shoot a giant snake which  he had come across in the Terai of Upper India.  He was on a  tiger-shooting expedition, and as his elephant was crossing a nullah, it  squealed.  He looked down from his howdah and saw that the elephant had  stepped across the body of a snake which was dragging itself through the  jungle.  'So far as I could see,' he said, 'it must have been eighty or  one hundred feet in length.  Fully forty or fifty feet was on each side  of the track, and though the weight which it dragged had thinned it, it  was as thick round as a man's body.  I suppose you know that when you are  after tiger, it is a point of honour not to shoot at anything else, as  life may depend on it.  I could easily have spined this monster, but I  felt that I must not--so, with regret, I had to let it go.'    \"Just imagine such a monster anywhere in this country, and at once we  could get a sort of idea of the 'worms,' which possibly did frequent the  great morasses which spread round the mouths of many of the great  European rivers.\"    \"I haven't the least doubt, sir, that there may have been such monsters  as you have spoken of still existing at a much later period than is  generally accepted,\" replied Adam.  \"Also, if there were such things,  that this was the very place for them.  I have tried to think over the  matter since you pointed out the configuration of the ground.  But it  seems to me that there is a hiatus somewhere.  Are there not mechanical  difficulties?\"    \"In what way?\"    \"Well, our antique monster must have been mighty heavy, and the distances  he had to travel were long and the ways difficult.  From where we are now  sitting down to the level of the mud-holes is a distance of several  hundred feet--I am leaving out of consideration altogether any lateral  distance.  Is it possible that there was a way by which a monster could  travel up and down, and yet no chance recorder have ever seen him?  Of  course we have the legends; but is not some more exact evidence necessary  in a scientific investigation?\"    \"My dear Adam, all you say is perfectly right, and, were we starting on  such an investigation, we could not do better than follow your reasoning.  But, my dear boy, you must remember that all this took place thousands of  years ago.  You must remember, too, that all records of the kind that  would help us are lacking.  Also, that the places to be considered were  desert, so far as human habitation or population are considered.  In the  vast desolation of such a place as complied with the necessary  conditions, there must have been such profusion of natural growth as  would bar the progress of men formed as we are.  The lair of such a  monster would not have been disturbed for hundreds--or thousands--of  years.  Moreover, these creatures must have occupied places quite  inaccessible to man.  A snake who could make himself comfortable in a  quagmire, a hundred feet deep, would be protected on the outskirts by  such stupendous morasses as now no longer exist, or which, if they exist  anywhere at all, can be on very few places on the earth's surface.  Far  be it from me to say that in more elemental times such things could not  have been.  The condition belongs to the geologic age--the great birth  and growth of the world, when natural forces ran riot, when the struggle  for existence was so savage that no vitality which was not founded in a  gigantic form could have even a possibility of survival.  That such a  time existed, we have evidences in geology, but there only; we can never  expect proofs such as this age demands.  We can only imagine or surmise  such things--or such conditions and such forces as overcame them.\"          CHAPTER VI--HAWK AND PIGEON      At breakfast-time next morning Sir Nathaniel and Mr. Salton were seated  when Adam came hurriedly into the room.    \"Any news?\" asked his uncle mechanically.    \"Four.\"    \"Four what?\" asked Sir Nathaniel.    \"Snakes,\" said Adam, helping himself to a grilled kidney.    \"Four snakes.  I don't understand.\"    \"Mongoose,\" said Adam, and then added explanatorily: \"I was out with the  mongoose just after three.\"    \"Four snakes in one morning!  Why, I didn't know there were so many on  the Brow\"--the local name for the western cliff.  \"I hope that wasn't the  consequence of our talk of last night?\"    \"It was, sir.  But not directly.\"    \"But, God bless my soul, you didn't expect to get a snake like the  Lambton worm, did you?  Why, a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11880"],[0,"Ronicky Doone (#6)"],[1,"the good cheer of  Ronicky was his ignorance of everything except the mountain desert.    \"A river's a river,\" went on Ronicky blandly. \"And it's got a town  beside it, and in the town there's a house that looks over the water.  Why, Bill, she's as good as found!\"    \"New York runs about a dozen miles along the shore of that river,\"  groaned Bill Gregg.    \"A dozen miles!\" gasped Ronicky. He turned in his seat and stared at  his companion. \"Bill, you sure are making a man-sized joke. There  ain't that much city in the world. A dozen miles of houses, one right  next to the other?\"    \"Yep, and one on top of the other. And that ain't all. Start about the  center of that town and swing a twenty-mile line around it, and the  end of the line will be passing through houses most of the way.\"    Ronicky Doone glared at him in positive alarm. \"Well,\" he said,  \"that's different.\"    \"It sure is. I guess we've come on a wild-goose chase, Ronicky,  hunting for a girl named Smith that lives on the bank of the East  River!\" He laughed bitterly.    \"How come you know so much about New York?\" asked Ronicky, eager to  turn the subject of conversation until he could think of something to  cheer his friend.    \"Books,\" said Bill Gregg.    After that there was a long lull in the conversation. That night  neither of them slept long, for every rattle and sway of the train was  telling them that they were rocking along toward an impossible task.  Even the cheer of Ronicky had broken down the next morning, and,  though breakfast in the diner restored some of his confidence, he was  not the man of the day before.    \"Bill,\" he confided, on the way back to their seats from the diner,  \"there must be something wrong with me. What is it?\"    \"I dunno,\" said Bill. \"Why?\"    \"People been looking at me.\"    \"Ain't they got a right to do that?\"    \"Sure they have, in a way. But, when they don't seem to see you when  you see them, and when they begin looking at you out of the corner  of their eyes the minute you turn away, why then it seems to me that  they're laughing at you, Bill.\"    \"What they got to laugh about? I'd punch a gent in the face that  laughed at me!\"    But Ronicky fell into a philosophical brooding. \"It can't be done,  Bill. You can punch a gent for cussing you, or stepping on your foot,  or crowding you, or sneering at you, or talking behind your back, or  for a thousand things. But back here in a crowd you can't fight a gent  for laughing at you. Laughing is outside the law most anywheres, Bill.  It's the one thing you can't answer back except with more laughing.  Even a dog gets sort of sick inside when you laugh at him, and a man  is a pile worse. He wants to kill the gent that's laughing, and he  wants to kill himself for being laughed at. Well, Bill, that's a good  deal stronger than the way they been laughing at me, but they  done enough to make me think a bit. They been looking at three  things--these here spats, the red rim of my handkerchief sticking out  of my pocket, and that soft gray hat, when I got it on.\"    \"Derned if I see anything wrong with your outfit. Didn't they tell you  that that was the style back East, to have spats like that on?\"    \"Sure,\" said Ronicky, \"but maybe they didn't know, or maybe they go  with some, but not with me. Maybe I'm kind of too brown and outdoors  looking to fit with spats and handkerchiefs like this.\"    \"Ronicky,\" said Bill Gregg in admiration, \"maybe you ain't read a  pile, but you figure things out just like a book.\"    Their conversation was cut short by the appearance of a drift of  houses, and then more and more. From the elevated line on which they  ran presently they could look down on block after block of roofs  packed close together, or big business structures, as they reached the  uptown business sections, and finally Ronicky gasped, as they plunged  into utter darkness that roared past the window.    \"We go underground to the station,\" Bill Gregg explained. He was  a little startled himself, but his reading had fortified him to a  certain extent.    \"But is there still some more of New York?\" asked Ronicky humbly.    \"More? We ain't seen a corner of it!\" Bill's superior information made  him swell like a frog in the sun. \"This is kinder near One Hundredth  Street where we dived down. New York keeps right on to First Street,  and then it has a lot more streets below that. But that's just the  Island of Manhattan. All around there's a lot more. Manhattan is  mostly where they work. They live other places.\"    It was not very long before the train slowed down to make Grand  Central Station. On the long platform Ronicky surrendered his suit  case to the first porter. Bill Gregg was much alarmed. \"What'd you do  that for?\" he asked, securing a stronger hold on his own valise and  brushing aside two or three red caps.    \"He asked me for it,\" explained Ronicky. \"I wasn't none too set on  giving it to him to carry, but I hated to hurt his feelings. Besides,  they're all done up in uniforms. Maybe this is their job.\"    \"But suppose that feller got away out of sight, what would you do?  Your brand-new pair of Colts is lying away in it!\"    \"He won't get out of sight none,\" Ronicky assured his friend grimly.  \"I got another Colt with me, and, no matter how fast he runs, a  forty-five slug can run a pile faster. But come on, Bill. The word in  this town seems to be to keep right on moving.\"    They passed under an immense, brightly lighted vault and then wriggled  through the crowds in pursuit of the astonishingly agile porter. So  they came out of the big station to Forty-second Street, where they  found themselves confronted by a taxi driver and the question:  \"Where?\"    \"I dunno,\" said Ronicky to Bill. \"Your reading tell you anything about  the hotels in this here town?\"    \"Not a thing,\" said Bill, \"because I never figured that I'd be fool  enough to come this far away from my home diggings. But here I am, and  we don't know nothing.\"    \"Listen, partner,\" said Ronicky to the driver. \"Where's a  fair-to-medium place to stop at?\"    The taxi driver swallowed a smile that left a twinkle about his eyes  which nothing could remove. \"What kind of a place? Anywhere from fifty  cents to fifty bucks a night.\"    \"Fifty dollars!\" exclaimed Bill Gregg. \"Can you lay over that,  Ronicky? Our wad won't last a week.\"    \"Say, pal,\" said the taxi driver, becoming suddenly friendly, \"I can  fix you up. I know a neat little joint where you'll be as snug as you  want. They'll stick you about one-fifty per, but you can't beat that  price in this town and keep clean.\"    \"Take us there,\" said Bill Gregg, and they climbed into the machine.    The taxi turned around, shot down Park Avenue, darted aside into the  darker streets to the east of the district and came suddenly to a  halt.    \"Did you foller that trail?\" asked Bill Gregg in a chuckling whisper.    \"Sure! Twice to the left, then to the right, and then to the left  again. I know the number of blocks, too. Ain't no reason for getting  rattled just because a joint is strange to us. New York may be  tolerable big, but it's got men in it just like we are, and maybe a  lot worse kinds.\"    As they got out of the little car they saw that the taxi driver had  preceded them, carrying their suit cases. They followed up a steep  pitch of stairs to the first floor of the hotel, where the landing had  been widened to form a little office.    \"Hello, Bert,\" said their driver. \"I picked up these gentlemen at  Grand Central. They ain't wise to the town, so I put 'em next to you.  Fix 'em up here?\"    \"Sure,\" said Bert, lifting a huge bulk of manhood from behind the  desk. He placed his fat hands on the top of it and observed his guests  with a smile. \"Ill make you right to home here, friends. Thank you,  Joe!\"    Joe grinned, nodded and, receiving his money from Bill Gregg, departed  down the stairs, humming. Their host, in the meantime, had picked up  their suit cases and led the way down a hall dimly lighted by two  flickering gas jets. Finally he reached a door and led them into a  room where the gas had to be lighted. It showed them a cheerless  apartment in spite of the red of wall paper and carpet.    \"Only three bucks,\" said the proprietor with the air of one bestowing  charity out of the fullness of his heart. \"Bathroom only two doors  down. I guess you can't beat this layout, gents?\"    Bill Gregg glanced once about him and nodded.    \"You come up from the South, maybe?\" asked the proprietor, lingering  at the door.    \"West,\" said Bill Gregg curtly.    \"You don't say! Then you boys must be used to your toddy at night,  eh?\"    \"It's a tolerable dry country out there,\" said Ronicky without  enthusiasm.    \"All the more reason you need some liquor to moisten it up. Wait till  I get you a bottle of rye I got handy.\" And he disappeared in spite of  their protests.    \"I ain't a drinking man,\" said Gregg, \"and I know you ain't, but it's  sure insulting to turn down a drink in these days!\"    Ronicky nodded, and presently the host returned with two glasses,  rattling against a tall bottle on a tray.    \"Say, when,\" he said, filling the glasses and keeping on, in spite of  their protests, until each glass was full.    \"I guess it looks pretty good to you to see the stuff again,\" he  said, stepping back and rubbing his hands like one warmed by the  consciousness of a good deed. \"It ain't very plentiful around here.\"    \"Well,\" said Gregg, swinging up his glass, \"here's in your eye,  Ronicky, and here's to you, sir!\"    \"Wait,\" replied Ronicky Doone. \"Hold on a minute, Bill. Looks to me  like you ain't drinking,\" he said to the proprietor.    The fat man waved the suggestion aside. \"Never touch it,\" he assured  them. \"Used to indulge a little in light wines and beers when the  country was wet, but when it went dry the stuff didn't mean enough to  me to make it worth while dodging the law.
