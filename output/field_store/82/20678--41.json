Shallow closets are  built upon these tables against the wall; they have glass doors and are  fitted with shelves properly spaced. A large number of light wooden  boxes are prepared, numbered from one up to the limit of the storage  capacity of the closets. A number corresponding to that upon the box is  placed upon the shelf, so that each one after removal may be returned to  its proper place without difficulty. On the front of the box is a label  upon which is written the experiment to be performed or the name of the  apparatus whose use is to be learned, references to various books, which  may be found in the laboratory library, and the apparatus necessary for  the experiment, which ought to be found in the box. If any parts of the  apparatus are too large to be placed in the box, the label indicates by  a number where it may be found in the storage case.    It is evident that, instead of the above arrangement, all the boxes can  be stacked in piles in a general store room. The described arrangement  is preferable, as it prevents confusion in collecting and distributing  apparatus when the class is large.    _The Indicator_ (see figure).--Some device is evidently desirable to  direct the work of a laboratory with the least trouble and friction  possible. I have found that the old fashioned \"peg board,\" formerly used  in schools to record the demerits of scholars, modified as in the  following description, leaves nothing to be desired.    The requirements of such an instrument are these: It must show the names  of the members of the class; it must contain a full list of the  experiments to be performed; it must refer the student to the book and  page where information in reference to the experiments or apparatus may  be found; it must show what experiments are to be performed by each  student at a given time; it must give information as to the place in the  laboratory where the apparatus is deposited; it must show to the  instructor what experiments have been performed by each student; it must  prevent the assignment of the same experiment to two students; it must  enable the instructor to assign the same experiment to two or more  students; it must form a complete record of what has been done, what  work is incomplete, and what experiments have not yet been assigned; it  must also be so arranged that new experiments or sets of experiments may  be exhibited.          +------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+        |      | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |        +------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+        |    1 | *   o   o   *   o   o   o   o |        |    2 | *   o   *   *   o   o   o   o |        |    3 | +   *   *   *   o   o   o   o |        |    4 | +   o   *   *   o   o   o   o |        |    5 | o   +   *   *   *   *   o   o |        |    6 | o   +   *   *   o   *   o   o |        |    7 | o   o   +   *   o   o   o   o |        |    8 | o   o   o   +   *   o   o   o |        |    9 | o   o   o   *   +   o   o   o |        |   10 | o   o   o   o   o   +   o   o |        |   11 | o   o   o   *   o   o   +   * |        |   12 | o   o   *   *   o   +   +   + |        |   13 | o   o   *   o   o   o   o   o |        |   14 | o   o   *   o   o   o   o   o |        |   15 | o   o   +   o   o   o   o   o |        |   16 | o   o   +   +   *   o   o   * |        +--------------------------------------+         A, B, C, etc., are cards upon which are the names of students. 1,       2, 3, etc., are cards like the one described in the article. The       small circles (o) represent unassigned experiments. The black       circles (*) (slate nails) represent work done. The caudate circles       (+) (brass nail) represent work assigned.    The indicator consists of a plank of any convenient length and breadth.  The front surface is divided into squares of such size that the pegs may  be introduced and withdrawn with ease. At each corner of the squares  holes are bored into which nails may be placed. There is a blank border  at the top and another on the left side. At the top of each vertical  column of holes is placed a card holder. This is made of light tin  turned up on the long edges--which are vertical--and tacked to the  board. Opposite each horizontal row of holes is a similar tin card  holder, but of greater length, and having its length horizontal. The  holders at the top of the board contain cards upon which the names of  the class are written.    Cards, like the following, are prepared for the horizontal holders.    --------------------------------------------------------------  Stewart & Gee 229  Physical Manip. 85    Intensity of Gravity--Borda's Method  39  Glazebrook & Shaw 132  --------------------------------------------------------------    These cards are numbered from one to any desired number and are arranged  in the holders consecutively.    Two kinds of nails are provided to fit the holes in the board: An  ordinary slate nail and a common picture frame nail with a brass head.  The latter indicates work to be done, the former work done.    To prepare the board for service, brass headed nails are placed opposite  each experiment, and below the names, care being taken not to have more  than one nail in the same horizontal row, unless it is intended that two  persons or more are to work upon the same experiment.    There will be no conflict when the brass nails occupy diagonal lines. If  they do not, a glance will show the fact.    After an experiment has been performed and a report made upon the usual  blank, the brass nail is removed and a slate nail put in its place.    The board will show by the slate nails what work has been done by each  student, by the brass nails what is yet to be done, and by the empty  holes, experiments which have been omitted or are yet to be assigned. A  slate nail opposite an experiment card indicates that that experiment  may now be assigned to another person.    It is evident that the schedule for a whole term may be arranged in a  few minutes and that the daily changes require very little time.    The board is hung in a convenient place. The student as he enters the  laboratory looks for his name on the upper cards and under it for the  first brass nail in the vertical column: to the left he finds the  experiment card. On the left hand end of the slip he sees the book  references, on the right hand end a number--39 in the sample card given  above. Knowing the number, he proceeds to a desk and finds a box  numbered in the same manner. He removes the box from the closet. On the  label of the box is a list of all the apparatus necessary, which he will  find in the box; the label also contains the book references. He  performs the experiment, fills up a blank which he gives to the  instructor, puts all the materials back in the box, replaces the box in  its proper place in the closet and proceeds with the next experiment.  With this indicator there is no difficulty in managing fifty students or  more.    Comparatively little apparatus need be duplicated. Where apparatus is  fixed against a wall a number may be tacked upon the wall and a card  containing the information desired. The procedure is then the same as  with the boxes. The cards on the board being removable, other ones may  be inserted containing information in reference to other boxes having  the same number but containing different materials. There can be no  successful tampering with the board, for the record of experiments  performed is upon the blanks which the students turn in and also in the  individual note books which are written up and given to the instructor  for daily examination.

A mixture of water and liquefied carbon dioxide upon being discharged  through pipes at high pressure causes the rapid expansion of the gas and  converts the mixture into spray more or less frozen, and portions of the  liquid carbon dioxide are frozen, owing to its rapid expansion, and are  thus thrown upon the fire in a solid state, where said frozen carbon  dioxide in its further expansion not only acts to put out the fire, but  cools the surface upon which it falls, and thus tends to prevent  reignition.    A represents a receptacle sufficiently strong to stand a pressure of not  less than a thousand pounds to the square inch.    B B water receptacles.    [Illustration: Fig. 1]    In the drawings we have shown two receptacles B and only one receptacle  A; but we do not wish to confine ourselves to any particular number, nor  do we wish to confine ourselves to the horizontal position in which the  receptacles are shown.    C is a pipe leading from the receptacle A to a point at or near the  bottom of the receptacle B.    F is a pipe through which the mixture of water and liquefied gas from  the receptacle B is forced by the expansion of said liquefied gas, the  said pipe taking the mixture of water and liquefied gas from the bottom  of the receptacle.    [Illustration: Fig. 2]    To use the apparatus, open the stop cock D in the pipe C, leading to one  of the receptacles B, whereupon, owing to the lower pressure in the  cylinder B, the liquid carbon dioxide expands and rises to the top of  the cylinder A and forces the liquid carbon dioxide into the cylinder B,  the same as the superior steam of a boiler forces the water of the  boiler out when the same is tapped below the surface of the liquid. Now  upon opening the tap H, this superior gas forces out the mixture of  water and liquid carbon dioxide, which suddenly expanding causes  portions of the globules of liquefied gas to be frozen, and these, being  protected by a rapidly evaporating portion of the liquefied gas, are  thrown on the fire in solid particles.

Miss Moore,  therefore, easily acquired the rudiments of education and attained some  distinction as a student of history.    In 1820 Miss Moore was married to Adolphe Richards, a native of the  Island of Guadaloupe. He was a Latin of some Negro blood, had noble  ancestry, and had led an honorable career. Educated in London and  resident in Guadaloupe, he spoke both English and French fluently.  Because of poor health in later years he was directed by his friends to  the salubrious climate of Virginia. He settled at Fredericksburg, where  he soon became captivated by the charms of the talented Maria Louise  Moore. On learning of his marriage, his people and friends marveled that  a man of his standing had married a colored woman or a Southern woman at  all.    Adjusting himself to this new environment, Mr. Richards opened a shop  for wood-turning, painting and glazing. It is highly probable that he  learned these trades in the West Indies, but having adequate means to  maintain himself, he had not depended on his mechanical skill. In  Fredericksburg he had the respect and support of the best white people,  passing as one of such well-to-do free Negroes as the Lees, the Cooks,  the De Baptistes, who were contractors, and the Williamses, who were  contractors and brickmakers. His success was in a large measure due to  the good standing of the family of Mrs. Richards and to the wisdom with  which she directed this West Indian in his new environment.    They had in all fourteen children, the training of whom was largely the  work of the mother. All of them were well grounded in the rudiments of  education and given a taste for higher things. In the course of time  when the family grew larger the task of educating them grew more  arduous. Some of them probably attended the school conducted by a  Scotch-Irishman in the home of Richard De Baptiste. When the reaction  against the teaching of Negroes effected the closing of the colored  schools in Virginia, this one continued clandestinely for many years.  Determined to have her children better educated, Mrs. Richards sent one  of her sons to a school conducted by Mrs. Beecham, a remarkable English  woman, assisted by her daughter. These women were bent on doing what  they could to evade the law interpreted as prohibiting any one from  either sitting or standing to teach a black to read. They, therefore,  gathered the colored children around them while they lay prostrate on  the couch to teach them. For further evasion they kept on hand splinters  of wood which they had the children dip into a match preparation and use  with a flint for ignition to make it appear that they were showing them  how to make matches. When this scheme seemed impracticable, one of the  boys was sent to Washington in the District of Columbia to attend the  school maintained by John F. Cook, a successful educator and founder of  the Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church. This young man was then  running the risk of expatriation, for Virginia had in 1838 passed a law,  prohibiting the return to that State of those Negroes, who after the  prohibition of their education had begun to attend schools in other  parts.[2]    It was because of these conditions that in 1851 when her husband died  Mrs. Richards sold out her property and set out to find a better home in  Detroit, Michigan. Some of the best white people of Fredericksburg  commended her for this step, saying that she was too respectable a woman  to suffer such humiliation as the reaction had entailed upon persons of  her race.[3] She was followed by practically all of the best free  Negroes of Fredericksburg. Among these were the Lees, the Cooks, the  Williamses and the De Baptistes. A few years later this group attracted  the Pelham family from Petersburg. They too had tired of seeing their  rights gradually taken away and, therefore, transplanted themselves to  Detroit.    The attitude of the people of Detroit toward immigrating Negroes had  been reflected by the position the people of that section had taken from  the time of the earliest settlements. Slavery was prohibited by the  Ordinance of 1787. In 1807 there arose a case in which a woman was  required to answer for the possession of two slaves. Her contention was  that they were slaves on British territory at the time of the surrender  of the post in 1796 and that Jay's Treaty assured them to her. Her  contention was sustained.[4] A few days later a resident of Canada  attempted under this ruling to secure the arrest and return of some  mulatto and Indian slaves who had escaped from Canada. The court held  that slavery did not exist in Michigan except in the case of slaves in  the possession of the British settlers within the Northwest Territory  July 11, 1796, and that there was no obligation to give up fugitives  from a foreign jurisdiction. An effort was made to take the slaves by  force but the agent of the owner was tarred and feathered.[4]    Generally speaking, Detroit adhered to this position.[4a] In 1827 there  was passed an act providing for the registry of the names of all colored  persons, requiring the possession of a certificate showing that they  were free and a bond in the sum of $500 for their good behavior.[5] This  law was obnoxious to the growing sentiment of freedom in Detroit and was  not enforced until the Riot of 1833. This uprising was an attack on the  Negroes because a courageous group of them had effected the rescue and  escape of one Thornton Blackburn and his wife, who had been arrested by  the sheriff as alleged fugitives from Kentucky.[6] The anti-slavery  feeling considerably increased thereafter. The Detroit Anti-Slavery  Society was formed in 1837, other societies to secure the relief and  escape of slaves quickly followed and still another was organized to  find employment and purchase homes for refugees.[7] This change of  sentiment is further evidenced by the fact that in 1850 it was necessary  to call out the three companies of volunteers to quell an incipient riot  occasioned by the arrest and attempt to return a runaway slave in  accordance with the Fugitive Slave Law. Save the general troubles  incident to the draft riots of the Northern cities of 1863,[8] Detroit  maintained this benevolent attitude toward Negroes seeking refuge.    In this favorable community the Richards colony easily prospered. The  Lees well established themselves in their Northern homes and soon won  the respect of the community. Most of the members of the Williams family  confined themselves to their trade of bricklaying and amassed  considerable wealth. One of Mr. Williams's daughters married a  well-to-do Waring living then at Wauseon, Ohio; another became the wife  of one Chappee, who is now a stenographer in Detroit; and the third  united in matrimony with James H. Cole, who became the head of a  well-to-do family of Detroit. Then there were the Cooks descending from  Lomax B. Cook, a broker of no little business ability. Will Marion Cook,  the musician, belongs to this family. The De Baptistes, too, were among  the first to get a foothold in this new environment and prospered  materially from their experience and knowledge acquired in  Fredericksburg as contractors.[8a] From this group came Richard De  Baptiste, who in his day was the most noted colored Baptist preacher in  the Northwest. The Pelhams were no less successful in establishing  themselves in the economic world. They enjoyed a high reputation in the  community and had the sympathy and cooperation of the influential white  people in the city. Out of this family came Robert A. Pelham, for years  editor of a weekly in Detroit, and from 1901 to the present time an  employee of the Federal Government in Washington.[9]    The children of Mrs. Richards were in no sense inferior to the  descendants of the other families. She lived to see her work bear fruit  in the distinguished services they rendered and the desirable  connections which they made after the Civil War. Her daughter Julia  married Thomas F. Carey who, after conducting a business for some years  in New York, moved to Toronto, where he died. From this union came the  wife of D. Augustus Straker. Her daughter Evalina married Dr. Joseph  Ferguson who, prior to 1861, lived in Richmond, Virginia, uniting the  three occupations of leecher, cupper and barber. This led to his coming  to Detroit to study medicine. He was graduated there and practiced for  many years in that city. Before the Civil War her son John D. Richards  was sent to Richmond to learn a trade. There he met and became the  lifelong friend of Judge George L. Ruffin, who was then living in that  city.[10]    The most prominent and the most useful person to emerge from this group  of pioneering Negroes was her daughter Fannie M. Richards. She was born  in Fredericksburg, Virginia, October 1, 1841. As her people left that  State when she was quite young she did not see so much of the  intolerable conditions as did the older members of the family. Miss  Richards was successful in getting an early start in education. Desiring  to have better training than what was then given to persons of color in  Detroit, she went to Toronto. There she studied English, history,  drawing and needlework. In later years she attended the Teachers  Training School in Detroit. Her first thought was to take up teaching  that she might do something to elevate her people. She, therefore,  opened a private school in 1863, doing a higher grade of work than that  then undertaken in the public schools. About 1862, however, a colored  public school had been opened by a white man named Whitbeck. Miss  Richards began to think that she should have such a school herself.    Her story as to how she realized her ambition is very interesting. Going  to her private school one morning, she saw a"]]]
