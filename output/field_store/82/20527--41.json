Thus, for instance, in the case of setting 1,  which was presented to the animal in trials numbered 1, 11, 21, and so  on to 141, it is clear from the records that no definite improvement  occurred. But oddly enough, in the case of setting 10, which presented  the same group of open doors, almost all of the reactions are right in  the lower half of the column. For setting 2, it is evident that mistakes  soon disappeared.    Comparison of the data of table 1 indicates that the number of correct  first choices is inversely proportional to the number of doors in use,  while the number of choices made in a given trial is directly  proportional to the number of doors in use.    During the first week of work on this problem, Skirrl improved markedly.  His performance was somewhat irregular and unpredictable, but on the  whole the experiment seemed fairly satisfactory. Cold, cloudy, or rainy  days tended to diminish steadiness and to increase the number of  mistakes. Similarly, absence of hunger was unfavorable to continuous  effort to find the right box.    The period of confinement, as punishment for wrong choices, was  increased from thirty seconds to sixty seconds on April 26. But there is  no satisfactory evidence that this favored the solution of the problem.  Work on May 4 was interrupted by a severe storm, the noise of which so  distracted the monkey that he ceased to work. Consequently, observations  were interrupted on the completion of trial 132, and on May 5, the  series was begun with setting 3. On this date, eighteen trials were  given in succession, and in only one of them did a mistake occur. Since  the ten trials numbered 133 to 142 were correct, Skirrl was considered  to have solved problem 1, and systematic training was discontinued.    On the following day, as a measure of the extent to which the animal had  learned to select the first door at the left no matter what its position  or the number of doors in the group presented, a control series was  given in which the settings differed from the regular series of  settings. These supplementary settings are presented at the bottom of  table 1 together with the records of reaction in ten trials.    Since in only six of these ten control settings was the first choice  correct, it is scarcely fair to insist that the animal was reacting on  the basis of an ideational solution of the problem. Rather, it would  seem that he had learned to react to particular settings. A careful  study of all of the data of response, together with notes on the varied  behavior of the animal during the experiments, justifies the statement  that Skirrl's solution of problem 1 was incomplete and unreliable. It  was highly dependent upon the particular situation, or even the  particular door at the left end of the group, and slightly if at all  dependent upon anything comparable to the human idea of first at the  left of the group.    This particular series of observations has been described and discussed  in some detail in order to make the chief points of method clear. It  will be needless, hereafter, to refer explicitly to many of the  characteristics of reaction or to the important points in the  construction of tables which have been mentioned.    A graphic representation of Skirrl's learning process in problem 1 is  presented in figure 18. The irregularities are most striking, and fairly  indicate the erraticness of the animal. The curve is based upon the data  in next to the last column of table 1, that is, the column presenting  the errors or wrong first choices in each series of trials.    Unquestionably, the form of such a curve of learning should be  considered in connection with the method or methods of selecting the  right box employed by the animal during the course of experimentation.  It appears from an analysis of the behavior of Skirrl in problem 1 that  there developed a single definite and persistent method, namely, that of  going to one box in the group, and in case it happened to be a wrong  one, of choosing, on emergence from it, the next toward the right end of  the group, and so on down the line. Having reached the extreme right  end, the tendency was to follow the side of the reaction-chamber around  to the opposite end and to enter the first box at the left end of the  group, which was, of course, the right one. This method appears, with  certain slight variations, in approximately ninety per cent of the  trials which involved incorrect choices. Thus, in the case of trials 121  to 130, of which eight exhibit right first choices, the remaining two  exhibit the method described above except that the final member at the  right end of the group was in each case omitted.    [Illustration: FIGURE 18.--Error curves of learning for the solution of  problem 1 (first box at left end).]    On the whole, Skirrl's behavior in connection with this problem appears  to indicate a low order of intelligence. He persisted in such stupid  acts as that of turning, after emergence from the right box, toward the  right and passing into the blind alley I, instead of toward the left,  through G and H, to D. In contrast with the other animals, he spent much  time before the closed doors of the boxes, instead of going directly to  the open doors, some one of which marked the box in which the reward of  food could be obtained.

When the third oath was to be  administered, it was customary for them to meet, and for the marshal to  take the right hand of each and to place it on the cross. Then the  functions of the priest began, and the usual address, endeavouring to  conciliate the angry passions of the champions, and to remind them of  their common dependence on the Supreme Being, may have tended to benefit  the bystanders, although it generally failed of its effect with the  combatants.    If the parties persisted, the last oath was administered. The combatants  were obliged to swear solemnly that they had neither about them nor their  horses, stone, nor herb, nor charm, nor invocation; and that they would  fight only with their bodily strength, their weapons, and their horses.  The crucifix and breviary were then presented to them to kiss, the parties  retired into their tents, the heralds uttering their last admonition to  exertion and courage, and the challengers rushed forth from their tents,  which were immediately dragged from within the lists. Then the marshal of  the field having cried out, \"Let them pass, let them pass,\" the seconds  retired. The combatants instantly mounted their horses, and the contest  commenced.--_Foreign Review_.           *       *       *       *       *        SUPERSTITION RELATING TO BEES.      On further inquiry, it has been found that the superstitious practice,  formerly mentioned,[1] of informing the bees of a death that takes place  in a family, is very well known, and still prevails among the lower orders  in this country. The disastrous consequence to be apprehended from  noncompliance with this strange custom is not (as before stated) that the  bees will desert the hive, but that they will dwindle and die. The manner  of communicating the intelligence to the little community, with due form  and ceremony, is this: to take the key of the house, and knock with it  three times against the hive, telling the inmates, at the same time, that  their master or mistress, &c., (as the case may be,) is dead!        [1] See page 75.    Mr. Loudon says, when in Bedfordshire lately, \"we were informed of an old  man who sung a psalm last year in front of some hives which were not doing  well, but which he said would thrive in consequence of that ceremony. Our  informant could not state whether this was a local or individual  superstition.\"--_Magazine of Natural History_.           *       *       *       *       *        NOTES OF A READER    LAW REFORMS.      We copy the following eloquent and impassioned paragraph from the last  _Edinburgh Review_:--    \"Thanks unto our ancestors, there is now no _Star-chamber_ before whom may  be summoned either the scholar, whose learning offends the bishops, by  disproving incidentally the divine nature of tithes, or the counsellor,  who gives his client an opinion against some assumed prerogative. There is  no _High Commission Court_ to throw into a gaol until his dying day, at  the instigation of a Bancroft, the bencher who shall move for the  discharge of an English subject from imprisonment contrary to law. It is  no longer the duty of a privy councillor to seize the suspected volumes of  an antiquarian, or plunder the papers of an ex-chief justice, whilst lying  on his death-bed. _Government licensers of the press_ are gone, whose  infamous perversion of the writings of other lawyers will cause no future  Hale to leave behind him orders expressly prohibiting the posthumous  publication of his legal MSS., lest the sanctity of his name should be  abused, to the destruction of those laws, of which he had been long the  venerable and living image. An advocate of the present day need not  absolutely withdraw (as Sir Thomas More is reported to have prudently done  for a time) from his profession, because the crown had taken umbrage at  his discharge of a public duty. It is, however, flattery and self-delusion  to imagine that the lust of power and the weaknesses of human nature have  been put down by the Bill of Rights, and that our forefathers have left  nothing to be done by their descendants. The violence of former times is  indeed no longer practicable; but the spirit which led to these excesses  can never die; it changes its aspect and its instruments with  circumstances, and takes the shape and character of its age. The risks and  the temptations of the profession at the present day are quite as  dangerous to its usefulness, its dignity, and its virtue, as the shears  and branding-irons that frightened every barrister from signing Prynne's  defence, or the writ that sent Maynard to the Tower. The public has a deep,  an incalculable interest in the independence and fearless honour of its  lawyers. In a system so complicated as ours, every thing must be taken at  their word almost on trust; and proud as we, for the most part, justly are  of the unsuspectedness of our judges, their integrity and manliness of  mind are, of course, involved in that of the body out of which they must  be chosen. There is not a man living whose life, liberty, and honour may  not depend on the resoluteness as well as capacity of those by whom, when  all may be at stake, he must be both advised and represented in a court of  justice.\"    Our readers will easily recognise the great events in the history of the  law in England, to which the reviewer alludes. Seldom have we read a more  masterly page; it would even form an excellent rider to Mr. Brougham's  recent speech on the same subject.           *       *       *       *       *      SUPPERS.

Besides, it is a well-known fact, that a sound human stomach acts upon a  well-drest dish, with nearly the power of an eight-horse steam-engine; and  this being the case, good heavens! why should one be afraid of a few  trifling turkey-legs, a bottle of Barclay's brown-stout, a Welsh rabbit,  brandy and water, and a few more such fooleries?

Dryden falls into the same error:--      A flower there is that grows in meadow ground,    Aurelius called, and easy to be found;    For from one root the rising stem bestows    A wood of leaves and violet purple boughs.    The flower itself is glorious to behold,    And shines on altars like refulgent gold.     _Mag. Nat. History_           *       *       *       *       *      RIVAL SINGERS.
