They trampled under foot their own election pledges, made during  the first Union General Election, guaranteeing justice and fair treatment  to the law-abiding Natives.    The campaign, to compass the elimination of the blacks  from the farms, was not at all popular with landowners,  who made huge profits out of the renting of their farms to Natives.  Platform speakers and newspaper writers coined an opprobrious phrase  which designated this letting of farms to Natives as \"Kafir-farming\",  and attempted to prove that it was almost as immoral as \"baby-farming\".  But landowners pocketed the annual rents, and showed no inclination  to substitute the less industrious \"poor whites\" for the more  industrious Natives.  Old Baas M----, a typical Dutch landowner  of the \"Free\" State, having collected his share of the crop of 1912,  addressing a few words of encouragement to his native tenants,  on the subject of expelling the blacks from the farms, said in the Taal:  \"How dare any number of men, wearing tall hats and frock coats,  living in Capetown hotels at the expense of other men, order me  to evict my Natives?  This is my ground; it cost my money, not Parliament's,  and I will see them banged (barst) before I do it.\"    It then became evident that the authority of Parliament  would have to be sought to compel the obstinate landowners to  get rid of their Natives.  And the compliance of Parliament with this demand  was the greatest Ministerial surrender to the Republican malcontents,  resulting in the introduction and passage of the Natives' Land Act of 1913,  inasmuch as the Act decreed, in the name of His Majesty the King,  that pending the adoption of a report to be made by a commission,  somewhere in the dim and unknown future, it shall be unlawful  for Natives to buy or lease land, except in scheduled native areas.  And under severe pains and penalties they were to be deprived  of the bare human rights of living on the land, except as servants  in the employ of the whites -- rights which were never seriously challenged  under the Republican regime, no matter how politicians raved  against the Natives.

Isaiah.        On February 18, 1913, General L. Lemmer, member for Marico, Transvaal,  asked the Minister of Lands: --  (a)  How many farms or portions of farms  in the Transvaal Province have during the last three years been registered  in the names of Natives; (b) what is the extent of the land so registered;  and (c) how much was paid for it?    The Minister of Lands replied:  (a) 78 farms; (b) 144,416 morgen;  and (c) 94,907 Pounds.    Some very disturbing elements suggest themselves in this question  and in its prompt answer.  A question of the kind should have taken  some time to reach Pretoria from the seat of Parliament; more time  to search for and compile the necessary information, and further time  to get the answer to the Table of the House of Assembly in Capetown.  For instance, on March 11 Mr. T. L. Schreiner called for an explanation  in connexion with the same return.  He had to ask again on April 1,  the answer in each instance being that the required \"information  had been telegraphed for and would be laid on the table when it is available\"  (vide Union Hansard, pp. 777 and 1,175).  It was only on May 13  -- two months and two days after -- that an answer to Mr. Schreiner's  question of March 11 could be furnished.    Again, on May 20 Mr. Schreiner called for a similar return,  embracing the four Provinces of the Union.*  If it were so easy  for General Lemmer to get a reply in regard to the Transvaal,  where most of the registration took place, it should have been  relatively more easy to add the information from the Cape and Natal,  since no registration could have taken place in the Orange \"Free\" State,  where Natives cannot buy land.  But strange to say, all that Mr. Schreiner  could get out of the Minister was a promise to furnish a reply  when it is available, and it does not appear to be on record  that it was ever furnished during that session.  Therefore, a Native  cannot be blamed for suspecting that when General Lemmer asked his question,  the return was \"cut and dried\" and available to be laid on the table  as soon as it was called for.    --  * It does not appear to have occurred to any one to call for a return    showing transfers of land from blacks to whites.  --    Another significant point is that the questioner did not want to know  the extent of land bought by Natives, but of the land  \"registered in their names\" during the period; and Mr. Schreiner  was able to show later in the session by an analysis of the return  that it mainly comprised land awarded to Native tribes  by the Republican Government, some of it when they conquered the country.  They include farms bought or awarded to Natives as long ago  as the early 60's and 70's, but the owners were not able to obtain titles  as the late Republican Government did not allow Natives to register land  in their own names.  They had been held in trust for them  by European friends or missionaries, and it was only during  the last three years that the owners claimed direct titles,  which right was restored to them since the British occupation.    But the Lemmer Return did its fell work.  It scared every white man  in the country.  They got alarmed to hear that Natives had  during the past three (!) years \"bought\" land to the extent of 50,000 morgen  per annum.    Thanks to Mr. Schreiner's questions, however, the misleading features  of the statistical scarecrow were revealed -- but, unfortunately too late.          Origin of the Trouble    On February 28, 1913, Mr. J. G. Keyter (a \"Free\" State member) moved:  That the Government be requested to submit to the House  DURING THE PRESENT SESSION a general Pass and Squatters Bill  to prohibit coloured people (1) from WANDERING ABOUT WITHOUT A PROPER PASS;  (2) from SQUATTING ON FARMS; and (3) from SOWING ON THE SHARE SYSTEM.    Mr. T. P. Brain,* another \"Free\" Stater, seconded the motion.    --  * This gentleman died during 1913.  --    Mr. P. G. W. Grobler,* a Transvaaler, moved (as an amendment)  to add at the end of the motion:  \"and further TO TAKE EFFECTIVE MEASURES  TO RESTRICT THE PURCHASE AND LEASE OF LAND BY NATIVES.\"    --  * Mr. Grobler forfeited his seat when he was convicted of complicity    in the recent rebellion.  --    Mr. Schreiner strongly protested against both the motion and the amendment.    The Minister for Native Affairs* spoke somewhat against Mr. Keyter's motion  but promised to comply with Mr. Grobler's amendment, which promise he redeemed  by introducing a Natives' Land Bill.    --  * Hon. J. W. Sauer, Minister of Native Affairs, died a month after the Bill    became law.  --    Before the Bill was introduced, the Minister made the unprecedented  announcement that the Governor-General had given his assurance  that the Royal Assent would not be withheld from the Natives' Land Bill.  Section 65 of the South African Constitution provides that the King  may disallow an Act of Parliament within twelve months  after the Governor-General signed it.  And the abrogation of the Constitution,  as far as this Bill is concerned, literally gave licence  to the political libertines of South Africa; as, being thus freed  from all legislative restraint, they wasted no further time  listening to such trifles as reason and argument.    The following are extracts from the debates on the Natives' Land Bill  as reported in the Union Hansard of 1913.    ==  The adjourned debate on the motion for the second reading  of the Natives Land Bill was resumed by    MR. J. X. MERRIMAN (Victoria West).  It was with very great reluctance  (the right hon. gentleman said) that he rose to speak on this measure.  It would have been more convenient to have given a silent vote,  but he felt, and he was afraid, that after many years of devoted attention  to this question of the native policy of South Africa, he would not  be doing his duty if he did not give this House -- for what it was worth --  the result of his experience through these years.    He should like to emphasize a brighter side of the question,  and that was to point out that the Natives, if they were well managed,  were an invaluable asset to the people of this country.  (Hear, hear.)  Let them take our trade figures and compare them with  the trade figures of the other large British Dominions.  Our figures were surprising when measured by the white population,  but if they took the richest Dominion that there was under the British Crown  outside South Africa, and took the trade value of those figures  per head of the white population, and multiply those figures  by our European population, then they might very well apply  any balance they had to our native population, and then they would see,  strangely enough, that upon that basis it worked out"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14521"],[0,"Memories: A Story of German Love (#6)"],[1,"in reading the 'German Theology.' I read the book, and I  felt the power of its truths so overwhelmingly that I was compelled to  submit to it.  The truth was revealed to me; or rather, I was revealed  to myself, and I felt for the first time what belief meant.  The truth  which had long slumbered in my soul belonged to me, but it was the word  of the unknown teacher which filled me with light, illuminated my inner  vision, and brought out my indistinct presentiments in fuller clearness  before my soul.  When I had thus experienced for the first time how the  human soul can believe, I read the Gospels as if they, too, had been  written by an Unknown man, and banished the thought as well as I could  that they were an inspiration from the Holy Ghost to the apostles, in  some wonderful manner; that they had been endorsed by the councils and  proclaimed by the church as the supreme authority of the alone-saving  belief.  Then, for the first time, I understood what Christian faith  and revelation were.\"    \"It is wonderful,\" said I, \"that the theologians have not broken down  all religion, and they will succeed yet, if the believers do not  seriously confront them and say: 'Thus far but no farther.'  Every  church must have its servants, but there has been as yet no religion  which the Priests, the Brahmins, the Schamins, the Bonzes, the Lamas,  the Pharisees, or the Scribes have not corrupted and perverted.  They  wrangle and dispute in a language unintelligible to nine-tenths of  their congregations, and instead of permitting themselves to be  inspired by the apostles, and of inspiring others with their  inspiration, they construct long arguments to show that the Gospels  must be true, because they were written by inspired men.  But this is  only a makeshift for their own unbelief.  How can they know that these  men were inspired in a wonderful manner, without ascribing to  themselves a still more wonderful inspiration?  Therefore they extend  the gift of inspiration to the fathers of the church; they attribute to  them those very things which the majority have incorporated in the  canons of the councils; and there again, when the question arises how  we know that of fifty bishops twenty-six were inspired and twenty-four  were not, they finally take the last desperate step, and say that  infallibility and inspiration are inherent in the heads of the church  down to the present day, through the laying on of hands, so that  infallibility, majority and inspiration make all our convictions, all  resignation, all devout intuitions, superfluous.  And yet,  notwithstanding all these connecting links, the first question returns  in all its simplicity: How can B know that A is inspired, if B is not  equally, or even more, inspired than A?  For it is of more consequence  to know that A was inspired than for one's self to be inspired.\"    \"I have never comprehended this so clearly myself,\" said she.  \"But I  have often felt how difficult it must be to know whether one loves who  shows not a sign of love that could not be imitated.  And, again, I  have thought that no one could know it unless he knew love himself, and  that he could only believe in the love of another so far as he believed  in his own love.  As with the gift of love so is it with the gift of  the Holy Spirit.  They upon whom it descended heard a rushing from  heaven as of a mighty wind, and there appeared to them cloven tongues  like as of fire.  But the rest were either amazed and perplexed, or  they made sport of them and said: 'They are full of sweet wine.'    \"Still, as I said to you, it is the 'German Theology' to which I am  indebted for learning to believe in my belief, and what will seem a  weakness to many, strengthened me the most; namely, that the old master  never stops to demonstrate his propositions rigidly, but scatters them  like a sower, in the hope that some grains will fall upon good soil and  bear fruit a thousand fold.  So our Divine Master never attempted to  prove his doctrines, for the perfect conviction of truth disdains the  form of a demonstration.\"    \"Yes,\" I interrupted her, for I could not help thinking of the  wonderful chain of proof in Spinoza's 'Ethics,' the straining after  demonstration by Spinoza gives me the impression that this acute  thinker could not have believed in his own doctrines with his whole  heart, and that he therefore felt the necessity of fastening every mesh  of his net with the utmost care.  \"Still,\" I continued, \"I must  acknowledge I do not share this great admiration for the 'German  Theology,' although I owe the book many a doubt.  To me there is a lack  of the human and the poetical in it, and of warm feeling and reverence  for reality altogether.  The entire mysticism of the fourteenth century  is wholesome as a preparative, but it first reaches solution in the  divinely holy and divinely courageous return to real life, as was  exemplified by Luther.  Man must at some time in his life recognize his  nothingness.  He must feel that he is nothing of himself, that his  existence, his beginning, his everlasting life are rooted in the  superearthly and incomprehensible.  That is the returning to God which  in reality is never concluded on earth but yet leaves behind in the  soul a divine home sickness, which never again ceases.  But man cannot  ignore the creation as the Mystics would.  Although created out of  nothing, that is, through and out of God, he cannot of his own power  resolve himself back into this nothingness.  The self-annihilation of  which Tauler so often speaks is scarcely better than the sinking away  of the human soul in Nirvana, as the Buddhists have it.  Thus Tauler  says: 'That if he by greater reverence and love could reach the highest  existence in non-existence, he would willingly sink from his height  into the deepest abyss.'  But this annihilation of the creature was not  the purpose of the Creator since he made it.  'God is transformed in  man,' says Augustine, 'not man in God.'  Thus mysticism should be only  a fire-trial which steels the soul but does not evaporate it like  boiling water in a kettle.  He who has recognized the nothingness of  self ought to recognize this self as a reflection of the actual divine.  The 'German Theology' says:    [\"Was nu us geflossen ist, das ist nicht war wesen, und hat kein wesen  anders dan in dem volkomen, sunder es ist ein zufal oder ein glast und  ein schin, der nicht wesen ist oder nicht wesen hat anders, dan in dem  sewer, da der glast us flusset, als in der sunnen oder in einem  liechte.\"]    \"What has flown out is not real substance and has no other reality  except in the perfect; but it is an incident or a glare or a shimmer,  which is no substance, and has no other reality, except in the fire  from which a glare proceeds, as in the sun or a light.\"    \"What is emitted from the divine, though it be only like the reflection  from the fire, still has the divine reality in itself, and one might  almost ask what were the fire without glow, the sun without light, or  the Creator without the creature?  These are questions of which it is  said very truthfully:    [\"Welch mensche und welche creatur begert zu erfaren und zu wissen den  heimlichen rat und willen gottes, der begert nicht anders denne als  Adam tet und der boese geist.\"]    \"What man or creature desires to learn and to know the secret counsel  and will of God--desires nothing else but what Adam did and the evil  spirit.    \"For this reason, it should be enough for us to feel and to appear that  we are a reflection of the divine until we are divine.  No one should  place under a bushel or extinguish the divine light which illuminates  us, but let it beam out, that it may brighten and warm all about it.  Then one feels a living fire in his veins, and a higher consecration  for the struggle of life.  The most trivial duties remind us of God.  The earthly becomes divine, the temporal eternal, and our entire life a  life in God.  God is not eternal repose.  He is everlasting life, which  Angelus Silesius forgets when he says: 'God is without will.'      \"'We pray: 'Thy will my Lord and God be done,'    And lo, He has no will!  He is an eternal silence.'\"    She listened to me quietly, and, after a moment's reflection, said:  \"Health and strength belong to your faith; but there are life-weary  souls, who long for rest and sleep, and feel so lonely that when they  fall asleep in God, they miss the world as little as the world misses  them.  It is a foretaste of divine rest to them when they can wrap  themselves in the divine; and this they can do, since no tie binds them  fast to earth, and no wish troubles their hearts except the wish for  rest.      \"'Rest is the highest good, and were God not rest,    Then would I avert my gaze even from Him.'    \"You do the German theologian an injustice.  It is true he teaches the  nothingness of the external life, but he does not wish to see it  annihilated.  Read me the twenty-eighth chapter.\"    I took the book and read, while she closed her eyes and listened:    [\"Und wa die voreinunge geschicht in der wahrheit und wesentlich wirt,  da stet vorbass der inner mensche in der einung unbeweglich und got  lest den ussern menschen her und dar bewegt werden von diesem zu dem.
