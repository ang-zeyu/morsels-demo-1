Nevertheless, so intricate and perplexing would be the task of  unraveling the theologic threads that together make the yarn of the  epic, and in many cases it would be so doubtful whether any one thread  led to Brahmanism or to the wider and more catholic religion called  Hinduism, that we should have preferred to give up the latter name  altogether, as one that was for the most part idle, and in some degree  misleading. Feeling, however, that a mere manual should not take the  initiative in coining titles, we have admitted this unsatisfactory  word 'Hinduism' as the title of a chapter which undertakes to give a  comprehensive view of the religions endorsed by the many-centuried  epic, and to explain their mutual relations. As in the case of the  'Popular Faith,' we have had here no models to go upon, and the mass  of matter which it was necessary to handle--the great epic is about  eight times as long as the Iliad and Odyssey put together--must be our  excuse for many imperfections of treatment in this part of the work.  The reader will gain at least a view of the religious development as  it is exhibited in the literature, and therefore, as, far as possible,  in chronological order. The modern sects and the religions of the hill  tribes of India form almost a necessary supplement to these nobler  religions of the classical literature; the former because they are the  logical as well as historical continuation of the great Hindu  sectarian schisms, the latter because they give the solution of some  problems connected with Civaism, and, on the other hand, offer useful  un-Aryan parallels to a few traits which have been preserved in the  earliest period of the Aryans.[28]           *       *       *       *       *           FOOTNOTES:         [Footnote 1: Megasthenes, Fr.

Compare Zimmer, BB. iii. p.       137; Kaegi, _Der Rig Veda_, p. 144 (Arrowsmith's       translation, p. 109). In the Rig Veda there is a god       Aryaman, 'the true,' who forms with Mitra and Varuna a triad       (see below). Windisch questions the propriety of identifying       [=I]ran with Erin, and Schrader (p. 584^2) doubts whether       the Indo-Europeans as a body ever called themselves Aryans.       We employ the latter name because it is short.]           *       *       *       *       *          CHAPTER II.    PEOPLE AND LAND.      The Aryan Hindus, whose religions we describe in this volume[1],  formed one of the Aryan or so-called Indo-European peoples. To the  other peoples of this stock, Persians, Armenians, Greeks, Italians,  Kelts, Teutons, Slavs, the Hindus were related closely by language,  but very remotely from the point of view of their primitive religion.  Into India the Aryans brought little that was retained in their  religious systems. A few waning gods, the worship of ancestors, and  some simple rites are common to them and their western relations; but  with the exception of the Iranians (Persians), their religious  connection with cis-Indic peoples is of the slightest. With the  Iranians, the Hindus (that were to be) appear to have lived longest in  common after the other members of the Aryan host were dispersed to  west and south[2]. They stand in closer religious touch with these,  their nearest neighbors, and in the time of the Rig Veda (the Hindus'  earliest literature) there are traces of a connection comparatively  recent between the pantheons of the two nations.    According to their own, rather uncertain, testimony, the Aryans of the  Rig Veda appear to have consisted of five tribal groups[3]. These  groups, _janas_, Latin gens, are subdivided into _vicas_, Latin vicus,  and these, again, into _gr[=a]mas_. The names, however, are not  employed with strictness, and _jana_, etymologically gens but  politically tribus, sometimes is used as a synonym of _gr[=a]ma_.[4]  Of the ten books of the Rig-Veda seven are ascribed to various  priestly families. In the main, these books are rituals of song as  inculcated for the same rites by different family priests and their  descendants. Besides these there are books which are ascribed to no  family, and consist, in part, of more general material. The  distinction of priestly family-books was one, possibly, coextensive  with political demarcation. Each of the family-books represents a  priestly family, but it may represent, also, a political family. In at  least one case it represents a political body.["]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14515"],[0,"The Nervous Child (#6)"],[1,"mother, between the child who  inherits an unusually sensitive nervous system and the child who is  nervous only because he breathes constantly an atmosphere charged with  doubt and anxiety.      (_c_) THE CHILD'S LOVE OF POWER    Let us study briefly a third quality of the child which, for want of a  better name, I have called after the ruling passion of mankind, his  love of power. Perhaps it would be better to call it his love of being  in the centre of the picture. It is his constant desire to make his  environment revolve around him and to attract all attention to  himself. Somewhat later in life this desire to attract attention, at  all costs, is well seen in the type of girl popularly regarded as  hysterical. The impulse is then a morbid and debased impulse; in the  child it is natural and, within limits, praiseworthy. A girl of this  sort, who feels that she is not likely to attract attention because of  any special gifts of beauty or intellect which she may possess,  becomes conscious that she can always arouse interest by the severity  of her bodily sufferings. The suggestion acts upon her unstable mind,  and forthwith she becomes paralysed, or a cripple, or dumb, presenting  a mimicry or travesty of some bodily ailment with which she is more or  less familiar. \"Hysterical\" girls will even apply caustic to the skin  in order to produce some strange eruption which, while it sorely  puzzles us doctors, will excite widespread interest and commiseration.  Now little children will seldom carry their desire to attract  attention so far as to work upon the feelings of their parents by  simulating disease. They have not the necessary knowledge to play the  part, and even if they make the attempt, complaining of this or that  symptom which they notice has aroused the interest of their elders,  the simulation is not likely to be so successful as to deceive even a  superficial observer. But within the limits of their own powers,  children are past masters in attracting attention. The little child is  unable to take part in any sustained conversation; most of his  talking, indeed, is done when he is alone, and is addressed to no one  in particular. But he knows well that by a given action he can produce  a given reaction in his mother and nurse. A great part of what is said  to him--too great a part by far--comes under the category of reproof  or repression. He is forbidden to do this or that, coaxed, cajoled,  threatened long before he is old enough to understand the meaning of  the words spoken, although he knows the tone in which they are uttered  and loves to produce it at will. How he enjoys it all! Watch him draw  near the fire, the one place that is forbidden him. He does not mean  to do himself harm. He knows that it is hot and would hurt him, but  for the time being he is out of the picture and he is intent on  producing the expected response, the reproof tone from his mother  which he knows so well. He approaches it warily, often anticipating  his mother's part and vigorously scolding himself. He desires nothing  more than that his mother should repeat the reproof, forbidding him a  dozen times. The mind of all little children tends easily to work in a  groove. It delights in repetition and it evoking not the unexpected  but the expected. If his sport is stopped by his mother losing  patience and removing him bodily from the danger zone, his sense of  impotence finds vent in passionate crying. But if his mother takes no  notice, the sport soon loses its savour. He is conscious that somehow  or other it has fallen flat, and he flits off to other employment.    Mothers will complain that children seem to take a perverse pleasure  in evoking reproof, appeals, entreaties, and exhortations. A small boy  of four who had several times repeated the particular sin to which his  attention had been directed by the frequency of his mother's warnings  and entreaties, finding that on this occasion she had decided to take  no notice, approached her with a troubled face: \"Are you not angry?\"  he said; \"are you not disappointed?\" In reality the naughty child is  often only the child who has become master of his mother's or his  nurse's responses, and can produce at will the effect he desires. The  idea that the child possesses a strong will, which can and must be  broken by persistent opposition, is based upon this tendency of the  child. It is an entire misconception of the situation: Strength of  will and fixity of purpose are among the last powers which the human  mind develops. In little children they are conspicuously absent. What  appears to us as a fixed and persistent desire to perform a definite  action in spite of all we can say or do, is often no more than the  desire to produce the familiar tones of reproof, to traverse again the  familiar ground, to attract attention and to find himself again the  centre of the picture. If no one pays any attention and no one  reproves, he soon gives up the attempt. If too much is made of any one  action of the child, a strong impression is made on his mind and he  cannot choose but return to it again and again.    This little drama of the fireplace may teach us a great deal in the  management of children. The wise mother and nurse will find a hundred  devices to catch the child's attention and lure him away from the  danger zone without the incident making any impression on his mind at  all, and will not call attention to it by repeated reproofs or  warnings which will certainly lead him straight back to the spot.    In matters of greater moment the same impulse to oppose the will of  those around him is seen. In considering the point of the child's  susceptibility to suggestion, we have mentioned the refusal of sleep  and the refusal of food. In both it is possible to detect the  influence of this pronounced force of opposition. As the child lies  sobbing or screaming in bed, every new approach to him, every fresh  attempt at pacification, renews the force of his opposition in a  crescendo of sound. But it is in his refusal of food that the child is  apt to find his chief opportunity. Meal-times degenerate into a  struggle. There at least he can show his complete mastery of the  situation. No one can swallow his food for him, and he knows it. He  can clench his teeth and shake his head and obstinately refuse every  morsel offered. He can hold food in his mouth for half an hour at a  time and remain deaf to all the appeals of his helpless nurse. If she  tries force, he quells the attempt by a storm of crying. If she  declines upon entreaty and coaxing, he will not be persuaded. It is  the little scene of the fireplace over again. The attempts at force or  the attempts at persuasion, by making much of it, have concentrated  the attention of the child upon the difficulty, and have taught him  his own power to dominate the situation.    It is right that parents should realise that the disturbing and  irritating element in the child's environment is nearly always  provided by the intrusion of the adult mind and its contact with the  child's. Some supervision and some intrusion, therefore, is of course  absolutely necessary, but the best-regulated nursery is that in which  it is least evident. Something is definitely wrong if a child of two  years will not play for half an hour at a time happily and busily in a  room by himself. It is an even better test if the child will play  amicably by himself with nurse or mother in the room, without the two  parties crossing swords on a single occasion, without reproof or  repression on the one side or undue attempts to attract attention on  the other. If the child is entirely dependent upon the participation  of grown-up persons in his pursuits, then not only do those pursuits  lose much of their educative force, but they become a positive source  of danger because of the constant interplay of personality with  personality. The child who, seated on the ground, will play with his  toys by himself, rises with a brain that is stimulated but not  exhausted. Only very rarely do we find that solitary play, or play  between children, is too exciting. In older children of very quick  intelligence and nervous temperament we occasionally find that the  pace which they themselves set is too exciting or exhausting. I recall  a little boy of seven, an only child of particularly wise and  thoughtful parents, who was brought to me with the complaint that he  exhausted himself utterly both in body and mind by the intense nervous  energy which he threw into his pursuits. For instance, he had been  interested in the maps illustrating the various fronts in the European  War, with which the walls of his father's study were hung, and  although left entirely by himself he had become intensely excited and  exhausted by the eagerness with which he had spent a whole morning,  with a wealth of imaginative force, in drawing a map of the garden of  his house and converting it into the likeness of a war map, filled  with imaginary Army Corps. Such excessive expenditure of nervous force  is unusual even in older children, and as in this case is found  usually only when there is a pronounced nervous inheritance. In little  children in the nursery, solitary play or play between themselves  seldom produces nervous exhaustion. It is quite otherwise when the  child is dependent to a too great extent upon the participation of  adults. It is almost impossible for the mother and nurse not to take  the leading part in the exchange of ideas, and no matter what may be  their good intentions, the pace set is apt to be too great.  Environment, without the intrusion of the adult mind, is best able to  adjust the necessary stimulus and produce development without  exhaustion. Play with grown-up persons, the reading aloud of story  books, the showing of pictures, and so forth, undoubtedly have their  own importance, but they should be confined within strict limits and  to"]]]
