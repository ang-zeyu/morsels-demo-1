Monte Irvin staggered and fell back against the Inspector, clutching at  him for support. But Sergeant Burton, who carried the second lantern,  crossed the room and wrenched the green draperies bodily from their  fastenings.    They had masked a wooden partition or stout screen, having an aperture  in the centre which could be closed by means of another of the sliding  doors. A space some five feet deep was thus walled off from this second  room. It contained a massive ebony chair. Behind the chair, and dividing  the second room into yet a third section, extended another wooden  partition in one end of which was an ordinary office door; and  immediately at the back of the chair appeared a little opening or  window, some three feet up from the floor. The sound of a groan,  followed by that of a dull thud, came from the outer room.    \"Hullo!\" cried Inspector Whiteleaf. \"Mr. Irvin has fainted. Lend a  hand.\"    \"I am here,\" replied the quiet voice of Seton Pasha.    \"My God!\" whispered Gray. \"Seton! Seton!\"    \"Touch nothing,\" cried the Inspector from outside, \"until I come!\"    And now the narrow apartment became filled with all the awe-stricken  company, only excepting Monte Irvin, and Brisley, who was attending to  the swooning man.    Flat upon the floor, between the door and the ebony chair, arms extended  and eyes staring upward at the ceiling, lay Sir Lucien Pyne, his white  shirt front redly dyed. In the hush which had fallen, the footsteps  of Inspector Whiteleaf sounded loudly as he opened the final door, and  swept the interior of an inner room with the rays of the lantern.    The room was barely furnished as an office. There was another  half-glazed door opening on to a narrow corridor. This door was locked.    \"Pyne!\" whispered Gray, pale now to the lips. \"Do you understand, Seton?  It's Pyne! Look! He has been stabbed!\"    Sergeant Burton knelt down and gingerly laid his hand upon the stained  linen over the breast of Sir Lucien.    \"Dead?\" asked the Inspector, speaking from the inner doorway.    \"Yes.\"    \"You say, sir,\" turning to Quentin Gray, \"that this is Sir Lucien Pyne?\"    \"Yes.\"    Inspector Whiteleaf rather clumsily removed his cap. The odor of Seton's  cheroot announced itself above the oriental perfume with which the place  was laden.    \"Burton!\"    \"Yes?\"    \"See if this telephone in the office is in order. It appears to be an  extension from the outer room.\"    While the others stood grouped about that still figure on the floor,  Sergeant Burton entered the little office.    \"Hello!\" he cried. \"Yes?\" A momentary interval, then: \"It's all right,  sir. What number?\"    \"Gentlemen,\" said the Inspector, firmly and authoritatively, \"I am about  to telephone to Vine Street for instructions. No one will leave the  premises.\"    Amid an intense hush:    \"Regent 201,\" called Sergeant Burton.        CHAPTER VI. RED KERRY    Chief Inspector Kerry, of the Criminal Investigation Department, stood  before the empty grate of his cheerless office in New Scotland Yard,  one hand thrust into the pocket of his blue reefer jacket and the other  twirling a malacca cane, which was heavily silver-mounted and which  must have excited the envy of every sergeant-major beholding it. Chief  Inspector Kerry wore a very narrow-brimmed bowler hat, having two  ventilation holes conspicuously placed immediately above the band. He  wore this hat tilted forward and to the right.    \"Red Kerry\" wholly merited his sobriquet, for the man was as red  as fire. His hair, which he wore cropped close as a pugilist's, was  brilliantly red, and so was his short, wiry, aggressive moustache.  His complexion was red, and from beneath his straight red eyebrows he  surveyed the world with a pair of unblinking, intolerant steel-blue  eyes. He never smoked in public, as his taste inclined towards  Irish twist and a short clay pipe; but he was addicted to the use of  chewing-gum, and as he chewed--and he chewed incessantly--he revealed a  perfect row of large, white, and positively savage-looking teeth. High  cheek bones and prominent maxillary muscles enhanced the truculence  indicated by his chin.    But, next to this truculence, which was the first and most alarming  trait to intrude itself upon the observer's attention, the outstanding  characteristic of Chief Inspector Kerry was his compact neatness. Of no  more than medium height but with shoulders like an acrobat, he had slim,  straight legs and the feet of a dancing master. His attire, from the  square-pointed collar down to the neat black brogues, was spotless.  His reefer jacket fitted him faultlessly, but his trousers were cut so  unfashionably narrow that the protuberant thigh muscles and the line  of a highly developed calf could quite easily be discerned. The hand  twirling the cane was small but also muscular, freckled and covered with  light down. Red Kerry was built on the lines of a whippet, but carried  the equipment of an Irish terrier.    The telephone bell rang. Inspector Kerry moved his square shoulders in  a manner oddly suggestive of a wrestler, laid the malacca cane on the  mantleshelf, and crossed to the table. Taking up the telephone:    \"Yes?\" he said, and his voice was high-pitched and imperious.    He listened for a moment.    \"Very good, sir.\"    He replaced the receiver, took up a wet oilskin overall from the back of  a chair and the cane from the mantleshelf. Then rolling chewing-gum  from one corner of his mouth into the other, he snapped off the electric  light and walked from the room.    Along the corridor he went with a lithe, silent step, moving from the  hips and swinging his shoulders. Before a door marked \"Private\" he  paused. From his waistcoat pocket he took a little silver convex mirror  and surveyed himself critically therein. He adjusted his neat tie,  replaced the mirror, knocked at the door and entered the room of the  Assistant Commissioner.    This important official was a man constructed on huge principles, a  man of military bearing, having tired eyes and a bewildered manner.  He conveyed the impression that the collection of documents, books,  telephones, and other paraphernalia bestrewing his table had reduced him  to a state of stupor. He looked up wearily and met the fierce gaze of  the chief inspector with a glance almost apologetic.    \"Ah, Chief Inspector Kerry?\" he said, with vague surprise. \"Yes. I told  you to come. Really, I ought to have been at home hours ago. It's  most unfortunate. I have to do the work of three men. This is your  department, is it not, Chief Inspector?\"    He handed Kerry a slip of paper, at which the Chief Inspector stared  fiercely.    \"Murder!\" rapped Kerry. \"Sir Lucien Pyne. Yes, sir, I am still on duty.\"    His speech, in moments of interest, must have suggested to one  overhearing him from an adjoining room, for instance, the operation of a  telegraphic instrument. He gave to every syllable the value of a rap and  certain words he terminated with an audible snap of his teeth.    \"Ah,\" murmured the Assistant Commissioner. \"Yes. Divisional  Inspector--Somebody (I cannot read the name) has detained all the  parties. But you had better report at Vine Street. It appears to be a  big case.\"    He sighed wearily.    \"Very good, sir. With your permission I will glance at Sir Lucien's  pedigree.\"    \"Certainly--certainly,\" said the Assistant Commissioner, waving one  large hand in the direction of a bookshelf.    Kerry crossed the room, laid his oilskin and cane upon a chair, and  from the shelf where it reposed took a squat volume. The Assistant  Commissioner, hand pressed to brow, began to study a document which lay  before him.    \"Here we are,\" said Kerry, sotto voce. \"Pyne, Sir Lucien St. Aubyn,  fourth baronet, son of General Sir Christian Pyne, K.C.B. H'm! Born  Malta.... Oriel College; first in classics.... H'm. Blue.... India,  Burma.... Contested Wigan.... attached British Legation. ... H'm!...\"    He returned the book to its place, took up his overall and cane, and:    \"Very good, sir,\" he said. \"I will proceed to Vine Street.\"    \"Certainly--certainly,\" murmured the Assistant Commissioner, glancing up  absently. \"Good night.\"    \"Good night, sir.\"    \"Oh, Chief Inspector!\"    Kerry turned, his hand on the door-knob.    \"Sir?\"    \"I--er--what was I going to say? Oh, yes! The social importance of  the murdered man raises the case from the--er--you follow me? Public  interest will become acute, no doubt. I have therefore selected you  for your well known discretion. I met Sir Lucien once. Very sad. Good  night.\"    \"Good night, sir.\"    Kerry passed out into the corridor, closing the door quietly. The  Assistant Commissioner was a man for whom he entertained the highest  respect. Despite the bewildered air and wandering manner, he knew this  big, tired-looking soldier for an administrator of infinite capacity and  inexhaustive energy.    Proceeding to a room further along the corridor, Chief Inspector Kerry  opened the door and looked in.    \"Detective-Sergeant Coombes.\" he snapped, and rolled chewing-gum from  side to side of his mouth.    Detective-Sergeant Coombes, a plump, short man having lank black hair  and a smile of sly contentment perpetually adorning his round face, rose  hurriedly from the chair upon which he had been seated. Another man who  was in the room rose also, as if galvanized by the glare of the fierce  blue eyes.    \"I'm going to Vine Street,\" said Kerry succinctly; \"you're coming with  me,\" turned, and went on his way.    Two taxicabs were standing in the yard, and into the first of these  Inspector Kerry stepped, followed by Coombes, the latter breathing  heavily and carrying his hat in his hand, since he had not yet found  time to put it on.    \"Vine Street,\" shouted Kerry. \"Brisk.\"    He leaned back in the cab, chewing industriously. Coombes, having  somewhat recovered his breath, essayed speech. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1183"],[0,"The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu (#6)"],[1,"forward, and the dying light of the match  touched that other face.    \"Oh, God!\" whispered Smith.    A faint puff of wind extinguished the match.    In all my surgical experience I had never met with anything quite so  horrible. Forsyth's livid face was streaked with tiny streams of blood,  which proceeded from a series of irregular wounds. One group of these  clustered upon his left temple, another beneath his right eye, and  others extended from the chin down to the throat. They were black,  almost like tattoo marks, and the entire injured surface was bloated  indescribably. His fists were clenched; he was quite rigid.    Smith's piercing eyes were set upon me eloquently as I knelt on the path  and made my examination--an examination which that first glimpse when  Forsyth came staggering out from the trees had rendered useless--a mere  matter of form.    \"He's quite dead, Smith,\" I said huskily. \"It's--unnatural--it--\"    Smith began beating his fist into his left palm and taking little,  short, nervous strides up and down beside the dead man. I could hear a  car humming along the highroad, but I remained there on my knees staring  dully at the disfigured bloody face which but a matter of minutes  since had been that of a clean looking British seaman. I found myself  contrasting his neat, squarely trimmed mustache with the bloated face  above it, and counting the little drops of blood which trembled upon  its edge. There were footsteps approaching. I stood up. The footsteps  quickened; and I turned as a constable ran up.    \"What's this?\" he demanded gruffly, and stood with his fists clenched,  looking from Smith to me and down at that which lay between us. Then his  hand flew to his breast; there was a silvern gleam and--    \"Drop that whistle!\" snapped Smith--and struck it from the man's hand.  \"Where's your lantern? Don't ask questions!\"    The constable started back and was evidently debating upon his chances  with the two of us, when my friend pulled a letter from his pocket and  thrust it under the man's nose.    \"Read that!\" he directed harshly, \"and then listen to my orders.\"    There was something in his voice which changed the officer's opinion of  the situation. He directed the light of his lantern upon the open letter  and seemed to be stricken with wonder.    \"If you have any doubts,\" continued Smith--\"you may not be familiar with  the Commissioner's signature--you have only to ring up Scotland Yard  from Dr. Petrie's house, to which we shall now return, to disperse  them.\" He pointed to Forsyth. \"Help us to carry him there. We must not  be seen; this must be hushed up. You understand? It must not get into  the press--\"    The man saluted respectfully; and the three of us addressed ourselves  to the mournful task. By slow stages we bore the dead man to the edge  of the common, carried him across the road and into my house, without  exciting attention even on the part of those vagrants who nightly slept  out in the neighborhood.    We laid our burden upon the surgery table.    \"You will want to make an examination, Petrie,\" said Smith in his  decisive way, \"and the officer here might 'phone for the ambulance. I  have some investigations to make also. I must have the pocket lamp.\"    He raced upstairs to his room, and an instant later came running down  again. The front door banged.    \"The telephone is in the hall,\" I said to the constable.    \"Thank you, sir.\"    He went out of the surgery as I switched on the lamp over the table and  began to examine the marks upon Forsyth's skin. These, as I have said,  were in groups and nearly all in the form of elongated punctures; a  fairly deep incision with a pear-shaped and superficial scratch beneath  it. One of the tiny wounds had penetrated the right eye.    The symptoms, or those which I had been enabled to observe as Forsyth  had first staggered into view from among the elms, were most puzzling.  Clearly enough, the muscles of articulation and the respiratory muscles  had been affected; and now the livid face, dotted over with tiny wounds  (they were also on the throat), set me mentally groping for a clue to  the manner of his death.    No clue presented itself; and my detailed examination of the body  availed me nothing. The gray herald of dawn was come when the police  arrived with the ambulance and took Forsyth away.    I was just taking my cap from the rack when Nayland Smith returned.    \"Smith!\" I cried--\"have you found anything?\"    He stood there in the gray light of the hallway, tugging at the lobe of  his left ear, an old trick of his.    The bronzed face looked very gaunt, I thought, and his eyes were bright  with that febrile glitter which once I had disliked, but which I had  learned from experience were due to tremendous nervous excitement.  At such times he could act with icy coolness and his mental faculties  seemed temporarily to acquire an abnormal keenness. He made no direct  reply; but--    \"Have you any milk?\" he jerked abruptly.    So wholly unexpected was the question, that for a moment I failed to  grasp it. Then--    \"Milk!\" I began.    \"Exactly, Petrie! If you can find me some milk, I shall be obliged.\"    I turned to descend to the kitchen, when--    \"The remains of the turbot from dinner, Petrie, would also be welcome,  and I think I should like a trowel.\"    I stopped at the stairhead and faced him.    \"I cannot suppose that you are joking, Smith,\" I said, \"but--\"    He laughed dryly.    \"Forgive me, old man,\" he replied. \"I was so preoccupied with my own  train of thought that it never occurred to me how absurd my request must  have sounded. I will explain my singular tastes later; at the moment,  hustle is the watchword.\"    Evidently he was in earnest, and I ran downstairs accordingly, returning  with a garden trowel, a plate of cold fish and a glass of milk.    \"Thanks, Petrie,\" said Smith--\"If you would put the milk in a jug--\"    I was past wondering, so I simply went and fetched a jug, into which he  poured the milk. Then, with the trowel in his pocket, the plate of cold  turbot in one hand and the milk jug in the other, he made for the door.  He had it open when another idea evidently occurred to him.    \"I'll trouble you for the pistol, Petrie.\"    I handed him the pistol without a word.    \"Don't assume that I want to mystify you,\" he added, \"but the presence  of any one else might jeopardize my plan. I don't expect to be long.\"    The cold light of dawn flooded the hallway momentarily; then the door  closed again and I went upstairs to my study, watching Nayland Smith as  he strode across the common in the early morning mist. He was making for  the Nine Elms, but I lost sight of him before he reached them.    I sat there for some time, watching for the first glow of sunrise. A  policeman tramped past the house, and, a while later, a belated reveler  in evening clothes. That sense of unreality assailed me again. Out there  in the gray mists a man who was vested with powers which rendered him a  law unto himself, who had the British Government behind him in all that  he might choose to do, who had been summoned from Rangoon to London on  singular and dangerous business, was employing himself with a plate of  cold turbot, a jug of milk, and a trowel!    Away to the right, and just barely visible, a tramcar stopped by the  common; then proceeded on its way, coming in a westerly direction. Its  lights twinkled yellowly through the grayness, but I was less concerned  with the approaching car than with the solitary traveler who had  descended from it.    As the car went rocking by below me, I strained my eyes in an endeavor  more clearly to discern the figure, which, leaving the highroad, had  struck out across the common. It was that of a woman, who seemingly  carried a bulky bag or parcel.    One must be a gross materialist to doubt that there are latent powers in  man which man, in modern times, neglects, or knows not how to develop. I  became suddenly conscious of a burning curiosity respecting this lonely  traveler who traveled at an hour so strange. With no definite plan in  mind, I went downstairs, took a cap from the rack, and walked briskly  out of the house and across the common in a direction which I thought  would enable me to head off the woman.    I had slightly miscalculated the distance, as Fate would have it, and  with a patch of gorse effectually screening my approach, I came upon  her, kneeling on the damp grass and unfastening the bundle which had  attracted my attention. I stopped and watched her.    She was dressed in bedraggled fashion in rusty black, wore a common  black straw hat and a thick veil; but it seemed to me that the dexterous  hands at work untying the bundle were slim and white; and I perceived a  pair of hideous cotton gloves lying on the turf beside her. As she threw  open the wrappings and lifted out something that looked like a  small shrimping net, I stepped around the bush, crossed silently the  intervening patch of grass, and stood beside her.    A faint breath of perfume reached me--of a perfume which, like the  secret incense of Ancient Egypt, seemed to assail my soul. The glamour  of the Orient was in that subtle essence; and I only knew one woman who  used it. I bent over the kneeling figure.    \"Good morning,\" I said; \"can I assist you in any way?\"    She came to her feet like a startled deer, and flung away from me with  the lithe movement of some Eastern dancing girl.    Now came the sun, and its heralding rays struck sparks from the  jewels upon the white fingers of this woman who wore the garments of  a mendicant. My heart gave a great leap. It was with difficulty that I  controlled my voice.    \"There is no cause for alarm,\" I added.    She stood watching me; even through the coarse veil I could see how her  eyes glittered. I stooped and picked up the net.    \"Oh!\" The whispered word was scarcely audible, but it was enough; I  doubted no longer.    \"This is a "]]]
