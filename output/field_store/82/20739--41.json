They obtain a grant in aid from Parliament, spend vast sums, and  often find their work entirely thrown away, or proving itself most  disastrous to their neighbours. If you protect one part of the coast  you destroy another. Such is the rule of the sea. If you try to beat  it back at one point it will revenge itself on another. If only you  can cause shingle to accumulate before your threatened town or  homestead, you know you can make the place safe and secure from the  waves. But if you stop this flow of shingle you may protect your own  homes, but you deprive your neighbours of this safeguard against the  ravages of the sea. It was so at Deal. The good folks of Deal placed  groynes in order to stop the flow of shingle and protect the town.  They did their duty well; they stopped the shingle and made a good  bulwark against the sea. With what result? In a few years' time they  caused the destruction of Sandown, which had been deprived of its  natural protection. Mr. W. Whitaker, F.R.S., who has walked along the  whole coast from Norfolk to Cornwall, besides visiting other parts of  our English shore, and whose contributions to the Report of the Royal  Commission on Coast Erosion are so valuable, remembers when a boy the  Castle of Sandown, which dated from the time of Henry VIII. It was  then in a sound condition and was inhabited. Now it is destroyed, and  the batteries farther north have gone too. The same thing is going on  at Dover. The Admiralty Pier causes the accumulation of shingle on its  west side, and prevents it from following its natural course in a  north-easterly direction. Hence the base of the cliffs on the other  side of the pier and harbour is left bare and unprotected; this aids  erosion, and not unfrequently do we hear of the fall of the chalk  cliffs.    Isolated schemes for the prevention of coast erosion are of little  avail. They can do no good, and only increase the waste and  destruction of land in neighbouring shores. Stringent laws should be  passed to prevent the taking away of shingle from protecting beaches,  and to prohibit the ploughing of land near the edge of cliffs, which  greatly assists atmospheric destructive action from above. The State  has recently threatened the abandonment of the coastguard service.  This would be a disastrous policy. Though the primary object of  coastguards, the prevention of smuggling, has almost passed away, the  old sailors who act as guardians of our coast-line render valuable  services to the country. They are most useful in looking after the  foreshore. They save many lives from wrecked vessels, and keep watch  and ward to guard our shores, and give timely notice of the advance of  a hostile fleet, or of that ever-present foe which, though it affords  some protection for our island home from armed invasion, does not fail  to exact a heavy tithe from the land it guards, and has destroyed so  many once flourishing towns and villages by its ceaseless attack.          CHAPTER III    OLD WALLED TOWNS      The destruction of ancient buildings always causes grief and distress  to those who love antiquity. It is much to be deplored, but in some  cases is perhaps inevitable. Old-fashioned half-timbered shops with  small diamond-paned windows are not the most convenient for the  display of the elegant fashionable costumes effectively draped on  modelled forms. Motor-cars cannot be displayed in antiquated old  shops. Hence in modern up-to-date towns these old buildings are  doomed, and have to give place to grand emporiums with large  plate-glass windows and the refinements of luxurious display. We hope  to visit presently some of the old towns and cities which happily  retain their ancient beauties, where quaint houses with oversailing  upper stories still exist, and with the artist's aid to describe many  of their attractions.    Although much of the destruction is, as I have said, inevitable, a  vast amount is simply the result of ignorance and wilful perversity.  Ignorant persons get elected on town councils--worthy men doubtless,  and able men of business, who can attend to and regulate the financial  affairs of the town, look after its supply of gas and water, its  drainage and tramways; but they are absolutely ignorant of its  history, its associations, of architectural beauty, of anything that  is not modern and utilitarian. Unhappily, into the care of such men as  these is often confided the custody of historic buildings and  priceless treasures, of ruined abbey and ancient walls, of objects  consecrated by the lapse of centuries and by the associations of  hundreds of years of corporate life; and it is not surprising that in  many cases they betray their trust. They are not interested in such  things. \"Let bygones be bygones,\" they say. \"We care not for old  rubbish.\" Moreover, they frequently resent interference and  instruction. Hence they destroy wholesale what should be preserved,  and England is the poorer.    Not long ago the Edwardian wall of Berwick-on-Tweed was threatened  with demolition at the hands of those who ought to be its  guardians--the Corporation of the town. An official from the Office of  Works, when he saw the begrimed, neglected appearance of the two  fragments of this wall near the Bell Tower, with a stagnant pool in  the fosse, bestrewed with broken pitchers and rubbish, reported that  the Elizabethan walls of the town which were under the direction of  the War Department were in excellent condition, whereas the Edwardian  masonry was utterly neglected. And why was this relic of the town's  former greatness to be pulled down? Simply to clear the site for the  erection of modern dwelling-houses. A very strong protest was made  against this act of municipal barbarism by learned societies, the  Society for the Preservation of Ancient Buildings, and others, and we  hope that the hand of the destroyer has been stayed.    Most of the principal towns in England were protected by walls, and  the citizens regarded it as a duty to build them and keep them in  repair. When we look at some of these fortifications, their strength,  their height, their thickness, we are struck by the fact that they  were very great achievements, and that they must have been raised with  immense labour and gigantic cost. In turbulent and warlike times they  were absolutely necessary. Look at some of these triumphs of medieval  engineering skill, so strong, so massive, able to defy the attacks of  lance and arrow, ram or catapult, and to withstand ages of neglect and  the storms of a tempestuous clime. Towers and bastions stood at  intervals against the wall at convenient distances, in order that  bowmen stationed in them could shoot down any who attempted to scale  the wall with ladders anywhere within the distance between the  towers. All along the wall there was a protected pathway for the  defenders to stand, and machicolations through which boiling oil or  lead, or heated sand could be poured on the heads of the attacking  force. The gateways were carefully constructed, flanked by defending  towers with a portcullis, and a guard-room overhead with holes in the  vaulted roof of the gateway for pouring down inconvenient substances  upon the heads of the besiegers. There were several gates, the usual  number being four; but Coventry had twelve, Canterbury six, and  Newcastle-on-Tyne seven, besides posterns.    [Illustration: Old Houses built on the Town Wall, Rye]    Berwick-upon-Tweed, York, Chester, and Conway have maintained their  walls in good condition. Berwick has three out of its four gates still  standing. They are called Scotchgate, Shoregate, and Cowgate, and in  the last two still remain the original massive wooden gates with their  bolts and hinges. The remaining fourth gate, named Bridgate, has  vanished. We have alluded to the neglect of the Edwardian wall and its  threatened destruction. Conway has a wall a mile and a quarter in  length, with twenty-one semicircular towers along its course and three  great gateways besides posterns. Edward I built this wall in order to  subjugate the Welsh, and also the walls round Carnarvon, some of which  survive, and Beaumaris. The name of his master-mason has been  preserved, one Henry le Elreton. The muniments of the Corporation of  Alnwick prove that often great difficulties arose in the matter of  wall-building. Its closeness to the Scottish border rendered a wall  necessary. The town was frequently attacked and burnt. The inhabitants  obtained a licence to build a wall in 1433, but they did not at once  proceed with the work. In 1448 the Scots came and pillaged the town,  and the poor burgesses were so robbed and despoiled that they could  not afford to proceed with the wall and petitioned the King for aid.  Then Letters Patent were issued for a collection to be made for the  object, and at last, forty years after the licence was granted,  Alnwick got its wall, and a very good wall it was--a mile in  circumference, twenty feet in height and six in thickness; \"it had  four gateways--Bondgate, Clayport, Pottergate, and Narrowgate. Only  the first-named of these is standing. It is three stories in height.  Over the central archway is a panel on which was carved the Brabant  lion, now almost obliterated. On either side is a semi-octagonal  tower. The masonry is composed of huge blocks to which time and  weather have given dusky tints. On the front facing the expected foes  the openings are but little more than arrow-slits; on that within,  facing the town, are well-proportioned mullioned and transomed  windows. The great ribbed archway is grooved for a portcullis, now  removed, and a low doorway on either side gives entrance to the  chambers in the towers. Pottergate was rebuilt in the eighteenth  century and crowns a steep street; only four corner-stones marked T  indicate the site of Clayport. No trace of Narrowgate remains.\"[4]   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14760"],[0,"Report of the Special Committee on Moral Delinquency in Children and Adolescents (#6)"],[1," not received any definite  evidence of this practice occurring in New Zealand.      =(2) Films=    The cinema is the only field of entertainment in New Zealand where  official supervision in the interest of juveniles is exercised by a  public servant with statutory powers. The Government Film Censor  interprets his role chiefly as one of guiding parents. On occasions he  bans a film; more often he makes cuts in films; most often he recommends  a restriction of attendance to certain age groups. The onus is then on  parents to follow the censor's advice, on theatre managers to adhere to  his rulings, and on the Government to see that the law is enforced.    It is not part of the censor's duty to see that his rulings are  observed. A survey taken in 1952 revealed that about one-quarter of all  films advertised in the press were advertised with wrong certificates.  Reliance upon such incorrect advertisements therefore deprived parents  of the protection which the legislature intended for them.    Few prosecutions have ever been taken for such offences, and it is even  doubtful whether, if they were taken, convictions would be recorded.  Some regulations (essential for this purpose) under the 1934 Amendment  Act have never been gazetted; nor have any under the 1953 amendment.    Although the censor receives few specific complaints, and although film  distributing and exhibiting interests state that they are complying with  the spirit of the unwritten law, the following undesirable practices  irritate a large section of the thinking public:      _(a) Publication of Grossly Extravagant Posters and Newspaper    Advertisements_ in which sex and sadism are often featured. The    theatre managers concerned state most definitely that nothing more    than genuine showmanship is behind this.      _(b) Screening of Inappropriate Trailers on Unsuitable Occasions:_    By their very nature, trailers are difficult to censor adequately    and, because of their origin and intent, are designed to have an    exaggerated impact upon audiences. Trailers of the worst type,    however, are sometimes shown at special children's sessions.      _(c) Mixing \"A\" and \"U\" Certificate Films:_ In the words of the    exhibitors, this is done \"to obtain balanced programmes\".      _(d) Admitting Children and Adolescents to Films With Restricted    Certificates:_ It is difficult for theatre managers to determine    the age of their patrons, and the warning notice of restricted    attendance exhibited at the theatre may have little effect. Should    the age be queried when entry is sought, an incorrect answer will    probably be given. Worst of all, perhaps, should the presence of    an accompanying adolescent or adult be required, there is always    the danger of undesirable strangers taking the place of a _bona    fide_ parent or friend.      _(e) Misbehaviour in Theatres:_ Once inside a darkened theatre,    children, adolescents, and undesirable persons may behave    improperly and the manager may have difficulty in exercising    control.           *       *       *       *       *    Appropriate steps recommended are:      (i) The gazetting of the outstanding regulations empowered by the    1934 and 1953 Amendment Acts.      (ii) The provision to the maximum extent possible of    non-restricted or \"U\" programmes for children's sessions.      (iii) The drawing of the attention of parents, repeatedly, to the    fact that through the censor's certificates they, the parents,    have a reliable guide provided exclusively for their benefit and    intended for their use.      =(3) Broadcasting=    Disapproval has been expressed of many of the broadcast serials and  suggestive love songs. If considered dispassionately by adults, most of  these are merely trashy, but quite possibly, and particularly in times  like the present, the words of a song, or the incidents of a serial, may  more readily give offence. Obviously, the New Zealand Broadcasting  Service can never please each individual listener, but, equally  obviously, it should seek to avoid giving any public offence. The  Service seems conscious of its responsibilities and tries to make its  programmes generally suitable for family audiences; but it also aims to  reflect the standards of its listeners, and some may feel that it should  try to raise those standards.    Although the Service considers that it should never give the appearance  of dictating what listeners should, or should not, hear, it has its own  auditioning standards that should satisfy the morals of the most  particular. Records must first conform with the very strict code of the  Broadcasting Service, after which they are classified as suitable for  children's sessions, for general sessions, or only for times when  children are assumed not to be listening. The Service can, and does,  reject episodes from overseas features, and in doing so experiences no  difficulty with either overseas suppliers or local advertising sponsors.  Restrictions on dollar purchases and the nonavailability of  \"sponsorable\" programmes from the United Kingdom curtail the  availability of commercial features, and generally restrict them to  those produced in Australia.    On the other hand, the Service points out that listeners have a wide  choice of broadcast programmes, advertised well in advance, and it  assumes that listeners will be selective in tuning in their sets, and  restrictive in not allowing their children to listen after 7 p.m. when  programmes specially suited for them cease. This assumption, however, is  not well founded. Once switched on, the radio frequently stays on, and  children are then allowed to continue listening far too long.  Consequently, they not only lose part of their essential sleep, and  sometimes even the mental state conducive to sleep, but they hear radio  programmes not intended for them.    Just when, how long, and how often, children, adolescents, and even  parents listen to the radio is something that has never been accurately  determined in New Zealand. It is well known that young children listen  after 7 p.m. and that adolescents listen until a very late hour,  particularly on holidays, and for this last-named fact no allowance is  made when the programmes are being arranged. Adolescents listening to  the latest songs stimulate the demand for popular sheet music. It is the  words of those \"hits\" that form the chief target for criticism  expressed to this Committee. Popular songs are transitory in nature, and  it is the tune, rather than the words, that makes an impression.    Crime serials for the young, and the not so young, are another target  for criticism, but provided that the Service is adamant in its rule that  \"crime must never pay\" loss of sleep is, possibly, the most serious  consequence of over-indulgence by child listeners.    Some people claim that they can detect a definite pattern of suggestive  songs and unsuitable thrillers in the programmes. In times like the  present the Service should critically re-examine its programmes in order  to remove any wrongful impression that might be created, either by a too  frequent repetition of items where sex and crime are prominent, or by  the possibility of a meaning being taken out of them which was not  intended.    The Broadcasting Service should similarly review its ideas about  children's listening hours and rearrange its classified times  accordingly.    When crime serials are broadcast it should be made obvious that crime  does not pay.    A married woman might well be included on the auditioning panel.    Even if the Service does all these things, the major responsibility will  still rest upon the parents, who should select their children's  programmes and see that their listening hours are reasonably restricted.      =(4) Press Advertising=    An examination of advertisements in New Zealand newspapers during recent  years clearly shows how far the bounds of propriety have been extended.  What was a generation ago considered improper is now generally accepted  as a subject for display. Advertisements, more and more based on sex  attraction, horror, and crime, occupy a large and increasing proportion  of all advertising. Because this trend is obviously objectionable to a  section of the community, such advertising must partially fail in its  object of attracting. In addition, this advertising may be harmful to  those juveniles and adolescents with whom this Committee is primarily  concerned. Advertisers should, in their own interests, raise their  standards--perhaps by establishing a voluntary Advisory Council similar  to that in the United Kingdom.      =(5) Television=    Although television is not yet available in New Zealand, its  introduction is inevitable. Overseas reports of its effects on children,  adolescents, and even adults indicate that plans to minimize any harmful  effects in New Zealand should be made without delay.    The arrival of another visual and auditory influence will add weight to  the suggestion made to the Committee that liaison should be established  between all the various censoring authorities.           *       *       *       *       *    Objectionable publications, films, broadcasting, and television have  been the subject of expert appraisal in many countries. The Committee  has made its recommendations in this section of the report fully aware  that many authorities can describe these matters as no more than  secondary influences in the causation of juvenile delinquency.    To what degree these things are directly causative no one can say. Their  influence is imponderable. But whatever their influence, the Committee  is firmly of the opinion that practical measures to control what is  offensive to many would be an indication of a renewed concern for the  moral welfare of young people. The result would be the replacement of  undesirable material with something much better.          _VIII. The School_    =(1) Teacher"]]]
