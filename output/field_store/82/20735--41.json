His own aim was to maintain the catholic tradition of  Judaism, while at the same time expounding the Torah according to the  conceptions of ancient philosophy. Unfortunately, the balance was not  preserved by those who followed him, and the branch of Judaism that  had blossomed forth so fruitfully fell off from the parent tree. But  till the middle of the first century of the common era the Alexandrian  and the Palestinian developments of Jewish culture were complementary:  on the one side there was legal, on the other, philosophical  expansion. Moreover, the Judaeo-Alexandrian school, though, through its  abandonment of the Hebrew tongue, it lies outside the main stream of  Judaism, was an immense force in the religious history of the world,  and Philo, its greatest figure, stands out in our annals as the  embodiment of the Jewish religious mission, which is to preach to the  nations the knowledge of the one God, and the law of righteousness.           *       *       *       *       *          II    THE LIFE AND TIMES OF PHILO      \"The hero,\" says Carlyle, \"can be poet, prophet, king, priest, or what  you will, according to the kind of world he finds himself born  into.\"[39] The Jews have not been a great political people, but their  excellence has been a peculiar spiritual development: and therefore  most of their heroes have been men of thought rather than action,  writers rather than statesmen, men whose influence has been greater on  posterity than upon their own generation. Of Philo's life we know one  incident in very full detail, the rest we can only reconstruct from  stray hints in his writings, and a few short notices of the  commentators. From that incident also, which we know to have taken  place in the year 40 C.E., we can fix the general chronology of his  life and works. He speaks of himself as an old man in relating it, so  that his birth may be safely placed at about 20 B.C.E. The first part  of his life therefore was passed during the tranquil era in which  Augustus and Tiberius were reorganizing the Roman Empire after a  half-century of war; but he was fated to see more troublesome times  for his people, when the emperor Gaius, for a miserable eight years,  harassed the world with his mad escapades. In the riots which ensued  upon the attempt to deprive the Jews of their religious freedom his  brother the alabarch was imprisoned;[40] and he himself was called  upon to champion the Alexandrian community in its hour of need.  Although the ascent of the stupid but honest Claudius dispelled  immediate danger from the Jews and brought them a temporary increase  of favor in Alexandria as well as in Palestine, Philo did not return  entirely to the contemplative life which he loved; and throughout the  latter portion of his life he was the public defender as well as the  teacher of his people. He probably died before the reign of Nero,  between 50 and 60 C.E. In Jewish history his life covered the reigns  of King Herod, his sons, and King Agrippa, when the Jewish kingdom  reached its height of outward magnificence; and it extended probably  up to the ill-omened conversion of Judaea into a Roman province under  the rule of a procurator. It is noteworthy also that Philo was partly  contemporary with Hillel, who came from Babylon to Jerusalem in 30  B.C.E., and according to the accepted tradition was president of the  Sanhedrin till his death in 10 C.E. In this epoch Judaism, by contact  with external forces, was thoroughly self-conscious, and the world was  most receptive of its teaching; hence it spread itself far and wide,  and at the same time reached its greatest spiritual intensity. Hillel  and Philo show the splendid expansion of the Hebrew mind. In the  history of most races national greatness and national genius appear  together. The two grandest expressions of Jewish genius immediately  preceded the national downfall. For the genius of Judaism is  religious, and temporal power is not one of the conditions of its  development.    Philo belonged to the most distinguished Jewish family of  Alexandria,[41] and according to Jerome and Photius, the ancient  authorities for his life, was of the priestly rank; his brother  Alexander Lysimachus was not only the governor of the Jewish  community, but also the alabarch, _i.e._, ruler of the whole Delta  region, and enjoyed the confidence of Mark Antony, who appointed him  guardian of his second daughter Antonia, the mother of Germanicus and  the Roman emperor Claudius. Born in an atmosphere of power and  affluence, Philo, who might have consorted with princes, devoted  himself from the first with all his soul to a life of contemplation;  like a Palestinian rabbi he regarded as man's highest duty the study  of the law and the knowledge of God.[42] This is the way in which he  understood the philosopher's life[43]: man's true function is to know  God, and to make God known: he can know God only through His  revelation, and he can comprehend that revelation only by continued  study. [Hebrew: v-nbi' lbb hkma], God's interpreter must have a wise  heart,[44] as the rabbis explained. Philo then considered that the true  understanding of the law required a complete knowledge of general culture,  and that secular philosophy was a necessary preparation for the deeper  mysteries of the Holy Word. \"He who is practicing to abide in the city  of perfect virtue, before he can be inscribed as a citizen thereof,  must sojourn with the 'encyclic' sciences, so that through them he may  advance securely to perfect goodness.\"[45] The \"encyclic,\" or  encyclopaedic sciences, to which he refers, are the various branches of  Greek culture, and Philo finds a symbol of their place in life in the  story of Abraham. Abraham is the eternal type of the seeker after God,  and as he first consorted with the foreign woman Hagar and had  offspring by her, and afterwards in his mature age had offspring by  Sarah, so in Philo's interpretation the true philosopher must first  apply himself to outside culture and enlarge his mind with that  training; and when his ideas have thus expanded, he passes on to the  more sublime philosophy of the Divine law, and his mind is fruitful in  lofty thoughts.[46]    As a prelude to the study of Greek philosophy he built up a harmony of  the mind by a study of Greek poetry, rhetoric, music, mathematics, and  the natural sciences. His works bear witness to the thoroughness with  which he imbibed all that was best in Greek literature. His Jewish  predecessors had written in the impure dialect of the Hellenistic  colonies (the [Greek: koine dialektos]), and had shown little  literary charm; but Philo's style is more graceful than that of any  Greek prose writer since the golden age of the fourth century. Like  his thought, indeed, it is eclectic and not always clear, but full of  reminiscences of the epic and tragic poets on the one hand, and of  Plato on the other,[47] it gives a happy blending of prose and poetry,  which admirably fits the devotional philosophy that forms its subject.  And what was said of Plato by a Greek critic applies equally well to  Philo: \"He rises at times above the spirit of prose in such a way that  he appears to be instinct, not with human understanding, but with a  Divine oracle.\" From the study of literature and kindred subjects  Philo passed on to philosophy, and he made himself master of the  teachings of all the chief schools. There was a mingling of all the  world's wisdom at Alexandria in his day; and Philo, like the other  philosophers of the time, shows acquaintance with the ideas of  Egyptian, Chaldean, Persian,[48] and even Indian thought. The chief  Greek schools in his age were the Stoic, the Platonic, the Skeptic and  the Pythagorean, which had each its professors in the Museum and its  popular preachers in the public lecture-halls. Later we will notice  more closely Philo's relations to the Greek philosophers: suffice it  here to say that he was the most distinguished Platonist of his age.    Philo's education therefore was largely Greek, and his method of  thought, and the forms in which his ideas were associated and  impressed, were Greek. It must not be thought, however, that this  involved any weakening of his Judaism, or detracted from the purity of  his belief. Far from it. The Torah remained for him the supreme  standard to which all outside knowledge had to be subordinated, and  for which it was a preparation.[49] But Philo brought to bear upon the  elucidation of the Torah and Jewish law and ceremony not only the  religious conceptions of the Jewish mind, but also the intellectual  ideas of Greek philosophy, and he interpreted the Bible in the light  of the broadest culture of his day. Beautiful as are the thoughts and  fancies of the Talmudic rabbis, their Midrash was a purely national  monument, closed by its form as by its language to the general world;  Philo applied to the exposition of Judaism the most highly-trained  philosophic mind of Alexandria, and brought out clearly for the  Hellenistic people the latent philosophy of the Torah.    Greek was his native language, but at the same time he was not, as has  been suggested, entirely ignorant of Hebrew. The Septuagint  translation was the version of the Bible which he habitually used, but  there are passages in his works which show that he knew and  occasionally employed the Hebrew Bible.[50] Moreover, his etymologies  are evidence of his knowledge of the Hebrew language; though he  sometimes gives a symbolic value to Biblical names according to their  Greek equivalent, he more frequently bases his allegory upon a Hebrew  derivation. That all names had a profound meaning, and signified the  true nature of that which they designated, is among the most firmly  established of Philo's ideas. Of his more striking derivations one may  cite Israel, [Hebrew: v-shr-'l], the man"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14667"],[0,"A Christmas Garland (#6)"],[1,"is in the human race some dark spirit of  recalcitrance, always pulling us in the direction contrary to that in  which we are reasonably expected to go. At a funeral, the slightest  thing, not in the least ridiculous at any other time, will convulse  us with internal laughter. At a wedding, we hover mysteriously on the  brink of tears. So it is with the modern Christmas. I find myself in  agreement with the cynics in so far that I admit that Christmas, as  now observed, tends to create melancholy. But the reason for this  lies solely in our own misconception. Christmas is essentially a _dies  irae_. If the cynics will only make up their minds to treat it as such,  even the saddest and most atrabilious of them will acknowledge that he  has had a rollicking day.    This brings me to the second fallacy. I refer to the belief that  \"Christmas comes but once a year.\" Perhaps it does, according to the  calendar--a quaint and interesting compilation, but of little or no  practical value to anybody. It is not the calendar, but the Spirit of  Man that regulates the recurrence of feasts and fasts. Spiritually,  Christmas Day recurs exactly seven times a week. When we have frankly  acknowledged this, and acted on this, we shall begin to realise the  Day's mystical and terrific beauty. For it is only every-day things  that reveal themselves to us in all their wonder and their splendour.  A man who happens one day to be knocked down by a motor-bus merely  utters a curse and instructs his solicitor, but a man who has been  knocked down by a motor-bus every day of the year will have begun to  feel that he is taking part in an august and soul-cleansing ritual.  He will await the diurnal stroke of fate with the same lowly and pious  joy as animated the Hindoos awaiting Juggernaut. His bruises will be  decorations, worn with the modest pride of the veteran. He will cry  aloud, in the words of the late W.E. Henley, \"My head is bloody but  unbowed.\" He will add, \"My ribs are broken but unbent.\"    I look for the time when we shall wish one another a Merry Christmas  every morning; when roast turkey and plum-pudding shall be the staple  of our daily dinner, and the holly shall never be taken down from the  walls, and everyone will always be kissing everyone else under the  mistletoe. And what is right as regards Christmas is right as regards  all other so-called anniversaries. The time will come when we shall  dance round the Maypole every morning before breakfast--a meal at  which hot-cross buns will be a standing dish--and shall make April  fools of one another every day before noon. The profound significance  of All Fool's Day--the glorious lesson that we are all fools--is  too apt at present to be lost. Nor is justice done to the sublime  symbolism of Shrove Tuesday--the day on which all sins are shriven.  Every day pancakes shall be eaten, either before or after the  plum-pudding. They shall be eaten slowly and sacramentally. They shall  be fried over fires tended and kept for ever bright by Vestals. They  shall be tossed to the stars.    I shall return to the subject of Christmas next week.
