In appearance  it differs both in size and in colour from the common wanderoo, being  larger and more inclined to grey; and in habits it is much less  reserved. At Jaffna, and in other parts of the island where the  population is comparatively numerous, these monkeys become so  familiarised with the presence of man as to exhibit the utmost daring  and indifference. A flock of them will take possession of a Palmyra  palm; and so effectually can they crouch and conceal themselves among  the leaves that, on the slightest alarm, the whole party becomes  invisible in an instant. The presence of a dog, however, excites such an  irrepressible curiosity that, in order to watch his movements, they  never fail to betray themselves. They may be frequently seen congregated  on the roof of a native hut: and, some years ago, the child of a  European clergyman stationed near Jaffna having been left on the ground  by the nurse, was so teased and bitten by them as to cause its death.    The Singhalese have the impression that the remains of a monkey are  never to be found in the forest; a belief which they have embodied in  the proverb that \"he who has seen a white crow, the nest of a paddi  bird, a straight coco-nut tree, or a dead monkey, is certain to live  for ever.\" This piece of folk-lore has evidently reached Ceylon from  India, where it is believed that persons dwelling on the spot where a  hanuman monkey, _Semnopithecus entellus_, has been killed, will  die, that even its bones are unlucky, and that no house erected where  they are hid under ground can prosper. Hence when a dwelling is to be  built, it is one of the employments of the Jyotish philosophers to  ascertain by their science that none such are concealed; and Buchanan  observes that \"it is, perhaps, owing to this fear of ill-luck that no  native will acknowledge his having seen a dead hanuman.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: BUCHANAN'S _Survey of Bhagulpoor_, p. 142. At  Gibraltar it is believed that the body of a _dead monkey_ has  never been found on the rock.]    The only other quadrumanous animal found in Ceylon is the little  loris[1], which, from its sluggish movements, nocturnal habits, and  consequent inaction during the day, has acquired the name of the  \"Ceylon Sloth.\"    [Footnote 1: Loris graeilis, _Geof_.]    [Illustration: THE LORIS.]    There are two varieties in the island; one of the ordinary fulvous  brown, and another larger, whose fur is entirely black. A specimen of  the former was sent to me from Chilaw, on the western coast, and lived  for some time at Colombo, feeding on rice, fruit, and vegetables. It was  partial to ants and, other insects, and was always eager for milk or the  bone of a fowl. The naturally slow motion of its limbs enables the loris  to approach its prey so stealthily that it seizes birds before they can  be alarmed by its presence. The natives assert that it has been known to  strangle the pea-fowl at night, to feast on the brain. During the day  the one which I kept was usually asleep in the strange position  represented on the last page; its perch firmly grasped with both hands,  its back curved into a ball of soft fur, and its head hidden deep  between its legs. The singularly-large and intense eyes of the loris  have attracted the attention, of the Singhalese, who capture the  creature for the purpose of extracting them as charms and love-potions,  and this they are said to effect by holding the little animal to the  fire till its eyeballs burst. Its Tamil name is _thaxangu_, or  \"thin-bodied;\" and hence a deformed child or an emaciated person has  acquired in the Tamil districts the same epithet. The light-coloured  variety of the loris in Ceylon has a spot on its forehead, somewhat  resembling the _namam_, or mark worn by the worshippers of Vishnu; and,  from this peculiarity, it is distinguished as the _Nama-thavangu_.[1]    [Footnote 1: There is an interesting notice of the Loris of Ceylon by  Dr. TEMPLETON, in the _Mag. Nat. Hist._ 1844, ch. xiv. p. 362.]    II. CHEIROPTERA. _Bats_.--The multitude of _bats_ is one of the features  of the evening landscape; they abound in every cave and subterranean  passage, in the tunnels on the highways, in the galleries of the  fortifications, in the roofs of the bungalows, and the ruins of every  temple and building. At sunset they are seen issuing from their diurnal  retreats to roam through the twilight in search of crepuscular insects,  and as night approaches and the lights in the rooms attract the  night-flying lepidoptera, the bats sweep round the dinner-table and  carry off their tiny prey within the glitter of the lamps. Including the  frugivorous section about sixteen species have been identified in  Ceylon; and remarkable varieties of two of these are peculiar to the  island. The colours of some of them are as brilliant as the plumage of a  bird, bright yellow, deep orange, and a rich ferruginous brown inclining  to red.[1]    [Footnote 1:    Rhinolophus affinis? _var_. rubidus, _Kelaart_.    Hipposideros murinus, _var_. fulvus, _Kelaart_.    Hipposideros speoris, _var_. aureus, _Kelaart_.    Kerivoula picta, _Pallas_.    Scotophilus Heathii, _Horsf_.]    But of all the bats, the most conspicuous from its size and numbers,  and the most interesting from its habits, is the rousette of  Ceylon[1];--the \"flying fox,\" as it is called by Europeans, from the  similarity to that animal in its head and ears, its bright eyes, and  intelligent little face. In its aspect it has nothing of the  disagreeable and repulsive look so common amongst the ordinary  vespertilionidae; it likewise differs from them in the want of the  nose-leaf, as well as of the tail. In the absence of the latter, its  flight is directed by means of a membrane attached to the inner side  of each of the hind legs, and kept distended at the lower extremity by  a projecting bone, just as a fore-and-aft sail is distended by a  \"gaff.\"    [Footnote 1: Pteropus Edwardsii, _Geoff_.]    [Illustration: FLYING FOXES.]    In size the body measures from ten to twelve inches in length, but the  arms are prolonged, and especially the metacarpal bones and phalanges of  the four fingers over which the leathery wings are distended, till the  alar expanse measures between four and five feet. Whilst the function of  these metamorphosed limbs in sustaining flight entitles them to the  designation of \"wings,\" they are endowed with another faculty, the  existence of which essentially distinguishes them from the feathery  wings of a bird, and vindicates the appropriateness of the term  _Cheiro-ptera_[1], or \"winged hands,\" by which the bats are designated.  Over the entire surface of the thin membrane of which they are formed,  sentient nerves of the utmost delicacy are distributed, by means of  which the animal is enabled during the darkness to direct its motions  with security, avoiding objects against contact with which at such times  its eyes and other senses would be insufficient to protect it.[2]  Spallanzani ascertained the perfection of this faculty by a series of  cruel experiments, by which he demonstrated that bats, even after their  eyes had been destroyed, and their external organs, of smell and hearing  obliterated, were still enabled to direct their flight with unhesitating  confidence, avoiding even threads suspended to intercept them. But after  ascertaining the fact, Spallanzani was slow to arrive at its origin; and  ascribed the surprising power to the existence of some sixth  supplementary sense, the enjoyment of which was withheld from other  animals. Cuvier, however, dissipated the obscurity by showing the seat  of this extraordinary endowment to be in the wings, the superficies of  which retains the exquisite sensitiveness to touch that is inherent in  the palms of the human hand and the extremities of the fingers, as well  as in the feet of some of the mammalia.[3] The face and head of the  _Pteropus_ are covered with brownish-grey hairs, the neck and chest are  dark ferruginous grey, and the rest of the body brown, inclining to  black.    [Footnote 1: [Greek: cheir] the \"hand,\" and [Greek: pteron] a \"wing.\"]    [Footnote 2: See BELL _On the Hand_, ch. iii. p. 70;]    [Footnote 3: See article on _Cheiroptera_, in TODD'S  _Cyclopiadia of Anatomy and Physiology_, vol. i. p. 599.]    These active and energetic creatures, though chiefly frugivorous, are  to some extent insectivorous also, as attested by their teeth[1], as  well as by their habits. They feed, amongst other things, on the  guava, the plantain, the rose-apple, and the fruit of the various  fig-trees. Flying foxes are abundant in all the maritime districts,  especially at the season when the _pulum-imbul_[2], one of the  silk-cotton trees, is putting forth its flower-buds, of which they are  singularly fond. By day they suspend themselves from the highest  branches, hanging by the claws of the hind legs, with the head turned  upwards, and pressing the chin against the breast. At sunset taking  wing, they hover, with a murmuring sound occasioned by the beating of  their broad membranous wings, around the fruit trees, on which they  feed till morning, when they resume their pensile attitude as before.    [Footnote 1: Those which I have examined have four minute incisors in  each jaw, with two canines and a very minute pointed tooth behind each  canine. They have six molars in the upper jaw and ten in the lower,  longitudinally grooved, and with a cutting edge directed backwards.]    [Footnote 2: Eriodendron Orientale, _Stead_.]    A favourite resort of these bats is to the lofty india-rubber trees,  which on one side overhang the Botanic Gardens of Paradenia in the  vicinity of Kandy. Thither for some years past, they have congregated,  chiefly in the autumn, taking their departure when the figs of the  _ficus elastica_ are consumed.

Faith's Chapel. A 'novum opus,' a term applied to some special  building, was also in progress.\" [10] These remarks are of interest,  since about the end of the fourteenth century a beautiful wooden  reredos was built across the east end of the sanctuary. It was placed  just west of the feretory of S. Richard. In many old prints its  character is represented, and Dallaway gives some dimensions of it in  the long section he shows of the church as it was before the reredos  was removed (see page 2). The feretory no doubt had a reredos at this  point, but what the type of this earlier arrangement may have been it  is impossible exactly to tell. But the work which took its place was  evidently beautiful, as the many remains still in existence prove to  those who may examine them. Walcott [11] gives some interesting details  concerning this work. From the representations, descriptions, and  remains of it, it may be gathered that the whole was much carved,  niched, and canopied, and decorated in colour; and there is a note  extant showing that Lambert Bernardi in the sixteenth century repaired  \"the painted cloth of the crucifix over the high altar.\" [12] This  reredos had a gallery across the top of it, from which the candles on  a beam over the altar could be lighted and a watch kept over the  precious jewels in S. Richard's shrine. The whole screen was made of  oak, and those old sketches and drawings, or prints, of it still  preserved, help dimly to show what had been its character. An old  letter in the British Museum refers to it as having the finest \"glory\"  above the high altar \"we have ever seen.\" But this so-called \"glory\"  was an eighteenth-century production. Much of the reredos is still  hidden away unused in the chamber over the present library of the  church, and since its first removal it has travelled as far as London  in search of a friendly purchaser. In the chapter on Chichester in  Winkles's \"Cathedrals\" a view in the \"presbytery,\" dated 1836, [13]  shows the reredos still in its place where it remained till after the  fall of the spire. There are in existence two drawings of considerable  interest. [14] One of these shows the east end and the other the west  end of the choir as it was about the beginning of the last century (c.  1818); the other indicates what were the changes made after 1829, when  the altar was set back six feet farther eastward. The latter was taken  from a water-colour drawing supposed to have been made by Carter, an  architect of Winchester.      [10] Walcott, p. 16.    [11] \"Early Statutes.\"    [12] Walcott, p. 23, note _a_.    [13] See page 45.    [14] See drawings in vestry of cathedral.    Other minor works were added during the fourteenth century, but to few  of these can any exact dates be assigned. The parapets to the north  and south wall of the nave, the choir, and lady-chapel, and the  painted oak choir-stalls were some of those additions.    In the fourteenth century we meet many changes in the treatment of the  windows. They became larger; they were themselves very treasuries of  design, and this not only for the stonework of their tracery, but also  for the very beautiful glass with which they had been filled. Their  outer arches are more varied in shape, more rich in moulded detail,  and the entire character of the curves of the moulded forms had been  developed and made more delicate than the stronger and deeper-cut  types from which they were derived. Two causes had apparently urged  the builders to exert their capacities and apply their increasing  technical skill to compass the aims proposed to them.    The small windows, the use of which had so long prevailed, did not  admit sufficient light. In the more southern countries there was not  the same reason for the change; but where light was less strong, less  clear, less penetrating, it might not be spared. So though with their  glass they were beautiful in themselves, many of these windows gave  place to larger ones. But if the admission of more light was one  reason for the change, there was another powerful inducement offered  by the larger field that might be provided for the use of decorative  colour, and they accepted the opportunity with alacrity--not as a mere  chance for display only, but because, rather, they would be enabled to  teach by the use of it.    But what was that _novum opus_, that special building that was  already in progress in 1402? What was the reason for granting in 1359  the first-fruits of the prebendal stalls to the fabric? And in 1391  why did the dean and chapter give one-twentieth of all their rents to  the works? And these works were not alone about the high altar, for  the new work proceeding in 1402 had no doubt some relation to that  which was in progress in 1391, and it can have been no mere small  undertaking. Can these words be applied to the central tower and the  spire that rose above it, or to the detached bell-tower of Ventnor  stone northward of the church? It seems they must refer to the former,  for to no other work can they be applied, since the angle turrets to  the transept, the parapet of the central tower, and the windows  inserted during the fifteenth century were not in existence at either  of these times. And, further, the action taken in 1359 in order to  provide funds for work that was proceeding could have no reference to  the detached bell-tower, for its character shows that it was certainly  not even begun before quite the end of the fourteenth century,  probably not before some time during the first quarter of the  fifteenth. So, since there was nothing else proceeding about the  structure that could claim such sacrifice, the suggestion occurs that  the spire was already in course of construction not long after the  middle of the fourteenth century. The late Gordon M. Hills, Esq., in  reporting to the chapter in 1892 his opinion concerning the condition  of the fabric, said that, \"Under Bishop William Rede (1369-1385) was  begun a series of works: the completion of the central spire, the  conversion of the north end of the north transept into a perpendicular  work, the construction of a new library, the construction of the  present cloisters, and finally the erection of the great detached  belfry, called 'Raymond's, or Redemond's, or Riman's Tower,' was in  progress in 1411, 1428, and 1436. All this work was carried on partly  by the influence at Chichester of churchmen of the school of William  of Wykeham, whose followers were strong at Chichester at this  era.\" [15]      [15] See the Wykeham motto on the lady-chapel vault decoration, page  92.    [Illustration: THE BELL TOWER AND SPIRE AS SEEN FROM WEST STREET.  _Photochrom Co., Ltd., photo._ ]    He also said \"that the spire itself was commenced before the death of  Bishop Neville. The moulding in the angles cannot, I think, have  originated later\"; and \"that the early work extended to about forty  feet above the tower; all the pinnacles and canopies at the base of  the spire and the upper part of the spire, were insertions and  rebuilding of one hundred years later. At the base the work of the  earlier period had had its face cut away to bond in the later work,  and the masonry of the two periods did not agree in coursing.\"    The mere fact that the detached tower was built suggests many  questions which are not easily solved. Why was it at all necessary?  Perhaps the cathedral bells hung in the south-west tower, and those of  the sub-deanery church in the other, or _vice-versa._ At all events,  we know that in the fifteenth century the sub-deanery church was  removed from the nave to the north arm of the transept. The great  window of the north end of the transept is also early fifteenth  century in date, and the detached tower likewise. Angle turrets were  placed upon the four angles of the transept during the same century;  and if Daniel King's drawing of 1656 is any guide, the tops of the  central and western towers had battlemented parapets added during the  same period. In any case, it appears that it took much longer to  complete the repair of the central tower than that at the south-west.  In fact, it is doubtful whether the former was finished until about  the end of the thirteenth or the beginning of the fourteenth century,  for its fall apparently wrecked much of the vaulting of the transept;  and this, from the character of its moulded and carved vaulting ribs  in the south arm of the transept, is of the same date as the rose  window in the east gable of the presbytery, the rose windows in the  east gables of the lady-chapel and the chapels at the east end of the  north and south aisles of the choir. This argues that at the end of  the thirteenth or the beginning of the fourteenth century, during  Bishop Leophardo's episcopate, these works were completed.    About the middle of the fifteenth century a stone rood screen was  built up between the western piers of the central tower. It thus  separated the choir under the crossing from the nave; but through the  middle of this screen there was an open archway with iron gates. On  either side, as parts of the screen, to the north and south was a  chapel, each with its altar. This new work had been known as the  Arundel screen, and its erection is often attributed to the bishop of  that name, and at the altar in the south side of it Bishop Arundel  founded a chantry for himself. Except that the cloister was added  and some details of the building altered during the fifteenth century,  no other architectural work of any size appears to have been done for  many years.
