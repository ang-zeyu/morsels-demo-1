[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12380"],[0,"Two Thousand Miles on an Automobile (#6)"],[1," does not admit of smart  gowns and gay trappings; it is the last product of a mechanical  age, the triumph of mechanical ingenuity, the harnessing of  mechanical forces for pleasure instead of profit,--the automobile  is the mechanical horse, and, while not as graceful, is infinitely  more powerful, capricious, and dangerous than the ancient beast.          CHAPTER THREE THE START  THE RAILROAD SPIKE    A five o'clock call, though quite in accordance with orders, was  received with some resentment and responded to reluctantly, the  Professor remarking that it seemed but fair to give the slow-going  sun a reasonable start as against the automobile.    About fifty minutes were given to a thorough examination of the  machine. Beyond the tightening of perhaps six or eight nuts there  was nothing to do, everything was in good shape. But there is  hardly a screw or nut on a new automobile that will not require  tightening after a little hard usage; this is quite in the nature  of things, and not a fault. It is only under work that every part  of the machine settles into place. It is of vital importance  during the first few days of a long tour to go over every screw,  nut, and bolt, however firm and tight they may appear.    In time many of the screws and nuts will rust and corrode in place  so as to require no more attention, but all that are subjected to  great vibration will work loose, soon or late. The addition of one  or two extra nuts, if there is room, helps somewhat; but where it  is practical, rivet or upset the bolt with a few blows of the  hammer; or with a punch, cold chisel, or even screw-driver jam the  threads near the nut,--these destructive measures to be adopted  only at points where it is rarely necessary to remove the bolts,  and where possibilities of trouble from loosening are greater than  any trouble that may be caused by destroying the threads.    We left Kendallville at ten minutes past seven; a light rain was  falling which laid the dust for the first two miles. With top,  side curtains, and boot we were perfectly dry, but the air was  uncomfortably cool.    At Butler, an hour and a half later, the rain was coming down  hard, and the roads were beginning to be slippery, with about two  inches of mud and water.    We caught up with an old top buggy, curtains all on and down, a  crate of ducks behind, the horse slowly jogging along at about  three miles per hour. We wished to pass, but at each squawk of the  horn the old lady inside simply put her hand through under the  rear curtain and felt to see what was the matter with her ducks.  We were obliged to shout to attract her attention.    In the country the horn is not so good for attracting attention as  a loud gong. The horn is mistaken for dinner-horns and distant  sounds of farmyard life. One may travel for some distance behind a  wagon-load of people, trying to attract their attention with  blasts on the horn, and see them casually look from side to side  to see whence the sound proceeds, apparently without suspecting it  could come from the highway.    The gong, however, is a well-known means of warning, used by  police and fire departments and by trolley lines, and it works  well in the country.    For some miles the Professor had been drawing things about him,  and as he buttoned a newspaper under his coat remarked, \"The  modern newspaper is admirably designed to keep people warm--both  inside and out. Under circumstances such as these one can  understand why it is sometimes referred to as a 'blanket sheet.'  The morning is almost cold enough for a 'yellow journal,'\" and the  Professor wandered on into an abstract dissertation upon  journalism generally, winding up with the remark that, \"It was the  support of the yellow press which defeated Bryan;\" but then the  Professor is neither a politician nor the son of a politician  --being a Scotchman, and therefore a philosopher and dogmatist. The  pessimistic vein in his remarks was checked by the purchase of a  reversible waterproof shooting-jacket at Butler, several sizes too  large, but warm; and the Professor remarked, as he gathered its  folds about him, \"I was never much of a shot, but with this I  think I'll make a hit.\"    \"Strange how the thickness of a garment alters our views of things  in general,\" I remarked.    \"My dear fellow, philosophy is primarily a matter of food;  secondarily, a matter of clothes: it does not concern the head at  all.\"    At Butler we tightened the clutches, as the roads were becoming  heavier.    At Edgerton the skies were clearing, the roads were so much better  that the last three miles into Ridgeville were made in ten  minutes.    At Napoleon some one advised the road through Bowling Green  instead of what is known as the River road; in a moment of  aberration we took the advice. For some miles the road was being  repaired and almost impassable; farther on it seemed to be a  succession of low, yellow sand-hills, which could only be  surmounted by getting out, giving the machine all its power, and  adding our own in the worst places.    Sand--deep, bottomless sand--is the one obstacle an automobile  cannot overcome. It is possible to traverse roads so rough that  the machine is well-nigh wrenched apart; to ride over timbers,  stones, and boulders; plough through mud; but sand--deep, yielding  sand--brings one to a stand-still. A reserve force of twenty or  thirty horse-power will get through most places, but in dry  weather every chauffeur dreads hearing the word sand, and  anxiously inquires concerning the character of the sandy places.    Happily, when the people say the road is \"sandy,\" they usually  mean two or three inches of light soil, or gravelly sand over a  firm foundation of some kind--that is all right; if there is a  firm bottom, it does not matter much how deep the dust on top; the  machine will go at nearly full speed over two or three inches of  soft stuff; but if on cross-examination it is found that by sand  they mean sand, and that ahead is a succession of sand ridges that  are sand from base to summit, with no path, grass, or weeds upon  which a wheel can find footing, then inquire for some way around  and take it; it might be possible to plough through, but that is  demoralizing on a hot day.    Happily, along most sandy roads and up most hills of sand there  are firm spots along one side or the other, patches of weeds or  grass which afford wheel-hold. Usually the surface of the sand is  slightly firmer and the large automobile tires ride on it fairly  well. As a rule, the softest, deepest, and most treacherous places  in sand are the tracks where wagons travel--these are like  quicksand.    The sun was hot, the sand was deep, and we had pushed and tugged  until the silence was ominous; at length the lowering clouds of  wrath broke, and the Professor said things that cannot be  repeated.    By way of apology, he said, afterwards, while shaking the sand out  of his shoes, \"It is difficult to preserve the serenity of the  class-room under conditions so very dissimilar. I understand now  why the golf-playing parson swears in a bunker. It is not right,  but it is very human. It is the recrudescence of the old Adam, the  response of humanity to emergency. Education and religion prepare  us for the common-place; nature takes care of the extraordinary.  The Quaker hits back before he thinks. It is so much easier to  repent than prevent. On the score of scarcity alone, an ounce of  prevention is worth several tons of repentance; and--\"    It was so apparent that the Professor was losing himself in  abstractions, that I quietly let the clutches slip until the  machine came to a stop, when the Professor looked anxiously down  and said,--    \"Is the blamed thing stuck again?\"    We turned off the Bowling Green road to the River road, which is  not only better, but more direct from Napoleon to Perrysburg. It  was the road we originally intended to take; it was down on our  itinerary, and in automobiling it is better to stick to first  intentions.    The road follows the bank of the river up hill and down, through  ravines and over creeks; it is hard, hilly, and picturesque; high  speed was quite out of the question.    Not far from Three Rivers we came to a horse tethered among the  trees by the road-side; of course, on hearing and seeing the  automobile and while we were yet some distance away, it broke its  tether and was off on a run up the road, which meant that unless  some one intervened it would fly on ahead for miles. Happily, in  this instance some men caught the animal after it had gone a mile  or two, we, meanwhile, creeping on slowly so as not to frighten it  more. Loose horses in the road make trouble. There is no one to  look after them, and nine times out of ten they will go running  ahead of the machine, like frightened deer, for miles. If the  machine stops, they stop; if it starts, they start; it is  impossible to get by. All one can do is to go on until they turn  into a farmyard or down a cross-road.    The road led into Toledo, but we were told that by turning east at  Perrysburg, some miles southwest of Toledo, we would have fifty  miles or more of the finest road in the world,--the famous Perry's  Pike.    All day long we lived in anticipation of the treat to come; at  each steep hill and when struggling in the sand we mentioned  Perry's Pike as the promised land. When we viewed it, we felt with  Moses that the sight was sufficient.    In its day it must have been one of the wonders of the West, it is  so wide and straight. In the centre is a broad, perfectly flat,  raised strip of half-broken limestone. The reckless sumptuousness  of such a highway in early days must have been overpowering, but  with time and weather this strip of stone has worn into an  infinite number of little ruts and hollows, with stones the size  of cocoanuts sticking up everywhere.

Back it led him to Marye's slope,    Where the shock and the fame he bore;  And to green Moss-Neck it guided him--    Brief respite from throes of war:      To the laurel glade by the Wilderness grim,      Through climaxed victory naught shall dim,      Even unto death it piloted him--        Stonewall followed his star.    Its lead he followed in gentle ways    Which never the valiant mar;  A cap we sent him, bestarred, to replace    The sun-scorched helm of war:      A fillet he made of the shining lace      Childhood's laughing brow to grace--        Not his was a goldsmith's star.    O, much of doubt in after days    Shall cling, as now, to the war;  Of the right and the wrong they'll still debate,    Puzzled by Stonewall's star:      \"Fortune went with the North elate\"      \"Ay, but the south had Stonewall's weight,        And he fell in the South's vain war.\"        Gettysburg.  The Check.  (July, 1863.)      O pride of the days in prime of the months    Now trebled in great renown,  When before the ark of our holy cause      Fell Dagon down--  Dagon foredoomed, who, armed and targed,  Never his impious heart enlarged  Beyond that hour; god walled his power,  And there the last invader charged.    He charged, and in that charge condensed    His all of hate and all of fire;  He sought to blast us in his scorn,      And wither us in his ire.  Before him went the shriek of shells--  Aerial screamings, taunts and yells;  Then the three waves in flashed advance    Surged, but were met, and back they set:  Pride was repelled by sterner pride,    And Right is a strong-hold yet.    Before our lines it seemed a beach    Which wild September gales have strown  With havoc on wreck, and dashed therewith      Pale crews unknown--  Men, arms, and steeds. The evening sun  Died on the face of each lifeless one,  And died along the winding marge of fight      And searching-parties lone.    Sloped on the hill the mounds were green,    Our center held that place of graves,  And some still hold it in their swoon,    And over these a glory waves.  The warrior-monument, crashed in fight,[8]  Shall soar transfigured in loftier light,      A meaning ampler bear;  Soldier and priest with hymn and prayer  Have laid the stone, and every bone      Shall rest in honor there.        The House-top.  A Night Piece.  (July, 1863.)      No sleep. The sultriness pervades the air  And binds the brain--a dense oppression, such  As tawny tigers feel in matted shades,  Vexing their blood and making apt for ravage.  Beneath the stars the roofy desert spreads  Vacant as Libya. All is hushed near by.  Yet fitfully from far breaks a mixed surf  Of muffled sound, the Atheist roar of riot.  Yonder, where parching Sirius set in drought,  Balefully glares red Arson--there-and there.  The Town is taken by its rats--ship-rats.  And rats of the wharves. All civil charms  And priestly spells which late held hearts in awe--  Fear-bound, subjected to a better sway  Than sway of self; these like a dream dissolve,  And man rebounds whole aeons back in nature.[9]  Hail to the low dull rumble, dull and dead,  And ponderous drag that shakes the wall.  Wise Draco comes, deep in the midnight roll  Of black artillery; he comes, though late;  In code corroborating Calvin's creed  And cynic tyrannies of honest kings;  He comes, nor parlies; and the Town redeemed,  Give thanks devout; nor, being thankful, heeds  The grimy slur on the Republic's faith implied,  Which holds that Man is naturally good,  And--more--is Nature's Roman, never to be scourged.        Look-out Mountain.  The Night Fight.  (November, 1863.)      Who inhabiteth the Mountain    That it shines in lurid light,  And is rolled about with thunders,    And terrors, and a blight,  Like Kaf the peak of Eblis--    Kaf, the evil height?  Who has gone up with a shouting    And a trumpet in the night?    There is battle in the Mountain--    Might assaulteth Might;  'Tis the fastness of the Anarch,    Torrent-torn, an ancient height;  The crags resound the clangor    Of the war of Wrong and Right;  And the armies in the valley    Watch and pray for dawning light.    Joy, Joy, the day is breaking,    And the cloud is rolled from sight;  There is triumph in the Morning    For the Anarch's plunging flight;  God has glorified the Mountain    Where a Banner burneth bright,  And the armies in the valley    They are fortified in right.        Chattanooga.  (November, 1863.)      A kindling impulse seized the host    Inspired by heaven's elastic air;[9]  Their hearts outran their General's plan,    Though Grant commanded there--    Grant, who without reserve can dare;  And, \"Well, go on and do your will\"    He said, and measured the mountain then:  So master-riders fling the rein--    But you must know your men.    On yester-morn in grayish mist,    Armies like ghosts on hills had fought,  And rolled from the cloud their thunders loud    The Cumberlands far had caught:    To-day the sunlit steeps are sought.  Grant stood on cliffs whence all was plain,    And smoked as one who feels no cares;  But mastered nervousness intense    Alone such calmness wears.    The summit-cannon plunge their flame    Sheer down the primal wall,  But up and up each linking troop    In stretching festoons crawl--    Nor fire a shot. Such men appall  The foe, though brave. He, from the brink,    Looks far along the breadth of slope,  And sees two miles of dark dots creep,    And knows they mean the cope.    He sees them creep. Yet here and there    Half hid 'mid leafless groves they go;  As men who ply through traceries high    Of turreted marbles show--    So dwindle these to eyes below.  But fronting shot and flanking shell    Sliver and rive the inwoven ways;  High tops of oaks and high hearts fall,    But never the climbing stays.    From right to left, from left to right    They roll the rallying cheer--  Vie with each other, brother with brother,    Who shall the first appear--    What color-bearer with colors clear  In sharp relief, like sky-drawn Grant,    Whose cigar must now be near the stump--  While in solicitude his back    Heap slowly to a hump.    Near and more near; till now the flags    Run like a catching flame;  And one flares highest, to peril nighest--    _He_ means to make a name:    Salvos! they give him his fame.  The staff is caught, and next the rush,    And then the leap where death has led;  Flag answered flag along the crest,    And swarms of rebels fled.    But some who gained the envied Alp,    And--eager, ardent, earnest there--  Dropped into Death's wide-open arms,    Quelled on the wing like eagles struck in air--    Forever they slumber young and fair,  The smile upon them as they died;    Their end attained, that end a height:  Life was to these a dream fulfilled,    And death a starry night.        The Armies of the Wilderness.  (1683-64.)      I    Like snows the camps on southern hills    Lay all the winter long,  Our levies there in patience stood--    They stood in patience strong.  On fronting slopes gleamed other camps    Where faith as firmly clung:  Ah, froward king! so brave miss--    The zealots of the Wrong.            _In this strife of brothers            (God, hear their country call),          However it be, whatever betide,            Let not the just one fall._    Through the pointed glass our soldiers saw    The base-ball bounding sent;  They could have joined them in their sport    But for the vale's deep rent.  And others turned the reddish soil,    Like diggers of graves they bent:  The reddish soil and tranching toil      Begat presentiment.            _Did the Fathers feel mistrust?            Can no final good be wrought?          Over and over, again and again            Must the fight for the Right be fought?_    They lead a Gray-back to the crag:    \"Your earth-works yonder--tell us, man\"  \"A prisoner--no deserter, I,    Nor one of the tell-tale clan\"  His rags they mark: \"True-blue like you    Should wear the color--your Country's, man\"  He grinds his teeth: \"However that be,    Yon earth-works have their plan.\"            _Such brave ones, foully snared            By Belial's wily plea,          Were faithful unto the evil end--            Feudal fidelity._    \"Well, then, your camps--come, tell the names\"    Freely he leveled his finger then:  \"Yonder--see--are our Georgians; on the crest,    The Carolinians; lower, past the glen,  Virginians--Alabamians--Mississippians--Kentuckians    (Follow my finger)--Tennesseeans; and the ten  Camps _there_--ask your grave-pits; they'll tell.    Halloa! I see the picket-hut, the den  Where I last night lay.\" \"Where's Lee\"    \"In the hearts and bayonets of all yon men!\"            _The tribes swarm up to war            As in ages long ago,          Ere the palm of promise leaved            And the lily of Christ did blow._    Their mounted pickets for miles are spied    Dotting the lowland plain,  The nearer ones in their veteran-rags--    Loutish they loll in lazy disdain.  But ours in perilous places bide    With rifles ready and eyes that strain  Deep through the dim suspected wood    Where the Rapidan rolls amain.            _The Indian has passed away,            But creeping comes another--          Deadlier far. Picket,            Take heed--take heed of thy brother!_    From a wood-hung height, an outpost lone,    Crowned with a woodman's fort,  The sentinel looks on a land of dole,      Like Paran, all amort.  Black chimneys, gigantic in moor-like wastes,    The scowl of the clouded sky retort;  The hearth is a houseless stone again--    Ah! where shall the people be sought?            _Since the venom such blastment"]]]
