One is sufficient here.  Go all of you, and endeavour to procure what rest you can.\"    \"I will fetch you my powder-flask and bullets,\" said Mr. Marchdale; \"and  you can, if you please, reload the pistols. In about two hours more it  will be broad daylight.\"    This arrangement was adopted. Henry did reload the pistols, and placed  them on a table by the side of the bed, ready for immediate action, and  then, as Flora was sleeping soundly, all left the room but himself.    Mrs. Bannerworth was the last to do so. She would have remained, but for  the earnest solicitation of Henry, that she would endeavour to get some  sleep to make up for her broken night's repose, and she was indeed so  broken down by her alarm on Flora's account, that she had not power to  resist, but with tears flowing from her eyes, she sought her own  chamber.    And now the calmness of the night resumed its sway in that evil-fated  mansion; and although no one really slept but Flora, all were still.  Busy thought kept every one else wakeful. It was a mockery to lie down  at all, and Henry, full of strange and painful feelings as he was,  preferred his present position to the anxiety and apprehension on  Flora's account which he knew he should feel if she were not within the  sphere of his own observation, and she slept as soundly as some gentle  infant tired of its playmates and its sports.          CHAPTER IV.    THE MORNING.--THE CONSULTATION.--THE FEARFUL SUGGESTION.      [Illustration]    What wonderfully different impressions and feelings, with regard to the  same circumstances, come across the mind in the broad, clear, and  beautiful light of day to what haunt the imagination, and often render  the judgment almost incapable of action, when the heavy shadow of night  is upon all things.    There must be a downright physical reason for this effect--it is so  remarkable and so universal. It seems that the sun's rays so completely  alter and modify the constitution of the atmosphere, that it produces,  as we inhale it, a wonderfully different effect upon the nerves of the  human subject.    We can account for this phenomenon in no other way. Perhaps never in his  life had he, Henry Bannerworth, felt so strongly this transition of  feeling as he now felt it, when the beautiful daylight gradually dawned  upon him, as he kept his lonely watch by the bedside of his slumbering  sister.    That watch had been a perfectly undisturbed one. Not the least sight or  sound of any intrusion had reached his senses. All had been as still as  the very grave.    And yet while the night lasted, and he was more indebted to the rays of  the candle, which he had placed upon a shelf, for the power to  distinguish objects than to the light of the morning, a thousand uneasy  and strange sensations had found a home in his agitated bosom.    He looked so many times at the portrait which was in the panel that at  length he felt an undefined sensation of terror creep over him whenever  he took his eyes off it.    He tried to keep himself from looking at it, but he found it vain, so he  adopted what, perhaps, was certainly the wisest, best plan, namely, to  look at it continually.    He shifted his chair so that he could gaze upon it without any effort,  and he placed the candle so that a faint light was thrown upon it, and  there he sat, a prey to many conflicting and uncomfortable feelings,  until the daylight began to make the candle flame look dull and sickly.    Solution for the events of the night he could find none. He racked his  imagination in vain to find some means, however vague, of endeavouring  to account for what occurred, and still he was at fault. All was to him  wrapped in the gloom of the most profound mystery.    And how strangely, too, the eyes of that portrait appeared to look upon  him--as if instinct with life, and as if the head to which they belonged  was busy in endeavouring to find out the secret communings of his soul.  It was wonderfully well executed that portrait; so life-like, that the  very features seemed to move as you gazed upon them.    \"It shall be removed,\" said Henry. \"I would remove it now, but that it  seems absolutely painted on the panel, and I should awake Flora in any  attempt to do so.\"    He arose and ascertained that such was the case, and that it would  require a workman, with proper tools adapted to the job, to remove the  portrait.    \"True,\" he said, \"I might now destroy it, but it is a pity to obscure a  work of such rare art as this is; I should blame myself if I were. It  shall be removed to some other room of the house, however.\"    Then, all of a sudden, it struck Henry how foolish it would be to remove  the portrait from the wall of a room which, in all likelihood, after  that night, would be uninhabited; for it was not probable that Flora  would choose again to inhabit a chamber in which she had gone through so  much terror.    \"It can be left where it is,\" he said, \"and we can fasten up, if we  please, even the very door of this room, so that no one need trouble  themselves any further about it.\"    The morning was now coming fast, and just as Henry thought he would  partially draw a blind across the window, in order to shield from the  direct rays of the sun the eyes of Flora, she awoke.    \"Help--help!\" she cried, and Henry was by her side in a moment.    \"You are safe, Flora--you are safe,\" he said.    \"Where is it now?\" she said.    \"What--what, dear Flora?\"    \"The dreadful apparition. Oh, what have I done to be made thus  perpetually miserable?\"    \"Think no more of it, Flora.\"    \"I must think. My brain is on fire! A million of strange eyes seem  gazing on me.\"    \"Great Heaven! she raves,\" said Henry.    \"Hark--hark--hark! He comes on the wings of the storm. Oh, it is most  horrible--horrible!\"    Henry rang the bell, but not sufficiently loudly to create any alarm.  The sound reached the waking ear of the mother, who in a few moments was  in the room.    \"She has awakened,\" said Henry, \"and has spoken, but she seems to me to  wander in her discourse. For God's sake, soothe her, and try to bring  her mind round to its usual state.\"    \"I will, Henry--I will.\"    \"And I think, mother, if you were to get her out of this room, and into  some other chamber as far removed from this one as possible, it would  tend to withdraw her mind from what has occurred.\"    \"Yes; it shall be done. Oh, Henry, what was it--what do you think it  was?\"    \"I am lost in a sea of wild conjecture. I can form no conclusion; where  is Mr. Marchdale?\"    \"I believe in his chamber.\"    \"Then I will go and consult with him.\"    Henry proceeded at once to the chamber, which was, as he knew, occupied  by Mr. Marchdale; and as he crossed the corridor, he could not but pause  a moment to glance from a window at the face of nature.    As is often the case, the terrific storm of the preceding evening had  cleared the air, and rendered it deliciously invigorating and life-like.  The weather had been dull, and there had been for some days a certain  heaviness in the atmosphere, which was now entirely removed.    The morning sun was shining with uncommon brilliancy, birds were singing  in every tree and on every bush; so pleasant, so spirit-stirring,  health-giving a morning, seldom had he seen. And the effect upon his  spirits was great, although not altogether what it might have been, had  all gone on as it usually was in the habit of doing at that house. The  ordinary little casualties of evil fortune had certainly from time to  time, in the shape of illness, and one thing or another, attacked the  family of the Bannerworths in common with every other family, but here  suddenly had arisen a something at once terrible and inexplicable.    He found Mr. Marchdale up and dressed, and apparently in deep and  anxious thought. The moment he saw Henry, he said,--    \"Flora is awake, I presume.\"    \"Yes, but her mind appears to be much disturbed.\"    \"From bodily weakness, I dare say.\"    \"But why should she be bodily weak? she was strong and well, ay, as well  as she could ever be in all her life. The glow of youth and health was  on her cheeks. Is it possible that, in the course of one night, she  should become bodily weak to such an extent?\"    \"Henry,\" said Mr. Marchdale, sadly, \"sit down. I am not, as you know, a  superstitious man.\"    \"You certainly are not.\"    \"And yet, I never in all my life was so absolutely staggered as I have  been by the occurrences of to-night.\"    \"Say on.\"    \"There is a frightful, a hideous solution of them; one which every  consideration will tend to add strength to, one which I tremble to name  now, although, yesterday, at this hour, I should have laughed it to  scorn.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"Yes, it is so. Tell no one that which I am about to say to you. Let the  dreadful suggestion remain with ourselves alone, Henry Bannerworth.\"    \"I--I am lost in wonder.\"    \"You promise me?\"    \"What--what?\"    \"That you will not repeat my opinion to any one.\"    \"I do.\"    \"On your honour.\"    \"On my honour, I promise.\"    Mr. Marchdale rose, and proceeding to the door, he looked out to see  that there were no listeners near. Having ascertained then that they  were quite alone, he returned, and drawing a chair close to that on  which Henry sat, he said,--    \"Henry, have you never heard of a strange and dreadful superstition  which, in some countries, is extremely rife, by which it is supposed  that there are beings who never die.\"    \"Never die!\"    \"Never. In a word, Henry, have you never heard of--of--I dread to  pronounce the word.\"    \"Speak it. God of Heaven! let me hear it.\"    \"A _vampyre_!\"    Henry sprung to his feet. His whole frame quivered with emotion; the  drops of perspiration stood upon his brow, as, in, a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14835"],[0,"The Burglar and the Blizzard: A Christmas Story (#6)"],[1,"lf, but how should  it not be? What more inevitable than that she should make an effort to  deceive a casual stranger? She had the most evident motives for behaving  exactly as she did. Just so, however, he had reasoned about McVay, and  yet McVay had been sincere. There had been a girl in distress exactly as  he had said. It was contrary to all reason, but it was true. Might not  the girl be true too? Was it not possible, he asked himself, and  answered that it was more than possible, it was the truth. He chose to  believe in her, and turned his anger against McVay, who could drag her  through such a mire. He felt the tragedy of a high-minded woman tricked  out in stolen finery, and remembered with a pang that he himself was  hurrying on the moment of disillusion.    \"I wonder,\" she said, \"if I could take some things with me. Is it  impossible for me to carry a bag?\"    \"Yes, but not for me.\"    \"It would be only this.\" She held up a small Russia leather affair  legibly marked with Mrs. Inness' initials.    \"I will take it,\" said Geoffrey. His faith was sorely tried.    She moved about collecting things and packing, and presently remarked:    \"But if Billy is all right, why didn't he come for me himself?\"    \"Oh, because--\" Geoffrey hesitated an instant, and her fears interpreted  the pause.    \"He's hurt. You are keeping it from me. You are deceiving me.\"    \"I would scorn to deceive you,\" said Geoffrey with passion, and looked  at her to find some answer to the reverse question which he did not put  into words.    She did not appear to understand. \"Then why didn't he come?\" she asked.    \"He had been out in the storm already. I thought it was my turn.\"    \"I think you must be stronger than Billy.\" She cast a reflective glance  at his shoulders, and he was ashamed to find himself inordinately  flattered.    \"He is really safe at your house?\"    \"I hope so, I did my best,\" he returned grimly.    She looked at him gravely. \"You have been very kind to a stranger,\" she  said.    And at this point Geoffrey made the fatal mistake of his dealing with  her. It did not occur to him that he was going to shield McVay, but he  thought a more advantageous time could be found for telling her the  truth, in case of course she did not know it already. He felt that he  himself would be better able to deal a cold blow when she was warm and  sheltered. No man, he said to himself, could be disagreeable to a girl  who had no one to depend on but himself. So he said:    \"He was not exactly a stranger to me. We were at school together.\"    \"Oh, another of Billy's friends. I never knew such a person for  discovering friends at the most opportune times. He never wants anything  but what a friend turns up. Did you find him wandering about, or did he  come and demand admittance?\"    \"Why, neither exactly. I was not in the house at the time. He felt he  knew me well enough to walk in.\"    \"He never told me he had a friend in the neighbourhood.\"    \"We have not met since we were at school.\"    \"He had not seen you since he was at school, and yet he felt he knew you  well enough to walk in on you!\"    \"Yes, he just walked in, and then I would not let him go.\"    \"Men are so queer!\" she exclaimed with a little laugh that had a spice  of admiration in it, under which Geoffrey writhed. He was sailing under  such false colours as her brother's benefactor.    \"We ought to be starting,\" he said.    She looked round the room. \"I hate to leave all these nice things,\" she  said. \"Billy is so fond of them. There is some wine that some one gave  him that he says is really priceless.\"    \"Leave it,\" said Geoffrey shortly.    \"One would think you were a teetotaller from that tone. I wonder if I  could not take one bottle as a surprise to Billy. He would like to  contribute something to your hospitality, I am sure. Besides, if I leave  it, it may be stolen.\"    \"Yes, it may be stolen.\" He looked down into her face.    \"Then--\"    \"I ask you as a favour to leave it behind.\"    Nothing could have been more charming than her manner of yielding, sweet  and quick like a caress. It made him feel how pitiful sordid it all was.    They started immediately, started with a certain gaiety. Geoffrey chose  to remember only that they were together through a hard adventure, and  that it was his part to smooth her way. The bond of difficulties to  overcome united them. They felt the intimacy of a single absorbing  interest. They had nothing to think of but accomplishing their task,--of  that and of each other. As far as they could see were snow and black  trunks of trees. They scarcely remembered that any one but themselves  existed.    Now justly he could admire something besides her beauty. Her courage  warmed his heart. Yet with all her spirit she made no attempt to assert  her independence. She turned to him at every point. He guided her past  the scenes of his own disasters and saved her from the mistakes he had  already made.    But only for a little while did they move forward in this delightful  exhilaration. Before they had gone far she grew silent, and when she did  answer him spoke less spontaneously. She asked for neither help nor  encouragement, but plunged along as steadily as she was able. Her  skirts, however, wet and heavy, hampered her desperately, and the  exertion of walking through the thick snow began to tell. Geoffrey made  her stop every now and then for a breathing spell, but at length she  stopped of herself.    \"Have we done half yet?\" she asked.    \"Just about,\" he answered, stretching truth in order to encourage her.  But he saw at once that he had failed,--that she had had a hope that  they were nearer their destination--that she began to doubt her own  powers. Presently she moved forward again in silence.    He began to be alarmed lest they should never reach his house, yet took  comfort in the thought, as he looked at her, that whatever strength she  had, she would use to the end. No hysterical despair would exhaust her  beforehand. She would not fail through lack of determination. Whether or  not she were the confederate of a thief she was a brave woman, yes, and  a beautiful one, he thought, looking down upon her in the glare of the  snow.    Presently he held out his hand in silence, and she as silently took it.  This was to Geoffrey the explanation of his whole life. This was what  men were made for.    Once as they stood resting the wind, which fortunately had been at their  backs the entire trip, hurled her against him, where she remained an  instant, too weak to move. It was he who set her gently on her feet  again.    The latter part of the journey she made almost wholly by his help, and  when they stood before the piazza, she could not have managed the little  step had he not virtually lifted her up. He took her directly to the  library and laid her on the sofa. The fire, owing to the absence of  McVay, had gone out. It took Geoffrey some time with his benumbed hands  to build a blaze. When he turned toward her again she was sleeping like  a child.    The sight was too much for his own weariness, and reflecting that McVay  was either gone or still safe, he stretched himself on the hearth-rug  and was soon asleep also.          IV      It was after two o'clock in the afternoon when he awoke. He must have  slept three hours. He looked at the sofa and saw the girl still sleeping  peacefully. He almost wished that she would never awake to all the  dreadful surprises that the house held for her. Her eye-lashes curved  long and dark on her cheek. Geoffrey turned away quickly.    He had awakened with a sudden disagreeable conviction that people have  been known to smother to death in closets. He stole quietly from the  library and ran up stairs with not a little anxiety. Indeed so great was  his dread that he would have been really relieved to see the closet door  standing open as an immediate proof that it did not hide a corpse. It  was, however, locked as he had left it. But as he hastened to undo it, a  voice from within reassured him:    [Illustration: HE LET MCVAY OUT OF THE CLOSET]    \"Well, where have you been all this time?\"    \"You may be thankful I'm back at all. It did not look like it, at one  time.\"    \"Where is Cecilia?\"    \"Down stairs asleep.\"    McVay gave a little giggle. \"Ah,\" he said, \"I bet you have had the devil  of a time. I bet you wished once or twice that you had let me be the one  to go.\"    \"It wasn't child's play.\"    \"Child's play! I rather think not. These things are all well enough  among men, but women!\" he waved his hand; \"so sensitive, so cloistered!\"    \"Your sister behaved nobly,\" said Geoffrey severely.    \"Bound to, Holland, bound to. Still it must have been a shock.\"    \"It was a hard trip for any woman.\"    McVay looked up. \"Oh,\" he said, \"I wasn't speaking of the trip. I meant  about me. What did she say?\"    \"She did not say anything. She went to sleep.\"    \"She did not say anything when you told her I was booked for the  penitentiary?\"    \"Oh,\" said Geoffrey, and there was a slight pause. Then he added: \"Why  should I tell her what she must know.\"    \"I tell you she knows nothing about my--profession.\"    \"Your _profession_!\"    \"Hasn't a notion of it.\"    \"What, with my sister's coat on her back, and the Innes' bag in her  hand\"?\"    \"No!\" McVay drew a step nearer. \"You see I told her that I had found a  second-hand store where I could get things for nothing.\" He chuckled,  and Geoffrey withdrew with a look of repulsion that evidently  disappointed the other.    \"That was a good idea, wasn't it?\" he asked with a faint appeal in his  voice. \"She thought it was likely, anyhow.\"    \"She must be very gullable,\" said Geoffrey brutally.    \"Or else,\" said McVay with a conscious smile, \"I must be a pretty good  dissembler.\"    At this acute instance of fatuity Geoffrey, if he had followed his  impulse, would have flung McVay back in the closet and locked the door.  Instead, he said:    \"Come"]]]
