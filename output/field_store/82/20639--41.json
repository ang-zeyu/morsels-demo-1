Here he became a rider of the sage, had stock of his own,  and for a time prospered, until chance threw him in the employ of Jane  Withersteen.    \"Lassiter, I needn't tell you the rest.\"    \"Well, it'd be no news to me. I know Mormons. I've seen their women's  strange love en' patience en' sacrifice an' silence en' whet I call  madness for their idea of God. An' over against that I've seen the  tricks of men. They work hand in hand, all together, an' in the dark.  No man can hold out against them, unless he takes to packin' guns. For  Mormons are slow to kill. That's the only good I ever seen in their  religion. Venters, take this from me, these Mormons ain't just right in  their minds. Else could a Mormon marry one woman when he already has a  wife, an' call it duty?\"    \"Lassiter, you think as I think,\" returned Venters.    \"How'd it come then that you never throwed a gun on Tull or some of  them?\" inquired the rider, curiously.    \"Jane pleaded with me, begged me to be patient, to overlook. She even  took my guns from me. I lost all before I knew it,\" replied Venters,  with the red color in his face. \"But, Lassiter, listen. Out of the  wreck I saved a Winchester, two Colts, and plenty of shells. I packed  these down into Deception Pass. There, almost every day for six months,  I have practiced with my rifle till the barrel burnt my hands. Practised  the draw--the firing of a Colt, hour after hour!\"    \"Now that's interestin' to me,\" said Lassiter, with a quick uplift of  his head and a concentration of his gray gaze on Venters. \"Could you  throw a gun before you began that practisin'?\"    \"Yes. And now...\" Venters made a lightning-swift movement.    Lassiter smiled, and then his bronzed eyelids narrowed till his eyes  seemed mere gray slits. \"You'll kill Tull!\" He did not question; he  affirmed.    \"I promised Jane Withersteen I'd try to avoid Tull. I'll keep my word.  But sooner or later Tull and I will meet. As I feel now, if he even  looks at me I'll draw!\"    \"I reckon so. There'll be hell down there, presently.\" He paused a  moment and flicked a sage-brush with his quirt. \"Venters, seein' as  you're considerable worked up, tell me Milly Erne's story.\"    Venters's agitation stilled to the trace of suppressed eagerness in  Lassiter's query.    \"Milly Erne's story? Well, Lassiter, I'll tell you what I know. Milly  Erne had been in Cottonwoods years when I first arrived there, and most  of what I tell you happened before my arrival. I got to know her pretty  well. She was a slip of a woman, and crazy on religion. I conceived an  idea that I never mentioned--I thought she was at heart more Gentile  than Mormon. But she passed as a Mormon, and certainly she had the  Mormon woman's locked lips. You know, in every Mormon village there are  women who seem mysterious to us, but about Milly there was more than  the ordinary mystery. When she came to Cottonwoods she had a beautiful  little girl whom she loved passionately. Milly was not known openly in  Cottonwoods as a Mormon wife. That she really was a Mormon wife I have  no doubt. Perhaps the Mormon's other wife or wives would not acknowledge  Milly. Such things happen in these villages. Mormon wives wear  yokes, but they get jealous. Well, whatever had brought Milly to this  country--love or madness of religion--she repented of it. She gave up  teaching the village school. She quit the church. And she began to  fight Mormon upbringing for her baby girl. Then the Mormons put on the  screws--slowly, as is their way. At last the child disappeared. 'Lost'  was the report. The child was stolen, I know that. So do you. That  wrecked Milly Erne. But she lived on in hope. She became a slave. She  worked her heart and soul and life out to get back her child. She never  heard of it again. Then she sank.... I can see her now, a frail thing, so  transparent you could almost look through her--white like ashes--and her  eyes!... Her eyes have always haunted me. She had one real friend--Jane  Withersteen. But Jane couldn't mend a broken heart, and Milly died.\"    For moments Lassiter did not speak, or turn his head.    \"The man!\" he exclaimed, presently, in husky accents.    \"I haven't the slightest idea who the Mormon was,\" replied Venters; \"nor  has any Gentile in Cottonwoods.\"    \"Does Jane Withersteen know?\"    \"Yes. But a red-hot running-iron couldn't burn that name out of her!\"    Without further speech Lassiter started off, walking his horse and  Venters followed with his dogs. Half a mile down the slope they entered  a luxuriant growth of willows, and soon came into an open space carpeted  with grass like deep green velvet. The rushing of water and singing of  birds filled their ears. Venters led his comrade to a shady bower and  showed him Amber Spring. It was a magnificent outburst of clear, amber  water pouring from a dark, stone-lined hole. Lassiter knelt and drank,  lingered there to drink again. He made no comment, but Venters did not  need words. Next to his horse a rider of the sage loved a spring. And  this spring was the most beautiful and remarkable known to the upland  riders of southern Utah. It was the spring that made old Withersteen a  feudal lord and now enabled his daughter to return the toll which her  father had exacted from the toilers of the sage.    The spring gushed forth in a swirling torrent, and leaped down joyously  to make its swift way along a willow-skirted channel. Moss and ferns and  lilies overhung its green banks. Except for the rough-hewn stones that  held and directed the water, this willow thicket and glade had been left  as nature had made it.    Below were artificial lakes, three in number, one above the other  in banks of raised earth, and round about them rose the lofty  green-foliaged shafts of poplar trees. Ducks dotted the glassy surface  of the lakes; a blue heron stood motionless on a water-gate; kingfishers  darted with shrieking flight along the shady banks; a white hawk  sailed above; and from the trees and shrubs came the song of robins  and cat-birds. It was all in strange contrast to the endless slopes of  lonely sage and the wild rock environs beyond. Venters thought of the  woman who loved the birds and the green of the leaves and the murmur of  the water.    Next on the slope, just below the third and largest lake, were corrals  and a wide stone barn and open sheds and coops and pens. Here were  clouds of dust, and cracking sounds of hoofs, and romping colts and  heehawing burros. Neighing horses trampled to the corral fences. And  on the little windows of the barn projected bobbing heads of bays and  blacks and sorrels. When the two men entered the immense barnyard, from  all around the din increased. This welcome, however, was not seconded by  the several men and boys who vanished on sight.    Venters and Lassiter were turning toward the house when Jane appeared in  the lane leading a horse. In riding-skirt and blouse she seemed to have  lost some of her statuesque proportions, and looked more like a girl  rider than the mistress of Withersteen. She was brightly smiling, and  her greeting was warmly cordial.    \"Good news,\" she announced. \"I've been to the village. All is quiet.  I expected--I don't know what. But there's no excitement. And Tull has  ridden out on his way to Glaze.\"    \"Tull gone?\" inquired Venters, with surprise. He was wondering what  could have taken Tull away. Was it to avoid another meeting with  Lassiter that he went? Could it have any connection with the probable  nearness of Oldring and his gang?    \"Gone, yes, thank goodness,\" replied Jane. \"Now I'll have peace for a  while. Lassiter, I want you to see my horses. You are a rider, and  you must be a judge of horseflesh. Some of mine have Arabian blood.  My father got his best strain in Nevada from Indians who claimed their  horses were bred down from the original stock left by the Spaniards.\"    \"Well, ma'am, the one you've been ridin' takes my eye,\" said Lassiter,  as he walked round the racy, clean-limbed, and fine-pointed roan.    \"Where are the boys?\" she asked, looking about. \"Jerd, Paul, where are  you? Here, bring out the horses.\"    The sound of dropping bars inside the barn was the signal for the horses  to jerk their heads in the windows, to snort and stamp. Then they came  pounding out of the door, a file of thoroughbreds, to plunge about  the barnyard, heads and tails up, manes flying. They halted afar off,  squared away to look, came slowly forward with whinnies for their  mistress, and doubtful snorts for the strangers and their horses.    \"Come--come--come,\" called Jane, holding out her hands. \"Why,  Bells--Wrangle, where are your manners? Come, Black Star--come, Night.  Ah, you beauties! My racers of the sage!\"    Only two came up to her; those she called Night and Black Star. Venters  never looked at them without delight. The first was soft dead black, the  other glittering black, and they were perfectly matched in size, both  being high and long-bodied, wide through the shoulders, with lithe,  powerful legs. That they were a woman's pets showed in the gloss of  skin, the fineness of mane. It showed, too, in the light of big eyes and  the gentle reach of eagerness.    \"I never seen their like,\" was Lassiter's encomium, \"an' in my day I've  seen a sight of horses. Now, ma'am, if you was wantin' to make a long  an' fast ride across the sage--say to elope--\"    Lassiter ended there with dry humor, yet behind that was meaning. Jane  blushed and made arch eyes at him.    \"Take care, Lassiter, I might think that a proposal,\" she replied,  gaily. \"It's dangerous to propose elopement to a Mormon woman. Well,  I was expecting you. Now will be a good hour to show you Milly Erne's  grave. The day-riders have gone, and the night-riders haven't come in.  Bern, what do you make of that? Need I worry? You know I have to be made  to worry.\"    \"Well, it's not usual for the night shift to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13003"],[0,"Pioneers in Canada (#6)"],[1,"this great  water; but, they added, it was fresh water, not salt, and this last  piece of information much disheartened Cartier, who feared that he had  not, after all, discovered the water route across North America to the  Pacific Ocean. He therefore turned about and once more searched the  opposite coast of Labrador most minutely, displaying, as he did so, a  seamanship which was little else than marvellous, for it is a very  dangerous coast, the seas are very stormy, and the look-out often  hampered by a sudden rising of dense fog; there are islands and rocks  (some of them almost hidden by the water) and sandbanks; but Cartier  made this survey of southern Labrador without an accident.    [Footnote 4: Anticosti Island received from Cartier the name of \"the  Island of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin\", in consequence of his  having discovered it to be an island on the feast day of that name. It  did not receive its present title until the late seventeenth century.]    At this period, some three hundred and seventy-five years ago, the  northern coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and of Anticosti Island  swarmed with huge walruses, which were described by Cartier as sea  horses that spent the night on land and the day in the water. They  have long since been exterminated by the English and French seamen and  settlers.    At last Cartier set sail for the south-west, intending to explore this  wonderful river and to reach the kingdom of Canada. According to his  understanding of the Amerindian interpreters, the waters of the St.  Lawrence flowed through three great states: _Saguenay_, which was the  mountainous Gaspe Peninsula and the opposite coast; _Canada_, Quebec  and its neighbourhood; and _Hochelaga_, the region between Montreal  and Lake Ontario. At the mouth of the Saguenay River, where Tadoussac  is now situated, he encountered large numbers of white whales--the  Beluga. These are really huge porpoises, allied to the narwhals, but  without the narwhal's exaggerated tusk. When he reached the vicinity  of the modern Quebec,[5] and his Amerindian interpreters found  themselves at their actual home (for they were far away from home on a  fishing expedition when he caught them in Gaspe Bay) there was great  rejoicing; for they were able to tell their relations of the wonderful  country to which they had been across the ocean. Cartier was delighted  with the surroundings of \"Canada\" (Quebec), near which at that time  was a large settlement (Stadacona) of Huron Indians under a chief  named Donnacona. He decided to lay up his ships here for the winter,  and to pursue the rest of his western explorations in his boats.    [Footnote 5: Then called \"Canada\". The word Quebec (pronounced  _Kebek_) means the narrow part of a river.]    But the Amerindians for some reason were not willing that he should go  any farther, and attempted to scare him from his projects by arranging  for three of their number to come down river in a canoe, dressed in  dogs' skins, with their faces blackened, and with bisons' horns  fastened to their heads. These devils pretended to take no notice of  the French, but to die suddenly as they reached the shore, while the  rest of the natives gave vent to howlings of despair and  consternation. The three devils were pretending to have brought a  message from a god to these Hurons of \"Canada\" that the country up  river (Hochelaga) was so full of ice and snow that it would be death  for anyone to go there.    However, this made little or no impression on Cartier; but he consented  to leave a proportion of his party behind with the chief Donnacona as  hostages, and then started up country in his boats with about seventy  picked officers and men. On the 2nd of October, 1535, they reached the  vicinity of the modern Montreal, the chief settlement of Hochelaga.  The Huron town at the foot of the hills was circular in outline,  surrounded by a stockade of three rows of upright tree trunks, which  rose to its highest point in the middle, where the timbers of the  inner and outward sides sloped to meet one another, the height of the  central row being about 8 feet above the ground. All round the inside  there was a platform or rampart on which were stored heavy stones to  be hurled at any enemy who should attempt to scale the fence. The town  was entered by only one doorway, and contained about fifty houses  surrounding an open space whereon the towns-people made their  bonfires. Each house was about 50 feet long by 12 to 15 feet wide.  They were roofed with bark, and usually had attics which were  storerooms for food. In the centre of each of these long houses there  was a fireplace where the cooking for the whole of the house  inhabitants was done. Each family had its own room, but each house  probably contained five families. Almost the only furniture, except  cooking pots, was mats on which the people sat and slept. The food of  the people consisted, besides fish and the flesh of beavers and deer,  of maize and beans. Cartier at once recognized the maize or Indian  corn as the same grain (\"a large millet\") as that which he had seen in  Brazil.    He gives a description of how they made the maize into bread (or  rather \"dampers\", \"ashcakes\"); but as this is not altogether clear, it  is better to combine it with Champlain's description, written a good  many years later, but still at a time when the Hurons were unaffected  by the white man's civilization. According to both Cartier and  Champlain, the women pounded the corn to meal in a wooden mortar, and  removed the bran by means of fans made of the bark of trees. From this  meal they made bread, sometimes mixing with the meal the beans  (_Phaseolus vulgaris_), which had been boiled and mashed. Or they  would boil both Indian corn and beans into a thick soup, adding to the  soup blueberries,[6] dried raspberries, or pieces of deer's fat. The  meal derived from the corn and beans they would make into bread,  baking it in the ashes.    [Footnote 6: The Canada Blueberry (_Vaccinium canadense_), called by  the French _blues_ or _bluets_. These blues were collected and dried  by the Amerindians, and made a sweet nutriment for eating in the  winter.]    Or they would take the pounded Indian corn without removing the bran,  and put two or three handfuls of it into an earthen pot full of water,  stirring it from time to time, when it boiled, so that it might not  adhere to the pot. To this was added a small quantity of fish, fresh  or dry, according to the season, to give a flavour to the _migane_ or  porridge. When the dried fish was used the porridge smelt very badly  in the nostrils of Europeans, but worst of all when the porridge was  mixed with dried venison, which was sometimes nearly putrid! If fish  was put into this porridge it was boiled whole in the mealy water,  then taken out without any attempt to remove the fins, scales, or  entrails, and the whole of the boiled fish was pounded up and put back  into the porridge. Sometimes a great birch-bark \"kettle\" would be  filled with water, fish, and meat, and red-hot stones be dropped in  till it boiled. Then with a spoon they would collect from the surface  the fat and oil arising from the fish or meat. This they afterwards  mixed with the meal of roasted Indian corn, stirring it with this fat  till they had made a thick soup. Sometimes, however, they were content  to eat the young corn-cobs freshly roasted, which as a matter of fact  (with a little salt) is one of the most delicious things in the world.  Or they would take ears of Indian corn and bury them in wet mud,  leaving them thus for two or three months; then the cobs would be  removed and the rotted grain eaten with meat and fish, though it was  all muddy and smelt horribly. Cartier also noticed that these Huron  Indians had melons and pumpkins, and described their wampum or shell  money.[7]    [Footnote 7: Cartier, in Hakluyt's translation, is made to say (I  modernize the spelling): \"They dig their grounds with certain pieces  of wood as big as half a sword, on which ground groweth their corn,  which they call 'offici'; it is as big as our small peason.... They  have also great store of musk melons, pompions, gourds, cucumbers,  peas, and beans of every colour, yet differing from ours.\"    Wampum, or shell money (which recalls the shell money of the Pacific  Islands), consisted either of beads made from the interior parts of  sea shells or land shells, or of strings of perforated sea shells. The  most elaborate kind of wampum was that of the Amerindians of Canada  and the eastern United States, the shell beads of which were generally  white. The commoner wampum beads were black and violet. Wampum belts  were made which illustrated events, dates, treaties of peace, &c, by a  rude symbolism (figures of men and animals, upright lines, &c), and  these were worked neatly on string by employing different-coloured  beads.]    From the eminence on which the Huron city stood, Cartier obtained a  splendid view of rivers and mountains and magnificent forests, and  called the place then and there, in his Norman French, Mont Real, or  Royal Eminence, a name which it will probably bear for all time,  though the actual city of Montreal lies a few miles below.    Montreal was the limit of Cartier's explorations on this journey. He  returned thence to \"Canada\" or Stadacona, where his men built a fort  armed with artillery, and where his ships were anchored. Here he had  to stay from the middle of November, 1535, to the middle of April,  1536, his ships being shut in by the ice. The experiences of the  French during these five months were mostly unhappy. At first Cartier  gave himself up to the collecting of information. He noticed for the  first time the smoking of tobacco,[8] and collected information about  the products and features of \"Canada\". The Indians told him of great  lakes in the far west, one of which was so vast that no man had seen"]]]
