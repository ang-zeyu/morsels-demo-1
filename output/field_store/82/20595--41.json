No one thing over which we have control exerts so marked an influence  upon our physical prosperity as the food we eat; and it is no  exaggeration to say that well-selected and scientifically prepared food  renders the partaker whose digestion permits of its being well  assimilated, superior to his fellow-mortals in those qualities which  will enable him to cope most successfully with life's difficulties, and  to fulfill the purpose of existence in the best and truest manner. The  brain and other organs of the body are affected by the quality of the  blood which nourishes them, and since the blood is made of the food  eaten, it follows that the use of poor food will result in poor blood,  poor muscles, poor brains, and poor bodies, incapable of first-class  work in any capacity. Very few persons, however, ever stop to inquire  what particular foods are best adapted to the manufacture of good blood  and the maintenance of perfect health; but whatever gratifies the palate  or is most conveniently obtained, is cooked and eaten without regard to  its dietetic value. Far too many meals partake of the characteristics of  the one described in the story told of a clergyman who, when requested  to ask a blessing upon a dinner consisting of bread, hot and tinged with  saleratus, meat fried to a crisp, potatoes swimming in grease, mince  pie, preserves, and pickles, demurred on the ground that the dinner was  \"not worth a blessing.\" He might with equal propriety have added, \"and  not worth eating.\"    The subject of diet and its relation to human welfare, is one deserving  of the most careful consideration. It should be studied as a science, to  enable us to choose such materials as are best adapted to our needs  under the varying circumstances of climate growth, occupation, and the  numerous changing conditions of the human system; as an art, that we may  become so skilled in the preparation of the articles selected as to make  them both appetizing and healthful. It is an unfortunate fact that even  among experienced housekeepers the scientific principles which govern  the proper preparation of food, are but little understood, and much  unwholesome cookery is the result. The mechanical mixing of ingredients  is not sufficient to secure good results; and many of the failures  attributed to \"poor material,\" \"bad luck,\" and various other subterfuges  to which cooks ignorance of scientific principles. The common method of  blindly following recipes, with no knowledge of \"the reason why,\" can  hardly fail to be often productive of unsatisfactory results, which to  the uninformed seem quite inexplicable.    Cookery, when based upon scientific principles, ceases to be the  difficult problem it so often appears. Cause and effect follow each  other as certainly in the preparation of food as in other things; and  with a knowledge of the underlying principles, and faithfulness in  carrying out the necessary details, failure becomes almost an  impossibility. There is no department of human activity where applied  science offers greater advantages than in that of cookery, and in our  presentation of the subjects treated in the following pages, we have  endeavored, so far as consistent with the scope of this work, to give  special prominence to the scientific principles involved in the  successful production of wholesome articles of food. We trust our  readers will find these principles so plainly elucidated and the subject  so interesting, that they will be stimulated to undertake for  themselves further study and research in this most important branch of  household science. We have aimed also to give special precedence of  space to those most important foods, the legumes, and grains and their  products, which in the majority of cook books are given but little  consideration or are even left out altogether, believing that our  readers will be more interested in learning the many palatable ways in  which these especially nutritious and inexpensive foods may be prepared,  than in a reiteration of such dishes as usually make up the bulk of the  average cook book.    For reasons stated elsewhere (in the chapter on Milk, Cream, and  Butter), we have in the preparation of all recipes made use of cream in  place of other fats; but lest there be some who may suppose because  cream occupies so frequent a place in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242"],[0,"Poems (#6)"],[1,"    LOST.    I lost a world the other day.  Has anybody found?  You'll know it by the row of stars  Around its forehead bound.    A rich man might not notice it;  Yet to my frugal eye  Of more esteem than ducats.  Oh, find it, sir, for me!            XXXVII.    If I shouldn't be alive  When the robins come,  Give the one in red cravat  A memorial crumb.    If I couldn't thank you,  Being just asleep,  You will know I'm trying  With my granite lip!            XXXVIII.    Sleep is supposed to be,  By souls of sanity,  The shutting of the eye.    Sleep is the station grand  Down which on either hand  The hosts of witness stand!    Morn is supposed to be,  By people of degree,  The breaking of the day.    Morning has not occurred!  That shall aurora be  East of eternity;    One with the banner gay,  One in the red array, --  That is the break of day.            XXXIX.    I shall know why, when time is over,  And I have ceased to wonder why;  Christ will explain each separate anguish  In the fair schoolroom of the sky.    He will tell me what Peter promised,  And I, for wonder at his woe,  I shall forget the drop of anguish  That scalds me now, that scalds me now.            XL.    I never lost as much but twice,  And that was in the sod;  Twice have I stood a beggar  Before the door of God!    Angels, twice descending,  Reimbursed my store.  Burglar, banker, father,  I am poor once more!              POEMS    by EMILY DICKINSON    Second Series          Edited by two of her friends    MABEL LOOMIS TODD and T.W. HIGGINSON          PREFACE    The eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's  poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern  artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the  qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest  themes,--life and love and death. That \"irresistible needle-touch,\"  as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very  core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as  it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling  power.  This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to  form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties.    Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending  occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of  her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend \"H.H.\"  must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th  September, 1884, she wrote:--      MY DEAR FRIEND,-- What portfolios full of verses  you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your \"day and  generation\" that you will not give them light.    If such a thing should happen as that I should outlive  you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee  and executor. Surely after you are what is called  \"dead\" you will be willing that the poor ghosts you  have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your  verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think  we have a right to withhold from the world a word or  a thought any more than a deed which might help a  single soul. . . .                    Truly yours,                            HELEN JACKSON.      The \"portfolios\" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death,  by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had  been carefully copied on sheets of note-paper, and tied in little  fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear  evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had  received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of  rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and  phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one  form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without  important exception, her friends have generously placed at the  disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and  these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several  renderings of the same verse.    To what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been  subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They  should be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and  suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some  time in the finished picture.    Emily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the  winter of 1862. In a letter to oone of the present Editors the  April following, she says, \"I made no verse, but one or two, until  this winter.\"    The handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running  Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in  breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her  latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its  fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones,  everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous  dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of  a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and  strong.  The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of  the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date,  the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general  chronologic accuracy.    As a rule, the verses were without titles; but \"A Country Burial,\"  \"A Thunder-Storm,\" \"The Humming-Bird,\" and a few others were named  by their author, frequently at the end,--sometimes only in the  accompanying note, if sent to a friend.    The variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in  pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of  responsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not  absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her  rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it  seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and  more usual rhymes.    Like impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very  absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily  Dickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a  particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything  virtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of  inner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and  the \"thought-rhyme\" appears frequently,--appealing, indeed, to an  unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing.    Emily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness.  Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the  sombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond. She  touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost  humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is  never by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic  has said, she may exhibit toward God \"an Emersonian self-possession,\"  it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced  as it is rare.    She had tried society and the world, and found them lacking.  She  was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no  love-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming of a nature  introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist  in pretence.    Storm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and  bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted  human friends, were sufficient companionship. The coming of the  first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of  pope; the first red leaf hurrying through \"the altered air,\" an  epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or  melancholy, she lived in its presence.                                    MABEL LOOMIS TODD.            AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS,              August, I891.                            My nosegays are for captives;         Dim, long-expectant eyes,      Fingers denied the plucking,         Patient till paradise,        To such, if they should whisper         Of morning and the moor,      They bear no other errand,         And I, no other prayer.          I. LIFE.      I.    I'm nobody!  Who are you?  Are you nobody, too?  Then there 's a pair of us -- don't tell!  They 'd banish us, you know.    How dreary to be somebody!  How public, like a frog  To tell your name the livelong day  To an admiring bog!            II.    I bring an unaccustomed wine  To lips long parching, next to mine,  And summon them to drink.    Crackling with fever, they essay;  I turn my brimming eyes away,  And come next hour to look.    The hands still hug the tardy glass;  The lips I would have cooled, alas!  Are so superfluous cold,    I would as soon attempt to warm  The bosoms where the frost has lain  Ages beneath the mould.    Some other thirsty there may be  To whom this would have pointed me  Had it remained to speak.    And so I always bear the cup  If, haply, mine may be the drop  Some pilgrim thirst to slake, --    If, haply, any say to me,  \"Unto the little, unto me,\"  When I at last awake.            III.    The nearest dream recedes, unrealized.        The heaven we chase        Like the June bee        Before the school-boy        Invites the race;        Stoops to an easy clover --  Dips -- evades -- teases -- deploys;        Then to the royal clouds        Lifts his light pinnace        Heedless of the boy  Staring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.          Homesick for steadfast honey,        Ah! the bee flies not  That brews that rare variety.            IV.    We play at paste,  Till qualified for pearl,  Then drop the paste,  And deem ourself a fool.  The shapes, though, were similar,  And our new hands  Learned gem-tactics  Practising sands.            V.    I found the phrase to every thought  I ever had, but one;  And that defies me, -- as a hand  Did try to chalk the sun    To races nurtured in the dark; --  How would your own begin?  Can blaze be done in cochineal,  Or noon in mazarin?       "]]]
