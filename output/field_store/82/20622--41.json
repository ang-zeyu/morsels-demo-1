On the Atlantic coast the prosperous English colonies  occupied a narrow range of country bounded by the Atlantic Ocean and the  Alleghanies. It was only in the middle of the eighteenth century--nearly  three-quarters of a century after Joliet's and La Salle's explorations,  and even later than the date at which Frenchmen had followed the  Saskatchewan to the Rocky Mountains--that some enterprising Virginians  and Pennsylvanians worked their way into the beautiful country watered  by the affluents of the Ohio. New France may be said to have extended at  that time from Cape Breton or Isle Royale west to the Rocky Mountains,  and from the basin of the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.      SECTION 4.--End of French dominion in the valley of the St. Lawrence.    After the treaty of Utrecht, France recognized the mistake she had made  in giving up Acadia, and devoted her attention to the island of Cape  Breton, or Isle Royale, on whose southeastern coast soon rose the  fortifications of Louisbourg. In the course of years this fortress  became a menace to English interests in Acadia and New England. In 1745  the town was taken by a force of New England volunteers, led by General  Pepperrell, a discreet and able colonist, and a small English squadron  under the command of Commodore, afterwards Admiral, Warren, both of whom  were rewarded by the British government for their distinguished services  on this memorable occasion. France, however, appreciated the importance  of Isle Royale, and obtained its restoration in exchange for Madras  which at that time was the most important British settlement in the East  Indies. England then decided to strengthen herself in Acadia, where  France retained her hold of the French Acadian population through the  secret influence of her emissaries, chiefly missionaries, and  accordingly established a town on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia,  ever since known as Halifax, in honour of a prominent statesman of those  times. The French settlers, who by the middle of the eighteenth century  numbered 12,000, a thrifty, industrious and simple-minded people, easily  influenced by French agents, called themselves \"Neutrals,\" and could not  be forced to take the unqualified oath of allegiance which was demanded  of them by the authorities of Halifax. The English Government was now  determined to act with firmness in a province where British interests  had been so long neglected, and where the French inhabitants had in the  course of forty years shown no disposition to consider themselves  British subjects and discharge their obligations to the British Crown.  France had raised the contention that the Acadia ceded to England by the  treaty of Utrecht comprised only the present province of Nova Scotia,  and indeed only a portion of that peninsula according to some French  authorities. Commissioners were appointed by the two Powers to settle  the question of boundaries--of the meaning of \"Acadie, with its ancient  boundaries\"--but their negotiations came to naught and the issue was  only settled by the arbitrament of war. The French built the forts of  Beausejour and Gaspereau--the latter a mere palisade--on the Isthmus of  Chignecto, which became the rendezvous of the French Acadians, whom the  former persuaded by promises or threats to join their fortunes. In 1755  a force of English and Colonial troops, under the command of Colonels  Moncton, Winslow and Scott, captured these forts, and this success was  followed by the banishment of the Acadian French. This cruel act of  Governor Lawrence and the English authorities at Halifax was no doubt  largely influenced by the sentiment of leading men in New England, who  were apprehensive of the neighbourhood of so large a number of an alien  people, who could not be induced to prove their loyalty to Great  Britain, and might, in case of continued French successes in America,  become open and dangerous foes. But while there are writers who defend  this sad incident of American history on the ground of stern national  necessity at a critical period in the affairs of the continent, all  humanity that listens to the dictates of the heart and tender feeling  will ever deplore the exile of those hapless people.    Previous to the expulsion of the Acadians from their pleasant homes on  the meadows of Grand Pre and Minas, England sustained a severe defeat in  the valley of the Ohio, which created much alarm throughout the English  colonies, and probably had some influence on the fortunes of those  people. France had formally taken possession of the Ohio country and  established forts in 1753 on French Creek, at its junction with the  Alleghany, and also at the forks of the Ohio. Adventurous British  pioneers were at last commencing to cross the Alleghanies, and a company  had been formed with the express intention of stimulating settlement in  the valley. George Washington, at the head of a small Colonial force,  was defeated in his attempt to drive the French from the Ohio; and the  English Government was compelled to send out a large body of regular  troops under the command of General Braddock, who met defeat and death  on the banks of the Monongahela, General Johnson, on the other hand,  defeated a force of French regulars, Canadian Militia and Indians, under  General Dieskau, at the southern end of Lake George.    In 1756 war was publicly proclaimed between France and England,  although, as we have just seen, it had already broken out many months  previously in the forests of America. During the first two years of the  war the English forces sustained several disasters through the  incompetency of the English commanders on land and sea. The French in  Canada were now led by the Marquis de Montcalm, distinguished both as a  soldier of great ability and as a man of varied intellectual  accomplishments. In the early part of the Canadian campaign he was most  fortunate. Fort William Henry, at the foot of Lake George, and Fort  Oswego, on the south side of Lake Ontario, were captured, but his signal  victory at the former place was sullied by the massacre of defenceless  men, women and children by his Indian allies, although it is now  admitted by all impartial writers that he did his utmost to prevent so  sad a sequel to his triumph. The English Commander-in-Chief, Lord  Loudoun, assembled a large military force at Halifax in 1757 for the  purpose of making a descent on Louisbourg; but he returned to New York  without accomplishing anything, when he heard of the disastrous affair  of William Henry, for which he was largely responsible on account of  having failed to give sufficient support to the defenders of the fort.  Admiral Holbourne sailed to Louisbourg, but he did not succeed in coming  to an engagement with the French fleet then anchored in the harbour, and  the only result of his expedition was the loss of several of his ships  on the reefs of that foggy, rocky coast.    In 1758 Pitt determined to enter on a vigorous campaign against France  in Europe and America. For America he chose Amherst, Boscawen, Howe,  Forbes, Wolfe, Lawrence and Whitman. Abercromby was unfortunately  allowed to remain in place of Loudoun, but it was expected by Pitt and  others that Lord Howe, one of the best soldiers in the British army,  would make up for the military weakness of that commander. Louisbourg,  Fort Duquesne, and the forts on Lake George, were the immediate objects  of attack. Abercromby at the head of a large force failed ignominiously  in his assault on Ticonderoga, and Lord Howe was one of the first to  fall in that unhappy and ill-managed battle. Amherst and Boscawen, on  the other hand, took Louisbourg, where Wolfe displayed great energy and  contributed largely to the success of the enterprise. Forbes was able to  occupy the important fort at the forks of the Ohio, now Pittsburg, which  gave to the English control of the beautiful country to the west of the  Alleghanies. Fort Frontenac was taken by Bradstreet, and Prince Edward  Island, then called Isle St. Jean, was occupied by an English force as  the necessary consequence of the fall of the Cape Breton fortress. The  nation felt that its confidence in Pitt was fully justified, and that  the power of France in America was soon to be effectually broken.    In 1759 and 1760 Pitt's designs were crowned with signal success. Wolfe  proved at Quebec that the statesman had not overestimated his value as a  soldier and leader. Wolfe was supported by Brigadiers Moncton,  Townshend, Murray, and Guy Carleton--the latter a distinguished figure  in the later annals of Canada. The fleet was commanded by Admirals  Saunders, Durell and Holmes, all of whom rendered most effective  service. The English occupied the Island of Orleans and the heights of  Levis, from which they were able to keep up a most destructive fire on  the capital. The whole effective force under Wolfe did not reach 9000  men, or 5000 less than the regular and Colonial army under Montcalm,  whose lines extended behind batteries and earthworks from the St.  Charles River, which washes the base of the rocky heights of the town,  as far as the falls of Montmorency. The French held an impregnable  position which their general decided to maintain at all hazards, despite  the constant efforts of Wolfe for weeks to force him to the issue of  battle. Above the city for many miles there were steep heights, believed  to be unapproachable, and guarded at all important points by detachments  of soldiery. Wolfe failed in an attempt which he made at Beauport to  force Montcalm from his defences, and suffered a considerable loss  through the rashness of his grenadiers. He then resolved on a bold  stroke which succeeded by its very audacity in deceiving his opponent,  and giving the victory to the English. A rugged and dangerous path was  used at night up those very heights which, Montcalm confidently"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12664"],[0,"Lyrics of Earth (#6)"],[1," shall see the belted bees      Rocking with the tricksy breeze      In the spired meadow-sweet,      Or with eager trampling feet      Burrowing in the boneset blooms,      Treading out the dry perfumes.      Where sun-hot hay-fields newly mown      Climb the hillside ruddy brown,      I shall see the haymakers,      While the noonday scarcely stirs,      Brown of neck and booted gray,      Tossing up the rustling hay,      While the hay-racks bend and rock,      As they take each scented cock,      Jolting over dip and rise;      And the wavering butterflies      O'er the spaces brown and bare      Light and wander here and there.        I shall stray by many a stream,      Where the half-shut lilies gleam.      Napping out the sultry days      In the quiet secluded bays;      Where the tasseled rushes tower,      O'er the purple pickerel-flower.      And the floating dragon-fly--      Azure glint and crystal gleam--      Watches o'er the burnished stream      With his eye of ebony;      Where the bull-frog lolls at rest      On his float of lily-leaves,      That the swaying water weaves,      And distends his yellow breast,      Lowing out from shore to shore      With a hollow vibrant roar;      Where the softest wind that blows      As it lightly comes and goes,      O'er the jungled river meads,      Stirs a whisper in the reeds,      And wakes the crowded bull-rushes      From their stately reveries,      Flashing through their long-leaved hordes      Like a brandishing of swords;      There, too, the frost-like arrow-flowers      Tremble to the golden core,      Children of enchanted hours,      Whom the rustling river bore      In the night's bewildered noon,      Woven of water and the moon.        I shall hear the grasshoppers      From the parched grass rehearse,      And with drowsy note prolong      Evermore the same thin song.      I shall hear the crickets tell      Stories by the humming well,      And mark the locust, with quaint eyes,      Caper in his cloak of gray      Like a jester in disguise      Rattling by the dusty way.        I shall dream by upland fences,      Where the season's wealth condenses      Over many a weedy wreck,      Wild, uncared-for, desert places,      That sovereign Beauty loves to deck      With her softest, dearest graces.      There the long year dreams in quiet,      And the summer's strength runs riot.      Shall I not remember these,      Deep in winter reveries?      Berried brier and thistle-bloom,      And milkweed with its dense perfume;      Slender vervain towering up      In a many-branched cup,      Like a candlestick, each spire      Kindled with a violet fire;      Matted creepers and wild cherries,      Purple-bunched elderberries,      And on scanty plots of sod      Groves of branchy goldenrod.        What though autumn mornings now,      Winterward with glittering brow,      Stiffen in the silver grass;      And what though robins flock and pass,      With subdued and sober call,      To the old year's funeral;      Though October's crimson leaves      Rustle at the gusty door,      And the tempest round the eaves      Alternate with pipe and roar;      I sit, as erst, unharmed, secure,      Conscious that my store is sure,      Whatsoe'er the fenced fields,      Or the untilled forest yields      Of unhurt remembrances,      Or thoughts, far-glimpsed, half-followed, these      I have reaped and laid away,      A treasure of unwinnowed grain,      To the garner packed and gray      Gathered without toil or strain.        And when the darker days shall come,      And the fields are white and dumb;      When our fires are half in vain,      And the crystal starlight weaves      Mockeries of summer leaves,      Pictured on the icy pane;      When the high aurora gleams      Far above the Arctic streams      Like a line of shifting spears,      And the broad pine-circled meres,      Glimmering in that spectral light,      Thunder through the northern night;      Then within the bolted door      I shall con my summer store;      Though the fences scarcely show      Black above the drifted snow,      Though the icy sweeping wind      Whistle in the empty tree,      Safe within the sheltered mind,      I shall feed on memory.        Yet across the windy night      Comes upon its wings a cry;      Fashioned forms and modes take flight,      And a vision sad and high      Of the laboring world down there,      Where the lights burn red and warm,      Pricks my soul with sudden stare,      Glowing through the veils of storm.      In the city yonder sleep      Those who smile and those who weep,      Those whose lips are set with care,      Those whose brows are smooth and fair;      Mourners whom the dawning light      Shall grapple with an old distress;      Lovers folded at midnight      In their bridal happiness;      Pale watchers by beloved beds,      Fallen a-drowse with nodding heads,      Whom sleep captured by surprise,      With the circles round their eyes;      Maidens with quiet-taken breath,      Dreaming of enchanted bowers;      Old men with the mask of death;      Little children soft as flowers;      Those who wake wild-eyed and start      In some madness of the heart;      Those whose lips and brows of stone      Evil thoughts have graven upon,      Shade by shade and line by line,      Refashioning what was once divine.        All these sleep, and through the night,      Comes a passion and a cry,      With a blind sorrow and a might,      I know not whence, I know not why,      A something I cannot control,      A nameless hunger of the soul.      It holds me fast. In vain, in vain,      I remember how of old      I saw the ruddy race of men,      Through the glittering world outrolled,      A gay-smiling multitude,      All immortal, all divine,      Treading in a wreathed line      By a pathway through a wood.          THE SUN CUP          The earth is the cup of the sun,      That he filleth at morning with wine,      With the warm, strong wine of his might      From the vintage of gold and of light,      Fills it, and makes it divine.        And at night when his journey is done,      At the gate of his radiant hall,      He setteth his lips to the brim,      With a long last look of his eye,      And lifts it and draineth it dry,      Drains till he leaveth it all      Empty and hollow and dim.        And then, as he passes to sleep,      Still full of the feats that he did,      Long ago in Olympian wars,      He closes it down with the sweep      Of its slow-turning luminous lid,      Its cover of darkness and stars,      Wrought once by Hephaestus of old      With violet and vastness and gold.          The first edition of this book consists of five hundred copies, printed  by the Boston Engraving and McIndoe Printing Company, Boston, during  March, 1896, with fifty additional copies on Arnold paper."]]]
