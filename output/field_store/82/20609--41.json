What  was the fate that Cain specially feared?  Cain and Abel in the  original story, some writers believe, represented tribes (see  _Hist. Bible_, I, 44).  Among nomadic peoples in the early East, as  to-day, the punishment of murder was left to the family or tribe of  the murdered man.  Was this just or effective?  The same crude  method of avenging wrongs is found in the vendetta of Italy and the  family feuds in certain sparsely settled regions in the United  States.  The survival of this institution is to-day one of the  greatest obstacles to civilization in those regions.  Why?    In most criminal legislation the chief emphasis is placed on  punishment.  For example, thieves are punished with imprisonment.  Why?  A radical change in public opinion is now taking place.  The  prevailing method of dealing with crimes advocated by penologists  to-day is the protection of society if possible by the reform of  the criminal.  Does this method protect society effectually?  Why  is it that criminals generally prefer a definite term in prison  rather than an indefinite sentence with the possibility of release  in less than half the time? Which method of treatment is best in  the end for the wrong-doer?    It is important to distinguish clearly between the private and the  official attitude toward the criminal.  As individuals, who cannot  know the motives, we should heed the maxim of Jesus: \"Judge not!\"  As public officials whose duty it is to protect society, we are  under obligation to deal firmly and effectively with the criminal.  What would probably have been the result had Cain confessed his  crime?  God was far more lenient even with the unrepentant Cain  than were his fellow men.  Did God, however, remit Cain's sentence?  Cain said, \"I shall become a fugitive and a wanderer on the face of  the earth.\"  Was this sense of being an outcast the most painful  element in Cain's punishment?  All crime thus in a sense brings its  own punishment.  If in placing upon Cain a tribal mark, thereby  protecting him from being killed, God apparently aimed to give him  an opportunity to reform, the clear implication is that the divine  love and care still follow him.  That love and that care never  cease toward even the most depraved.  Compare Jesus' attitude  toward the criminal, as illustrated in his ministry and especially  in his dealing with the woman taken in adultery.  His forgiveness  of the woman's sin did not cancel the social results, but gave her  a new basis for right living in the future.  She realized that some  one believed in her.  Is this one of the most important influences  to-day in assisting weak men and in redeeming criminals?  Henry  Drummond when asked the secret of his success with men said, \"I  love men.\"      V.    HOW TO DEAL WITH CRIMINALS.    The purpose of criminal legislation and administration is clearly  the protection of society.  The criminals are punished, not for the  mere sake of the punishment or for vengeance, but to deter them  from further crime or to serve as a warning to others.  Only on  this account can punishment be justified.    To prove an effective warning the punishment for crime should be  certain, prompt and just.  For these reasons effective police,  upright judges and fair methods of procedure are absolutely  essential.  Efforts should be made not to influence the courts by  public opinion, and the pernicious prejudgment of cases by popular  newspapers should be discountenanced.    The surest method of stopping a criminal's dangerous activity is to  reform him; to give him a new and absorbing interest.  Experience  at our best reformatories shows that with the indeterminate  sentence a very large majority of young criminals can be  transformed into safe and useful citizens.  This method is both  cheaper and more effective than direct punishment for fixed terms.      VI.    THE PREVENTION OF CRIME.    The best method of dealing with crime is that of prevention.  The  work of protecting society against crime should begin with arousing  parents to the sense of their responsibilities and by training them  thoroughly in the duties of parenthood.  Philanthropic agencies,  the church, the schools, the State, may do much both by training  character and by removing temptation.  The maintenance of good  economic conditions, provision for wholesome amusements, improved  sanitation, all tend to remove pernicious influences and strengthen  the power of resistance to temptation.  The public press and the  theatre, which are at times exceedingly harmful agencies, may be  and should be transformed into active moral forces.  In furthering  all these reform measures and preventive movements each individual  has a personal responsibility, and, as an active citizen, he may  render most important service.  The home, the school, the church  and the State, all touch the individual on every side and create  and together control the influences that make or unmake character.      _Questions for Further Consideration_.    What was the effect of Cain's anger upon his own life?    Gladstone said, \"I do not have time to hate anybody.\"    In what way do anger and hatred hamper one's greatest usefulness?  Do you believe in the modern theories regarding the effect of  jealousy and hatred upon the body?    Is capital punishment at times a necessity?    What is the most effective argument which can be used to restore  honor and manhood to a criminal?    Is there any particular agency at work in your community to assist  men who have committed crimes?    Is the chief object of punishment to avenge the wrong, to punish  the criminal, to deter others from committing similar crimes, or to  reclaim the wrong-doer?      _Subjects for Further Study_.

When Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,  and that every purpose in the thoughts of his heart was only evil  continually, it was a source of regret that he had made man on the  earth and it grieved him to his heart.  Therefore Jehovah said, I  will destroy from the face of the ground man whom I have created,  for I regret that I have made mankind.    Then Jehovah said to Noah, enter thou and all thy house into the  ark; for thee I have found righteous before me in this generation.    And Noah did according to all that Jehovah commanded him.    Then Jehovah destroyed everything that existed upon the face of the  ground, both man and animals, and creeping things, and birds of the  heavens, so that they were destroyed from the earth; and Noah only  was left and they who were with him in the ark.--Gen. 6:5-8; 7:1,  5, 23 (_Hist. Bible_).    And without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing with God;  for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a  rewarder of them that seek after him.  By faith Noah, being warned  of God concerning things not seen as yet, moved with godly fear,  prepared an ark to the saving of his house, through which he  condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is  according to faith.--_Heb. 11:6, 7_.    Rare is the man who can look back over his life and not confess, at  least to himself, that the things which have made him most a man  are the very things from which he tried with all his soul to escape.      If we would attain happiness,    We must first attain helpfulness.      But stay! no age was e'er degenerate    Unless men held it at too cheap a rate,    For in our likeness still we shape our fate.      --_Lowell_.      I.    THE TWO BIBLICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE FLOOD.    Careful readers of Genesis 6-9 have long recognized certain  difficulties in interpreting the narrative as it now stands.  Thus,  for example, in 6:20 Noah is commanded to take into the ark two of  every kind of beast and bird; but in 7:2, 3 he is commanded to take  in seven of all the clean beasts and birds.  According to 7:4, 12  the flood came as the result of a forty days' rain; but according  to 7:11 it was because the fountains of the great deep were broken  up and the windows of heaven were opened.  Again, according to  7:17, the flood continued on the earth forty days; while according  to 7:24 its duration was a hundred and fifty days.    These fundamental variations and the presence of duplicate versions  of the same incidents point, some writers think, to two originally  distinct accounts of the flood which have been closely woven  together by the final editor of the book of Genesis.  When these  two accounts are disentangled, they are each practically complete  and apparently represent variant versions of the same flood story.  (See _Hist. Bible_, I, 53-56, for these two parallel accounts.) The  one, known as the prophetic version, was written, these writers  believe, about 650 B.C.  It has the flowing, vivid, picturesque,  literary style and the point of view of the prophetic teacher.  In  this account the number seven prevails.  Seven of each clean beast  and bird are taken into the ark to provide food for Noah and his  family.  Seven days the waters rose, and at intervals of seven days  he sent out a raven and a dove.

As for Buck Daniels, he changed from a dark bronze to an unhealthy  yellow; fear, plain and grimly unmistakable, was in his face. Then he  strode to the window and threw it open with a crash. The wind leaped in  and tossed the flame in the throat of the chimney, so that great shadows  waved suddenly through the room, and made the chairs seem afloat. Even  the people were suddenly unreal. And the rush of the storm gave Byrne an  eerie sensation of being blown through infinite space. For a moment  there was only the sound of the gale and the flapping of a loose picture  against the wall, and the rattling of a newspaper. Then he heard it.    First it was a single note which he could not place. It was music, and  yet it was discordant, and it had the effect of a blast of icy wind.    Once he had been in Egypt and had stood in a corridor of Cheops'  pyramid. The torch had been blown out in the hand of his guide. From  somewhere in the black depths before them came a laugh, made unhuman by  echoes. And Byrne had visioned the mummied dead pushing back the granite  lids of their sarcophagi and sitting upright.    But that was nothing compared with this. Not half so wild or strange.    He listened again, breathless, with the sharp prickling running up and  down his spine. It was the honking of the wild geese, flying north. And  out of the sound he builded a picture of the grey triangle cleaving  through the cold upper sky, sent on a mission no man could understand.    \"Was I right? Was I right?\" shrilled the invalid, and when Byrne turned  towards him, he saw the old man sitting erect, with an expression of  wild triumph. There came an indescribable cry from the girl, and a deep  throated curse from Buck Daniels as he slammed down the window.    With the chill blast shut off and the flame burning steadily once more  in the lamp, a great silence besieged the room, with a note of  expectancy in it. Byrne was conscious of being warm, too warm. It was  close in the room, and he was weighted down. It was as if another  presence had stepped into the room and stood invisible. He felt it with  unspeakable keenness, as when one knows certainly the thoughts which  pass in the mind of another. And, more than that, he knew that the  others in the room felt what he felt. In the waiting silence he saw that  the old man lay on his couch with eyes of fire and gaping lips, as if  he drank the wine of his joyous expectancy. And big Buck Daniels stood  with his hand on the sash of the window, frozen there, his eyes bulging,  his heart thundering in his throat. And Kate Cumberland sat with her  eyes closed, as she had closed them when the wind first rushed upon her,  and she still smiled as she had smiled then. And to Byrne, more terrible  than the joy of Joseph Cumberland or the dread of Buck Daniels was the  smile and the closed eyes of the girl.    But the silence held and the fifth presence was in the room, and not one  of them dared speak.          CHAPTER VI    THE MISSION STARTS      Then, with a shifting of the wind, a song was blown to them from the  bunk-house, a cheerful, ringing chorus; the sound was like daylight--it  drove the terror from the room. Joe Cumberland asked them to leave him.  That night, he said, he would sleep. He felt it, like a promise. The  other three went out from the room.    In the hall Kate and Daniels stood close together under a faint light  from the wall-lamp, and they talked as if they had forgotten the  presence of Byrne.    \"It had to come,\" she said. \"I knew it would come to him sooner or  later, but I didn't dream it would be as terrible as this. Buck, what  are we going to do?\"    \"God knows,\" said the big cowpuncher. \"Just wait, I s'pose, same as  we've been doing.\"    He had aged wonderfully in that moment of darkness.    \"He'll be happy now for a few days,\" went on the girl, \"but  afterwards--when he realises that it means nothing--what then, Buck?\"    The man took her hands and began to pat them softly as a father might  soothe a child.    \"I seen you when the wind come in,\" he said gently. \"Are you going to  stand it, Kate? Is it going to be hell for you, too, every time you hear  'em?\"    She answered: \"If it were only I! Yes, I could stand it. Lately I've  begun to think that I can stand anything. But when I see Dad it breaks  my heart--and you--oh, Buck, it hurts, it hurts!\" She drew his hands  impulsively against her breast. \"If it were only something we could  fight outright!\"    Buck Daniels sighed.    \"Fight?\" he echoed hopelessly. \"Fight? Against him? Kate, you're all  tired out. Go to bed, honey, and try to stop thinkin'--and--God help us  all!\"    She turned away from him and passed the doctor--blindly.    Buck Daniels had set his foot on the stairs when Byrne hurried after him  and touched his arm; they went up together.    \"Mr. Daniels,\" said the doctor, \"it is necessary that I speak with you,  alone. Will you come into my room for a few moments?\"    \"Doc,\" said the cattleman, \"I'm short on my feed and I don't feel a pile  like talkin'. Can't you wait till the morning?\"    \"There has been a great deal too much waiting, Mr. Daniels,\" said the  doctor. \"What I have to say to you must be said now. Will you come in?\"    \"I will,\" nodded Buck Daniels. \"But cut it short.\"    Once in his room the doctor lighted the lamp and then locked the door.    \"What's all the mystery and hush stuff?\" growled Daniels, and with a  gesture he refused the proffered chair. \"Cut loose, doc, and make it  short.\"    The little man sat down, removed his glasses, held them up to the light,  found a speck upon them, polished it carefully away, replaced the  spectacles upon his nose, and peered thoughtfully at Buck Daniels.    Buck Daniels rolled his eyes towards the door and then even towards the  window, and then, as one who accepts the inevitable, he sank into a  chair and plunged his hands into his pockets, prepared to endure.    \"I am called,\" went on the doctor dryly, \"to examine a case in which the  patient is dangerously ill--in fact, hopelessly ill, and I have found  that the cause of his illness is a state of nervous expectancy on the  part of the sufferer. It being obviously necessary to know the nature of  the disease and its cause before that cause may be removed, I have asked  you to sit here this evening to give me whatever explanation you may  have for it.\"    Buck Daniels stirred uneasily. At length he broke out: \"Doc, I size you  up as a gent with brains. I got one piece of advice for you: get the  hell away from the Cumberland Ranch and never come back again!\"    The doctor flushed and his lean jaw thrust out.    \"Although,\" he said, \"I cannot pretend to be classed among those to whom  physical fear is an unknown, yet I wish to assure you, sir, that with me  physical trepidation is not an overruling motive.\"    \"Oh, hell!\" groaned Buck Daniels. Then he explained more gently: \"I  don't say you're yellow. All I say is: this mess ain't one that you can  straighten out--nor no other man can. Give it up, wash your hands, and  git back to Elkhead. I dunno what Kate was thinkin' of to bring you out  here!\"    \"The excellence of your intention,\" said the doctor, \"I shall freely  admit, though the assumption that difficulty in the essential problem  would deter me from the analysis is an hypothesis which I cannot leave  uncontested. In the vulgar, I may give you to understand that I am in  this to stay!\"    Buck Daniels started to speak, but thinking better of it he shrugged his  shoulders and sat back, resigned.    \"Well,\" he said, \"Kate brought you out here. Maybe she has a reason for  it. What d'you want to know?\"    \"What connection,\" said the doctor, \"have wild geese with a man, a  horse, and a dog?\"    \"What in hell d'you know about a horse and a man and a dog--and wild  geese?\" inquired Buck in a strained voice.    \"Rumour,\" said the doctor, \"has been in this instance, unfortunately, my  only teacher. But, sir, I have ascertained that Mr. Cumberland, his  daughter, and you, sir, are all waiting for a certain thing to come to  this ranch, and that thing I naturally assume to be a man.\"    \"Doc,\" said the cowpuncher sarcastically, \"there ain't no doubt you got  a wonderful brain!\"    \"Mockery,\" pronounced the man of learning, \"is a use of the mental  powers which is both unworthy and barren and does not in this case  advance the argument, which is: Who and what is this man for whom you  wait?\"    \"He came,\" said Buck Daniels, \"out of nowhere. That's all we know about  who he is. What is he? I'll tell you easy: He's a gent that looks like a  man, and walks like a man, and talks like a man--but he _ain't_ a man.\"    \"Ah,\" nodded the philosopher, \"a crime of extraordinary magnitude has,  perhaps, cut off this unfortunate fellow from communication with others  of his kind. Is this the case?\"    \"It ain't,\" replied Buck. \"Doc, tell me this: Can a wolf commit a  crime?\"    \"Admitting this definition: that crime is the breaking of law, and that  law is a force created by reason to control the rational, it may be  granted that the acts of the lower animals lie outside of categories  framed according to ethical precepts. To directly answer your not  incurious question: I believe that a wolf cannot commit a crime.\"    Buck Daniels sighed.    \"D'you know, doc,\" he said gravely, \"that you remind me of a side-hill  goat?\"    \"Ah,\" murmured the man of learning, \"is it possible? And what, Mr.  Daniels, is the nature of a side-hill goat?\"    \"It's a goat that's got the legs of one side shorter than the legs on  the other side, and the only way he can get to the top of a hill is to  keep trottin' around and"]]]
