I wish you'd  take one, Mrs. Lascelles, or I shall think I've been misunderstood all  round!\"    \"No, thank you, Captain Clephane. That old-fashioned feeling is  infectious.\"    \"Then I will,\" cried Bob, \"to show there's no ill-feeling. You old  fire-eater, I believe you just put up the argument to change the  conversation. Wouldn't you like a chair for those game legs?\"    \"No, I've got to use them in moderation. I was going to have a stroll  when I spotted you at last.\"    \"Then we'll all take one together,\" cried the genial old Bob once more.  \"It's a bit cold standing here, don't you think, Mrs. Lascelles? After  you with the match!\"    But I held it so long that he had to strike another, for I had looked on  Mrs. Lascelles at last. It was not an obviously interesting face, like  Catherine's, but interest there was of another kind. There was nothing  intellectual in the low brow, no enthusiasm for books and pictures in  the bold eyes, no witticism waiting on the full lips; but in the curve  of those lips and the look from those eyes, as in the deep chin and the  carriage of the hooded head, there was something perhaps not lower than  intellect in the scale of personal equipment. There was, at all events,  character and to spare. Even by the brief glimmer of a single match I  could see that (and more) for myself. Then came a moment's interval  before Bob struck his light, and in that moment her face changed. As I  saw it next, it appealed, it entreated, until the second match was  flung away. And the appeal was to such purpose that I do not think I was  five seconds silent.    \"And what do you do with yourself up here all day? I mean you hale  people; of course, I can only potter in the sun.\"    The question, perhaps, was better in intention than in tact. I did not  mean them to take it to themselves, but Bob's answer showed that it was  open to misconstruction.    \"Some people climb,\" said he; \"you'll know them by their noses. The  glaciers are almost as bad, though, aren't they, Mrs. Lascelles? Lots of  people potter about the glaciers. It's rather sport in the serracs;  you've got to rope. But you'll find lots more loafing about the place  all day, reading Tauchnitz novels, and watching people on the Matterhorn  through the telescope. That's the sort of thing, isn't it, Mrs.  Lascelles?\"    She also had misunderstood the drift of my unlucky question. But there  was nothing disingenuous in her reply. It reminded me of her eyes, as I  had seen them by the light of the first match.    \"Mr. Evers doesn't say that he is a climber himself, Captain Clephane;  but he is a very keen one, and so am I. We are both beginners, so we  have begun together. It's such fun. We do some little thing every day;  to-day we did the Schwarzee. You won't be any wiser, and the real  climbers wouldn't call it climbing, but it means three thousand feet  first and last. To-morrow we are going to the Monte Rosa hut. There is  no saying where we shall end up, if this weather holds.\"    In this fashion Mrs. Lascelles not only made me a contemptuous present  of information which I had never sought, but tacitly rebuked poor Bob  for his gratuitous attempt at concealment. Clearly, they had nothing to  conceal; and the hotel talk was neither more nor less than hotel talk.  There was, nevertheless, a certain self-consciousness in the attitude of  either (unless I grossly misread them both) which of itself afforded  some excuse for the gossips in my own mind.    Yet I did not know; every moment gave me a new point of view. On my  remarking, genuinely enough, that I only wished I could go with them,  Bob Evers echoed the wish so heartily that I could not but believe that  he meant what he said. On his side, in that case, there could be  absolutely nothing. And yet, again, when Mrs. Lascelles had left us, as  she did ere long in the easiest and most natural manner, and when we had  started a last cigarette together, then once more I was not so sure of  him.    \"That's rather a handsome woman,\" said I, with perhaps more than the  authority to which my years entitled me. But I fancied it would \"draw\"  poor Bob. And it did.    \"Rather handsome!\" said he, with a soft little laugh not altogether  complimentary to me. \"Yes, I should almost go as far myself. Still I  don't see how _you_ know; you haven't so much as seen her, my dear  fellow.\"    \"Haven't we been walking up and down outside this lighted veranda for  the last ten minutes?\"    Bob emitted a pitying puff. \"Wait till you see her in the sunlight!  There's not many of them can stand it, as they get it up here. But she  can--like anything!\"    \"She has made an impression on you, Bob,\" said I, but in so sedulously  inoffensive a manner that his self-betrayal was all the greater when he  told me quite hotly not to be an ass.    Now I was more than ten years his senior, and Bob's manners were as  charming as only the manners of a nice Eton boy can be; therefore I held  my peace, but with difficulty refrained from nodding sapiently to  myself. We took a couple of steps in silence, then Bob stopped short. I  did the same. He was still a little stern; we were just within range of  the veranda lights, and I can see and hear him to this day, almost as  clearly as I did that night.    \"I'm not much good at making apologies,\" he began, with rather less  grace than becomes an apologist; but it was more than enough for me from  Bob.    \"Nor I at receiving them, my dear Bob.\"    \"Well, you've got to receive one now, whether you accept it or not. I  was the ass myself, and I beg your pardon!\"    Somehow I felt it was a good deal for a lad to say, at that age, and  with Bob's upbringing and popularity, even though he said it rather  scornfully in the fewest words. The scorn was really for himself, and I  could well understand it. Nay, I was glad to have something to forgive  in the beginning, I with my unforgivable mission, and would have laughed  the matter off without another word if Bob had let me.    \"I'm a bit raw on the point,\" said he, taking my arm for a last turn,  \"and that's the truth. There was a fellow who came out with me, quite a  good chap really, and a tremendous pal of mine at Eton, yet he behaved  like a lunatic about this very thing. Poor chap, he reads like anything,  and I suppose he'd been overdoing it, for he actually asked me to choose  between Mrs. Lascelles and himself! What could a fellow do but let the  poor old simpleton go? They seem to think you can't be pals with a woman  without wanting to make love to her. Such utter rot! I confess I lose my  hair with them; but that doesn't excuse me in the least for losing it  with you.\"    I assured him, on the other hand, that his very natural irritability on  the subject made all the difference in the world. \"But whom,\" I added,  \"do you mean by 'them'? Not anybody else in the hotel?\"    \"Good heavens, no!\" cried Bob, finding a fair target for his scorn at  last. \"Do you think I care twopence what's said or thought by people I  never saw in my life before and am never likely to see again? I know how  I'm behaving. What does it matter what they think? Not that they're  likely to bother their heads about us any more than we do about them.\"    \"You don't know that.\"    \"I certainly don't care,\" declared my lordly youth, with obvious  sincerity. \"No, I was only thinking of poor old George Kennerley and  people like him, if there are any. I did care what he thought, that is  until I saw he was as mad as anything on the subject. It was too silly.  I tell you what, though, I'd value your opinion!\" And he came to another  stop and confronted me again, but this time such a picture of boyish  impulse and of innocent trust in me (even by that faint light) that I  was myself strongly inclined to be honest with him on the spot. But I  only smiled and shook my head.    \"Oh, no, you wouldn't,\" I assured him.    \"But I tell you I would!\" he cried. \"Do _you_ think there's any harm in  my going about with Mrs. Lascelles because I rather like her and she  rather likes me? I won't condescend to give you my word that I mean  none.\"    What answer could I give? His charming frankness quite disarmed me, and  the more completely because I felt that a dignified reticence would have  been yet more characteristic of this clean, sweet youth, with his noble  unconsciousness alike of evil and of evil speaking. I told him the  truth--that there could be no harm at all with such a fellow as himself.  And he wrung my hand until he hurt it; but the physical pain was a  relief.    Never can I remember going up to bed with a better opinion of another  person, or a worse one of myself. How could I go on with my thrice  detestable undertaking? Now that I was so sure of him, why should I even  think of it for another moment? Why not go back to London and tell his  mother that her early confidence had not been misplaced, that the lad  did know how to take care of himself, and better still of any woman whom  he chose to honour with his bright, pure-hearted friendship? All this I  felt as strongly as any conviction I have ever held. Why, then, could I  not write it at once to Catherine in as many words?    Strange how one forgets, how I had forgotten in half an hour! The reason  came home to me on the stairs, and for the second time.    It had come home first by the light of those two matches, struck outside  in the dark part of the deserted terrace. It was not the lad whom I  distrusted, but the woman of whose face I had then obtained my only  glimpse--that night.    I had known her, after all, in India years before.          CHAPTER IV    A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE      Once in the Town Hall at Simla (the only time I was ever there) it was  my fortune to dance with a Mrs. Heymann of Lahore, a tall woman, but a  featherweight partner, and in all my dancing days I never had a better  waltz. To my delight she had one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11171"],[0,"Uncle Tom's Cabin, Young Folks' Edition (#6)"],[1,"you born?'    'Never was born.'    'You mustn't answer me like that, child,' said Miss Ophelia sternly. 'I  am not playing with you. Tell me where you were born, and who your  father and mother were.'    'Never was born,' said Topsy again very decidedly. 'Never had no father,  nor mother, nor nothin!'    Miss Ophelia hardly knew what to make of her. 'How long have you lived  with your master and mistress, then?' she asked.    'Dunno, missis.'    'Is it a year, or more, or less?'    'Dunno, missis.'    'Have you ever heard anything about God, Topsy?' asked Miss Ophelia  next.    Topsy looked puzzled, but kept on grinning.    'Do you know who made you?'    'Nobody as I knows on,' replied Topsy, with a laugh. 'Spect I grow'd.  Don't think nobody ever made me.'    [Illustration]    'Do you know how to sew?' asked Miss Ophelia, quite shocked.    'No, missis.'    'What can you do? What did you do for your master and mistress?'    'Fetch water, and wash dishes, and clean knives, and wait on folks.'    'Well, now, Topsy, I'm going to show you just how my bed is to be made.  I am very particular about my bed. You must learn exactly how to do it.'    'Yes, missis,' said Topsy, with a deep sigh and a face of woeful  earnestness.    'Now, Topsy, look here. This is the hem of the sheet. This is the right  side of the sheet. This is the wrong. Will you remember?'    'Yes, missis,' said Topsy with another sigh.    'Well, now, the under-sheet you must bring over the bolster--so, and  tuck it right down under the mattress nice and smooth--so. Do you see?'    'Yes, missis.'    'But the upper sheet,' said Miss Ophelia, 'must be brought down in this  way, and tucked under, firm and smooth, at the foot--so, the narrow hem  at the foot.'    'Yes, missis,' said Topsy as before. But while Miss Ophelia was bending  over the bed she had quickly seized a pair of gloves and a ribbon, which  were lying on the dressing-table, and slipped them up her sleeves. When  Miss Ophelia looked up again, the naughty little girl was standing with  meekly-folded hand as before.    'Now, Topsy, let me see you do this,' said Miss Ophelia, pulling the  clothes off again and seating herself.    Topsy, looking very earnest, did it all just as she had been shown. She  did it so quickly and well that Miss Ophelia was very pleased. But,  alas! as she was finishing, an end of ribbon came dangling out of her  sleeve.    'What is this?' said Miss Ophelia, seizing it. 'You naughty, wicked  child--you have been stealing this.'    The ribbon was pulled out of Topsy's own sleeve. Yet she did not seem a  bit ashamed. She only looked at it with an air of surprise and  innocence.    'Why, that's Miss Feely's ribbon, an't it? How could it a got into my  sleeve?'    'Topsy, you naughty girl, don't tell me a lie. You stole that ribbon,'    'Missis, I declare I didn't. Never seed it till dis blessed minnit.'    'Topsy,' said Miss Ophelia, 'don't you know it is wicked to tell lies?'    'I never tells no lies, Miss Feely,' said Topsy. 'It's jist the truth  I've been, tellin' now. It an't nothin' else.'    [Illustration]    'Topsy, I shall have to whip you, if you tell lies so.'    'Laws, missis, if you whip's all day, couldn't say no other way,' said  Topsy, beginning to cry. 'I never seed dat ribbon. It must a caught in  my sleeve. Miss Feely must'a left it on the bed, and it got caught in  the clothes, and so got in my sleeve.'    Miss Ophelia was so angry at such a barefaced lie that she caught Topsy  and shook her. 'Don't tell me that again,' she said.    The shake brought the gloves on the floor from the other sleeve.    'There,' said Miss Ophelia, 'will you tell me now you didn't steal the  ribbon?'    Topsy now confessed to stealing the gloves. But she, still said she had  not taken the ribbon.    'Now, Topsy', said Miss Ophelia kindly, 'if you will confess all about  it I won't whip you this time.'    So Topsy confessed to having stolen both the ribbon and the gloves. She  said she was very, very sorry, and would never do it again.    'Well, now, tell me,' said Miss Ophelia, 'have you taken anything else  since you have been in the house? If you confess I won't whip you.'    'Laws, missis, I took Miss Eva's red thing she wears on her neck.'    'You did, you naughty child! Well, what else?'    'I took Rosa's ear-rings--them red ones.'    'Go and bring them to me this minute--both of them.'    'Laws, missis, I can't--they's burnt up.'    'Burnt up? What a story! Go and get them, or I shall whip you.'    Topsy began to cry and groan, and declare that she could not. 'They's  burnt up, they is.'    'What did you burn them up for?' asked Miss Ophelia.    'Cause I's wicked, I is. I's mighty wicked, anyhow. I can't help it.'    Just at this minute Eva came into the room wearing her coral necklace.    'Why, Eva, where did you get your necklace?' said Miss Ophelia.    'Get it? Why, I have had it on all day,' answered Eva, rather surprised.  'And what is funny, aunty, I had it on all night too. I forgot to take  it off when I went to bed.'    Miss Ophelia looked perfectly astonished. She was more astonished still  when, next minute, Rosa, who was one of the housemaids, came in with a  basket of clean clothes, wearing her coral ear-rings as usual.    I'm sure I don't know what to do with such a child,' she said, in  despair. 'What in the world made you tell me you took those things,  Topsy?'    'Why, missis said I must 'fess. I couldn't think of nothing else to  'fess,' said Topsy, wiping her eyes.    'But of course, I didn't want you to confess things you didn't do,' said  Miss Ophelia. 'That is telling a lie just as much as the other.'    'Laws, now, is it?' said Topsy, looking surprised and innocent.    'Poor Topsy,' said Eva, 'why need you steal? You are going to be taken  good care of now. I am sure I would rather give you anything of mine  than have you steal it.'    Topsy had never been spoken to so kindly and gently in all her life.  For a minute she looked as if she were going to cry. The next she was  grinning as usual in her ugly way.    What was to be done with Topsy? Miss Ophelia was quite puzzled. She shut  her up in a dark room till she could think about it.    'I don't see,' she said to Mr. St. Clare, 'how I am going to manage that  child without whipping her.'    'Well, whip her, then.'    'I never heard of bringing up children without it,' said Miss Ophelia.    'Oh, well, do as you think best. Only, I have seen this child beaten  with a poker, knocked down with the shovel or tongs, or anything that  came handy. So I don't think your beatings will have much effect.'    'What is to be done with her, then?' said Miss Ophelia. 'I never saw  such a child as this.'    But Mr. St. Clare could not answer her question. So Miss Ophelia had to  go on, as best she could, trying to make Topsy a good girl.    She taught her to read and to sew. Topsy liked reading, and learned her  letters like magic. But she could not bear sewing. So she broke her  needles or threw them away. She tangled, broke, and dirtied her cotton  and hid her reels. Miss Ophelia felt sure all these things could not be  accidents. Yet she could never catch Topsy doing them.    In a very few days Topsy had learned how to do Miss Ophelia's room  perfectly, for she was very quick and clever. But if Miss Ophelia ever  left her to do it by herself there was sure to be dreadful confusion.    Instead of making the bed, she would amuse herself with pulling off the  pillow-cases. Then she would butt her woolly head among the pillows,  until it was covered with feathers sticking out in all directions. She  would climb the bedpost, and hang head downwards from the top; wave the  sheets and covers all over the room; dress the bolster up in Miss  Ophelia's nightgown and act scenes with it, singing, whistling, and  making faces at herself in the looking-glass all the time.    'Topsy,' Miss Ophelia would say, when her patience was at an end, 'what  makes you behave so badly?'    'Dunno, missis--I'spects' cause I's so wicked.'    'I don't know what I shall do with you, Topsy.'    'Laws, missis, you must whip me. My old missis always did. I an't used  to workin' unless I gets whipped.'    So Miss Ophelia tried it. Topsy would scream and groan and implore. But  half an hour later she would be sitting among the other little niggers  belonging to the house, laughing about it. 'Miss Feely whip!' she would  say, 'she can't do it nohow.'    'Law, you niggers,' she would go on, 'does you know you's all sinners?  Well, you is; everybody is. White folks is sinners too--Miss Feely says  so. But I 'spects niggers is the biggest ones. But ye an't any of ye up  to me. I's so awful wicked, there can't nobody do nothin' with me. I  'spects I's the wickedest crittur in the world.' Then she would turn a  somersault, and come up bright and smiling, evidently quite pleased with  herself.          CHAPTER XV      EVA AND TOPSY      Two or three years passed. Uncle Tom was still with Mr. St. Clare, far  away from his home. He was not really unhappy. But always in his heart  was the aching longing to see his dear ones again.    Now he began to have a new sorrow. He loved his little mistress Eva very  tenderly, and she was ill.    He saw that she was growing white and thin. She no longer ran and played  in the garden for hours together as she used to do. She was always tired  now.    Miss Ophelia noticed it too, and tried to make Mr. St. Clare see it. But  he would not. He loved his little Eva so much, that he did not want to  believe that anything could be the matter with her.    Mrs. St. Clare never thought that any one, except herself, could be ill.  So Eva grew daily thinner and weaker, and Uncle Tom and Aunt Ophelia  more and more sad and anxious.    But at last she became so unwell, that even Mr. St. Clare had to own  that something was wrong, and the doctor was sent for.    In a week or two she was very much better. Once more she"]]]
