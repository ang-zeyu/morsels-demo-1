[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14470"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 12 (#6)"],[1,"you are making such a noise.    BOLZ.    You can't? What have you just written, then? At most, I imagine, a  letter to a ballet-dancer or an order to your tailor.    BELLMAUS.    No, he writes tender letters. He is seriously in love, for he took me  walking in the moonlight yesterday and scorned the idea of a drink.    KAeMPE (_who has seated himself comfortably_).    Gentlemen, it is unfair to call a man away from his work for the sake  of making such poor jokes.    BOLZ.    Yes, yes, he evidently slanders you when he maintains that you love  anything else but your new boots and to some small degree your own  person. You yourself are a love-spurting nature, little Bellmaus. You  glow like a fusee whenever you see a young lady. Spluttering and smoky  you hover around her, and yet don't dare even to address her. But we  must be lenient with him; his shyness is to blame. He blushes in  woman's presence, and is still capable of lovely emotions, for he  started out to be a lyric poet.    BELLMAUS.    I don't care to be continually reproached with my poems. Did I ever  read them to you?    BOLZ.    No, thank Heaven, that audacity you never had. (_Seriously._) But,  now, gentlemen, to business. Today's number is ready. Oldendorf is not  yet here, but meanwhile, let us hold a confidential session. Oldendorf  _must_ be chosen deputy from this town to the next Parliament; our  party and the _Union must_ put that through. How does our stock stand  today?    KAeMPE.    Remarkably high. Our opponents agree that no other candidate would be  so dangerous for them, and our friends everywhere are most hopeful.  But you know how little that may signify. Here is the list of the  voters. Our election committee sends word to you that our calculations  were correct. Of the hundred voters from our town, forty surely ours.  About an equal number are pledged to the other party; the remnant of  some twenty votes are undecided. It is clear that the election will  be determined by a very small majority.    BOLZ.    Of course we shall have that majority--a majority of from eight to ten  votes. Just say that, everywhere, with the greatest assuredness. Many  a one who is still undecided will come over to us on hearing that we  are the stronger. Where is the list of our uncertain voters? [_Looks  it over._]    KAeMPE.    I have placed a mark wherever our friends think some influence might  be exerted.    BOLZ.    I see two crosses opposite one name; what do they signify?    KAeMPE.    That is Piepenbrink, the wine-dealer Piepenbrink. He has a large  following in his district, is a well-to-do man, and, they say, can  command five or six votes among his adherents.    BOLZ.    Him we must have. What sort of a man is he?    KAeMPE.    He is very blunt, they say, and no politician at all.    BELLMAUS.    But he has a pretty daughter.    KAeMPE.    What's the use of his pretty daughter? I'd rather he had an ugly  wife--one could get at him more easily.    BELLMAUS.    Yes, but he has one--a lady with little curls and fiery red ribbons  in her cap.    BOLZ.    Wife or no wife, the man must be ours. Hush, some one is coming; that  is Oldendorf's step. He needn't know anything of our conference. Go to  your room, gentlemen. To be continued this evening.    KAeMPE (_at the door_).    It is still agreed, I suppose, that in the next number I resume the  attack on the new correspondent of the _Coriolanus_, the one with the  arrow.    BOLZ.    Yes, indeed. Pitch into him, decently but hard. Just now, on the eve  of the election, a little row with our opponents will do us good; and  the articles with the arrow give us a great opening.    [_Exeunt_ KAeMPE _and_ BELLMAUS.]    _Enter_ OLDENDORF _through centre door._    OLDENDORF.    Good-day, Conrad.    BOLZ (_at the table on the right, looking over the list of voters_).    Blessed be thy coming! The mail is over there; there is nothing of  importance.    OLDENDORF.    Do you need me here today?    BOLZ.    No, my darling. This evening's issue is ready. For tomorrow Kaempe is  writing the leading article.    OLDENDORF.    About what?    BOLZ.    A little skirmish with the _Coriolanus_. Another one against the  unknown correspondent with the arrow who attacked our party. But do  not worry; I told Kaempe to make the article dignified, very dignified.    OLDENDORF.    For Heaven's sake, don't! The article must not be written.    BOLZ.    I fail to comprehend you. What use are political opponents if you  cannot attack them?    OLDENDORF.    Now see here! These articles were written by the Colonel; he told me  so himself today.    BOLZ.    Thunder and lightning!    OLDENDORF (_gloomily_).    You may imagine that along with this admission went other intimations  which place me just now in a very uncomfortable position as regards  the Colonel and his family.    BOLZ (_seriously_).    And what does the Colonel want you to do?    OLDENDORF.    He will be reconciled to me if I resign the editorship of this paper  and withdraw as candidate for election.    BOLZ.    The devil! He is moderate in his demands!    OLDENDORF.    I suffer under this discord; to you, as my friend, I can say so.    BOLZ (_going up to him and pressing his hand_).    Solemn moment of manly emotion!    OLDENDORF.    Don't play the clown just now. You can imagine how unpleasant my  position in the Colonel's house has become. The worthy old gentleman  either frigid or violent; the conversation spiced with bitter  allusions; Ida suffering--I can often see that she has been crying. If  our party wins and I become member for the town, I fear I shall lose  all hope of marrying Ida.    BOLZ (_vehemently_).    And if you withdraw it will be a serious blow to our party. (_Rapidly  and emphatically._) The coming session of Parliament will determine  the fate of the country. The parties are almost equal. Every loss is a  blow of a vote to our cause. In this town we have no other candidate  but you, who is sufficiently popular to make his election probable. If  you withdraw from the contest, no matter what the reason, our  opponents win.    OLDENDORF.    Unfortunately what you say is true.    BOLZ (_with continued vehemence_).    I won't dwell on my confidence in your talents. I am convinced that,  in the House, and, possibly, as one of the ministers, you will be of  service to your country. I merely ask you, now, to remember your duty  to our political friends, who have pinned their faith on you, and to  this paper and ourselves, who for three years have worked for the  credit of the name of Oldendorf which heads our front page. Your honor  is at stake, and every moment of wavering is wrong.    OLDENDORF (_dignified_).    You are exciting yourself without reason. I too deem it wrong to  retire now when I am told that our cause needs me. But in confessing  to you, my friend, that my decision means a great personal sacrifice,  I am not compromising either our cause or ourselves as individuals.    BOLZ (_soothingly_).    Right you are! You are a loyal comrade. And so peace, friendship,  courage! Your old Colonel won't be inexorable.    OLDENDORF.    He has grown intimate with Senden, who flatters him in every way, and  has plans, I fear, which affect me also. I should feel still more  worried but for knowing that I have now a good advocate in the  Colonel's house. Adelaide Runeck has just arrived.    BOLZ.    Adelaide Runeck? She into the bargain! (_Quickly calling through the  door on the right._) Kaempe, the article against the knight of the  arrow is not to be written. Understand?    _Enter_ KAeMPE.    KAeMPE (_at the door, pen in hand_).    But what is to be written, then?    BOLZ.    The devil only knows! See here! Perhaps I can induce Oldendorf to  write the leading article for tomorrow himself. But at all events you  must have something on hand.    KAeMPE.    But what?    BOLZ (_excitedly_).    For all I care write about emigration to Australia; that, at any rate,  will give no offense.    KAeMPE.    Good! Am I to encourage it or advise against it?    BOLZ (_quickly_).    Advise against it, of course; we need every one who is willing to work  here at home. Depict Australia as a contemptible hole. Be perfectly  truthful but make it as black as possible--how the Kangaroo, balled  into a heap, springs with invincible malice at the settler's head,  while the duckbill nips at the back of his legs; how the gold-seeker  has, in winter, to stand up to his neck in salt water while for three  months in summer he has not a drop to drink; how he may live through  all that only to be eaten up at last by thievish natives. Make it very  vivid and end up with the latest market prices for Australian wool  from the _Times_. You'll find what books you need in the library.  [_Slams the door to._]    OLDENDORF (_at the table_).    Do you know Miss Runeck? She often inquires about you in her letters  to Ida.    BOLZ.    Indeed? Yes, to be sure, I know her. We are from the same village--she  from the manor-house, I from the parsonage. My father taught us  together. Oh, yes, I know her!    OLDENDORF.    How comes it that you have drifted so far apart? You never speak of  her.    BOLZ.    H'm! It is an old story--family quarrels, Montagues and Capulets. I  have not seen her for a long time.    OLDENDORF (_smiling_).    I hope that you too were not estranged by politics.    BOLZ.    Politics did, indeed, have something to do with our separation; you  see it is the common misfortune that party life destroys friendship.    OLDENDORF.    Sad to relate! In religion any educated man will tolerate the  convictions of another; but in politics we treat each other like  reprobates if there be the slightest shade of difference of opinion  between us.    BOLZ (_aside_).    Matter for our next article! (_Aloud._) \"The slightest shade of  difference of opinion between us.\" Just what I think! We must have  that in our paper! (_Entreating)_. Look! A nice little virtuous  article: \"An"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14472"],[0,"Showell's Dictionary of Birmingham (#6)"],[1," of Birmingham besieging  the place in the week after Christmas, 1643. The brick wall round the  park, nearly three miles long, but of which there are now few traces  left, was put up by Sir Lister Holte about 1750, and tradition says it  was paid for by some Staffordshire coal-masters, who, supposing that  coal lay underneath, conditioned with Sir Lister that no mines should be  sunk within [word missing--presume \"its\"] boundary. The Hall and Park  were held by the various generations of the family till the death of the  late Dowager Lady Holte. (For an accurate and interesting description of  the edifice see Davidson's \"Holtes of Aston.\") The Act authorising the  sale of the Aston estates received the royal sanction on July 10, 1817,  and the sale of the furniture and effects in the Hall was commenced by  Messrs. J. and C. Robins on September 22. The sale lasted nine days,  there being 1,144 lots, which realised L2,150; the farming stock, &c.,  being sold afterwards for L1,201. The Hall and Park was put up on April  15, 1818, and was bought by Messrs. Greenway, Greaves, and Whitehead,  bankers, of Warwick, the estate of 1,530 acres being let off by them in  suitable lots. The herd of deer, reduced to 150 head, was sold December  21. The Hall was rented by Mr. James Watt, son of _the_ James Watt, and  for many years it was closed to the public. At his death, in 1848, the  changes which had been going on all round for years begin to make  themselves seen in the shape of huge gaps in the old wall, houses  springing up fast here and there, and a street being cut through the  noble avenue of chestnut trees in 1852. By degrees, the park was reduced  to 370 acres, which, with the Hall, were offered to the town in 1850 for  the sum of L130,000; but the Town Council declined the bargain, though  less than one-half of the Park (150 acres) was sold immediately after  for more than all the money. In 1857 a \"People's Park\" Company was  started to \"Save Aston Hall\" and the few acres close round it, an  agreement being entered into for L35,000. Many of the 20s. shares were  taken up, and Her Majesty the Queen performed the opening ceremony June  15, 1858. The speculation proved a failure, as out of about L18,000  raised one-half went in repairs, alterations, losses, &c., and it would  have been lost to the town had not the Corporation bought it in  February, 1864. They gave L33,000 (L7,000 being private subscriptions),  and it was at last opened as a free park, September 22, 1864. The  picture gallery is 136ft. long, by 18ft. wide and 16ft. high. In this  and various other rooms, will be found a miscellaneous museum of  curiosities, more or less rare, including stuffed birds and animals,  ancient tapestry and furniture, &c.    ~Aston Lower Grounds,~ the most beautiful pleasure grounds in the  Midland counties, cover 31 acres, and were originally nothing more than  the kitchen and private gardens and the fish-ponds belonging to Aston  Hall, and were purchased at the sale in 1818 by the Warwick bankers, who  let them to Mr. H.G. Quilter, at the time an attempt was made to  purchase the Hall and Park \"by the people.\" Adding to its attractions  year by year, Mr. Quilter remained on the ground until 1878, when a  limited liability company was formed to take to the hotel and premises,  building an aquarium 320 feet long by 54 feet wide, an assembly-room,  220 feet long, by 91 feet wide, and otherwise catering for the comfort  of their visitors, 10,000 of whom can be now entertained and amused  under shelter, in case of wet weather. Mr. Quilter's selling price was  L45,000, taking L25,000 in shares, and L20,000 cash by instalments. The  speculation did not appear to be very successful, and the property is  now in private hands. The visitors to the Lower Grounds since 1864 have  averaged 280,000 per annum.    ~Asylum,~ in Summer Lane, was opened in July 1797, by the Guardians of  the Poor as an industrial residence and school for 250 children. It was  dismantled and closed in 1846, though the \"Beehive\" carved over the door  was allowed to remain on the ruins some years after.    ~Athenaeum~--For the \"diffusion of Literature and Science\" was  established in March, 1839, but has long been merged in the Midland  Institute. In the building called the \"Athenaeum\", top of Temple Street,  some of the early exhibitions of paintings were held.    ~Athenic Institute,~ founded in 1841, was an institute of a somewhat  similar character to the Athenaeum, though including athletics, and  existed no longer.    ~Athletic Clubs.~--The first festival of the Birmingham Athletic Club  was held in 1868. On the 1st of March, 1880, an association was  organised of many of the bicycle clubs, cricket clubs, football clubs,  and similar athletic bodies in the town and neighbourhood, under the  name of \"The Midland Counties Amateurs' Athletic Union.\"    ~Atlantic Cables.~--It would have been strange if Birmingham had not had  a hand in the making of these. For the cable laid in 1865, 16,000 miles  of copper wire, weighing 308 tons, were turned out by Messrs. Bolton and  Sons and Messrs. Wilkes and Sons. The cable itself was 2,300 (nautical)  miles in length.    ~Baby Show.~--Let Mr. Inshaw, of the \"Steam Clock,\" have the _honour_ of  being recorded as the first to introduce the Yankee notion of a \"baby  show,\" which took place at his Music Hall, May 15, 1874.    ~Bachelors.~--In 1695, bachelors over 24 had to pay a tax of 1s., if \"a  common person,\" the scale running as high as L12 10s. for a duke!  Judging from the increase of the population about that time, we doubt if  even a \"common\" bachelor paid here. The married folks had not much to  laugh at though, for they had to pay duty on every child that was born.  Funny time, those!    ~Balloons.~--A Mr. Harper was the first to scale the clouds in a balloon  from this town, January 4, 1785. He rose again on the 31, from the  Tennis Court, in Coleshill Street, and is said to have sailed a distance  of 57 miles in 80 minutes. Mr. Sadler went up from Vauxhall, October  7th, 1811, and again on October 20th, 1823. Mr. Green rose from Newhall  Hill, July 17th, 1827, and several times after.    ~Balsall Heath.~--In some ancient deeds called \"Boswell Heath.\" The land  round Mary street, known as the Balsall Heath estate, was sold in  building lots (234) in 1839, the last day's sale being August 26, and  the auctioneers, Messrs. E. & C. Robins. Edwardes-street takes its name  from the last owner of the estate, who, if he could now but glance over  the property, would be not a little astonished at the changes which have  taken place in the last forty years, for, like unto Aston, it may be  said to really form but a portion of the ever-extending town of  Birmingham. Balsall Heath, which is in the parish of King's Norton, has  now a Local Board (with its offices in Lime Grove, Moseley Road) several  Board schools, chapels, and churches, a police court, and that sure mark  of advancement, a local newspaper. One thing still wanting, however, is  a cemetery. Though an appropriate and convenient spot near Cannon Hill  Park was chosen for the last resting-place, the ratepayers, at a meeting  held July 21, 1879, decided that they could not yet afford the required  outlay of some L17,000 necessary for the purpose, notwithstanding that  the annual rateable value of the property in the neighbourhood is  something like L70,000, and increasing by three to four thousand a year.    ~Banks and Bankers.~--The Birmingham Branch Bank of England (drawing on  the parent Bank of England), is in Bennett's Hill.    The local Branch of the National Provincial Bank of England (Lim.),  Bennett's Hill, also draws on its headquarters. It commenced business  here on New Year's Day 1827.    The Birmingham Banking Company (Lim.), also in Bennett's Hill, draws on  the London and Westminster. It opened its doors Sept. 1, 1829, with a  nominal capital of L500,000, in L50 shares, L5 being paid up at  starting. An amalgamation took place in the year 1880 with the  Stourbridge and Kidderminster Bank (established in 1834) the united  company having a paid-up capital of L286,000 and a reserve of L312,000.    The Birmingham and Midland Bank (Limited) opened in Union Street, August  23, 1836, removing to New Street in 1869. London agents, the Union Bank  of London. Authorised capital, L2,400,000.    The Birmingham, Dudley, and District Banking Co. (Limited) was commenced  in Colmore Row July 1st, 1836, as the Town and District Bank, with a  capital of L500,000, in L20 shares. London agents, Barclay and Co., and  Williams and Co.    The Birmingham Joint Stock Bank (Limited) opened in Temple Row West,  Jan. 1st, 1862, with a capital of L3,000,000, in L100 shares, L10 paid.  Agents, London Joint Stock. Has branches in New Street and Great Hampton  Street.    Lloyds' Banking Co. (Limited) Colmore Row, dates from June 3rd, 1765.  when it was known as Taylor and Lloyds, their first premises being in  Dale End [hence the name of Bank Passage]. This old established firm has  incorporated during its century of existence a score of other banks, and  lately has been amalgamated with Barnetts, Hoares, and Co., of London,  the present name being Lloyd, Barnett, Bosanquet, and Co. (Limited).  There are sub-offices also in Great Hampton Street, Deritend, Five Ways  and Aston. In this and adjoining counties, Lloyds' number about 40  branch establishments.    The Worcester City and County Banking Co. (Limited), drawing on Glynn  and Co., removed from Cherry Street to their newly-built edifice in  Colmore Row, June 1, 1880.    The Union Bank of Birmingham (Limited), Waterloo Street, commenced  business with a nominal capital of L1,000,000, in L20 shares, L5 paid.  London agents, the City Bank. It has since been taken over by the  Midland Bank.    ~Banks.~--A popular Penny Bank was established in 1851, but came to  grief in 1865, closing March 16, with assets L1,608, to pay"]]]
