He has been dying gradually during the  whole period of his Initiation.  The catastrophe cannot happen twice  over.  He has only spread over a number of years the mild process of  dissolution which others endure from a brief moment to a few hours.  The  highest Adept is, in fact, dead to, and absolutely unconscious of, the  world;  he is oblivious of its pleasures, careless of its miseries, in  so far as sentimentalism goes, for the stern sense of DUTY never leaves  him blind to its very existence.  For the new ethereal senses opening to  wider spheres are to ours much in the relation of ours to the Infinitely  Little.  New desires and enjoyments, new dangers and new hindrances  arise, with new sensations and new perceptions;  and far away down in  the mist--both literally and metaphorically--is our dirty little earth  left below by those who have virtually \"gone to join the gods.\"    And from this account too, it will be perceptible how foolish it is for  people to ask the Theosophist to \"procure for them communication with  the highest Adepts.\"  It is with the utmost difficulty that one or two  can be induced, even by the throes of a world, to injure their own  progress by meddling with mundane affairs.  The ordinary reader will  say:  \"This is not god-like. This is the acme of selfishness.\" .... But  let him realize that a very high Adept, undertaking to reform the world,  would necessarily have to once more submit to Incarnation.  And is the  result of all that have gone before in that line sufficiently  encouraging to prompt a renewal of the attempt?    A deep consideration of all that we have written, will also give the  Theosophists an idea of what they demand when they ask to be put in the  way of gaining practically \"higher powers.\"  Well, there, as plainly as  words can put it, is the PATH .... can they tread it?    Nor must it be disguised that what to the ordinary mortal are unexpected  dangers, temptations and enemies also beset the way of the neophyte.  And that for no fanciful cause, but the simple reason that he is, in  fact, acquiring new senses, has yet no practice in their use, and has  never before seen the things he sees.  A man born blind suddenly endowed  with vision would not at once master the meaning of perspective, but  would, like a baby, imagine in one case, the moon to be within his  reach, and, in the other, grasp a live coal with the most reckless  confidence.    And what, it may be asked, is to recompense this abnegation of all the  pleasures of life, this cold surrender of all mundane interests, this  stretching forward to an unknown goal which seems ever more  unattainable?  For, unlike some of the anthropomorphic creeds, Occultism  offers to its votaries no eternally permanent heaven of material  pleasure, to be gained at once by one quick dash through the grave.  As  has, in fact, often been the case many would be prepared willingly to  die now for the sake of the paradise hereafter.  But Occultism gives no  such prospect of cheaply and immediately gained infinitude of pleasure,  wisdom and existence.  It only promises extensions of these, stretching  in successive arches obscured by successive veils, in an unbroken series  up the long vista which leads to NIRVANA.  And this too, qualified by  the necessity that new powers entail new responsibilities, and that the  capacity of increased pleasure entails the capacity of increased  sensibility to pain.  To this, the only answer that can be given is  two-fold:  (1st) the consciousness of Power is itself the most exquisite  of pleasures, and is unceasingly gratified in the progress onwards with  new means for its exercise and (2ndly) as has been already said--THIS is  the only road by which there is the faintest scientific likelihood that  \"Death\" can be avoided, perpetual memory secured, infinite wisdom  attained, and hence an immense helping of mankind made possible, once  that the adept has safely crossed the turning-point.  Physical as well  as metaphysical logic requires and endorses the fact that only by  gradual absorption into infinity can the Part become acquainted with the  Whole, and that that which is now something can only feel, know, and  enjoy EVERYTHING when lost in Absolute Totality in the vortex of that  Unalterable Circle wherein our Knowledge becomes Ignorance, and the  Everything itself is identified with the NOTHING.          Is the Desire to \"Live\" Selfish?      The passage \"to live, to live, to live must be the unswerving resolve,\"  occurring in the article on the Elixir of Life, is often quoted by  superficial and unsympathetic readers as an argument that the teachings  of occultism are the most concentrated form of selfishness.  In order to  determine whether the critics are right or wrong, the meaning of the  word \"selfishness\" must first be ascertained.    According to an established authority, selfishness is that \"exclusive  regard to one's own interest or happiness;  that supreme self-love or  self-preference which leads a person to direct his purposes to the  advancement of his own interest, power, or happiness, without regarding  those of others.\"    In short, an absolutely selfish individual is one who cares for himself  and none else, or, in other words, one who is so strongly imbued with a  sense of the importance of his own personality that to him it is the  crown of all thoughts, desires, and aspirations, and beyond which lies  the perfect blank.  Now, can an occultist be then said to be \"selfish\"  when he desires to live in the sense in which that word is used by the  writer of the article on the Elixir of Life?  It has been said over and  over again that the ultimate end of every aspirant after occult  knowledge is Nirvana or Mukti, when the individual, freed from all  Mayavic Upadhi, becomes one with Paramatma, or the Son identifies  himself with the Father in Christian phraseology.  For that purpose,  every veil of illusion which creates a sense of personal isolation, a  feeling of separateness from THE ALL, must be torn asunder, or, in other  words, the aspirant must gradually discard all sense of selfishness with  which we are all more or less affected.  A study of the Law of Kosmic  Evolution teaches us that the higher the evolution, the more does it  tend towards Unity.  In fact, Unity is the ultimate possibility of  Nature, and those who through vanity and selfishness go against her  purposes, cannot but incur the punishment of annihilation.  The  occultist thus recognizes that unselfishness and a feeling of universal  philanthropy are the inherent laws of our being, and all he does is to  attempt to destroy the chains of selfishness forged upon us all by Maya.  The struggle then between Good and Evil, God and Satan, Suras and  Asuras, Devas and Daityas, which is mentioned in the sacred books of all  the nations and races, symbolizes the battle between unselfish and  selfish impulses, which takes place in a man, who tries to follow the  higher purposes of Nature, until the lower animal tendencies, created by  selfishness, are completely conquered, and the enemy thoroughly routed  and annihilated.  It has also been often put forth in various  Theosophical and other occult writings that the only difference between  an ordinary man who works along with Nature during the course of Kosmic  evolution and an occultist, is that the latter, by his superior  knowledge, adopts such methods of training and discipline as will hurry  on that process of evolution, and he thus reaches in a comparatively  short time the apex which the ordinary individual will take perhaps  billions of years to reach.  In short, in a few thousand years he  approaches that type of evolution which ordinary humanity attains in the  sixth or seventh Round of the Manvantara, i.e., cyclic progression.  It  is evident that an average man cannot become a MAHATMA in one life, or  rather in one incarnation.  Now those, who have studied the occult  teachings concerning Devachan and our after-states, will remember that  between two incarnations there is a considerable period of subjective  existence.  The greater the number of such Devachanic periods, the  greater is the number of years over which this evolution is extended.  The chief aim of the occultist is therefore to so control himself as to  be able to regulate his future states, and thereby gradually shorten the  duration of his Devachanic existence between two incarnations.  In the  course of his progress, there comes a time when, between one physical  death and his next rebirth, there is no Devachan but a kind of spiritual  sleep, the shock of death, having, so to say, stunned him into a state  of unconsciousness from which he gradually recovers to find himself  reborn, to continue his purpose.  The period of this sleep may vary from  twenty-five to two hundred years, depending upon the degree of his  advancement.  But even this period may be said to be a waste of time,  and hence all his exertions are directed to shorten its duration so as  to gradually come to a point when the passage from one state of  existence into another is almost imperceptible.  This is his last  incarnation, as it were, for the shock of death no more stuns him.  This  is the idea the writer of the article on the Elixir of Life means to  convey when he says:    By or about the time when the Death-limit of his race is passed he is  actually dead, in the ordinary sense, that is to say, he has relieved  himself of all or nearly all such material particles as would have  necessitated in disruption the agony of dying.

The _nouveau_ artist-craftsman stood less chance than  anybody of getting back to the secret of noble things, having forsaken  the path of pure utility which, wherever it may go for a time, always  leads back again to beauty. The disappearance of beauty for a time need  not have been a cause of despair. Beauty will always come back if it is  left alone. People had been swept off their feet with delight at what  machinery could do, and they expected beauty to come out of it as a  product at the same pace as everything else. It was not a mistake to  expect it from any source, but from this particular source it could only  come with time. There is evidence that it is on the way. And yet though  the results of crude mechanical industrialism spoilt the outward  appearance of the whole of the Victorian age, the earlier part at least  of that time was one of marked personal refinement. We have but to look  at portraits by George Richmond and others to receive a great impression  of distinction. And this fact enables us to throw into clearer light the  exact nature of du Maurier's work. If we seek for evidence in the old  volumes of _Punch_ for the distinction of the early Victorians we shall  not find it. We shall merely conceive instead a dislike for the type of  gentleman of the time. Leech and his contemporaries did nothing more for  their age than to make it look ridiculous for ever. But du Maurier gives  us a real impression of the Society in which he moved. His ability to  satirise society while still leaving it its dignity is unique. It may be  said to be his distinctive contribution to the art of graphic satire.  It gave to the Anglo-Saxon school its present-day characteristic,  putting upon one of the very lightest forms of art the stamp of a noble  time. The point is that whilst du Maurier thus deferred to the dignity  of human nature he remained a satirist, not a humorist merely, as was  Keene.    [Illustration]          II    THE ART OF DU MAURIER    Section 1      If we wish to estimate the art of du Maurier at its full worth we must  try and imagine _Punch_ from 1863 without this art, and try for a moment  to conceive the difference this absence would make to our own present  knowledge of the Victorians; also to the picture always entertained of  England abroad.    If we are to believe du Maurier's art England is a petticoat-governed  country. The men in his pictures are often made to recede into the  background of Victorian ornament merely as ornaments themselves. As for  the women, the mask of manner, the pleasantness concealing every shade  of uncharitableness, all the arts of the contention for social  precedence--in the interpretation of this sort of thing du Maurier is  often quite uncanny, but he is never ruthless.    We have noticed that when du Maurier tried to draw ugly people he often  only succeeded in turning out a figure of fun. Not to be beautiful and  charming is to fail of being human, seems the judgment of his pencil.  This was his limitation. And another was that, whilst professing to be  concerned with humanity as a whole, he nearly always broke down with  types that outraged the polite standard. He was a master in the  description of Bishops and Curates, Generals and Men-about-town, but he  broke down when he came to \"the out-sider.\" And, as we have already  pointed out, he seldom got away from types to individuals.    In the last respect, however, we gain more perhaps than we lose. We gain  a very vivid impression of the whole tone of the society in his time.  And the fact of his art passing over the individual, for ever prevented  it from cruelty, for to be cruel the individual must be hit. He did not  satirise humanity, but Society. And his criticism was not of its  members, but of its ways. Except in the case of children, he left  unrevealed the individual heart that Keene so sympathetically exposed.    He made an original--and who will deny it?--a unique contribution to  the history of satire, when he went to work through literalness and care  for beauty in a field where nearly all previous success had rested with  a sort of ruffianism. But chiefly one praises Heaven for the nurseryful  of delightful children he let loose in his pages against the army of  little monsters who reign as children in the Comic Press, bearing  witness as they do to the unpleasant kind of mind even an artist can  possess.    Though he ridiculed \"Camelot,\" his own tradition, as we have shown, was  received from the Arthurian source. His chivalry gave his satire a very  delicate edge. It was infinitely more cutting in showing the misfit of  vulgarity with beauty than in showing vulgarity alone.    But du Maurier's gentlemanliness narrowed his range. It forced him into  putting down something preposterous instead of a true type as soon as he  wished to create \"a bounder.\" He found it impossible to get inside of a  \"bounder\"--to be for the time a \"bounder\" himself. It is necessary for  an artist to be able to be every character that he would create. And  perhaps a satirist never wounds others so much as when he most wounds  himself. Thackeray succeeded with snobbery because he had enough of it  to go on with himself. We have shown the success of du Maurier with the  aesthetes to go upon similar lines. The soul of satire is very often the  bitterness of confession. In his very style the satirist of the aesthetes  stood confessed almost as one of their number, whether he wished this to  be seen or not--at least as one of the romantic school from whom they  immediately descended. But he was genuine; where Postlethwaite and  Maudle posed, his irritation was with the pose, the pretended  preoccupation with beauty. He genuinely admired the Florentine revival,  and to admire is to be jealous of those who take in vain. He wished to  show up the \"aesthetes\" as the parasites they were, trading socially upon  an inspiration too fragrant to be traded with at all.    Du Maurier, who assuredly knew what elegance was as well as any man of  his time, took a great delight in pointing out to all whom it might  concern, by illustration, that if there was any beauty of representation  possible to him, as an artist, in depicting modern society, it was not  in anything put forward in the shape of costume by the ladies of the  aesthetic movement, but in the unacknowledged genius of ordinary  dressmakers.    It was in his time that Philistinism met its match in Oscar Wilde, and  for the first time in its history felt its self-complacency shaken. Up  to that time it had been very proud of itself. With the loss of that  pride it blundered, and it remained for du Maurier to show that the  height of Philistinism in a Philistine is to pretend not to be a  Philistine.    He had always seen what it would do present-day Londoners a world of  good to see as clearly, that it is just those who affect, and who, by  their lack of artistic constitution, are incapable of doing more than  merely affecting, the understanding of art, who are the worst enemies it  has in the world. He preferred the open Philistine. And so do we. The  affectation described lends to art an artificial support which betrays  those who attempt to rest any scheme for the promotion of art upon it.    But though du Maurier was not a Philistine he had the genius of  respectability. His pencil could get on well with Bishops. It is easy  enough to put a model into a Bishop's apron and gaiters, but that does  not secure the drawing of a Bishop. It is necessary to observe that du  Maurier found definite lines with his pencil for something so abstract  as Broad-Churchmanship. The High-Churchman, with his perilous  inclination to fervour, he was afraid of as a disturbing element, and  kept him out of his drawings.    [Illustration]      Section 2    We have noted that it was du Maurier's peculiar genius to respond to  \"attainment\" in life, even as the Greeks did, rather than to life's  pathetic and romantic struggle. Du Maurier, we believe, was of opinion  that if circumstances--he probably meant Editorial ones--had determined  that he should apply his art to the lower classes he would have  succeeded as well there as he did with Society. We prefer to believe  that the Editorial instinct in the direction it gave to his work knew  better. Many opportunities were afforded him for being as democratic in  spirit as he liked, but he left such opportunities alone. His  cab-runners run about in rain-shrunken suits that were obviously made in  Savile Row; everyone of them, they are broken-down gentlemen. Coachmen,  gardeners, footmen, pages, housekeepers, cooks, ladies' maids, and all  those who move in the domestic circle of the upper classes he could  draw, but his taste in life is a marked one, and that means it is a  limited one. It is as marked as Meredith's, and it is much of the same  kind; like that writer's great lady, Mrs. Mountstuart Jenkinson, he  preferred persons \"that shone in the sun.\" This had nothing whatever to  do with qualities of the heart; it was all an aesthetic predilection. The  moment his pencil touched the theme of life lived upon as gentle a plane  as possible, then something was kindled at its point which betrayed the  presence of genuine inspiration. The inspiration was of the same nature  as Watteau's, the grace of a certain aspect of life making an aesthetic  appeal. Let this attraction to what is gracious in appearance, however,  be kept distinct from the effect made by the spectacle of wealth upon  the snob. Those who show us the beauty in the world, enrich the world  with that much of beauty.    [Illustration: Pencil Studies from the Artist's Sketch Book]    In his _Life and Letters of Charles Keene_, Mr. G.S. Layard[1] says  this:--    \"That Keene could have drawn the lovely be-Worthed young ladies and the  splendidly proportioned and frock-coated young men with which Mr. du  Maurier delights us week by week, not to speak "]]]
