The native district of Bombay is not so dirty nor so densely  populated as in most other Indian cities. The streets are wider and  some of them will admit of a carriage, although the cross-streets  are nearly all too narrow. The houses are from three to five  stories in height, built of brick or stone, with overhanging  balconies and broad eaves. Sometimes the entire front and rear  are of lattice work, the side walls being solid. Few of them are  plastered, ceilings are unknown and partitions, for the sake of  promoting circulation, seldom go more than half way to the top of  a room. No glass is used, but every window has heavy blinds as a  protection from the hot air and the rays of the sun. While our  taste does not approve the arrangements in many cases, experience  has taught the people of India how to live through the hot summers  with the greatest degree of comfort, and anyone who attempts  to introduce innovations is apt to make mistakes. The fronts  of many of the houses are handsomely carved and decorated, the  columns and pillars and brackets which support the balconies,  the railings, the door frames, the eaves and architraves, are  often beautiful examples of the carvers' skill, and the exterior  walls are usually painted in gay colors and fanciful designs.  Within doors the houses look very bare to us, and contain few  comforts.    The lower floor of the house is commonly used for a shop, and  different lines of business are classified and gathered in the  same neighborhood. The food market, the grocery and provision  dealers, the dealers in cotton goods and other fabrics, the silk  merchants, the shoe and leather men, the workers in copper and  brass, the goldsmiths, jewelers and dealers in precious stones  each have their street or quarter, which is a great convenience  to purchasers, and scattered among them are frequent cook-shops  and eating places, which do not resemble our restaurants in any  way, but have a large patronage. A considerable portion of the  population of Bombay, and the same is true of all other Indian  cities, depends upon these cook-shops for food as a measure of  economy and convenience. People can send out for dinner, lunch,  or breakfast at any hour, and have it served by their own servants  without being troubled to keep up a kitchen or buy fuel.    There are said to be 6,000 dealers in jewelry and precious stones  in the city of Bombay, and they all seem to be doing a flourishing  business, chiefly with the natives, who are very fond of display  and invest their money in precious stones and personal adornments  of gold and silver, which are safer and give more satisfaction  than banks.    You can see specimens of every race and nation in the native  city, nearly always in their own distinctive costumes, and they  are the source of never-ending interest--Arabs, Persians, Afghans,  Rajputs, Parsees, Chinese, Japanese, Malays, Lascars, Negroes  from Zanzibar, Madagascar and the Congo, Abyssinians. Nubians,  Sikhs, Thibetans, Burmese, Singalese, Siamese and Bengalis mingle  with Jews, Greeks and Europeans on common terms, and, unlike the  population of most eastern cities, the people of Bombay always  seem to be busy.    Many enterprises usually left for the municipal authorities of a  city to carry on cannot be undertaken by the government of India  because of the laws of caste, religious customs and fanatical  prejudices of the people. The Hindu allows no man to enter his  home; the women of a Mohammedan household are kept in seclusion,  the teachings of the priests are contrary to modern sanitary  regulations, and if the municipal authorities should condemn  a block of buildings and tear it down, or discover a nuisance  and attempt to remove it, they might easily provoke a riot and  perhaps a revolution. This has happened frequently. During the  last plague a public tumult had to be quelled by soldiers at a  large cost of life because of the efforts of the government to  isolate and quarantine infected persons and houses. These peculiar  conditions suggested in Bombay the advantage of a semi-public body  called \"The Improvement Trust,\" which was organized a few years  ago by Lord Sandhurst, then governor. The original object was to  clear out the slums and infected places after the last plague,  to tear down blocks of rotten and filthy tenement-houses and erect  new buildings on the ground; to widen the streets, to let air and  light into moldering, festering sink holes of poverty, vice and  wretchedness; to lay sewers and furnish a water supply, and to  redeem and regenerate certain portions of the city that were a  menace to the public health and morals. This work was intrusted  to twelve eminent citizens, representing each of the races and  all of the large interests in Bombay, who commanded the respect  and enjoyed the confidence of the fanatical element of the people,  and would be permitted to do many things and introduce innovations  that would not be tolerated if suggested by foreigners, or the  government.    After the special duty which they were organized to perform had  been accomplished The Improvement Trust was made permanent as a  useful agency to undertake works of public utility of a similar  character which the government could not carry on. The twelve  trustees serve without pay or allowances; not one of them receives  a penny of compensation for his time or trouble, or even the  reimbursement of incidental expenses made necessary in the  performance of his duties. This is an exhibition of unusual  patriotism, but it is considered perfectly natural in Bombay. To  carry out the plans of the Trust, salaried officials are employed,  and a large force is necessary. The trustees have assumed great  responsibilities, and supply the place of a board of public works,  with larger powers than are usually granted to such officials.  The municipality has turned over to them large tracts of real  estate, some of which has been improved with great profit; it has  secured funds by borrowing from banks upon the personal credit  of its members, and by issuing bonds which sell at a high premium,  and the money has been used in the improvement of the city, in  the introduction of sanitary reforms, in building model tenements  for the poor, in creating institutions of public necessity or  advantage and by serving the people in various other ways.    The street car system of Bombay belongs to an American company,  having been organized by a Mr. Kittridge, who came over here as  consul during President Lincoln's administration. Recognizing  the advantage of street cars, in 1874 he interested some American  capitalists in the enterprise, got a franchise, laid rails on  a few of the principal streets and has been running horse cars  ever since.    The introduction of electricity and the extension of the street  railway system is imperatively needed. Distances are very great  in the foreign section, and during the hot months, from March  to November, it is impossible for white men to walk in the sun,  so that everybody is compelled to keep or hire a carriage; while  on the other hand the density of the population in other sections  is so great as to be a continual and increasing public peril.  Bombay has more than 800,000 inhabitants, two-thirds of whom are  packed into very narrow limits, and in the native quarters it  is estimated that there is one human being to every ten square  yards of space. It will be realized that this is a dangerous  condition of affairs for a city that is constantly afflicted  with epidemics and in which contagious diseases always prevail.  The extension of the street car service would do something to  relieve this congestion and scatter many of the people out among  the suburbs, but the Orientals always swarm together and pack  themselves away in most uncomfortable and unhealthful limits,  and it will always be a great danger when the plagues or the  cholera come around. Multitudes have no homes at all. They have  no property except the one or two strips of dirty cotton which  the police require them to wear for clothing. They lie down to  sleep anywhere, in the parks, on the sidewalks, in hallways,  and drawing their robes over their faces are utterly indifferent  to what happens. They get their meals at the cook shops for a  few farthings, eat when they are hungry, sleep when they are  sleepy and go through life without a fixed abode.    In addition to the street car company the United States is  represented by the Standard Oil Company, the Vacuum Oil Company,  and the New York Export and Import Company. Other American firms  of merchants and manufacturers have resident agents, but they  are mostly Englishmen or Germans.    There is, however, very little demand in India for agricultural  implements, although three-fourths of the people are employed in  tilling the soil. Each farmer owns or rents a very small piece  of ground, hardly big enough to justify the use of anything but  the simple, primitive tools that have been handed down to him  through long lines of ancestors for 3,000 years. Nearly all his  implements are home-made, or come from the village blacksmith  shop, and are of the rudest, most awkward description. They plow  with a crooked stick, they dig ditches with their fingers, and  carry everything that has to be moved in little baskets on their  heads. The harvesting is done with a primitive-looking sickle,  and root crops are taken out of the ground with a two-tined fork  with a handle only a foot long. The Hindu does everything in a  squatting posture, hence he uses only short-handled tools. Fifty  or seventy-five cents each would easily replace the outfit of  three-fourths of the farmers in the empire. Occasionally there  is a rajah with large estates under cultivation upon which modern"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11224"],[0,"Utilitarianism (#6)"],[1," *       *       *       *       *    It may not be superfluous to notice a few more of the common  misapprehensions of utilitarian ethics, even those which are so obvious  and gross that it might appear impossible for any person of candour and  intelligence to fall into them: since persons, even of considerable  mental endowments, often give themselves so little trouble to understand  the bearings of any opinion against which they entertain a prejudice,  and men are in general so little conscious of this voluntary ignorance  as a defect, that the vulgarest misunderstandings of ethical doctrines  are continually met with in the deliberate writings of persons of the  greatest pretensions both to high principle and to philosophy. We not  uncommonly hear the doctrine of utility inveighed against as a _godless_  doctrine. If it be necessary to say anything at all against so mere an  assumption, we may say that the question depends upon what idea we have  formed of the moral character of the Deity. If it be a true belief that  God desires, above all things, the happiness of his creatures, and that  this was his purpose in their creation, utility is not only not a  godless doctrine, but more profoundly religious than any other. If it be  meant that utilitarianism does not recognise the revealed will of God as  the supreme law of morals, I answer, that an utilitarian who believes in  the perfect goodness and wisdom of God, necessarily believes that  whatever God has thought fit to reveal on the subject of morals, must  fulfil the requirements of utility in a supreme degree. But others  besides utilitarians have been of opinion that the Christian revelation  was intended, and is fitted, to inform the hearts and minds of mankind  with a spirit which should enable them to find for themselves what is  right, and incline them to do it when found, rather than to tell them,  except in a very general way, what it is: and that we need a doctrine of  ethics, carefully followed out, to _interpret_ to us the will of God.  Whether this opinion is correct or not, it is superfluous here to  discuss; since whatever aid religion, either natural or revealed, can  afford to ethical investigation, is as open to the utilitarian moralist  as to any other. He can use it as the testimony of God to the usefulness  or hurtfulness of any given course of action, by as good a right as  others can use it for the indication of a transcendental law, having no  connexion with usefulness or with happiness.    Again, Utility is often summarily stigmatized as an immoral doctrine by  giving it the name of Expediency, and taking advantage of the popular  use of that term to contrast it with Principle. But the Expedient, in  the sense in which it is opposed to the Right, generally means that  which is expedient for the particular interest of the agent himself: as  when a minister sacrifices the interest of his country to keep himself  in place. When it means anything better than this, it means that which  is expedient for some immediate object, some temporary purpose, but  which violates a rule whose observance is expedient in a much higher  degree. The Expedient, in this sense, instead of being the same thing  with the useful, is a branch of the hurtful. Thus, it would often be  expedient, for the purpose of getting over some momentary embarrassment,  or attaining some object immediately useful to ourselves or others, to  tell a lie. But inasmuch as the cultivation in ourselves of a sensitive  feeling on the subject of veracity, is one of the most useful, and the  enfeeblement of that feeling one of the most hurtful, things to which  our conduct can be instrumental; and inasmuch as any, even  unintentional, deviation from truth, does that much towards weakening  the trustworthiness of human assertion, which is not only the principal  support of all present social well-being, but the insufficiency of which  does more than any one thing that can be named to keep back  civilisation, virtue, everything on which human happiness on the largest  scale depends; we feel that the violation, for a present advantage, of a  rule of such transcendent expediency, is not expedient, and that he who,  for the sake of a convenience to himself or to some other individual,  does what depends on him to deprive mankind of the good, and inflict  upon them the evil, involved in the greater or less reliance which they  can place in each other's word, acts the part of one of their worst  enemies. Yet that even this rule, sacred as it is, admits of possible  exceptions, is acknowledged by all moralists; the chief of which is when  the withholding of some fact (as of information from a male-factor, or  of bad news from a person dangerously ill) would preserve some one  (especially a person other than oneself) from great and unmerited evil,  and when the withholding can only be effected by denial. But in order  that the exception may not extend itself beyond the need, and may have  the least possible effect in weakening reliance on veracity, it ought to  be recognized, and, if possible, its limits defined; and if the  principle of utility is good for anything, it must be good for weighing  these conflicting utilities against one another, and marking out the  region within which one or the other preponderates.    Again, defenders of utility often find themselves called upon to reply  to such objections as this--that there is not time, previous to action,  for calculating and weighing the effects of any line of conduct on the  general happiness. This is exactly as if any one were to say that it is  impossible to guide our conduct by Christianity, because there is not  time, on every occasion on which anything has to be done, to read  through the Old and New Testaments. The answer to the objection is, that  there has been ample time, namely, the whole past duration of the human  species. During all that time mankind have been learning by experience  the tendencies of actions; on which experience all the prudence, as well  as all the morality of life, is dependent. People talk as if the  commencement of this course of experience had hitherto been put off, and  as if, at the moment when some man feels tempted to meddle with the  property or life of another, he had to begin considering for the first  time whether murder and theft are injurious to human happiness. Even  then I do not think that he would find the question very puzzling; but,  at all events, the matter is now done to his hand. It is truly a  whimsical supposition, that if mankind were agreed in considering  utility to be the test of morality, they would remain without any  agreement as to what is useful, and would take no measures for having  their notions on the subject taught to the young, and enforced by law  and opinion. There is no difficulty in proving any ethical standard  whatever to work ill, if we suppose universal idiocy to be conjoined  with it, but on any hypothesis short of that, mankind must by this time  have acquired positive beliefs as to the effects of some actions on  their happiness; and the beliefs which have thus come down are the rules  of morality for the multitude, and for the philosopher until he has  succeeded in finding better. That philosophers might easily do this,  even now, on many subjects; that the received code of ethics is by no  means of divine right; and that mankind have still much to learn as to  the effects of actions on the general happiness, I admit, or rather,  earnestly maintain. The corollaries from the principle of utility, like  the precepts of every practical art, admit of indefinite improvement,  and, in a progressive state of the human mind, their improvement is  perpetually going on. But to consider the rules of morality as  improvable, is one thing; to pass over the intermediate generalizations  entirely, and endeavour to test each individual action directly by the  first principle, is another. It is a strange notion that the  acknowledgment of a first principle is inconsistent with the admission  of secondary ones. To inform a traveller respecting the place of his  ultimate destination, is not to forbid the use of landmarks and  direction-posts on the way. The proposition that happiness is the end  and aim of morality, does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to  that goal, or that persons going thither should not be advised to take  one direction rather than another. Men really ought to leave off talking  a kind of nonsense on this subject, which they would neither talk nor  listen to on other matters of practical concernment. Nobody argues that  the art of navigation is not founded on astronomy, because sailors  cannot wait to calculate the Nautical Almanack. Being rational  creatures, they go to sea with it ready calculated; and all rational  creatures go out upon the sea of life with their minds made up on the  common questions of right and wrong, as well as on many of the far more  difficult questions of wise and foolish. And this, as long as foresight  is a human quality, it is to be presumed they will continue to do.  Whatever we adopt as the fundamental principle of morality, we require  subordinate principles to apply it by: the impossibility of doing  without them, being common to all systems, can afford no argument  against any one in particular: but gravely to argue as if no such  secondary principles could be had, and as if mankind had remained till  now, and always must remain, without drawing any general conclusions  from the experience of human life, is as high a pitch, I think, as  absurdity has ever reached in philosophical controversy.    The remainder of the stock arguments against utilitarianism mostly  consist in laying to its charge the common infirmities of human nature,  and the general difficulties which embarrass conscientious persons in  shaping their course through life. We are told that an utilitarian will  be apt to make his own"]]]
