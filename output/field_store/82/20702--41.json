But after that he  was rejected, whether it was a question of the _Fifre_ or of the  _Dejeuner sur l'herbe._ This canvas, with an admirable feminine nude,  created a scandal, because an undressed woman figured in it amidst  clothed figures, a matter of frequent occurrence with the masters of the  Renaissance. The landscape is not painted in the open air, but in the  studio, and resembles a tapestry, but it shows already the most  brilliant evidence of Manet's talent in the study of the nude and the  still-life of the foreground, which is the work of a powerful master.  From the time of this canvas the artist's personality appeared in all  its maturity. He painted it before he was thirty, and it has the air of  an old master's work; it is based upon Hals and the Spaniards together.    The reputation of Manet became established after 1865. Furious critics  were opposed by enthusiastic admirers. Baudelaire upheld Manet, as he  had upheld Delacroix and Wagner, with his great clairvoyance,  sympathetic to all real originality. The _Olympia_ brought the  discussion to a head. This courtesan lying in bed undressed, with a  negress carrying a bouquet, and a black cat, made a tremendous stir. It  is a powerful work of strong colour, broad design and intense sentiment,  astounding in its _parti-pris_ of reducing the values to the greatest  simplicity. One can feel in it the artist's preoccupation with  rediscovering the rude frankness of Hals and Goya, and his aversion  against the prettiness and false nobility of the school. This famous  _Olympia_ which occasioned so much fury, appears to us to-day as a  transition work. It is neither a masterpiece, nor an emotional work, but  a technical experiment, very significant for the epoch during which it  appeared in French art, and this canvas, which is very inferior to  Manet's fine works, may well be considered as a date of evolution. He  was doubtful about exhibiting it, but Baudelaire decided him and wrote  to him on this occasion these typical remarks: \"You complain about  attacks? But are you the first to endure them? Have you more genius than  Chateaubriand and Wagner? They were not killed by derision. And, in  order not to make you too proud, I must tell you, that they are models  each in his own way and in a very rich world, whilst you are only the  first in the decrepitude of your art.\"    [Illustration: MANET    OLYMPIA]    Thus it must be firmly established that from this moment Manet passed as  an innovator, years before Impressionism existed or was even thought of.  This is an important point: it will help to clear up the twofold origin  of the movement which followed. To his realism, to his return to  composition in the modern spirit, and to the simplifying of planes and  values, Manet owed these attacks, though at that time his colour was  still sombre and entirely influenced by Hals, Goya and Courbet. From  that time the artist became a chief. As his friends used to meet him at  an obscure Batignolles cafe, the cafe Guerbois (still existing), public  derision baptized these meetings with the name of \"L'Ecole des  Batignolles.\" Manet then exhibited the _Angels at the Tomb of Christ_, a  souvenir of the Venetians; _Lola de Valence_, commented upon by  Baudelaire in a quatrain which can be found in the _Fleurs du Mal_; the  _Episode d'un combat de taureaux_ (dissatisfied with this picture, he  cut out the dead toreador in the foreground, and burnt the rest). The  _Acteur tragique_ (portrait of Rouviere in Hamlet) and the _Jesus  insulte_ followed, and then came the _Gitanos_, _L'Enfant a l'Epee_, and  the portrait of Mme. Manet. This series of works is admirable. It is  here where he reveals himself as a splendid colourist, whose design is  as vigorous as the technique is masterly. In these works one does not  think of looking for anything but the witchery of technical strength;  and the abundant wealth of his temperament is simply dazzling. Manet  reveals himself as the direct heir of the great Spaniards, more  interesting, more spontaneous, and freer than Courbet. The _Rouviere_ is  as fine a symphony in grey and black as the noblest portraits by  Bronzino, and there is probably no Goya more powerful than the _Toreador  tue_. Manet's altogether classic descent appears here undeniably. There  is no question yet of Impressionism, and yet Monet and Renoir are  already painting, Monet has exhibited at the _Salon des Refuses_, but  criticism sees and attacks nobody but Manet. This great individuality  who overwhelmed the Academy with its weak allegories, was the butt of  great insults and the object of great admiration. Banished from the  Salons, he collected fifty pictures in a room in the Avenue de l'Alma  and invited the public thither. In 1868 appeared the portrait of Emile  Zola, in 1860 the _Dejeuner_, works which are so powerful, that they  enforced admiration in spite of all hostility. In the Salon of 1870 was  shown the portrait of Eva Gonzales, the charming pastellist and pupil of  Manet, and the impressive _Execution of Maximilian at Queretaro_. Manet  was at the apogee of his talent, when the Franco-German war broke out.  At the age of thirty-eight he had put forth a considerable amount of  work, tried himself in all styles, severed his individuality from the  slavish admiration of the old masters, and attained his own mastery. And  now he wanted to expand, and, in joining Monet, Renoir and Degas,  interpret in his own way the Impressionist theory.    [Illustration: MANET    THE WOMAN WITH THE PARROT]    The _Fight of the Kearsage and the Alabama_, a magnificent sea-piece,  bathed in sunlight, announced this transformation in his work, as did  also a study, a _Garden_, painted, I believe, in 1870, but exhibited  only after the crisis of the terrible year. At that time the Durand-Ruel  Gallery bought a considerable series by the innovator, and was imitated  by some select art-lovers. The _Musique aux Tuileries_ and the _Bal de  l'Opera_ had, some years before, pointed towards the evolution of this  great artist in the direction of _plein-air_ painting. The _Bon Bock_,  in which the very soul of Hals is revived, and the grave _Liseur_, sold  immediately at Vienne, were the two last pledges given by the artist to  his old admirers; these two pictures had moreover a splendid success,  and the _Bon Bock_, popularised by an engraving, was hailed by the very  men who had most unjustly attacked the author of the portrait of Mme.  Morisot, a French masterpiece. But already Manet was attracted  irresistibly towards the study of light, and, faithful to his programme,  he prepared to face once again outbursts of anger and further sarcasms;  he was resolved once again to offer battle to the Salons. Followed by  all the Impressionists he tried to make them understand the necessity  of introducing the new ideas into this retrograde _Milieu_. But they  would not. Having already received a rebuff by the attacks directed for  some years against their works, they exhibited among themselves in some  private galleries: they declined to force the gate of the Salons, and  Manet remained alone. In 1875 he submitted, with his _Argenteuil_, the  most perfect epitome of his atmospheric researches. The jury admitted it  in spite of loud protests: they were afraid of Manet; they admired his  power of transformation, and he revolted the prejudiced, attracting them  at the same time by the charm of his force. But in 1876 the portrait of  _Desboutin_ and the _Linge_ (an exquisite picture,--one of the best  productions of open-air study) were rejected. Manet then recommenced the  experience of 1867, and opened his studio to the public. A register at  the door was soon covered with signatures protesting against the jury,  as well as with hostile jokes, and even anonymous insults! In 1877 the  defeated jury admitted the portrait of the famous singer Faure in the  part of Hamlet, and rejected _Nana_, a picture which was found  scandalising, but has charming freshness and an intensely modern  character. In 1878, 1879 and 1880 they accepted _la Serre_, the  surprising symphony in blue and white which shows Mr George Moore in  boating costume, the portrait of Antonin Proust, and the scene at the  _Pere Lathuile_ restaurant, in which Manet's nervous and luminous  realism has so curious a resemblance to the art of the Goncourts. In  1881 the portrait of Rochefort and that of the lion-killer, Pertuiset,  procured the artist a medal at the Salon, and Antonin Proust, the friend  of Manet's childhood, who had become Minister of Fine Arts, honoured  himself in decorating him with the legion of honour. In 1882 appeared a  magnificent canvas, the _Bar des Folies-Bergere_, in which there is some  sparkling still-life painting of most attractive beauty. It was  accompanied by a lady's portrait, _Jeanne_. But on April 30, 1883, Manet  died, exhausted by his work and struggles, of locomotor ataxy, after  having vainly undergone the amputation of a foot to avoid gangrene.    [Illustration: MANET    THE BAR AT THE FOLIES-BERGERE]    It will be seen that Manet fought through all his life: few artists'  lives have been nobler. His has been an example of untiring energy; he  employed it as much in working, as in making a stand against prejudices.  Rejected, accepted, rejected again, he delivered with enormous courage  and faith his attack upon a jury which represented routine. As he fought  in front of his easel, he still fought before the public, without ever  relaxing, without changing, alone, apart even from those whom he loved,  who had been shaped by his example.

This Essex and yonder Surrey are as different as Russia and Germany. But  for one American who comes to look at Essex, twenty go to Godalming and  Guildford and Dorking and Lewes and Canterbury. Those Surrey people are  not properly English at all. They are strenuous. You have to get on or  get out. They drill their gardeners, lecture very fast on agricultural  efficiency, and have miniature rifle ranges in every village. It's a  county of new notice-boards and barbed-wire fences; there's always a  policeman round the corner. They dress for dinner. They dress for  everything. If a man gets up in the night to look for a burglar he puts  on the correct costume--or doesn't go. They've got a special scientific  system for urging on their tramps. And they lock up their churches on a  week-day. Half their soil is hard chalk or a rationalistic sand, only  suitable for bunkers and villa foundations. And they play golf in a  large, expensive, thorough way because it's the thing to do.... Now here  in Essex we're as lax as the eighteenth century. We hunt in any old  clothes. Our soil is a rich succulent clay; it becomes semi-fluid in  winter--when we go about in waders shooting duck. All our fingerposts  have been twisted round by facetious men years ago. And we pool our  breeds of hens and pigs. Our roses and oaks are wonderful; that alone  shows that this is the real England. If I wanted to play golf--which I  don't, being a decent Essex man--I should have to motor ten miles into  Hertfordshire. And for rheumatics and longevity Surrey can't touch us. I  want you to be clear on these points, because they really will affect  your impressions of this place.... This country is a part of the real  England--England outside London and outside manufactures. It's one with  Wessex and Mercia or old Yorkshire--or for the matter of that with Meath  or Lothian. And it's the essential England still....\"      Section 11    It detracted a little from Mr. Direck's appreciation of this flow of  information that it was taking them away from the rest of the company.  He wanted to see more of his new-found cousin, and what the baby and the  Bengali gentleman--whom manifestly one mustn't call \"coloured\"--and the  large-nosed lady and all the other inexplicables would get up to.  Instead of which Mr. Britling was leading him off alone with an air of  showing him round the premises, and talking too rapidly and variously  for a question to be got in edgeways, much less any broaching of the  matter that Mr. Direck had come over to settle.    There was quite a lot of rose garden, it made the air delicious, and it  was full of great tumbling bushes of roses and of neglected standards,  and it had a long pergola of creepers and trailers and a great arbour,  and underneath over the beds everywhere, contrary to all the rules, the  blossom of a multitude of pansies and stock and little trailing plants  swarmed and crowded and scrimmaged and drilled and fought great massed  attacks. And then Mr. Britling talked their way round a red-walled  vegetable garden with an abundance of fruit trees, and through a door  into a terraced square that had once been a farmyard, outside the  converted barn. The barn doors had been replaced by a door-pierced  window of glass, and in the middle of the square space a deep tank had  been made, full of rainwater, in which Mr. Britling remarked casually  that \"everybody\" bathed when the weather was hot. Thyme and rosemary and  suchlike sweet-scented things grew on the terrace about the tank, and  ten trimmed little trees of _Arbor vitae_ stood sentinel. Mr. Direck was  tantalisingly aware that beyond some lilac bushes were his new-found  cousin and the kindred young woman in blue playing tennis with the  Indian and another young man, while whenever it was necessary the  large-nosed lady crossed the stage and brooded soothingly over the  perambulator. And Mr. Britling, choosing a seat from which Mr. Direck  just couldn't look comfortably through the green branches at the flying  glimpses of pink and blue and white and brown, continued to talk about  England and America in relation to each other and everything else under  the sun.    Presently through a distant gate the two small boys were momentarily  visible wheeling small but serviceable bicycles, followed after a little  interval by the German tutor. Then an enormous grey cat came slowly  across the garden court, and sat down to listen respectfully to Mr.  Britling. The afternoon sky was an intense blue, with little puff-balls  of cloud lined out across it.    Occasionally, from chance remarks of Mr. Britling's, Mr. Direck was led  to infer that his first impressions as an American visitor were being  related to his host, but as a matter of fact he was permitted to relate  nothing; Mr. Britling did all the talking. He sat beside his guest and  spirted and played ideas and reflections like a happy fountain in the  sunshine.    Mr. Direck sat comfortably, and smoked with quiet appreciation the one  after-lunch cigar he allowed himself. At any rate, if he himself felt  rather word-bound, the fountain was nimble and entertaining. He listened  in a general sort of way to the talk, it was quite impossible to follow  it thoughtfully throughout all its chinks and turnings, while his eyes  wandered about the garden and went ever and again to the flitting  tennis-players beyond the green. It was all very gay and comfortable and  complete; it was various and delightful without being in the least  _opulent_; that was one of the little secrets America had to learn. It  didn't look as though it had been made or bought or cost anything, it  looked as though it had happened rather luckily....    Mr. Britling's talk became like a wide stream flowing through Mr.  Direck's mind, bearing along momentary impressions and observations,  drifting memories of all the crowded English sights and sounds of the  last five days, filmy imaginations about ancestral names and pretty  cousins, scraps of those prepared conversational openings on Mr.  Britling's standing in America, the explanation about the lecture club,  the still incompletely forgotten purport of the Robinson anecdote....    \"Nobody planned the British estate system, nobody planned the British  aristocratic system, nobody planned the confounded constitution, it came  about, it was like layer after layer wrapping round an agate, but you  see it came about so happily in a way, it so suited the climate and the  temperament of our people and our island, it was on the whole so cosy,  that our people settled down into it, you can't help settling down into  it, they had already settled down by the days of Queen Anne, and Heaven  knows if we shall ever really get away again. We're like that little  shell the _Lingula_, that is found in the oldest rocks and lives to-day:  it fitted its easy conditions, and it has never modified since. Why  should it? It excretes all its disturbing forces. Our younger sons go  away and found colonial empires. Our surplus cottage children emigrate  to Australia and Canada or migrate into the towns. It doesn't alter  _this_....\"      Section 12    Mr. Direck's eye had come to rest upon the barn, and its expression  changed slowly from lazy appreciation to a brightening intelligence.  Suddenly he resolved to say something. He resolved to say it so firmly  that he determined to say it even if Mr. Britling went on talking all  the time.    \"I suppose, Mr. Britling,\" he said, \"this barn here dates from the days  of Queen Anne.\"    \"The walls of the yard here are probably earlier: probably monastic.  That grey patch in the corner, for example. The barn itself is  Georgian.\"    \"And here it is still. And this farmyard, here it is still.\"    Mr. Britling was for flying off again, but Mr. Direck would not listen;  he held on like a man who keeps his grip on a lasso.    \"There's one thing I would like to remark about your barn, Mr. Britling,  and I might, while I am at it, say the same thing about your farmyard.\"    Mr. Britling was held. \"What's that?\" he asked.    \"Well,\" said Mr. Direck, \"the point that strikes me most about all this  is that that barn isn't a barn any longer, and that this farmyard isn't  a farmyard. There isn't any wheat or chaff or anything of that sort in  the barn, and there never will be again: there's just a pianola and a  dancing floor, and if a cow came into this farmyard everybody in the  place would be shooing it out again. They'd regard it as a most  unnatural object.\"    He had a pleasant sense of talking at last. He kept right on. He was  moved to a sweeping generalisation.    \"You were so good as to ask me, Mr. Britling, a little while ago, what  my first impression of England was. Well, Mr. Britling, my first  impression of England that seems to me to matter in the least is this:  that it looks and feels more like the traditional Old England than any  one could possibly have believed, and that in reality it is less like  the traditional Old England than any one would ever possibly have  imagined.\"    He was carried on even further. He made a tremendous literary epigram.  \"I thought,\" he said, \"when I looked out of the train this morning that  I had come to the England of Washington Irving. I find it is not even  the England of Mrs. Humphry Ward.\"          CHAPTER THE SECOND    MR. BRITLING CONTINUES HIS EXPOSITION      Section 1    Mr. Direck found little reason to revise his dictum in the subsequent  experiences of the afternoon. Indeed the afternoon and the next day were  steadily consistent in confirming what a very good dictum it had been.  The scenery was the traditional scenery of England, and all the people  seemed quicker, more irresponsible, more chaotic, than any one could  have anticipated, and entirely inexplicable by any recognised code of  English relationships....    \"You think that John Bull is dead and a strange generation is wearing  his clothes,\" said Mr. Britling."]]]
