The Government  felt it to be a dangerous indictment, and Bacon was chosen to write the  answer to it. He had additional interest in the matter, for the pamphlet  made a special and bitter attack on Burghley, as the person mainly  responsible for the Queen's policy. Bacon's reply is long and elaborate,  taking up every charge, and reviewing from his own point of view the  whole course of the struggle between the Queen and the supporters of the  Roman Catholic interest abroad and at home. It cannot be considered an  impartial review; besides that it was written to order, no man in  England could then write impartially in that quarrel; but it is not more  one-sided and uncandid than the pamphlet which it answers, and Bacon is  able to recriminate with effect, and to show gross credulity and  looseness of assertion on the part of the Roman Catholic advocate. But  religion had too much to do with the politics of both sides for either  to be able to come into the dispute with clean hands: the Roman  Catholics meant much more than toleration, and the sanguinary  punishments of the English law against priests and Jesuits were edged by  something even keener than the fear of treason. But the paper contains  some large surveys of public affairs, which probably no one at that time  could write but Bacon. Bacon never liked to waste anything good which he  had written; and much of what he had written in the panegyric in _Praise  of the Queen_ is made use of again, and transferred with little change  to the pages of the _Observations on a Libel_.    FOOTNOTES:    [2] Dr. Mozley.          CHAPTER II.    BACON AND ELIZABETH.      The last decade of the century, and almost of Elizabeth's reign  (1590-1600), was an eventful one to Bacon's fortunes. In it the vision  of his great design disclosed itself more and more to his imagination  and hopes, and with more and more irresistible fascination. In it he  made his first literary venture, the first edition of his _Essays_  (1597), ten in number, the first-fruits of his early and ever watchful  observation of men and affairs. These years, too, saw his first steps in  public life, the first efforts to bring him into importance, the first  great trials and tests of his character. They saw the beginning and they  saw the end of his relations with the only friend who, at that time,  recognised his genius and his purposes, certainly the only friend who  ever pushed his claims; they saw the growth of a friendship which was to  have so tragical a close, and they saw the beginnings and causes of a  bitter personal rivalry which was to last through life, and which was to  be a potent element hereafter in Bacon's ruin. The friend was the Earl  of Essex. The competitor was the ablest, and also the most truculent and  unscrupulous of English lawyers, Edward Coke.    While Bacon, in the shade, had been laying the foundations of his  philosophy of nature, and vainly suing for legal or political  employment, another man had been steadily rising in the Queen's favour  and carrying all before him at Court--Robert Devereux, Lord Essex; and  with Essex Bacon had formed an acquaintance which had ripened into an  intimate and affectionate friendship. We commonly think of Essex as a  vain and insolent favourite, who did ill the greatest work given him to  do--the reduction of Ireland; who did it ill from some unexplained  reason of spite and mischief; and who, when called to account for it,  broke out into senseless and idle rebellion. This was the end. But he  was not always thus. He began life with great gifts and noble ends; he  was a serious, modest, and large-minded student both of books and  things, and he turned his studies to full account. He had imagination  and love of enterprise, which gave him an insight into Bacon's ideas  such as none of Bacon's contemporaries had. He was a man of simple and  earnest religion; he sympathized most with the Puritans, because they  were serious and because they were hardly used. Those who most condemn  him acknowledge his nobleness and generosity of nature. Bacon in after  days, when all was over between them, spoke of him as a man always  _patientissimus veri_; \"the more plainly and frankly you shall deal with  my lord,\" he writes elsewhere, \"not only in disclosing particulars, but  in giving him _caveats_ and admonishing him of any error which in this  action he may commit (such is his lordship's nature), the better he will  take it.\" \"He must have seemed,\" says Mr. Spedding, a little too  grandly, \"in the eyes of Bacon like the hope of the world.\" The two men,  certainly, became warmly attached. Their friendship came to be one of  the closest kind, full of mutual services, and of genuine affection on  both sides. It was not the relation of a great patron and useful  dependant; it was, what might be expected in the two men, that of  affectionate equality. Each man was equally capable of seeing what the  other was, and saw it. What Essex's feelings were towards Bacon the  results showed. Bacon, in after years, repeatedly claimed to have  devoted his whole time and labour to Essex's service. Holding him, he  says, to be \"the fittest instrument to do good to the State, I applied  myself to him in a manner which I think rarely happeneth among men;  neglecting the Queen's service, mine own fortune, and, in a sort, my  vocation, I did nothing but advise and ruminate with myself ... anything  that might concern his lordship's honour, fortune, or service.\" The  claim is far too wide. The \"Queen's service\" had hardly as yet come much  in Bacon's way, and he never neglected it when it did come, nor his own  fortune or vocation; his letters remain to attest his care in these  respects. But no doubt Bacon was then as ready to be of use to Essex,  the one man who seemed to understand and value him, as Essex was  desirous to be of use to Bacon.    And it seemed as if Essex would have the ability as well as the wish.  Essex was, without exception, the most brilliant man who ever appeared  at Elizabeth's Court, and it seemed as if he were going to be the most  powerful. Leicester was dead. Burghley was growing old, and indisposed  for the adventures and levity which, with all her grand power of ruling,  Elizabeth loved. She needed a favourite, and Essex was unfortunately  marked out for what she wanted. He had Leicester's fascination, without  his mean and cruel selfishness. He was as generous, as gallant, as quick  to descry all great things in art and life, as Philip Sidney, with more  vigour and fitness for active life than Sidney. He had not Raleigh's  sad, dark depths of thought, but he had a daring courage equal to  Raleigh's, without Raleigh's cynical contempt for mercy and honour. He  had every personal advantage requisite for a time when intellect, and  ready wit, and high-tempered valour, and personal beauty, and skill in  affairs, with equal skill in amusements, were expected to go together in  the accomplished courtier. And Essex was a man not merely to be courted  and admired, to shine and dazzle, but to be loved. Elizabeth, with her  strange and perverse emotional constitution, loved him, if she ever  loved any one. Every one who served him loved him; and he was, as much  as any one could be in those days, a popular favourite. Under better  fortune he might have risen to a great height of character; in  Elizabeth's Court he was fated to be ruined.    For in that Court all the qualities in him which needed control received  daily stimulus, and his ardour and high-aiming temper turned into  impatience and restless irritability. He had a mistress who was at one  time in the humour to be treated as a tender woman, at another as an  outrageous flirt, at another as the haughtiest and most imperious of  queens; her mood varied, no one could tell how, and it was most  dangerous to mistake it. It was part of her pleasure to find in her  favourite a spirit as high, a humour as contradictory and determined, as  her own; it was the charming contrast to the obsequiousness or the  prudence of the rest; but no one could be sure at what unlooked-for  moment, and how fiercely, she might resent in earnest a display of what  she had herself encouraged. Essex was ruined for all real greatness by  having to suit himself to this bewildering and most unwholesome and  degrading waywardness. She taught him to think himself irresistible in  opinion and in claims; she amused herself in teaching him how completely  he was mistaken. Alternately spoiled and crossed, he learned to be  exacting, unreasonable, absurd in his pettish resentments or brooding  sullenness. He learned to think that she must be dealt with by the same  methods which she herself employed. The effect was not produced in a  moment; it was the result of a courtiership of sixteen years. But it  ended in corrupting a noble nature. Essex came to believe that she who  cowed others must be frightened herself; that the stinging injustice  which led a proud man to expect, only to see how he would behave when  refused, deserved to be brought to reason by a counter-buffet as rough  as her own insolent caprice. He drifted into discontent, into  disaffection, into neglect of duty, into questionable schemings for the  future of a reign that must shortly end, into criminal methods of  guarding himself, of humbling his rivals and regaining influence. A  \"fatal impatience,\" as Bacon calls it, gave his rivals an advantage  which, perhaps in self-defence, they could not fail to take; and that  career, so brilliant, so full of promise of good, ended in misery, in  dishonour, in remorse, on the scaffold of the Tower.    With this attractive and powerful person Bacon's fortunes, in the last  years of the century, became more and more knit up. Bacon was now past  thirty, Essex a few years younger.

The raising and movement of provisions of all kinds were interdicted.  The fields were laid waste, dwellings unroofed and fired, mills  destroyed, and, in short, everything that could desolate the land and  render it unfit for human habitation or support was commanded by one or  the other of the contending parties and executed by all the powers at  their disposal.    By the time the present Administration took office, a year ago,  reconcentration (so called) had been made effective over the better part  of the four central and western provinces--Santa Clara, Matanzas,  Havana, and Pinar del Rio.    The agricultural population to the estimated number of 300,000 or more  was herded within the towns and their immediate vicinage, deprived of  the means of support, rendered destitute of shelter, left poorly clad,  and exposed to the most unsanitary conditions. As the scarcity of food  increased with the devastation of the depopulated areas of production,  destitution and want became misery and starvation. Month by month the  death rate increased in an alarming ratio. By March, 1897, according to  conservative estimates from official Spanish sources, the mortality  among the reconcentrados from starvation and the diseases thereto  incident exceeded 50 per cent of their total number.    No practical relief was accorded to the destitute. The overburdened  towns, already suffering from the general dearth, could give no aid.  So-called \"zones of cultivation\" established within the immediate areas  of effective military control about the cities and fortified camps  proved illusory as a remedy for the suffering. The unfortunates, being  for the most part women and children, with aged and helpless men,  enfeebled by disease and hunger, could not have tilled the soil without  tools, seed, or shelter for their own support or for the supply of the  cities. Reconcentration, adopted avowedly as a war measure in order to  cut off the resources of the insurgents, worked its predestined result.  As I said in my message of last December, it was not civilized warfare;  it was extermination. The only peace it could beget was that of the  wilderness and the grave.    Meanwhile the military situation in the island had undergone a  noticeable change. The extraordinary activity that characterized the  second year of the war, when the insurgents invaded even the thitherto  unharmed fields of Pinar del Rio and carried havoc and destruction up  to the walls of the city of Havana itself, had relapsed into a dogged  struggle in the central and eastern provinces. The Spanish arms regained  a measure of control in Pinar del Rio and parts of Havana, but, under  the existing conditions of the rural country, without immediate  improvement of their productive situation. Even thus partially  restricted, the revolutionists held their own, and their conquest and  submission, put forward by Spain as the essential and sole basis of  peace, seemed as far distant as at the outset.    In this state of affairs my Administration found itself confronted with  the grave problem of its duty. My message of last December[4] reviewed  the situation and narrated the steps taken with a view to relieving its  acuteness and opening the way to some form of honorable settlement. The  assassination of the prime minister, Canovas, led to a change of  government in Spain. The former administration, pledged to subjugation  without concession, gave place to that of a more liberal party,  committed long in advance to a policy of reform involving the wider  principle of home rule for Cuba and Puerto Rico.    The overtures of this Government made through its new envoy, General  Woodford, and looking to an immediate and effective amelioration of the  condition of the island, although not accepted to the extent of admitted  mediation in any shape, were met by assurances that home rule in an  advanced phase would be forthwith offered to Cuba, without waiting for  the war to end, and that more humane methods should thenceforth prevail  in the conduct of hostilities. Coincidentally with these declarations  the new government of Spain continued and completed the policy, already  begun by its predecessor, of testifying friendly regard for this nation  by releasing American citizens held under one charge or another  connected with the insurrection, so that by the end of November not a  single person entitled in any way to our national protection remained in  a Spanish prison.    While these negotiations were in progress the increasing destitution of  the unfortunate reconcentrados and the alarming mortality among them  claimed earnest attention. The success which had attended the limited  measure of relief extended to the suffering American citizens among them  by the judicious expenditure through the consular agencies of the money  appropriated expressly for their succor by the joint resolution approved  May 24, 1897,[5] prompted the humane extension of a similar scheme of  aid to the great body of sufferers. A suggestion to this end was  acquiesced in by the Spanish authorities.    On the 24th of December last I caused to be issued an appeal to the  American people inviting contributions in money or in kind for the  succor of the starving sufferers in Cuba, following this on the 8th of  January by a similar public announcement of the formation of a central  Cuban relief committee, with headquarters in New York City, composed of  three members representing the American National Red Cross and the  religious and business elements of the community.    The efforts of that committee have been untiring and have accomplished  much. Arrangements for free transportation to Cuba have greatly aided  the charitable work. The president of the American Red Cross and  representatives of other contributory organizations have generously  visited Cuba and cooperated with the consul-general and the local  authorities to make effective distribution of the relief collected  through the efforts of the central committee. Nearly $200,000 in money  and supplies has already reached the sufferers, and more is forthcoming.  The supplies are admitted duty free, and transportation to the interior  has been arranged, so that the relief, at first necessarily confined to  Havana and the larger cities, is now extended through most, if not all,  of the towns where suffering exists.    Thousands of lives have already been saved. The necessity for a change  in the condition of the reconcentrados is recognized by the Spanish  Government. Within a few days past the orders of General Weyler have  been revoked. The reconcentrados, it is said, are to be permitted to  return to their homes and aided to resume the self-supporting pursuits  of peace. Public works have been ordered to give them employment and a  sum of $600,000 has been appropriated for their relief.    The war in Cuba is of such a nature that, short of subjugation or  extermination, a final military victory for either side seems  impracticable. The alternative lies in the physical exhaustion of the  one or the other party, or perhaps of both--a condition which in effect  ended the ten years' war by the truce of Zanjon. The prospect of such a  protraction and conclusion of the present strife is a contingency hardly  to be contemplated with equanimity by the civilized world, and least of  all by the United States, affected and injured as we are, deeply and  intimately, by its very existence.    Realizing this, it appeared to be my duty, in a spirit of true  friendliness, no less to Spain than to the Cubans, who have so much to  lose by the prolongation of the struggle, to seek to bring about an  immediate termination of the war. To this end I submitted on the 27th  ultimo, as a result of much representation and correspondence, through  the United States minister at Madrid, propositions to the Spanish  Government looking to an armistice until October 1 for the negotiation  of peace with the good offices of the President.    In addition I asked the immediate revocation of the order of  reconcentration, so as to permit the people to return to their farms and  the needy to be relieved with provisions and supplies from the United  States, cooperating with the Spanish authorities, so as to afford full  relief.    The reply of the Spanish cabinet was received on the night of the  31st ultimo. It offered, as the means to bring about peace in Cuba,  to confide the preparation thereof to the insular parliament, inasmuch  as the concurrence of that body would be necessary to reach a final  result, it being, however, understood that the powers reserved by the  constitution to the central Government are not lessened or diminished.  As the Cuban parliament does not meet until the 4th of May next, the  Spanish Government would not object for its part to accept at once  a suspension of hostilities if asked for by the insurgents from the  general in chief, to whom it would pertain in such case to determine  the duration and conditions of the armistice.    The propositions submitted by General Woodford and the reply of the  Spanish Government were both in the form of brief memoranda, the texts  of which are before me and are substantially in the language above  given. The function of the Cuban parliament in the matter of \"preparing\"  peace and the manner of its doing so are not expressed in the Spanish  memorandum, but from General Woodford's explanatory reports of  preliminary discussions preceding the final conference it is understood  that the Spanish Government stands ready to give the insular congress  full powers to settle the terms of peace with the insurgents, whether by  direct negotiation or indirectly by means of legislation does not  appear.    With this last overture in the direction of immediate peace, and its  disappointing"]]]
