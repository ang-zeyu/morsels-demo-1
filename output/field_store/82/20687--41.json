[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13775"],[0,"Every Step in Canning: The Cold-Pack Method (#6)"],[1," product is canned in the hot sirup.    However, during the World War we had a good chance to test the fruits  which we canned without sugar, when that commodity was scarce and, in  fact, impossible to get in very large quantities. We used our fruits  just as they were and considered them very good. This all goes to show  that we can easily adjust ourselves to prevailing conditions. In  canning without the sugar sirup, you would follow these directions:    Cull, stem or seed, and clean fruit by placing in a strainer and  pouring water over it until clean. Pack product thoroughly in glass  jars until full; use table knife or tablespoon for packing purposes.  Pour over the fruit boiling water from kettle, place rubbers and caps  in position, partially seal glass jars and place produce in canner.    If using hot-water-bath outfit sterilize from twenty to thirty  minutes. After sterilizing remove packs, seal glass jars, wrap in  paper to prevent bleaching, and store in a dry cool place.    When using a steam-pressure canner instead of the hot-water bath  sterilize for ten minutes with five pounds of steam pressure. Never  allow the pressure to go over ten pounds when you are canning soft  fruits.      WHEN TO CAN    Inexperienced canners may not know when certain fruits are in season  and at their prime for canning. The list below is necessarily subject  to change, as seasons vary from year to year; but in normal years this  table would hold true for the Northern States.

Adding powerfully to this was the  dependence of British cotton manufactures upon the American supply. The  British trade attitude, arising largely outside of direct governmental  contacts, was bound to have, nevertheless, a constant and important  influence on governmental action.    Governmental policy, seeking national power, conflicting trade and  industrial interests, are the favourite themes of those historians who  regard nations as determined in their relations solely by economic  causes--by what is called \"enlightened self-interest.\" But governments,  no matter how arbitrary, and still more if in a measure resting on  representation, react both consciously and unconsciously to a public  opinion not obviously based upon either national or commercial rivalry.  Sometimes, indeed, governmental attitude runs absolutely counter to  popular attitude in international affairs. In such a case, the  historical estimate, if based solely on evidences of governmental  action, is a false one and may do great injustice to the essential  friendliness of a people.    How then, did the British people, of all classes, regard America before  1860, and in what manner did that regard affect the British Government?  Here, it is necessary to seek British opinion on, and its reaction to,  American institutions, ideals, and practices. Such public opinion can  be found in quantity sufficient to base an estimate only in travellers'  books, in reviews, and in newspapers of the period. When all these are  brought together it is found that while there was an almost universal  British criticism of American social customs and habits of life, due to  that insularity of mental attitude characteristic of every nation,  making it prefer its own customs and criticize those of its neighbours,  summed up in the phrase \"dislike of foreigners\"--it is found that  British opinion was centred upon two main threads; first America as a  place for emigration and, second, American political ideals and  institutions[10].    British emigration to America, a governmentally favoured colonization  process before the American revolution, lost that favour after 1783,  though not at first definitely opposed. But emigration still continued  and at no time, save during the war of 1812, was it absolutely stopped.  Its exact amount is unascertainable, for neither Government kept  adequate statistics before 1820. With the end of the Napoleonic wars  there came great distress in England from which the man of energy sought  escape. He turned naturally to America, being familiar, by hearsay at  least, with stories of the ease of gaining a livelihood there, and  influenced by the knowledge that in the United States he would find  people of his own blood and speech. The bulk of this earlier emigration  to America resulted from economic causes. When, in 1825, one energetic  Member of Parliament, Wilmot Horton, induced the Government to appoint a  committee to investigate the whole subject, the result was a mass of  testimony, secured from returned emigrants or from their letters home,  in which there constantly appeared one main argument influencing the  labourer type of emigrant; he got good wages, and he was supplied, as a  farm hand, with good food. Repeatedly he testifies that he had \"three  meat meals a day,\" whereas in England he had ordinarily received but one  such meal a week.    Mere good living was the chief inducement for the labourer type of  emigrant, and the knowledge of such living created for this type  remaining in England a sort of halo of industrial prosperity surrounding  America. But there was a second testimony brought out by Horton's  Committee, less general, yet to be picked up here and there as evidence  of another argument for emigration to America. The labourer did not  dilate upon political equality, nor boast of a share in government,  indeed generally had no such share, but he did boast to his fellows at  home of the social equality, though not thus expressing it, which was  all about him. He was a common farm hand, yet he \"sat down to meals\"  with his employer and family, and worked in the fields side by side with  his \"master.\" This, too, was an astounding difference to the mind of the  British labourer. Probably for him it created a clearer, if not  altogether universal and true picture of the meaning of American  democracy than would have volumes of writing upon political  institutions. Gradually there was established in the lower orders of  British society a visualization of America as a haven of physical  well-being and personal social happiness.    This British labouring class had for long, however, no medium of  expression in print. Here existed, then, an unexpressed public opinion  of America, of much latent influence, but for the moment largely  negligible as affecting other classes or the Government. A more  important emigrating class in its influence on opinion at home, though  not a large class, was composed about equally of small farmers and small  merchants facing ruin in the agricultural and trading crises that  followed the end of the European war. The British travellers' books  from 1810 to 1820 are generally written by men of this class, or by  agents sent out from co-operative groups planning emigration. Generally  they were discontented with political conditions at home, commonly  opposed to a petrified social order, and attracted to the United States  by its lure of prosperity and content. The books are, in brief, a  superior type of emigrant guide for a superior type of emigrant,  examining and emphasizing industrial opportunity.    Almost universally, however, they sound the note of superior political  institutions and conditions. One wrote \"A republican finds here A  Republic, and the only Republic on the face of the earth that ever  deserved the name: where all are under the protection of equal laws; of  laws made by Themselves[11].\" Another, who established an English colony  in the Western States of Illinois, wrote of England that he objected to  \"being ruled and taxed by people who had no more right to rule and tax  us than consisted in the power to do it.\" And of his adopted country he  concludes: \"I love the Government; and thus a novel sensation is  excited; it is like the development of a new faculty. I am become a  patriot in my old age[12].\" Still another detailed the points of his  content, \"I am here, lord and master of myself and of 100 acres of  land--an improvable farm, little trouble to me, good society and a good  market, and, I think, a fine climate, only a little too hot and dry in  summer; the parson gets nothing from me; my state and road taxes and  poor rates amount to Sec.25.00 per annum. I can carry a gun if I choose; I  leave my door unlocked at night; and I can get snuff for one cent an  ounce or a little more[13].\"    From the first days of the American colonial movement toward  independence there had been, indeed, a British interest in American  political principles. Many Whigs sympathized with these principles for  reasons of home political controversy. Their sympathy continued after  American independence and by its insistent expression brought out  equally insistent opposition from Tory circles. The British home  movement toward a more representative Government had been temporarily  checked by the extremes into which French Liberalism plunged in 1791,  causing reaction in England. By 1820 pressure was again being exerted by  British Liberals of intelligence, and they found arguments in such  reports as those just quoted. From that date onward, and especially just  before the passing of the Reform Bill of 1832, yet always a factor, the  example of a prosperous American democracy was an element in British  home politics, lauded or derided as the man in England desired or not an  expansion of the British franchise. In the earlier period, however, it  is to be remembered that applause of American institutions did not mean  acceptance of democracy to the extent of manhood franchise, for no such  franchise at first existed in America itself. The debate in England was  simply whether the step forward in American democracy, was an argument  for a similar step in Great Britain.    Books, reviews and newspapers in Great Britain as the political quarrel  there grew in force, depicted America favourably or otherwise according  to political sympathies at home. Both before and after the Reform Bill  of 1832 this type of effort to mould opinion, by citation of America,  was widespread. Hence there is in such writing, not so much the  expression of public opinion, as of propaganda to affect that opinion.  Book upon book, review upon review, might be quoted to illustrate this,  but a few notable examples will suffice.    The most widely read and reviewed book on the United States before  1840, except the humorous and flippant characterization of America by  Mrs. Trollope, was Captain Basil Hall's three-volume work, published in  1829[14]. Claiming an open mind, he expected for his adverse findings a  readier credence. For adverse to American political institutions these  findings are in all their larger applications. In every line Hall  betrays himself as an old Tory of the 'twenties, fixed in his belief,  and convinced of the perfection and unalterableness of the British  Constitution. Captain Hamilton, who wrote in 1833, was more frank in  avowal of a purpose[15]. He states in his preface:         \"... When I found the institutions and experiences of the       United States deliberately quoted in the reformed parliament,       as affording safe precedent for British legislation, and       learned that the drivellers who uttered such nonsense,       instead of encountering merited derision, were listened to       with patience and approbation by men as ignorant as       "]]]
