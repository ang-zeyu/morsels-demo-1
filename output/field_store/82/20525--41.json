He is a soldier, sir,--of the  forty-fifth. So I followed my husband's fortins, as nat'ral, through the  world, till he was ordered to Ireland. Then he brought the children  over, and settled us down there at Bogafin in a little shop with his  mother--a widow. She was very koind too. But no need to tire you with  telling all. She married again, ma'am, a man young enough to be her  son--a nice man he was to look at too--a gentleman's servant he had  been. Then they set up in a public-house. Then the whiskey, ma'am, that  they bees all so fond of--he took to drinking it in the morning even,  ma'am--and that was bad, to my thinking.\"    \"Ay, indeed!\" said Molly, with a groan of sympathy; \"oh the whiskey! if  men could keep from it!\"    \"And if women could!\" said Mr. Crofton in a low voice.    The Englishwoman looked up at him, and then looked down, refraining from  assent to his smile.    \"My mother-in-law,\" continued she, \"was very koind to me all along, as  far as she could. But one thing she could not do; that was, to pay me  back the money of husband's and mine that I lent her. I thought this odd  of her--and hard. But then I did not know the ways of the country in  regard to never paying debts.\"    \"Sure it's not the ways of all Ireland, my dear,\" said Molly; \"and it's  only them that has not that can't pay--how can they?\"    \"I don't know--it's not for me to say,\" said the Englishwoman,  reservedly; \"I am a stranger. But I thought if they could not pay me,  they need not have kept a jaunting-car.\"    \"Is it a jaunting-car?\" cried Molly. She pushed from her the chair on  which she was leaning--\"Jaunting-car bodies! and not to pay you!--I give  them up intirely. Ill-used you were, my poor Mrs. Dermody--and a shame!  and you a stranger! But them were Connaught people. I ask your  pardon--finish your story.\"    \"It is finished, ma'am. They were ruined, and all sold; and I could not  stay with my children to be a burthen. I wrote to husband, and he wrote  me word to make my way to Dublin, if I could, to a cousin of his in  Pill-lane--here's the direction--and that if he can get leave from his  colonel, who is a good gentleman, he will be over to settle me  somewhere, to get my bread honest in a little shop, or some way. I am  used to work and hardship; so I don't mind. Brian was very koind in  his letter, and sent me all he had--a pound, ma'am--and I set out on my  journey on foot, with the three children. The people on the road were  very koind and hospitable indeed; I have nothing to say against the  Irish for that; they are more hospitabler a deal than in England, though  not always so honest. Stranger as I was, I got on very well till I came  to the little village here hard by, where my poor boy that is gone first  fell sick of the measles. His sickness, and the 'pot'ecary' stuff and  all, and the lodging and living ran me very low. But I paid all, every  farthing; and let none know how poor I was, for I was ashamed, you know,  ma'am, or I am sure they would have helped me, for they are a koind  people, I will say that for them, and ought so to do, I am sure. Well, I  pawned some of my things, my cloak even, and my silk bonnet, to pay  honest; and as I could not do no otherwise, I left them in pawn, and,  with the little money I raised, I set out forwards on my road to Dublin  again, so soon as I thought my boy was able to travel. I reckoned too  much upon his strength. We had got but a few miles from the village when  he dropped, and could not get on; and I was unwilling and ashamed to  turn back, having so little to pay for lodgings. I saw a kind of hut, or  shed, by the side of a hill. There was nobody in it. It was empty of  every thing but some straw, and a few turf, the remains of a fire. I  thought there would be no harm in taking shelter in it for my children  and myself for the night. The people never came back to whom it  belonged, and the next day my poor boy was worse; he had a fever this  time. Then the snow came on. We had some little store of provisions that  had been made up for us for the journey to Dublin, else we must have  perished when we were snowed up. I am sure the people in the village  never know'd that we were in that hut, or they would have come to help  us, for they bees very koind people. There must have been a day and a  night that passed, I think, of which I know nothing. It was all a dream.  When I got up from my illness, I found my boy dead--and the others with  famished looks. Then I had to see them faint with hunger.\"    The poor woman had told her story without any attempt to make it  pathetic, and thus far without apparent emotion or change of voice; but  when she came to this part, and spoke of her children, her voice changed  and failed--she could only add, looking at Gerald, \"You know the rest,  master; Heaven bless you!\"    _The Christmas Box_               *       *       *       *       *    THE COSMOPOLITE.           *       *       *       *       *    ENGLISH GARDENS.      We are veritable sticklers for old customs; and accordingly at this  season of the year, have our room decorated with holly and other  characteristic evergreens. For the last hour we have been seated before  a fine bundle of these festive trophies; and, strange as it may seem,  this circumstance gave rise to the following paper. The holly reminded  us of the Czar Peter spoiling the garden-hedge at Sayes Court; this led  us to John Evelyn, the father of English gardening: and the laurels  drove us into shrubbery nooks, and all the retrospections of our early  days, and above all to our early love of gardens. Our enthusiasm was  then unaffected and uninfluenced by great examples; we had neither heard  nor read of Lord Bacon nor Sir William Temple, nor any other illustrious  writer on gardening; but this love was the pure offspring of our own  mind and heart. Planting and transplanting were our delight; the seed  which our tiny hands let fall into the bosom of the earth, we almost  watched peeping through little clods, after the kind and quickening  showers of spring; and we regarded the germinating of an upturned bean  with all the surprise and curiosity of our nature. As we grew in mind  and stature, we learned the loftier lessons of philosophy, and threw  aside the \"Pocket Gardener,\" for the sublime chapters of Bacon and  Temple; and as the stream of life carried us into its vortex, we learned  to contemplate their pages as the living parterres of a garden, and  their bright imageries as fascinating flowers. As we journeyed onward  through the busy herds of crowded cities, we learned the holier  influences of gardens in reflecting that a garden has been the scene of  man's birth--his fall--and proffered redemption.    It would be difficult to find a subject which has been more fervently  treated by poets and philosophers, than the _love of gardens_. In old  Rome, poets sung of their gardens. Ovid is so fond of flowers, that in  his account of the Rape of Proserpine, in his Fasti, he devotes several  lines to the enumeration of flowers gathered by her attendants. But the  passion for gardening, which evidently came from the East, never  prevailed much in Europe till the times of the religious orders, who  greatly improved it.    Our anecdotical recollections of the taste for gardens must be but few,  or they will carry us beyond our limits. Lord Bacon appears to have done  more towards their encouragement than any other writer, and his essay  on gardens is too well known to admit of quotation. Sir William Temple  has, however, many eloquent passages in his writings, in one of which he  calls _gardening_ the \"inclination of kings, the choice of philosophers,  and the common favourite of public and private men; a pleasure of the  greatest, and the care of the meanest; and, indeed, an employment and a  possession, for which no man is too high or too low.\" Perhaps John  Evelyn did more than either of these philosophers. Temple's garden at  Moor Park was one of the most beautiful of its kind; but at the time  when Evelyn introduced ornamental gardening into England, there were no  examples for imitation. All was devised by his own active mind; and in  the political storms of his time, his garden and plantations became  subjects of popular conversation; while the intervals of his secession  from public life were filled up in writing several practical treatises  on his favourite science. At Wotton, in Surrey, may be seen the large,  enclosed flower-garden, which was to have formed one of the principal  objects in his \"Elysium Britannicum;\" and this idea has been partly  realized by one of his successors.    Andrew Marvell has, however, anathematized gardens with much severity,  in some lines entitled \"The Mower against Gardens;\" and commencing  thus:--      Luxurious man, to bring his vice in use,      Did after him the world seduce,    And from the fields the flowers and plants allure,      Where nature was most plain and pure.    He first enclos'd within the garden's square      A dead and standing pool of air;    And a more luscious earth from them did knead,      Which stupify'd them while it fed, &c.,    On the other side, old Gerarde asks his courteous and well-willing  readers--\"Whither do all men walk for their honest recreation, but where  the earth has most beneficially painted her face with flourishing  colours? and what season of the year more longed for than the spring,  whose gentle breath entices forth the kindly sweets, and makes them  yield their fragrant smells.\" Lord Bacon, too, thus fondly dwells on  part of its allurements:--\"That flower, which above all others yields  the sweetest smell in the air, is the violet. Next to that is the  musk-rose, then the strawberry leaves,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10840"],[0,"The Explorers of Australia and their Life-work (#6)"],[1," Marshdale, and is now preserved in the Australian Museum in Sydney,  New South Wales. It is the oldest marked-tree in the whole of  Australasia.    On the next morning Evans ascended the hill he alluded to, and from the  summit enjoyed a most extended view of the surrounding country, which he  compared to a view of the ocean. On his way back to Bathurst, he bestowed  upon the new river the name it now bears. A short passage in his diary,  written during his return, is of peculiar interest, as it contains the  first mention of snow seen in Australia by white men. On Thursday, the  8th of June, he writes:--    \"The mountains I observed bearing north-west are covered with snow; I  thought on my way out that their tops looked rather white. To-day it was  distinguished as plain as ever I saw snow on the mountains in Van  Diemen's Land. I never felt colder weather than it has been some days  past. We have broken ice full two inches thick.\"    On the 12th of June the party returned to Bathurst, and Evans had by that  time accomplished two of the most momentous journeys ever made in  Australia. It was not his actual discoveries alone that brought him fame,  but the vast field for settlement these discoveries opened up. The  independent explorations of Surveyor Evans ceased after his discovery of  the Lachlan; thenceforward he served Australia as second to Lieutenant  Oxley.    2.3. THE UNKNOWN WEST.    The settlers of that day took every advantage of the new outlets for  their energies, thrown open to them by the recent successful  explorations. Cattle and sheep were rapidly driven forward on to the  highlands, and, favoured by a beautiful site, the town of Bathurst soon  assumed an orderly appearance. Private enterprise had also been at work  elsewhere. The pioneer settlers were making their way south; the tide of  settlement flowed over the intermediate lands to the Shoalhaven River;  and in the north they had commenced the irresistible march of  civilization up the Hunter River.    It was in the Shoalhaven district that young Hamilton Hume, the first  Australian-born explorer to make his mark in the field, gained his  bushcraft.    Governor Macquarie, during his term of office, did his best to foster  exploration; and it was fortunate that the first advance into the  interior occurred when there was a Governor in Australia who did not look  coldly upon geographical enterprise.    The men who entered first upon the task of solving the geographical  problems of the interior of the Australian continent were doomed to meet  with much bitter disappointment. The varying nature of the seasons caused  the different travellers to form contrary and perplexing ideas, often  with regard to the same tract of country. What appeared to one man a land  of pleasant gurgling brooks, flowing through rich pastures, appeared to  another as a pitiless desert, unfit for human foot to venture upon.  Oxley, who traversed what is now the cream of the agricultural portion of  the state of New South Wales, speaks of the main part of it in terms of  the bitterest condemnation. His error was of course rather a mistake in  judgment than the result of inaccurate observation.    Some of the colonists nursed far fonder hopes, and the general opinion  seemed to be that these western flowing rivers would gather in  tributaries, and having swollen to a size worthy of so great a continent,  seek the sea on the west coast. W.C. Wentworth, who certainly was capable  of forming an opinion deserving consideration, wrote thus of the then  untraced Macquarie River:--    \"If the sanguine hopes to which the discovery of this river (the  Macquarie) has given birth should be realised, and it should be found to  empty itself into the ocean in the north-west coast, which is the only  part of this vast island that has not been accurately surveyed, in what  mighty conceptions of the future power and greatness of this colony may  we not reasonably indulge? The nearest point at which Mr. Oxley left off  to any part of the western coast is very little short of two thousand  miles. If this river therefore be already of the size of the Hawkesbury  at Windsor, which is not less than two hundred and fifty yards in  breadth, and of sufficient depth to float a seventy-four gun ship, it is  not difficult to imagine what must be its magnitude at its confluence  with the ocean, before it can arrive at which it has to traverse a  country nearly two thousand miles in extent. If it possesses the usual  sinuosities of rivers, its course to the sea cannot be less than from  five to six thousand miles, and the endless accession of tributary  streams which it must receive in its passage through so great an extent  of country will, without doubt, enable it to vie in point of magnitude  with any river in the world.\"    It was to realise such ambitious hopes as these that Oxley went forth to  penetrate into the interior.      CHAPTER 3. JOHN OXLEY.    [Illustration. John Oxley. From a portrait in the possession of Mrs.  Oxley, of Bowral. The portrait was presented to Mrs. King, widow of  Governor King in 1810, and signed by him.]      3.1. GENERAL BIOGRAPHY.    Oxley was born in England in the early part of 1781. In his youth he  entered the navy, saw active service in many parts of the world, and rose  to the rank of Lieutenant. He came to Australia in January, 1812, and was  appointed Surveyor-General.    Throughout his career in Australia, Oxley would seem to have won the  friendship and respect of all he came in contact with. Captain Charles  Sturt, in the journal of his first expedition, wrote of him as follows:--    \"A reflection arose to my mind, on examining these decaying vestiges of a  former expedition, whether I should be more fortunate than the leader of  it, and how far I should be able to penetrate beyond the point which had  conquered his perseverance. Only a week before I left Sydney I had  followed Mr. Oxley to the tomb. A man of great quickness and of uncommon  ability. The task of following up his discoveries was no less enviable  than arduous.\"    These thoughts were suggested to Sturt when standing at one of Oxley's  old camps, and coming from such a man carry great weight.    The following obituary notice of Oxley appeared in the Government Gazette  of May 27th, 1828.    \"It would be impossible for his Excellency, consistently with his  feelings, to announce the decease of the late Surveyor-General without  endeavouring to express the sense he entertains of Mr. Oxley's services,  though he cannot do justice to them.    \"From the nature of this colony, the office of Surveyor-General is  amongst the most important under Government; and to perform its duties in  a manner Mr. Oxley has done for a long series of years is as honourable  to his zeal and abilities as it is painful for the Government to be  deprived of them.    \"Mr. Oxley entered the public service at an early period of his life, and  has filled the important situation of Surveyor-General for the last  sixteen years.    \"His exertions in the public service have been unwearied, as has been  proved by his several expeditions to explore the interior. The public  have reaped the benefit while it is to be apprehended that the event,  which they cannot fail to lament, has been accelerated by the privations  and fatigues of these arduous services. Mr. Oxley eminently assisted in  unfolding the advantages of this highly favoured colony from an early  stage of its existence, and his name will ever be associated with the  dawn of its advancement. It is always gratifying to the Government to  record its approbation of the services of meritorious public officers,  and in assigning to Mr. Oxley's name a distinguished place in that class  to which his devotion to the interests of the colony has so justly  entitled him, the Government would do honour to his memory in the same  degree as it feels the loss it has sustained in his death.\"    Oxley died at Kirkham, his private residence near Sydney, on the 25th of  May, 1828. Though his judgment was at times at fault, as will be seen  later on, he was essentially a successful explorer; for, although he did  not in every case achieve the object aimed at, he always brought back his  men without loss, and he opened up vast tracts of new country. John  Oxley's personality is not very familiar, but the portrait presented to  the reader in this volume was taken in the prime of his life, before he  suffered the scars of doubtful battle with the Australian wilderness. It  has never been published before, and is taken from the original miniature  that he presented to Mrs. King, widow of Governor King, in 1810.    3.2. HIS FIRST EXPEDITION.    On this, Oxley's first journey of exploration, Evans accompanied him as  second in command, and another man who has left an immortal name was also  with him -- Allan Cunningham, officially known as King's Botanist.  Charles Fraser, well-known in connection with the early history both of  New South Wales and of Western Australia, accompanied Oxley under the  title of Colonial Botanist. There were nine other men in the party --  boatmen, horse-tenders, and so forth; they had with them two boats and  fourteen pack and riding-horses. A depot was first formed at the junction  of the small creek whence Evans had turned back, and where he had marked  a tree with his initials in 1815. There the boats were launched and  preparations completed for the final start. On the 6th of April, 1817,  Oxley left Sydney and joined his party at the depot on the 1st of May.  Thence he soon commenced this most momentous journey in Australia's early  annals, eager to penetrate into the unknown, and inspired with hopes of  solving the mystery of the outlet of this inland river.    Disappointment marks the tone of Oxley's journal from the start; the  exceeding flatness of the country, the many ana-branches of the river,  the low altitude of its banks, and the absence of "]]]
