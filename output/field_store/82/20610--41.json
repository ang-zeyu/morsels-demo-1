The batching apparatus for this machine is  of a different kind from that illustrated in Fig. 12; moreover, it  is placed nearer the feed rollers than the twelfth pair. The feed  pipes for the oil and the water are shown coming from a high plane,  and the supply is under the influence of chain gearing as shown on  the right near the large driving belt from the drum on the shafting.    The feed roller in this machine is a spirally fluted one, and the  nature of the flutes is clearly emphasized in the view. The barrow  of jute at the far end of the machine is built up from stricks which  have passed through the machine, and these stricks are now ready for  conditioning, and will be stored in a convenient position for future  treatment.      [Illustration: Fig. 13 Softening machine with batching apparatus]    While the jute as assorted and baled for export from India is graded  in such a way that it may be used for certain classes of yarn  without any further selection or treatment, it may be possible to  utilize the material to better advantage by a judicious selection  and treatment after it has undergone the operation of batching.    What are known as cuttings are often treated by a special machine  known as a \"root-opener.\" The jute cuttings are fed into the  machines and the fibre rubbed between fixed and rotating pins in  order to loosen the matted ends of stricks. Foreign matter drops  through the openings of a grid to the floor, and the fibre is  delivered on to a table, or, if desired, on to the feed sheet of the  softener.    The root ends of stricks are sometimes treated by a special machine  termed a root-comber with the object of loosening the comparatively  hard end of the strick. A snipping machine or a teazer may also be  used for somewhat similar purposes, and for opening out ropes and  similar close textures.    The cuttings may be partially loosened by means of blows from a  heavy iron bar; boiling water is then poured on the fibre, and then  the material is built up with room left for expansion, and allowed  to remain in this condition for a few days. A certain quantity of  this material may then be used along with other marks of jute to  form a batch suitable for the intended yarn.    A very common practice is to cut the hard root ends off by means of  a large stationary knife. At other times, the thin ends of the  stricks are also cut off by the same instrument. These two parts are  severed when it is desired to utilize only the best part of the  strick. The root ends are usually darker in colour than the remainder,  and hence the above process is one of selection with the object of  securing a yarn which will be uniform in colour and in strength.          CHAPTER VII.  CARDING    _Breaker and Finisher Cards_. After the fibre from the softening  machine has been conditioned for the desired time, it is ready for  one of the most important processes in the cycle of jute manufacture;  this process is termed carding, and is conducted in two distinct  types of machines--              1. The breaker card.          2. The finisher card.      The functions of the two machines are almost identical; indeed, one  might say that the work of carding should be looked upon as one  continuous operation.    The main difference between the two types of machines is in the  method of feeding, and the degree of fineness or setting of the  small tools or pins which perform the work. In both cases the action  on the stricks of jute is equivalent to a combined combing and  splitting movement, and the pins in the various rollers move  relatively to each other so that while the pins of a slowly-moving  roller allow the strick or stricks (because there are several side  by side) to pass slowly and gradually from end to end, the pins of  another but quickly-moving roller perform the splitting and the  combing of the fibre. The pins of the slowly-moving roller hold, so  to speak, the strick, while the pins of the quickly-moving roller  comb out the fibres and split adhering parts asunder so as to make a  comparatively fine division.    The conditioned stricks from the softening machine are first  arranged in some suitable receptacle and within easy reach of the  operative at the back or feed side of the breaker card. A receptacle,  very similar to that used at the breaker card, appears near the far  end of the softening machine in Fig. 13.    A modern breaker card is illustrated in Fig. 14. The feed or back of  the card is on the extreme right, the delivery or front of the card  on the extreme left, while the gear side of the card is facing the  observer. The protecting cages were removed so that the wheels would  be seen as clearly as possible.    Some of the stricks of fibre are seen distinctly on the feed side of  the figure; they are accommodated, as mentioned, in a channel-shaped  stand on the far side of the inclined feed sheet, or feed cloth,  which leads up to and conveys the stricks into the grip of the  feeding apparatus. This particular type is termed a \"shell\" feed  because the upper contour of the guiding feed bracket is shaped  somewhat like a shell. There is a gradually decreasing and  suitably-sized gap between the upper part of the shell and the pins  of the feed roller.    The root ends of the pins in this roller lead, and the stricks of  fibre are gripped between the pins and the shell, and simultaneously  carried into the machine where they come into contact with the  points of the pins in the rapidly-revolving large roller, termed a  cylinder. The above-mentioned combing and splitting action takes  place at this point as well as for a distance of, say, 24 inches to  30 inches below. The fibres which are separated at this stage are  carried a little further round until they come into contact with the  points of the pins in the above-mentioned slowly-moving roller,  termed a \"worker,\" and while the fibres are moving slowly forward  under the restraining influence of the worker, they are further  combed and split. A portion of the fibres is carried round by the  pins of the worker from which such fibres are removed by the  quicker moving pins of the second roller of the pair, termed a  \"stripper,\" and in turn these fibres are removed from the pins of  the stripper by the much quicker moving pins of the cylinder.    [Illustration: FIG. 14 MODERN BREAKER CARD]    The above operations conducted by the first pair of rollers (worker  and stripper) in conjunction with the cylinder, are repeated by a  second and similar pair of rollers (worker and stripper), and ultimately  the thin sheet of combed and split fibres comes into contact with the  pins of the doffer from which it is removed by the drawing and pressing  rollers. The sheet of fibres finally emerges from these rollers into  the broad and upper part of the conductor. This conductor, made mostly  of tin and V-shaped, is shown clearly on the left of the machine in  Fig. 14. Immediately the thin film or sheet of fibres enters the  conductor, it is caused as a body gradually to contract in width and,  of course, to increase in thickness, and is simultaneously guided and  delivered to the delivery rollers, and from these to the sliver can,  distinctly seen immediately below the delivery rollers. The sliver is  seen emerging from the above rollers and entering the sliver can.    The fibres in this machine are thus combed, split and drawn forward  relatively to each other, in addition to being arranged more or less  parallel to each other. The technical term \"draft\" is used to  indicate the operation of causing the fibres to slip on each other,  and in future we shall speak about this attenuation or drawing out  of the fibres by this special term \"draft.\"    It will be evident that, since the sliver is delivered into the can  at the rate of about 50 yards per minute, this constant flow will  soon provide a sufficient length of sliver to fill a sliver can,  although the latter may hold approximately 20 lbs. The machine must,  of course, deliver its quota to enable succeeding machines to be  kept in practically constant work. As a matter of fact, the machines  are arranged in what are termed \"systems,\" so that this desirable  condition of a constant and sufficient feed to all may be  satisfactorily fulfilled.    The driving or pulley side of the breaker card is very similar to  that shown in Fig. 15 which, however, actually represents the pulley  side of one type of finisher card as made by Messrs. Douglas Fraser &  Sons, Ltd., Arbroath. All finisher cards are fed by slivers which  have been made as explained in connection with the breaker card, but  there are two distinct methods of feeding the slivers, or rather of  arranging the slivers at the feed side. In both cases, however, the  full width of the card is fed by slivers laid side by side, with,  however, a thin guide plate between each pair, and one at each  extreme end.    One very common method of feeding is to place 10 or 12 full sliver  cans--which have been prepared at the breaker card--on the floor and  to the right of the machine illustrated in Fig. 15. The sliver from  each can is then placed into the corresponding sliver guide, and  thus the full width of the machine is occupied. The slivers are  guided by the sliver guides on to an endless cloth or \"feed sheet\"  which, in turn, conveys them continuously between the feed rollers.  The feed apparatus in such machines is invariably of the roller type,  and sometimes it involves what is known as a \"porcupine\" roller. It  will be understood that the feeding of level slivers is a different  problem from that which necessitates the feeding of comparatively  uneven stricks.    [Illustration: By permission of Messrs. Douglas Fraser & Sons, Ltd.  FIG. 15 FINISHER CARD WITH DRAWING-HEAD]    The slivers travel horizontally with the feed-sheet and enter the  machine at a height of about 4 feet from the floor.

They speak a noble language,      Copious and rich and strong;    Yet none of your greatest schoolmen      Can understand that tongue.      But I have learnt it, and never      Can forget it for my part--    For I used as my only grammar      The face of the joy of my heart.    9[13]      On the wings of song far sweeping,      Heart's dearest, with me thou'lt go    Away where the Ganges is creeping;      Its loveliest garden I know--      A garden where roses are burning      In the moonlight all silent there;    Where the lotus-flowers are yearning      For their sister beloved and fair.      The violets titter, caressing,      Peeping up as the planets appear,    And the roses, their warm love confessing,      Whisper words, soft-perfumed, to each ear.      And, gracefully lurking or leaping,      The gentle gazelles come round:    While afar, deep rushing and sweeping,      The waves of the Ganges sound.      We'll lie there in slumber sinking      Neath the palm-trees by the stream,    Rapture and rest deep drinking,      Dreaming the happiest dream.    10[14]      The lotos flower is troubled      By the sun's too garish gleam,    She droops, and with folded petals      Awaiteth the night in a dream.      'Tis the moon has won her favor,      His light her spirit doth wake,    Her virgin bloom she unveileth      All gladly for his dear sake.      Unfolding and glowing and shining      She yearns toward his cloudy height;    She trembles to tears and to perfume      With pain of her love's delight.    [Illustration: FLOWER FANTASY _Train the Painting by Ludwig von  Hofmann._]    11[15]      The Rhine's bright wave serenely      Reflects as it passes by    Cologne that lifts her queenly      Cathedral towers on high.      A picture hangs in the dome there,      On leather with gold bedight,    Whose beauty oft when I roam there      Sheds hope on my troubled night.      For cherubs and flowers are wreathing      Our Lady with tender grace;    Her eyes, cheeks, and lips half-breathing      Resemble my loved one's face.    12[16]      I am not wroth, my own lost love, although    My heart is breaking--wroth I am not, no!    For all thou dost in diamonds blaze, no ray    Of light into thy heart's night finds its way.      I saw thee in a dream. Oh, piteous sight!    I saw thy heart all empty, all in night;    I saw the serpent gnawing at thy heart;    I saw how wretched, O my love, thou art!    13[17]      When thou shalt lie, my darling, low      In the dark grave, where they hide thee,    Then down to thee I will surely go,      And nestle in beside thee.      Wildly I'll kiss and clasp thee there,      Pale, cold, and silent lying;    Shout, shudder, weep in dumb despair,      Beside my dead love dying.      The midnight calls, up rise the dead,      And dance in airy swarms there;    We twain quit not our earthly bed,      I lie wrapt in your arms there.      Up rise the dead; the Judgment-day      To bliss or anguish calls them;    We twain lie on as before we lay,      And heed not what befalls them.    14[18]      A young man loved a maiden,      But she for another has sigh'd;    That other, he loves another,      And makes her at length his bride.      The maiden marries, in anger,      The first adventurous wight    That chance may fling before her;      The youth is in piteous plight.      The story is old as ages,      Yet happens again and again;    The last to whom it happen'd,      His heart is rent in twain.    15[19]      A lonely pine is standing      On the crest of a northern height;    He sleeps, and a snow-wrought mantle      Enshrouds him through the night.      He's dreaming of a palm-tree      Afar in a tropic land,    That grieves alone in silence      'Mid quivering leagues of sand.    16[20]      My love, we were sitting together      In a skiff, thou and I alone;    'Twas night, very still was the weather,      Still the great sea we floated on.      Fair isles in the moonlight were lying,      Like spirits, asleep in a trance;    Their strains of sweet music were sighing,      And the mists heaved in an eery dance.      And ever, more sweet, the strains rose there,      The mists flitted lightly and free;    But we floated on with our woes there,      Forlorn on that wide, wide sea.    17[21]      I see thee nightly in dreams, my sweet,      Thine eyes the old welcome making,    And I fling me down at thy dear feet      With the cry of a heart that is breaking.      Thou lookest at me in woful wise      With a smile so sad and holy,    And pearly tear-drops from thine eyes      Steal silently and slowly.      Whispering a word, thou lay'st on my hair      A wreath with sad cypress shotten;    awake, the wreath is no longer there,      And the word I have forgotten.           *       *       *       *       *        SONNETS (1822)    TO MY MOTHER    1[22]      I have been wont to bear my head on high,      Haughty and stern am I of mood and mien;      Yea, though a king should gaze on me, I ween,    I should not at his gaze cast down my eye.    But I will speak, dear Mother, candidly:      When most puffed up my haughty mood hath been,      At thy sweet presence, blissful and serene,    I feel the shudder of humility.      Does thy soul all unknown my soul subdue,    Thy lofty soul that pierces all things through    And speeds on lightning wings to heaven's blue?    Or am I racked by what my memories tell    Of frequent deeds which caused thy heart to swell--    That beauteous heart which loved me, ah! too well.    2[23]      With foolish fancy I deserted thee;    I fain would search the whole world through to learn    If in it I perchance could love discern,    That I might love embrace right lovingly.    I sought for love as far as eye could see,    My hands extending at each door in turn,    Begging them not my prayer for love to spurn--    Cold hate alone they laughing gave to me.    And ever search'd I after love; yes, ever    Search'd after love, but love discover'd never,    And so I homeward went with troubled thought;    But thou wert there to welcome me again,    And, ah, what in thy dear eye floated then    That was the sweet love I so long had sought.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: POOR PETER _From the Painting by P.

There came the heart-breaking news to their ears      That France was by fortune forsaken;    Scattered and slain were her brave grenadiers,      And Napoleon, Napoleon was taken.      Then wept together those two grenadiers      O'er their country's departed glory;    \"Woe's me,\" cried one, in the midst of his tears,      \"My old wound--how it burns at the story!\"      The other said: \"The end has come,      What avails any longer living    Yet have I a wife and child at home,      For an absent father grieving.      \"Who cares for wife?
