He was buried in Westminster Abbey, and later a  fine monument was erected to his memory. The most of his manuscripts  came into the possession of King George III, and are preserved in the  musical library of Buckingham Palace.          IV    CHRISTOPH WILLIBALD GLUCK      Christoph Willibald Gluck has been called the \"regenerator of the  opera\" for he appeared just at the right moment to rescue opera  from the deplorable state into which it had fallen. At that time the  composers often yielded to the caprices of the singers and wrote to  suit them, while the singers themselves, through vanity and ignorance,  made such requirements that opera itself often became ridiculous.  Gluck desired \"to restrict the art of music to its true object, that  of aiding the effect of poetry by giving greater expression to words  and scenes, without interrupting the action or the plot.\" He wrote  only operas, and some of his best works keep the stage to-day. They  are simple in design yet powerful in appeal: very original and stamped  with refinement and true feeling.    The boy Christoph, like many another lad who became a great musician,  had a sorrowful childhood, full of poverty and neglect. His home was  in the little town of Weissenwangen, on the borders of Bohemia, where  he was born July 2, 1714. As a little lad he early manifested a love  for music, but his parents were in very straitened circumstances and  could not afford to pay for musical instruction. He was sent to one of  the public schools. Fortunately the art of reading music from notes,  formation of scales and fundamentals, was taught along with general  school subjects.    While his father lived the boy was sure of sympathy and affection,  though circumstances were of the poorest. But the good man passed away  when the boy was quite young, and then matters were much worse. He was  gradually neglected until he was at last left to shift for himself.    He possessed not only talent but perseverance and the will to succeed.  The violoncello attracted him, and he began to teach himself to play  it, with no other help than an old instruction book. Determination  conquered many difficulties however, and before long he had made  sufficient progress to enable him to join a troop of traveling  minstrels. From Prague they made their way to Vienna.    Arrived in Vienna, that rich, gay, laughter-loving city, where the  people loved music and often did much for it, the youth's musical  talent together with his forlorn appearance and condition won sympathy  from a few generous souls, who not only provided a home and took care  of his material needs, but gave him also the means to continue his  musical studies. Christoph was overcome with gratitude and made the  best possible use of his opportunities. For nearly two years he gave  himself up to his musical studies.    Italy was the goal of his ambition, and at last the opportunity  to visit that land of song was within his grasp. At the age of  twenty-four, in the year 1738, Gluck bade adieu to his many kind  friends in Vienna, and set out to complete his studies in Italy. Milan  was his objective point. Soon after arriving there he had the good  fortune to meet Padre Martini, the celebrated master of musical  theory. Young Gluck at once placed himself under the great man's  guidance and labored diligently with him for about four years. How  much he owed to the careful training Martini was able to give, was  seen in even his first attempts at operatic composition.    At the conclusion of this long period of devoted study, Gluck began to  write an opera, entitled \"Artaxerxes.\" When completed it was accepted  at the Milan Theater, brought out in 1741 and met with much success.  This success induced one of the managers in Venice to offer him an  engagement for that city if he would compose a new opera. Gluck then  produced \"Clytemnestra.\" This second work had a remarkable success,  and the managers arranged for the composition of another opera, which  was \"Demetrio,\" which, like the others was most favorably received.  Gluck now had offers from Turin, so that the next two years were spent  between that city and Milan, for which cities he wrote five or six  operas. By this time the name of Gluck had become famous all over  Italy; indeed his fame had spread to other countries, with the  result that tempting offers for new operas flowed in to him from all  directions. Especially was a London manager, a certain Lord Middlesex,  anxious to entice the young composer from Italy to come over to  London, and produce some of his works at the King's Theater in the  Haymarket.    The noble manager made a good offer too, and Gluck felt he ought to  accept. He reached London in 1745, but owing to the rebellion which  had broken out in Scotland all the theaters were closed, and the city  in more or less confusion. However a chance to hear the famous German  composer, who had traveled such a distance, was not to be lost, and  Lord Middlesex besought the Powers to re-open the theater. After much  pleading his request was finally granted. The opening opera, written  on purpose to introduce Gluck to English audiences, was entitled \"La  Caduta del Giganti,\"--\"Fall of the Giants\"--and did not seem to please  the public. But the young composer was undaunted. His next opera,  \"Artamene,\" pleased them no better. The mind of the people was taken  up at that period with politics and political events, and they cared  less than usual for music and the arts. Then, too, Handel, at the  height of his fame, was living in London, honored and courted by the  aristocracy and the world of fashion.    Though disappointed at his lack of success, Gluck remained in England  several years, constantly composing operas, none of which seemed to  win success. At last he took his way quietly back to Vienna. In 1754,  he was invited to Rome, where he produced several operas, among them  \"Antigone\"; they were all successful, showing the Italians appreciated  his work. He now proceeded to Florence, and while there became  acquainted with an Italian poet, Ranieri di Calzabigi. They were  mutually attracted to each other, and on parting had sworn to use  their influence and talents to reform Italian opera.    Gluck returned to Vienna, and continued to compose operas. In 1764,  \"Orfeo\" was produced,--an example of the new reform in opera! \"Orfeo\"  was received most favorably and sung twenty-eight times, a long run  for those days. The singing and acting of Guadagni made the opera  quite the rage, and the work began to be known in England. Even in  Paris and Parma it became a great favorite. The composer was  now fifty, and his greatest works had yet--with the exception or  \"Orfeo\"--to be written. He began to develop that purity of style which  we find in \"Alceste,\" \"Iphigenie en Tauride\" and others. \"Alceste\" was  the second opera on the reformed plan which simplified the music to  give more prominence to the poetry. It was produced in Vienna in 1769,  with the text written by Calzabigi. The opera was ahead of \"Orfeo\" in  simplicity and nobility, but it did not seem to please the critics.  The composer himself wrote: \"Pedants and critics, an infinite  multitude, form the greatest obstacle to the progress of art. They  think themselves entitled to pass a verdict on 'Alceste' from some  informal rehearsals, badly conducted and executed. Some fastidious  ear found a vocal passage too harsh, or another too impassioned,  forgetting that forcible expression and striking contrasts are  absolutely necessary. It was likewise decided in full conclave, that  this style of music was barbarous and extravagant.\"    In spite of the judgment of the critics, \"Alceste\" increased the  fame of Gluck to a great degree. Paris wanted to see the man who had  revolutionized Italian opera. The French Royale Academie had made him  an offer to visit the capital, for which he was to write a new opera  for a debut. A French poet, Du Rollet, living in Vienna, offered to  write a libretto for the new opera, and assured him there was every  chance for success in a visit to France. The libretto was thereupon  written, or rather arranged from Racine's \"Iphigenie en Aulide,\" and  with this, Chevalier Gluck, lately made Knight of the papal order of  the Golden Spur, set out for Paris.    And now began a long season of hard work. The opera \"Iphigenie\"  took about a year to compose, besides a careful study of the French  language. He had even more trouble with the slovenly, ignorant  orchestra, than he had with the French language. The orchestra  declared itself against foreign music; but this opposition was  softened down by his former pupil and patroness, the charming Marie  Antoinette, Queen of France.    After many trials and delays, \"Iphigenie\" was produced August 19,  1774. The opera proved an enormous success. The beautiful Queen  herself gave the signal for applause in which the whole house joined.  The charming Sophie Arnould sang the part of Iphigenie and seemed  to quite satisfy the composer. Larrivee was the Agamemnon, and other  parts were well sung. The French were thoroughly delighted. They  feted and praised Gluck, declaring he had discovered the music of the  ancient Greeks, that he was the only man in Europe who could express  real feelings in music. Marie Antoinette wrote to her sister: \"We had,  on the nineteenth, the first performance of Gluck's 'Iphigenie,' and  it was a glorious triumph. I was quite enchanted, and nothing else is  talked of. All the world wishes to see the piece, and Gluck seems well  satisfied.\"    The next year, 1775, Gluck brought out an adaptation suitable for  the French stage, of his \"Alceste,\" which again aroused the greatest  enthusiasm. The theater was crammed at every performance. Marie  Antoinette's favorite composer was again praised to the skies, and was  declared to be the greatest composer living.    But Gluck had one powerful"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13300"],[0,"The Doctrine and Practice of Yoga (#6)"],[1,"ves. But as  consciousness rises in the scale of evolution, man begins to \"dissociate\"  his idea of \"me\" from the body and he begins to regard his body as a  beloved companion and as \"belonging to\" him. He then identifies himself  with his mental states, emotions, feelings, likes and dislikes, habits,  qualities and characteristics. But, by and by, he begins to realize how  even these moods also are subject to change, born and die and are subject  to the Principles of Rhythm and Polarity. He realizes faintly that he can  change them by an effort of will and \"transmute\" them into mental states  of an exactly opposite nature. Then he again begins to \"dissociate\"  himself from his emotions and feelings and at last through mental  analysis, introspection and concentration, he sets them apart into the  \"not I\" collection. He begins _then_ to realize that he is something  _above_ his body and emotions. So also with the intellectual  functions. The intellectual man is very apt to think that although his  _physical_ and _emotional_ selves are something different from him and  under his control, _still his intellect is himself_. This is the stage of  \"Self-Consciousness\". \"I control my body and emotions.\" But as  consciousness unfolds intellectual man finds that he can practically  stand aside and see (mentally, of course) his mind going through various  processes of intellection. Study of Psychology and Logic will enable  you to see how all your intellectual processes may be held at arm's  length, examined, analysed, labelled and discussed quite with the same  ease as the professor talks of a solid, liquid and acriform substances in  his laboratory. So at last he finds that even the wonderful powers of  the Intellect must go into the \"not I\" collection. This is almost as far  as the average man can realize. You can realize and say \"I am not the  body, not the emotions, not the intellect.\" Therefore you see, that side  of consciousness which is the sum-total of your physical, emotional and  intellectual functions comprises the \"me\" or Feminine or Passive mental  principle. That which can separate itself in thought from all the above  is the \"I\" or the Masculine Function. But another step must be taken.  That which you have been taught to regard as the Spiritual Consciousness  (see \"Spiritual Consciousness\") will also eventually go into the  \"Not-I\" or \"me\" collection. In brief, the spiritual mind may be said to  comprise all that is GOOD, NOBLE and GREAT in the field of consciousness.  It is the \"Super-Conscious\" mind, just now. But, mark this, when through  further evolution, the \"I\" has mastered this field of consciousness also  and is able to regard it as being the last of the \"me\" collections, then  it will lose its sense of _relativity_ and _separation_ and the real  individuality, the \"I AM\" consciousness, will have been realized.  What do I mean? This \"I AM\" is not the petulant self-assertion of the  relative ego. \"I\" but really means GOD CONSCIOUSNESS as perfect  Existence, perfect Knowledge or perfect Bliss. It means the realization  of an Infinite and Eternal Self or Individuality. \"He that has lost the  self has gained the SELF\". Here is the explanation: this little self or  \"I\" so long as it is attached to the PERSONALITY which is the product  of the \"me\" consciousness is bound down to the relative plane. It can  think only through only one brain, enjoy through one body and such  happiness as it gets is transitory, short-lived and impermanent because  this world of relative existence is itself essentially changeable. It is  permanent only in its impermanence. So long as the \"I\" thinks and while  only for the benefits of its personal self, both thinking and willing are  limited and not free. But when it has succeeded in joining itself to the  Spiritual mind and works for, aspires after the Larger Self--the \"I  AM\"--it has to renounce or \"disattach\" itself from the personal self and  work under the guidance of the impersonal Higher Self. \"I refuse to  be contained within my hat and boots,\" said Walt Whitman. When the  Vedantist says \"Aham Brahmasmi\"--\"I am the absolute\"--he does not mean  this lower \"I\". No, no. He is not built that way. For him the moorings of  self-consciousness are out. He has lost all sense of his particular  relative \"I\" and has _one-d_ himself with the absolute \"I AM\"--the  impersonal, intangible, immortal, omnipotent Self of and over all.  This \"I am\" is Spirit or Atman. There can be but one Individuality--that  of the Absolute. It becomes objectively expressed in man as Cosmic  Consciousness. Subjectively it is God. Now then you have an idea of  the \"I am\" Consciousness. Hold fast to it. It is your real, Larger Self.  In the understanding and the exercise of the Will-Power the \"I\" or the  Positive Mental Principle is the chief factor. To use the one you must  understand the other. Will is a Soul-Power. This \"I\"--as I have explained  it above--is negative to the \"I AM\" or God--both meaning the  same thing. It is positive in relation to the Higher Self. This \"I\" is  the future promise of the \"I AM\". It is true it shall lose itself in  finding its Self, but so does the child when it grows into full manhood.  Christ was one with his Father-in-Heaven (i.e., on the spiritual plane)  and therefore he could still the waves and raise the dead. Yet just you  examine the nature of Lord Christ's Will-Force. Think of his constant  retirement into the Silence in order to obtain inspiration for his work  in the objective universe. Again, note his utter indifference to and  absolute control over his personal self. Did he care whether his body  would live or die? Did he live for the enjoyments of the flesh? Did he  \"play to the gallery\" and act and speak for any worldly gain or low  considerations? No! He had forgotten the interests of the flesh in his  earnest enthusiasm in the cause of the Eternal Spirit. He was not moved  by any dammed sense of prudence and caution. He drew the \"Motives\" that  energised his Will-Power in the life of Action from _Within_. Nothing  from outside, nothing from the world of lower attractions could in the  least swerve his inner determination or unbalance his brain. Do you or  can you prepare yourself to follow in his steps? Then my first point and  the most infallible method of awakening your Will-Power is this:    (_a_) Teach Thy Will to \"Resist and Renounce.\" Strengthen your Will-Power  by Renunciation. By Resistance is not meant outer resistance or  aggressiveness. I find that all the modern teachers of Hypnotism advise  their students to develop Will-Power by exercising it upon others. This  is placing the cart before the horse. We Hindus know better. No; by  Resistance to and Repression of your lower Desire-Nature is meant letting  the more difficult choice exercise its compelling and restraining power  over the easier one. Says Sister Nivedita: \"The Indian ideal is that man  whose lower mind is so perfectly under control that he can at any moment  plunge into the thought-ocean and remain there at will without the least  possibility of a sudden break and unexpected return to the life of the  senses.\" Yes, your interests should be within and not without. _You must  rise above all personal impulse_. Even in this world you find that men of  distinction, fame and honour have achieved recognition by practising a  little _self-denial_, which is a \"milder\" form of absolute Renunciation  as practised by true Sanyasis. The man who can work at his aim with  perseverance and denies himself the mess of pottage of present indulgence  in view of some future gain develops Will-Power. So in training your Will  to 'resist', you must, as a first step, sternly refuse to indulge  impulses, desires and tendencies not in consonance with the dictates of  your Higher Self. You must actually go out of your way and \"deny\"  yourself the little or great \"comforts\" to which you are or have been  accustomed. The strongest-willed man is he who has the greatest control  over his inclinations, and who can 'force' himself to do such things as  he is naturally most inclined to do. This is a characteristic which  cannot be developed in a day. There are some children and even grown-up  men and women who mistake their 'obstinacy' for Will-Power. They want a  thing and when they do not get it they tear their hair, gnash their  teeth, stamp their feet and fly into a terrible passion. Since people  think that these uncontrolled creatures are strong-willed while all that  you could say about them is that _they are utter slaves to their  desires_. You must practise self-denial in fifty different ways and force  yourself to do certain things, 'little and big,' every day purely for  developing this power of Resistance. No short-cut to this. Some children  develop it unconsciously by 'forcing' themselves to study when they might  play, and by applying themselves to such studies as are dry and  uninteresting to them they thus practise voluntary Concentration.  Practise self-denial in every possible way. Cut off such luxuries as you  think \"you must have.\" \"Take a cold bath when you would prefer a warm  one. Arise promptly in the morning. Make yourself call upon people you  have avoided. Stand up in a street car when you would prefer sitting;  walk when it is convenient to ride. Make engagements with yourself and  keep them. Promise yourself that when you see something to be done you  will spring at once to it however strong may be the inclination to put it  off awhile\" and back of it all let there be the auto-suggestion: \"_I am  doing all these hard things in order to build up my Will-Power and each  time 'I' succeed in forcing 'my mind' to do a thing or not to do it I  make the next victory easier and my Will-Power stronger_.\" Of course the  above is only a hint as to your line of practise.    (_b_) You must not give yourself such hard tasks of Self-Development  as might be too heavy and beyond the present"]]]
