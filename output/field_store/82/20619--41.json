Isadora Duncan, Gordon Craig, Maeterlinck, Scriabine are perhaps  too remote from the spirit of democracy, too tinged with old-world  aestheticism, to be included in this particular category, but all  are image-breakers, liberators, and have played their part in the  preparation of the field for an art of democracy.    To the architect falls the task, in the new dispensation, of providing  the appropriate material environment for its new life. If he holds the  old ideas and cherishes the old convictions current before the war  he can do nothing but reproduce their forms and fashions; for  architecture, in the last analysis, is only the handwriting of  consciousness on space, and materialism has written there already all  that it has to tell of its failure to satisfy the mind and heart of  man. However beautiful old forms may seem to him they will declare  their inadequacy to generations free of that mist of familiarity which  now makes life obscure. If, on the other hand, submitting himself  to the inspiration of the _demos_ he experiences a change of  consciousness, he will become truly and newly creative.    His problem, in other words, is not to interpret democracy in terms  of existing idioms, be they classic or romantic, but to experience  democracy in his heart and let it create and determine its new forms  through him. It is not for him to _impose_, it is for him to be  _imposed upon_.      \"The passive Master lent his hand      To the vast soul that o'er him planned\"    says Emerson in _The Problem_, a poem, which seems particularly  addressed to architects, and which every one of them would do well to  learn by heart.    If he is at a loss to know where to go and what to do in order to be  played upon by these great forces let him direct his attention to  the army and the army camps. Here the spirit of democracy is  already incarnate. These soldiers, violently shaken free from their  environment, stripped of all but the elemental necessities of life;  facing a sinister destiny beyond a human-shark-infested ocean,  are today the fortunate of earth by reason of their realization of  brotherhood, not as a beautiful theory, but as a blessed fact of  experience. They will come back with ideas that they cannot utter,  with memories that they cannot describe; they will have dreamed dreams  and seen visions, and their hearts will stir to potencies for which  materialism has not even a name.    The future of the country will be in their young hands. Will they  re-create, from its ruins, the faithless and loveless feudalism  from which the war set them free? No, they will seek only for  self-expression, the expression of that aroused and indwelling spirit  which shall create the new, the true democracy. And because it is a  spiritual thing it will come clothed in beauty; that is, it will find  its supreme expression through the forms of art. The architect who  assists in the emprise of weaving this garment will be supremely  blessed, but only he who has kept the vigil with prayer and fasting  will be supremely qualified.          III    AFTER THE WAR      \"When the old world is sterile    And the ages are effete,    He will from wrecks and sediment    The fairer world complete.\"          _The World Soul_. Emerson.    He whom the World Soul \"forbids to despair\" cannot but hope; and he  who hopes tries ever to imagine that \"fairer world\" yearning for birth  beyond this interval of blood and tears. Prophecy, to all but the  anointed, is dangerous and uncertain, but even so, the author cannot  forbear attempting to prevision the architecture likely to arise from  the wrecks and sediment left by the war. As a basis for this forecast  it is necessary first of all briefly to classify the expression of the  building impulse from what may be called the psychological point of  view.    Broadly speaking, there are not five orders of architecture--nor  fifty--but only two: _Arranged_ and _Organic_. These correspond to the  two terms of that \"inevitable duality\" which bisects life. Talent and  genius, reason and intuition, bromide and sulphite are some of the  names we know them by.    Arranged architecture is reasoned and artificial; produced by talent,  governed by taste. Organic architecture, on the other hand, is the  product of some obscure inner necessity for self-expression which  is sub-conscious. It is as though Nature herself, through some human  organ of her activity, had addressed herself to the service of the  sons and daughters of men.    Arranged architecture in its finest manifestations is the product of  a pride, a knowledge, a competence, a confidence staggering to behold.  It seems to say of the works of Nature, \"I'll show you a trick worth  two of that.\" For the subtlety of Nature's geometry, and for her  infinite variety and unexpectedness, Arranged architecture substitutes  a Euclidian system of straight lines and (for the most part) circular  curves, assembled and arranged according to a definite logic of  its own. It is created but not creative; it is imagined but not  imaginative. Organic architecture is both creative and imaginative. It  is non-Euclidian in the sense that it is higher-dimensional--that is,  it suggests extension in directions and into regions where the spirit  finds itself at home, but of which the senses give no report to the  brain.    [Illustration: PLATE VIII. IMAGINATIVE SKETCH BY HENRY P. KIRBY]    To make the whole thing clearer it may be said that Arranged and  Organic architecture bear much the same relation to one another that  a piano bears to a violin. A piano is an instrument that does not give  forth discords if one follows the rules. A violin requires absolutely  an ear--an inner rectitude. It has a way of betraying the man of  talent and glorifying the genius, becoming one with his body and his  soul.    Of course it stands to reason that there is not always a hard and fast  differentiation between these two orders of architecture, but there  is one sure way by which each may be recognized and known. If the  function appears to have created the form, and if everywhere the  form follows the function, changing as that changes, the building is  Organic; if on the contrary, \"the house confines the spirit,\" if the  building presents not a face but however beautiful a mask, it is an  example of Arranged architecture.    The Gothic cathedrals of the \"Heart of Europe\"--now the place of  Armageddon--represent the most perfect and powerful incarnation of  the Organic spirit in architecture. After the decadence of mediaeval  feudalism--synchronous with that of monasticism--the Arranged  architecture of the Renaissance acquired the ascendant; this was  coincident with the rise of humanism, when life became increasingly  secular. During the post-Renaissance, or scientific period, of which  the war probably marks the close, there has been a confusion of  tongues; architecture has spoken only alien or dead languages, learned  by rote.    But in so far as it is anything at all, aesthetically, our architecture  is Arranged, so if only by the operation of the law of opposites, or  alternation, we might reasonably expect the next manifestation to  be Organic. There are other and better reasons, however, for such  expectancy.    Organic architecture is ever a flower of the religious spirit. When  the soul draws near to the surface of life, as it did in the two  mystic centuries of the Middle Ages, it _organizes_ life; and  architecture, along, with the other arts becomes truly creative. The  informing force comes not so much _from_ man as _through_ him. After  the war that spirit of brotherhood, born in the camps--as Christ was  born in a manger--and bred on the battlefields and in the trenches of  Europe, is likely to take on all the attributes of a new religion of  humanity, prompting men to such heroisms and renunciations, exciting  in them such psychic sublimations, as have characterized the great  religious renewals of time past.    If this happens it is bound to write itself on space in an  architecture beautiful and new; one which \"takes its shape and  sun-color\" not from the niggardly mind, but from the opulent heart.  This architecture will of necessity be organic, the product not of  self-assertive personalities, but the work of the \"Patient Daemon\"  organizing the nation into a spiritual democracy.    The author is aware that in this point of view there is little of  the \"scientific spirit\"; but science fails to reckon with the soul.  Science advances facing backward, so what prevision can it have of a  miraculous and divinely inspired future--or for the matter of that,  of any future at all? The old methods and categories will no longer  answer; the orderly course of evolution has been violently interrupted  by the earthquake of the war; igneous action has superseded aqueous  action. The casements of the human mind look out no longer upon  familiar hills and valleys, but on a stark, strange, devastated  landscape, the ploughed land of some future harvest of the years.  It is the end of the Age, the _Kali Yuga_--the completion of a major  cycle; but all cycles follow the same sequence: after winter, Spring;  and after the Iron Age, the Golden.    The specific features of this organic, divinely inspired architecture  of the Golden Age cannot of course be discerned by any one, any more  than the manner in which the Great Mystery will present itself anew to  consciousness. The most imaginative artist can imagine only in  terms of the already-existent; he can speak only the language he has  learned. If that language has been derived from mediaevalism, he  will let his fancy soar after the manner of Henry Kirby, in his  _Imaginative Sketches_; if on the contrary he has learned to think in  terms of the classic vernacular, Otto Rieth's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12629"],[0,"Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech (#6)"],[1," sound is  not, properly considered, an element of speech at all, for speech is a  significant function and the sound as such has no significance. It  happens occasionally that the single sound is an independently  significant element (such as French _a_ \"has\" and _a_ \"to\" or Latin _i_  \"go!\"), but such cases are fortuitous coincidences between individual  sound and significant word. The coincidence is apt to be fortuitous not  only in theory but in point of actual historic fact; thus, the instances  cited are merely reduced forms of originally fuller phonetic  groups--Latin _habet_ and _ad_ and Indo-European _ei_ respectively. If  language is a structure and if the significant elements of language are  the bricks of the structure, then the sounds of speech can only be  compared to the unformed and unburnt clay of which the bricks are  fashioned. In this chapter we shall have nothing further to do with  sounds as sounds.    The true, significant elements of language are generally sequences of  sounds that are either words, significant parts of words, or word  groupings. What distinguishes each of these elements is that it is the  outward sign of a specific idea, whether of a single concept or image or  of a number of such concepts or images definitely connected into a  whole. The single word may or may not be the simplest significant  element we have to deal with. The English words _sing_, _sings_,  _singing_, _singer_ each conveys a perfectly definite and intelligible  idea, though the idea is disconnected and is therefore functionally of  no practical value. We recognize immediately that these words are of two  sorts. The first word, _sing_, is an indivisible phonetic entity  conveying the notion of a certain specific activity. The other words all  involve the same fundamental notion but, owing to the addition of other  phonetic elements, this notion is given a particular twist that modifies  or more closely defines it. They represent, in a sense, compounded  concepts that have flowered from the fundamental one. We may, therefore,  analyze the words _sings_, _singing_, and _singer_ as binary expressions  involving a fundamental concept, a concept of subject matter (_sing_),  and a further concept of more abstract order--one of person, number,  time, condition, function, or of several of these combined.    If we symbolize such a term as _sing_ by the algebraic formula A, we  shall have to symbolize such terms as _sings_ and _singer_ by the  formula A + b.[1] The element A may be either a complete and independent  word (_sing_) or the fundamental substance, the so-called root or  stem[2] or \"radical element\" (_sing-_) of a word. The element b (_-s_,  _-ing_, _-er_) is the indicator of a subsidiary and, as a rule, a more  abstract concept; in the widest sense of the word \"form,\" it puts upon  the fundamental concept a formal limitation. We may term it a  \"grammatical element\" or affix. As we shall see later on, the  grammatical element or the grammatical increment, as we had better put  it, need not be suffixed to the radical element. It may be a prefixed  element (like the _un-_ of _unsingable_), it may be inserted into the  very body of the stem (like the _n_ of the Latin _vinco_ \"I conquer\" as  contrasted with its absence in _vici_ \"I have conquered\"), it may be the  complete or partial repetition of the stem, or it may consist of some  modification of the inner form of the stem (change of vowel, as in  _sung_ and _song_; change of consonant as in _dead_ and _death_; change  of accent; actual abbreviation). Each and every one of these types of  grammatical element or modification has this peculiarity, that it may  not, in the vast majority of cases, be used independently but needs to  be somehow attached to or welded with a radical element in order to  convey an intelligible notion. We had better, therefore, modify our  formula, A + b, to A + (b), the round brackets symbolizing the  incapacity of an element to stand alone. The grammatical element,  moreover, is not only non-existent except as associated with a radical  one, it does not even, as a rule, obtain its measure of significance  unless it is associated with a particular class of radical elements.  Thus, the _-s_ of English _he hits_ symbolizes an utterly different  notion from the _-s_ of _books_, merely because _hit_ and _book_ are  differently classified as to function. We must hasten to observe,  however, that while the radical element may, on occasion, be identical  with the word, it does not follow that it may always, or even  customarily, be used as a word. Thus, the _hort-_ \"garden\" of such Latin  forms as _hortus_, _horti_, and _horto_ is as much of an abstraction,  though one yielding a more easily apprehended significance, than the  _-ing_ of _singing_. Neither exists as an independently intelligible and  satisfying element of speech. Both the radical element, as such, and the  grammatical element, therefore, are reached only by a process of  abstraction. It seemed proper to symbolize _sing-er_ as A + (b);  _hort-us_ must be symbolized as (A) + (b).    [Footnote 1: We shall reserve capitals for radical elements.]    [Footnote 2: These words are not here used in a narrowly technical  sense.]    So far, the first speech element that we have found which we can say  actually \"exists\" is the word. Before defining the word, however, we  must look a little more closely at the type of word that is illustrated  by _sing_. Are we, after all, justified in identifying it with a radical  element? Does it represent a simple correspondence between concept and  linguistic expression? Is the element _sing-_, that we have abstracted  from _sings_, _singing_, and _singer_ and to which we may justly ascribe  a general unmodified conceptual value, actually the same linguistic fact  as the word _sing_? It would almost seem absurd to doubt it, yet a  little reflection only is needed to convince us that the doubt is  entirely legitimate. The word _sing_ cannot, as a matter of fact, be  freely used to refer to its own conceptual content. The existence of  such evidently related forms as _sang_ and _sung_ at once shows that it  cannot refer to past time, but that, for at least an important part of  its range of usage, it is limited to the present. On the other hand, the  use of _sing_ as an \"infinitive\" (in such locutions as _to sing_ and _he  will sing_) does indicate that there is a fairly strong tendency for the  word _sing_ to represent the full, untrammeled amplitude of a specific  concept. Yet if _sing_ were, in any adequate sense, the fixed  expression of the unmodified concept, there should be no room for such  vocalic aberrations as we find in _sang_ and _sung_ and _song_, nor  should we find _sing_ specifically used to indicate present time for all  persons but one (third person singular _sings_).    The truth of the matter is that _sing_ is a kind of twilight word,  trembling between the status of a true radical element and that of a  modified word of the type of _singing_. Though it has no outward sign to  indicate that it conveys more than a generalized idea, we do feel that  there hangs about it a variable mist of added value. The formula A does  not seem to represent it so well as A + (0). We might suspect _sing_ of  belonging to the A + (b) type, with the reservation that the (b) had  vanished. This report of the \"feel\" of the word is far from fanciful,  for historical evidence does, in all earnest, show that _sing_ is in  origin a number of quite distinct words, of type A + (b), that have  pooled their separate values. The (b) of each of these has gone as a  tangible phonetic element; its force, however, lingers on in weakened  measure. The _sing_ of _I sing_ is the correspondent of the Anglo-Saxon  _singe_; the infinitive _sing_, of _singan_; the imperative _sing_ of  _sing_. Ever since the breakdown of English forms that set in about the  time of the Norman Conquest, our language has been straining towards the  creation of simple concept-words, unalloyed by formal connotations, but  it has not yet succeeded in this, apart, possibly, from isolated adverbs  and other elements of that sort. Were the typical unanalyzable word of  the language truly a pure concept-word (type A) instead of being of a  strangely transitional type (type A + [0]), our _sing_ and _work_ and  _house_ and thousands of others would compare with the genuine  radical-words of numerous other languages.[3] Such a radical-word, to  take a random example, is the Nootka[4] word _hamot_ \"bone.\" Our English  correspondent is only superficially comparable. _Hamot_ means \"bone\" in  a quite indefinite sense; to our English word clings the notion of  singularity. The Nootka Indian can convey the idea of plurality, in one  of several ways, if he so desires, but he does not need to; _hamot_ may  do for either singular or plural, should no interest happen to attach to  the distinction. As soon as we say \"bone\" (aside from its secondary  usage to indicate material), we not merely specify the nature of the  object but we imply, whether we will or no, that there is but one of  these objects to be considered. And this increment of value makes all  the difference.    [Footnote 3: It is not a question of the general isolating character of  such languages as Chinese (see Chapter VI). Radical-words may and do  occur in languages of all varieties, many of them of a high degree of  complexity.]    [Footnote 4: Spoken by a group of Indian tribes in Vancouver Island.]    We now know of four distinct formal types of word: A (Nootka _hamot_);  A + (0) (_sing_, _bone_); A + (b) (_singing_); (A) + (b) (Latin  _hortus_). There is but one other type that is fundamentally possible:  A + B, the union of two (or more) independently occurring radical  elements into a single term. Such a word is the compound _fire-engine_  or a Sioux form equivalent to _eat-stand_ (i.e., \"to eat while  standing\"). It frequently"]]]
