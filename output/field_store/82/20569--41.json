The bogus message remained to be explained, and the  assault in the square, as did the purpose of the burglar to whom gold  and silver plate made no appeal. More important even than these points  were the dead man's extraordinary words: \"Fire-Tongue\"--\"Nicol Brinn.\"  Finally and conclusively, he had detected the note of danger outside and  inside the house; and now as he began to cross the square it touched him  again intimately.    He looked up at the darkened sky. A black cloud was moving slowly  overhead, high above the roof of the late Sir Charles Abingdon; and  as he watched its stealthy approach it seemed to Paul Harley to be the  symbol of that dread in which latterly Sir Charles's life had lain,  beneath which he had died, and which now was stretching out, mysterious  and menacing, over himself.        CHAPTER IV. INTRODUCING MR. NICOL BRINN    At about nine o'clock on the same evening, a man stood at a large window  which overlooked Piccadilly and the Green Park. The room to which the  window belonged was justly considered one of the notable sights of  London and doubtless would have received suitable mention in the \"Blue  Guide\" had the room been accessible to the general public. It was,  on the contrary, accessible only to the personal friends of Mr. Nicol  Brinn. As Mr. Nicol Brinn had a rarely critical taste in friendship,  none but a fortunate few had seen the long room with its two large  windows overlooking Piccadilly.    The man at the window was interested in a car which, approaching from  the direction of the Circus, had slowed down immediately opposite and  now was being turned, the chauffeur's apparent intention being to pull  up at the door below. He had seen the face of the occupant and had  recognized it even from that elevation. He was interested; and since  only unusual things aroused any semblance of interest in the man who now  stood at the window, one might have surmised that there was something  unusual about the present visitor, or in his having decided to call at  those chambers; and that such was indeed his purpose an upward glance  which he cast in the direction of the balcony sufficiently proved.    The watcher, who had been standing in a dark recess formed by the  presence of heavy velvet curtains draped before the window, now opened  the curtains and stepped into the lighted room. He was a tall, lean man  having straight, jet-black hair, a sallow complexion, and the features  of a Sioux. A long black cigar protruded aggressively from the left  corner of his mouth. His hands were locked behind him and his large and  quite expressionless blue eyes stared straight across the room at the  closed door with a dreamy and vacant regard. His dinner jacket fitted  him so tightly that it might have been expected at any moment to split  at the seams. As if to precipitate the catastrophe, he wore it buttoned.    There came a rap at the door.    \"In!\" said the tall man.    The door opened silently and a manservant appeared. He was spotlessly  neat and wore his light hair cropped close to the skull. His  fresh-coloured face was quite as expressionless as that of his master;  his glance possessed no meaning. Crossing to the window, he extended a  small salver upon which lay a visiting card.    \"In!\" repeated the tall man, looking down at the card.    His servant silently retired, and following a short interval rapped  again upon the door, opened it, and standing just inside the room  announced: \"Mr. Paul Harley.\"    The door being quietly closed behind him, Paul Harley stood staring  across the room at Nicol Brinn. At this moment the contrast between  the types was one to have fascinated a psychologist. About Paul Harley,  eagerly alert, there was something essentially British. Nicol Brinn,  without being typical, was nevertheless distinctly a product of the  United States. Yet, despite the stoic mask worn by Mr. Brinn, whose  lack-lustre eyes were so unlike the bright gray eyes of his visitor,  there existed, if not a physical, a certain spiritual affinity between  the two; both were men of action.    Harley, after that one comprehensive glance, the photographic glance of  a trained observer, stepped forward impulsively, hand outstretched. \"Mr.  Brinn,\" he said, \"we have never met before, and it was good of you to  wait in for me. I hope my telephone message has not interfered with your  plans for the evening?\"    Nicol Brinn, without change of pose, no line of the impassive face  altering, shot out a large, muscular hand, seized that of Paul Harley  in a tremendous grip, and almost instantly put his hand behind his back  again. \"Had no plans,\" he replied, in a high, monotonous voice; \"I was  bored stiff. Take the armchair.\"    Paul Harley sat down, but in the restless manner of one who has urgent  business in hand and who is impatient of delay. Mr. Brinn stooped to a  coffee table which stood upon the rug before the large open fireplace.  \"I am going to offer you a cocktail,\" he said.    \"I shall accept your offer,\" returned Harley, smiling. \"The 'N. B.  cocktail' has a reputation which extends throughout the clubs of the  world.\"    Nicol Brinn, exhibiting the swift adroitness of that human dodo, the  New York bartender, mixed the drinks. Paul Harley watched him, meanwhile  drumming his fingers restlessly upon the chair arm.    \"Here's success,\" he said, \"to my mission.\"    It was an odd toast, but Mr. Brinn merely nodded and drank in silence.  Paul Harley set his glass down and glanced about the singular apartment  of which he had often heard and which no man could ever tire of  examining.    In this room the poles met, and the most remote civilizations of the  world rubbed shoulders with modernity. Here, encased, were a family of  snow-white ermine from Alaska and a pair of black Manchurian leopards.  A flying lemur from the Pelews contemplated swooping upon the head of  a huge tigress which glared with glassy eyes across the place at the  snarling muzzle of a polar bear. Mycenaean vases and gold death masks  stood upon the same shelf as Venetian goblets, and the mummy of an  Egyptian priestess of the thirteenth dynasty occupied a sarcophagus upon  the top of which rested a basrelief found in one of the shrines of the  Syrian fish goddess Derceto, at Ascalon.    Arrowheads of the Stone Age and medieval rapiers were ranged alongside  some of the latest examples of the gunsmith's art. There were elephants'  tusks and Mexican skulls; a stone jar of water from the well of Zem-Zem,  and an ivory crucifix which had belonged to Torquemada. A mat of human  hair from Borneo overlay a historical and unique rug woven in Ispahan  and entirely composed of fragments of Holy Carpets from the Kaaba at  Mecca.    \"I take it,\" said Mr. Brinn, suddenly, \"that you are up against a stiff  proposition.\"    Paul Harley, accepting a cigarette from an ebony box (once the property  of Henry VIII) which the speaker had pushed across the coffee table in  his direction, stared up curiously into the sallow, aquiline face. \"You  are right. But how did you know?\"    \"You look that way. Also--you were followed. Somebody knows you've come  here.\"    Harley leaned forward, resting one hand upon the table. \"I know I was  followed,\" he said, sternly. \"I was followed because I have entered  upon the biggest case of my career.\" He paused and smiled in a very grim  fashion. \"A suspicion begins to dawn upon my mind that if I fail it will  also be my last case. You understand me?\"    \"I understand absolutely,\" replied Nicol Brinn. \"These are dull days.  It's meat and drink to me to smell big danger.\"    Paul Harley lighted a cigarette and watched the speaker closely the  while. His expression, as he did so, was an odd one. Two courses were  open to him, and he was mentally debating their respective advantages.    \"I have come to you to-night, Mr. Brinn,\" he said finally, \"to ask you a  certain question. Unless the theory upon which I am working is entirely  wrong, then, supposing that you are in a position to answer my question  I am logically compelled to suppose, also, that you stand in peril of  your life.\"    \"Good,\" said Mr. Brinn. \"I was getting sluggish.\" In three long strides  he crossed the room and locked the door. \"I don't doubt Hoskins's  honesty,\" he explained, reading the inquiry in Harley's eyes, \"but an A1  intelligence doesn't fold dress pants at thirty-nine.\"    Only one very intimate with the taciturn speaker could have perceived  any evidence of interest in that imperturbable character. But Nicol  Brinn took his cheroot between his fingers, quickly placed a cone of ash  in a little silver tray (the work of Benvenuto Cellini), and replaced  the cheroot not in the left but in the right corner of his mouth. He was  excited.    \"You are out after one of the big heads of the crook world,\" he said.  \"He knows it and he's trailing you. My luck's turned. How can I help?\"    Harley stood up, facing Mr. Brinn. \"He knows it, as you say,\" he  replied, \"and I hold my life in my hands. But from your answer to the  question which I have come here to-night to ask you, I shall conclude  whether or not your danger at the moment is greater than mine.\"    \"Good,\" said Nicol Brinn.    In that unique room, at once library and museum, amid relics of a  hundred ages, spoil of the chase, the excavator, and the scholar, these  two faced each other; and despite the peaceful quiet of the apartment  up to which as a soothing murmur stole the homely sounds of Piccadilly,  each saw in the other's eyes recognition of a deadly peril. It was a  queer, memorable moment.    \"My question is simple but strange,\" said Paul Harley. \"It is this: What  do you know of 'Fire-Tongue'?\"        CHAPTER V. THE GATES OF HELL    If Paul Harley had counted upon the word \"Fire-Tongue\" to have a  dramatic"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11602"],[0,"The World of Ice (#6)"],[1," memories.    At first the prospect that met their ardent gaze was not calculated to  excite excessive admiration. There were only a few masses of low ice  floating about in various directions. The wind was steady, but light,  and seemed as if it would speedily fall altogether. Gradually the  _blink_ on the horizon (as the light haze always distinguishable above  ice, or snow-covered land, is called) resolved itself into a long white  line of ice, which seemed to grow larger as the ship neared it, and in  about two hours more they were fairly in the midst of the pack, which  was fortunately loose enough to admit of the vessel being navigated  through the channels of open water. Soon after, the sun broke out in  cloudless splendour, and the wind fell entirely, leaving the ocean in a  dead calm.    \"Let's go to the fore-top, Tom,\" said Fred, seizing his friend by the  arm and hastening to the shrouds.    In a few seconds they were seated alone on the little platform at the  top of the fore-mast, just where it is connected with the fore-top-mast,  and from this elevated position they gazed in silent delight upon the  fairy-like scene.    Those who have never stood at the mast-head of a ship at sea in a dead  calm cannot comprehend the feeling of intense solitude that fills the  mind in such a position. There is nothing analogous to it on land. To  stand on the summit of a tower and look down on the busy multitude below  is not the same, for there the sounds are quite different in _tone_, and  signs of life are visible all over the distant country, while cries from  afar reach the ear, as well as those from below. But from the mast-head  you hear only the few subdued sounds under your feet--all beyond is  silence; you behold only the small, oval-shaped platform that is your  _world_--beyond lies the calm desolate ocean. On deck you cannot realize  this feeling, for there sails and yards tower above you, and masts, and  boats, and cordage intercept your view; but from above you _take in_ the  intense minuteness of your home at a single glance--you stand aside, as  it were, and in some measure comprehend the insignificance of the  _thing_ to which you have committed your life.    The scene witnessed by our friends at the masthead of the _Dolphin_ on  this occasion was surpassingly beautiful. Far as the eye could stretch  the sea was covered with islands and fields of ice of every conceivable  shape. Some rose in little peaks and pinnacles, some floated in the form  of arches and domes, some were broken and rugged like the ruins of old  border strongholds, while others were flat and level like fields of  white marble; and so calm was it, that the ocean in which they floated  seemed like a groundwork of polished steel, in which the sun shone with  dazzling brilliancy. The tops of the icy islets were pure white, and the  sides of the higher ones of a delicate blue colour, which gave to the  scene a transparent lightness that rendered it pre-eminently fairy-like.    \"It far surpasses anything I ever conceived,\" ejaculated Singleton after  a long silence. \"No wonder that authors speak of scenes being  indescribable. Does it not seem like a dream, Fred?\"    \"Tom,\" replied Fred earnestly, \"I've been trying to fancy myself in  another world, and I have almost succeeded. When I look long and  intently at the ice, I get almost to believe that these are streets, and  palaces, and cathedrals. I never felt so strong a desire to have wings  that I might fly from one island to another, and go floating in and out  and round about those blue caves and sparkling pinnacles.\"    \"It's a curious fancy, Fred, but not unnatural.\"    \"Tom,\" said Fred after another long silence, \"has not the thought  occurred to you that God made it all?\"    \"Some such thought did cross my mind, Fred, for a moment, but it soon  passed away. Is it not _very_ strange that the idea of the Creator is so  seldom and so slightly connected with his works in our minds?\"    Again there was a long silence. Both youths had a desire to continue the  conversation, and yet each felt an unaccountable reluctance to renew it.  Neither of them distinctly understood that the natural heart is enmity  against God, and that, until he is converted by the Holy Spirit, man  neither loves to think of his Maker nor to speak of him.    While they sat thus musing, a breeze dimmed the surface of the sea, and  the _Dolphin_, which had hitherto lain motionless in one of the numerous  canals, began slowly to advance between the islands of ice. The breeze  freshened, and rendered it impossible to avoid an occasional collision  with the floating masses; but the good ship was well armed for the  fight, and, although she quivered under the blows, and once or twice  recoiled, she pushed her way through the pack gallantly. In the course  of an hour or two they were once more in comparatively clear water.    Suddenly there came a cry from the crow's-nest--\"There she blows!\"    Instantly every man in the ship sprang to his feet as if he had received  an electric shock.    \"Where away?\" shouted the captain.    \"On the lee-bow, sir,\" replied the look-out.    From a state of comparative quiet and repose the ship was now thrown  into a condition of the utmost animation, and, apparently, unmeaning,  confusion. The sight of a whale acted on the spirits of the men like  wild-fire.    \"There she blows!\" sang out the man at the masthead again.    \"Are we keeping right for her?\" asked the captain.    \"Keep her away a bit; steady!\" replied the lookout.    \"Steady it is!\" answered the man at the wheel.    \"Call all hands and get the boats out, Mr. Bolton,\" said the captain.    \"All hands ahoy!\" shouted the mate in a tempestuous voice, while the men  rushed to their respective stations.    \"Boat-steerers, get your boats ready.\"    \"Ay, ay, sir.\"    \"There go flukes,\" cried the look-out, as the whale dived and tossed its  flukes--that is, its tail--in the air, not more than a mile on the  lee-bow; \"she's heading right for the ship.\"    \"Down with the helm!\" roared the captain. \"Mr. Bolton, brace up the  mizzen-top-sail! Hoist and swing the boats! Lower away!\"    In another moment three boats struck the water, and their respective  crews tumbled tumultuously into them. Fred and Singleton sprang into the  stern-sheets of the captain's boat just as it pushed off, and, in less  than five minutes, the three boats were bounding over the sea in the  direction of the whale like race-horses. Every man did his best, and the  tough oars bent like hoops as each boat's crew strove to outstrip the  others.        CHAPTER IV.    _The chase and the battle--The chances and dangers of whaling  war--Buzzby dives for his life and saves it--So does the whale and loses  it--An anxious night, which terminates happily, though with a heavy  loss._      The chase was not a long one, for, while the boats were rowing swiftly  towards the whale, the whale was, all unconsciously, swimming towards  the boats.    \"Give way now, lads, give way,\" said the captain in a suppressed voice;  \"bend your backs, boys, and don't let the mate beat us.\"    The three boats flew over the sea, as the men strained their muscles to  the utmost, and for some time they kept almost in line, being pretty  equally matched; but gradually the captain shot ahead, and it became  evident that his harpooner, Amos Parr, was to have the honour of  harpooning the first whale. Amos pulled the bow-oar, and behind him was  the tub with the line coiled away, and the harpoon bent on to it. Being  an experienced whaleman, he evinced no sign of excitement, save in the  brilliancy of his dark eye and a very slight flush on his bronzed face.  They had now neared the whale and ceased rowing for a moment, lest they  should miss it when down.    \"There she goes!\" cried Fred in a tone of intense excitement, as he  caught sight of the whale not more than fifty yards ahead of the boat.    \"Now, boys,\" cried the captain, in a hoarse whisper, \"spring hard--lay  back hard, I say--_stand up_!\"    At the last word Amos-Parr sprang to his feet and seized the harpoon,  the boat ran right on to the whale's back, and in an instant Parr sent  two irons to the hitches into the fish.    \"Stern all!\" The men backed their oars with all their might, in order to  avoid the flukes of the wounded monster of the deep, as it plunged down  headlong into the sea, taking the line out perpendicularly like  lightning. This was a moment of great danger. The friction of the line  as it passed the loggerhead was so great that Parr had to keep  constantly pouring water on it to prevent its catching fire. A hitch in  the line at that time, as it flew out of the tub, or any accidental  entanglement, would have dragged the boat and crew right down: many such  fatal accidents occur to whalers, and many a poor fellow has had a foot  or an arm torn off, or been dragged overboard and drowned, in  consequence of getting entangled. One of the men stood ready with a  small hatchet to cut the line in a moment, if necessary; for whales  sometimes run out all that is in a boat at the first plunge, and should  none of the other boats be at hand to lend a second line to attach to  the one nearly expended, there is nothing for it but to cut. On the  present occasion, however, none of these accidents befell the men of the  captain's boat. The line ran all clear, and long before it was  exhausted the whale ceased to descend, and the _slack_ was hauled  rapidly in.    Meanwhile the other boats pulled up to the scene of action, and prepared  to strike the instant the fish should rise to the surface. It appeared,  suddenly, not twenty yards from the mate's boat, where Buzzby, who was  harpooner, stood in the bow ready to give it the iron.    \"Spring, lads, spring!\" shouted the mate, as the whale spouted into the  air a thick stream of water. The boat dashed up, and Buzzby planted his  harpoon vigorously. Instantly the broad flukes of"]]]
