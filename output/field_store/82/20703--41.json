[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14064"],[0,"Mohammed, The Prophet of Islam (#6)"],[1," victory. The  Moslems returned to Medinah, carrying in triumph many prisoners, and  considerable booty. The revelation produced after this, speaks of it  as the \"Day of deliverance,\" and Mohammed rejoices because the stigma  of powerlessness to show evidence of miracle in his life, is removed,  for he accounts for the victory by direct intervention of God in his  favour. The effect of the victory on the surrounding tribes was highly  favourable to the prophet. Many of the chiefs sought to ally  themselves to him, but he received their offers solely on condition  that they would embrace Islam. Few accepted, and those who did not  before long regretted it.    For about a year after his success, his power and influence increased,  until the whole of the tribes between Mecca and Medinah had been won  over. Then came a defeat. The Meccans had been nursing their  bitterness, and at last, just over two years after the victory of  Badr, it found its outlet in an expedition again Mohammed. The Moslem  forces were rallied, and under the prophet's leadership sallied forth  to meet the Meccans. A fierce battle ensued, in which at first the  Moslems had the advantage, and the Meccans were forced to fly. But  they had learned many lessons in the fight at Badr, and had posted  some of their cavalry in such a position that, when the Moslem order  was disturbed in their pursuit of the enemy, they made a charge upon  their rear. The fleeing Meccans turned, and the Moslems found  themselves between two attacks. Then came the cry that Mohammed was  killed! Instead of increasing the Moslem disorder by discouragement,  it made them fight more doggedly, for the majority were so committed  to Islam that they cared not for life if their prophet was dead. This  prevented what must otherwise have meant absolute victory on the part  of the Meccans, and a number of them, with Mohammed, who was only  wounded, were able to retire to Medinah. The Meccans were quite  satisfied with the result, considering that the stigma of their defeat  at Badr had been wiped out. Later on, when Mohammed had sufficiently  recovered of his wounds, he made a public appearance in the Mosque,  where he was able to persuade his followers that their apparent defeat  was really a victory! The general who is able to persuade his forces  that there is victory, even where there seems to be defeat, is one who  will inspire them to fight against apparently impossible odds. They  will, indeed, never suffer defeat, but will fight on until annihilated  by capture or death. The secret of success even in the more pacific  engagements of life lies in this principle--to be undaunted in  ardour, in spite of failure; to recognise in failure a step towards  ultimate success. Let a man be possessed with these, and victory is  within his grasp, whether he recognises it or not.    After this, Mohammed did not scruple to employ the system of warfare  by assassination, if warfare it can be called. Some tribes, emboldened  by the report of the Meccan success, began to treat Moslem emissaries  with scant courtesy, and went so far as to murder some. Mohammed  retaliated by sending men to balance the scales in the same criminal  way, particularly in treating with the Jews. An idea had grown up in  his mind that these people had determined to murder him. This, with  matters of minor importance, already referred to, at last led to an  organised attempt to subjugate them. A large, influential tribe was  besieged; their date trees, lands, and property wantonly destroyed.  Eventually the whole tribe surrendered, and were glad to march away  with what possessions their camels could carry. This led to a  combination of other Jewish tribes, which laid siege to Medinah. The  siege was not successful, and barbarous treatment was meted out to the  besiegers. After much skirmishing and general fighting, a number of  the Jews who had been captured were decapitated, while their women and  children were enslaved. Those who were unwilling to embrace Islam,  were compelled to pay tribute. So the prosperity and success of Islam  was assured. The Jews were no longer bold enough to cause the prophet  any anxiety as to the validity of his prophetic claims, nor were they  of a mind that would arouse fear as to their fighting abilities. They  were true descendants of Isaac and Jacob, who were both men of peace,  and were not qualified for success in war against the posterity of the  active warlike Ishmael and Esau.    Freed from all anxiety in this direction, the prophet, realising that  the security of Medinah could never be assured while the Meccans were  opposed to him, began to formulate plans for the conquest of their  city. His first step was to try and conciliate them, with a view to  sending a pilgrim band into the city, but the citizens were far too  cautious and suspicious to allow that. At last, however, they were  prevailed upon to receive his son-in-law, Omar, who succeeded in  persuading a section of the Meccans of the injustice of barring the  Holy Temple to those who, although their enemies, were, after all,  their kinsmen. This led to a treaty, in which Mohammed brought shame  upon his followers because of his concessions. The arrangements were  that for ten years, peace between the prophet and the Meccans should  be maintained, and that within a year a party of the Moslems were to  be allowed to make a pilgrimage to the Kaaba.    The humiliation to which the prophet compelled his followers to submit  gave rise to considerable indignation, which was allayed only when he  himself submitted to the shaving of his head and the offering of  sacrifice. He knew that the humiliation was worthy of the advantage  gained--indeed, it was but the furtherance of his policy, in which no  action that was expedient could possibly be disgraceful. To him such  a treaty involved no sacred obligation to his enemies. He was God's  prophet, and as such was free of all obligation to those who did not  follow him, a principle deeply rooted in Islam, which makes the  violation of all virtuous relations with unbelievers highly  meritorious.          V.--WORLD CONQUEST.      Not long after the treaty with the Meccans, Mohammed revealed the fact  that he had elaborated a scheme of world conquest, by sending  representatives to earthly monarchs of whom he had heard. His  messengers carried letters bearing the seal, \"Mohammed, Prophet of  God,\" and urging the addressees to acknowledge his claims by embracing  Islam. These overtures were in some cases favourably received; in  others with contempt; but, of course, did not lead to compliance with  the demands, except, perhaps, on the part of a few of the rulers of  some Arabic tribes.    The eighth year of the flight is famous in the history of the  prophet's life, because his followers, for the first time, came into  conflict with the forces of the Christian empire. The battle of Mutah  resulted in defeat of the Moslems, and, consequently, details have  been suppressed. It was part of Mohammed's policy to counteract the  demoralising influence of defeat by immediately attempting a fight in  which victory was assured. This, to my mind, justified war on any  pretext or grievance. In this case he conceived the idea of invading  Mecca, and, although minor incidents justify his decision to a slight  degree, his breach of the treaty adds to the evidence that is  derogatory to his character.    The pilgrimage of the year before had been organised by him with the  view of impressing the Meccans of his power, and was decidedly  successful. When he with his ten thousand troops approached the city,  fear caused submission on the part of the leader of the city forces,  and after some slight skirmishing with a section of the community,  which preferred to show active disapproval of the ignominious  surrender, the city was won. Every idolatrous element of the Kaaba  worship was swept away, and, although its pagan associations were  negatived, it was sanctified to the service of Islam, and is still its  only altar. The city was invested with a more sacred significance than  it had ever occupied under the pagan system. It was never again to be  defiled by the spilling of human blood, the prophet insisting upon  this with admirable inconsistency! He showed his gratification in many  acts of statesmanlike condescension, and seems at this time to have  considered himself to be the ruler of all Arabs. Although it is  improbable that Mohammed was aware of it, the significance he attached  to the Holy City, by teaching that the Caaba was a heavenly built  edifice, was to become the means of consolidating his system, in spite  of national and racial distinctions. In its precincts, pilgrims from  India, Persia, China, Russia, Turkey, and other lands where Islam has  its devotees, mingle with the wild Bedouin of the desert in one common  brotherhood, and worship, in unity of faith and form, Allah, the great  and merciful.    After its capture, the fierce warlike Bedouin nomadic tribes made  strenuous and courageous attempts to win back the city, but the Moslem  forces were invariably successful, and, in time, Mohammed returned to  Medinah more triumphant than ever. Eventually Taif, which had  successfully resisted a siege, submitted peacefully to the prophet's  claims, and the subjugation of the whole of Arabia followed.    An ingenious system of taxation was imposed upon all tribes submitting  to Mohammed. The natural prejudice that universally exists against  taxation (!) was overcome, because it was instituted as a religious  rather than a statutory obligation. Thus the regular payments of alms  became one of the five acts of faith imposed upon all believers. The  other acts are: confession of creed, prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage.          VI.--MOHAMMED AND WOMEN.      The prophet's domestic life exerted considerable influence upon his  religion; effects of which are to be seen in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14065"],[0,"The History of the Remarkable Life of John Sheppard (#6)"],[1,"y, I am now       drinking your Health, and a _Bon Repo_ to poor _Joseph_ and       _Anthony_. I am gone a few Days for the Air, but design       speedily to embark; and this Night I am going upon a Mansion       for a Supply; it's a stout Fortification, but what       Difficulties can't I encounter, when, dear _Jack_, you find       that Bars and Chains are but trifling Obstacles in the way of       your Friend and Servant.         JOHN SHEPPARD.         _From my Residence in Terra Australi incognito_.         _P.S._ Pray my Service to Mr. _Or---- di---- y_ and to Mr.       _App---- ee_.    On _Saturday_ the 10th of _October_, _Anthony Lamb_, and _Thomas  Sheppard_, with 95 other Felons were carried from _Newgate_ on  Shipboard, for Transportation to the Plantations; the last begg'd to  have an opportunity given him of taking his final Leave of his Brother  _John_; but this was not to be Granted, and the greatest Favour that  could be obtain'd, was that on the _Sunday_ before they had an Interview  at the _Chapel_, but at such a distance, that they neither saluted, or  shook Hands, and the Reason given for it, was that no Implements might  be convey'd to _Sheppard_ to assist him in making an Escape.    This, Caution seem'd to be absolutely necessary, for it appear'd soon  after that _Sheppard_ found Means to release himself from the Staples to  which he was Chain'd in the Castle, by unlocking a great Padlock with a  Nail, which he had pickt up on the Floor, and endeavour'd to pass up the  Chimney, but was prevented by the stout Iron Bars fix'd in his way, and  wanted nothing but the smallest File to have perfected his Liberty. When  the Assistants of the Prison, came as usual with his Victuals, they  began to examine his Irons; to their great Surprize they found them  loose, and ready to be taken off at Pleasure. Mr. _Pitt_ the Head  Keeper, and his Deputies were sent for, and _Sheppard_ finding this  Attempt entirely frustrated, discover'd to them by what means he had got  them off; and after they had search'd him, found nothing, and Lock'd  and Chain'd him down again; He took up the Nail and unlocked the Padlock  before their Faces; they were struck with the greatest Amazement as  having never heard, or beheld the like before. He was then Handcuff'd,  and more effectually Chain'd.    The next Day, the Reverend Mr. _Purney Ordinary_ of the Place came from  the Country to visit him, and complain'd of the sad Disposition he found  him in, as Meditateing on nothing, but Means to Escape, and declining  the great Duty incumbent upon him to prepare for his approaching Change.  He began to Relent, and said, that since his last Effort had prov'd not  Successful, he would entertain no more Thoughts of that Nature, but  entirely Dispose, and Resign himself to the Mercy of Almighty God, of  whom he hop'd to find forgiveness of his manifold Offences.    He said, that _Edgworth Bess_ and himself kept a little Brandy-shop  together in _Lewkenhors-Lane_, and once sav'd about Thirty Pounds; but  having such an universal Acquaintance amongst Theives, he had frequent  calls to go _Abroad_, and soon quitted that Business, and his Shop.    On _Friday_ the 2d, of _October_ his old Confederate _Joseph Blake_  alias _Blewskin_, was apprehended and taken at a House in St. _Giles's_  Parish by _Jonathan Wild_, and by Justice _Blackerby_ committed to  _Newgate_. _William Field_ who was at his liberty, appearing and making  Oath, that _Blewskin_ together with _John Sheppard_ and himself,  committed the Burglary and Felony in Mr. _Kneebone's_ House, for which  _Sheppard_ was Condemn'd.    The Sessions commencing at the _Old-Bailey_ on _Wednesday_ the 14th of  _October_ following, an Indictment was found against _Blewskin_ for the  same, and he was brought down from _Newgate_ to the _Old-Bailey_ to be  Arraign'd in order to his Tryal; and being in the Yard within the Gate  before the Court: Mr. _Wild_ being there Drinking a glass of Wine with  him, he said to Mr. _Wild_, _You may put in a word for me, as well as  for another Person?_ To which Mr. _Wild_ reply'd, I cannot do it. _You  are certainly a dead Man, and will be tuck'd up very speedily,_ or words  to that effect: Whereupon _Blewskin_ on a sudden seiz'd Mr. _Wild_ by  the Neck, and with a little Clasp Knife he was provided with he cut his  Throat in a very dangerous Manner; and had it not been for a _Muslin_  Stock twisted in several Plaits round his Neck, he had in all likelyhood  succeeded in his barbarous Design before _Ballard_ the Turnkey, who was  at Hand, could have time to lay hold of him; the Villain trumph'd  afterwards in what he had done, Swearing many bloody Oaths, that if he  had murder'd him, he should have died with Satisfaction, and that his  Intention was to have cut off his Head, and thrown it into the Sessions  House-Yard among the Rabble, and Curs'd both his Hand and the Knife for  not Executing it Effectually.    Mr. _Wild_ instantly had the Assistance of three able Surgeons, _viz._  Mr. _Dobbins_, Mr. _Marten_ and Mr. _Coletheart_, who sew'd up the  Wound, and order'd him to his Bed, and he has continu'd ever since, but  in a doubtful State of Recovery.    The Felons on the Common Side of _Newgate_, also animated by  _Sheppard's_ Example, the Night before they were to be Shipt for  Transporation, had cut several Iron Bars assunder, and some of them had  saw'd off their Fetters, the rest Huzzaing, and making Noises, under  pretence of being Joyful that they were to be remov'd on the Morrow, to  prevent the Workmen being heard; and in two Hours time more, if their  Design had not been discover'd, near One Hundred Villians had been let  loose into the World, to have committed new Depredations; nothing was  wanted here but _Sheppard's_ great Judgment, who was by himself in the  strong Room, call'd the _Castle_, meditating his own Deliverance, which  he perfected in the manner following.    On _Thursday_ the 15th of this Instant _October_, at between One and Two  in the Afternoon, _William Austin_, an Assistant to the Keepers, a Man  reputed to be a very diligent, and faithful Servant, went to _Sheppard_  in the strong Room, call'd the _Castle_, with his Necessaries, as was  his Custom every Day. There went along with him Captain _Geary_, the  Keeper of _New Prison_, Mr. _Gough_, belonging to the _Gate-house_ in  _Westminster_, and two other Gentlemen, who had the Curiosity to see the  Prisoner, _Austin_ very strictly examined his Fetters, and his  Hand-Cuffs, and found them very Safe; he eat his Dinner and talk'd with  his usual Gayety to the Company: They took leave of him and wish'd him a  good Evening. The Court being sitting at the _Old-Bailey_, the Keepers  and most of their Servants were attending there with their Prisoners:  And _Sheppard_ was told that if he wanted any thing more, then was his  Time, because they could not come to him till the next Morning: He  thank'd them for their Kindness, and desir'd them to be as _early as  possible_.    The same Night, soon after 12 of the Clock Mr. _Bird_, who keeps a  Turners-shop adjoyning to _Newgate_, was disturb'd by the Watchman, who  found his Street Door open, and call'd up the Family, and they  concluding the Accident was owing to the Carelessness of some in the  House, shut their Doors, and went to Bed again.    The next Morning _Friday_, at about eight Mr. _Austin_ went up as usual  to wait on _Sheppard_, and having unlock'd and unbolted the double Doors  of the Castle, he beheld almost a Cart-load of Bricks and Rubbish about  the Room, and his Prisoner gone: The Man ready to sink, came trembling  down again, and was scarce able to Acquaint the People in the _Lodge_  with what had happen'd.    The whole Posse of the Prison ran up, and stood like Men depriv'd of  their Senses: Their surprize being over, they were in hopes that he  might not have yet entirely made his Escape, and got their Keys to open  all the strong Rooms adjacent to the _Castle_, in order to Trace him,  when to their farther Amazement, they found the Door ready open'd to  their Hands; and the strong Locks, Screws and Bolts broken in pieces,  and scatter'd about the Jayl. Six great Doors (one whereof having not  been open'd for seven Years past) were forc'd, and it appear'd that he  had Descended from the Leads of _Newgate_ by a Blanket (which he  fasten'd to the Wall by an Iron Spike he had taken from the Hatch of the  _Chapel_) on the House of Mr. _Bird_, and the Door on the Leads having  been left open, it is very reasonable to conclude he past directly to  the Street Door down the Stairs; Mr _Bird_ and his Wife hearing an odd  sort of a Noise on the Stairs as they lay in their Bed, a short time  before the Watchman alarm'd the Family.    Infinite Numbers of Citizens came to _Newgate_ to behold _Sheppard's_  Workmanship, and Mr. _Pitt_ and his Officers very readily Conducted them  up Stairs, that the World might be convinc'd there was not the least  room to suspect, either a Negligence, or Connivance in the Servants.  Every one express'd the greatest Surprize that has been known, and  declar'd themselves satisfy'd with the Measures they had taken for the  Security of their Prisoner.    One of the Sheriffs came in Person, and went up to the _Castle_ to be  satisfy'd of the Situation of the Place, _&c._ Attended by several of  the City Officers.    The Court being sat at the _Sessions-House_, the Keepers were sent for  and Examin'd, and the Magistrates were in great Consternation, that so  horrid a Wretch had escap'd their Justice. It being intended that he  should have been brought down to the Court the last Day of the  _Sessions_, and order'd for Execution in two or three Days after; if it  appear'd that he was the Person Condemn'd for the breaking Mr.  _Kneebone's_ House, and included in the Warrant for Execution, _&c._    Many of the Methods by which this miraculous Escape was effected, remain  as yet a Secret, there are some"]]]
