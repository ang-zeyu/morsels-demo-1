HADDON'S _Magic and Fetishism_ (1906), p. 15.    (3) HENRY CORNELIUS AGRIPPA: _Occult Philosophy_, bk. i. chap. xv.  (WHITEHEAD'S edition, Chicago, 1898, P. 72).      In modern times homoeopathy--according to which a drug is a cure,  if administered in small doses, for that disease whose symptoms it  produces, if given in large doses to a healthy person---seems to bear  some resemblance to these old medical theories concerning the curing of  like by like. That the system of HAHNEMANN (1755--1843), the founder  of homoeopathy, is free from error could be scarcely maintained, but  certain recent discoveries in connection with serum-therapy appear to  indicate that the last word has not yet been said on the subject, and  the formula \"like cures like\" may still have another lease of life to  run.    To return to PARACELSUS, however. It may be thought that his views were  not so great an advance on those of GALEN; but whether or not this be  the case, his union of chemistry and medicine was of immense benefit  to each science, and marked a new era in pharmacy. Even if his theories  were highly fantastic, it was he who freed medicine from the shackles of  traditionalism, and rendered progress in medical science possible.    I must not conclude these brief notes without some reference to the  medical theory of the medicinal efficacy of words. The EBERS papyrus  already mentioned gives various formulas which must be pronounced when  preparing and when administering a drug; and there is a draught used by  the Eastern Jews as a cure for bronchial complaints prepared by writing  certain words on a plate, washing them off with wine, and adding three  grains of a citron which has been used at the Tabernacle festival. But  enough for our present excursion; we must hie us back to the modern  world, with its alkaloids, serums, and anti-toxins--another day we will,  perhaps, wander again down the by-paths of Medicinal Magic.      NOTE ON THE PARACELSIAN DOCTRINE OF THE MICROCOSM      \"Man's nature,\" writes CORNELIUS AGRIPPA, \"_is the most complete Image  of the whole Universe_.\"(1) This theory, especially connected with the  name of PARACELSUS, is worthy of more than passing reference; but as  the consideration of it leads us from medicine to metaphysics, I have  thought it preferable to deal with the subject in a note.      (1) H. C. AGRIPPA: _Occult Philosophy_, bk. i. chap. xxxiii.  (WHITEHEAD'S edition, p. 111).      Man, taught the old mystical philosophers, is threefold in nature,  consisting of spirit, soul, and body. The Paracelsian mercury, sulphur,  and salt were the mineral analogues of these. \"As to the Spirit,\" writes  VALENTINE WEIGEL (1533--1588), a disciple of PARACELSUS, \"we are of God,  move in God, and live in God, and are nourished of God. Hence God is in  us and we are in God; God hath put and placed Himself in us, and we are  put and placed in God. As to the Soul, we are from the Firmament and  Stars, we live and move therein, and are nourished thereof. Hence the  Firmament with its astralic virtues and operations is in us, and we in  it. The Firmament is put and placed in us, and we are put and placed in  the Firmament. As to the Body, we are of the elements, we move and live  therein, and are nourished of them:--hence the elements are in us, and  we in them. The elements, by the slime, are put and placed in us, and we  are put and placed in them.\"(1) Or, to quote from PARACELSUS himself, in  his _Hermetic Astronomy_ he writes: \"God took the body out of which He  built up man from those things which He created from nothingness into  something... Hence man is now a microcosm, or a little world, because  he is an extract from all the stars and planets of the whole firmament,  from the earth and the elements, and so he is their quintessence.... But  between the macrocosm and the microcosm this difference occurs, that the  form, image, species, and substance of man are diverse therefrom. In man  the earth is flesh, the water is blood, fire is the heat thereof, and  air is the balsam. These properties have not been changed but only the  substance of the body. So man is man, not a world, yet made from the  world, made in the likeness, not of the world, but of God. Yet man  comprises in himself all the qualities of the world.... His body is from  the world, and therefore must be fed and nourished by that world from  which he has sprung.... He has been taken from the earth and from the  elements, and therefore, must be nourished by these.... Now, man is not  only flesh and blood, but there is within the intellect which does not,  like the complexion, come from the elements, but from the stars. And  the condition of the stars is this, that all the wisdom, intelligence,  industry of the animal, and all the arts peculiar to man are contained  in them. From the stars man has these same things, and that is called  the light of Nature; in fact, it is whatever man has found by the light  of Nature.... Such, then, is the condition of man, that, out of the  great universe he needs both elements and stars, seeing that he himself  is constituted in that way.\"(1b)      (1) VALENTINE WEIGEL: \"_Astrology Theologised\": The Spiritual  Hermeneutics of Astrology and Holy Writ_, ed. by ANNA BONUS KINGSFORD  (1886), p. 59.    (1b) _The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of_ PARACELSUS, ed. by A. E.  WAITE (1894), vol. ii. pp. 289-291.        It is not difficult to discern a certain truth in all this, making  allowances for modes of thought which are not those of the present day.  The Swedish philosopher SWEDENBORG (1688-1772) reaffirmed the theory  in later years; but, as he points out,(2) the reason that man is a  microcosm lies deeper than in the facts that his body is of the elements  of this earth and is nourished thereby. According to this profound  thinker, FORM, spiritually understood, is the expression of USE, the  uses of things being indicated by their forms. Now, the human form is  the highest of all forms, because it subserves the highest of all uses.  Hence, both the world of matter and the world of spirit are in the  human form, because there is a correspondence in use between man and  the Cosmos. We may, therefore, call man as to his body a microcosm, or  little world; as to his soul a micro-uranos, or little heaven. Or we may  speak of the macrocosm, or great world, as the Grand Man, and we may  say that the Soul of this Grand Man, the self-existent, substantial, and  efficient cause of all things, at once immanent within yet transcending  all things, is God.

SUPERSTITIONS CONCERNING BIRDS    AMONGST the most remarkable of natural occurrences must be included  many of the phenomena connected with the behaviour of birds. Undoubtedly  numerous species of birds are susceptible to atmospheric changes (of  an electrical and barometric nature) too slight to be observed by man's  unaided senses; thus only is to be explained the phenomenon of migration  and also the many other peculiarities in the behaviour of birds whereby  approaching changes in the weather may be foretold. Probably, also, this  fact has much to do with the extraordinary homing instinct of pigeons.  But, of course, in the days when meteorological science had yet to be  born, no such explanation as this could be known. The ancients observed  that birds by their migrations or by other peculiarities in their  behaviour prognosticated coming changes in the seasons of the year and  other changes connected with the weather (such as storms, _etc_.); they  saw, too, in the homing instincts of pigeons an apparent exhibition of  intelligence exceeding that of man. What more natural, then, for them  to attribute foresight to birds, and to suppose that all sorts of coming  events (other than those of an atmospheric nature) might be foretold by  careful observation of their flight and song?    Augury--that is, the art of divination by observing the behaviour of  birds--was extensively cultivated by the Etrurians and Romans.(1) It  is still used, I believe, by the natives of Samoa. The Romans had an  official college of augurs, the members of which were originally three  patricians. About 300 B.C. the number of patrician augurs was increased  by one, and five plebeian augurs were added. Later the number was again  increased to fifteen. The object of augury was not so much to foretell  the future as to indicate what line of action should be followed, in  any given circumstances, by the nation. The augurs were consulted on all  matters of importance, and the position of augur was thus one of great  consequence. In what appears to be the oldest method, the augur, arrayed  in a special costume, and carrying a staff with which to mark out the  visible heavens into houses, proceeded to an elevated piece of ground,  where a sacrifice was made and a prayer repeated. Then, gazing towards  the sky, he waited until a bird appeared. The point in the heavens where  it first made its appearance was carefully noted, also the manner and  direction of its flight, and the point where it was lost sight of. From  these particulars an augury was derived, but, in order to be of effect,  it had to be confirmed by a further one.      (1) This is not quite an accurate definition, as \"auguries\" were  also obtained from other animals and from celestial phenomena (_e.g_.  lightning), _etc_.    Auguries were also drawn from the notes of birds, birds being divided by  the augurs into two classes: (i) _oscines_, \"those which give omens by  their note,\" and (ii) _alites_, \"those which afford presages by their  flight.\"(1) Another method of augury was performed by the feeding of  chickens specially kept for this purpose. This was done just before  sunrise by the _pullarius_ or feeder, strict silence being observed.

They therefore setting fiercely on  the enemy slew them on the right hand and the left till it was wonderful  to see their slaughter.    When the eleven kings beheld so small a band doing such mighty deeds of  arms they were ashamed, and charged them fiercely in return. Then was Sir  Ulfius' horse slain under him; but he fought well and marvellously on foot  against Duke Eustace and King Clarience, who set upon him grievously, till  Sir Brastias, seeing his great peril, pricked towards them swiftly, and so  smote the duke through with his spear that horse and man fell down and  rolled over. Whereat King Clarience turned upon Sir Brastias, and rushing  furiously together they each unhorsed the other and fell both to the  ground, and there lay a long time stunned, their horses' knees being cut  to the bone. Then came Sir Key the seneschal with six companions, and did  wondrous well, till the eleven kings went out against them and overthrew  Sir Griflet and Sir Lucas the butler. And when Sir Key saw Sir Griflet  unhorsed and on foot, he rode against King Nanters hotly and smote him  down, and led his horse to Griflet and horsed him again; with the same  spear did Sir Key smite down King Lot and wounded him full sore.    But seeing that, the King of the Hundred Knights rushed at Sir Key and  overthrew him in return, and took his horse and gave it to King Lot. And  when Sir Griflet saw Sir Key's mischance, he set his spear in rest, and  riding at a mighty man-at-arms, he cast him down headlong and caught his  horse and led it straightway to Sir Key.    By now the battle was growing perilous and hard, and both sides fought  with rage and fury. And Sir Ulfius and Sir Brastias were both afoot and  in great danger of their death, and foully stained and trampled under  horses' feet. Then King Arthur, putting spurs to his horse, rushed forward  like a lion into the midst of all the _melee_, and singling out King  Cradlemont of North Wales, smote him through the left side and overthrew  him, and taking his horse by the rein he brought it to Sir Ulfius in haste  and said, \"Take this horse, mine old friend, for thou hast great need of  one, and charge by side of me.\" And even as he spoke he saw Sir Ector, Sir  Key's father, smitten to the earth by the King of the Hundred Knights, and  his horse taken to King Cradlemont.    But when King Arthur saw him ride upon Sir Ector's horse his wrath was  very great, and with his sword he smote King Cradlemont upon the helm, and  shore off the fourth part thereof and of the shield, and drave the sword  onward to the horse's neck and slew the horse, and hurled the king upon  the ground.    And now the battle waxed so great and furious that all the noise and sound  thereof rang out by water and by wood, so that Kings Ban and Bors, with  all their knights and men-at-arms in ambush, hearing the tumult and the  cries, trembled and shook for eagerness, and scarce could stay in secret,  but made them ready for the fray and dressed their shields and harness.    But when King Arthur saw the fury of the enemy, he raged like a mad lion,  and stirred and drove his horse now here, now there, to the right hand and  to the left, and stayed not in his wrath till he had slain full twenty  knights. He wounded also King Lot so sorely in the shoulder that he left  the field, and in great pain and dolour cried out to the other kings, \"Do  ye as I devise, or we shall be destroyed. I, with the King of the Hundred  Knights, King Anguisant, King Yder, and the Duke of Cambinet, will take  fifteen thousand men and make a circuit, meanwhile that ye do hold the  battle with twelve thousand. Then coming suddenly we will fall fiercely on  them from behind and put them to the rout, but else shall we never stand  against them.\"    So Lot and four kings departed with their party to one side, and the six  other kings dressed their ranks against King Arthur and fought long and  stoutly.    But now Kings Ban and Bors, with all their army fresh and eager, broke  from their ambush and met face to face the five kings and their host as  they came round behind, and then began a frantic struggle with breaking of  spears and clashing of swords and slaying of men and horses. Anon King  Lot, espying in the midst King Bors, cried out in great dismay, \"Our Lady  now defend us from our death and fearful wounds; our peril groweth great,  for yonder cometh one of the worshipfullest kings and best knights in all  the world.\"    \"Who is he?\" said the King of the Hundred Knights.    \"It is King Bors of Gaul,\" replied King Lot, \"and much I marvel how he may  have come with all his host into this land without our knowledge.\"    \"Aha!\" cried King Carados, \"I will encounter with this king if ye will  rescue me when there is need.\"    \"Ride on,\" said they.    So King Carados and all his host rode softly till they came within a  bow-shot of King Bors, and then both hosts, spurring their horses to their  greatest swiftness, rushed at each other. And King Bors encountered in  the onset with a knight, and struck him through with a spear, so that he  fell dead upon the earth; then drawing his sword, he did such mighty feats  of arms that all who saw him gazed with wonder. Anon King Ban came also  forth upon the field with all his knights, and added yet more fury, sound,  and slaughter, till at length both hosts of the eleven kings began to  quake, and drawing all together into one body, they prepared to meet the  worst, while a great multitude already fled.    Then said King Lot, \"Lords, we must take yet other means, or worse loss  still awaits us. See ye not what people we have lost in waiting on the  footmen, and that it costs ten horsemen to save one of them? Therefore it  is my counsel to put away our footmen from us, for it is almost night, and  King Arthur will not stay to slaughter them. So they can save their lives  in this great wood hard by. Then let us gather into one band all the  horsemen that remain, and whoso breaketh rank or leaveth us, let him be  straightway slain by him that seeth him, for it is better that we slay a  coward than through a coward be all slain. How say ye?\" said King Lot;  \"answer me, all ye kings.\"    \"It is well said,\" replied they all.    And swearing they would never fail each other, they mended and set right  their armour and their shields, and took new spears and set them  steadfastly against their thighs, waiting, and so stood still as a clump  of trees stands on the plain; and no assaults could shake them, they held  so hard together; which when King Arthur saw he marvelled greatly, and was  very wroth. \"Yet,\" cried he, \"I may not blame them, by my faith, for they  do as brave men ought to do, and are the best fighting men and knights of  most prowess that I ever saw or heard tell of.\" And so said also Kings Ban  and Bors, and praised them greatly for their noble chivalry.    But now came forty noble knights out of King Arthur's host, and prayed  that he would suffer them to break the enemy. And when they were allowed,  they rode forth with their spears upon their thighs, and spurred their  horses to their hottest. Then the eleven kings, with a party of their  knights, rushed with set spears as fast and mightily to meet them; and  when they were encountered, all the crash and splinter of their spears and  armour rang with a mighty din, and so fierce and bloody was their onset  that in all that day there had been no such cruel press, and rage, and  smiting. At that same moment rode fiercely into the thickest of the  struggle King Arthur and Kings Ban and Bors, and slew downright on both  hands right and left, until their horses went in blood up to the fetlocks.    And while the slaughter and the noise and shouting were at their greatest,  suddenly there came down through the battle Merlin the Wizard, upon a  great black horse, and riding to King Arthur, he cried out, \"Alas, my  Lord! will ye have never done? Of sixty thousand have ye left but fifteen  thousand men alive. Is it not time to stay this slaying? for God is ill  pleased with ye that ye have never ended, and yonder kings shall not be  altogether overthrown this time. But if ye fall upon them any more, the  fortune of this day will turn, and go to them. Withdraw, Lord, therefore,  to thy lodging, and there now take thy rest, for to-day thou hast won a  great victory, and overcome the noblest chivalry of all the world. And now  for many years those kings shall not disturb thee. Therefore, I tell  thee, fear them no more, for now they are sore beaten, and have nothing  left them but their honour; and why shouldest thou slay them to take  that?\"    Then said King Arthur, \"Thou sayest well, and I will take thy counsel.\"  With that he cried out, \"Ho!\" for the battle to cease, and sent forth  heralds through the field to stay more fighting. And gathering all the  spoil, he gave it not amongst his own host, but to Kings Ban and Bors and  all their knights and men-at-arms, that he might treat them with the  greater courtesy as strangers.    Then Merlin took his leave of Arthur and the two other kings, and went to  see his master, Blaise, a holy hermit, dwelling in Northumberland, who had  nourished him through all his youth. And Blaise was passing glad to see  him, for there was a great love ever between them; and Merlin told him how  King Arthur had sped in the battle, and how it had ended; and told him the  names of every king and knight of worship who was there. So Blaise wrote  down the battle, word for word, as Merlin told him; and in the same way  ever after, all the battles of King Arthur's days Merlin caused Blaise,  his master, to record.
