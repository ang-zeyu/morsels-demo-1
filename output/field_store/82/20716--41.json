But in the first days let us learn that this is not  possible.          CHAPTER VIII.    THE CLASSICS.[26]        \"Genuine work done faithfully, that is eternal.\"--_Thomas Carlyle._    The older we grow and the more we study, the more we shall hear about  the classics, about classic music, and classic art, and classic books.  From the beginning let us keep it in our minds that one of our duties  is to find out the difference between what is classic and what is not.  Then we shall have a proper understanding. An English writer on art  says: \"The writers and painters of the classic school set down nothing  but what is known to be true, and set it down in the perfectest manner  possible in their way.\"[27]    And we have already learned that thought from the heart, expressed in  tones, is good music. On the other hand, a thought with the heart not  in it, expressed in tone, makes poor or common music. Mendelssohn  wrote in one of his letters: \"When I have composed a piece just as it  springs from my heart, then I have done my duty toward it.\"[28] But in  writing thoughts, whether in words or in tones, there is a very  important thing to add to the bidding of the heart. It is the training  of the mind. With both of these one works and judges wisely.    With thought and intention ever so pure, but with no education, one  would not be able to write for others, and with a little education one  would be able to write only in a partially correct way. This brings us  to one of the most interesting Talks we shall have. Let us try to make  it clear and simple.    We can easily imagine a man both true and good who can neither write  nor spell. Happily, in these days, nearly all people who are old  enough know how to do both. We can understand that this man may have  beautiful thoughts--the thoughts of a true poet or of a true  artist--but being unable to write or to spell he could not put his  thoughts on paper for others to read and to study. This is the way  thoughts are preserved and made into books so that people may benefit  by them.    It would, therefore, be necessary for this man, about whom we speak,  to get the assistance of some one who knew how to write thoughts and  to spell their words. Then, together, they would have to talk about  the thoughts, choose proper words, form the sentences, and make all  fit rightly together as a writer must who desires to be clear. But it  is more than likely that the one who writes would not do all these  things to the satisfaction of the other. Of this there could be but  one result. The person who had the beautiful thoughts would be forever  wishing that he had learned in the first days to write and to spell.  Then he could do all these things for himself and show his thoughts to  others exactly as he wished them to appear.    Now it is clear that some may have beautiful and valuable thoughts and  not know how to write them, while others may have the ability to write  without having thoughts worth preserving. Evidently what one must have  are both beautiful thoughts and ability to write them.    Did you think when I read you that bit from the letter of Mendelssohn  that all a composer has to do is to find in his heart just what he  wants to say? As we have already discovered, that is not enough. To  show you that Mendelssohn was not afraid of hard work let us read a  little from another of his letters.[29] Mendelssohn had resolved to  work in Germany and maintain himself. \"If I find that I cannot do  this, then I must leave it for London or Paris, where it is easier to  get on. I see indeed where I should be more honored, and live more  gaily and more at my ease than in Germany, where a man must press  forward, and toil, and take no rest,--still, if I can succeed there,  _I prefer_ the latter.\"[30]    We can now understand that it is quite the same with word-thinkers and  with tone-thinkers. Good thoughts and the proper writing of them make  the classics.    Out of this thought there comes another. It is this: Great thoughts,  expressed well, out of a great heart, make the works which last the  longest; and still further, for one truth leads out of another. Only  they can appreciate the classics who have something that is classic  within them. They must have the heart true in its feeling, tender in  its sentiments. Even a child can have that. They must have the mind  trained in the truest and best way of expressing thought. And a child  may begin to learn that. Hence we see that a child may be classic  worthy. Only we must never, _never_, no matter what is our ability,  think we are better or above others. The more talents one has the more  one is expected to do and the greater duty it is.[31]    Thus far we have three truths; now here is a fourth: Some love the  classics sooner and better than others because they have more power.  And how do they get it? They think more (thought-making); they feel  more (heart-learning); and they see more (truth-seeking).    Let us at once go back and gather together these four truths. They are  important. Perhaps some of us who are willing to spend the time will  learn them from memory.    And to repay us for the trouble of doing it we shall have greater and  greater understanding of many things. Here they are:        I. Good thoughts and the proper writing of them make the classics.       II. Great thoughts, expressed well, out of a great heart, make the         works which last the longest.      III. Only they can appreciate the classics who have something that         is classic within them.       IV. Some love the classics sooner and better than others because         they have more power.    What shall these truths teach us? That true music cannot be learned  rapidly; that the way of Art is long and difficult. But if the way is  long, it is yet beautiful in every turn; if it is difficult, it is yet  worth a struggle for what comes. As you read the lives of the great  composers you will learn that they went willingly about their tasks,  doing each one well. This is done by all great men. _Great men take  short steps carefully_, no matter how rapidly they can go.    One of them [32] wrote: \"Success comes with tiny steps.\" And it comes  entirely unsought. Besides all this we are to remember that the power  for these things comes from        I. Thought-making;       II. Heart-learning;      III. Truth-seeking.    Now, just to end with let us read a few words from a book I trust we  all may read some day: [33] \"Great art is the expression of the mind  of a great man, and mean art of a weak man.\" Let us remember that in  choosing things to play.    Further on Ruskin says: \"If stone work is _well_ put together, it  means that a thoughtful man planned it, and a careful man cut it, and  an honest man cemented it.\" [34]    Likewise in these things one can see what is classic--work out of the  heart and well done, and that comes from a thoughtful, careful, honest  person.          CHAPTER IX.    WHAT WE SHOULD PLAY.        \"But blessings do not fall in listless hands.\"_--Bayard Taylor._    We already begin to understand what the classics are. Year by year as  our interest in the beautiful increases, we shall gain more definite  knowledge about classic art. That which is classic will begin to  announce itself in us. Our own choice indicates our taste but does not  always indicate what is best for us. And one of the purposes of art is  to improve the taste by setting before us the finest works; in these,  by study, we find beauty with which we are unacquainted. Thus we  enlarge our capacity for it.    Because we are born with taste unformed and untrained you can at once  see the reason for gradually increasing the tasks. They are always a  little more difficult--like going up a mountain--but they give a finer  and finer view. The outlook from the mountain-top cannot be had all at  once. We must work our way upward for it. Hence you will observe in  your lessons that what was once a fitting task is no longer of quite  the same value because of your increased power. But about this  especially we shall have a Talk later on.    When one has heard much music of all kinds, one soon begins to  understand that there are two kinds commonly chosen. Some players  choose true music with pure thought in it, and do their best to play  it well after the manner called for by the composer. Their aim is to  give truthful expression to the music of a good writer. Other players  seem to work from a motive entirely different. They select music which  is of a showy character, with much brilliancy and little thought in  it. Their aim is not to show what good music is, but to show  themselves. The desire of the first is truth, of the second is vanity.    Now, as we examine into this, and into both kinds of music, we  discover much. It proves that we must work for the best; for the  truthful music, not for the vain music. As we get better acquainted  with true music we find it more and more interesting--it keeps saying  new things to us. We go to it again and again, getting new meanings.  But the showy music soon yields all it has; we find little or nothing  more in it than at first. As it was made not from good thought but for  display, we cannot find newer and more beautiful thought in it, and  the display soon grows tiresome. True music is like the light in a  beautifully-cut gem, it seems that we never see all it is--it is never  twice the same; always a new radiance comes from it because it is a  true gem through and through. It is full of true light, and true light  is always opposed to darkness; and darkness is the source of  ignorance.    From all this you can now understand the quaintly-expressed opinion of  a very wise man, who said: \"In discharge of thy place, set before thee  the best example.\"[35] That means whatever we strive to learn should  be learned from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14360"],[0,"The Dawn and the Day (#6)"],[1,"improbability, but because the great Asvaghosha, who wrote about the  beginning of our era, knew nothing of them.    [14]To suppose that the Aryan races when they emigrated to India or  Europe left behind them their most valuable possession, the Nisaean  horse, is to suppose them lacking in the qualities of thrift and  shrewdness which have distinguished their descendants.  That the  Nisaean horse of the table-lands of Asia was the horse of the armored  knights of the middle ages and substantially the Percheron horse of  France, I had a curious proof: In Layard's Nineveh is a picture of a  Nisaean horse found among the ruins, which would have been taken as a  good picture Of a Percheron stallion I once owned, who stood for the  picture here drawn of what I regard as his undoubted ancestor.    [15]Marco Polo speaks of the breed of horses here attempted to be  described as \"excellent, large, strong and swift, said to be of the  race of Alexander's Bucephalus.\"    [16]It is said that the Mongolians in their career of conquest could  move an army of 500,000 fifty miles a day, a speed out of the question  with all the facilities of modern warfare.    [17]See Bret Harte's beautiful poem, \"Sell Patchin,\" and also an  article on the \"Horses of the Plains,\" in _The Century_, January, 1889.            BOOK II.      She passed along, and then the king and prince    With their attendants wheeled in line and moved    Down to the royal stand, each to his place.      The trumpets sound, and now the games begin.      But see the scornful curl of Culture's lip    At such low sports!  Dyspeptic preachers hear    Harangue the sleepers on their sinfulness!    Hear grave philosophers, so limp and frail    They scarce can walk God's earth to breathe his air,    Talk of the waste of time!  Short-sighted men!    God made the body just to fit the mind,    Each part exact, no scrimping and no waste--    Neglect the body and you cramp the soul.      First brawny wrestlers, shining from the bath,    Wary and watchful, quick with arm and eye,    After long play clinch close, arms twined, knees locked,    Each nerve and muscle strained, and stand as still    As if a bronze from Vulcan's fabled shop,    Or else by power of magic changed to stone    In that supremest moment, when a breath    Or feather's weight would tip the balanced scale;    And when they fall the shouts from hill to hill    Sound like the voices of the mighty deep,    As wave on wave breaks on the rock-bound shore.      Then boxers, eye to eye and foot to foot,    One arm at guard, the other raised to strike.      The hurlers of the quoit next stand in line,    Measure the distance with experienced eye,    Adjust the rings, swing them with growing speed,    Until at length on very tiptoe poised,    Like Mercury just lighted on the earth,    With mighty force they whirl them through the air.      And then the spearmen, having for a mark    A lion rampant, standing as in life,    So distant that it seemed but half life-size,    Each vital part marked with a little ring.    And when the spears were hurled, six trembling stood    Fixed in the beast, piercing each vital part,    Leaving the victory in even scale.    For these was set far off a lesser mark,    Until at length by chance, not lack of skill,    The victory so long in doubt was won.    And then again the people wildly shout,    The prince victor and nobly vanquished praised.      Next runners, lithe and light, glide round the plain,    Whose flying feet like Mercury's seemed winged,    Their chests expanded, and their swinging arms    Like oars to guide and speed their rapid course;    And as they passed along the people cheered    Each well-known master of the manly art.      Then archers, with broad chests and brawny arms    Such as the blacksmith's heavy hammer wields    With quick, hard blows that make the anvil ring    And myriad sparks from the hot iron fly;    A golden eagle on a screen their mark,    So distant that it seemed a sparrow's size--    \"For,\" said the prince, \"let not this joyful day    Give anguish to the smallest living thing.\"    They strain their bows until their muscles seem    Like knotted cords, the twelve strings twang at once,    And the ground trembles as at the swelling tones    Of mighty organs or the thunder's roll.    Two arrows pierce the eagle, while the rest    All pierce the screen.  A second mark was set,    When lo! high up in air two lines of swans,    Having one leader, seek their northern nests,    Their white plumes shining in the noonday sun,    Calling each other in soft mellow notes.    Instant one of the people cries \"A mark!\"    Whereat the thousands shout \"A mark! a mark!\"    One of the archers chose the leader, one the last.    Their arrows fly.  The last swan left its mates    As if sore wounded, while the first came down    Like a great eagle swooping for its prey,    And fell before the prince, its strong wing pierced,    Its bright plumes darkened by its crimson blood.    Whereat the people shout, and shout again,    Until the hills repeat the mighty sound.    The prince gently but sadly raised the bird,    Stroked tenderly its plumes, calmed its wild fear,    And gave to one to care for and to cure.      And now the people for the chariot-race    Grow eager, while beneath the royal stand,    By folding doors hid from the public view,    The steeds, harnessed and ready, champ their bits    And paw the ground, impatient for the start.    The charioteers alert, with one strong hand    Hold high the reins, the other holds the lash.    Timour--a name that since has filled the world,    A Tartar chief, whose sons long after swept    As with destruction's broom fair India's plains--    With northern jargon calmed his eager steeds;    Azim, from Cashmere's rugged lovely vale,    His prancing Babylonians firmly held;    Channa, from Ganges' broad and sacred stream,    With bit and word checked his Nisaean three;    While Devadatta, cousin to the prince,    Soothed his impatient Arabs with such terms    As fondest mothers to their children use;    \"Atair, my pet!  Mira, my baby, hush!    Regil, my darling child, be still! be still!\"    With necks high arched, nostrils distended wide,    And eager gaze, they stood as those that saw    Some distant object in their desert home.      At length the gates open as of themselves,    When at the trumpet's sound the steeds dash forth    As by one spirit moved, under tight rein,    And neck and neck they thunder down the plain,    While rising dust-clouds chase the flying wheels.    But weight, not lack of nerve or spirit, tells;    Azim and Channa urge their steeds in vain,    By Tartar and light Arab left behind    As the light galley leaves the man-of-war;    They sweat and labor ere a mile is gained,    While their light rivals pass the royal stand    Fresh as at first, just warming to the race.      And now the real race at length begins,    A double race, such as the Romans loved.    Horses so matched in weight and strength and speed,    Drivers so matched in skill that as they pass    Azim and Channa seemed a single man.    Timour and Devadatta, side by side,    Wheel almost touching wheel, dash far ahead.      Azim and Channa, left so far behind,    No longer urge a race already lost.    The Babylonian and Nisaean steeds,    No longer pressed so far beyond their power,    With long and even strides sweep smoothly on,    Striking the earth as with a single blow,    Their hot breath rising in a single cloud.    Arab and Tartar with a longer stride    And lighter stroke skim lightly o'er the ground.    Watching the horses with a master's eye,    As Devadatta and Timour four times,    Azim and Channa thrice, swept by the stand,    The prince saw that another round would test,    Not overtax, their powers, and gave the sign,    When three loud trumpet-blasts to all proclaimed    That running one more round would end the race.    These ringing trumpet-calls that brought defeat    Or victory so near, startle and rouse.    The charioteers more ardent urge their steeds;    The steeds are with hot emulation fired;    The social multitude now cease to talk--    Even age stops short in stories often told;    Boys, downy-chinned, in rough-and-tumble sports    Like half-grown bears engaged, turn quick and look;    And blooming girls, with merry ringing laugh,    Romping in gentler games, watching meanwhile    With sly and sidelong look the rougher sports,    Turn eagerly to see the scene below;    While mothers for the time forget their babes,    And lovers who had sought out quiet nooks    To tell the tale that all the past has told    And coming times will tell, stand mute and gaze.    The home-stretch soon is reached, and Channa's three    By word and lash urged to their topmost speed,    The foaming Babylonians left behind,    While Devadatta and Timour draw near,    A whole round gained, Timour a length ahead.    But Devadatta loosens now his reins,    Chides his fleet pets, with lash swung high in air    Wounds their proud spirits, not their tender flesh.    With lion-bounds they pass the Tartar steeds,    That with hot rival rage and open mouths,    And flaming eyes, and fierce and angry cries,    Dash full at Regil's side, but dash in vain.    Fear adding speed, the Arabs sweep ahead.    Meanwhile the prince springs forward from his seat,    And all on tiptoe still and eager stand,    So that the rumbling of the chariot-wheels,    The tramp of flying feet and drivers' cries,    Alone the universal stillness break--    As when before the bursting of some fearful storm,    Birds, beasts and men stand mute with trembling awe,    While heaven's artillery and roaring winds    Are in the awful silence only heard.    But when the double victory is gained,    Drums, shells and trumpets mingle with the shouts    From hill to hill re-echoed and renewed--    As when, after the morning's threatening bow,    Dark, lurid, whirling"]]]
