It will be proper to say something here concerning the situation of the  unfortunate men, who were thus doomed to a life of servitude. To  enumerate their various employments, and to describe the miseries which  they endured in consequence, either from the severity, or the long and  constant application of their labour, would exceed the bounds we have  proposed to the present work. We shall confine ourselves to their  _personal treatment_, as depending on the power of their masters, and  the protection of the law. Their treatment, if considered in this light,  will equally excite our pity and abhorrence. They were beaten, starved,  tortured, murdered at discretion: they were dead in a civil sense; they  had neither name nor tribe; were incapable of a judicial process; were  in short without appeal. Poor unfortunate men! to be deprived of all  possible protection! to suffer the bitterest of injuries without the  possibility of redress! to be condemned unheard! to be murdered with  impunity! to be considered as dead in that state, the very members of  which they were supporting by their labours!    Yet such was their general situation: there were two places however,  where their condition, if considered in this point of view, was more  tolerable. The AEgyptian slave, though perhaps of all others the greatest  drudge, yet if he had time to reach the temple[016] of Hercules, found a  certain retreat from the persecution of his master; and he received  additional comfort from the reflection, that his life, whether he could  reach it or not, could not be taken with impunity. Wise and salutary  law![017] how often must it have curbed the insolence of power, and  stopped those passions in their progress, which had otherwise been  destructive to the slave!    But though the persons of slaves were thus greatly secured in AEgypt, yet  there was no place so favourable to them as Athens. They were allowed a  greater liberty of speech;[018] they had their convivial meetings, their  amours, their hours of relaxation, pleasantry, and mirth; they were  treated, in short, with so much humanity in general, as to occasion that  observation of Demosthenes, in his second Philippick, \"that the  condition of a slave, at Athens, was preferable to that of a free  citizen, in many other countries.\" But if any exception happened (which  was sometimes the case) from the general treatment described; if  persecution took the place of lenity, and made the fangs of servitude  more pointed than before,[019] they had then their temple, like the  AEgyptian, for refuge; where the legislature was so attentive, as to  examine their complaints, and to order them, if they were founded in  justice, to be sold to another master. Nor was this all: they had a  privilege infinitely greater than the whole of these. They were allowed  an opportunity of working for themselves, and if their diligence had  procured them a sum equivalent with their ransom, they could  immediately, on paying it down,[020] demand their freedom for ever. This  law was, of all others, the most important; as the prospect of liberty,  which it afforded, must have been a continual source of the most  pleasing reflections, and have greatly sweetened the draught, even of  the most bitter slavery.    Thus then, to the eternal honour of AEgypt and Athens, they were the only  places that we can find, where slaves were considered with any humanity  at all. The rest of the world seemed to vie with each other, in the  debasement and oppression of these unfortunate people. They used them  with as much severity as they chose; they measured their treatment only  by their own passion and caprice; and, by leaving them on every  occasion, without the possibility of an appeal, they rendered their  situation the most melancholy and intolerable, that can possibly be  conceived.             *        *        *        *        *      FOOTNOTES      [Footnote 016: Herodotus.

As we have mentioned the barbarous and inhuman treatment that generally  fell to the lot of slaves, it may not be amiss to inquire into the  various circumstances by which it was produced.    The first circumstance, from whence it originated, was the  _commerce_: for if men could be considered as _possessions_;  if, like _cattle_, they could be _bought_ and _sold_, it  will not be difficult to suppose, that they could be held in the same  consideration, or treated in the same manner. The commerce therefore,  which was begun in the primitive ages of the world, by classing them  with the brutal species, and by habituating the mind to consider the  terms of _brute_ and _slave_ as _synonimous_, soon caused  them to be viewed in a low and despicable light, and as greatly  inferiour to the human species. Hence proceeded that treatment, which  might not unreasonably be supposed to arise from so low an estimation.  They were tamed, like beasts, by the stings of hunger and the lash, and  their education was directed to the same end, to make them commodious  instruments of labour for their possessors.    This _treatment_, which thus proceeded in the ages of barbarism,  from the low estimation, in which slaves were unfortunately held from  the circumstances of the commerce, did not fail of producing, in the  same instant, its _own_ effect. It depressed their minds; it numbed  their faculties; and, by preventing those sparks of genius from blazing  forth, which had otherwise been conspicuous; it gave them the appearance  of being endued with inferiour capacities than the rest of mankind. This  effect of the _treatment_ had made so considerable a progress, as  to have been a matter of observation in the days of Homer.      For half _his_ senses Jove conveys away,  _Whom_ once he dooms to see the _servile_ day.[021]      Thus then did the _commerce_, by classing them originally with  _brutes_, and the consequent _treatment_, by cramping their  _abilities_, and hindering them from becoming _conspicuous_,  give to these unfortunate people, at a very early period, the most  unfavourable _appearance_. The rising generations, who received  both the commerce and treatment from their ancestors, and who had always  been accustomed to behold their _effects_, did not consider these  _effects_ as _incidental_: they judged only from what they  saw; they believed the _appearances_ to be _real_; and hence  arose the combined principle, that slaves were an _inferiour_ order  of men, and perfectly void of _understanding_. Upon this  _principle_ it was, that the former treatment began to be fully  confirmed and established; and as this _principle_ was handed down  and disseminated, so it became, in succeeding ages, an _excuse_ for  any severity, that despotism might suggest.    We may observe here, that as all nations had this excuse in common, as  arising from the _circumstances_ above-mentioned, so the Greeks  first, and the Romans afterwards, had an _additional excuse_, as  arising from their own _vanity_.    The former having conquered Troy, and having united themselves under one  common name and interest, began, from that period, to distinguish the  rest of the world by the title of _barbarians_; inferring by such  an appellation, \"that they were men who were only noble in their own  country; that they had no right, from their _nature_, to authority  or command; that, on the contrary, so low were their capacities, they  were _destined_ by nature _to obey_, and to live in a state of  perpetual drudgery and subjugation.\"[022] Conformable with this opinion  was the treatment, which was accordingly prescribed to a  _barbarian_. The philosopher Aristotle himself, in the advice which  he gave to his pupil Alexander, before he went upon his Asiatick  expedition, intreated him to \"use the Greeks, as it became a  _general_, but the _barbarians_, as it became a _master_;  consider, says he, the former as _friends_ and _domesticks_;  but the latter, as _brutes_ and _plants_;\"[023] inferring that  the Greeks, from the superiority of their capacities, had a  _natural_ right to dominion, and that the rest of the world, from  the inferiority of their own, were to be considered and treated as the  _irrational_ part of the creation.    Now, if we consider that this was the treatment, which they judged to be  absolutely proper for people of this description, and that their slaves  were uniformly those, whom they termed _barbarians_; being  generally such, as were either kidnapped from _Barbary_, or  purchased from the _barbarian_ conquerors in their wars with one  another; we"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10633"],[0,"The History of the Rise, Progress and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the (#6)"],[1,"Government, if their guilty  reluctance shall continue, or it will take that guilt upon itself[A].    [Footnote A: It is truly gratifying to state, that the late Secretary  for the Colonies, Lord Glenelg, has, since this was written, given the  most satisfactory assurances of orders having been sent over for  immediate emancipation, in case the former instructions to the Governor  of Mauritius should have failed, to make the Colonists themselves adopt  the measure. Lord Glenelg's conduct on this occasion is most creditable  to him.]    The latest act of Thomas Clarkson's life has been one which, or rather  the occasion for which, it is truly painful to contemplate; but this too  must be recorded, or the present historical sketch would be incomplete.  He whose days had all been spent in acts of kindness and of justice to  others, was at last forced to exert his powers, supposed, by some, and  erroneously supposed, to be enfeebled by age, in obtaining redress for  his own wrongs. He whose thoughts had all been devoted to the service of  his fellow-creatures, was now obliged to think of himself. A life spent  in works of genuine philanthropy, alike standing aloof from party, and  retiring with genuine humility from the public gaze, might have well  hoped to escape that detraction, which is the lot of those who assume  the leading stations among their contemporaries, and mingle in the  contentious scenes of worldly affairs. Or, at least, it might have been  expected that his traducers would only be found among the oppressors of  the New World, or the slave-traders of the Old. This felicity has not  been his lot; and the evening of his days has been overcast by an  assault upon his character, proceeding from the quarter of all others  the most unexpected and the most strange.    The sons of his old and dear friend William Wilberforce,--whose  incomparable merits he had ever been the first to acknowledge, whom he  loved as a brother, and revered as the great leader of the cause to  which his whole life had been devoted,--in publishing a Life of their  illustrious parent, thought fit to charge Thomas Clarkson with having  suppressed his services while he exaggerated his own; and not content  with bringing a charge utterly groundless, (as it was instantly proved,)  they deemed it worthy of their subject and of their name, to drag forth  into the light of day a private correspondence of a delicate nature,  with the purpose of proving that their father and others had assisted  him with money, and that he had been pressing in his demands of a  subscription. Two extracts of Letters of his were printed by these  reverend gentlemen, upon which a statement was afterwards grounded in  the _Edinburgh Review_ of their book, that the subscription was raised  to remunerate him for his services in the Abolition. They further  asserted, that their father was in the field before him, and that it was  under their father's direction that he, and the Abolition Committee of  1786, acted. In the whole history of controversy, we venture to affirm,  there never was an instance of so triumphant a refutation as that by  which these slanderous aspersions were instantly refuted, and their  authors and their accomplices reduced to a silence as prudent as  discreditable.    The venerable philanthropist took up his pen, worn down in the cause of  humanity and of justice. _First_, he showed, by incontrovertible  evidence, the utter falsehood of the charge, that he had underrated the  merits of others and exalted his own. These proofs were the references  to his volumes themselves, which it really seemed as if the two reverend  authors had never even looked into. He then proved to demonstration that  he had taken the field earlier than William Wilberforce. This was shown,  first, by known dates, matter of history; next, by letters from the  friends of both parties, as Archdeacon Corbet and William Smith; but,  lastly, by the words of William Wilberforce himself, as well privately  as at public meetings, asserting that he (William Wilberforce) came into  the field after his valued friend. But a striking fact may be cited, as  a sample at once of the course pursued by the assailants, and the  completeness of the defence. The reverend authors in proof of their  unqualified assertion, that Thomas Clarkson and the Committee acted from  the first under William Wilberforce's directions, refer to \"MS. Minutes  of the Committee\" for their authority. But the friend who so ably  superintended the publication of Thomas Clarkson's defence, and who  added to that tract an appendix of singular merit and great interest  (H.C. Robinson), showed that the parts referred to by the reverend  authors, in proof of their assertion, completely disproved it; and that  six months after the Committee had been working, William Wilberforce  applied to them for any information of which they might be possessed on  the subject of the Slave Trade.    But the publication of the letters and the colour given to the  transaction were far worse. The preservation of that correspondence, at  all, by the sons, could only be justified by the belief of its being  accidentally kept by the father, but, of course, never intended to be  made public; least of all without the usual precaution of asking the  writer's leave, and giving him the opportunity of explaining it. The  biographers printed it without any kind of communication with him, and  he saw it for the first time in print.    Then, the attempt was made to represent this pure, and valuable, and  disinterested man as a mendicant philanthropist, who, for his exertions  in the cause of justice, stooped to the humiliating attitude of  collecting a remuneration from his friends. The words of William  Wilberforce, and other Abolition leaders, prove that he had expended a  very considerable portion of his own small patrimony in the cause, and  that the subscription was to pay a debt,--a just and lawful debt; not to  confer a bounty, or reward, or remuneration for services performed. It  is also proved, that after being reimbursed to the amount of the sum  contributed, or rather levied on those for whom the poorest of their  body had advanced his own money, he remained out of pocket far more than  others had ever given, after their share of the repayment was credited  to them, in this debtor and creditor account.    But this is not all: Mr. Wilberforce himself, then a man of ample  fortune, and Member for Yorkshire, had in 1807, published a pamphlet in  the cause. The Minutes of the Committee for 6th June, 1811, contained an  entry of an order to pay 83_l_. out of the subscription funds to Mr.  Cadell, being Mr. Wilberforce's share of the loss sustained by that  publication. There had been no mention at all of this in his life, by  these reverend authors, who scrupled not to print the garbled letters,  with the manifest design of lowering the character of their father's  friend, by ranking him among venal stipendiary pretenders to  philanthropy, and jobbing mendicant patriots.    Wherefore, it may be asked, was this matter at all dragged forth to  light, except to effect that unworthy purpose, and to give pain to a man  as eminently as deservedly respected and beloved? The false pretext is,  the vindication of their father's memory.--But it had never been  attacked. They affect to suppose such an attack, that they may have a  pretext for inflicting a wound in a fictitious and almost a fraudulent  defence.--But if it had been ever so rudely attacked, the letters are no  defence. For the only possible pretence of attack was the notion of  Thomas Clarkson having assumed the priority, and these letters can have  no earthly relation to that point. Whether Wilberforce, or Clarkson, or  neither of them, first began the abolition struggle, is a question as  utterly wide of the subscription as any one private matter in the life  of either party can be of any one public transaction in which both were  engaged.    The indignation of mankind was awakened by this disgraceful proceeding,  and it was in vain that the friends of the Wilberforces urged, as some  extenuation of their offence, the zeal which they naturally cherished  for the memory of their parent. Men of reflection felt that no  well-regulated mind can ever engage in slandering one person for the  purpose of elevating another. Men of ordinary discernment perceived that  the assaults on Clarkson's reputation had no possible tendency to raise  Wilberforce's reputation. Men of observation saw at once that there  lurked behind the wish to praise the one party, a desire to wound the  other; and gave them far less credit for over-anxiety to gratify their  filial affections than eagerness to indulge their hostile feelings. It  was plain, too, that they sought this gratification at the hazard of  bringing a stain upon the memory of their father; for what could be more  natural than the suspicion that they had obtained from him the materials  out of which their web of detraction was woven? And what more  discreditable to the author of the affectionate and familiar letters of  Wilberforce to Clarkson than their discrepancy with the charges now  urged against him? It is due to the memory of this venerable man, now  gone to his rest, to say that no one who knew him, ever so slightly,  could believe in the possibility of his holding one language to his  friend and another to his children: far less of his bequeathing to them  anything like materials for the attack upon one to whom he professed the  most warm and steady attachment. But if such be the conclusion of all  who knew the man, assuredly in arriving at it they have derived no help  from the lights afforded by his family.    The vindication of Thomas Clarkson has been triumphant; the punishment  of his traducers has been exemplary. His character stands higher than  ever; his name is lofty and it is unsullied; they have a character to  retrieve,--a"]]]
