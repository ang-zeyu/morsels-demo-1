The origin of many cases  of Graves' disease is closely associated with some of the causes  of the discharge of nervous energy, depressive influences especially,  such as nervous shocks, worry and nervous strain, disappointment in love,  business reverses, illness and death of relatives and friends.  The association of thyroid activity with procreation is well known,  hence the coincidence of a strain of overwork or of fear with  the sexual development of maturing girls is obviously favorable  to the incidence of Graves' disease.  The presence of a colloid goiter  is a suitable soil for the development of Graves' disease, and I  fully recognize also the evidence that infection or auto-intoxication  may be contributing factors and must be assigned their role.    I have never known a case of Graves' disease to be caused by success  or happiness alone, or by hard physical labor unattended by  psychic strain, or to be the result of energy voluntarily discharged.  Some cases seem to have had their origin in overdosage with thyroid  extract in too vigorous an attempt to cure a colloid goiter.  One of the most striking characteristics of Graves' disease is  the patient's loss of control and his increased susceptibility  to stimuli, especially to trauma and to fear and to the administration  of thyroid extract.  It has been shown that the various causes  of the discharge of nervous energy produce alterations in the nervous  system and probably in the thyroid gland.  This is especially  true of the fear stimulus, and has been clearly demonstrated  in the brains of rabbits which had been subjected to fear alone  (Fig. 13). Of special interest was the effect of daily fright.  In this case the brain-cells showed a distinct change, although the animal  had been subjected to no fear for twenty-four hours before it was killed  (Fig. 13 C. Now, a great distinction between man and the lower  animals is the greater control man has acquired over his actions.  This quality of control, having been phylogenetically most recently  acquired, is the most vulnerable to various NOCUOUS influences.  The result of a constant noci-integration may be a wearing-out  of the control cells of the brain.  In a typical case of Graves'  disease a marked morphologic change in the brain-cells has  been demonstrated (Fig. 15). As has been previously stated,  the origin of many cases of Graves' disease is associated  with some noci-influence. If this influence causes stimulation  of both the brain and the thyroid, its excessive action may cause  impairment of the brain and also hyperplasia of the thyroid.  As self-control is impaired, fear obtains an ascendency and,  _pari passu_, stimulates the thyroid still more actively (Fig. 16).  Finally, the fear of the disease itself becomes a noci-stimulus.  As the thyroid secretion causes an increase in the facility  with which nervous energy is discharged, a pathologic reciprocal  interaction is established between the brain and the thyroid.  The effect of the constantly recurring stimulus of the noci-influence  is heightened by summation.  This reciprocal goading may  continue until either the brain or the thyroid is destroyed.  If the original noci-stimulus is withdrawn before the fear of the  disease becomes too strong, and before too much injury to the brain  and the thyroid has been inflicted, a spontaneous cure may result.  Recovery may be greatly facilitated by complete therapeutic rest.  A cure implies the return of the brain-cells to their normal state,  with the reestablishment of the normal self-control and the  restoration of the thyroid to its normal state, when the impulses  of daily life will once more have possession of the final  common path and the noci-influence will be dispossessed.  The discovery of the real cause of a given case of Graves' disease is  frequently difficult because it may be of a painful personal nature.  Of extreme interest is the fact that, in the acute stage,  the patient may be unable to refer to the exciting cause without  exhibiting an exacerbation of the symptoms of the disease.  I presume no case should be regarded as cured until reference  can be made to its cause without an abnormal reaction.  It has been established that in Graves' disease injury to any part  of the body, even under inhalation anesthesia, causes an exacerbation  of the disease.  Fear alone may cause an acute exacerbation.  These acute exacerbations are frequently designated \"hyperthyroidism\"  and are the special hazard of operation.    In applying the principle of anoci-association in operations on  patients with Graves' disease there is scarcely a change in the pulse,  in the respiration, or in the nervous state at the close of the operation.  I know no remedy which can obviate the effect of the inflowing  stimuli from the wound after the cocain[*] has worn off.[t] It  is necessary, therefore,      Beats 70 80 90 100 110 120        Ether ******* ******** ******** ******** ********        N2O ******* ******** ******** ******** *        Anoci.  ******* ******** ******** ** not to venture too far  in serious cases.  Since the adoption of this new method  (anoci-association) my operative results have been so vastly improved  that I now rarely regard any case of Graves' disease as inoperable,  at least to the extent of contraindicating a double ligation (Fig. 17).      [*] See footnote, page 4.@@@    [t] In later papers and in \"Anoci-association\" (Crile and Lower)  methods of combating postoperative hyperthyroidism are fully discussed.      If we believe that, in accordance with the law of phylogenetic association,  a continuous stimulation of both the brain and the thyroid gland,  accelerated by summation, plays a role in the establishment  of the pathologic interaction seen in Graves' disease, then it  is but the next step to assume that if the nerve connection between  the brain and the thyroid be severed, or if the lobe be excised  and the patient reinforced by a sojourn in a sanatorium or in some  environment free from former noci-associations, he may be restored  to normal health, provided that the brain-cells, the heart,  or other essential organs have not suffered irreparable damage.  There are still many missing links in the solution of this problem,  and the foregoing hypotheses are not offered as final, although from  the viewpoint of the surgeon many of the phenomena of this  disease are explicable.      Sexual-Neurasthenia      The state of sexual neurasthenia is in many respects analogous  to that of Graves' disease.  In the sexual reflexes, summation leads  to a hyperexcitability by psychic and mechanical stimuli of a  specific type which is analogous to the hyperexcitability in Graves'  disease under trauma and fear; the explanation of both conditions  is based on the laws of the discharge of energy by phylogenetic  association and summation.  It would be interesting to observe  the effect of interrupting the nerve impulses from the field of  the sexual receptors by injections of alcohol, or by other agencies,  so as to exclude the associational stimuli until the nervous  mechanism has again become restored to its normal condition.  Interpretation of Some of the Phenomena of Certain Diseases of the  Abdomen in Accordance with the Hypothesis of Phylogenetic Association      The law of phylogenetic association seems to explain many  of the phenomena of certain lesions in the abdominal cavity.  The nociceptors in the abdomen, like nociceptors elsewhere, have been  established as a result of some kind of injury to which during  vast periods of time this region has been frequently exposed.  On this premise, we should at once conclude that there are no  nociceptors for heat within the abdomen because, during countless years,  the intra-abdominal region never came into contact with heat.  That this inference is correct is shown by the fact that the  application of a thermocautery to the intestines when completing  a colostomy in a conscious patient is absolutely painless.  One would conclude also that there are no touch receptors in the  abdominal viscera, and therefore no sense of touch in the peritoneum.  Just as the larynx, the ear, the nose, the sole of the foot,  and the skin have all developed the specific type of nociceptors  which are adapted for their specific protective purposes, and which,  when adequately stimulated, respond in a specific manner in accordance  with the law of phylogenetic association, so, the abdominal viscera  have developed equally specific nociceptors as a protection against  specific nocuous influences.  The principal harmful influences  to which the abdominal viscera have been exposed during vast periods  of time are deep tearing injuries by teeth and claws in the innumerable  struggles of our progenitors with each other and with their enemies  (Fig. 9); peritonitis caused by perforations of the intestinal  tract from ulcers, injuries, appendicitis, gall-stones, etc.;  and overdistention of the hollow viscera by various forms of obstruction.  Whatever may be the explanation, it is a fact that the type  of trauma which results from fighting corresponds closely with  that which causes the most shock in the experimental laboratory.  Division of the intestines with a sharp knife causes no pain,  but pulling on the mesentery elicits pain.  Ligating the stump  of the appendix causes sharp, cramp-like pains.  Sharp division  of the gall-bladder causes no pain, but distention, which is  the gall-bladder's most common pathologic state, produces pain.  Distention of the intestine causes great pain, but sharp cutting or burning  causes none.  In the abdominal viscera, as in the superficial parts,  nociceptors have presumably been developed by specific harmful  influences and each nociceptor is open to stimulation only by a  stimulus of the particular type that produced it.
