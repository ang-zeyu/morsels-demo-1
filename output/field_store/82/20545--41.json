The first time I was sprinkled, a  white preacher did it; I think his name was Williams.    \"The preacher would preach to the white folks in the forenoon and to the  colored folks in the evening. The white folks had them hired. One of  them preachers was named Hackett; another, Williams; and another, Gowan.  There was five of them but I just remember them three. One man used to  hold the slaves so late that they had to go to the church dirty from  their work. They would be sweaty and smelly. So the preacher 'buked him  'bout it. That was old man Bill Rose.    \"The niggers didn't go to the church building; the preacher came and  preached to them in their quarters. He'd just say, 'Serve your masters.  Don't steal your master's turkey. Don't steal your master's chickens.  Don't steal your master's hawgs. Don't steal your master's meat. Do  whatsomeever your master tells you to do.' Same old thing all the time.    \"My father would have church in dwelling houses and they had to whisper.  My mother was dead and I would go with him. Sometimes they would have  church at his house. That would be when they would want a real meetin'  with some real preachin'. It would have to be durin' the week nights.  You couldn't tell the difference between Baptists and Methodists then.  They was all Christians. I never saw them turn nobody down at the  communion, but I have heard of it. I never saw them turn no pots down  neither; but I have heard of that. They used to sing their songs in a  whisper and pray in a whisper. That was a prayer-meeting from house to  house once or twice--once or twice a week.    \"Old Phipps whipped me once. He aimed to kill me but I got loose. He  whipped me about a colored girl of his'n that he had by a colored woman.  Phipps went with a colored woman before he married his wife. He had a  girl named Martha Ann Phipps. I beat Martha 'bout a pair of stockings.  My mistress bought me a nice pair of stockings from the store. You see,  they used to knit the stockings. I wore the stockings once; then I  washed them and put them on the fence to dry. Martha stole them and put  them on. I beat her and took them off of her. She ran and told her  father and he ran me home. He couldn't catch me, and he told me he'd get  me. I didn't run to my father. I run to my mistress, and he knew he'd  better not do nothin' then. He said, 'I'll get you, you little old black  some thin'.' Only he didn't say 'somethin'.' He didn't get me then.    \"But one day he caught me out by his house. I had gone over that way on  an errand I needn't have done. He had two girls hold me. They was  Angeline and Nancy. They didn't much want to hold me anyhow. Some  niggers would catch you and kill you for the white folks and then there  was some that wouldn't. I got loose from them. He tried to hold me  hisself but he couldn't. I got away and went back to my old mistress and  she wrote him a note never to lay his dirty hands on me again. A little  later her brother, Johnson Chatman, came there and ran him off the  place. My old mistress' name was Susan Chatman before she married. Then  she married Toliver. Then she married Reed. She married Reed last--after  Toliver died.    \"One old lady named Emily Moorehead runned in and held my mother once  for Phipps to whip her. And my mother was down with consumption too. I  aimed to git old Phipps for that. But then I got religion and I couldn't  do it. Religion makes you forgit a heap of things.    \"Susan Reed, my old mistress, bought my father and paid fifteen hundred  dollars for him and she hadn't never seen 'im. Advertising. He had run  away so much that they had to advertise and sell 'im. He never would run  away from Miss Susan. She was good to him till she got that old nigger  beater Phipps. Her husband, Reed, was called a nigger spoiler. My father  was an old man when Phipps was on overseer and wasn't able to fight much  then.    \"Phipps sure was a bad man. He wasn't so bad neither; but the niggers  was scared of him. You know in slave times, sometimes when a master  would git too bad, the niggers would kill him--tote him off out in the  woods somewheres and git rid of him. Two or three of them would git  together and scheme it out, and then two or three of them would git him  way out and kill 'im. But they didn't nobody ever pull nothin' like  that on Phipps. They was scared of him.    \"One time I saw the Yankees a long way off. They had on blue uniforms  and was on coal black horses. I hollered out, 'Oh, I see somethin'.' My  mistress said, 'What?' I told her, and she said, 'Them's the Yankees.'  She went on in the house and I went with her. She sacked up all the  valuables in the house. She said, 'Here,' and she threw a sack of silver  on me that was so heavy that I went right on down to the ground. Then  she took hold of it and holp me up and holp me carry it out. I carried  it out and hid it. She had three buckskin sacks--all full of silver.  That wasn't now; that was in slavery times. During the War, Jeff Davis  gave out Confederate money. It died out on the folks' hands. About  twelve hundred dollars of it died out on my father's hands. But there  wasn't nothin' but gold and silver in them sacks.    \"I heard them tell the slaves they were free. A man named Captain Barkus  who had his arm off at the elbow called for the three near-by  plantations to meet at our place. Then he got up on a platform with  another man beside him and declared peace and freedom. He p'inted to a  colored man and yelled, 'You're free as I am.' Old colored folks, old as  I am now, that was on sticks, throwed them sticks away and shouted.    \"Right after freedom I stayed with that white woman I told you about. I  was with her about four years. I worked for twelve dollars a month and  my food and clothes. Then I figured that twelve dollars wasn't enough  and I went to work in the field. It was a mighty nice woman. Never hit  me in her life. I never have been whipped by a white woman. She was good  to me till she died. She died after I had my second child--a girl child.    \"I have been living in this city fifteen years. I come from Chicot  County when I come here. We come to Arkansas in slavery times. They  brought me from Copiah County when I was six or eight years old. When  Mrs. Toliver married she came up here and brought my mother. My mother  belonged to her son and she said, 'Agnes (that was my mother's name),  will you follow me if I buy your husband?' Her husband's name was John  Beasley. She said, 'Yes.' Then her old mistress bought Beasley and paid  fifteen hundred dollars to get my mother to come with her. Then Peachy  went to war and was shot because he come home of a furlough and stayed  too long. So when he went back they killed him. My mother nursed him  when he was a baby. Old man Toliver said he didn't want none of us to be  sold; so they wasn't none of us sold. Maybe there would have been if  slavery had lasted longer; but there wasn't.    \"Mother really belonged to Peachy, but when Peachy died, then she fell  to her mistress.    \"I have been a widow now for thirty years. I washed and ironed and  plowed and hoed--everything. Now I am gittin' so I ain't able to do  nothin' and the Relief keeps me alive. I worked and took care of myself  and my last husband and he died, and I ain't married since. I used to  take a little boy and make ten bales of cotton. I can't do it now. I  used to be a woman in my day. I am my mother's seventh child.    \"I don't buy no hoodoo and I don't believe in none, but a seventh child  can more or less tell you things that are a long way off. If you want to  beat the devil you got to do right. God's got to be in the plan. I tries  to do right. I am not perfect but I do the best I can. I ain't got no  bottom teeth, but my top ones are good. I have a few bottom ones. The  Lawd's keepin' me here for somepin. I been with 'im now seventy-three  years.\"      Interviewer's Comment    I'll bet the grandest moment in the life of Sister Alexander's mother  was when her mistress said, \"Agnes, will you follow me if I buy your  husband?\" Fifteen hundred dollars to buy a rebellious slave in order to  unite a slave couple. It's epic.          Interviewer: Miss Irene Robertson  Person interviewed: Ed Allen, Des Arc, Ark.  Age: ?      \"I know that after freedom they took care of my pa and ma and give em a  home long as they lived. Ma died wid young mistress here in Des Arc.    \"The present generation is going to the bad. Have dealings wid em, not  good to you. Young folks ain't nice to you like they used to be.    \"White boys and colored boys, whole crowd of us used to go in the river  down here all together, one got in danger help him out. They don't do it  no more. We used to play base ball together. All had a good time. We  never had to buy a ball or a bat. Always had em. The white boys bought  them.

She said she helped grade a hill and help  pile up a road between Wicksburg and Wynne. They couldn't put the road  over the hill, so they put all the slaves about to grade it down. They  don't use the road but it's still there to show for itself.    \"She was a tall rawbony woman. Ma was a Hillis and pa's name was Adam  Hillis. He learned to trap in slavery and after freedom he followed that  for a living. Ma was a sure 'nough field hand. Mama had three sets of  children. I don't know how many she did have in all.

Thou risest, thou risest, thou shinest, thou shinest, O    thou who art crowned king of the gods. Thou art the lord of heaven,    thou art the lord of earth; thou art the creator of those who dwell in    the heights, and of those who dwell in the depths. Thou art the One    God who came into being in the beginning of time. Thou didst create    the earth, thou didst fashion man, thou didst make the watery abyss of    the sky, thou didst form Hapi (_i.e._, the Nile), thou didst create    the great deep, and thou dost give life unto all that therein is. Thou    hast knit together the mountains, thou hast made mankind and the    beasts of the field to come into being, thou hast made the heavens and    the earth. Worshipped be thou whom the goddess Maat embraceth at morn    and at eve. Thou dost travel across the sky with thy heart swelling    with joy; the great deep of heaven is content thereat. The    serpent-fiend Nak [Footnote: A name of the Serpent of darkness which    R[=a] slew daily.] hath fallen, and his arms are cut off.

Millions of years have gone over    the world. I cannot tell the number of those through which thou hast    passed. Thy heart hath decreed a day of happiness in thy name of    'Traveller.'

FROM THE PAPYRUS OF ANI. [Footnote: Plate 20.]    The following beautiful composition, part hymn and part prayer, is of  exceptional interest.      \"Hail, thou Disk, thou lord of rays, who risest on the horizon day by    day! Shine thou with thy beams of light upon the face of Osiris Ani,    who is true of voice; for he singeth hymns of praise unto thee at    dawn, and he maketh thee to set at eventide with words of adoration,    May the soul of Ani come forth with thee into heaven, may he go forth    in the M[=a]tet boat, may he come into port in the Sektet boat, and    may he cleave his path among the never-resting stars in the heavens.      \"Osiris Ani, being in peace and triumph, adoreth his lord, the lord of    eternity, saying, 'Homage to thee, O Heru-Khuti (Harmachis), who art    the god Khepera, the self-created one; when thou risest on the horizon    and sheddest thy beams of light upon the lands of the North and of the    South, thou art beautiful, yea beautiful, and all the gods rejoice    when they behold thee, the king of heaven. The goddess Nebt-Unnut is    stablished upon thy head; and her uraei of the South and of the North    are upon thy brow; she taketh up her place before thee. The god. Thoth    is stablished in the bows of thy boat to destroy utterly all thy foes.    Those who are in the Tuat (underworld) come forth to meet thee, and    they bow low in homage as they come towards thee, to behold thy    beautiful form. And I have come before thee that I may be with thee to    behold thy Disk each day. May I not be shut up [in the tomb], may I    not be turned back, may the limbs of my body be made new again when I    view thy beauties, even as [are those of] all thy favoured ones,    because I am one of those who worshipped thee upon earth. May I come    unto the land of eternity, may I come even unto the everlasting land,    for behold, O my lord, this hast thou ordained for me.'      \"'Homage to thee, O thou who risest in thy horizon as R[=a], thou    restest upon Ma[=a]t, [Footnote: _i.e._, unchanging and unalterable    law.] Thou passest over the sky, and every face watcheth thee and thy    course, for thou hast been hidden from their gaze. Thou dost show    thyself at dawn and at eventide day by day. The Sektet boat, wherein,    is thy Majesty, goeth forth with might; thy beams are upon [all]    faces; thy rays of red and yellow cannot be known, and thy bright    beams cannot be told. The lands of the gods and the eastern lands of    Punt [Footnote: _i.e._, the east and west coasts of the Red Sea, and    the north-east coast of Africa.] must be seen ere that which, is    hidden [in thee] may be measured. [Footnote: I am doubtful about the    meaning of this passage.] Alone and by thyself thou, dost manifest    thyself [when] thou comest into being above Nu. May I advance, even as    thou dost advance; may I never cease [to go forward], even as thy    Majesty ceaseth not [to go forward], even though it be for a moment;    for with strides dost thou in one brief moment pass over spaces which    [man] would need hundreds of thousand; yea, millions of years to pass    over; [this] thou doest, and then thou dost sink to rest. Thou puttest    an end to the hours of the night, and thou dost count them, even thou;    thou endest them in thine own appointed season, and the earth,    becometh light, Thou settest thyself before thy handiwork in the    likeness of R[=a]; thou risest in the horizon.'      \"Osiris; the scribe Ani, declareth his praise of thee when thou    shinest, and when thou risest at dawn he crieth in his joy at thy    birth, saying:--      \"'Thou art crowned with the majesty of thy beauties; thou mouldest thy    limbs as thou dost advance, and thou bringest them forth without    birth-pangs in the form of R[=a], as thou dost rise up in the    celestial height. Grant thou that I may come unto the heaven which is    everlasting, and unto the mountain where dwell thy favoured ones. May    I be joined unto those shining beings, holy and perfect, who are in    the underworld; and may I come forth with them to behold thy beauties    when thou shinest at eventide, and goest to thy mother Nut. Thou dost    place thyself in the west, and my hands adore [thee] when thou settest    as a living being. [Footnote: _i.e._, \"because when thou settest thou    dost not die.\"] Behold, thou art the everlasting creator, and thou art    adored [as such when] thou settest in the heavens. I have given my    heart to thee without wavering, O thou who art mightier than the    gods.'      \"A hymn of praise to thee, O thou who risest like unto gold, and who    dost flood the world with light on the day of thy birth. Thy mother    giveth thee birth, and straightway thou dost give light upon the path    of [thy] Disk, O thou great Light who shinest in the heavens. Thou    makest the generations of men to flourish through the Nile-flood, and    thou dost cause gladness to exist in all lands, and in, all cities,    and in all temples. Thou art glorious by reason of thy splendours, and    thou makest strong thy KA (_i.e._ Double) with, divine foods, O thou    mighty one of victories, thou Power of Powers, who dost make strong    thy throne against evil fiends--thou who art glorious in Majesty in    the Sektet boat, and most mighty in the [=A]tet [Footnote: The Sun's    evening and morning boats respectively.] boat!\" This selection may be    fittingly closed by a short hymn [Footnote: From the Papyrus of Nekht    (Brit. Mus. No. 10,471).] which, though, of a later date, reproduces    in a brief form all the essentials of the longer hymns of the XVIIIth    dynasty (about B.C. 1700 to 1400).      \"Homage to thee, O thou glorious Being, thou who art dowered [with all    sovereignty]. O Temu-Harma-chis, [Footnote: The evening and morning    sun respectively.] when thou risest in the horizon of heaven, a cry of    joy cometh forth, to thee from the mouth of all peoples, O thou    beautiful Being, thou dost renew thyself in thy season in the form of    the Disk within thy mother Hathor; [Footnote: Like Nut, a goddess of    the sky, but particularly of that portion of it in which the sun    rises.] therefore in every place every heart swelleth with joy at thy    rising for ever. The regions of the North and South come to thee with    homage, and send forth, acclamations at thy rising in the horizon of    heaven; thou illuminest the two lands with rays of turquoise light.    Hail, R[=a], thou who art R[=a]-Harmachis, thou divine man-child, heir    of eternity, self-begotten and self-born, king of the earth, prince of    the underworld, governor of the regions of Aukert (_i.e._ the    underworld)!
