In this way all the  organic matter will be burned, and the tube will resume its former  porosity.--_M. Chamberland, La Nature._           *       *       *       *       *          SIMPLE DEVICES FOR DISTILLING WATER.      The alchemists dreamed and talked of that universal solvent which they so  long and vainly endeavored to discover; still, for all this, not only the  alchemist of old, but his more immediate successor, the chemist of to-day,  has found no solvent so universal as water. No liquid has nearly so wide a  range of dissolving powers, and, taking things all round, no liquid  exercises so slight an action upon the bodies dissolved--evaporate the  water away, and the dissolved substance is obtained in an unchanged  condition; at any rate, this is the general rule.    The function of water in nature is essentially that of a solvent or a  medium of circulation; it is not, in any sense, a food, yet without it no  food can be assimilated by an animal. Without water the solid materials of  the globe would be unable to come together so closely as to interchange  their elements; and unless the temperatures were sufficiently high to  establish an igneous fluidity, such as undoubtedly exists in the sun, there  would be no circulation of matter to speak of, and the earth would be, as  it were, locked up or dead.    When we look upon water as the nearest approach to a universal solvent that  even the astute scientist of to-day has been able to discover, who can  wonder that it is never found absolutely pure in nature? For wherever it  accumulates it dissolves something from its surroundings. Still, in a  rain-drop just formed we have very nearly pure water; but even this  contains dissolved air to the extent of about one-fiftieth of its volume,  and as the drop falls downward it takes up such impurities as may be  floating in the atmosphere; so that if our rain-drop is falling  immediately after a long drought, it becomes charged with nitrate or  nitrite of ammonia and various organic matters--perhaps also the spores or  germs of disease. Thus it will be seen that rain tends to wonderfully clear  or wash the atmosphere, and we all know how much a first rain is  appreciated as an air purifier, and how it carries down with it valuable  food for plants. The rain-water, in percolating through or over the land,  flows mainly toward the rivers, and in doing so it becomes more or less  charged with mineral matter, lime salts and common salt being the chief of  them; while some of that water which has penetrated more deeply into the  earth takes up far more solid matter than is ordinarily found in river  water. The bulk of this more or less impure water tends toward the ocean,  taking with it its load of salt and lime. Constant evaporation, of course,  takes place from the surface of the sea, so that the salt and lime  accumulate, this latter being, however, ultimately deposited as shells,  coral, and chalk, while nearly pure or naturally distilled water once more  condenses in the form of clouds. This process, by which a constant supply  of purified water is kept up in the natural economy, is imitated on a small  scale when water is converted into steam by the action of heat, and this  vapor is cooled so as to reproduce liquid water, the operation in question  being known as distillation.    For this purpose an apparatus known as a still is required; and although by  law one must pay an annual license fee for the right to use a still, it is  not usual for the government authorities to enforce the law when a still is  merely used for purifying water.    One of the best forms of still for the photographer to employ consists of a  tin can or bottle in which the water is boiled, and to this a tin tube is  adapted by means of a cork, one end of this tin tube terminating in a coil  passing through a tub or other vessel of cold water. A gas burner, as  shown, is a convenient source of heat, and in order to insure a complete  condensation of the vapor, the water in the cooling tub must be changed now  and again.    [Illustration]    Sometimes the vapor is condensed by being allowed to play against the  inside of a conical cover which is adapted to a saucepan, and is kept cool  by the external application of cold water; and in this case the still takes  the form represented by the subjoined diagrams; such compact and portable  stills being largely employed in Ireland for the private manufacture of  whisky.    [Illustration]    It is scarcely necessary to say that the condensed water trickles down on  the inside of the cone, and flows out at the spout.    An extemporized arrangement of a similar character may be made by passing a  tobacco pipe through the side of a tin saucepan as shown below, and  inverting the lid of the saucepan; if the lid is now kept cool by frequent  changes of water inside it, and the pipe is properly adjusted so as to  catch the drippings from the convex side of the lid, a considerable  quantity of distilled water may be collected in an hour or so.    The proportion of solid impurities present in water as ordinarily met with  is extremely variable: rain water which has been collected toward the end  of a storm contains only a minute fraction of a grain per gallon, while  river or spring water may contain from less than thirty grains per gallon  or so and upward. Ordinary sea water generally contains from three to four  per cent. of saline matter, but that of the Dead Sea contains nearly  one-fourth of its weight of salts.    [Illustration]    The three impurities of water which most interest the photographer are lime  or magnesia salts, which give the so-called hardness; chlorides (as, for  example, chloride of sodium or common salt), which throw down silver salts;  and organic matter, which may overturn the balance of photographic  operations by causing premature reduction of the sensitive silver  compounds. To test for them is easy. Hardness is easily recognizable by  washing one's hands in the water, the soap being curdled; but in many cases  one must rather seek for a hard water than avoid it, as the tendency of  gelatine plates to frill is far less in hard water than in soft water. It  is, indeed, a common and useful practice to harden the water used for  washing by adding half an ounce or an ounce of Epsom salts (sulphate of  magnesia) to each bucket of water. Chlorides--chloride of sodium or common  salt being that usually met with--may be detected by adding a drop or two  of nitrate of silver to half a wineglassful of the water, a few drops of  nitric acid being then added. A slight cloudiness indicates a trace of  chlorides, and a decided milkiness shows the presence of a larger quantity.  If it is wished to get a somewhat more definite idea of the amount, it is  easy to make up a series of standards for comparison, by dissolving known  weights of common salt in distilled or rain water, and testing samples of  them side by side with the water to be examined.    Organic matters may be detected by adding a little nitrate of silver to the  water, filtering off from any precipitate of chloride of silver, and  exposing the clear liquid to sunlight; a clean stoppered bottle being the  most convenient vessel to use. The extent to which a blackening takes place  may be regarded as approximately proportionate to the amount of organic  matter present.    Filtration on a small scale is not altogether a satisfactory mode of  purifying water, as organic impurities often accumulate in the filter, and  enter into active putrefaction when hot weather sets in.--_Photo. News._           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED FIRE-DAMP DETECTER.      According to the London _Mining Journal_, Mr. W.E. Garforth, of Normanton,  has introduced an ingenious invention, the object of which is to detect  fire-damp in collieries with the least possible degree of risk to those  engaged in the work. Mr. Garforth's invention, which is illustrated in the  diagram given below, consists in the use of a small India rubber hand ball,  without a valve of any description; but by the ordinary action of  compressing the ball, and then allowing it to expand, a sample of the  suspected atmosphere is drawn from the roof, or any part of the mine,  without the great risk which now attends the operation of testing for gas  should the gauze of the lamp be defective. The sample thus obtained is then  forced through a small protected tube on to the flame, when if gas is  present it is shown by the well-known blue cap and elongated flame. From  this description, and from the fact that the ball is so small that it can  be carried in the coat pocket, or, if necessary, in the waistcoat pocket,  it will be apparent what a valuable adjunct Mr. Garforth's invention will  prove to the safety-lamp. It has been supposed by some persons that  explosions have been caused by the fire-trier himself, but owing to his own  death in most cases the cause has remained undiscovered. This danger will  now be altogether avoided. It is well known that the favorite form of lamp  with the firemen is the Davy, because it shows more readily the presence of  small quantities of gas; but the Davy was some years ago condemned, and is  now strictly prohibited in all Belgian and many English mines. Recent  experience, gained by repeated experiments with costly apparatus, has  resulted in not only proving the Davy and some other descriptions of lamps  to be unsafe, but some of our Government Inspectors and our most  experienced mining engineers go so far as to say that \"no lamp in a strong  current of explosive gas is safe unless protected by a tin shield.\"    [Illustration]    If such is the case, Mr. Garforth seems to have struck the key-note when,  in the recent paper read before the Midland Institute of Mining and Civil  Engineers, and which we have now before us, he says: \"It"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11740"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.

Across the space, within the  circle of light, there was a broad stream of dusky cloud, formed of  three distinct streaks, and reaching from one of the most distant mock  suns to another opposite to it, in the shape of a low arch; but in a  little while one extremity of this bar moved away from its original  position, while the other end remained stationary, leading me to suppose  that it was merely an accidental piece of cloud.    As noon approached, or rather as the clouds dispersed, the blue hazy sky  extended beyond the ring of light, and while the day advanced, and the  heavens grew more clear, the whole meteor gradually disappeared, the  circle vanishing first, and then the imitative suns. My companions  assured me they had never before witnessed a similar exhibition during  voyages in these seas; but more learned Thebans describe them as  phenomena frequently witnessed in high latitudes, and have assigned them  the designation of parhelia. There was, during this solar panorama, a  large and complete semicircle of haze, lighter in colour than the  surrounding fog, resting on the horizon perpendicularly, like a rainbow,  but this appearance my associates informed me was familiar to their  sight.--_Tales of a Voyager in the Arctic Ocean_.           *       *       *       *       *      THE ANECDOTE GALLERY.             *       *       *       *       *      BROILING STEAKS.    _A Munchausen Story_.      \"Talking of broiling steaks--when I was in Egypt we used to broil our  beef-steaks on the locks--no occasion for fire--thermometer at 200--hot  as h-ll! I have seen four thousand men at a time cooking for the whole  army as much as twenty or thirty thousand pounds of steaks at a time, all  hissing and frying at a time--just about noon, of course, you know--not a  spark of fire! Some of the soldiers who had been brought up as  glass-blowers at Leith swore they never saw such heat. I used to go to  leeward of them for a whiff, and think of old England! Ay! that's the  country, after all, where a man may think and say what he pleases! But  that sort of work did not last long, as you may suppose; their eyes were  all fried out, ---- me, in three or four weeks! I had been ill in my bed,  for I was attached to the 72nd regiment, seventeen hundred strong. I had  a party of seamen with me; but the ophthalmia made such ravages, that the  whole regiment, colonel and all, went stone-blind--all, except one  corporal! You may stare, gentlemen, but it's very true. Well, this  corporal had a precious time of it: he was obliged to lead out the whole  regiment to water--he led the way, and two or three took hold of the  skirts of his jacket on each side; the skirts of these were seized again  by as many more; and double the number to the last, and so all held on by  one another, till they had all had a drink at the well; and, as the devil  would have it, there was but one well among us all--so this corporal used  to water the regiment just as a groom waters his horses; and all  spreading out, you know, just like the tail of a peacock.\"--\"Of which the  corporal was the rump,\" interrupted the doctor. The captain looked grave.  \"You found it warm in that country?\" inquired the surgeon. \"Warm!\"  exclaimed the captain; \"I'll tell you what, doctor, when you go where you  have sent many a patient, and where, for that very reason, you certainly  will go, I only hope, for your sake, and for that of your profession in  general, that you will not find it quite so hot as we found it in Egypt.  What do you think of nineteen of my men being killed by the concentrated  rays of light falling on the barrels of the sentinels' bright muskets,  and setting fire to the powder? I commanded a mortar battery at Acre, and  I did the French infernal mischief with the shells. I used to pitch in  among them when they had sat down to dinner; but how do you think the  scoundrels weathered on me at last? ---- me, they trained a parcel of  poodle dogs to watch the shells when they fell, and then to run and pull  the fusees out with their teeth. Did you ever hear of such villains? By  this means they saved hundreds of men, and only lost half-a-dozen  dogs--fact, by----; only ask Sir Sydney Smith, he'll tell you the same,  and a ---- sight more.\" * * * * He continued his lies, and dragged in as  usual the name of Sir Sydney Smith to support his assertions. \"If you  doubt me, only ask Sir Sydney Smith; he'll talk to you about Acre for  thirty-six hours on a stretch, without taking breath; his cockswain at  last got so tired of it, that he nick-named him '_Long Acre_.'\" * * *  \"Capital salmon this,\" said the captain; \"where does Billet get it from?  By the by, talking of that, did you ever hear of the pickled salmon in  Scotland?\" We all replied in the affirmative. \"Oh, you don't take. Hang  it, I don't mean dead pickled salmon; I mean live pickled salmon,  swimming about in tanks, as merry as grigs, and as hungry as rats.\" We  all expressed our astonishment at this, and declared we never heard of it  before. \"I thought not,\" said he, \"for it has only lately been introduced  into this country by a particular friend of mine, Dr. Mac--. I cannot  just now remember his----, jaw-breaking, Scotch name; he was a great  chemist and geologist, and all that sort of thing--a clever fellow, I can  tell you, though you may laugh. Well, this fellow, sir, took Nature by  the heels, and capsized her, as we say. I have a strong idea that he had  sold himself to the d--l. Well, what does he do, but he catches salmon  and puts them into tanks, and every day added more and more salt, till  the water was as thick as gruel, and the fish could hardly wag their  tails in it. Then he threw in whole pepper-corns, half-a-dozen pounds at  a time, till there was enough. Then he began to dilute with vinegar until  his pickle was complete. The fish did not half like it at first; but  habit is every thing; and when he showed me his tank, they were swimming  about as merry as a shoal of dace: he fed them with fennel, chopped  small, and black pepper-corns. 'Come, doctor,' says I, 'I trust no man  upon tick; if I don't taste I won't believe my own eyes, though I _can_  believe my _tongue_.' (We looked at each other.) 'That you shall do in a  minute,' says he; so he whipped one of them out with a landing-net; and  when I stuck my knife into him, the pickle ran out of his body like wine  out of a claret-bottle, and I ate at least two pounds of the rascal,  while he flapped his tail in my face. I never tasted such salmon as that.  Worth your while to go to Scotland, if it's only for the sake of eating  live pickled salmon. I'll give you a letter, any of you, to my friend.  He'll be d--d glad to see you; and then you may convince yourselves. Take  my word for it, if once you eat salmon that way, you will never eat it  any other.\"--_The Naval Officer_.           *       *       *       *       *      NAPOLEON AT FONTAINBLEAU,    _As related by De Bausset_.      On the evening of April 8, 1814, De Bausset left Blois, commissioned by  Josephine to deliver at Paris, a letter to the Emperor of Austria, and  afterwards another at Fontainbleau to her husband. Having executed the  first part of this commission, he set out at two in the morning of the  11th of April for Fontainbleau, and arrived at the palace about nine  o'clock. He was introduced to Napoleon immediately, and gave him the  letter from the empress. \"Good Louise!\" exclaimed Napoleon, after having  read it, and then asked numerous questions as to her health and that of  his son. De Bausset expressed his wish to carry back an answer to the  empress, and Napoleon promised to give him a letter in the afternoon. He  was calm and decided; but his tones were milder, and his manners mere  gentle than was his wont. He began talking about Elba, and showed to De  B. the maps and books of geography which he had been consulting on the  subject of his future little empire. \"The air is good,\" said he, \"and the  inhabitants well-disposed: I shall not be very ill off there, and I hope  Marie-Louise will put up with it as well as I shall.\" He knew that for  the present they were not to meet, but his hope was that when she was  once in the possession of the duchy of Parma, she and his son would be  allowed to reside with him in the island. But he never saw either again.  The prince of Neufchatel, Berthier, entered the room to demand permission  to go to Paris on his private affairs; he would return the next day.  After he had left the room, Napoleon said with a melancholy  tone:--\"Never! he will never return hither!\" \"What, sire!\" replied Maret,  who was present, \"can that be the farewell of your Berthier?\" \"Yes! I  tell you; he will not return.\" He did not. At two o'clock in the  afternoon Napoleon sent again for De Bausset. He was walking on the  terrace under the gallery of Francis I. He questioned De B. as to all he  had seen or heard during the late events; he found great fault with the  measure adopted by the council in leaving Paris; the letter to his  brother, upon which they acted, had been written under very different  circumstances; the presence of Louise at Paris would have prevented the  treason and defection of many of his soldiers, and he should still have  been at the head of a formidable army, with which he could have forced  his enemies to quit France and sign an honourable peace. De B. expressed  his regret that peace had not been made at Chatillon. \"I never could put  any confidence,\" said Napoleon, \"in the good faith of our enemies. Every  day they made fresh demands, imposed fresh conditions; they did not wish  to have peace--and then--I had declared publicly to all France that I  would not submit to humiliating terms, although the enemy were on the  heights of Montmartre.\" De B. remarked that France within the Rhine would"]]]
