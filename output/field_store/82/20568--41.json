The next  day, however, horsemen of the Parliament galloping through the country  proclaimed that they had been defeated; but it was not till next day  that the true state of affairs became known. Then the news came that the  battle had indeed been a drawn one.    On the 26th of October Charles marched with his army into Oxford. So  complete was the ignorance of the inhabitants as to the movements of the  armies that at Abingdon the news of his coming was unknown, and Harry  was astonished on the morning of the 27th at hearing a great trampling  of horsemen. Looking out, he beheld his father at the head of the troop,  approaching the house. With a shout of joy the lad rushed downstairs and  met his father at the entrance.    \"I did not look to be back so soon, Harry,\" Sir Henry said, as he  alighted from his horse. \"We arrived at Oxford last night, and I am sent  on with my troop to see that no Parliament bands are lurking in the  neighborhood.\"    Before entering the house the colonel dismissed his troop, telling them  that until the afternoon they could return to their homes, but must then  re-assemble and hold themselves in readiness to advance, should he  receive further orders. Then, accompanied by his officers, he entered  the house. Breakfast was speedily prepared, and when this was done  justice to Sir Henry proceeded to relate to Harry, who was burning with  impatience to hear his news, the story of the battle of Edgehill.    \"We reached Shrewsbury, as I wrote you,\" he said, \"and stayed there  twenty days, and during that time the army swelled and many nobles and  gentlemen joined us. We were, however, it must be owned, but a motley  throng. The foot soldiers, indeed, were mostly armed with muskets; but  many had only sticks and cudgels. On the 12th we moved to Wolverhampton,  and so on through Birmingham and Kenilworth. We saw nothing of the  rebels till we met at Edgecot, a little hamlet near Banbury, where we  took post on a hill, the rebels being opposite to us. It must be owned,\"  Sir Henry went on, \"that things here did not promise well. There were  dissensions between Prince Rupert, who commanded the cavalry, and Lord  Lindsey, the general in chief, who is able and of great courage, but  hot-headed and fiery. In the morning it was determined to engage, as  Essex's forces had not all come up, and the king's troops were at least  as numerous as those of the enemy. We saw little of the fighting, for at  the commencement of the battle we got word to charge upon the enemy's  left. We made but short work of them, and drove them headlong from the  field, chasing them in great disorder for three miles, and taking much  plunder in Kineton among the Parliament baggage-wagons. Thinking that  the fight was over, we then prepared to ride back. When we came to the  field we found that all was changed. The main body of the Roundheads had  pressed hotly upon ours and had driven them back. Lord Lindsey himself,  who had gone into the battle at the head of the pikemen carrying a pike  himself like a common soldier, had been mortally wounded and taken  prisoner, and grievous slaughter had been inflicted. The king's standard  itself had been taken, but this had been happily recovered, for two  Royalist officers, putting on orange scarfs, rode into the middle of the  Roundheads, and pretending that they were sent by Essex, demanded the  flag from his secretary, to whom it had been intrusted. The scrivener  gave it up, and the officers, seizing it, rode through the enemy and  recovered their ranks. There was much confusion and no little angry  discussion in the camp that night, the footmen accusing the horsemen of  having deserted them, and the horsemen grumbling at the foot, because  they had not done their work as well as themselves. In the morning the  two armies still faced each other, neither being willing to budge a  foot, although neither cared to renew the battle. The rest of the  Parliamentary forces had arrived, and they might have struck us a heavy  blow had they been minded, for there was much discouragement in our  ranks. Lord Essex, however, after waiting a day and burying his dead,  drew off from the field, and we, remaining there, were able to claim the  victory, which, however, my son, was one of a kind which was scarce  worth winning. It was a sad sight to see so many men stretched stark and  dead, and these killed, not in fighting with a foreign foe, but with  other Englishmen. It made us all mightily sad, and if at that moment  Lord Essex had had full power from the Parliament to treat, methinks  that the quarrel could have been settled, all being mightily sick of  such kind of fighting.\"    \"What is going to be done now, father?\" Harry asked.    \"We are going to move forward toward London. Essex is moving parallel  with us, and will try to get there first. From what we hear from our  friends in the city, there are great numbers of moderate men will be  glad to see the king back, and to agree to make an end of this direful  business. The zealots and preachers will of course oppose them. But when  we arrive, we trust that our countenance will enable our friends to make  a good front, and to overcome the opposition of the Puritans. We expect  that in a few days we shall meet with offers to treat. But whether or  no, I hope that the king will soon be lodged again in his palace at  Whitehall.\"    \"And do you think that there will be any fighting, sir?\"    \"I think not. I sincerely hope not,\" the colonel said.    \"Then if you think that there will only be a peaceable entry, will you  not let me ride with you? It will be a brave sight to see the king enter  London again; one to tell of all one's life.\"    The colonel made no reply for a minute or two.    \"Well, Harry, I will not say you nay,\" he said at length. \"Scenes of  broils and civil war are not for lads of your age. But, as you say, it  would be a thing to talk of to old age how you rode after the king when  he entered London in state. But mind, if there be fighting, you must  rein back and keep out of it.\"    Harry was overjoyed with the permission, for in truth time had hung  heavily on his hands since the colonel had ridden away. His  companionship with Herbert had ceased, for although the lads pressed  hands warmly when they met in Abingdon, both felt that while any day  might bring news of the triumph of one party or the other, it was  impossible that they could hold any warm intercourse with each other.  The school was closed, for the boys of course took sides, and so much  ill-will was caused that it was felt best to put a stop to it by closing  the doors. Harry therefore had been left entirely upon his own  resources, and although he had ridden about among the tenants and, so  far as he could, supplied his father's place, the time often hung heavy  on his hands, especially during the long hours of the evening. After  thanking his father for his kindness, he rushed wildly off to order his  horse to be prepared for him to accompany the troop, to re-burnish the  arms which he had already chosen as fitting him from the armory, and to  make what few preparations were necessary for the journey.    It was some days, however, before any move was made. The king was  occupied in raising money, being sorely crippled by want of funds, as  well as of arms and munitions of war. At the beginning of November the  advance was made, Sir Henry with his troop joining Prince Rupert, and  advancing through Reading without opposition as far as Maidenhead, where  he fixed his quarters. Two days later he learned that Essex had arrived  with his army in London. On the 11th King Charles was at Colnbrook. Here  he received a deputation from the Houses of Parliament, who proposed  that the king should pause in his advance until committees of both  Houses should attend him with propositions \"for the removal of these  bloody distempers and distractions.\" The king received the deputation  favorably, and said that he would stop at Windsor, and there receive the  propositions which might be sent him.    Unfortunately, however, the hopes which were now entertained that peace  would be restored, were dashed to the ground by an action which was  ascribed by the Royalists to the hotheadedness of Prince Rupert, but  which the king's enemies affirmed was due to the duplicity of his  majesty himself. On this point there is no evidence. But it is certain  that the advance made after this deputation had been received rendered  all further negotiation impossible, as it inspired the Commons with the  greatest distrust, and enabled the violent portion always to feign a  doubt of the king's word, and great fears as to the keeping of any terms  which might be made, and so to act upon the timid and wavering. The very  day after the deputation had left, bearing the news to London of the  king's readiness to treat, and inspiring all there with hope of peace,  Prince Rupert, taking advantage of a very thick mist, marched his  cavalry to within half a mile of the town of Brentford before his  advance was discovered, designing to surprise the train of artillery at  Hammersmith and to push on and seize the Commons and the city.    The design might have been successful, for the exploits of Rupert's  horse at the battle of Edgehill had struck terror into the minds of the  enemy. In the town of Brentford, however, were lodged a regiment of  foot, under Hollis, and these prepared manfully to resist. Very  valiantly the prince, followed by his horse, charged into the streets of  Brentford, where the houses were barricaded by the foot soldiers, who  shot boldly against them. Many were killed, and for three hours the  contest was resolutely maintained. The streets had been barricaded, and  Prince Rupert's men fought at great disadvantage. At length, as evening  approached, and the main body of the Cavaliers came up, the Parliament  men gave way, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11568"],[0,"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction. Volume 20, No. 562, (#6)"],[1,"in, the profusion of his  tables, in every unmanly indulgence which an empty vanity can covet,  and a full purse procure. Such a man, when he looks from the window of  his superb mansion, and sees the people pass, cannot endure the idea,  that they are of as much consequence as himself in the eye of the law;  and that he dares not insult or oppress the unfortunate being who  rakes his kennel or sweeps his chimney.\"           *       *       *       *       *      FALL OF ROBESPIERRE.      It is well known, that during the revolutionary troubles of France,  not only all the churches were closed, but the Catholic and Protestant  worship entirely forbidden; and, after the constitution of 1795, it  was at the hazard of one's life that either the mass was heard, or  any religious duty performed. It is evident that Robespierre, who  unquestionably had a design which is now generally understood, was  desirous, on the day of the fete of the Supreme Being, to bring back  public opinion to the worship of the Deity. Eight months before,  we had seen the Bishop of Paris, accompanied by his clergy, appear  voluntarily at the bar of the Convention, to abjure the Christian  faith and the Catholic religion. But it is not as generally known,  that at that period Robespierre was not omnipotent, and could not  carry his desires into effect. Numerous factions then disputed with  him the supreme authority. It was not till the end of 1793, and the  beginning of 1794, that his power was so completely established that  he could venture to act up to his intentions.    Robespierre was then desirous to establish the worship of the Supreme  Being, and the belief of the immortality of the soul. He felt that  irreligion is the soul of anarchy, and it was not anarchy but  despotism which he desired; and yet the very day after that  magnificent fete in honour of the Supreme Being, a man of the highest  celebrity in science, and as distinguished for virtue and probity as  philosophic genius, Lavoisier, was led out to the scaffold. On the day  following that, Madame Elizabeth, that Princess whom the executioners  could not guillotine, till they had turned aside their eyes from the  sight of her angelic visage, stained the same axe with her blood!--And  a month after, Robespierre, who wished to restore order for his own  purposes--who wished to still the bloody waves which for years had  inundated the state, felt that all his efforts would be in vain if  the masses who supported his power were not restrained and directed,  because without order nothing but ravages and destruction can prevail.  To ensure the government of the masses, it was indispensable that  morality, religion, and belief should be established--and, to affect  the multitude, that religion should be clothed in external forms. \"My  friend,\" said Voltaire, to the atheist Damilaville, \"after you have  supped on well-dressed partridges, drunk your sparkling champaigne,  and slept on cushions of down in the arms of your mistress, I have  no fear of you, though you do not believe in God.---But if you are  perishing of hunger, and I meet you in the corner of a wood, I would  rather dispense with your company.\" But when Robespierre wished to  bring back to something like discipline the crew of the vessel which  was fast driving on the breakers, he found the thing was not so easy  as he imagined. To destroy is easy--to rebuild is the difficulty. He  was omnipotent to do evil; but the day that he gave the first sign  of a disposition to return to order, the hands which he himself  had stained with blood, marked his forehead with the fatal sign of  destruction.    --_Memoirs of the Duchess of Abrantes._           *       *       *       *       *      SOUNDS DURING THE NIGHT.      The great audibility of sounds during the night is a phenomenon of  considerable interest, and one which had been observed even by the  ancients. In crowded cities or in their vicinity, the effect was  generally ascribed to the rest of animated beings, while in localities  where such an explanation was inapplicable, it was supposed to arise  from a favourable direction of the prevailing wind. Baron Humboldt  was particularly struck with this phenomenon when he first heard the  rushing of the great cataracts of the Orinoco in the plain which  surrounds the mission of the Apures. These sounds he regarded as  three times louder during the night than during the day. Some authors  ascribed this fact to the cessation of the humming of insects, the  singing of birds, and the action of the wind on the leaves of the  trees, but M. Humboldt justly maintains that this cannot be the cause  of it on the Orinoco, where the buzz of insects is much louder in the  night than in the day, and where the breeze never rises till after  sunset. Hence he was led to ascribe the phenomenon to the perfect  transparency and uniform density of the air, which can exist only at  night after the heat of the ground has been uniformly diffused through  the atmosphere. When the rays of the sun have been beating on the  ground during the day, currents of hot air of different temperatures,  and consequently of different densities, are constantly ascending from  the ground and mixing with the cold air above. The air thus ceases  to be a homogeneous medium, and every person must have observed the  effects of it upon objects seen through it which are very indistinctly  visible, and have a tremulous motion, as if they were \"dancing in  the air.\" The very same effect is perceived when we look at objects  through spirits and water that are not perfectly mixed, or when we  view distant objects over a red hot poker or over a flame. In all  these cases the light suffers refraction in passing from a medium of  one density into a medium of a different density, and the refracted  rays are constantly changing their direction as the different currents  rise in succession. Analogous effects are produced when sound passes  through a mixed medium, whether it consists of two different mediums  or of one medium where portions of it have different densities. As  sound moves with different velocities through media of different  densities, the wave which produces the sound will be partly reflected  in passing from one medium to the other, and the direction of the  transmitted wave changed; and hence in passing through such media  different portions of the wave will reach the ear at different times,  and thus destroy the sharpness and distinctness of the sound. This  may be proved by many striking facts. If we put a bell in a receiver  containing a mixture of hydrogen gas and atmospheric air, the sound of  the bell can scarcely be heard. During a shower of rain or of snow,  noises are greatly deadened, and when sound is transmitted along an  iron wire or an iron pipe of sufficient length, we actually hear two  sounds, one transmitted more rapidly through the solid, and the other  more slowly through the air. The same property is well illustrated by  an elegant and easily repeated experiment of Chladni's. When sparkling  champagne is poured into a tall glass till it is half full, the glass  loses its power of ringing by a stroke upon its edge, and emits only  a disagreeable and a puffy sound. This effect will continue while the  wine is filled with bubbles of air, or as long as the effervescence  lasts; but when the effervescence begins to subside, the sound becomes  clearer and clearer, and the glass rings as usual when the air-bubbles  have vanished. If we reproduce the effervescence by stirring the  champagne with a piece of bread the glass will again cease to ring.  The same experiment will succeed with other effervescing fluids.--_Sir  David Brewster_.           *       *       *       *       *    No man is so insignificant as to be sure his example can do no hurt.    --_Lord Clarendon._           *       *       *       *       *          THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.           *       *       *       *       *      PADDY FOOSHANE'S FRICASSEE.      Paddy Fooshane kept a shebeen house at Barleymount Cross, in which he  sold whisky--from which his Majesty did not derive any large portion  of his revenues--ale, and provisions. One evening a number of friends,  returning from a funeral---all neighbours too--stopt at his house,  \"because they were in grief,\" to drink a drop. There was Andy Agar, a  stout, rattling fellow, the natural son of a gentleman residing near  there; Jack Shea, who was afterwards transported for running away with  Biddy Lawlor; Tim Cournane, who, by reason of being on his keeping,  was privileged to carry a gun; Owen Connor, a march-of-intellect  man, who wished to enlighten proctors by making them swallow their  processes; and a number of other \"good boys.\" The night began to \"rain  cats and dogs,\" and there was no stirring out; so the cards were  called for, a roaring fire was made down, and the whisky and ale began  to flow. After due observation, and several experiments, a space large  enough for the big table, and free from the drop down, was discovered.  Here six persons, including Andy, Jack, Tim--with his gun between his  legs--and Owen, sat to play for a pig's head, of which the living  owner, in the parlour below, testified, by frequent grunts, his  displeasure at this unceremonious disposal of his property.    Card-playing is very thirsty, and the boys were anxious to keep out  the wet; so that long before the pig's head was decided, a messenger  had been dispatched several times to Killarney, a distance of four  English miles, for a pint of whisky each time. The ale also went  merrily round, until most of the men were quite stupid, their faces  swoln, and their eyes red and heavy. The contest at length was  decided; but a quarrel about the skill of the respective parties  succeeded, and threatened broken heads at one time.
