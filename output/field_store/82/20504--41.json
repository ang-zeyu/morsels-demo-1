And Abram believed it and gave faith to our Lord's words, and  it was reputed to him to justice. And our Lord said to him, I am the  Lord that led thee out of the land of Ur of the Chaldees for to give to  thee this land into thy possession. And Abram said: Lord, how shall I  know that I shall possess it? A voice said to Abram: Thy seed shall be  exiled into Egypt by the space of four hundred years, and shall be  there in servitude, and after, I shall bring them hither again in the  fourth generation. Thou shalt abide here unto thy good age, and shalt be  buried here, and go with thy fathers in peace. Sara was yet without  child, and she had a handmaid named Hagar, an Egyptian, and she on a day  said to Abram her husband: Thou seest I may bear no child, wherefore I  would thou took Hagar my maid, that thou might get a child which I might  keep and hold for mine. And ten year after that Abram had dwelled in  that land, he took Hagar, and anon she despised her mistress. Then Sara  said to Abram: Thou dost evil. My servant now hath me in despite, God  judge this between thee and me. To whom Abram answered: Thine handmaid  is in thine hands, chastise her as it pleaseth thee. After this Sara  chastised Hagar and put her to so great affliction that she went away;  and as she went an angel met with her in the wilderness by a well, and  said: Hagar, whence comest and whither goest thou? She answered: I flee  away from the face of my lady Sara. To whom the angel said, return again  and submit thee by humbleness unto thy lady, and I shall multiply thy  seed, and so much people shall come of it that it cannot be numbered for  multitude. And he said furthermore: Thou shalt bear a child and shalt  call him Ishmael. He shall be a fierce man, he shall be against all men,  and all men against him. Then Hagar returned home and served her lady,  and soon after this she was delivered of Ishmael. Abram was eighty-six  years old when Ishmael was born.    When Abram was ninety-nine years, our Lord appeared to him and said:  Abram, lo! I am the Lord Almighty, walk thou before me and be perfect,  and I shall keep covenant between me and thee and shall multiply thy  seed greatly. And Abram fell down lowting low to the earth and thanked  him. Then our Lord said I AM, and my covenant I shall keep to thee, thou  shalt be father of much people. Thou shalt no more be called Abram, but  Abraham, for I have ordained thee father of much people. I shall make  thee to increase most abundantly; kings and princes shall come of thee,  and shall stablish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed in thy  generations. I shall give to thee and to thy seed after thee the land of  thy pilgrimage, all the land of Canaan, into their possession and I  shall be their God. Yet said God to Abraham: And thou shalt keep thy  covenant to me, and thine heirs after thee in their generations, and  this shall be the covenant that ye shall keep and thine heirs after  thee. Every child masculine that shall be born shall be circumcised when  he is eight days old. And see that the men in your generation be  circumcised, begin at thyself and thy children. And all that dwell in  thy kindred, who of you that shall not be circumcised shall be cast and  put out for ever from my people, because he obeyeth not my statute and  ordinance. And thy wife Sara shall be called no more Sara but she shall  be called Sarah, and I shall bless her, and shall give to thee a son of  her, whom I shall bless also. I shall him increase into nations, and  kings of peoples shall come of him. Abraham fell down on his face  toward the earth and laughed in his heart, saying: May it be that a  woman of ninety years may bear a child? I beseech thee, Lord, that  Ishmael may live before thee. Our Lord said to Abraham, Sarah shall  bring forth a son whom thou shalt name Isaac, and I shall keep my  covenant to him for evermore, and to his heirs after him. And I have  heard thy request for Ishmael also. I shall bless him and increase, and  shall multiply his seed into much people, twelve dukes shall come of  him. I shall keep my covenant to Isaac, whom Sarah shall bring forth the  next year.    After this on a time, as Abraham sat beside his house in the vale of  Mamre in the heat of the day, and as he lift up his eyes, he saw three  young men coming to him, and anon as he saw these three standing by him  he ran to them and worshipped one alone; he saw three and worshipped but  one. That betokeneth the Trinity, and prayed them to be harboured with  him, and took water and washed their feet: and prayed them to tarry  under the tree, and he would bring bread to them for to comfort them.  And they bade him do as he had said, he went and bade Sarah to make  three ashy cakes and sent his child for a tender fat calf, which was  sodden and boiled. And he served them with butter and milk, and the  calf, and set it tofore them. He stood by them, and when they had eaten  they demanded him: Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said: Yonder in the  tabernacle. And he said, I shall go and come again, and Sarah thy wife  shall have a child. And she stood behind the door and heard it and  laughed, and said softly to herself: How may it be that I should bear a  child? She thought it impossible. Then said our Lord to Abraham: Why  laugheth Sarah thy wife, saying in scorn, Shall I bear a child? but as I  said to thee before, I shall return and come again, and she shall have a  child in that time. And he asked Sarah why she smiled in scorn, and she  said she smiled ne laughed not, and our Lord said, It is not so, for  thou laughedst.    When they had rested Abraham conveyed them on the way. And our Lord said  to Abraham: I have not hid from thee what I purpose to do. The cry of  Sodom and Gomorrah is multiplied and their sin is much grievous. I shall  descend and see if the sin be so great, the stench thereof cometh to  heaven, I shall take vengeance and destroy them. Then Abraham said: I  hope, Lord, thou wilt not destroy the just and righteous man with the  wicked sinner. I beseech thee, Lord, to spare them. Our Lord said: If  there be fifty good and righteous men among them, I shall spare them.  And Abraham said: Good Lord, if there be found forty, I pray thee to  spare them. Our Lord said: If there be forty, I shall spare them, and so  from forty to thirty and from thirty to twenty and from twenty to ten,  and our Lord said: If there be found ten good men among them, I shall  not destroy them. And then our Lord went from Abraham, and he returned  home again. That same eventide came two angels into Sodom, and Lot sat  at his gate, and when he saw them he went and worshipped them and  prayed them to come and rest in his house, and abide there and wash  their feet. And they said: Nay, we shall abide here in the street, and  Lot constrained them and brought them into his house and made a feast to  them. Then said the angels to Lot: If thou have here of thy kindred,  sons or daughters, all them that long to thee, lead out of this city, we  shall destroy this place, for the cry thereof is come to our Lord, which  hath sent us for to destroy them. Lot went unto his kinsmen and said:  Arise and take your children, and go out of this city, for our Lord  shall destroy it. And they supposed that he had raved or japed [jested].  And as soon as it was day the angels said to Lot: Arise, and take thy  wife and thy two daughters, and go out of this town lest ye perish with  them. Yet he dissimuling, they took him by the hand and his wife and two  daughters, because that God should spare them, and led them out of the  city. And there they said to him: Save thy soul and look not behind thee  lest thou perish also, but save thee in the mountain. Lot said to them:  I beseech thee, my Lord, forasmuch as thy servant hath found grace  before thee, and that thou hast showed thy mercy to me, and that  peradventure I might take harm on the hill, that I may go into the  little city hereby and may be saved there. He said to Lot: I have heard  thy prayers, and for thy sake I shall not subvert this town for which  thou hast prayed, hie thee and save thyself there, for I may do nothing  till thou be therein. Therefore that town is called Zoar. So Lot went  in to Zoar; and the sun arose, and our Lord rained from heaven upon  Sodom and Gomorrah sulphur and fire, and subverted the cities and all  the dwellers of the towns about that region, and all that was there  growing and burgeoning. Lot's wife turned her and looked toward the  cities, and anon she was turned into a statue or image of salt, which  abideth so unto this day. Abraham arose in the morning early, and looked  toward the cities, and saw the smoke ascending from the places, like as  it had been the light of a furnace. What time our Lord subverted these  cities he remembered Abraham, and delivered Lot from the vengeance of  the cities in which he dwelled. Then Lot ascended from Zoar and dwelled  in the mountain, and his two daughters with him. He dreaded to abide any  longer in the town, but dwelled in a cave, he and his two daughters with  him.    Abraham departed from thence and went southward and dwelled between  Kadesh and Shur, and went a pilgrimage to Gerar. He said that his wife  was his sister. Abimelech the king of Gerar sent for her and took her.  God came to Abimelech in his sleep and said: Thou shalt be dead for the  woman that thou hast taken, she hath an husband. Abimelech said: Lord,  wilt thou slay a man ignorant and rightful? She said that she was his  sister, in the simpleness of my heart and cleanness of my hands I did  this. And God said to him: I know well that with a simple heart thou  didst it, and therefore I have kept thee from her, now yield the woman  to her husband, and he shall pray for thee, he is a prophet and thou  shalt live. And if thou deliver her not, thou shalt die, and all they  that be in thy house."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1039"],[0,"Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa (#6)"],[1,"which, as she believed, had been composed by  captive islanders languishing hopelessly among the Turks.    Grandfather could give particulars of the lives of his ancestors for  six generations of the family before him; and the only point of the  tradition I feel proud of is this: One of these poor hardy islanders  was renowned in the district for great wisdom and prudence; and it is  related that, when he was on his death-bed, he called all his children  around him and said, \"Now, in my lifetime, I have searched most  carefully through all the traditions I could find of our family, and  I never could discover that there was a dishonest man among our  forefathers. If, therefore, any of you or any of your children should  take to dishonest ways, it will not be because it runs in our blood: it  does not belong to you. I leave this precept with you: Be honest.\" If,  therefore, in the following pages I fall into any errors, I hope they  will be dealt with as honest mistakes, and not as indicating that I have  forgotten our ancient motto. This event took place at a time when the  Highlanders, according to Macaulay, were much like the Cape Caffres,  and any one, it was said, could escape punishment for cattle-stealing by  presenting a share of the plunder to his chieftain. Our ancestors were  Roman Catholics; they were made Protestants by the laird coming round  with a man having a yellow staff, which would seem to have attracted  more attention than his teaching, for the new religion went long  afterward, perhaps it does so still, by the name of \"the religion of the  yellow stick\".    Finding his farm in Ulva insufficient to support a numerous family, my  grandfather removed to Blantyre Works, a large cotton manufactory on  the beautiful Clyde, above Glasgow; and his sons, having had the best  education the Hebrides afforded, were gladly received as clerks by  the proprietors, Monteith and Co. He himself, highly esteemed for his  unflinching honesty, was employed in the conveyance of large sums of  money from Glasgow to the works, and in old age was, according to the  custom of that company, pensioned off, so as to spend his declining  years in ease and comfort.    Our uncles all entered his majesty's service during the last French  war, either as soldiers or sailors; but my father remained at home, and,  though too conscientious ever to become rich as a small tea-dealer, by  his kindliness of manner and winning ways he made the heart-strings  of his children twine around him as firmly as if he had possessed, and  could have bestowed upon them, every worldly advantage. He reared  his children in connection with the Kirk of Scotland--a religious  establishment which has been an incalculable blessing to that  country--but he afterward left it, and during the last twenty years of  his life held the office of deacon of an independent church in Hamilton,  and deserved my lasting gratitude and homage for presenting me, from  my infancy, with a continuously consistent pious example, such as that  ideal of which is so beautifully and truthfully portrayed in Burns's  \"Cottar's Saturday Night\". He died in February, 1856, in peaceful hope  of that mercy which we all expect through the death of our Lord and  Savior. I was at the time on my way below Zumbo, expecting no greater  pleasure in this country than sitting by our cottage fire and telling  him my travels. I revere his memory.    The earliest recollection of my mother recalls a picture so often seen  among the Scottish poor--that of the anxious housewife striving to  make both ends meet. At the age of ten I was put into the factory as a  \"piecer\", to aid by my earnings in lessening her anxiety. With a part of  my first week's wages I purchased Ruddiman's \"Rudiments of Latin\",  and pursued the study of that language for many years afterward, with  unabated ardor, at an evening school, which met between the hours of  eight and ten. The dictionary part of my labors was followed up till  twelve o'clock, or later, if my mother did not interfere by jumping up  and snatching the books out of my hands. I had to be back in the  factory by six in the morning, and continue my work, with intervals for  breakfast and dinner, till eight o'clock at night. I read in this way  many of the classical authors, and knew Virgil and Horace better at  sixteen than I do now. Our schoolmaster--happily still alive--was  supported in part by the company; he was attentive and kind, and so  moderate in his charges that all who wished for education might have  obtained it. Many availed themselves of the privilege; and some of my  schoolfellows now rank in positions far above what they appeared ever  likely to come to when in the village school. If such a system were  established in England, it would prove a never-ending blessing to the  poor.    In reading, every thing that I could lay my hands on was devoured except  novels. Scientific works and books of travels were my especial delight;  though my father, believing, with many of his time who ought to have  known better, that the former were inimical to religion, would have  preferred to have seen me poring over the \"Cloud of Witnesses\", or  Boston's \"Fourfold State\". Our difference of opinion reached the point  of open rebellion on my part, and his last application of the rod was  on my refusal to peruse Wilberforce's \"Practical Christianity\". This  dislike to dry doctrinal reading, and to religious reading of every  sort, continued for years afterward; but having lighted on those  admirable works of Dr. Thomas Dick, \"The Philosophy of Religion\" and  \"The Philosophy of a Future State\", it was gratifying to find my own  ideas, that religion and science are not hostile, but friendly to each  other, fully proved and enforced.    Great pains had been taken by my parents to instill the doctrines of  Christianity into my mind, and I had no difficulty in understanding the  theory of our free salvation by the atonement of our Savior, but it was  only about this time that I really began to feel the necessity and value  of a personal application of the provisions of that atonement to my own  case. The change was like what may be supposed would take place were it  possible to cure a case of \"color blindness\". The perfect freeness with  which the pardon of all our guilt is offered in God's book drew forth  feelings of affectionate love to Him who bought us with his blood, and  a sense of deep obligation to Him for his mercy has influenced, in some  small measure, my conduct ever since. But I shall not again refer to  the inner spiritual life which I believe then began, nor do I intend to  specify with any prominence the evangelistic labors to which the love of  Christ has since impelled me. This book will speak, not so much of what  has been done, as of what still remains to be performed, before the  Gospel can be said to be preached to all nations.    In the glow of love which Christianity inspires, I soon resolved to  devote my life to the alleviation of human misery. Turning this idea  over in my mind, I felt that to be a pioneer of Christianity in China  might lead to the material benefit of some portions of that immense  empire; and therefore set myself to obtain a medical education, in order  to be qualified for that enterprise.    In recognizing the plants pointed out in my first medical book, that  extraordinary old work on astrological medicine, Culpeper's \"Herbal\",  I had the guidance of a book on the plants of Lanarkshire, by Patrick.  Limited as my time was, I found opportunities to scour the whole  country-side, \"collecting simples\". Deep and anxious were my studies on  the still deeper and more perplexing profundities of astrology, and I  believe I got as far into that abyss of phantasies as my author said he  dared to lead me. It seemed perilous ground to tread on farther, for the  dark hint seemed to my youthful mind to loom toward \"selling soul and  body to the devil\", as the price of the unfathomable knowledge of the  stars. These excursions, often in company with brothers, one now in  Canada, and the other a clergyman in the United States, gratified my  intense love of nature; and though we generally returned so unmercifully  hungry and fatigued that the embryo parson shed tears, yet we  discovered, to us, so many new and interesting things, that he was  always as eager to join us next time as he was the last.    On one of these exploring tours we entered a limestone quarry--long  before geology was so popular as it is now. It is impossible to describe  the delight and wonder with which I began to collect the shells found  in the carboniferous limestone which crops out in High Blantyre and  Cambuslang. A quarry-man, seeing a little boy so engaged, looked with  that pitying eye which the benevolent assume when viewing the insane.  Addressing him with, \"How ever did these shells come into these rocks?\"  \"When God made the rocks, he made the shells in them,\" was the damping  reply. What a deal of trouble geologists might have saved themselves by  adopting the Turk-like philosophy of this Scotchman!    My reading while at work was carried on by placing the book on a portion  of the spinning-jenny, so that I could catch sentence after sentence as  I passed at my work; I thus kept up a pretty constant study undisturbed  by the roar of the machinery. To this part of my education I owe my  present power of completely abstracting the mind from surrounding  noises, so as to read and write with perfect comfort amid the play  of children or near the dancing and songs of savages. The toil of  cotton-spinning, to which I was promoted in my nineteenth year, was  excessively severe on a slim, loose-jointed lad, but it was well paid  for; and it enabled me to support myself while attending medical and  Greek classes in Glasgow in winter, as also the divinity lectures of Dr.  Wardlaw, by working with my hands in summer. I never received a farthing  of aid "]]]
