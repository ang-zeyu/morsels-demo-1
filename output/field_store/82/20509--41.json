Thus we made the brig, and, the boats being ready, I scrambled after the  bo'sun into his, and we put straightway into the creek, all of us,  pulling with so much haste as our loads would allow. As we went I looked  back at the brig, and it seemed to me that a multitude of things hung  over the bank above her, and there seemed a flicker of things moving  hither and thither aboard of her. And then we were in the great creek up  which we had come, and so, in a little, it was night.    All that night we rowed, keeping very strictly to the center of the big  creek, and all about us bellowed the vast growling, being more fearsome  than ever I had heard it, until it seemed to me that we had waked all  that land of terror to a knowledge of our presence. But, when the morning  came, so good a speed had we made, what with our fear, and the current  being with us, that we were nigh upon the open sea; whereat each one of  us raised a shout, feeling like freed prisoners.    And so, full of thankfulness to the Almighty, we rowed outward to the  sea.          V    The Great Storm      Now, as I have said, we came at last in safety to the open sea, and  so for a time had some degree of peace; though it was long ere we  threw off all of the terror which the Land of Lonesomeness had cast  over our hearts.    And one more matter there is regarding that land, which my memory  recalls. It will be remembered that George found certain wrappers upon  which there was writing. Now, in the haste of our leaving, he had given  no thought to take them with him; yet a portion of one he found within  the side pocket of his jacket, and it ran somewhat thus:--    \"But I hear my lover's voice wailing in the night, and I go to find him;  for my loneliness is not to be borne. May God have mercy upon me!\"    And that was all.    For a day and a night we stood out from the land towards the North,  having a steady breeze to which we set our lug sails, and so made very  good way, the sea being quiet, though with a slow, lumbering swell from  the Southward.    It was on the morning of the second day of our escape that we met with  the beginnings of our adventure into the Silent Sea, the which I am about  to make as clear as I am able.    The night had been quiet, and the breeze steady until near on to the  dawn, when the wind slacked away to nothing, and we lay there waiting,  perchance the sun should bring the breeze with it. And this it did; but  no such wind as we did desire; for when the morning came upon us, we  discovered all that part of the sky to be full of a fiery redness, which  presently spread away down to the South, so that an entire quarter of the  heavens was, as it seemed to us, a mighty arc of blood-colored fire.    Now, at the sight of these omens, the bo'sun gave orders to prepare the  boats for the storm which we had reason to expect, looking for it in the  South, for it was from that direction that the swell came rolling upon  us. With this intent, we roused out so much heavy canvas as the boats  contained, for we had gotten a bolt and a half from the hulk in the  creek; also the boat covers which we could lash down to the brass studs  under the gunnels of the boats. Then, in each boat, we mounted the  whaleback--which had been stowed along the tops of the thwarts--also its  supports, lashing the same to the thwarts below the knees. Then we laid  two lengths of the stout canvas the full length of the boat over the  whaleback, overlapping and nailing them to the same, so that they sloped  away down over the gunnels upon each side as though they had formed a  roof to us. Here, whilst some stretched the canvas, nailing its lower  edges to the gunnels, others were employed in lashing together the oars  and the mast, and to this bundle they secured a considerable length of  new three-and-a-half-inch hemp rope, which we had brought away from the  hulk along with the canvas. This rope was then passed over the bows and  in through the painter ring, and thence to the forrard thwarts, where it  was made fast, and we gave attention to parcel it with odd strips of  canvas against danger of chafe. And the same was done in both of the  boats, for we could not put our trust in the painters, besides which they  had not sufficient length to secure safe and easy riding.    Now by this time we had the canvas nailed down to the gunnels around our  boat, after which we spread the boat-cover over it, lacing it down to the  brass studs beneath the gunnel. And so we had all the boat covered in,  save a place in the stern where a man might stand to wield the steering  oar, for the boats were double bowed. And in each boat we made the same  preparation, lashing all movable articles, and preparing to meet so great  a storm as might well fill the heart with terror; for the sky cried out  to us that it would be no light wind, and further, the great swell from  the South grew more huge with every hour that passed; though as yet it  was without virulence, being slow and oily and black against the redness  of the sky.    Presently we were ready, and had cast over the bundle of oars and the  mast, which was to serve as our sea anchor, and so we lay waiting. It was  at this time that the bo'sun called over to Josh certain advice with  regard to that which lay before us. And after that the two of them  sculled the boats a little apart; for there might be a danger of their  being dashed together by the first violence of the storm.    And so came a time of waiting, with Josh and the bo'sun each of them at  the steering oars, and the rest of us stowed away under the coverings.  From where I crouched near the bo'sun, I had sight of Josh away upon our  port side: he was standing up black as a shape of night against the  mighty redness, when the boat came to the foamless crowns of the swells,  and then gone from sight in the hollows between.    Now midday had come and gone, and we had made shift to eat so good a  meal as our appetites would allow; for we had no knowledge how long it  might be ere we should have chance of another, if, indeed, we had ever  need to think more of such. And then, in the middle part of the  afternoon, we heard the first cryings of the storm--a far-distant  moaning, rising and falling most solemnly.    Presently, all the Southern part of the horizon so high up, maybe, as  some seven to ten degrees, was blotted out by a great black wall of  cloud, over which the red glare came down upon the great swells as though  from the light of some vast and unseen fire. It was about this time, I  observed that the sun had the appearance of a great full moon, being pale  and clearly defined, and seeming to have no warmth nor brilliancy; and  this, as may be imagined, seemed most strange to us, the more so because  of the redness in the South and East.    And all this while the swells increased most prodigiously; though without  making broken water: yet they informed us that we had done well to take  so much precaution; for surely they were raised by a very great storm. A  little before evening, the moaning came again, and then a space of  silence; after which there rose a very sudden bellowing, as of wild  beasts, and then once more the silence.    About this time, the bo'sun making no objection, I raised my head above  the cover until I was in a standing position; for, until now, I had taken  no more than occasional peeps; and I was very glad of the chance to  stretch my limbs; for I had grown mightily cramped. Having stirred the  sluggishness of my blood, I sat me down again; but in such position that  I could see every part of the horizon without difficulty. Ahead of us,  that is to the South, I saw now that the great wall of cloud had risen  some further degrees, and there was something less of the redness;  though, indeed, what there was left of it was sufficiently terrifying;  for it appeared to crest the black cloud like red foam, seeming, it might  be, as though a mighty sea made ready to break over the world.    Towards the West, the sun was sinking behind a curious red-tinted haze,  which gave it the appearance of a dull red disk. To the North, seeming  very high in the sky, were some flecks of cloud lying motionless, and of  a very pretty rose color. And here I may remark that all the sea to the  North of us appeared as a very ocean of dull red fire; though, as might  be expected, the swells, coming up from the South, against the light were  so many exceeding great hills of blackness.    It was just after I had made these observations that we heard again the  distant roaring of the storm, and I know not how to convey the exceeding  terror of that sound. It was as though some mighty beast growled far down  towards the South; and it seemed to make very clear to me that we were  but two small craft in a very lonesome place. Then, even while the  roaring lasted, I saw a sudden light flare up, as it were from the edge  of the Southern horizon. It had somewhat the appearance of lightning; yet  vanished not immediately, as is the wont of lightning; and more, it had  not been my experience to witness such spring up from out of the sea,  but, rather, down from the heavens. Yet I have little doubt but that it  was a form of lightning; for it came many times after this, so that I had  chance to observe it minutely. And frequently, as I watched, the storm  would shout at us in a most fearsome manner.    Then, when the sun was low upon the horizon, there came to our ears a  very shrill, screaming noise, most penetrating and distressing, and,  immediately afterwards the bo'sun shouted out something in a hoarse  voice, and commenced to sway furiously upon the steering oar. I saw his  stare fixed upon a point a little on our larboard bow, and perceived that  in that direction the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10554"],[0,"Right Ho, Jeeves (#6)"],[1,"that would rattle you. Greedy young pig.\"    \"Greedy young pigs have nothing to do with it,\" I said with a touch of  hauteur. \"One is not a greedy young pig because one appreciates the  cooking of a genius.\"    \"Well, I will say I like it myself,\" conceded the relative. \"But not  another bite of it do you get, if you refuse to do this simple, easy,  pleasant job. No, not so much as another sniff. So put that in your  twelve-inch cigarette-holder and smoke it.\"    I began to feel like some wild thing caught in a snare.    \"But why do you want me? I mean, what am I? Ask yourself that.\"    \"I often have.\"    \"I mean to say, I'm not the type. You have to have some terrific nib to  give away prizes. I seem to remember, when I was at school, it was  generally a prime minister or somebody.\"    \"Ah, but that was at Eton. At Market Snodsbury we aren't nearly so  choosy. Anybody in spats impresses us.\"    \"Why don't you get Uncle Tom?\"    \"Uncle Tom!\"    \"Well, why not? He's got spats.\"    \"Bertie,\" she said, \"I will tell you why not Uncle Tom. You remember me  losing all that money at baccarat at Cannes? Well, very shortly I shall  have to sidle up to Tom and break the news to him. If, right after that,  I ask him to put on lavender gloves and a topper and distribute the  prizes at Market Snodsbury Grammar School, there will be a divorce in the  family. He would pin a note to the pincushion and be off like a rabbit.  No, my lad, you're for it, so you may as well make the best of it.\"    \"But, Aunt Dahlia, listen to reason. I assure you, you've got hold of the  wrong man. I'm hopeless at a game like that. Ask Jeeves about the time I  got lugged in to address a girls' school. I made the most colossal ass of  myself.\"    \"And I confidently anticipate that you will make an equally colossal ass  of yourself on the thirty-first of this month. That's why I want you. The  way I look at it is that, as the thing is bound to be a frost, anyway,  one may as well get a hearty laugh out of it. I shall enjoy seeing you  distribute those prizes, Bertie. Well, I won't keep you, as, no doubt,  you want to do your Swedish exercises. I shall expect you in a day or  two.\"    And with these heartless words she beetled off, leaving me a prey to the  gloomiest emotions. What with the natural reaction after Pongo's party  and this stunning blow, it is not too much to say that the soul was  seared.    And I was still writhing in the depths, when the door opened and Jeeves  appeared.    \"Mr. Fink-Nottle to see you, sir,\" he announced.        -5-      I gave him one of my looks.    \"Jeeves,\" I said, \"I had scarcely expected this of you. You are aware  that I was up to an advanced hour last night. You know that I have barely  had my tea. You cannot be ignorant of the effect of that hearty voice of  Aunt Dahlia's on a man with a headache. And yet you come bringing me  Fink-Nottles. Is this a time for Fink or any other kind of Nottle?\"    \"But did you not give me to understand, sir, that you wished to see Mr.  Fink-Nottle to advise him on his affairs?\"    This, I admit, opened up a new line of thought. In the stress of my  emotions, I had clean forgotten about having taken Gussie's interests in  hand. It altered things. One can't give the raspberry to a client. I  mean, you didn't find Sherlock Holmes refusing to see clients just  because he had been out late the night before at Doctor Watson's birthday  party. I could have wished that the man had selected some more suitable  hour for approaching me, but as he appeared to be a sort of human lark,  leaving his watery nest at daybreak, I supposed I had better give him an  audience.    \"True,\" I said. \"All right. Bung him in.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    \"But before doing so, bring me one of those pick-me-ups of yours.\"    \"Very good, sir.\"    And presently he returned with the vital essence.    I have had occasion, I fancy, to speak before now of these pick-me-ups of  Jeeves's and their effect on a fellow who is hanging to life by a thread  on the morning after. What they consist of, I couldn't tell you. He says  some kind of sauce, the yolk of a raw egg and a dash of red pepper, but  nothing will convince me that the thing doesn't go much deeper than that.  Be that as it may, however, the results of swallowing one are amazing.    For perhaps the split part of a second nothing happens. It is as though  all Nature waited breathless. Then, suddenly, it is as if the Last Trump  had sounded and Judgment Day set in with unusual severity.    Bonfires burst out in all in parts of the frame. The abdomen becomes heavily  charged with molten lava. A great wind seems to blow through the world,  and the subject is aware of something resembling a steam hammer striking  the back of the head. During this phase, the ears ring loudly, the  eyeballs rotate and there is a tingling about the brow.    And then, just as you are feeling that you ought to ring up your lawyer  and see that your affairs are in order before it is too late, the whole  situation seems to clarify. The wind drops. The ears cease to ring. Birds  twitter. Brass bands start playing. The sun comes up over the horizon  with a jerk.    And a moment later all you are conscious of is a great peace.    As I drained the glass now, new life seemed to burgeon within me. I  remember Jeeves, who, however much he may go off the rails at times in  the matter of dress clothes and in his advice to those in love, has  always had a neat turn of phrase, once speaking of someone rising on  stepping-stones of his dead self to higher things. It was that way with  me now. I felt that the Bertram Wooster who lay propped up against the  pillows had become a better, stronger, finer Bertram.    \"Thank you, Jeeves,\" I said.    \"Not at all, sir.\"    \"That touched the exact spot. I am now able to cope with life's  problems.\"    \"I am gratified to hear it, sir.\"    \"What madness not to have had one of those before tackling Aunt Dahlia!  However, too late to worry about that now. Tell me of Gussie. How did he  make out at the fancy-dress ball?\"    \"He did not arrive at the fancy-dress ball, sir.\"    I looked at him a bit austerely.    \"Jeeves,\" I said, \"I admit that after that pick-me-up of yours I feel  better, but don't try me too high. Don't stand by my sick bed talking  absolute rot. We shot Gussie into a cab and he started forth, headed for  wherever this fancy-dress ball was. He must have arrived.\"    \"No, sir. As I gather from Mr. Fink-Nottle, he entered the cab convinced  in his mind that the entertainment to which he had been invited was to be  held at No. 17, Suffolk Square, whereas the actual rendezvous was No. 71,  Norfolk Terrace. These aberrations of memory are not uncommon with those  who, like Mr. Fink-Nottle, belong essentially to what one might call the  dreamer-type.\"    \"One might also call it the fatheaded type.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Well?\"    \"On reaching No. 17, Suffolk Square, Mr. Fink-Nottle endeavoured to  produce money to pay the fare.\"    \"What stopped him?\"    \"The fact that he had no money, sir. He discovered that he had left it,  together with his ticket of invitation, on the mantelpiece of his  bedchamber in the house of his uncle, where he was residing. Bidding the  cabman to wait, accordingly, he rang the door-bell, and when the butler  appeared, requested him to pay the cab, adding that it was all right, as  he was one of the guests invited to the dance. The butler then disclaimed  all knowledge of a dance on the premises.\"    \"And declined to unbelt?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Upon which----\"    \"Mr. Fink-Nottle directed the cabman to drive him back to his uncle's  residence.\"    \"Well, why wasn't that the happy ending? All he had to do was go in,  collect cash and ticket, and there he would have been, on velvet.\"    \"I should have mentioned, sir, that Mr. Fink-Nottle had also left his  latchkey on the mantelpiece of his bedchamber.\"    \"He could have rung the bell.\"    \"He did ring the bell, sir, for some fifteen minutes. At the expiration  of that period he recalled that he had given permission to the  caretaker--the house was officially closed and all the staff on  holiday--to visit his sailor son at Portsmouth.\"    \"Golly, Jeeves!\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"These dreamer types do live, don't they?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"What happened then?\"    \"Mr. Fink-Nottle appears to have realized at this point that his position  as regards the cabman had become equivocal. The figures on the clock had  already reached a substantial sum, and he was not in a position to meet  his obligations.\"    \"He could have explained.\"    \"You cannot explain to cabmen, sir. On endeavouring to do so, he found  the fellow sceptical of his bona fides.\"    \"I should have legged it.\"    \"That is the policy which appears to have commended itself to Mr.  Fink-Nottle. He darted rapidly away, and the cabman, endeavouring to detain  him, snatched at his overcoat. Mr. Fink-Nottle contrived to extricate  himself from the coat, and it would seem that his appearance in the  masquerade costume beneath it came as something of a shock to the cabman.  Mr. Fink-Nottle informs me that he heard a species of whistling gasp,  and, looking round, observed the man crouching against the railings with  his hands over his face. Mr. Fink-Nottle thinks he was praying. No doubt  an uneducated, superstitious fellow, sir. Possibly a drinker.\"    \"Well, if he hadn't been one before, I'll bet he started being one  shortly afterwards. I expect he could scarcely wait for the pubs to  open.\"    \"Very possibly, in the circumstances he might have found a restorative  agreeable, sir.\"    \"And so, in the circumstances, might Gussie too, I should think. What on  earth did he do after that? London late at night--or even in the daytime,  for that matter--is no place for a man in scarlet tights.\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"He invites comment.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"I can see the poor old bird ducking down side-streets, skulking in  alley-wa"]]]
