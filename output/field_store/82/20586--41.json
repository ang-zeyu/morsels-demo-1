The king's party demanded of Parliament registration of  this edict.  Parliament confined itself to writing to the king, agreeing  that the University had no right to meddle in affairs of government, but  adding that there were strong reasons, of which it would give an account  whenever the king should please to order, why it, the Parliament, should  refuse registration of the edict.  It does not appear that the king ever  asked for such account, or that his wrath against the University was more  obstinately manifested.  The Concordat was registered, and Francis I.,  after having achieved an official victory over the magistrates, had small  stomach for pursuing extreme measures against the men of letters.    We have seen that in the course of the fifteenth century, there were made  in France two able and patriotic attempts; the Pragmatic Sanction, in  1458, under Charles VII., and the States General of 1484, under Charles  VIII.  We do not care to discuss here all the dispositions of those acts;  some of them were, indeed, questionable; but they both of them, one in  respect of the church and the other of the state, aimed at causing France  to make a great stride towards a national, free and legalized regimen, to  which French feudal society had never known how or been willing to adjust  itself.  These two attempts failed.  It would be unjust to lay the blame  on the contemporary governments.  Charles VII. was in earnest about the  Pragmatic Sanction which he submitted to the deliberations and votes of a  national council; and Louis XI., after having for a while given it up to  the pope, retraced his steps and left it in force.  As to the States  General of 1484, neither the regent, Anne de Beaujeu, nor Charles VIII.,  offered the slightest hinderance to their deliberations and their votes;  and if Louis XII. did not convoke the States afresh, he constantly strove  in the government of his kingdom to render them homage and give them  satisfaction.  We may feel convinced that, considering the social and  intellectual condition of France at this time, these two patriotic  attempts were premature; but a good policy, being premature, is not on  that account alone condemned to failure; what it wants is time to get  itself comprehended, appreciated, and practised gradually and  consistently.  If the successors of Louis XII.  had acted in the same  spirit and with the same view as their predecessor, France would probably  have made progress in this salutary path.  But exactly the contrary took  place.  Instead of continuing a more and more free and legal regimen,  Francis I. and his chancellor, Duprat, loudly proclaimed and practised  the maxims of absolute power; in the church, the Pragmatic Sanction was  abolished; and in the state, Francis I., during a reign of thirty-two  years, did not once convoke the States General, and labored only to set  up the sovereign right of his own sole will.  The church was despoiled  of her electoral autonomy; and the magistracy, treated with haughty and  silly impertinence, was vanquished and humiliated in the exercise of its  right of remonstrance.  The Concordat of 1516 was not the only, but it  was the gravest pact of alliance concluded between the papacy and the  French kingship for the promotion mutually of absolute power.    Whilst this question formed the subject of disputes in France between the  great public authorities, there was springing up, outside of France,  between the great European powers another not more grave in regard to a  distant future, but more threatening in regard to the present peace of  nations.  King Ferdinand the Catholic had died on the 23d of January,  1516; and his grandson and successor, Archduke Charles, anxious to go and  take possession of the throne of Spain, had hastily concluded with  Francis I., on the 13th of August, 1516, at Noyon, a treaty intended to  settle differences between the two crowns as to the kingdoms of Naples  and Navarre.  The French and Spanish plenipotentiaries, Sires de Boisy  and de Chievres, were still holding meetings at Montpellier, trying to  come to an understanding about the execution of this treaty, when the  death of Emperor Maximilian at Wels, in Austria, on the 12th of January,  1519, occurred to add the vacant throne of a great power to the two  second-rate thrones already in dispute between two powerful princes.  Three claimants, Charles of Austria, who was the new King of Spain,  Francis I., and Henry VIII., King of England, aspired to this splendid  heritage.  In 1517, Maximilian himself, in one of his fits of temper and  impecuniosity, had offered to abdicate and give up the imperial dignity  to Henry VIII. for a good round sum; but the King of England's envoy, Dr.  Cuthbert Tunstall, a stanch and clearsighted servant, who had been sent  to Germany to deal with this singular proposal, opened his master's eyes  to its hollowness and falsehood, and Henry VIII. held himself aloof.  Francis I. remained the only rival of Charles of Austria; Maximilian  labored eagerly to pave the way for his grandson's success; and at his  death the struggle between the two claimants had already become so keen  that Francis I., on hearing the news, exclaimed, \"I will spend three  millions to be elected emperor, and I swear that, three years after the  election, I will be either at Constantinople or dead.\"    The Turks, who had been since 1453 settled at Constantinople, were the  terror of Christian Europe; and Germany especially had need of a puissant  and valiant defender against them.  Francis I. calculated that the  Christians of Germany and Hungary would see in him, the King of France  and the victor of Melegnano, their most imposing and most effectual  champion.    Having a superficial mind and being full of vain confidence, Francis I.  was mistaken about the forces and chances on his side, as well as about  the real and natural interests of France, and also his own.  There was no  call for him to compromise himself in this electoral struggle of kings,  and in a distant war against triumphant Islamry.  He miscalculated the  strong position and personal valor of the rival with whom he would have  to measure swords.  Charles of Austria was but nineteen, and Francis I.  was twenty-three, when they entered, as antagonists, into the arena of  European politics.  Charles had as yet gained no battle and won no  renown; while Francis I. was already a victorious king and a famous  knight.  But the young archduke's able governor, William de Croy, Lord of  Chievres, \"had early trained him,\" says M. Mignet, \"to the understanding  and management of his various interests; from the time that he was  fifteen, Charles presided every day at his council; there he himself read  out the contents of despatches which were delivered to him the moment  they arrived, were it even in the dead of night; his council had become  his school, and business served him for books.  .  .  .  Being naturally  endowed with superior parts, a penetrating intellect and rare firmness of  character, he schooled himself to look Fortune in the face without being  intoxicated by her smiles or troubled at her frowns, to be astonished by  nothing that happened, and to make up his mind in any danger.  He had  even now the will of an emperor and an overawing manner. 'His dignity and  loftiness of soul are such,' says a contemporary writer, 'that he seems  to hold the universe under his feet.'\"  Charles's position in Germany was  as strong as the man himself; he was a German, a duke of Austria, of the  imperial line, as natural a successor of his grandfather Maximilian at  Frankfort as of his grandfather Ferdinand at Madrid.  Such was the  adversary, with such advantages of nationality and of person, against  whom Francis I., without any political necessity, and for the sole  purpose of indulging an ambitious vision and his own kingly self-esteem,  was about to engage in a struggle which was to entail a heavy burden on  his whole life, and bring him not in triumph to Constantinople, but in  captivity to Madrid.    Before the death of Maximilian, and when neither party had done more than  foresee the struggle and get ready for it, Francis I. was for some time  able to hope for some success.  Seven German princes, three  ecclesiastical and four laic, the Archbishops of Mayence, Cologne, and  Troves, and the Duke of Saxony, the Margrave of Brandenburg, the Count  Palatine of the Rhine, and the King of Bohemia, had the sole power of  electing the emperor.  Four of them, the Archbishops of Troves and of  Cologne, the Count Palatine of the Rhine and the Margrave of Brandenburg,  had favorably received the overtures of Francis I., and had promised him  their suffrages.  His devoted servant, Robert de la Marck, Lord of  Fleuranges, had brought to him at Amboise a German gentleman from the  Palatinate, Franz von Sickingen, \"of very petty family, but a very gentle  companion,\" says Fleuranges, \"the most beautiful talker that I think I  ever saw in my life, and in so much that there was no gentleman in  Germany, prince or man of war, who would not have been glad to do him  pleasure.\"  Francis I. had received him with very chivalrous grace, and  had given him a pension of three thousand livres and handsome presents  for his comrades in adventure; and Sickingen was so charmed that he said  to Fleuranges on leaving Amboise, \"The king did not open his heart to me  on the subject of the empire; however, I know all about it, and I beg you  to tell him that I will do his service and keep the oath I gave him.\"  A more important personage than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11956"],[0,"A Popular History of France from the Earliest Times, Volume 6 (#6)"],[1,"Duchess of Burgundy, but more ambitious and more haughty.  Louis XIV. had several times conceived some misgiving of the _camarera  major's_ influence over his grandson; she had been disgraced, and then  recalled; she had finally established her sway by her fidelity, ability,  dexterity, and indomitable courage.  She served France habitually, Spain  and her own influence in Spain always; she had been charming, with an air  of nobility, grace, elegance, and majesty all together, and accustomed to  the highest society and the most delicate intrigues, during her sojourn  at Rome and Madrid; she was full of foresight and calculation, but  impassioned, ambitious, implacable, pushing to extremes her amity as well  as her hatred, faithful to her master and mistress in their most cruel  trials, and then hampering and retarding peace for the sake of securing  for herself a principality in the Low Countries.  Without having risen  from the ranks, like Madame de Maintenon, she had reached a less high and  less safe elevation; she had been more absolutely and more daringly  supreme during the time of her power, and at last she fell with the  rudest shock, without any support from Madame de Maintenon.  The  pretensions of Madame des Ursins during the negotiations had offended  France; \"this was the stone of stumbling between the two supreme  directresses,\" says St. Simon; after this attempt at sovereignty, there  was no longer the same accord between Madame de Maintenon and Madame des  Ursins, but this latter had reached in Spain a point at which she more  easily supposed that she could dispense with it.  The Queen of Spain had  died at the age of twenty-six, in 1714; did the princess for a moment  conceive the hope of marrying Philip V. in spite of the disproportion in  rank and age?  Nobody knows; she had already been reigning as sovereign  mistress for some months, when she received from the king this stunning  command: \"Look me out a wife.\"  She obeyed; she looked out.  Alberoni, an  Italian priest, brought into Spain by the Duke of Vendome, drew her  attention to the Princess of Parma, Elizabeth Farnese.  The principality  was small, the princess young; Alberoni laid stress upon her sweetness  and modesty.  \"Nothing will be more easy,\" he said, \"than for you to  fashion her to Spanish gravity, by keeping her retired; in the capacity  of her _camarera major,_ intrusted with her education, you will easily be  able to acquire complete sway over her mind.\"  The Princess des Ursins  believed him, and settled the marriage.  \"Cardonne has surrendered at  last, Madame,\" she wrote on the 20th of September, 1714, to Madame de  Maintenon; \"there is nothing left in Catalonia that is not reduced.  The  new queen, at her coming into this kingdom, is very fortunate to find no  more war there.  She whom we have lost would have been beside herself  with delight at enjoying peace after having experienced such cruel  sufferings of all kinds.  The longer I live, the more I see that we are  never so near a reverse of Fortune as when she is favorable, or so near  receiving favors as when she is maltreating us.  For that reason, Madame,  if one were wise, one would take her inconstancy graciously.\"    The time had come for Madame des Ursins to make definitive trial of  Fortune's inconstancy.  She had gone to meet the new queen, in full dress  and with her ornaments; Elizabeth received her coldly; they were left  alone; the queen reproached the princess with negligence in her costume  Madame des Ursins, strangely surprised, would have apologized, \"but, all  at once there was the queen at offensive words, and screaming, summoning,  demanding officers, guards, and imperiously ordering Madame des Ursins  out of her presence.  She would have spoken; but the queen, with  redoubled rage and threats, began to scream out for the removal of this  mad woman from her presence and her apartments; she had her put out by  the shoulders, and on the instant into a carriage with one of her women,  to be taken at once to St. Jean-de-Luz.  It was seven o'clock at night,  the day but one before Christmas, the ground all covered with ice and  snow; Madame des Ursins had no time to change gown or head-dress, to take  any measures against the cold, to get any money, or any anything else at  all.\"  Thus she was conducted almost without a mouthful of food to the  frontier of France.  She hoped for aid from the king of Spain; but none  came; it got known that the queen had been abetted in everything and  beforehand by Philip V.  On arriving at St. Jean-de-Luz, she wrote to the  king and to Madame de Maintenon: \"Can you possibly conceive, Madame, the  situation in which I find myself?  Treated in the face of all Europe,  with more contempt by the Queen of Spain than if I were the lowest of  wretches?  They want to persuade me that the king acted in concert with a  princess who had me treated with such cruelty.  I shall await his orders  at St. Jean-de-Luz, where I am in a small house close by the sea.  I see  it often stormy and sometimes calm; a picture of courts.  I shall have no  difficulty in agreeing with you that it is of no use looking for  stability but in God.  Certainly it cannot be found in the human heart,  for who was ever more sure than I was of the heart of the King of Spain?\"    The king did not reply at all, and Madame de Maintenon but coldly,  begging the princess, however, to go to Versailles.  There she passed but  a short time, and received notice to leave the kingdom.  With great  difficulty she obtained an asylum at Rome, where she lived seven years  longer, preserving all her health, strength, mind, and easy grace until  she died, in 1722, at more than eighty-four years of age, in obscurity  and sadness, notwithstanding her opulence, but avenged of her Spanish  foes, Cardinals della Giudice and Alberoni, whom she met again at Rome,  disgraced and fugitive like herself.  \"I do not know where I may die,\"  she wrote to Madame de Maintenon, at that time in retirement at St. Cyr.  Both had survived their power; the Princess des Ursins had not long since  wanted to secure for herself a dominion; Madame de Maintenon, more  far-sighted and more modest, had aspired to no more than repose in the  convent which she had founded and endowed.  Discreet in her retirement as  well as in her life, she had not left to chance the selection of a place  where she might die.    [Illustration: Death of Madame de Maintenon.----34]          CHAPTER L----LOUIS XIV.  AND DEATH.  1711-1715.    \"One has no more luck at our age,\" Louis XIV. had said to his old friend  Marshal Villars, returning from his most disastrous campaign.  It was a  bitter reflection upon  himself which had put these words into the king's  mouth.  After the most brilliant, the most continually and invariably  triumphant of reigns, he began to see Fortune slipping away  from him,  and the grievous consequences of his errors successively overwhelming the  state.  \"God is punishing me; I have richly deserved it,\" he said to  Marshal Villars, who was  on the point of setting out for the battle of  Denain.  The  aged king, dispirited and beaten, could not set down to men  his misfortunes and his reverses; the hand of God Himself was raised  against his house.  Death was knocking double knocks all round him.  The  grand-dauphin had for some days past been ill of small-pox.  The king had  gone to be with him at Meudon, forbidding the court to come near the  castle.  The small court of Monseigneur were huddled together in the  lofts.  The king was amused with delusive hopes; his chief physician,  Fagon, would answer for the invalid.  The  king continued to hold his  councils as usual, and the deputation of market-women (_dames de la  Halle_), come from Paris  to have news of Monseigneur, went away,  declaring that they would go and sing a Te Deum, as he was nearly well.  \"It is not time yet, my good women,\" said Monseigneur, who had given them  a reception.  That very evening he was dead,  without there having been  time to send for his confessor in ordinary.  \"The parish priest of  Meudon, who used to look in every evening before he went home, had found  all the doors open, the valets distracted, Fagon heaping remedy upon  remedy without waiting for them to take effect.  He entered the room, and  hurrying to Monseigneur's bedside, took his hand and spoke to him of God.  The poor prince was fully conscious, but almost speechless.  He repeated  distinctly a few words, others inarticulately, smote his breast, pressed  the priest's hand, appeared to have the most excellent sentiments, and  received absolution with an air of contrition and wistfulness.\"  [Memoires de St. Simon, ix.]  Meanwhile word had been sent to the king,  who arrived quite distracted.  The Princess of Conti, his daughter, who  was deeply attached to Monseigneur, repulsed him gently: \"You must think  only of yourself now, Sir,\" she said.  The king let himself sink down  upon a sofa, asking news of all that came out of the room, without any  one's daring to give him an answer.  Madame de Maintenon, who had hurried  to the king, and was agitated without being affected, tried to get him  away; she did not succeed, however, until Monseigneur had breathed his  last.  He passed along to his carriage between two rows of officers and  valets, all kneeling, and conjuring him to have pity upon them who had  lost all and were like to starve.    [Illustration: The King leaving the Death-bed of Monseigneur----36]    The excitement and confusion at Versailles were tremendous.  From the  moment that small-pox was declared, the princes had not been admitted to  Meudon.  The Duchess of Burgundy alone had occasionally seen the king.  All were living in confident expectation of a speedy convalescence; the  news of the death came upon them like a thunderclap.  All the courtiers  thronged together at once, the women half dressed, the men anxious and  concerned,"]]]
