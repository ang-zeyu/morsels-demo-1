The historian must not care for Philip, when he loses  his eye by the arrow of Aster, {53a} at Olynthus, nor for Alexander,  when he so cruelly killed Clytus at the banquet:  Cleon must not  terrify him, powerful as he was in the senate, and supreme at the  tribunal, nor prevent his recording him as a furious and pernicious  man; the whole city of Athens must not stop his relation of the  Sicilian slaughter, the seizure of Demosthenes, {53b} the death of  Nicias, their violent thirst, the water which they drank, and the  death of so many of them whilst they were drinking it.  He will  imagine (which will certainly be the case) that no man in his senses  will blame him for recording things exactly as they fell out.  However some may have miscarried by imprudence, or others by ill  fortune, he is only the relator, not the author of them.  If they  are beaten in a sea-fight, it is not he who sinks them; if they fly,  it is not he who pursues them; all he can do is to wish well to, and  offer up his vows for them; but by passing over or contradicting  facts, he cannot alter or amend them.  It would have been very easy  indeed for Thucydides, with a stroke of his pen, to have thrown down  the walls of Epipolis, sunk the vessel of Hermocrates, or made an  end of the execrable Gylippus, who stopped up all the avenues with  his walls and ditches; to have thrown the Syracusans on the  Lautumiae, and have let the Athenians go round Sicily and Italy,  according to the early hopes of Alcibiades:  but what is past and  done Clotho cannot weave again, nor Atropos recall.    The only business of the historian is to relate things exactly as  they are:  this he can never do as long as he is afraid of  Artaxerxes, whose physician {55a} he is; as long as he looks for the  purple robe, the golden chain, or the Nisaean horse, {55b} as the  reward of his labours; but Xenophon, that just writer, will not do  this, nor Thucydides.  The good historian, though he may have  private enmity against any man, will esteem the public welfare of  more consequence to him, and will prefer truth to resentment; and,  on the other hand, be he ever so fond of any man, will not spare him  when he is in the wrong; for this, as I before observed, is the most  essential thing in history, to sacrifice to truth alone, and cast  away all care for everything else.  The great universal rule and  standard is, to have regard not to those who read now, but to those  who are to peruse our works hereafter.    To speak impartially, the historians of former times were too often  guilty of flattery, and their works were little better than games  and sports, the effects of art.  Of Alexander, this memorable saying  is recorded:  \"I should be glad,\" said he, \"Onesicritus, after my  death, to come to life again for a little time, only to hear what  the people then living will say of me; for I am not surprised that  they praise and caress me now, as every one hopes by baiting well to  catch my favour.\"  Though Homer wrote a great many fabulous things  concerning Achilles, the world was induced to believe him, for this  only reason, because they were written long after his death, and no  cause could be assigned why he should tell lies about him.    The good historian, {56} then, must be thus described:  he must be  fearless, uncorrupted, free, the friend of truth and of liberty; one  who, to use the words of the comic poet, calls a fig a fig, {57a}  and a skiff a skiff, neither giving nor withholding from any, from  favour or from enmity, not influenced by pity, by shame, or by  remorse; a just judge, so far benevolent to all as never to give  more than is due to any in his work; a stranger to all, of no  country, bound only by his own laws, acknowledging no sovereign,  never considering what this or that man may say of him, but relating  faithfully everything as it happened.    This rule therefore Thucydides observed, distinguishing properly the  faults and perfections of history:  not unmindful of the great  reputation which Herodotus had acquired, insomuch that his books  were called by the names of the Muses. {57b}  Thucydides tells us  that he \"wrote for posterity, and not for present delight; that he  by no means approved of the fabulous, but was desirous of delivering  down the truth alone to future ages.\"  It is the useful, he adds,  which must constitute the merit of history, that by the  retrospection of what is past, when similar events occur, men may  know how to act in present exigencies.    Such an historian would I wish to have under my care:  with regard  to language and expression, I would not have it rough and vehement,  consisting of long periods, {58} or complex arguments; but soft,  quiet, smooth, and peaceable.  The reflections, short and frequent,  the style clear and perspicuous; for as freedom and truth should be  the principal perfections of the writer's mind, so, with regard to  language, the great point is to make everything plain and  intelligible, not to use remote and far-fetched phrases or  expressions, at the same time avoiding such as are mean and vulgar:  let it be, in short, what the lowest may understand; and, at the  same time, the most learned cannot but approve.  The whole may be  adorned with figure and metaphor, provided they are not turgid or  bombast, nor seem stiff and laboured, which, like meat too highly  seasoned, always give disgust.    History may sometimes assume a poetical form, and rise into a  magnificence of expression, when the subject demands it; and  especially when it is describing armies, battles, and sea-fights.  The Pierian spirit {59} is wanting then to swell the sails with a  propitious breeze, and carry the lofty ship over the tops of the  waves.  In general, the diction should creep humbly on the ground,  and only be raised as the grand and beautiful occurring shall  require it; keeping, in the meantime, within proper bounds, and  never soaring into enthusiasm; for then it is in danger of ranging  beyond its limits, into poetic fury:  we must then pull in the rein  and act with caution, well knowing that it is the worst vice of a  writer, as well as of a horse, to be wanton and unmanageable.  The  best way therefore is, whilst the mind of the historian is on  horseback, for his style to walk on foot, and take hold of the rein,  that it may not be left behind.    With regard to composition, the words should not be so blended and  transposed as to appear harsh and uncouth; nor should you, as some  do, subject them entirely to the rhythmus; {60} one is always  faulty, and the other disagreeable to the reader.    Facts must not be carelessly put together, but with great labour and  attention.  If possible, let the historian be an eye-witness of  everything he means to record; or, if that cannot be, rely on those  only who are incorrupt, and who have no bias from passion or  prejudice, to add or to diminish anything.  And here much sagacity  will be requisite to find out the real truth.  When he has collected  all or most of his materials, he will first make a kind of diary, a  body whose members are not yet distinct; he will then bring it into  order and beautify it, add the colouring of style and language,  adopt his expression to the subject, and harmonise the several parts  of it; then, like Homer's Jupiter, {61} who casts his eye sometimes  on the Thracian, and sometimes on the Mysian forces, he beholds now  the Roman, and now the Persian armies, now both, if they are  engaged, and relates what passes in them.  Whilst they are  embattled, his eye is not fixed on any particular part, nor on any  one leader, unless, perhaps, a Brasidas {62a} steps forth to scale  the walls, or a Demosthenes to prevent him.  To the generals he  gives his first attention, listens to their commands, their  counsels, and their determination; and, when they come to the  engagement, he weighs in equal scale the actions of both, and  closely attends the pursuer and the pursued, the conqueror and the  conquered.  All this must be done with temper and moderation, so as  not to satiate or tire, not inartificially, not childishly, but with  ease and grace.  When these things are properly taken care of, he  may turn aside to others, ever ready and prepared for the present  event, keeping time, {62b} as it were, with every circumstance and  event:  flying from Armenia to Media, and from thence with  clattering wings to Italy, or to Iberia, that not a moment may  escape him.    The mind of the historian should resemble a looking-glass, shining  clear and exactly true, representing everything as it really is, and  nothing distorted, or of a different form or colour.  He writes not  to the masters of eloquence, but simply relates what is done.  It is  not his to consider what he shall say, but only how it is to be  said.  He may be compared to Phidias, Praxiteles, Alcamenus, or  other eminent artists; for neither did they make the gold, the  silver, the ivory, or any of the materials which they worked upon.  These were supplied by the Elians, the Athenians, and Argives; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10444"],[0,"The Peace Negotiations: A Personal Narrative (#6)"],[1,"upon the  loyalty of his political opponents lost to the Democratic Party the  Senate and largely reduced its membership in the House of  Representatives if it did not in fact deprive the party of control of  that body. The result, however, did not mean that the President's ideas  as to the terms of peace were repudiated, but that his practical  assertion, that refusal to accept his policies was unpatriotic, was  repudiated by the American people.    It is very apparent to one, who without prejudice reviews the state of  public sentiment in December, 1918, that the trouble, which later  developed as to a League of Nations, did not lie in the necessity of  convincing the peoples of the world, their governments, and their  delegates to the Paris Conference that it was desirable to organize the  world to prevent future wars, but in deciding upon the form and  functions of the organization to be created. As to these details, which  of course affected the character, the powers, and the duties of the  organization, there had been for years a wide divergence of opinion.  Some advocated the use of international force to prevent a nation from  warring against another. Some favored coercion by means of general  ostracism and non-intercourse. Some believed that the application of  legal justice through the medium of international tribunals and  commissions was the only practical method of settling disputes which  might become causes of war. And some emphasized the importance of a  mutual agreement to postpone actual hostilities until there could be an  investigation as to the merits of a controversy. There were thus two  general classes of powers proposed which were in the one case political  and in the other juridical. The cleavage of opinion was along these  lines, although it possibly was not recognized by the general public. It  was not only shown in the proposed powers, but also in the proposed form  of the organization, the one centering on a politico-diplomatic body,  and the other on an international judiciary. Naturally the details of  any plan proposed would become the subject of discussion and the  advisability of adopting the provisions would arouse controversy and  dispute. Thus unanimity in approving a world organization did not mean  that opinions might not differ radically in working out the fundamental  principles of its form and functions, to say nothing of the detailed  plan based on these principles.    In May, 1916, President Wilson accepted an invitation to address the  first annual meeting of the League to Enforce Peace, which was to be  held in Washington. After preparing his address he went over it and  erased all reference to the use of physical force in preventing wars. I  mention this as indicative of the state of uncertainty in which he was  in the spring of 1916 as to the functions and powers of the  international organization to maintain peace which he then advocated. By  January, 1917, he had become convinced that the use of force was the  practical method of checking aggressions. This conversion was probably  due to the fact that he had in his own mind worked out, as one of the  essential bases of peace, to which he was then giving much thought, a  mutual guaranty of territorial integrity and political independence,  which had been the chief article of a proposed Pan-American Treaty  prepared early in 1915 and to which he referred in his address before  the League to Enforce Peace. He appears to have reached the conclusion  that a guaranty of this sort would be of little value unless supported  by the threatened, and, if necessary, the actual, employment of force.  The President was entirely logical in this attitude. A guaranty against  physical aggression would be practically worthless if it did not rest on  an agreement to protect with physical force. An undertaking to protect  carried with it the idea of using effectual measures to insure  protection. They were inseparable; and the President, having adopted an  affirmative guaranty against aggression as a cardinal provision--perhaps  I should say _the_ cardinal provision--of the anticipated peace treaty,  could not avoid becoming the advocate of the use of force in making good  the guaranty.    During the year 1918 the general idea of the formation of an  international organization to prevent war was increasingly discussed in  the press of the United States and Europe and engaged the thought of the  Governments of the Powers at war with the German Empire. On January 8 of  that year President Wilson in an address to Congress proclaimed his  \"Fourteen Points,\" the adoption of which he considered necessary to a  just and stable peace. The last of these \"Points\" explicitly states the  basis of the proposed international organization and the fundamental  reason for its formation. It is as follows:       \"XIV. A general association of nations must be formed under specific     covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political     independence and territorial integrity to great and small     states alike.\"    This declaration may be considered in view of subsequent developments to  be a sufficiently clear announcement of the President's theory as to the  plan of organization which ought to be adopted, but at the time the  exact character of the \"mutual guarantees\" was not disclosed and aroused  little comment. I do not believe that Congress, much less the public at  large, understood the purpose that the President had in mind.  Undoubtedly, too, a sense of loyalty to the Chief Executive, while the  war was in progress, and the desire to avoid giving comfort of any sort  to the enemy, prevented a critical discussion of the announced bases of  peace, some of which were at the time academic, premature, and liable to  modification if conditions changed.    In March Lord Phillimore and his colleagues made their preliminary  report to the British Government on \"a League of Nations\" and this was  followed in July by their final report, copies of which reached the  President soon after they were made. The time had arrived for putting  into concrete form the general ideas that the President held, and  Colonel House, whom some believed to be the real author of Mr. Wilson's  conception of a world union, prepared, I am informed, the draft of a  scheme of organization. This draft was either sent or handed to the  President and discussed with him. To what extent it was amended or  revised by Mr. Wilson I do not know, but in a modified form it became  the typewritten draft of the Covenant which he took with him to Paris,  where it underwent several changes. In it was the guaranty of 1915,  1916, 1917, and 1918, which, from the form in which it appeared,  logically required the use of force to give it effect.    Previous to the departure of the American Commission for Paris, on  December 4, 1918, the President did not consult me as to his plan for a  League of Nations. He did not show me a copy of the plan or even mention  that one had been put into writing. I think that there were two reasons  for his not doing so, although I was the official adviser whom he should  naturally consult on such matters.    The first reason, I believe, was due to the following facts. In our  conversations prior to 1918 I had uniformly opposed the idea of the  employment of international force to compel a nation to respect the  rights of other nations and had repeatedly urged judicial settlement as  the practical way of composing international controversies, though I did  not favor the use of force to compel such settlement.    To show my opposition to an international agreement providing for the  use of force and to show that President Wilson knew of this opposition  and the reasons for it, I quote a letter which I wrote to him in May,  1916, that is, two years and a half before the end of the war:       \"_May 25, 1916_       \"My DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:       \"I had hoped to see you to-morrow at Cabinet meeting, but to-day the     Doctor refused to allow me to leave the house this week. I intended     when I saw you to say something about the purposes of the League to     Enforce Peace, which is to meet here, and at the banquet of which I     understand you are to speak on Saturday night. I would have preferred     to talk the matter over with you, but as that is impossible I have     taken the liberty to write you this letter, although in doing so I am     violating the directions of the Doctor.       \"While I have not had time or opportunity to study carefully the     objects of the proposed League to Enforce Peace, I understand the     fundamental ideas are these, which are to be embodied in a general     treaty of the nations: _First_, an agreement to submit all     differences which fail of diplomatic adjustment to arbitration or a     board of conciliation; and, _second_, in case a government fails to     comply with this provision, an agreement that the other parties will     unite in compelling it to do so by an exercise of force.       \"With the first agreement I am in accord to an extent, but I cannot     see how it is practicable to apply it in case of a continuing     invasion of fundamental national or individual rights unless some     authoritative international body has the power to impose and enforce     an order in the nature of an injunction, which will prevent the     aggressor from further action until arbitration has settled the     rights of the parties. How this can be done in a practical way I have     not attempted to work out, but the problem is not easy, especially     the part which relates to the enforcement of the order.       \"It is, however, the second agreement in regard to the imposition of     international arbitration by force, which seems to me the most     difficult, especially when viewed from the standpoint of its effects     on our national sovereignty and national interests. It is needless to     go into the manifest"]]]
