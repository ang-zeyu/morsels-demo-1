On the one hand, human life depends on the word of a judge, who may err  in the case of capital punishment; and society cannot end the life of a  man, unless the necessity of legitimate self-defense demands it. On the  other hand, solitary confinement came in with the second current of the  classic school of criminology, when at the same time, in which Beccaria  promulgated his ideas, John Howard traveled all over Europe describing  the unmentionable horrors of mass imprisonment, which became a center of  infection for society at large. Then the classic school went to the  other extreme of solitary confinement, after the model of America,  whence we adopted the systems of Philadelphia and Harrisburg in the  first half of the nineteenth century. Isolation for the night is also  our demand, but we object to continuous solitary confinement by day and  night. Pasquale Mancini called solitary confinement \"a living grave,\" in  order to reassure the timorous, when in the name of the classic school,  whose valiant champion he was, he demanded in 1876 the abolition of  capital punishment. Yet in his swan song he recognized that the future  would belong to the positive school of criminology. And it is this  \"living grave\" against which we protest. It cannot possibly be an act of  human justice to bury a human being in a narrow cell, within four walls,  to prevent this being from having any contact with social life, and to  say to him at the end of his term: Now that your lungs are no longer  accustomed to breathing the open air, now that your legs are no longer  used to the rough roads, go, but take care not, to have a relapse, or  your sentence will be twice as hard.    In reality, solitary confinement makes of a human being either a stupid  creature, or a raving beast. And \"s'io dico il vero, l'effeto nol  nasconde\"--if I speak the truth, the facts will also reveal it--for  criminality increases and expands, honest people remain unprotected, and  those who are struck by the law do not improve, but become ever more  antisocial through the repeated relapses. And so we have that contrast  which I mentioned in the beginning of my lecture, that the theoretical  side of criminal science is so perfected, while criminal conditions are  painfully in evidence. The inevitable conclusion is the necessity of a  progressive transformation of the science of crime and punishment.          OF CRIMINOLOGY.      II.    We saw yesterday in a short historical review that the classic cycle of  the science of crime and punishment, originated by Cesare Beccaria more  than a century ago, was followed in our country, some twenty years  since, by the scientific movement of the positive school of criminology.  Let us see today how this school studied the problem of criminality,  reserving for tomorrow the discussion of the remedies proposal by this  school for the disease of criminality.    When a crime is committed in some place, attracting public attention  either through the atrocity of the case or the strangeness of the  criminal deed--for instance, one that is not connected with bloodshed,  but with intellectual fraud--there are at once two tendencies that make  themselves felt in the public conscience. One of them, pervading the  overwhelming majority of individual consciences, asks: How is this? What  for? Why did that man commit such a crime? This question is asked by  everybody and occupies mostly the attention of those who do not look  upon the case from the point of view of criminology. On the other hand,  those who occupy themselves with criminal law represent the other  tendency, which manifests itself when acquainted with the news of this  crime. This is a limited portion of the public conscience, which tries  to study the problem from the standpoint of the technical jurist. The  lawyers, the judges, the officials of the police, ask themselves: What  is the name of the crime committed by that man under such circumstances?  Must it be classed us murder or patricide, attempted or incompleted  manslaughter, and, if directed against property, is it theft, or illegal  appropriation, or fraud? And the entire apparatus of practical criminal  justice forgets at once the first problem, which occupies the majority  of the public conscience, the question of the causes that led to this  crime, in order to devote itself exclusively to the technical side of  the problem which constitutes the juridical anatomy of the inhuman and  antisocial deed perpetrated by the criminal.    In these two tendencies you have a photographic reproduction of the two  schools of criminology. The classic school, which looks upon the crime  as a juridical problem, occupies itself with its name, its definition,  its juridical analysis, leaves the personality of the criminal in the  background and remembers it only so far as exceptional circumstances  explicitly stated in the law books refer to it: whether he is a minor, a  deaf-mute, whether it is a case of insanity, whether he was drunk at the  time the crime was committed. Only in these strictly defined cases does  the classic school occupy itself theoretically with the personality of  the criminal. But ninety times in one hundred these exceptional  circumstances do not exist or cannot be shown to exist, and penal  justice limits itself to the technical definition of the fact. But when  the case comes up in the criminal court, or before the jurors, practice  demonstrates that there is seldom a discussion between the lawyers of  the defense and the judges for the purpose of ascertaining the most  exact definition of the fact, of determining whether it is a case of  attempted or merely projected crime, of finding out whether there are  any of the juridical elements defined in this or that article of the  code. The judge is rather face to face with the problem of ascertaining  why, under what conditions, for what reasons, the man has committed the  crime. This is the supreme and simple human problem. But hitherto it has  been left to a more or less perspicacious, more or less gifted,  empiricism, and there have been no scientific standards, no methodical  collection of facts, no observations and conclusions, save those of the  positive school of criminology. This school alone makes an attempt to  solve in every case of crime the problem of its natural origin, of the  reasons and conditions that induced a man to commit such and such a  crime.    For instance, about 3,000 cases of manslaughter are registered every  year in Italy. Now, open any work inspired by the classic school of  criminology, and ask the author why 3,000 men are the victims of  manslaughter every year in Italy, and how it is that there are not  sometimes only as many as, say, 300 cases, the number committed in  England, which has nearly the same number of inhabitants as Italy; and  how it is that there are not sometimes 300,000 such cases in Italy  instead of 3,000?    It is useless to open any work of classical criminology for this  purpose, for you will not find an answer to these questions in than. No  one, from Beccaria to Carrara, has ever thought of this problem, and  they could not have asked it, considering their point of departure and  their method. In fact, the classic criminologists accept the phenomenon  of criminality as an accomplished fact. They analyze it from the point  of view of the technical jurist, without asking how this criminal fact  may have been produced, and why it repeats itself in greater or smaller  numbers from year to year, in every country. The theory of a free will,  which is their foundation, excludes the possibility of this scientific  question, for according to it the crime is the product of the fiat of  the human will. And if that is admitted as a fact, there is nothing left  to account for. The manslaughter was committed, because the criminal  wanted to commit it; and that is all there is to it. Once the theory of  a free will is accepted as a fact, the deed depends on the fiat, the  voluntary determination, of the criminal, and all is said.    But if, on the other hand, the positive school of criminology denies, on  the ground of researches in scientific physiological psychology, that  the human will is free and does not admit that one is a criminal because  he wants to be, but declares that a man commits this or that crime only  when he lives in definitely determined conditions of personality and  environment which induce him necessarily to act in a certain way, then  alone does the problem of the origin of criminality begin to be  submitted to a preliminary analysis, and then alone does criminal law  step out of the narrow and arid limits of technical jurisprudence and  become a true social and human science in the highest and noblest  meaning of the word. It is vain to insist with such stubbornness as that  of the classic school of criminology on juristic formulas by which the  distinction between illegal appropriation and theft, between fraud and  other forms of crime against property, and so forth, is determined, when  this method does not give to society one single word which would throw  light upon the reasons that make a man a criminal and upon the  efficacious remedy by which society could protect itself against  criminality.    It is true that the classic school of criminology has likewise its  remedy against crime--namely, punishment. But this is the only remedy of  that school, and in all the legislation inspired by the theories of that  school in all the countries of the civilized world there is no other  remedy against crime but repression.    But Bentham has said: Every time that punishment is inflicted it proves  its inefficacy, for it did not prevent the committal of that crime.  Therefore, this remedy is worthless. And a deeper study of the cause of  crime demonstrates that if a man does not commit a certain crime, this  is due to entirely different reasons, than a fear "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10586"],[0,"Mike and Psmith (#6)"],[1,"was empty when they opened the door; the call to food was  evidently a thing not to be treated lightly by the enemy.    In the dining room the beleaguered garrison were the object of general  attention. Everybody turned to look at them as they came in. It was  plain that the study episode had been a topic of conversation. Spiller's  face was crimson, and Robinson's coat sleeve still bore traces of  garden mold.    Mike felt rather conscious of the eyes, but Psmith was in his element.  His demeanor throughout the meal was that of some whimsical monarch  condescending for a freak to revel with his humble subjects.    Toward the end of the meal Psmith scribbled a note and passed it to  Mike. It read: \"Directly this is over, nip upstairs as quickly as  you can.\"    Mike followed the advice; they were first out of the room. When they had  been in the study a few moments, Jellicoe knocked at the door. \"Lucky  you two cut away so quick,\" he said. \"They were going to try and get you  into the senior day room and scrag you there.\"    \"This,\" said Psmith, leaning against the mantelpiece, \"is exciting, but  it can't go on. We have got for our sins to be in this place for a whole  term, and if we are going to do the Hunted Fawn business all the time,  life in the true sense of the word will become an impossibility. My  nerves are so delicately attuned that the strain would simply reduce  them to hash. We are not prepared to carry on a long campaign--the thing  must be settled at once.\"    \"Shall we go down to the senior day room, and have it out?\" said Mike.    \"No, we will play the fixture on our own ground. I think we may take it  as tolerably certain that Comrade Spiller and his hired ruffians will  try to corner us in the dormitory tonight. Well, of course, we could  fake up some sort of barricade for the door, but then we should have all  the trouble over again tomorrow and the day after that. Personally I  don't propose to be chivied about indefinitely like this, so I propose  that we let them come into the dormitory, and see what happens. Is this  meeting with me?\"    \"I think that's sound,\" said Mike. \"We needn't drag Jellicoe into it.\"    \"As a matter of fact--if you don't mind ...\" began that man of peace.    \"Quite right,\" said Psmith; \"this is not Comrade Jellicoe's scene at  all; he has got to spend the term in the senior day room, whereas we  have our little wooden _chalet_ to retire to in times of stress. Comrade  Jellicoe must stand out of the game altogether. We shall be glad of his  moral support, but otherwise, _ne pas_. And now, as there won't be  anything doing till bedtime, I think I'll collar this table and write  home and tell my people that all is well with their Rupert.\"        6    UNPLEASANTNESS IN THE SMALL HOURS      Jellicoe, that human encyclopedia, consulted on the probable movements  of the enemy, deposed that Spiller, retiring at ten, would make for  Dormitory One in the same passage, where Robinson also had a bed. The  rest of the opposing forces were distributed among other and more  distant rooms. It was probable, therefore, that Dormitory One would be  the rendezvous. As to the time when an attack might be expected, it was  unlikely that it would occur before half past eleven. Mr. Outwood went  the round of the dormitories at eleven.    \"And touching,\" said Psmith, \"the matter of noise, must this business be  conducted in a subdued and _sotto voce_ manner, or may we let ourselves  go a bit here and there?\"    \"I shouldn't think old Outwood's likely to hear you--he sleeps miles  away on the other side of the house. He never hears anything. We often  rag half the night and nothing happens.\"    \"This appears to be a thoroughly nice, well-conducted establishment.  What would my mother say if she could see her Rupert in the midst of  these reckless youths!\"    \"All the better,\" said Mike; \"we don't want anybody butting in and  stopping the show before it's half started.\"    \"Comrade Jackson's berserk blood is up--I can hear it sizzling. I quite  agree these things are all very disturbing and painful, but it's as well  to do them thoroughly when one's once in for them. Is there nobody else  who might interfere with our gambols?\"    \"Barnes might,\" said Jellicoe, \"only he won't.\"    \"Who is Barnes?\"    \"Head of the house--a rotter. He's in a funk of Stone and Robinson; they  rag him; he'll simply sit tight.\"    \"Then I think,\" said Psmith placidly, \"we may look forward to a very  pleasant evening. Shall we be moving?\"    Mr. Outwood paid his visit at eleven, as predicted by Jellicoe, beaming  vaguely into the darkness over a torch, and disappeared again,  closing the door.    \"How about that door?\" said Mike. \"Shall we leave it open for them?\"    \"Not so, but far otherwise. If it's shut we shall hear them at it when  they come. Subject to your approval, Comrade Jackson, I have evolved the  following plan of action. I always ask myself on these occasions, 'What  would Napoleon have done?' I think Napoleon would have sat in a chair by  his washhand stand, which is close to the door; he would have posted you  by your washhand stand, and he would have instructed Comrade Jellicoe,  directly he heard the door handle turned, to give his celebrated  imitation of a dormitory breathing heavily in its sleep. He  would then--\"    \"I tell you what,\" said Mike, \"How about tying a string at the top of  the steps?\"    \"Yes, Napoleon would have done that, too. Hats off to Comrade Jackson,  the man with the big brain!\"    The floor of the dormitory was below the level of the door. There were  three steps leading down to it. Psmith switched on his torch and they  examined the ground. The leg of a wardrobe and the leg of Jellicoe's bed  made it possible for the string to be fastened in a satisfactory manner  across the lower step. Psmith surveyed the result with approval.    \"Dashed neat!\" he said. \"Practically the sunken road which dished the  Cuirassiers at Waterloo. I seem to see Comrade Spiller coming one of the  finest purlers in the world's history.\"    \"If they've got a torch--\"    \"They won't have. If they have, stand by and grab it at once; then  they'll charge forward and all will be well. If they have no light, fire  into the brown with a jug of water. Lest we forget, I'll collar Comrade  Jellicoe's jug now and keep it handy. A couple of sheets would also not  be amiss--we will enmesh the enemy!\"    \"Right ho!\" said Mike.    \"These humane preparations being concluded,\" said Psmith, \"we will  retire to our posts and wait. Comrade Jellicoe, don't forget to breathe  like an asthmatic sheep when you hear the door opened; they may wait at  the top of the steps, listening.\"    \"You _are_ a lad!\" said Jellicoe.    Waiting in the dark for something to happen is always a trying  experience, especially if, as on this occasion, silence is essential.  Mike was tired after his journey, and he had begun to doze when he was  jerked back to wakefulness by the stealthy turning of the door handle;  the faintest rustle from Psmith's direction followed, and a slight  giggle, succeeded by a series of deep breaths, showed that Jellicoe,  too, had heard the noise.    There was a creaking sound.    It was pitch-dark in the dormitory, but Mike could follow the invaders'  movements as clearly as if it had been broad daylight. They had opened  the door and were listening. Jellicoe's breathing grew more asthmatic;  he was flinging himself into his part with the wholeheartedness of the  true artist.    The creak was followed by a sound of whispering, then another creak. The  enemy had advanced to the top step.... Another creak.... The vanguard  had reached the second step.... In another moment--    CRASH!    And at that point the proceedings may be said to have formally opened.    A struggling mass bumped against Mike's shins as he rose from his chair;  he emptied his jug onto this mass, and a yell of anguish showed that the  contents had got to the right address.    Then a hand grabbed his ankle and he went down, a million sparks dancing  before his eyes as a fist, flying out at a venture, caught him on  the nose.    Mike had not been well disposed toward the invaders before, but now he  ran amok, hitting out right and left at random. His right missed, but  his left went home hard on some portion of somebody's anatomy. A kick  freed his ankle and he staggered to his feet. At the same moment a  sudden increase in the general volume of noise spoke eloquently of good  work that was being put in by Psmith.    Even at that crisis, Mike could not help feeling that if a row of this  caliber did not draw Mr. Outwood from his bed, he must be an unusual  kind of housemaster.    He plunged forward again with outstretched arms, and stumbled and fell  over one of the on-the-floor section of the opposing force. They seized  each other earnestly and rolled across the room till Mike, contriving to  secure his adversary's head, bumped it on the floor with such abandon  that, with a muffled yell, the other let go, and for the second time he  rose. As he did so he was conscious of a curious thudding sound that  made itself heard through the other assorted noises of the battle.    All this time the fight had gone on in the blackest darkness, but now a  light shone on the proceedings. Interested occupants of other  dormitories, roused from their slumbers, had come to observe the sport.  They had switched on the light and were crowding in the doorway.    By the light of this Mike got a swift view of the theater of war. The  enemy appeared to number five. The warrior whose head Mike had bumped on  the floor was Robinson, who was sitting up feeling his skull in a  gingerly fashion. To Mike's right, almost touching him, was Stone. In  the direction of the door, Psmith, wielding in his right hand the cord  of a dressing gown, was engaging the remaining three with a  patient smile.    They were clad in pajamas, and appeared to be feeling the"]]]
