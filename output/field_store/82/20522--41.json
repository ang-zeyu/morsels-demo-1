One night the sky was darkened, the lightning flashed, the rain fell  in torrents, and a voice cried from the clouds, above the roar of  the thunder:    \"I am Pride. Avoid me or perish.\"    Terrified, they prayed to God for protection, but with the morning  sun their fears left them and they continued as before.    Days passed and the people grew richer, but, not satisfied with their  wealth and with their own beautiful island, they longed to possess  the lands of their neighbors.    Again came the storm, and again a voice cried from the heavens:    \"I am Covetousness. Come to me and die.\"    Once more they appealed for protection, but they did not change  their ways.    Weeks went by, and with wealth came low and base desires. The storm  came as before and brought the warning:    \"I am Evil Desire. Fly from me or be lost.\"    But again it sounded to sealed ears. Months rolled on. The people  quarreled with their neighbors, and sent forth an army to make war  upon them. The voice thundered:    \"I am Anger. I give eternal torment.\"    Years followed, and the tables of the people of Polobulac were loaded  with the finest foods and wines. Day and night found them feasting. The  cry sounded above them:    \"I am Gluttony. I devour my children.\"    The winds alone echoed the warning.    Time flew by. Each man sought to outdo the others in display of luxury  and magnificence. The poor grudged the rich their fortunes, and sought  in every way to injure them. Again a voice came through the darkness:    \"I am Envy. My people are condemned.\"    But they closed their ears and would not hear.    More wealth brought greater luxury. They lolled in idleness. They  idled in the midst of magnificence. The voice warned:    \"I am Sloth. I bring final warning.\"    They were used to the voices now, and gave them not the slightest  heed. Their insolence and greed grew greater. The fair island shook  with dissension and strife.    One day the sun was hidden by blackness. A fearful tempest burst over  the land. The people on the other islands saw Polobulac wrapped in  seven huge pillars of flame.    When the sky cleared, Polobulac was nowhere to be seen. In its place,  seven blackened rocks marked the spot where stood the beautiful isle.    They are there to this day. You can see them as you leave the harbor  for southern ports. Sometimes they appear as one. Again they seem to  group in twos and threes. But there are seven.    They are called the Deadly Sins.        The Escape of Juanita        Have you heard of the terrible Tic-balan,  A tall and thin and very black man,  With terrible teeth and a horse's head,  And covered with hair that is long and red?      He lives in the awful Balete tree,  And to pass the place you must say \"Tabi\";  If you do not, the Asuang comes at night,  And throws big stones till you die of fright.      Now once there lived in Santa Cruz town  A little girl known as Juanita Calaon;  She was gentle and sweet and as good as could be,  And she always bowed low to the Balete tree.      One day to the forest alone she did roam  To get some good wood for the fire at home;  She gathered some twigs that she found on the ground,  And all of them fast in a bundle she bound.      Then happy and free, with the pack on her head,  She followed the road that back to town led.  She sang as she walked, and so happy was she  That alas! she bowed not to the Balete tree.      All at once then she heard a most terrible roar,  And the Tic-balan fierce through the air seemed to soar.  He seized poor Juanita, and quick as could be  He shut her inside of the Balete tree.      Two days passed, and when the girl failed to come back,  Her parents went out, and no friends did they lack  To help in the search, for the whole pueblo came,  And loudly they shouted poor Juanita's name.      At last when they thought that the search brought no good,  One man found Juanita's neat bundle of wood;  He called the good news, and as more came to see,  Loud knocking was heard in the Balete tree.      Then many were frightened, but many were brave,  And wondered by what means the girl they could save;  For they knew that it must be Juanita who knocked,  And that inside the Balete tree she was locked.      Soon they ordered that candles and music be brought,  And a crucifix holy was what they next sought;  And when all was ready they closed round the tree,  While they prayed to the true God to set the girl free.      They lighted the candles and then the band played,  And Juanita's mother, who was not afraid,  Advanced with the crucifix held in her hand,  And tapped with the cross on the evil tree grand.      Then a roar shook the forest and chilled all their hearts,  And the awful Balete split into two parts;  Then they saw in the center, as each big half fell,  Their darling Juanita all smiling and well.      She ran from the tree to her fond mother dear,  While the band played and every one gave a loud cheer;  Then back to the pueblo they danced in delight,  And kept up their singing through all the long night.      Still there to this day lies the Balete tree,  But no more do the people that pass say \"Tabi.\"  And the spirit no more can molest any man,  For God has more power than the fierce Tic-balan.          The Anting-Anting of Manuelito    The Anting-Anting is a stone or other small object covered with  cabalistic inscriptions. It is worn around the neck, and is supposed  to render its owner impervious to knife or bullet. Many are wearing  these charms, especially the Tulisanes or outlaws. The Anting-Anting  must not be confused, however, with the scapular, a purely religious  symbol worn by a great number of the Christian Filipinos.    Many of the older Filipinos remember Manuelito, the great Tulisane,  who, more than fifty years ago, kept all the Laguna de Bai district  in a state of fear. His robber band was well organized and obeyed his  slightest wish. He had many boats on the lake and many hiding places  in the mountains, and throughout the country there was no villager  who did not fear to oppose him, or who would refuse to help him in  any way when required to do so.    In vain the Guardia Civil hunted him. Many times they surrounded the  band, but Manuelito always escaped. Many shots were fired at him,  but he was never hit; and once, when he was cut off from his men  and surrounded, he broke through the line, and though fifty bullets  whistled around him he did not receive a scratch.    The officers of the Guardia Civil blamed their men for the bad  marksmanship that allowed Manuelito to escape. They told all the  people that it should never occur again, and promised that the next  fight should end in the death of the outlaw. The people, however,  did not believe that Manuelito could be killed, for he wore on his  breast a famous Anting-Anting that he had received from Mangagauay,  the giver of life and death.    This charm was a stone covered with mysterious signs. It was wrapped  in silk and hung by a string from the robber's neck, and even if a  gun were fired within a few feet of him the Anting-Anting was sure to  turn the bullet in another direction. It was this charm that always  saved him from the Guardia Civil.    Manuelito was very proud of his Anting-Anting, and many times, when  a fiesta was being held in some town, he and his band would come down  from the mountains and take part in the games. Manuelito would stand  in the town plaza and allow his men to shoot at him, and each time  the Anting-Anting would turn aside the bullets. The people were very  much impressed, and though a few of the wiser ones secretly thought  that the guns were only loaded with powder, they were afraid to say  anything; so the greater number thought it very wonderful and believed  that there was no charm so powerful as the Anting-Anting of Manuelito.    For years the Tulisane, protected by his charm, continued to rob and  plunder. The Guardia Civil hunted him everywhere, but could never  kill him. He grew bolder and bolder, and even came close to Manila  to rob the little towns just outside the city.    At last the government grew tired of sending out the Guardia Civil,  and ordered a regiment of Macabebes to hunt and kill the Tulisane  and his men.    Manuelito was at Pasay when news was brought to him that the Macabebes  were coming. Instead of running from these fierce little fighters, he  decided to meet them, and many people offered to help him, believing  that the Anting-Anting would turn away all bullets and give them  victory. So Manuelito and many men left the town, built trenches in the  hills near San Pedro Macati, and waited for the Macabebes to appear.    They had not long to wait. The Macabebes, hurrying from Manila, reached  San Pedro Macati and soon found that Manuelito was waiting to fight  them. They left the town at once and advanced on the Tulisane trenches.    It was a great fight. From the other hills close by many people watched  the battle. Five times the Macabebes advanced, and were forced to  fall back before the fierce fire of the Tulisanes. But the Macabebe  never knows defeat, and once more their line went forward and in one  terrible charge swept over the trenches and bayoneted the outlaws. In  vain Manuelito called on his men to fight. They broke and ran in every  direction. Then, seeing that all was lost, Manuelito started to follow  them; but a volley rang out, and, struck by twenty bullets, he fell to  the ground dead. The Macabebes chased the flying Tulisanes and killed  that of all the band only a few many, safely reached the mountains.    While the Macabebes were chasing the outlaws, many people came down  from the hills and stood around the body of Manuelito. They could  hardly believe their eyes, but the many wounds and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10773"],[0,"Ancient and Modern Physics (#6)"],[1,"time (eighteen years  ago), it was considered by many timid conservative scientists as  'a daring movement.'  It is noteworthy in that it was the first  public scientific announcement that the physical matter is a  manifestation or form of the ether.  And it was made before  general acceptance of the division of the ether into soniferous,  luminiferous and tangiferous.    \"'Which in whirls constitutes matter.'  Professor Lodge believed  that 'some etheric molecules revolved so rapidly on their axis  that they could not be penetrated.'  Watch the soap-bubbles that  I am blowing.  Each and every one is revolving as the earth  revolves, from west to east.  What I wish to call your attention  to is the fact that can be proven, both mathematically and  theoretically, that at a certain rate of speed in the revolution  they could not be penetrated by any rifle-ball.  At a higher rate  of speed they would be harder than globes of solid chilled steel,  harder even than carbon.  Professor Lodge believed that the  etheric molecule revolved so rapidly that, thin as it was in its  shell, it gave us the dust out of which worlds were made.  There  is one fatal error in this idea, although it is held even now by  many.  It is based entirely on gravity, and gravity is alone  considered in its problems.  There are two great forces in the  universe, not one, as many scientific people fail to remember  --Gravity and Apergy, or the centrifugal and centripetal forces.  The pull in is and must be always balanced by the pull out.  There is in the universe as much repulsion as attraction, and the  former is a force quite as important as the latter.  The bubble's  speed kept increasing until apergy, the tendency to fly off,  overcame gravity, and it ruptured.    \"Professor Lodge failed to take into account this apergic force,  this tendency to fly off, when he gave such high revolutionary  speed to the etheric molecules, a speed in which apergy would  necessarily exceed gravity.  The failure to take apergy into  consideration has been the undoing of many physicists.    \"Today we know that the ether is matter, the same as our own,  only finer and rarer and in much more rapid vibration.  We know  that this ether has its solids, liquids and gases formed from  molecules of its atoms, even as our own are formed.  We know that  its atoms combine as ours do, and while we have but eighty  elementary combinations, it must have more than double the  number.  We know that every form and shape and combination of  these elements from this plane flows from inherited tendencies  having their root in the etheric world.    \"The two worlds are one world--as much at one with ours as the  world of gas about us is at one with our liquids and solids.  It  is 'continuity, not impact.'  They not only touch everywhere and  in everything, but they are one and the same in action and  reaction.\"    Thus spake a certain wise teacher of physics.  To his wise  utterances, we can only add that such as we are today \"we see  through a glass, darkly.\"  Yet there will come a day when the  physical bandages will be removed from our eyes, and we shall see  face to face the beauty and grandeur and glory of this invisible  world, and that in truth it 'transmits by continuity and not  impact every action and reaction of which matter is capable,'  forming one continuous chain of cause and effect, without a link  missing.  There are no gulfs to cross;  no bridges to be made.  It is here;  not there.  It is at one with us.  And we are at one  with it.  One and the same law controls and guides the etheric  atom and the physical atom made from its molecules, whether the  latter are made in \"whirls,\" as at first supposed, or by orderly  combination as now believed.    In fact, this visible world of ours is the perfect product of the  other invisible one, having in it its root and foundation, the  very sap of its life.          Chapter Five    The Four Manifested Planes    The oriental idea of the universe does not differ fundamentally  in its general conception, from that of modern science, but it  goes farther and explains more.  The physics of the secret  doctrine are based upon a material universe of four planes of  vibration and a spiritual universe of three planes of vibration  beyond matter.  This Something in vibration may be given the  English name, Consciousness--without entering upon its nature.    Spirit is consciousness in vibration and undifferentiated.    Matter is consciousness in vibration and differentiated.    As we divide the seven octaves of a piano into Treble and Bass  for clearness of thought and writing, so the Hidden Knowledge  divides the seven octaves of vibration, or planes, into Spirit  and Matter.  In their ultimate analysis they are one and the same  thing, as ice and water are the same thing;  but for study they  must be differentiated.    The material and physical universe consists of four planes of  matter, or four great octaves of vibration, each differentiated  from the other as in our physics prakriti is differentiated from  ether.  The material universe, the ancient physics teach, was  originally pure thought, Manasa, the product of the spiritual  planes above.  This manasic world was differentiated, a real  world.  That is to say it was given elementary substances by the  union of its atoms in different sized molecules.  Some of its  elements combined and formed Prana.  The prana gathered and  formed other worlds, pranic worlds.  Then in the pranic world  etheric worlds were formed;  and finally in the etheric worlds,  prakritic globes like the earth were formed.  The earth is the  centre of a prakritic globe, revolving in ether around the sun.  The sun is the centre of a solar globe of ether, revolving in  prana around Alcyone.  Alcyone is the centre of a stellar globe  of prana revolving in manasa around the central and hidden sun of  the great manasic globe.  These four conditions of matter  prakriti, ether, prana, and manasa are the earth, water, fire,  air of the Ancient Metaphysics, the four elements of matter, and  are present in every atom of prakriti.  When the atom of prana  was formed, it had an envelope of manasa.  When the atom of ether  was formed it had an envelope of pranic-manasic atoms.  When the  prakritic atom was formed it had an envelope of etheric-pranic-  manasic atoms, each of its encircling etheric atoms being the  centre of a pranic molecule, and each pranic atom of that  molecule being the centre of a manasic molecule.    Each atom of prakriti was the material universe in miniature.  It  held the potentialities of mind, life, and phenomena.  In every  aggregation of atoms, there were the four planes, each in touch  through the Cosmic Mind, its manasa, with other atoms in the  universe, with every other globe of whatever kind.  \"As above, so  below,\" was the secret Key-word.  The unity of all the material  universe in its prakriti, ether, prana and manasa, was the corner  stone of this knowledge.  The three planes above prakriti were  called Astral, and in common speech there was the ordinary  division into two planes, visible and invisible, or \"Spirit,\" as  the invisible was called, and \"Matter,\" as the visible was  called.  Only in the hidden secret doctrine of physics, and in  the open metaphysics which were a \"stumbling block\" and  \"foolishness\" to those who had not the \"inner light\" of the  physics, were the three divisions of the \"astral\" made known, and  the true distinction between the spirit of the three higher  planes and the matter of the four lower was kept out of the  metaphysics, or only vaguely alluded to.    There is no \"oriental science\" because the oriental does not  attach the same value to merely physical knowledge that we do.  But that must not be understood to imply that there is no  oriental physics.  In all the matters that interest us now, as  far as principles are concerned, the oriental knew all that we  know.  He knew it thousands of years ago, when our ancestors were  sleeping with the cave bears.    \"That is all the good it did him,\" the scientist says.  No.  That  is not true.  It is perfectly true that the oriental, the  Babylonian who carved on the Black Stone now in the British  Museum the five moons of Jupiter, exposing himself to the  derision of our astronomers prior to their own discovery of the  fifth moon in 1898, did not care particularly whether there were  four moons or five, and had no sale for any telescopes he might  make, for no one else cared particularly.  But it was not true  that he did not care for any and all knowledge that would improve  his spiritual condition by giving him correct ideas of the  universe and of his own part in it.  To him life was more than  meat and the body more than raiment.  He was more afraid of sin  than of ignorance.  We are more afraid of ignorance than of sin.  He preferred to better men's moral condition;  we prefer to  better their physical condition.    If one of the Sages of the East could be called up and put on the  stand to be questioned, he would say, substantially:    \"You are right in regard to your ether, and to prakriti being  ether that has been dropped a great octave in vibration.  Your  physical atom is surrounded by a molecule of ether, this molecule  containing many atoms of ether.  The chording vibration does  produce all physical phenomena.    \"But where did the ether atom come from?  How can you explain how  and whence life comes, or what it is?  This explains physical,  but how do you explain vital phenomena?    \"You are wrong in assuming that all the matter of the universe  apart from the earth or planets is ether and only ether.  The  etheric world in which you are interested ends with your solar  system.  It ends with each solar system, to the people of that  system.  Between each solar system and another there is another  form of matter that is not ether.    \"This etheric solar world of ours is very large,"]]]
