Attacked by a fatal disease, the life of  Nancy Hanks wasted slowly away. Day after day her son sat by her bed  reading to her such portions of the Bible as she desired to hear. At  intervals she talked to him, urging him to walk in the paths of honor,  goodness, and truth. At last she found rest, and her son gave way to  grief that could not be controlled. In an opening in the timber, a short  distance from the cabin, sympathizing friends and neighbors laid her  body away and offered sincere prayers above her grave. The simple  service did not seem to the son adequate tribute to the memory of the  beloved mother whose loss he so sorely felt, but no minister could be  procured at the time to preach a funeral sermon. In the spring, however,  Abraham Lincoln, then a lad of ten, wrote to Elder Elkin, who had lived  near them in Kentucky, begging that he would come and preach a sermon  above his mother's grave, and adding that by granting this request he  would confer a lasting favor upon his father, his sister, and himself.  Although it involved a journey of more than a hundred miles on  horseback, the good man cheerfully complied. Once more the neighbors and  friends gathered about the grave of Nancy Hanks, and her son found  comfort in their sympathy and their presence. The spot where Lincoln's  mother lies is now enclosed within a high iron fence. At the head of the  grave a white stone, simple, unaffected, and in keeping with the  surroundings, has been placed. It bears the following inscription:        NANCY HANKS LINCOLN,      MOTHER OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN,      DIED OCTOBER 5, A.D. 1818.      AGED THIRTY-FIVE YEARS.      _Erected by a friend of her martyred son_.    Lincoln always held the memory of his mother in the deepest reverence  and affection. Says Dr. J.G. Holland: \"Long after her sensitive heart  and weary hands had crumbled into dust, and had climbed to life again in  forest flowers, he said to a friend, with tears in his eyes, 'All that I  am or ever hope to be I owe to my sainted mother.'\"    The vacant place of wife and mother was sadly felt in the Lincoln cabin,  but before the year 1819 had closed it was filled by a woman who nobly  performed the duties of her trying position. Thomas Lincoln had known  Mrs. Sarah Johnston when both were young and living in Elizabethtown,  Kentucky. They had married in the same year; and now, being alike  bereaved, he persuaded her to unite their broken households into one.    By this union, a son and two daughters, John, Sarah, and Matilda, were  added to the Lincoln family. All dwelt together in perfect harmony, the  mother showing no difference in the treatment of her own children and  the two now committed to her charge. She exhibited a special fondness  for the little Abraham, whose precocious talents and enduring qualities  she was quick to apprehend. Though he never forgot the \"angel mother\"  sleeping on the forest-covered hill-top, the boy rewarded with a  profound and lasting affection the devoted care of her who proved a  faithful friend and helper during the rest of his childhood and youth.  In her later life the step-mother spoke of him always with the tenderest  feeling. On one occasion she said: \"He never gave me a cross word or  look, and never refused, in fact or appearance, to do anything I  requested of him.\"    The child had enjoyed a little irregular schooling while living in  Kentucky, getting what instruction was possible of one Zachariah Birney,  a Catholic, who taught for a time close by his father's house. He also  attended, as convenience permitted, a school kept by Caleb Hazel, nearly  four miles away, walking the distance back and forth with his sister.  Soon after coming under the care of his step-mother, the lad was  afforded some similar opportunities for learning. His first master in  Indiana was Azel Dorsey. The sort of education dispensed by him, and the  circumstances under which it was given, are described by Mr. Ward H.  Lamon, at one time Lincoln's law-partner at Springfield, Illinois. \"Azel  Dorsey presided in a small house near the Little Pigeon Creek  meeting-house, a mile and a half from the Lincoln cabin. It was built of  unhewn logs, and had holes for windows, in which greased paper served  for glass. The roof was just high enough for a man to stand erect. Here  the boy was taught reading, writing, and ciphering. They spelt in  classes, and 'trapped' up and down. These juvenile contests were very  exciting to the participants, and it is said by the survivors that Abe  was even then the equal, if not the superior, of any scholar in his  class. The next teacher was Andrew Crawford. Mrs. Gentry says he began  teaching in the neighborhood in the winter of 1822-3. Crawford 'kept  school' in the same little school-house which had been the scene of  Dorsey's labors, and the windows were still adorned with the greased  leaves of old copybooks that had come down from Dorsey's time. Abe was  now in his fifteenth year, and began to exhibit symptoms of gallantry  toward the other sex. He was growing at a tremendous rate, and two years  later attained his full height of six feet and four inches. He wore low  shoes, buckskin breeches, linsey-woolsey shirt, and a cap made of the  skin of a 'possum or a coon. The breeches clung close to his thighs and  legs, and failed by a large space to meet the tops of his shoes. He  would always come to school thus, good-humoredly and laughing. He was  always in good health, never sick, had an excellent constitution and  took care of it.\"    Crawford taught \"manners\"--a feature of backwoods education to which  Dorsey had not aspired. Crawford had doubtless introduced it as a  refinement which would put to shame the humble efforts of his  predecessor. One of the scholars was required to retire, and then to  re-enter the room as a polite gentleman is supposed to enter a  drawing-room. He was received at the door by another scholar and  conducted from bench to bench until he had been introduced to all the  young ladies and gentlemen in the room. Lincoln went through the ordeal  countless times. If he took a serious view of the performance it must  have put him to exquisite torture, for he was conscious that he was not  a perfect type of manly beauty. If, however, it struck him as at all  funny, it must have filled him with unspeakable mirth to be thus gravely  led about, angular and gawky, under the eyes of the precise Crawford, to  be introduced to the boys and girls of his acquaintance.    While in Crawford's school the lad wrote his first compositions. The  exercise was not required by the teacher, but, as Nat Grigsby has said,  \"he took it up on his own account.\" At first he wrote only short  sentences against cruelty to animals, but at last came forward with a  regular composition on the subject. He was annoyed and pained by the  conduct of the boys who were in the habit of catching terrapins and  putting coals of fire on their backs. \"He would chide us,\" says Grigsby,  \"tell us it was wrong, and would write against it.\"    One who has had the privilege of looking over some of the boyish  possessions of Lincoln says: \"Among the most touching relics which I saw  was an old copy-book in which, at the age of fourteen, Lincoln had  taught himself to write and cipher. Scratched in his boyish hand on the  first page were these lines:        _Abraham Lincoln      his hand and pen.      he will be good but      god knows When_\"    The boy's thirst for learning was not to be satisfied with the meagre  knowledge furnished in the miserable schools he was able to attend at  long intervals. His step-mother says: \"He read diligently. He read  everything he could lay his hands on, and when he came across a passage  that struck him he would write it down on boards, if he had no paper,  and keep it until he had got paper. Then he would copy it, look at it,  commit it to memory, and repeat it. He kept a scrap-book into which he  copied everything which particularly pleased him.\" Mr. Arnold further  states: \"There were no libraries and but few books in the back  settlements in which Lincoln lived. If by chance he heard of a book that  he had not read he would walk miles to borrow it. Among other volumes  borrowed from Crawford was Weems's Life of Washington. He read it with  great earnestness. He took it to bed with him in the loft and read till  his 'nubbin' of candle burned out. Then he placed the book between the  logs of the cabin, that it might be near as soon as it was light enough  in the morning to read. In the night a heavy rain came up and he awoke  to find his book wet through and through. Drying it as well as he could,  he went to Crawford and told him of the mishap. As he had no money to  pay for the injured book, he offered to work out the value of it.  Crawford fixed the price at three days' work, and the future President  pulled corn for three days, thus becoming owner of the coveted volume.\"  In addition to this, he was fortunate enough to get hold of AEsop's  Fables, Pilgrim's Progress, and the lives of Benjamin Franklin and Henry  Clay. He made these books his own by conning them over and over, copying  the more impressive portions until they were firmly fixed in his memory.  Commenting upon the value of this sort of mental training, Dr. Holland  wisely remarks: \"Those who have witnessed the dissipating effect of many  books upon the minds of modern children do not find it hard to believe  that Abraham Lincoln's poverty of books was the wealth of his life. The  few he had did much to perfect the teaching which his mother had begun,  and to form a character which for quaint simplicity, earnestness,  truthfulness, and purity, has never been surpassed among the historic  personages of the world.\"    It may well have been that Lincoln's lack of books and the"]]]
