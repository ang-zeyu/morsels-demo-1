Other amulets, like the  so-called _Ushabtiu_, were to meet special conditions of the  other world.  These _Ushabtiu_, or \"answerers,\" were little images  of workmen bearing agricultural implements whose duty it was to  take the place of the dead in the fields of Earu when Osiris as  king called him to do his share of the field work.  Even the king  appears liable to this service, and for him thousands of these  figures were made,--sometimes labeled each with the day of the  year.  In a few cases there was even a charm written on the figure  to prevent it hearing the command of any one but its master.    Alongside these manifold manifestations of the belief in magic,  other furniture--implements, weapons, and utensils--are still  placed in the grave.  The offering places are still maintained.  All burials are now extended on the back and wrapped in bandages.  Yet the common graves lack the receptacles for the viscera, lack  magical texts, lack ushabtiu, and--in a word--lack all those  things which are typical of the better-class graves of the  period.  The conception of the future life among the common people  is apparently not essentially different from that of the Old  Empire.  But the books of the dead and the offering formulas show  that the priests and high officials at death were called Osiris.    By the end of the Late Period the Osiris cult of the dead had  come to be universal.  No doubt political events had much to do  with this.  The absorption of the powers of the king by the  priesthood of the national god Amon-Ra, the crushing of the  nobility by a succession of foreign invaders, and the general  uncertainty of life, had disturbed the old fixed relations.  The  hope of every Egyptian turned to a glorified future life as  Osiris.    The tendency to use magical texts and symbolic objects reached  its height.  About 700 B.C. a revival of national life, brought  about by the establishment of the Egyptian kings of Sais as kings  of Egypt, led to a renaissance of Egyptian art.  The old monuments  were copied and imitated, the old funerary texts and offering  formulas were sought out in the older graves.  Even the pyramid  texts reappear after one thousand years of practical oblivion.  The value of master words was so firmly fixed in the Egyptian  mind that misunderstood texts of all sorts were copied out and  placed in the graves to secure to the dead some vague benefit in  the other world.    The process of mummification was at its height.  The bodies were  no longer preserved.  The process was merely the creation of a  simulacrum of the dead Osiris So-and-So.  All the perishable parts  of the body were removed or destroyed by chemicals.  Only the  skin, bones, hair, and teeth remained to be padded with mud and  resin, wrapped in cloths, covered with a painted and gilded  _cartonnage_ to represent the glorified Osiris mummy.          VIII. THE PTOLEMAIC-ROMAN PERIOD      In the Ptolemaic-Roman period we see the final stage of the  Osiris cult.  Every dead man is laid in his grave without  furniture, prepared as a simulacrum of Osiris.  The wealthiest  people have gilded and painted mummy cases with amulets and  funerary papyrus.  The poorer are merely bundles of wrappings.  Every dead man is Osiris, and no doubt carried with him words  learned on earth to gain his way to a place in the kingdom of  Osiris.  The offering places above the grave are still made and  offerings are still brought.    To gain some idea of the way in which these two conceptions of  the living dead were worked out in actual life, one has only to  turn to the funerary customs of the modern Egyptians.  In the case  of both Christians and Moslems, the grave rites are similar; but  with those of the Moslems I am more familiar.  The grave consists  still of the two parts, the burying place and the offering place.  The swathed body is laid on the right side, with the right hand  under the cheek and the face towards Mecca.  At the burial the  confession of the faith is recited over and over, lest the dead  forget it.    Korans are sometimes placed in the graves; and I have even seen a  confession of the faith written on paper and placed on a twig  before the face of the dead.  At the appointed seasons--  especially at the great Feast of Sacrifice--offerings are  brought to the grave.  The family party passes through the  cemetery, the women bearing baskets of bread and bottles of  water, the men turning the head to the right and to the left and  reciting the _fatha_ in propitiation of the spirits.  The party  enters the offering inclosure of the grave of their relative.  The  wives greet the dead--\"Peace unto thee, oh, my husband, oh, my  father, we have wept until we have watered the earth with our  tears on thy account.\" The offerings are laid before the tomb.  A  scribe is called and recites or reads some chapter of the Koran  over and over, one hundred, one hundred and fifty, five hundred,  one thousand times, and concludes: \"I have read this for thee,  oh, such and such a one.\" Or, \"I have transferred the merit of  this to thee.\" When you question these people as to the  particulars of their belief, you find their ideas vague and  indefinite.  Among the men a dispute quickly starts,--the people  who have been found good by the examining angels on the night of  the burial are there, but the bad are somewhere else.  No, says  another, they are all in their graves, but the bad suffer  torment.  Still another maintains that the good have already  passed to the lowest heaven.  These are all mere remnants of  theological discussions caught from the sheikhs.  The women  stolidly maintain that the dead are in their tombs and the  offerings must be brought.  When you inquire which are the good  and which are the bad, there is again a great divergence of  opinion; but it is clear that every man believes in his heart  that a knowledge of the prayers and forms of the Moslem religion  is absolutely essential and entirely sufficient to gain a  desirable future life.  The great master word is the confession of  faith--there is no god but Allah and Mohammed is his prophet.    So it must have been in the last stage of the Osiris cult.  Immortality, a glorified future existence as an Osiris in the  kingdom of Osiris, with all the pleasures and comforts of life,  was secured to him who was buried with the proper rites and knew  the magic words.  And yet the old feeling was never lost that the  dead was somehow in the grave and might suffer hunger and thirst.    When Christianity came into Egypt, all the gaudy apparatus of the  Osiris religion was swept out of existence.  The body was to rise  again and might not be mutilated.  Mummification, which destroyed  the body in order to preserve a conventional simulacrum, ceased  abruptly.  Grave furniture was of course unthinkable.  But the use  of charms did not cease.  Crosses were embroidered in the  gravecloths; or small crosses of metal or wood placed on the  breast or arm; the gravestone bore a simple prayer to the Holy  Spirit for the peaceful rest of the soul.  But the offering place  was still maintained; prayers were recited on the feast days;  lamps were allowed to remain at the grave; food was brought, but  given to the poor.    In all periods there are thousands of graves of poor people  without a single thing to secure their future life,--people who  were probably content simply to lay down the burdens of life.  In  the Christian period these thousands of unnamed dead all have one  mark.  They are laid with their feet to the east.  Each one was a  Christian and secure in his future life, according to his faith  and his life on earth.          IX. SUMMARY      To sum up, the essential idea of the Egyptian conception of  immortality was that the ghost or spirit of the man preserved the  personality and the form of the man in the existence after death;  that this spirit had the same desires, the same pleasures, the  same necessities, and the same fears as on earth.  Life after  death was a duplicate of life on earth.  On earth life depended on  work, on getting food from the fields and the herds, on forming  stone and metal, hide and vegetable fibre, into useful objects.  In other words, life depended on human power over the natural  materials of the earth.  At the same time there were many things  which could not be controlled by power over the earth and its  elements,--the sting of the scorpion, the bite of the adder,  the rise of the Nile, sickness, the sudden onslaught of the  enemy, the straying of cattle, the disfavor of the god.  For these  evils man's only hope was magic,--the set words spoken in the  proper manner which have power over all unseen influence.  So in  the case of life after death, all which human strength can  provide of stores of grain and drink and garments must be secured  for his use; but he must also be provided with the magic words to  meet the chance evils of the future life.    It is not surprising that the unknown future presented to the  imagination many evils unknown on earth.  The spirit might forget  its name, it might lose its heart, it might be bound fast by evil  powers in the grave and unable to come forth by day.  The mummy  might decay; the spirit might forget its form.  So, as time went  on, the use of magic words became of greater and greater  importance, until, to modern eyes, it seemed to overshadow all  else in the Egyptian conception of life after death.    As a part of the magical provisions of the dead, the Osiris myth,  probably built up in explanation of old rites, was drawn into the  belief in a future life, and apparently at the beginning _solely  for the benefit of the king_, for the benefit of those who  claimed a certain divinity on earth.  The earth-god Osiris, god of  the living, had died and had been brought to life as god of the  dead.  So, also, the earth-king, the Horus, the son of Ra, must  die,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12259"],[0,"Memoirs of a Cavalier (#6)"],[1," stout fellows indeed. Here I saw the cardinal; there was an air of  church gravity in his habit, but all the vigour of a general, and  the sprightliness of a vast genius in his face. He affected a little  stiffness in his behaviour, but managed all his affairs with such  clearness, such steadiness, and such application, that it was no  wonder he had such success in every undertaking.    Here I saw the king, whose figure was mean, his countenance hollow,  and always seemed dejected, and every way discovering that weakness in  his countenance that appeared in his actions.    If he was ever sprightly and vigorous it was when the cardinal was  with him, for he depended so much on everything he did, he that was at  the utmost dilemma when he was absent, always timorous, jealous, and  irresolute.    After the review the cardinal was absent some days, having been to  wait on the queen-mother at Lyons, where, as it was discoursed, they  were at least seemingly reconciled.    I observed while the cardinal was gone there was no court, the king  was seldom to be seen, very small attendance given, and no bustle at  the castle; but as soon as the cardinal returned, the great councils  were assembled, the coaches of the ambassadors went every day to the  castle, and a face of business appeared upon the whole court.    Here the measures of the Duke of Savoy's ruin were concerted, and in  order to it the king and the cardinal put themselves at the head  of the army, with which they immediately reduced all Savoy, took  Chamberri and the whole duchy except Montmelian.    The army that did this was not above 22,000 men, including the Swiss,  and but indifferent troops neither, especially the French foot, who,  compared to the infantry I have since seen in the German and Swedish  armies, were not fit to be called soldiers. On the other hand,  considering the Savoyards and Italian troops, they were good troops;  but the cardinal's conduct made amends for all these deficiencies.    From hence I went to Pignerol, which was then little more than a  single fortification on the hill near the town called St Bride's, but  the situation of that was very strong. I mention this because of the  prodigious works since added to it, by which it has since obtained the  name of \"the right hand of France.\" They had begun a new line below  the hill, and some works were marked out on the side of the town next  the fort; but the cardinal afterwards drew the plan of the works with  his own hand, by which it was made one of the strongest fortresses in  Europe.    While I was at Pignerol, the governor of Milan, for the Spaniards,  came with an army and sat down before Casale. The grand quarrel,  and for which the war in this part of Italy was begun, was this: The  Spaniards and Germans pretended to the duchy of Mantua; the Duke  of Nevers, a Frenchman, had not only a title to it, but had got  possession of it; but being ill-supported by the French, was beaten  out by the Imperialists, and after a long siege the Germans took  Mantua itself, and drove the poor duke quite out of the country.    The taking of Mantua elevated the spirits of the Duke of Savoy, and  the Germans and Spaniards being now at more leisure, with a complete  army came to his assistance, and formed the siege of Montferrat.    For as the Spaniards pushed the Duke of Mantua, so the French by  way of diversion lay hard upon the Duke of Savoy. They had seized  Montferrat, and held it for the Duke of Mantua, and had a strong  French garrison under Thoiras, a brave and experienced commander; and  thus affairs stood when we came into the French army.    I had no business there as a soldier, but having passed as a Scotch  gentleman with the mob at Lyons, and after with her Majesty the  queen-mother, when we obtained the guard of her dragoons, we had also  her Majesty's pass, with which we came and went where we pleased. And  the cardinal, who was then not on very good terms with the queen, but  willing to keep smooth water there, when two or three times our passes  came to be examined, showed a more than ordinary respect to us on that  very account, our passes being from the queen.    Casale being besieged, as I have observed, began to be in danger, for  the cardinal, who 'twas thought had formed a design to ruin Savoy, was  more intent upon that than upon the succour of the Duke of Mantua; but  necessity calling upon him to deliver so great a captain as Thoiras,  and not to let such a place as Casale fall into the hands of the  enemy, the king, or cardinal rather, ordered the Duke of Montmorency,  and the Marechal D'Effiat, with 10,000 foot and 2000 horse, to march  and join the Marechals De La Force and Schomberg, who lay already with  an army on the frontiers of Genoa, but too weak to attempt the raising  the siege of Casale.    As all men thought there would be a battle between the French and the  Spaniards, I could not prevail with myself to lose the opportunity,  and therefore by the help of the passes above mentioned, I came to  the French army under the Duke of Montmorency. We marched through the  enemy's country with great boldness and no small hazard, for the Duke  of Savoy appeared frequently with great bodies of horse on the rear of  the army, and frequently skirmished with our troops, in one of which  I had the folly--I can call it no better, for I had no business  there--to go out and see the sport, as the French gentlemen called it.  I was but a raw soldier, and did not like the sport at all, for this  party was surrounded by the Duke of Savoy, and almost all killed, for  as to quarter they neither asked nor gave. I ran away very fairly,  one of the first, and my companion with me, and by the goodness of our  horses got out of the fray, and being not much known in the army, we  came into the camp an hour or two after, as if we had been only riding  abroad for the air.    This little rout made the general very cautious, for the Savoyards  were stronger in horse by three or four thousand, and the army always  marched in a body, and kept their parties in or very near hand.    I escaped another rub in this French army about five days after, which  had like to have made me pay dear for my curiosity.    The Duke de Montmorency and the Marechal Schomberg joined their army  about four or five days after, and immediately, according to the  cardinal's instructions, put themselves on the march for the relief of  Casale.    The army had marched over a great plain, with some marshy grounds  on the right and the Po on the left, and as the country was so well  discovered that 'twas thought impossible any mischief should happen,  the generals observed the less caution. At the end of this plain was a  long wood and a lane or narrow defile through the middle of it.    Through this pass the army was to march, and the van began to file  through it about four o'clock. By three hours' time all the army was  got through, or into the pass, and the artillery was just entered  when the Duke of Savoy with 4000 horse and 1500 dragoons with every  horseman a footman behind him, whether he had swam the Po or passed it  above at a bridge, and made a long march after, was not examined, but  he came boldly up the plain and charged our rear with a great deal of  fury.    Our artillery was in the lane, and as it was impossible to turn them  about and make way for the army, so the rear was obliged to support  themselves and maintain the fight for above an hour and a half.    In this time we lost abundance of men, and if it had not been for two  accidents all that line had been cut off. One was, that the wood was  so near that those regiments which were disordered presently sheltered  themselves in the wood; the other was, that by this time the Marechal  Schomberg, with the horse of the van, began to get back through the  lane, and to make good the ground from whence the other had been  beaten, till at last by this means it came to almost a pitched battle.    There were two regiments of French dragoons who did excellent service  in this action, and maintained their ground till they were almost all  killed.    Had the Duke of Savoy contented himself with the defeat of five  regiments on the right, which he quite broke and drove into the wood,  and with the slaughter and havoc which he had made among the rest,  he had come off with honour, and might have called it a victory; but  endeavouring to break the whole party and carry off some cannon, the  obstinate resistance of these few dragoons lost him his advantages,  and held him in play till so many fresh troops got through the pass  again as made us too strong for him, and had not night parted them he  had been entirely defeated.    At last, finding our troops increase and spread themselves on his  flank, he retired and gave over. We had no great stomach to pursue him  neither, though some horse were ordered to follow a little way.    The duke lost about a thousand men, and we almost twice as many, and  but for those dragoons had lost the whole rear-guard and half our  cannon. I was in a very sorry case in this action too. I was with the  rear in the regiment of horse of Perigoort, with a captain of which  regiment I had contracted some acquaintance. I would have rid off at  first, as the captain desired me, but there was no doing it, for the  cannon was in the lane, and the horse and dragoons of the van eagerly  pressing back through the lane must have run me down or carried me  with them. As for the wood, it was a good shelter to save one's life,  but was so thick there was no passing it on horseback.    Our regiment was one of the first that was broke, and being all in  confusion, with the Duke of Savoy's men at our heels, away we ran into  the wood. Never was there so much disorder among a parcel of runaways  as when we came to this wood; it was so exceeding bushy and thick at  the bottom there was no entering it, and a volley of small shot from  a regiment"]]]
