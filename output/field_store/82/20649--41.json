It bore W.  1/2 deg. N., ten or eleven leagues; but the coast line between it and the north  head of Bustard Bay, seemed to be much broken.    [* A cluster of low islands, about fifteen leagues from the coast, was  seen in the following year by Mr. Bunker, commander of the Albion, south  whaler. He described the cluster to be of considerable extent, and as  lying in latitude 233/4 deg., and longitude about 1521/2 deg.; or nearly a degree to  the eastward of the low isle above mentioned. It is probably to these  islands, whose existence captain Cook suspected, that the great flights  of boobies he saw in Hervey's Bay retire at night.]    In the afternoon, a breeze from the north-westward enabled us to stretch  in for the land; and we anchored soon after sunset in 10 fathoms, brown  sand, five or six miles from a projection which received the name of  _Gatcombe Head_; and to the southward of it there was a rather deep bight  in the coast. The bearings of the land, taken a few minutes before  anchoring, were as under.      North head of Bustard Bay, dist. 5 leagues, S. 56 deg. E.  Gatcombe Head,                              S. 86  W.  Mount Larcom,                               N. 80  W.  Northern extreme of the coast,              N. 46  W.      The chain of hills which rises near Bustard Bay, was seen to stretch  westward a few miles behind the shore, till it was lost at the back of  Mount Larcom. These hills were not destitute of wood, but they had a  barren appearance; and the coast was more rocky than sandy. At this  anchorage, the flood tide came from the north-by-east, and the ebb set  east, half a mile per hour.    [EAST COAST. PORT CURTIS.]    THURSDAY 5 AUGUST 1802    At daylight of the 5th, we closed in with the shore, steering  north-westward; and at nine o'clock a small opening was discovered, and  water seen over the low front land. The Lady Nelson was ordered to look  for anchorage; and at eleven we came to, in 4 fathoms brown sand, one  mile from the east point of the opening; and the following bearings were  then taken:      Southern extreme of the coast, over the east point,       S. 36 deg. E.  Rocky islet in the middle of the opening, dist. 11/2 mile, S.  28  W.  Mount Larcom,                                             S. 75  W.  Hummock at the northern extreme (C. Capricorn),           N. 18  W.      The opening was not so much as a mile in width, but from the extent of  water within, it was conjectured to have a communication with the bight  on the south side of Gatcombe Head; and this being an object worthy of  examination, the sails were furled and the boats hoisted out. The  naturalist and his companions landed at the west side of the entrance,  where some Indians had assembled to look at the ship; but they retired on  the approach of our gentlemen, and afterwards taking the advantage of a  hillock, began to throw stones at the party; nor would they desist until  two or three muskets were fired over their heads, when they disappeared.  There were seven bark canoes lying on the shore, and near them hung upon  a tree some parts of a turtle; and scoop nets, such as those of Hervey's  Bay, were also seen.    I proceeded up the opening in a boat, and lieutenant Murray got under way  to follow with the brig; but the tide ran up so rapidly, over a bottom  which was rocky and very irregular in depth, that he anchored almost  immediately, and came to the middle islet where I was taking angles. We  then went over to the west shore, and ascended a hill called in the  chart, _Hill View_; from whence it was evident, that this water did  certainly communicate with the bight round Gatcombe Head, and by an  opening much more considerable than that in which the vessels were  anchored; the port was also seen to extend far to the westward, and I was  induced to form a regular plan for its examination. The northern entrance  being too full of rocks and shoals for the Lady Nelson to pass, although  drawing no more than six feet when the keels were hoisted up, Mr. Murray  was desired to go round to the southern opening; and about sunset he got  under way.    FRIDAY 6 AUGUST 1802    Early in the morning I went off in the whale boat, with two days  provisions, and made nearly a straight course up the port, for a low  point on the south shore called _South-trees Point_. The water was very  shallow, with many rocks and dry banks, until the southern entrance was  fairly open, when the depth varied between 7 and 3 fathoms; but there was  from 6 to 8 close to the low point. This forms the inner part of the  southern entrance, and Gatcombe Head, the outer part, lies from it S. 64 deg.  E. about four miles; from the head southward, however, the width of the  channel is much less, being contracted by banks which extend out from the  opposite shore.    Seeing nothing of the brig, I proceeded in the examination, steering  westward for a small island four or five miles up the port. This is the  southernmost of six islets, lying behind the point of Hill View, and from  one of two hillocks upon it, another set of bearings was taken. The depth  of water thus far, had varied from 8 fathoms, to six feet upon a middle  shoal; after which it deepened to 3, 4, and 7 fathoms, and there was 10  close to the southern islet. The Lady Nelson made her appearance off  Gatcombe Head about noon; but not waiting for her, I went to a point on  the northern shore, near two miles higher up, where the water was so deep  that a ship might make fast to the rocks and trees: the soundings were  very irregular from the southern islet, but the least depth was 5  fathoms.    The port was here contracted to one mile in width; but it opened out  higher up, and taking a more northern direction, assumed the form of a  river. In steering across to the western shore, I carried from 8 to 4,  and afterwards from 6 to 2 fathoms; when turning northward for two islets  covered with mangroves, the depth increased again to 7 fathoms. We tried  to land upon a third islet, it being then sunset; but a surrounding bank  of soft mud making the islet inaccessible, we rowed on upwards, and  landed with difficulty on the west shore before it became quite dark. The  breadth of the stream here was about a mile; and the greatest depth 6  fathoms at low water.    SATURDAY 7 AUGUST 1802    In the morning, a small opening was observed in the opposite, eastern  shore; but reserving this for examination in returning, I proceeded  upwards with a fair wind, five miles further, when the greatest depth any  where to be found was 3 fathoms. The stream then divided into two arms;  the largest, about one mile in breadth, continuing its direction to the  N. W. by N., and apparently ending a little further up; the other running  westward, but the greater part of both occupied by shallow water and mud  banks. Upon the point of separation, which is insulated at high water,  there were some low, reddish cliffs, the second observed on the west  shore; and from thence I set Mount Larcom at S. 15 deg. 15' W., distant seven  or eight miles.    This station was nine miles above the steep point, where the port is  first contracted, and the steep point is ten from Gatcombe Head; and  conceiving it could answer no essentially useful purpose to pursue the  examination where a ship could not go, I returned to the small opening in  the eastern shore, opposite to where we had passed the night. There was 4  fathoms in the entrance of this little branch; but it presently became  shallow, and I landed to ascend a hill which had but little wood at the  top. The sea was visible from thence; and the ship at the northern  entrance of the port was set at N. 891/2 deg. E, and Mount Larcom S. 591/2 deg. W.  The small, mangrove islets below this branch, were passed on the east  side in our way down, there being a narrow channel with from 3 to 5  fathoms in it, close past two trees standing alone in the water; and at  sunset we got on board the brig, lying at anchor off South-trees Point.    Lieutenant Murray had found some difficulty in getting into the southern  entrance, from a shoal which lay to the S. E. by E., one mile and a half  from Gatcombe Head. He passed on the north side of the shoal, and brought  deep water as far as South-trees Point; but in steering onward, in  mid-channel, had met with other banks, and was obliged to anchor. I  desired Mr. Murray to ascertain as he went out, whether there were any  channel on the south side of the shoal near Gatcombe Head; and quitting  the brig next morning [SUNDAY 8 AUGUST 1802], I landed on the larger  island to the south of the point of Hill View, to take angles; and soon  after nine o'clock, reached the ship.    During my absence, the botanical gentlemen had been on shore every day,  lieutenant Flinders had made astronomical observations, and boats had  been employed, though unsuccessfully, in fishing. No Indians had been  seen on the east side of the port, and I therefore gave a part of the  ship's company leave this afternoon, to land there and divert themselves.  At eight in the evening a gun was heard in the offing; and by the  guidance of our light, the Lady Nelson returned to her anchorage four  hours afterward. Mr. Murray had struck upon a reef, having kept too near  the shore in the apprehension of missing the anchorage in the dark; but  his vessel did not appear to have sustained any other damage than the  main sliding keel being carried away.    As much time having been employed in the examination of this port as the  various objects I had in view could permit, we prepared to quit it on the  following morning. This part of the East Coast had been passed in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13127"],[0,"Observations on the Mussulmauns of India (#6)"],[1,"abaallah,[17] on the tenth day of the Arabian  month Mahurrum; the anniversary of which catastrophe is solemnized with  the most devoted zeal.    This brief sketch constitutes the origin of the festival; but I deem it  necessary to detail at some length the history of that period, which may  the better explain the motives assigned by the Mussulmauns, for the deep  grief exhibited every year, as the anniversary of Mahurrum returns to  these faithful followers of their martyred leaders, Hasan and Hosein, who,  with their devoted families, suffered innocently by the hands of the  guilty.    Yuzeed, the King of Shawm,[18] it appears, was the person in power,  amongst the followers of Mahumud, at that early period of Mussulmaun  history. Of the Soonie sect,[19] his hatred to the descendants of Mahumud  was of the most inveterate kind; jealousy, it is supposed, aided by a very  wicked heart, led him to desire the extirpation of the whole race,  particularly as he knew that, generally, the Mussulmaun people secretly  desired the immediate descendants of their Prophet to be their rulers.  They were, however, intimidated by Yuzeed's authority; whilst he, ever  fearing the possibility of the Syaads' restoration to their rights,  resolved, if possible, on sacrificing the whole family, to secure himself  in his illegal power.    Ali had been treacherously murdered through the contrivances of the  usurping Calipha; after his death, the whole family removed from Shawm,  the capital, to Medina, where they lived some years in tranquillity,  making many converts to their faith, and exercising themselves in the  service of God and virtuous living. Unostentatious in their habits and  manners, they enjoyed the affection of their neighbours, their own good  name increasing daily, to the utter dismay of their subtle enemy.    In the course of time, the devout people of Shawm, being heartily tired of  Yuzeed's tyrannical rule, and fearing the true faith would be defamed by  the excesses and abuses of power committed by him, they were desirous of  calling to their aid a leader from the Prophet's family, who would secure,  in its original purity, the performance of that religion which Mahumud had  taught. Some thousands of respectable Mussulmauns, it is related, signed a  petition to Hosein, requesting his immediate presence at Shawm, in order,  as the petition stated, 'that the religion his grandsire taught might be  supported and promoted'; and declaring 'the voluptuousness and infamy of  Yuzeed's life to be so offensive and glaring, that the true faith was  endangered by his vicious examples'; and entreating him to accept his  lawful rights as 'Emaum'[20] (Leader of the Faithful).    Hosein received the petition, but declined accepting the proposed  restitution of his family's rights at that time; yet he held out hopes in  his reply, that he might eventually listen to their entreaties, should he  be convinced his presence was essential to their welfare; and, as a  prelude to this, he sent his cousin Moslem,[21] on whom he could rely, to  make personal observation of the real state of things at Shawm; expecting  to learn, from his matured knowledge, the real causes of complaint, and  the wishes of the people, and by whose report he would be guided, as to  his final acceptance or rejection of the proposed measure for his becoming  their leader.    Moslem, accompanied by his two sons, mere youths, left Medina on this  important mission, and having accomplished the tedious march without  accident or interruption, he delivered Hosein's letters to those persons  of consequence in Shawm, who were at the head of the party petitioning his  appearance there, and who proffered their influence and support for the  recovery of the rights and privileges so long withheld from the  descendants of Mahumud.    Moslem was kindly greeted by them, and multitudes flocked to his quarters,  declaring Hosein the lawful leader of true Mussulmauns. Elated with these  flattering indications, he too promptly despatched his messengers to  Hosein, urging his immediate return to Shawm.    In the mean time, and long before the messengers could reach Medina,  Yuzeed, learning the state of things in the capital, was seriously alarmed  and greatly enraged; he issued orders for the seizure of Moslem and his  children, and desiring to have them brought to his presence, offered  immense sums of money for their capture. The friends of Moslem, however,  succeeded, for a time, in secreting his person from King Yuzeed's  emissaries, trusting the darkness of night would enable him to escape. But  the slaves and dependants of the tyrant being despatched into all quarters  of the city, Moslem's retreat was eventually discovered; and, through the  influence of a purse of gold, his person was given up to the King's  partizans.    The unfortunate agent of Hosein had confided the charge of his two sons to  the Kauzy[22] of the city, when the first report reached him of the tyrant  Yuzeed's fury. This faithful Kauzy, as the night advanced, intended to get  the poor boys conveyed to the halting place of a Kaarawaun,[23] which he  knew was but a few miles off, on their route for Medina. The guide, to  whom the youths were intrusted, either by design or mistake, took the  wrong road; and, after wandering through the dreary night, and suffering  many severe trials, they were taken prisoners by the cruel husband of a  very amiable female, who had compassionately, at first, given them shelter  as weary travellers only; but, on discovering whose children they were,  she had secreted them in her house. Her husband, however, having  discovered the place of their concealment, and identified them as the sons  of Moslem, cruelly murdered the innocent boys for the sake of the reward  offered for their heads. In his fury and thirst for gold, this wicked  husband of the kind-hearted woman spared not his own wife and son, who  strove by their united efforts, alternately pleading and resisting, to  save the poor boys from his barbarous hands.    This tragic event is conveyed into pathetic verse, and as often as it is  repeated in the families of the Mussulmauns, tears of fresh sympathy are  evinced, and bewailings renewed. This forms the subject for one day's  celebration during Mahurrum; the boys are described to have been most  beautiful in person, and amiable in disposition.    After enduring ignominy and torture, and without even being brought to  trial, Moslem was cast from a precipice, by Yuzeed's orders, and his life  speedily terminated, to glut the vengeance of the tyrant King.    As the disastrous conclusion of Moslem's mission had not reached the ear  of Hosein, he, elated with the favourable reception of his cousin, and the  prospect of being received at Shawm in peace and good will, had without  delay commenced his journey, accompanied by the females of his family, his  relations, and a few steady friends who had long devoted themselves to his  person and cause. The written documents of that remarkable period notice,  that the whole party of Hosein, travelling from Medina towards Shawm,  consisted only of seventy-two souls: Hosein having no intention to force  his way to the post of leader, had not deemed it necessary to set out with  an army to aid him, which he undoubtedly might have commanded by his  influence with the people professing 'the Faith'.    Yuzeed, in the mean time, having by his power destroyed Moslem and the two  youths his sons, and receiving positive intelligence that Hosein had  quitted Medina to march for Shawm, as his fears suggested, with an army of  some magnitude, he ordered out an immense force to meet Hosein on the way,  setting a price on his head, and proclaiming promises of honours and  rewards, of the most tempting nature, to the fortunate man who should  succeed in the arduous enterprise.    The first detachment of the Shawmies (as they are designated in the  manuscript of Arabia), under a resolute chief named Hurrh,[24] fell in  with Hosein's camp, one day's march beyond the far-famed ground, amongst  Mussulmauns, of Kraabaallah, or Hurth Maaree,[25] as it was originally  called.    Hurrh's heart was subdued when he entered the tent of the peaceable Hosein,  in whose person he discovered the exact resemblance of the Prophet; and  perceiving that his small camp indicated a quiet family party journeying  on their way, instead of the formidable force Yuzeed's fears had  anticipated, this chief was surprised and confounded, confessed his shame  to Hosein that he had been induced to accept the command of the force  despatched against the children of the Prophet, and urged, in mitigation  of his offences, that he had long been in Yuzeed's service, whose  commission he still bore; but his heart now yearning to aid, rather than  persecute the Prophet's family, he resolved on giving them an opportunity  to escape the threatened vengeance of their bitterest enemy. With this  view, he advised Hosein to fall with his party into the rear of his force,  until the main body of the Shawmies had passed by; and as they were then  on the margin of a forest, there to separate and secrete themselves till  the road was again clear, and afterwards to take a different route from  the proposed one to Shawm.    Hosein felt, as may be supposed, grateful to his preserver; and, following  his directions, succeeded in reaching the confines of Kraabaallah  unmolested.    The ancient writings of Arabia say, Mahumud had predicted the death of  Hosein, by the hands of men professing to be of 'the true faith', at this  very place Kraabaallah, or Hurth Maaree.    Hosein and his family having concluded their morning devotions, he first  inquired and learned the name of the place on which their tents were  pitched, and then imparted the subject of his last night's dream, 'that  his grandsire had appeared to him, and pronounced that his soul would be  at peace with him ere that day closed'."]]]
