And yet we say it need not be so. Beauty is lovely and ought to be  innocently possessed. It has charms which ought to be used for good  purposes. It is a delightful gift, which ought to be received with  gratitude and worn with grace and meekness. It should always minister  to inward beauty. Every woman of beautiful form and features should  cultivate a beautiful mind and heart.    5. RIVAL THE BOYS.--We want the girls to rival the boys in all that is  good, and refined, and ennobling. We want them to rival the boys, as  they well can, in learning, in understanding, in virtues; in all noble  qualities of mind and heart, but not in any of those things that have  caused them, justly or unjustly, to be described as savages. We  want the girls to be gentle--not weak, but gentle, and kind and  affectionate. We want to be sure, that wherever a girl is, there  should be a sweet, subduing and harmonizing influence of purity,  and truth, and love, pervading and hallowing, from center to  circumference, the entire circle in which she moves. If the boys are  savages, we want her to be their civilizer. We want her to tame them,  to subdue their ferocity, to soften their manners, and to teach them  all needful lessons of order, sobriety, and meekness, and patience and  goodness.    6. KINDNESS.--Kindness is the ornament of man--it is the chief glory  of woman--it is, indeed, woman's true prerogative--her sceptre and  her crown. It is the sword with which she conquers, and the charm with  which she captivates.    7. ADMIRED AND BELOVED.--Young lady, would you be admired and beloved?  Would you be an ornament to your sex, and a blessing to your race?  Cultivate this heavenly virtue. Wealth may surround you with its  blandishments, and beauty, and learning, or talents, may give you  admirers, but love and kindness alone can captivate the heart. Whether  you live in a cottage or a palace, these graces can surround you with  perpetual sunshine, making you, and all around you, happy.    8. INWARD GRACE.--Seek ye then, fair daughters, the possession of  that inward grace, whose essence shall permeate and vitalize the  affections, adorn the countenance make mellifluous the voice, and  impart a hallowed beauty even to your motions. Not merely that you  may be loved, would I urge this, but that you may, in truth, be  lovely--that loveliness which fades not with time, nor is marred or  alienated by disease, but which neither chance nor change can in any  way despoil.    9. SILKEN ENTICEMENTS OF THE STRANGER.--We urge you, gentle maiden, to  beware of the silken enticements of the stranger, until your love  is confirmed by protracted acquaintance. Shun the idler, though his  coffers overflow with pelf. Avoid the irreverent--the scoffer of  hallowed things; and him who \"looks upon the wine while it is red;\"  him too, \"who hath a high look and a proud heart,\" and who \"privily  slandereth his neighbor.\" Do not heed the specious prattle about  \"first love,\" and so place, irrevocably, the seal upon your future  destiny, before you have sounded, in silence and secrecy, the deep  fountains of your own heart. Wait, rather, until your own character  and that of him who would woo you, is more fully developed. Surely, if  this \"first love\" cannot endure a short probation, fortified by  \"the pleasures of hope,\" how can it be expected to survive years of  intimacy, scenes of trial, distracting cares, wasting sickness,  and all the homely routine of practical life? Yet it is these that  constitute life, and the love that cannot abide them is false and must  die.    [Illustration: ROMAN LADIES.]             *       *       *       *       *    INFLUENCE OF FEMALE CHARACTER.      1. MORAL EFFECT.--It is in its moral effect on the mind and the heart  of man, that the influence of woman is most powerful and important. In  the diversity of tastes, habits, inclinations, and pursuits of the two  sexes, is found a most beneficent provision for controlling the force  and extravagance of human passion. The objects which most strongly  seize and stimulate the mind of man, rarely act at the same time and  with equal power on the mind of woman. She is naturally better, purer,  and more chaste in thought and language.    2. FEMALE CHARACTER.--But the influence of female character on the  virtue of men, is not seen merely in restraining and softening the  violence of human passion. To her is mainly committed the task of  pouring into the opening mind of infancy its first impressions of  duty, and of stamping on its susceptible heart the first image of its  God. Who will not confess the influence of a mother in forming the  heart of a child? What man is there who can not trace the origin of  many of the best maxims of his life to the lips of her who gave him  birth? How wide, how lasting, how sacred is that part of a woman's  influence.    3. VIRTUE OF A COMMUNITY.--There is yet another mode by which woman  may exert a powerful influence on the virtue of a community. It rests  with her in a pre-eminent degree, to give tone and elevation to the  moral character of the age, by deciding the degree of virtue that  shall be necessary to afford a passport to her society. If all the  favor of woman were given only to the good, if it were known that the  charms and attractions of beauty and wisdom, and wit, were reserved  only for the pure; if, in one word, something of a similar rigor were  exerted to exclude the profligate and abandoned of society, as is  shown to those, who have fallen from virtue,--how much would be done  to re-enforce the motives to moral purity among us, and impress on the  minds of all a reverence for the sanctity and obligations of virtue.    4. THE INFLUENCE OF WOMAN ON THE MORAL SENTIMENTS.--The influence of  woman on the moral sentiments of society is intimately connected with  her influence on its religious character; for religion and a pure and  elevated morality must ever stand in the relation to each other of  effect and cause. The heart of a woman is formed for the abode of  sacred truth; and for the reasons alike honorable to her character and  to that of society. From the nature of humanity this must be so, or  the race would soon degenerate and moral contagion eat out the heart  of society. The purity of home is the safeguard to American manhood.    [Illustration]             *       *       *       *       *    PERSONAL PURITY.        \"Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,    These three alone lead life to sovereign power.\"--Tennyson      1. WORDS OF THE GREAT TEACHER.--Mark the words of the Great Teacher:  \"If thy right hand or foot cause thee to fall, cut it off and cast it  from thee. If thy right eye cause thee to fall, pluck it out. It is  better for thee to enter into life maimed and halt, than having two  eyes to be cast into hell-fire, where the worm dieth not, and the fire  is not quenched.\"    2. A MELANCHOLY FACT.--It is a melancholy fact in human experience,  that the noblest gifts which men possess are constantly prostituted  to other purposes than those for which they are designed. The most  valuable and useful organs of the body are those which are capable  of the greatest dishonor, abuse, and corruption. What a snare the  wonderful organism of the eye may become, when used to read corrupt  books, or to look upon licentious pictures, or vulgar theater scenes,  or when used to meet the fascinating gaze of the harlot! What an  instrument for depraving the whole man may be found in the matchless  powers of the brain, the hand, the mouth, or the tongue! What potent  instruments may these become in accomplishing the ruin of the whole  being, for time and eternity!    3. Abstinence.--Some can testify with thankfulness that they never  knew the sins of gambling, drunkenness, fornication, or adultery. In  all these cases abstinence has been, and continues to be, liberty.  Restraint is the noblest freedom. No man can affirm that self-denial  ever injured him; on the contrary, self-restraint has been liberty,  strength and blessing. Solemnly ask young men to remember this when  temptation and passion strive as a floodtide to move them from the  anchorage and peace of self-restraint. Beware of the deceitful stream  of temporary gratification, whose eddying current drifts towards  license, shame, disease and death. Remember how quickly moral power  declines, how rapidly the edge of the fatal maelstrom is reached, how  near the vortex, how terrible the penalty, how fearful the sentence of  everlasting punishment!    4. FRANK DISCUSSION.--The time has arrived for a full and frank  discussion of those things which affect the personal purity. Thousands  are suffering to-day from various weaknesses, the causes of which they  have never learned. Manly vigor is not increasing with that rapidity  which a Christian age demands. Means of dissipation are on the  increase. It is high time, therefore, that every lover of the  race should call a halt, and inquire into the condition of things.  Excessive modesty on this subject is not virtue. Timidity in  presenting unpleasant but important truths has permitted untold damage  in every age.    5. MAN IS A CARELESS BEING.--He is very much inclined to sinful  things. He more often does that which is wrong than that which is  right, because it is easier, and, for the moment, perhaps, more  satisfying to the flesh. The Creator is often blamed for man's  weaknesses and inconsistencies. This is wrong. God did not intend that  we should be mere machines, but free moral agents. We are privileged  to choose between good and evil. Hence, if we perseveringly choose  the latter, and make a miserable failure of life, we should blame only  ourselves.    6.

In short, the man of the desert tends  to simplify too much, and to take his first truth for the last truth.  And as it is with religion so it is with morality.  He who believes  in the existence of God believes in the equality of man.  And it has  been one of the merits of the Moslem faith that it felt men as men,  and was not incapable of welcoming men of many different races.  But here again it was so hard and crude that its very equality was  like a desert rather than a field.  Its very humanity was inhuman.    But though this human sentiment is rather rudimentary it is very real.  When a man in the desert meets another man, he is really  a man; the proverbial two-legged fowl without feathers.  He is an absolute and elementary shape, like the palm-tree  or the pyramid.  The discoverer does not pause to consider  through what gradations he may have been evolved from a camel.  When the man is a mere dot in the distance, the other man does  not shout at him and ask whether he had a university education,  or whether he is quite sure he is purely Teutonic and not Celtic  or Iberian.  A man is a man; and a man is a very important thing.  One thing redeems the Moslem morality which can be set over against  a mountain of crimes; a considerable deposit of common sense.  And the first fact of common sense is the common bond of men.  There is indeed in the Moslem character also a deep and most dangerous  potentiality of fanaticism of the menace of which something may be  said later.  Fanaticism sounds like the flat contrary of common sense;  yet curiously enough they are both sides of the same thing.  The fanatic of the desert is dangerous precisely because he does  take his faith as a fact, and not even as a truth in our more  transcendental sense.  When he does take up a mystical idea he takes  it as he takes the man or the palm-tree; that is, quite literally.  When he does distinguish somebody not as a man but as a Moslem,  then he divides the Moslem from the non-Moslem exactly as he divides  the man from the camel.  But even then he recognises the equality of men  in the sense of the equality of Moslems.  He does not, for instance,  complicate his conscience with any sham science about races.  In this he has something like an intellectual advantage over  the Jew, who is generally so much his intellectual superior;  and even in some ways his spiritual superior.  The Jew has far more  moral imagination and sympathy with the subtler ideals of the soul.  For instance, it is said that many Jews disbelieve in a future life;  but if they did believe in a future life, it would be something  more worthy of the genius of Isaiah and Spinoza.  The Moslem Paradise  is a very Earthly Paradise.  But with all their fine apprehensions,  the Jews suffer from one heavy calamity; that of being a Chosen Race.  It is the vice of any patriotism or religion depending on race  that the individual is himself the thing to be worshipped;  the individual is his own ideal, and even his own idol.  This fancy was fatal to the Germans; it is fatal to the Anglo-Saxons,  whenever any of them forswear the glorious name of Englishmen  and Americans to fall into that forlorn description.  This is not so when the nation is felt as a noble abstraction,  of which the individual is proud in the abstract.  A Frenchman is proud of France, and therefore may think himself  unworthy of France.  But a German is proud of being a German;  and he cannot be too unworthy to be a German when he is a German.  In short, mere family pride flatters every member of the family;  it produced the arrogance of the Germans, and it is capable of producing  a much subtler kind of arrogance in the Jews.  From this particular  sort of self-deception the more savage man of the desert is free.  If he is not considering somebody as a Moslem, he will consider  him as a man.  At the price of something like barbarism, he has  at least been saved from ethnology.    But here again the obvious is a limit as well as a light to him.  It does not permit, for instance, anything fine or subtle in  the sentiment of sex.  Islam asserts admirably the equality of men;  but it is the equality of males.  No one can deny that a noble  dignity is possible even to the poorest, who has seen the Arabs  coming in from the desert to the cities of Palestine or Egypt.  No one can deny that men whose rags are dropping off their backs can  bear themselves in a way befitting kings or prophets in the great  stories of Scripture.  No one can be surprised that so many fine  artists have delighted to draw such models on the spot, and to make  realistic studies for illustrations to the Old and New Testaments.  On the road to Cairo one may see twenty groups exactly like that  of the Holy Family in the pictures of the Flight into Egypt;  with only one difference.  The man is riding on the ass.    In the East it is the male who is dignified and even ceremonial.  Possibly that is why he wears skirts.  I pointed out long ago  that petticoats, which some regard as a garb of humiliation for women  are really regarded as the only garb of magnificence for men,  when they wish to be something more than men.  They are worn by kings,  by priests, and by judges.  The male Moslem, especially in his  own family, is the king and the priest and the judge.  I do not mean  merely that he is the master, as many would say of the male in many  Western societies, especially simple and self-governing societies.  I mean something more; I mean that he has not only the kingdom  and the power but the glory, and even as it were the glamour.  I mean he has not only the rough leadership that we often give  to the man, but the special sort of social beauty and stateliness  that we generally expect only of the woman.  What we mean when we  say that an ambitious man wants to have a fine woman at the head  of the dinner-table, that the Moslem world really means when it expects  to see a fine man at the head of the house.  Even in the street  he is the peacock, coloured much more splendidly than the peahen.  Even when clad in comparatively sober and partly European costume,  as outside the cafes of Cairo and the great cities, he exhibits  this indefinable character not merely of dignity but of pomp.  It can be traced even in the tarbouch, the minimum of Turkish  attire worn by all the commercial classes; the thing more commonly  called in England a fez.  The fez is not a sort of smoking cap.  It is a tower of scarlet often tall enough to be the head-dress  of a priest.  And it is a hat one cannot take off to a lady.    This fact is familiar enough in talk about Moslem and oriental  life generally; but I only repeat it in order to refer it back  to the same simplification which is the advantage and disadvantage  of the philosophy of the desert.  Chivalry is not an obvious idea.  It is not as plain as a pike-staff or as a palm-tree. It is a delicate  balance between the sexes which gives the rarest and most poetic  kind of pleasure to those who can strike it.  But it is not  self-evident to a savage merely because he is also a sane man.  It often seems to him as much a part of his own coarse common sense  that all the fame and fun should go to the sex that is stronger  and less tied, as that all the authority should go to the parents  rather than the children.  Pity for weakness he can understand;  and the Moslem is quite capable of giving royal alms to a cripple  or an orphan.  But reverence for weakness is to him simply meaningless.  It is a mystical idea that is to him no more than a mystery.  But the same is true touching what may be called the lighter side of  the more civilised sentiment.  This hard and literal view of life gives  no place for that slight element of a magnanimous sort of play-acting,  which has run through all our tales of true lovers in the West.  Wherever there is chivalry there is courtesy; and wherever there  is courtesy there is comedy.  There is no comedy in the desert.    Another quite logical and consistent element, in the very logical  and consistent creed we call Mahometanism, is the element  that we call Vandalism.  Since such few and obvious things alone  are vital, and since a half-artistic half-antiquarian affection  is not one of these things, and cannot be called obvious,  it is largely left out.  It is very difficult to say in a few  well-chosen words exactly what is now the use of the Pyramids.  Therefore Saladin, the great Saracen warrior, simply stripped  the Pyramids to build a military fortress on the heights of Cairo.  It is a little difficult to define exactly what is a man's duty to  the Sphinx; and therefore the Mamelukes used it entirely as a target.  There was little in them of that double feeling, full of pathos and irony,  which divided the hearts of the primitive Christians in presence of  the great pagan literature and art.  This is not concerned with brutal  outbreaks of revenge which may be found on both sides, or with chivalrous  caprices of toleration, which may also be found on both sides;  it is concerned with the inmost mentality of the two religions,  which must be understood in order to do justice to either.  The Moslem mind never tended to that mystical mode of \"loving yet leaving\"  with which Augustine cried aloud upon the ancient beauty, or Dante  said farewell to Virgil when he left him in the limbo of the pagans.  The Moslem traditions, unlike the medieval legends, do not suggest  the image of a knight who kissed Venus before he killed her.  We see in all the Christian ages this combination which is not  a compromise, but rather a complexity made by two contrary enthusiasms;  as when the Dark Ages copied out the pagan poems while denying  the pagan legends; or when the popes of the Renascence  imitated the Greek temples while denying the Greek gods.  This high inconsistency is inconsistent with"]]]
