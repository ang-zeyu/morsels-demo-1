Two days later Tom and Ned set off for Sandy Hook.    This long, neck-like strip of land on the New Jersey coast is, as most  of you know, one of the principal defenses of our country.    Foreign vessels that steam into New York harbor first have to pass the  line of terrible guns that, back of the earth and concrete defenses,  look frowningly out to sea. It is a wonderful place.    On the Sandy Hook Bay side of the Hook there is a life-saving station.  Right across, on the sea side, are the big guns. Between are the  barracks where the soldiers live, and part of the land is given over to  a proving ground, where many of the big guns are taken to be tested.    Tom and Ned reached New York City without incident of moment, and,  after a night spent at a hotel, they went to the Battery, whence the  small government steamer leaves every day for Sandy Hook. It is a trip  of twenty-one miles, and as the bay was rather rough that day, Tom and  Ned had a taste of a real sea voyage. But they were too experienced  travelers to mind that, though some other visitors were made quite ill.    A landing was made on the bay side of the Hook, it being too rough to  permit of a dock being constructed on the ocean side.    \"Now we'll see what luck we have,\" spoke Tom, as he and Ned, inquiring  the way to the proving grounds from a soldier on duty, started for  them. On the way they passed some of the fortifications.    \"Look at that gun!\" exclaimed Ned, pointing to a big cannon which  seemed to be crouched down in a sort of concrete pit. \"How can they  fire that, Tom? The muzzle points directly at the stone wall. Does the  wall open when they want to fire?\"    \"No, the gun raises up, peeps over the wall, so speak, shoots out its  projectile, and then crouches down again.\"    \"Oh, you mean a disappearing gun.\"    \"That's it, Ned. See, it works by compressed air,\" and Tom showed his  chum how, when the gun was loaded, the projectile in place, and the  breech-block screwed fast, the officer in charge of the firing squad  would, on getting the range from the soldier detailed to calculate it,  make the necessary adjustments, and pull the lever.    The compressed air would fill the cylinders, forcing the gun to rise on  toggle-jointed arms, so that the muzzle was above the bomb-proof wall.  Then it would be fired, and sink back again, out of sight of the enemy.    The boys looked at several different types of big rifled cannon, and  then passed on. They could hear firing in the distance, some of the  explosions shaking the ground.    \"They're making some tests now,\" said Tom, hurrying forward.    Ned followed until, passing a sort of machine shop, the lads came to  where a sentry paced up and down a concrete walk.    \"Are these the proving grounds?\" asked Tom. \"This is the entrance to  them,\" replied the soldier, bringing his rifle to \"port,\" according to  the regulations. \"What do you want?\"    \"To go in and watch the gun tests,\" replied Tom. \"I have a permit,\" and  he held it out so the soldier could see it.    \"That permit is no good here;\" the sentry exclaimed.    \"No good?\" faltered Tom.    \"No, it has to be countersigned by General Waller. And, as he's on the  proving grounds now, you can't see him. He's getting ready for the test  of his new cannon.\"    \"But that's just what we want to see!\" cried Tom. \"We want to get in  there purposely for that. Can't you send word to General Waller?\"    \"I can't leave my post,\" replied the sentry, shortly. \"You'll have to  come another time, when the General isn't busy. You can't get in unless  he countersigns that permit.\"    \"Then it may be too late to witness the test,\" objected the young  inventor. \"Isn't there some way I can get word to him?\"    \"I don't think so,\" replied the sentry. \"And I'll have to ask you to  leave this vicinity. No strangers are allowed on the proving grounds  without a proper pass.\"          CHAPTER VI    TESTING THE WALLER GUN      Tom looked at Ned in dismay. After all their work and planning, to be  thus thwarted, and by a mere technicality! As they stood there, hardly  knowing what to do, the sound of a tremendous explosion came to their  ears from behind the big pile of earth and concrete that formed the  bomb-proof around the testing ground.    \"What's that?\" cried Ned, as the earth shook.    \"Just trying some of the big guns,\" explained the sentry, who was not a  bad-natured chap. He had to do his duty. \"You'd better move on,\" he  suggested. \"If anything happens the government isn't responsible, you  know.\"    \"I wish there was some way of getting in there,\" murmured Tom.    \"You can see General Waller after the test, and he will probably  countersign the permit,\" explained the sentry.    \"And we won't see the test of the gun I'm most interested in,\" objected  Tom. \"If I could only--\"    He stopped as he noticed the sentry salute someone coming up from the  rear. Tom and Ned turned to behold a pleasant-faced officer, who, at  the sight of the young inventor, exclaimed:    \"Well, well! If it isn't my old friend Tom Swift! So you got here on my  permit after all?\"    \"Yes, Captain Badger,\" replied the lad, and then with a rueful face he  added: \"But it doesn't seem to be doing me much good. I can't get into  the proving grounds.\"    \"You can't? Why not?\" and he looked sharply at the sentry.    \"Very sorry, sir,\" spoke the man on guard, \"but General Waller has left  orders, Captain Badger, that no outsiders can enter the proving grounds  when his new gun is being tested unless he countersigns the permits.  And he's engaged just now. I'm sorry, but--\"    \"Oh, that's all right, Flynn,\" said Captain Badger. \"It isn't your  fault, of course. I suppose there is no rule against my going in  there?\" and he smiled.    \"Certainly not, sir. Any officer may go in,\" and the guard stepped to  one side.    \"Let me have that pass, Tom, and wait here for me,\" said the Captain.  \"I'll see what I can do for you,\" and the young officer, whose  acquaintance Tom had made at the tests when the government was  purchasing some aeroplanes for the army, hurried off.    He came back presently, and by his face the lads knew he had been  successful.    \"It's all right,\" he said with a smile. \"General Waller countersigned  the pass without even looking at it. He's so excited over the coming  test of his gun that he hardly knows what he is doing. Come on in,  boys. I'll go with you.\"    \"Then they haven't tested his gun yet?\" Asked Tom, eagerly, anxious to  know whether he had missed anything.    \"No, they're going to do so in about half an hour. You'll have time to  look around a bit. Come on,\" and showing the sentinel the  counter-signed pass, Captain Badger led the two youths into the proving  grounds.    Tom and Ned saw so much to interest them that they did not know at  which to look first. In some places officers and firing squads were  testing small-calibre machine guns, which shot off a round with a noise  like a string of firecrackers on the Chinese New Year's. On other  barbettes larger guns were being tested, the noise being almost  deafening.    \"Stand on your tiptoes, and open your mouth when you see a big cannon  about to be fired,\" advised Captain Badger, as he walked alongside the  boys.    \"What good does that do?\" inquired Ned.    \"It makes your contact with the earth as small as possible--standing on  your toes,\" the officer explained, \"and so reduces the tremor. Opening  your mouth, in a measure, equalizes the changed air pressure, caused by  the vacuum made when the powder explodes. In other words, you get the  same sort of pressure down inside your throat, and in the tubes leading  to the ear--the same pressure inside, as outside.    \"Often the firing of big guns will burst the ear drums of the officers  near the cannon, and this may often be prevented by opening the mouth.  It's just like going through a deep tunnel, or sometimes when an  elevator descends quickly from a great height.  There is too much  outside air pressure on the ear drums. By opening your mouth and  swallowing rapidly, the pressure is nearly equaled, and you feel no  discomfort.\"    The boys tried this when the next big gun was fired, and they found it  true. They noticed quite a crowd of officers and men about a certain  large barbette, and Captain Badger led them in that direction.    \"Is that General Waller's gun?\" asked Tom.    \"That's where they are going to test it,\" was the answer.    Eagerly Tom and Ned pressed forward. No one of the many officers and  soldiers grouped about the new cannon seemed to notice them. A tall  man, who seemed very nervous and excited, was hurrying here and there,  giving orders rapidly.    \"How is that range now?\" he asked. \"Let me take a look! Are you sure  the patrol vessels are far enough out? I think this projectile is going  farther than any of you gentlemen have calculated.\"    \"I believe we have correctly estimated the distance,\" answered someone,  and the two entered into a discussion.    \"That excited officer is General Waller,\" explained Captain Badger, in  a low voice, to Tom and Ned.    \"I guessed as much,\" replied the young inventor. Then he went closer to  get a better look at the big cannon.    I say big cannon, and yet it was not the largest the government had. In  fact, Tom estimated the calibre to be less than twelve inches, but the  cannon was very long--much longer in proportion than guns of greater  muzzle diameter. Then, too, the breech, or rear part, was very thick  and heavy.    \"He must be going to use a tremendous lot of powder,\" said Tom.    \"He is,\" answered Captain Badger. \"Some of us think he is going to use  too much, but he says it is impossible to burst his gun.  He wants to  make a long-range record shot, and maybe he will.\"    \"That's a new kind of breech block,\" commented Tom, as he watched the  mechanism being operated.    \"Yes, that's General Waller's patent, too. They're going to fire "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13610"],[0,"Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Volume 1 (#6)"],[1,", etc., 1775, vol. i, p.      469.)        At Tahiti, according to Cook, it was customary to \"gratify every      appetite and passion before witnesses,\" and it is added, \"in the      conversation of these people, that which is the principal source      of their pleasure is always the principal topic; everything is      mentioned without any restraint or emotion, and in the most      direct terms, by both sexes.\" (Hawkesworth, op. cit., vol ii, p.      45.)        \"I have observed,\" Captain Cook wrote, \"that our friends in the      South Seas have not even the idea of indecency, with respect to      any object or any action, but this was by no means the case with      the inhabitants of New Zealand, in whose carriage and      conversation there was as much modest reserve and decorum with      respect to actions, which yet in their opinion were not criminal,      as are to be found among the politest people in Europe. The women      were not impregnable; but the terms and manner of compliance were      as decent as those in marriage among us, and according to their      notions, the agreement was as innocent. When any of our people      made an overture to any of their young women, he was given to      understand that the consent of her friends was necessary, and by      the influence of a proper present it was generally obtained; but      when these preliminaries were settled, it was also necessary to      treat the wife for a night with the same delicacy that is here      required by the wife for life, and the lover who presumed to take      any liberties by which this was violated, was sure to be      disappointed.\" (Hawkesworth, op. cit., vol. ii, p. 254.)        Cook found that the people of New Zealand \"bring the prepuce over      the gland, and to prevent it from being drawn back by contraction      of the part, they tie the string which hangs from the girdle      round the end of it. The glans, indeed, seemed to be the only      part of their body which they were solicitous to conceal, for      they frequently threw off all their dress but the belt and      string, with the most careless indifference, but showed manifest      signs of confusion when, to gratify our curiosity, they were      requested to untie the string, and never consented but with the      utmost reluctance and shame.... The women's lower garment was      always bound fast round them, except when they went into the      water to catch lobsters, and then they took great care not to be      seen by the men. We surprised several of them at this employment,      and the chaste Diana, with her nymphs, could not have discovered      more confusion and distress at the sight of Actaeon, than these      women expressed upon our approach. Some of them hid themselves      among the rocks, and the rest crouched down in the sea till they      had made themselves a girdle and apron of such weeds as they      could find, and when they came out, even with this veil, we could      see that their modesty suffered much pain by our presence.\"      (Hawkesworth, op. cit., vol. ii, pp. 257-258.)        In Rotuma, in Polynesia, where the women enjoy much freedom, but      where, at all events in old days, married people were, as a rule,      faithful to each other, \"the language is not chaste according to      our ideas, and there is a great deal of freedom in speaking of      immoral vices. In this connection a man and his wife will speak      freely to one another before their friends. I am informed,      though, by European traders well conversant with the language,      that there are grades of language, and that certain coarse      phrases would never be used to any decent woman; so that      probably, in their way, they have much modesty, only we cannot      appreciate it.\" (J. Stanley Gardiner, \"The Natives of Rotuma,\"      _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, May, 1898, p. 481.)        The men of Rotuma, says the same writer, are very clean, the      women also, bathing twice a day in the sea; but \"bathing in      public without the _kukuluga_, or _sulu_ [loin-cloth, which is      the ordinary dress], around the waist is absolutely unheard of,      and would be much looked down upon.\" (_Journal of the      Anthropological Institute_, 1898, p. 410.)        In ancient Samoa the only necessary garment for either man or      woman was an apron of leaves, but they possessed so \"delicate a      sense of propriety\" that even \"while bathing they have a girdle      of leaves or some other covering around the waist.\" (Turner,      _Samoa a Hundred Years Ago_, p. 121.)        After babyhood the Indians of Guiana are never seen naked. When      they change their single garment they retire. The women wear a      little apron, now generally made of European beads, but the      Warraus still make it of the inner bark of a tree, and some of      seeds. (Everard im Thurn, _Among the Indians of Guiana_, 1883.)        The Mandurucu women of Brazil, according to Tocantins (quoted by      Mantegazza), are completely naked, but they are careful to avoid      any postures which might be considered indecorous, and they do      this so skilfully that it is impossible to tell when they have      their menstrual periods. (Mantegazza, _Fisiologia della Donna_,      cap 9.)        The Indians of Central Brazil have no \"private parts.\" In men the      little girdle, or string, surrounding the lower part of the      abdomen, hides nothing; it is worn after puberty, the penis being      often raised and placed beneath it to lengthen the prepuce. The      women also use a little strip of bast that goes down the groin      and passes between the thighs. Among some tribes (Karibs, Tupis,      Nu-Arwaks) a little, triangular, coquettishly-made piece of      bark-bast comes just below the mons veneris; it is only a few      centimetres in width, and is called the _uluri. In both sexes      concealment of the sexual mucous membrane is attained_. These      articles cannot be called clothing. \"The red thread of the      Trumai, the elegant _uluri_, and the variegated flag of the      Bororo attract attention, like ornaments, instead of drawing      attention away.\" Von den Steinen thinks this proceeding a      necessary protection against the attacks of insects, which are      often serious in Brazil. He does think, however, that there is      more than this, and that the people are ashamed to show the      glans penis. (Karl von den Steinen, _Unter den Naturvoelkern      Zentral-Brasiliens_, 1894, pp. 190 et seq.)        Other travelers mention that on the Amazon among some tribes the      women are clothed and the men naked; among others the women      naked, and the men clothed. Thus, among the Guaycurus the men are      quite naked, while the women wear a short petticoat; among the      Uaupas the men always wear a loin-cloth, while the women are      quite naked.        \"The feeling of modesty is very developed among the Fuegians, who      are accustomed to live naked. They manifest it in their bearing      and in the ease with which they show themselves in a state of      nudity, compared with the awkwardness, blushing, and shame which      both men and women exhibit if one gazes at certain parts of their      bodies. Among themselves this is never done even between husband      and wife. There is no Fuegian word for modesty, perhaps because      the feeling is universal among them.\" The women wear a minute      triangular garment of skin suspended between the thighs and never      removed, being merely raised during conjugal relations. (Hyades      and Deniker, _Mission Scientifique du Cap Horn_, vol. vii, pp.      239, 307, and 347.)        Among the Crow Indians of Montana, writes Dr. Holder, who has      lived with them for several years, \"a sense of modesty forbids      the attendance upon the female in labor of any male, white man or      Indian, physician or layman. This antipathy to receiving      assistance at the hands of the physician is overcome as the      tribes progress toward civilization, and it is especially      noticeable that half-breeds almost constantly seek the      physician's aid.\" Dr. Holder mentions the case of a young woman      who, although brought near the verge of death in a very difficult      first confinement, repeatedly refused to allow him to examine      her; at last she consented; \"her modest preparation was to take      bits of quilt and cover thighs and lips of vulva, leaving only      the aperture exposed.... Their modesty would not be so striking      were it not that, almost to a woman, the females of this tribe      are prostitutes, and for a consideration will admit the      connection of any man.\" (A.B. Holder, _American Journal of      Obstetrics_, vol. xxv, No. 6, 1892.)        \"In every North American tribe, from the most northern to the      most southern, the skirt of the woman is longer than that of the      men. In Esquimau land the _parka_ of deerskin and sealskin      reaches to the knees. Throughout Central North America the      buckskin dress of the women reached quite to the ankles. The      West-Coast women, from Oregon to the Gulf of California, wore a      petticoat of shredded bark, of plaited grass, or of strings, upon      which were strung hundreds of seeds. Even in the most tropical      areas the rule was universal, as anyone can see from the codices      or in pictures of the natives.\" (Otis T. Mason, _Woman's Share in      Primitive Culture_, p. 237.)        Describing the loin-cloth worn by Nicobarese men, Man says: \"From      the clumsy mode in which this garment is worn by the Shom      Pen--necessitating frequent readjustment of the folds--one is led      to infer that its use is not _de rigueur_, but reserved for      special occasions, as when receiving or visiting strangers.\"      (E.H. Man, _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, 1886, p.      442.)        The semi-nude natives of the island "]]]
