CHAPTER V    A CRUISE IN THE ARMOURED TRAIN      Estcourt: November 9, 1899.    How many more letters shall I write you from an unsatisfactory address?  Sir George White's Headquarters are scarcely forty miles away, but  between them and Estcourt stretches the hostile army. Whether it may be  possible or wise to try to pass the lines of investment is a question  which I cannot yet decide; and meanwhile I wait here at the nearest post  collecting such information as dribbles through native channels, and  hoping that early events may clear the road. To wait is often weary  work--but even at this exciting time I come to a standstill at length  with a distinct feeling of relief. The last month has been passed in  continual travel. The fading, confused faces at Waterloo as the train  swept along the platform; the cheering crowds at Southampton; the  rolling decks of the 'Dunottar Castle;' the suspense, the excitement of  first news; a brief day's scurry at Cape Town; the journey to East  London by the last train to pass along the frontier; the tumultuous  voyage in the 'Umzimvubu' amid so great a gale that but for the Royal  Mail the skipper would have put back to port; on without a check to  Pietermaritzburg, and thence, since the need seemed urgent and the  traffic slow, by special train here--all moving, restless pictures--and  here at last--a pause.    Let us review the situation. On Wednesday last, on November 1, the Boer  lines of investment drew round Ladysmith. On Thursday the last train  passed down the railway under the fire of artillery. That night the line  was cut about four miles north of Colenso. Telegraphic communication  also ceased. On Friday Colenso was itself attacked. A heavy gun came  into action from the hills which dominate the town, and the slender  garrison of infantry volunteers and naval brigade evacuated in a hurry,  and, covered to some extent by the armoured train, fell back on  Estcourt.    Estcourt is a South African town--that is to say, it is a collection of  about three hundred detached stone or corrugated iron houses, nearly all  one-storied, arranged along two broad streets--for space is  plentiful--or straggling away towards the country. The little place lies  in a cup of the hills, which rise in green undulations on all sides. For  this reason it will be a very difficult place to defend if the invaders  should come upon it. It is, besides, of mean and insignificant aspect;  but, like all these towns in Natal, it is the centre of a large  agricultural district, at once the market and the storehouse of dozens  of prosperous farms scattered about the country, and consequently it  possesses more importance than the passing stranger would imagine.  Indeed, it was a surprise to find on entering the shops how great a  variety and quantity of goods these unpretentious shanties contained.    Estcourt now calls itself 'The Front.' There is another front forty  miles away, but that is ringed about by the enemy, and since we live in  expectation of attack, with no one but the Boers beyond the outpost  line, Estcourt considers that its claim is just, Colonel Wolfe Murray,  the officer who commands the lines of communication of the Natal Field  Force, hastened up as soon as the news of the attack on Colenso was  received to make preparation to check the enemy's advance.    The force at his disposal is not, however, large--two British  battalions--the Dublin Fusiliers, who fought at Glencoe, and were  hurried out of Ladysmith to strengthen the communications when it became  evident that a blockade impended, and the Border Regiment from Malta, a  squadron of the Imperial Light Horse, 300 Natal volunteers with 25  cyclists, and a volunteer battery of nine-pounder guns--perhaps 2,000  men in all. With so few it would be quite impossible to hold the long  line of hills necessary for the protection of the town, but a position  has been selected and fortified, where the troops can maintain  themselves--at any rate for several days. But the confidence of the  military authorities in the strength of Estcourt may be gauged by the  frantic efforts they are making to strengthen Pietermaritzburg,  seventy-six miles, and even Durban, one hundred and thirty miles further  back, by earthworks and naval guns. 'The Boers invade Natal!' exclaims  Mr. Labouchere in the number of 'Truth' current out here. 'As likely  that the Chinese army should invade London.' But he is not the only  false prophet.    It seems, however, certain that a considerable force will be moved here  soon to restore the situation and to relieve Ladysmith. Meanwhile we  wait, not without anxiety or impatience. The Imperial Horse, a few  mounted infantry, the volunteer cyclists, and the armoured train, patrol  daily towards Colenso and the north, always expecting to see the  approaching Boer commandos. Yesterday I travelled with the armoured  train. This armoured train is a very puny specimen, having neither gun  nor Maxims, with no roof to its trucks and no shutters to its  loopholes, and being in every way inferior to the powerful machines I  saw working along the southern frontier. Nevertheless it is a useful  means of reconnaissance, nor is a journey in it devoid of interest. An  armoured train! The very name sounds strange; a locomotive disguised as  a knight-errant; the agent of civilisation in the habiliments of  chivalry. Mr. Morley attired as Sir Lancelot would seem scarcely more  incongruous. The possibilities of attack added to the keenness of the  experience. We started at one o'clock. A company of the Dublin Fusiliers  formed the garrison. Half were in the car in front of the engine, half  in that behind. Three empty trucks, with a platelaying gang and spare  rails to mend the line, followed. The country between Estcourt and  Colenso is open, undulating, and grassy. The stations, which occur every  four or five miles, are hamlets consisting of half a dozen corrugated  iron houses, and perhaps a score of blue gum trees. These little specks  of habitation are almost the only marked feature of the landscape,  which on all sides spreads in pleasant but monotonous slopes of green.  The train maintained a good speed; and, though it stopped repeatedly to  question Kaffirs or country folk, and to communicate with the cyclists  and other patrols who were scouring the country on the flanks, reached  Chieveley, five miles from Colenso, by about three o'clock; and from  here the Ladysmith balloon, a brown speck floating above and beyond the  distant hills, was plainly visible.    Beyond Chieveley it was necessary to observe more caution. The speed was  reduced--the engine walked warily. The railway officials scanned the  track, and often before a culvert or bridge was traversed we disembarked  and examined it from the ground. At other times long halts were made  while the officers swept the horizon and the distant hills with field  glasses and telescopes. But the country was clear and the line  undamaged, and we continued our slow advance. Presently Colenso came  into view--a hundred tin-pot houses under the high hills to the  northward. We inspected it deliberately. On a mound beyond the village  rose the outline of the sandbag fort constructed by the Naval Brigade.  The flagstaff, without the flag, still stood up boldly. But, so far as  we could tell, the whole place was deserted.    There followed a discussion. Perhaps the Boers were lying in wait for  the armoured train; perhaps they had trained a gun on some telegraph  post, and would fire the moment the engine passed it; or perhaps, again,  they were even now breaking the line behind us. Some Kaffirs approached  respectfully, saluting. A Natal Volunteer--one of the cyclists--came  forward to interrogate. He was an intelligent little man, with a  Martini-Metford rifle, a large pair of field glasses, a dainty pair of  grey skin cycling shoes, and a slouch hat. He questioned the natives,  and reported their answers. The Kaffirs said that the Dutchmen were  assuredly in the neighbourhood. They had been seen only that morning.  'How many?' The reply was vague--twelve, or seventeen, or one thousand;  also they had a gun--or five guns--mounted in the old fort, or on the  platform of the station, or on the hill behind the town. At daylight  they had shelled Colenso. 'But why,' we asked, 'should they shell  Colenso?' Evidently to make sure of the range of some telegraph post.  'It only takes one shell to do the trick with the engine,' said the  captain who commanded. 'Got to hit us first, though,' he added. 'Well,  let's get a little bit nearer.'    The electric bell rang three times, and we crept forward--halted--looked  around, forward again--halt again--another look round; and so, yard by  yard, we approached Colenso. Half a mile away we stopped finally. The  officer, taking a sergeant with him, went on towards the village on  foot. I followed. We soon reached the trenches that had been made by the  British troops before they evacuated the place. 'Awful rot giving this  place up,' said the officer. 'These lines took us a week to dig.' From  here Colenso lay exposed about two hundred yards away--a silent,  desolate village. The streets were littered with the belongings of the  inhabitants. Two or three houses had been burned. A dead horse lay in  the road, his four legs sticking stiffly up in the air, his belly  swollen. The whole place had evidently been ransacked and plundered by  the Boers and the Kaffirs. A few natives loitered near the far end of  the street, and one, alarmed at the aspect of the train, waved a white  rag on a stick steadily to and fro. But no Dutchmen were to be seen. We  made our way back to the railway line and struck it at the spot where it  was cut. Two lengths of rails had been lifted up, and, with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14431"],[0,"International Miscellany of Literature, Art and Science, Vol. 1, (#6)"],[1,"becoming public? A thought, vulgar, critical,  skeptical, dogmatic, may, according to you, be unvailed innocently:  a sentiment, commonplace, cold, not intimate, awaking no palpitation  within you, no response in others, may be revealed without violation of  modesty; but a thought that is pious, ardent, lighted at the fire of the  heart or of heaven, a sentiment burning, cast forth by an explosion of  the volcano of the soul; a cry of the inmost nature, awaking by its  accent of truth young and sympathetic voices in the present age or the  future: and above all, a tear! a tear not painted like those which flow  upon your shrouds of parade, a tear of water and salt, falling from the  eyes, instead of a drop of ink, falling from the pen! This is crime! this  is shame! this is immodesty, for you! That is to say, that whatever is  cold and artificial is innocent in the artist, but what is warm and  natural is unpardonable in the man. That is to say, modesty in a writer  consists in exposing what is false, immodesty in setting forth what is  true. If you have talent, show it, but not your soul, carrying mine away!  Oh, shame! What logic!    But after all, you are right at bottom, only you do not know how to  express it. It is perfectly true that there are mysteries, nudities,  parts of the soul not shameful but sensitive, depths, personalities, last  foldings of thought and feeling, which would cost horribly to uncover,  and which an honorable and natural scruple would never permit us to lay  bare, without the remorse of violated modesty. There is, I agree with  you, such a thing as indiscretion of heart. I felt this cruelly myself,  the first time when, having written certain poetic dreams of my soul  certain too real utterances of my sentiments, I read them to my most  intimate friends. My face was covered with blushes, and I could not  finish. I said to them: \"No, I cannot go farther; you shall read it.\"  \"And how is it,\" answered my friends, \"that you cannot read to us what  you are about to give to all Europe to read?\" \"No,\" I said, \"I cannot  tell why, but I feel no shame in letting the public read it, though I  experience an invincible repugnance to reading it myself, face to face to  only two or three of my friends.\"    They did not understand me--I did not understand myself. We together  exclaimed at the inconsistency of the human heart. Since then I have felt  the same instinctive repugnance at reading to a single person what cost  me not a single effort of violated modesty to give to the public: and  after having long reflected on it, I find that this apparent  inconsistency is at bottom only the perfect logic of our nature.    And why is this? The reason is, that a friend is somebody and the public  nobody; a friend has a face, the public has not; a friend is a being,  present, hearing, looking, a real being--the public is an invisible  being, a being of the reason, an abstraction; a friend has a name, and  the public is anonymous; a friend is a confidant, and the public is a  fiction. I blush before the one, because he is a man; I do not blush  before the other, because it is an idea. When I write or speak before the  public, I feel myself as free, as exempt from the susceptibilities of one  man to another, as if I were speaking or writing before God and in the  desert; the crowd is a solitude; you see it, you know that it exists, but  you know it only as a mass. As an individual it does not exist. Now this  modesty of which you speak, being the respect of one's self before some  other person, when there is no person distinct on account of the  multitude, becomes without a motive. Psyche blushed under a lamp because  the hand of a single god passed over her, but when the sun gazed at her  with his thousand rays from the height of Olympus, that personification  of the modest soul did not blush before the whole heaven. Here is the  exact image of the modesty of a writer before a single auditor, and of  the freedom of his utterance before all the world. Do you accuse me of  violating mysteries before you? You have not the right: I do not know  you, I have confided nothing to you personally. You are guilty of  impropriety in reading what is not addressed to you. You are _somebody_,  you are not the public. What do you want with me? I have not spoken to  you: you have nothing to say to me, and I nothing to reply.    So thought St. Augustine, Plato, Socrates, Cicero, Caesar, Bernardin de  St. Pierre, Montaigne, Alfieri, Chateaubriand, and all other men who have  confided to the world the genuine palpitations of their own hearts. True  gladiators they are in the human Colosseum, not playing miserable  comedies of sentiment and style to distract an academy, but struggling  and dying in earnest on the stage of the world, and writing on the sand,  with the blood of their own veins, the heroism, the failings, or the  agonies of the human heart.    Having said this, I resume these notes where I left them, blushing for  one thing only before these critics, that is, for not having either the  soul of St. Augustine or the genius of Jean Jacques Rousseau, in order to  merit, by indiscretions as sacred and touching, the pardon of tender  hearts and the condemnation of narrow minds, that take every movement of  the soul for an obscenity, and hide their faces whenever they are shown a  heart.           *       *       *       *       *      BALZAC.      We have news from Paris of the death of Honore De Balzac, one of the most  eminent French writers of the nineteenth century. \"Eighteen months ago,\"  says a Paris letter, \"already attacked by dropsy, he quitted France to  contract a marriage with a Russian lady, to whom he was devotedly  attached. To her he had dedicated 'Seraphitus,' and he had accumulated in  his hotel of the Beaujoin quarters all the luxuries which could  contribute to her pleasure. He returned to France three months ago, in a  state of extreme danger. Last week he underwent an operation for abscess  in his legs: mortification ensued. On the morning of the 18th he became  speechless, and at midnight he expired. His sister, Madame de Surville,  visited his deathbed, and the pressure of her hand was the last sign he  gave of intelligence.\" We must defer for another occasion what we have  to say of the great novelist-the idol of women, even at seventy-the  Voltaire of our age, as he was accustomed to style himself in  private--the historian of society--French society--as it is. The author  of _Le Peau de Chagrin, Le Physiologie du Marriage, Le Dernier Chauan,  Eugene Grandet_, and the _Scenes de la Vie Parisienne_, and _Scenes de la  Vie de Province_, was one of the marks of the era, and being dead, we  will speculate upon him. At present we can only translate for the  _International_ the following funeral oration by Victor Hugo, pronounced  at his grave:    \"GENTLEMEN--The man who has just descended into this tomb is one of those  whom the public sorrow follows to the last abode. In the times where we  are all fictions have disappeared. Henceforth our eyes are fixed not on  the heads that reign but on the heads that think, and the whole country  is affected when one of them disappears. At this day, the people put on  mourning for the man of talent, the nation for the man of genius.    \"Gentlemen, the name of Balzac will be mingled in the luminous trace that  our epoch will leave in the future.    \"M. de Balzac belonged to that potent generation of writers of the  nineteenth century who came after Napoleon, just as the illustrious  pleiades of the seventeenth century came after Richelieu, and in the  development of civilization a law caused the domination of thought to  succeed the domination of the sword.    \"M. de Balzac was one of the first among the greatest, one of the highest  among the best. This is not the place to say all or that splendid and  sovereign intelligence. All his books form only one hook, living,  luminous, profound, in which we see moving all our contemporaneous  civilization, mingled with I know not what of strange and terrible; a  marvelous book, that the poet has entitled comedy, and which he might  have called history; which assumes all forms and all styles: which goes  beyond Tacitus and reaches Suetonius, which crosses Beaumarchais and  reaches Rabelais; a book which is observation itself, and imagination  itself; which is prodigal of the true, the passionate, the common, the  trivial, the material, and which at moments throws athwart realities,  suddenly and broadly torn open, the gleam of the most somber and tragic  ideal.    \"Without knowing it, whether he will or not, whether he consents or not,  the author of this strange and immense work is of the mighty race of  revolutionary writers. Balzac goes directly to his object. He assails  modern society face to face. From all he forces something: from some  illusions, from others hope, from these a cry of pain, from those a mask.  He unvails vice and dissects passion. He penetrates and sounds the heart,  the soul, the sentiments, the brain, the abyss that each man has within  him. And by a gift of his free and vigorous nature, by a privilege of the  intelligences of our times,--who, having seen revolutions nearly and with  their own eyes, perceive better the end of humanity and comprehend better  the course of Providence,--Balzac came forth serene and smiling from  those redoubtable studies which produced melancholy in Moliere and  misanthropy in Rousseau.    \"This is what he has accomplished among us. Such is the work he has left  us, lofty and solid, a pile of granite, a monumental edifice, from whose  summit his renown will henceforth shine. Great men make their own  pedestals: the future charges itself with their statues.    \"His death has struck Paris with stupor. But a few months since he  returned to France. Feeling that he was about to die, he desired to see  his country, like one who on the eve of a long voyage"]]]
