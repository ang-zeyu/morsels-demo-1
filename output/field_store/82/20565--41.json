In brief, my honoured master, I soon discovered,  was reckoned a very fair conjuror; he consulted the stars, drew horoscopes,  cast nativities, was learned in the expositions of dreams and omens,  undertook to give information respecting lost property, and matrimonial  prospects; composed, and dispensed charms and philtres, and proved himself,  as I have hinted, a capital astrologer, and something more. How Sanazio,  who certainly was a very extraordinary man, acquired his multifarious  information, unless really by supernatural agency, I am at a loss to  discover. Ignatius Druso, my fellow student, was of opinion that he only  dexterously availed himself in the evening of the news which he had  gathered from his patients in the morning; and that his familiars were no  more than a few active emissaries, for whose espionage and additional  gleanings of town news, it answered to him well, to pay. Ever partial to  romance, I did not readily fall in with Druso's sober view of this subject,  and the longer I lived with Doctor Sanazio, the more occasion had I to  doubt the correctness of his opinion, because some things occurred of  which my master obtained immediate and accurate knowledge, whilst I am  perfectly certain that no human tongue had divulged them to him; take the  following incident as an example:--Druso and myself were accustomed, on  those evenings which Sanazio spent in his sanctum, to visit patients in  his stead, to range over the town, to go to places of public amusement, or  to conclude our meritorious labours at a tavern. Being one night at this  latter place, an old woman entered, and inquiring whether I were Master  Serventius, Doctor Sanazio's pupil, slipped a billet and a piece of gold  into my hand and desired me to follow her. I did so, without hesitation,  and whilst behind my guide, contrived to peruse the note by moon-light,  which contained these words:    \"I am sick,--of the heart's mortal sickness;--relieve it, and great shall  be thy recompense.\"    Perplexed, yet amused, by what promised an adventure, I followed my  ancient guide into a house whose exterior was sufficiently humble; but,  having ascended a steep flight of stairs, she threw open the door of a  chamber in which they terminated, and I found myself not only in a  richly-furnished apartment, but in the presence of a lady, young as  immortal Hebe, and fair as day. I saw at a glance that her ills were those  of the mind only, and ere she had opened her lips to detail them and  engage me in her cause, I had vowed, heart and soul, to be her champion.  Having complimented me upon the high character she had heard of my prowess,  understanding, and principles, she informed me, with little circumlocution,  that various unhappy family circumstances had rendered it necessary for  her to seek friends amongst strangers; that she was a novice of the  Convent of St. Anne, but on the eve of profession, and that having long  been under an engagement of marriage with a young gentleman of family,  respecting whom her relations had used her very deceitfully and cruelly,  she had fixed upon me as a person little likely to be subjected to  suspicion on her account, to aid Signor Fernandez in the difficult and  hazardous enterprise, which she said must be a work of time and prudence,  of carrying her off from the convent. Having obtained my promise to this  effect, she detailed her plans, and furnished me with the means of  continual communication with her lover and herself. I returned home,  highly elated at the trust reposed in me, at the importance which I had  acquired in my own eyes, and at the prospect of a handsome remuneration  for my services, from the lovely object of them. Sanazio, with lamp in  hand, and arrayed in his night attire, to my great terror and surprise,  opened the door to me himself; it was very late, Druso had long since  returned without me, and in order to allay the storm which I saw gathering  upon mine ancient master's brow, I slipped the gold given to me by the  confidante of beautiful Antonia, into his unreluctant hand.    \"Unhappy youth!\" exclaimed Sanazio, \"beware of aiding the nun, lest thou  bring upon her and upon thyself the fate of Artemisia and Serventius.\"    These words so alarmed me that I nearly fainted; for how, in the name of  all things holy and gracious, came Sanazio to know in whose society I had  passed the last hour, and what was the subject of our conversation? His  terrible allusion too, to those lost loved ones, of whose untimely fate I  was still so ignorant, strangely troubled my conscious breast. Let me be  brief, the hours of my ill-fated existence are fast wearing away, and I  have yet more to relate. To Ignatius Druso I was obliged to confide my  secret, because his assistance, in the furtherance of plans which were  always requiring, from little immaterial circumstances, some slight  alterations, was found necessary; and it must here suffice those to know,  who shall, after my destruction do me the melancholy favour of perusing  this retrospective record, that some months after Antonia had taken the  veil, I succeeded in restoring her to the arms of her lover, witnessed  their private nuptials, visited them in their new residence, a villa in a  secluded spot far from Padua, and received my promised recompense. \"Young  man! you've ruined yourself; and your fatal destiny is sealed!\" were the  remarkable words of Sanazio, on the morning after the completion of my  enterprise, but long ere the elopement of the new devotee became publicly  known. However, he never reverted to the subject, not even upon his  death-bed; and after the learned doctor's decease, when I came into the  whole of his practice, and no small portion of his fame, I was easy, for  the memory of that sacrilege had passed away.    Ignatius Druso, like myself, resided in Padua, but soon quitted the  medical profession, disgusted, I fancy, at finding that I had become a  second Sanazio, whilst he commanded little or no attention: still we were  friends, nor did I suspect that the germs of envy and malice were sown in  his bosom, and that I had trusted him with one secret, or more, too much.  \"Serventius, my son,\" had said the venerable Sanazio to me upon his  death-bed, \"your ardent desire of knowledge and discreet use of it,  encourage me ere I quit this world, to entrust you with the grand arcanum  of our art; as yet, you know not the secret of my success, but take then  this hint and improve upon it. Can he repair a piece of mechanism, who is  ignorant of its make, its parts, and how they act upon, and affect one  another? Behold this key; it is that of my laboratory, and may it indeed  open the door of knowledge to you.\"    After Sanazio's decease, curiosity quickly led me to his study: I was  alone, and the shades of evening were stealing over the earth: conceive  then my utter dismay and superstitious horror upon suddenly entering, what  I could but suppose to be a charnel-house! Its effluvium was intolerable,  and well accounted for by (loathsome spectacle!) a disorderly collection  of human fragments in various stages of preservation and decay! A dozen  grisly skeletons grinned upon me from pedestals round the room, and in the  centre of it, the half dissected body of a man, stretched upon a large  lava slab, supported by tressels, was more horrible and odious than all. I  now comprehended the full meaning of Sanazio's dying words and secret; but  received at the same time, a shock which to this day I have not recovered;  I found myself compelled to make Druso my confidant in this matter, and my  companion in some of my first attempts at following the hideous occupation  recommended by my deceased friend. By degrees I grew accustomed to the  horrors of the room and of my employment. Druso, who found himself better  engaged in courting the living than in cutting up the dead, was no longer  necessary to me in the prosecution of my hateful studies, and kept aloof,  but I soon discovered the value of them, in my increase of knowledge,  employment, and reputation. At last an epidemic raged in Padua, proving  very fatal; Ignatius, alarmed for the safety of his Phaedera, who was  attacked, applied to me, and I cured her. Some time afterwards, the  ungrateful wretch rushed into my laboratory, claiming the body upon which  I was operating, as that of a young man, cousin to Phaedera, which had  miraculously disappeared just previous to the day intended for its  interment. The features of the poor wretch were too much disfigured to  render possible his recognition by them, but Druso swore to its being the  body of Marcus, from a scar on the left leg, which had been wounded  severely by a quoit. Of course I refused to resign, that, for which I had  paid a handsome price, and to reveal the names of those from whom I  purchased it. So Druso dragged me before the Supreme Council, impeached me  of sacrilege in the affair of the nun, of theft, and of violating the  sanctity of the tomb, of barbarously mutilating the dead, and of applying  their lacerated remains to the unholy purposes of sorcery! and on these  counts have I been indicted, found guilty, and sentenced to be burnt as a  sacrilegious heretic, an unnatural robber, and a formidable wizard!  Antonia, the mother of seven children, is to be--like the unchaste  vestal--immured! Oh Heaven! whilst Druso the Informer, receiving at the  same time the portion of a prince for his venal treachery, will celebrate  his union with Phaedera, amidst the shrieks and groans of his expiring  victims!    I cannot now proceed: ere I am bound to the fatal stake, methinks I shall  die of shame, grief, and terror. And did the friends of my infancy, my  parents, suffer as I shall suffer?

Volume 20, No. 567, (#6)"],[1,"there being rumours of war at this period, no ships were  admitted during the night,--the chain being a security against an enemy  entering, and cutting out vessels under favour of the darkness.    [By aid of a telescope, he recognises on the opposite tower a fair  prisoner, \"the lovely Isabel,\" who had been confined there upwards of a  year for conspiring to murder her first husband. The hero by aid of the  chain, swings to Isabel's tower, where they concert an escape.]    As Isabel pressed closer to me, I felt, that, although far from agreeable  to sojourn in such a place, even with Isabel, this would yet be greatly  preferable to solitude. But to such a project, many serious difficulties  presented themselves: I represented to Isabel, that if I did not reach the  opposite tower that night, it would be discovered, when the food put into  my cell remained untasted, that I was gone; and as the conclusion would  necessarily be, that I had leaped into the sea, no more food would be put  into my cell, and consequently, when I did return, I should die of hunger.  \"But,\" said Isabel, \"why return ever? Providence seems to delight in  throwing us together,--and if, as unhappily seems too true, the doom of  both of us be to live and die in these towers, why should we not----\"    \"Live and die together, you would say;\" and, in truth, there was reason  in this proposal of Isabel. \"Why, indeed, should we not?\" said I; but in  yielding so readily to this suggestion, I looked farther than Isabel did.  Isabel had doubtless many charms,--and here, I should at least have nothing  to fear from rivals; but that which weighed with me fully as much as the  prospect of a honey-moon, was this,--that a man who is supposed to be dead,  has greater facilities of escape,--and so, without at that time saying any  thing upon this subject to Isabel, I acquiesced in the proposal of changing  my quarters, and being her guest for the present.    \"There cannot be a doubt,\" said Isabel, \"that the Pope has long ago been  applied to by my husband to dissolve our marriage.\"    \"And that his holiness has granted the petition, too,\" said I. \"And  although ours be a new case, as it probably never happened before that the  idea of marrying was entertained by persons in solitary imprisonment,--yet  as there is here neither church nor priest, Heaven will, without doubt,  accept our vows, and bless us:\" and thus did I become all but the husband  of Isabel.    Several days elapsed before it was again the turn of Isabel to watch on  the summit; meantime the food that was intended for one, was made to  suffice for two; we conversed in whispers, lest my embryo plan of escape  should be frustrated by a premature discovery of my dwelling place;  and even if I had looked to no ulterior advantages, from my change of  quarters, the society of Isabel would have been a sufficient reward for  the peril of my journey. But I had now concocted in my mind, a plan  of escape, which I hastened to put in execution, after having first  communicated it to Isabel, whose co-operation was necessary to ensure  its success.    It may have been already gathered, that the characteristic of the  punishment of solitary confinement in the towers of Tarifa, consisted in  the rigidness with which it was enforced: once admitted there, and no  human eye ever more rested upon the living form of the prisoner. The food  necessary for the preservation of life, and therefore, for the continuance  of punishment, was placed, and removed, by unseen hands; nor was the sound  of a human voice ever heard within these stone chambers. But to this, one  exception was provided: although it was the policy of the law, to punish  the living culprit thus severely, the church did not resign her claims to  the care of his soul; once accordingly, in every month, a holy tread was  heard along the secret passages, and an iron screen being thrown hack, the  confessor, a Franciscan friar, took his seat at a thick grating; behind  which nothing could be seen, though the confession of the prisoner might  pass to the ear of the holy man, and his counsel in return reach the ear,  or it might be, the heart, of the solitary criminal. The door by which the  prisoner first entered was never unbarred, until the hour when his coffin  was carried in and out.    The day now approached, when the visit of the confessor might be  expected, and I laid my plans accordingly, and executed them in the  following manner:    \"Isabel,\" said I, as the slow tread announced the approach of the  confessor, \"you must feign to be dead; spread the pallet opposite to the  grating, and lay yourself upon it.\"    I found some difficulty in prevailing upon Isabel to mock the king of  terrors; but, at length, I succeeded in persuading her,--by representing  that it was easier to counterfeit death than to meet it; and that to do  the one afforded the only chance of avoiding the other; and scarcely was  Isabel extended upon the floor, when the screen was heard to open upon  its harsh hinges, and the confessor to say, \"erring daughter, approach.\"    \"Father,\" said I, in a low sepulchral tone, at the same time advancing  noiselessly towards the grating.    \"Holy St. Francis,\" said the confessor, in a voice of terror, and making  at the same time a retrograde movement from the grating, \"'tis a man!\"    \"Father,\" said I, in the same unearthly tone, \"fear nothing, it is no  man that addresses thee; well thou knowest that no fleshly form can  gain entrance here; it is not a man, but a spirit, with whom thou art  communing.\" As I spoke thus, I could hear the Friar rapidly commending  himself to the protection of the Holy Mother of God, and of all the  Saints; and I continued, \"She whom thou camest to confess, is now beyond  the reach of thy counsel: her soul has gone to its heavy account, and  her body lieth there;\" said I, gliding aside, and knowing well, that  although nothing could be seen from the cell through the grating, yet  all within was visible from the other side. \"I am the ghost of the  murdered Jose Andrades;\" (the husband of Isabel) and at the same time  that I made this announcement, I threw back a part of the hood that  covered my face, and the dim light from the circular hole falling upon  the upper part of the countenance, showed a visage which fasting and  confinement had already made more like the face of a dead than of  a living man, and which I had taken care to besmear with blood.    A new exclamation of horror, and still more rapid prayers, followed this  revelation.    \"Here,\" continued I, again drawing the hood over my face, and  approaching the grate--from which I could hear the Friar retreating;  \"here will I remain, in dread communion with the body of my murderer,  until it be taken hence; delay not to let this be done, else I will  speak with thee nearer anon.\"    The Friar being already as near to the ghost of a murdered man as he  probably desired to be, and willing to prevent the execution of this  threat of a nearer colloquy, swung the screen forward, which closed with  a tremendous clank, and the rapid footsteps of the terrified confessor  speedily died away.    \"Ah, Dios!\" said Isabel, \"I had scarcely courage to go through my part:  when you spoke of my soul having gone to its account, I was on the point  of rising, to convince myself that I was yet living.\"    \"Surely,\" returned I, \"you may find courage to personate a dead woman,  when I have no hesitation in personating the ghost of a murdered man;  the stratagem succeeds; you will have but once more to play your part;  and I am much mistaken if we be not both outside of this tower before  another day shall pass over our heads;\" and animated by this hope,  Isabel promised to obey my directions.    Now, it will easily be believed, that the confessor, upon leaving  the tower, would immediately communicate to the civil and spiritual  authorities, the particulars of the extraordinary interview that had  taken place; and that although doubts might at first be entertained of  the sanity of the narrator, yet, that his positive asseverations would  at length so far weigh with the alcalde, and the bishop of Ronda, who  then chanced to be making his yearly visitation to Tarifa, as to induce  them to judge with their own eyes, of the truth of what had been told to  them. I was prepared for this; and when in less than three hours, the  iron screen was heard to fall back, Isabel was again stretched upon the  ground, while I stood motionless by her side. Who were the persons that  peered through the grate, I am unable to tell, but whoever they might  be, they were quickly satisfied with their scrutiny; for when I glided  towards the grate, at the same time allowing the hood to fall partially  back, the screen was suddenly closed, and quick retiring footsteps  announced the further success of the stratagem.    However extraordinary the thing might seem, and however hard of belief,  no doubt could any longer rest upon the minds of those whom first duty,  and then incredulity, had led to the tower, that something supernatural  inhabited the chamber where lay the dead Isabel. Her, they had seen  extended on the floor; and they had seen another being, which could not be  a mortal, because well they were convinced no mortal could gain entrance  there. That it was the ghost of him who had been murdered by the inmate  of the cell, no one could doubt: and the sooner therefore the body of the  wretched prisoner could be carried out, the sooner would this spirit cease  to haunt the tower of Tarifa. It was in this manner therefore, that the  affair was argued by the confessor, the bishop, and the alcalde, among  whom the following colloquy took place:    \"I suppose, gentlemen,\" said the confessor, \"you are now sufficiently  convinced that I have told you no tale.\"    \"Sufficiently convinced,\" said the alcalde; yet breathless with fear.    \"There is no doubt of it,\" said the bishop; panting"]]]
