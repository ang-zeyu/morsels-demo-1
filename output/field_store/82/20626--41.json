Suddenly one of our men uttered a cry. We all halted, surprised by an  unsolved phenomenon known only to travelers in these trackless wastes.    \"Somewhere, near us, in an indeterminable direction, a drum was  rolling, the mysterious drum of the sands. It was beating distinctly,  now with greater resonance and again feebler, ceasing, then resuming  its uncanny roll.    \"The Arabs, terrified, stared at one another, and one said in his  language: 'Death is upon us.' As he spoke, my companion, my friend,  almost a brother, dropped from his horse, falling face downward on the  sand, overcome by a sunstroke.    \"And for two hours, while I tried in vain to save him, this weird drum  filled my ears with its monotonous, intermittent and incomprehensible  tone, and I felt lay hold of my bones fear, real fear, hideous fear, in  the presence of this beloved corpse, in this hole scorched by the sun,  surrounded by four mountains of sand, and two hundred leagues from any  French settlement, while echo assailed our ears with this furious drum  beat.    \"On that day I realized what fear was, but since then I have had  another, and still more vivid experience--\"    The commandant interrupted the speaker:    \"I beg your pardon, but what was the drum?\"    The traveler replied:    \"I cannot say. No one knows. Our officers are often surprised by this  singular noise and attribute it generally to the echo produced by a  hail of grains of sand blown by the wind against the dry and brittle  leaves of weeds, for it has always been noticed that the phenomenon  occurs in proximity to little plants burned by the sun and hard as  parchment. This sound seems to have been magnified, multiplied, and  swelled beyond measure in its progress through the valleys of sand, and  the drum therefore might be considered a sort of sound mirage. Nothing  more. But I did not know that until later.    \"I shall proceed to my second instance.    \"It was last winter, in a forest of the Northeast of France. The sky  was so overcast that night came two hours earlier than usual. My guide  was a peasant who walked beside me along the narrow road, under the  vault of fir trees, through which the wind in its fury howled. Between  the tree tops, I saw the fleeting clouds, which seemed to hasten as if  to escape some object of terror. Sometimes in a fierce gust of wind the  whole forest bowed in the same direction with a groan of pain, and a  chill laid hold of me, despite my rapid pace and heavy clothing.    \"We were to sup and sleep at an old gamekeeper's house not much farther  on. I had come out for hunting.    \"My guide sometimes raised his eyes and murmured: 'Ugly weather!' Then  he told me about the people among whom we were to spend the night. The  father had killed a poacher, two years before, and since then had been  gloomy and behaved as though haunted by a memory. His two sons were  married and lived with him.    \"The darkness was profound. I could see nothing before me nor around me  and the mass of overhanging interlacing trees rubbed together, filling  the night with an incessant whispering. Finally I saw a light and soon  my companion was knocking upon a door. Sharp women's voices answered  us, then a man's voice, a choking voice, asked, 'Who goes there?' My  guide gave his name. We entered and beheld a memorable picture.    \"An old man with white hair, wild eyes, and a loaded gun in his hands,  stood waiting for us in the middle of the kitchen, while two stalwart  youths, armed with axes, guarded the door. In the somber corners I  distinguished two women kneeling with faces to the wall.    \"Matters were explained, and the old man stood his gun against the  wall, at the same time ordering that a room be prepared for me. Then,  as the women did not stir: 'Look you, monsieur,' said he, 'two years  ago this night I killed a man, and last year he came back to haunt me.  I expect him again to-night.'    \"Then he added in a tone that made me smile:    \"'And so we are somewhat excited.'    \"I reassured him as best I could, happy to have arrived on that  particular evening and to witness this superstitious terror. I told  stories and almost succeeded in calming the whole household.    \"Near the fireplace slept an old dog, mustached and almost blind, with  his head between his paws, such a dog as reminds you of people you have  known.    \"Outside, the raging storm was beating against the little house, and  suddenly through a small pane of glass, a sort of peep-window placed  near the door, I saw in a brilliant flash of lightning a whole mass of  trees thrashed by the wind.    \"In spite of my efforts, I realized that terror was laying hold of  these people, and each time that I ceased to speak, all ears listened  for distant sounds. Annoyed at these foolish fears, I was about to  retire to my bed, when the old gamekeeper suddenly leaped from his  chair, seized his gun and stammered wildly: 'There he is, there he is!  I hear him!' The two women again sank upon their knees in the corner  and hid their faces, while the sons took up the axes. I was going to  try to pacify them once more, when the sleeping dog awakened suddenly  and, raising his head and stretching his neck, looked at the fire with  his dim eyes and uttered one of those mournful howls which make  travelers shudder in the darkness and solitude of the country. All eyes  were focused upon him now as he rose on his front feet, as though  haunted by a vision, and began to howl at something invisible, unknown,  and doubtless horrible, for he was bristling all over. The gamekeeper  with livid face cried: 'He scents him! He scents him! He was there when  I killed him.' The two women, terrified, began to wail in concert with  the dog.    \"In spite of myself, cold chills ran down my spine. This vision of the  animal at such a time and place, in the midst of these startled people,  was something frightful to witness.    \"Then for an hour the dog howled without stirring; he howled as though  in the anguish of a nightmare; and fear, horrible fear came over me.  Fear of what? How can I say? It was fear, and that is all I know.    \"We remained motionless and pale, expecting something awful to happen.  Our ears were strained and our hearts beat loudly while the slightest  noise startled us. Then the beast began to walk around the room,  sniffing at the walls and growling constantly. His maneuvers were  driving us mad! Then the countryman, who had brought me thither, in a  paroxysm of rage, seized the dog, and carrying him to a door, which  opened into a small court, thrust him forth.    \"The noise was suppressed and we were left plunged in a silence still  more terrible. Then suddenly we all started. Some one was gliding along  the outside wall toward the forest; then he seemed to be feeling of the  door with a trembling hand; then for two minutes nothing was heard and  we almost lost our minds. Then he returned, still feeling along the  wall, and scratched lightly upon the door as a child might do with his  finger nails. Suddenly a face appeared behind the glass of the  peep-window, a white face with eyes shining like those of the cat  tribe. A sound was heard, an indistinct plaintive murmur.    \"Then there was a formidable burst of noise in the kitchen. The old  gamekeeper had fired and the two sons at once rushed forward and  barricaded the window with the great table, reinforcing it with the  buffet.    \"I swear to you that at the shock of the gun's discharge, which I did  not expect, such an anguish laid hold of my heart, my soul, and my very  body that I felt myself about to fall, about to die from fear.    \"We remained there until dawn, unable to move, in short, seized by an  indescribable numbness of the brain.    \"No one dared to remove the barricade until a thin ray of sunlight  appeared through a crack in the back room.    \"At the base of the wall and under the window, we found the old dog  lying dead, his skull shattered by a ball.    \"He had escaped from the little court by digging a hole under a fence.\"    The dark-visaged man became silent, then he added:    \"And yet on that night I incurred no danger, but I should rather again  pass through all the hours in which I have confronted the most terrible  perils than the one minute when that gun was discharged at the bearded  head in the window.\"        _The Confession_      Marguerite de Therelles was dying. Although but fifty-six, she seemed  like seventy-five at least. She panted, paler than the sheets, shaken  by dreadful shiverings, her face convulsed, her eyes haggard, as if she  had seen some horrible thing.    Her eldest sister, Suzanne, six years older, sobbed on her knees beside  the bed. A little table drawn close to the couch of the dying woman,  and covered with a napkin, bore two lighted candles, the priest being  momentarily expected to give extreme unction and the communion, which  should be the last.    The apartment had that sinister aspect, that air of hopeless farewells,  which belongs to the chambers of the dying. Medicine bottles stood  about on the furniture, linen lay in the corners, pushed aside by foot  or broom. The disordered chairs themselves seemed affrighted, as if  they had run, in all the senses of the word. Death, the formidable, was  there, hidden, waiting.    The story of the two sisters was very touching. It was quoted far and  wide; it had made many eyes to weep.    Suzanne, the elder, had once been madly in love with a young man, who  had also been in love with her. They were engaged, and were only  waiting the day fixed for the contract, when Henry de Lampierre  suddenly died.    The despair of the young girl was dreadful, and she vowed that she  would never marry. She kept her word. She put on widow's weeds, which  she never took off.    Then her sister, her little sister Marguerite, who was only twelve  years"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12774"],[0,"Dave Darrin's First Year at Annapolis (#6)"],[1,"as the village of Annapolis.  You must attend me with extreme care, for, after I have narrated  the news, I shall question you concerning it.  Do you follow me,  misters?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" came in a chorus.    \"You need not answer quite as loudly,\" warned Midshipman Trotter,  sending a backward look over his shoulder at the door.  \"Now,  then, the police over in Sleepy Hol--Annapolis--today learned  the details of a yellow tragedy.  Some weeks ago three Chinamen  came to town and opened a clean--I mean, a new--laundry.  During  the last week, however, the public noted that the door leading  from the office to the rear room was always closed.  You follow  me?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" came in an almost whispered chorus.    \"Finally,\" continued Mr. Trotter, \"one customer, more curious  than the others, reported his observations to the police.  Today  the Johnny Tinplates made a raid on the place.  A most curious  state of affairs came to light.  So--but is this tangled tale  clear to you all as far as I have gone?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" came the whispered chorus.    \"What the police learned,\" went on Mr. Trotter, in a voice that  now sounded slightly awestruck, \"was this: a week ago the three  Chinese partners had a serious row.  They quarreled, then fought.  Two of the yellow partners killed the third!  And now, a serious  problem confronted the two survivors of that misunderstanding.  What was to be done with the remains of the unsuccessful disputant?\"    Midshipman Trotter looked at each of the wondering plebes in turn.  It looked as though he were asking the question of them.    \"I don't know, sir,\" admitted Dan Dalzell, at the left of the line.    \"I don't know, sir,\" admitted the man next to Dan.  So it went  down the line, until Dave Darrin, at the further end, had admitted  himself to be as much in the dark as were the others.    \"Then, listen,\" resumed Mr. Trotter impressively.  \"The Chinese,  being descended from a very ancient civilization, are not only  very ingenious but also very thrifty.  They were burdened with  two hundred pounds of evidence on the premises.  In their extremity  the two survivors cut up their late partner, cooked him, and disposed  of the flesh at meal times.\"    From the gravity of the narrator's expression he appeared to be  reciting a wholly true story.    \"Now, then,\" rasped out Midshipman Trotter, \"that being the state  of affairs at the laundry--_what was the telephone number_?\"    Trotter's gaze was fixed on Dan Dalzell's face almost accusingly.    \"How the--\" began startled Dan gruffly.  Then, instantly realizing  that he was making a mistake, he broke in hastily:    \"Beg your pardon, sir, but I don't understand how to get at the  telephone number.\"    \"You try, mister,\" ordered Midshipman Trotter, turning to the  plebe next to Dalzell.    \"I can't solve the problem, sir.\"    So it ran, straight down the line, each confessing his ignorance,  until finally Mr. Trotter glared at Dave Darrin.    \"Come, come, mister, from the very exact narrative that I have  given, can't you deduce the telephone number of that laundry?\"    \"Yes, sir; I think so,\" answered Darrin, with a slight smile.    \"Ah!  Then there's a man in the squad who is more than a mere  saphead.  Let us have the telephone number, mister!    \"Two-ate-one-John,\" replied Dave promptly.    This was the correct answer.  Dave had heard that \"gag\" before.    \"Mister,\" beamed Mr. Trotter, \"I congratulate you.  You are no  mollycoddle.  Your head is not over-fat, but somewhat stocked  with ideas.  As soon as you have soaked in a few more ideas you  will be fit to associate with the young gentlemen at this  sailor-factory.  You may, therefore, take the washbowl, fill it  half full of ideas, and stand on your head in them until they have  soaked well in!\"    Poor Dave, his face flushed crimson, could have dropped in his  humiliation at having thus fallen into the trap.  But he started  manfully for the washbowl, which he half filled with water.  Meanwhile  the other five plebes were choking.  They could have screamed  in their glee--had they dared!    Placing the bowl where ordered, Dave bent down to his knees, immersing  the top of his head in the water.    With hands on opposite sides of the bowl he balanced his feet,  preparatory to hoisting them into place against the wall.    \"Up oars!\" commanded Mr. Hayes dryly.    From one of the visiting plebes came an incautious giggle.  Mr.  Hayes turned and marked his man with a significant stare that  made the unfortunate giggler turn red and white in turn with alarm.    At the order, \"up oars,\" Dave Darrin sent his feet aloft.  By  rare good luck he succeeded the first time trying.    There he remained, his head in the bowl of water, his feet resting  against the wall.    Just at this moment, though, the sound of trouble was in the air,  even if it reached interested ears but faintly.    A step was heard in the corridor outside.  There was a faint knock.    The upper class midshipmen knew on the instant what the knock  meant--and so indeed did Dave Darrin.          CHAPTER IV    THE \"YOUNGSTERS\" WHO BECAME \"SPOONS ON\"      It was a most critical moment in the life histories of several  young men who had grown to consider themselves as future officers  in the United States Navy!    Such a man as Midshipman Bender was certain to report any form  of hazing he detected.    Now, the usual punishment meted out to hazers at either Annapolis or  West Point is dismissal from the service!    True, this was not brutal hazing, but merely the light form of  the sport known as \"running\" the new man.    Nevertheless, \"all hazing looks alike\" to the public, when posted  by the newspapers, and the Naval Academy authorities deal severely  with even \"running.\"    So, for all of the \"youngsters,\" or third class men, who had been  conducting the evening's festivities, all the elements of trouble,  and perhaps of dismissal, were at hand.    But Dave Darrin had been the first to hear the soft approach of  footsteps, and somehow, he had guessed at the meaning of it all.    Just in the fraction of a second before the knock had sounded  at the door Dave had made a fine handspring that brought him from  his topsy-turvy attitude to a position of standing on his feet.  And, at the same time, he held the washbowl in his hand without  having spilled a drop of the water.  Like a flash Dave few across  the room, depositing the bowl where it belonged.  With a towel  he wiped his hair, then swiftly mopped his face dry.  Hair brush  and comb in hand, he turned, saving:    \"Why, I suppose, gentlemen, Dalzell and myself were very fair  athletes in the High School sense of the word.  But it's a long  jump from that to aspiring to the Navy football team.  Of course  we'll turn out for practice, if you wish, but--\"    At this moment, Lieutenant Bender, the \"duty-crazy\" one, thrust  the door open.    Here Dave, on his way to the mirror, hairbrush and comb in hand,  halted as though for the first time aware of the accusing presence  of Bender, midshipman in charge of the floor for the day.    \"Uh-hum!\" choked Midshipman Bender more confused, even, than he  had expected the others to be.    \"Looks like rather good material, doesn't he, Bender?\" inquired  Mr. Trotter.  \"Green, of course, and yet--\"    \"I didn't come here to discuss Navy athletics,\" replied Midshipman  Bender.    \"Oh, an official visit--is that it?\" asked shipman Hayes, favoring  the official visitor with a baby-stare.  \"As it is past graduation,  and there are no evening study hours, there is no regulation against  visiting in the rooms of other members of the brigade.\"    \"No,\" snapped Mr. Bender, \"there is not.\"    Saying this the midshipman in charge turned on his heel and left  the room.    An instant after the door had closed the lately scared youngsters  expressed themselves by a broad grin, which deepened to a very  decided chuckle as Mr. Bender's footsteps died away.    \"Mister,\" cried Midshipman Trotter, favoring Darrin with a glance  of frank friendliness, \"do you know that you saved us from frapping  the pap hard?\"    \"And that perhaps you've saved us from bilging?\" added Midshipman  Hayes.    \"I'm such a greenhorn about the Navy, sir, that I am afraid I  don't follow you in the least, sir,\" Darrin replied quietly.    Then they explained to him that the \"pap\" is the conduct report,  and that \"to frap\" is to hit.  To \"frap the pap\" means to \"get  stuck on\" the conduct report for a breach of discipline.  A \"bilger\"  is one who is dropped from the service, or who is turned back  to the class below.    \"I judged that there was some trouble coming sir,\" Dave confessed,  \"and I did the best that I could.  It was good luck on my part that  I was able to be of service to you.\"    \"Good luck, eh?\" retorted Midshipman Trotter.  \"Third class men,  fall in!\"    As the \"youngsters\" lined up Mr. Trotter, standing at the right  of the line, asked coaxingly:    \"Mister, will you be condescending enough to pass down the line  and shake hands with each of us?\"    Flushing modestly, but grinning, Dave did as asked--or directed.    \"Mister,\" continued Midshipman Trotter impressively, \"we find  ourselves very close to being 'spoons on' you.\"    For a youngster to be \"spoons on\" a new fourth classman means  for the former to treat the latter very nearly as though he were  a human being.    \"Now, you green dandelions may go,\" suggested Mr. Trotter, turning  to the four \"visiting\" plebes.    As soon as this had come about Trotter turned to Dave Darrin.    \"Mister, we humble representatives of the third class are going  to show you the only sign of appreciation within our power.  We  are going to invite you to stroll down the deck and visit us in  our steerage.  Your roommate is invited to join us.\"    Dave and Dan promptly accepted, with becoming appreciation.  All  of the youngsters escorted Dave and Dan down the corridor to  Midshipman Trotter's room.    In the course of"]]]
