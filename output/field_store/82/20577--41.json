LE LIEVRE DU GASCON    Un Marseillais se promenait un jour avec un Gascon a quelque  distance d'Amiens. Tout a coup un gros lievre sauta presque dans  les jambes du Marseillais.    \"Ah, le gros lievre, s'ecria celui-ci.--Gros lievre, c'est vrai,  dit le Gascon, mais pas si gros qu'un certain lievre que j'ai  tue l'annee derniere.--Ah! de quelle grandeur etait-il?--Aussi  gros qu'un cheval, au moins.\"    Le Marseillais sourit et ne dit rien. Mais apres quelque temps:    \"A propos, mon ami, dit-il, nous allons passer le pont de la  Somme, et l'on dit que cette riviere noie infailliblement les  menteurs.\"    Le Gascon se gratta la tete, et peu apres il dit:    \"J'y ai bien reflechi et je crois qu'il etait comme un veau, mon  lievre.\" Le Marseillais se tut encore, mais comme on arrivait  a une riviere, le Gascon crut que c'etait la Somme et dit:    \"Peut-etre qu'il n'etait pas plus gros qu'un mouton.\"    La riviere passee et apres avoir marche quelque temps, l'habitant  de Marseille dit:    \"Cette fois, voila vraiment la Somme.--Apres tout, dit le Gascon,  j'ai bien reflechi et je crois que mon lievre etait a peu pres  comme celui que nous avons vu tout a l'heure.--Et moi, je te  dis, mon ami, que cette riviere n'est pas plus terrible que la  Garonne.\"      Ou se promenait-on?--Quel incident s'est produit?--Quelle reputation  les Gascons ont-ils?--Celui-ci etait-il comme tous les autres  de son pays?--Quel moyen le Marseillais a-t-il trouve de lui  faire dire la verite?

Le prestidigitateur alla trouver  les autorites et proposa de donner une seance au benefice des  pauvres, si la ville voulait consentir a payer la location de la  salle, etc. L'amorce philanthropique fit son effet, la recette  remplit la caisse et l'envoye de la Municipalite se presenta le  lendemain matin pour toucher. \"J'ai deja dispose de l'argent,  dit le prestidigitateur; la recette etant destinee aux pauvres,  je l'ai distribuee a mes gens, qui sont les plus pauvres de la  ville; j'ai tenu mon engagement.--Mais c'est un vilain tour,  cela, dit l'envoye.--Que voulez-vous? repliqua l'autre, je vis  de mes tours.\"      Ou la troupe donnait-elle des seances?--Les recettes etaient-elles  moins abondantes que d'ordinaire?--A qui le directeur s'est-il  presente?--Qu'est-ce qu'il proposa de faire?--A quelles conditions  voulait-il donner une seance?--A-t-on accepte la proposition?--La  recette a-t-elle ete bonne?--Qui est venu trouver le prestidigitateur  le lendemain?--Quelle conversation a eu lieu?

L 'ESPRIT PRECOCE    Pic de la Mirandole, savant italien, se distingua par une precocite  extraordinaire, en meme temps que par la hardiesse de ses theses  en philosophie. Parmi les courtisans qui admiraient l'esprit du  jeune homme quand il n'avait encore que neuf ans, se trouvait  un lourdaud qui dit en sa presence: \"Quand les enfants ont tant  d'esprit, ils deviennent ordinairement stupides dans un age  avance.--Si ce que vous dites est vrai, lui repartit le jeune  prince, vous devez avoir eu beaucoup d'esprit quand vous etiez  enfant.\"      Dans quel domaine le savant italien s'est-il distingue?--A-t-il  ete un enfant stupide?--S'est-on apercu de bonne heure de ses  dons?--Comment un certain maladroit a-t-il voulu rabaisser son  prix?--Quelle repartie spirituelle le jeune prince a-t-il trouvee?

SAGESSE D'UN PERSAN    Un roi de Perse, qui a ete surnomme le Juste, et qui a merite ce  glorieux surnom, voulut, un jour qu'il etait a la chasse, manger  du gibier qu'il avait tue. Comme il n'avait point de sel, il envoya  un esclave pour en chercher au village voisin, et lui recommanda  de le payer tres exactement. La plupart des courtisans du prince  trouvaient que leur maitre attachait beaucoup d'importance a de  bien petites choses: \"Pourquoi, Sire, dirent-ils, tenez-vous  a payer ce peu de sel, dont le vendeur ne ferait pas de cas, et  qu'il s'estimerait heureux de pouvoir vous laisser gratis?--Un  roi, leur repondit-il, doit ne donner que de bons exemples. Qu'il  prenne[1] un fruit dans un jardin, ses vizirs voudront arracher  l'arbre; qu'il se permette[1] de prendre un oeuf sans payer,  ses soldats tueront toutes les poules.\"    [Footnote 1: Why subjunctive?]      Pourquoi donnait-on a ce roi le surnom de Juste?--A quel  divertissement se"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11758"],[0,"Baldy of Nome (#6)"],[1,"there'd hardly be a chanct t' beat him, I  s'pose.\"    \"I'm not so sure of that, Ben. Of course the team counts for a great  deal; so, too, does the skill of the driver. But there are many other  things that enter into this contest that do not have to be considered  usually. Given a mile of smooth track and horses in perfect condition,  well mounted, the fastest one is apt to win. In a race that lasts for  over three days and nights, however, through the roughest sort of  country, in weather that may range from a thaw to a blizzard, and with  fifteen or twenty dogs to manage, the Luck of the Trail is an enormous  factor. One team may run into a storm, and be delayed for hours, that  another may escape entirely; and a trivial accident may put the best  team and driver entirely out of commission.\"    \"That's so,\" agreed Danny. \"That's what happened the year 'Scotty' lost  the race to Seppala, an' came in second. Don't you know, George, your  father told us it was near the end o' the run, an' the dogs was gettin'  pretty tired, so he put a loose leader at the head t' give 'em new  life--sort t' ginger 'em up. I guess that dog was as tired as the rest,  an' nervous, 'cause he missed the trail in a terrible blow an' got  separated from 'Scotty' an' went back t' the Road House they'd left  last, like he'd been learned t' do. O' course 'Scotty' looked for him a  while an' then went back for him. But it lost the race, all right, an'  the cinch he had on breakin' the record. With them four hours lost, an'  what he done later, he'd 'a' made the best time ever known in a dog race  in Alaska. Gee, it was awful.\"    The Woman sighed. \"Well, at least they can't blame the loss of _that_  race on you, can they, Jack? It certainly was hard luck, but we will  have to be good sports and try it again. Perhaps you'll develop a dog  star of the first magnitude for us in your race, boys.\"    George and Danny looked serious. It was a difficult problem--this  assembling of a racing team, and the responsibility weighed heavily upon  them. Why, it meant the possibility of making a juvenile Record, and  winning a Cup, and naturally required a critical consideration of even  the smallest details.    \"If I could only take some o' the Sweepstakes Dogs,\" mused George  regretfully, \"it 'ud be dead easy; but Father says it wouldn't be fair  t' the fellers that hasn't a racin' stable t' pick from. We got t' use  some o' the untried ones. I been thinkin' o' Spot for a leader. He seems  sort o' awkward, 'cause he's raw-boned, an' ain't filled out yet; but  all the other dogs like him, an' he'd ruther run than eat.\"    \"Isn't he pretty young for that position?\" hazarded the Woman. \"Let me  see, he can't be much more than a year old now.\"    She remembered when he had been a common little fellow, but a short time  ago, sprawling in every mud-puddle, or wobbling uncertainly after the  many strange alluring things in the streets. Matt, who seemed to have  second sight in regard to the invisible, latent good points in all  horses and dogs, had picked him up in the pound for a mere nothing; and  to him there was granted the vision of a brilliant future for the  vagrant puppy. \"Mark my words,\" he had said decisively when Spot's fate  hung in the balance, \"you can't go wrong on him; he'll be a credit to us  all some day.\" And so Spot was rescued from death, or at least from a  life of poverty and obscurity, and given to George Allan to become his  constant companion.    \"You know,\" she persisted, \"if a leader is too young he's apt to become  over-zealous and important the way Irish did the day we loaned him to  Charlie Thompson in the first Moose Handicap. Don't you remember he was  disgusted at the way they were being managed by a rank novice, so he  took his place in front of a rival team that was being well driven, and  led them to victory, with the whole town cheering and yelling? You don't  want that to happen to you, because your leader is inexperienced.\"    \"It ain't the same thing at all,\" explained George patiently; for it is  ever the man's part to try to be patient with the feminine ignorance of  dogs and baseball and other essential things about which women seem to  have no intuition. \"You see, I ain't goin' to drive him loose. A dog  shouldn't ever be a loose leader unless he's a wonder at managin' all  the rest, an' young dogs ain't generally had the trainin' for it. After  a dog has showed he can find the trail, an' keep it, an' set the pace,  an' make the others mind him, bein' a loose leader's kind of an honor  he's promoted to; like bein' a General in the army. He don't have t' be  hitched up to the tow-line any more, an' pull; he just has t' think, an'  keep the team out o' trouble.\"    \"It's too bad that dogs aren't driven with lines instead of spoken  orders--then there wouldn't be all of the bother about a leader every  time.\" Both George and Danny looked at her for a moment with a contempt  they barely succeeded in concealing. Even Ben Edwards was unpleasantly  surprised, and he was not given to regarding her vagaries with  unfriendly criticism.    Drive with lines! Bother about a leader! Why, if dogs were driven with  lines there would be no more interest in driving a dog team than there  is in driving a delivery wagon, or running an automobile. All of the  fascination of having your dogs answer to your will, voluntarily and  intelligently, would be lost in the mechanical response to the jerk and  the pull of the reins.    She was utterly hopeless. There was no use of a further waste of words  with her on such matters.    George turned to Danny and Ben. They were discerning, and capable of  grasping a dog man's point of view. \"Then there's Queen, for one  wheeler. You know we're only allowed three dogs, an' we got t' be mighty  careful.\"    \"I expect it's pretty near 's important t' git the right wheel dogs as  'tis a leader, ain't it, George? Bein' next t' the sled an' so close t'  the driver an' load, they allers seem t' kinda manage the business end  o' things.\"    \"That's right, Ben. That's why we got t' be sure o' gettin' good  wheelers. In racin' there's no load, but it takes some managin' just the  same t' keep the sled right on side hills an' goin' down steep slopes.  O' course in a short race I wouldn't get into the sled at all, an' on  the runners at the back I can get my feet on the brake easy. But Father  an' Matt say that you want your wheelers t' know just what their duties  is if the brake gets out o' order, or any thin' goes wrong.\"    \"Wheelers have to be clever, and strong and tractable then--rather a  big order,\" murmured the Woman somewhat meekly, as one seeking  information.    \"Yes, ma'am,\" replied Danny politely, \"all o' that, an' I was just  wonderin' if Queen 'ud do for the place.\"    Queen, another present of Matt's to George, was a Gordon Setter with a  strong admixture of native blood, and was hopeless as a regular team dog  because of her high-strung and irritable disposition. Naturally nervous,  she had become, with the advent of her first family, so fierce that it  was dangerous for any one to approach her except George, and for him she  cheerfully left her puppies to be of service in sled pulling.    \"Oh, I think she'll do; when you know Queen an' like her she ain't so  bad; an' besides not bein' able t' take any o' the real racers don't  leave us much choice.\"    \"Do you--don't you think you could use Baldy?\" suggested Ben eagerly.  \"He's no locomotive like McMillan, ner a flyin' machine like them Tolman  dogs an' Irish an' Rover; but you've no idea how powerful an' willin' he  is till you've tried him. Just give him a show, George. I'm 'most sure  he'd make good. Moose Jones allers said he would.\"    There was a moment of serious consideration on the part of George,  while Danny eyed Baldy critically, and remarked with discrimination,  \"Better take him; some o' these common lookin' dogs has the right stuff  in 'em. If looks was everythin' I guess you an' me 'ud be scrappin' over  Oolik Lomen or Margaret Winston, that new fox-hound Russ Downing just  got from Kentucky. But you an' me know too much t' get took in by just  good looks, George.\"    \"All right, Ben. I'll take Baldy for the other wheel dog,\" said George  as he ran his hand over Baldy's sturdy, muscular body. \"He'll be able to  show somethin' o' what's in him in this dash. Now we'd better see about  Danny's team.\"    The Woman's observation that she thought Jemima, being black, would make  a more artistic wheel-mate for Queen from the standpoint of color  harmony, than would white-faced sable Baldy, was silently ignored, as  was merited.    And so, in defiance of Art, and in spite of her evident prejudice  against him, Baldy made one of George Allan's Racing Team.    Danny, after much discussion and deep thought, selected Judge for his  leader, and Jimmie and Pete as wheelers. They were all steady and  reliable, and made up a more dependable team than George's uncertain  combination of youthful Spot, fiery Queen, and untried Baldy.    Ben was elated that the latter had been accepted by such experts as  being worthy a place in the coming event. And as he left the Kennel to  rush home to tell his mother the great news, he pictured Baldy in his  coming role of wheeler in so distinguished a company. \"I'm mighty glad I  give him up when I did,\" he thought cheerfully. \"Baldy is sure gettin'  his chanct now.\"    [Illustration]          IV    The Plodder    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    CHAPTER IV    THE PLODDER      The last two weeks before the Alaska Juvenile Race, as the Nome Kennel  Club had announced it, were busy ones, not only for the boys who were to  actually take part in it, but for all of their friends as well.
