He considered himself a  true sportsman because he was 'fond o' huntin',' and 'took a sight o'  comfort out of seein' the critters hit the mud' when his gun was fired.  The neighbors called him a squatter, and looked on him merely as an  anchored tramp. He shot and trapped the year round, and varied his game  somewhat with the season perforce, but had been heard to remark he could  tell the month by the 'taste o' the patridges,' if he didn't happen to  know by the almanac. This, no doubt, showed keen observation, but was  also unfortunate proof of something not so creditable. The lawful season  for murdering partridges began September 15th, but there was nothing  surprising in Cuddy's being out a fortnight ahead of time. Yet he  managed to escape punishment year after year, and even contrived to pose  in a newspaper interview as an interesting character.    He rarely shot on the wing, preferring to pot his birds, which was not  easy to do when the leaves were on, and accounted for the brood in the  third ravine going so long unharmed; but the near prospect of other  gunners finding them now, had stirred him to go after 'a mess of birds.'  He had heard no roar of wings when the mother-bird led off her four  survivors, so pocketed the two he had killed and returned to the shanty.    The little grouse thus learned that a dog is not a fox, and must be  differently played; and an old lesson was yet more deeply  graven--'Obedience is long life.'    The rest of September was passed in keeping quietly out of the way of  gunners as well as some old enemies. They still roosted on the long,  thin branches of the hardwood trees among the thickest leaves, which  protected them from foes in the air; the height saved them from foes on  the ground, and left them nothing to fear but coons, whose slow, heavy  tread on the limber boughs never failed to give them timely warning. But  the leaves were falling now--every month its foes and its food. This was  nut time, and it was owl time, too. Barred owls coming down from the  north doubled or trebled the owl population. The nights were getting  frosty and the coons less dangerous, so the mother changed the place of  roosting to the thickest foliage of a hemlock-tree.    Only one of the brood disregarded the warning _'Kreet, kreet_.' He stuck  to his swinging elm-bough, now nearly naked, and a great yellow-eyed owl  bore him off before morning.    Mother and three young ones now were left, but they were as big as she  was; indeed one, the eldest, he of the chip, was bigger. Their ruffs had  begun to show. Just the tips, to tell what they would be like when  grown, and not a little proud they were of them.    The ruff is to the partridge what the train is to the peacock--his chief  beauty and his pride. A hen's ruff is black with a slight green gloss. A  cock's is much larger and blacker and is glossed with more vivid  bottle-green. Once in a while a partridge is born of unusual size and  vigor, whose ruff is not only larger, but by a peculiar kind of  intensification is of a deep coppery red, iridescent with violet, green,  and gold. Such a bird is sure to be a wonder to all who know him, and  the little one who had squatted on the chip, and had always done what he  was told, developed before the Acorn Moon had changed, into all the  glory of a gold and copper ruff-for this was Redruff, the famous  partridge of the Don Valley.          IV      One day late in the Acorn Moon, that is, about mid-October, as the  grouse family were basking with full crops near a great pine log on the  sunlit edge of the beaver-meadow, they heard the far-away bang of a gun,  and Redruff, acting on some impulse from within, leaped on the log,  strutted up and down a couple of times, then, yielding to the elation of  the bright, clear, bracing air, he whirred his wings in loud defiance.  Then, giving fuller vent to this expression of vigor, just as a colt  frisks to show how well he feels, he whirred yet more loudly, until,  unwittingly, he found himself drumming, and tickled with the discovery  of his new power, thumped the air again and again till he filled the  near woods with the loud tattoo of the fully grown cock-partridge. His  brother and sister heard and looked on with admiration and surprise; so  did his mother, but from that time she began to be a little afraid of  him.    In early November comes the moon of a weird foe. By a strange law of  nature, not wholly without parallel among mankind, all partridges go  crazy in the November moon of their first year. They become possessed of  a mad hankering to get away somewhere, it does not matter much where.  And the wisest of them do all sorts of foolish things at this period.  They go drifting, perhaps, at speed over the country by night, and are  cut in two by wires, or dash into lighthouses, or locomotive headlights.  Daylight finds them in all sorts of absurd places, in buildings, in open  marshes, perched on telephone wires in a great city, or even on board of  coasting vessels. The craze seems to be a relic of a bygone habit of  migration, and it has at least one good effect, it breaks up the  families and prevents the constant intermarrying, which would surely be  fatal to their race. It always takes the young badly their first year,  and they may have it again the second fall, for it is very catching; but  in the third season it is practically unknown.    Redruff's mother knew it was coming as soon as she saw the frost grapes  blackening, and the maples shedding their crimson and gold. There was  nothing to do but care for their health and keep them in the quietest  part of the woods.    The first sign of it came when a flock of wild geese went _honking_  southward overhead. The young ones had never before seen such  long-necked hawks, and were afraid of them. But seeing that their mother  had no fear, they took courage, and watched them with intense interest.  Was it the wild, clanging cry that moved them, or was it solely the  inner prompting then come to the surface? A strange longing to follow  took possession of each of the young ones. They watched those arrowy  trumpeters fading away to the south, and sought out higher perches to  watch them farther yet, and from that time things were no more the same.  The November moon was waxing, and when it was full, the November madness  came.    The least vigorous of the flock were most affected. The little family  was scattered. Redruff himself flew on several long erratic night  journeys. The impulse took him southward, out there lay the boundless  stretch of Lake Ontario, so he turned again, and the waning of the Mad  Moon found him once more in the Mud Creek Glen, but absolutely alone.          V      Food grew scarce as winter wore on. Redruff clung to the old ravine and  the piney sides of Taylor's Hill, but every month brought its food and  its foes. The Mad Moon brought madness, solitude, and grapes; the Snow  Moon came with rosehips; and the Stormy Moon brought browse of birch and  silver storms that sheathed the woods in ice, and made it hard to keep  one's perch while pulling off the frozen buds. Redruff's beak grew  terribly worn with the work, so that even when closed there was still an  opening through behind the hook. But nature had prepared him for the  slippery footing; his toes, so slim and trim in September, had sprouted  rows of sharp, horny points, and these grew with the growing cold, till  the first snow had found him fully equipped with snowshoes and  ice-creepers. The cold weather had driven away most of the hawks and  owls, and made it impossible for his four-footed enemies to approach  unseen, so that things were nearly balanced.    His flight in search of food had daily led him farther on, till he had  discovered and explored the Rosedale Creek, with its banks of  silver-birch, and Castle Frank, with its grapes and rowan berries, as  well as Chester woods, where amelanchier and Virginia-creeper swung  their fruit-bunches, and checkerberries glowed beneath the snow.    He soon found out that for some strange reason men with guns did not go  within the high fence of Castle-Frank. So among these scenes he lived  his life, learning new places, new foods, and grew wiser and more  beautiful every day.    He was quite alone so far as kindred were concerned, but that scarcely  seemed a hardship. Wherever he went he could see the jolly chickadees  scrambling merrily about, and he remembered the time when they had  seemed such big, important creatures. They were the most absurdly  cheerful things in the woods. Before the autumn was fairly over they had  begun to sing their famous refrain, '_Spring Soon_,' and kept it up with  good heart more or less all through the winter's direst storms, till at  length the waning of the Hungry Moon, our February, seemed really to  lend some point to the ditty, and they redoubled their optimistic  announcement to the world in an 'I-told-you-so' mood. Soon good support  was found, for the sun gained strength and melted the snow from the  southern slope of Castle Frank Hill, and exposed great banks of fragrant  wintergreen, whose berries were a bounteous feast for Redruff, and,  ending the hard work of pulling frozen browse, gave his bill the needed  chance to grow into its proper shape again. Very soon the first bluebird  came flying over and warbled as he flew '_The spring is coming_.' The  sun kept gaining, and early one day in the dark of the Wakening Moon of  March there was a loud '_Caw, caw_,' and old Silverspot, the king-crow,  came swinging along from the south at the head of his troops and  officially announced         'THE SPRING HAS COME.'    All nature seemed to respond to this, the opening of the birds' New  Year, and yet it was something within that chiefly seemed to move them.  The chickadees went simply wild; they sang their '_Spring now, spring  now now--Spring now now_,'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14241"],[0,"More English Fairy Tales (#6)"],[1,"\"Ho, ho, Tom!\" says he. \"Thou 'st thanked me, my lad, and  I told thee not, I told thee not!\"    \"I don't want thy help, I tell thee,\" Tom yelled at him--\"I only want  never to see thee again, and to have nought more to do with 'ee--thou  can go.\"    The thing only laughed and screeched and mocked, as long as Tom went on  swearing, but so soon as his breath gave out--    \"Tom, my lad,\" he said with a grin, \"I'll tell 'ee summat, Tom. True's  true I'll never help thee again, and call as thou wilt, thou 'lt never  see me after to-day; but I never said that I'd leave thee alone, Tom,  and I never will, my lad! I was nice and safe under the stone, Tom, and  could do no harm; but thou let me out thyself, and thou can't put me  back again! I would have been thy friend and worked for thee if thou had  been wise; but since thou bee'st no more than a born fool I'll give 'ee  no more than a born fool's luck; and when all goes vicey-varsy, and  everything agee--thou 'lt mind that it's Yallery Brown's doing though  m'appen thou doesn't see him. Mark my words, will 'ee?\"    And he began to sing, dancing round Tom, like a bairn with his yellow  hair, but looking older than ever with his grinning wrinkled bit of a  face:                 \"Work as thou will                Thou 'lt never do well;                Work as thou mayst                Thou 'lt never gain grist;       For harm and mischance and Yallery Brown       Thou 'st let out thyself from under the stone.\"    Tom could never rightly mind what he said next. 'T was all cussing and  calling down misfortune on him; but he was so mazed in fright that he  could only stand there shaking all over, and staring down at the horrid  thing; and if he'd gone on long, Tom would have tumbled down in a fit.  But by-and-by, his yaller shining hair rose up in the air, and wrapt  itself round him till he looked for all the world like a great dandelion  puff; and it floated away on the wind over the wall and out o' sight,  with a parting skirl of wicked voice and sneering laugh.    And did it come true, sayst thou? My word! but it did, sure as death! He  worked here and he worked there, and turned his hand to this and to  that, but it always went agee, and 't was all Yallery Brown's doing. And  the children died, and the crops rotted--the beasts never fatted, and  nothing ever did well with him; and till he was dead and buried, and  m'appen even afterwards, there was no end to Yallery Brown's spite at  him; day in and day out he used to hear him saying--                  \"Work as thou wilt                 Thou 'lt never do well;                 Work as thou mayst                 Thou 'lt never gain grist;       For harm and mischance and Yallery Brown       Thou 'st let out thyself from under the stone.\"          Three Feathers      Once upon a time there was a girl who was married to a husband that she  never saw. And the way this was, was that he was only at home at night,  and would never have any light in the house. The girl thought that was  funny, and all her friends told her there must be something wrong with  her husband, some great deformity that made him want not to be seen.    Well, one night when he came home she suddenly lit a candle and saw him.  He was handsome enough to make all the women of the world fall in love  with him. But scarcely had she seen him when he began to change into a  bird, and then he said: \"Now you have seen me, you shall see me no more,  unless you are willing to serve seven years and a day for me, so that I  may become a man once more.\" Then he told her to take three feathers  from under his side, and whatever she wished through them would come to  pass. Then he left her at a great house to be laundry-maid for seven  years and a day.    And the girl used to take the feathers and say:    \"By virtue of my three feathers may the copper be lit, and the clothes  washed, and mangled, and folded, and put away to the missus's  satisfaction.\"    And then she had no more care about it. The feathers did the rest, and  the lady set great store by her for a better laundress she had never  had. Well, one day the butler, who had a notion to have the pretty  laundry-maid for his wife, said to her, he should have spoken before but  he did not want to vex her. \"Why should it when I am but a  fellow-servant?\" the girl said. And then he felt free to go on, and  explain he had L70 laid by with the master, and how would she like him  for a husband.    And the girl told him to fetch her the money, and he asked his master  for it, and brought it to her. But as they were going upstairs, she  cried, \"O John, I must go back, sure I've left my shutters undone, and  they'll be slashing and banging all night.\"    The butler said, \"Never you trouble, I'll put them right.\" and he ran  back, while she took her feathers, and said: \"By virtue of my three  feathers may the shutters slash and bang till morning, and John not be  able to fasten them nor yet to get his fingers free from them.\"    And so it was. Try as he might the butler could not leave hold, nor yet  keep the shutters from blowing open as he closed them. And he _was_  angry, but could not help himself, and he did not care to tell of it and  get the laugh on him, so no one knew.    Then after a bit the coachman began to notice her, and she found he had  some L40 with the master, and he said she might have it if she would  take him with it.    So after the laundry-maid had his money in her apron as they went  merrily along, she stopt, exclaiming: \"My clothes are left outside, I  must run back and bring them in.\" \"Stop for me while I go; it is a cold  frost night,\" said William, \"you'd be catching your death.\" So the girl  waited long enough to take her feathers out and say, \"By virtue of my  three feathers may the clothes slash and blow about till morning, and  may William not be able to take his hand from them nor yet to gather  them up.\" And then she was away to bed and to sleep.    The coachman did not want to be every one's jest, and he said nothing.  So after a bit the footman comes to her and said he: \"I have been with  my master for years and have saved up a good bit, and you have been  three years here, and must have saved up as well. Let us put it  together, and make us a home or else stay on at service as pleases you.\"  Well, she got him to bring the savings to her as the others had, and  then she pretended she was faint, and said to him: \"James, I feel so  queer, run down cellar for me, that's a dear, and fetch me up a drop of  brandy.\" Now no sooner had he started than she said: \"By virtue of my  three feathers may there be slashing and spilling, and James not be able  to pour the brandy straight nor yet to take his hand from it until  morning.\"    And so it was. Try as he might James could not get his glass filled, and  there was slashing and spilling, and right on it all, down came the  master to know what it meant!    So James told him he could not make it out, but he could not get the  drop of brandy the laundry-maid had asked for, and his hand would shake  and spill everything, and yet come away he could not.    This got him in for a regular scrape, and the master when he got back to  his wife said: \"What has come over the men, they were all right until  that laundry-maid of yours came. Something is up now though. They have  all drawn out their pay, and yet they don't leave, and what can it be  anyway?\"    But his wife said she could not hear of the laundry-maid being blamed,  for she was the best servant she had and worth all the rest put  together.    So it went on until one day as the girl stood in the hall door, the  coachman happened to say to the footman: \"Do you know how that girl  served me, James?\" And then William told about the clothes. The butler  put in, \"That was nothing to what she served me,\" and he told of the  shutters clapping all night.    Just then the master came through the hall, and the girl said: \"By  virtue of my three feathers may there be slashing and striving between  master and men, and may all get splashed in the pond.\"    And so it was, the men fell to disputing which had suffered the most by  her, and when the master came up all would be heard at once and none  listened to him, and it came to blows all round, and the first they knew  they had shoved one another into the pond.    When the girl thought they had had enough she took the spell off, and  the master asked her what had begun the row, for he had not heard in the  confusion.    And the girl said: \"They were ready to fall on any one; they'd have beat  me if you had not come by.\"    So it blew over for that time, and through her feathers she made the  best laundress ever known. But to make a long story short, when the  seven years and a day were up, the bird-husband, who had known her  doings all along, came after her, restored to his own shape again. And  he told her mistress he had come to take her from being a servant, and  that she should have servants under her. But he did not tell of the  feathers.    And then he bade her give the men back their savings.    \"That was a rare game you had with them,\" said he, \"but now you are  going where there is plenty, leave them each their own.\" So she did; and  they drove off to their castle, where they lived happy ever after.          Sir Gammer Vans      Last Sunday morning at six o'clock in the evening as I was sailing over  the tops of the mountains in my little boat, I met two men on horseback  riding on one mare: So I asked them, \"Could they tell me whether the  little old woman was dead yet who was hanged last Saturday week for  drowning herself in a shower of feathers?\" They said they could not  positively inform me, but if I went to Sir Gammer Vans he could tell me  all about it. \"But how am I to know the house?\" said I. \"Ho, 't is easy  enough,\" said they, \"for 't is a brick house, built entirely of flints,  standing alone by itself in the middle of sixty or"]]]
