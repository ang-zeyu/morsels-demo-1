He was clad in rags, was very emaciated,  and bore every trace of prolonged hardship.  So far as I could  understand the account of the natives, he was a complete stranger to  them, and had come upon their village through the woods alone and in  the last stage of exhaustion.    \"The man's knapsack lay beside the couch, and I examined the contents.  His name was written upon a tab within it--Maple White, Lake Avenue,  Detroit, Michigan.  It is a name to which I am prepared always to lift  my hat.  It is not too much to say that it will rank level with my own  when the final credit of this business comes to be apportioned.    \"From the contents of the knapsack it was evident that this man had  been an artist and poet in search of effects.  There were scraps of  verse.  I do not profess to be a judge of such things, but they  appeared to me to be singularly wanting in merit.  There were also some  rather commonplace pictures of river scenery, a paint-box, a box of  colored chalks, some brushes, that curved bone which lies upon my  inkstand, a volume of Baxter's 'Moths and Butterflies,' a cheap  revolver, and a few cartridges.  Of personal equipment he either had  none or he had lost it in his journey.  Such were the total effects of  this strange American Bohemian.    \"I was turning away from him when I observed that something projected  from the front of his ragged jacket.  It was this sketch-book, which  was as dilapidated then as you see it now.  Indeed, I can assure you  that a first folio of Shakespeare could not be treated with greater  reverence than this relic has been since it came into my possession.  I  hand it to you now, and I ask you to take it page by page and to  examine the contents.\"    He helped himself to a cigar and leaned back with a fiercely critical  pair of eyes, taking note of the effect which this document would  produce.    I had opened the volume with some expectation of a revelation, though  of what nature I could not imagine.  The first page was disappointing,  however, as it contained nothing but the picture of a very fat man in a  pea-jacket, with the legend, \"Jimmy Colver on the Mail-boat,\" written  beneath it.  There followed several pages which were filled with small  sketches of Indians and their ways.  Then came a picture of a cheerful  and corpulent ecclesiastic in a shovel hat, sitting opposite a very  thin European, and the inscription:  \"Lunch with Fra Cristofero at  Rosario.\"  Studies of women and babies accounted for several more  pages, and then there was an unbroken series of animal drawings with  such explanations as \"Manatee upon Sandbank,\" \"Turtles and Their Eggs,\"  \"Black Ajouti under a Miriti Palm\"--the matter disclosing some sort of  pig-like animal; and finally came a double page of studies of  long-snouted and very unpleasant saurians.  I could make nothing of it,  and said so to the Professor.    \"Surely these are only crocodiles?\"    \"Alligators!  Alligators!  There is hardly such a thing as a true  crocodile in South America.  The distinction between them----\"    \"I meant that I could see nothing unusual--nothing to justify what you  have said.\"    He smiled serenely.    \"Try the next page,\" said he.    I was still unable to sympathize.  It was a full-page sketch of a  landscape roughly tinted in color--the kind of painting which an  open-air artist takes as a guide to a future more elaborate effort.  There was a pale-green foreground of feathery vegetation, which sloped  upwards and ended in a line of cliffs dark red in color, and curiously  ribbed like some basaltic formations which I have seen.  They extended  in an unbroken wall right across the background.  At one point was an  isolated pyramidal rock, crowned by a great tree, which appeared to be  separated by a cleft from the main crag.  Behind it all, a blue  tropical sky.  A thin green line of vegetation fringed the summit of  the ruddy cliff.    \"Well?\" he asked.    \"It is no doubt a curious formation,\" said I \"but I am not geologist  enough to say that it is wonderful.\"    \"Wonderful!\" he repeated.  \"It is unique.  It is incredible.  No one on  earth has ever dreamed of such a possibility.  Now the next.\"    I turned it over, and gave an exclamation of surprise.  There was a  full-page picture of the most extraordinary creature that I had ever  seen.  It was the wild dream of an opium smoker, a vision of delirium.  The head was like that of a fowl, the body that of a bloated lizard,  the trailing tail was furnished with upward-turned spikes, and the  curved back was edged with a high serrated fringe, which looked like a  dozen cocks' wattles placed behind each other.  In front of this  creature was an absurd mannikin, or dwarf, in human form, who stood  staring at it.    \"Well, what do you think of that?\" cried the Professor, rubbing his  hands with an air of triumph.    \"It is monstrous--grotesque.\"    \"But what made him draw such an animal?\"    \"Trade gin, I should think.\"    \"Oh, that's the best explanation you can give, is it?\"    \"Well, sir, what is yours?\"    \"The obvious one that the creature exists.  That is actually sketched  from the life.\"    I should have laughed only that I had a vision of our doing another  Catharine-wheel down the passage.    \"No doubt,\" said I, \"no doubt,\" as one humors an imbecile.  \"I confess,  however,\" I added, \"that this tiny human figure puzzles me.  If it were  an Indian we could set it down as evidence of some pigmy race in  America, but it appears to be a European in a sun-hat.\"    The Professor snorted like an angry buffalo.  \"You really touch the  limit,\" said he.  \"You enlarge my view of the possible.  Cerebral  paresis!  Mental inertia!  Wonderful!\"    He was too absurd to make me angry.  Indeed, it was a waste of energy,  for if you were going to be angry with this man you would be angry all  the time.  I contented myself with smiling wearily.  \"It struck me that  the man was small,\" said I.    \"Look here!\" he cried, leaning forward and dabbing a great hairy  sausage of a finger on to the picture.  \"You see that plant behind the  animal; I suppose you thought it was a dandelion or a Brussels  sprout--what?  Well, it is a vegetable ivory palm, and they run to  about fifty or sixty feet.  Don't you see that the man is put in for a  purpose?  He couldn't really have stood in front of that brute and  lived to draw it.  He sketched himself in to give a scale of heights.  He was, we will say, over five feet high.  The tree is ten times  bigger, which is what one would expect.\"    \"Good heavens!\" I cried.  \"Then you think the beast was---- Why,  Charing Cross station would hardly make a kennel for such a brute!\"    \"Apart from exaggeration, he is certainly a well-grown specimen,\" said  the Professor, complacently.    \"But,\" I cried, \"surely the whole experience of the human race is not  to be set aside on account of a single sketch\"--I had turned over the  leaves and ascertained that there was nothing more in the book--\"a  single sketch by a wandering American artist who may have done it under  hashish, or in the delirium of fever, or simply in order to gratify a  freakish imagination.  You can't, as a man of science, defend such a  position as that.\"    For answer the Professor took a book down from a shelf.    \"This is an excellent monograph by my gifted friend, Ray Lankester!\"  said he.  \"There is an illustration here which would interest you.  Ah,  yes, here it is!  The inscription beneath it runs:  'Probable  appearance in life of the Jurassic Dinosaur Stegosaurus.  The hind leg  alone is twice as tall as a full-grown man.'  Well, what do you make of  that?\"    He handed me the open book.  I started as I looked at the picture.  In  this reconstructed animal of a dead world there was certainly a very  great resemblance to the sketch of the unknown artist.    \"That is certainly remarkable,\" said I.    \"But you won't admit that it is final?\"    \"Surely it might be a coincidence, or this American may have seen a  picture of the kind and carried it in his memory.  It would be likely  to recur to a man in a delirium.\"    \"Very good,\" said the Professor, indulgently; \"we leave it at that.  I  will now ask you to look at this bone.\" He handed over the one which he  had already described as part of the dead man's possessions.  It was  about six inches long, and thicker than my thumb, with some indications  of dried cartilage at one end of it.    \"To what known creature does that bone belong?\" asked the Professor.    I examined it with care and tried to recall some half-forgotten  knowledge.    \"It might be a very thick human collar-bone,\" I said.    My companion waved his hand in contemptuous deprecation.    \"The human collar-bone is curved.  This is straight.  There is a groove  upon its surface showing that a great tendon played across it, which  could not be the case with a clavicle.\"    \"Then I must confess that I don't know what it is.\"    \"You need not be ashamed to expose your ignorance, for I don't suppose  the whole South Kensington staff could give a name to it.\" He took a  little bone the size of a bean out of a pill-box.  \"So far as I am a  judge this human bone is the analogue of the one which you hold in your  hand.  That will give you some idea of the size of the creature.  You  will observe from the cartilage that this is no fossil specimen, but  recent.  What do you say to that?\"    \"Surely in an elephant----\"    He winced as if in pain.    \"Don't!  Don't talk of elephants in South America.  Even in these days  of Board schools----\"    \"Well,\" I interrupted, \"any large South American animal--a tapir, for  example.\"    \"You may take it, young man, that I am versed in the elements of my  business.  This is not a conceivable bone either of a tapir or of any  other creature known to zoology.  It belongs to a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1390"],[0,"The Jimmyjohn Boss, and Other Stories (#6)"],[1,"one.\"    He and Bolles heard them enter the next room, always without much noise  or talk--the loudest sound was the jug when they set it on the floor.  Then they seemed to sit, talking little.    \"Bolles,\" said Drake, \"the sun has set. If you want to take after Sam--\"    But the door of the sitting-room opened and the Chinaman himself came  in. He left the door a-swing and spoke clearly. \"Misser Dlake,\" said he,  \"slove bloke\" (stove broke).    The superintendent came out of his office, following Sam to the kitchen.  He gave no look or word to the buccaroos with their demijohn; he merely  held his cigar sidewise in his teeth and walked with no hurry through  the sitting-room. Sam took him through to the kitchen and round to a  hind corner of the stove, pointing.    \"Misser Dlake,\" said he, \"slove no bloke. I hear them inside. They going  kill you.\"    \"That's about the way I was figuring it,\" mused Dean Drake.    \"Misser Dlake,\" said the Chinaman, with appealing eyes, \"I velly solly  you. They no hurtee me. Me cook.\"    \"Sam, there is much meat in your words. Condensed beef don't class with  you. But reserve your sorrows yet a while. Now what's my policy?\" he  debated, tapping the stove here and there for appearances; somebody  might look in. \"Shall I go back to my office and get my guns?\"    \"You not goin' run now?\" said the Chinaman, anxiously.    \"Oh yes, Sam. But I like my gun travelling. Keeps me kind of warm. Now  if they should get a sight of me arming--no, she's got to stay here till  I come back for her. So long, Sam! See you later. And I'll have time to  thank you then.\"    Drake went to the corral in a strolling manner. There he roped the  strongest of the horses, and also the school-master's. In the midst of  his saddling, Bolles came down.    \"Can I help you in any way?\" said Bolles.    \"You've done it. Saved me a bothering touch-and-go play to get you out  here and seem innocent. I'm going to drift.\"    \"Drift?\"    \"There are times to stay and times to leave, Bolles; and this is a case  of the latter. Have you a real gun on now?\"    Poor Bolles brought out guiltily his.22 Smith & Wesson. \"I don't seem to  think of things,\" said he.    \"Cheer up,\" said Drake. \"How could you thought-read me? Hide Baby  Bunting, though. Now we're off. Quietly, at the start. As if we were  merely jogging to pasture.\"    Sam stood at his kitchen door, mutely wishing them well. The horses were  walking without noise, but Half-past Full looked out of the window.    \"We're by, anyhow,\" said Drake. \"Quick now. Burn the earth.\" The  horse sprang at his spurs. \"Dust, you son of a gun! Rattle your hocks!  Brindle! Vamoose!\" Each shouted word was a lash with his quirt. \"Duck!\"  he called to Bolles.    Bolles ducked, and bullets grooved the spraying snow. They rounded a  corner and saw the crowd jumping into the corral, and Sam's door empty  of that prudent Celestial.    \"He's a very wise Chinaman!\" shouted Drake, as they rushed.    \"What?\" screamed Bolles.    \"Very wise Chinaman. He'll break that stove now to prove his innocence.\"    \"Who did you say was innocent?\" screamed Bolles.    \"Oh, I said you were,\" yelled Drake, disgusted; and he gave over this  effort at conversation as their horses rushed along.      V    It was a dim, wide stretch of winter into which Drake and Bolles  galloped from the howling pursuit. Twilight already veiled the base of  Castle Rock, and as they forged heavily up a ridge through the caking  snow, and the yells came after them, Bolles looked seriously at Dean  Drake; but that youth wore an expression of rising merriment. Bolles  looked back at the dusk from which the yells were sounding, then forward  to the spreading skein of night where the trail was taking him and the  boy, and in neither direction could he discern cause for gayety.    \"May I ask where we are going?\" said he.    \"Away,\" Drake answered. \"Just away, Bolles. It's a healthy resort.\"    Ten miles were travelled before either spoke again. The drunken  buccaroos yelled hot on their heels at first, holding more obstinately  to this chase than sober ruffians would have attempted. Ten cold, dark  miles across the hills it took to cure them; but when their shootings,  that had followed over heights where the pines grew and down through  the open swales between, dropped off, and died finally away among the  willows along the south fork of the Malheur, Drake reined in his horse  with a jerk.    \"Now isn't that too bad!\" he exclaimed.    \"It is all very bad,\" said Bolles, sorry to hear the boy's tone of  disappointment.    \"I didn't think they'd fool me again,\" continued Drake, jumping down.    \"Again?\" inquired the interested Bolles.    \"Why, they've gone home!\" said the boy, in disgust.    \"I was hoping so,\" said the school-master.    \"Hoping? Why, it's sad, Bolles. Four miles farther and I'd have had them  lost.\"    \"Oh!\" said Bolles.    \"I wanted them to keep after us,\" complained Drake. \"Soon as we had a  good lead I coaxed them. Coaxed them along on purpose by a trail they  knew, and four miles from here I'd have swung south into the mountains  they don't know. There they'd have been good and far from home in the  snow without supper, like you and me, Bolles. But after all my trouble  they've gone back snug to that fireside. Well, let us be as cosey as we  can.\"    He built a bright fire, and he whistled as he kicked the snow from his  boots, busying over the horses and the blankets. \"Take a rest,\" he said  to Bolles. \"One man's enough to do the work. Be with you soon to share  our little cottage.\" Presently Bolles heard him reciting confidentially  to his horse, \"Twas the night after Christmas, and all in the  house--only we are not all in the house!\" He slapped the belly of his  horse Tyee, who gambolled away to the limit of his picket-rope.    \"Appreciating the moon, Bolles?\" said he, returning at length to the  fire. \"What are you so gazeful about, father?\"    \"This is all my own doing,\" lamented the school-master.    \"What, the moon is?\"    \"It has just come over me,\" Bolles continued. \"It was before you got in  the stage at Nampa. I was talking. I told Uncle Pasco that I was glad no  whiskey was to be allowed on the ranch. It all comes from my folly!\"    \"Why, you hungry old New England conscience!\" cried the boy, clapping  him on the shoulder. \"How in the world could you foresee the crookedness  of that hoary Beelzebub?\"    \"That's all very well,\" said Bolles, miserably. \"You would never have  mentioned it yourself to him.\"    \"You and I, Bolles, are different. I was raised on miscellaneous  wickedness. A look at my insides would be liable to make you say your  prayers.\"    The school-master smiled. \"If I said any prayers,\" he replied, \"you  would be in them.\"    Drake looked moodily at the fire. \"The Lord helps those who help  themselves,\" said he. \"I've prospered. For a nineteen-year-old I've  hooked my claw fairly deep here and there. As for to-day--why, that's  in the game too. It was their deal. Could they have won it on their own  play? A joker dropped into their hand. It's my deal now, and I have some  jokers myself. Go to sleep, Bolles. We've a ride ahead of us.\"    The boy rolled himself in his blanket skillfully. Bolles heard him say  once or twice in a sort of judicial conversation with the blanket--\"and  all in the house--but we were not all in the house. Not all. Not a full  house--\" His tones drowsed comfortably into murmur, and then to quiet  breathing. Bolles fed the fire, thatched the unneeded wind-break (for  the calm, dry night was breathless), and for a long while watched the  moon and a tuft of the sleeping boy's hair.    \"If he is blamed,\" said the school-master, \"I'll never forgive myself.  I'll never forgive myself anyhow.\"    A paternal, or rather maternal, expression came over Bolles's face, and  he removed his large, serious glasses. He did not sleep very well.    The boy did. \"I'm feeling like a bird,\" said he, as they crossed through  the mountains next morning on a short cut to the Owybee. \"Breakfast will  brace you up, Bolles. There'll be a cabin pretty soon after we strike  the other road. Keep thinking hard about coffee.\"    \"I wish I could,\" said poor Bolles. He was forgiving himself less and  less.    Their start had been very early; as Drake bid the school-master observe,  to have nothing to detain you, nothing to eat and nothing to pack, is a  great help in journeys of haste. The warming day, and Indian Creek well  behind them, brought Drake to whistling again, but depression sat upon  the self-accusing Bolles. Even when they sighted the Owyhee road below  them, no cheerfulness waked in him; not at the nearing coffee, nor  yet at the companionable tinkle of sleigh-bells dancing faintly upward  through the bright, silent air.    \"Why, if it ain't Uncle Pasco!\" said Drake, peering down through a gap  in the foot-hill. \"We'll get breakfast sooner than I expected. Quick!  Give me Baby Bunting!\"    \"Are you going to kill him?\" whispered the school-master, with a beaming  countenance. And he scuffled with his pocket to hand over his hitherto  belittled weapon.    Drake considered him. \"Bolles, Bolles,\" said he, \"you have got the  New England conscience rank. Plymouth Rock is a pudding to your heart.  Remind me to pray for you first spare minute I get. Now follow me close.  He'll be much more useful to us alive.\"    They slipped from their horses, stole swiftly down a shoulder of the  hill, and waited among some brush. The bells jingled unsuspectingly  onward to this ambush.    \"Only hear 'em!\" said Drake. \"All full of silver and Merry Christmas.  Don't gaze at me like that, Bolles, or I'll laugh and give the whole  snap away. See him come! The old man's breath streams out so calm. He's  not worried with New England conscience. One, two, three\" Just before  the sleigh came opposite, Dean Drake stepped out. \"Morning, Uncle!\" said  he. \"Throw up your hands!\"    Uncle Pasco stopped dead, his eyes "]]]
