Amusements are at all times among the best indications of      national character; a truth which the ancients seem to have      exaggerated into their maxim _in vino veritas_. Here the      national comparison is not \"odious.\" Three Sunday fairs are held      within six miles of Paris, in a park, as was once the custom at      Greenwich: the latter, though a royal park, does not boast of      the residence of royalty, as does St Cloud. The objection to the      day of the French fetes is cleared by another argument. But what      would be the character of a week-day fair, or fete, in      Kensington Gardens? The intuitive answer will make the moral      observer regret that man should so often place the interdict on      his own happiness, and then peevishly repine at his uncheery      lot.    Night, with her poetic glooms, only served to heighten the lustre of the  fairy fete; and as I receded through the wood, the little shoal of light  gleamed and twinkled through \"branches overgrown,\" and the distant  sounds began to fall into solitary silence--even saddening to  meditation--so fast do the dying glories of festive mirth sink into  melancholy--till at once, with the last gleam and echo, I found myself  in a pleasant little glade on the brow of the hill. The day had been  unusually hot--all was hushed stillness. But the darkening clouds were  fast gathering into black masses:--      The rapid lightning flames along the sky.    What terrible event does this portend?    The stifling heat of the atmosphere was, however, soon changed by slight  gusts of wind; the leaves trembled; and a few heavy drops of rain fell  as harbingers of the coming storm; the pattering ceased; an impressive  pause succeeded--broken by the deepening roar of thunder.    The threatening storm hastened my return to the focus of the carnival.  The partial sprinkling had already caused many of the dancers to  withdraw to the cafes, and to the most sheltered parts of the park. The  lightning became more and more vivid; and, at length, the thousands who  had lingered in these groups of gaiety, were fairly routed by pelting  rain; and the park, with a few lamps flickering out, and decorative  finery drenched with rain, presented a miserable contrast with the  festivities of the previous hour. The crowd streamed through the  park-gate into the village, where hundreds of competitors shouted  \"Paris, Paris;\" and their swarms of diligences, cabriolets, and  curtained carts, were soon freighted. One of these charioteers engaged  to convey me to Paris for half a franc, in a large, covered cart, with  oil-skin curtains to protect the passengers in front. To my surprise I  found the vehicle pre-occupied by twelve or fourteen well-dressed  persons--male and female, who appeared to forget their inconvenient  situation in sallies of laughter, which sometimes bordered on boisterous  mirth. The storm increased; lamps gleamed and flitted across the road;  many of the horses plunged with their heavy loads, and swept along the  line in resistless confusion; for nothing can be less characteristic of  timidity than French driving.    On reaching Paris, the streets resembled so many torrents, and in most  places were not fordable, notwithstanding scores of persons, with the  alacrity of mushrooms after rain, had placed themselves at the narrowest  parts of the streams, with raised planks, or temporary bridges for  crossing. Our load was _landed_ under the arcade of the Hotel de Ville;  but the driver, in the genuine spirit of a London hackney-coachman, did  not forget to turn the \"ill-wind\" to his own account, by importuning me  for a double fare.    I learned that the storm had been less tremendous in its consequences at  St. Cloud and Paris than at Versailles, the lightning having consumed a  farm-house and barns near that town. It is an event worthy of notice,  from its being part of the phenomenon of what is termed a returning  stroke of lightning, the circumstances of which are recorded in a recent  number of Brande's philosophical journal.--_Abridged from \"Cameleon  Sketches,\" by the author of the \"Promenade round Dorking.\"_           *       *       *       *       *        RETROSPECTIVE GLEANINGS.             *       *       *       *       *      ALFREDE AND MATYLDA.

It seems to me  both cruel and dangerous.\"    Cruelty! Is there cruelty in laying the rein on their necks, and  delivering them up to the transport of their high condition--for every  throbbing vein is visible--at the first full burst of that maddening  cry, and letting loose to their delight the living thunderbolts? Danger!  What danger but breaking their own legs, necks, or backs, and those of  their riders? And what right have you to complain of that, lying all  your length, a huge hulking fellow snoring and snorting half asleep on a  sofa, sufficient to sicken a whole street? What though it be but a  smallish, reddish-brown, sharp-nosed animal, with pricked-up ears, and  passionately fond of poultry, that they pursue? After the first tallyho,  Reynard is rarely seen, till he is run in upon--once perhaps in the  whole run, skirting a wood, or crossing a common. It is an idea that is  pursued, on a whirlwind of horses to a storm of canine music,--worthy,  both, of the largest lion that ever leaped among a band of Moors,  sleeping at midnight by an extinguished fire on the African sands. There  is, we verily believe it, nothing foxy in the fancy of one man in all  that glorious field of three hundred. Once off and away--while wood and  welkin rings--and nothing is felt--nothing is imaged in that hurricane  flight, but scorn of all obstructions, dikes, ditches, drains, brooks,  palings, canals, rivers, and all the impediments reared in the way of so  many rejoicing madmen, by nature, art, and science, in an enclosed,  cultivated, civilized, and Christian country. There they go--prince and  peer, baronet and squire,--the nobility and gentry of England, the  flower of the men of the earth, each on such steed as Pollux never  reined, nor Philip's warlike son--for could we imagine Bucephalus here,  ridden by his own tamer, Alexander would be thrown out during the very  first burst, and glad to find his way dismounted to a village alehouse  for a pail of meal and water. Hedges, trees, groves, gardens, orchards,  woods, farm-houses, huts, halls, mansions, palaces, spires, steeples,  towers, and temples, all go wavering by, each demigod seeing, or seeing  them not, as his winged steed skims or labours along, to the swelling or  sinking music, now loud as a near regimental band, now faint as an echo.

Volume 10, No. 271, (#6)"],[1,"more polished, but not,  perhaps, more happy. Still the custom of inordinate potation fondly  clung to him. Immediately contiguous to every mansion of any magnitude  was erected a summerhouse, usually situated in a spot, selected for the  beauty of the scene which it commanded; and to this _sanctum_ did the  gentlemen retire after dinner, to enjoy, unrestrained by the presence of  the ladies, a full indulgence in that boisterous carousal, which their  bluff hearts so dearly loved. But these good and glorious customs have  died the death, and gone the way, of all perishable things; _they_ are  gone, as are those jovial souls who gave them life and buoyancy; but the  eternal hills, which echoed to their merriment and glee--they remain  unaltered by time, and unshaken by the storms which have passed over  them.    Yet is there still much jovial heartiness in the festive revelry of the  mountaineers. One scene, in which I was a participator, I will endeavour  to portray--it is impressed on my memory by more than one token of  grateful reminiscence. It was in the summer of 1825 that I left London  for a few weeks, and sought among my native hills a reparation of the  wear and tear of half-a-dozen years of hard and unceasing toil. Two days  after my arrival In Merionethshire was celebrated the birthday of Robert  Williams Vaughan, Esq., of Nannau, the only son of Sir Robert Williams  Vaughan, Bart., and member for the county; a gentleman of whom it may be  truly said, that his heart is replete with every noble and benevolent  attribute, and that his mind is dignified by practical wisdom, sound  sense, and energy to direct, for the benefit of his dependents, the fine  and Christian virtues which he possesses. \"Come up to Nannau,\" is his  encouraging address to the labourer, when the hardships of winter are  pressing upon the poor: \"Come up to Nannau, show me that you are willing  to work, and I will give you your wages.\" It is for benevolence like  this, well and usefully exercised, that Sir Robert Vaughan is especially  remarkable, as well also for all those qualities which adorn and dignify  the British country gentleman. Always careful of the welfare, habits,  and comforts of the poor around him; patronizing the industry,  ingenuity, and good conduct of his more humble countrymen, and  ministering to the wants of the sick and the poor; hospitable in the  extreme; kind, affable, and friendly to all, he fulfils in every respect  the happy duties of the wealthy British landholder; and by his generous  courtesy he has ensured to himself the perfect esteem of every person  who knows him. Living in the midst of a cheerful and contented tenantry,  the chieftain as it were of a devoted clan, the proprietor of Nannau may  be truly termed a happy man. The empty blandishments of the world have  no charms for him, nor have its ephemeral pleasures any allurement; for,  like the gallant knight of Peugwern, when invited by Henry the Seventh  to share the honors of his court, for services rendered at Bosworth  Field, he would meekly but promptly reply, \"Sire! I love to dwell among  mine own people.\" Such is Sir Robert Vaughan of Nannau, whose memory  will be long and fondly cherished by those who have enjoyed his  friendship, and witnessed his calm, manly, and useful virtues.    We sat down to dinner, about forty in number, occupying two tables  placed parallel to each other, in the spacious dining-room of the  mansion. Choice fish of every kind; venison from Nannau Park, celebrated  for the delicious flavour of its fat bucks; mountain-mutton, from the  fertile pastures of Llanfachreth; the noble sirloin, and, in fact, every  substantial delicacy that wealth could procure, pressed even to groaning  the broad tables of our host; while the harper in the hall twanged his  instrument with a force and a fury, that plainly showed his previous  intimacy with the good cheer of the place. But noble and magnificent  as our entertainment was in the eating department, it was infinitely  surpassed by that which was devoted to the orgies of Bacchus. No sooner  was the brief and scarcely audible grace pronounced by the chaplain,  than in marched old Pearson, the gray-headed butler, bearing in each  hand a goblet, in form like an acorn, and fashioned of the dark polished  oak of the far-famed Spirits-Blasted Tree,[7] richly ornamented with  appropriate silver emblems. One of these was placed reversed by the side  of the president and _croupier_ of each table, and presently afterwards  flanked by a huge silver tankard of foaming ale, strong enough almost to  blow into the air a first-rate man-of-war. Filling this goblet, which  held very nearly a pint, the president made his speech to the health and  happiness of the young 'squire, and draining it dry, passed it on to his  left-hand neighbour. The _croupier_ did the same, and like the great  bear of Bradwardine, did the acorn of Nannau begin to make its rounds,  in a manner quite as fearful to me as was the terrific approach of the  bear aforesaid to the heir of Waverley Honor. Unfortunately for me, I  sat between two determined and well-seasoned topers, who took especial  care that I should not only fill to each toast, but drain the cup to  the very bottom; so that, novice as I was in this sort of hilarity, I  found myself, in a very short time, lying down under a laburnum tree  in the lawn, and composing myself very comfortably--no, not _very_  comfortably--to sleep. I had my sleep, however; and when I awoke and  re-entered the house, a merry group of guests had surrounded the harper  in the hall, and were singing Penillion at full stretch, to the now  unsteady and somewhat discordant accompaniment of the minstrel; the  laugh was of course against me, but good-nature, rather than contempt,  characterised the bantering, and I bore it all in good part. The party  broke up about eleven, and before midnight I was at home, after a  magnificent walk of three miles, over the mountains, in the moonlight.  _The Inspector._        [7] This was an old blasted oak, standing a few years ago in Nannau          Park, to the infinite horrification of the honest mountaineers.          Tradition had imbued it with a terrible and awful influence--for,          some four or five hundred years ago, the gigantic skeleton of a          warrior was found incased in its trunk, and grasping with its          bony fingers a long and ponderous sword. It was blown down one          stormy night, and the wood has been manufactured into a variety          of articles.           *       *       *       *       *          THE SELECTOR, AND LITERARY NOTICES OF _NEW WORKS_.           *       *       *       *       *      NEW SOUTH WALES.      The following observations, recorded in Mr. Cunningham's _Two Years in  New South Wales_, are as valuable as they are interesting; for hitherto  we have known but little of the natural history of that country:--    _Trees_.--Trees here appear to follow the same laws as other vegetable  substances, regarding the effects they produce upon the soil wherein  they grow. It has long been remarked in America, that on the forests  being cut down, young trees of a different species sprout up in place of  the old ones; and here the same remark, in a great measure, holds  good,--acacias very commonly making their appearance on land that has  been once under cultivation, and afterwards permitted to relapse into a  state of nature. From this circumstance it should seem, that trees, like  other vegetables, extract a particular substance from the ground, which  substance it is necessary should be restored before the same species of  tree can be readily grown a second time,--a restoration to be effected,  perhaps, by such chemical changes in the constituent particles of the  soil as may arise from the cultivation of other species.    _Fruits_.--Of native fruits, we possess raspberries equal in flavour and  not otherwise distinguishable from the English. They grow plentifully  on the alluvial banks of Hunter's river, and supply a yearly Christmas  feast to the birds. Oar native currants are strongly acidulous, like the  cranberry, and make an excellent preserve when mixed with the raspberry.  They grow on low shrubs not higher than the whortleberry bush. Our  cherries are destitute both of pleasant taste and flavour, and have  the stone adhering to their outside. Our native pears are tolerably  tempting to the look, but defy both mastication and digestion, being the  pendulous seed-pods of a tree here, and their outer husks of such a hard  woody consistence, as to put the edge of even a well-tempered knife to  proof of its qualities in slicing them down. The burwan is a nut much  relished by our natives, who prepare it by roasting and immersion in a  running stream, to free it from its poisonous qualities. The jibbong is  another tasteless fruit, as well as the _five-corners_, much relished by  children. The wild potato strongly resembles the species now in use in  Europe, but the stem and leaf are essentially different. It grows on the  loose flooded alluvial margins of the rivers, and at one period of the  year composes the chief sustenance of the natives, having the watery  look and taste of the yam. Of foreign fruits now climatized we possess a  great variety. Here are oranges, lemons, citrons, nectarines, apricots,  peaches, plums, cherries, figs, loquats, grenadillos, quinces, pears,  apples, mulberries, pomegranates, grapes, olives, raspberries,  strawberries, bananas, guavas, pineapples, and English and Cape  gooseberries and currants. Of shell-fruits we have the almond, walnut,  chestnut, and filbert; and of other garden fruits, strawberries, melons,  peppers, &c.    Melons and pumpkins will absolutely overrun you, if you do not give them  most bounteous scope, and you need want neither water nor musk-melons  for six or eight months yearly on an average, if you duly time the  sowings."]]]
