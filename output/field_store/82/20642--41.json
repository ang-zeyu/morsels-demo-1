It is the chronicle of a race between the brain of  Weak-Hands and the body of the other, symbolized by the chasing of poor  Weak-Hands in and out among the rocks until the climax. Brain desperately  triumphs. Weak-Hands slays Brute-Force with the startling invention. He  wins back his stolen bride, Lily-White (impersonated by Mae Marsh). It is  a Griffith masterpiece, and every actor does sound work. The audience,  mechanical Americans, fond of crawling on their stomachs to tinker their  automobiles, are eager over the evolution of the first weapon from a  stick to a hammer. They are as full of curiosity as they could well be  over the history of Langley or the Wright brothers.    The dire perils of the motion pictures provoke the ingenuity of the  audience, not their passionate sympathy. When, in the minds of the  deluded producers, the beholders should be weeping or sighing with  desire, they are prophesying the next step to one another in worldly  George Ade slang. This is illustrated in another good Action Photoplay:  the dramatization of The Spoilers. The original novel was written by Rex  Beach. The gallant William Farnum as Glenister dominates the play. He has  excellent support. Their team-work makes them worthy of chronicle: Thomas  Santschi as McNamara, Kathlyn Williams as Cherry Malotte, Bessie Eyton  as Helen Chester, Frank Clark as Dextry, Wheeler Oakman as Bronco Kid,  and Jack McDonald as Slapjack.    There are, in The Spoilers, inspiriting ocean scenes and mountain views.  There are interesting sketches of mining-camp manners and customs. There  is a well-acted love-interest in it, and the element of the comradeship  of loyal pals. But the chase rushes past these things to the climax, as  in a policeman picture it whirls past blossoming gardens and front lawns  till the tramp is arrested. The difficulties are commented on by the  people in the audience as rah-rah boys on the side lines comment on  hurdles cleared or knocked over by the men running in college field-day.  The sudden cut-backs into side branches of the story are but hurdles  also, not plot complications in the stage sense. This is as it should be.  The pursuit progresses without St. Vitus dance or hysteria to the end of  the film. There the spoilers are discomfited, the gold mine is  recaptured, the incidental girls are won, in a flash, by the rightful  owners.    These shows work like the express elevators in the Metropolitan Tower.  The ideal is the maximum of speed in descending or ascending, not to be  jolted into insensibility. There are two girl parts as beautifully  thought out as the parts of ladies in love can be expected to be in  Action Films. But in the end the love is not much more romantic in the  eye of the spectator than it would be to behold a man on a motorcycle  with the girl of his choice riding on the same machine behind him. And  the highest type of Action Picture romance is not attained by having  Juliet triumph over the motorcycle handicap. It is not achieved by  weaving in a Sherlock Holmes plot. Action Picture romance comes when each  hurdle is a tableau, when there is indeed an art-gallery-beauty in each  one of these swift glimpses: when it is a race, but with a proper and  golden-linked grace from action to action, and the goal is the most  beautiful glimpse in the whole reel.    In the Action Picture there is no adequate means for the development of  any full grown personal passion. The distinguished character-study that  makes genuine the personal emotions in the legitimate drama, has no  chance. People are but types, swiftly moved chessmen. More elaborate  discourse on this subject may be found in chapter twelve on the  differences between the films and the stage. But here, briefly: the  Action Pictures are falsely advertised as having heart-interest, or  abounding in tragedy. But though the actors glower and wrestle and even  if they are the most skilful lambasters in the profession, the audience  gossips and chews gum.    Why does the audience keep coming to this type of photoplay if neither  lust, love, hate, nor hunger is adequately conveyed? Simply because such  spectacles gratify the incipient or rampant speed-mania in every  American.    To make the elevator go faster than the one in the Metropolitan Tower is  to destroy even this emotion. To elaborate unduly any of the agonies or  seductions in the hope of arousing lust, love, hate, or hunger, is to  produce on the screen a series of misplaced figures of the order  Frankenstein.    How often we have been horrified by these galvanized and ogling corpses.  These are the things that cause the outcry for more censors. It is not  that our moral codes are insulted, but what is far worse, our nervous  systems are temporarily racked to pieces. These wriggling half-dead men,  these over-bloody burglars, are public nuisances, no worse and no better  than dead cats being hurled about by street urchins.    The cry for more censors is but the cry for the man with the broom.  Sometimes it is a matter as simple as when a child is scratching with a  pin on a slate. While one would not have the child locked up by the chief  of police, after five minutes of it almost every one wants to smack him  till his little jaws ache. It is the very cold-bloodedness of the  proceeding that ruins our kindness of heart. And the best Action Film is  impersonal and unsympathetic even if it has no scratching pins. Because  it is cold-blooded it must take extra pains to be tactful. Cold-blooded  means that the hero as we see him on the screen is a variety of amiable  or violent ghost. Nothing makes his lack of human charm plainer than when  we as audience enter the theatre at the middle of what purports to be the  most passionate of scenes when the goal of the chase is unknown to us and  the alleged \"situation\" appeals on its magnetic merits. Here is neither  the psychic telepathy of Forbes Robertson's Caesar, nor the fire-breath of  E.H. Sothern's Don Quixote. The audience is not worked up into the  deadly still mob-unity of the speaking theatre. We late comers wait for  the whole reel to start over and the goal to be indicated in the  preliminary, before we can get the least bit wrought up. The prize may  be a lady's heart, the restoration of a lost reputation, or the ownership  of the patent for a churn. In the more effective Action Plays it is often  what would be secondary on the stage, the recovery of a certain glove,  spade, bull-calf, or rock-quarry. And to begin, we are shown a clean-cut  picture of said glove, spade, bull-calf, or rock-quarry. Then when these  disappear from ownership or sight, the suspense continues till they are  again visible on the screen in the hands of the rightful owner.    In brief, the actors hurry through what would be tremendous passions on  the stage to recover something that can be really photographed. For  instance, there came to our town long ago a film of a fight between  Federals and Confederates, with the loss of many lives, all for the  recapture of a steam-engine that took on more personality in the end than  private or general on either side, alive or dead. It was based on the  history of the very engine photographed, or else that engine was given in  replica. The old locomotive was full of character and humor amidst the  tragedy, leaking steam at every orifice. The original is in one of the  Southern Civil War museums. This engine in its capacity as a principal  actor is going to be referred to more than several times in this work.    The highest type of Action Picture gives us neither the quality of  Macbeth or Henry Fifth, the Comedy of Errors, or the Taming of the Shrew.  It gives us rather that fine and special quality that was in the  ink-bottle of Robert Louis Stevenson, that brought about the limitations  and the nobility of the stories of Kidnapped, Treasure Island, and the  New Arabian Nights.    This discussion will be resumed on another plane in the eighth chapter:  Sculpture-in-Motion.    Having read thus far, why not close the book and go round the corner to a  photoplay theatre? Give the preference to the cheapest one. _The Action  Picture will be inevitable. Since this chapter was written, Charlie  Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks have given complete department store  examples of the method, especially Chaplin in the brilliantly constructed  Shoulder Arms, and Fairbanks in his one great piece of acting, in The  Three Musketeers_.          CHAPTER III    THE INTIMATE PHOTOPLAY      Let us take for our platform this sentence: THE MOTION PICTURE ART IS A  GREAT HIGH ART, NOT A PROCESS OF COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURE. The people I  hope to convince of this are (1) The great art museums of America,  including the people who support them in any way, the people who give the  current exhibitions there or attend them, the art school students in the  corridors below coming on in the same field; (2) the departments of  English, of the history of the drama, of the practice of the drama, and  the history and practice of \"art\" in that amazingly long list of our  colleges and universities--to be found, for instance, in the World  Almanac; (3) the critical and literary world generally. Somewhere in this  enormous field, piled with endowments mountain high, it should be  possible to establish the theory and practice of the photoplay as a fine  art. Readers who do not care for the history of any art, readers who  have neither curiosity nor aspiration in regard to any of the ten or  eleven muses who now dance around Apollo, such shabby readers had best  lay the book down now. Shabby readers do not like great issues. My poor  little sermon is concerned with a great issue, the clearing of the way  for a critical standard, whereby the ultimate photoplay may be judged. I  cannot teach office-boys ways to make \"quick money\" in the \"movies.\" That  seems to be the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13030"],[0,"The German Classics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Volume 09 (#6)"],[1,"last hour when it threatens to come, writhe  like a worm over it, and implore God to let them live, just as a servant  implores his master to let him do something over again that he has  done poorly, so that he may not come short in his wages on pay-day.    CLARA.    Don't talk in that way, dear mother! It weakens you.    MOTHER.    No, child, it does me good! Am I not well and strong again now? Did  not the Lord call me merely to let me know that my festal robe was not  yet pure and spotless? And did he not permit me to come back from the  very edge of the grave, and grant me time to prepare myself for the  heavenly wedding? He was not as kind as that to those five Virgins in  the Gospel, about whom I had you read to me last night. And that is the  reason why today, when I am going to the Holy Communion, I put this  dress on. I wore it the day I made the best and most pious resolutions  of my life; I want it to remind me of those which I have not yet carried  out.    CLARA.    You still talk as you did in your illness!        SCENE II    CARL (_enters_).    Good morning, mother! Well, Clara, I suppose you might put up with me,  if I were not your brother?    CLARA.    A gold chain? Where did you get that?    CARL.    Why do I sweat so? Why do I work two hours longer than the others every  evening? You are impertinent!    MOTHER.    A quarrel on Sunday morning? Shame on you, Carl!    CARL.    Mother, haven't you got a gulden for me?    MOTHER.    I haven't any money except for the housekeeping!    CARL.    Well, give me some of that then! I won't grumble if you make the  pancakes thinner for the next two weeks. You have often done so before!  I know that all right! When you were saving up for Clara's white dress,  we didn't have anything decent to eat for a month. I shut my eyes, but I  knew right well that a new hair ribbon or some other bit of finery was  on the way. So let me get something out of it too, for once!    MOTHER.    You are absolutely shameless!    CARL.    I haven't much time, else--[_He starts to go_.]    MOTHER.    Where are you going?    CARL.    I won't tell you, and then, when the old growler asks you where I am,  you can answer without blushing that you don't know. Anyway I don't need  your gulden--it is best not to draw all your water from one well.    [_To himself_.]    Here at home they always think the worst things they can about me; why  shouldn't I take pleasure in keeping them worried? Why should I say  that, since I don't get my gulden, I shall have to go to church, unless  a friend helps me out of my predicament?        SCENE III    CLARA.    What does he mean by that?    MOTHER.    Oh, he grieves me terribly! Yes, yes, your father is right! Those are  the consequences! He is just as insolent now in demanding a gulden as he  was cunning in pleading for a piece of sugar when he was a little  curly-headed baby. I wonder if he would not demand the gulden now, if I  had refused him the sugar then? That often hurts me! And I think he  doesn't even love me! Did you ever once see him cry during my illness?    CLARA.    I didn't see him very often at best--almost never except at the table.  He had more appetite than I!    MOTHER (_quickly_).    That was natural! He had to work so hard!    CLARA.    To be sure! And how strange men are! They are more ashamed of their  tears than they are of their sins! A clenched fist--why not exhibit  that? But red eyes!--And father too! The afternoon they opened your vein  and no blood came, he sobbed at his work-bench until it moved my very  soul! But when I went up to him and stroked his cheeks, what did he say?  \"See if you can't get this accursed splinter out of my eye! I have so  much to do and can't accomplish anything!\"    MOTHER (_smiling_).    Yes! yes!--I never see Leonard any more, by the way. How does that  happen?    CLARA.    Let him stay away!    MOTHER.    I hope you are not seeing him anywhere else, except here at the house!    CLARA.    Is it because I stay out too long when I go to the well in the evening  that you have reason to suspect that?    MOTHER.    No, not that. But it was just for that reason that I gave him permission  to come here to the house, so that he wouldn't lie in wait for you out  there in the dark. My mother would never allow that, either!    CLARA.    I don't see him at all!    MOTHER.    Have you had a quarrel? Otherwise I think I might like him--he is so  steady! If he only amounted to something! In my time he would not have  had to wait long. Then gentlemen were eager for a good penman, as lame  people are for their crutch, for they were rare. Even we humble people  could use one. Today he would compose for a son a New Year's greeting to  his father and receive for the gilded initials alone enough to buy a  child's doll with. Tomorrow the father would give him a sly wink and  have him read the greeting aloud, secretly and behind closed doors, so  as not to be surprised and have his ignorance discovered. That meant  double pay. Then penmen were jolly people and made the price of beer  high. It is different now. Now we old folks, not knowing anything about  reading and writing, must allow ourselves to be made fun of by  nine-year-old children. The world is steadily growing wiser; perhaps the  time is yet to come when people who can't walk a tight-rope will have to  feel ashamed of it!    CLARA.    The bell is ringing!    MOTHER.    Well, child, I will pray for you. And as far as Leonard is concerned,  love him as he loves God--no more and no less. That is what my old  mother said to me when she died and gave me her blessing. I have kept it  long enough; now you have it!    CLARA (_hands her a nosegay_).    There!    MOTHER.    That certainly comes from Carl.    CLARA (_nods; then aside_.)    Would it were so! Anything that is to give her real pleasure has to come  from him!    MOTHER.    Oh, he is so good--and he likes me! [_Exit_.]    CLARA (_looks after her through the window_).    There she goes! Three times I have dreamt that she was lying in her  coffin, and now--oh, these awful dreams! I am not going to care about  dreams any more; I will take no pleasure in a good dream, and then I  shall not have to worry about the bad one that follows it. How firmly  and confidently she steps out! She is already close to the church-yard.  I wonder who will be the first person she meets? It would signify  nothing--no, I mean only [_she shudders_]--the gravedigger! He has just  finished digging a grave and is climbing out of it! She greets him and  glances smilingly down into the dismal hole! She throws the nosegay into  it and enters the church!    [_A choir is heard_.]    They are singing: _Praise ye the Lord_.    [_She folds her hands_.]    Yes! yes! If my mother had died, I should never have recovered from it,  for--[_Glances toward Heaven_.] But Thou art kind, Thou art merciful! I  would that I believed with the Catholics, so that I might offer Thee  something! I would empty the whole of my little box of savings and buy  Thee a beautiful gilded heart, and twine it with roses. Our pastor says  that sacrifices mean nothing to Thee, because everything is Thine, and  one should not offer Thee something Thou already hast. And yet  everything in the house belongs to my father too; and still he likes it  when I buy a piece of cloth with his money and embroider it and put it  on his plate for his birthday. Yes, and he honors me by wearing it only  on great holidays, at Christmas or Whitsuntide. Once I saw a little mite  of a Catholic girl carrying some cherries up to the altar. They were the  first the child had had that year, and I could see how she longed to eat  them. Still she resisted the innocent desire, and, in order to put an  end to the temptation, hurriedly threw them down. The priest, who was  just about to pick up the chalice, looked on with a scowl, and the child  hastened timidly away. But the Mary above the altar smiled gently, as if  she would have liked to step out of her frame and overtake the child and  kiss her.--I did it for her! Here comes Leonard. Oh, dear!        SCENE IV    LEONARD (_outside the door_).    Are you dressed?    CLARA.    Why so polite, so considerate? I am no princess, you know.    LEONARD (_enters_).    I thought you were not alone! In passing by I thought I saw your  neighbor Babbie standing by the window.    CLARA.    And so that is why--    LEONARD.    You are forever so irritable! One can stay away from here for two weeks,  rain and sunshine can have alternated ten times, and, when one does  finally come again, he finds the same old cloud darkening your face!    CLARA.    Things used to be different!    LEONARD.    Correct! If you had always looked as you do now, we should never have  become good friends!    CLARA.    What of it?    LEONARD.    So you feel yourself as free of me as that, do you? Perhaps it serves me  right! Then [_significantly_] your recent toothache was a mere pretext!    CLARA.    Oh, Leonard, it was not right of you!    LEONARD.    Not right for me to seek to bind to me the greatest treasure that I  have--for that is what you are to me--with the firmest of all bonds? And  especially at a time when I stood in danger of losing it? Do you think I  did not see the furtive glances you exchanged with the Secretary? That  was a triumphant day of joy for me! I take you to the dance and--  CLARA.    You never stop saying things that hurt me! I looked at the Secretary,  why should I deny it? But only on account of the moustache he had grown  at the University, and which--    [_She checks herself_.]    LEONARD.    Becomes him so well--isn't that it? Isn't that what you started to say?  Oh, you women! Anything that looks like a soldier, even a caricature of  one, you like. To me the fop's ridiculous little oval face, with that  tuft of hair in the middle of it, looked like a little white rabbit  hiding behind a bush. I am bitter toward him--I won't try to conceal it."]]]
