It seemed cruel and unnatural that any  influence so dark and mysterious should thus intrude on our bright life,  and from the first I had an impression which I could not entirely shake  off, that any such appearance or converse of a disembodied spirit must  portend misfortune, if not worse, to him who saw or heard it. It never  occurred to me to combat or to doubt the reality of the vision; he  believed that he had seen it, and his conviction was enough to convince  me. He had meant, he said, to tell no one, and had given a promise to  Mr. Gaskell to that effect; but I think that he could not bear to keep  such a matter in his own breast, and within the first week of his  return he made me his confidant. I remember, my dear Edward, the look  everything wore on that sad night when he first told me what afterwards  proved so terrible a secret. We had dined quite alone, and he had been  moody and depressed all the evening. It was a chilly night, with some  fret blowing up from the sea. The moon showed that blunted and deformed  appearance which she assumes a day or two past the full, and the  moisture in the air encircled her with a stormy-looking halo. We had  stepped out of the dining-room windows on to the little terrace looking  down towards Smedmore and Encombe. The glaucous shrubs that grow in  between the balusters were wet and dripping with the salt breath of the  sea, and we could hear the waves coming into the cove from the west.  After standing a minute I felt chill, and proposed that we should go  back to the billiard-room, where a fire was lit on all except the  warmest nights. \"No,\" John said, \"I want to tell you something, Sophy,\"  and then we walked on to the old boat summer-house. There he told me  everything. I cannot describe to you my feelings of anguish and horror  when he told me of the appearance of the man. The interest of the tale  was so absorbing to me that I took no note of time, nor of the cold  night air, and it was only when it was all finished that I felt how  deadly chill it had become. \"Let us go in, John,\" I said; \"I am cold and  feel benumbed.\"    But youth is hopeful and strong, and in another week the impression had  faded from our minds, and we were enjoying the full glory of midsummer  weather, which I think only those know who have watched the blue sea  come rippling in at the foot of the white chalk cliffs of Dorset.    I had felt a reluctance even so much as to hear the air of the  _Gagliarda_, and though he had spoken to me of the subject on more than  one occasion, my brother had never offered to play it to me. I knew that  he had the copy of Graziani's suites with him at Worth Maltravers,  because he had told me that he had brought it from Oxford; but I had  never seen the book, and fancied that he kept it intentionally locked  up. He did not, however, neglect the violin, and during the summer  mornings, as I sat reading or working on the terrace, I often heard him  playing to himself in the library. Though he had never even given me any  description of the melody of the _Gagliarda_, yet I felt certain that he  not infrequently played it. I cannot say how it was; but from the moment  that I heard him one morning in the library performing an air set in a  curiously low key, it forced itself upon my attention, and I knew, as it  were by instinct, that it must be the _Gagliarda_ of the \"Areopagita.\"  He was using a _sordino_ and playing it very softly; but I was not  mistaken. One wet afternoon in October, only a week before the time of  his leaving us to return to Oxford for the autumn term, he walked into  the drawing-room where I was sitting, and proposed that we should play  some music together. To this I readily agreed. Though but a mediocre  performer, I have always taken much pleasure in the use of the  pianoforte, and esteemed it an honour whenever he asked me to play with  him, since my powers as a musician were so very much inferior to his.  After we had played several pieces, he took up an oblong music-book  bound in white vellum, placed it upon the desk of the pianoforte, and  proposed that we should play a suite by Graziani. I knew that he meant  the \"Areopagita,\" and begged him at once not to ask me to play it. He  rallied me lightly on my fears, and said it would much please him to  play it, as he had not heard the pianoforte part since he had left  Oxford three months ago. I saw that he was eager to perform it, and  being loath to disoblige so kind a brother during the last week of his  stay at home, I at length overcame my scruples and set out to play it.  But I was so alarmed at the possibility of any evil consequences  ensuing, that when we commenced the _Gagliarda_ I could scarcely find  my notes. Nothing in any way unusual, however, occurred; and being  reassured by this, and feeling an irresistible charm in the music, I  finished the suite with more appearance of ease. My brother, however,  was, I fear, not satisfied with my performance, and compared it, very  possibly, with that of Mr. Gaskell, to which it was necessarily much  inferior, both through weakness of execution and from my insufficient  knowledge of the principles of the _basso continuo_. We stopped playing,  and John stood looking out of the window across the sea, where the sky  was clearing low down under the clouds. The sun went down behind  Portland in a fiery glow which cheered us after a long day's rain. I had  taken the copy of Graziani's suites off the desk, and was holding it on  my lap turning over the old foxed and yellow pages. As I closed it a  streak of evening sunlight fell across the room and lighted up a coat  of arms stamped in gilt on the cover. It was much faded and would  ordinarily have been hard to make out; but the ray of strong light  illumined it, and in an instant I recognised the same shield which Mr.  Gaskell had pictured to himself as hanging on the musicians' gallery of  his phantasmal dancing-room. My brother had often recounted to me this  effort of his friend's imagination, and here I saw before me the same  florid foreign blazon, a cherub's head blowing on three lilies on a gold  field. This discovery was not only of interest, but afforded me much  actual relief; for it accounted rationally for at least one item of the  strange story. Mr. Gaskell had no doubt noticed at some time this shield  stamped on the outside of the book, and bearing the impression of it  unconsciously in his mind, had reproduced it in his imagined revels.  I said as much to my brother, and he was greatly interested, and after  examining the shield agreed that this was certainly a probable solution  of that part of the mystery. On the 12th of October John returned to  Oxford.          CHAPTER VI      My brother told me afterwards that more than once during the summer  vacation he had seriously considered with himself the propriety of  changing his rooms at Magdalen Hall. He had thought that it might thus  be possible for him to get rid at once of the memory of the apparition,  and of the fear of any reappearance of it. He could either have moved  into another set of rooms in the Hall itself, or else gone into lodgings  in the town--a usual proceeding, I am told, for gentlemen near the end  of their course at Oxford. Would to God that he had indeed done so! but  with the supineness which has, I fear, my dear Edward, been too  frequently a characteristic of our family, he shrank from the trouble  such a course would involve, and the opening of the autumn term found  him still in his old rooms. You will forgive me for entering here on a  very brief description of your father's sitting-room. It is, I think,  necessary for the proper understanding of the incidents that follow. It  was not a large room, though probably the finest in the small buildings  of Magdalen Hall, and panelled from floor to ceiling with oak which  successive generations had obscured by numerous coats of paint. On one  side were two windows having an aspect on to New College Lane, and  fitted with deep cushioned seats in the recesses. Outside these windows  there were boxes of flowers, the brightness of which formed in the  summer term a pretty contrast to the grey and crumbling stone, and  afforded pleasure at once to the inmate and to passers-by. Along nearly  the whole length of the wall opposite to the windows, some tenant in  years long past had had mahogany book-shelves placed, reaching to a  height of perhaps five feet from the floor. They were handsomely made  in the style of the eighteenth century and pleased my brother's taste.  He had always exhibited a partiality for books, and the fine library at  Worth Maltravers had no doubt contributed to foster his tastes in that  direction. At the time of which I write he had formed a small collection  for himself at Oxford, paying particular attention to the bindings, and  acquiring many excellent specimens of that art, principally I think,  from Messrs. Payne & Foss, the celebrated London booksellers.    Towards the end of the autumn term, having occasion one cold day to take  down a volume of Plato from its shelf, he found to his surprise that the  book was quite warm. A closer examination easily explained to him the  reason--namely, that the flue of a chimney, passing behind one end of  the bookcase, sensibly heated not only the wall itself, but also the  books in the shelves. Although he had been in his rooms now near three  years, he had never before observed this fact; partly, no doubt, because  the books in these shelves were seldom handled, being more for show as  specimens of bindings than for practical use. He was somewhat annoyed  at this discovery, fearing lest such a heat, which in moderation is  beneficial to books, might through its excess warp the leather or  otherwise injure the bindings. Mr. Gaskell was sitting with him at the  time of the discovery,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14134"],[0,"Akbar, Emperor of India (#6)"],[1,"the realm of architecture in  that he discovered how to combine two completely different styles. For  indeed, the union of Mohammedan and Indian motives in the buildings of  Akbar (who here as in all other departments strove to perfect the  complete elevation of national and religious details) to form an  improved third style,[28] is entirely original.      [Footnote 28: A. Mueller, II, 386.]    Among other ways Akbar betrayed the scientific trend of his mind by  sending out an expedition in search of the sources of the Ganges.[29]  That a man of such a wonderful degree of versatility should have  recognized the value of general education and have devoted himself to  its improvement, we would simply take for granted. Akbar caused  schools to be erected throughout his whole kingdom for the children of  Hindus and Mohammedans, whereas he himself did not know how to read or  write.[30] This remarkable fact would seem incredible to us after  considering all the above mentioned facts if it was not confirmed by  the express testimony of his son, the Emperor Jehangir. At any rate  for an illiterate man Akbar certainly accomplished an astonishing  amount. The universal character of the endowments of this man could  not have been increased by the learning of the schools.      [Footnote 29: J.T. Wheeler, IV, I, 174]      [Footnote 30: J.T. Wheeler, loc. cit., 141; Noer, I, 193; II, 324,    326]    [Illustration: AKBAR'S GRAVE.]    I have now come to the point which arouses most strongly the universal  human interest in Akbar, namely, to his religious development and his  relation to the religions, or better to religion. But first I must  protest against the position maintained by a competent scholar[31]  that Akbar himself was just as indifferent to religious matters as was  the house of Timur as a whole. Against this view we have the testimony  of the conscientiousness with which he daily performed his morning and  evening devotions, the value which he placed upon fasting and prayer  as a means of self-discipline, and the regularity with which he made  yearly pilgrimages to the graves of Mohammedan saints. A better  insight into Akbar's heart than these regular observances of worship  which might easily be explained by the force of custom is given by the  extraordinary manifestations of a devout disposition. When we learn  that Akbar invariably prayed at the grave of his father in Delhi[32]  before starting upon any important undertaking, or that during the  siege of Chitor he made a vow to make a pilgrimage to a shrine in  Ajmir after the fall of the fortress, and that after Chitor was in his  power he performed this journey in the simplest pilgrim garb, tramping  barefooted over the glowing sand,[33] it is impossible for us to look  upon Akbar as irreligious. On the contrary nothing moved the Emperor  so strongly and insistently as the striving after religious truth.  This effort led to a struggle against the most destructive power in  his kingdom, against the Mohammedan priesthood. That Akbar, the  conqueror in all domains, should also have been victorious in the  struggle against the encroachments of the Church (the bitterest  struggle which a ruler can undertake), this alone should insure him a  place among the greatest of humanity.      [Footnote 31: A. Mueller, II, 418]      [Footnote 32: Noer, I, 262]      [Footnote 33: Noer, I, 259.]    The Mohammedan priesthood, the community of the Ulemas in whose hands  lay also the execution of justice according to the dictates of Islam,  had attained great prosperity in India by countless large bequests.  Its distinguished membership formed an influential party at court.  This party naturally represented the Islam of the stricter observance,  the so-called Sunnitic Islam, and displayed the greatest severity and  intolerance towards the representatives of every more liberal  interpretation and towards unbelievers. The chief judge of Agra  sentenced men to death because they were Shiites, that is to say they  belonged to the other branch of Islam, and the Ulemas urged Akbar to  proceed likewise against the heretics.[34] That arrogance and vanity,  selfishness and avarice, also belonged to the character of the Ulemas  is so plainly to be taken for granted according to all analogies that  it need hardly be mentioned. The judicature was everywhere utilized by  the Ulemas as a means for illegitimate enrichment.      [Footnote 34: J.T. Wheeler, IV, I, 156.]    This ecclesiastical party which in its narrow-minded folly considered  itself in possession of the whole truth, stands opposed to the noble  skeptic Akbar, whose doubt of the divine origin of the Koran and of  the truth of its dogmas began so to torment him that he would pass  entire nights sitting out of doors on a stone lost in contemplation.  The above mentioned brothers Faizi and Abul Fazl introduced to his  impressionable spirit the exalted teaching of Sufism, the Mohammedan  mysticism whose spiritual pantheism had its origin in, or at least was  strongly influenced by, the doctrine of the All-One, held by the  Brahman Vedanta system. The Sufi doctrine teaches religious tolerance  and has apparently strengthened Akbar in his repugnance towards the  intolerant exclusiveness of Sunnitic Islam.    The Ulemas must have been horror-stricken when they found out that  Akbar even sought religious instruction from the hated Brahmans. We  hear especially of two, Purushottama and Debi by name, the first of  whom taught Sanskrit and Brahman philosophy to the Emperor in his  palace, whereas the second was drawn up on a platform to the wall of  the palace in the dead of the night and there, suspended in midair,  gave lessons on profound esoteric doctrines of the Upanishads to the  emperor as he sat by the window. A characteristic bit of Indian local  color! The proud Padishah of India, one of the most powerful rulers of  his time, listening in the silence of night to the words of the  Brahman suspended there outside, who himself as proud as the Emperor  would not set foot inside the dwelling of one who in his eyes was  unclean, but who would not refuse his wisdom to a sincere seeker after  truth.    Akbar left no means untried to broaden his religious outlook. From  Gujerat he summoned some Parsees, followers of the religion of  Zarathustra, and through them informed himself of their faith and  their highly developed system of ethics which places the sinful  thought on the same level with the sinful word and act.    From olden times the inhabitants of India have had a predisposition  for religious and philosophical disputations. So Akbar, too, was  convinced of the utility of free discussion on religious dogmas. Based  upon this idea, and perhaps also in the hope that the Ulemas would be  discomfited Akbar founded at Fathpur Sikri, his favorite residence in  the vicinity of Agra, the famous Ibadat Khana, literally the \"house of  worship,\" but in reality the house of controversy. This was a splendid  structure composed of four halls in which scholars and religious men  of all sects gathered together every Thursday evening and were given  an opportunity to defend their creeds in the presence and with the  cooperation of the Emperor. Akbar placed the discussion in charge of  the wise and liberal minded Abul Fazl. How badly the Ulemas, the  representatives of Mohammedan orthodoxy, came off on these  controversial evenings was to be foreseen. Since they had no success  with their futile arguments they soon resorted to cries of fury,  insults for their opponents and even to personal violence, often  turning against each other and hurling curses upon their own number.  In these discussions the inferiority of the Ulemas, who nevertheless  had always put forth such great claims, was so plainly betrayed that  Akbar learned to have a profound contempt for them.    In addition to this, the fraud and machinations by means of which the  Ulemas had unlawfully enriched themselves became known to the Emperor.  At any rate there was sufficient ground for the chastisement which  Akbar now visited upon the high clergy. In the year 1579 a decree was  issued which assigned to the Emperor the final decision in matters of  faith, and this was subscribed to by the chiefs of the Ulemas,--with  what personal feelings we can well imagine. For by this act the Ulemas  were deprived of their ecclesiastical authority which was transferred  to the Emperor. That the Orient too possesses its particular official  manner of expression in administrative matters is very prettily shown  by a decree in which Akbar \"granted the long cherished wish\" of these  same chiefs of the Ulemas to undertake the pilgrimage to Mecca, which  of course really meant a banishment of several years. Other unworthy  Ulemas were displaced from their positions or deprived of their  sinecures; others who in their bitterness had caused rebellion or  incited or supported mutiny were condemned for high treason. The rich  property of the churches was for the most part confiscated and  appropriated for the general weal. In short, the power and influence  of the Ulemas was completely broken down, the mosques stood empty and  were transformed into stables and warehouses.    Akbar had long ceased to be a faithful Moslem. Now after the fall of  the Ulemas he came forward openly with his conviction, declared the  Koran to be a human compilation and its commands folly, disputed the  miracles of Mohammed and also the value of his prophecies, and denied  the doctrine of recompense after death. He professed the Brahman and  Sufistic doctrine that the soul migrates through countless existences  and finally attains divinity after complete purification.    The assertion of the Ulemas that every person came into the world  predisposed towards Islam and that the natural language of mankind was  Arabic (the Jews made the same claim for Hebrew and the Brahmans for  Sanskrit), Akbar refuted by a drastic"]]]
