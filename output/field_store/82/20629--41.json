Then follows the longest of these paragraphs running up and down the grimy  gamut of sin. Beginning with _all_ unrighteousness, he goes on to specify  depravity, greedy covetousness, maliciousness. Oozing out of every pore  there are envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity. Men are whisperers,  backbiters, God-haters, and self-lovers, in that they are insolent,  haughty, boastful. They are inventors of evil things, without  understanding, breakers of faith, without natural affection, ruthlessly  merciless.    The climax is reached in this, that though they _know_ God, and what He  has set as the right rule of life, they not only _do_ these things named,  but they delight in the fellowship of those who habitually practise them.  The stage of impulsiveness is wholly gone. They have settled down to this  as the deliberate choice and habit of life. Man is still a _king_, but all  bemired. He is the image and glory of God, but how shrivelled and  withered; obscured, all overgrown with ugly poison vines.    Let it be remembered at once that this is a _composite_ picture of the  race. Many different sorts of men must be put together to get such a view.  Sin works out differently in different persons. A man's activities take on  the tinge of his personality. So sin in a man takes on the color and tone  of his individuality.    One man has the inner disposition against God, accompanied by no excesses  at all. These things disgust him. He is refined in his tastes, perhaps  scholarly and intellectual in his thinking. That inner disposition may be  a sort of refined ignoring of God either defiant or indifferent. In  another, the animal nature swings to the front, stronger perhaps by  heredity, and, yielded to, it runs to the excess of riot. Then there is  the man with the strange yellow fever, whose love for the bright-colored  precious metal burns in his blood and controls every impulse and purpose.  And the man with intense love of power, of controlling men and things for  the sake of the immense power involved, with himself as the centre of all.    There is every imaginable degree of each of these, and every sort of  combination among them. The lines cross and re-cross at every possible  angle in various persons. A man is apt to get money-drunk then  society-drunk (with a special definition for the word society in this  connection), then lust-drunk. Or, he may swing direct from  money-intoxication into power-intoxication. Please notice keenly that each  of these four grows up out of a perfectly normal, natural desire. Sin  always follows nature's grooves. There is nothing wrong in itself. The sin  is in the wrong motive underneath, or the wrong relationship round about  an act. Or, it is in excess, exaggeration, pushing an act out of its true  proportion. Exaggeration floods the stream out of its channel. Wrong  motive or wrong relationship sends a bad stream into a good channel.    But sift down under the surface and always is found the same thing. The  upper growth is varied by what it finds on the surface to mingle with, but  the sub-stuff is ever the same. The root always is self. The whole seed of  sin is in preferring one's own way to God's way; one's self to God. The  stream of life is turned the wrong way. It is turned in. Its true  direction is up. The true centre of gravity for man is not downward, nor  inward, but upward and outward.        <u>God's Treatment of Sin.</u>      God's treatment of sin lets in a flood of light on the sort of thing it  is. Three times over in this summary Paul says that God \"_gave them up._\"  As they cast out all acknowledgment of God, He gave them up to an  _outcast_ mind. When they turned God out-of-doors, God left them indoors  to themselves. It was the worst thing He could do, and the best. Worst--to  be left alone with sin. Best, because the sin would get so vile that the  man in God's image would want to turn it out, and get God back. Man never  turns from sin until he feels its vileness to the sickening point. When  things get to the acute stage, and a sharp crisis is on, then as a rule  there will be an eager turning to the One who can cleanse and make over  new; but usually not until then.    Sin has a terrific gait. Give it a loose rein and man will get winded and  ready to drop. Only then is he ready to drop it. Sin can't be patched up  or mended. Nursing only helps it to its feet for a fresh start. The whole  trouble is in the nature of the thing. The heart pumps the hot blood of  rebellion. Its lungs can breathe only self-willed air. The worst  punishment of sin is that left alone it breeds more sin, and worse sin.  The worst of sin is in its brood. It is very prolific. Every sin is a  seed-sin. The breeding process gets the sort more refined in its  coarseness.        \"This is the very curse of evil deed,      That of new sin it becomes the seed.\"[2]    And the plain statements of the Book, and the inevitable working of man's  nature, reveal all the bad results of sin intensifying indefinitely in  the after-life. Jesus is God letting sin do its worst, upon Himself, that  man might see its utter, stubborn damnableness, and eagerly turn from it,  and back to Him.        <u>A Bright Gleam of Light.</u>      Yet be it keenly marked, there is a very bright gleam of light across this  dark picture. In going over the story of sin with its terrific results now  and afterward, one needs to be very tender, for he is talking about  _men_--his _brothers_. And to be very careful not to say things that are  not so. Some good, earnest people have been thinking that the whole race  except a small minority were given over to eternal misery. The vast  majority of men has never heard the name of Jesus. And some very godly  people have seemed to think that these are lost forever.    Yet the old Book of God speaks very plainly here. Its meaning can be  gotten without any twisting of words. Neither the Jewish nation nor the  Christian Church can be regarded as favorites of God. God has no favorites  for salvation. The Jewish nation was chosen for _service_' sake. Through  it there came a special after-revelation of God. Through it came the  world's new Man. The Church is the repository of God's truth to-day, with  its window panes not always quite clear. Its great mission is to tell the  whole race of Jesus. Both were chosen for service.    Every nation knew God directly at the first. And be it said thoughtfully,  every man has enough of revelation and of inner light to lead him back to  God. A man's choice in this life is his choice always. Any student of the  ordinary working of man's mind can certify that. Whatever sort of being a  man deliberately, persistently chooses to be here and now, he will be  always. The only change possible in the after-life will be in the degree.  Never in the sort.    The Gospels speak of _believing on Jesus_, and of the bad results for  those who decline or refuse to have anything to do with Him. Of course it  is speaking of those who have heard of Him. There can be no believing on  Jesus without hearing, and of course in simple fairness no condemning on  any such grounds. The gospel message is wholly concerned with those who  hear.    But there is clear and plain teaching about the great outside majority of  past generations and of our own who have never heard. It was a member of  both Jewish nation and Christian Church, whose tongue, touched by the  Spirit of God, said, \"God is no respecter of persons: but in every nation  he that feareth Him and worketh righteousness is acceptable to Him.\" That  is a simple standard, yet a searching one. Anybody, anywhere, with a truly  reverential thought upward, and a controlling purpose to be right in his  life, will find the door swinging wide. No other badges or tickets  required. This would include that remarkable woman of India, Chundra  Lelah,[3] all those weary years before the simple story of Jesus brought  its flood of light and peace, and all of her innumerable class.    Paul puts it as simply and a little more fully in the letter to the  Romans, that careful treatise which sums up with marvellous fulness and  brevity the gospel he preached to the world. In chapter two, he says, \"to  them who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and  incorruption (He will give) eternal life.\" Note that in his review thus  far he has not yet gotten to Jesus the Saviour.    These people of whom he is now speaking have never heard of Jesus. They  are the great majority. Mark keenly the simple description of them. It is  a description, not of an achievement, but of a purpose. The absorbing aim  in their lives is _seeking upward_. The seeking controls the life. The  mastering spirit of these seekers is _patience, steadfastness_. They are  seeking for the highest thing. They are doing what seems to them to be  right, while seeking. They are doing right _patiently_.    Patience! What a world of conflicting experiences in a word!  Misunderstandings, breaks, slips, stumblings, failures, falls; but in all,  through all, _patience_, steadfastness. Taking a fresh hold at every turn.  And the gripping fingers ever learning a new tenacity. Pulling steadily up  a steep mountain side, in a blazing hot sun, blinded by dust, struck by  loosened rocks above rolling down, but--patiently, steadily, with  dust-blinded eyes, tugging _up_. To such is given the heart's  desire--eternal life. Ah! God judges a man by his _direction_, by the set  of his face. He may not be far up, but his face is turned up. His heels  show their backs. His toes point toward the top. That reveals the purpose,  the desire of the man inside. His choice is to be _up_. And it is choice  that makes character as well as revealing it. And the one thing that  concerns God is the character as revealed in the purpose.

Now about this time Gaygayoma, who was the daughter of Bagbagak, a  big star, and Sinag, the moon, looked down from her home in the sky,  and when she saw the tall sugar-cane growing below, she was seized  with a desire to chew it. She called to her father, Bagbagak, and said:    \"Oh, Father, please send the stars down to the earth to get some of  the sugar-cane that I see, for I must have it to chew.\"    So Bagbagak sent the stars down, and when they reached the bamboo fence  that was around the field they sprang over it, and each broke a stalk  of the cane and pulled some beans which Aponibolinayen had planted,  and the stems of these beans were of gold. Gaygayoma was delighted  with the things that the stars brought her. She cooked the beans with  the golden stems and spent long hours chewing the sweet cane. When  all that the stars brought was gone, however, she grew restless and  called to her father, the big star:    \"Come, Father, and go with me to the place where the sugar-cane grows,  for I want to see it now.\"    Bagbagak called many stars to accompany him, and they all followed  Gaygayoma down to the place where the sugar-cane grew. Some sat  on the bamboo fence, while others went to the middle of the field,  and all ate as much as they wished.    The day following this, Aponitolau said to his wife:    \"Aponibolinayen, I am going to the field to see if the bamboo fence  is strong, for the carabao will try to get in to eat our sugar-cane.\"    So he set out, and when he reached the field and began looking along  the fence to see if it was strong, he kept finding the stalks that  the stars had chewed, and he knew that someone had been there. He went  into the middle of the field, and there on the ground was a piece of  gold, and he said to himself:    \"How strange this is! I believe some beautiful girl must have chewed  my cane. I will watch tonight, and maybe she will return for more.\"    As darkness came on he had no thought of returning home, but he made  his meal of the sugar-cane, and then hid in the tall grass near the  field to wait. By and by dazzling lights blinded his eyes, and when  he could see again he was startled to find many stars falling from  the sky, and soon he heard someone breaking the cane. Suddenly a star  so large that it looked like a flame of fire fell into the field,  and then a beautiful object near the fence took off her dress which  looked like a star, and she appeared like the half of the rainbow.    Never had Aponitolau seen such sights; and for a while he lay shaking  with fear.    \"What shall I do?\" he said to himself. \"If I do not frighten these  companions of the beautiful girl, they may eat me.\"    With a great effort he jumped up and frightened the stars till they  all flew up, and when the pretty girl came looking for her dress she  found Aponitolau sitting on it. [44] \"You must forgive us,\" she said,  \"for your sugar-cane is very sweet, and we wanted some to chew.\"    \"You are welcome to the sugar-cane,\" answered Aponitolau. \"But now  we must tell our names according to our custom, for it is bad for us  to talk until we know each other's names.\"    Then he gave her some betel-nut and they chewed together, [45] and  he said:    \"Now it is our custom to tell our names.\"    \"Yes,\" said she; \"but you tell first\"    \"My name is Aponitolau and I am the husband of Aponibolinayen.\"    \"I am Gaygayoma, the daughter of Bagbagak and Sinag up in the air,\"  said the girl. \"And now, Aponitolau, even though you have a wife,  I am going to take you up to the sky, for I wish to marry you. If  you are not willing to go, I shall call my companion stars to eat you.\"    Aponitolau shook with fear, for he knew now that the woman was a  spirit; and as he dared not refuse, he promised to go with her. Soon  after that the stars dropped a basket that Gaygayoma had ordered them  to make, and Aponitolau stepped in with the lovely star and was drawn  quickly through the air up to the sky. They were met on their arrival  by a giant star whom Gaygayoma introduced as her father, and he told  Aponitolau that he had acted wisely in coming, for had he objected,  the other stars would have eaten him.    After Aponitolau had lived with the stars for some time, Gaygayoma  asked him to prick between her last two fingers, and as he did so a  beautiful baby boy popped out. They named him Takyayen, and he grew  very fast and was strong.    All this time Aponitolau had never forgotten Aponibolinayen who, he  knew, was searching for him on the earth, but he had been afraid to  mention her to the stars. When the boy was three months old, however,  he ventured to tell Gaygayoma of his wish to return to the earth.    At first she would not listen to him, but he pleaded so hard that  at last she consented to let him go for one moon [46]. If he did not  return at the end of that time, she said, she would send the stars to  eat him. Then she called for the basket again, and they were lowered  to the earth. There Aponitolau got out, but Gaygayoma and the baby  returned to the sky.    Aponibolinayen was filled with joy at the sight of her husband once  more, for she had believed him dead, and she was very thin from not  eating while he was away. Never did she tire of listening to his  stories of his life among the stars, and so happy was she to have  him again that when the time came for him to leave she refused to  let him go.    That night many stars came to the house. Some stood in the windows,  while others stayed outside by the walls; and they were so bright  that the house appeared to be on fire.    Aponitolau was greatly frightened, and he cried out to his wife:    \"You have done wrong to keep me when I should have gone. I feared  that the stars would eat me if I did not obey their command, and now  they have come. Hide me, or they will get me.\"    But before Aponibolinayen could answer, Bagbagak himself called out:    \"Do not hide from us, Aponitolau, for we know that you are in the  corner of the house. Come out or we shall eat you.\"    Trembling with fear, Aponitolau appeared, and when the stars asked  him if he was willing to go with them he dared not refuse.    Now Gaygayoma had grown very fond of Aponitolau, and she had commanded  the stars not to harm him if he was willing to return to her. So  when he gave his consent, they put him in the basket and flew away  with him, leaving Aponibolinayen very sad and lonely. After that  Aponitolau made many trips to the earth, but at Gaygayoma's command  he always returned to the sky to spend part of the time with her.    One day when Takyayen was a little boy, Aponitolau took him down to the  earth to see his half-brother, Kanag. The world was full of wonders to  the boy from the sky, and he wanted to stay there always. But after  some time while he and Kanag were playing out in the yard, big drops  of water began to fall on them. Kanag ran to his mother and cried:    \"Oh, Mother, it is raining, and the sun is shining brightly!\"    But Aponitolau, looking out, said, \"No, they are the tears of  Gaygayoma, for she sees her son down below, and she weeps for him.\"    Then he took Takyayen back to his mother in the sky, and she was  happy again.    After that Takyayen was always glad when he was allowed to visit  the earth, but each time when his mother's tears began to fall,  he returned to her. When he was old enough, Aponitolau selected a  wife for him, and after that Takyayen always lived on the earth,  but Gaygayoma stayed in the sky.        The Story of Dumalawi    _Tinguian_    Aponitolau and Aponibolinayen had a son whose name was Dumalawi. [47]  When the son had become a young man, his father one day was very  angry with him, and tried to think of some way in which to destroy  him. The next morning he said to Dumalawi:    \"Son, sharpen your knife, and we will go to the forest to cut some  bamboo.\"    So Dumalawi sharpened his knife and went with his father to the place  where the bamboo grew, and they cut many sticks and sharpened them  like spears at the end.    Dumalawi wondered why they made them thus, but when they had finished,  Aponitolau said:    \"Now, Son, you throw them at me, so that we can see which is the  braver.\"    \"No, Father,\" answered Dumalawi. \"You throw first, if you want to  kill me.\"    So Aponitolau threw the bamboo sticks one by one at his son, but he  could not hit him. Then it was the son's turn to throw, but he said:    \"No, I cannot. You are my father, and I do not want to kill you.\"    So they went home. But Dumalawi was very sorrowful, for he knew now  that his father wanted to destroy him. When his mother called him to  dinner he could not eat.    Although he had been unsuccessful in his first attempt, Aponitolau  did not give up the idea of getting rid of his son, and the next day  he said:    \"Come, Dumalawi, we will go to our little house in the field [48]  and repair it, so that it will be a protection when the rainy season  sets in.\"    The father and son went together to the field, and when they reached  the little house, Aponitolau, pointing to a certain spot in the  ground, said:    \"Dig there, and you will find a jar of basi [49] which I buried when  I was a boy. It will be very good to drink now.\"    Dumalawi dug up the jar and they tasted the wine, and it was  so pleasing to them that they drank three cocoanut shells full,  and Dumalawi became drunk. While his son lay asleep on the ground,  Aponitolau decided that this was a good time to destroy him, so he  used his magical power and there arose a great storm which picked up  Dumalawi in his sleep and carried him far away. And the father went  home alone.    Now when Dumalawi awoke, he was in the middle of a field so wide that  whichever way he looked, he could not see the end. There were neither  trees nor houses in the field and no living thing except himself. And  he felt a"]]]
