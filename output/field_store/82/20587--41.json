(#6)"],[1,"flow of the numbers is its  least praise; it rather deserves to be valued for the propriety, and  boldness of the figures and metaphors, and the machinery.    The following lines have been justly quoted as an instance of the  author's happy choice of metaphors.      As when the golden god, who rules the day,    Drives down his flaming chariot to the sea,    And leaves the nations here, involved in night,    To distant regions he transports his light;    So William's rays by turns, two rations cheer,    And when he sets to them, he rises here.    A friend of Mr. Hughes's soon after the publication of this poem,  complimented him upon the choice of his subject, and for the moral  sentiments contained in it. 'I am sure (says he) virtue is most for  the interest of mankind; and those poets have ever obtained the most  honour in the world, who have made that the end and design of their  works. A wanton Sappho, or Anacreon, among the ancients, never had the  same applause, as a Pindar, or Alexis; nor in the judgment of Horace  did they deserve it. In the opinion of all posterity, a lewd and  debauch'd Ovid, did justly submit to the worth of a Virgil; and, in  future ages, a Dryden will never be compared to Milton. In all times,  and in all places of the world, the moral poets have been ever the  greatest; and as much superior to others in wit, as in virtue. Nor  does this seem difficult to be accounted for, since the dignity of  their subjects naturally raised their ideas, and gave a grandeur to  their sentiments.'    The House of Nassau, a Pindaric Ode (printed in 1702) was occasioned  by the death of king William. 'In Pindaric and Lyric Poetry (says  Mr. Duncomb) our author's genius shines in its full lustre. Tho' he  enjoyed all that fire of imagination, and divine enthusiasm, for which  some of the ancient poets are so deservedly admired, yet did his fancy  never run away with his reason, but was always guided by superior  judgment; and the music of his verse is exquisite.'    The Translation of the third Ode of the third Book of Horace, and  the Paraphrase of the twenty-second Ode, of the first book, were both  written when he was very young; and the latter of them was his first  poetical Essay, which appeared in print. Mr. Hughes, in a private  letter sent to one of his friends, gives it as his opinion, that the  Odes of Horace, are fitter to be paraphrased, than translated.    The Tenth Book of Lucan, was translated by Mr. Hughes, long before Mr.  Rowe undertook that author. The occasion of it was this: Mr. Tonson  the bookseller, sollicited a translation of Lucan, by several hands.  Mr. Hughes performed his part, but others failing in their promises,  the design was dropp'd; and Mr. Rowe was afterwards prevailed upon to  undertake the whole, which he performed with great success.    In the year 1709 Mr. Hughes obliged the publick, with an elegant  translation of Moliere's celebrated Comedy, the Misantrope. This has  been since reprinted, with the other plays of that admirable author,  translated by Mr. Ozell; but care is taken to distinguish this  particular play.    In the year 1712 his Opera of Calypso and Telemachus, was performed at  the Queen's Theatre in the Hay-Market. Perhaps it may be worth while  to mention here, one circumstance concerning this Opera, as it relates  to the History of Music in England, and discovers the great partiality  shewn at that time to Opera's performed in Italian. After many such  had been encouraged by large subscriptions, this, originally written,  and set in English, after the Italian manner, was prepared with the  usual expence of scenes and decorations; and being much crowded and  applauded at the rehearsals, a subscription was obtained for it as  usual.    This alarmed the whole Italian band, who, apprehending that their  profession would suffer thereby, procured an order from the duke of  Shrewsbury, then lord chamberlain, the day before the performing of  this Opera, to take off the subscription for it, and to open the house  at the lowest prices, or not at all. This was designed to sink it, but  failed of its end. It was performed, formed, though under such  great discouragement; and was revived afterwards at the theatre  in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. Mr. Addison, in the Spectator, Numb. 405,  speaking of the just applause given this opera, by Signior Nicolini  (who he says was the greatest performer in dramatic music, that  perhaps ever appeared upon a stage) has these words,    'The town is highly obliged to that excellent artist, for having shewn  us the Italian music in its perfection, as well as for that generous  approbation he gave to an Opera of our own country, in which Mr.  Galliard the composer endeavoured to do justice to the beauty of the  words, by following that noble example which has been set him by the  greatest foreign masters of that art.'    The Ode to the Creator of the World, occasioned by the fragments of  Orpheus, was printed in the year 1713, at the particular instance of  Mr. Addison; and is mentioned with applause in the Spectator. This,  and the Extasy, (published since the death of the author) are justly  esteemed two of the noblest Odes in our language. The seventh Stanza  of the last mentioned piece, is so sublimely excellent, that it would  be denying ourselves, and our poetical readers, a pleasure not to  transcribe it. The whole of this Ode is beautifully heightened, and  poetically conceived. It furnished a hint to a living Poet to write  what he entitles the Excursion, which tho' it has very great merit,  yet falls infinitely short of this animated Ode of Mr. Hughes.    After having represented the natural and artificial calamities to  which man is doomed, he proceeds,      But why do I delay my flight?        Or on such gloomy objects gaze?    I go to realms serene, with ever-living light.    Haste, clouds and whirlwinds, haste a raptured bard to raise;      Mount me sublime along the shining way,      Where planets, in pure streams of Aether driven,        Swim thro' the blue expanse of heav'n.    And lo! th' obsequious clouds and winds obey!    And lo! again the nations downward fly;    And wide-stretch'd kingdoms perish from my eye.          Heav'n! what bright visions now arise!        What op'ning worlds my ravish'd sense surprize!        I pass Cerulian gulphs, and now behold        New solid globes; their weight self-ballanc'd, bear          Unprop'd amidst the fluid air,    And all, around the central Sun, incircling eddies roll'd.        Unequal in their course, see they advance          And form the planetary dance!        Here the pale Moon, whom the same laws ordain          T' obey the earth, and rule the main;        Here spots no more in shadowy streaks appear;          But lakes instead, and groves of trees,          The wand'ring muse, transported sees,      And their tall heads discover'd mountains rear.      And now once more, I downward cast my sight,      When lo! the earth, a larger moon displays,      Far off, amidst the heav'ns, her silver face,      And to her sister moons by turns gives light!    Her seas are shadowy spots, her land a milky white.    The author of an Essay on Criticism, printed in the year 1728, informs  us, that the Tragedy of Cato being brought upon the stage in 1713 was  owing to Mr. Hughes. The circumstances recorded by this author are so  remarkable, that they deserve to be related; and as they serve to shew  the high opinion Mr. Addison entertained of our author's abilities as  a Poet, I shall therefore transcribe his own words.--    'It has been often said by good judges, that Cato was no proper  subject for a dramatic poem: That the character of a stoic  philosopher, is inconsistent with the hurry and tumult of action,  and passions which are the soul of tragedy. That the ingenious author  miscarried in the plan of his work, but supported it by the dignity,  the purity, the beauty, and justness of the sentiments. This was so  much the opinion of Mr. Maynwaring, who was generally allowed to be  the best critic of our time; that he was against bringing the play  upon the stage, and it lay by unfinished many years. That it was  play'd at last was owing to Mr. Hughes. He had read the four acts  which were finished, and really thought it would be of service to  the public, to have it represented at the latter end of queen  Anne's reign, when the spirit of liberty was likely to be lost. He  endeavoured to bring Mr. Addison into his opinion, which he did, and  consented it should be acted if Mr. Hughes would write the last act;  and he offered him the scenery for his assistance, excusing his  not finishing it himself, upon account of some other avocations. He  press'd Mr. Hughes to do it so earnestly, that he was prevailed upon,  and set about it. But, a week after, seeing Mr. Addison again, with  an intention to communicate to him what he thought of it, he was  agreeably surprized at his producing some papers, where near half of  the act was written by the author himself, who took fire at the hint,  that it would be serviceable; and, upon a second reflexion, went  through with the fifth act, not that he was diffident of Mr. Hughes's  abilities; but knowing that no man could have so perfect a notion of  his design as himself, who had been so long, and so carefully thinking  of it. I was told this by Mr. Hughes, and I tell it to shew, that it  was not for the love-scenes, that Mr. Addison consented to have his  Tragedy acted, but to support public spirit; which in the opinion of  the author was then declining.'    In the year 1720 the Siege of Damascus was acted at the Theatre-Royal  in Drury-Lane, with universal applause. His present majesty honoured  it with his presence, and the late queen distinguished it with marks  of favour.    Mr. Hughes drew up the dedication of this Tragedy to the late Earl  Cowper, about ten days before he died.
