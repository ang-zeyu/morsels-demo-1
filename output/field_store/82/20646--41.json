The old lady listened, and then, gazing steadfastly in the damsel's face,  shed tears, and taking her hand, kissed her forehead, and led her into  the house, where she and some other women dwelt quite by themselves,  doing divers kinds of handiwork in silk and palm leaves and leather.  Wherein the damsel in a few days acquired some skill, and thenceforth  wrought together with them; and rose wondrous high in the favour and good  graces of all the ladies, who soon taught her their language.    Now while the damsel, mourned at home as lost and dead, dwelt thus at  Susa, it so befell that, Mariabdela being then King of Tunis, a young  chieftain in Granada, of great power, and backed by mighty allies, gave  out that the realm of Tunis belonged to him, and having gathered a vast  army, made a descent upon Tunis with intent to expel the King from the  realm. Martuccio Gomito, who knew the language of Barbary well, heard the  tidings in prison, and learning that the King of Tunis was mustering a  mighty host for the defence of his kingdom, said to one of the warders  that were in charge of him and his comrades:--\"If I might have speech of  the King, I am confident that the advice that I should give him would  secure him the victory.\" The warder repeated these words to his chief,  who forthwith carried them to the King. Wherefore by the King's command  Martuccio was brought before him, and being asked by him what the advice,  of which he had spoken, might be, answered on this wise:--\"Sire, if in  old days, when I was wont to visit this country of yours, I duly observed  the manner in which you order your battle, methinks you place your main  reliance upon archers; and therefore, if you could contrive that your  enemy's supply of arrows should give out and your own continue plentiful,  I apprehend that you would win the battle.\" \"Ay indeed,\" replied the  King, \"I make no doubt that, could I but accomplish that, I should  conquer.\" \"Nay but, Sire,\" returned Martuccio, \"you may do it, if you  will. Listen, and I will tell you how. You must fit the bows of your  archers with strings much finer than those that are in common use, and  match them with arrows, the notches of which will not admit any but these  fine strings; and this you must do so secretly that your enemy may not  know it, else he will find means to be even with you. Which counsel I  give you for the following reason:--When your and your enemy's archers  have expended all their arrows, you wot that the enemy will fall to  picking up the arrows that your men have shot during the battle, and your  men will do the like by the enemy's arrows; but the enemy will not be  able to make use of your men's arrows, by reason that their fine notches  will not suffice to admit the stout strings, whereas your men will be in  the contrary case in regard of the enemy's arrows, for the fine string  will very well receive the large-notched arrow, and so your men will have  an abundant supply of arrows, while the enemy will be at a loss for  them.\"    The King, who lacked not sagacity, appreciated Martuccio's advice, and  gave full effect to it; whereby he came out of the war a conqueror, and  Martuccio, being raised to the chief place in his favour, waxed rich and  powerful. Which matters being bruited throughout the country, it came to  the ears of Gostanza that Martuccio Gomito, whom she had long supposed to  be dead, was alive; whereby her love for him, some embers of which still  lurked in her heart, burst forth again in sudden flame, and gathered  strength, and revived her dead hope. Wherefore she frankly told all her  case to the good lady with whom she dwelt, saying that she would fain go  to Tunis, that her eyes might have assurance of that which the report  received by her ears had made them yearn to see. The lady fell heartily  in with the girl's desire, and, as if she had been her mother, embarked  with her for Tunis, where on their arrival they were honourably received  in the house of one of her kinswomen. Carapresa, who had attended her,  being sent to discover what she might touching Martuccio, brought back  word that he was alive, and high in honour and place. The gentlewoman was  minded that none but herself should apprise Martuccio of the arrival of  his Gostanza: wherefore she hied her one day to Martuccio, and  said:--\"Martuccio, there is come to my house a servant of thine from  Lipari, who would fain speak with thee here privily, and for that he  would not have me trust another, I am come hither myself to deliver his  message.\" Martuccio thanked her, and forthwith hied him with her to her  house: where no sooner did the girl see him than she all but died for  joy, and carried away by her feelings, fell upon his neck with open arms  and embraced him, and, what with sorrow of his past woes and her present  happiness, said never a word, but softly wept. Martuccio regarded her for  a while in silent wonder; then, heaving a sigh, he said:--\"Thou livest  then, my Gostanza? Long since I heard that thou wast lost; nor was aught  known of thee at home.\" Which said, he tenderly and with tears embraced  her. Gostanza told him all her adventures, and how honourably she had  been entreated by the gentlewoman with whom she had dwelt. And so long  time they conversed, and then Martuccio parted from her, and hied him  back to his lord the King, and told him all, to wit, his own adventures  and those of the girl, adding that with his leave he was minded to marry  her according to our law. Which matters the King found passing strange;  and having called the girl to him, and learned from her that 'twas even  as Martuccio had said:--\"Well indeed,\" quoth he, \"hast thou won thy  husband.\" Then caused he gifts most ample and excellent to be brought  forth, part of which he gave to Gostanza, and part to Martuccio, leaving  them entirely to their own devices in regard of one another. Then  Martuccio, in terms most honourable, bade farewell to the old lady with  whom Gostanza had dwelt, thanking her for the service she had rendered to  Gostanza, and giving her presents suited to her condition, and commending  her to God, while Gostanza shed many a tear: after which, by leave of the  King, they went aboard a light bark, taking with them Carapresa, and,  sped by a prosperous breeze, arrived at Lipari, where they were received  with such cheer as 'twere vain to attempt to describe. There were  Martuccio and Gostanza wedded with all pomp and splendour; and there long  time in easeful peace they had joyance of their love.      NOVEL III.    --  Pietro Boccamazza runs away with Agnolella, and encounters a gang of  robbers: the girl takes refuge in a wood, and is guided to a castle.  Pietro is taken, but escapes out of the hands of the robbers, and after  some adventures arrives at the castle where Agnolella is, marries her,  and returns with her to Rome.  --    Ended Emilia's story, which none of the company spared to commend, the  queen, turning to Elisa, bade her follow suit; and she, with glad  obedience, thus began:--    'Tis a story, sweet ladies, of a woeful night passed by two indiscreet  young lovers that I have in mind; but, as thereon ensued not a few days  of joy, 'tis not inapposite to our argument, and shall be narrated.    'Tis no long time since at Rome, which, albeit now the tail,(1) was of  yore the head, of the world, there dwelt a young man, Pietro Boccamazza  by name, a scion of one of the most illustrious of the Roman houses, who  became enamoured of a damsel exceeding fair, and amorous withal--her name  Agnolella--the daughter of one Gigliuozzo Saullo, a plebeian, but in high  repute among the Romans. Nor, loving thus, did Pietro lack the address to  inspire in Agnolella a love as ardent as his own. Wherefore, overmastered  by his passion, and minded no longer to endure the sore suffering that it  caused him, he asked her in marriage. Whereof his kinsfolk were no sooner  apprised, than with one accord they came to him and strongly urged him to  desist from his purpose: they also gave Gigliuozzo Saullo to understand  that he were best to pay no sort of heed to Pietro's words, for that, if  he so did, they would never acknowledge him as friend or relative. Thus  to see himself debarred of the one way by which he deemed he might attain  to his desire, Pietro was ready to die for grief, and, all his kinsfolk  notwithstanding, he would have married Gigliuozzo's daughter, had but the  father consented. Wherefore at length he made up his mind that, if the  girl were willing, nought should stand in the way; and having through a  common friend sounded the damsel and found her apt, he brought her to  consent to elope with him from Rome. The affair being arranged, Pietro  and she took horse betimes one morning, and sallied forth for Anagni,  where Pietro had certain friends, in whom he placed much trust; and as  they rode, time not serving for full joyance of their love, for they  feared pursuit, they held converse thereof, and from time to time  exchanged a kiss. Now it so befell, that, the way being none too well  known to Pietro, when, perhaps eight miles from Rome, they should have  turned to the right, they took instead a leftward road. Whereon when they  had ridden but little more than two miles, they found themselves close to  a petty castle, whence, so soon as they were observed, there issued some  dozen men at arms; and, as they drew near, the damsel, espying them, gave  a cry, and said:--\"We are attacked,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13111"],[0,"The Brain and the Voice in Speech and Song (#6)"],[1,"of the two to two  and a half octaves? If the vocal cords are observed by means of the  laryngoscope during phonation, no change is _seen_, owing to the rapidity  of the vibrations, although a scale of an octave may be sung; in the lower  notes, however, the vocal cords are seen not so closely approximated as in  the very high notes. This may account for the difficulty experienced in  singing high notes piano. Sir Felix Semon in a Friday evening lecture at  the Royal Institution showed some remarkable photographs, by Dr. French, of  the larynx of two great singers, a contralto and a high soprano, during  vocalisation, which exhibit changes in the length of the vocal cords and in  the size of the slit between them. Moreover, the photographs show that the  vocal cords at the break from the lower to the upper register exhibit  characteristic changes.    [Illustration: Fig. 11]    [Description: Fig. 11.--Drawings after Dr. French's photographs in Sir  Felix Semon's lecture on the Voice, (1) Appearance of vocal cords of  contralto singer when singing F# to D; it will be observed that the cords  increase in length with the rise of the pitch, presumably the whole cord is  vibrating, including the inner strand of the vocal muscle. At the break  from D to E (3 and 4) the cords suddenly become shorter and thicker;  presumably the inner portion of the vocal muscle (thyro-arytenoid) is  contracting strongly, permitting only the edge of the cord to vibrate. For  the next octave the cords are stretched longer and longer; this may be  explained by the increasing force of contraction of the tensor muscle  stretching the cords and the contained muscle, which is also contracted.]    When we desire to produce a particular vocal sound, a mental perception of  the sound, which is almost instinctive in a person with a musical ear,  awakens by association motor centres in the brain that preside over the  innervation currents necessary for the approximation and minute alterations  in the tensions of the vocal cords requisite for the production of a  particular note. We are not conscious of any kinaesthetic (sense of  movement) guiding sensations from the laryngeal muscles, but we are of the  muscles of the tongue, lips, and jaw in the production of articulate  sounds. It is remarkable that there are hardly any sensory nerve endings in  the vocal cords and muscles of the larynx, consequently it is not  surprising to find that the ear is the guiding sense for correct modulation  of the loudness and pitch of the speaking as well as the singing voice. In  reading music, visual symbols produced by one individual awakens in the  mind of another mental auditory perceptions of sound varying in pitch,  duration, and loudness. Complex neuro-muscular mechanisms preside over  these two functions of the vocal instrument. The instrument is under the  control of the will as regards the production of the notes in loudness and  duration, but not so as regards pitch; for without the untaught instinctive  sense of the mental perception of musical sounds correct intonation cannot  be obtained by any effort of the will. The untaught ability of correct  appreciation of variations in the pitch of notes and the memorising and  producing of the same vocally are termed a musical ear. A gift even to a  number of people of poor intelligence, it may or may not be associated with  the sense of rhythm, which, as we have seen, is dependent upon the mental  perception of successive movements associated with a sound. Both correct  modulation and rhythm are essential for melody. The sense of hearing is the  primary incitation to the voice. This accounts for the fact that children  who have learnt to speak, and suffer in early life with ear disease, lose  the use of their vocal instrument unless they are trained by lip language  and imitation to speak. The remarkable case of Helen Keller, who was born  blind and deaf, and yet learned by the tactile motor sensibility of the  fingers to feel the vibrations of the vocal organ and translate the  perceptions of these vibrations into movements of the lips and tongue  necessary for articulation, is one of the most remarkable facts in  physiological psychology. Her voice, however, was monotonous, and lacked  the modulation in pitch of a musical voice. Music meant little to her but  beat and pulsation. She could not sing and she could not play the piano.  The fact that Beethoven composed some of his grandest symphonies when stone  deaf shows the extraordinary musical faculty he must have preserved to bear  in his mind the grand harmonies that he associated with visual symbols.  Still, it is impossible that Beethoven, had he been deaf in his early  childhood, could ever have developed into the great musical genius that he  became.    [Illustration: Fig. 12]    [Description: Fig. 12.--Diagram showing the position of the larynx in  respect to the resonator and tongue. The position of the vocal cords is  shown, but really they would not be seen unless one half of the shield  cartilage were cut away so as to show the interior of the voice-box. Sound  vibrations are represented issuing from the larynx, and here they become  modified by the resonator; the throat portion of the resonator is shown  continuous with the nasal passages; the mouth portion of the resonator is  not in action, owing to the closure of the jaw and lips. The white spaces  in the bones of the skull are air sinuses. In such a condition of the  resonator, as in humming a tune, the sound waves must issue by the nasal  passages, and therefore they acquire a nasal character.]          III. THE RESONATOR AND ARTICULATOR      _The Resonator_.--The resonator is an irregular-shaped tube with a bend in  the middle; the vertical portion is formed by the larynx and pharynx, the  horizontal by the mouth. The length of the resonator, from the vocal cords  to the lips, is about 6.5 to 7 inches (_vide_ fig. 12). The walls of the  vertical portion are formed by the vertebral column and the muscles of the  pharynx behind, the cartilages of the larynx and the muscles of the pharynx  at the sides, and the thyroid cartilage, the epiglottis, and the root of  the tongue in front; these structures form the walls of the throat and are  all covered with a mucous membrane. This portion of the resonator passage  can be enlarged to a slight degree by traction upon the larynx below  (sterno-thyroid muscle), by looseness of the pharyngeal muscles, and still  more by the forward placement of the tongue; the converse is true as  regards diminution in size. The horizontal portion of the resonator tube  (the mouth) has for its roof the soft palate and the hard palate, the  tongue for its floor, and cheeks, lips, jaw, and teeth for its walls. The  interior dimensions of this portion of the resonator can be greatly  modified by movements of the jaw, the soft palate, and the tongue, while  the shape and form of its orifice is modified by the lips.    There are accessory resonator cavities, and the most important of these is  the nose; its cavity is entirely enclosed in bone and cartilage,  consequently it is immovable; this cavity may or may not be closed to the  sonorous waves by the elevation of the soft palate. When the mouth is  closed, as in the production of the consonant m, e.g. in singing _me_, a  nasal quality is imparted to the voice, and if a mirror be placed under the  nostrils it will be seen by the vapour on it that the sound waves have  issued from the nose; consequently the nasal portion of the resonator has  imparted its characteristic quality to the sound. The air sinuses in the  upper jaws, frontal bones, and sphenoid bones act as accessory resonators;  likewise the bronchi, windpipe, and lungs; but all these are of lesser  importance compared with the principal resonating chamber of the mouth and  throat. If the mouth be closed and a tune be hummed the whole of the  resonating chambers are in action, and the sound being emitted from the  nose the nasal quality is especially marked. But no sound waves are  produced unless the air finds an exit; thus a tune cannot be hummed if both  mouth and nostrils are closed.    From the description that I have given above, it will be observed that the  mouth, controlled by the movements of the jaw, tongue, and lips, is best  adapted for the purpose of articulate speech; and that the throat, which is  less actively movable and contains the vocal cords, must have greater  influence on the sound vibrations without participating in the articulation  of words. While the vocal cords serve the purpose of the reed, the  resonator forms the body of the vocal instrument. Every sound passes  through it; every vowel and consonant in the production of syllables and  words must be formed by it, and the whole character and individual  qualities of the speaking as well as the singing voice depend in great part  upon the manner in which it is used.    The acoustic effect is due to the resonances generated by hollow spaces of  the resonator, and Dr. Aikin, in his work on \"The Voice,\" points out that  we can study the resonances yielded by these hollow spaces by whispering  the vocal sounds; but it is necessary to put the resonator under favourable  conditions for the most efficient production. When a vowel sound is  whispered the glottis is open (_vide_ fig. 10) and the vocal cords are not  thrown into vibration; yet each vowel sound is associated with a distinct  musical note, and we can produce a whole octave by alteration of the  resonator in whispering the vowel sounds. In order to do this efficiently  it is necessary to use the bellows and the resonator to the best advantage;  therefore, after taking a deep inspiration in the manner previously  described, the air is expelled through the open glottis into the resonating  cavity, which (as fig. 13 shows) is placed under different conditions  according to the particular vowel sound whispered.
