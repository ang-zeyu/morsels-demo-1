But here, though both Jews and Christians claimed to  be worshippers of a single God, and although the Jews took for their  protector Abraham, the mighty founder of Mahomet's own city, yet there  was nothing between all the sects but fruitless strife. He saw the Jews  looking disdainfully upon the Christian dogs, and the Christians firmly  convinced that an irrevocable doom would shortly descend upon every Jew.  Both united in condemning to eternal wrath the idol-worshippers of the  Kaaba. It was a fiercely outspoken, remorseless enmity that he saw around  him, and the impotence born of distrust he saw also.    It is not possible that any hint of his future mission enlightened him as  to the part he was to play in eliminating this conflict, but may it not  be that there was sown in his mind a seed of thought concerning the  uselessness of all this strife of religions, and the limitless power that  might accrue to his nation if it could but be persuaded to become united  in allegiance to the one true God? For even at that early stage Mahomet,  with the examples of Judaism and Christianity before him, must have  rejected, even if unthinkingly, the polytheistic idea.    The poetic and warlike contests partook of the fiery earnestness  characteristic of the combatants, and it was seldom that the fair at  Ocatz passed by without some hostile demonstration. The greatest rivals  were the Kureisch and the Hawazin, a tribe dwelling between Mecca and  Taif.    The Hawazin were tumultuous and unruly, and the Kureisch ever ready to  rouse their hostility by numerous small slights and taunts. We read  traditionally of an insult by some Kureisch youths towards a girl of the  Hawazin; this incident was closed peaceably, but some years later the  Kureisch (always the aggressive party because of their stronghold in  Mecca) committed an outrage that could not be passed over. As the fair  progressed, news came of the murder of a Hawazin, chief of a caravan, and  the seizure of his treasure by an ally of the Kureisch. That tribe,  knowing themselves at a disadvantage and fearing vengeance, fled back to  Mecca. The Hawazin pursued them remorselessly to the borders of the  sacred precincts, beyond which it was sacrilegious to wage war. Some  traditions say they followed their foe undaunted by fear of divine wrath,  and thus incurred a double disgrace of having fought in the sacred month  and within the sacred territory. But their pursuit cannot have lasted  long, because we find them challenging the Kureisch to battle at the same  time the next year. All Mahomet's uncles took part in the Sacrilegious  War that followed, and stirring times continued for Mahomet until a truce  was made after four years. He attended his uncles in warfare, and we hear  of his collecting the enemy's arrows that fell harmlessly into their  lines, in order to reinforce the Kureisch ammunition.    A vivid picture by the hand of tradition is this period in Mahomet's  life, for he was between eighteen and nineteen, just at the age when  fighting would appeal to his wild, yet determined nature. He must have  learned resource and some of the stratagem of war from this attendance  upon warriors, if he did not become filled with much physical daring,  never one of his characteristics, nor, indeed, of any man of his nervous  temperament, and his imagination was certainly kindled by the spectacle  of the horrors and triumphs of strife. Several battles were fought with  varying success, until at the end of about five years' fighting both  sides were weary and a truce was called. It was found that twenty more  Hawazin had been killed than Kureisch, and according to the simple yet  equitable custom of the time, a like number of hostages was given to the  Hawazin that there might not be blood feud between them.    The Kureisch passed as suddenly into peace as they had plunged into  strife. After the Sacrilegious War, a period of prosperity began for the  city of Mecca. It was wealthy enough to support its population, and trade  flourished with the marts of Bostra, Damascus, and Northern Syria. Its  political condition had never been very stable, and it seems to have  preserved during the Omeyyad ascendancy the same loose but roughly  effective organisation that it possessed under the Hashim branch. The  intellect that could see the potentialities of such a polity, once it  could be knit together by some common bond, had not arisen; but the scene  was prepared for his coming, and we have to think of the Mecca of that  time as offering untold suggestions for its religious, and later for its  political, salvation to a mind anxious to produce, but uncertain as yet  of its medium.    Mahomet returned with Abu Talib, and passed with him into obscurity of a  poverty not too burdensome, and to a quiet, somewhat reflective  household. He lived under the spell of that tranquillity until he was  twenty-five, and of this time there is not much notice in the traditions,  but its contemplation is revealed to us in the earlier chapters of the  Kuran. At one time Mahomet acted as shepherd upon the Meccan hills--low,  rocky ranges covered with a dull scrub, and open to the limitless vaults  of sky. Here, whether under sun or stars, he learned that love and awe of  Nature that throbs through the early chapters of the Kuran like a deep  organ note of praise, dominated almost always with fear.    \"Consider the Heaven--with His Hand has He built it up, and given it its  vastness--and the Earth has He stretched out like a carpet, smoothly has  He spread it forth! Verily, God is the sole sustainer, possessed of  might, the unshaken! Fly then to God.\"    Indeed, a haunting terror broods over all those souls who know the  desert, and this fear translated into action becomes fierce and terrible  deeds, and into the world of the spirit, angry dogmatic commands. It is  the result of the knowledge that to those who stray from the well-known  desert track comes death; equally certain is the destruction of the soul  for those who transgress against the law of the Ruler of the earth. The  God of the early Kuran is the spiritual representative of the forces  surrounding Mahomet, whether of Nature or government. The country around  Mecca conveys one central thought to one who meditates--the sense of  power, not the might of one kindly and familiar, but the unapproachable  sovereignty of one alien and remote, a dweller in far-off places, who  nevertheless fills the earth with his dominion. Mahomet passing by, as he  did, the gaieties and temptations of youth, had his mind alert for the  influences of this Nature, full of awful power, and for the contemplation  of life and the Universe around him.    In common with many enthusiasts and men of action, certain sides of his  nature, especially the sexual and the practical, awoke late, and were  preceded by a reflective period wherein the poet held full sway. He never  desired the companionship of those of his own age and their rather  debased pleasures. There are legends of his being miraculously preserved  from the corruption of the youthful vices of Mecca, but the more probable  reason for his shunning them is that they made no appeal to his desires.  Some minds and tastes unfold by imperceptible degrees--flowers that  attain fruition by the shedding of their earlier petals. Mahomet was of  this nature. At this time the poet was paramount in his mental activities  He loved silence and solitude, so that he might use those imaginative and  contemplative gifts of which he felt himself to possess so large a share.    It is not possible at this distance of time to attempt to estimate the  importance of this period in Mahomet's mental development. There are not  sufficient data to enable history to fill in any detailed sketch, but the  outlines may be safely indicated by the help of his later life and the  testimony of that commentary upon his feelings and actions, the Kuran.  His nature now seems to be in a pause of expectation, whose vain urgency  lasted until he became convinced of his prophetic mission. He must have  been at this time the seeker, whose youth, if not his very eagerness,  prevented his attaining what he sought. He was earnest and sincere, grave  beyond his years, and so gained from his fellows the respect always meted  out, in an essentially religion-loving community, to any who give promise  of future \"inspiration,\" before its actuality has rendered him too  uncomfortable a citizen. He received from his comrades the title of  Al-Amin (the Faithful), and continued his life apart from his kind,  performing his duties well, but still remaining aloof from others as  one not of their world. From his sojourn in the mountains came the  inspiration that created the poetry of the Kuran and the reflective  interest in what he knew of his world and its religion; both embryos, but  especially the latter, germinated in his mind until they emerged into  full consciousness and became his fire of religious conviction, and his  zeal for the foundation and glory of Islam.          CHAPTER IV      ADVENTURE AND SECURITY    \"Women are the twin-halves of men.\"--MAHOMET.    Abu Talib's straitened circumstances never prevented him from treating  his foster-child with all the affection of which his kindly but somewhat  weak character was capable. But the cares of a growing family soon became  too much for his means, and when Mahomet was about twenty-five his uncle  suggested that he should embark upon a mercantile journey for some rich  trader in Mecca. We can imagine Mahomet, immersed in his solitudes,  responding reluctantly to a call that could not be evaded. He was not by  nature a trader, and the proposal was repugnant to him, except for his  desire to help his uncle, and more than this, his curiosity to revisit at  a more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10743"],[0,"Moonfleet (#6)"],[1,"wriggling my  body up under the tombstone on to the churchyard grass, and was once more  in the low evening sunlight and the soft sweet air.    Home I ran to my aunt's, for it was past tea-time, and beside that I knew  I must fetch a candle if I were ever to search out the passage; and to  search it I had well made up my mind, no matter how much I was scared for  this moment. My aunt gave me but a sorry greeting when I came into the  kitchen, for I was late and hot. She never said much when displeased, but  had a way of saying nothing, which was much worse; and would only reply  yes or no, and that after an interval, to anything that was asked of her.  So the meal was silent enough, for she had finished before I arrived, and  I ate but little myself being too much occupied with the thought of my  strange discovery, and finding, beside, the tea lukewarm and the victuals  not enticing.    You may guess that I said nothing of what I had seen, but made up my mind  that as soon as my aunt's back was turned I would get a candle and  tinder-box, and return to the churchyard. The sun was down before Aunt  Jane gave thanks for what we had received, and then, turning to me, she  said in a cold and measured voice:    'John, I have observed that you are often out and about of nights,  sometimes as late as half past seven or eight. Now, it is not seemly for  young folk to be abroad after dark, and I do not choose that my nephew  should be called a gadabout. \"What's bred in the bone will come out in  the flesh\", and 'twas with such loafing that your father began his wild  ways, and afterwards led my poor sister such a life as never was, till  the mercy of Providence took him away.'    Aunt Jane often spoke thus of my father, whom I never remembered, but  believe him to have been an honest man and good fellow to boot, if  something given to roaming and to the contraband.    'So understand', she went on, 'that I will not have you out again this  evening, no, nor any other evening, after dusk. Bed is the place for  youth when night falls, but if this seem to you too early you can sit  with me for an hour in the parlour, and I will read you a discourse of  Doctor Sherlock that will banish vain thoughts, and leave you in a fit  frame for quiet sleep.'    So she led the way into the parlour, took the book from the shelf, put it  on the table within the little circle of light cast by a shaded candle,  and began. It was dull enough, though I had borne such tribulations  before, and the drone of my aunt's voice would have sent me to sleep, as  it had done at other times, even in a straight-backed chair, had I not  been so full of my discovery, and chafed at this delay. Thus all the time  my aunt read of spiritualities and saving grace, I had my mind on  diamonds and all kinds of mammon, for I never doubted that Blackbeard's  treasure would be found at the end of that secret passage. The sermon  finished at last, and my aunt closed the book with a stiff 'good night'  for me. I was for giving her my formal kiss, but she made as if she did  not see me and turned away; so we went upstairs each to our own room, and  I never kissed Aunt Jane again.    There was a moon three-quarters full, already in the sky, and on  moonlight nights I was allowed no candle to show me to bed. But on that  night I needed none, for I never took off my clothes, having resolved to  wait till my aunt was asleep, and then, ghosts or no ghosts, to make my  way back to the churchyard. I did not dare to put off that visit even  till the morning, lest some chance passer-by should light upon the hole,  and so forestall me with Blackbeard's treasure.    Thus I lay wide awake on my bed watching the shadow of the tester-post  against the whitewashed wall, and noting how it had moved, by degrees, as  the moon went farther round. At last, just as it touched the picture of  the Good Shepherd which hung over the mantelpiece, I heard my aunt  snoring in her room, and knew that I was free. Yet I waited a few minutes  so that she might get well on with her first sleep, and then took off my  boots, and in stockinged feet slipped past her room and down the stairs.  How stair, handrail, and landing creaked that night, and how my feet and  body struck noisily against things seen quite well but misjudged in the  effort not to misjudge them! And yet there was the note of safety still  sounding, for the snoring never ceased, and the sleeper woke not, though  her waking then might have changed all my life. So I came safely to the  kitchen, and there put in my pocket one of the best winter candles and  the tinder-box, and as I crept out of the room heard suddenly how loud  the old clock was ticking, and looking up saw the bright brass band  marking half past ten on the dial.    Out in the street I kept in the shadow of the houses as far as I might,  though all was silent as the grave; indeed, I think that when the moon is  bright a great hush falls always upon Nature, as though she was taken up  in wondering at her own beauty. Everyone was fast asleep in Moonfleet and  there was no light in any window; only when I came opposite the Why Not?  I saw from the red glow behind the curtains that the bottom room was lit  up, so Elzevir was not yet gone to bed. It was strange, for the Why Not?  had been shut up early for many a long night past, and I crossed over  cautiously to see if I could make out what was going forward. But that  was not to be done, for the panes were thickly steamed over; and this  surprised me more as showing that there was a good company inside.  Moreover, as I stood and listened I could hear a mutter of deep voices  inside, not as of roisterers, but of sober men talking low.    Eagerness would not let me wait long, and I was off across the meadows  towards the church, though not without sad misgivings as soon as the last  house was left well behind me. At the churchyard wall my courage had  waned somewhat: it seemed a shameless thing to come to rifle Blackbeard's  treasure just in the very place and hour that Blackbeard loved; and as I  passed the turnstile I half-expected that a tall figure, hairy and  evil-eyed, would spring out from the shadow on the north side of the  church. But nothing stirred, and the frosty grass sounded crisp under my  feet as I made across the churchyard, stepping over the graves and  keeping always out of the shadows, towards the black clump of yew-trees  on the far side.    When I got round the yews, there was the tomb standing out white against  them, and at the foot of the tomb was the hole like a patch of black  velvet spread upon the ground, it was so dark. Then, for a moment, I  thought that Blackbeard might be lying in wait in the bottom of the hole,  and I stood uncertain whether to go on or back. I could catch the rustle  of the water on the beach--not of any waves, for the bay was smooth as  glass, but just a lipper at the fringe; and wishing to put off with any  excuse the descent into the passage, though I had quite resolved to make  it, I settled with myself that I would count the water wash twenty times,  and at the twentieth would let myself down into the hole. Only seven  wavelets had come in when I forgot to count, for there, right in the  middle of the moon's path across the water, lay a lugger moored broadside  to the beach. She was about half a mile out, but there was no mistake,  for though her sails were lowered her masts and hull stood out black  against the moonlight. Here was a fresh reason for delay, for surely one  must consider what this craft could be, and what had brought her here.  She was too small for a privateer, too large for a fishing-smack, and  could not be a revenue boat by her low freeboard in the waist; and 'twas  a strange thing for a boat to cast anchor in the midst of Moonfleet Bay  even on a night so fine as this. Then while I watched I saw a blue flare  in the bows, only for a moment, as if a man had lit a squib and flung it  overboard, but I knew from it she was a contrabandier, and signalling  either to the shore or to a mate in the offing. With that, courage came  back, and I resolved to make this flare my signal for getting down into  the hole, screwing my heart up with the thought that if Blackbeard was  really waiting for me there, 'twould be little good to turn tail now, for  he would be after me and could certainly run much faster than I. Then I  took one last look round, and down into the hole forthwith, the same way  as I had got down earlier in the day. So on that February night John  Trenchard found himself standing in the heap of loose fallen mould at the  bottom of the hole, with a mixture of courage and cowardice in his heart,  but overruling all a great desire to get at Blackbeard's diamond.    Out came tinder-box and candle, and I was glad indeed when the light  burned up bright enough to show that no one, at any rate, was standing by  my side. But then there was the passage, and who could say what might be  lurking there? Yet I did not falter, but set out on this adventurous  journey, walking very slowly indeed--but that was from fear of  pitfalls--and nerving myself with the thought of the great diamond which  surely would be found at the end of the passage. What should I not be  able to do with such wealth? I would buy a nag for Mr. Glennie, a new  boat for Ratsey, and a silk gown for Aunt Jane, in spite of her being so  hard with me as on this night. And thus I would make myself the greatest  man in Moonfleet, richer even than Mr. Maskew, and build a stone house in  the sea-meadows with a good prospect of the sea, and marry Grace Maskew  and live happily, and fish. I walked on down the passage, reaching out  the candle as far as might be in front of me, and whistling to keep  myself company, yet saw neither Blackbeard nor anyone else. All the way  there were footprints on the floor, and the roof was black as with smoke  of torches, and this made me fear lest some of"]]]
