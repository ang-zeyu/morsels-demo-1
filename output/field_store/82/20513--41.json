In his anxiety he cast discretion to the winds.  The caution of the  beast was lost in the loyalty of the man, and so it came that he  entered a large clearing, denuded of trees, without a thought of what  might lie there or upon the farther edge to dispute the way with him.    He was half way across when directly in his path and but a few yards  away there rose from a clump of tall grasses a half dozen chattering  birds.  Instantly Tarzan turned aside, for he knew well enough what  manner of creature the presence of these little sentinels proclaimed.  Simultaneously Buto, the rhinoceros, scrambled to his short legs and  charged furiously.  Haphazard charges Buto, the rhinoceros.  With his  weak eyes he sees but poorly even at short distances, and whether his  erratic rushes are due to the panic of fear as he attempts to escape,  or to the irascible temper with which he is generally credited, it is  difficult to determine.  Nor is the matter of little moment to one whom  Buto charges, for if he be caught and tossed, the chances are that  naught will interest him thereafter.    And today it chanced that Buto bore down straight upon Tarzan, across  the few yards of knee-deep grass which separated them.  Accident  started him in the direction of the ape-man, and then his weak eyes  discerned the enemy, and with a series of snorts he charged straight  for him.  The little rhino birds fluttered and circled about their  giant ward.  Among the branches of the trees at the edge of the  clearing, a score or more monkeys chattered and scolded as the loud  snorts of the angry beast sent them scurrying affrightedly to the upper  terraces.  Tarzan alone appeared indifferent and serene.    Directly in the path of the charge he stood.  There had been no time to  seek safety in the trees beyond the clearing, nor had Tarzan any mind  to delay his journey because of Buto.  He had met the stupid beast  before and held him in fine contempt.    And now Buto was upon him, the massive head lowered and the long, heavy  horn inclined for the frightful work for which nature had designed it;  but as he struck upward, his weapon raked only thin air, for the  ape-man had sprung lightly aloft with a catlike leap that carried him  above the threatening horn to the broad back of the rhinoceros.  Another spring and he was on the ground behind the brute and racing  like a deer for the trees.    Buto, angered and mystified by the strange disappearance of his prey,  wheeled and charged frantically in another direction, which chanced to  be not the direction of Tarzan's flight, and so the ape-man came in  safety to the trees and continued on his swift way through the forest.    Some distance ahead of him Tantor moved steadily along the well-worn  elephant trail, and ahead of Tantor a crouching, black warrior listened  intently in the middle of the path.  Presently he heard the sound for  which he had been hoping--the cracking, snapping sound which heralded  the approach of an elephant.    To his right and left in other parts of the jungle other warriors were  watching.  A low signal, passed from one to another, apprised the most  distant that the quarry was afoot.  Rapidly they converged toward the  trail, taking positions in trees down wind from the point at which  Tantor must pass them.  Silently they waited and presently were  rewarded by the sight of a mighty tusker carrying an amount of ivory in  his long tusks that set their greedy hearts to palpitating.    No sooner had he passed their positions than the warriors clambered  from their perches.  No longer were they silent, but instead clapped  their hands and shouted as they reached the ground.  For an instant  Tantor, the elephant, paused with upraised trunk and tail, with great  ears up-pricked, and then he swung on along the trail at a rapid,  shuffling pace--straight toward the covered pit with its sharpened  stakes upstanding in the ground.    Behind him came the yelling warriors, urging him on in the rapid flight  which would not permit a careful examination of the ground before him.  Tantor, the elephant, who could have turned and scattered his  adversaries with a single charge, fled like a frightened deer--fled  toward a hideous, torturing death.    And behind them all came Tarzan of the Apes, racing through the jungle  forest with the speed and agility of a squirrel, for he had heard the  shouts of the warriors and had interpreted them correctly.  Once he  uttered a piercing call that reverberated through the jungle; but  Tantor, in the panic of terror, either failed to hear, or hearing,  dared not pause to heed.    Now the giant pachyderm was but a few yards from the hidden death  lurking in his path, and the blacks, certain of success, were screaming  and dancing in his wake, waving their war spears and celebrating in  advance the acquisition of the splendid ivory carried by their prey and  the surfeit of elephant meat which would be theirs this night.    So intent were they upon their gratulations that they entirely failed  to note the silent passage of the man-beast above their heads, nor did  Tantor, either, see or hear him, even though Tarzan called to him to  stop.    A few more steps would precipitate Tantor upon the sharpened stakes;  Tarzan fairly flew through the trees until he had come abreast of the  fleeing animal and then had passed him.  At the pit's verge the ape-man  dropped to the ground in the center of the trail.  Tantor was almost  upon him before his weak eyes permitted him to recognize his old friend.    \"Stop!\" cried Tarzan, and the great beast halted to the upraised hand.    Tarzan turned and kicked aside some of the brush which hid the pit.  Instantly Tantor saw and understood.    \"Fight!\" growled Tarzan.  \"They are coming behind you.\" But Tantor, the  elephant, is a huge bunch of nerves, and now he was half panic-stricken  by terror.    Before him yawned the pit, how far he did not know, but to right and  left lay the primeval jungle untouched by man.  With a squeal the great  beast turned suddenly at right angles and burst his noisy way through  the solid wall of matted vegetation that would have stopped any but him.    Tarzan, standing upon the edge of the pit, smiled as he watched  Tantor's undignified flight.  Soon the blacks would come.  It was best  that Tarzan of the Apes faded from the scene.  He essayed a step from  the pit's edge, and as he threw the weight of his body upon his left  foot, the earth crumbled away.  Tarzan made a single Herculean effort  to throw himself forward, but it was too late.  Backward and downward  he went toward the sharpened stakes in the bottom of the pit.    When, a moment later, the blacks came they saw even from a distance  that Tantor had eluded them, for the size of the hole in the pit  covering was too small to have accommodated the huge bulk of an  elephant.  At first they thought that their prey had put one great foot  through the top and then, warned, drawn back; but when they had come to  the pit's verge and peered over, their eyes went wide in astonishment,  for, quiet and still, at the bottom lay the naked figure of a white  giant.    Some of them there had glimpsed this forest god before and they drew  back in terror, awed by the presence which they had for some time  believed to possess the miraculous powers of a demon; but others there  were who pushed forward, thinking only of the capture of an enemy, and  these leaped into the pit and lifted Tarzan out.    There was no scar upon his body.  None of the sharpened stakes had  pierced him--only a swollen spot at the base of the brain indicated the  nature of his injury.  In the falling backward his head had struck upon  the side of one of the stakes, rendering him unconscious.  The blacks  were quick to discover this, and equally quick to bind their prisoner's  arms and legs before he should regain consciousness, for they had  learned to harbor a wholesome respect for this strange man-beast that  consorted with the hairy tree folk.    They had carried him but a short distance toward their village when the  ape-man's eyelids quivered and raised.  He looked about him wonderingly  for a moment, and then full consciousness returned and he realized the  seriousness of his predicament.  Accustomed almost from birth to  relying solely upon his own resources, he did not cast about for  outside aid now, but devoted his mind to a consideration of the  possibilities for escape which lay within himself and his own powers.    He did not dare test the strength of his bonds while the blacks were  carrying him, for fear they would become apprehensive and add to them.  Presently his captors discovered that he was conscious, and as they had  little stomach for carrying a heavy man through the jungle heat, they  set him upon his feet and forced him forward among them, pricking him  now and then with their spears, yet with every manifestation of the  superstitious awe in which they held him.    When they discovered that their prodding brought no outward evidence of  suffering, their awe increased, so that they soon desisted, half  believing that this strange white giant was a supernatural being and so  was immune from pain.    As they approached their village, they shouted aloud the victorious  cries of successful warriors, so that by the time they reached the  gate, dancing and waving their spears, a great crowd of men, women, and  children were gathered there to greet them and hear the story of their  adventure.    As the eyes of the villagers fell upon the prisoner, they went wild,  and heavy jaws fell open in astonishment and incredulity.  For months  they had lived in perpetual terror of a weird, white demon whom but few  had ever glimpsed and lived to describe.  Warriors had disappeared from  the paths almost within sight of the village and from the midst of  their companions as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10601"],[0,"The Rangeland Avenger (#6)"],[1,"the summons was an adept with  fist or guns, as the need might be; every one of them had proved that  he had a level head; every one of them was a respected citizen.  Sandersen was one; stocky Buck Mason, carrying two hundred pounds close  to the ground, massive of hand and jaw, was a second. After that their  choice had fallen on \"Judge\" Lodge. The judge wore spectacles and a  judicial air. He had a keen eye for cows and was rather a sharper in  horse trades. He gave his costume a semiofficial air by wearing a  necktie instead of a bandanna, even at a roundup. The glasses, the  necktie, and his little solemn pauses before he delivered an opinion,  had given his nickname.    Then came Denver Jim, a very little man, with nervous hands and  remarkable steady eyes. He had punched cows over those ranges for ten  years, and his experience had made him a wildcat in a fight. Oscar  Larsen was a huge Swede, with a perpetual and foolish grin. Sour Creek  had laughed at Oscar for five years, considered him dubiously for five  years more, and then suddenly admitted him as a man among men. He was  stronger than Buck Mason, quicker than Denver Jim, and shrewder than  the judge. Last of all came Montana. He had a long, sad face,  prodigious ability to stow away redeye, and a nature as simple and kind  and honest as a child's. These were the six men who gathered about and  stared at the center of the floor. Something, they agreed, had to be  done.    \"First it was old man Collins. That was two years back,\" said Judge  Lodge. \"You boys remember how Collins went. Then there was the drifter  that was plugged eight months ago. And now it's Ollie Quade. Gents,  three murders in two years is too much. Sour Creek'll get a name. The  bad ones will begin to drop in on us and use us for headquarters. We  got to make an example. We never got the ones that shot Collins or the  drifter. Since Quade has been plugged we got to hang somebody. Ain't  that straight?\"    \"We got to hang somebody,\" said Denver Jim. \"The point is--who?\"    His keen eyes went slowly, hungrily, from face to face, as if he would  not have greatly objected to picking one of his companions in that very  room.    \"Is they any strangers in town?\" asked Larsen with his peculiar,  foolish grin.    Sandersen stirred in his chair; his heart leaped.    \"There's a gent named Riley Sinclair nobody ain't never seen before.\"    \"When did he come in?\"    \"Along about dark.\"    \"That's the right time for us. You found Quade a long time dead, Bill.\"    Sandersen swallowed. In his joy he could have embraced Larsen.    \"What'll we do?\"    \"Go talk to Sinclair,\" said Larsen and rose. \"I got a rope.\"    \"He's a dangerous-lookin' gent,\" declared Sandersen.    Larsen replied mildly: \"Mostly they's a pile more interesting when  they's dangerous. Come on, boys!\"    It had been well after midnight when Mason and Sandersen got back to  Sour Creek. The gathering of the posse had required much time. Now, as  they filed out to the hotel, to the east the mountains were beginning  to roll up out of the night, and one cloud, far away and high in the  sky, was turning pink. They found the hotel wakening even at this early  hour. At least, the Chinese cook was rattling in the kitchen as he  built the fire. When the six reached the door of Sinclair's room,  stepping lightly, they heard the occupant singing softly to himself.    \"Early riser,\" whispered Denver Jim.    \"Too early to be honest,\" replied Judge Lodge.    Larsen raised one of his great hands and imposed an absolute silence.  Then, stepping with astonishing softness, considering his bulk, he  approached the door of Sinclair's room. Into his left hand slid his .45  and instantly five guns glinted in the hands of the others. With equal  caution they ranged themselves behind the big Swede. The latter glanced  over his shoulder, made sure that everything was in readiness, and then  kicked the door violently open.    Riley Sinclair was sitting on the side of his bed, tugging on a pair of  riding boots and singing a hushed song. He interrupted himself long  enough to look up into the muzzle of Larsen's gun. Then deliberately he  finished drawing on the boot, singing while he did so; and, still  deliberately, rose and stamped his feet home in the leather. Next he  dropped his hands on his hips and considered the posse gravely.    \"Always heard tell how Sour Creek was a fine town but I didn't know  they turned out reception committees before sunup. How are you, boys?  Want my roll?\"    Larsen, as one who scorned to take a flying start on any man, dropped  his weapon back in its holster. Sinclair's own gun and cartridge belt  hang on the wall at the foot of the bed.    \"That sounds too cool to be straight,\" said the judge soberly.  \"Sinclair, I figure you know why we want you?\"    \"I dunno, gents,\" said Sinclair, who grew more and more cheerful in the  face of these six pairs of grim eyes. \"But I'm sure obliged to the gent  that give me the sendoff. What d'you want?\" Drawing into the background  Larsen said: \"Open up on him, judge. Start the questions.\"    But Sandersen was of no mind to let the slow-moving mind of the judge  handle this affair which was so vital to him. If Riley Sinclair did not  hang, Sandersen himself was instantly placed in peril of his life. He  stepped in front of Sinclair and thrust out his long arm.    \"You killed Quade!\"    Riley Sinclair rubbed his chin thoughtfully, looking past his accuser.    \"I don't think so,\" he said at length.    \"You don't think so? Don't you know?\"    \"They was two Mexicans jumped me once. One of 'em was called Pedro.  Maybe the other was Quade. That who you're talking about?'    \"You can't talk yourself out of it, Sinclair,\" said Denver Jim. \"We  mean business, real business, you'll find out!\"    \"This here is a necktie party, maybe?\" asked Riley Sinclair.    \"It is, partner,\" said big Larsen, with his continual smile.    \"Sinclair, you come over the mountains,\" went on Sandersen. \"You come  to find Quade. You ride down off'n the hills, and you come up to  Quade's house. You call him out to talk to you. You're sitting on your  horse. All at once you snatch out a gun and shoot Quade down. We know!  That bullet ranged down. It was shot from above him, plain murder! He  didn't have a chance!\"    Throwing out his facts as he saw them, one by one, there was a ring of  conviction in his voice. The six accusing faces grew hard and set.  Then, to their astonishment, they saw that Sinclair was smiling!    \"He don't noways take us serious, gents,\" declared the judge. \"Let's  take him out and see if a rope means anything to him. Sinclair, d'you  figure this is a game with us?\"    Riley Sinclair chuckled. \"Gents,\" he said easily, \"you come here all  het up. You want a pile of action, but you ain't going to get it off'n  me--not a bit! I'll tell you why. You gents are straight, and you know  straight talk when you hear it. This dead man--what's his name,  Quade?--was killed by a gent that had a reason for killing him. Wanted  to get Quade's money, or they was an old grudge. But what could my  reason be for wanting to bump off Quade? Can any of you figure that  out? There's my things. Look through 'em and see if I got Quade's  money. Maybe you think it's a grudge? Gents, I give you my word that I  never been into this country before this trip. How could there be any  grudge between me and Quade? Is that sense? Then talk sense back to  me!\"    His mirth had disappeared halfway through his speech, and in the latter  part of it his voice rang sternly. Moreover he looked them in the eye,  one by one. All of this was noted by Sandersen. He saw suddenly and  clearly that he had lost. They would not hang this man by hearsay  evidence, or by chance presumption.    Sinclair would go free. And if Sinclair went free, there would be short  shrift for Bill Sandersen. For a moment he felt his destiny wavering  back and forth on a needle point. Then he flung himself into a new  course diametrically opposed to the other.    \"Boys, it was me that started this, and I want to be the first to admit  it's a cold trail. Men has been hung with less agin' them than we got  agin' Sinclair. We know when Quade must have been killed. We know it  tallies pretty close with the time when Sinclair came down that same  trail, because that was the way he rode into Sour Creek. But no matter  how facts look, nobody _seen_ that shooting. And I say this gent  Sinclair ain't any murderer. Look him over, boys. He's clean, and I  register a vote for him. What d'you say? No matter what the rest of you  figure, I'm going to shake hands with him. I like his style!\"    He had turned his back on Riley while he spoke, but now he whirled and  thrust out his hand. The fingers of Sinclair closed slowly over the  proffered hand.    \"When it comes to the names, partner, seems like you got an edge over  me.\"    \"Have I? I'm Sandersen. Glad to know you, Sinclair.\"    \"Sandersen!\" repeated the stranger slowly. \"Sandersen!\"    Letting his fingers fall away nervelessly from the hand of the other,  he sighed deeply.    Sandersen with a side-glance followed every changing shade of  expression in that hard face. How could Sinclair attack a man who had  just defended him from a terrible charge? It could not be. For the  moment, at least, Sandersen felt he was safe. In the future, many  things might happen. At the very least, he had gained a priceless  postponement of the catastrophe.    \"Them that do me a good turn is writ down in red,\" Sinclair was saying;  \"and them that step on my toes is writ down the same way. Sandersen, I  got an idea that for one reason or another I ain't going to forget you  in a hurry.\"    There was a grim double meaning in that speech which Sandersen alone  could understand. The others of the self-appointed posse had apparently  made up their minds that Sandersen was right, and that this was a cold  trail.    \"It's like Sinclair says,\" "]]]
