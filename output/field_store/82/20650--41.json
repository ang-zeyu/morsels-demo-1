Psalm 16:1. First Part. L. M.  Confession of our poverty, and saints the best  company; or, Good works profit men, not God.    1 Preserve me, Lord, in time of need  For succour to thy throne I flee,  But have no merits there to plead;  My goodness cannot reach to thee.    2 Oft have my heart and tongue confest  How empty and how poor I am;  My praise can never make thee blest,  Nor add new glories to thy name.    3 Yet, Lord, thy saints on earth may reap  Some profit by the good we do;  These are the company I keep,  These are the choicest friends I know.    4 Let others choose the sons of mirth  To give a relish to their wine,  I love the men of heavenly birth,  Whose thoughts and language are divine.      Psalm 16:2. Second Part. L. M.  Christ's all-sufficiency.    1 How fast their guilt and sorrows rise  Who haste to seek some idol god!  I will not taste their sacrifice,  Their offerings of forbidden blood.    2 My God provides a richer cup,  And nobler food to live upon;  He for my life has offer'd up  Jesus, his best beloved Son.    3 His love is my perpetual feast;  By day his counsels guide me right;  And be his name for ever blest,  Who gives me sweet advice by night.    4 I set him still before mine eyes;  At my right hand he stands prepar'd  To keep my soul from all surprise,  And be my everlasting guard.      Psalm 16:3. Third Part. L. M.  Courage in death, and hope of the resurrection.    1 When God is nigh, my faith is strong,  His arm is my almighty prop:  Be glad, my heart; rejoice, my tongue,  My dying flesh shall rest in hope.    2 Tho' in the dust I lay my head,  Yet, gracious God, thou wilt not leave  My soul for ever with the dead,  Nor lose thy children in the grave.    3 My flesh shall thy first call obey,  Shake off the dust, and rise on high;  Then shalt thou lead the wondrous way,  Up to thy throne above the sky.    4 There streams of endless pleasure flow;  And full discoveries of thy grace  (Which we but tasted here below)  Spread heavenly joys thro' all the place.      Psalm 16:4. First Part. C. M.  Support and counsel from God without merit.    1 Save me, O Lord, from every foe;  In thee my trust I place,  Tho' all the good that I can do  Can ne'er deserve thy grace.    2 Yet if my God prolong my breath  The saints may profit by't;  The saints, the glory of the earth,  The men of my delight.    3 Let heathens to their idols haste,  And worship wood or stone;  But my delightful lot is cast  Where the true God is known.    4 His hand provides my constant food,  He fills my daily cup;  Much am I pleas'd with present good,  But more rejoice in hope.    5 God is my portion and my joy,  His counsels are my light;  He gives me sweet advice by day,  And gentle hints by night.    6 My soul would all her thoughts approve  To his all-seeing eye;  Not death, nor hell my hope shall move,  While such a friend is nigh.      Psalm 16:5. Second Part. C. M.  The death and resurrection of Christ.    1 I Set the Lord before my face,  \"He bears my courage up;  \"My heart, and tongue, their joys express,  \"My flesh shall rest in hope.    2 \"My spirit, Lord, thou wilt not leave  \"Where souls departed are;  \"Nor quit my body to the grave  \"To see corruption there.    3 \"Thou wilt reveal the path of life,  \"And raise me to thy throne;  \"Thy courts immortal pleasure give,  \"Thy presence joys unknown.\"    4 [Thus in the name of Christ, the Lord,  The holy David sung,  And Providence fulfils the word  Of his prophetic tongue.    5 Jesus, whom every saint adores,  Was crucify'd and slain;  Behold the tomb its prey restores,  Behold, he lives again!    6 When shall my feet arise and stand  On heaven's eternal hills?  There sits the Son at God's right hand,  And there the Father smiles.]      Psalm 17:1. 13 &c. S. M.  Portion of saints and sinners;  or, Hope and despair in death.    1 Arise, my gracious God,  And make the wicked flee;  They are but thy chastising rod  To drive thy saints to thee.    2 Behold the sinner dies,  His haughty words are vain;  Here in this life his pleasure lies,  And all beyond is pain.    3 Then let his pride advance,  And boast of all his store:  The Lord is my inheritance,  My soul can wish no more.    4 I shall behold the face  Of my forgiving God,  And stand complete in righteousness,  Wash'd in my Saviour's blood.    5 There's a new heaven begun,  When I awake from death,  Drest in the likeness of thy Son,  And draw immortal breath.      Psalm 17:2. L. M.  The sinner's portion, and saint's hope; or, The  heaven of separate souls, and the resurrection.    1 Lord, I am thine; but thou wilt prove  My faith, my patience, and my love;  When men of spite against me join,  They are the sword, the hand is thine.    2 Their hope and portion lies below;  'Tis all the happiness they know,  'Tis all they seek; they take their shares,  And leave the rest among their heirs.    3 What sinners value, I resign;  Lord, 'tis enough that thou art mine;  I shall behold thy blissful face,  And stand complete in righteousness.    4 This life's a dream, an empty show;  But the bright world to which I go  Hath joys substantial and sincere;  When shall I wake, and find me there?    5 O glorious hour! O blest abode!  I shall be near and like my God!  And flesh and sin no more control  The sacred pleasures of the soul.    6 My flesh shall slumber in the ground,  Till the last trumpet's joyful sound;  Then burst the chains with sweet surprise,  And in my Saviour's image rise.      Psalm 18:1. 1-6 15-18. First Part. L. M.  Deliverance from despair; or, Temptations overcome.    1 Thee will I love, O Lord, my strength,  My rock, my tower, my high defence,  Thy mighty arm shall be my trust,  For I have found salvation thence.    2 Death, and the terrors of the grave  Stood round me with their dismal shade;  While floods of high temptations rose,  And made my sinking soul afraid.    3 I saw the opening gates of hell,  With endless pains and sorrows there,  Which none but they that feel can tell,  While I was hurried to despair.    4 In my distress I call'd 'my God,'  When I could scarce believe him mine;  He bow'd his ear to my complaint,  Then did his grace appear divine.    5 [With speed he flew to my relief,  As on a cherub's wing he rode;  Awful and bright as lightning shone  The face of my deliverer, God.    6 Temptations fled at his rebuke,  The blast of his almighty breath;  He sent salvation from on high,  And drew me from the deeps of death.]    7 Great were my fears, my foes were great,  Much was their strength, and more their rage;  But Christ, my Lord, is conqueror still,  In all the wars that devils wage.    8 My song for ever shall record  That terrible, that joyful hour;  And give the glory to the Lord  Due to his mercy and his power.      Psalm 18:2. 20-26. Second Part. L. M.  Sincerity proved and rewarded.    1 Lord, thou hast seen my soul sincere,  Hast made thy truth and love appear;  Before mine eyes I set thy laws,  And thou hast own'd my righteous cause.    2 Since I have learnt thy holy ways,  I've walk'd upright before thy face;  Or if my feet did e'er depart,  'Twas never with a wicked heart.    3 What sore temptations broke my rest!  What wars and strugglings in my breast!  But thro' thy grace that reigns within,  I guard against my darling sin:    4 That sin which close besets me still,  That works and strives against my will;  When shall thy Spirit's sovereign power  Destroy it that it rise no more?    5 [With an impartial hand, the Lord  Deals out to mortals their reward;  The kind and faithful souls shall find  A God as faithful, and as kind.    6 The just and pure shall ever say,  Thou art more pure, more just than they;  And men that love revenge shall know,  God hath an arm of vengeance too.]      Psalm 18:3. 30 31 34 35 46. 3d Part. L. M.  Rejoicing in God; or, Salvation and triumph.    1 Just are thy ways, and true thy word,  Great rock of my secure abode;  Who is a God beside the Lord?  Or where's a refuge like our God?    2 'Tis he that girds me with his might,  Gives me his holy sword to wield;  And while with sin and hell I fight,  Spreads his salvation for my shield.    3 He lives (and blessed be my rock!)  The God of my salvation lives,  The dark designs of hell are broke;  Sweet is the peace my Father gives.    4 Before the scoffers of the age,  I will exalt my Father's name,  Nor tremble at their mighty rage,  But meet reproach and bear the shame.    5 To David and his royal seed  Thy grace for ever shall extend;  Thy love to saints in Christ their head  Knows not a limit, nor an end.      Psalm 18:4. First Part. C. M.  Victory and triumph over temporal enemies.    1 We love thee, Lord, and we adore,  Now is thine arm reveal'd;  Thou art our strength, our heavenly tower,  Our bulwark and our shield.    2 We fly to our eternal rock,  And find a sure defence;  His holy name our lips invoke,  And draw salvation thence.    3 When God, our leader, shines in arms,  What mortal heart can bear  The thunder of his loud alarms?

Besides,\" she added, her French blood asserting itself,  \"he is to get nineteen per cent. of the inheritance!\"    As long as the steamer remained in sight the General waved  encouragingly, his hat raised toward Heaven.    \"_Mais_,\" says Lapierre, with another shrug as he lights his pipe, \"even  you would have believed him. _Vraiment_! He would have deceived the  devil himself!\"    Up the road the wain comes creaking back again. A crow flaps across the  vineyard, laughing scornfully at good M. Lapierre, and you yourself  wonder if such a thing could have been possible.    On a rainy afternoon in March, 1905, there entered the writer's office  in the Criminal Courts Building, New York City, a ruddy, stoutly-built  man, dressed in homespun garments, accompanied by an attractive and  vivacious little woman, who, while unable to speak a single word of  English, had no difficulty in making it obvious that she had a story to  tell of the most vital importance. An interpreter was soon found and the  names of the visitors disclosed. The lady, who did the talking for both  of them, introduced herself as Madame Valoie Reddon, of Bordeaux, and  her companion as M. Emile Lapierre, landowner, of Monsegur, They had  come, she explained, from France to take possession of the inheritance  Tessier. She was a personal friend of Madame Lapierre, and as the  Tessiers had exhausted all their money in paying the expenses connected  with securing the fortune, she, being a well-to-do gentlewoman, had come  to their assistance, and for the last few months had been financing the  enterprise on a fifteen per cent. basis. If Madame Lapierre was to  receive ten million dollars, then, to be sure, Madame Reddon would have  one million five hundred thouand dollars; but, of course, it was not for  the money, but on account of friendship, that she was aiding them. I  would understand that three years had elapsed since a certain  distinguished General Pedro Suarez de Moreno had disclosed to the  Lapierres the fact that Madame was the heiress to the greatest estate in  America. M. Lapierre solemnly nodded confirmation as the lady proceeded.  It was the one subject talked about in the Gironde and Bordeaux--that  is, among those who had been fortunate enough to learn anything about  it. And for three years the Tessiers, their wives, their sons' wives,  and their connections, had been waiting to receive the glad tidings that  the conspirators had been put to rout and the rightful heirs reinstated.    It was some time before the good lady succeeded in convincing her  auditor that such a ridiculous fraud as she described had actually been  perpetrated. But there was M. Lapierre and there was Madame Valerie  Reddon sitting in the office as living witnesses to the fact. What  wonderful person could this General Moreno be, who could hypnotize a  hard-headed, thrifty farmer from the Gironde and a clever little French  woman from Bordeaux into believing that five hundred million dollars was  waiting for them on the other side of the Atlantic! I expressed my  surprise. Madame Reddon shrugged her sloping shoulders. Well, perhaps it  was hard for M'sieu' to believe, but then there were the proofs, the  documents, the _dossier_, and, most of all, there was the General  himself. Oh' if M'sieu' could see the General in his tall silk hat and  gold-headed cane!    I asked for the documents. Madame Reddon opened her bag and produced a  package of nearly one hundred letters, written in a fine Spanish hand.  Oh! he had been a wonderful writer, this gorgeous Count de Tinoco and  Marquis de la d'Essa. She had met him herself when he had been in  Bordeaux. Madame Lapierre had introduced him to her, and she had heard  him talk. How beautifully he talked! The stories of his experiences as  General of the armies of Spain under Don Carlos and as Brigadier-General  in the Philippines were as fascinating as a romance. But it was his  letters which had really led her to take a personal interest in the  undertaking. With a sigh Madame Valoie untied the little blue ribbon  which bound up the pitiful little history. If M'sieu' would be good  enough to grant the time she would begin at the beginning. Here was his  first letter written after the General's return to America:        _June 25, '02._        My dear M. Lapierre:        We have had a terrible voyage. A horrible storm broke loose in      mid-ocean, endangering all our lives.... The waves, like mountains,      threatened every instant to swallow us all; the spectacle was      terrifying. I fell from the top of the stairs 'way down into the      hole (_sic_), hurting my right leg in the centre of the tibia bone.      The ship's doctor, who is nothing but a stupid fool, left me      helpless almost the entire day.... If ever I should have dreamt what      would occur to me in this trip, not for all the gold in the world      would I have embarked. But, now that I am here, I shall not retreat      before any obstacle, in order to arrive at the fulfillment of my      enterprise, and no matter at what cost, even at that of my life. It      is necessary that I succeed--my pride demands it. Those who are in      the right shall triumph, that is sure.... In the mean time, will you      kindly give my regards to Madame and your son, and all of your      relatives, not forgetting your good old servant. Squeezing your hand      cordially, I bid you adieu.        Your devoted,        Pedro S. de Moreno.    \"Can you not see the waves, and observe him falling down the hole?\" asks  Madame Reddon,    \"Mais, voici une autre.\"        _July 11, 1902._        M. Jean Lapierre.        _My dear M. Lapierre_: As soon as I could walk a little I began my      research for the impostors of the inheritance Tessier. Without a      doubt some person who is interested in the case has already advised      them of my arrival in New York, and to take the necessary      precautions to lead me astray in my researches.        Already I have discovered almost everything. I know even the house      in which resided the deceased before his death. It is a house of      twenty-five stories high, which resembles the Church of Saint      Magdalene in Paris. To-day it is the biggest bank in New York. I      have visited it from top to bottom, ascending and descending in      steel elevators. This is a marvelous palace; it is worth more than      five million dollars. The house itself has the numbers 100, 102,      104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116 and 118. In other words, it covers      the ground of ten other houses made into one.        I have also visited six houses belonging to him, which are worth      millions and are located around Central Park....        As soon as the brothers Lespinasse knew that I had arrived in New      York they immediately took their departure, one for Paris to find      his father, Emmeric Lespinasse, the other to the city of Tuxpan, in      Mexico, to visit the properties stolen from the heirs. I have come      to an understanding with the Reverend Father Van Rensselaer, Father      Superior of the Jesuits, and have offered him two millions for his      poor, in recompense for his aid to recover and to enter into      possession of the inheritance. He takes great pains, and is my      veritable guide and confidant....        I have visited Central Park, also a property of the deceased; this      property alone is worth more than twenty million dollars.... I have      great confidence in my success, and I am almost sure to reach the      goal, if you are the heirs, for here there is a mix-up by all the      devils....        The wound of my leg has much improved, the consequences which I      feared have disappeared, and I expect soon my complete      convalescence, but the devil has bestowed upon me a toothache, which      makes me almost crazy with pain. I shall leave, nevertheless, to      begin my campaign.        Will you be kind enough to give my regards to your wife and son, and      to our old friend, etc., etc.        PEDRO S. DE MORENO.    \"May the devil bestow upon him five hundred million toothaches!\"  exclaims Lapierre, for the first time showing any sign of animation.    The other letters were read in their order, interspersed with Madame  Reddon's explanations of their effect upon the heirs in France. His  description of the elevators of steel and of the house that covered an  entire block had caused a veritable sensation. Alas! those wonders are  still wonders to them, and they still, I fancy, more than half believe  in them. The letters are lying before me now, astonishing emanations,  totally ridiculous to a prosaic American, but calculated to convince and  stimulate the imagination of a _petit bourgeois_.    The General in glowing terms paints his efforts to run down the  Lespinasse conspirators. Although suffering horribly from his fractured  tibia (when he fell into the \"hole\"), and from other dire ills, he has  \"not taken the slightest rest.\" He has been everywhere--\"New Orleans,  Florida, to the city of Coney Island\"--to corner the villains, who \"flee  in all directions.\" The daughter, Marie Louise, through whom the General  expects to secure a compromise, has left for New Orleans. \"Wonderful  coincidence,\" he writes, \"they were all living quietly and I believe had  no intention whatever to travel, and two days after my arrival in New  York they all disappeared. The most suspicious of it all is that the  banker, his wife and children had left for Coney Island for the summer  and to spend their holidays, "]]]
