Cream soups and purees are so nutritious that with bread and butter,  they furnish a satisfactory meal.      CREAM OF ALMOND SOUP    Blanch, and grind or pound one-half pound almonds, let simmer slowly in  one pint of milk for five minutes. Melt one tablespoon of butter, blend  with one of flour. Do not allow to bubble. Add one cup of milk and  thicken slightly. Then add the almond mixture and simmer again until  creamy. Remove from fire and add one cup of cream. Season with salt and  pepper to taste. Cream may be whipped or left plain.      CREAM OF CELERY SOUP    Break three stalks of celery in one-inch pieces and pound in a mortar.  Cook in double boiler with one slice of onion and three cups of milk for  twenty minutes. Remove onion, heat two tablespoons of butter, add two  tablespoons of flour, one-fourth teaspoon of pepper, one teaspoon of  salt; first two-thirds of a cup, and gradually the rest of the celery  broth, add one cup of cream; cook until smooth and serve at once.      CREAM OF ASPARAGUS SOUP    Proceed as with cream of celery soup, substituting one-half bundle of  fresh asparagus or an equal amount of canned for the stalk of celery.  Or, the tips of a bundle of asparagus may be cut off for table use and  the remainder used for soup. In either case the asparagus will be better  if mashed through a colander, thus removing the woody portions.      CREAM OF CAULIFLOWER SOUP    Take a solid head of cauliflower, scald it to take away the strong  taste; separate the flowers and proceed as with cream of celery soup.      CREAM OF CORN SOUP    Take a can of corn or six ears of corn. Run a sharp knife down through  the center of each row of kernels, and with the back of a knife press  out the pulp, leaving the husk on the cob. Break the cobs and put them  on to boil in sufficient cold water to cover them. Boil thirty minutes  and strain the liquor. Return the liquor to the fire, and when boiling  add the corn pulp and bay leaf. Cook fifteen minutes; add the cream  sauce and serve.      CREAM OF HERRING SOUP (RUSSIAN STYLE)    Place two cups of milk, two cups of water, one small onion, salt and  pepper to taste in a saucepan, and boil for ten minutes, add two  herrings which have been previously soaked and cut in small pieces; cook  until herring is tender.      MILK, OR CREAM SOUP    Heat a quart of milk or cream, add a tablespoon of sweet butter and  thicken with a spoon of flour or corn starch, wet with cold milk. Pour,  boiling, over pieces of toasted bread cut into dices; crackers may also  be used.      FISH CHOWDER    Skin and bone one and one-half pounds of codfish or haddock. Cut six  large tomatoes, six large potatoes, two large onions in small pieces,  add salt, pepper, three pints of water and cook one hour. Add one-half  pint of cream, one-fourth cup of butter, and paprika. Cook five minutes  and serve.      MOCK FISH CHOWDER    Omit fish and use same ingredients, sprinkle with chopped parsley and  serve.      GLOBE ARTICHOKE OR TURNIP SOUP    Heat two tablespoons of butter, add one and one-half pounds of sliced  turnips or artichokes and stir them in the butter, add one tablespoon of  flour, a little salt, three cups of hot milk, three cups of hot water,  stirring them in slowly. When the vegetables are done rub them through a  sieve, put them back in the saucepan, add a little sugar and more  seasoning, if required, and heat thoroughly. A little cream or butter  may be put into the tureen, and the soup stirred into it.      SPINACH SOUP    Wash, pick over and cook two quarts of spinach for twenty minutes;  drain, chop and rub through a sieve and return to the water in which it  was cooked, add one-half cup of chopped onions, cook until thoroughly  done, thicken with a white sauce made by melting two tablespoons of  butter to which is added two tablespoons of flour; stir until smooth,  add two cups of milk; season with one-half teaspoon of salt and pepper  and add the spinach mixture.      CREAM OF LETTUCE SOUP    Proceed as with spinach, substituting lettuce for spinach.      CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP    Cook one quart tomatoes (fresh or canned) with one pint water until  done, and strain through a sieve. Meanwhile melt two tablespoons of  butter, add two tablespoons of flour, add gradually one and one-half  cups of milk (or half cream and half milk), one teaspoon of salt, one  teaspoon of sugar, one-quarter teaspoon of pepper; add a little chopped  parsley and celery, and let this boil for fifteen minutes. Just before  ready to serve add one-fourth teaspoon of baking soda to the hot  strained tomatoes, pour gradually into the cream sauce stirring  constantly and serve at once.      CREAM OF LENTIL SOUP    Soak one cup of lentils over night. Drain and boil slowly for one hour  in water containing one-half teaspoon of baking soda, drain and boil  again very gently in fresh water; when the lentils are tender drain off  most of the liquid and return to the fire. Add two tablespoons of  butter, or butter substitute, two teaspoons of salt, and one-half  teaspoon of sugar. Bring three cups of milk to a boil in the  double-boiler. Just before serving mash the lentils through a strainer  directly into the milk. Serve in cups and pass croutons with the soup.      ONION SOUP    Slice two or three large onions; fry them in a tablespoon of butter  until they are soft and red, then add three tablespoons of flour and  stir until it is a little cooked. To this add slowly a pint of boiling  water, stirring all the time, so it will be smooth.    Boil and mash three good-sized potatoes. Add to them slowly a quart of  scalded milk, stirring well so it will be smooth. Add the potato and  milk mixture to the onion mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Let it  get very hot, and pass it through a strainer into the tureen. Sprinkle  over the top a little parsley chopped very fine, and a few croutons.      CREAM WINE SOUP    Put one cup of white wine and one-half cup of cold water on to boil, add  a few pieces of stick cinnamon and seven lumps of cut loaf sugar; while  boiling scald a cup of sweet cream in double boiler. Have ready the  well-beaten yolks of two eggs, pour over this the hot cream, stirring  all the time, then pour in the boiling wine, being careful to stir well  or it will curdle. Very nice for invalids. Can be eaten hot or cold.      VEGETABLE SOUP (MILCHIG)    Brown one-half cup of chopped onion in one tablespoon of butter, add one  and a half quarts of boiling water, two cups of shredded cabbage  one-half cup of chopped carrot, one leek, one tablespoon of chopped  peppers, one tablespoon of chopped celery. Boil rapidly for ten minutes,  then gently for one hour. Add one medium-sized potato diced and a  tomato, one and a half teaspoons of salt and one-quarter teaspoon of  pepper, a pinch of paprika and thyme. Cook one hour longer. Have the  cover partially off the kettle during the entire time. Ten minutes  before serving thicken with two tablespoons of flour mixed with  one-fourth cup of cold milk.      BRAUNE MEHLSUPPE (BROWN FLOUR SOUP), No. 1    Heat a spoon of butter in a spider, add a spoon of flour, stir briskly,  but do not let it get black; pour boiling water over it, add salt and  caraway seeds.      BROWN FLOUR SOUP, No. 2    Heat two tablespoons of fresh butter in a spider, add four tablespoons  of flour to it and brown to light golden brown, then add one quart  water, stirring constantly. Season with salt and pepper and a little  nutmeg. Add one pint of milk, let boil up once or twice and serve at  once.      BEER SOUP    To one pint of beer add one cup of water, let come to a boil, season  with salt and cinnamon if desired. Beat two egg yolks well with a little  sugar and flour mixed, add one cup of milk, stir until smooth, stir all  together in the hot beer mixture, let come almost to the boiling point,  fold in the beaten whites of the two eggs and serve at once with  croutons. If desired for a meat meal equal parts of water and beer may  be used instead of milk.      SOUR MILK SOUP    Let the milk stand until it jellies, but does not separate. Put it into  a saucepan and let simmer one minute. Then thicken with two generous  tablespoons of flour; blend to a smooth paste with butter. Strain  through a fine sieve and serve in cups or soup plates and sprinkle the  top with maple sugar.      POTATO SOUP    Boil and mash three or four potatoes, one tablespoon of butter, one-half  tablespoon of flour, and one teaspoon of chopped onion, letting the  onion cook in the butter a few minutes before adding the flour. When  this is cooked add to it a pint of milk, making a thin, white sauce. Add  this to the mashed potato and pass the whole through a strainer. Return  it to the fire for a few minutes to heat and blend it. Season it with  salt and pepper. Sprinkle on the soup chopped parsley and a few  croutons.    *For Fleischig Soup.*--This soup may be made with fat instead of butter,  and the water in which the potatoes have been boiled may be used instead  of the milk; any left-over meat gravy will give the soup a rich flavor.      GREEN PEA PUREE    Cook one quart of green peas until very tender. Then mash through  colander. To this amount heat one quart of milk in double boiler. Add  butter, salt and pepper to taste, and last the mashed green peas.      LEEK SOUP    Put a small piece of butter in saucepan and then six or eight leeks cut  in small pieces. Keep turning for about five minutes so they will get  brown; add water for amount desired; season with salt and pepper and put  in piece of stale bread. Strain through the strainer. Put in croutons  and serve with grated cheese.      RED WINE SOUP    Put on to boil one cup of good red wine and one-half cup of water,  sweeten to taste, add three whole cloves and three small pieces of  cinnamon bark, let boil ten minutes, and pour while boiling over the  well-beaten yolk of one egg.

We Germans are content with such; but the French,  on the other hand, display great genius in reanimating bygone times and  in bringing the past to bear upon the present condition of things.    3. The third form of Reflective history is the _Critical_. This deserves  mention as preeminently the mode, now current in Germany, of treating  history. It is not history itself that is here presented. We might more  properly designate it as a History of History--a criticism of historical  narratives and an investigation of their truth and credibility. Its  peculiarity, in point of fact as well as intention, consists in the  acuteness with which the writer extorts from the records something  which was not in the matters recorded. The French have given us much  that is profound and judicious in this class of composition, but have  not endeavored to make a merely critical procedure pass for substantial  history; their judgments have been duly presented in the form of  critical treatises. Among us, the so-called \"higher criticism,\" which  reigns supreme in the domain of philology, has also taken possession of  our historical literature; it has been the pretext for introducing all  the anti-historical monstrosities that a vain imagination could suggest.  Here we have the other method of making the past a living reality; for  historical data subjective fancies are substituted, whose merit is  measured by their boldness--that is, the scantiness of the particulars  on which they are based and the peremptoriness with which they  contravene the best established facts of history.    4. The last species of Reflective history announces its fragmentary  character on its very face. It adopts an abstract position; yet, since  it takes general points of view (such, for instance, as the History of  Art, of Law, of Religion), it forms a transition to the Philosophical  History of the World. In our time this form of the history of ideas has  been especially developed and made prominent. Such branches of national  life stand in close relation to the entire complex of a people's annals;  and the question of chief importance in relation to our subject is,  whether the connection of the whole is exhibited in its truth and  reality, or is referred to merely external relations. In the latter  case, these important phenomena (art, law, religion, etc.), appear as  purely accidental national peculiarities. It must be remarked, if the  position taken is a true one, that when Reflective history has advanced  to the adoption of general points of view, these are found to constitute  not a merely external thread, a superficial series, but are the inward  guiding soul of the occurrences and actions that occupy a nation's  annals. For, like the soul-conductor, Mercury, the Idea is, in truth,  the leader of peoples and of the world; and Spirit, the rational and  necessitated will of that conductor, is and has been the director of  the events of the world's history. To become acquainted with Spirit in  this, its office of guidance, is the object of our present undertaking.    III. The third kind of history is the _Philosophical_. No explanation  was needed of the two previous classes; their nature was self-evident.  It is otherwise with the last, which certainly seems to require an  exposition or justification. The most general definition that can be  given is, that the philosophy of history means nothing but the  thoughtful consideration of it. Thought is, indeed, essential to  humanity. It is this that distinguishes us from the brutes. In  sensation, cognition, and intellection, in our instincts and volitions,  as far as they are truly human, thought is a constant element. To insist  upon thought in this connection with history may, however, appear  unsatisfactory. In this science it would seem as if thought must be  subordinate to what is given, to the realities of fact--that this is its  basis and guide; while philosophy dwells in the region of self-produced  ideas, without reference to actuality. Approaching history thus  prepossessed, speculation might be supposed to treat it as a mere  passive material, and, so far from leaving it in its native truth, to  force it into conformity with a tyrannous idea, and to construe it, as  the phrase is, _a priori_. But as it is the business of history simply  to adopt into its records what is and has been-actual occurrences and  transactions; and since it remains true to its character in proportion  as it strictly adheres to its data, we seem to have in philosophy a  process diametrically opposed to that of the historiographer. This  contradiction, and the charge consequently brought against speculation,  shall be explained and confuted. We do not, however, propose to correct  the innumerable special misrepresentations, whether trite or novel, that  are current respecting the aims, the interests, and the modes of  treating history and its relation to philosophy.    The only thought which philosophy brings with it to the contemplation  of history, is the simple conception of Reason; that Reason is the  sovereign of the world; that the history of the world, therefore,  presents us with a rational process. This conviction and intuition is a  hypothesis in the domain of history as such; in that of philosophy it is  no hypothesis. It is there proved by speculative cognition that  Reason--and this term may here suffice us, without investigating the  relation sustained by the universe to the Divine Being--is substance, as  well as Infinite Power; its own Infinite Material is that underlying all  the natural and spiritual life which it originates, as also the Infinite  Form--that which sets this material in motion. On the one hand, Reason  is the substance of the universe--viz., that by which and in which all  reality has its being and subsistence. On the other hand, it is the  infinite energy of the universe; since Reason is not so powerless as to  be incapable of producing anything but a mere ideal, a mere  intention--having its place outside reality, nobody knows where;  something separate and abstract in the heads of certain human beings. It  is the _infinite complex of things_, their entire essence and truth. It  is its own material which it commits to its own active energy to work  up--not needing, as finite action does, the conditions of an external  material of given means from which it may obtain its support and the  objects of its activity. It supplies its own nourishment and is the  object of its own operations. While it is exclusively its own basis of  existence and absolute final aim, it is also the energizing power  realizing this aim, developing it not only in the phenomena of the  natural, but also of the spiritual universe--the history of the world.  That this \"Idea\" or \"Reason\" is the _true_, the _eternal_, the  absolutely _powerful_ essence; that it reveals itself in the world, and  that in that world nothing else is revealed but this and its honor and  glory--is the thesis which, as we have said, has been proved in  philosophy and is here regarded as demonstrated.    In entering upon this course of lectures, I may fairly presume, at  least, the existence in those of my hearers who are not acquainted with  philosophy, of a belief in Reason, a desire, a thirst for acquaintance  with it. It is, in fact, the wish for rational insight, not the ambition  to amass a mere heap of acquirements, that should be presupposed in  every case as possessing the mind of the learner in the study of  science. If the clear idea of Reason is not already developed in our  minds, in beginning the study of universal history, we should at least  have the firm, unconquerable faith that Reason does exist there, and  that the world of intelligence and conscious volition is not abandoned  to chance, but must show itself in the light of the self-cognizant Idea.  Yet I am not obliged to make such a preliminary demand upon your faith.  What I have said thus provisionally, and what I shall have further to  say, is, even in reference to our branch of science, not to be regarded  as hypothetical, but as a summary view of the whole, the result of the  investigation we are about to pursue--a result which happens to be known  to _me_, because I have traversed the entire field. It is only an  inference from the history of the world that its development has been a  rational process, that the history in question has constituted the  rational necessary course of the World-Spirit--that Spirit whose nature  is always one and the same, but which unfolds this, its one nature, in  the phenomena of the world's existence. This must, as before stated,  present itself as the ultimate result of history; but we have to take  the latter as it is. We must proceed historically--empirically. Among  other precautions we must take care not to be misled by professed  historians who (especially among the Germans, and those enjoying a  considerable authority) are chargeable with the very procedure of which  they accuse the philosopher--introducing _a priori_ inventions of their  own into the records of the past. It is, for example, a widely current  fiction that there was an original primeval people, taught directly by  God, endowed with perfect insight and wisdom, possessing a thorough  knowledge of all natural laws and spiritual truth; that there have been  such or such sacerdotal peoples; or, to mention a more specific claim,  that there was a Roman Epos, from which the Roman historians derived the  early annals of their city, etc....    I will mention only two phases and points of view that concern the  generally diffused conviction that Reason has ruled, and is still ruling  in the world, and consequently in the world's"]]]
