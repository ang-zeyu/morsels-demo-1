GENERAL BUONAPARTE.    While Josephine de Beauharnais, after the trials of these long and  stormy years, was enjoying blissful days of quiet happiness and repose,  the gusts of revolution kept bursting forth from time to time in fits of  fury, and tranquillity continued far from being permanently restored.  The clubs, those hot-beds of the revolution, still exercised their  pestilential influence over the populace of Paris, and stirred the rude  masses incessantly to fresh paroxysms of discontent and disorder.    But already the man had been found who was to crush those wild masses in  his iron grasp, and dash the speakers of the clubs down into the dust  with the flashing master-glance of his resistless eye.    That man was Napoleon Buonaparte. He was hardly twenty-nine years of  age, yet already all France was talking him as a hero crowned with  laurels, already had he trodden a brilliant career of victory. As  commander of a battalion he had performed prodigies of valor at the  recapture of Toulon; and then, after being promoted to the rank of  general, had gone to the army in Italy on behalf of the republic.  Bedecked with the laurels of his Italian campaign, the young general of  five-and-twenty had returned to France. There, the government, being  still hostile and ill-disposed toward him, wished to remove him from  Paris, and send him to La Vendee as a brigadier-general. Buonaparte  declined this mission, because he preferred remaining in the artillery  service, and, for that reason, the government of the republic relieved  him of his duties and put him on half-pay.    So, Buonaparte remained in Paris and waited. He waited for the brilliant  star that was soon to climb the firmament for him, and shed the fulness  of its rays over the whole world. Perhaps, the secret voices which  whispered in his breast of a dazzling future, and a fabulous career of  military glory, had already announced the rising of his star.    So Buonaparte lived on in Paris, and waited. He there passed quiet,  retired, and inactive days, associating with a few devoted friends only,  who aided him, with delicate tact, in his restricted circumstances. For  Buonaparte was poor; he had lost his limited means in the tempests of  the revolution, and all that he possessed consisted of the laurels he  had won on the battle-field, and his half pay as a brigadier-general.  But, like the Viscountess de Beauharnais, Napoleon had some true friends  who deemed it an honor to receive him as a guest at their table, and  also, like Josephine, he was too poor to bring his wheaten loaf with him  to the dinners that he attended, as was then the prevailing custom. He  often dined, in company with his brother Louis, at the house of his  boyhood's friend Bourrienne, and his future secretary was at that time  still his host, favored of the gods. The young general, instead of, like  his brother, bringing his wheaten loaf, brought only his ration, which  was rye-bread, and this he always abandoned to his brother Louis, who  was very fond of it, while Madame Bourrienne took care that he should  invariably find his supply of white, bread at his plate. She had managed  to get some flour smuggled into Paris from her husband's estate, and had  white-bread made of it secretly, at the pastry-cook's. Had this been  discovered, it would inevitably have prepared the way for all of them to  the scaffold.    Thus, then, young General Buonaparte, or, as he subsequently wrote the  name himself, \"Bonaparte,\" passed quiet days of expectation, hoping  that, should the existing government, so hostile to him, be suppressed  by another, his wishes might be at last fulfilled. These wishes were, by  the way, of a rather unpretending character. \"If I could only live here  quietly, at Paris,\" he once remarked to his friend Bourrienne, \"and rent  that pretty little house yonder, opposite to my friends, and keep a  carriage besides, I should be the happiest of men!\"    He was quite seriously entertaining the idea of renting the \"pretty  little house\" in common with his uncle Fesch afterward the cardinal,  when the important events that soon shook Paris once more prevented him,  and the famous 13th Vendemiaire, 1795, again summoned the famous general  away from his meditations to stern practical activity. It was on that  day, the 13th Vendemiaire (October 5th), that there came the outburst of  the storm, the subterranean rumblings of which had been so long  perceptible. The sections of Paris rose against the National Convention  which had given France a new constitution, and so fixed it that two  thirds of the members of the Convention should reappear in the new  legislative body. The sections of Paris, however, were prepared to  accept the new constitution only when it provided that the legislative  body should spring from fresh elections entirely. The Convention, thus  assailed in its ambitious hankering for power, was resolved to stand its  ground, and called upon the representatives who commanded the armed  forces, to defend the republic of their creation. Barras was appointed  the first general commanding the Army of the Interior, and Bonaparte the  second. It was not long before a ferocious conflict broke out in the  streets between the army and the insurgent sections. At that time the  populace were not always so ready, as they have been since then, to tear  up the pavements for barricades, and the revolters, put to flight by the  terrible fire and the fierce onset of the artillery, made the Church of  St. Roch and the Palais Royal their defensive points; but they were  driven from them also; the struggle in the streets recommenced, and  streams of blood had to flow ere it was over.    After the lapse of two days order was restored, and Barras declared to  the triumphant National Convention that the victory over the insurgents  was chiefly due to the comprehensive and gallant conduct of General  Bonaparte.    The National Convention, as a token of gratitude, conferred upon the  latter the permanent position of second general of the Army of the  Interior, which had been allotted to him temporarily, only on the day of  peril. From that moment, Bonaparte emerged from obscurity; his name had  risen above the horizon!    He now had a position, and he could better comprehend the whispering  voices that sang within his bosom the proud, triumphant song of his  future career. He was now already conscious that he had a shining goal  before his gaze--a goal to which he dared not yet assign a title, that  flitted about him like a dazzling fairy tale, and which he swore to make  reality at last.    One day, there came to the headquarters of the young general-in-chief a  young man who very pressingly asked to see him. Bonaparte had him  admitted, and the dignified form, the courageous, fiery glance, the  noble, handsome countenance of the stranger, at once prepossessed him in  the young man's favor, and he forthwith questioned him in gentle,  friendly tones, concerning the object of his visit.    \"General,\" said the young man, \"my name is Eugene Beauharnais, and I  have served the republic on the Rhine. My father was denounced before  the Committee of Public Safety as a _suspect_, and given over to the  Revolutionary Tribunal, who had him murdered, three days before the fall  of Robespierre.\"    \"Murdered!\" exclaimed Bonaparte, in threatening tones.    \"Yes, general, murdered!\" repeated Eugene, with resolution. \"I come now  to request, in the name of my mother, that you will have the kindness to  bring your influence to bear upon the committee, to induce them to give  me back my father's sword. I will faithfully use it in fighting the  enemies of my country and defending the cause of the republic.\"    These proud and noble words called up a gentle, kindly smile to the  stern, pale face of the young general, and the fiery flash of his eyes  grew softer.    \"Good! young man, very good!\" he said. \"I like this spirit, and this  filial tenderness. The sword of your father--the sword of General  Beauharnais--shall be restored to you. Wait!\"    With this, he called one of his adjutants, and gave him the necessary  commands. A short time only had elapsed, when the adjutant returned,  bringing with him the sword of General Beauharnais.    Bonaparte himself handed it to Eugene. The young overwhelmed with strong  emotion, pressed the weapon--the sole, dear possession of his father--to  his lips and to his heart, and tears of sacred emotion started into  his eyes.    Instantly the general stepped to his side, and his slender white hand,  which knew so well how to wield the sword, and yet was as soft, as  delicate, and as transparent as the hand of a duchess, rested lightly on  Eugene's shoulder.    \"My young friend,\" said he, in that gentle tone which won all hearts to  him, \"I should be very happy could I do anything for you or  your family.\"    Eugene gazed at him with an expression of childish amazement. \"Good  general!\" he managed to say; \"then mamma and my sister will pray  for you.\"    This ingenuousness made the general smile; and, with a friendly nod, he  desired Eugene to offer his respects to his mother, and to call upon him  soon again.    This meeting of Eugene and General Bonaparte was the commencement of the  acquaintanceship between Bonaparte and Josephine. The sword of the  guillotined General Beauharnais placed an imperial crown upon the head  of his widow, and adorned the brows of his son and his daughter with  royal diadems.        CHAPTER V.    THE MARRIAGE.    A few days after this interview between Bonaparte and Eugene, Josephine  met Bonaparte at one of the brilliant _soirees_ given by Barras, the  first general-in-chief. She asked Barras to introduce her to the young  general, and then, in her usual frank manner, utterly the opposite of  all prudery, yet none the less delicate and decorous, extending"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12027"],[0,"Crime: Its Cause and Treatment (#6)"],[1,"ncies,  instincts, capacities and potential strength or weakness. His nervous  system and his brain may be good or bad--most likely neither very good  nor very bad. All of his actions both as a child and as a man are  induced by stimulation from without. He feels, tastes, sees, hears or  smells some object, and his nerves carry the impression to his brain  where a more or less correct registration is made. Its correctness  depends largely upon the perfection of the nervous system and the  fineness of the material on which the registration is made. Perfect or  imperfect, the child begins to gather knowledge and it is stored in this  way. To the end of his days he receives impressions and stores them in  the same manner. All of these impressions are more or less imperfectly  received, imperfectly conveyed and imperfectly registered. However, he  is obliged to use the machine he has. Not only does the machine register  impressions but it sends out directions immediately following these  impressions: directions to the organism as to how to run, to walk, to  fight, to hide, to eat, to drink, or to make any other response that the  particular situation calls for.    Then, too, stimulated by these impressions, certain secretions are  instantly emptied from the ductless glands into the blood which, acting  like fuel in an engine, generate more power in the machine, fill it with  anger or fear and prepare it to respond to the directions to fight or  flee, or to any type of action incident to the machine. It is only  within a few years that biologists have had any idea of the use of  these ductless glands or of their importance in the functions of life.  Very often these ductless glands are diseased, and always they are more  or less imperfect; but in whatever condition they are, the machine  responds to their flow.    The stored-up impressions are more or less awakened under stimulation.  As life goes on, these stored impressions act as inhibitions or  stimulations to action, as the case may be. These form the material for  comparisons and judgments as to conduct. Not only are the impressions  imperfect and the record imperfect, but their value and effect depend on  the brain which compares and considers the impressions. From all this  mechanism, action is born.    That man is the product of heredity and environment and that he acts as  his machine responds to outside stimuli and nothing else, seem amply  proven by the evolution and history of man. But, quite aside from this,  logic and philosophy must lead to the same conclusions. This is not a  universe where acts result from chance. Law is everywhere supreme. Every  process of nature and life is a continuous sequence of cause and effect.  No intelligent person would ever think of an effect in the physical  world which did not follow a cause or causes. It has taken man a long  time to find this out. The recurrence of the seasons, the seed-time and  harvest, the common phenomena of Nature, were once supposed to be  outside the realm of cause and effect and due to the whim of some  powerful being. But the laws of matter are now coming to be understood.  Chance, accident and whim have been banished from the physical world.  The acts of men alone are supposed to be outside the realm of law. There  is a cause for the eternal revolution of the earth around the sun, for  the succession of seed-time and harvest, for growth and decay; but not  for the thoughts and actions of man.    All the teaching of the world is based on the theory that there is no  free will. Why else should children be trained with so much care? Why  should they be taught what is right and what is wrong? Why should so  much pains be taken in forming habits? To what effect is the storing of  knowledge in the brain of the child, except that it may be taught to  avoid the wrong and to do the right? Man's every action is caused by  motive. Whether his action is wise or unwise, the motive was at least  strong enough to move him. If two or more motives pulled in opposite  directions, he could not have acted from the weakest but must have  obeyed the strongest. The same motives applied to some other machine  might have produced an opposite result, but to his particular structure  it was all-controlling. How any special motive will affect any special  machine must depend upon the relative strength of the motive and make of  the machine. It is for this reason that intelligent people have always  taken so much pains to fortify the machine, so that it would respond to  what they believed was right. To say that one could ever act from the  weakest motive would bring chaos and chance into a world of method and  order. Even punishment could have no possible effect to deter the  criminal after release, or to influence others by the example of the  punishment. As well might the kernel of corn refuse to grow upward to  the sunlight, and grow downward instead.    Before any progress can be made in dealing with crime the world must  fully realize that crime is only a part of conduct; that each act,  criminal or otherwise, follows a cause; that given the same conditions  the same result will follow forever and ever; that all punishment for  the purpose of causing suffering, or growing out of hatred, is cruel and  anti-social; that however much society may feel the need of confining  the criminal, it must first of all understand that the act had an  all-sufficient cause for which the individual was in no way responsible,  and must find the cause of his conduct, and, so far as possible, remove  the cause.          IV    ENVIRONMENT      The acorn will inevitably produce the oak tree and it will grow true to  its pattern. All seeds and cells will do likewise. Still if the acorn is  planted in good soil, where it is properly nourished and in a spot where  it is sufficiently sheltered, the tree will be more likely to become  large and symmetrical, than if it is planted in poor soil or in an  exposed spot.    In one sense heredity is the seed, and environment the soil. The whole  structure and pattern and inherent tendencies and potentiality are in  the seed and cannot be changed. The child has nothing to do with its  early environment during the period when impressions sink the deepest  and when habits are formed. It is then that the meaning of facts is  interpreted. At this time the child is fashioned by the teachings and  environment in which it is placed. As the child receives its first  impressions, and all along through its development, it is forming habits  from those about it. These habits come to be strong, dominating forces  in its life. Very few people, if any, can trace definite views of  conduct or thought to their conscious effort, but these are born of  their structure and the environment that formed their habits after  birth.    The fact that an individual's political and religious faith depends  almost entirely on his place of birth and early youth, shows the  strength of environment in forming and shaping opinions and beliefs.    As the child grows and develops, it is influenced by all that surrounds  it. The human machine moves in response to outside stimulation. How it  will move depends upon two things, the character of the stimulant and  the machine to which it is applied. No two machines will act exactly  alike from the same stimulus. Sometimes they act in diametrically  opposite ways. For instance, under the same stimulation, one may run and  another may fight, depending perhaps on the secretions that the ductless  glands empty into the blood.    No machine can act except according to its make-up. Even an ignorant  person, who finds that the same stimulant produces different results on  different machines, would know that the structures are not the same.    Endless discussions have been devoted to the relative importance of  heredity and environment in human conduct. This is a fruitless task. In  a sense, each one is of supreme importance in the outcome of a life. It  is obvious that some structures are so perfect that almost no  environment will overcome them. Instances of strong men developing out  of poor environment are not rare. Many of these may be subject to doubt  as to whether the heredity caused the strength, for the smallest  particle of luck at some special or vital time may make all the  difference possible in the outcome of a life. While some heredities  withstand a poor environment, others are so poor that, no matter how  good the environment, the machine cannot survive. An idiot is an  illustration of one whom environment cannot change. No heredity will  overcome the hardest environment. The old saying, \"every man has his  price,\" is true in this sense, that every machine will stand just so  much and no more. Some machines reach the breaking point soon and some  later, but all have their limit. Most people have a heredity that is not  the best nor yet the worst. Given an imperfect machine, they are thrown  into a certain environment, and then up to the capacity of their  machines the outcome depends entirely on the environment. Given an  environment easy enough they will succeed, or at least \"get by.\" Given a  hard environment they will fail, or \"go down.\" Tens of thousands of men  live in a comparatively easy environment and pass their lives as useful  citizens with no taint of criminality to their names, who under a hard  environment would be found in prison. On the other hand, perhaps most of  the inmates of prisons would have lived as respected citizens if their  environment had not been so hard. Heredity has everything to do with  making the machine strong and capable, or weak and useless; but when the  machine is made and thrown on the world in its imperfect shape,  environment has everything to do in determining what its fate shall be.          V    ADJUSTING HEREDITY AND  ENVIRONMENT      Most people live a narrow existence. Perhaps the great majority of men  and women find their"]]]
